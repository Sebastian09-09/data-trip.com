msg:The hotel is nice but not as nice as expected. We stayed in the normal room. The room is big and Well equipped. But the details are not perfect . The room/furniture can get some renovation, cleaning. You don’t have a lot of choice for the soft drinks inside the room. 
The area around the hotel  is not very busy. Taxi from the costs a lot. You can‘t swim in the ocean. 
Service was very Good. But the baggy car are not available very often. 
The best is the breakfast. It was very good. Good quality and everything you want.

msg:We were delighted by the size of the room! It so comfortably fitted 4 of us in. The service was top. Everything was managed through the online concierge and her English was very good. We thoroughly enjoyed the wet area of the spa including the amazing Snow room. I had an Hannam treatment and the therapist individualised my scrub due to my sensitive skin and took very good care of me. We enjoyed our dinners at the open air Dempsey restaurant and meal delivery at lunch to any part of the resort you happened to be in. The complimentary afternoon tea and sunset downer adds to the decadence touch! The concierge also helped me organise a Covid test at the hotel before my departure flight back to Beijing. Great stay!! Would be back when the weather is warmer. The only comments would be on Housekeeping who forgot to empty our rubbish bin and filled up on the coffee milk.

msg:Capella was the second hotel we stayed at during our trip to Sanya. As expected, the service was marvelous. Special thanks to Effie who welcomed and assisted us during our stay. We had lots of questions but she was kind and patient enough to explain and respond. She also gave us a little surprise when we first entered the room during check in. I told her we were celebrating my friend’s birthday and so she gave us complimentary fruits. The room that we got was big and fancy. There were also buggies around the hotel if you don’t want to walk. Something that I like about this hotel is it’s location. It has its own private beach front and it is away from the crowd. If you want to relax and have that peace of mind, I definitely recommend staying at this hotel. Yes, it can be a little on the high end but it’s definitely worth it.

msg:Exceptional service:  The culturist assigned to me (Effy) attended to my every question, need, preference, and even things I did not know I could ask for!  When I hurt my foot while hiking, I requested bandages and ice from room service late at night.  The next morning, I received a visit from hotel staff asking about my health and offering complimentary TCM remedy for my foot.  This was truly beyond my expectation for most hotels.  She always made sure I was aware of any activities going on at the resort and invited me to make use of the amenities (spa, cocktail hour, etc.).  

Beautiful property (inside and outside): Well appointed interiors -- subtle, not too ostentatious.  Not too much bad "hotel art." The landscaping was also very elegant, with interesting trees and plants all around.  I appreciated the very serene and pleasant environment as a background for relaxation.

Quiet location away from tourist hub:  There aren't too many attractions around nor outside visitors, which provides a calm and private place for those who don't want to be in the "middle of it all." 

Thank you for a lovely experience!

In particular, with the kind care of a  culturist named Effy, the hotel had to be even nicer. She took care of my family carefully during the stay. It is a great advantage that such a culturist is in the hotel.

msg:I took my son to the Children's Day. The cultural and tourism officer who was responsible for receiving me was Dean. I booked the growth camp on the day of Children's Day, but the package I booked did not include it. I was not sure about the situation, so I asked Dean, and he directly gave me a free full-day growth camp. It was a surprise. The hotel is very large. I have stayed in other hotels in Sanya, but none of them are as big as Capella's basic room. The most important thing is that Dean is very considerate. Because I usually don't take the initiative to ask, but Dean took the initiative to give me two fresh coconut juices and a small cake for Children's Day that I can DIY. There are many surprises. What surprised me most was that Dean contacted me at 10 o'clock the night before I left the hotel and said that there were small parting gifts, beach bags, and unique little stars and luggage tags. It made me feel valued. The experience was really good. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but only Capella made me feel at home. Probably because there are few people, it is quiet, and it is suitable for vacation. ⛱️The afternoon tea and the nightfall ceremony are very special. The coconut buns for breakfast are especially delicious. The growth camp has rich activities and the children are very satisfied

Thank you to the duty manager, Manager Zhou, thank you to the cultural and tourism officer Krystal, and thank you to every employee in Capella. Your smiles, your service, and your care are truly interpreting what the service attitude of a top luxury hotel is. The hotel is beautiful, the sea of ​​Tufu Bay is beautiful, and the people of Capella are beautiful. The beauty is not only the environment, not only the scenery, but more of it is reflected in the feeling of being at home. If I come to Sanya again, I will return to Capella...

👍Most recommended:
The best service is the cultural and tourism officer. Crystal, the cultural and tourism officer, added WeChat the day before check-in and cared about my needs. She was very enthusiastic. She really cared about the needs of guests 24 hours a day, anytime, anywhere. I want to give her a big thumbs up👍👍👍Crystal, the cultural and tourism officer, arranged everything for our vacation, and she tried her best to meet my needs. Thank her. Capella Fuwan is really the ceiling.
🍽Dining recommendation:
The Thai restaurant is delicious, the manager is very enthusiastic and will give you coconuts
I especially want to praise the manager of the breakfast restaurant, Rika, who is very enthusiastic and really kind-hearted. 👍, I accidentally mentioned that coconuts are delicious during breakfast, and she really took it seriously and gave me two coconuts. I was particularly touched that she prepared a bouquet of flowers for my mother on Mother's Day, which made my mother very happy. Capella's service is really touching and makes our trip to Capella feel like home...

First of all, the front desk checked in quickly and the little brother helped to pull the luggage and collect things. I added the housekeeper WeChat of the cultural and tourism officer Krystal at the front desk. The very nice lady was beautiful and kind. She sent us to the room to introduce the room facilities. The room facilities were very new and maintained. It was super quiet to sleep at night. The little sister sent WeChat every day to remind us of various activities in the hotel. Thank you very much for Miss Krystal's careful arrangements. Capella is not only the ceiling of Hainan's hotel industry, but its service is even more ceiling-level. It is really at home, meticulous and thoughtful! The environment is very clean and tidy. All the staff will take the initiative to say hello. The breakfast variety is very rich and the staff has a strong sense of service. There are many food stalls near the hotel, which are very cheap and taste good. The environment of Capella is not worse than that of foreign countries or even better. The beach sand is clean and delicate, without impurities. My husband and I went to Bali for vacation before. I chose Hainan because of the mask. I have to check in Hainan 1 to 2 times a year. This time I chose Capella and it was worth the trip and lived up to the beauty! Thanks to the lady and the hotel for the careful arrangement! I highly recommend staying at Capella to experience its service and environment.

msg:About the experience of staying at Capella Hotel:
This time I came to Sanya and booked three hotels, namely Rosewood, Mandarin Oriental and Capella. The price of Capella is actually the most expensive, so I thought the service and environment should be the best, but after checking in, I was surprised to find that it was so disappointing.
First of all, in terms of service, (objective review), the good thing is that flowers and honeymoon cakes were sent with a sense of ceremony when checking in. I will also describe the bad things one by one. First of all, the room that costs more than 3,000 yuan a night did not have a Dyson hair dryer. I had to call the guest room phone to send one; secondly, the hotel is very large, but there are very few shuttle buses, and they come very slowly even if I call them. Mandarin Oriental does a better job in this regard; finally, I feel that the service staff has a weak sense of service. In the morning, he knocked on the door and asked me if I could clean the room. I said it would be later, and he asked when it could be cleaned (I have stayed in many five-star hotels and have never seen such service staff.) When I ate, I asked for two glasses of iced Americano, but no one came after waiting for a long time. I asked again and they hurried to do it. When checking out, my husband and I were carrying heavy luggage, and a waiter followed us and played with his phone all the way without asking to come over to help.
The second is the environment and breakfast. Capella has its own characteristics in both the garden and the room, without losing the sense of design. The Chinese garden a**osphere is reflected in all aspects, but there are many small insects flying in the elevator at night, which has never appeared in other hotels! The breakfast is really great, richer and more attentive than other hotels.
In summary, I heard that Capella is the ceiling of Sanya hotels, but it is really disappointing. The service staff at the beach or at the door are sometimes on duty and sometimes not. The light switches in the room are not clearly marked. There is not even sugar-free cola in the refrigerator. It is not as good as the magnificent and Oriental Mandarin, which are one or two thousand cheaper than him. I hope the hotel can recognize its own positioning. As for me, I will not consider staying here next time I come to Sanya.

The only drawback is that the hotel shuttle bus is a bit busy. I waited for a long time in the wind after returning to the room from the swimming pool at night.

The service of Capella Hotel is really very good, just like Amman Nha Trang.

Every hotel employee is very dedicated to the service, and every request is responded to immediately without saying it a second time. They say less and do more, which is very pragmatic and reliable. During the four days of stay, the cultural and tourism officer Rebecca responded at any time, with a sincere and enthusiastic attitude, and handled things professionally and efficiently.
In the future, we are willing to continue to try Capella in other cities.

msg:Capella Sanya is definitely an amazing luxury hotel!

From the moment you step into the hotel, you can feel its high-end and luxury. The hotel's design is ingenious, combining modern and traditional elements to create an elegant and comfortable a**osphere.

The room is spacious and bright, with complete facilities and extremely comfortable beds, allowing people to get a full rest. The hotel's service is impeccable. The staff are warm and thoughtful, always paying attention to the needs of the guests, especially Rebecca, the cultural and tourism officer of Capella. I came to understand and meet the needs of the guests one day in advance, helped arrange the pick-up from the previous hotel, and was able to inform the hotel of various activities in advance at the first time, making people feel meticulous care.

The catering is also excellent, with a variety of delicious food that makes people salivate. I went to the hotel's Thai restaurant for dinner. Looking at the entire Sanya, the taste service is also second to none. The hotel's swimming pool and beach are also very beautiful, allowing people to enjoy the sun and waves to their heart's content.

In short, Capella Sanya is an unforgettable hotel. Whether it is a vacation or a business trip, it is a very good choice. 😉

msg:I really like Capella's architectural style, and the clever integration of what it wants to show to guests in every detail of the service and architecture. Capella makes people know that Sanya is not just about blue sea, blue sky, beaches and waves. This appropriate service experience makes me feel very happy. Thank you very much for Jenny's guidance and detailed introduction at the front desk.
My personal sensory experience is that the quality of the bedding is relatively comfortable, and the bath towels and supplies are relatively comfortable. For tall people or people who sleep lower, the sofa at the end of the bed is higher than the bed. Although there are not many types of breakfast, it is very fresh. The variety is not the top in Sanya, but the freshness of the ingredients is very good. The shampoo and body wash of Fumar is quite satisfactory and is relatively easy to use. If you mind the large bottles of shared ones, you may need to bring them yourself. Everything else is very good. The service management staff is very nice from top to bottom. I would like to thank our housekeeper Jenny again for her help and the small gift she gave me when I checked out.

The breakfast is the best and richest meal I have had in Sanya hotels so far, and it ends at 11 o'clock. There is also a snack in the afternoon, which can solve the hunger after checking in. There is sparkling wine and red wine tasting in the evening. The room is not bad. I slept very comfortably. I especially want to praise the brigade officer Brian below. He is very nice and will communicate and solve any problems in time. He also gave me two coconuts, which made me very happy. Brian gave me a full experience of staying at Capella this time.

There are Thai restaurants, Western restaurants, Chinese restaurants, and 24-hour room service. Remember to make a reservation in advance during the restaurant's peak season. Pastries are provided in the afternoon, and a glass of wine is available from 6 to 7 pm~
 
The service is pretty good. There are supplies for babies, small toilets at the end of the bed, etc. Occasionally, I will come and ask if anything is missing or need to be added. Keep coming to deliver water. Basically, everything is answered within a reasonable range~

The swimming pool and children's beach are very close and the experience is good. The children had a great time.

This time I had a very good experience at Capella. Brian, the cultural and tourism officer, was very considerate and prepared small cakes and drinks to add a touch of surprise to our trip. The overall service made us feel at home.

Environment:
The overall environment is very pleasant, the landscaping is well maintained, and there is a view at every step. It's great to take a walk in the hotel! The coconut grove bordering the beach is particularly beautiful.

Facilities:
The various facilities in the room are good to use. In addition, I recommend going to the spa to experience it once, which is very enjoyable.

Looking forward to returning to Capella next time!

msg:Capella is the first choice for hotels in Sanya. I saw the recommendation in Xiaohongshu before. I stayed at Yihaixuan during the Spring Festival, and I was not disappointed. The room is very large, especially the balcony has a great view, with an unbeatable sea view. The hotel has a beautiful environment, which is a Southeast Asian style. The large botanical garden is full of green and makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. My favorite is the hotel's private beach, which has many beach chairs and is a must-have for enjoying the sea breeze and sea view. Dinners for the three nights were all in the hotel. We chose Lanting, The Dempsey Western Restaurant and Sabai Thai Restaurant respectively. They all tasted very good, and Lanting had the best service😊Finally, thumbs up to Janny, the cultural and tourism officer! We took the initiative to contact us the day before departure, and we were greeted warmly when we arrived at the store. We were given various warm reminders and answered all our questions. They even prepared a small gift for us when we checked out today, which was so thoughtful! grateful! Let us have a great Spring Festival holiday here!

msg:After the New Year, I was not too busy thinking about lying down at the wrong peak, so I ended up here. How should I put it? It is still different from the famous Capella Sanya that I imagined.

The bed in the room was very comfortable and I slept well for several days. But I don’t understand that wardrobe. It’s useless to have a two-layer hanging rod. The hotel gym is good, but the design is a bit problematic. If you want to use the sauna after exercise, you have to walk a long way, which is extremely inconvenient. There are some parts of the beach that could be improved, but nothing major.

The restaurants are of good quality, especially the Thai restaurant. The breakfast is also rich and can be eaten for a week. But on the first day I checked in, I went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner and encountered the problem that many dishes could not be ordered because there were no ingredients. I felt that it was not the standard of a luxury hotel.

I would like to thank Ethan Wei for taking care of me throughout the whole process, as we were almost all in the hotel, and his proper arrangements made the whole experience a lot better.

msg:The ceiling of the Sanya Hotel lives up to its name. This is the fourth year we have stayed at this hotel, and it is our favorite hotel in Sanya. We have personally experienced the ups and downs of this hotel over the past four years. First of all, I would like to praise the manager on duty in lobby No. 4/3, a girl whom I have never met. She responded very promptly to our needs. She contacted us to solve the problem as soon as possible when the cultural and tourism officer had no feedback. Thumbs up! The housekeeper Judy was attentive and thoughtful throughout the whole process. Once I forgot to check the time and contacted her at 11:30 in the evening, but she responded in time, which made me feel embarrassed. I would like to express my gratitude! Polly, the waiter at the western restaurant, served us very professionally during our child's birthday dinner. Her smiling face accompanied us throughout the whole process. The dining table was originally very small and the food could not be accommodated, making it uncomfortable. Polly's service made up for the lack of hardware. . In fact, Capella's overall service is very proactive, and the management's attitude of wanting to do a good job in the hotel can be seen from the fact that the management is busy working on the front lines. Having said the good things, here are some small suggestions: 1. One of the drivers who picked us up smelled too much. It felt like he hadn’t taken a shower for a long time, which made me endure the smell all the way. I hope he can pay attention to his personal hygiene. 2. I hope there is still a priority in the order in which the shuttle buses drop off guests, because in the past three years when we came, we always dropped off guests from the four gardens in spring, summer, autumn and winter first, and then dropped off guests from the manor. This time we stayed in Xia Mansion, and The manor was also on the way. Both shuttle buses took us to the manor first and then circled back to take us back to Xia Mansion. It felt like there was no priority. After the other guests left, I asked the driver tactfully why we were not dropped off first since we were staying in a villa. The driver said disdainfully that your place is not a villa. Only those with 2, 3 or 4 bedrooms are called villas, and they have a dedicated butler to pick them up. . I am speechless. The money still hasn't been spent enough. 3. The beach slippers in the room are flip-flops. They feel like being tortured and very painful. Can you give more options to guests who cannot wear flip-flops? 4. Afternoon time is becoming more and more dispensable. From the earliest French cakes, nut snacks, and fruit drink Evian buffets, to later snacks with ice cream cones and Evian for each person, to now each person A snack (not delicious), no Evian, no cone, the child is very disappointed, said nothing else is OK, can there be a cone? On the day we checked in, the room was not cleaned and we went out to eat once. We never went there again, and the project slowly died out. 5. I didn’t see anything with a sense of ritual this time. In the past, when I checked in with a baby, I would get a starfish bread with the baby's name on it. The baby would be very happy to see it. Not this time. It was my birthday and I was given a cake. There was only a happy birthday sign on it but no name? Who doesn’t write a name on their cake? I’ve come here to celebrate birthdays before, but this time the details weren’t done well, and I already gave them away, so why weren’t they in place? 7. Ordering food at the swimming pool is very inconvenient. I scanned the QR code on the table, but what I scanned was the wine list and the beach barbecue set meal worth thousands. I still had to manually find someone to order. This is because I brought my mobile phone with me. It would be more troublesome to sign the room bill without bringing my mobile phone while swimming. Let’s see how we can make the guests’ consumption smoother. I’m tired of writing, so I won’t write anymore, all in the hope that Capella can maintain its first-class standards and become a must-have for more people.

We took our children with us and asked to stay in a room with a small garden on the first floor. We arranged the children's supplies and there was a problem with the dishes ordered in the room. We immediately arranged for replacements. There was also the hat we lost the day before. Monica took care of it within ten minutes. Helped us find it. It was really a very efficient service. They answered all our questions and almost solved all the problems we encountered immediately. Capella's butler-style service is definitely the best choice for customers who require it. Thanks again to the housekeeper Monica, I will definitely come again next time.

msg:Capella can really be regarded as the ceiling of domestic resort hotels, and there are all kinds of praises online! I would like to say a few shortcomings here. One is that children’s activities are not thoughtful enough and are a bit perfunctory and routine! Second, the outdoor swimming pool and children's swimming pool are not constant temperature, which is really a flaw! But it is possible that Capella does not focus on parent-child routes, but on holiday routes!
Let’s talk about the service. It’s very convenient to experience the considerate service of the housekeeper Monica from the moment you check in. It’s really convenient to just send us a WeChat message if you don’t understand something! I also particularly like their bar, which is worthy of the fees and configurations of a five-star hotel!
In short, it is really pleasant to experience a resort-style hotel with low crowd density in China! It feels like being abroad! I hope all major hotels in China will learn from Capella’s management team! A more international experience with a holiday feel!

msg:The light in the room was dark, and the two bags of snacks in the minibar were not replaced after three nights of stay. I almost didn't drink any drinks. The breakfast was a five-star standard and rich, not exquisite and featureless. The cultural tourism official added WeChat one day before check-in, and the basic requirements for follow-up service were met throughout the entire process. The hotel’s biggest highlight is the fitness center. The sauna bubble bath and igloo are worth experiencing. It would be better if you put an aromatherapy in it. The immersive experience course is a bit of a stretch. There are no classes for three days...

The room in the main building was a bit far from the beach, so I ended up staying in a suite.

msg:This time I brought my parents to Sanya for vacation. We arranged for them to stay in 3 hotels for two nights each. The first stop was Capella, which directly raised the level of this trip, causing them to say "Capella" from time to time later. "How are you happy?" Hahahaha
In terms of hardware, Capella's rooms are the best, and the gardens and landscapes are also the most beautiful. Unfortunately, the weather is not kind. It rained on the first day and was cloudy on the second day. I think it may be God's special arrangement. I hope I can go there a few more times. , feel its goodness more.
Even if it rains, it can't hide its beauty. The lobby is really beautiful. I was shocked as soon as I entered! The Tai Chi performance in the morning, afternoon tea, and cocktail party in the evening were also well arranged.
In terms of software, every staff member we met had a smile. The package includes a 30-minute spa. My mother said that the technician's skills are also very good. I would like to highlight my housekeeper Eda. She will be my choice again. One of the reasons for Capella is that chatting with her is like a friend. She responds to everything, is considerate and thoughtful, enthusiastic and measured. With such employees, it is no wonder that Capella can become the ceiling of Sanya hotels. I have stayed there Among many five-star hotels in China, Capella ranks among the top three and is well worth experiencing.
If you insist on being picky, I think the breakfast dishes can be improved. After eating it for two mornings, the stir-fry dishes are the same. It is best to change them. For example, stir-fry cabbage today and stir-fry spinach tomorrow.

The hotel is great for taking photos. The food is delicious and the breakfast is rich.
Especially the Thai restaurant tastes very good, recommended! !
The most unacceptable thing about the hotel is that the beach is not private. The beach is very messy. There are many people wandering around and it looks like a tourist attraction. There are also many people taking photos with their cameras. They often solicit business and say they will take photos for you, which really kills the scenery.

It is also understandable that it is not convenient to use a car in the hotel. I contacted the front desk to ask for a car. It took a long time and no car came to pick up the balcony outside the room. There are bugs on the wall* The bath water in the bathtub is green. After consulting with the staff, there is no reasonable explanation for the sand-like residue left at the bottom of the bathtub after waterproofing. I personally feel that the water filtration is not adequate.

The breakfast is sumptuous, but it would be better if the hotel could offer buffet lunch and dinner. After all, traveling alone like me, the menu options are really limited.

The children loved it very much. I will definitely stay here again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:This time I stayed in the top three hotels in Sanya. Tufu Bay is very clean, and the service is really good. The hotel facilities are very complete, the room layout is my favorite style, and the swimming pool is amazing. There is pick-up and drop-off for every trip. For couples, Sun Bay Park Hyatt is suitable. The Park Hyatt has a beautiful coastal road, not many people on the beach, smart toilets, and the invincible ocean view room is very comfortable, and the food is changed every day. For families, Tufu Bay is suitable, comprehensive The facilities are very complete, the food in the room is changed every day, and it is free. Sun Bay is close to the duty-free shop, and the style is more youthful. The swimming pool on the roof is a famous internet spot, and the bar is also very nice. The services of all three are very good and attentive. . Sure enough, it deserves to be in the top three of the luxury list. In comparison, the Bird's Nest is only suitable for two days. I can't stay for too long anyway. It is not so convenient to travel up there after visiting the attractions. It is a bit troublesome to go up and down the mountain, and eating breakfast is also troublesome, but from the side It is said that it is also suitable for people who have a quiet mind.

Perhaps because I only used it to move between the lobby and my room, I didn't experience the slow pick-up cart mentioned in other reviews.
I think there was a good selection of breakfast items.
Above all, I was impressed by the speed of response from the butler, Eda, and all of my requests were quickly responded to, which made me feel very comfortable.
It was great that they prepared a nice present for me when I checked out.

The hotel's garden landscape is unique, and entering the hotel feels like entering a paradise!
Circles and squares are used more often!
The master's garden design is indeed different! great!
Fountains⛲ are also everywhere, and the use of colors is also ingenious.
The facilities are complete and the hotel is relatively new, but it is starting to age. Needs more careful maintenance!
I feel it is the hotel with the best garden view in Sanya!
Breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktail hour are all included in the room rate, and every hotel guest has executive benefits! Very generous! Ha ha
I like this!

Jenny, the cultural and tourism officer, provided warm and thoughtful service. I am very satisfied!
The butler at the Capella Hotel is called the Cultural Tourism Officer.
They contacted me one day in advance. When I arrived at the hotel, they greeted me at the lobby door and sent me the detailed activities of the hotel! fine!
I am constantly reminded of various events and rituals at the hotel!


Highly recommended for vacation! A must-stay series!

The disadvantage is that the price is not cheap!
You must come if you have enough budget, really! My trip to Capella Hainan will be one I will never forget!

msg:Capella: Sanya’s number one and top brand
Capella Hotel is one of the most popular hotels in Sanya. Second experience. Personally, I think it's generally better at the same level. The characteristics are EDITION (close to duty-free shops and many in-person projects), Magnificent (only the swimming pool is the highlight), and Park Hyatt (ocean view room has a good view). However, my personal favorite is Mandarin Oriental, with its accumulated heritage and The service is unparalleled, but the facilities are a bit old and the room has a musty smell.
Capella is located in Tufu Bay, Lingshui, which is still some distance away from Haitang Bay. A housekeeper named Eda is very enthusiastic and will accompany and share various activities and services of the hotel.
There are only farmhouses in the surrounding area, and it takes 20 minutes to drive to the duty-free city CDF. It is also difficult to take out food in the hotel. The Thai food in the hotel restaurant Babeibabei is of good quality, but it is expensive. The two of them spent more than 1,600. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality is okay.
There is a happy hour with free afternoon tea, which tastes good.
The hotel room is very nice, with a large area and exquisite online decoration. The minibar has a good level of free non-alcoholic drinks and fruits. The balcony has a little sea view, which is relatively far away.
The overall environment of the hotel is also very good, with high-level greening and architecture. The spa center is well-equipped and the igloo service is also good. It is very fast to go to the pool and beach with a battery car. The swimming pool design is good. Because there are not many guests, most areas of the hotel are relatively quiet and have a resort feel.

We, a group of four, two adults and two children, started the hotel service from the moment we arrived at the hotel. We adults were in charge. The staff at the hotel were there to help us with our children and the check-in time took no more than five minutes. Jenny, the cultural and tourism officer, carefully introduced us to the various features of the hotel. She accompanied us throughout the process and made us familiar with the hotel environment. He led us into the room and introduced the layout of the room. The hotel room is a**ospheric. The toiletries are also Fumal. The most surprising thing is that the bedding is very comfortable and the Egyptian cotton satin has a high weave. The hotel breakfast is also great. The desserts and Cantonese breakfast are highly recommended. I have eaten in the three restaurants in the hotel. The Lanting Chinese restaurant is really delicious. Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to the cultural and tourism officer Jenny for always reminding us of various activities in the hotel and helping us arrange parent-child activities. We will definitely stay here again!

The free snacks (including but not limited to potato chips imported from the UK) and drinks (Evian, cocktails, etc.) are of high quality and abundant. The hotel's private beach is very beautiful, with a view of the skyline, not a bay view. If you have a smart toilet, it is recommended to consider upgrading to the ToTo Neorest series for a better experience. The hotel's dining and drinking experience deserves a separate mention: it provides exquisite afternoon tea (see picture), and in the evening there are piano performances and foreign singers singing (see picture), paired with cocktails, wine and other drinks - all provided free of charge. The hotel doesn't have that. I will come here again with my family and friends if I have the chance.

We stayed for 5 days and felt that if we only stayed in the hotel for 2 days, we would really have no experience, plus people are lazy. Our personal butler is Monica, a kind-hearted person who has been able to meet our requirements very well and provide more care and help these days. I didn't take any photos of the room. I booked the simplest twin bed, which I feel is the most comfortable twin bed I've ever stayed in. For a family like me with a baby, the overall experience is that I can eat for free every day, and the hotel restaurant tastes pretty good. The most satisfying thing is everyone's service, from the smile to the sincere companionship and kindness. Will choose next time

His works are really beautiful and elegant; every step in the hotel can be said to be a scene-by-scene, photo-taking! It is absolutely possible to include room hardware. They are basically high-end brands in their respective fields. The toiletries are great and the bedding is very good. Except for the alcohol charges, everything else in the minibar is free, but it is much better than when it first opened. Slightly reduced allocation! The hotel room design is absolutely grand and comfortable! The service provided by Rebecca, the cultural and tourism officer, is also very good.

msg:Service: The housekeeper Irene is very considerate and will help us solve problems in time. Room service is very polite and timely.
Environment: The hotel environment is full of design and aesthetic. The rooms are very stylish, the curtains are automatic, and the balcony is large. Facing the sea, you can have a soft drink or coffee from the refrigerator and enjoy your leisure time. The four-piece bed set has a count of 600, which is silky and delicate, and the nightly tidying service is also very detailed.
Restaurant: The steaks in the Western restaurant are top-notch, the seafood platter is rich and fresh, and the waiter Jason is very warm and thoughtful.
Breakfast: Very rich variety. The coffee is freshly made from a commercial coffee machine, and there's salmon, which I love.
Hygiene: Clean and tidy, there are women's makeup mirrors, you can sit and put on makeup. There is only one thing that I think can be improved. The lid of the toilet trash can is inconvenient to put garbage in, and it also makes a harsh sound. If you get up at night to go to the toilet, it will be noisy. There was always the sound of the housekeeping depar**ent aunt outside the door in the morning. The sound insulation of the door was not very good, so it was a bit noisy in the morning.

msg:I stay in Sanya almost every year. Capella is my favorite hotel in Sanya. This is my second stay and I will choose it again in the future. The scenery of the hotel is very beautiful, the facilities and services are very good, and the attitude of each staff member is also very enthusiastic. What deserves special praise is that the butler Dean is very thoughtful and meticulous. Two small things are enough to illustrate. 1. On the second day of check-in, He learned that our stay-at-home hotel (actually we are all stay-at-home hotels in Sanya) took the initiative to deliver fruits; 2. Because the flight was changed to 7 pm, he took the initiative to apply for a delayed check-out until 3 o'clock for us, and asked us to check out at 3 o'clock. After the room, go to the restaurant for afternoon dessert (free desserts and drinks are available from 3 to 4 pm every day) before going to the airport. In addition, the breakfast was also very rich and delicious, and the waiters and staff in the restaurant were also very warm and thoughtful. Let’s talk about two things in the restaurant. 1. During dessert the next afternoon, I casually said that I wanted to eat yesterday’s fried chicken nuggets (there are five or six different kinds of desserts every day), and the chef immediately said: I’ll fry them for you, really. It’s so heart-warming; 2. I forgot my favorite coat on the chair during breakfast. I didn’t remember until the next afternoon that the waiter in the restaurant picked it up and put it in a plastic bag. In short, Capella is first-class in terms of facilities, environment and services and is worth having. To add: the morning and evening rituals are very unique.

msg:In recent years, Ctrip has acquired diamonds and has indeed stayed in many hotels. Personally, I feel that Capella's advantage lies in its elegance. There are not so many rooms. It focuses on high-end, quiet, private and quality. The service, environment and standards are all first-class. Capella is unlike other hotels. People in Wuyang Wuyang have to wait for half a day for breakfast, and they also need to queue up for the restaurant. It takes an hour to call the front desk before someone responds. Krystal, the cultural and tourism officer, is very patient, meticulous and considerate in her service. If you have any questions, she can reply at any time. She is very enthusiastic and a little flattered👍🏻There is also cake and red wine for the anniversary! Thank you! Looking forward to your next trip to Capella

The room facilities and the staff's service awareness are very good. The Western restaurants, Chinese restaurants, and Thai restaurants are all very delicious. Every day The hotel provides afternoon tea at 3 p.m., and the children's play facilities are also very diversified. The children don't want to go home while playing, and there is also one-on-one considerate service from the cultural and tourism officer Ead. This is something that has never been seen in other hotels. Just take it as a treat. To put it bluntly, Capella Hotel is the best hotel experience I have ever stayed in. I will choose Capella Hotel again when I go to Hainan in the future. It’s great👍🏻

msg:This is the first time I want to complain about a hotel. First, we checked in and were given a room with a strong paint smell. I felt short of breath after staying for a few minutes. Then I contacted the staff and asked them to change my room. I waited for an hour. I called three times to inquire. During the waiting period, no staff told me how long I needed to wait or that the room to be changed was not cleaned properly. So I kept asking the guests to wait in a room with a strong paint smell. I can't even keep up with my afternoon schedule. Second, when I returned to the hotel room around 11 o'clock in the evening, I needed to take a hotel car. I made four phone calls to arrange for a car to be taken back to the room. After waiting for forty minutes, I didn't see anyone. In the end, I couldn't walk back by myself. . Third, the room hygiene is worrisome, and the remaining wine bottles from the previous guest are still thrown in the closet. Is this the service and hotel environment that a hotel with 4,000 a night should have? I will never choose your hotel again, the price is totally unworthy!

msg:Went to stay during the Chris**as period and the weather was a bit cold. It is said that this kind of weather is rare in Sanya, haha.
The hotel is decorated in a Chris**as a**osphere. I like the high ceiling of the lobby. The water curtain at the door is very distinctive.
The lady Crystal who received us was very nice. She gave us coconuts, helped me make reservations for the spa, treated us to two free special cocktails, and also gave us a canvas bag, which was very suitable for carrying surfing and diving equipment. Overall very satisfied.
The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The afternoon tea co-branded with Laibani is also very beautiful. It is worth mentioning that the spa center has comfortable spa techniques, and the sacred ceremony of earth blessing (sounds very evil hhhhh) and the first quarter moon are all good. When I go out to play, I like surfing, diving, eating seafood every day and then being happy. Bad~
All in all, it’s very good. Thanks again to Miss Crystal!

The best thing is the service of the hotel. And not the awkward service. On my birthday, a group of people sang happy birthday to me. As a social worker, I couldn't stand it. The housekeeper Eda is always online, you can contact her if you need anything. The service is so considerate! The hotel provides strollers, but there are still many steps in some locations. The road to the beach is okay, with fewer steps. The scenery is great. As beautiful as a painting.

msg:Many people are willing to call Capella the top luxury. Instead of saying that, it is better to say it is a secluded hotel. I have stayed in several theme hotels in the half circle around the island in Hainan. In comparison, Capella is the most vacation-friendly one. It feels like it’s still fun for parents and children. The supporting facilities for parents and children are not the best, but they are definitely better than many large hotels with parent-child themes.

Service: I have nothing to say about the service. From the cultural and tourism officer, concierge to restaurant staff and room cleaning, every employee is so cute, amiable and polite. Especially the little monkey sister in the children's center is very childlike and patient in playing with the children.

Environment: The hotel is full of beautiful scenery from the front lobby to the guest rooms to the beach. The last time there was such a green gardening design was the Four Seasons in Mauritius.

Hygiene: Every corner is clean and hygienic

Enjoy sumptuous minibar snacks and soft drinks (updated daily): replenished daily. Alcohol is charged.
Free snacks and soft drinks in the living room, including sweet afternoon snacks: the hotel’s afternoon snacks and night-time rituals are very nice and thoughtful, giving guests a feeling of coming home.

Monica, the cultural and tourism officer, was very helpful. She sent the hotel activities and menus to the group in advance, which made it easier to plan the itinerary. Perhaps because of the off-season, the room has been upgraded. It is very large and the double bathtub is very comfortable! It's just that the facilities and linens are a bit old. It doesn't look like it's only been open for 4 years. The activities are a bit lacking. After all, there isn't much to do or eat nearby, just stay in the hotel. I will come again next time ~ if the price is not very expensive haha

msg:This is the third year in a row that I have come to Sanya, but it is said that the location of Capella no longer belongs to Sanya. It is called Lingshui~ The design of the hotel is very good, covered with various vegetation, even when going from the room to the main swimming pool and the beach under the bright sun, it is You don’t have to go out in the sun~ There are many morning and evening rituals, and various activities. I just feel lazy, so I participated in two symbolically~
The breakfast buffet is also very rich, and the waiters are attentive and make you feel at home. For our first dinner, we tried a Thai restaurant. The outdoor table next to the water had a better environment. But the chef's taste may be a little too sweet. Even we Suzhou people thought that one experience was enough, so we switched to Western restaurants on the second and third days. The chef will give us some pre-dinner rosés, simple tapas, and even after-dinner desserts, and prepare a complete course for us. The service is really considerate. The ingredients are very fresh, the taste is relatively light, and the quantity is just right~
The only slightly embarrassing thing is that because the public beach is closely adjacent to the hotel, the privacy of the luxury hotel is slightly compromised. The security guard at the swimming pool is quite serious, verifying the room information with the tourists on the lounge chairs.
Of course, I must finally thank Brian, the cultural and tourism officer who provided attentive service online throughout the entire process. I look forward to next time~

I like the small courtyard in the room very much. The hotel garden landscape is pleasing to the eye. I also saw small squirrels and big snails. The most important thing is that I was lucky enough to take pictures of the orange sea at sunset. In addition, the breakfast at the Silk Road Restaurant is worthy of praise. One bowl of the large beef Bao Luo Noodles every day is not enough. The latte will be served with latte art made by a beautiful lady. I have already tried the coconut jelly and Hainanese chicken rice in the Thai restaurant. They taste very good. Great. It's a pity that I only stayed for two nights and didn't eat more. I will come again next time I have the opportunity. I must try the Chinese restaurant then~

msg:I have been to Sanya several times. I used to stay at Ritz, with the price included in the Huahai Pavilion. This is my first time staying at Capella.
Without spoiling too much, everyone deserves it yyds
The room is so beautiful. If I had a villa, I would have it in this style.
The garden landscape is so beautiful that every step leads to a different view. Every step of the way changes the scenery. Every step brings a different view.
PS: There will be a cultural and tourism officer who will add WeChat to provide butler-style service. My cultural and tourism officer is Monica. She will give appropriate reminders of the day’s hotel activity arrangements. Green coconuts and coconut tarts will be delivered that night. It is slightly more warm than strangers and is well-proportioned. Very good

msg:I stayed at Capella for a few days during the off-season, and the experience was really great! I have to say that if you come to Sanya and want to relax in a hotel, you must choose Capella. It will let you feel what it is like to get out of the car and take you to fully immerse yourself in the holiday a**osphere. Jenny, the cultural and tourism officer who received us, is also very professional. The service is enthusiastic and you can contact her for any activities you don’t know how to arrange. It’s really convenient🏝️

The rooms, restaurants, gardens, and beaches are all quiet and comfortable. The staff are polite and willing to greet you. The breakfast was great and I was asked if I had any special needs and made them individually. The ingredients in the Chinese restaurant are of high quality. Unfortunately, I didn’t try the Western restaurant because it was closed. I didn’t like the Thai food so I didn’t go there. The pick-up and drop-off was on time and the driver was very friendly. Thanks to Krystal, the cultural and tourism officer, for providing us with high-quality services throughout the entire trip. My wife was very satisfied with this trip and decided to stay at Capella next year.

Advantages: 1. Brian, the cultural and tourism officer, added WeChat the day before check-in, informed some hotel information and asked about needs. During the stay, he provided enthusiastic service and provided children's toiletries. Basically, everything was answered ~
2. The guy at the front desk upgraded the room type for free during the off-season. Thank you ~
3. The environment is beautiful, there are few people, the photos are beautiful, the beach is relatively delicate, you can pick up shells in the morning~
4. We had a drop-off at the airport, which was very convenient. The journey took about 50 minutes. The driver was very stable~
5. Since the flight took off in the afternoon, we were given a late check-out, which was very user-friendly~
Disadvantages: 1. Some facilities are very old.
2. The bottled water provided to guests is the kind of recycled glass bottles. To be honest, I really don’t know what kind of water is in it. Whether it is clean or not depends on the conscience of the hotel.
3. The control switches of hotel lighting fixtures are strange
4. Service levels vary

Super satisfied in every aspect; especially brondan's service is particularly good.

The hotel has a large area, complete facilities (for both men, women and children), numerous staff, and attentive service. All trips within the hotel are provided by free sightseeing buses, so you no longer have to worry about rain and scorching sun;

There are so many activities in the hotel, the morning wake-up ceremony is full of rituals, the breakfast is so rich that it is impossible to eat it, the free afternoon tea is full of energy, and the night-time ceremony in the evening is filled with free wine, it is so comfortable;

The hotel also offers a variety of choices such as Chinese, Western, and Thai food, all of which taste delicious. The seaside scenery is clean and beautiful, with many coconut trees, giving it a full sense of vacation. In the evening, you can also watch the spectacular scene of fishermen collecting fish, which is quite nice. !

The bedding is even more comfortable, and you can fall asleep instantly while lying on the bed! ! Come again next time

msg:Hello! Hello! Check in at Capella Sanya Hotel for honeymoon trip!
I stayed here for three nights in total and my overall feeling is as follows:
On the first day when we arrived at the hotel from the airport, "my housekeeper" was waiting for us at the door! She is a very caring and lovely girl, and her name is also very cute. Her name is "Rebecca" and she lives up to her name, "Sunny and beautiful!"
The hotel is like a hidden resort! There are very few people. I really like this feeling. There is no need to wait for check-in! (This is the key point) After checking in, we followed Rebecca's introduction and walked to the room assigned to us. Our room was room 5205 on the second floor of "Qiu Mansion". It was well lit and ventilated. It had two large balconies and was very comfortable (although those few It was raining) I didn’t fully appreciate the chairs on the two large balconies hahahaha! But it does not affect the final effect! There is also 24-hour room service no matter how late you are! I stayed three nights and I ate three nights! How delicious can you imagine! Then when I walked into the room door, the first thing I saw was the "cloth" entrance. The other side of the entrance is the bed. To be honest, I don't like this very much. I can't accept the feeling that when the room door opens, there is a bed. Other than that, Another thing is that the toilet is not automatic and the toilet seat is very cold when you sit on it! Especially getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom can really wake you up! Then, it takes two days to familiarize yourself with the light/curtain buttons in the room. I personally feel that they are not easy to operate. The above points are what I don’t like very much. You can refer to them~
Closer to home, I made a reservation for Thai food at the restaurant included in the hotel, SabaiSabai, on the same day! It’s so delicious. It really breaks my understanding of curry. The vinegary tom yum soup is really delicious! Sour, spicy and so appetizing! And the Boston lobster yellow curry is really delicious and goes well with rice. You can eat it straight into a bowl of rice and slurp it with your fingers! I really recommend it! (I ate at this restaurant twice during my three-day stay!) Real-name recommendation!
This is my favorite and the interior of their hotel is a bit like a tropical rainforest. It is very beautiful. There are dedicated people who are responsible for maintaining the plants and trees here every day. There are also people who clean up the fallen leaves day after day! This made me feel the attentiveness of this hotel. They didn't forget to say hello to the guests when they were busy with the work at hand. It made people feel very friendly! It really means that the design concept of the entire hotel is very unique. It has a dense yet spacious feeling. It is so beautiful. I really like it!
Rebecca was very attentive and asked us every day if we needed help making reservations for afternoon tea or lunch and dinner. The most important thing was that we were always available! The reply speed is very fast, almost within seconds. I really like this! Because when a guest comes to you for something but can't find it, it really makes people feel a lot worse. I'm not sure about other people in the Capella Hotel, but at least my Rebecca is such a good, thoughtful and considerate service attitude. I think he is the best hotel housekeeper I have ever encountered. He is attentive and helpful when encountering problems.
My suggestion is that if you don’t like an environment with many people, you can choose Capella. It’s suitable for people who can meditate. Hahahaha. Although the land is a bit on the edge, there is the scenery because they mainly have low-rise villas. Of course, there are also high-rise buildings. The beach scenery is a little inferior in comparison, but the scenery inside the hotel is honestly very good! What’s more, the service inside is unprecedented! Really suitable hotel for traveling and vacation! What I mean is very simple. When you go on vacation, you should find a comfortable place to vacation, rather than check in at the so-called "Internet celebrity hotel"! As someone who has been there, I really don’t think “Internet celebrity hotels” are suitable for vacations! truth! Big truth!
Although this stay is basically cloudy and rainy, it does not affect it. I just hope that I can stay in the villa area next time I have the opportunity! If I come to Sanya again, I will definitely go back to Capella Hotel!
Rebecca looks forward to our next meeting! I will bring my son next time!

The perfect two-night panoramic king-size bed suite, the experience is very nice❤️
The layout of the room arranges every detail reasonably, and the panoramic balcony can also sit and slow time with family members🌞
The hotel's service is very considerate and there is a minibus for pick-up and drop-off throughout the journey
Cultural tourism officer Krystal is always available to solve problems for guests
I really like the hotel's Thai restaurant🍴. The dishes have a special taste, and every bite is full of meaning. The Thai restaurant is located next to the swimming pool, swimming in the evening is not exposed to the sun, and the water temperature is very warm.
The hotel's breakfast has to be praised, not only the taste is good, but also Chinese, Western, Japanese and other breakfasts.
The adventure park is suitable for children to have fun. There are colorful activities every day and every time period. There is also a children's playground next door.
The beach with sea view 🏝️ must come and experience it in person
Very lucky to meet a super beautiful sunset
The best seaside hotel in China in my impression😄

The hotel's breakfast buffet is very good. The bread and desserts inside are really delicious, much better than other hotels I have stayed in before. The edible food is made with care and effort! !
There are dedicated staff to drive you around the hotel, which is very convenient and you won't get lost. 🚗
The room was overall okay, but what impressed me more was the service! ! There may be a little smell when entering the room, maybe because it is at the beach, but the room cleaning staff will clean it up again

msg:Capella’s 💯 experience

Because I was celebrating an anniversary with my boyfriend, I told the hotel in advance to give us a room with better visibility. To our surprise, the cultural and tourism officer Daisy upgraded our room and prepared two coconuts for us as welcome fruit.
We arrived at the hotel at around 3 o'clock, and the afternoon tea could already begin. We found a circular seat outside and drank afternoon tea in a wild environment. It was really beyond the ordinary.
The hotel's nightfall ceremony begins around 6 o'clock, and there are a variety of drinks to choose from. The sun is setting at this time, so going to the bar terrace is a perfect location to take photos. At the same time, there will be a session to share the story of the Silk Road, and special drinks will be prepared for everyone present. After the story is explained, there will be the most interesting session of mixing your own drinks. Daisy, the cultural and tourism officer, also took photos for us.
When we returned to the room, we were even more surprised to find that the cultural and tourism officer Daisy had prepared mosquito repellent spray for us, the turndown had been prepared, and drinking water was carefully provided on both sides of the table.
After a short rest, we went to the hotel's spa location, visited the gym, and soaked in the bubble pool for a while. I really felt my body relax.
There were a lot of activities that could be booked for the next day, but because we were in a hurry and left early, the cultural and tourism officer Daisy carefully prepared a small gift for us, which was a beach bag sold at the spa. This trip experience was really great. It's a perfect score.

From the room to the battery carts in various functional areas, there is a seamless connection. Customers’ reasonable or unreasonable needs are basically met one by one. Especially when we forgot to bring our facial mask, aloe vera gel was prepared for us! Highly praise the butler Dean Huang. Overall, first-class hardware and top-notch team!

Thanks to my friend for recommending the Fairy Hotel to me
Hotel pick-up with my butler Justin
Helped us make upgrades in advance before check-in
Linghai Pavilion Garden View👉🏻👉🏻👉🏻Yitian Pavilion Deluxe Sea View
	
My favorite thing is the beach in front of the outdoor swimming pool🏖️
The sand is very fine and soft, and the lawn can be photographed casually without the need to adjust the color. The landscaping in the hotel is full of surprises, various fountains, lawns and pools ⛲️🌴🌅🐚... It looks really comfortable , Bashi~
The overall look is very low-key but luxurious hotel style
And the bedding in the room is finally not white😍
Dark gray really looks more comfortable🤓
	
Secondly, the housekeeper and customer service basically responded in seconds and were really considerate. They asked us about what time they would pick us up before we arrived, helped us with our luggage, and helped us book a restaurant for the evening in advance. [Disappointed R ]I really have a lot of things to do
After a while, my phone ran out of battery and I was asked to take it back to my room to charge it🪫
If he has an early flight and is too late to have breakfast, he will pack it in advance and leave it at the door🥡
Then I left something at the hotel and sent it to me via SF Express that afternoon📦
	
⚠️The only bad thing is that I feel extremely dry when I wake up...

During the four days we stayed here, we really felt like we were far away from the troubles of the world and felt the joy brought to us by the little stars! Even when we were checking out, the staff and the cultural and tourism officer took care of every detail of us. When we checked in, we got a surprise room upgrade. The amenity was Mulan Qinxia from Fumaer. I really liked it! Thank you very much to all the staff at Capella. It is said that in a luxury hotel, public areas are important, and the public areas of Capella are like the ceilings of Hainan! There are too many good words to write down all. I hope we will meet again soon! ps Specially recommend sabaisabai and Lanting restaurants which are worth trying!

Jenny, the cultural and tourism officer, has thoughtful service. Every hotel staff is very enthusiastic and responsible for children. I used to think that Capella was not a family hotel for children to play. After that, I booked the trip at Yanlord Crown. Now I am on the bed at Yanlord Crown and regret that I did not spend these three days. To Capella! Whether it's a couple's vacation or a family or business trip, Capella is really great and comfortable.

I forgot my clothes at my seat during the meal, and the girl Rika from the restaurant even brought them to me, which was great. Extra points are provided for late meals during your stay.

It can be seen that the maintenance of greening and facilities and hardware is also very careful. The maintenance of room facilities is okay, and towels and the like are relatively new.
The beach and sea of ​​the hotel are very quiet. It is not easy to have such a place with few people in Sanya during summer vacation.
There is nothing to eat near the hotel, so three meals a day are basically provided by the hotel. The overall breakfast is still very good, but compared to four years ago, the whole coconut was missing. Back then, breakfast was eaten with coconuts. The restaurant for dinner is also okay, Lanting is still at the same level as before, the Thai restaurant has a lot of food, and the taste is also good.
But the afternoon tea is indeed incomparable with the past. The afternoon tea was also free (the penultimate photo is the afternoon tea that opened not long ago four years ago). It is a complete package and the product is very good. The current afternoon tea is really free. , It's really tasteless (the last photo) I don't have any appetite, and it's terrible to eat.
In addition, the minibar has shrunk severely, and the free drink is only a bottle of unpalatable ginger drink. And two cans of Copic chips. Other free drinks can only be drunk in the living room before 6 pm. Back then the minibar gave a bunch of free snacks and drinks.
The service of the hotel staff is good, especially the housekeeper Monica, who is very attentive and responsive, and will remind you in the group when there are certain events!

The service is really good, considerate and thoughtful. Answered our various questions, reminded us of activities we could book, and helped us solve all the problems related to the airport drop-off on the last day, which made our trip to Sanya a perfect ending. Thank you very much Brandon!
Next, let me praise the hotel. It is worthy of being the top hotel in Sanya. Whether it’s the environment, facilities, or services, I give you full marks!
It is said that our room type is very popular, and it is indeed a great value for money after moving in. The room is clean and comfortable, and there is a small courtyard right outside the door, where two people can sit comfortably on chairs, drink tea and enjoy the scenery. The facilities in the house are also very good. Water is bottled in recyclable glass bottles and each guest is provided with a pair of flip-flops. It is really considerate and reflects their environmental protection concept in every detail.
Whether it is the coach at the tennis court, the claw machine lady at the adventure park, or everyone at the restaurant or bar, they all smile and serve patiently. And it's not the kind of service that I only provide when I need it, but always observe and take the initiative to ask. I think this is really great!
Finally, I would like to share the most impressive experience we participated in, Spice Life, which was really interesting. Personally experience the taste of various spices, from selecting materials, grinding, mixing, to bottling, it is a very participatory experience. You can also package it and take it home. Finally, you can experience the fun of opening a blind box at home. It is really as full of unknowns as life. surprise!
I sincerely recommend Capella to everyone! I hope everyone can experience it! Won't regret it!

msg:Before I arrived in Sanya, Capella's butler Justin had already contacted me and added me on WeChat. He learned that I was going to Capella as the first stop of my honeymoon trip and prepared flowers and cakes for me on the day I checked in.
In addition to the first-line sea view, Capella Hotel has warm and thoughtful service. The breakfast is rich and delicious. They also arranged travel photography for me and sent me five photos and a video. The main hotel is so beautiful that every photo taken by me is a blockbuster. This is also the case at the moment. Among the five-star hotels I have stayed in in China, it is the only one that I would like to stay at again next time. It is worthy of being one of the top ten luxury hotel brands in Asia.

After learning about it, Brandon, the cultural and tourism officer, promptly and efficiently helped to upgrade and solve the problem. He also reminded timely about the time of various activities.

But there is one thing I can't stand. Since the hotel occupies a large area, sometimes the hotel's club car is needed to pick up and drop off if the journey is a little longer. However, the efficiency of the club car in the hotel is too low. It is obvious that there are not enough cars. The average waiting time is at least Ten minutes, and once I even waited 20 minutes for the bus to arrive.

The beach was clean and almost no people around, which was great. It’s just that the waves are very big.
The swimming pool is also very good, the rest area is full of details, the curved lounge chair design is very detailed.
The breakfast is amazing, with many varieties. Although there are not many customers now, it still maintains the reputation of Capella. The hot and sour noodles recommended by the chef are so delicious! ! ! !

This hotel upgraded to a sea view room, which was an unexpected surprise, and even gave me a souvenir. Services at all latitudes are quite good. grateful.

msg:This time I spent thousands of dollars to stay at Capella, which is really full of interesting things. Let’s listen to the next one:
1. Before I checked in, I went back on my word on hotel room arrangements, was dishonest, and caused trouble for others. Before I checked in, the cultural and tourism officer sent me a message on WeChat to ask if I had any needs, so I told her to reserve a room with a sea view on the 9th floor. I readily agreed at the time, but on the second day, she made excuses and told me that I couldn't arrange it. At first, she said that the room was under maintenance. He also said that the hotel is full, how can you keep the hearts of guests in such a dishonest hotel?
2. The privacy of the room is poor. Standing on the balcony, you can see the balconies of the neighbors on the left and right, and you can see indoors if you lean forward a little. The toiletries in the room are actually packed in large bottles!
3. After checking in, I went to the main swimming pool for a swim at 8 pm. As soon as I arrived at the pool, I was told in a harsh warning tone by the pool attendant in red that the pool was only open until 10 o'clock. After swimming for a while, I became thirsty. There were water jars by the pool, but there were no cups. I asked the waiter for a cup and told me that the restaurant had not brought it to me. When I asked him what to do, he replied: He doesn’t know either! Is this the service and attitude a big hotel should have?
3. What refreshed my understanding the most was the male manager of Silk Road Restaurant. We went to have afternoon tea in the afternoon, and a staff member came to ask me about my feelings and opinions about the meal. I truthfully reported the types of tea. Too little, and the quality and presentation will not look good. In less than 2 minutes, the restaurant manager rushed over to me like a hedgehog and told me politely but rudely: This meal is just a free snack included in the room rate. If you want to eat a wide variety of delicious food, you have to spend 888 yuan. Go buy it. It's simply too unreasonable and lack of quality. It means that you can only give selected suggestions. If you put forward any suggestions, you will be attacked unreasonably. Is there such a way for guests to make suggestions? Didn't the teacher teach him to correct it and encourage him if he doesn't? Besides, we consumers also pay for the meals included in the room, so can we just deal with it as casually as we do in a big cafeteria? Please ask this manager not to despise the guests with the idea of ​​bullying them, because they are the source of income on which you rely. At the same time, I also want to ask Capella, is this the way your hotel treats guests? It’s incredible that someone with such qualities can be a restaurant manager!
In short, Capella Hotel is only the ceiling of hotel prices in Sanya. As for other aspects, it deserves it!

msg:The price of Capella Tufu Bay Hotel is the highest in Hainan. After staying here this time, I feel that the experience is worth the money.
The day before check-in, the butler Brian added my WeChat account and inquired about my check-in time and needs the next day, and provided various hotel rituals and catering information, which was very considerate.
The hotel's location is relatively remote, about ten minutes' drive from Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop. After arriving at the hotel, the hotel staff enthusiastically helped us with our luggage and guided us to check in. After completing the check-in, the housekeeper Brian also enthusiastically took us to our room.
As a hotel opened in 19, it is quite new. The room is 88 square meters, which is basically the size of other hotel suites. There is also a TV in the bathtub area, which is quite good. The only shortcoming is that the hair dryer is not Dyson, and the spare parts are They are all packed in big bottles. The cleaning was good and the bedding was very soft and comfortable. It was the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on.
There are many rituals in the hotel. After participating in the afternoon meal, we went to the beach for a stroll. The afternoon passed quickly.
Dined at the hotel's Western restaurant in the evening. The environment and food were very good.
After finishing the meal, I went to swim in the hotel's swimming pool. I felt that the hotel's swimming pool was not very distinctive compared to other hotels of the same level. I got up after playing for a while.
The breakfast the next day was very rich and tasted very good.
The most outstanding thing about this hotel is its garden. It was built very beautifully regardless of cost. You won't feel bored walking around it for a day.
The hotel's service should be the most commendable thing. Every waiter will greet you warmly when they see you. The butler Brian also enthusiastically helped us with our questions and needs. When leaving the hotel, he also gave us exquisite souvenirs. Although It was only a short two days and one night, but it was definitely an unforgettable journey.

The public swimming pool is basically no one in the pool at noon, and I played water basketball with my son for more than an hour. There is afternoon tea provided every day, and it is served according to the number of customers. If there is not enough, you can take more, but basically there is a lot ,Dinner can be enjoyed at the beach on Friday and Saturday. If it rains, you can go indoors. Fortunately, we made a reservation on the first night of Friday. Otherwise, it will rain heavily the next day and cancel the outside of the beach. We can only eat in the western restaurant. After dinner that night, we had an impromptu game of beach soccer with our son. Every day is impromptu and random...do what you want, don't make a schedule, don't rush the schedule, this is the only way to go on vacation🏖

When we checked out, the hotel’s cultural and tourism officer also gave us a small gift, which contained a canvas bag, fisherman’s hat and starfish, very friendly to children, we will choose Capella next time🏨

Facilities: Every item has a sense of design, including the logo, which is very foreign
Hygiene: I can't find any faults, I can't even see the fallen leaves in the swimming pool.
Environment: The a**osphere of the whole hotel is so good that you don’t want to leave the hotel. There are only things you can’t think of and nothing you can’t find in the hotel. You can shoot anytime you want, even if it’s an inconspicuous corner. It’s really beautiful.
Service: I really want this service to blow my mind. When I didn’t check in, there was a cultural and tourism officer who asked me about my preferences and requirements in advance, and I even talked with the group. The room is messy, but every time I go back, it feels like I’m staying in a new room. The littered clothes will be folded neatly and the messy makeup brushes will be tidied up for me. I’m really moved to the point of crying. Wow, every staff is very polite. Smile and say hello, there is a small gift when you check out, it really blows up the service~ Enjoy my blockbuster~
Exclusive daily spending credit worth RMB 500 can be used for in-store dining and spa consumption: it can be stacked and used very good
There is also a pick-up and drop-off service to the ceiling!

What attracts me the most about the hotel is the design of the hotel, the style of Chinese heritage, walking in the hotel, people can stop everywhere. The privacy of the hotel is very good. I live in Leshuiju, which is very quiet. The room is large and the bedding is very good.
Hotel service: After check-in, the butler added WeChat in time, and responded to every request, thank you very much. The room service is also great, and will help to set up the tableware.
Hotel catering: The hotel's buffet breakfast, in Sanya hotels, I think it is quite satisfactory, the restaurant service is online, and it will help to take the seat and collect the meal tray in time. Chinese restaurant: Compared with the price, the dishes are not outstanding, which is not bad. Thai restaurant: service online.
Disadvantages: The beach feels that the management is not very good, there are many private projects, and the management of hotel access is not strict. Sanitation in public areas needs to be strengthened. There is a puddle of water at the door of the room, and no one has come to clean it. The service of the hotel shuttle bus staff needs to be improved.
I hope that the next time you stay, you can reflect the uniqueness of Capella.

msg:Capella Hotel is a butler-style service, and Krystal, the cultural travel officer, has a strong sense of service. The overall design of the hotel is good, the lobby design is unique, and the room design is very bright. Home decoration can be used for reference. The first disadvantage is that the room has a musty smell. I researched it, and it should be the wood used at that time, and it may not be moisture-proof wood. The weather in Sanya is relatively humid, so the room is prone to musty smell. The second is the beach shoes used in hotels, which are too difficult to wear. A pair of more than a dozen yuan online is particularly easy to wear. It is recommended that they be replaced uniformly. The third is that the level of the hotel's Chinese restaurant is really not flattering, and the essence of Huaiyang cuisine has not been grasped. The braised beef tastes like braised pork! It is suggested that the chef can be arranged to go to Jiangnan to study with his class for a period of time. After tasting the dishes of several online celebrity restaurants in Sanya, the chefs in Sanya did not grasp the essence of Huaiyang cuisine as a whole. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast in this hotel is really good, and the environment is also very good, especially the Hainan dross vinegar is very delicious. Personally, I think the sanitation of the restaurant can be improved. The overall sanitation management requirements of Jinling Hotel are still good, and it is worth learning from.

The hotel's Thai food is very authentic, and there are discounts. It is also a good deal for more than 600 for three people. The hotel's breakfast coffee is great, the food variety is too complete, the room is large, and the bed in the double room is big enough. btw the cleaning lady of the hotel likes it very much. It has a very high-end woody fragrance. The bedding is also very comfortable. Justin, the cultural tourism officer, was very nice. Not only did he help with restaurant reservations, but he also delayed the check-out time. Basically responsive. Every staff member is also greeted with a smile. This is the attitude that the ceiling should have. In short, the experience of staying this time is very pleasant, and I will choose Capella next time I come to Sanya!

There are many shaded lounge chairs on the shore, and water, bath towels and water toys are provided; The small swimming pool is for little babies, there are water slides, mini, but it is also very fun; ④Room: We booked the Leshuiju Suite, because the room was not cleaned at 3 o'clock, we were upgraded to a one-bedroom villa with a swimming pool, too lucky. The oversized bathtub in the room is so cool, the snack bar in the room is also super large, equipped with capsule coffee machine, Dyson hair dryer; ⑤ Service: Jenny from the hotel, a tall and beautiful big beauty, has warm and patient service, added WeChat, and can be used whenever needed Ask her, she will answer every question; I also gave a small gift when I checked out: the hotel's fisherman hat and water bottle, the texture is very good; ⑥ Restaurant: The hotel is equipped with three restaurants. We ate at the Thai restaurant and visited the Chinese restaurant. There is also a western restaurant that I did not see. Breakfast until 11 o'clock, and free afternoon tea at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, which is very rich; ⑦ Disadvantage: When the hotel's battery car picks up and picks up guests, some drivers are unwilling to pull them. They are all customers to be served. Because we waited in the lobby for a long time and there was no car, one came and hurried up, the driver’s car was already open, and he said that he had to pick up other people, it’s best not to go, it’s quite boring; the hotel needs a lot of service awareness Training; ⑧Suggestion: If you want to stay in multiple hotels during this trip, don’t stay in Capella first, otherwise there will be a psychological gap. When I switched from Capella to Banyan Tree, I was so depressed that the gap was too great. I hope to have the opportunity to stay at Capella next time and continue the wonderful experience!

msg:A comfortable and comfortable vacation is provided by Capella 🤩
1. Before arriving at the hotel, Brian, our cultural tourism officer, got in touch with me and created a group. He sent us the hotel's activities and menus to let us know in advance. The whole check-in process only needs to leave a message in the group, which is very convenient and fast.

2. The environment of the hotel is very private, and there is a desire to make films. At the same time, there are many activities for children. We played "Building Bird's Nest", "Weaving Li Rope" and "Sand Painting". The club is so much fun that I don’t want to leave😄

3. The hotel has the hygienic standards and bedding that a five-star hotel should have, and the fragrance of the toiletries is very pleasant. The decoration is high-end and tasteful, which is obviously different from the two thousand or so hotels in Haitang Bay. Yanlord Atlantis Haitang Bay and Capella have both been in business for several years, and moderate aging of facilities (such as slightly worn carpets) seems to be a common problem. Capella's shower room is small, and the nozzle is flushing at an angle 🚿

4. The service is what impresses me the most. In addition to the good assistant Brian, the hotel from the front desk, restaurant waiters, battery car waiters to the cleaning and other service workers encountered on the road greeted with a smile, he/they are neatly dressed and wear make-up to go to work, they look very professional. One of the days I stayed at the hotel was my little friend's birthday. After I informed in advance, the hotel prepared a small cake to add to the fun. It was very nice! After checking out in the morning, the staff will accompany you out and ask guests for their opinions along the way, which shows the emphasis on service quality.

5. The hotel's free afternoon tea is very 🉑️, it is not the same every day, and it is not the same as the breakfast dessert.

This year, Haitang Bay has clearly felt that all the hotels are working hard to improve their service levels and value guest reviews. The unit price of Capella is high in Sanya, but the three-night stay proves to be worth the money, so if the budget is enough, just go!

Hope our beautiful Sanya is getting better and better! There are more high-standard hotels that can become Sanya's business card.

The breakfast really suits my appetite. The salads are divided into different categories, with or without sauce, which is very friendly to people who lose weight! Dross vinegar Baoluo powder is also delicious! Every detail is very special! Slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste were delivered in time on the first night of stay. Compared with Edison, the children still love Capella. They love the Thai restaurant here! This is the first choice for future vacations.

msg:The room was generally hygienic and the carpet was not very clean. The service was very poor. I had to wait for nearly an hour and a half to check into the room after checking in. The hotel's pick-up and drop-off by battery car all depends on fate. Five minutes after contacting the pick-up, we had to wait for the food to go out. We were exposed to the sun outdoors and waited for more than ten minutes without a car. Passing cars waved and ignored us. Staying for two nights, the hotel's cleanliness was very perfunctory on the second day. The complimentary soft drinks were only available on the first day and would not be replenished no matter how long the stay was. If there is a need, the hotel's response time is extremely slow, complaints are useless, and they cover each other up. Spend money to buy a model of anger. I don’t want to go there anymore, I can’t match his price at all, just stay away from lightning.

It's very nice.

This is something I like very much.
Enjoy sumptuous mini bar snacks and soft drinks (updated daily): What makes me happy is the gift tonic water configured by the hotel, because I am really picky about drinking, and the hotel’s intentions can be seen from the details
When leaving, because it was a morning flight, Dean, the cultural tourism officer, specially arranged for someone to come over to give a souvenir. Capella accompanied him warmly along the way, marking a perfect end to the journey. Thank you Dean for your enthusiasm and professionalism, Capella is perfect.

I have never seen a hotel in this price range with such a musty smell. I really don't understand where all the good reviews come from. Coming from Park Hyatt, there is no comparison with Park Hyatt. The carpet was also very dirty.

However, no one added me when I checked in the next day. Secondly, there were no service staff in the hotel. In addition, the facilities in the room also showed signs of peeling paint, cracked walls, and the socket on one side was also peeling off. I started urging people to check out at 12:18 the next day. On the other hand, although it was overcrowded when I stayed at the Edition No one came to urge us to check out until three o'clock. I hope it can be improved! Worth the price

msg:First of all, I was very lucky. After waiting for 1-2 hours at check-in, I was really lucky 💗 I upgraded the C single-family villa-Dongfu~ super value experience. . Let me talk about my regrets... The most regrettable part is: the snacks in the afternoon from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock are super delicious, especially a kind of glutinous rice cake with pumpkin cake and coconut paste... Unfortunately, I only ate it for 1 day 😢😂 I really want to go again Eat... I didn't eat it on the second day and when I left. I remembered the time wrong. I went to the bar to remind me that it was time. I was speechless to myself. I really spent time... The best hotel It is to create a dream-making space for users｜~~ After playing for too long, I almost forget the time...
1. Thank you monica, the service is very considerate, and the reply is very timely~ I even sent a cake. 2. Thanks to the girl who was in charge of the night ceremony cocktails. She made the cocktails herself. She just briefly asked me what I like to drink every day. I said red wine, and then arranged for a bottle of red wine~ 3. The breakfast was relatively good, not so rich. No 🦐, shrimp dumpling, carrot juice, Wenchang Baoluo powder are delicious 😋 4. Sweat steaming in the spa + igloo must be experienced. I have done it twice, and the skin has tightened a lot~~ This trip is worth it, and it is also worth it I experienced the yoga class and got to know Anna~~ 5. Tai Chi in the morning ☯️ was very artistic, and ⭕️ is really a designer's work.
6. It was planned to stay in Anyu for another night during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. Fortunately, I chose Capella for 2 nights. I saw a good picture of anyu on the Internet, so I went to Anyu in the middle of my trip to Duty Free City. I wanted to see if it was worth staying in Sanya next time~ I went to look at it and persuaded me to leave: no visits, no entry into Anyu Lawn, the waiter It really scared me~ Fortunately, I didn’t choose anyu this time😂 It’s the first time I’ve seen such a bad hotel that turned me away. Fortunately, there is Capella to heal my injuries~~

It’s really not necessary to go out of the hotel to stay here🏨 It’s no problem to play for 5 days, come again in winter~
Disadvantages: It is a pity that when the hotel was under construction, too little was reserved for the external environment. I felt that the residence next door was too close to other projects. If there is a little sense of distance, there is no space left~~ There is a little sense of wild luxury, abroad The "less crowded" feeling of being isolated and independent in the resort is a bit less...
The overall experience is great, although it is a little more expensive than Park Hyatt 🤏 but it is worth spending more money plus price. I was also worried that it would be very noisy without the Park Hyatt Sunny Bay Independent Beach (unfortunately it is also very noisy now). But Capella is really quiet, the beach is okay, there are not many charging items as others have said, it is normal to have some small activities.

msg:An Unforgettable Trip to Capella Sanya
First of all, I would like to thank our cultural tourism officer Justin for his meticulous and patient solution to all our questions in a timely manner. In order to make us feel a better staying experience, Justin helped us upgrade the room type, from the garden view room to the Leshuiju in Chunfu.
Justin, the cultural tourism officer, and his colleagues asked us about the situation of the occupants in advance, and presented welcome fruits and cute desserts with the children's nicknames. According to our preferences, we arranged a garden-view room on the first floor (the scenery is super beautiful), and the window looks like an oil painting. And all the children's products (bed fence, toiletries) are carefully prepared for the children.
After learning that the child has the habit of drinking milk before going to bed, he thoughtfully prepared a large box of milk for us.
The breakfast at the Silk Road Restaurant is open until 11:00, with a wide variety, suitable for the appetite of the whole family. Children especially like the seafood porridge for breakfast. Iced American + various powder is my favorite.
There are four free children's activity classes every day. The course arrangement is reasonable, and the service staff are enthusiastic and meticulous. We have experienced: coconut leaf weaving, water mist magic beads, stone painting, etc. There is also a small chef activity (making small biscuits or pizza, etc.) for a fee of 188/time
The full-time living room bar provides unlimited free non-alcoholic soft drinks and fruits from 11:00-18:00.
Every day from 15:00 to 16:00 Silk Road Restaurant has free afternoon tea (the types are basically fixed)
In the past few days, I have experienced two restaurants of Capella - Lanting Chinese Restaurant and Western Restaurant. The overall feeling is that Chinese food is more to our appetite. There is also a set meal of 888 yuan on Father's Day. The dishes are large and the cooking is exquisite.
All the staff of Capella are warm and professional in service, and it really feels like home here.
The soft power of the hotel's humanistic services is superb, and the hardware facilities are also very good.
The spa and gym are very recommended, there are few people and quiet, so you can relax.
Looking forward to meeting here next time.

The breakfast highly recommended by my friend is indeed the best in all the high-end hotels I have stayed in. There are many varieties, and the Hainan Baoluo powder is super delicious😋.

One day in advance, Justin, the cultural tourism officer, added WeChat and sent us hotel inquiries and event introductions, which made it easier for us to arrange the itinerary in advance, and helped me coordinate the time for travel photography. The overall service is warm and thoughtful!
The hotel's scenery is great. The water curtain in the lobby is really beautiful. The beach is also very good. Every step is a scene, and every angle is suitable for taking pictures~
Afternoon time is afternoon tea by table. To be honest, I was surprised. The portion is quite large and the taste is very good😋 Especially the coffee in the hotel is delicious. Every time I go to the restaurant, I can’t help but have a cup of latte. Coffee stars love it ~
There are also a lot of options for breakfast. I recommend a bowl of noodles with dregs and vinegar soup. The soup is delicious~
Last but not least, the small gift when I checked out was a canvas bag with the hotel logo, which was very beautiful and easy to wear. I attached the last photo at Wanning Beach. I couldn’t help but get it and use it~
I look forward to staying at Capella next time I go to Sanya!

But as far as parents and children are concerned, it is not very suitable. You need a battery car to get in and out, which is not very convenient. Stayed for two days and tried Chinese and Western restaurants. The price is expensive, but the taste is also good.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Freya, the cultural tourism officer, for everything I did for my parents' 40th wedding anniversary. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we drove our family to tour the hotel's facilities, and upgraded the room type, which greatly increased the experience. There are cards with blessings, and the most surprising thing is that children are also given children's gifts. The booked activities and the three major ceremonies of the hotel reminded us to participate in time. They also sent gifts when we saw off and welcomed us back next time. Freya, the cultural and travel officer, is very friendly, and he was also the narrator of the night ceremony that night, and taught us how to make cocktails, very thoughtful.
Because I went to Park Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, and EDITION before I came here, I also stayed in more than a dozen other five-star hotels in Sanya, and I also stayed in several five-star hotels such as the Sands Hotel in Singapore, so I want to objectively evaluate Capella Sanya.
1 Capella as a ceiling is actually still underestimated by most people. When I go to the Wang Zha service spa at night, I reserve the venue. The spa occupies a large area of ​​the hotel. The indoor swimming pool is full of design and almost no one is there. I play at the bar at night. The venue is reserved, and the level of Ukrainian singers has reached the level of first-line concerts in Europe and America, so most of the guests have only experienced half of the essence of Capella, or even only one-third of it.
2 The Capella living room of the night ceremony is very good. It brings guests together. It feels like they are not staying in a hotel, but attending a high-end party at a reception
3 The attitude towards the guests should first look at the attitude of Capella towards the employees. After the Tai Chi ceremony in the morning, some employees will bring water to the Tai Chi master. It is impossible for a hotel that treats its employees well to provide poor service. The problem is that there are a few hotels in China that make employees feel happy. The staff who teach fishing obviously enjoy the job, let alone the hotel guests.
4 High cost performance, the spa service alone is unmatched in China, not to mention other free afternoon tea, mini bar, reception activities and so on. It's like staying in a hotel of 3,000 and giving 4,000 in kind of gold.
5 No exposure to the sun, it is very important in Hainan. Capella does a very good job. There are shades of trees everywhere, many places have air conditioning, and there are places to replenish water. Only when you actually play can you know how important it is to avoid the sun.
6 Not to mention the design, the master is the master, but unfortunately most hotel guests cannot appreciate the exquisite design, just like the Chinese people are not used to the Western-style part of the breakfast, a lot of advantages are ignored because of the quality of the residents. Just like many people said that Jack Ma was a liar in the early days, his own structure could not understand the beauty of the hotel's design.
Let me talk about a shortcoming. The bathroom is hard to find and there is a distance from the restaurant. Some employees are not familiar with the hotel and cannot ask for directions.

The seven-star hotel I stayed in for the first 2 nights can’t be compared. I come to Sanya for vacation every year. This hotel is the only one I like the most. Krystal’s service is very good and responsive, and the travel photos are also good. The Cantonese cuisine in the Chinese restaurant is of a high standard. Next time I will choose Capella when I come here (^.^)

In terms of design, the building is a step back from the landscape. It is low-key and unobtrusive, but exquisite, and the scenery is cleverly arranged everywhere to present the core of "nature" in the eyes of the residents.
In addition, the most commendable is its caring, excellent and meticulous service, and the residents are cared for and cared for throughout the process.
Our butler Dean started his service the day before check-in. Every day after that, he kept in touch with us, sent his greetings early every day, and took the initiative to care about his plans for the day and what help he needed, and he was responsive to every request.
Xiaoge, who checked us in when we checked in after arrival, was able to get our needs very accurately and make proper arrangements, very considerate!

When we were about to leave, the two little brothers Leo and Lause from the catering depar**ent conveyed Jack's farewell greetings in a very warm way.
In short, this trip to Capella has brought us a very good experience.

The first-line sea view hotels in Haitang Bay, Yalong Bay have basically checked in. The breakfast at Capella is definitely the best. One of the best, the variety is rich, the taste is good, the service is good, the afternoon tea is absolutely acclaimed, and the snacks are very popular with children. I highly recommend the Lanting Chinese restaurant in the hotel. The children's paradise is very good, the children had a great time, and there are PS games for adults with children to play, absolutely! Finally, we would like to give a big compliment to our housekeeper Monica. From the inquiry before check-in to the thoughtful arrangement at check-in, it makes people feel happy and heart-warming. They respond quickly and promptly to small situations that arise during check-in. The children prepared small gifts and were really happy! Compared with the crashing experience of Atlantis later, it is really a heaven and an underground. The soundtrack of Sanya Jia is worth coming again!

When the May 1st flight was delayed for a long time and the mood was extremely low, Wen Hotel would comfort me, because it was already close to the early morning when I checked in at the hotel, and I didn't catch up with the evening ceremony, so I specially sent a bottle of red wine.
I booked a twin room with sea view. The two double beds are the size of a double bed, which is definitely enough for three people. But an adult needs to pay a service fee of 700 a day. It does not include the extra bed fee.
The breakfast room and the spa are two of my favorite places. The rich breakfast can basically be eaten as brunch, and the sauna in the spa center makes people relax physically and mentally.

msg:Monica is very enthusiastic and considerate in service. Because the room was upgraded for free in the off-season, I felt a little cold when I checked in in the afternoon. The beauty immediately asked the kitchen to prepare ginger tea. Drink it and it will be fine. There are free fruit snacks in the room. The hotel is very large, there is a battery car to pick up and drop off, and the sea breeze is comfortable. The room is 88 square meters with complete facilities. Is cocktail a hotel feature? The breakfast was okay, and the check-out was postponed for another 3 hours in the afternoon. Before leaving, I gave small gifts, cloth bags, water bottles, and luggage tags. I visited the snow house sauna massage room, and the gym is good. I personally think the price is a bit expensive, maybe because they don't have many rooms, less people means luxury, you can give it a try.

msg:A very satisfying vacation! Before check-in, the hotel's cultural and tourism manager Monica began to contact, reminding all kinds of travel instructions, and introducing the hotel's activities and various facilities in detail. The check-in procedure was very fast, and we even upgraded to a sea view room! very happy! Apart from alcohol, other soft drinks, potato chips and snacks in the room are free. I really like the glass bottled distilled water in the hotel! During the stay, Monica took great care of her, reminded her to participate in the hotel's three major activities in due course, and gave red wine 🍷 in the evening! Have a heart! I watched the morning ceremony this morning, which was picturesque. When we left the store, we also thoughtfully gave us water, snacks and small gifts on the way, thank you Monica and all the staff! I will come again for vacation when I have time⛱️
fully equipped
Hygiene: very clean

msg:From St. Regis to Atlantis to Edison, and finally to Capella, the overall experience of staying at Capella is quite good. First of all, the breakfast in these restaurants has a relatively rich variety, and the taste is also very delicious. Secondly, the beach in front of the hotel is very clean, and the sea water in Bialong Bay is fine and clear. Finally, the service of the hotel is very good. The butler Monica is very enthusiastic and introduced to us some of the hotel's infrastructure and daily activities in detail. Finally, one last point to add is that although this side is relatively remote, it is not as lively as Yalong Bay. But it is very close to Houhai Village. We drove there for more than 20 minutes. It is still good and worth visiting.

Objectively speaking, there are no commercial facilities around the hotel, but if you just want a clean vacation, Capella has no flaws.

msg:There are too many domestic hotels with good hardware and good scenery, but there are not many hotels with such thoughtful service as Capella. Before departure, Eugene, the cultural and tourism officer of the hotel, confirmed my request for the room by phone and WeChat with me. When I checked in, the bed I requested, the footstool for the sink, etc. were all arranged. Due to the long waiting time for check-in, I was upgraded to a sea view suite ~ the service was very good. In the past few days in the hotel, basically any request will be met. My son refused to go to the breakfast room for breakfast, they packed it up and brought it to my room every day. It stands to reason that the breakfast buffet cannot be packed, but they are very helpful. When I expressed my opinion to the waiter, there was an immediate response. For example, I felt that the breakfast room was a bit hot and the air conditioner was not strong enough. The waiter immediately brought me an air conditioner fan and sent it to my seat, and also sent a large bowl of fruit to my room as compensation.
	
I said the iced tea at the pool bar was too sweet. Send me two bottles of lemon beer instead.
These things are not expensive, but the attitude is good. They can apologize and say yes, we will definitely improve, and the guests have nothing to say. But there are immediate improvement measures that are much more considerate than just being sweet~
	
The hotel is very big, but there are several shuttle buses that cycle around the hotel to pick up and drop off guests, and they will be there in a while. Or just find a waiter and ask him to help call a car, and it will arrive very quickly. And it's actually only 5 minutes to walk to the beach, not too far. There are towels and drinking water by the pool. These details are also very thoughtful.
	
I think Capella is suitable for couples who want to be quiet to relax, and families with young children to go on vacation. If it is something for older children, it is really not as good as Shangri-La and Atlantis. But it is enough for my baby~ Adventure Park also has go-karts, and the unpowered facilities can discharge the baby. Good service is really important, and it makes it easier for old mothers with babies.
	
It's really perfect in non-peak season. In peak season, there are people everywhere. If there are too many people, the facilities and services may also be discounted. But the Capella experience this time is too good, I should bring my baby and mother here for a leisurely vacation for a few days in the future~

msg:Experience｜Top Luxury Capella Resort Hotel

I came here after checking out from the Rosewood Poly Hotel Haitang Bay Sanya. I originally booked another hotel, but many people said that this place is super awesome. I was also admitted by Amway on Xiaohongshu. I made a reservation here directly, and it was a temporary reservation!
Here are the advantages:
1. It is super hidden here, with garden design, Singapore luxury hotel brand, there are only 2 open in China, and the other one is Shanghai Jianyeli Capella. I read online that this hotel has invested 5.5 billion! It’s super beautiful. Any corner here can create a story, and you can shoot a blockbuster movie anywhere. Of course, I hope you try to travel as much as possible, so that all the beautiful scenery belongs to you.
2. The garden is super large. You can call a sightseeing bus when you go out. It is very convenient to go everywhere without being very tired. Generally, the sightseeing bus will take you to the lobby, guest rooms in the main building, villa area, spa center, swimming pool and seaside, etc. And the service is super good. Before we check in, the customer service of the hotel will contact you and create a WeChat account. After checking in, the lobby manager will take you to the room and explain the various locations of the hotel to you along the way. If you have a good chat, you will also enter the hotel WeChat Group, all services in these few days will follow up with you.
3. The swimming pool of this hotel is super big, and the restaurant is also very good. There is a western restaurant called The Dempsey, which costs more than 300 per person. You can order a la carte or a set meal. Those who choose the set meal can go to the beach to watch the sunset! There is also Lanting Chinese food, the ingredients are very particular, suitable for bringing children to eat!
4. There are many activities here every day. From Monday to Sunday, it is full. Children and adults have their own activity lists, and there are many parent-child activities. Children's activities are similar to planting flowers and making small things, and adults' activities include water basketball, tennis, etc., which are very rich!
5. The room facilities of the hotel are super new and modern, it feels a bit like a business hotel, very luxurious! Our lobby manager gave us two upgrades in a row, the 8th floor is very tall and very positive sea view room, it is still beneficial to travel during peak shifts! Of course, the garden room is also good, many people specially come to live in it! The toiletries in the room are super easy to use, I really like the smell!
Here comes the shortcoming:
1. The park always needs to spray some pesticides because of the garden design. I think the smell is quite strong. But to be honest, you still have to spray it, otherwise there will be a lot of bugs, but there will be more bugs if the ecology is good. Haha, I also saw my favorite big lizard with a long tail.
2. Drinking water, glass bottled water, is really high-end, but I am not used to it, I personally don't like it. Because I saw the master who collected mineral water, pouring water on the side of the road, and recycling glass bottles. I don't know if the disinfection will be unclean? However, the hotel will also provide Baisui Mountain mineral water to customers who need it, which I think is still very good!
Special thanks to:
My guest relations hotel lobby manager Fang Yuyi Aria, thank you very much for the service of these two days, and thank you for the small check-out gift! Next time we have a chance, we will come to this hotel with our children!

Freya, the cultural tourism officer before check-in, will inform the hotel of the activities of each time period of the day, and will remind you before each activity, afternoon tea at 3 o'clock, night ceremony at 6 o'clock, red and white wine and special cocktails that are not repeated every day, Sitting at the bar quietly waiting for the sunset, it's so beautiful! If you need to make an appoin**ent, you can talk to the cultural and tourism officer. This wedding anniversary, Freya also helped to upgrade the room and sent a strawberry mousse ❤️ cake. The cake was very delicious and beautiful. This stay was very pleasant and left a deep impression on us. The hotel I met The staff are very nice to say hello, very kind! The only small problem is that there is no elevator from the underground parking lot to the lobby. We dragged the trolley case and walked up the slope. We can inform you in advance about this in the future. You can put your luggage at the hotel entrance before stopping the car, or call a car to pick it up Just a moment

Environment: The environment is really good, there are shells on the beach, the most common words of the two children every day is to catch crabs and dig shells
Service: The attitude of the service staff is very good. The butler Krystal received us and arranged for us a location very close to the lobby, beach, and children's playground, because we need to call a battery car for travel in the hotel, and we shuttle between the lobby and the beach pool many times a day. It is really tiring to call the battery car every time, and Sanya is very sunny, waiting with children is the most annoying. Our location does not need to call a car and it only takes a minute or two to walk by yourself, which is great. There was also a gift after check-out. The two children had a great time. Thank you to every staff member of Capella for bringing us a relaxing and enjoyable journey!
Breakfast: I think breakfast is better than MGM and Tianfang Intercontinental, and the afternoon tea is also good👍

msg:Capella Hotel is known as the ceiling of Sanya hotels. I feel that the receptionist at the front desk has reached the ceiling of arrogance. My real experience after check-in is as follows, for reference for those who want to book a room in the future:
1. Concierge service: 5 stars. The little brother is very enthusiastic, has a good attitude and is professional in reception.
2. Front desk reception: 1 star. The most dissatisfactory part this time was that the receptionist girl was inexplicably impatient. The hotel page indicated that Yitian Pavilion was on the 7th to 9th floors. I also made a special note to arrange for a higher floor, but the front desk only arranged it. The 7th floor is still a room far away from the lobby. I hope it will be arranged closer. The front desk immediately excused you on the grounds that the room closer to the lobby cannot be checked in at the moment, and said that we only arrange permanent guests on the higher floors. This means that we are not qualified to live in the higher floors. Floor, later we found the supervisor, and the nearby rooms were available for occupancy again. It made people feel that the front desk had a little power and would do whatever it wanted. Alas, my mood was ruined before I even checked in...
3. Yitian Pavilion Room: 2 stars. There are aluminum alloy square tube grilles outside the balcony of the room on the 7th floor. Sitting on the sofa on the balcony, the viewing effect is extremely poor. There are grilles everywhere (see picture). There are stains on the carpet in the room. Obviously, the towels (bath towels, square towels) in the room were all stiff and were probably out of service. The bottled water provided in the room had no brand label and was suspected of being packed in large bottles. The bedding and mattress are quite good.
3. Breakfast and afternoon tea: 5 stars. The breakfast is rich and has many categories. The afternoon tea refreshments are provided for each person. Drinks and other water are available for self-service. The restaurant service is completely different from the guest room, which is very good.
4. Lanting Chinese Restaurant: 3 stars, good service, expensive food, average taste.
Based on the above, this hotel is not cost-effective, so please choose carefully.

The charm of escape from the world revealed by Guanxing Pool and Lanting Chinese Restaurant is not out of tune due to the appearance of The Dempsey Poolside Western Restaurant, but complements each other, becoming a mutual achievement of escape from the world and luxury.
Because in Shanghai Jianye, Capella has already experienced the service like "I want to pick the stars for you". Therefore, the impeccable service of Capella in Tufu Bay is also in line with expectations, and it is full of sincerity to give guests the ultimate vacation experience.
It is no exaggeration to call Capella in Tufu Bay the ceiling of Hainan Resort Hotel.
Thanks to Dean, the cultural travel officer, for arranging us in the center of the hotel: Winter House. Five-star praise.

I came to the first choice Capella Hotel in Sanya. I stayed at it before and liked it very much. This time I booked another two nights. The day before the check-in, the cultural tourism officer will call and ask how many people will arrive at the door. Check-in text The brigade officer Brian accompanied us all the way, and upgraded us to a suite room type for free, and delivered it to our room after check-in! All the staff I met in the hotel were in very good condition, definitely the best service among the three hotels I stayed in! The hotel not only provides attentive service, but also does a good job in landscaping. Every step is a scene, full of charm! During the day, my husband took the children to the children's playground and the swimming pool to play, and I lay down in the coconut grove by the beach for an afternoon, which was so comfortable and relaxing! In the evening, you can also take your children to the beach to dig small crabs. After digging and releasing them, it is so meaningful! The crab digging staff is also accompanied throughout the process, teaching you how to dig, very patient! The taste of the Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory. I feel that it is not as amazing as the taste I ate in the past two years, but I will not step on the thunder! Brian gave us a gift when we checked out. Brian was very considerate from check-in to check-out, thank you very much! Next time I come to Sanya, I will still stay at Capella!

The receptionist, the shuttle bus boy, the gardener, and the waiters in the hotel all speak slowly and softly. As long as they meet guests on the road, they will take the initiative to say hello and give sincere greetings care. My cultural travel officer, Brian, was very attentive and responsive throughout the whole process. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the beach sand is very fine, much finer than that of Park Hyatt. It’s also worth mentioning that the photographers of Capella’s Piaget Brigade are very professional, and the photos are so beautiful, much better than the photographers of Mandarin Oriental’s Bojue Brigade, which led us to spend huge sums of money to select 50 photos. Speaking of shortcomings, the only disadvantage is that the room has a musty smell.

Stayed only one night but left a deep impression, this is a hotel that makes you want to stay again next time! If the breakfast is too rich, there is no need to eat lunch! Don't miss the ice cream cone at afternoon tea. It's a pity that I couldn't soak in the swimming pool this time because the weather was cold in the morning and evening. Next time, I will definitely take beautiful photos on the blue couch in the swimming pool!

msg:I booked a garden-view room for two nights. The day before check-in, Anna, the cultural tourism officer, called and added WeChat to learn about the arrival time and needs, and introduced the location of the hotel and various activities. As soon as the taxi arrived at the entrance of the hotel lobby, Anna I have been greeted there, and it is as warm as coming home. Every time she sends a message, Anna responds in seconds and solves the needs in a timely manner. The food and lodging in the hotel for two days was very good, and every staff member I met was polite. The meals in the Chinese and Western restaurants are delicious, and the breakfast is very rich. The battery car shuttles through the park and stops at the beck and call, so you don't have to worry about walking in the sun in hot weather. The hotel environment is better than other five-star hotels. One step at a time, one scene, a perfect experience, the well-deserved ceiling in Sanya, if you come to Sanya again, you will definitely choose to stay at Capella again!

msg:This is the first time I have returned to "Jia", and the experience is very good. Thanks to Anna, the cultural tourism officer of Capella, I felt the meticulous care during the 2 days at Capella~ I will contact me before I check in, add me on WeChat, and introduce me Hotel activities, restaurants, spa, actively assist me to make reservations for hotel restaurants and spa times; pick me up in the lobby when I check in, upgrade my room type for free, and send me back to the room; respond to my needs during check-in, and even drive my battery car by myself when I wait for a long time The battery car came to pick me up (this was really beyond my expectation, I was really touched, this service, there is nothing comparable to it?) Give you a thumbs up!
Although the location of the hotel is relatively remote and there is nothing around, there are still many activities in the hotel:
"Morning Ritual" at 8:30 in the morning - Water Tai Chi
Super long breakfast buffet: until 11 am, you can eat brunch directly! It is recommended to have a bowl of local characteristic Hainan Baoluo noodles!
Free afternoon snacks at 3-4 p.m., you only need to be seated, and the staff will serve you rich snacks~
Into the night ceremony from 6 to 7 in the evening - tasting different cocktails every day, and there are also non-alcoholic cocktails for friends who don't drink~
As for the restaurant, I checked in at The Dempsey Western Restaurant in the hotel, booked an outdoor seat, watched the beautiful scenery, and had dinner. It was really wonderful.
The hotel's main swimming pool is super fun, I had a lot of fun, lol~
The hotel exclusively enjoys a beach. The sand on the beach is very fine and clean. It is soft and comfortable when you step on it~

Service: There is nothing to say about the overall service. As long as you walk on the road and meet the hotel staff, whether it is a waiter, a hotel gardener, or the cleaning lady in the toilet, they will take the initiative to say hello to you, "Good morning, Good noon, good afternoon, good evening", really experience the feeling of "home away from home"!

Environment: The hotel has a lot of green plants in general. During the two days I went there, I saw staff disinfecting mosquitoes, so my "mosquito-sucking physique" was not bitten at all in the hotel! This feels really great!

Finally, I would like to say that Capella's coconut water is really delicious~thanks to my cultural travel officer Anna!

msg:The worst hotel. I have been to Sanya more than 10 times and stayed in most high-end hotels. Capella has the worst service. On the first night, I checked in at 4:00 pm. The front desk staff led me to the room, turned left and right all the way, and I left in a hurry to go to Poly Rosewood Hotel to have dinner with friends. When I came back, it was very late, about 10 pm, with my wife and daughter. Because I was not familiar with the road and had drunk, I couldn't find the room. I went to the front desk to find the receptionist and wanted her to lead us back to the room. But after the front desk contacted, no one took us there. It was very irresponsible. I went to the battery car ride point and asked the driver to take us back to the room. I also accepted it. The battery car driver's name is ***? He was arrogant and said that we should walk over. I disagreed. The driver drove to the boarding point on the floor of our room with an emotional attitude. I said I couldn't find the room and asked him to take us up. He had a bad attitude and said that he had no obligation to do so. He got in the car and drove away. I blocked the car and asked what your name was, and he said there was no need to tell you. The two sides had a dispute, and I was a little angry. He also provoked me with words, saying, "Come on, you scold me, you have the guts to hit me, and you said in front of my daughter that you are setting an example for your child like this?" I really wanted to hit him, but I held back. I had no choice but to call the hotel, and the manager on duty came to solve the problem. Later, the driver said to me privately, "Brother, we are both from the same hometown. I was wrong. Can you see if you can withdraw the complaint?" I didn't agree. The manager asked the driver to leave, and we communicated downstairs for an hour, but to no avail. I told the manager on duty that I had only one request, and that he should formally apologize in front of me, my wife and daughter. In the end, it was not effectively resolved. I had no choice but to return to the room. When I returned to the room, I immediately wrote down the reason on Ctrip and applied to cancel the trip. Ctrip replied that it was rejected by the hotel. The next morning, in the spirit of family travel, it is better to have less trouble than more, so I discussed with my wife and daughter and thought about forgetting it. Around noon, the duty manager contacted me and said that the hotel's front desk manager (**, male) and loss prevention director ** (full name) wanted to see me. I didn't want to see them, but I was just about to go out and pass by the hotel lobby, so I met them. As a result, manager ** said some useless words first, mostly apologies, and I accepted them. But then the loss prevention-** said that because he saw me and the battery car driver pushing each other in the surveillance yesterday, he asked me to unilaterally terminate this order trip. I had already let go of yesterday's matter (not to mention that I had applied to cancel the trip last night, and Capella Hotel refused my cancellation. The picture is posted below). When he said this, I got angry. I took out the cancellation order process last night for them to see. The other party was speechless. I said that even if Capella Hotel asked me to stay, I would not stay. Manager ** strictly speaking, he was not qualified for this position at all. Both parties couldn't talk anymore, and he didn't move. After the loss prevention-** saw that I had applied to cancel the trip last night and was rejected by the hotel, he made an excuse to leave. I asked: Why did you run away if you didn't feel guilty? You don't care about your face. I asked for his business card to complain about him, but he ignored me and ran away (I later went to the front desk and asked his name - **). Then the manager ** said, sorry, that's not what I meant, saying that they are two lines. He didn't mean to let us leave the hotel. I think it's ridiculous. You are not here to solve the problem, but to intensify the conflict. I refused directly. I immediately changed to Poly Rosewood Hotel. It would be my loss to say one more word to such a person. The hotel that ranks first in the Ctrip ranking can do such a thing. With such a level of management, the *** said that the blade should be turned inward, but you are turning the blade towards the customers. It's really **. It's conceivable that a collective enterprise with such a manager will not go far. I will also continue to complain to the Capella Group headquarters. Please choose Capella Hotel carefully. It's not worthy of the position. Ritz-Carlton, Sun Bay Park Hyatt, Poly Rosewood, etc. are better choices. Please choose carefully.

The hotel was very quiet and the service staff were very enthusiastic, especially Brandon, who introduced us to the hotel and room layout very carefully. The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the sea view in the room was not as good as expected. However, it is a good choice for vacation.

msg:This hotel meets all needs and imaginations for a vacation
After checking out from Atlantis, we came to Capella, and we felt that we had stepped into a relaxed holiday a**osphere from a joyous and noisy play a**osphere. Brian, the cultural travel officer, is very professional. He added WeChat one day in advance, inquired carefully about the travel personnel and plans, and prepared toiletries and small gifts for the children. When we arrived by car, Brian was already waiting at the door. He adjusted the room we were satisfied with, introduced the hotel's activities and facilities in detail, and gave the children piles of gifts when we left. It really made the guests feel at home. ! Give a big thumbs up to the smiling Brain!

Environment: The greenery of the hotel is very good, one step at a time, one scene at a time, the Chinese decoration style, and the well-arranged buildings all make people feel relaxed and happy

Service: The butler Brain is super awesome, so I won't go into details. Everyone here is very enthusiastic and meets all your requirements. Because the child is only 2 years old, the staff here are one-to-one with the child to play, especially thanks to the young lady Lan Xiaoqin who taught the child to play with clay in the children's activity center and took the child to catch crabs on the beach, as shown in the picture. A very patient, kind and lovely young lady who has been playing with the baby.

Hygiene: Every corner is cleaned, and the hygiene is excellent

Meals: The breakfast is really great, there are fried salmon, chicken feet in black bean sauce, Baoluo powder, etc. are all very good

When I got home, I asked the child where he liked it better, and the child said he liked this crab-catching hotel better.
The hotel I will choose next time

msg:The hotel hardware and software are top-notch luxury, but the service is not worthy of such a high price. First of all, it was already the afternoon when I checked in, but I was told that the room had not been cleaned yet. There was only one room on the first and second floors to choose from. They called me in the morning to ask when I would check in. It was really inappropriate for me to not be ready by the afternoon. Moreover, it was not stated when checking in that the rooms on the first floor were designed for people with reduced mobility, which caused trouble in subsequent room changes. Secondly, during breakfast, the waiter had already taken away all the half-used meals when he came back from the meal. He was so unobservant that I deliberately left my room card on the table as a reminder. Such a big brand should work hard to improve its service level. Another point is also very important: the hotel is located in a remote location, making it inconvenient to go anywhere and eat out. It is suitable for people who like to stay in the hotel for a day. In short, it is a place where I would not want to live if my friends were not around.

Outside the hotel There is no restaurant for dining, and the three restaurants in the hotel are expensive. A two-night stay costs more than 12,600 yuan, and two meals cost more than 5,000 yuan. To be honest, it is not a star-rated luxury hotel, but a very ordinary hotel. It feels like a hotel with a price of more than 1,000 yuan; Incomparable to the internal facilities of Atlantis and Yanlord Crown, bad reviews, bad reviews

1. The room is large in size, soundproof and quiet, surrounded by green trees, the pool and bedding are great, except for alcoholic drinks, the minibar is free. The hotel's garden design is amazing, with its unique beach 🏖️ and the coconut grove swimming pool, which makes us feel like we are back in the European luxury hotels on the three major pearl islands in the Indian Ocean, even the smell in the air is the same.
2. The hotel has a lot of activities: wake up in the morning and watch Tai Chi performances in the pool, free afternoon tea, free wine for the night ceremony, and a free 40-minute travel photo, which is very rich.
3. Thanks to Dean, the cultural tourism officer, for his thoughtful and thoughtful arrangement, who helped us arrange to live in Dongfu (it is very close to the lobby, restaurant, beach, and swimming pool, and not far to walk), and arranged various activities for our wedding anniversary: Lanting and Romantic dinner at the poolside restaurant, with flowers, cake (which is delicious), fruit, red wine and departure gift bag. I gave away a lot of black magic flavored black tea that we love to drink😄. Response to every request!
We had a very pleasant stay in Capella. It is worthy of the ceiling of the top luxury hotel on domestic islands. It really does not lose to the luxury hotels in Maldives, Maoqiu and Seychelles👍.

The environment of the hotel is impressive, the stargazing pool in the lobby is very shocking, the morning ceremony is majestic, the night ceremony is unique, the breakfast is very rich, with complete categories and good taste, the quality of bedding is good, and it is very comfortable to sleep. However, there are some deficiencies during the stay, for example, the quality of the toiletries in the room is not high, the drying rack on the balcony is not practical enough, and although the afternoon tea can be eaten freely, the quality and taste are relatively average. The overall stay experience is very good, leaving a good memory.

msg:Rarely do you want to take the time to write a review. It's the first time I live near Haitang Bay. The journey of Capella will make me come here when I want to be free. Special thanks to brandon, the cultural and tourism officer of the hotel, who contacted me one day in advance and introduced the hotel in detail. I have been concerned about the approximate arrival time since I got off the plane. The check-in is also accompanied throughout the whole process. If there is any problem, it is really arranged on call. Knowing that I came here specially for my birthday this time, I prepared a cake and exquisite small gifts, full of details.
Whether it's the concierge, the restaurant, all the staff in the hotel have a very good service attitude, the breakfast is very rich, the hotel has its own beach, and we specially ordered a beach dinner. Although the price of 6888 is a little expensive, the actual experience is very good.

msg:The most expensive hotels get the most mosquito bites. The kid bit him like this one night, and I was speechless. I have stayed in many hotels during this trip to Sanya, and this is the worst one. I would like to ask how the hotel kills mosquitoes? Whether the food and drink service is good or not is another matter. First of all, the personal safety of the residents must be ensured. It was said that a housekeeper sent me a message on WeChat a day in advance to ask when I would check in tomorrow. I said I would arrive at the store at 2:00, but when I checked in at the front desk, I was told that the room was not ready yet and that it would take another hour before I could check in. Then I would like to ask the housekeeper what is the use of adding WeChat to inquire in advance. Just a routine, just show off.

msg:I stayed for five days during the Spring Festival. Personally, I feel that the most outstanding thing overall is not the environment but the service. In particular, some services can exceed your expectations. For example, the chef of the New Year's Eve dinner was worried that we would not have enough food, so he sent an extra dish. The overall feeling is that the staff After a lot of training, the only dissatisfaction is that when resting on the beach of the hotel, the waiter always asks which room it is, and the tone is a bit bad, as if I am not worthy of staying in their hotel. I dug a few words. In addition, the serving speed of the New Year's Eve dinner is a bit slow. Other services are very good. The hotel provides a 24-hour shuttle bus service, and the environment of the heated swimming pool is also very good. The breakfast is indeed what it said on the Internet: Mrs. Wife... It's rich. The hotel also arranges a lot of activities for children every day. In the evening, I took the children to catch crabs on the beach. They had a lot of fun. The hotel staff are very polite, and the new shoes are a bit rough. Call the front desk to ask for a Band-Aid, and they will immediately ask you if you are injured. In short, the service in all experiences is very good, and you can see foreign executives from their management patrolling in every corner of the hotel every day. Of course, the consumption is indeed not cheap, you get what you pay for the service, it would be more perfect if the hotel can go further in children’s entertainment and facilities experience, the overall evaluation is very good, it can be regarded as the current service in the hotel I have stayed in The best one, friends with sufficient budget can try it

msg:I think the Capella Hotel in Sanya is the most high-end in all aspects, especially the public area is well done, with tropical plants for landscaping, garden landscape with water as the link, hotel lobby, academy, Chinese and Western restaurants are a lot Use water features to keep vacationers in a quiet state,
The hotel's swimming pool landscaping is also very special. Coconut trees are planted beside the beach, only 10 meters away from the sea. I heard that this is specially planted by the hotel.
The most shocking thing about this Capella is that when I entered the hotel, I saw a huge dome. The water curtain slowly fell from the top of the dome. Through the water curtain, I could see the blue sky outside the dome. Very beautiful, very deep~
Free snacks and soft drinks are available in the living room around the clock, including a sweet afternoon meal, which is equivalent to afternoon tea. The breakfast is also good. I would like to recommend the western restaurant. The steak is very good. I ate at the western restaurant for two nights. There was no outdoor water view seat for one day, so I booked an outdoor water view seat for the second day. I ate T-bone steak on the first day, which was very good. On the second day, I decided to order M5 rib eye. After eating, I felt that the rib eye steak was even better the next day. Well, there are many reasons for this, so I won’t go into details... After all, Cappelle vacation is a really good choice

I took a fancy to the private beach with few people, and took my three-year-old child to play, mainly for swimming and sand digging. , she is the happiest. But when I got off the bus at the hotel, I felt at ease, and I could go to the hotel with peace of mind. My cultural tourism officer, Dean, gave a warm reception, professionally introduced the hotel and informed about the various activities in the hotel. After staying for 4 days, I was reluctant to leave. The hotel is so beautiful that every frame can be produced. The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich and delicious. There are two restaurants in the hotel, a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant. The environment and taste are also excellent! The little friend refused to leave after playing, and told me not to go home, but to stay in a hotel and go to the beach 🏖️

msg:Arranging Capella at the end of our trip to Hainan was perfect!
Thanks to Freya, the cultural tourism officer, for contacting me the day before check-in, and learned that this is my anniversary trip with my dad. The room was arranged in advance and the room type was upgraded. We can check in immediately after 1:00 at Capella. Very enthusiastic and careful arrangement, presented the anniversary cake "It was really delicious" and red wine "I don't know how to appreciate red wine, but I think it's very good to drink", and I also gave the children a small snack "It's so hard, there is a baby's name" . The most applauded is the winter camp, which literally liberates parents, and it is really a bonus facility that a resort hotel should have. The coaches of the winter camp, Claire, Abby, and Tony are really caring. They record the children's activities in detail. The activities are very rich and happy, and they refuse to leave when they pick up the children. "I don't want to take off the necklace I put on, and the cookies I made are delicious when I bring them home." When the children went to the winter camp, my father and I strolled slowly and ate up all the afternoon. After picking up the baby, I went swimming until the night ceremony at six o'clock. There were red wine and sparkling wine to choose from, and there was a daily cocktail story experience at half past six. Wine tasting, listening to music and watching the night fall, couldn't be more comfortable. In the opening ceremony on the morning of the second day, watching Tai Chi in the water, the Zen is so peaceful and far away. This is really what a vacation is all about: comfort, tranquility, relaxation and a feeling of being at home.

msg:As a Ctrip user for many years, my first negative review was given to Capella, which is known as the ceiling of Sanya hotels. Although, we don't know where the name "Ceiling" came from. In terms of environment, it is indeed okay, but it is not as good as "Ceiling". Compared with other hotels in Sanya, it is about the same. When it comes to service, it is at best average. It was not satisfactory. The bathrobe was taken away for cleaning and was not replaced. I asked customer service to ask for it and waited for more than half an hour before it was delivered. What is especially unbearable for me is that this time I am traveling with my 2-year-old child. You have to wait for the battery car everywhere, and it can take at least three to five minutes, or at most you have already reached your destination and the battery car has not arrived yet. I made a reservation for three days and wanted to check out after one day. There were very few parent-child programs, including a palm-sized water park and a children's park (which is a combination of various building blocks and toys in one room). In order to save the business's face, I asked for an early check-out. The reason for the room was that I was in a hurry to go back to work, and then I asked you to wait for a reply, whether you agreed to refund or not. You at least gave me a reply, even if you couldn't refund, it was an explanation. In the end, I ran to the front desk to ask. , asked you to wait, asked you to wait on the phone, and waited until it was time to check out today. I was really speechless😓. Then there is the bottled water in the hotel. At first glance, it seems to be very high-end. In fact, there are great health risks. The bottles are recycled. You can make up your own mind on whether they will be cleaned and disinfected after recycling. Ask customer service for ordinary plastic bottled water. , was also told no.

msg:A month ago, I booked the Capella Hotel through Ctrip. The reviews were generally good, so I made a decisive reservation for three days. The plane flew to Sanya in the early morning of the New Year's Day. There were not many people. The pick-up car picked us up and went straight to Capella. The distance from the airport to the hotel is not bad. Within an hour, during the days of the New Year, the Sanya Expressway was jammed. There is too much traffic, especially in some tunnels, and the driving is slow. When we arrived at the hotel, because we came from Shandong and were wearing winter padded clothes, there was a lion dance performance outside the lobby. Two service staff came forward to help us The suitcase, arranged for us to enter the lobby to check in, and was very considerate to help us label the suitcase and give me one. When the time came to verify, I was not attracted by the lion dance performance at all. Like it, there are not many people checking in, but We checked in around 11 o'clock, and we waited until 2:30 in the afternoon, but we hadn't moved in yet. We had lunch at Lanting at noon, 2,000 yuan, really expensive, a few dishes. For us Shandong people, it’s not enough to stuff our teeth, but it tastes good. At 2:30, because I was wearing winter clothes, and my wife and children couldn’t check in after waiting for so long, I would like to praise Ms. Zhang Cong, the front desk manager on duty. She saw that We were so embarrassed that we directly upgraded the room on the large flat floor, which is similar to a villa, with two floors above and below, and gave us the lower floor. The area is better than the 88-square-meter Yitian Pavilion we booked before. There are no mosquitoes, the environment is good, and it is quiet. Here is a big compliment to Ms. Zhang Cong. I basically took my children to play all the projects in the hotel. All the staff's attitude, tone, and service are very good, but there is one individual that must be criticized. The hotel's private beach has food stalls and food stall staff One of them forgot to ask the name. I asked for three coconuts, but I couldn’t take them all by myself. While waiting for the coconuts to be cut, this kid had a bad attitude and a deadpan face, as if I owed him money. The remaining two The little comrades are not bad, but this one, the buffet. tasty. Regardless of whether you pay for it in the morning or at night, it is paid, and it is too expensive. In the words of my daughter-in-law, it does not matter if you are more expensive. There are many varieties and flavors, and it is delicious. Is it worth the money? I suggest everyone to be cautious, and the scene I saw with my own eyes, there were two foreigners who greeted me, but I ignored them. They were wearing their own clothes and could not be identified as the hotel manager in the restaurant. I saw them whispering. One of the expats took the initiative to clean up the table and the tableware left after the guests finished eating. After asking, I found out that it was the hotel manager. He really did it himself. There is nothing to say about the professionalism of foreigners, outside the restaurant. I'm smoking. I saw another foreign manager, a family of four or five people, pushing a stroller, going down the stairs. The foreign manager took the initiative to help carry the baby carriage. I thought, if it were a Chinese manager, this matter would be embarrassing. In the end, the three-day trip was over. Before leaving and checking out, I ran into Ms. Zhang Cong, the former front desk manager on duty. She even remembered that I brought the child here, and asked me how I felt about my stay. She also gave the child a doll and two cups. She personally sent me to the car at the door. The temperature in Sanya on January 25 was 13 degrees. She was waiting for us to drive away in the cold wind. I hope the two foreign managers can see my evaluation. Employees like Zhang Cong, no Should her work be promoted and reused? Improve service quality is from the little details. Let’s just write this, I hope it will be helpful to friends who will go to Capella next time

Capella's service is top-notch, two days' stay is not enough! look forward to coming again next time

msg:As a hotel lover, I have been to about a hundred hotels in various countries. I stayed in this hotel for 10 days with the attitude of trying. The hotel is absolutely first-class in terms of design and hardware facilities. As a clean freak, I can't fault its cleanliness. The hotel is very clean and tidy, both in the room and in the public areas, and it is clean without dead ends. From the first day we stayed in the hotel, my cultural travel The official Dean started to take care of me in every possible way. My husband is Muslim and doesn’t eat pork, but he likes to eat dumplings. When my cultural and tourism officer Dean found out about this, he arranged for the hotel to make beef stuffing on the second day. My son’s dumplings, and Dean, the cultural tourism officer, didn’t know if I would order them. When I said I wanted to eat dumplings today, he said that he specially prepared beef dumplings for your husband today. I was really touched. There are many things like this. The service of this hotel is absolutely top-notch. As long as you have been to a hotel restaurant or bar once, they will remember your preferences, tastes, and some taboos. They are very careful and caring. When you leave I also gave us a souvenir gift bag. I am very satisfied with the experience of Capella, and its superb service is impeccable. It made me feel like home. I will come back next year for the holiday and bring more relatives and friends come over! Thanks to my cultural tourism officer Dean for taking care of me these days! Thanks to all the hotel service staff for their superb service, you are the number one hotel in Sanya

msg:All kinds of details are done very well, baby slippers, toiletries, and men's shaving products are very good. You can see the bottom of the pool being cleaned almost every day. The children's playground is also a highlight. Whether it is a sea view room, a garden view or a villa, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most considerate thing is that the child fell asleep when we checked in. We booked a sea view room, but it was full during the peak season and the room was not cleaned yet. The waiter suggested that we upgrade the garden view room for free. We still prefer a sea view room and declined. Personal suggestion: Young people who like the sea choose sea view rooms, and if there are elderly people, choose garden view and villas, which are especially quiet.
All-weather free snacks and soft drinks in the living room, including a sweet afternoon meal, and a night ceremony. The variety and taste of breakfast are great, and the Chinese food at Lanting is also delicious, but the room rate and restaurant prices doubled during the Spring Festival is a bit too much.
The only regret is that the surrounding area is too old and dilapidated. Except for the hotel where you can eat and play, there is no food and fun within a few kilometers.

In contrast, the interior design is second-rate, not as good as those at the bottom of the list, such as sprinklers and bar cabinets, which feel that they are all designed to deal with it. There are cockroaches in the room, which is very troublesome. The aerobic exercise equipment in the gym is sufficient, and the strength equipment is basically flashy and unusable. As shown in the picture, it seems that the gym has the same style as this hotel, flashy. The first time I went there was to listen to Huyou, and I couldn't find a reason to go again.

The rooms are very comfortable, quiet, clean, with a reasonable layout and a wide view. The soft power is also very strong, and the service is very good. On the first night of our night flight, the small plane accidentally blew up. The plane was hung on the coconut tree on the beach. The circle is cushioned, and the "rescue" is completed safely and smoothly. The whole process feels very intimate.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the tables, chairs and parasols on the beach are a bit scattered during the day, probably because of the New Year's Eve beach barbecue.

It seems to be contracted for several miles. The hotel facilities are also very beautiful, very suitable for a seaside wedding. Of course The most worth recommending is the service of the hotel. Every service staff will greet you. The experience is excellent. Every day, the room is cleaned up twice. Of course, here I still want to thank Brother Rico for his responsive service. He is very considerate and in place, helping to buy alcohol on the first day The next day, I helped buy masks almost every day. Even though I didn’t get out of the hotel, I had a great time.

msg:Capella is the hotel that my family and I have always wanted to check in. In order to make the hotel develop better, here is an open and honest review.
1. The core product, the room, has booked a basic room type, and can directly upgrade to a studio suite at the front desk. Impressive points for first-time customers. There are a few free snacks and drinks in the room. The most comfortable thing is the bedding, which is the most comfortable I have ever slept on. I especially like the towels and bath towels in the bathroom, which are absorbent and comfortable. Nice!
2. For breakfast, all meals are taken by the waiter. Ruisby is economical and clean. I personally like it very much and this is the first time I have experienced it. I just don't know if the customers will queue up when there are many times. Very good!
3. Room service, in the coldest place in Hainan, when I arrived at the store because of cold diarrhea, I delivered food twice➕received food, cleaned once, three times➕quilt and quilt cover, the waiter took the trouble to satisfy them one by one. not expensive. But very warm. Fried chicken like!
Here are the points to complain about:
4. As a loyal Marriott Platinum member for many years, I rarely stay in other hotels, so the room type is upgraded to a studio room. For any Marriott hotel that stays casually, it is given priority to upgrade to a villa or suite, and the check-in time is not limited, and the check-out time is always For me at 16 o'clock, Capella is a cold face to me. Even if I checked into Capella at 4:30, I was asked to leave the hotel at 12:00 the next day. After thick-skinned negotiations ➕ shameless late check-out, I managed to leave the room at 13:45, feeling insulted!
Suggestion: Can guests who check in late be able to delay generously, and don't let the waiter's speech skills give me the feeling that it is a charity for me.
5. The waiter promised to have a departure gift, but the check out didn't know if it was because we were late. We didn't mention it at all, and we didn't really have the nerve to speak up, so we left.
Suggestion: Don't promise if you can't do it, I don't need gifts, but don't say anything, I thank you, you are gone...
6. Lunch: Capella is located in a remote location, surrounded by original village houses and orchards. There are no restaurants and takeaways, so you can only eat here. Among the grilled wings on the menu, the ones that come up are fried wings, which are completely inconsistent with the pictures and texts; the coconut soup and the example soup are shi people, and the steak in the middle of the beef burger is very salty and has a fishy smell; the service consciousness of the waiters is not bad, and they know me Each dish was withdrawn after only a sip. I hurried to find the manager to apologize. The attitude was very good, but I didn't want to accept it. It is acceptable for one dish to be bad, and there are problems with each one. The hotel should consider changing the chef team.
Suggestion: People nowadays are healthy and healthy. If there is fried food on the menu, I will not order it. The discrepancy between the pictures and the text is a low-level mistake of elementary school students. Capella will not be short of money to buy wings. The dishes are so salty, tell me that because of the long cooking time, this is not an attitude of admitting mistakes, my aunt's cooking is better than Chef Capella's.
7. I experienced the biggest spa in history and the most difficult to make an appoin**ent. On the first night, I made an appoin**ent for two people at the spa and was told that I could only be one person, so my family and I had to be separated. The waiter said that I got off work at 10 o'clock, so I don't mind coming later. I replied that as long as there are two people, any night is fine. As a result, the semi-finals of the World Cup ended and ignored us. I went the next morning and said that the door would not open until twelve o’clock (I didn’t know that when I arrived in Qatar, there were no two employees who went to work a day. I didn’t want to work overtime for how much money I paid!) Thinking that I had to finish lunch and go to the spa, the front desk urged me to leave Room, I tried to send money to Capella but was rejected many times. As far as this service is concerned, it is worthy of being a hotel controlled by a central enterprise, and it is not short of money!

Finally, to sum up, based on my experience of 300 days of business trips, it is already very difficult for hotels to make profits from guest rooms. They will find secondary consumption points through catering➕leisure mode. I personally support this. The hotel makes money, the employees are good, and the employees are satisfied. Will serve customers better. But your product must be hardcore enough to attract customers. For example, Ting Hotel in XXX brings in fresh seafood every day, Aolong, Bolong, and Ivory Mussels are right in front of your eyes, you can order dishes from the products, and five-star food stalls; Xingji and Xingsen Hotels have a variety of minibars, and the welcome gift is not Armani. Cosmetics are directly delivered to the room for a one-on-one afternoon tea of several hundred yuan, which is generous enough. It is common for many hotel spas to stay open until the middle of the night...these Capella have them, it is better not to have them... I hope the guests are not just like me Let’s try it out once. After a long time, the attractiveness of the hotel will be greatly reduced. If there are so many masters, do you still rely on permanent new customer consumption and Internet celebrity traffic? ?

There seem to be more complaints, but the score is still very high. It is for the younger brother and younger sister who upgraded the room and gave me porridge, as well as our room service!

The Capella that stayed for three nights undoubtedly added a lot of surprises to my gray swaying mood. Personally, I feel that the breakfast is richer and more attentive than that of the Edition Park Hyatt. The truffle hot spring eggs are well received, and the coffee is also divided into categories for you to choose. Butler Moli's service is super considerate, and will arrange small snacks to be delivered to the room every afternoon. I went to the next hotel and left in a hurry and didn't have time to get the small gift from Moli. She even contacted me and arranged for someone to drive to my room the next day. I told the aunt who cleaned the room that I like the pink sheets and actually replaced the green sheets with pink ones hahaha! The details are made to the extreme, and the warm human touch is commendable.

msg:Ctrip has never given a negative review. When I came to Sanya this time, I thought about how good the service and environment of Capella are. First of all, there are a lot of mosquitoes in the hotel. My expectations for the environment may be too high, and I didn’t think it was that good. Then, As for the service, I was extremely dissatisfied when I checked in on the first day. They said it was a 24-hour shuttle bus. I called the hotel front desk several times and no one answered. When I finally got through, I was told to go downstairs and wait for the bus in 3 minutes. I went downstairs and waited. We had been there for about 10 minutes, and I was hitchhiking with someone else. I asked if I could go to the lobby. He seemed to be reluctant and said to me, "Then you can come up too." When I arrived, I said impatiently: This is the lobby. You go down too! The next day, when I went back to the room, I met the guide who had checked in on the first day with other guests. We took the same elevator and pretended not to know each other the whole time. It made people feel extremely superior. The hotel overall felt super worthless. The service staff was really good. It is a "high-end" hotel and the service staff are indeed "high-end"! The hotel is located in Tufu Bay, and there are indeed no supporting facilities in the surrounding area. It is not cost-effective at all. Personally speaking, the Edition and Rosewood in Haitang Bay are much better than it. I really don’t recommend trying it here.

msg:Let's just say Capella is amazing! There are many activities in the hotel, and the itinerary can be fully arranged every day. Every activity is very worthwhile to experience the Dadong coach's cycling trip. The multi-functional area in the evening is very interesting. Guan Aria's service is very attentive and thoughtful. It is very convenient to have her company on Capella's journey. She can be found at any time for booking hotel activities or other needs. The stay experience exceeded expectations and is worth recommending!

msg:When I went to Shenzhen to attend a wedding, I was unable to return to Beijing due to the pop-up window. I had to stay in a low-risk area for a few days to clear the pop-up window, so I chose Capella.
Maybe because we went in the off-season, the hotel was quiet and not many people. The hotel is above the standard in terms of hardware and software. The hotel also arranges some interesting activities such as riding and catching crabs every day.
The hotel breakfast is also of good quality among the hotels I have stayed in recently, and the food in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious!
Special praise to our cultural and tourism officer, Miss Effy! It's really all about the details, and you can respond to any request. Basically, we don't need to worry about anything, and she will help you figure it out in advance!
Since this time is not a simple vacation, I can only take a break from work and relax. I will definitely come back to experience it next time when I have the opportunity!

msg:This time we came mainly for our birthday. Miss Moli, the cultural and tourism officer, helped us arrange the room in advance, upgraded the room type, and reserved a room with the best view. He also made a spa appoin**ent for us in advance. During the recovery of the epidemic, Lanting was not open every day. Elena, a Chinese restaurant, helped us arrange dinner very considerately. The taste of Chinese and Western food is very good. I recommend the colorful tofu in Lanting and the wagyu beef in the dempsey. I had a very happy two days in Capella. Unfortunately, I avoided the typhoon and the uninterrupted rain, and I didn't go to dig crabs in the evening.

msg:I have to say that after staying at this Capella, other hotels in Sanya are not so fragrant. First of all, the sense of escape is really full, reminding me of Rosewood Phuket; secondly, the hotel's various free experiences are really popular. The breakfast open until 11 o'clock is rich and delicious. I eat it directly for lunch. The afternoon snacks and my favorite night-time ritual are really relaxing while drinking a small wine and watching the sunset. The service of the hotel is also very considerate. , especially thanks to the housekeeper Anna's service, from before check-in to check-out, it can be said to be meticulous, giving red wine when checking in, and preparing small gifts when checking out. Since this stay is in the off-season, the room was upgraded to a garden-view studio suite. Although we encountered continuous rainy days, staying in the room became a kind of enjoyment. Finally, the hotel's Chinese restaurant is of the highest standard, but the most worthwhile one is spa. At the moment when you can't go abroad, this Capella is the best place to experience the sense of escape in Sanya.

The one-day stay is fully arranged. There will also be a thoughtful souvenir when you check out.
Service: Brother Dean is our cultural travel officer. He will contact us half a day before check-in to help us arrange or review the itinerary. When checking in, he would kindly ask us if we had used breakfast, and knowing that we had not used it, he very thoughtfully led us to have a meal before checking in. This humanized little gesture was very touching from the very beginning. During check-in, we will also provide refreshing and refreshing to the room, and we will also ask about experience and suggestions before check-in and check-out. Dean deserves a five star rating. In addition to the cultural travel officer, other staff members have good memory and service attitude. They will remember the name of the tenant and whether they will come again. They will say "Welcome back", and the wording is not blunt and outdated.
Environment: The courtyard in the public area deserves to spend 5.5 billion yuan to build it, nothing to say. The bedding in the room has good resilience, so you can sleep peacefully. The minibar and free drinks and snacks are also ok. The lavish cloakroom and bathroom design, four-span top wardrobe, round bathtub and double basins are worthy of the reputation of the largest 88-square-meter guest room in Sanya.
On the whole, Capella Hotel can indeed give an immersive holiday a**osphere and successfully start a short second life, I look forward to my next stay!

msg:The first thing to praise is our cultural travel officer, Miss Aria, who is attentive and meticulous and will not feel disturbed. The service that Cosmic Invincible wants to blow up made us feel very comfortable in the hotel throughout the whole process. The total itinerary in Capella is 5 days. The lady of the cultural tourism officer also upgraded us to live in the sea view and Leshuiju garden view. The sea view is on the hillside. The room design is very fashionable. Bar tables are also great for overtime. Leshuiju is more private and more vacationing. Although it is an open room, the design of the room circulation makes each area independent. My favorite is the balcony, watching the wind blowing the leaves is super relaxing. The design landscape of the hotel is based on Southeast Asia, giving people some novel and fashionable feelings, and the supplies are also exquisite (the room accessories are FM super smell!) The beach is not big, but it has been maintained all the time, and the beach security staff has been paying close attention to the guests. safety and mood. Although I haven't experienced too many hotel activities, I like the morning and night ceremonies very much. Although the epidemic has just opened, you can feel the meticulous service in every corner of the hotel. I come to Sanya every year, and Capella is completely worthy of the top card. It is the first choice for the next time! There is too much to praise, and there is no slot at all.

One of the managers was particularly bad and said that he needed data for the fall. At that time, he was planning to go back to Beijing to negotiate. The child returned to Beijing to check and the hotel was responsible for the expenses. Later, we contacted him. We were asked to contact the insurance company ourselves, but it was almost 48 hours later and the hotel didn’t even have a contact person. Very bad hotel.

He can take care of the individual needs of customers well. The hotel's spa is very good, gymnasium And the swimming pool is also great, and the Chinese restaurant is relatively light and more suitable for Cantonese tastes, that is, there are fewer choices of Chinese and Western restaurants and buffet breakfasts. I have stayed in several hotels of the same level in Sanya. The impression here is that the privacy is very good, and it can really give people a vacation experience. I hope it will get better and better!

After arriving, I was told that the Chinese restaurant was closed, which was disappointing. The hotel does not have suitable dishes to eat. The service staff of the hotel restaurant try their best to make stewed eggs and vegetable porridge, and like it, but the holiday quality is slightly insufficient; the afternoon tea is basically passable, the room is not soundproof, and it rains at night. It's very big. I haven't slept well all night. There is a leak in the shower room in the room. The breakfast is really average, there is no comment area, the butler service is average, the afternoon tea was delivered to the wrong place, and when I left, I said there was a gift, but I didn't see it, and said I would make it up next time. Overall, I'm sorry for the high-priced experience during the National Day

The cultural travel officer for this connection was FELIX. Since the flight arrived at night, he was very embarrassed that he waited very late on the day of check-in, and dutifully helped with several itinerary matters. In short, this must be the first choice for vacation in Sanya.

You have to stay at the duty-free shop for a day and cannot come back early. The hotel's internal facilities are OK, but the surrounding area is average and the beach is not delicate. , you can’t go swimming in the sea, and there are not many free activities. The waiters are really patient, but the price/performance ratio is not high, and it is not worth the high price. I feel that other tourists should have other group purchasing channels. There are no restaurants near this hotel, and the hotel restaurants are just so-so. There are not many choices, so I really don’t recommend it. If you have a property nearby, it might be okay to vacation here occasionally.

There was no one at the door to help you carry your luggage. The network in the room was very poor, and the temperature of the air conditioner fluctuated high and low, and the set temperature would change on its own. , what the hell. Occasionally there will be one or two greeters at the door, but they are also *****. If you only wear shorts and T-shirts, they will not pay attention to you. They will look you up and down and then pass you by. Go Greet others. However, there is a problem. Due to the problem of the battery car in the hotel, and after waiting for a long time in the sun, I didn't come. I reacted and Monica in our room expressed her apology and gave some small gifts. The breakfast buffet costs 348 per person, which is a lot to eat. The fried food is cold and greasy. There are not many waiters in such a big restaurant. You have to do everything by yourself and watch the time, because they are waiting for the end time. They won’t remind you that the time is almost up, and if you need something like that, hurry up and get it, just put all the meals away and there is nothing left to eat. In short, the experience this time was very poor. All the good reviews online were copied from the good copywriting provided by the hotel. Overall, it was not one-tenth as good as the Park Hyatt, or even worse than the Ritz-Carlton. The service level is not worthy of its price. There will be no next time for this hotel. Those who want to choose this hotel should be careful! !

The fitness center is fully equipped and very new. The breakfast is rich in variety and the quality is OK. Although the hotel does not have a personal butler, it also reflects the services that a high-quality hotel should have. There is a living room bar in the lobby, and you can rest after the room is checked in or out. Although the free drinks and snacks are of average quality It is still very user-friendly. The beach is very clean and the sand is very fine, and it is also equipped with marine entertainment projects. The prices of hotel restaurants and room delivery are generally high, and additional service fees and taxes are required, but the quality is ok, after all, the price is not high. Low is understandable. I don’t like the canned water provided by the hotel. Although it is a sterilized bottle and the water quality meets the drinking standards, I still feel a little bit in my heart when I think that the last guest may have just drunk the bottle. During the epidemic, it was still normal. Bottled mineral water is cleaner, more hygienic and safer. Besides, hotels of this specification and price are still using ordinary hair dryers, which are a bit strained, and are extremely unfriendly to girls with long hair. Dyson is not fragrant. It is known as the most luxurious hotel in Sanya , It's not that luxurious, but I will come again when I come to Sanya, just sauce~

The housekeeper Helen is super caring. In addition to 24-hour on-call to meet our various needs, he also arranged birthday cakes for the children who were traveling with us. He thoughtfully arranged a minibus for us to take us to the hotel and the airport. When her friend returned to Guangzhou, she found that the umbrella was in the hotel. Helen also tried her best to find an umbrella for her and sent it back to Guangzhou with SF Express, which is super awesome! The hotel has a lot of activities.

msg:Service: Capella doesn't know how to train, the staff is very nice, warm but not flattering, thoughtful but not long-winded.

Transportation: The location is a bit far away, don't even think about going out when you go to Capella, just stay in the hotel and relax.

Hygiene: The hygiene of the guest room is very good, and there are basically no small bugs.
Food: Only this point, I think it needs to be improved, we have tried two restaurants, Lanting Chinese restaurant and poolside restaurant Western food, only the western food Tomahawk steak is okay, Chinese food is particularly lacking in sincerity, it is basically mediocre, and the price is Michelin Because customers basically won't eat when they arrive at Capella, it is better to improve the diet.
Environment: No need to say, picturesque.
The most important thing is to say three times, living in a suite, living in a suite, living in a suite, the suite is the essence.

It's not a family-friendly hotel, but kids get the most comfortable time from the kids club to the pool to the beach. From the bustling city to the breezy coconut forest here, it is a parent-child escape.

Disadvantage 1: The location is a little out of the way, a ten-minute drive from Sanya City. 2: The variety of restaurants is a little less, and the dishes are a little less, which is a big flaw. 3: The restaurant waiters are not very skilled in some business.

msg:1. Positioning comparison: Capella is indeed the No. 1 hotel in Sanya. This trip also stayed in EDITION, and Capella won. I have basically experienced the top hotels in Sanya, and they are indeed top. Self-cultivation, vacation. Far from those hotels in Haitang Bay, the noise is comparable. The normal five-star hotels in China can't compare. A slightly comparable one is the Aman Resort Hotel. The four Aman Resort hotels in China can be compared with Capella. It is not only accommodation, but also a way of life, a living state that makes people relax. Relieve stress. But while Capella may be a governing body. is a brand. The hotel seems to belong to a state-owned enterprise, and the invoice is also raised by a state-owned enterprise. It may be invested by a state-owned enterprise and managed by Capella.
2. Location: Lingshui County, next to Sanya. The beach, in general, but staying in this hotel is not the experience of the beach, the beach is everywhere. The pool is normal. The bar is good, but Louis XIII can be sold by the cup, which is only the second hotel in China. Although the breakfast is a buffet, there is a baffle in front of the dishes, which is similar to the counter. Most of the dishes need to be picked up by the service staff. There may be many reasons for this setting. However, during the peak season, there are many people in the restaurant, and the flow of people is large, which seriously affects the efficiency and causes queues. It is recommended to be fully self-service. You can play like this in the off-season. Peak season is still over. In the restaurant, I ate Lanting, the service was average, there were many empty tables in the hall, and we arranged our family in the corner. Spa - normal, Banyan Tree Spa level.
3, the service is good, most of the service staff are very friendly. The hotel's scooter is also very easy to call, unlike some hotels that have to wait for a long time. The day before moving in, Amber, the cultural and tourism officer of Capella, added me on WeChat and introduced the hotel information. After checking in and checking out, WeChat asked me how was the experience? I was not contacted during the stay. It is suggested that you can introduce the hotel to the guests during the stay, so that the guests can use the hotel better. When checking out, the lobby staff Effie (voice) was very helpful, thank you.
4. The room facilities are of high quality, and the mattress is comfortable, which is Sealy's, see picture. The carpet was stained but cleaned thoroughly. Hotels that do use carpets face a big challenge. After cleaning, there are still traces. Ordinary toilet, strange that there are no hotels with electric toilets in Sanya now, I don't know why. Hotels in the mainland that cost about 1,000 yuan are equipped with electric toilets.

Overall Capella is truly a place to rest, with that feeling of resting in the Maldives.

msg:1 Among the dozen or so five-star hotels I have stayed in in Sanya, the bedding at Capella Hotel is the best (discussed) and my children and I can always sleep deeply and peacefully in Capella (but this time The room type of the child proposes that the soundproofing of the door is not very good)

2 The room is more than three meters high, which makes people feel comfortable

3 The level of Chinese chefs is high

4 is also the room with the most complete bartending equipment and base wine I have ever seen in Hainan. I made myself a mojito with the lush mint grown in the hotel downstairs.

5 Special thanks to Simon, the front desk staff, for his considerate service. I won't say anything here...

This is the best feeling of this stay. The service is not as good as expected, but it is better than other hotels. The swimming pool feels like a failure. For the hotel, it does not feel a**ospheric enough. The swimming pool is not as good as Park Hyatt. In the evening, there is an activity to catch crabs, and there are staff to catch them. They can indeed catch crabs. Generally speaking, they will go again.

Brian, the cultural and tourism officer, communicated various check-in information in advance, prepared the room in advance, prepared the champagne, and remembered the small demand for toilet water. The various inquiries during the stay were also responded quickly.
Overall, Capella is indeed the best resort hotel in Sanya. The hardware and software of the rooms are very strong. The service and a**osphere of the whole hotel are very good. It has crushed the famous MO.
Great view of the beach and pool
The shrimp dumplings and chicken feet for breakfast completely broke through the ability of buffet breakfast
Tried both restaurants, the Chinese restaurant is better. Yellow bell pepper tiger spot and boiled beef are excellent
The best thing is the spa. The functional area for free reservations is too bad to beat any hotel.
The gym also fully meets the needs, the full set of techno is very new
Having lived in Shanghai, Capella Hainan has pushed the domestic resort hotel to a new height. I hope that the apar**ents will become more prosperous and the surrounding area will be more interesting.

msg:Hygiene: At this price, the place that can be seen with the naked eye must be clean
Environment: The environment is very good, the green plants are well maintained, but it is too good, and major defects are buried
Service: Because the green plants are so good, there are too many cicadas in the hotel where I stayed in early June. From 5:00 in the morning, I could hear the loud cicadas in the room. I was confused and woke up at 5:30. At that time, there was an alarm outside. The sound was so loud that Ctrip contacted the hotel to record a video. Figure 1. You can see that in the morning, you spend money on vacation and relax. It is really speechless to wake up early in the morning. Generally, hotels of this price level have the function of removing tattoos and removing cicadas during your stay at the hotel. I was bitten by mosquitoes for more than a dozen packs. Mosquitoes are particularly poisonous. This is not as good as the Park Hyatt EDITION, and I also encountered unpleasantness at the bar. I told the staff that we would take pictures next to us and leave the seat. Don't take away the wine and wait for it to be cleaned up after returning. The cocktails delivered are also very hard to drink. Even the soy sauce is mixed with soy sauce. Either do it carefully or don’t do it. I don’t know if it’s a vampire in this hotel. The next day I couldn't answer the phone calls during the day
Facility: When I lived last year, this broken hair dryer weight machine can still be used. This year, the broken hair dryer weight machine can not be used. The Edison with the same price has replaced the Dyson hair dryer. Everyone else is improving Capella. I haven't even cancelled the best resident singing in the Sanya Hotel, reducing the cost. Now the staff are all old fritters. In the past, many college students were very active and energetic. Now it's different. By the way, Capella should be the ceiling of Sanya in terms of SPA. This point is very good, the space is large and all kinds are very clean and have a say

The day before the trip, Ellie, the cultural and tourism officer, took the initiative to contact us, arranged the itinerary thoughtfully, upgraded our room, and sent us birthday cakes and flowers. We encountered some small problems during the check-in process, and the supervisor Suzy listened carefully to the opinions, and personally helped us to carry our luggage and upgrade to the sea view suite when there were not enough staff. During dinner at the restaurant, Abby was kind enough to take pictures of us and take the leftover birthday cake back to the room (ps. the cake was so delicious!!!)
Due to the epidemic, facilities such as the Chinese restaurant and the library bar have not been opened (fortunately, the buffet breakfast has just resumed), but there are not too many guests. I hope that the hardware and services will be better next time you stay.

•but
The service is really bad, the hotel is well decorated, luxurious and high-end, especially
It is the water curtain in the hall, which is very shocking. A few questions: 1 Restaurant service
The staff is not familiar with the menu, so I ordered half a meal for my child when dining in a Chinese restaurant
The menu of the western restaurant came over, and I told the need 10 minutes after ordering.
Re-order, the menu is wrong. 2 room hair dryer about 20 years ago
Equipment, the hotel told that only some villa rooms are Dyson hair dryer
machine.
3 Bathroom hygiene problems should be left over from the previous household
Cosmetics etc. 4 Nucleic Acid Hotel 2:00-4:30 pm every day
Provide nucleic acid testing, inquired the night before and informed that only 301 doctors
It can be done in the courtyard, and I took the baby in line for 1 hour. 301..5 Change room front desk
Tell the battery car to arrive, and ask how the child wants to go to the room,
The child said that the battery car, the service staff came and directly led to the arrival on foot
Da, when the child was crying and talking about the battery car on the road, the service staff-
Not a word was said. 6 The water in the room after replacement is not good. After a simple shower, the water is flooded.
The problems are not serious and do not affect the good, but the cost performance and service details
There is indeed room for improvement, especially for children, at the same level or not
At the same price, Banyan Tree and InterContinental are slightly better than Yanlord Crown

There is a sense of ritual everywhere. The morning ceremony at 8:30 in the morning, the afternoon light meal in the afternoon, and the nighttime ceremony in the evening are all very cleverly designed.
As soon as I drove to the gate, I felt a sense of design. When I got off the car and entered the lobby, I was stunned. The star-gazing pool is really a**ospheric. I have never seen such a design in a hotel lobby.
The stay was also very pleasant. Brian, the housekeeper, contacted me shortly after I placed the order and upgraded it to a one-bedroom villa. The entire check-in process was taken care of very well. After entering the room, I was a little surprised. The configuration is in place, with a large bathtub and a swimming pool.
I strolled around the hotel in the afternoon, it is a bit big, but every corner can find more beautiful places. Now there are fewer people and it is very quiet. The sun loungers and parasols provided by the main swimming pool are all Tiffany blue, which is very advanced. The private beach at the back has soft sand, and it is really beautiful with today's sunny day.
It's a pity that the Chinese restaurant Lanting was closed because there were too few guests, otherwise I would really like to try it. Only The Dempsey Western Restaurant is currently open, and coconut water is delicious.
Next time I will stay at Capella again!

msg:I was completely attracted by the environment of Capella to come to Hainan for vacation! It really lived up to expectations 😍😍
Breakfast is now delivered to the room, and we can order the food on the menu at will. Two of us girls ordered a full table and ate them all. The taste is simply amazing, and it is rare to eat really delicious food in a hotel!
🔔Service: The service is so perfect, there will be a housekeeper and WeChat contact before check-in, any questions before check-in can be solved at any time, transportation of nucleic acid, etc., I am connected with Ellie, and sent me the details of the hospital appoin**ent process for nucleic acid . The point is to upgrade the room type with swimming pool for free! I’m so happy, they also gave us coconuts, a friend’s birthday also prepared cakes and refreshments, and there are souvenirs at check-out, full of surprises and gifts, and the night-in ceremony also took us to experience the homemade cocktail service, love Now, thank you Ellie and all the staff~🥰🥰
🍃Environment: Needless to say about the environment, everywhere you go is a landscape, you can shoot a blockbuster, and the light is very good! Design is everywhere in the hotel
🧹Hygiene: Hygiene really needs to be praised. The bedding is very clean. The point is that even the ground is very clean, which is cleaner than at home. It is no problem to walk barefoot.
I really love Capella so much, I must stay again😭😭😭

msg:As the first hotel in our trip to Sanya, Capella is generally satisfied. The most satisfied is because the hotel is very new and the environment is very green. The beach is also good, and it satisfies the children's fun of digging sand. Although there is a children's playground, it is I feel that the beach is the beach and the sea. Secondly, Aria, the hotel's cultural and tourism manager, also contacted us in advance and arranged adjacent rooms for us to facilitate travel. The service is warm and thoughtful, and the hotel breakfast is also very delicate. Every time you travel, you will choose a variety of special hotels. If you ask why it is not 100 points, it is definitely because it is difficult to adjust haha. Then the hotel greening is indeed one of the best in Sanya hotels. If you pursue a quiet and comfortable environment, this is indeed the first choice. Children are also very happy because of the epidemic. We got home late so we stayed again for the last two nights. If you say that the only downside is that I like the little surprises after entry Our travel officer

But as a new hotel, there are also some areas for improvement: the food needs to be further enriched, which is very important. We wanted pizza but were sadly told we didn't have it. As a five-star hotel, it really shouldn't be. Staff training should be further strengthened and standardized. I look forward to Capella getting better and better, and I will consider continuing to stay in the future.

Rico, who received us at the front desk, was very nice. He took care of the trip along the way, helped to book activities, helped to book car transfers, and informed us in advance before each activity started. The breakfast is very rich and delicious!

msg:🔹Thanks to the housekeeper alice for helping us upgrade the room type and presented honeymoon cakes, red wine and bouquets. He also kindly helped me bring afternoon tea to the room.
🔹After learning that I was pregnant, he also thoughtfully helped me prepare a maternity pillow and an anti-constipation drink
🔹There is a door-to-door nucleic acid, which can be done in the room according to the time of the return ticket. It is 100/person. It is a little expensive but saves time. After finishing it, it is worth jumping back to the swimming pool directly.
🔹I missed the peak season + epidemic, the occupancy rate is very low, the experience is very private and quiet, and you can also book a large swimming pool for one person, which is simply enjoyed by the wife.
🔹When I checked out, I gave a small gift of high value, which is much prettier than Addison's

Both cleaning and service are very good, the occupancy rate is very high during the Chinese New Year, the service quality is still undiminished, the preparation activities are very rich, adults, the elderly and children have fun. There is a Tai Chi morning ceremony at 8:30 in the morning, afternoon tea, snacks, drinks, etc. at 3-4 in the afternoon. It is a set prepared. In the Silk Road Restaurant, the quality is not reduced because it is free. Of course, the breakfast is also very exciting. Yes. It really greatly improves the timeliness of the vacation and will not waste time. And after checking in, a message will be sent before the event to remind you what time there are activities or meals, which is very attentive. Thanks to Effy Cultural Tourism Officer, it makes people feel like returning to "Jia".

msg:Sanya Resort Ceiling Capella, this Spring Festival, I stayed at the favorite one of the four hotels. It is indeed very easy to take pictures, and the scenery is very beautiful. The coconut groves and beaches are much more beautiful than Haitang Bay. The room is big enough, and the grades are everywhere. The bedding is very comfortable. I like the design of the washroom and cloakroom, as well as the large open terrace and sea view. The distribution of corridors and guest rooms is very distinctive, making it feel like both a top-level hotel and a private residence. The children's playground is small and exquisite, with many activities and hosting services. The two little friends were very happy to participate in the activities. It's a pity that I didn't have time to arrange the igloo pool and SPA this time. The main swimming pool is the most beautiful design among so many hotels. The color matching and layout have extraordinary thoughts. The only dissatisfaction is that the swimming pool does not provide children's arm rings or swimming rings. The two children changed their clothes and wanted to go into the water to play in the boat. They were told by the staff that they must be carried by adults, otherwise I would buy a swimming ring for 170, which is not much money The problem is that the experience is too bad. Many hotels in Sanya provide these supplies for free. How can I buy them here? 7000+ room fee is still more than a hundred to earn? Even if I didn't have to get on the plane and bought it that afternoon, I really don't want to carry these things around. I hope the swimming pool management depar**ent can improve it! In the end, the children were depressed and changed to the children's small pool in the corner to play. Cocktails in the hotel's parlor bar are delicious and full of a**osphere. To be honest, the taste of Lanting Chinese Restaurant needs to be improved. The taste of the western restaurant is worthy of praise👍 The poolside barbecue looks very fragrant, but the temporary reservation is not in place and the ingredients are a bit small. In the evening, the children experienced catching crabs on the beach. They were really excited to dig small crabs by themselves. Coach A Hai is funny and patient, and he likes it manually. The battery car drivers in the hotel are very nice, and the service staff in the whole hotel are very professional and in place. This time, I would like to thank the cultural and tourism officer Aria for her careful help. She introduced the hotel facilities and activities in great detail, answered any questions, and took care of them. I felt the meticulous service of Capella, and the stay was very comfortable. I will definitely come again next time. Stay a few more days.

msg:On the Hainan side, hotels in Sanya, Lingshui, Wanning, and Wenchang are almost the same. This time I took my baby to stay in Capella as the closing trip, and I am very satisfied.
🌟 When I checked in, the cultural travel officer contacted me in advance. According to my requirements, he set up a play program suitable for my home and arranged a room for me according to my actual situation. Check-in and check-out were personally picked up and responsive. . Super sweet! . (ps. My Wen Hotel is Alice, which is really nice) Encountering a good Wen Hotel will really bring different feelings to the guests. It will also greatly enhance the goodwill of the hotel. The Wen Hotel that Capella met this time really gave me the desire to play with Capella again. Feelings doubled. I also specially upgraded the room for me and my baby, like 👍
🌟 The hotel is worthy of being a designer hotel. From the design, environment, to the scenery and gardens, it gives people a holiday a**osphere. Really beautiful! The mood and a**osphere are also full, and every corner is full of films~
🌟 In terms of food and beverages, the breakfast is quite satisfactory. Advantages: clean and hygienic, juices and beverages are in independent bottles, and salads are also individually packaged. There are staff to help each meal, which also reduces waste, and is safer and more hygienic in the era of epidemic. There are many categories, the coffee is very good, I like Baoluo noodles and beef noodles ~ not enough: the breakfast is the same every day. Some meals can be changed appropriately~
🌟 The parent-child aspect is very good. First of all, there are not many people, the environment is noisy, and there is no need to line up to play. Moreover, there are different activity places for activities and children's playgrounds according to different ages. very good. The children's pool is also very fun, and the main pool is also very suitable for parents and children. There is also a specific area on the beach for the baby to play and coaches guide to catch crabs at night. Super awesome👍
Overall, I am very satisfied with Capella. I will play again in October today. I look forward to meeting my Wen Hotel Alice again, ♥️

All the baby's supplies are arranged in advance, good night snacks are provided intimately, and there are various activity tips, you can play without leaving the hotel. very good.

🚗 Transportation: It is more convenient to travel by car. Although I have experienced the coldest time in Sanya, the whole trip is also more pleasant because of the rich activities.
The Stargazing Pool Morning Ceremony Experience recommends getting up early and punching in, just in time for breakfast, perfect morning time.

The decision to insist on coming to Sanya during the epidemic is not easy, but the hotel provides door-to-door nucleic acid, which is very convenient for us. You can watch foreign channels, but I don't know why BBC and Discovery can't watch them. The hotel offers a variety of activities and experiences that won't be boring without going out. I wish Capella, who is full of cultural sense, will get better and better.

In addition to the morning and night, there are different customized itineraries every day. When planning, the hotel carefully divides it into family activities and ordinary guest activities. The emphasis on children is very rare in today's hotel industry. The unique environment of Sanya makes Capella give its guests the highest sense of vacation. I will wonder if Amber, the cultural and tourism officer of the Little Singapore Hotel, is responsible. The service is from introducing the hotel's opening concept to booking the daily itinerary. The work efficiency is quite high. The day before the check-in, I will take the initiative to contact you to communicate the following itinerary. The last picture is the most worthwhile snow house to experience. Seeing heavy snow is generally very cost-effective. After comparison, this is indeed a better experience than Addison and Atlantis. Highly recommended!

msg:I've been really lucky recently, and the hotels I've traveled a few times have exceeded expectations. It's really a lucky baby. Good luck in the Year of the Tiger...

🚗 Transportation: It takes about 50 minutes from the airport to the hotel on the full highway. The hotel is located in Tufu Bay, and the surrounding facilities have not yet come up, but compared to Haitang Bay, it is really quiet, which is what I like…

The hotel has recently cooperated with Mercedes-Benz New Energy Tram. It can be used for free when you check in. You need to show a driver's license (an electronic driver's license is also acceptable). The use time is 8:00 am to 8:00 pm. You can return the car, there are EQA, EQB , both are off-road vehicles, as well as the sedan EQS. We drove two to go surfing on the Banshan Peninsula, and also sent two Mercedes-Benz sunscreen clothes. The car also prepared the mineral water of the Capella Hotel. The service is super good...

🧹Hygiene:
This is the most frequently cleaned hotel I've ever seen. The auntie is always here to clean up the rubbish, make the bed, add drinks in the refrigerator, turn the night down, etc. It's really clean at all times...

🍃 Environment:
There is no objection to saying that this hotel is the ceiling of Sanya. From the design concept to the details, it is really excellent. Because there are no decent restaurants around the hotel, we basically settled on Silk Road Restaurant, Lanting Chinese Restaurant and The Dempsey for a day. Three meals, the environment of the three restaurants is absolutely amazing...


🔔Service:
Since before check-in, there has been one-to-one service with Miss Sister and WeChat. Almost all needs are met in time. It is very suitable for a lazy person like me. I must give my Miss Sister Aria-Culturist-18689537395 five-star praise…

The hotel has activities from morning to night, which is very suitable for children to play, from the morning ceremony experience of the stargazing pool at 8:30 in the morning, to the activities of the children's park and the adventure park, to the water polo battle in the swimming pool and the catch in the evening Crab children like it very much, except that the price is slightly more expensive than other hotels, but we must recommend the hotel's Paradise Residence suite to you. This hotel suite is divided into spring, summer, autumn and winter. If you can, you must do it before you check in I want to stay in the Winter Palace, the location is excellent, my friend likes the room on the first floor because there is a very large private garden, I prefer the room on the second floor, I feel better privacy, in short, I strongly recommend a more expensive suite, a sense of experience Full marks 💯…

I also strongly recommend the breakfast at the hotel's Silk Road restaurant. You must get up and eat it. The best thing to eat is the hotel's noodles.

Looking forward to meeting Capella again next time...❤️

msg:The price of the ceiling, the experience of the sole of the foot
The hotel is located in Lingshui County, and has already left Sanya City. If Didi wants to take a special or luxury car, it can only locate in Sanya City, and then notify the driver to come.
Stayed two nights at Magnificent and one night at Capella, and also stayed in rooms in the early 5,000s for one night. Capella was much inferior in all aspects.
I checked into the room at 6 o'clock. After entering the room, the turndown has been turned on. When I saw the scene in Figure 5, I felt a little disappointed in the details.
The walkway to the guest room area (Figure 7) has no sense of design...
The overall bathroom facilities in the guest rooms are average, and the top brands are not used. The toilet is even a reduced version of the smart toilet cover…
The sofas on the balcony are full of bugs (Figure 2.3.4), and the privacy is also poor. At night, the next room on the balcony came over and asked me for a cigarette...
Let's talk about check-out. When I checked in, I was told that the flight was leaving Sanya at night, and I hoped that I could check out later. At that time, there was no clear reply after talking to the cultural travel officer. Until the next day, I contacted the cultural travel officer, and the reply was that this room type was full, and I had to check out before 1 o'clock at the latest... To be honest, there is no vacation. The feeling of the hotel. Just ten minutes after one o'clock, the phone came. After three rings, I picked it up and there was no sound. A few minutes later, a staff member came to knock on the door, and he was quite polite. He asked me whether to check out or continue my stay. I said I wanted to check out, and the staff member left very politely. Then came the embarrassing thing, and after about a few minutes, the hotel called again, saying that the staff just learned that you are going to check out, and you are already handling your luggage, right? I answered yes , and then repeatedly asked me what time can I come out? ? It really doesn't feel like a resort hotel!
After checking out, you can only stay on the loungers by the pool. The hotel is not located in front of the village or in the back of the hotel, and there is nowhere to go. The staff chatted loudly by the pool, walked around and patted basketballs there from time to time~ (see the video), what is the standard of the hotel for staff training?
I will not come again. This time I came here just because I felt that Capella's service was very good every time I parked in Shanghai, so I made a special trip to experience it, and I was disappointed! I advise everyone to think twice about booking a room at Capella Sanya. You can get a very good room in Haitang Bay for about 5,000 yuan. In Capella, it is just a very ordinary room, and the brand premium is too serious! ! Stop paying IQ tax in this remote place!

The breakfast may be the richest here in Sanya, and it tastes good. Chinese restaurant dishes are also good, mainly because the service is very good. The western restaurant tastes good and the scenery is beautiful.

The most satisfied is the service of the hotel staff, the attitude is good and the level is high. It should be the service ceiling here in Sanya! Very recommended! ! ! !

msg:Hotel with a very good sense of experience, a must-stay hotel in Sanya, a hotel with good experience in terms of environment, design, hotel facilities and courses, I often book hotels and do not like to write reviews, this hotel must be punched in, the environment is elegant and not like Sanya Bay It will be noisy if there are many people, so don’t worry about it here. Capella is about 15 minutes’ drive from the duty-free shop, and the buy-buy-buy mode starts every minute. The beach is very beautiful, the photos are very good, the spa experience is also very comfortable, and the breakfast is rich , The supporting children's experience center is suitable for children aged 3-10. Children like it very much. There are also crab catching on the beach, afternoon tea, morning wake-up Tai Chi and night cocktail debugging ceremony.

msg:Three times a year to brush Capella 🤣! Capella is worthy of the top brand in Sanya. Every time you come to Capella, from managers to employees, they will say to you with a warm smile: Welcome back to "Jia"! If you like a quiet and private space, it is the best choice for soaking in the sun in a hotel. Compared with the hustle and bustle of Haitang Bay, the environment of Capella can make people completely relax. After getting up lazily every day, open the curtains and you will see the bright sunshine and a wide sea. There is plenty of time to eat a hearty brunch quietly and slowly, from the exquisite afternoon tea every afternoon to the night-opening ceremony in the evening, all of which are what a real leisure vacation should look like. As an island controller who loves sunshine and beaches, because of the epidemic, I can’t go abroad and I’m really going to take Capella as my own. People who are constantly disturbed to take pictures in the hotel, the continuous coastline is very suitable for walking until "the ends of the earth" 😄, and those who like to sunbathe will even have a sense of seeing the private room.
I would like to thank Daniel, the concierge manager, and Alice, the guest relations manager, for this stay. From the first time I came to Capella, I met Daniel, who was a cultural and tourism officer, to this time I learned that he has been promoted to manager because of his hard work. Well, congratulations! When I checked in, because of Danial's vacation, I met the lovely and hearty hot mom Alice warmly received, and I really felt like coming home. During the stay, I received a surprise from Danial, and he enthusiastically helped us book the restaurant. Every day, we will contact us on WeChat to ask if we need help. I felt his warm and caring service throughout the whole process. I came here three times and met many new and old friends one after another. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is as delicious as ever. The restaurant manager, SUE, is so busy that he remembered to send a small dessert specially 😍......
There is always an end to the holiday. Although I am reluctant to leave, it is for the next goodbye. On the day of leaving, Daniel and Alice are waiting specially to say goodbye😊, thank you very much for your warm and meticulous service, see you next time! I will be back 😍

There are early morning, breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails for the night ceremony, which are of good quality. The design of the hotel is very attentive and relatively new. It's worth staying here, especially the housekeeper Refat, who coincides with my husband's birthday on Valentine's Day, and specially prepared a cake, as well as a variety of intimate tracking services, which are especially worthy of praise👍. I should choose this hotel next time I come on vacation.

msg:Capella is the last stop in Sanya
It was really a wise decision to make it the last stop, because its service is so good that I don’t want to go home.
The design of the hotel is still very distinctive, especially the design of the buildings and gardens. Every corner can be seen. The beach coconut grove and lawn can never be seen in person. You can’t experience this beauty. It’s worth taking your time and taking care of it. Experience.
Before check-in, there will be a dedicated butler contacted. Helen, the cultural and tourism officer, will receive us. The service can be said to be meticulous and perfect. At all the moments you need and want, she can appear and solve problems the first time, which can be called the ultimate service.
After check-in, there will be a dedicated cultural and tourism officer who will take you to the room and explain along the way, very meticulous and enthusiastic.
The hotel is very large, but the hotel has a lot of electric frequency cars, to the beach, swimming pool, gym, restaurants are very convenient and fast. There is free afternoon tea at 3 o'clock in the afternoon every day, unlimited supply of pastries and fruit drinks, and a very ceremonial night-in ceremony at 6 o'clock. I like a different cocktail and snacks every night. I like it very much.
The hotel’s pajamas and slippers are very comfortable. My friend likes his slippers very much. I want slippers. I told the cultural and brigade officer Helen about this. Helen gave us two pairs directly, which was really generous.
The second day of our stay happened to be a friend’s birthday. Beauty Helen also gave us cake and red wine. It was a very ceremonial birthday. I gave us a gift when I left the store. It's great to have Helen on this trip!
Next time I have the opportunity to bring my family to experience it again!

msg:This is the first stay. The previous two children (7 years and 9 years old) liked lively hotels with large water parks and large ornamental fish tanks. This time I booked Capella for two days. I came here admiring its overall architecture and landscape, but at the same time I was a little worried that the children would not be used to the relatively private and quiet holiday style. When I came to the lobby for the first time, facing the harmonious circular waterscape design of heaven, earth, people, and yin and yang in the lobby, the children exclaimed "wow" in surprise, which made me a little relieved. After that, all the wonderful experiences began with the greetings from the little brother at the front desk and the cultural and tourism officer Aria. Due to the large number of guests during the New Year period, it is inevitable that there will be some small problems, such as waiting for the room to be cleaned for an extra hour. But often this time the hotel's high quality of service is presented. Aria personally took us to the restaurant for free afternoon tea and snacks, and patiently introduced the hotel services and facilities. An hour passed happily. After moving in, my favorite was the Capella bedding. The quality of the sheets, bedspreads, etc. is superb. The whole resort is very comfortable and clean, and the garden workers are constantly maintaining the greenery. The overall landscape is very well designed. Aria will often come to the message asking if she needs more help with the check-in, and remind us to watch the water tai chi show the next morning. On the second day, the children participated in a whole day of activities with great anticipation, including making "Dream Water Fairy", "Bean Spell Master", "Baking PIZZA", "Li brocade weaving", "Archery", "Zipline" and evening "catch crabs" on the beach. I never thought that the hotel would have such a rich winter camp program! The location of Capella is located in Tufu Bay. Compared with Haitang Bay, the sand is finer and the foot feels more comfortable. The breakfast is very rich, the feature is that what the guests want to eat, what the chef will help you with. This avoids food waste and maintains a good dining environment in the overall restaurant. For this, I appreciate the hotel's management and forward-looking environmental awareness. When we left, Aria gave two special tiger cubs for the Year of the Tiger as a souvenir. I really appreciate Aria's warm service. The children said, we are coming!

On the day before the check-in, the hotel customer service staff called to ask if there were children staying or coming to commemorate the day, which is very considerate! After arriving at the hotel, our cultural and tourism officer Aria also received us very warmly. Since we arrived at the hotel early at 2 pm, aria patiently and carefully told us the layout, facilities and location of the hotel, and took us to enjoy afternoon tea. To pass the waiting time ~ after check-in, a cake was sent! (It's my boyfriend and I's anniversary ❤️) Thank you for the thoughtful aria! Surprise me!
I feel very comfortable and warm after checking in. My favorite is the hotel bedding! Very comfortable! You can go to their spa to buy it ~ the mini bar is free to enjoy except alcohol, diptyque's accessories, and Auluxe's audio have brought more comfort to our vacation this time!
I went to the Lanting Chinese restaurant in the hotel for dinner, which is highly recommended! It was the most satisfying meal of my trip to Sanya! If you are going to eat, remember to book in advance!
In general, Capella is good in terms of facilities, services, and details!

msg:Never been so dissatisfied with a high end hotel. I got the room at three o'clock, and there was a smell of sour rags when I entered. The housekeeper said it was damp and musty. I said that I would ask to change the room. She said that she would discuss with the front desk and call me back then. After ten minutes, there was no sound. After I sent a message, I replied that the front desk would contact me immediately. As a result, I did not receive a call for ten minutes. The front desk contacted me. The front desk said that there was no room. Try the air purifier and aromatherapy, and let me take a look when it's cleaned up there. I said yes. Let me go to dim sum time first. Snack time 3:00-4:00, when I get there there is nothing. When I came back from shopping, I still didn't receive a call to see the room, and I took the initiative to contact the front desk. In the end, I really didn't want to toss and I didn't change the room, but the air purifier had not arrived in my room, so I had to call again to remind me. . If you want to go to the Chinese restaurant of the hotel for dinner, send a message to the housekeeper. She said that there will be no seat until 8:30. I call the Chinese restaurant directly. After I started eating, the butler told me if I had a seat or not. The spa experience included in the reservation package was marked as no reservation required. As a result, we went to the house after dinner and said that it was only open for a few times a day. When we checked in, the housekeeper did not tell us anything. Since I have to go to the airport at 12 o'clock the next day, it was such a waste. After returning to the room, I asked the waiter to send slippers for half an hour. It was even worse at night. I fought against mosquitoes until four in the morning, killing five mosquitoes and biting countless packs on my body. It's a shame to stay in this hotel.

msg:This time I came to Sanya for a total of nine days. At the beginning, there would be some entanglements between Capella and Park Hyatt, but after I checked in, I was really lucky to stay at Capella for a few more days.
Choosing Capella Hotel for the first time For those who often come to Sanya to play, Capella really has nothing to fault, so just close your eyes.

Especially thanks to the cultural and tourism officer Cyan for communicating in advance before moving in, and the duty manager Michelle upgraded the room type for us. And the welcome ceremony we prepared for the children with our two children also made the children particularly happy, sending flowers and red wine, as well as handwritten cards and small farewell gifts. Although the courtesy is light but the affection is heavy, and in terms of service, it can be said to be better than other hotels ❤️

Capella's service is really responsive, and everything wants to be in front of the guests, which makes you feel that this money and that service are completely equal and super value. In addition, the hotel provides you with a sense of existence, not only at home, but also a distinguished guest experience, whether from the hardware facilities, the room service, and the intimate response of the cultural and tourist officials throughout the whole process.

The bedding is too comfortable, there is no sound, and for parents and children, there is really no other choice. In our twin room, the bed is 1.6m big, and there is no problem for a family of four. The landscape of the hotel is also top-notch in Sanya, even if you have stayed in so many luxurious five-star hotels, it is still full of joy. And all customers enjoy administrative trea**ent, afternoon tea and night ceremonies can be enjoyed

In addition, the children's amusement park is also remarkable. The toys are new and clean, and the management is very orderly. Ms. Huang Meiling has been helping me take care of my other baby.
In short, staying in Capella feels that there is no pressure to bring two babies, especially a hotel with a sense of security. I will come back next time!

msg:Honeymoon trip to add happiness🥰 I chose this hotel because I like Capella's garden design and the sense of ritual about the time. It turns out that my choice is too correct. It is really the best resort hotel in Hainan! Before I checked in, I was professionally received by Paris, the manager of Brian on duty at Wen Hotel, and made arrangements for my stay during my stay and made recommendations for activities. I knew that it was the honeymoon that not only arranged cakes and wine, but also upgraded the room type! The 180-degree sea view is very beautiful both day and night! The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the snacks on the minibar are also delicious.

Breakfast: rich variety, good service, a good time in the morning, full score!
Beach: There are plenty of activities, you can play volleyball sailing, the sand is very soft, just lying on the deck chair and blowing the sea breeze is very comfortable
Swimming pool: There is an outdoor swimming pool by the beach and a heated swimming pool in the spa. The environment is very good. The heated swimming pool is highly recommended. You can go to the spa to steam the sauna for swimming, but you need to make an appoin**ent in advance for the sauna and igloo.
Environment: The waterscape of the lobby feels different as the light changes throughout the day. I feel calm when sitting next to it. You can also watch Capella’s unique inauguration ceremony here to start a day full of vitality, gardens It is a step by step scene, very pleasant!
If you have the opportunity to come to Sanya again, I will come to live again, and I will see you again next time!

msg:Overall very good, butler Amber is also very caring. I just want you to be better. So make some suggestions. Gym: I hope that there is a disinfectant next to the equipment to facilitate self-disinfection of the guests after use; or the staff of the equipment can be disinfected immediately after the guests use it, such as yoga mats. Room: The USB interface in the room is only available on the desk, which is not very convenient; Balcony: There are several rooms on the 102nd floor, the balcony 1021 and 1020 are not partitioned, they are relatively spacious, but the privacy is average, it is recommended to put some partitions in the middle of the balcony. Dining: The restaurant tastes good, especially the Chinese food, which is highly praised and delicious. However, there are still some suggestions on the service, such as: there are many people at breakfast, and if the guests order coffee if they are too busy, it is recommended to euphemistically explain to the guests that they are too busy to help the guests to take them, and it is a bit blunt to simply refuse; The training of western food waiters needs to be strengthened. To see the needs of guests, such as a table with many children, it is necessary to pay attention to whether it is necessary to increase the sauce of french fries. The partition management of waiters should be emphasized again. Often waiters are concentrated together, and guests who need to serve will not find anyone. This estimate is related to the tension of the Spring Festival personnel. Swimming pool article; I saw that the lifeguard position next to the swimming pool in the gym was a waiter, dressed in formal clothes, but I hoped that it would not be a mere formality. This is very important. Map: The hotel is a very wide area, especially the exits in the lobby, think of a way to prevent the guests from getting dizzy😵😄. Courtesy article: The hotel has a lot of personalized services. I have seen beach dinners, swimming pool barbecues, and bar special stories. I still recommend it to guests to promote consumption.

The lobby of the hotel is definitely the ceiling of a domestic hotel. Only On behalf of personal opinion, the cultural and tourism officer in charge of our hotel this time is Aria. He contacted us before we arrived at the hotel and asked us what we needed for the room. After we arrived at the hotel, the arrangement was very good, because we had to stay in the hotel. I took pictures in the store. My lover wants to wear makeup and needs something temporarily. Aria has been helping us contact the one who bought it. I am really touched.

We haven't slept yet, help us arrange, and the team, Zhejiang master Li Hongliang, took us to Haitang Bay, almost went to the hospital in the city, and the pharmacies along the way also took them one by one, which really touched me. The staff here makes me feel at ease and at ease, and the sense of security is particularly strong. Usually there is nothing special and the feeling is not so strong. When the child is sick, their sense of service is absolutely reflected!

After checking in, the room type is very comfortable, the design is reasonable, a**ospheric and spacious, the construction is careful, high-quality, good materials, the bathtub is very large, the big man does not need to feel uncomfortable, the bed is super large, and the bathroom also has a sense of space.
The garden is designed with a setback, mainly water features, crafted everywhere, finely crafted, the garden is full of greenery, there are many flowers, the beach is soft, and the sea view is right in front of you. The swimming pool has clean water, suitable temperature, and is a good choice for indoor and outdoor.
There is Tai Chi at 8:30 in the morning, afternoon tea at 3:30 in the afternoon, and cocktails, red and white wine at 6:30 in the evening, all for free!
Breakfast is rich, healthy, nutritious, and looks good!
We ate lunch and dinner at the same restaurant, both outdoors, with a view of the water and the beach, our family felt like a vacation. The cost of a meal is between 350-800. We only ordered meat and vegetables because of the free super good bread: I recommend the Caesar salad, the pan-fried salmon combo. During the period, the restaurant also sent avocado and broccoli to the baby.
The afternoon tea at 3:30 pm is macarons, durian buns and small cakes, plus a fruit cup, chicken nuggets with fruit tea, coffee and more.
6:30 pm is a rum base cocktail, red and white wine (sparkling/non-sparkling) and snacks such as roasted cashews with skins. We had the pleasure of sitting in the outdoor core area with a view of the water and the beach.
On the first day of the outdoor swimming pool, it was cool, romantic and happy, all kinds of photos (for the baby and the person holding the baby), I liked the big bed in the pool, and the baby climbed up and down. On the second day, the indoor swimming pool, unique design, you can not bask in the sun, and you can breathe fresh air. By the way, we visited the igloo and sauna.
I also played in the children's center. There is a percussion instrument that can't be named, and the music blind can play a song, haha. Love the door made by the giraffe!
Before leaving, I visited the pool villa, which is also a classic!
Thanks again to Effy and to the owners and management team of Capella for making this a wonderful holiday. We will come again!

The housekeeper refat contacted me the day before check-in and informed me of the hotel's basic information in advance. Do I need a meal ordering service? Need a pre-booked activity for kids? Very patient and meticulous. Great service! Thanks for the recommendation!

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Felix, the cultural and tourism officer, kindly introduced us to all the facilities of the hotel. The room is also very big, and we also prepared sweet cookies and candies for our little sister, who is very happy. Experienced the Fangxiang SPA in the spa. The environmental facilities are very comfortable. There is also Chibian Western Restaurant we went to eat in the evening. The environment is very nice and the taste is not bad. My favorite is the afternoon tea at 3-4 o'clock. The desserts are especially delicious. -You can also taste red wine and cocktails at 7 o'clock, because my husband doesn't like drinking and didn't taste it. I will try it next time. These are all included in the room rate~ Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Capella. When I finally checked out, Felix also gave me a gift for leaving the store, and the children were very happy. It is really a hotel with caring service everywhere. Really good experience ~ recommended ~

msg:Capella is indeed a great hotel, from design, hardware to service, it reflects the first-class standards. The first is the hotel design, which draws on Southeast Asian elements as a whole, with symbols such as Fujian earth buildings, terraced fields, Tai Chi culture, etc. It is comfortable, a**ospheric, and very aesthetic. The ordinary room type can reach 88 square meters, fully considering the comfort needs of vacation. There are many activities in the hotel. Afternoon tea, wine tasting and igloo experience are very interesting. The hotel's breakfast is very good, with high quality and good taste. Personally, I think the bread is very well made. Although every hotel has western pastries, Capella's pastries must be praised. The most worth mentioning is the thoughtful and cordial service. The guests who check in have their own butler. Our housekeeper this time is Fengzheng. From the greetings before the check-in, to the daily activity arrangement, ordering meals, etc., they are very meticulous and professional. There are small gifts, and there are practical and cute little gifts such as water cups, backpacks, etc. 🎁

🍃Environment: Those who like the resort style will probably like it here. It covers a large area and has a large room area. I especially like the hotel's beach and lawn coconut grove, which is beautiful! Check in to an upgraded garden view suite! It's too excellent and beautiful, and it's beautiful when you enter the door! The double bed is big enough to sleep four people

🔔Service: Someone will call in advance to communicate their needs, and a dedicated cultural and tourism officer will be assigned to be responsible for the entire service of your hotel stay. My amber is so nice. From WeChat, check-in, to check-out one day in advance, everything is thoughtful and comfortable. I really like this kind of close distance. Finally, I would like to thank Amber for the small parting gift, Capella's cute little starfish doll and reusable bag, I really love it ❤️

Enjoy sumptuous mini bar snacks and soft drinks Capella is probably raising pigs 😂 You are not allowed to leave without feeding fat! Afternoon tea was great, everything was delicious! I also liked the happyhour breakfast in the evening! The details are awesome!

The hotel gym is so well equipped. I love it so much!
Overall very satisfied! Will definitely come again

msg:To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I stayed at Capella this time, because I was looking forward to reading the recommendations on the Internet and my friends before I moved in. However, after I moved in, there were many accidents. To sum up, the management still needs to be strengthened. Let’s talk about the shortcomings first. Advantages, in addition to the management, the sense of service needs to be strengthened. When the child accidentally broke the bottle during the morning meal, the waiter came over to clean up and left with a blank face. In fact, it doesn't matter if you can add a kind word, the child is alright, the child will be less psychologically so. Panic, the male waiter in the bath directly opened the door and put things in at night. Maybe we didn’t hear the doorbell, which led to the embarrassing scene of us wearing bathrobes. If you can call and ask if someone is in a position and scene that may be better able to stand on the guest, In addition, at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, we and our children both fell asleep. We rang the doorbell in a hurry, opened the door, and the waiter sent something to the wrong room. Then we said that it wasn't what we ordered. The waiter paid attention to the next sentence. We are left in astonishment. When encountering other things, the service personnel are also incapable of adapting. The first time is Muna at the scene, similar to these and so on. I will not talk about other hidden problems, but talk about the advantages. This time our cultural travel officer is Aria, the only thing that makes us feel very warm and worthy. He has always been patient and attentive in helping us solve problems. He is very kind, and also carefully introduced us all kinds of hotels. The day before we didn't check into the hotel, we arranged the next day's reservation for us until late at night. There were cute little surprises when we checked in and when we checked out. When I was injured, she even bought a band-aid for me and sent it to me, very Thanks to her, the hotel's garden scenery is very good, I think it is because of other hotels, the room size is very large, the morning viewing ceremony in the morning is very worth seeing, very ceremonial, the igloo in the spa is also very special , it is worth a visit, it is not available in other hotels, the swimming pool area is also very large, except for the many corners and corners, there is no problem, the night ceremony is also very comfortable, the scenery is very comfortable and beautiful, and it is worth One of the places to be praised is the Children's Club. It can be seen that they are very attentive and the facilities are very well done. It is not the kind of hasty work. The children liked a young lady named Meimei very much this time, and took them to catch crabs. I caught a few. The next day, because Teacher Meimei was away, the children didn't want to catch crabs. To sum up, if the overall service training can be improved, Capella is still worth staying in, but the overall quality of the service staff varies. The aspect is that the price of this hotel is a bit inconsistent.

I took the initiative to send us baby’s washes, bathrobes and slippers. It’s so heart-warming. Every employee of the hotel will take the initiative to greet the guests. I brought my children to stay here, and the children had a great time here. This time I checked in the kids club that I didn't go to before, and the children also had a place to play on typhoon days. The night entrance ceremony is my family's favorite. You can drink and drink while watching the night lights. The ceremony is full of sense. Breakfast can be reached until 11 o'clock, so you don’t have to hurry up. The beach of Capella is my favorite among all the hotels I have stayed in Sanya. Unfortunately, I encountered a typhoon this time. Otherwise, she must be very happy to take the children to catch crabs at sunset. In general, I personally feel that Capella’s beaches are more suitable for families or couples than those in Haitang Bay. Every time I stay at Capella, I am very happy, thank you Miss Amber for her meticulousness and thoughtfulness🥰

msg:This trip to Sanya once again chose to stay at Capella Hotel. Although there was a little episode at the beginning, it was resolved happily in the end. I would like to thank Amber, the cultural and tourism officer of the hotel, for the proper arrangement for our trip. The hotel's food and beverages are quite good, whether Chinese or Western. Compared with other hotels, Western food is more authentic, and there is no feeling of being neither local nor foreign. The breakfast is also very rich and the ingredients are fresh. It is best to avoid the peak of the meal, so you can take pictures by the window. It is recommended to try the local Baoluo noodles. If the room has a yard, the hotel can arrange a barbecue party for more than 4 people. The fee includes tax and service charge, starting from 1700 per person. Not only will some people bake and eat it, but the hotel will also help to arrange the table with flowers and lights. If you have a few friends It's quite romantic to eat like this. The SPA service is very good, but the massage technique feels average 😂
In addition, the hotel has a shop to buy swimsuits and beach shorts, which are very nice. It doesn't matter if you forget to bring a swimsuit. Be sure to go to the beach in Capella. The sand is very fine, there is little garbage, and it is still very clean. You can see the sunset by the sea around 5-6 o'clock. At this time, it is not very sunny and you can see the beautiful scenery. There are also motorboats and sailboats by the sea, but we didn't experience it this time. If there are children, there is a children's playground indoors, an adventure playground and a children's water park outdoors (the two are next to each other), but these are relatively small, and it is recommended to add more items or areas that children can play. Maybe Capella is still suitable for couples or friends 😅
Finally, let's talk about the shortcomings. The cleaning speed of the room can really be faster, otherwise it is easy to delay the customer's next trip if you can't check in on time. It is also best not to cooperate with third parties to engage in "free" project routine customers. If you want to cooperate, you should also look at the quality of the third party, otherwise the experience will be bad and the quality of Capella will be lowered.
In general, I am very satisfied with this trip. Going to Sanya Capella is still the first choice. Thanks again to Amber for his care and support for our trip, professional and thoughtful.

But this time I must write a good review. Capella currently absolutely represents the highest level of Sanya hotels. This is an evaluation of comprehensive capabilities. Regardless of service, meals, rooms, design sense, a**osphere sense, all latitudes are comfortable and top-notch. On vacation, all you need is to eat well, play well, and sleep well. Capella gives me this feeling as a family. 🔔Service: Special thanks to Manager Liu Xiaohui for the meticulous and personal accompaniment service from the booking a month ago to the end of the trip, which made our family feel the most relaxing vacation time. Finally, I sincerely recommend that you come to Sanya to live in Capella. If you are staying in several hotels, you must also leave Capella at the end, otherwise other hotels cannot stay, which affects your mood. I have had this experience. Our whole family In the future, I will only live in Capella in Sanya.

The hotel is undoubtedly the best hotel in Sanya in terms of hardware and services. The children are very satisfied and there are many places to play. Aria, the receptionist at the hotel, and Miss Huang Meining from the Kids Club both left a very deep impression on us. Every day, the two little girls went to the Kids Club to play with Miss Huang. Digging crabs with the hotel staff in the evening also made the little sisters happy.

What exceeded expectations was that the hotel also made an appoin**ent for a full-day test drive of a Mercedes-Benz electric car EQS580 that has not yet been launched. It is full of power and has an excellent driving experience. Both the hotel and the car are worth recommending. If there is one drawback, the prices are really not cheap these days. During the Chris**as month, families from international schools were involved in getting a sea view room for nearly 5,000 yuan a night.

All in all, praise and recommendation.

From the morning opening ceremony, to the very rich breakfast that can be eaten until 11 o'clock, then the dessert in the afternoon, and the cocktails of the evening ceremony, it is an experience not to be missed. The morning rides and the afternoon fishing and spa are especially recommended, all of which are different to try. The design of the Capella living room instead of other hotel executive lounges is more interesting and intimate, and the beauty of the public area is enough to make people linger over and over again. Thank you very much to Alice and Ellie, the cultural and tourism officers, all questions can be answered and solved in a timely and detailed manner. In addition, it was very pleasant to chat with the staff of the hotel, and I hope to have the opportunity to experience Capella again next time.

msg:Take advantage of the school holiday to go to Sanya Capella to escape the dampness of Shanghai. The hotels in Sanya have been to the Edison, St. Regis, Marriott, Ritz Carlton, Club Med, MGM, Raffles before. Service, food, and hotel hardware are always unsatisfactory. For the most popular Addison, the hardware is good, the food is good, the location is good, and the service is okay. However, there are more than 1,000 rooms in the hotel, and the service cannot be too detailed. During the hot breakfast season, there are often queues. Several popular restaurants can't eat without ordering a few days in advance.

Before booking Capella this time, I was actually a bit hesitant, because the location is in Tofu Bay, which is not as lively as Haitang Bay. If the hotel’s own restaurant does not have enough food and beverage water, it is inconvenient to take children to eat outside. Moved in with a little hesitation. After experiencing it, it really is a worthwhile trip!

First of all, Capella itself is not very big, and the number of guest rooms is controlled at around one hundred and ninety. So there will be no noise in big hotels, and the service is more meticulous!

Besides catering, the breakfast is exquisite and quality online! The afternoon tea from 3 to 4 pm is delicious, but it would be better if you can remove the soft candies. The price of the soft candies in the afternoon tea is a bit lower. In addition, it is recommended to provide soft drinks or juices suitable for children in the afternoon tea. After all, many are Parent-child outing. The bar offers soft drinks and snacks throughout the day from 11 to 6 o'clock, and drinks and snacks from 6 to 7 in the evening. There are also concerts on site, and the a**osphere is good! The Chinese restaurant and western restaurant are also good. Soaking in the hotel all day is no problem.

The hardware part, because it is a new hotel, so the hardware is not a problem. Because it is a parent-child trip, I pay more attention to the parent-child facilities part. Capella does a very good job in this part. It has three parks for children to play. The younger ones can go to the kids club, the older ones can go to the adventure park, and the younger ones can go to the water park. Both the kids club and the adventure park are divided into indoor and outdoor areas. It will be open until 6 o'clock if it doesn't rain, and the staff said it will be extended to 8 o'clock if it rains. Kids club has awnings in the sand digging area and slide area to prevent children from being exposed to the sun. This is really intimate and friendly. Most of the hotel’s outdoor children’s playgrounds do not take this into consideration. Moreover, the indoor facilities are not as good-looking as many hotels, but the playability is not good. In places where I can't take pictures, I saw that they also have badminton, table tennis, and various chess sets that can be used. Really recommend a parent-child trip to experience.

Service part: It should be said that it is the ceiling of Sanya hotel so far. Most of the staff will try their best to assist hotel guests and make you feel at home. For example, catching crabs on the beach, here every night, and not one or two employees take a group of people, but one-to-one service, it is a pity that I did not remember the name of the little girl who took us to dig crabs that day. It's really hard work!

In addition, the real-name recognition of Tony Wang of Adventure Park, he gave full play to Capella's service spirit. Very enthusiastic to take the children to play cars, play chess, play with water guns, and pick coconuts. Very patient. It can be compared to the GO of beautiful club med. I heard that there are custody services for winter and summer vacations. The kids hope to see Uncle Tony again when that time comes! The elder sister in the children's playground (forgot to ask for the name) is also very active and enthusiastic to play with the children. This is the warmth I can't experience in other hotels. This makes Capella a hotel like no other.

As for my cultural and tourism officer, Helen, I also want to be praised by name. She tried her best to solve my problems in various aspects of the accommodation, such as mosquito elimination, restaurant reservations, sanitary equipment maintenance, and so on.

Another suggestion is that the octopus in the penultimate picture is a flushing facility next to the kids club sand pit. It is recommended to repair and resume use, because after playing in the sand pit, it needs to be flushed and cleaned. The last one is a water supply facility in the bunkers. The bunkers abroad have water. The original intention was that children with running water could pile sand, but dry sand could not make a castle. Of course, it may increase management difficulties when there is water, so this function is currently disabled, and only the staff can use it when washing toys. What a pity!

Finally, I really recommend parents and children to experience Capella. When the epidemic slows down, I also hope to experience Capella hotels in other countries!

Even the eldest sister who cleans the room is very polite. The food in the restaurant is very delicious. I like the daily breakfast at the Silk Road Restaurant.

msg:I stayed at the Capella Hotel for two nights. The handsome guy at the front desk on the day of check-in understood my needs in detail and made an upgrade for me. He told me in more detail that the room faces the sea, but it will also be close to the construction site on the right. Away from this construction site, I can transfer to another room with a lower floor. In the end, I chose a higher floor with a better view, even if there is a construction site next to it! Thank you very much for the patience and professional service of this handsome guy!

I enjoyed the dinner at the Lanting Restaurant at the hotel. The price is a bit more expensive: a Hainanese chicken, a sweet and sour pork, and an eggplant clay pot with a total of three dishes plus two bowls of white rice, which is almost 700 yuan, but the taste is pretty good.

The beach and swimming pool of the hotel are very nice, with blue parasols, unique style.

All hotel guests can enjoy the afternoon tea at the Silk Road Restaurant and the sunset ceremony in the evening! The outdoor viewing round table for the sunset ceremony is only a few tables. Fortunately, the butler Helen booked for me in advance. You can taste the complimentary red wine and snacks while watching the beautiful scenery of the sky!

The characteristic of the hotel lies in the garden, beach and swimming pool. The hotel can enjoy the charming tropical scenery and enjoy a relaxing afternoon lazy time!

Special mention is the buffet breakfast every morning. The ingredients are rich, and the key is to be very careful. All the ingredients, salad vegetables, juice, yogurt, and nuts are filled in beautiful small glass bottles. Guests can take a bottle of what they like. Especially clean, hygienic and exquisite fashion. During the epidemic, this buffet style is worthy of praise.

Summary: The hotel’s external environment settings are quite good, but the designer only pays attention to the beauty of the external environment, but the interior design of the room is a bit inadequate. In order to highlight the beauty of the building, we do not hesitate to sacrifice the perception of the customers in the room, such as in the manor. In the building, in order to create a Chinese-style architectural beauty, the long eaves corners block the view of the sea from the guests in several rooms. In addition, the layout of the room is also improper. For example, the large closet is placed next to the bathtub, the bathtub cannot see the sea view, and the bathtub drainage device is not done well. It is easy to get wet around the closet. Such a large space is not used well. , And there is no separation of dry and wet! It can be seen that the focus of this hotel only focuses on the design of the garden beach swimming pool, ignoring the demand for the room landscape as a resort hotel guest.

The hotel’s butler service is good. I would like to praise the handsome check-in guy at the front desk and the butler, Helen, who is professional and careful, thinks about what customers think, and has a high quality of service.

msg:After booking the hotel, there was a butler and WeChat and I felt very considerate. Now many hotels have this service, because it is the wedding anniversary and asked the butler if there are any special arrangements and surprises that can be arranged. The result is that there is nothing. This makes me very Disappointed, it's okay to give a cake and flowers later, it's better than nothing!

The lobby of the hotel is very special and it feels bright when you first arrive!
We arrived at the hotel at about 1:00 in the middle of the night. The hotel is almost an hour away from the airport. There is only one waiter in the hotel. There is no welcome ceremony. This is very disappointing as the beginning of the holiday. I don't know if it is too late.

When I opened the room, I talked about a lot of hotel activities and I didn’t remember well. It’s better to print out the activity schedule.

The attendant delivering the luggage also said about hotel activities. This should be the content of the training. I don’t want to listen to it most of the night! The waiter wanted to take us back to the room. Fortunately, I read the map of the hotel in advance. The development of the hotel is very big. I asked to take the car back to the room! It takes at least ten minutes to walk back! We were all exhausted when we arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night and let us walk so far with our luggage! The first feeling is that the hotel staff are like trainees who have just been trained and have no sense of service at all!

It really took a long way to get up to eat breakfast the next day. Anyway, it takes ten minutes to get in and out of the room. Basically, it takes more than 10,000 steps a day in the hotel, so it is especially inconvenient!
The taste of breakfast can only be said to be so-so! Not as good as stated on the Internet!

The attitude of the waiter on the beach is too bad. It seems that someone else is stealing a bath towel. Yes, you need to register the room number and other information!
There was no waiter on the seat on the beach to ask or order something to drink. Fortunately, I brought some in my room! Only the doorbell on the pool seat can call the waiter!
Anyway, we didn't get the vacation service we wanted! Negative Ratings! ! !
Swimming is not allowed in the sea, but this is a government regulation and there is no way!


Let the private butler help us order dinner for western food and then give the cakes and flowers during the meal. When I arrived in the restaurant, I suddenly found that there was a table that was well arranged, there were balloons, candles and shells that made my eyes shine, but it turned out not to be our table. Our table has no layout beside it! ! ! This makes people very angry! ! ! Why can others have arrangements? We don’t! And I even asked the butler specifically, what am I going to do with a butler! Complete dereliction of duty! ! ! Saw my complaint. Now let the waiter come over and tell me that if I want to, I can only give me a balloon or something! ! ! Really vulgar service attitude. Does no one in this hotel understand customers? ? ? What customers want is not your free gift, but an experience and surprise! ! !
Later, I stopped contacting the housekeeper anymore. It makes no difference whether there is her or not!
In addition, someone called the room and asked me if I was satisfied with the hotel service. I said about the problem I encountered, but I didn't see any change or remedy for them! This is even more disappointing. You might as well not make this call! Hahaha!

Troubled hotel managers to reflect on it! ! !


Let's talk about it, there are many free services that are better than other hotels:
The departure ceremony is very sensational. Every morning at 8:30 in the morning, listening to music and watching Tai Chi.
The minibar in the room is free to taste.
Dim sum is also provided for afternoon tea.
There is an aperitif ceremony at 18:00 in the evening. It is nice to have a drink before eating.

🍃Environment: The overall hotel is very design
The swimming pool is very comfortable, very large, and the design is very special, you can play basketball

🧹Hygienic: The guest room is cleaned very cleanly. The room attendant is very caring. Seeing that my clothes have no place to dry, I deliberately went to get the drying rack. In fact, this hotel should be considered in advance!

Food: Western food tastes good, but I didn’t say the kind that is particularly amazing, the service is relatively poor
Chinese food tastes very good. A la carte and set menus are delicious. The service is also very good. The waiters are more experienced and will recommend dishes reasonably and enthusiastically.

In the past two years of the epidemic, I have taken my baby and myself to Sanya for vacations nearly 10 times. Basically, the newly opened ones with good reputation and good quality have stayed in a circle. Capella is really a leader, so that every fall and winter will choose to come to Sanya for a few days for vacation.
This time, the cultural and brigade officer Alice received us. The service can be said to be meticulous and perfect. At all the moments you need and want, she can appear and solve problems the first time. It can be called the ultimate service.
And Capella's hardware and catering make you not even want to leave the hotel door, and the hotel will not be very noisy and messy. Everything is in order, everything is just right.
I think I will come to Sanya again next year for Capella~

My butler, Alex, is very conscientious. He sent me the hotel's arrangements, restaurants, and event time the day before I went. I directly booked a western restaurant, SPA, etc. My parents came to live for a day, and the arrangements were made properly. In order for us to stay closer, they also upgraded the room specially. The parents went to the store to accompany us all the way to introduce them, and they were sent to the beach all the way to meet us after check-in. It was very thoughtful. .
The supporting facilities near Tufu Bay are not perfect, and the hotel’s meals are very good. My 3 days and 2 nights were resolved in the hotel. The breakfast is rich, there are free afternoon tea, wine and snacks in the bar, I am very satisfied.
Capella is very suitable for taking a family holiday. The private beach is also very relaxing. Coconut Grove Beach is very relaxing. Recommend to experience SPA.

I think this is one of the best services I have experienced in China
For me, I don’t need to be too warm, as if there is no privacy in front of them, I don’t need to send cards and dolls to Bvlgari toiletry gift boxes like some hotels in Sanya, but it is cold as if the kpi is completed.
Capella's feeling is really at home
Everything is just right, like autumn sunshine, warm but not dry
It’s worth mentioning that coming out of the main swimming pool, it was cold and dripping in a wet yukata and met an older employee who looked a bit older (not like a battery car brother). He should have something to go to somewhere but saw After we turned back halfway and asked if we need to deliver to the room. I gladly arrived. He also specially reminded me that the elevator car is on the right hand (maybe I look completely stunned). I felt very good. Say goodbye to a friend before leaving
The other is the smile of Lisa from the housekeeping depar**ent is simply warm! Particularly patiently inquiring about the shortcomings of the room to make up for the first time
Chat with singers at the night-in ceremony, listen to Freya’s story, make a cocktail, everything’s perfect!
What is worth improving is the happy hour staff because the first time I went there, I thought I didn’t have self-help. I didn’t sit at the table obediently and waited. I looked around with a heart of exploration. I was impatient when I met a little brother and said that you just sit and wait. Too friendly, others are very good and will come again

Capella's service is very good. Starting from the hotel pick-up, the driver held a sign to greet us at the exit of the airport, instead of asking us to come out and look for it like other hotels.
The hotel cultural and tourism officer Felix is very caring. We arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock in the evening, and he has been waiting here to help check in and introduce hotel related services. The interesting thing is that there is a charge for the liquor in the room’s minibar, and the hotel’s breakfast and evening cocktail parties provide free liquor. The kind of tube that is enough, this is for everyone to come out and drink together, a variety of cocktails, champagne, red and white wine, etc. Keep the journey in a slightly drunken state, especially suitable for friends who want to drink. Breakfast and afternoon tea were very rich, and I was full before I knew it. Dinner is free to eat or not, and it's after eight o'clock. The western restaurant tastes very good. The lobby patio of the hotel is a highlight, suitable for lying in a daze, especially when it is raining, it is beautiful.
In general, Capella allows people to stay in the hotel to play, stay in a drunken state at all times, without leaving the hotel, much like the resort hotel in the Maldives, the service of the cultural travel officer Felix is very caring and very good! We will come again!

Before staying in, the cultural and tourism officer kris added WeChat to introduce the hotel’s available projects and any questions you need to know. It can be said to be very considerate, and a honeymoon is also given. Cake and flowers (mousse cake is super delicious)
The breakfast at Capella itself is very rich. It lasts from morning to 11. It can be said that you can sleep in and eat again. There is afternoon tea time in the afternoon, there is a night ceremony in the evening, and there is no time to experience the free spa area. Hope to have a chance next time.

🚗 Transportation: The transportation is relatively inconvenient. It is a 20-minute drive from Haitang Bay, but because of this, the hotel also has a quieter vacation. So we chose to eat in the hotel. The hotel currently has only one Chinese restaurant and one Western restaurant. We went to the Western restaurant and the bread before the meal was delicious!

🍃Environment: The environment is really good for taking pictures, and it feels like a modern and Chinese garden as a whole.

🔔Service: The service can be said to be very good. Every employee who sees you will say hi and smile to you. When they see you pushing your luggage out, they will promptly ask to help you carry your luggage. When you see you waiting downstairs, they will ask if To call a car, the overall feeling is very pleasant.

msg:Sanya's most suitable hotel for vacation! Five-star praise

The designer hotel is embodied in every hard decoration material, which is very textured.
The hotel’s services are worthy of special mention: free afternoon tea at 3-4 pm every day, cocktails in the living room at 6-7 pm, and one-to-one butler service. te bie gan xie helped me take many beautiful photos throughout the process. Help me to check out late~ The facilities can continue to be used after check out.
The most favorite is the swimming pool here, the water quality and temperature are very good
In terms of catering, there is nothing wrong with it, there are many types, and the products are good!

I heard that we need a nucleic acid report and contacted the doctor to take a sample. Amber-Culturist is very enthusiastic and meticulous, and the details are extremely comfortable!

msg:🚗 Transportation: It takes about 30 minutes by car from Addison.

🧹Sanitation: Everywhere is very clean, and there are many butler service staff.

🍃Environment: Unlike the Edison, the main style of their hotel is based on the new Chinese architectural style. The overall garden creates an environment very suitable for vacations, and the beach is very clean. Grandpa and grandma who love to study various plants are also very happy to go shopping.

🔔Service: Because I was traveling with my family, when we checked in, we asked Eugene and Helen to add the WeChat of the hotel's cultural and tourism officials. You can find them if you have any questions during the whole process. The service is really in place. It also took up a lot of time for my little sister to accompany me to take pictures and walk around the entire hotel. The people are very nice! Very nice! Looking forward to seeing you next time☺️
🍴Restaurant: Regarding the food, we tasted the Chinese restaurant Lanting and the western restaurant The Dempesy, both of them were delicious, and they were both very cost-effective. Afternoon tea and breakfast are delicious, the service is in place, and the isolation work is done very well. Since Capella's location is not in Haitang Bay, it has not been considered to go out to eat elsewhere. Both restaurants are very good, I suggest that everyone can check in.

2: The spa delivered by the package is the best early, with few people, quiet, good environment, good
3: The breakfast at the hotel is okay, I got up early to ride a bicycle in the countryside near the hotel, and then went to eat breakfast, very full
4: The hotel’s afternoon tea and honeymoon cakes are slightly inadequate. Afternoon tea is a bit low and it is not delicious. The honeymoon cakes also need to be improved!
Overall it feels good!

This time I was received by the gentle Alice 😘 reminded me of hotel activities in time, and booked me a spa experience in advance. I must try the snow house. This trip is to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Alice prepared cakes in advance and booked for me. The location of the restaurant is very intimate. I responded promptly to inquiries during my stay, and provided reference for the surrounding entertainment projects 👍🏻 Every employee of the hotel greeted the guests with a smile. Since getting off the car and stepping into the hotel, the concierge can already say the guest’s name. All depar**ents communicate in place. If you can make the details better, it will be perfect, such as the mirror maintenance of the shower room, the manual hanging bar in the closet (it's a bit heavy).

msg:This time the five majors and one elementary school had an unforgettable holiday in Capella. The baby was just one year old and wanted to find a hotel for a quiet holiday for an anniversary. Coupled with the epidemic and rain, I didn't go to the scenic spots and duty-free shops in Sanya this time. I spent two days in the hotel. Even without the blessing of sunlight, the colors and scenery of Capella are still amazing, really one step at a time. Cyan, the young lady of the cultural brigade officer, added WeChat in advance, and she worked hard to help the guests solve their problems during the whole process. Before leaving, she also prepared small gifts for the baby and our family with special care. This time I upgraded to the suite of Le Shuiju, I would recommend a large bed, the view is very beautiful, and the bathtub is also big. The hotel’s activities are actually quite rich, but the outdoor activities are not affected by the weather. When the baby gets older, come join the Little Star Club activities! Morning ceremony, night ritual, evening cocktail time ~ full of ritual~ In short, under the epidemic situation, you can't go out of the country and come to Sanya for vacation. If you want to avoid the crowds, Capella is the first choice~

msg:In fact, it is very simple to comment on this hotel. It is a beautiful hotel without blind spots. The designer has taken care of every detail and played the dynamics of the water to the extreme. It will not be ugly for you to shoot casually, and the rare room is also extremely functional. This time I experienced the suite and the ordinary room, they are all very good!
Regarding hotel services, as long as they are clearly requested, they are responsive. My housekeeper, Kris, is very helpful. Young people are so patient and gratifying!
What is rare is that the hotel has gone a step further on the basis of general resort hotels. They figured out a way to arrange some morning and evening schedules, practicing Tai Chi and talking about the Silk Road, nothing more than making the guests less bored. This approach is similar to cruise ships. It’s worth promoting. Many people don’t know how to spend a day efficiently and interestingly.
The hotel's catering is the first Chinese restaurant. The cooking is really energy, which is called eating! The western food is not satisfactory from the materials to the service and needs to be improved!
The breakfast and afternoon tea in this hotel avoid a lot of waste! Worthy of praise!
The hotel staff are very hardworking. When I don’t go to the spa, I feel that the waiters tend to ignore them. Didn’t the hotel ask the staff to greet the guests?
Thanks again to the room attendants, they are so busy and sweaty every day that it is not easy to ensure the sanitation of the room!
This beautiful hotel hopes to continue!

The hotel is not big, but step by step, the perfect explanation is small and precise. There are many types of breakfast, and the taste is good. It has been raining for the past few days, and I took a walk to the spa, and the technique is also very good. And the most important point is that the bedding is really too comfortable. I am a person who needs to bring my own bedding when I go out. I didn't expect the hotel's own bedding to be incredibly comfortable. What needs to be mentioned is that every staff member in the hotel is very friendly, and the service has nothing to say. Special thanks to Alex. Before leaving the ring and lost the room, he made a special trip to search for it and finally found it. Thanks to Alex for his dedication. Overall the experience is very good, I will still come in the future

msg:After traveling with a baby and choosing a parent-child hotel for two nights, I wanted to choose a hotel that would give me peace of mind. After comparison, I chose Capella.
The design of the hotel is amazing, the rain screen comes in quite shocking, the room is partial to Chinese style, and every shot is a blockbuster
As for service, I think it depends on the individual. Because of the rain, they are all mixed up in the bar lobby and restaurant. I saw a lot of tourists and staff, and some cultural and tourism officials are particularly responsible for introducing guests to each one when they introduce the hotel. The place, there is this kind of cultural and tourism officials who just use their fingers to pass. The front desk at check-in on the first day was indifferent, and the front desk at check-out was very welcoming. Every boy in the shuttle bus was very polite, and some would help you call Umbrella, on the first day of the Lanting restaurant, no one at the front desk did not say to go in and no one greeted us. The waiter at a few tables did not receive us. We need to take the initiative to ask where is the reserved location? When I went to dinner the next day, the staff at the front desk showed a bright smile and was very enthusiastic in the process. The most enthusiastic girl is Huang Meining, the staff member of the children’s club. On the first day I used to greet me with a bright smile. Asking her questions is also a very enthusiastic answer. On the third day, I can recognize who I am. ? What is my son's name, and he is very patient with children. It's great. There is a big problem with the door guidance of the Silk Road restaurant. It is not possible to consider the problem from the perspective of the mother with the baby now, and feedback the problem to the cultural travel officer. The cultural travel officer also pays attention to it and apologizes and gives feedback to the leader. To send me desserts (star meal packs), I said no, I must send them and said that they would not disturb us, but back to the room, haha, where is the cool tonic? Where is the dessert? 😂😂, I don’t understand, I also said no, you have to send it, and you don’t have it. What is this and what? What do you mean? ? ? The most funny thing is that I explicitly sent two suitcases to the cultural and travel officer, and there is a white bag that the concierge needs to take out and send it by mistake, because the concierge and the driver took the luggage when sending off the plane, so I didn’t find the luggage until I arrived at the airport. There was a laptop provided by the hotel in the extra bag, so I quickly contacted the cultural and tourism officer to let me pick it up. Later, a man didn’t know who asked me to put the computer in the luggage storage, and kept urging me to hurry up, their driver It's about to arrive. You have caused me a lot of trouble and kept urging me. I was also drunk. Fortunately, I came to the airport early, otherwise I really didn't have time to run so far to get to the place you specified. These two things show that there is a problem with the communication between the staff in the various depar**ents of your hotel.
Hotel prices are quite high, but bar snacks and soft drinks are available throughout the day. There is also an afternoon happy hour in the Silk Road restaurant from 3-4 in the afternoon. Everyone will be given a glass of wine and a little dessert at the evening ceremony. Breakfast is very rich and served until 11 o’clock.
The hotel is more suitable for couples. You can see affectionate couples everywhere in the hotel. You can make some intimate behaviors from time to time. It is in the restaurant in the lobby, so it is not recommended for parents and children, and there are few children to play, and the room toys are not available. The overall design is not friendly to babies. There are many sharp corners at the head of the bed. The cultural and tourism officials will add WeChat to understand the guests and purpose of the guests before they travel. They should deal with the corners when they know that the traveler has a small treasure. , Although it is not friendly to Xiaobao, the baby bottle sterilizers provided are completely better than the parent-child hotels are exactly the same as the family's 😁

msg:Overall good, worthy of the price. Thank you for your sincere service.
The only dissatisfaction is the free afternoon tea. Afternoon tea is not self-picked, it is distributed by the hotel, which is not a problem in itself. The problem is that after I went in, no one greeted me, and I didn't see where there was a refreshment to get. I asked a waiter and said that it was finished and no more. The funny thing is that when I turned around, I saw that the back chef was preparing tea. I thought to myself that I should be able to send it over after I was ready. After playing with the phone for a few minutes, I finished sending it inadvertently, and there was still no one to greet me. Finally, I found another waiter and asked to be ready to send one over. Then I ate it. Have a free afternoon tea, just like begging. If you can't do it well, don't promise to have this service.
In addition, one point is deducted for hygiene, and the hotel room has a strong musty smell. This can be solved by adding a dehumidifier.

The response was very fast and gave us many small surprises. Although the baby slipped and fell in the guest room, the hotel came over in time to help us change the room. Fortunately, it was not a big problem, but every service staff in the hotel knew that the baby had hit it and gave them considerate service. In terms of the environment, it is very relaxing, and there is a fragrant and peaceful a**osphere wherever you go, and you will not be disturbed, as if you are going abroad for a holiday.

3) Breakfast, afternoon tea in Chinese restaurants, western restaurants and bars are all great! The quality is very good! The mini bar is also very rich; drinking water is also very environmentally friendly; the gift accessories are also very easy to use.

msg:It’s really a great trip to the hotel for three days and two nights. I bought two nights on Ctrip at the top luxury resort hotel in Haitang Bay. The two-night package at Capella Hotel includes VIP trea**ent, 500 meals or Spa consumption. Really great value! It has not yet taken off because of a typhoon warning in Sanya. Aria, the hotel butler, cultural tourism experience officer, has already reminded her mobile phone to discuss whether to change the itinerary with Ctrip. I said that it is hard to arrange a vacation and don't change it, and if it rains outside, let us experience the hotel service in a quieter way! From the time when the BMW 5-series vehicle and the professionally-dressed driver were picked up by the Sanya Airport Hotel, I was very lucky that it didn’t rain. The typhoon actually took care of us and we went astray. The driver introduced us to Haitang Bay’s development over the past few years. With the history of the Capella Hotel and its brand, after arriving at the hotel with laughter and laughter, I found that the room is really super big and spacious, and the flowers and fruits inside are very fresh! I can see the dedication of the hotel staff team! I really love this outdoor terrace balcony! You can also go out to breathe fresh air and soak up the sun! The hotel provides guests with free meals during the afternoon tea time and the entrance ceremony at six o’clock in the evening at the library bar every day. The wine and cocktails are all free to enjoy! Every day, the cultural and tourism officials introduced each stop on the Silk Road and recommended a special cocktail. I also tried the cocktail myself! Especially thanks to Eugene, a very nice cultural and brigade officer during the night-in ceremony, not only helped me introduce the cocktails in detail, but also helped me take beautiful photos, which gave me a commemorative photo that added a lot of good memories to this trip! The scenery of this library bar is also very beautiful, which makes people feel relaxed and happy! Because our room still has a catering allowance of 500 yuan, we chose the same well-received western restaurant in the hotel, which is really delicious and affordable! Two people are full of more than 500 food! Because my family happened to be here for her birthday in September, the beauty Zita in the western restaurant and Aria, my cultural and brigade officer, also arranged a special surprise and gave us delicious birthday cakes and beautiful flowers to celebrate our birthday! Compared to other hotel breakfast rooms, the Capella Hotel breakfast room has delicious ice cream and delicious champagne to enjoy! Aria also recommended us to experience the hotel's unique spice life course, giving us the opportunity to make mulled wine! Three days and two nights are not enough. I think I will still want to choose Capella Hotel next time I visit Sanya! Wait for me to come back!

🧹Hygienic: The sanitary environment of the hotel is very OK, and the details are also handled very well
🍃Environment: The environment is the main reason why I choose Capella. I personally think that the artwork of the hotel industry in Capella can be filmed at any time. The private beach 🏖️ is really great. Come to Capella. You experience the real vacation feeling, if it's just a simple vacation, Capella will definitely satisfy you
🔔Service: We must give our hotel reception officer Miss Helen a special praise here. People have contacted us before they have arrived in Sanya. The details of the reception and check-in are all arranged comfortably and intimately. This trip is still I was arranged to upgrade to the sea-viewing room, which is really great 👍🏻🤝I experienced it in the hotel’s breakfast western bar and bar. The taste of all kinds of dishes is very good, not bad!
In summary, the hotel evaluation of this trip is absolutely super 🖐🏻️🦍 Oh recommend

There is no fault in the hardware, and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools and gym configurations are also full marks. For example, as far as the bath towel service is concerned, it is worth learning from some semi-first-class luxury hotels.
In addition, the one-to-one configuration of the cultural and tourism official services is also great. The cultural and tourism official Effy starts to confirm various needs and information before check-in. The check-in stage is responsive and can also link the restaurant to make personalized arrangements. Butler-style service will not be too much or too indifferent. The degree of control is good. In addition to the quality of the cultural and tourist officials, it is also a high degree of coordination of the entire hotel staff.
Great.

Although there are so many projects, they are actually all about watching flowers and dolphin shows. It took 98 to watch for half an hour and it was over. The aquarium is also very small and can be seen in Chengdu. Many projects in the water world are only suitable for older children to play. Many projects under the age of ten are not available. Staying in the hotel room decoration The room rate is also ridiculously expensive. In the next three days, I simply chose the super cost-effective Capella Hotel. Enjoying the service at the same price is like arriving at home. There is a uniform reception staff at the door, because one person takes it. As soon as I got off the bus, there was a staff member to help me pick up my luggage. After I finished the check-in procedure, all the luggage was sent back to my room. After arriving in the room, the decoration design was too careful. We hope that Sanya Capella Not only a hotel, 50 years later, it will still become a classic legend, a place for others to remember!

The shortcomings are in the details. First of all, there are always flies flying around in the poolside restaurant and cafeteria, which is too offensive. After reacting to the waiter, the waiter gave me a can of mosquito repellent and lit a candle. …I originally paid to upgrade the Le Shuiju suite, but found that it’s not a suite at all. There is only one bathroom, and the living room and bedroom are not separated. The light is very dim. The cultural and brigade officer also specifically told us to try not to open the door to the terrace. Because there are a lot of mosquitoes...I found that the water temperature could not be adjusted in the first night, and it kept at 41,2 degrees. Adults and children couldn't stand the hot water bathing...The next day there was a problem with the room's circuit, and the TV and kettle were no longer available...Later My cultural brigade officer, Kris, was quite responsible. He helped me upgrade the ocean view suite in the main building and finally got a good night’s sleep. There were always minor service problems in the middle process, which made people feel that it was not in line with the hotel's brand image. The hotel's solution attitude was very sincere, and the room service was waived and a drop-off was given. Moreover, the environment is not very suitable for small children, there is no bed, our children fall once in the middle of the night... The children's water park is located in a remote location and the area is not large... We will consider it when the children are older

After arriving at the hotel, according to our requirements, the two rooms were arranged close to each other, and the baby was checked in, and baby supplies were also prepared. I used both the western restaurant and the Lanting Chinese restaurant. The Lanting is more Cantonese and the taste is quite satisfactory. The outdoor dining environment of the western restaurant is still very good. The only pity is that the dinner buffet on Silk Road was cancelled due to the epidemic. After eating it for the first time, I can't forget it, hoping that it can be reopened next time the epidemic is over. Thank you Helen for your care throughout the process.

Ms. Eugene, a cultural and tourism officer, is really responsive all the time online from check-in to ordering and final check-out!

The battery car is a 24-hour service, so it's convenient to go anywhere.
The breakfast is pretty good, there are several kinds of porridge, but there are not many stir-fries.
There are free drinks and snacks in the bar, you can eat anytime.
There is a happy hour from 3 to 4 pm, with cakes, fruits, and drinks. The coffee-flavored cake on the first day is too delicious, but the pineapple-flavored cake on the second day is not as good.
In the evening, there is an entrance ceremony, talks about the Silk Road, and cocktails. Girls with small appetites don’t need to pay for meals a day.

However, there are some waiters who throw the food directly on your plate, which is very impolite and needs to be strengthened. Training. On the first day of staying, I called the waiter to deliver the water in the evening, but it was not delivered the next day. Later, I politely apologized and delivered the Puna water. It is understandable that the hotel guests may have missed it. I stayed in the hotel for four nights and the room could see the sea view. The only drawback is that the right side is a construction site. In the morning there is always a sound of Dangdang waking up. Finally, let me talk about the cultural and tourism officer Helen. He has added WeChat to introduce the various situations of the hotel before he has checked in. He greeted us at the front desk on the day of check-in. It made people feel like a very warm and sincere girl. The service was very good. It’s a bonus, and sent us a special gift when I left, and gave me souvenirs from the hotel. Overall, it’s a pleasant journey

Arriving at the hotel more than 4 pm, the reception staff warmly introduced the hotel's basic facilities (restaurants and children's clubs, beaches, swimming pools, etc.). After a short break in the room, we went to the 6 o'clock entrance ceremony! You can drink white grapes, sparkling wine and red wine in the bar! There will be daily cocktail making and tasting at 6:30! Then I went to the dempsey restaurant to have a meal! The service and environment are great! There is a morning ceremony the next morning, starting at 8:30, about 8 minutes, and then going to have breakfast! There are many varieties of breakfast, which can meet all your needs! Then send the baby to the summer camp! Enjoy dinner in a Chinese restaurant! The dishes and service are very satisfied! Check out on the last day gave us a delay! Also received a small gift! Finally, it was delivered to the airport by the drop-off service in the package! The whole process was great! Will definitely come here again for vacation next time!

I lived in two room types, one is a high-rise overlooking the sea, and the other is a first-floor suite. But each is quite comfortable and clean, but the girlfriend is very annoying without a dresser. 3. I like the design of flowing water in the lobby of the hotel, but other designs, especially the lighting design, are not in line with the positioning of this hotel.

Effy Yang has given all kinds of support within his capacity, and the butler service is very in place! If you have any suggestions, I hope that in the future, the hotel will set up management staff at the side of the lobby waiting for the shuttle bus, so that guests from different directions will not be confused. Finally, I hope that the road to the hotel will be brighter and elegant.

msg:This time I came to Sanya and chose Guili and Capella to stay for two nights each. Each has its own advantages.
The sea view is better; Capella focuses on garden design.
But when it comes to service professionalism and vacation experience, Capella is better.
As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt my soul calm down and time slowed down. The tone and smile of the staff are also just right.
I went to experience the hotel restaurant:
The breakfast room is very noisy and there are many children. . However, the choice of meals is still very rich, which can meet various needs and there is oa**eal milk. Coffee stars are very satisfied.
Lan Ting Chinese Restaurant is quite satisfactory. The creative Cantonese cuisine is nothing special, but it doesn’t step on thunder.
The poolside western restaurant has a nice a**osphere, but it's too hot to sit outside is super boring. . The dishes are mainly Southeast Asian, but they are more refreshing, I think it’s not bad
The space of the room is okay. The room on the first floor also comes with a small courtyard, which is very private and suitable for sitting in the cool evening~
The overall experience is still slightly higher than expected. In many newly opened resort hotels in China, it is relatively in line with international quality. You can see the shadow and culture of the resort.

I have been thinking about it since I came back last time. Several restaurants do not step on thunder, the Chinese restaurant Lanting is super delicious, you can blindly spot, relying on the Hainanese restaurant's Hainanese chicken rice is unexpectedly nice, you can stay in the hotel for two days without going out to find food. Needless to say for parents and children, the children’s club and water park are very fun, the staff is serious and responsible, and it’s super relaxing and enjoyable to bring a baby to the hotel. The hotel butler, Aria, must like her real name, and she will provide considerate service throughout the whole process. The sun hats and dolls given to the children are practical and cute.

There is a lot to say, but three key points are selected: cultural tourism officials, restaurants, and cultural activities.
*Cultural brigade officer: Our cultural brigade officer this time is Helen. The first side is really amazing to me, it's so immortal! Not only has beauty, but also thoughtful service and sincere care. The key is that the thinking is very clear, the communication emotional intelligence is very high, no more, no less appropriate. In the hotel experience, rarely encountered excellent.
Figure 4, 9, The Dempsey restaurant, you can book a view to enjoy the sunset, mainly Western food. Figures 5-6, Lanting, the restaurant's design is not high-end, the dishes are well presented, the taste is fair, and the price/performance ratio is not as high as the previous one. Picture 7-8, The Bar cocktail event, Helen, who hosted the event, is the cultural and tourist official of our trip (captured to be ugly). The bartending is different every day. Each wine has a historical story behind it, and guests will be invited. Try bartending. Isn't it great? People who rarely write reviews can't help but code a paragraph😁

On such a hot day, you have to walk up from the underground parking lot. The only elevator seems to be the staff elevator, which is a long time away from the front desk. The surrounding environment of the hotel’s door is not very good either. The door is not obvious, and you can never see it at night. Clearly, I thought I was navigating the wrong way. The breakfast buffet was not taken by myself and the waiter needed to help me. Although this reflects the service, I can’t lose the fun of self-service as I please.

msg:After half a year of live broadcast orders, I finally got a taste of "the most difficult hotel brand"-Sanya Capella Resort. The design was made by Jean-Michel Gathy and Bill Bensley, two of the world's top design masters. Beginning in the heart, hidden in the sea, in luxury, a large number of water elements and colors make the entire hotel like a work of art. It is a luxury hotel, and the toiletries are the top French aromatherapy brand Diptyque. The breakfast is rich and you can dine until 11:00, there is a simple afternoon tea at 3 pm, and there are wine, champagne, snacks and cocktails at 6 pm. The beach is quiet, the swimming pool is open until 10 o'clock in the evening, lying on the floating row and watching the stars, a wonderful experience. Although the hotel is expensive, it is highly recommended to experience it. During the entire stay, there will be cultural and tourism officials on WeChat. If you need to book an event restaurant or have questions, you can directly contact us. Our cultural and tourism officer Effy is very enthusiastic, answering all questions, with a friendly attitude and must be praised. In addition, travel is not very convenient, so you must drive by yourself.

You can sleep until you wake up naturally every day, and you can also participate in various activities in the hotel. In terms of dining, Lanting is very delicious, and Dempsey is also of a certain standard. There are many types of breakfast, but the taste is a little bit inferior. Baoluo noodles are okay. It is probably the only place that misses the point. The breakfast at Capella Shanghai is great. It is highly recommended overall, and will choose here in Sanya in the future.

msg:從上海自駕來海南，住了兩個月的酒店對這邊的服務態度也已經習慣了，確實沒有抱有太大期望，不出意外的出了意料之外5k一晚的嘉佩樂服務也是非常非常一般，對於這個價格甚至可以説差，1分服務給了早餐餐廳，確實對於島上來説服務很好了

衞生：衞生很好，非常乾淨，入住很安心，正常水準

環境：環境怎麼説呢，好也好，差也差，好是我們最後住的房間很好，但畢竟鉑鑽也不用拿環境好來強調了，花錢買來的好環境。差是一入住進來還是有一段插曲，我們入住了秋府，一開始安排了一樓，黴味非常非常重，後面讓我們等待幫我們查看房間更換，期間我們兩個成人和一個小朋友就在這個黴味濃郁的房間等

設施：好，但是出行哪怕在酒店園區裏也是需要搭乘擺渡車，坐車要等，如果住的遠的話真的會不太方便

服務：差，真的一分都不想給，當然這個差是相對於鉑鑽酒店來説，真的太一般了可以説沒有，這裏澄清一點，這個差是對於我5000一晚的入住體驗來説，不可能用1000的價格來給它差的下限，當然服務是有的，極度普通而已。

然後來詳細説一下差的點：
首先，入住當天我們是大概不到4點鐘到達辦理入住的，辦理入住的前台女士全程無笑臉，登記入住第一句就是讓我刷按金，付完按金才開始給我辦理，説我上一家酒店身份證訊息沒有退出來沒法辦理，我立馬聯繫了上一家酒店，這位前台不停催促我聯繫，我也很火大的回懟了回去，後面精彩的來了，她幫我們登記好身份訊息後，和我説“這邊按金付款寶還是微信”……我真是要當場掐人中啊…這位女士您腦子裡除了微信付款寶別的是一點沒有啊，我還再次問詢她“是要付按金嗎”她説“對，付款寶還是微信”無語住了，實在忍不住又懟了一次，真的是魚的記憶，或許是因為是嘉佩樂吧有底氣收double的按金，重點是，我説我不是付過了嘛，她意識到已經收過按金後，不要説對不起，連句不好意思都沒有，就一個字都沒説，辦好了房卡給我，真的很震驚，這是鉑鑽該有的樣子嗎，如果不是因為難得和朋友一起出來，還帶了孩子，我們是肯定不會入住的，這個前台直接勸退！
後面加了文旅官加了微信，説有需要聯繫她，因為之前攜程上訂酒店，酒店管家加v都會提供24小時服務，我也沒有詢問所以我不知道她不是24小時，可能晚上我們回來很晚然後又突發生理期，想找他們送衞生棉，這句另外有需要真的令我驚呆了，真對不起打擾您休息了，整個入住體驗就是，租了三晚好房子睡了下，服務就是我起碼還服務你了你就偷着樂吧

最後還是提一下餐廳服務人員的服務還是不錯的！

如果是衹在乎住店環境逼格錢多沒要求的，大膽沖！如果你也和我一樣對服務有要求，願意花錢但想有細緻服務的，親試在海南島可買不到服務，江浙滬會更好…

（攜程也是越做越糊了，酒店等級對於攜程來説，完全就是用房費來評級，錢到級別到，糊咖！）

msg:隨處可見水系的同時做到沒有蚊蟲，綠化養護非常棒，園林看起來是完美協調的狀態。

沙灘和草坪的銜接處理很好，沒有像其他酒店黑濕泥土的銜接部分。沙灘保養的很乾凈，沒有尖鋭的樹枝雜草。

兩晚連住套餐的房間給了一樓帶園林景觀陽台的房型，因為和室外的人行通道有一些坡度，從外面幾乎看不到室內，隱蔽性很不錯，所以白天紗窗都全開，望出去滿眼都是富有層次的綠植，個人感覺比海景房更好。

房間很大，卧室和梳洗區域有左右兩扇移門可以通行，移門很厚實隔音效果好，就是有點重，小朋友是推不動。梳洗區域內有個靠牆方塌，用來給小孩換尿布，洗完澡擦身體再合適不過，唯一缺陷是方塌頂上有個射燈光線比較亮，建議酒店調整亮度。卧室區域兩張1.5的床，再加一個嬰兒床依舊非常寬敞。小朋友不出房間的時候都在裏面跑來跑去，消耗精力很不錯。

酒店小童娛樂區可能因為剛過春節旺季正在做清潔，沒去成。冒險樂園更適合6歲以上小童。

早餐很豐富，每次能吃1個多小時，省了午飯。晚餐對西餐廳印象深刻，瑪格麗特披薩比城市裡的披薩店更厚，用料十足，非常好吃。不過房間裏第一天贈送的水果和小食一直到退房也沒有更新或撤走。

愛人體驗了一次spa物超所值。水療中心設施完善，非常乾淨整潔，讓人愉悦。

接駁車很及時，任何等車點沒有等待超過5分鐘。

管家Daisy服務非常熱情，入住前一天把所有預訂訊息都確認了，安排的接機車內有小童座椅。到酒店後行李比我們更早到房間。嬰兒洗澡盆和小床都已經放妥，當時就跟我愛人感歎帶娃來這應該沒錯了。

非面對面的服務幾乎都很爛！比如下午致電sabai餐廳預訂晚餐室外座位，硬説沒有，給安排了餐廳內最差最昏暗的座位。靠近桌球桌，椅子和餐桌的高低落差大到我一個181身高的人坐着都彆扭，客觀的説，那座位還不如麥當勞。結果從我晚7點到9點用餐結束，室內就我一桌吃飯，室外座位上座率一半都不到。
更奇葩的是酒店服務中心，入住當晚首次打電話五遍無人接聽。。。這麼多年住酒店史無前例了。服務水平也很差，很多理所應當的事都不給確定答覆，説去問問同事，然後就沒動靜了，每次都要我再打電話去確認，而且不止一次覺察到電話那邊的不耐煩。
文旅官入住時見過一面，沒啥存在感，説怠慢稍微有一點嚴重，但遠遠談不上熱情服務。

海灘摩託車招攬生意的，隨便抽煙的人比以前多了。環境有點亂。最後幾天人少了，就好一些。

吃飯的話，個人比較喜歡中餐廳的口味，小朋友喜歡泰餐廳的意麪小童餐，泰餐廳的服務是最好的，西餐廳駐唱以及魚缸的佈置都蠻有感覺。

酒店的活動很豐富，從成人到小童的活動都很豐富，晚上還有入夜儀式可以暢飲紅酒起泡酒，大堂吧也可以供客人去喝免費的下午茶，還有温泉和水療。感覺一整天都被嘉佩樂的活動安排的很充實。
文旅官Monica的服務也很好，還幫我們申請贈送了三個椰子，離開酒店的時候也為我們準備了禮物，服務很貼心，增加了我們旅行中的幸福感。
酒店的很多細節都做得很好，提一點建議，酒店的沙灘上的水上項目的運營應該是外包給第三方了，每次去沙灘的時候就會有第三方的工作人員追着問要不要做項目，還會問好幾次，會有點煩，希望酒店能夠整頓一下第三方的服務。
總的來説很滿意，住了好幾次艾迪遜但是感覺還是嘉佩樂更好一些，還會來住的！！！

作為一位長輩，我一直注重在旅行中找到舒適和便利。最近我與家人一同入住了嘉佩樂酒店，我必須説這是我度過的最愉快的度假之一。我特別想分享一下我的經歷，以便其他年長的旅行者也能享受到這樣的美妙體驗。
首先，嘉佩樂酒店的環境令人心曠神怡。酒店坐落在寧靜的沙灘邊，清新的海風和寧靜的海景讓我感到放鬆和愉悦。而且，我很感激酒店提供的循環代步車服務，讓我可以輕鬆地穿梭於度假區各處，而不必擔心長途步行的不便。
其次，我要特別感謝接待我們的文旅官Irene。她非常細心周到，確保我們的住宿體驗達到最佳狀態。我們預訂的長輩房型不僅被升級為超級大海景房，而且還額外安排了成人床，讓我們可以享受更加寬敞舒適的住宿環境。此外，當我們需要為寶寶加圍床時，Irene也迅速安排了一切，讓我們感到十分貼心。
在整個度假過程中，我對嘉佩樂酒店的服務和設施都感到非常滿意。從入住到離開，每一個細節都體現了酒店的專業和關懷。我由衷地推薦嘉佩樂酒店給其他尋求完美度假體驗的長輩們，相信你們也會像我一樣度過一個難忘而愉快的假期。

一步一景的園林看得出大師的手筆，也看得到管理團隊的專業維護，比凱悦，艾迪遜更用心。
早餐很豐富且精緻，在我心裏跟傲途格和仁恆的早餐一起排前三。
管家Jenny在入住期間有求必應，比起美高梅的管家客人主動加微信都不理，職業素養高下立判。
小童活動建議引進威斯汀的貝野星球或者亞特的，更適合8-12歲大小孩。畢竟大小孩玩好了，家長才能更好度假。
園區蚊蟲有點多，最好準備長褲，以免被叮咬破環度假好心情。
希望大堂Bar全天能售賣蛋糕點心，這樣客人玩餓了有地方充饑，因為酒店周邊沒有商業根本點不到外賣。

msg:不吹也不黑，根據入住的自身經歷客觀的訊息分享。一句話總結：五六星的設施和餐食，但是配套兩三星的服務：1. 管家在入住前一天就聯繫客人，問幾點到店（因為預約了付費的小童俱樂部項目需要下午2點到店集合，但最後房間是4點才給的，超過了正常攜程規定的下午3點。所以管家問幾點到店也就是個例行流程，並沒有真正考慮客人實際情況）。2. 下午2點到店後告知前台小童俱樂部需要兩點集合，請前台幫忙協調電瓶車，但是前台在刷完預授權以後就不再搭理客人了，在客人很着急的情況下也沒有告知客人哪裡可以乘坐電瓶車，最後付費的小童項目遲到了。3. 關於所謂的管家，一天前在預訂2點付費小童俱樂部的時候，客人就説了同時間段家長想去游泳，酒店的室內泳池明明有更衣室，但是管家就是一直不告知客人⚠️。最後等到房間4點超時出來可以更衣游泳的時候，小童俱樂部也差不多結束了，家長付費託管孩子了最後也沒有能夠去單獨游泳；3點開始的午後時光，3:30快結束的時候管家才通知客人，客人也沒有去成。4:00領房卡的時候帶客人去房間，也沒有介紹園區，唯一一直強調的就是要客人訂餐廳，另外對客人約付費旅拍比較熱心聯繫….然後後來管家可能覺得不好意思就説要送客人幾個椰子或者一個沙灘包做補償，彷彿客人來酒店度假就是為了討個椰子或者沙灘包（客人也委婉回絕了）……4.早餐廳的工作人員眼睛瞅着別的地方，非常不耐煩的問客人要喝什麼…5. 在酒店裡麪走，沒有一個工作人員和客人正常的招呼或者説你好，對比文華或者艾迪遜等度假酒店感受差距很遠。6. 早晨起來小朋友被咬的一腿包包…服務裏面唯一感受到的就是以上所有矛盾累積了以後，當天的值班經理出來同意協調了提前一天無損退房，並安排了車子送到下一個酒店。這一點非常非常感謝！但是其他方面真的沒有感受到任何服務。如果衹是感受高質量園區和設施，確實可以考慮來入住。但是如果期待一點工作人員對客人的服務或者實際需求考慮，可能要提前做好心理預期。非常中肯的點評，希望平台不要屏蔽訊息分享。

🔴首先是文旅官Dean Huang服務完美，➕3分，個人很喜歡這種恰到好處的服務態度，超級好評。入住前Dean就已經把酒店各種訊息發到微信上了，入住後對我提的需求也全都是光速安排，退房的時候還送了小禮品，整體觀感非常好
🔴中餐廳好評，➕2分，粵菜餐廳裏的水煮牛肉驚人的好吃，楊枝甘露也不錯，年輕小夥子服務員服務態度也很棒
🔴早餐不錯，➕2分，種類多味道也好，但是高峯期太忙了我要的紅茶沒落實到位，理解，但覺得有點可惜
🔴沙灘質量不錯，但旁邊拉客玩項目的人跟沙灘摩託有點破壞度假感
⚫️陽台沒躺椅扣0.5分，那麼漂亮的陽台海景居然沒躺椅，我不理解
⚫️擺渡車等太久扣一分，建議從文華引進些司機人才
⚫️歡迎水果一般扣0.5分，我可以不吃但你不能不給好的

文旅官Daisy推薦和服務很精準，準時。

很不理解就是不允許退單的政策，非常不人性化，感覺很強硬，説實話實在不想給5星好評。
還有正常2點退房的度假酒店在12點出頭就催促客人離店時的語氣給人很不舒服的感覺。
三個餐廳的菜品真的是一般般。
沙灘蠻不錯但不是私人沙灘，柏悦相對更好。
説是免税店有券但最後才知道必須別墅房型，真是可惜。

房間雖然是基礎房型，空間也非常足，衞生無死角，大床超舒服。
最喜歡這裏的泳池花園，躺着擺爛看海天一色，身心得到了凈化和放鬆
哦對了，早餐超級完美！我不看重豐富，雖然十分十分豐富，我最喜歡的是每樣都好吃！！推薦牛肉麪！松露温泉蛋！椰子水有點點一般哈

肯定會再來！三月見！

不足：
1.下午茶的質量真心一般，説實話我覺得挺難吃的，可能因為免費的原因吧，吃了一次就沒再去。
2.每次叫車都要等些時間，不太方便。
3.沒有專門涼泳衣的架子，用的浴缸邊上的架子，很寬，衣架勾掛不上去。
4.沙灘管理不好，有開越野車的，騎馬的，對在沙灘上玩沙子的孩子來説很危險。
5.泳池救生員明顯沒有我上一家酒店的負責，時不時還在看手機。
6.周邊打車也不方便，沒有專車和商務車。

由於與父母同行，中餐廳是唯一選項。很意外，連吃三頓，菜沒有重複，且無一踩雷，反倒是驚喜不少。下次再去陵水拜訪朋友，應該會拉到蘭餐廳來用餐。服務也是相當可圈可點。花瓣擺字，比心♥️！
當然，也是有些有待進步處。西餐廳要到晚上才營業。不想吃泰餐的話，連個用簡餐之處都沒有。若能有長時間段可供應豐富多樣的用餐處，度假將會更完美了。

房間：訂的園景，現場升了海景。房間很大，佈局其實很合理。不過主樓確實離海邊太原，連海浪聲都聽不大見😢下次還是加點預算去園景套房吧。
公區：嘉佩樂的設計真的稱得上一步一景！旅拍的攝影師從大門一路拍到海灘，每一步都是畫。天圓地方的設計也結合了中式美學，點贊！
服務：這裏必須誇一誇！我們的管家Daisy小姐姐説話温温柔柔，提前都聯繫好給娃準備了一應小童設施，臨走前送給寶寶的小海星也是一路飛機上的lifesaver🤣其他工作人員服務也很熱情，路上都會打招呼。嘉佩樂真的是感受到無時無刻的主動服務。唯一需要提高的是電瓶車有時候等起來真的比較久……後面我們索性自己走了……
餐食：早餐廳絕贊！地方不算特別大但是特別豐富，也是能感受到的好品質。果汁牛奶都分裝好，減少衞生風險。咖啡真的絕了！時間關係衹吃了中餐廳和泰餐廳，絕不踩雷！我家小祖宗巨嘴刁的娃，也能吃的停不下來……
綜合評價完美！這次三亞行激起了我的嘉佩樂集郵欲，下一次度假是去烏布嘉佩樂還是馬代柏典呢🤩

中餐廳和西餐廳的味道、環境和服務都不錯，帶小孩時尤其會感受到服務細節的差別和重要性。泰國餐廳據説也不錯，但這次沒去呢。

水煮牛肉和炸豬排真的無敵好吃！連吃兩晚！！！
🍞酒店送的早餐和下午茶都是含在房間套餐裏的，7:00-11:00早餐，對起床困難户太友好了，早餐真的超級棒，豐富，新鮮！很多熱帶水果供應，芒果、木瓜、火龍果、楊桃。
🍵15:00-16:00 下午茶不限量供應，甜品和小食，冰淇淋，果汁，小朋友的天堂！
🍺18:00-19:00的入夜儀式，會提供雞尾酒和香檳，以及和雞尾酒相配的特色小食。超好吃！
沙灘🏖️
嘉佩樂地處陵水土福灣，但這裏的海真的好藍好美，沙子也很細膩，小朋友光腳玩無壓力。對比了艾迪遜的公共沙灘，嘉佩樂的才屬於私人海灘，乾淨、安靜。椰林、大海、沙灘，太好拍了！伯爵旅拍也很耐心很出片！
服務💁
三亞嘉佩樂文旅官Daisy！真的很貼心很耐心！在三亞呆了這麼多天，唯一一個讓我們覺得值得實名五星好評的酒店管家！無論什麼時候有求必應，積極解決問題，每次都熱情的打招呼，還精心準備離別禮物🎁！

沙灘非常細膩、小童俱樂部設施多且活動豐富、餐飲非常棒特別是早餐、酒店各類儀式很温馨。
感謝文旅官Brian，從入住到離店，都很貼心及時地對接需求，給我們回“嘉”的感覺。

入住：我們到達酒店已經比較晚將近晚上11點 前台衹有一位服務人員 辦理完入住手續後沒有服務人員來指引我們去房間 漆黑的夜晚我們就自己到處找房間的位置  又累又煩躁！
早餐： 兩天全脂牛奶都缺貨 每次去取都沒有 問就是還沒有準備好！撤空餐盤也不主動 滿桌的空盤 需要喊服務員來才給清理。空調也不給力 吃早餐一頭汗。
夜床服務：第一天入住時候是開好了 第二天就沒有
退房：就這樣 也沒有邀請我們去休息室等車來 
管家服務：有跟沒有一樣 完全感覺不到
硬件：房間老舊得比較快 冰箱門卡住 要反覆拉才能打開 酒櫃的門開關不順
總之 這個酒店已經配不上三亞最佳服務的名頭了
唯一的優點是中餐廳的晚餐依然在線 服務口味都很滿意！

msg:這次入住噪點太多，我來一一説起：
1、入住時前台不看我的備註，我提醒他看一眼，前台説不好意思於是升級了一個遮擋且看出去是別的酒店view的海景房，我説這個房間不太喜歡，可以幫我再換回以前的房型嗎，前台居然説可以，那好吧……
2、minibar如此的寒酸，品客薯片和不知名的水果乾，都是國產的牌子，飲料區域免費的無糖可樂都沒有，酒精飲料都是收費的！這點我也很是詫異！

3、號稱三亞酒店天花板？大概衹有價格是天花板吧！雖然3k+一晚，不算貴，但是我所享受到的是是實在不值這個價，1.5k我都能挑挑揀揀比你家好的
4、房費所含的免費下午茶也是挺low的
5、退房的時候前台也不打招呼，不跟我説再見之類的話，我都覺得好尷尬！
6、洗髮水沐浴露不是一次性的
 總結一下：三亞的嘉佩樂真的不值得去住，希望貴酒店的高層好好的斟酌下，怎麼繼續經營下去，這麼好的品牌到國內來做爛了太可惜了（唯一讓我感覺滿意的是早飯牛肉很大塊，房間打掃挺乾淨，酒店環境也維護不錯，但是缺少點度假風，很像是公寓）

缺點：1️⃣、作為高奢酒店，房間裏的小零食品牌太太太普通了，甚至是普通裏比較差的牌子，我們都沒打開。2️⃣、下午茶有點雞肋，不是所有人都喜歡民族特色小吃，應該可以給客人選擇的餘地。3️⃣、沒到時間入住説打掃好了就給我們打電話，等道入住時間了也沒人理，自己去前台問才知道已經好了就是沒人通知而已……

海灘是細沙，非常乾淨，由於海水很深，不能下海游泳，但是海邊也有很多收費的水上項目遊客。海邊的椰樹也很美。

我們是定的一層的房間，非常喜歡，有個露台帶小花園。房高很高，房間很大，雙人床是兩張1米8的床，其實可以住兩大兩小。

酒店服務真的不錯。除了豐富的早餐，酒店“客廳”“酒吧”全天候免費的水、咖啡；下午3點有免費下午茶，晚上6點有免費酒，一整天都很飽。我們的管家是Monica，特別細心每天各種時間段提醒，服務熱心也很周到！

U1S1硬件、服務、活動安排、細節全部滿滿，酒店是19年開業設施維護的非常新，還是放鬆度假的首選。晨起儀式太極師傅在水中招式，很有東方古韻；入夜儀式會講解文化起源，還有自己動手調製雞尾酒各種活動。

陰雨天的嘉佩樂我給80分吧，這次最大的幸福感是Krystal給的，小姐姐100分，愛你喲！

首先，我提前兩天打電話預約接機，很快有人回電，並問清我這邊幾人同行，都需要準備什麼東西，主動問是否需要温奶器、奶瓶消毒器、嬰兒澡盆等，並且在我提出需要寶寶坐便時，很痛快的告訴我有，會提前幫我準備在房間裏。當我到了酒店文旅官Justin帶我們到了房間就看到了提前準備好的小童用品，此處送給電話小姐姐掌聲👏
第二個好評要送給接待的文旅官Justin，從辦理入住帶領我們去房間，一路上給我們介紹的明明白白，把我們送到房間後擔心我有不明白還添加了微信，讓我有問題隨時聯繫他，就在我還沒收拾完行李，就已經把酒店的介紹、餐廳的菜單等發給我，並且温馨提醒我可以去絲路餐廳用下午茶。入住第二天下了雨，Justin又一早聯繫我問我們有什麼行程，是否需要幫忙預約活動以及温馨提示帶傘，等等這些小事情就讓我們覺得很貼心，好評給到Justin！
酒店的泳池沒什麼味道，比較乾淨，孩子玩了兩天，很喜歡，出門都有電瓶車接送，等一會兒沒有車可以喊工作人員幫忙叫車，不會等待很久，雖然地兒不大，但是有電瓶車真的是帶娃家庭福音，要不兩歲的崽子誰能一直扛得動，晚上睡覺前孩子還在念叨叔叔叔叔，要坐叔叔開的電瓶車。早餐結束時間較晚，為了和孩子加餐時間差不多，我們基本都是10點左右去吃早餐，早餐品類較多，麪包蛋糕類做的很好吃。下午茶是半自助的，一些水果和小糕點，白天還有酒吧可以去喝點果汁，晚上有個入夜儀式（喝個雞尾酒），早上有個啟辰儀式（看人打個太極）由於要照顧孩子的時間，我們都沒趕上，希望下次來能一起湊個熱鬧！
總的來説，嘉佩樂屬於三亞酒店天花板了，我的評價是酒店界的海底撈，服務真的真的太到位了！期待明年海南之旅，一定會再來嘉佩樂！

msg:住的樂水居春府！
其實我是不太滿意的，就這個價格的酒店而言和服務根本不匹配。

還有我可能真的是慘一個套房連文旅官都沒有，第一次我沒有接到電話，還特意打回前台讓文旅官回覆我一下。結果第二次我在通話中又沒接到電話。然後就沒有然後了！開始了2天在嘉佩樂的自我摸索。

為了更好的體驗這個酒店我還特意定了個套餐，結果發現其實蠻多餘的。酒店接機的車並不是對外宣傳的那樣。

衞生：然後説一説衞生，我們小盆友塵蟎過敏！等於行走的衞生檢驗器。到房間沒多久就開始咳嗽，沙發後面角落裡有沒有打掃到位的地方。

設施：房間是夠大，主打園景一樓靠路邊私密性不夠。但是光線不大好，白天也都需要開燈。怕小蟲子飛房間白天基本也不怎麼通風

服務：感覺是流於形式的那種！比如這麼熱的天我等車，不是同方向的車都不載我一下。等了3輛車過去終於有一個接駁車怕我熱讓我先上車把我帶到主樓的方向。
感覺服務沒有一個標準，一切都隨服務員心情一樣。入住別人有歡迎點心我沒有，別人有椰子我沒有，在我提了酒不喝能不能換別的時候給了我4個椰子。兩個味道還不對小盆友已經喝了。我真的栓Q……

總結：
價位上來説是三亞頂奢了，服務根本跟不上！而且海景不行，西餐廳又貴又不合口味！（西餐廳態度還挺好）反正就是覺得嘉佩樂算不上頂奢……

msg:和朋友約着各自帶娃，趁孩子開學前來三亞玩了一週，三亞酒店套餐對兩大兩小真的很友好，基本不需要額外的付費。一共住了三個酒店，這裏不做主觀對比，衹説在嘉佩樂的這兩晚。
一句話總結：房間蠻大的，床很舒服，園林景色很美，文旅官Justin的服務最好！
海景房我們已經有兩份了，並且看評價説嘉佩樂的園景是最美的，我和朋友就選了園景房，雖然房間裏看不到什麼園林，但是一層的小院子也蠻大的。房間沒什麼蚊子，但晚上在户外餐廳吃飯還是會有蚊蟲的。房間內各種酒店配備很齊全，迷你巴的芒果乾好好吃啊，菠蘿乾被朋友幹掉沒有嚐到味道…好像還可以自己去調酒，但是我們沒有去碰。浴袍是銅氨絲面料，個人覺得使用感比純棉更好。吹風機配置相對低了，以為應該至少是戴森，哈哈。床是三亞幾個酒店裡最舒服的，至少我能睡的時間是最長的。
早餐可以到11點，我和朋友都是熬夜晚起派，可以當午餐了，下午三點還有一次下午茶，這樣我們幾個小胃女真的晚上也吃不下什麼了。晚餐選擇了一次在sabai，味道個人覺得超好吃，就是大家推薦的那幾個。還有一次晚餐是客房送餐，給娃要了炒河粉和雞湯麪，也非常的對口味。
酒店園林區非常美，慢慢逛，慢慢拍，園區接駁車經常能遇到，想坐隨時能坐，自己走走也不需要太多時間。不太滿意酒店的旅拍，給孩子拍的照片真的選不出來幾張好的，可能攝影師沒碰對或者孩子狀態不好，衹能選看不出精修的所謂精修照片…
其實，此行給我最好感受的是酒店的文旅官服務，實名錶揚Justin，細心温柔有耐心，回覆及時，不會忽略你的任何感受，細節滿分，無可挑剔！
入住最後一天，正好是我朋友生日，之前也溝通過，希望被照顧一下，Justin很貼心的準備蛋糕，幫我們訂餐廳的好位置，雖然沒親人在身邊，朋友覺得這個生日過的也蠻有氛圍的～
我和朋友非常想直接改變後面的計劃，繼續在嘉佩樂續住，可是娃不同意，覺得可以玩的東西有點少，所以，以後再找時間過來啦～

雖然入住當天遇到退房高峯，等了一段時間才拿到清理好的房間，這期間也是享受到了酒店的實施及服務，事後Mia也安排了補償（甜品）。入住前預約的小童圍欄，在進房間時也置放好了。

整體來説，酒店設施還是很不錯的。酒店內玩水的地方很多，白天可以玩小童泳池（帶滑梯）和户外大泳池，夜間去恆温泳池也不算冷。房間寬敞有陽台，迷你吧有很多免費軟飲，打掃及時，飲用水也每日更新及時。有機會下次還會再次選擇這裏的。

提一點改進的地方，早餐讓在門口等着由服務人員領進去不科學，雖然理解酒店想分流提升體驗感，但完全可以做成桌卡佔位等形式，大家看到會自己找空位，有點畫蛇添足了，前台還要現場呼叫人來領進去，等了五分鐘才來人，有些尷尬。

msg:嘉佩樂在海棠灣那邊價格算比較高的了
整體住下來感覺房間很舒適
但是説沒有特別驚喜的地方
吃飯娛樂價格都偏高
地理位置處於正在開發的地段有點偏僻的
我們是自駕出遊在周邊逛逛感覺人煙稀薄

設施：最棒的就是大堂的水簾瀑布了

服務：Rebecca 管家提前加了微信和我溝通辦理入住 人很nice!!!
其他服務員不太熱情，門口接待的小哥不理人的，服務意識有待提高

環境：早餐不錯的，品種很多，中式西式都有，品質也很好

msg:我們的文旅官Rebeca很禮貌周到，服務及時。因為不太瞭解酒店就提前預訂了，可能我們的需求和酒店定位有錯位，顯然這並非需要在吃住行上更方便的選擇，更不是對親子服務有需求的理想選擇。水上樂園極其簡易，是在海南亞龍灣海棠灣玩了二十多年後見過的最簡易水上樂園，估計適合很小的寶寶。因地處陵水，適合自駕，否則入住後除了攜程送機幾乎難以在網絡平台約車，酒店位於土福灣，酒店周邊沒有配套，據説行政上有點三不管，總之出酒店後除了旁邊的小區環境就是陵水破破爛爛的環境（星星點評裏環境給兩星指的是酒店旁邊大環境，酒店內小環境還是挺好的）。如果不自駕，又難約車，又帶着學齡後孩子，給我的感覺不是享受酒店，而是“困”在酒店。另外客房服務不知何故，所有打電話需要的物件送到房間都花較長時間，也許是距離遠。
