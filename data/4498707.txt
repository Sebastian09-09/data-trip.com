DO NOT ORDER the sandwich club in the lobby café for more than 25 mins cooking without any prior notice.

Beds are humid; lights are faint. The room service team only left a bunch of soap in the front door, no new sheets, no new towel, no bottle water in the second night.



Great feeling’s

Reception team provided first-class professional services. Ted responded swiftly on my requests for invoices and etc.

Breakfast tasted not bad.



To wrap up, do not come if you valued room deco and room services.

The location is excellent at it is right in the heart of a dine out area with many restaurants like: Alimentari, Blue Frog, Shake Shack and a few bars for adult drinking out. Our suite was very spacious with a sizeable bathroom, impressive tub and free drinks which included water, fizzy drinks and milk. The gym and spa come highly recommended with both facilities and staff being top-notch. My son thoroughly enjoy the heated pool and a favourite with my friends were the pool side loungers/double beds for sleep/relaxation. I loved the steam rooms & hot/cold jacuzzi and lounge bed inside the change rooms. That it self was a holiday treat. I highly recommend this hotel.

The room I received was on the 10th floor premier king lake view although I wouldn’t say “lake view”more like “lake glimpse” . Nonetheless, room was great. A bit small especially for that price point. Overall wonderful. Breakfast selection is plenty, continental and delicious. Hotel is also close to West lake,Malls,Wulin Night market and local pubs and bars. Wade’s bar is literally 5-6 mins walk from the hotel. I also ordered room service of which I was impressed by the fish and chips absolutely delicious reminded me of home. The swimming pool is big and well kept and gym facilities are great. The sauna rooms are great. Clean! I would definitely stay there again.

The Shangri-La Hotel Hangzhou is in a prime location, located in the Kerry Center on Yan'an Road in the city center, and Exit C4 of Fengqi Road on Metro Lines 1 and 2. The hotel's supporting services are very good and the breakfast is rich. The main reason why I like staying at the Shangri-La Hotel Hangzhou is that the hotel staff are of high quality and good service. When checking in at the front desk, Lu Mengxue received and handled it professionally and neatly, and the warm reminders were thoughtful and meticulous. It felt very kind and warm, and I was impressed. I am grateful for meeting and caring. I love a hotel because of one person, and I love a city because of a hotel. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will stay at Shangri-La again. See you next time.

I booked the hotel on Ctrip because of the location and the three-sided fence, but I was disappointed when I arrived. The three-sided fence couldn't be fixed underneath. The hair dryer in the bathroom can't be taken out independently and blown. It takes a long time to dry. My friend booked a different room type and used a Dyson hair dryer. There was no comb. I reported it to the front desk and the reply was that the room price was different. I can understand that the price is different and the room size is different. The hair dryer is also divided into different grades. After reporting it, the hair dryer given was a Philips, but it didn't work when plugged into the bathroom plug. The plug at the head of the big bed was also loose. Overall, I was really disappointed.

I didn't have any requirements for the room type, but I was still upgraded when I checked in, which was really unexpected. Although it was a lake view, it was not bad. The room was also equipped with a data cable, and I happened to come to Hangzhou empty-handed, which not only saved me the money to buy a charger and data cable, but also saved my time. It can be said to be very considerate.
The location is also good, with Kerry Center and a bar downstairs. There are also many snacks in the alley behind. It is also close to the West Lake, which is a good choice for me who likes to walk.
I stayed on the 10th floor, and the cleaning lady was very nice and enthusiastic.
The only displeasure is that some guests have very poor quality, smoking at the elevator on the floor, putting takeaway garbage on the table next to the elevator, and the person opposite me in room 1038 put the finished milk tea on the wall next to my room. I hope the hotel will punish these uncivilized behaviors in the future.

Children's activities are basically organized every day during the May Day holiday, and it is a child-friendly hotel. Drinks and fruits are replenished in the room every day, which is great! 
Disadvantages: The fragrance in the hotel lobby is too strong, and children are not used to it; there are many people on the first floor for breakfast during the May Day holiday, and they need to queue up.

The selected ingredients are very rich, and you can order them a la carte. It is facing the West Lake, and the view is great! Every waiter on the 13th floor is very nice, especially the girls at the front desk. The hotel's swimming pool is very large, the fitness equipment is relatively complete, and the afternoon tea and happy hour dishes at the Deluxe Pavilion are very rich. It can fully meet the needs of lying down in the hotel. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the West Lake. Take a walk to see the Leifeng Pagoda in the distance and the misty rain in the south of the Yangtze River in Hangzhou, which is comfortable and pleasant.

The transportation is convenient. The service of the Horizon Club is first-class and it feels like home! The room service is also very thoughtful and comfortable, and the food in the executive lounge is exquisite and delicious, which provides a comfortable stay experience for this trip to Hangzhou!

Before coming, I read the comments saying that there was music, and I was still worried about the noise. After coming, I found that the singing was so beautiful that I squatted with my baby to listen to it live, haha!
I think the cleaning lady Mu Qiancui and the front desk beauty and the young man’s service are all good. As long as you ask, they will solve it. The courtesy afternoon tea is very complete. It’s a pity that I didn’t participate in the children’s handicraft, but there are small school bags.
This trip was rushed, and I will definitely stay for a few days next time.

msg:Hangzhou Chengzhongxiang is the most anticipated parent-child hotel for this trip to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, but it turned out to be the worst. I bought a parent-child package, and my child was the only one of the four hotels that was chased for breakfast fees. Of course, we have nothing to say about following the rules. However, the number of guests staying in the hotel far exceeds the hospitality capacity! No matter what time it is, you need to queue up to enter for breakfast. The name of the food is not what it is. As shown in the picture (only one photo was taken, but there are still some), the longli fish is replaced by potato chips, the melons are not peeled, and they are hard and tasteless. On the third day of breakfast, the ground was sticky, and the shoes were stuck when stepped on... You can imagine how bad the hygiene conditions are! I have stayed in so many hotels in Hangzhou, and this is the worst one. The free boat tickets were also invalidated because there were too many people. The only thing worth praising is the concierge staff, who are humble and conscientious!

The hotel services and catering are good. The only regret is the poor sound insulation, which was especially obvious in the room I stayed in this time. In the middle of the night, I heard the drivers downstairs honking their horns and arguing, as well as the neighbors next door chatting and making phone calls, which brought my sleep quality to the freezing point. Fortunately, after I reported to the hotel, I was given timely feedback and my needs were noted. I hope I can get a more satisfactory experience next time!

I finally found it and went to the front desk to check in. The front desk was really the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The face was very cold and there was no service at all. I reported the parking lot problem, but I felt that they were scolding me, so I didn't dare to mention it again. The king-size bed room is two single beds spliced ​​together, and there is a gap in the middle. I didn't realize it until I slept. The next day, I asked the passers-by and they said that they were all spliced ​​beds. This is the first time I have seen such an operation. I reported it to the Consumer Association and called the Market Supervision Bureau several times, but there was no result. It felt from all angles that they wanted me to accept the status quo and end the complaint as soon as possible. Hangzhou is a really good place. I really don't want to come here if I can avoid it.

A bar downstairs played music until 12 o'clock in the evening. Fortunately, I went to bed after 12 o'clock when I came back from the concert.
I also stayed at Shangri-La by the West Lake. It was an old hotel that was renamed. The facilities were old and expensive. This hotel is new and much better. But the best hotel I have ever stayed in is the Shangri-La next to the Shanghai Oriental Sports Center. It is newly built and has very comfortable service facilities. Of course, Shangri-La in Hangzhou is not bad either.
I came to watch Zhang Huimei's concert alone, so I ordered a piece of Sichuan braised pork for myself at noon. They were all small portions and cost more than 60 yuan in total, which was reasonable.
Overall satisfied. The only thing is that there is Line 6 next to it. From the entrance, whether you are walking from inside Kerry Center or from the outside to exit C6, there is a little distance. This distance is not to say far, but you need to know the way after you feel it. There are twists and turns. Went there, and it’s very convenient and close to the hotel through the side door next to the afternoon tea. I really don’t know if I haven’t tried it once.

The New Year should have some surprises that are different from usual ones, but as usual, I didn't feel the hotel's New Year welcome a**osphere at all. I just saw two dancing dragons during breakfast.
The hotel is in Kerry Center, which is quite convenient. There is a shakeshack☺️

Especially when taking your children out, you don’t have to worry about them being accustomed to the local food. You don’t have to worry at all at Shangri-La’s restaurants. The service is friendly, especially an aunt named Zhang Jiancheng (the name may be inaccurate), who will guide you at the elevator entrance during breakfast time, which is very considerate.
The hotel is next to a shopping mall with great restaurants and coffee. You can also see the West Lake from the room.

msg:This is the worst hotel among the five-star hotels in Hangzhou I have ever stayed at on a business trip.
Because I stayed in this hotel for a meeting, the price of 1,500 yuan was very expensive. It was more expensive than the five-star hotel in Tianhe, Guangzhou. It was just expensive. The equipment in the room was very old, and the bathroom and other items had no sense of quality. The most annoying service was this Difference! 1. My slippers got wet and I wanted to call for a new pair, but no one answered the phone at the service center at 8 o'clock in the morning. 2. Water leaked from the side of the shower head. 3. The toilet in the bathroom was not heated, and it was very cold. 3. First floor The bathroom was extremely dirty, and there were blood stains. I couldn't wipe it off myself, and there was no disposable toilet paper. I couldn't step on the toilet, so I put a circle of toilet paper in the end to save myself... 4. The concierge is often empty. I had to wait for the waiter to come back twice when I went to send express delivery. 5 There was an extremely enthusiastic lady waiter at the elevator entrance on the first floor. She greeted and talked to every guest who entered and exited the elevator. Her behavior was so enthusiastic that it reminded me of After coming out of the train station, I greeted the aunt who went to the guest house to solicit customers. I didn't understand what her occupation was? Living for 1,500 yuan makes me feel stuck and uncomfortable. Thank you to Midtown Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou for providing me with the longest and most serious review in my 10 years of business travel.

The guest room hardware is well maintained, and it is not as outdated as an old hotel, but rather has a high quality. Concierges and guests can receive prompt responses regardless of the size of their requests, and the service is very attentive.
The location of the hotel is great. Take the subway from Exit C6 and pass through the first floor of Kerry Center. You can get there through the glass door next to the service desk. It's only a few minutes' walk to West Lake and Wulin Night Market.
The breakfast is rich, there are many kinds of juices, and the wontons taste good👍
Parma water cleanser, my children said this cologne smells good.
There is also a promotional video for Shangri-La, which my little friend also liked and said it was very creative😄

We were interested in a family hotel, but after checking into the hotel, we were almost overheated. The air conditioner could not be adjusted, and hot air was blown directly. We decided to adjust the temperature to whatever temperature was controlled. We asked the front desk to send someone to check, and they said the valve was normal and they measured the temperature in the room. It's 25 degrees inside and 27 degrees at the air outlet. I looked at the 16 degrees that I clearly turned on, and the temperature is getting higher and higher. Unable to solve the problem, they asked us to change rooms. When they heard that we had two rooms, they refused to change us and could not arrange it. Just tell me where it is. Finally, they lowered the total control by 2 degrees.
Let's open the windows, it's 0 degrees outside tonight. We brought our children here and really admired how they handled it.

msg:I stayed in a little yellow duck themed room. I didn't feel very good when I checked in. I arrived at the hotel after 14:00. I originally thought I could just go into the room and let the kids take a nap... but I was told that the room had not been cleaned properly. It is possible to check in after 1 hour...
Then there is the room, which says 70+ square meters, but the toilet takes up half of the area... The key is that the glass between the bathroom and the toilet is not silicone, so after taking a shower in the bathroom, the toilet is flooded with water... I called to inquire and was told I was told that they would come to my door to solve the problem in a while. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, someone from the engineering depar**ent finally came. After looking at it, he told me that I needed to apply silicone, but we had children here, so it was not suitable... and then it was gone...

Generally speaking, the lady who cleans the guest rooms is the most enthusiastic. The service staff at the breakfast room on the 13th floor were also very polite. However, when I went to the 1st floor for breakfast today, both the service and the food were not up to the 5🌟 level. …final check-out…

The complimentary special item, the children's buffet breakfast is for children under 6 years old. My child is 10 years old...so it cannot be used...ah...

msg:The location is very convenient. It is inside the Kerry Center in Hangzhou. There is a small courtyard connected to the Kerry Center. It is very quiet. It is very convenient for eating and traveling. The subway is also very close. You can walk to the West Lake and Wulin Night Market. I specially requested it because I like peace and quiet. Helped arrange a quiet room on a high floor. Miss Naihe arranged it next to the elevator. Maybe we have different understandings of quiet. The decoration of the hotel is very new, and everything is Shangri-La style. The hair dryer is from Dyson. The only thing that makes me a little I was worried about it because of the fresh air system of the hotel. When I was in the room, I felt a cold wind hanging down my scalp. It woke me up from the cold at night. But I turned off the air conditioner and it was still quite cold. I asked the service staff and said that this is the case in all star-rated hotels. I understand that it will be very stuffy when the fresh air system is turned off, but what should I do if it is cold? I can only cover myself with more quilts.

Let’s talk about the advantages first: the location is good and it’s very convenient to walk a few hundred meters to the West Lake.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: The first one was that when I arrived, I was told that there were only twin rooms, so I asked if it could be made into a large bed. The front desk said it was OK, but later I found out that the two beds were arranged next to each other, with a gap and height in the middle. , it’s really perfunctory. In addition, I found a musty smell when I arrived in the room. It may be too humid and the environmental facilities are relatively old, but fortunately the cleaning was relatively clean. The second point is that I prepaid the room fee on Ctrip and applied for pre-authorization when I arrived at the hotel. After checking out, the front desk called me and told me that I needed to go to the front desk to pay in cash. I was confused. Later, the front desk realized that they had made a mistake. Let me first say that a hotel as big as Shangri-La should have a set of standard services, but the management is so rough, which is really inappropriate. Later, the hotel contacted me and only said that they would compensate me next time. However, after adding me on WeChat, they only said that they would upgrade me and give me gifts next time. It was really insincere and I probably won't come back next time. Thanks. I won’t post the photos. I’ll give an objective review and it’s not bad at all.

The hotel is located in the Kerry Center of Hangzhou. There are many unique gourmet restaurants nearby. I had several meals with my family in Hangzhou nearby.

The parent-child room we stayed in had a direct view of the beautiful West Lake. The stacked peaks in the distance of the West Lake were so beautiful. The room is clean and comfortable, welcome fruits are provided, and children's toiletries are provided.

The swimming pool is located downstairs. There are not many swimming guests, and the comfort is very satisfactory. There are separate hot and cold pools in the locker room, which can provide relaxation. The services of desserts, fruits and ginger tea at the entrance after swimming are relatively rare in other five-star hotels.

Shangri-La's special breakfast is rich and there is a wide variety of food, so you can eat what you like.

The staff service is very good. I particularly felt the hospitality and thoughtful service provided by Zhang Jianwu in the front office. His enthusiasm for treating guests is unforgettable.

I look forward to staying at Shangri-La Midtown Hangzhou again next time.

msg:The experience of staying at Shangri-La this time can be described as terrible! Although the hotel upgraded to a lake view suite for free. Originally, I booked a lake view room for four nights based on my nostalgia for the old Shangri-La in Hangzhou and my longing for the modernity of the new Shangri-La. It was already 8pm on the day of check-in, and the front desk gave me a room on the 12th floor. I specifically asked for a room on the 13th floor, but the front desk didn't reply. So we checked in smoothly that night. The strange thing happened at 2 noon on the second day of check-in. When I went out, I saw that the corridor was extremely busy. Workers were already walking around and materials had begun to be piled on the corridor. Because I had an appoin**ent with a friend at the cafe downstairs, I didn’t think much about it and went downstairs first. Then I received a call from the front desk at about three o'clock. It probably meant that there were activities arranged on the 12th floor. For fear of disturbing me, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade me to a lake view suite on the 13th floor. The phone kept asking me when can I move? Since I was talking about something, I said we would talk about it after I was done. When I returned to the 12th floor after five o'clock, the entire corridor had turned into a decoration construction site! ! So I went to the front desk of the Horizon Club on the 13th floor to inquire. The receptionist looked confused. After waiting for a while, she said that she would take me to see a suite on the 10th floor. I refused because the higher the floor, the better the lake view, and the phone call in the afternoon. It was clearly said to be moved to the 13th floor. After a while, I finally received a call and told me to change to a lake view suite on the 13th floor. So I finished a light meal in the Horizon Club and went downstairs to pack my luggage and change rooms. When I walked out of the room on the 12th floor, before I could close the door, the on-site workers hurriedly opened the door and went in! I didn’t see any hotel attendants on the 12th floor, they were all construction workers. Does Shangri-La Hotel care so much about the price difference between a suite and a lake view room for one night? So that regardless of the guest's time arrangement and check-in experience, the guest must stay in the reserved room type for one night and then force the guest to pack up and move to the suite? There was a large-scale "Alimama" event on the 6th, so much so that the 12th floor (including the presidential suite) was booked for renovation that night. Would the hotel front desk not know about such a big move when checking in on the night of the 5th? Not every guest is grateful for the free upgrade to a suite! Because I stayed outside most of the day during my stay this time and had no time to enjoy the comfortable space of the suite, I just booked a lake view. Moreover, I checked in on the 5th, and my itinerary on the 6th and 7th was quite tight, and you forced me to pack my bags and change rooms on the night of the 6th! Do I miss your suite? What I want is to sleep for an extra hour! In short, in terms of lake view, because there is a building in front of it, the view is not wide enough, so it can only be regarded as a third-rate lake view room, and in terms of service, it is simply last-rate, which directly destroyed my good memories of the Shangri-La brand! By the way, here is a picture of a high-end Dyson hair dryer in the hotel. The air outlet is full of dust. I cleaned it before using it.

I feel really speechless 😓
It’s okay to have drinks and fruits in the room. You get one bottle for two people!
I think it’s better for you not to send it 😕
I stayed in Hangzhou for five days and stayed in three hotels, but your room type was not upgraded. This time, I have a very bad impression of Shangri-La.

The old hotel is low-key and luxurious, and the facilities are well maintained. The bedding is comfortable, neither soft nor hard. The room was large and warm and felt like home. I didn't want to leave even after staying for three nights. The breakfast is rich and there are several kinds of yogurt. It’s been rainy in Hangzhou these days, so it’s very comfortable to stay around the hotel. Behind is the Kerry Center, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.

The deaf-mute helpers decorate the room. The breakfast is delicious. The best Love the fruit char siew buns and chicken teriyaki!
If you live here, I recommend a half-day itinerary: walk to the second park and take a cruise (the ticket given by the hotel, not on the island), after disembarking, check in at the Jixian Pavilion in the first park, then go back to the music fountain and take a ride around the lake The electric car (it says it’s waving and stopping) is full of people all the way. There is a boarding point near the musical fountain. But it’s recommended to ask the staff where to take the 40 yuan bus. It’s cheap and you don’t have to wait in line. The route is the same as the 80 one Exactly the same), get off at Sixth Park, then walk to Wulin Square for dinner, and finally walk back to the hotel, 5 hours is enough. Very suitable for parent-child travel, saving effort!

To be honest, I thought Inner Mongolia had no service attitude, but I didn't expect Hangzhou to be worse. . . The price is expensive, and the service is not there. The hotel is small. But clean is clean. Clean, quiet and small. Expensive. It is recommended to live farther and take a taxi. The West Lake Scenic Area was not far away.
Pros: The children's room is furnished, clean and hygienic, and the breakfast is really good.
Disadvantages: low cost performance, no service. The room is small.
Everything is based on money, and rich people may not think that the cost performance is low. Anyway, I am poor and I think the cost performance is not high. Will not consider next time.

1. I booked the same room type as my friend, and she was upgraded. I booked 3 rooms, but I don’t know why I wasn’t upgraded. (Orders processed by the same person)
2. The room facilities are very old. In my impression, only the hotel I stayed in when I was a child was equipped with a hair dryer with a cord. Is this because you are afraid that guests will steal the hair dryer? ! I was really convinced. I blew my hair, the thread was short, and I had to [press and hold the blow-dry button]!
! ! 【What age are you still using this kind of thing! I guess there is no need for fast hotels like Home Inn. 】And there’s not even a comb!
3. After eating breakfast, the service staff is even more convinced! Remind her that the bread in the toaster is stuck and needs to be dealt with. Don't cause danger by not taking it out in time. She was super impatient and kept saying, "I know, I know!" He waved his hand at me and motioned for me to go away. I didn't get angry because my children were with me at that time. But it’s really annoying. This is Shangri-La, not Home Inn! Is this the quality? When I went out for breakfast, I met a guest at the door who was also complaining about the service attitude and so on. As you can imagine, it wasn't just me who was offended.
I will never stay at this hotel again, never! ! !

msg:I have always liked Shangri-La very much, but this time I had a very bad experience at Shangri-La in Hangzhou City. From the moment I checked in the day before yesterday, I felt that the service was unprofessional. I fully understand that the heavy traffic during the Spring Festival peak period requires time to wait. I didn't get angry after waiting from 1:30 to 3 o'clock. I understand that it takes time to clean the room. I also went out for a walk and came back to pick up the room card when they told me that I could come back to change it. However, there was no room card and I was asked to continue waiting. The repeated '20 minute' waits several times are really infuriating. Why do we not tell the truth about the check-in time again and again, but keep delaying it. He promised that a room would be available at three o'clock, but he continued to ask me to wait for half an hour. Forty minutes later, there was still no reply and asked me to continue waiting until four-thirty. . . The final reason was that the previous occupant had made the room difficult to clean. . . It's hard to understand the hotel's response. As a result, there was still a strong smell after entering the room, and the hair in the bathroom was not cleaned. . . That's not the worst. . This morning, I was still in the room because the door was not closed tightly (to facilitate the entry of family members next door), and a male staff member actually came in, and I was still in the bathroom. No knocking or ringing! I asked him to leave angrily, and he apologized and said he thought he had checked out. First of all, it was past ten o'clock in the morning, and it was not the stipulated check-out time. Secondly, even if you wanted to come in, you should knock on the door or ring the bell. How could you break in without confirming! Very bad experience! Hope the service can be improved and minimum staff training added! I won’t consider staying here again for the time being!

The answer is that it can be canceled if it is caused by a typhoon, so I don't have to worry about it. Praise! The hotel is close to West Lake + Wulin Night Market, as well as Kerry Center, so you don't have to worry about eating, drinking and playing. The transportation is also convenient. There is a subway. Taking the subway from Hangzhou East Railway Station is faster than taking a taxi. It is also convenient to take a taxi to various tourist attractions, which are several kilometers away. When you arrive at the hotel, there are staff members who will help you check in with your luggage, and they will give various introductions when you bring it into the guest room. I didn't encounter any dissatisfaction during my two-night stay, and everything was fine. Of course, these are actually included in the price.
The most worth mentioning is that when I left the store and waited for the bus to go to the station, I took a taxi and called a novice, who only took more than 20 orders. I can't keep up with the high-speed train. Aunt Zhang at the hotel saw that we were a little anxious, so she came to chat with us. It is estimated that her daughter will study at Zhejiang University and become a dentist like her daughter. Later, on Didi, the children were obviously interested in dentists and said that they would become dentists in the future. If a child is admitted to Zhejiang University 14 years later, she will definitely live here when I send her to study.
This is probably the dream of Shangri-La.

msg:For this trip to Hangzhou, we chose Midtown Shangri-La Hotel on Wulin Road. When we checked in, our first reaction was why we didn’t pay attention to it when we checked in Hangzhou a few years ago. I really wanted to slap myself in the face, haha.
We chose the double bed room of the Horizon Club. For us who are more picky, the room makes you and I can't find any opportunities (except that the decorations on the walls are a bit gray, there are no other problems)
Highlights of the Horizon Club→Breakfast + afternoon tea + light dinner (with a designated time) and soft drinks, coffee, and beer in the rest of the time. Elegant environment, sincere service, very very satisfied. Special mention to Shirley, Christion, Vicky, Huang Jinting and all partners of the Horizon Club on 7.23 & 7.24, I give you a big thumbs up, thank you for your service❤
I would also like to mention Yoyo, the technician in the spa, whose techniques really make me, an "old fritter", unable to find fault. Love love love.
Midtown Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou, wait for us to go home next time ⊙∀⊙!

The location is not inferior either. Next to it is the Wulin Night Market. It is very convenient to walk by the West Lake or go shopping in the night market at night. Speaking of hotel services, the experience of staying this time is as usual, making people feel at home. The breakfast has many varieties and high standards, and the environment and food in the executive lounge are exquisite. Special praise to waiter Ye Mengting for her service which reflects the standard of a five-star hotel.

msg:Shangri-La's quality online hotel can be regarded as the most comfortable star hotel I have stayed in in recent years. From the day before check-in, Louis Li called to inquire about the time and needs of check-in, arranged the baby's bed thoughtfully, and sent me the Horizon Club registration information to start. Everything is so satisfying and silky smooth.

On the day of check-in, we checked in at the Horizon Club on the 13th floor. Vicky Ye who received us was professional and enthusiastic. He introduced the hotel’s Horizon Club check-in details in detail, and added WeChat for easy contact. Finally, I noticed that Vicky helped us arrange the two rooms very carefully. On adjacent floors, full of details.

Shangri-La's buffet has always been my favorite, and this time it did not disappoint. The Pianerchuan with Hangzhou characteristics, as well as super delicious mochi balls and fruits are really amazing.

Shangri-La in the city has a full set of L’Occitane for washing, and small biscuits, apples, and flower tea are provided free of charge in the swimming area. The hygienic environment is very good, and the service is super considerate, but the water temperature of 28 degrees is slightly cold.

The overall feeling of staying this time is super satisfactory, and the Kerry Center shopping mall next to it is also very convenient. The subway line 1 is underground to the train station, which is really convenient.

Friends with babies, don’t hesitate. The Horizon Club is highly recommended. When we checked out, the waiter asked us if we wanted to have some drinks on the way. The service is very generous, really amazing

The only reason is because of the 4 night stay. Breakfast was a pain every day. The breakfast is the same every day, and the hot and cold dishes are the same every day. So I didn't eat on the last day, I really didn't know what to eat.
Let's talk about location. Unbeatable location for touring.
20 minutes by taxi from Hangzhou East.
Downstairs is the bread, hamburger, coffee, steak, and Korean food that are popular in Kerry Commercial. There is no problem. Many cities have queues here, which is okay, and there are not many queues. There is also b1, ole supermarket. And the 2nd floor of the hotel can be directly connected to the business.
Wulin Night Market is just a 3-minute walk downstairs. Passing Lime, Crab Sambo. After the night market is the West Lake.
Walk to Yintai for 10 minutes. The Lego flagship store is here.

Service: I live on the 11th floor and the cleaning staff are really nice.
Breakfast: It is recommended to slightly adjust the 135.246 dishes. But the hot stir-fried vegetables are really delicious.
K20 weekend parent-child experience course: No one at the front desk said, and I didn't see where to do it downstairs. I just remembered this from the reviews.

The lettuce is a big piece, why not cut it into shreds? The fried dough sticks were not divided into sections, the porridge was kept heated, the thickness and appearance were too ugly, the cold cuts looked like they had been left overnight, the bread was too hard, and there was no food control guide.

       Finally, thanks again to the people who checked us in and all the services, special thanks to Essie, Doris and Louis!
       Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will choose to stay at Midtown Shangri-La Hotel!

Does the hotel only receive local guests? There is a one-way line at the entrance of the hotel, which makes traveling a little inconvenient. The room is quite decent for the price.

msg:The TV is so small that it is just a computer screen. The hair dryer is fixed in the drawer. A 1.6-meter-small person has to bend over to dry his hair and has to press it all the time. It is a reference to the hair dryer configured in the guest house in the old era. It is hard to believe that this is the configuration of a five-star hotel in 2023. When I discovered that the reservation date was wrong, the girl at the front desk had a stiff attitude and was unwilling to coordinate no matter how we communicated. She also used the package discount as an excuse. I am a Ctrip black diamond and you are so short of money! It was raining heavily and it was dark. I finally drove a long distance to the hotel and had a very bad impression even before I checked in. Then I went to find another male staff member. He immediately coordinated with me after hearing the situation. It was difficult not to think that he was deliberately making things difficult. Shangri-La service training did a good job at the front desk. After all, it represents the face of the hotel. Even if you reject a guest, you should pay attention to your attitude, smile, politeness and tact, right?

The purpose of everyone coming to this hotel is for convenience, and it is also close to the West Lake. The disadvantage is that old wine is packed with new wine, but this new wine is not Moutai. I always feel that the boss was cheated during the decoration, haha, the soft decoration does not have any shadow of solid wood, and it is very earthy, let alone look at the pictures. If you want to be comfortable, you should go to Conrad and Marriott. They should be good.

At the same time, it is very clear where the hotel elevator is. I think this is the most basic basic work for the hotel.

msg:The elder sister who greeted guests at the door was very enthusiastic when we arrived at the hotel. After the staff received the documents at check-in, someone next to them asked questions such as invoicing, and interrupted the procedure twice. There was no room in the morning. I left my luggage and went to the lake. The information about the free ferry ticket was not sent to my mobile phone for the first time. After waiting for a while at the lake, I called and quickly got it done. The sanitation of the Shangri-La room is worthy of reassurance, and the room can see the lake view. Mosquitoes were found at night (didn't open the window) and it took 10 minutes to find them. I hoped not to bite the child, but the next day I found that I did. The charger delivered to the room was not powered on (I tried it many times, and then I used my own when I returned to the hotel). Since I am a friend of Shangri-La, I write this, I hope you can do better, and it is not in vain that I returned the JW Marriott room.

I called to find out that someone was already on the way. Later, I really didn't want to be stupid at the door. After waiting, I went down to swipe my card again. When I asked the front desk, she didn’t know about it and she didn’t answer any of my questions. She had a very bad attitude. I told her my problem and she did her thing. She didn’t pay attention to anyone at all. It's not a brand that makes employees so arrogant, let alone brand hotels, the service of ordinary B&Bs is better than this one. The decoration is old, the room facilities are old, there is no conditioner in the bathroom, and the service attitude is extremely poor. I don't want to come back again. The second time, what was even more speechless was that I paid a deposit of 2168 and the room fee was 1668. After checking out, I only got a refund of the 1668 deposit. I called and was told that a colleague would call me back, but nothing happened. They ignored me and refunded another 363 yuan. There was still a price difference of more than 100 yuan. I couldn't explain the reason. I only drank a paid bottle of Coke in the room. How much is a 100 yuan for a bottle of Coke?
Service: Poor

msg:The location of the hotel is very good and very close to the West Lake, but our check-in was very unpleasant. We arrived in Hangzhou after one o'clock. We first asked the hotel if we could check in. The hotel told us that there was no room. I can understand that. After all, it was not the check-in time. Then we went shopping. After having lunch, I arrived at the hotel after 3 o'clock. There was still no room at the front desk. They told me that this room type could be postponed until 4 pm. First of all, Ctrip did not show that this room type could be postponed when I made the reservation. Even if it was after 3 pm, I could check in. It was about time. Later, the hotel said that they had kicked off one of the reservations and finally gave me a room. As a result, the room smelled musty and was completely uninhabitable. We called the hotel to change rooms and explained how hard they worked to change our room. We put our luggage in the room and went out. After we left, we were worried and we came back to check the room again. Now the room smelled bad, so they sent someone else's luggage to our room! , we called the front desk and asked the concierge to get it, and the whole process was fussing over it. It took several hours to get a room, and the experience was very poor.

msg:I read the reviews before coming here and said that the hotel is not new, so I was a little worried, but it is actually okay. The five-star hotel has a lot of sense of luxury and a**osphere. The room size is also good, and the service is responsive. I don’t think any depar**ent has a bad attitude. Everyone is very enthusiastic and tries their best. There are many kinds of breakfast, but the taste can only be said. The bread and desserts are a bit disappointing. The puff pastry is soft and the stir-fried vegetables are all over-fried. Maybe the quality control of big hotels is relatively unpalatable. After a long time, it will be more unpalatable, but it is better than that. Compared with the Conrad where I lived before, it was so much better. Conrad's buffet and breakfast were horrible. Then I came to know that the location of Shangri-La in the city is particularly central. Not only the hotel can directly connect to the Kerry Shopping Center, but also share the open-air courtyard with Kerry. It is an eight-minute walk from the broken bridges of various West Lake piers. Downstairs across the road is the Wulin Road Night Market, full of food. Two streets away is the bustling Yintai Plaza. It feels like living in Wangfujing plus Xidan. It's okay to like lively ones. But I am a little dumbfounded, Hangzhou is still a tiger running, Yang Gongdi is comfortable. Oh, praise for the big sister who tried to convince us to register as a member. At least the attitude of hard work is commendable. Shangri-La's attitude at least makes consumers feel more at ease. PS Do not live in Conrad, whoever lives will regret it.

msg:A very fair assessment. I always visit Kerry Center every time I come to Hangzhou, so this time I chose to stay at Shangri-La in the city. I thought it would be very comfortable, but: First, the front desk is very small and the location is difficult to find. On the contrary, the concierge depar**ent is more conspicuous. The young lady who checked in, the first one in a suit, seemed to provide good service. Due to the queue, a staff member who was not wearing work clothes and had a blouse and was slightly fat was replaced to check in. He was too unskilled in business and misread the price. Secondly, the service was very unenthusiastic and not attentive. When I checked in, it was already past 5 pm, and they said the floor had not been cleaned yet. They also said that the room was full the day before, which was a far-fetched reason. The concierge service was much better when we arrived opposite. Secondly, the hygiene of the room is really not good, the pillows on the sofa are dirty. The instructions for driving downstairs the next day were also very unclear. All in all, it is incomparable to other hotels I stayed in during the summer. The experience and service are indeed incomparable with Niccolo, InterContinental and Hyatt. At the same time, the room is also very small, which is a bit disappointing for the price.

You can go directly to the city restaurant on the second floor connected to the hotel without leaving the Kerry Center Exit C4. There is nothing to say about the Horizon Club service, and any requirements are met as much as possible. Generally speaking, the hotel does not feel old, and it is in line with the rules of the old hotel group.

msg:When I came to Hangzhou to meet friends on the weekend, I took my baby with me and chose a hotel closer to the West Lake. The Shangri-La in the city has a very good location, close to the West Lake and shopping malls, and can basically be walked. The hotel facilities are relatively complete. We booked a Horizon Club Lake View King Room. The West Lake is in front of the hotel, but to be honest, because the West Lake has a height limit, the so-called Lake View Room basically sees the roof of the front house. . The service is absolutely very good. I would like to mention the attentiveness of the hotel. The day before check-in, we will confirm the approximate arrival time with you in advance, and then we will greet you in the hotel lobby. Because we booked the Horizon Club, we can go to the 13th floor Check in (the hotel has a total of 13 floors). We stayed on the 12th floor. Breakfast can be eaten on the 13th floor or the 1st floor. Nora is very kind. We ate on the 13th floor. The people are nice and the environment is very good. Although the variety of dishes is less than that on the 1st floor, it is enough. The key is that there are few people, the service is good, and the food is very comfortable, and it is very quiet and spacious, master. During the stay, I added Nora WeChat, so I can communicate in time if I have any questions. After checking out, I also asked about the experience of the stay and what needs to be improved. We attach great importance to the customer's sense of experience, which is very important and will make us feel very warm. Because the hotel is located in a downtown area, if there are cars honking on the road in the middle of the night, it will still be a bit noisy, but this is an objective factor, and there is no way. The overall feeling is very uncomfortable, and I will continue to choose to stay in the future if I have the opportunity.

msg:I think this is the worst five-star hotel in Hangzhou. There are a man and a woman standing at the front desk. The male waiter has a big sour face and looks disgusting. The other waitress with glasses is very unskilled in business and is very slow in checking in. She is a foreign-worshiping ** who treats people differently. If you upgrade the room for foreigners, you will upgrade the room for Chinese people. The room I was given is also the worst. There is a garbage dump outside the window of the view room. The TV is pitifully small, the sofa is very dirty, the carpet is also very dirty, and they are reluctant to give welcome fruits. They only gave two bottles of purified water. It is really a disgrace to Hangzhou.

The location is very superior, close to the West Lake and in the city center, very close to many major attractions and commercial centers, very convenient. The environment of the hotel is very clean and spacious, and the decoration style is simple and elegant, giving people a very comfortable feeling. The facilities in the room are complete, and the bed is soft and comfortable, allowing people to have a good rest and relaxation. What makes this hotel stand out is their amazing service team. Special mention should be made of the two ladies Deng Lingzhen and Deng Ling, who provided us with very considerate services. Their quick response to our needs is a plus for the overall service of this hotel. In the end, I think the price of this hotel is very reasonable and excellent value for money.
Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Its location is very good, the environment is clean and comfortable, the service is excellent, and the price is very reasonable. If you are looking for a high quality hotel with great value for money then this hotel is definitely worth checking out.

msg:This is the third time I stayed at Midtown Shangri-La. This hotel is definitely one of the treasure hotels in Hangzhou. It has an excellent location, high-quality service, and magnificent facilities. The parent-child room we booked this time, because we didn’t have children with us, the front desk changed us to a lake-view room with L’Occitane amenities, with turndown service, and you can see the Broken Bridge and the West Lake from the hotel. The food and beverages in the Horizon Club are also exquisite. Pan-fried salmon is recommended for breakfast. Although the variety of dinner is not as good as that of the cafeteria downstairs, the dishes are exquisite and the environment is very quiet. You can enjoy delicious food and wine while overlooking the West Lake. Here I would like to especially praise Aunt Zhang Jianwu, Nora and Doris Deng of the hotel. Of course, the staff of other hotels are also great. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will choose this Shangri-La

The location of the hotel is good, just a few minutes walk to the West Lake. The parent-child room we booked, the child likes it very much. Although the room is not big, he is still very happy. He took him to bathe for two consecutive days. Special thanks to Aunt Zhang Jianwu, who treats the baby with super enthusiasm, and the baby also likes Auntie. The hotel gave the Horizon Club privileges, thank you Doris on the 13th floor for taking special care of us and our baby. A little suggestion, the baby fell off the bed at night, and his mouth was broken by the bedside table and swollen. The next day, he went to the hotel to ask for a fence. It is suggested that when the hotel arranges the parent-child room, the mattress should not be too high.

The room is not very big, well-equipped but slightly old. The bathroom area is not small, and the children took a bubble bath after swimming, very happy.
The hotel package also provides Horizon Club privileges. On the 13th floor of the hotel, the afternoon tea and evening meals and drinks are not bad, but try to go as early as possible. When we go late, many dishes are gone and basically will not be replenished. This Really shouldn't.
For breakfast, we choose the restaurant on the first floor. The dishes are more than the Horizon Club, and the taste is not bad. There will be slightly more diners.
The hotel swimming pool is on the fifth floor. It is not too small, and the water quality is good. There are not many guests, and the children had a great time swimming.
Next to the hotel is the Kerry Center and Wulin Night Market. It takes more than ten minutes to walk to the West Lake. The location of the hotel is still nothing to say.
After checking out, the child found that he didn't bring two toys with him. He called the hotel and quickly found and arranged a courier. Praise 👍🏻
Overall, the whole family is very satisfied with this stay.

msg:I never write reviews, but this time Shangri-La is really disappointing, I really have to seriously give a bad review. 1: The washbasin, shower, and bathtub are used at the same time, and only one pipeline can produce hot water? Without knowing it, I made my wife drench in cold water while taking a shower. 2: The hair dryer in the hotel is not recommended for those over 160mm tall or with weak arms. A hotel that costs more than 1,000 yuan a night also has a deposit, and a hair dryer worth 100 yuan needs to be anti-theft, which is not very understandable. 3. Only Americans and British who know how to use electricity safely are welcome to use electrical appliances in the bathroom, and they are not equipped with national standard sockets. The hair dryer in the hotel itself is bad. If you want to use your own hair dryer, there is no socket in the bathroom. 4: What's even more weird is that the bathroom doesn't have a comb. Now you can find a comb in any hotel. Finally, I called room service to deliver it, and told me: It’s in the drawer. (I stayed for two days and still didn’t have a comb on the second day, maybe the cost of the comb is relatively high) 5: I wanted to watch a TV and found that the remote control was up and down. I called the room service, but it was delivered directly with two batteries and left. up? So sure it's out of power? I can only research by myself, and found that the receiver was hidden behind the TV, and the remote control worked after putting it down. Very speechless. It seems that the TV is also an antique. 6: Is such a toilet worth more than 1,000 a night? If you don’t want to upgrade your equipment, it’s not expensive to set up a toilet trap. Your butt is freezing in winter. 7: The humidity in the room is poorly controlled and dry sore throat. 8: The bedside alarm clock, not to mention its low cost, is it worthy of your hotel name, can you check whether there is electricity, otherwise why put it here? 9: Let me not talk about whether the welcome fruit is good or bad. Can the fruit be put away when cleaning? I have to knock on the door with a cloth bag at night and ask. The only advantage of the entire hotel is that it can go directly to the Kerry Center. Nothing else.

The location of the hotel is superior. It is very close to Hangzhou West Lake, Yintai in77, and Wulin Night Market. The surrounding area is very lively, but the surrounding traffic will be a bit traffic jam during peak hours.

Room view:

Room Facilities:
The check-in room is well-equipped, but some lamps (reading lamps and table lamps) will flicker. I don’t know if the lamps are broken or the wiring is unstable. The central air conditioner is turned on in the room, and it feels a bit dry when sleeping at night.

- The service staff of the hotel are very nice and considerate! Special thanks to the two little brothers at the front desk, who extended the stay after knowing the train time~
- Thanks to Jane, who will guide and greet you in the elevator 🛗!
- Breakfast and afternoon tea are very rich! The restaurant is very warm, the afternoon tea is on the executive floor, the view fried chicken is good!
- The location of the hotel is excellent, next to the Kerry Center, there are many options for eating, so don't worry at all~ It's also very convenient to go to other places, it only takes 10 minutes to walk to the West Lake Scenic Area~ About 6 minutes to walk to the subway! In short, 100 faints!

The only regret this time is that when we checked in, the hotel didn't get the room until 4 pm. Although we arranged for free afternoon tea, and the afternoon tea was great, the time for sightseeing was also delayed. But this is a small episode. Generally speaking, the hotel gives me the feeling that it is still as good as ever, and it is still the Shangri-La that I like.

The arranged room is the kind that can be opened, that is, there is a door that can be opened to another room. Of course, the door was locked when we checked in, but it is conceivable that the sound insulation has become very poor, and the sound insulation effect is comparable to that of fast. hotel. After reporting it to the front desk, the front desk said, "Oh, I know the attitude... In addition, the fruit in the room is not fresh anymore, the kind that lacks moisture.

The reason is that the hotel is relatively close to the city center, and it is super convenient to go out to eat, drink, and play, especially from the West Lake Scenic Area. The environment of "Hangzhou Kerry Center" next to the hotel is also quite exotic…
        On the first day we stayed at the hotel, we were warmly received by Doris Deng, the head of the Guest Relations Depar**ent, and helped us upgrade our room to a deluxe double room. Mr. Li from the luggage depar**ent is also very amiable and actively helping with luggage...
       The next day's breakfast was my ideal. The restaurant environment is elegant, clean and comfortable, the dishes are rich, the ingredients are fresh and everything is available, especially the restaurant staff are also very active and warm to entertain the guests…
        In the short two days of the hotel, there is no end to the enjoyment. Next time, we will introduce more relatives and friends to the luxurious "Shangri-La Hotel in the City" for vacation. Thank you to all the hotel staff for their warm and thoughtful dedication to our guests!

In the communication in advance, I knew that it was a rare trip with my mother this time, and said that I would try my best to arrange some room types, and actually arranged a bouquet of flowers when I arrived at the store. And upgraded to a lake view room, my mother was very pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, the facilities and location of the hotel. Very a**ospheric and convenient, I will continue to choose to stay next time.

You can experience the first-class service of a five-star hotel when you enter the lobby, and you can also upgrade to a deluxe room for free. Thank you for the thoughtful service from the hotel manager. .
    The hotel is next to Kerry Center, the downtown area of Yan'an Road, and it is not too far to walk to the West Lake, watch the sunset, return to the hotel to enjoy the many delicacies of Wulin Square... It's a worthwhile trip, come back in late autumn😃😃

Distance praise, breakfast praise, service better; children like the swimming pool and clown uncle very much
The best time was when I ran into an auntie who was a waiter at the elevator entrance. He still remembered that I took the child and praised the auntie's extraordinary memory, and peeked at the auntie's work card: Zhang Jianwu

msg:Talking about the advantages: the location is invincible, the hotels under Shangri-La Group are integrated with the commercial real estate Kerry Center, and the food, accommodation, shopping, transportation, etc. are seamlessly connected. This is also the main reason for choosing his home. It takes five minutes to walk to West Lake, two The building corridor leads directly to the restaurant in Kerry Center, which can't be better. In terms of hardware, Xiangjia's consistent standard of Chinese food, Western restaurants, as well as special bars and executive lounges, swimming pools and gym facilities are all available. In terms of service, the whole is in line with the luxury positioning. Becky Zhang at the front desk responded to the request of the guests and checked in efficiently. Li Furong worked meticulously in cleaning, and the service of turning down the bed and giving fruit was in place.
Talk about the shortcomings: after all, the decoration is a little old, and it is not enough to keep up with the times. The deluxe lake view room is not equipped with a capsule coffee machine, and the bedside audio is slightly outdated. It is embarrassing. It is recommended to install a glass sliding door the same as the shower room, so that if two people are on a business trip, one is convenient and the other is not embarrassed to wash. On the whole, it is a luxury five-star hotel near the West Lake with good cost performance, suitable for business trips or family trips.

msg:This afternoon we were staying at a hotel and wanted to park on the street. We argued with the security guard for a long time but disagreed. I said we would just park for a while and check in. They said that those staying in the hotel must park in the underground garage. The garage is very winding and there is no clear entrance to the hotel. After looking for the sign for a long time, we found it. After checking in, we went out to eat and came back at 11 o'clock. When we saw a car parked on the roadside, we wanted to park on the road for convenience. The security guard had a bad attitude and pointed at us and asked us what we wanted. Put the card in, md, will I still be checked by security when I come to stay at the hotel? I gave the room card and we were about to leave. He spit on our car, which was super disgusting. He found the lobby and waited for a long time. He didn't comfort us and asked us to wait. The security guard also said that if we complain, just complain. Be good, this hotel doesn't even care about the opinions of guests. Ignoring it shows what this hotel is like. Until we returned to the room and called the front desk, the front desk said to transfer to the lobby manager, but no one answered, lightning, lightning! A hotel with a price of nearly 2,000, bad attitude, poor environment, tattered and manual curtains, shabby welcome fruits such as an apple, an orange and a plum, and no smart toilet. It is far different from the Park Hyatt we stayed in last night. The location Relatively superior, but not as good as the Grand Hyatt. The attitude is the worst I have ever seen in any hotel. The person at the service center said that the manager would call back before twelve o'clock, but he did not. Yes, it's so bad. The manager didn't apologize when he called. He said that the security guard didn't admit it. So let's forget it if the security guard didn't admit it? Did I come all the way to Hangzhou to frame your security? It’s ridiculous [laughing and crying R] but I apologize after my request 🙂

The front desk has been upgraded, and started to give a room with a terrace on the third floor, but considering that there is no screen window and mosquito bites can not open the window, it was changed to a higher floor. Can't open the window, but fortunately the air conditioner has a fresh air system, there is no odor in the room, and I don't feel too stuffy. But I still prefer a room with open windows for ventilation. The room is clean, close to the side of Kerry Centre, very quiet.

It took a long time for a cleaning aunt to come. , I was about to open the door when I knocked on the door, but I just swiped my card and came in. Don't you think it would be inconvenient? There are few types of breakfast in the hotel. On the first day, there was beef brisket and noodles. The next day, I didn't have it. I asked if I wanted black tea or coffee. I asked for black tea. Every time a girl in a suit in a hotel sees a child standing up, she will widen her eyes and say it can't be dangerous. Yes, it might not be safe to stand up.

The hair dryer was outdated and turned on for three minutes for five minutes. Although other hair dryers were brought from behind, the socket in the bathroom could not be inserted at all. The room was small and old, and the service couldn't keep up. Check-in before two o'clock, only one of the two rooms was given, and the other was given after cleaning, but it turned out to be more than four o'clock to ask or answer to clean, check-in experience Very bad! Be fooled last time! The hardware services can’t keep up with all the hardware services. I really suggest that Ctrip recommends hotels in the future to be more sincere. This hotel ranks fifth in Hangzhou. I feel really sorry for some famous places in the mountains in Hangzhou, and I have lost the face of Hangzhou. I sincerely talk!

This time around the Lantern Festival, my wife and I came again. Sure enough, there will be a surprise when you arrive at the hotel. You will feel at home as soon as you arrive at the hotel. I would like to thank Ms. Yena at the front desk for her excellent and proactive service. She also upgraded our room to a room with a view of the West Lake, which made our vacation even more enjoyable. Colors that leave a good impression. The buffet at Shangri-La Hotel in the city is also very distinctive, even if we are not staying at the hotel, we often come here. As for the bar, I personally feel that it has the best hardware facilities among the major hotels in Hangzhou, and the meals provided satisfy us the most, not one of them. So it is also a place frequented by our family, and there are rock bands from abroad performing every night. It is precisely because of this latter point that my wife insisted on coming to your hotel for the Lantern Festival. We would like to thank Ms. Zhang, the head of the bar, for the arrangement and the high-quality service provided by the bar, which made our Lantern Festival night joyful and exciting and unforgettable. Midtown Shangri-La Hotel, Hangzhou, we will come again, thank you everyone!

msg:The hotel is a bit old, and the room decoration is slightly old in all aspects. It took a long time to check in. I confirmed with the concierge in advance that the 3 rooms need to be on the same floor, but when I arrived at the front desk, I didn't know anything about it, and the internal connection was relatively poor. What is more unacceptable is that as soon as you enter the room, you find that the desk is full of oil stains, and there are food residues on the chair. It should be that the previous guest has not cleaned it up after checking out. . . . I called the room to clean, and wiped the residue on the table and chairs directly on the carpet with a rag in front of us, just like the operation of a small restaurant, the hygiene is really worrying. At the same price, this hotel is not recommended. The only advantage is that the location is good, and it is quite convenient to the West Lake.

The location is very good, go out 20 meters or go directly from the second floor of the hotel to the shopping mall, less than 100 meters from the pedestrian street, the location is really good
The room is relatively old, there is a very large smell of formaldehyde when the wardrobe is opened, and there is basically no intelligent furniture and equipment. The overall feeling of staying in Shangri-La Hotel for the first time is a bit disappointing. The body feeling is not as good as the orange crystal that I stayed in just two days ago.. Next time It's better to stay at the Hilton when you go out to travel.

msg:Two points are given to the male receptionist in gray uniform and glasses who received us (the receptionist who arrived at about 18:00 in the afternoon on the 20th) gave us a room on the fifth floor at the beginning. The husband was not satisfied with the room number. The male front desk checked the system. My husband should also be a member of Shangri-La and directly upgraded to the lake view room on the 12th floor. We are very satisfied. In addition, we feel good about the doormen at the door and the staff of Libin Desk. When we check out this afternoon, we enter the concierge desk. The license plate said that it would take an hour to leave and they were very polite, but the reason why they only gave two points is because I found several problems during this period of time in the hotel. First of all, there are several female staff in the lobby in gray uniforms who will give guests a It's a very uncomfortable feeling that if they are welcoming guests, they should greet the guests politely, but it's strange that they just stand there staring at the guests like a stake, and they won't give way to the guests or even have The female staff will roll her eyes at the guests, which is unacceptable to prove that her personal quality is very low. In addition, half an hour after we checked out, another female staff member of the hotel called her husband's mobile phone and asked if he wanted to continue his stay with his name. It's all wrong. My husband said that we have checked out for half an hour and want to renew our stay. Why should we check out? This kind of call is incredible! There was no apology on the phone, so I said goodbye as a matter of course, and felt that some of the female employees of Shangri-La in Hangzhou City did not have any professionalism and personal quality, so this time I can only give a bad review, but I must give the glasses male staff at the front desk and benefit. The staff of the guest station is commended!

msg:I really have nothing to say about Shangri-La in the city. It has subverted my understanding of the Shangri-La brand and five-star hotels. When I am in other cities, Shangri-La is basically the only choice because I trust the brand’s services. If you can check Come, you can see how many positive reviews I have given to Shangri-La in other areas, and so far I have not given any negative reviews to any hotel. Your hotel is the only one. I can imagine how outrageous your service is. There is no service. I don’t know. Has your person in charge ever trained customers on why they choose five-star hotels and what their psychological needs are? If it is just for eating and sleeping, there are more economical chain brands. As a tourist city in Hangzhou, Shangri-La can provide such services. I wonder if your regional director has done quality inspections and assessments? From the time I checked in to the time I checked out, I was not in a good mood for a moment. You may wonder why I stayed for 3 nights if I was so unhappy. It’s because in Kerry Center, it’s convenient for me to eat, shop, and do nucleic acid tests. Let me tell you, this is better than even Home Inn. The service details are not perfect, let alone the psychological satisfaction that can be given to customers.
1. The night before I checked in, I called your switchboard through Ctrip, and the call was disconnected twice. It was the first time I encountered a hotel with non-24-hour traffic, and the call time did not exceed 23:00. Even if you take a break to play with your phone during the night shift, you won't be so early, right?
2. I checked in at around 13:00. I was told that there was no room and I had to wait. I wanted to go have lunch and didn’t say anything. The boy at the front desk (he vaguely remembered that he was thin and wearing a suit) didn’t apologize at all. I explained and asked the concierge to store my luggage, and gave me a vacancy card holder. I went to store my luggage myself. I didn’t see the concierge at the time, so I walked up to the doorman and asked to store my luggage (because generally the doorman belongs to the front office and Concierge), but the doorman said that the concierge was in front, pointed me to the concierge, and I went to check it in myself. This was a pre-check-in service. In one word: Absolute!
3. After dinner, I went to get the room card. It was handled by another little boy, probably a new employee. He was very busy when handling it, but his attitude was pretty good. I couldn’t handle it myself and immediately got the room card that another employee went to swipe. It was too late at that time. I was tired, even after being given the room number 714, I didn’t rest. When I got to the room, I immediately called the service center to ask for my luggage to be brought up, because there was an urgent item in my luggage, but more than half an hour passed without it being delivered. I called again, and no one answered or responded after five consecutive calls. I immediately used Ctrip to complain, and then I don’t know which depar**ent came back. It was a boy who said he was too busy and didn’t receive the call. I asked for the luggage to be brought up quickly, and I agreed. Ten minutes later, no one came. I was already in a bad mood, so I called the service center again and lost my temper. The luggage was then sent upstairs, and the person in charge could check. Check the check-in time and the luggage delivery time to see if there is a gap of dozens of minutes. I also said at the time that if I don’t have time, I can go down and pick it up, but don’t agree and delay it any longer. What’s even more ridiculous is that after I After the complaint was made, there was no apology, not even an apology or explanation. Is the store bullying customers?
4. There was a very unpleasant smell when I entered the room. I was so angry that I didn’t notice it. After I calmed down and was about to take a lunch break, I noticed that the room number was 714. After staying in so many hotels, I rarely see 7 and 4 at the same time. Hotels that exist, maybe other hotels didn't take the initiative to arrange similar room numbers because they were afraid that guests would mind. Anyway, I have never stayed there. I don't know about others, but I am very concerned about the coexistence of room numbers 7 and 4, so I asked to change rooms. , I readily agreed to change rooms. When changing rooms, I casually asked the concierge if the occupancy rate has been very high recently. The concierge replied that the occupancy rate is generally not very high recently. As long as the occupancy rate is high, I can understand the above services to a certain extent. Occupancy rate The waiting time for check-in, the time for delivering luggage, and the choice of room number can be achieved if it is not high. The staff of your store are really talented. I feel that having self-membership can do this to customers from other channels. Casual? You are too arrogant.
I went out for fun on the 5.21st. I called at noon to ask if I would like to extend my stay. I said I would come back to renew my stay and pay for it. When I returned to the room at 3 or 4 o'clock, the room was not cleaned. After notifying me, the waiter came to clean it. I asked the waiter why there was no cleaning. He said that it was not possible because I was pre-checking out. I said that I had already asked to extend my stay at noon, and the waiter didn’t answer anything. I didn’t blame the room attendant because she was at the grassroots level. Who is slacking off in service?
6. The first night is 1188, the second night is 1488, and the third night is 1388. Ctrip’s rights and interests: No fruits are given. It’s the customer’s business to eat or not. It’s your problem if you ignore your due rights. The third night Booking 1488 has the right to upgrade the room. Because I didn’t want to change rooms, the front desk asked me to book 1388 without breakfast. She asked the manager to send breakfast, but I didn’t use breakfast either.
7. When checking out, no one asked me how I felt, but I wouldn’t be so angry if I had an apology. The above feelings made me feel like I was staying in a fake Shangri-La.
Because of your hotel, I no longer have a good impression of Hangzhou as a tourist city, and I also have doubts about the Shangri-La brand. The service quality of your staff has really tarnished the brand. I may not come to Hangzhou again unless I have something important to do. Even if I come, I will not stay in your hotel. I will also tell my friends that even if they go to Hangzhou, they will not stay in Shangri-La in the city, a hotel that spends five-star money and experiences 0-star service.

msg:After the room was booked, the receptionist said that they would pay for it and arrange it together. They said they were all rooms on the 12th and 13th floors.
Since I arrived late, the hotel arranged a room on the 4th floor for me. At that time, I may have thought that the receptionist had made a mistake, so I checked in first.
I just found out today that everyone else was on the 12th and 13th floors, and I was the only one who was placed on the fourth floor. After asking the receptionist, it turned out that the hotel had made a mistake.
Even if you call my room the next day, or inform my host and ask if I need to change rooms, it's my own business if I don't want to change rooms, but no one has contacted me.
The host has already said that everything has been arranged, so how will the hotel hand over the arrangements? Now that I have reserved a room, since I have reserved it, the host should still have one room available. Why not give me the reserved room, but help me open a new one?
I really feel that the management of this hotel is extremely chaotic!

msg:Passing by the hotel before, I felt that the surrounding a**osphere was very good, and I left a good impression at that time. Taking advantage of yesterday's birthday, I chose to look inward. When entering the hotel, the first person I met was Aunt Zhang in the lobby on the first floor. Really nice aunt. Seeing me holding flowers & cakes, I asked the little girl, what a good day is today? I honestly told my aunt that today is my birthday. The aunt replied enthusiastically: Oh... that's great. Happy birthday to you. I am very happy to receive such warm blessings from strangers.

The hotel room facilities and layout are quite satisfactory and there are no bright spots. In addition, the lake view room we chose may be because the floor is not enough and the line of sight is not particularly good. We can all accept and ignore the imperfection of these small details. It is not repeated here.

The hotel breakfast is really delicious, hand-pulled coffee, pancakes and fruits, hemp balls, oil-splashed noodles, eggs, all kinds of fresh vegetables, fruits, bread. Fresh + delicious, the back kitchen is in the front hall, the kitchen staff are also very many and the working conditions are very good, the service quality of the restaurant waiters is even more satisfactory, impeccable perfection. Give this breakfast a perfect score of 100.

Due to our need for a late check out time. The hotel was very generous and helped us to delay it until 2 pm. Is it enough time to ask our opinion? Big pattern. Of course I'm not going to take an inch, and I'm very grateful to the staff for helping me.

The hotel is connected to Kerry Center, so shopping and leisure are very convenient. My biggest hobby in life is fitness, so I deliberately punched in the gym. Compared to a professional gym, it's a little less professional here. But gyms in the hotel industry are considered adequate. There is a large flat floor of plant green space at the entrance of the gym, the scenery is very beautiful, and it is a very comfortable thing to flip over on it.

I didn't take too many photos, but the actual experience is really good. In general, if the full score is 100 points, I can score 90+, which is worth recommending to everyone.

1. I asked not to give me the head and tail room. As a result, it was a place with only 2 rooms on one side, either head or tail. At the door on the 5th floor, people kept pulling cards in and out. sleep tight.
2. I arrived around 12 o'clock and said the room was not good. I came to get the room card around 2 o'clock. I went to the front desk again before 2 o'clock and said that it was not cleaned yet. At this time, my friend arrived from the train station. Go to check in, her room is ready and you can enter the room. I waited for 2 hours, is it because the housekeeping depar**ent did not arrange it or the front desk did not notify it?
3. It is also a group purchase room of 999. I paid a deposit of 1000 and my friend's deposit was 500. Strange, the deposit also depends on the head, is it arbitrarily set?
Felt very unprofessional. The service was also icy cold. Really won't be going again.

As a result, the height limit of the ba*****t is 1.9 meters. On the ground parking space, tell me to park in the garage of the shopping mall next to it. It is clear that there is a parking space on the ground. Block it with roadblocks and will not allow parking. The shopping mall has no high parking space and walks at least 5 minutes from the hotel elevator. The receptionist is obviously dishonest. Reception, not according to the actual situation, if you can fool yourself, you will be fooled. After checking in, you specifically asked about the breakfast time.

msg:This is my first time reviewing the hotel, and I am so angry that I have to review it. Because there is a baby accompanying me, I booked the room type of mung bean frog. The house that can be checked in at two o'clock is usually delayed until five o'clock. Poor, I have never been so embarrassed in my life. I kept telling the room not to have the smell of smoke, but the front desk gave me a room to check in after I couldn't get away with all kinds of excuses. After I entered, the smell of smoke was so strong that I felt pungent and choking. I have been waiting for three hours because the child is by my side, and I have no choice but to accept a change of room and make a little child's arrangement. But the arrangement at the back was made after repeated calls and urgings, and then the children's tents provided by the hotel had a strong plastic smell. There are too many slots before check out, so I won't go into details. The strangest thing is that I left a kettle and an umbrella in the house that I bought. I called the hotel later, and the person who said on the phone would contact me later. The strange thing is that the hotel has not been there at all. Contact me...I have never stayed in such a general hotel. I also saw a mung bean frog room. I thought of being better for my children, so I stayed here. As a result, I regret it until now. I will never stay in Shangri-La again in my life... The anti-hotel is even more ******** here. I did not accept the so-called late check-out compensation from the hotel. I checked out the room on time and on time... Shangri-La really made my perfect trip to Hangzhou extremely stretched on the last day! ! !

msg:The hotel is strategically located in the Kerry Center and very close to in77. It is the place chosen for Chris**as to feel the festive a**osphere. I arrived at the hotel through an online car-hailing service, because the hotel entrance shares the same entrance with the Kerry Center underground garage. When I arrived that day, it was blocked for a long time, but the hotel entrance was very empty and there were no employees to guide me. So I asked the driver to enter the hotel entrance in the opposite direction. There was no doorman to pick up my luggage and no guidance. Instead, after I moved my luggage, an uncle from the concierge came and cursed me and asked the driver to turn around and drive away. A very bad attitude and a serious problem with the hotel's positioning. Doesn’t match. The front desk very thoughtfully informed us of the services and rules of the executive lounge. Because the hotel is old and the rooms are not very new, the hot water in the bathroom is shared by all faucets and the hot water is very small. The staff at Horizon Club are very attentive and can remember personal preferences in the next few days to provide corresponding services. Overall positive reviews, but there are serious issues with the concierge and arrival experience that need to be optimized.

Let’s talk about the location first, it’s very convenient. I don’t think it’s too far from the West Lake to bring a baby. The hotel is connected to the Kerry Center for ten minutes on foot. It’s basically our cafeteria, so we don’t need to look for food everywhere. And there is nothing to say about the catering by the West Lake.
🚗 Transportation: Just next to the subway station, it is also convenient to take a taxi.
The baby is very satisfied with the layout of the parent-child room and crawls around.
The swimming pool is great.
Emphasize the breakfast, which is very good and rich in dishes.
You can order it next time, and the price is right.

It's the first time this happened, and I feel very unhappy. At that time, the old man kept scolding and provoking trouble, but no one stopped him. Only the front desk told me to calm down. Shouldn't the security be strengthened? The next time I encounter this kind of person who commits the crime of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, I won't hold back any more. If the hotel doesn't care, I'll just 110. I'm really speechless today.

Thank you to the lady at the front desk and Abby from the Guest Relations Depar**ent for your thoughtful arrangements. I have prepared cakes, flowers, fruits, and red wine. I don’t need to worry about it at all. As soon as my mother entered the room, she was full of surprises and was very happy. She even took the cards she sent back to save them. Having stayed in so many luxury hotels at home and abroad, this Shangri-La service is really dedicated. Aunt Zhang in the elevator hall is also very impressive. She greets us at breakfast in the morning and tells us to try the special soy milk. When going up and down the elevator, she will help press the elevator with a smile and say hello. Feeling a wonderful experience of 3 days and 2 nights, I will choose to stay in Shangri-La in the city in the future.

I have already recommended my friends to stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in the city next time I come, and it’s super close to the West Lake.

Children like the layout of the parent-child room.

The children's cinema on the second floor has been visited time and time again.

Super cool.

It takes five minutes to go to Liu Park all the way to the music fountain. Electric car tour West Lake Hotel location is quite possible
The buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks in the executive building are very essential. Beef noodles and waffles are delicious. The baby fell in love with the fried rice here. Two bowls of enthusiastic and high-value young ladies will take the initiative to ask you what to eat and drink. The children who eat by themselves are all professional in their services. See Candy and Abby at most and ask for their names. Thank you very much. Thank you for being nice to the children. Candy recommended us a tourist route.
I like your service here and got a lot of help from the staff. Every detail is praised. We forgot the luggage and will be sent to the guest room. The child soiled the bedding. A phone call will be changed immediately. The reception and registration at the door and the concierge are also professional. I really feel at home and will come in the future.

msg:The Shangri-La Hotel, which basically stays with children every time I go out, is also very strange. I can only check in at 4 o'clock in the theme room of our parent-child hotel. The little brother at the front desk opened another room for rest. It’s not bad to eat. It was very unpleasant during breakfast. I called a waiter in front to get the baby bowl and I didn’t get it at the back, but things got worse in the back. When I was dining, I saw a wall and climbed up a big spider. I saw the waiter. The waiter happened to ask her to bring it to me. The one in the bowl talked on the walkie-talkie even though she didn’t care about it, she didn’t know what she was saying and no one would care about this spider until we left. If it weren’t for a male spider next to us, she would have to crawl into the bowl. 1888, a room with such a quality service is worse than 188. I really don’t know how to recruit people now.

msg:I have lived in Shangri-La in many cities, and I feel pretty good, so as long as there is Shangri-La in the local business trip, I usually choose to live there. This time I had the worst experience. First of all, I arrived at the front desk of a woman who checked in in the afternoon. She was still dawdling when I queued for half an hour for other customers. The male waiter at the counter next to me had already processed a group of people. I told her that she was still unconvinced and had a bad attitude. The check-in was only done at the other counter. Who knew that the air conditioner in the room on the 8th floor had been turned on for an afternoon without heating. I called the front desk several times and a maintenance worker came. He said that the air conditioner was broken and he couldn't figure it out and called another person. I came here alone, and I have been doing repairs. After that, my family and I couldn't stand it, so I went out for dinner. It was not until 9 o'clock in the evening that the room was a little heated. These are the service attitudes that a brand hotel should have.

The hotel is about a 5-minute walk from West Lake Six Park and is close to the Kerry Center. The location is excellent. Needless to say, the hardware has always been adhering to the inherent high-end a**ospheric style of Shangri-La (the old Shangri-La near Yuewang Temple is a bit old compared to it). I especially appreciate Chengxiang's service philosophy, which is caring, meticulous and thoughtful. Special thanks to Abby, the customer service manager, who also paid attention to my birthday during my busy schedule. I took the initiative to write a birthday card and presented cakes, fruits, and red wine in the room. Thank you abby, you can feel the thoughtful service awareness and training level of the staff of Shangri-La Hotel. Feel the warmth of family. I will definitely come back for a few more days next time

There was a strong smell of smoke in the room, the windows could not be opened for ventilation, and the air conditioner had no fresh air system, which was simply suffocating.

優點：
禮賓很好哦 下車幫忙拿行李 推嬰兒車
客房服務，打掃都很好
地理位置很好 到酒店後就不用動車了 去西湖走路就行 


缺點：
前台辦理的小夥子 沒有任何介紹 包括酒店的設施 早餐時間等等 一般前台介紹的內容一個也沒有 也不跟我説豪華閣可以享受的權益 是我看到櫃面上有一張介紹 主動問他 他才説哦是 豪華閣的可以享受…做入住手續的時候，是完全沒注意到嗎？服務培訓太差！

房間內因為沒有辦法開窗 所以進門會有一味地毯塵蟎的味道 我比較敏感 所以進房間就是一連串的噴嚏

下面説缺點:1.下午2:40到辦理不了住宿，酒店解釋説因入住客人太多，房間清潔比較慢，要等到下午四點，那是不是可以理解為——衹要入住客人多了，服務就沒法保證了？酒店接待能力不足以支撐將近滿房的情況？
2.出於儘快入住的目的，在打掃房間時我也來到了房間，結果保潔阿姨竟然用浴巾擦拭淋浴間的地面，雖然時常聽説酒店保潔環節都堪憂，可真正親眼所見還是覺得難以接受。

入住時間是12點，但中午12點已經在酒店預訂好午餐，就提前到酒店，和前台商量可否提前入住，回答是沒有適合我預訂的空房，要麼加錢升級（我認為這是加錢的套路，因為當天酒店並不忙）；我就等到11點45分再辦理入住，還是回覆沒有，衹有升級房。我衹能帶着行李先去用餐。

處理方案很滿意，酒店主管贈送了早餐，以及升級了房型。但是很難相信這是香格里拉該存在的問題，希望和夜店去協調，解決噪音問題。至於酒店整體服務員專業度可以參考行政酒廊的服務人員。大大表揚，以及非常滿意。行政酒廊整體服務團隊超級專業！看到了五星酒店該有的含蓄。
總而言之，若不是升級房型，以及早餐，我可能很難平復內心的不滿。吃人嘴軟。
希望大堂，餐廳，spa…都由行政酒廊經理統一培訓。
最後，處理整件事情的是一名男經理，年紀不大，忘記叫什麼，建議酒店管理層直接開除，原因，説話很不專業。

優勢是地理位置得天獨厚，無論是步行去西湖還是去嘉裏中吃飯，都是近在咫尺。下次過來杭州還會選擇這裏。
退房時應該是王建芬阿姨（沒記錯的話）積極幫忙，錄入車輛訊息和歸還房卡都節省了不少時間。

價格有點不值相比其他香格里拉

剛入住發現床單上有點不明物，客房來人拍了照。一位女經理很迅速地幫換了房。換房後比原來高一層，可以看到西湖，湖景很美，本來就像撿了一衹皮夾子，柳暗花明的感覺，可是突然發現陽台玻璃內外星星點點有幾衹藍色的有腳的很小很小的蟲子，有的在玻璃窗外，有的在玻璃和玻璃之間是夾縫裡，還有一衹在屋裡飛。蟲子不多，馬上把陽台關上，不敢再開了。怕縫隙裏進來。不好意思再換房，湊合完2日就退房了。奇怪的是疫情前來住過好多次，也開窗，怎麼沒有發現有這種情況呢

今次訂的酒店套票，包括西湖遊船。

酒店房間很寬敞，寧静，而且非常整潔。最令我覺得感動就是這裡殷勤親切服務。由於行程改動，交通安排遇到一些問題。幸好遇上這位張海飛服務經理，幫忙買高鐵車票，並給與一些很好又到位的意見。心也踏實下來，再續以後的旅程。

感謝你們！盼不久再來杭州玩 :) 

最後，還是要說...如果發覺没有空找哪一間杭州酒店，這裡是很不錯的選擇。

缺點
📌📌片兒川早餐還需要排號排了號還要等好久，上次因為太久了想過去看看，過去了才知道原來人站在那裡就能拿到麪，那排號又有什麼意義？
優點
📌📌下樓就有核酸檢測點特別的方便，酒店的工作人員也很熱情❤️。車停在地下車庫直到退房都是免費的哦。樓下就是嘉裏中心黃油與麪包就在樓下，如果排隊的人不都可以去試一下惠靈頓牛排很好吃😋，下樓銀泰邊上就是寫滿樓蟹黃麪好吃但有一點膩🦀設施齊全早餐🥣不錯nice。

msg:非常棒的一家酒店，地理位置處於市中心C位，服務暖心、貼心，入住當天前台服務員（水鬱竹）非常耐心主動介紹房型和行政閣禮遇，酒店的衞浴用品歐舒丹、浴室毛巾柔軟舒適，床墊軟硬適中，床品舒適，13樓行政樓層餐廳員工見客主動問候，餐品雖然比不上一樓的自助餐，但相對來説非常精緻爽口！是不二之選的一家酒店，入住體驗感非常滿意！

msg:酒店無論公區還是房間，用料都很紮實，但是設計風格太老氣了。早餐很棒，地理位置方便，西湖步行可達，樓下就是嘉裏中心，地鐵上蓋。另外，吹風機用一條繩子連着，是怕住客偷嗎？這個格局太low了。而且用起來要一直按着開關，極不方便。

msg:我是17號晚入住的湖景行政套房，晚上到豪華閣要求做私隱保密服務，豪華閣的值班服務員説您打開請勿打擾的燈就可以了，這句話傷害性不大，侮辱性挺大的，想想看一個訂套房的，會需要人教你打開免打攪的燈？！令人無語。有客人到房間談事，打電話要求送幾瓶飲用水，服務員會問三瓶還是四瓶？然後竟然真的慷慨地送來了四瓶。好吧，四千多塊錢的房價，需要為一塊錢多一瓶的飲用水控制成本，孤寒的程度令人髮指！退房時候的豪華閣黑制服值班經理是極好的，但開票系統是**的，非要輸入税號，真的無語😓。這麼好的位置，這麼好的酒店，這麼爛的管理。幾乎從不點評的我實在忍不住要**** 一下他們了。
