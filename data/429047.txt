msg:I planned to stay for 4 days, but ended up staying for 12 days. It has one bedroom and one living room, and everything you need for home. The cleaners on the 22nd and 26th floors where I stayed were very dedicated and responsible. They not only did a good job of hygiene, but also carefully observed the needs of guests. When it was hot and I was thirsty, they put two more bottles of water. I like coffee, so they put two more bags of coffee. They tried their best to meet any requests I had. They also often greeted me politely and asked if I needed anything. Although the breakfast here is not as rich as that of a big hotel, it is exquisite and attentive. The dishes change every day, and the dining environment is elegant and comfortable. The location of the apar**ent is very good. You can go to the airport in the north, the railway station in the south, and the zoo, Lama Temple, Guijie Street, etc. in the east and west. There are also supermarkets, cinemas, food stalls, restaurants, and shops downstairs. Eating, drinking, and having fun are all solved in one stop. In short, here you can have the comfort and enjoyment of a hotel, as well as the convenience and warmth of home. Ascott has such apar**ents in many places across the country and around the world. I travel frequently, and Ascott will definitely be my first choice.

In the end, after discussing with Ctrip customer service, they refunded me the full amount for the last night. It was really unexpected and happy! I feel like I will recommend it to everyone.

msg:We chose this place for our 25th anniversary with my best friend. Ascott has always been a good hotel apartment brand, so when I thought of having a party with my best friend, I thought of this place first. It has convenient transportation and complete facilities. There is a shopping mall downstairs. Just perfect.

Location:
It's just off Metro Dongzhimen Line 2. It's just one click away. It's very convenient for shopping and eating. My best friend works in Dongsi ****iao, so everything is just right.


Serve:
After making the reservation with Ctrip, I called the hotel and told them that we were going to celebrate our 25th anniversary here, so they specially made towels on each of our beds in the shape of small animals. It was so cute. Baby elephants, puppies, and cygnets are all so lifelike. There were also complimentary fruit plates, red wine, and pastries on the table. I told them in advance that I would need red wine glasses. When I arrived, I took a special look at them and prepared them. Very considerate~ There are also takeaways where you can write down your room number and the staff will arrange for a robot to deliver them to the door. It's super convenient and you don't have to worry about going to the lobby by yourself.

Room:
The room is simply wonderful, with large floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. The living room is spacious with a large sofa, dining table, and everything else. There is also a high-definition TV that can be connected to USB and a super powerful JBL speaker. It's great. The biggest advantage of booking an apartment is that it has a kitchen and a refrigerator, so it is very convenient to make some simple food or chill a drink. The bathroom is also very clean and has complete toiletries. The mattress is very comfortable, maybe because I like soft beds. I fell asleep instantly as soon as I lay down on the big bed.

Activity:
The most amazing thing is that the day we arrived at the hotel, we happened to catch up with the buffet dinner Christmas party held by the hotel, which included a magic show, a bartending show, a face-changing show, and a lottery (I was awarded the first prize, but we went back to the room at that time and missed it. Hahaha), the live band performance is also very good, and the atmosphere is full.

Dining room:
The food in the restaurant is not inferior to that of a five-star hotel, and you can add food to the plate at any time. This is really good because there is a chef who is always patrolling to replenish the food in time. The desserts are really delicious, best friend. One person killed 6 cakes and donuts. The big turkey is also a must-have, very Christmassy. The breakfast is also very rich, from classic toast to freshly made pasta, everything is good. I especially recommend the dandan noodles, which are really spicy and refreshing.

Summary: The hotel apartment is very suitable for parties and other events, and many foreign company executives and celebrities have long-term rentals, which shows the advantages, so I strongly recommend it.

msg:The first choice hotel to stay in must be Ascott. Every time I feel like I’m home, my wife really likes it here!
​
Location:
It is very convenient to be located in Dongzhimen of the Second Ring Road. Raffles City Mall is just outside the subway. It is super convenient. From the mall, you can go directly to Ascott Apar**ents, completely avoiding the cold outside. A few friends drove up and parked directly in the underground parking lot. Can.
And it is right next to Guijie Street. Every time we come to Ascott, we will order crayfish directly from Hu Da and enjoy it in the room.
​
Environmental health:
As soon as I entered the door, I saw the Dehua White Porcelain Exhibition and fell in love! My favorite is the sunshine swimming pool. Adults and children had a lot of fun playing in it! The children's playroom on the 7th floor is also a favorite among children. There is also a free freshly ground coffee machine in the lobby, and the taste is not inferior to that of a certain star. The most considerate thing is that there is Xiaodiaoli soup. Because I have been catching a lot of colds recently, I want to have a warm cup.
​
Room:
After all, it is Ascott. The equipment and facilities are well maintained. The room is clean and comfortable, with a wide view. The sound insulation is also very good and quiet. There is thoughtful welcome fruit when entering the room. The kitchenware is fully equipped. I will cook here every time. The bedding is comfortable and soft. For a light sleeper like me, I can fall asleep easily.
​
Serve:
The service attitude and awareness are very good. The apar**ent staff are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello when entering and exiting. I felt the five-star service from the moment I checked in. The guy and girl at the front desk not only checked in very quickly, but also looked great. I also immediately sent my forgotten items back by courier. Thank you very much! The cleaning lady was also very enthusiastic and knew that we had prepared several extra towels and toiletries. The breakfast is very rich and has many choices. It combines Chinese and Western food. I especially like Chongqing noodles and Omelet made by the chef, and croissants with delicious American coffee. Moreover, the waiters in the restaurant will take the initiative to serve us. My mother felt uncomfortable with a gastrointestinal cold at night. The restaurant also specially cooked porridge for us and delivered it to the room. Thank you very much for the considerate service!
​
I received very good service in all aspects, and you can feel the maturity of the hotel management and the consistent enthusiasm from top to bottom. Ascott is the first choice for travel and business, highly recommended, thumbs up!

After entering the room, the manager on duty brought a large plate full of welcome fruits. The room is clean, spacious and bright, with complete kitchen utensils and very convenient for cooking. The swimming pool is clean and the water temperature is perfect. Breakfast is simply not too friendly. It can be served until 10:30 on weekends.

We recommend a 100-square-meter luxury one-bedroom apar**ent with spacious space, a large floor-to-ceiling floor and good lighting. The room decoration is warm and comfortable, and the supporting facilities are complete, including dish soap, scouring pads, and laundry detergent. The kitchen has a full set of pots and pans with different functions. There are three or four sets of cups, which are convenient for washing and drying in winter.
Double sinks make bathing and bathing comfortable. The only drawback is that it would be better to have a guest bathroom!
The breakfast at the hotel is delicious and rich. The ingredients are changed every day. The coffee is fragrant. The swimming pool is clean and refreshing, and the water temperature is over 29 degrees. The only shortcoming is that there is no lifeguard, the front desk is often absent, and the bathroom is a little basic.

The hotel is directly connected to the first floor of Raffles City Mall. We checked in at several restaurants in the mall. The subway station is also nearby, making life super convenient.

I would like to praise Ctrip again. Ctrip’s Black Diamond service is super good. Booking is hassle-free and I will continue to use it!

msg:It's really the best choice for traveling with children. The children are so happy. The facilities are complete, especially in summer, there is also a washing and drying machine, which is very convenient. The waiters here make people feel at home, especially the chefs in the restaurant, who interact with children with love. The chef is very nice, and he also made double-sided fried crispy eggs for me according to my request for several days, and also made white fungus soup. He really remembered the needs of the guests with his heart. The auntie who cleaned the room was also very nice, helping us clean up the takeaway dishes and dry our clothes. The transportation and life are also very convenient. There is a supermarket and the subway entrance downstairs. The children are reluctant to leave and say they will stay here next time.

The basic room type of one bedroom and one living room is set, with complete facilities and cleaning every day. The staff is also very kind.
There are many satellite TV channels, and the children are very happy watching the National Geographic channel 😃
But there was a small episode. The next morning, I suddenly found that the door of the bathroom could not be opened. I informed the staff to deal with it. I waited for almost half an hour and called several times. Although the maintenance worker came to solve the problem in the end, he couldn't open it early in the morning. Using the bathroom is quite annoying.

I didn't know what to do when I checked in for the first time. I made no less than 4⃣️ phone calls to inquire, and the front desk was very kind to help me answer. Thank you very much! During the festival, there are too many people in those delicious places in Beijing, and the ranking can only get the 100th place. It is better to make delicious food at home. Bring it here and bake it in the oven, and heat the soup with an induction cooker! What I like most is that salads can be made and eaten immediately (because it is not safe and convenient to go out with a knife board) 😊 Looking at this table, there is no festive a**osphere, thanks to the inquiry of this fairy place! Of course, the habit of our family is what it looks like when it comes, and what it looks like when it leaves. Auntie worked hard to clean up the garbage bags! ! My daughter is very happy, because the first floor is a shopping mall, so I don’t need to wear a coat 🧥 I went downstairs without leaving the gate and went shopping. In an hour, I bought a lot of little things I like! All in all, this stay was perfect

This is one of them, and they all stay in the hotel with their real names. Are you afraid that the guests will not be able to pay?

The location is super superior, the subway is just downstairs, you don't have to go out to eat, hang out and shop, it's a one-stop solution for eating, drinking and having fun. Because it is next to Guijie Street, all kinds of delicious food can be ordered to be delivered to the front desk on the 6th floor in the middle of the night, and the small robot will automatically deliver them to the room. This is so considerate and won my heart~

The suite is well equipped and if you want to order a takeout, it’s convenient to cook bowls of noodles because there is a living room and a small kitchen. The service attitude of the staff is very good, the children are very interested in the robots, the bath is very comfortable, the family is very satisfied, and the breakfast is relatively rich. Next time I come to Beijing, I will continue to choose Ascott
The only problem is that there is no parking ticket, 8 yuan an hour, and there is no cap.

The mattress required by the 5-star hotel was replaced according to the lifespan, which was not met at all. After I checked in, I found that the mattress was too bad. I was afraid that the mattress was more than 10 years old. It was uneven and had back pain when I slept! There is basically no way to sleep. The hotel staff themselves knew that their mattresses were poor, so I told them after the first night that the front desk immediately said to add a blanket. The staff who came to make the mattress also asked me if the mattress was uneven. son. It can be seen that this is a common problem, the mattress is too worn, and the back hurts when lying down. I really can't live anymore, I don't want to live anymore. At this time, the front desk said that no matter how bad my mattress is or whether I live or not, the principle is that no refund will be given! ! ! ! The attitude of service is to keep telling you that it can't be solved, keep grinding people, can't solve the problem, can't stay and don't give a refund. It is strongly recommended to avoid pits! Spend money to find anger.

There is also a children’s playground in the hotel itself. Although it’s not big, it’s a little one-and-a-half-year-old baby every time. It was a joy to play.
The hotel also very intimately met my request to put the mattress on the floor, so that I can rest assured to sleep on the big mattress with my baby without worrying about him falling off.
The robot can deliver takeaway to the room, which solves the embarrassment that I want to eat when the baby sleeps at night. In short, this is my first choice for traveling with my baby in the future.

msg:The waiter in the restaurant, she doesn't respect the guests, is selfish and has no sense of service, is arrogant and unreasonable, and looks like someone owes her. The salesman has only money in his eyes, and keeps urging you to buy more nights, and even pretends to be considerate of customers, which is extremely disgusting.
