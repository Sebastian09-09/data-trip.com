msg:Cleanliness and location are great, as well as the price. But where this hotel lacks is service. There was a MAJOR hiccup in how front desk handled my situation. I came back at 4am after a night out and lost my room key. The front desk really struggled to find my room number. After about 5 minutes of searching, she found my room
 and handed me a new key. Except IT WAS THE WRONG ROOM. I walked into a room that had 2 complete strangers asleep in the room. They were startled and I closed the door immediately. Went back downstairs and had to ask the front desk for another key, which the lady searched for another 5 minutes before finally finding my room. Needless to say, this is BAD. You CANNOT give someone’s room key to a stranger. That is an absolute sin in the hospitality industry. I hope they will retrain their staff and learn from this review.

The front desk staff are more enthusiastic than one, especially Supervisor Nur, who helped me solve many problems and gave me a handmade soap and a fruit plate in the room. It is really a treasure hotel. I have stayed here several times before. This time I stayed in this hotel again. It turned out to be the right choice. Secondly, the room is tidy, especially clean and comfortable. Not to mention the environment, there is People's Square when you go out, and it is also close to the subway station. It's great.
Thanks again to Supervisor Nur and other staff at the front desk for their reception and service. I will definitely choose this hotel next time I go on a business trip or travel.

Although the equipment is relatively old, the hygiene and environment of the five-star hotel are not bad at all, and the cost performance is very high. This living price is unique among the five-star hotels of the same level. Of course, it would be better if the service quality is warm, thoughtful and meticulous. 💪💪💪

The bedding and linens are great! As soon as you see the traditional Chinese instructions and British sockets, you can tell that it is a masterpiece of Hong Kong people. Although there is no Hong Kong management, it is still okay overall. Convenient transportation, safe and hygienic, and the sentiment is priceless. Worth staying

It can be seen that the quality is very good. Compared with some new hotels of the same price, the decoration looks good, but the quality is not high. I can't stand the smell of formaldehyde.

There are restaurants nearby, and it costs 10 yuan to take a taxi to the Grand Bazaar. The transportation is ok.

The hotel informed me to compensate me 500 yuan. I agreed, but I asked for an invoice. The hotel agreed but didn’t wait until early the next day. The flight was not ready yet. This was because I had been specifically warned the night before. I rushed to catch the flight in the morning and went to the front desk to scan the QR code to issue the invoice. As a result, the tax number could not be obtained. Is this the case for all hotels in Urumqi? It does not seem. In short, it has the reputation of a five-star hotel but does not have the experience of a three-star hotel. I will never stay in this hotel again.

After checking in, the room equipment was outdated, and the trash can in the bathroom was not emptied. Breakfast at 10:00 the next day was not reminded when I checked in, and the restaurant was empty a few minutes later. The commute time in Urumqi is 2 hours later than that in the mainland. It is really unexpected that there is no breakfast at 10:00. A colleague needed a razor for half an hour and it was not delivered to the room. The hair dryer is the oldest wall-mounted type. It will be hot after two minutes of blowing, and the feeling of staying in is very bad.

The indoor temperature is low, a little cold, you have to curl up in the bed, and the air conditioner doesn't work well. The windows are drafty.
Space is hard. I don’t know why there are so many mirrors, a standard room is so small, a full-length mirror is facing a bed; a vanity mirror is facing another bed; there is still a big TV cabinet in the middle, and the TV cannot be placed on the wall up? The space wasn't very big.
However, the space at the window is okay, there are two suitcases, and a small hotel table + two small chairs.

Sweet yogurt is delicious.
service is bad
Laundry is also expensive.
All hotels in Urumqi are tested for corona at the time of check-in. The result takes 2 days.
This is not a hotel where you can stay twice.
I mainly deal with local travelers and seem to be the first foreigner. Because of the Chinese visa, I was looking around for more than 30 minutes.

Foreigners never go.
It says it's a 5 star hotel, but I don't know who gave it 5 stars.
After checking out, I asked for a taxi, so I went out and asked for a taxi.
Surprisingly great service....... I would never go to a hotel called Hoitak.
It's a recommended hotel on Trip.com, but I won't choose the recommended hotel in the future.
bad

msg:Breakfast: 5 stars, no coffee. The type is not like the standard five-star should have.
Service: There is one person before check-in, and it takes 30 minutes. Fill in the information yourself, not as good as the four-star all-season service. Ctrip ordered a voucher in the package, and I asked the waiter who didn’t understand. After verification, there is a voucher, which means that it is 100 less than 1000. I keep repeating it, it seems I can't afford it, so don't ask. Very bad attitude.
Parking lot: It is estimated that there are only 10-20 seats, so let's leave it to your fate if you come back late.
Location: Well, close to the shopping mall, the restaurant doesn't have to worry about running out of food. Close to Line 1 and convenient to the airport.
Facilities: old. Don't ask too much. 5 stars in the 90th century. There is a swimming pool.
Summary: Don't expect too much at this price and this position.

msg:If you are driving, it is definitely not recommended. Although it is marked with 5 stars, the parking is bad. There are too few parking spaces. It is next to the aisle downstairs. It will test your parking level. No one will greet you when you drive in. That’s fine for ordinary chain hotels, we didn’t ask for it, but it’s a bit unreasonable to be a 5-star hotel. This is the only time in the 18-day trip to the northwest that I got caught up with the parking problem. When I got up with the security guard, the security was pretty good. , I told the front desk that the front desk means that they can’t take care of the security. I just don’t understand it. Anyway, I changed to Kunlun Hotel decisively the next day.

After negotiating for a long time, I was reluctant to say that I would upgrade it. Only when I went up did I find that it was 20 years ago. The decoration is not newly renovated. It is an old house. I use an old house to fool me and say it has been upgraded. The house is not as good as a Super 8. As a five-star hotel, instead of solving the problem, it is possible to use an old room to fool customers Because the room has been used for too long, the toilet flushing is still broken, it keeps flushing and noisy, and the service attitude hopes to improve
