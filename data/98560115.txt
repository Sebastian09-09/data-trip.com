When I dined here, Maria's waiter was warm and thoughtful, and introduced each dish in detail when serving. The whole service process was smiling, which made people feel very comfortable.
After dinner, the hotel led the guests to dance by the bonfire, and everyone's warm and smiling service was very good.
This Maria waiter left a deep impression on me.

The service was really great! The food was also very good, and the taste was great! . I didn't expect to meet fellow villagers, and the beautiful Nurgu. She asked for porridge, and she prepared it immediately, so thoughtful! Thumbs up to the beautiful sister Nurgu! There were also a few brothers, all thumbs up

msg:We drove from Urumqi to Saihu. The hotel kindly reminded us to drive carefully in the fog. It was already 8 o'clock in the evening when we set out from Saihu to Shuiyunshan Hotel. It was dark and foggy. We were so scared that we thought we had booked the wrong hotel. Until we arrived at the hotel, Xiaolin and the waiters came to care about us, helped us carry our luggage, prepared hot pot, and had a bonfire party together. There were no stars on the foggy night, so we went to bed early. The sunrise when the fog dissipated the next day was so beautiful! Pink sky! There was a sea of ​​clouds in the mountains in the distance ahead, and behind was the silver fir, which was so beautiful! ! ! The breakfast was as shown in the picture, and the stir-fried meat with green pepper was so delicious. After eating, we strolled to the hotel to take pictures and met our dog Pippi, who followed us all the way. Xiaolin and Aza took us to ski on horseback. Skiing was so exciting that Pippi followed us for a long way. Because we had to go to Saihu to continue playing, we didn't have time to eat lunch. Xiaolin kindly packed lunch and a full cup of coffee. There was also caviar as a souvenir. When we left, Pippi was reluctant to follow us all the way. My trip to Shuiyunshan Hotel started with trepidation and ended with great reluctance. I hope to see you again if there is a chance!

I didn't have high expectations for a wild luxury hotel, but the closer I got to the hotel, the more I was conquered by the beautiful scenery along the way. The scenery alone was worth it~ Because it was winter, there were not many guests, so there were still some flaws in the service, but overall it was still online and the handling was reasonable. The Uyghur brother Ai Xianzhang also took me to a nearby mountaintop overlooking the uninhabited Sai Lake. I learned Uyghur for a long time along the way, and finally only learned Yakesi~ I can come back again after collecting it~

msg:The hotel is located in the mountains of Wenquan County near Sailimu Lake, on a primitive hillside with many wild animals, which is a holiday environment that will not be disturbed.
Before checking in, the front desk gave the hotel location for easy navigation and asked about the dining time so that we could prepare in advance. There was also a brother who helped to take the luggage to the room, and provided considerate service throughout the whole process, including check-in and check-out.
Each room in the hotel is a stand-alone building, with one bedroom and one living room and two bedrooms and one living room. The hotel helped upgrade the mountain view villa room where we stayed this time, with a 180-degree mountain and snow view. In addition, you can make tea and read books, and it is also very pleasant to play in the hotel.
The hotel also provides horse riding photography services. In winter, you can only stroll around and take pictures. In summer, you can experience horse riding. The horses are owned by the hotel, well-trained and obedient. I also met the puppy Pippi, who is very cute, haha, and very friendly.
Although it is in a relatively remote camp, Shuiyunshan still shows a very good catering standard. The breakfast style is very rich. The hotel has prepared fried eggs when I mentioned that I wanted to eat them the day before. For dinner, we tried a hot pot meal for two, which included beef, mutton, beans and vegetables, and also provided seafood platter and fruit platter after the meal. The dining experience was perfect.
After dinner, the hotel led the guests to dance by the bonfire and warm up around the fire. In an unfamiliar environment, everyone relaxed and had fun together. Thanks to the young man Rexiti for taking photos for me and my partner. We spent a perfect 100-day anniversary.
Whether it is the environment, catering, activities, rooms, or everyone's warm and smiling service, the hotel is very good. I recommend everyone to stay here. You will have a good experience!

msg:When we arrived at the hotel, the mountains were shrouded in mist and the white scenery was like entering a fairyland. It was also quite pleasant to have afternoon tea in front of the snow-covered world.
After getting up this morning, we pushed away the mist and saw the sun. The distant mountains were covered with dark blue and the nearby water was covered with smoke, as if in a dream. The beautiful scenery of this paradise made us scream all the time. This was really an unexpected journey full of surprises.
From the small road behind the hotel, you can overlook the entire Sailimu Lake. The blue Sailimu Lake is the "last tear of the Atlantic Ocean". The snow-capped mountains by the lake are extremely spectacular.
The hotel's service is definitely a six-star service. From check-in to check-out, the attitude of the staff is very enthusiastic. The afternoon tea sent by the hotel is very exquisite. The dinner buffet hot pot also sent an extra portion, and the dishes ordered tasted very good. This is an unforgettable hotel experience. I strongly recommend this wild and luxurious paradise hotel. Friends who like taking pictures should not miss this hotel. There is a helicopter in the hotel, and the snow scenery outside the hotel is absolutely amazing. Our car got stuck in the snow, and the hotel immediately sent someone to implement a rescue trailer, which was really awesome.

管家小林和前台小姐姐美克麗亞都超棒，非常熱情，都很好看（當時就跟朋友發消息説感覺這個酒店沒分錢都花在了刀刃上😂），服務非常周到，很貼心，隨時關注客人的需求。
酒店位置很好，賽里木湖北門開車出來接近四十分鐘，酒店坐落在一片山腳，前面可以看山巒，北面是樹林，夏天還可以徒步，冬天就看看走走哈哈哈，騎騎馬，很寧靜，要是時間緊恨不得住上幾天！
酒店還有很多小動物，馬很温順，還有金毛，特別粘人，我可太喜歡金毛皮皮了！（真的皮😂）這邊鳥也很多，附近還有不少牛羊羣。
酒店餐食好好吃，非常好吃，早餐很豐富，感覺夠四個人吃，晚餐點的菜，每一道都好驚喜！感覺真的是太值了！下午茶也豐盛，堅果很好吃，茶也好喝的。酒店有健身房，書吧，時間要是不急完全可以在酒店玩一天。直升機也可以體驗，能坐滿五個人就會很划算。這邊也有充電樁，感覺配套太完善了。房間很大，陽光房白天特別舒服，無敵暖和，總之就是非常非常棒，下次找機會再來！

酒店的老闆娘能歌善舞，為人豪爽好客，昨晚送了一瓶白酒給我們，巧遇她的兩個閨蜜過生日，一起喝酒、聽歌手唱歌、吃烤全羊，晚上篝火晚會載歌載舞，我們喝了酒的小心臟一直到深夜都撲通撲通

房間-無可挑剔了，和上海的奢華酒店可比。
服務-管家式服務，有求必應，反應非常迅速。10幾天的自駕，已經對酒店的服務不抱希望了。特別要表揚我們的管家小夥-阿扎瑪提，本來還以為管家服務是擺擺樣子，但這次真正感受到了。
酒
環境就是大山環繞着草原，還有牛羊馬時不時出現在你的眼前
唯一有些遺憾的是餐廳的服務有些羞羞答答，不大主動熱情，衹能服務的開始，後麪茶水都沒人倒了。

    説説不足，一是住這裏就別考慮性價比了，貴是因為沒有別的酒店有這樣的位置和條件，想要享受，就必須選它；二是正餐598兩位，吃的一般，美食水平還得再提升；三是騎馬體驗太敷衍啦，拉着走五分鐘就完了，建議要麼就讓客人免費盡情舒適的騎，騎到爽，要麼就取消這個贈品，半斤八兩的逛一圈，太小家子氣了。

從賽里木湖北門出來沿着一個曲折靜謐的小河谷就到了美景絕美的酒店。到了會感覺路上的疲憊不算啥。周圍除了酒店和牛羊衹有最原始的景色，能感到的衹有驚艷和內心的寧靜。
服務人員都很熱情。晚上的篝火晚會大家玩的很開心，這裏的少數民族真的是能歌善舞。
經理帶着去騎了馬，夕陽西下，騎着馬兒在草原上飛馳，這是種特別的體驗。
晚上睡覺的時候，幾匹小馬就在屋外盯着我們，讓人哭笑不得。
返程的時候，服務人員指了一條小路到賽里木湖，那裡的風景也很不錯，能俯瞰整個賽里木湖。
孩子是捨不得走的。第二天都離開了還在問我她能不能給經理和跳舞的維族姐姐寫信。
總之5星推薦，下次會找個時間專門過來住幾天。

msg:第一天晚上住在賽里木湖，因為風景很好所以想再住一天，景區內酒店都滿了，就看到了這家酒店，沒想到是我全部旅程中住的最好的😆😆😆
首先：好像是因為剛開業的原因，整個酒店很新很乾凈，服務人員會親切的打招呼，還幫我們送行李，進門的安保人員也會仔細盤查是否是住店人員，感覺到很安全。住店後前台人員幫忙預訂了下午茶和騎馬等娛樂活動的時間，因為入住時直升機還沒有對外營業，所以沒有坐上。到賽里木湖衹需要10分鐘哦～
其次：因為酒店周圍沒有別的飯店之類的設施，所以吃的就酒店內解決，沒想到吃的一點都不貴而且還很好吃！雙人套餐沒有定具體吃什麼菜，所以有一種拆盲盒的感覺，很驚喜哈哈
如果有需要在房間內打電話就會有工作人員上門服務，5分鐘之內就會到，很貼心。有一個應該是大堂經理還是什麼的領導，指導我們去徒步還會問我們感受，下午茶也會問我們有沒有別的需求，想不想喝咖啡等，非常隨和。
整個酒店非常安靜，是我想象中度假的酒店，酒店還養了很多牛羊馬，很親近大自然的感覺。酒店內的洗護用品也非常香，總體來説除了有點遠之外所有都值得五星好評！！
最後的最後，這是我最認真的一次寫評價，以後再來新疆還會選擇這家酒店的，希望酒店更好！

最大的問題在服務方面，可以看出來員工都想把服務做好，整體表現並不符合酒店的定位。
一個是餐廳上菜慢，提前跟前台説了晚餐時間，點了套餐，按時到了之後主菜確實上的快，但是已經不熱了，估計是做好一段時間了。然而主菜都快吃完了，米飯遲遲上不來，催促了好幾次，找服務員、找餐廳經理，等了好久才上來。催完米飯開始催水果，催完水果開始催湯，湯是現成的例湯，不管催誰、催幾遍，可就是上不來，最後實在受不了了，讓餐廳經理給打折，把湯給退了。
第二個問題更讓我們鬱生氣，晚上十二點多房間電話響了，問我們第二天早餐幾個人吃什麼時候吃，無語了，都睡著了把我們吵醒，早幹嘛去了！

msg:被關的太久了，突然就打開手機看想出去玩，就看到了這個酒店在促銷活動，毫不猶豫的就下單了，果然沒有失望，景色簡直太漂亮了，跟人間仙境一樣，視覺感大大的得到了滿足，真恨自己的手機不給力，還好酒店有攝影師，幫我拍攝了絕美的人攝影，酒店坐落於一塊草場之上，沒有阻礙物，可以遠眺連綿不斷的山峯，下午管家陪着我去後面山上徒步，還偶遇了森林精靈，真是處處驚喜，酒店每間房間都有穹頂，透過穹頂照進的陽光非常温暖，房間暖氣很給力，房間很温暖，早餐更是絕絕子，是按照我起床的時間來製作的，選擇種類也很多，吃的很飽，聽説夏天這裏更美麗，期待着夏天也可以搶到促銷再來遊玩，是避世的好地方！

msg:酒店新開的 環境也真的沒得挑 但是但是除了這些也就沒其他了
晚上睡覺牆燈是聲控的 咳嗽聲大點。翻身聲音大一點都會導致整個房間巨亮。最後無奈用東西擋住了光源。
網絡速度極慢、酒店房間內的WIFI信號不穩定，
房間通風不暢。
最氣人的就是服務 沒有做好準備就不要開！！
吃飯整個餐廳就一本賬單。衹有一本。
等了菜單半小時 上菜等了半小時 二人套餐也沒有問了兩個人一個是老闆把 也説不清套餐是什麼菜 衹説兩葷一素 具體看廚師
反覆説不要香菜 上菜還是有 換了一份又是半小時 主食蝦肉蒸餃裏有沒有香菜跟我説確認一下 這時候我已經整餐吃完了。 買單因為上菜過錯打了9折。🙏
入住送兩張賽里木湖門票 説好的訂房間當天會提醒電話也沒有加微信聯繫   直到入住當天6點之前都沒有人聯繫我。面對質疑 前台竟然説“那你主動聯繫我們啊”
其他贈送服務都沒有！！
不解決 不作為 還跟客人頂嘴。4000一晚的酒店極差 非常不滿意。完全沒達到水平 還不如普通精品酒店 衹是周圍環境好  不適合入住浪費錢
