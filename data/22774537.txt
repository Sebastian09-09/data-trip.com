It's especially warm in the lobby. It's very comfortable to make a cup of tea. The room is fully equipped, even nail clippers and laundry detergent are provided, which is a bit unexpected. The toiletries are all from Ferragamo, which is quite classy. When I got up in the morning and opened the curtains, I saw a fairy-like scenery surrounded by clouds and mist. The meals are Anhui cuisine, stinky mandarin fish, hairy tofu, and green vegetables are all delicious. I brought my child with me, and she especially likes to feed squirrels. The hotel also has dogs. There are sheep and pheasants in the outdoor area. The ecological environment is good. There is also a jewelry box in the room, which is very considerate. The service is very good and the breakfast is also very rich. It is a hotel with good humanistic care and service details. It is excellent in all aspects. If I must make a suggestion, it is that the dental floss in the toothbrush can be improved. At present, this one is not very easy to use. Everything else is very good. I will come again. I also heard that the renovation will be upgraded soon. I look forward to coming next time‚ù§Ô∏è

It was very quiet here at night, the stars in the sky were brighter in the dark, there were insects and streams in my ears, and the breeze brought the fragrance of osmanthus.
The osmanthus wine was impressive, fragrant and sweet, and the elderly and children at home liked it very much.
Check in here on Friday, climb Huangshan and stay at the top of the mountain on Saturday, and return on Sunday. It won't be very tiring.

msg:Huangshan Yunshang must have a good review. I have been very busy and finally have time to talk about this surprising homestay! First of all, the location is very good, which is in line with the route of this trip. It is more than ten minutes' drive from Huangshan; the service is also very good. After booking the room on Ctrip, the housekeeper immediately contacted me and told me the route, weather conditions, and confirmed the arrival time. The driver was arranged to pick us up in the evening. The luggage was also helped to get to the room. The waiters and guest rooms in the restaurant were also great. Many details can be seen that they have been trained. The housekeeper's coffee is also good! Let's talk about the environment of the homestay. For people who like to take pictures, I like it too much! We arrived at night, and we were amazed from the beginning of the stairs. I took my friends to take a photo. The retro fireplace, the attic stairs with a sense of age, and the bookshelf on one wall were even more satisfactory when we entered the room. Five stars are not enough. It can be seen that the boss is very attentive, with large floor-to-ceiling windows and a large bathtub. You must take a bubble bath. When you wake up early in the morning and lie on the bed to see the scenery, you can see it in the daytime. You can't finish taking pictures. Every corner and every glass window is a painting. Don't forget to take pictures of the stairs inside! There are also food and drinks. The breakfast is so exquisite that I don‚Äôt know which one to eat. I really want to eat all of them during my stay for a month. The ingredients on the cloud are basically self-sufficient, all organic vegetables. There are vegetable gardens, fish ponds, and a Chuxiu Palace where chickens and lambs are raised. The proprietress Xinjie also invited us to drink tea and told us stories about the cloud like a friend. It‚Äôs really happy to escape from the city and live here, even though it‚Äôs only for two days! There are really surprises here, and many beautiful things still need to be experienced in person. Highly recommended!

msg:This is really a B&B where you can stay on the mountain all day without going down the mountain.

Transportation: Very convenient. We started from Hangzhou and drove directly to Tianhu Scenic Area. The rest is a mountain road that goes directly to Yunshang. If you are good at driving, you can drive up the mountain. If you are not sure, you can park your car below and contact the housekeeper to send a car. To pick.

Eating: Before arriving, I had already ordered food in advance by scanning the QR code. I have been thinking about Chu Xiugong‚Äôs chicken and smelly mandarin fish, and finally had it ~ breakfast is free (so rich), and lunch and dinner are clearly marked.

After resting your feet, you can feed squirrels, sheep, and see the native chickens in Chuxiu Palace. You can go to the observation deck to take beautiful photos, and there is also a celebrity boat in the swimming pool, which is also very photogenic. I looked up at night and the sky was full of stars. I haven‚Äôt seen so many stars in a long time. I borrowed sister A Xin‚Äôs tripod and took it back to the room to take pictures of the stars. Inadvertently, I also photographed shooting stars. I quickly made a wish ing

The configuration in the room is also very considerate. Fruits, snacks, drinks, and disposable supplies are all available and the quality is very good! Even the hair ropes are spared, which is really touching. The bedding is very comfortable, and I sleep very soundly!

It was a free day. Thanks to Yunshang, I have made a lot of progress since we met at the beginning of 2018. Fortunately, the bathtub could not be moved and the wooden stool was too heavy, so I took a set of comparison photos to express my feelings about the time! See you next time~

It is really great to build such a beautiful B&B deep in the mountainsüëçüèª. There are a lot of hydrangeas planted in the B&B. It is estimated that they will not bloom until the end of May or early June. You can imagine how beautiful they are. The disadvantages are that the prices of the dishes are on the expensive side, which is understandable even if you are deep in the mountains. However, the braised crucian carp and Chu Xiugong's chicken soup that I ordered did not meet my expectations. Although the braised crucian carp tastes good in seasoning, the fish should not be cooked alive, and the fish meat is a bit woody. . The chicken soup can only be said to be fresh, but it is still not as good as the best chicken soup. It's still a bit inferior to the crucian carp (freshly killed and grilled, fresh and tender fish) and pheasant chicken at Anji B&B.

You don‚Äôt need to drive up the mountain by your own car (because the road is very narrow). The hotel housekeeper will arrange a car to take you up the mountain.

The breakfastü•£ is also very rich. This kind of homestay with Xiaobao is very suitable for us. It is very comfortable to enjoy delicious food with friends in the open air at night with the breeze blowing.

Unfortunately, I can only show twenty photos, so it‚Äôs difficult to choose.
However, another thing that is difficult to write about is that during the few days I lived in Yunshang, I had too many feelings and touches, related to fate, relationships, and myself. Everything is in the video, but it is a pity that Ctrip can only upload it for thirty seconds, which cannot fully express my perspective and feelings. But no matter what, I think only a place where people can feel at ease can return their hearts to the most stable place.
What a quality B&B should look like, and what you didn‚Äôt expect, are all here. It is recommended that those who are destined to experience it with their hearts...
