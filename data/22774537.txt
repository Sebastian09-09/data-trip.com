I personally feel that whether it is the room layout or the restaurant, including the entire service, I am very satisfied. It is full of details and the experience is excellent. It is indeed worthy of its reputation~
I especially want to praise the restaurant’s food, and the beautiful scenery on the cloud is simply unforgettable. I want to come again after coming here😘😘

msg:It's halfway up the mountain, the scenery is great, the air is great. We even saw a little snow today. Fortunately, there is a fireplace. The staff has been adding firewood in time. It's especially warm in the lobby. It's very comfortable to make a cup of tea. The room is fully equipped, even nail clippers and laundry detergent are provided, which is a bit unexpected. The toiletries are all from Ferragamo, which is quite classy. When I got up in the morning and opened the curtains, I saw a fairy-like scenery surrounded by clouds and mist. The meals are Anhui cuisine, stinky mandarin fish, hairy tofu, and green vegetables are all delicious. I brought my child with me, and she especially likes to feed squirrels. The hotel also has dogs. There are sheep and pheasants in the outdoor area. The ecological environment is good. There is also a jewelry box in the room, which is very considerate. The service is very good and the breakfast is also very rich. It is a hotel with good humanistic care and service details. It is excellent in all aspects. If I must make a suggestion, it is that the dental floss in the toothbrush can be improved. At present, this one is not very easy to use. Everything else is very good. I will come again. I also heard that the renovation will be upgraded soon. I look forward to coming next time❤️

It is recommended to let their driver pick you up😂The comfort of lying on the recliner, watching the white clouds slowly move, the layers of forests swaying in the wind, and the warm sunshine on our bodies made our friends who were traveling with us feel that this trip was worth it. The meals in the clouds are also very delicious. Big Goose needs to be booked in advance, which leaves us looking forward to the next time. 🥰

It was very quiet here at night, the stars in the sky were brighter in the dark, there were insects and streams in my ears, and the breeze brought the fragrance of osmanthus.
The osmanthus wine was impressive, fragrant and sweet, and the elderly and children at home liked it very much.
Check in here on Friday, climb Huangshan and stay at the top of the mountain on Saturday, and return on Sunday. It won't be very tiring.

msg:Huangshan Yunshang must have a good review. I have been very busy and finally have time to talk about this surprising homestay! First of all, the location is very good, which is in line with the route of this trip. It is more than ten minutes' drive from Huangshan; the service is also very good. After booking the room on Ctrip, the housekeeper immediately contacted me and told me the route, weather conditions, and confirmed the arrival time. The driver was arranged to pick us up in the evening. The luggage was also helped to get to the room. The waiters and guest rooms in the restaurant were also great. Many details can be seen that they have been trained. The housekeeper's coffee is also good! Let's talk about the environment of the homestay. For people who like to take pictures, I like it too much! We arrived at night, and we were amazed from the beginning of the stairs. I took my friends to take a photo. The retro fireplace, the attic stairs with a sense of age, and the bookshelf on one wall were even more satisfactory when we entered the room. Five stars are not enough. It can be seen that the boss is very attentive, with large floor-to-ceiling windows and a large bathtub. You must take a bubble bath. When you wake up early in the morning and lie on the bed to see the scenery, you can see it in the daytime. You can't finish taking pictures. Every corner and every glass window is a painting. Don't forget to take pictures of the stairs inside! There are also food and drinks. The breakfast is so exquisite that I don’t know which one to eat. I really want to eat all of them during my stay for a month. The ingredients on the cloud are basically self-sufficient, all organic vegetables. There are vegetable gardens, fish ponds, and a Chuxiu Palace where chickens and lambs are raised. The proprietress Xinjie also invited us to drink tea and told us stories about the cloud like a friend. It’s really happy to escape from the city and live here, even though it’s only for two days! There are really surprises here, and many beautiful things still need to be experienced in person. Highly recommended!

msg:This is really a B&B where you can stay on the mountain all day without going down the mountain.

Transportation: Very convenient. We started from Hangzhou and drove directly to Tianhu Scenic Area. The rest is a mountain road that goes directly to Yunshang. If you are good at driving, you can drive up the mountain. If you are not sure, you can park your car below and contact the housekeeper to send a car. To pick.

Eating: Before arriving, I had already ordered food in advance by scanning the QR code. I have been thinking about Chu Xiugong’s chicken and smelly mandarin fish, and finally had it ~ breakfast is free (so rich), and lunch and dinner are clearly marked.

After resting your feet, you can feed squirrels, sheep, and see the native chickens in Chuxiu Palace. You can go to the observation deck to take beautiful photos, and there is also a celebrity boat in the swimming pool, which is also very photogenic. I looked up at night and the sky was full of stars. I haven’t seen so many stars in a long time. I borrowed sister A Xin’s tripod and took it back to the room to take pictures of the stars. Inadvertently, I also photographed shooting stars. I quickly made a wish ing

The configuration in the room is also very considerate. Fruits, snacks, drinks, and disposable supplies are all available and the quality is very good! Even the hair ropes are spared, which is really touching. The bedding is very comfortable, and I sleep very soundly!

It was a free day. Thanks to Yunshang, I have made a lot of progress since we met at the beginning of 2018. Fortunately, the bathtub could not be moved and the wooden stool was too heavy, so I took a set of comparison photos to express my feelings about the time! See you next time~

Any song you listen to. I would love to come to this kind of B&B again

msg:The environment on the mountain is great. You can see Daohuang Mountain in the distance, and the air is fresh. It is suitable for guests who come to the city to relax and breathe oxygen. It is really great to build such a beautiful B&B deep in the mountains👍🏻. There are a lot of hydrangeas planted in the B&B. It is estimated that they will not bloom until the end of May or early June. You can imagine how beautiful they are. The disadvantages are that the prices of the dishes are on the expensive side, which is understandable even if you are deep in the mountains. However, the braised crucian carp and Chu Xiugong's chicken soup that I ordered did not meet my expectations. Although the braised crucian carp tastes good in seasoning, the fish should not be cooked alive, and the fish meat is a bit woody. . The chicken soup can only be said to be fresh, but it is still not as good as the best chicken soup. It's still a bit inferior to the crucian carp (freshly killed and grilled, fresh and tender fish) and pheasant chicken at Anji B&B.

The breakfast was rich and the chef’s skills were very good. The most unforgettable thing was the way up the mountain. We arrived at around 8pm. It rained heavily, and the excitement along the way made me perfect my driving skills.
There is nothing to say about the new lady boss, her clothes, and her temperament. When she introduced her original intention of starting a B&B, what she saw was her respect for life and her love for the present. She was a person of admiration and admiration! This time we caught up with the heavy fog. It was a different trip to Huangshan and a different Huangshan cloud. I will come again.

I got to know the kind and beautiful proprietress who is working hard on her dream

The food is delicious 😋 KTV is also free to use.

You don’t need to drive up the mountain by your own car (because the road is very narrow). The hotel housekeeper will arrange a car to take you up the mountain. The surrounding environment of the road up the mountain is not satisfactory. After arriving at the hotel, there will be a feeling of a cave...

The breakfast🥣 is also very rich. This kind of homestay with Xiaobao is very suitable for us. It is very comfortable to enjoy delicious food with friends in the open air at night with the breeze blowing.

Hope to have a chance to stay next time.

There are really too many details that can be released and displayed, such as buildings, courtyards, orchards, sheep houses, viewing platforms, rooms, scenery, furnishings, flowers and plants and various spiritual animals, food, wine, good tea, coffee... …
Unfortunately, I can only show twenty photos, so it’s difficult to choose.
However, another thing that is difficult to write about is that during the few days I lived in Yunshang, I had too many feelings and touches, related to fate, relationships, and myself. Everything is in the video, but it is a pity that Ctrip can only upload it for thirty seconds, which cannot fully express my perspective and feelings. But no matter what, I think only a place where people can feel at ease can return their hearts to the most stable place.
What a quality B&B should look like, and what you didn’t expect, are all here. It is recommended that those who are destined to experience it with their hearts...

雲上成功的祕訣在於boss 新的“用心”給娃們提前做了芒果果凍，一盆果凍一會就吃光了，大叫好吃😋。第二天又製作冬瓜糖，一邊做一邊還跟住客講拍攝的方法和點位，被我們拉着給孩子們拍了一組漢服照片，相當的出彩。
如果問為何要重複六次去，其實很簡單，因為孩子想去。相比周圍的民宿，雲上的性價比很高，因為來這裏不是光住了民宿，而且享受了一大片的自然環境。
環境不野，孩子户外撒歡着，而我們大人能安心喝茶聊天，都解放了彼此呢……

msg:開業五年，第四次去度假，似乎已經成為每年的一個念想，擁抱一下熟悉的大BOSS阿新，能乾的店長英子事無鉅細關心，小蔣管家不辭辛苦接接送送，搬搬扛扛，大廚和和阿姨們的一天三頓都讓你胃口大開……反正度假躺平非黃山雲上莫屬。

msg:很棒的民宿,有進入世外桃源的感覺。老闆娘很熱情,請我們品嚐了她自己泡製的桂花紅茶,口感很好。房間也乾乾淨淨的,面對着大片竹林,讓人看着就心情舒暢,特別是早上起來,呼吸一口新鮮空氣,真的是神清氣爽一整天。民宿的餐食也不錯,有着當地的特色。下次還會再來。

msg:一個有氣質的地方。在山坡地帶，這裏保留了許多自然美景。沉浸在美麗的田園生活中，同時體驗高品質的文宿。必須提到文宿的設計。空間設計的細節—一切都牢記客人對自然的體驗。業主不遺餘力的心思。毛巾清洗兩次並消毒。拖鞋質地柔軟，您可以帶回家以備不時之需。洗漱用品特意來自歐洲，以天然成分為核心。

管家團隊——可愛可愛的團隊。總是温暖的微笑。

他們衹使用山裡的水，在浴室裏，在做飯時。一切都是自製的。他們種植自己的農產品並擁有自己的雞！農場到餐桌。時令，美味，煮至完美。

非常感謝店主與我們分享的特色茶。並從她那裡聽到建立背後的故事。

期待很快回來。

房間很棒，270度的全景落地玻璃，衞生間也是全景落地窗，超級贊，私隱玻璃也不用擔心外面能看見，地暖也很暖和，都不用穿拖鞋，很舒服～
房間配置齊全温馨，首飾架、加濕器，能用到的基本都有
飯菜味道也很好吃，餐具擺盤也很精緻，整個環境超級棒～
