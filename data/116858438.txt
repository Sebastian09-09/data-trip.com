Although the hotel is still under construction, the overall feeling is very good, the environment is quiet, you can see the hotel garden from the terrace, the view is good, and it has been upgraded. In the room, the young lady enthusiastically introduced the local attractions. All in all very satisfied.

However, it is also because it is too close to the scenic spot that the traffic jam is serious. If you drive by yourself, you must pay attention to avoid peak travel

msg:The hotel is very new and well-equipped. The environment is super awesome. The children like the garden landscape in the hotel very much. The service is very good. Every service staff greets us with a smile. When they see my little girl, they also thoughtfully give her a children's bathing supplies set, upgrade the room for free, give welcome fruit, provide comfortable latex pillows and children's pillows, and have a rich breakfast with regional specialties such as spicy soup and beef soup. I really like it very much. I am reluctant to leave. I will stay here next time! ! ! In addition, it is very close to the Longmen Grottoes. The geographical location is perfect. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the Northeast Gate Service Center.

msg:This hotel is top-notch in Luoyang. It is newly opened and in trial operation. The hotel has upgraded the room type and provided free breakfast. The room is large with a terrace. It has a little bit of decoration. The hotel is very well equipped and covers a large area. The second phase is still under construction. The scenery is very good and it is very close to Longmen Grottoes! The gym is also fully equipped with parks, swimming pools, SPA centers, entertainment areas, etc. (the swimming pool was not visited). This price is very good value. It will be a very good choice for you to go to Luoyang in the future! A small suggestion is that the door of the room is a bit inferior, and the texture of the door lock is not good, which is very low-grade! The interior decoration of the room is at most 4 stars, and the quality of the service staff is still very high, but the night bed service can be better, and the hygiene should be clean! The overall hotel level in Luoyang does not feel too high, and the charges and service facilities are not proportional. There is still a big gap compared with the hotel industry in Xi'an! I hope to work hard!

The hotel is new, the decoration still has some flavor, it is not very popular, and there is no supporting facilities around the hotel. The back garden of the hotel is still under renovation, but it blends well with nature. At night, I fell asleep to the sound of hundreds of frogs in the garden pond.

msg:The hotel environment is good. The breakfast is also good with a lot of varieties. After all, it is a standard reception hotel. It is newly opened and everything is in the state of trial operation. It is very close to the Longmen Grottoes scenic area and very convenient. Thank you Manager Kang Rong for upgrading the view room and exempting the children from breakfast. The refrigerator in the room is broken and cannot be used. I brought Chinese medicine that needs to be refrigerated and helped us solve it in time. 
When I got off the car at the hotel, no one helped me with the luggage and no one showed me the way. I walked into the gate with a confused face and looked around to find the front desk to check in. 
The taste and quality of the food in the Chinese restaurant on the first floor need to be improved. It does not match the level of the hotel. 
When checking out, I walked around twice before I got to the cashier. I asked the waiter who took me there why I couldn’t bring the machine to scan the code. This is too far. She told me that because it was newly opened and the private rooms are here... I said that the private rooms are important. 
After scanning the code, I paid while walking. I lowered my head to look at my phone and bumped into a wooden carving ornament next to the cashier. The waiter who took me to check out came over and asked me if I was okay. The wood is too hard. It really hurts. I rubbed it and told her that I was okay. Fortunately, my nose is real, not fake. Otherwise it would be troublesome.
I found my nose bleeding after I got back to the restaurant. My husband told me that it was swollen and blue. I couldn’t take a picture. It’s nothing. I think it was my own carelessness. Because it was blue, the blood bruises couldn’t go away, and the area under my eyes was blue.
But when I looked up, I saw the waiter secretly laughing and walking over to say something to a person who looked like a manager. I guess he said that I had this accident because after a while, the manager came over and saw me applying ice to my nose with a watermelon. Then he said, “I’ll get you some ice.” After a while, he gave me some ice cubes in a disposable glove.
But my nose was broken, the bones were hard, and the ice cubes were hard. Wouldn’t it hurt more if I applied it?
I’m not an unreasonable and unreasonable person. I think it was my own accident. I don’t want to blame or complain about anyone. After all, it’s not easy for the staff. But what do you mean by secretly laughing at me? Do you think I deserve it? Who made me sit in a position where I could see your expression? I also wish I didn't see it. It made me feel uncomfortable (you can check the surveillance). If you meet someone who is difficult to talk to, can you say that this waiter took the customer to pay the bill. When the customer lowered his head and kept walking forward to pay, you didn't stop him when he was about to touch you. You just stood there. Are you also responsible?
It was originally a happy journey, but it ended up being very depressing.

The hotel is relatively new, with garden-style accommodation, the lobby is particularly domineering, and the inside is also very luxurious. The buffet is rich and delicious, and snacks and fruits are also provided. The hotel's front desk service and welcome were very good. Xiao Ma was very enthusiastic. There was also a front desk lady who carried our luggage throughout the entire stay and also introduced tour routes. A very good and value-for-money experience.

msg:A very bad stay experience: 1. The first room I was given had a very strong smell. After negotiation, the hotel changed the room, but it still had a strong smell. I wanted to open the balcony door for ventilation, but the balcony door had no screen. After opening the door, small mosquitoes in the garden would fly into the room. Later, the hotel provided an air purifier. After turning it on all night, the machine noise was also noisy all night. The whole room still had a strong smell of decoration. When I got up in the morning, my eyes were swollen and my throat was uncomfortable. It was very unsuitable for living, and it was not recommended to bring children to stay! 2. The toilet in the changed room was loose and blocked. I had to wait for the engineer to dredge it when I returned to the hotel in the early morning; 3. When checking in, the hotel front desk sent 2 breakfasts. Because I had an appoin**ent with a tour guide to Longmen Grottoes in the morning, I sat down to eat breakfast in the morning, so I went in and took two small boxes of yogurt. The catering front desk immediately stopped me and said that it was not allowed. I explained the situation, and the restaurant manager only said no! Instead of trying to solve the needs of the guests in any way, I could only put down 2 small boxes of yogurt. After checking out, I reported the situation to the lobby manager. After waiting for about half an hour, there was no active response because I could not contact the restaurant manager! After checking out, I didn't get any phone calls back. Actually, this is a small matter, but as a hotel with a room rate of 1,058 yuan, this kind of service attitude is really perfunctory, and the stay experience is extremely bad! So, I can't go against my conscience and give it five stars according to your hotel's requirements! I want to tell everyone my feelings about staying here fairly! I think the hotel should first ensure the personal safety and health safety of the guests staying in the hotel, and then talk about supporting facilities

msg:First of all, the hotel is very new and the hygiene is very good. Secondly, the people in the basic management positions of the hotel are of high quality, very enthusiastic, and solve problems very quickly! The assistant manager of the lobby enthusiastically introduced the delicious food and fun things in Luoyang when I arrived on the first day. Knowing that my car was charging, he took the initiative to call me and said that it was convenient for me to go to the car from the room.
However, people in basic positions always make some small mistakes, such as extending the stay, the wrong room card time, and the room card was invalid when I came back at night. There was also a wrong number of breakfast portions, and I went to the breakfast room to wait for them to confirm. The noodle chef made the wrong dish I asked for. Therefore, one star was deducted for the service part. However, all of them were perfectly solved with the active communication and remedy of the basic management personnel of the hotel. I was originally going to stay for one night. I stayed for 3 nights directly. It was really great! The laundry service was very fast!
As for the facilities, one star was deducted because the toilet in the room was loose. It made a sound when I sat down, and it made another sound when I stood up. It didn't affect the use, so I didn't care too much.

It is still listed as a 5-star hotel, but it costs more than 1,800 yuan a night. There is really no supervision. The breakfast is average, there are not many things, and few western pastries.

更讓人感動的是，我停車時沒關天窗，夜晚下雨，我早已忘記此事。早上退房後，駕車離開時才發現天窗上蓋好整齊嚴實的防雨布，一定是酒店保安幫忙蓋的，頓時感覺心頭暖暖的，住了許多酒店，伊水酒店讓我感動了，謝謝。
