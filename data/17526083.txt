msg:Wow. We are traveling around China and this hotel had to be one of the best so far. The location is amazing. It’s steps from the river and minutes to must see destinations. The hotel rooms were so beautiful we had a hard time deciding to leave our hotel or just look at sights from our window. The service was also top notch, we were shown to our room and was given a well versed set of destinations for our day. The restaurant at the top of the hotel also happens to be one of the best in the area. They even have a free photography session for you but you have to rsvp in advance which we missed but hope you see this review and book with them a day in advance!! Def stay here!

Great view from hotel restaurant. Good options for breakfast and all amenities are really good. All fruits/snacks/drinks in the hotel are free. Have you ever seen toiletries in hotels look this good (see attached photo)? Best of all, their customer service is top notch.  Everyone works there are very polite and helpful. I highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are at Guilin, probably the best you can find.

msg:Bo Yin Hotel (Li River Secluded Hotel)
Our visit to Guilin was to spend time with my wife’s large family and we twice stayed at the Li River Secluded hotel, for a total of 7 nights. Our expectations of a hotel experience are high, so we avoid using American chain hotels when possible. The Li River Secluded hotel more than met those expectations by combining exceptional customer service with a laid back, but luxurious guest experience. On arrival, we were offered a room upgrade. The upgrade accommodation was located on the ground floor, so this did not appeal to us until we were shown the room … the suite was spacious and tastefully furnished with a Zen motif that included a ceremonial tea table. Both my wife and I practice daily yoga, so the ample floor space immediately appealed to us. A room-width picture window featured a view of the Li River Lake and its pair of pagodas. Remote-controlled drapes and shears sound-proofed and eliminated light from the room when closed.
 
A buffet daily breakfast on the 8th (top) floor was included and featured a good selection of both Chinese and Western options. We had family commitments that prevented us from eating dinner at the restaurant, but my wife hosted an afternoon tea session in the restaurant for some of her friends and the tea and pastries were excellent. In addition, fresh fruit was placed in the room every day, and the room refrigerator was refreshed daily with water, sodas, and snacks.
 
The hotel was generally maintained in pristine condition and effected the highest standards of cleanliness. This applied to all the facilities apart from a small exercise room on the 5th floor. This consisted of a set of barbells (no bench), a fixed weight station (functional), and 2 treadmills, neither of which functioned properly … that said, I did use the weight station and the patio outside of the exercise room for yoga on a couple warmer days. There was also a guest laundry on the 5th floor which my wife used on one occasion.
 
The customer service attitude in Chinese hotels is generally an improvement on what we are accustomed to in North America, but at the Bo Yin Hotel it’s exceptional. This means that English language speakers (I’m Canadian and my wife is Chinese by birth) would experience no problem in addressing any of the front desk, maid, or restaurant personnel. For those who prefer to order take-out food, a robotic delivery service is used, a feature that tends to fascinate any child you might be traveling with.

Speaking of Guilin's cultural landmarks, the Sun and Moon Towers are well-deserved

The golden Sun Tower, 41 meters high, is the tallest existing copper tower in the world

The silver Moon Tower, 35 meters high, is a unique seven-story glazed tower

The two towers shine together, facing each other from afar, forming a unique picture with the lake, curved bridges and woods

At the same time, the two towers form a "easy" character

When planning this trip to Guilin, I will take a good look at this Feng Shui building complex as a goal

So when choosing a hotel, I compared it many times and chose the [Lijiang Boyin Hotel] with the best viewing position

But I was still surprised when I checked in. I knew it was close to the scenic spot, but I didn't expect to go downstairs directly to the scenic spot

You can see the Sun and Moon Towers from different angles in the room, lounge, restaurant and terrace

Walk three Minutes, key scenic spots [Jingjiang Palace, East and West Lane, Zhengyang Pedestrian Street] are all directly accessible 
I accidentally lived in the most golden location in this city 
I sincerely give you a suggestion, don't take a taxi if you live in this location 
It is likely that it will take longer to take a taxi than to walk for 3-5 minutes 

In addition, the hotel is equipped with very complete facilities, and the room environment is high-end. 
The gym, laundry room, restaurant, Starlight Lounge, SPA trea**ent and other supporting specifications are very good 
The Starlight Lounge and restaurant are the most pleasant night view viewing places in the city 
The sun and the moon shine together in the leisurely and close museum; the beautiful scenery in the painting that responds to the mountains and rivers 

In addition, I have to say that the richness of breakfast is really a shot of heart after the rampage scenic spots 
The breakfast rice noodles are of course also starting at 2 bowls. After tasting the flavor that captures the heart, you will definitely be able to empathize! 

Get up early and sit on the best viewing platform of the twin towers on the terrace of the room, 
Watch the vast clouds and smoke of the Lijiang River, and the twin towers stand silently 
I really deeply feel the most deeply rooted charm of Guilin, a city of mountains and rivers.

It is very close to Elephant Trunk Hill and can be reached on foot. The taste of the Yunding Restaurant on the roof is also very good, and it is also a good place to enjoy the scenery. When checking in, because I was waiting for the room to be cleaned, the front desk specially gave me a beautiful afternoon tea, which was an unexpected surprise, and also gave me a free airport shuttle. Thank you very much! The Fox Look shooting card distributed during this stay was very good. The shooting team had a warm service attitude. The makeup of the makeup artist was very delicate, and the photos taken were also very satisfactory. The photos were fast, and I could select the photos immediately after shooting.

Not far away are the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. After turning on the lights at night, the night view of the Sun and Moon Twin Towers is beautiful. It is so pleasant to lie on the balcony chair, drink tea and watch the scenery.
There is also a large terrace on the top floor of the hotel, and the view will be more open. The twin towers feel close at hand. The weather is good today, and I can see the beautiful sunset. I have a new Chinese afternoon tea with my sister on the terrace. Not only is it delicious, but it is also very photogenic.
The hotel breakfast is also excellent. You can eat the special Guilin rice noodles. After eating, walk a few steps and go directly to the Xiangshan Scenic Area. It is very suitable for bringing your family to play and live~

The price is slightly higher than the old five-star Sheraton a few hundred meters away, but you will know the reason when you stay there. The receptionist at the door is very enthusiastic and in place, and the luggage is delivered to the room. The customer service also prepared buckwheat pillows for the elderly in advance. The room is reasonably designed, large and comfortable. Whether it is the luggage room, bathroom, or shower room, they are all designed thoughtfully. There are also balcony cushion chairs for drinking tea. The breakfast is rich, nutritious, healthy and delicious. The Yunding Restaurant on the eighth floor has a beautiful view, which is beyond words. Downstairs is the lakeside of the Sun and Moon Tower Park, which is quiet in the bustle. Take a walk after dinner and the night view is charming. It is only five or six hundred meters away from the free Xiangshan Park. I stayed for three days and gave souvenirs before leaving. It is really comfortable and makes people feel that all the beauty of Guilin is in sight!

It is very convenient to walk to the Elephant Trunk Hill and the Two Rivers and Four Lakes Cruise Terminal. It is very friendly to the elderly and children. You can go back to the hotel to rest at any time when you are tired, or you can go to the scenic spot to check in early in the morning. There is no need to worry about queuing or crowds. The catering and service are also great. It is the first choice for traveling to Guilin during the holidays👍👍👍

msg:From the doorman to the front desk, cleaning, customer service, to the restaurant waiter, chef and the masseur who helped me relax, every employee we met did their best to help us, making us feel at home and like a spring breeze! Thank you to everyone on duty here!

Let's start with the very patient front desk lady Shiyi and the doorman brother! 😊 In addition, my eldest daughter has a severe nut allergy (Anaphylactic reaction). When faced with choosing food, I am often worried about stepping on thunder, but during last night's dinner and this morning's breakfast, the waiters Zhong Jie and Yueyue helped me communicate with the kitchen very carefully to confirm that the food she ate, including cooking and baking oil, did not contain peanuts/peanut oil, and carefully ensured that there was no cross-infection. When it was not sure whether there was a nut source, fruit salad was provided as an alternative, so that we could enjoy our delicious food safely and happily.

The view from the top floor and our lakeside room is first-class. The location of the hotel is also great. After dinner, the weather is no longer hot. Walking along the water for two hours to check in the night view of Shanhu, Sun and Moon Twin Towers and Ancient South Gate is perfect! Without further ado, the following pictures are proof!

Other hotel facilities such as the self-service laundry room and gym are also great, especially the presence of washing machines and dryers. If you have suffered from the "return of the south wind", you will know how much money these two make and how fragrant they are! 😁😁😁

Finally, I would like to thank the masseuse Sister Zeng, whose work number is No. 1. She has very skillful techniques, strong strength, and humorous conversation. I learned a lot of health tips during the one-hour communication with her. Thank you!

All in all, staying at Lijiang Boyin is the most pleasant experience we have had since we hit the jackpot. We look forward to seeing you again soon!

The room decoration is also very good, with the Sun and Moon Tower right outside the window. The location is excellent, very close to Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, Elephant Trunk Hill, and East-West Alley. It only takes a few minutes to walk there. highly recommended! ! ! . Very pleasant trip.

msg:Very nice 👍🏻 hotel. Beautiful landscape. Once you open the window, you will see the Sun and Moon Phase Tower. ￼￼Invincible geographical location￼￼As soon as you get downstairs, you will reach Shan Lake, one of the four lakes in Guilin, and it is also the boating point for lake tours. 300 meters ahead is the Elephant Trunk Mountain Scenic Area. It is also the embarkation point for cruising the Li River.
But the best thing is the service. We were upgraded for free and there were gifts when we left.
The room was big and clean. fully equipped. There are many details that show that the hotel has put a lot of thought into it. Free water is available. Really great value for money.
When it comes to home-cooked breakfast, the waiter will pop out to serve you when you need it👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

msg:I checked into Boyin Hotel on March 5th. What attracted me at first was the name of the hotel. I thought it was very elegant. After I arrived, I felt that I had made the right choice. There were two kinds of tea in the lobby, Luo Han Guo tea and Brown Sugar Ginger Tea. We particularly liked it. There are drinks, fruits and snacks. There is water on every floor. What makes it more convenient for me is that the toilet and shower are separated. I have stayed in many hotels. When my family takes a shower, I always go to the public toilet on another floor. The staff Very enthusiastic and helped us carry our luggage. The restaurant is on the top floor and you can enjoy the view of the Sun and Moon Tower. The scenery is charming. We will choose our hotel again in the future.

The hotel provides an airport pick-up service, and a butler will lead you to the room after check-in. The master bedroom of the room is equipped with a projection screen, and the viewing effect is good. I also tried the hotel's Chinese restaurant on the first night. The service and food delivery speed were good. I ordered a set meal for 4 people and the food tasted pretty good! The only thing I recommend is the quality of the breakfast, which cannot match the five-star standard and is at most four stars. It is recommended that the hotel improve the quality of breakfast, after all, the hotel price is not low. The overall experience is good!

I stayed in Boyin for three days and two nights without any trouble. It was a very good accommodation experience! Special thanks to Manager Luo, who wears glasses, is tall and has a friendly attitude, for his patient explanations and considerate service. The location of Poyin is excellent, right next to the Twin Towers Park. From the window, you can see the beautiful lake view and the mountains in the distance, which are so beautiful. Guests can even see the excellent scenery in the Yunduan Hall, which is different in morning and evening, and it is rainy. There are different kinds of beauty on different sunny days. In particular, I would like to say that Yun Duan Restaurant is very high-quality in terms of ingredients, cooking, and service. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast dishes, they taste very good, especially Guilin rice noodles. The waiter will tell you The authentic way to eat it must be without soup, it’s so delicious [Rose] [Rose] This Poyin Hotel is located in the best scenic spot, very close to Xiangshan Park, the cruise ship pier and Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, so The lobby and front desk space are a bit cramped. The hotel has designed more space for the rooms, especially the first-line lake view balcony room we stayed in is on the upper floor, with a panoramic view of the lake, and is very cost-effective.

It is convenient to take photos when walking to Xiangshan Scenic Area, Two Rivers and Four Lakes Scenic Area, East-West Alley, Jingjiang Palace Scenic Area, Xiaoyao Tower and other scenic spots.
One-stop shopping for eating, drinking and having fun can really satisfy you

The parking area gave people a residential feel, but when I got out of the car, the service attitude of the security guard and the lobby manager made me feel much better. They even took the initiative to say that a room had just become available today. Do you need a free upgrade? Overall, I can feel that the staff at this hotel are very cohesive, which proves that their boss or general manager has good management. The sanitary facilities inside are OK. We like the smell of their shampoo and shower gel, so I came back the next day brand new. All taken away, haha. The detail that makes me feel comfortable is that there is a small black rubber band inside the shower cap box. That little thing is not valuable but it makes me feel comfortable. The only drawback is that the toothbrush keeps shedding hair. The toothbrush is actually quite comfortable, but it sheds hair, haha. I saw a few guests in the lobby who were dissatisfied with the external parking environment and said they wanted to check out. My feeling is that for this location and price, it's actually okay. A hotel cannot ask for a perfect score. An eight-point satisfaction score is actually very good. Even if I want to be 100% satisfied, my wallet will not allow it. The view from the rooftop of the hotel is really nice, and dining in the hotel is also very comfortable.

It’s always a rainy day when I come to Guilin. The first attraction I checked in, the Sun and Moon Twin Towers, was actually on the hotel balcony! ! ! Posted to pyq and many people asked about this hahaha

I did a guide before I came here. It is a C-level hotel in the Lijiang River. It is facing the two rivers and four lakes. It is only a few minutes walk to the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. The lounge and restaurant on the top floor of the hotel are also used to take pictures of the Twin Towers. Great location! ! !

The lake view room we booked has a super wide view. There is also a small tea room in the room. On rainy days, I can play and take pictures with my sisters in the hotel!

You must try the lounge and breakfast. It’s quite nice to sit by the floor-to-ceiling windows when the Sun and Moon Twin Towers are lit up at night. If the weather is nice, you can eat breakfast on the terrace! Taking photos and checking in is definitely a great photo opportunity! !

.
The mini bar also has coffee and snacks
There is also welcome fruit when you check in, which is very considerate.
There are book bars, swimming pools and gyms!

The hotel is located in the Two Rivers and Four Lakes Scenic Area, within 10 minutes' walk of Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street, East-West Alley, Jingjiang Prince's Mansion, and Elephant Trunk Hill. There are not too many breakfast varieties, but they are all exquisite. The observation deck outside the restaurant is very good for taking pictures.

The area around the hotel is very leisurely and lively a little further away. You can walk and go shopping, and you can find all kinds of takeaways. There is a separate cloakroom, toilet and bathroom in the room. The disadvantages are that the parking space is tight, and the room is centrally air-conditioned, so the temperature cannot be adjusted according to personal feeling. It will be uncomfortable after taking a bath. The service at the front desk is average, and the hotel is basically unable to provide help services when traveling to various attractions. Overall, I'm satisfied.

When I went to Guilin with my friends, I was really surprised by the Lijiang Boyin Hotel! I really like the "laid back" a**osphere design of their home, and the location is great!
-
It's right in the city center, surrounded by Xiangshan Scenic Area, Two Rivers and Four Lakes, East and West Lanes, and Jingjiang Prince's Mansion Scenic Area. It's very convenient for travel! I like the view here very much. The layout of the room is quite simple, but when you get up and open the window, you can see the beautiful Sun and Moon Twin Towers, and you can also see the sunset and mountains at night. I think everyone will not love this view. Bar?
-
The view from the hotel is pretty good, and their buffet is delicious! Especially for breakfast, you can also enjoy authentic Guilin rice noodles!
-
In the evening or when you are bored, just call your friends and go to Zhengyang Pedestrian Street of the Cultural Palace for a walk, and you will feel so comfortable!

The hotel room is very comfortable and warm
The breakfast is also good. It combines Chinese and Western food and also has local rice noodles and camellia.
Hotel staff are warm and considerate
The most satisfying hotel for 4 days and 3 nights in Yangshuo, Guilin. Although the price is also the most expensive, it is worth the money.

First of all, the hotel is relatively new in Guilin. The room was large and spacious after the free upgrade. I have never seen so many square meters in the foyer, and the supplies are also online. Hygiene is very good.
The hotel staff are friendly, conscientious and responsive to all requests. The breakfast room also proactively solicited opinions. It rained on the day of check-out, so the lady at the front desk took the initiative to give us shoe covers to prevent our shoes from getting wet.
The temperature dropped that day, but my heart felt warm!

msg:I looked at many hotels before traveling and finally chose this one.

🍃Environment: The environment is really good. The lobby is clean and a**ospheric, and there are seats where you can work and chat. I do some work every night. There are also products such as mosquito repellent water, which is very considerate.
The house is also very clean. The bed and bathroom are very neat and new. There is no smell. Since I have children, I am really satisfied with this. Cleanliness is also very efficient after going out every day. When I come back at noon, I find that it is already clean.

🍲The restaurant upstairs tastes very good. My son asked to eat here for three consecutive nights. Every time, it was a disc operation. My old mother was so happy. In time for Halloween, she even gave me homemade cookies. They are low in sugar and delicious. The child is very happy. The view from the 8th floor overlooks the Sun and Moon Twin Towers, which is great.

🤵♀️Service: Very good, responsive and efficient. After check-in, there is a dedicated housekeeper to solve all kinds of problems, and there is also a robot delivery, which the children like very much.

🕶️Convenience of travel: This hotel is right on the edge of the two rivers and four lakes, so it is very convenient to go anywhere. 5 minutes to the pedestrian street, there are a lot of delicious food, beer fish, rice noodles, etc., there are many delicious shops, no surprises.

Just across the pedestrian street is Jingjiang Prince's Mansion, which is very convenient.
It takes five minutes to reach Gate 3 of Elephant Trunk Hill.

Walking along the river at night, there are also a**ospheric cafes and street nightlife, nice~

A very satisfying stay. I will stay here again next time I come to Guilin.

It’s so beautiful🥹🥹🥹
There is also an infinity swimming pool on the 5th floor, which is perfect for taking pictures!

msg:I was traveling to Yangshuo West Street for a walk with my family, and suddenly found this hotel with a lot of design, and immediately decided to check in🌆
✅The hotel has an excellent location, with 180-degree floor-to-ceiling windows, you can also enjoy the beautiful view of West Street from the room. For girls who like to take pictures, the minimalist industrial design style here makes it a blockbuster with just one shot!
✅The hotel lobby is huge! There is a one-stop bar, book bar, and beautiful chandeliers. The color combination is comfortable yet high-end. The design of the entire space is overwhelming!
✅There is no doubt that the most important thing when staying in a hotel is hygiene. BO Hotel has really done a great job. The items in the room are very comprehensive, such as bathtub, bathrobe, bath slippers, earplugs, etc.
To sum up, I recommend everyone to come to this hotel, it’s very cost-effective👍

2. The room I booked has a tea room, but because I didn’t bring it with me, there is no free tea in the room, and I didn’t enjoy it. The cheapest white tea in the hotel costs 128 yuan. It is recommended to put some free or cheap experience tea.

I must give the hotel a thumbs up here👍 The restaurant on the 8th floor of the hotel is also great, with pleasant scenery, exquisite and unique dishes, and a rich breakfast. The service staff are warm and thoughtful, as long as you put forward your needs, you can respond immediately without waiting for a long time. The hotel is also equipped with a robot waiter. I just called to ask for a few bottles of water, and the robot waiter brought a few large bottles of water in a while.

The restaurant on the eighth floor has a beautiful view, and the dishes and taste need to be improved, but one thing to say, the price/performance ratio is still very high, and the seat by the window is not low.
Overall, I am very satisfied, and my friends who are traveling with me have always praised this room is really good 👍

It is a five-minute walk to Elephant Trunk Hill and a 10-minute walk to Zhengyang Pedestrian Street. There are also many restaurant options in the surrounding area. I booked the hotel's little yellow duck high-low parent-child bed. The facilities for children are very complete, and there are free fruits, drinks and snacks every day. The hotel service is also very considerate. They also gave small gifts when leaving the hotel. It is very warm and the children like it very much. !

A few minutes walk from the hotel is Gate 3 of the famous scenic spot Elephant Trunk Mountain, where tourists can switch between rest and play at will. The hotel is not high, but the rooms are large. The 80-square-meter king-size bed room with a view on the 6th floor has a reasonable layout. It not only has a balcony with a lounge chair, but also a small tea room. It is really comfortable to make a pot of tea and enjoy the beautiful scenery outside the window!
The hotel's breakfast is also remarkable. A bowl of hot rice noodles with plenty of ingredients, a cup of freshly beaten black sesame and walnut juice and a variety of local snacks, you can feel the hotel's full sincerity!
The last thing to say is the service. The administrator directing the parking at the door, the smiling and patient young man at the front desk, and the clean and hygienic cleaning of the guest rooms all reflect the warm and hospitable spirit of Guilin people.
I wish Guilin Lijiang Boyin Hotel a prosperous business, and I wish Guangxi’s tourism industry to become bigger and stronger!

msg:This year I plan to take my mother-in-law and mother on a trip
The first stop in Guilin is on the way
I read a lot of homework
I don't want special forces outings, and I don't want crowds
Then take them to the hotel in the landscape painting
The room is big enough for the three of us
There is also a tea room in the room
How can Chaoshan people miss a pot of Kung Fu tea?
I really like their cloud restaurant and lounge
You can have a panoramic view of the Li River and the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas
It's too hot in the afternoon to go out
Spent a leisurely afternoon tea here
Dinner is also settled in the cloud restaurant
By the way, I watched the sunset 🌇
I took my mother-in-law for a walk after dinner when it was cool
Walk for ten minutes and you will arrive at the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas. The night view is also beautiful.
The view location is excellent, you don't have to go anywhere
But it seems to have been everywhere
travel with elders
Slow travel is best
The most important thing is that they are comfortable and happy!

It is really lucky to find a homestay with such a good environment🏨!

The environment of their home is really good, nothing to say➿! Not only is it located by the riverside, but you can also enjoy the superb scenery of Guilin. It’s hard not to admit it. The layout of the room is also my favorite. I open the windows in the morning and let the sunlight shine in ☀️ , the whole body and mind are happy❗️. The scenery outside the window is also beautiful and charming, you can see the two rivers and four lakes, and the whole is very immersive to take pictures 📷zei to make a film!

Not only that, the location of the hotel 🏨 is also unique, it is very close to the city center and the food street, this time it 🈵️ fulfilled all my fantasies about the hotel 🫧.

Taking advantage of the May Day holiday, I chose to go out on a staggered peak to travel
The first stop is of course "Guilin" which I most want to go to!

How can you travel without booking a hotel in advance🏨
I did a lot of homework and compared many companies.
Later, I chose [Lijiang Boyin Hotel]

It is no exaggeration to say that this is the best hotel I have ever booked for travel! None ❗
It's really good, once you open the window, you can see the super beautiful lake and mountains, and you can also see the sunset🌆,
👏🏻In the hotel, you can take a photo with the super beautiful Sun and Moon Twin Towers without leaving home📷
And the hotel is located in the city center and it is very convenient to go anywhere!
✔️You can walk to the Cultural Palace and Zhengyang Pedestrian Street
Also 🈶️Two Rivers and Four Lakes, Xiangshan, Jingjiang Palace Scenic Area...
The room is hygienic and clean, and the sound insulation effect is very good!
You can still live here 🆓Hanfu can be worn to take pictures 😘

The Sun and Moon Twin Towers are only separated from the hotel by Shanhu Lake. The effect of viewing the Twin Towers is ten thousand times better than climbing the tower. This is the best place to take a photo with the Sun and Moon Twin Towers.
Instantly like it when it is posted in the circle of friends~👀
Night lighting time of the twin towers 18:00—22:00
The size of the room facilities is fine, and the view of Shanhu Lake from the large floor-to-ceiling windows is like the largest painting in the room.
You only need to walk to go to Zhengyang Street to eat delicious food, and you can go to any scenic spot in the city within 2 kilometers.
There is also a check-in butler who can be consulted, very considerate.
Both location and service are too convenient~

The level of convenience allows us to walk to Elephant Trunk Hill, Dongxi Alley, Cruise Terminal, Two Rivers and Four Lakes Park, and Jingjiang Prince’s Mansion without driving directly. It takes only 20 minutes to walk. You can also walk and shop along the street. The room is because of the room type. It can only be on the third floor, and the view is blocked by trees outside, but the hotel restaurant and viewing platform have absolutely top-notch views. Sitting in the restaurant, you can see the radiant Sun and Moon Twin Towers and the lake below, and the dinner tastes amazing, and the price is reasonable Very suitable, I really recommend dining in the hotel, children love to eat five-flavored duck, and they helped make vacuum packaging and took away two! The hotel gave a half-hour travel photo as a gift. Although the little brother was a little late because the last guest, his attitude and skills are very good. As a comfort, he also sent two photos, which is also very attentive. The housekeeper gave a companion when he left Gifts and fruits for the children. Everyone feels very comfortable. The most important thing is that the bed and bathroom settings are higher than those of many super five-star hotels. Anyway, sleeping is much more comfortable than Banyan Tree, very close to the body!

The whole hotel feels modern and clean!
There is also an observation deck on the top floor
The night view here is really beautiful😆😆
Each room has a floor-to-ceiling window or an outdoor balcony
Really very comfortable!
-
The sun and moon twin towers can be seen from the deck chairs in the swimming pool on the fifth floor of the hotel! I feel like bathing here in summer, and I can shoot a group of blockbusters at will📷📷
-
There is also a bar here at night!
When the lights of the Sun and Moon Twin Towers light up at night, have a glass of wine and have a drink! Really full of ritual
-
Overall, I really love this hotel~

msg:The plane arrived a little late, and we walked from a dark alley to the hotel. If we wanted to have some fresh air at night, we could hear the singing from the nightclub next door. The next morning, I opened the curtains with great anticipation. What about the lake view? The hotel explained that I spent 700 yuan to book a basic room... I would like to advise friends who do not have special financial strength not to choose it. In fact, looking at the location of the hotel, it is only close to the lake, and the scale of the entire hotel cannot be compared with that of the hotel next door. The Great Falls Hotel is incomparable, and it is more expensive than the Great Falls. Besides, the hotel provides free fruits. Let’s take a look at the quality. I recommend the newly opened coffee nearby.

msg:Internet celebrity hotel...it's okay to take photos. The bedding comfort is okay, but the bathroom design is not humane enough. The sliding door design does not insulate sound and smell. The faucet is too short and your fingers will poke into the basin when you wash your hands. The breakfast is good, and the dinner is also suitable for taking pictures. The tableware looks good, but the taste of the dishes is not enough. I wanted to order a New Year's Eve dinner, but gave up after trying it. I have been traveling for too long, and I only found one photo. This is the room after cleaning... dust... The biggest failure of this trip is that I shouldn't go to an internet celebrity hotel... I should honestly go to an international chain, even if it's a four-star hotel.

When you go out, the scenic environment is very good. Looking at the sparkling lake surface of Shanhu Lake in the hotel room, The tree-lined trail is really enjoyable; the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas on the lake are one of the most famous scenic spots in Guilin; the room is spacious, clean, Chinese-style and Western-style comfort; the toilet and washroom are separate , both practical and clean; my favorite is the dressing room, which is very practical for people like me who have a lot of clothes and other things; what impressed me the most is the service, from the door to the check-in, every service staff With a smile, it is both professional and friendly. After checking in, there is a housekeeper group specially built for me. If you have any questions, you will answer any questions immediately. If you have any needs, you will immediately meet your needs. The service is very meticulous and thoughtful, making people feel like home. ; The best thing is that there are free bottles of mineral water at the entrance and exit of each floor, which is very practical; but the breakfast variety is more perfect. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in, and I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Guilin.

The room is large, comfortable, and attention to detail. The color of the whole hotel is not dazzling, revealing Zen and ingenuity. The staff are very conscientious. From the parking lot to the restaurant, from the cleaning to the lobby reception, everyone welcomes them with a smile. , Special thanks to Miss Tang for every enthusiastic service and answering questions.
      There are flaws: Yunyun Restaurant has a superb view. I hope the dishes can also be first-class. I ordered the beef rib baked snail for 158 yuan. The taste is average, a lot of snails and a little beef, and the fig and shilan soup is 88 yuan, which is not good enough. It was served in 3 minutes. I thought it was stewed soup. To exaggerate, the taste is no different from the water in the pot. It is completely quick soup. The dishes do not match the price.

When you enter the front desk of the hotel lobby, you are greeted warmly. The room is still so new, with double sink design, smart mirror, and bright bathroom! Not only the environment and facilities are good, but the bedding is also very comfortable! The main thing about staying in a hotel is to sleep well and eat well! There is one detail that I didn't pay attention to when I checked in before, that is, the boxes for paper and dental equipment are all made of leather. This is comparable to a five-star hotel. In fact, the modernization of the environment, decoration style and facilities is really not inferior to the domestic five-star. It is a very cost-effective hotel! When it comes to eating, the restaurant here can meet the needs of three meals a day. The restaurant and the executive lounge are located on the top floor. Regardless of the location, scenery and lighting are very good, the breakfast is rich in variety, Chinese and Western delicacies are available, and afternoon tea at sunset. , enjoy the beautiful sunset, get together with friends after dinner, have a drink at the Starry Sky Lounge, listen to music, and enjoy the beauty of the day without leaving home! Special thanks to Miss Spring from the restaurant for watching me bring my little children and taking special care of us!
The hotel is located in the scenic area of two rivers and four lakes, with Shan Lake and Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas just outside the door. The transportation is also very convenient!

msg:I came from Guangzhou, and I stopped by Ritz last time. I didn't have any great hopes, but it can be said that Bo Yin really surprised me.
I ordered a big bed and decided to upgrade to the lake view after I arrived at the store (everyone has come here, I can’t justify it without seeing the scenery), there is a small balcony and a small tea room, and the bathroom is Kohler’s like the Ritz, which is very clean. There are not many varieties for breakfast, but there are quite a few, and the rice noodles are delicious. There are restaurants and small bars on the 8th floor where you can eat while watching the night view.
Let me talk about the details that amaze me. 1. As long as you can lie down, there must be a charging port next to it, including the balcony and the toilet. 2. There are fruits every day, and new ones are delivered every day (the ones that have not been eaten the day before will be left intact, not adding the ones that have been eaten, but giving a new one as a whole). 3. Butler service, if you have anything, just send it to the butler via WeChat. All the food I pack can be heated and sent back to the room. 4. Tourism customization, because the masks do not want to follow the large group, we directly customized a small group for the two of us on the first floor, and the time is our own. 5. There are two washing machines and two dryers in the self-service laundry room. There will be no crowded queues. There will be self-service mineral water at the elevator entrance, which can be taken on demand.

The only downside: the sound insulation needs to be strengthened, it's fine for normal activities, but the people in the corridor are a little noisy when they speak louder.

Even on the third floor, the twin towers could not be seen because of the trees, so I added money to upgrade to the balcony with Yangyun lake view on the sixth floor. The bed room was amazing as soon as I entered the room. The room is very large, with a separate toilet with a washbasin, a separate cloakroom, a spacious balcony, and a separate tea room. The most important thing is that the twin towers can be seen directly from the balcony, and there is a night view with lights at night.
The room facilities are very new and very clean, the hygiene is very good, there is free mineral water, you can pick it up in the corridor if you don't have enough to drink, and there is free tea in the lobby. I am so kind.
The hotel's breakfast is in the cloud restaurant on the 8th floor, and you can dine directly with the beautiful view of the twin towers. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, there are all kinds of things that should be there, such as coffee milk juice, salad fruit, freshly cooked special rice noodles, bread, cake and yogurt, as well as various pastries, steamed buns, fried vegetables and porridge, and Guangxi camellia tea. The taste is very good.

On that day, because there were few people after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the front desk upgraded me to a big room, and I could see the lake and my car downstairs. The people of Guilin are very simple. The delivery boy, waiter, and strangers on the street are very kind. Coupled with the facilities of this hotel, I am very happy. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but not many top brands are used for hardware (very few TVs use SONY). There are many photos of the environment, I took some details and shared them with you. The only requirement is that the equipment that is not worthy of your hotel is your Wi-Fi. Only the cloakroom has a good signal in the room. If it is farther away, it will be very troublesome. I hope this small equipment will be worthy of other software and hardware in your hotel facility.

msg:The hotel is on the side of the Twin Towers. When we checked in, maybe it was off-season and we were upgraded to a family room for free. The space is very large, and I felt a little tired from the room to the bathroom (Versailles). Fruits and minibars are free. The front desk The ladies and sisters are also very warm and caring, and there are butler services, and the stay is very comfortable. It's a pity that we arrived too late on the first day, and went out to play the next day, so we didn't enjoy it at the hotel.
The breakfast is on the 8th floor. You can see the twin towers and lakes directly from the outside. The breakfast type is also ok. There are basic styles. It is said that the coffee machine is broken if the coffee is not freshly ground, but it has little effect.
In addition, the package ordered this time also includes a massage service. The next day, I booked a foot massage in the evening, which relieved the fatigue of the day. But he came into the room with two buckets, which was a little funny. It should also be a promotion in the off-season. The two technicians should also be invited by the massage shop outside. It's okay to press, after all, it's free, and the requirements can't be too high.
In terms of travel, it is not very clear because there is a chartered car, but the driver said that it is the city center. There is also a normalized nucleic acid point on the pedestrian street next to it, which is very convenient. It is 5 yuan for a mixed inspection and 16 yuan for a single inspection.

Although the front desk is not big, but when you enter it, you will find that the best space is reserved for the guests to enjoy. First of all, the room is huge! Then it is not the big and unreasonable kind, but the ingenuity of the designer can be seen everywhere! From the roof, floor-to-ceiling windows, especially the breakfast on the top floor, the invincible view of the twin towers, the breakfast is rich in variety, it is recommended that you can eat two bowls of Guilin rice noodles every day, you can see how delicious it is! Welcome fruit and free mini bar
Hygiene: Full score bathroom is separated, and it is not embarrassing to have a separate bathroom outside the bathroom.
Environment: There are many parking spaces in front, and free entry and exit
Service: Service at home, worthy of appreciation
Transportation: It takes 8 minutes to walk to the 5A Xiangshan Scenic Spot. Before leaving, I also go to the lake for a walk. Highly recommended!

msg:The city center is close to whichever side, standing on the balcony and the upstairs terrace, the two rivers and four lakes are half of the scenic spots. In the evening, you can see the Lijiang River at the entrance of the twin towers. Go out and walk a few steps to a small pedestrian street to eat snacks, eat, and buy small things. It's very convenient. The service of the hotel is particularly in place. Every waiter is very enthusiastic and tired. The massage on call is very good, except for the hot weather.

msg:I change a hotel a day. This hotel is the most satisfying for my personal trip. The transportation is convenient, it is convenient to go anywhere, and it is close to the pedestrian street. Go downstairs to find food at any time.
Friends who love to take pictures will definitely benefit from staying here, and the barista on the top floor who loves coffee will never let you down. I just regret that I didn't bring a swimsuit, the pool on the 5th floor can only be watched but not played 😂
The service is also praised, the little brothers and sisters are so gentle 👍
The roof of the building is ready to shoot a large film, which is called the holy place of sunset, and it is not tired. You can sit on the bar chair and change direction to shoot casually. The sunset is really beautiful~~
I have already recommended it to my friends~

After I went out, the hotel called and said that the waiter had confused the room I booked with the room of a guest with the same name, surname and gender. This kind of apology also directly upgraded to a suite. When I entered the suite, I found that the scenery outside the window was invincible, and the room was so big that there were even two bathrooms.

msg:We have been traveling for more than 20 days. From Yunnan to Guilin, I am still very strict in choosing a hotel, and some hotels are inevitably disappointed. Boyin is a hotel that surprised me very, very much! ! ! It is really highly recommended for family outings. There are three reasons: 1. The location is excellent, close to the twin towers, very close to the wharf, very close to the East and West Alley, the pedestrian street, and the Reed Flute Cave. Very important; 2. The parent-child room is a real "parent-child", which is very friendly to parents. Two 1.5-meter double beds can be spliced into a three-meter double bed, and the other 1.5-meter double bed can sleep for the child, that is to say , The two-child family can get a very large space, and the sleep quality is really good. Unlike some hotel parent-child rooms, which just change the cartoon bedding, does the color of the bed cover matter? If you really bring children, you will know how important a comfortable bed is! In addition, when I saw that there was a bottle warmer and a bottle tableware sterilizer in the room, I was also shocked. This kind of parent-child room is probably the first in China! 3. The room is very comfortable to live in. I have stayed in many luxury hotels, and some hotels have very strange designs. Poyin is a hotel with good customer experience. Mineral water will be placed in the mouth. Whether you are going out or returning home, if you need water, you can take it yourself. If there is enough water in the room, you don’t need to take it again. There are also fresh fruit bowls presented every day. In addition, there is a water bar in the lobby. It happened to be very hot when we checked in. There are brown sugar ice powder, Luo Han Guo tea, and sweet-scented osmanthus cake to enjoy. There are also some seats in the lobby for rest, which is very comfortable. To sum up, Boyin's parent-child room is the most comfortable one I have ever lived in.

In addition, the top-floor restaurant has beautiful scenery and rich breakfast, which is comparable to a star-rated hotel. In general, from the design and decoration to the convenience of the service, it can make people feel professional, and it is a highly recommended room for tourists.

The country style is beautiful, and the room was upgraded for a fee. The room is very good. The lady at the front desk is also very good. After checking in, she also helped to bring the luggage into the room. Invite friends to talk things over. There is also a small children's playground downstairs, which is very suitable for young children! The only thing is that the swimming pool and gym are smaller, but others are ok. 👍Recommend to friends who come to Guilin. If you live in the urban area, don't miss it ❤️

There is no parking lot, and it is not easy to find.
There is no location at the entrance of the hotel, and the width is less than 5 meters
Booked a large room of more than 1170, which is empty, and there are no facilities
It is arranged on the third floor, and the staff arranged it in a higher room of the same type. There are trees when you open it, and you can't see anything
The room is hot and humid
No breakfast, only one of AB light meals, delivered to the room. A is Western-style bread and milk b is Guilin rice noodles
Too much difference from expectations, bad review

The large mirrors and wall tiles in the bathroom are popular at the moment. The time is too fast, there is no way to experience the facilities in the hotel too much, and there is no time to experience the service of private travel photography. I will leave some regrets and come back next time. go. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to go to the scenic spot to do nucleic acid shopping and eat.
As an aside, I highly recommend Liu Ji Yangshuo Beer Fish on Binjiang Road. This restaurant started in 1992, because of its clean, affordable, delicious service, thoughtful service, and various satisfactions.
Just a reminder, some restaurants have two menus, one for locals and one for foreign tourists. The prices are completely different, so be careful. Don't believe that there is no "xxx on the tip of the tongue" on the door of the store, the taste and price are right, it is right.

The room is very large, the terrace and the tea room are also needed. Sitting outside in the afternoon, you can see the Sun and Moon Tower and the Two Rivers and Four Lakes.

msg:The experience of staying in the Lijiang River for one night is the feeling of [dream], yes, it is such an unreal word. When I was lying on the sofa on the balcony, facing the wind blowing from the Sun and Moon Twin Pagodas and Shanhu Lake, I remembered what Chen Yi said: I would like to be a Guilin native, not a fairy. At this moment I feel like a fairy.
Lijiang Poyin should be the facade of the Poyin Hotel Group. It opened on May 1, 2018. The facilities in the room are very well maintained. Only when you use the non-smart toilet in the bathroom, do you realize that this is a hotel that has been in business for four years. Tables, chairs, carpets, bedding are all new, and there is a JBL Horizon at the head of the bed, and the sound quality is excellent. Kohler sanitary ware and APPELLES accessories are all standard in the Boyin room. The mattress should be made of latex, soft and supportive, and the hot water in the bathroom should not be too hot. The sincerity is reflected in these details. It should have cost a lot of money when it was built.
Even in the best location between the central square and Rongshan Lake, the room size is still very large, and it will not feel compact at all. Looking out from the balcony is full of greenery, and there is also a tea room in the room. Here, drinking tea and listening to the rain, I really feel that I am living a fairy-like life. Don't miss the Galaxy Lounge and Yunyun Restaurant on the roof. The scenery is good and the decoration is very tasteful. Friends also praised the cakes produced by its afternoon tea with good ingredients, which are better than many Internet celebrity cake shops.
Even if the hotel is in the best location between the central square and Rongshan Lake, the room size is still large, and it will not feel compact at all. The service of the hotel really makes me feel that I have done my best to the second time. When I checked in, the clerk warmly led me to the elevator entrance. During the period, there was welcome fruit, the bath was equipped with a bathtub cover, and there were disinfectant wipes beside the toilet. Nongfu Spring is available in the customer service aisle for self-pickup. The platform on the fifth floor is also equipped with a swimming pool, a gym and a sauna. With the view of the twin towers, it is really invincible, and it has fully achieved the hardware level that a five-star should have. Special thanks to Damei and Axin for their service~ Thank you Lijiang Boyin for giving me such an unforgettable stay experience!

Stepping out of the balcony, you can see the scenery of the Sun and Moon Twin Towers, which is really pleasing to the eye~ It is poetic with the drizzle~
The accommodation experience is great, the overall style is more Chinese, the shower room and toilet are separated, giving a good sense of privacy, which I like very much. If it is a long trip, the room is also equipped with a cloakroom, which is full of details~
It is said that the quilt is made of goose feather, which is light but very soft~effectively enhances the sense of sleep~
The breakfast provided by the hotel is also very rich. Western-style and Chinese-style can be freely chosen, with a variety of varieties, nutrition and health~
There is a lounge on the top floor of the hotel where you can have a drink. The decoration is beautiful. Friends who like to take pictures can go to check in, and the top floor can watch the scenery even more~
Overall, Poyin is a hotel that is very suitable for business trips, short trips, and parent-child trips. Friends who like it can experience it~
The hotel is also equipped with a butler. After checking in, many needs can be answered and solved in a timely manner. I am very grateful to the housekeepers, Damei and Axin. I will choose Poyin again next time~

Occupying the best location, the entrance is the Shanhu Sun and Moon Twin Pagoda Scenic Spot with two rivers and four lakes. A few hundred meters away is the Guilin Elephant Trunk Hill and Ronghu Scenic Spot. The most convenient place to eat, drink and play is the center of Guilin. The scenery at night is also beautiful. The lights and shadows of the two rivers and four lakes are like living in a colorful green forest garden.
The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western. During the epidemic, the arrangement was very thoughtful, and it was delivered to the room. It was not enough to order, and the experience was very good. Thanks to the housekeeper Guoguo, Meimei, the service is very good.
The cloud restaurant on the seventh floor is a Guilin specialty dish, which is absolutely trustworthy. You can enjoy the panoramic view from the big platform. In the evening, you can have a drink in the Galaxy Lounge, which is full of happiness.
The hotel room is light Chinese style, fresh and elegant, with a large layout, neat and clean, and the supporting facilities are also very good. The Kohler bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the coffee machine configuration is very convenient. The view is unbeatable. It is the spring and summer rainy season in Guilin. Lying on the big sofa on the balcony in the early morning listening to the sound of rain, the fragrance of fresh green grass wafts into the nostrils, it feels so beautiful.

msg:Due to the epidemic and the nature of my wife's work place, I can't travel far, but the children at home are clamoring to go out to play every day. ~ Just had the opportunity to stay at the Lijiang Boyin Hotel in Guilin, the overall feeling is still very good, it is worth recommending.
    First of all, in terms of geographical location, the hotel is located in Yangqiaotou, Zhongshan South Road, Guilin City, a proper downtown area of the old city of Guilin City, and is located on the edge of the urban area with two rivers and four lakes. The transportation is very convenient and the surrounding scenery is pleasant. At the same time, there are also the Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street in Guilin City, the Central Square, the new landmarks of Dongxi Lane and Xiaoyao Building in the urban area of Guilin City (these are all in the center for the Spring Festival Gala). It is very good to walk around in the evening.
    The hotel room is neat, clean and well equipped. We stayed in a parent-child room. For the children in the house, we arranged a separate one-piece wooden bed. The bathroom adopts the method of separating the shower room and toilet into two areas. This is a great point, especially for those of us who bring children to play. Family, this is very important~! (Otherwise it would be embarrassing...) The balcony is equipped with a chaise longue sofa and a coffee table for drinking tea. At the same time, it is equipped with a toy, a small room and a tent that children can play with. The second child likes it very much. The tea bar is equipped with a coffee machine and capsules, which is very convenient. Just in time for me to work overtime at night, the coffee is just right!
    There is a children's playground on the first floor of the hotel. Due to the epidemic, there are no people in the bar, and the two children are very happy. There is a swimming pool and gym on the fifth floor, which is very good, but because the weather is not very suitable, I didn't go swimming. There is a cloud restaurant on the roof, which is very good. You can see a beautiful night view of the two rivers and four lakes.
    The breakfast is delivered to the room, if it is not enough, you can order more. The experience is very good, the service is warm and thoughtful, and it is worthwhile for tourists who want to stay in the city center~! Worth recommending~!
    Finally, I hope that the epidemic will end soon, and everyone will return to normal work and life~! You can travel anywhere~!

Bought me in a minute. The only thing is that during the epidemic, breakfast has to be delivered to the room, which is thankless. However, if you add a powder, it will be replenished very quickly, and the overall score of the breakfast taste is average. When I left the store, I even gave me the golden mangosteen that I wanted to buy as a souvenir.

The hotel is very new and very clean, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the beds are very comfortable, and a self-service laundry and drying room is also provided, which is very user-friendly. Ms. Zhuge, who handled the housing at the front desk, was kind and responsible. After completing the room card, she took us into the room and introduced the details of the room. She was very thoughtful and heart-warming, and deserved praise! The hotel has set up a WeChat housekeeper. If you encounter any problems, you can solve it in time through the WeChat grade housekeeper, which is really a good management method. Every waiter in the room is very careful and clean, which is reassuring. Because during the epidemic, breakfast is delivered to the room, one is Chinese and one is Western, and you can choose by yourself. After check-out, the hotel also sent a souvenir. In short, next time I go to Guilin, I will choose Lijiang and Poyin Hotel. After dinner, walk by the Shanhu Lake in front of the hotel, the air is fresh and the scenery is beautiful!

msg:I came here for online recommendations and high ratings, but I really didn't make a mistake at all. Poyin is amazing, everything from check in to check out can be described as beyond imagination. On Dad's birthday, the little fairy world at the front desk upgraded us to a room with a view of raising clouds. Also delivered breakfast for the third person. The amount of breakfast delivered to the room every day is too large, and the fruit is also very sweet. In addition, the facilities of the room itself are very modern, and Shangri-La and Sheraton were also considered, but the convenience and modernization of the room are definitely on the top. The induction light and multi-interface charging cable are well received. The only thing that can be improved is whether to prepare a bathtub cover for easy bathing. In addition, every clerk was very enthusiastic and even gave us a set of postcards before leaving. In addition, the address is super convenient. Next to it is Zhengyang Road Pedestrian Street. Crossing the pedestrian street tunnel is Jingjiang Wangfu and Dongxixiang. Walking downstairs along the footpath under the bridge, you can see the Cedar Lake and the Twin Towers. You can walk to Xiangshan, suo Laojiangdong rice noodles, buy Jinshunchang souvenirs, and eat Chunji roast goose. In the end, we had lunch at the restaurant on the roof. The food and beauty are both suitable. In addition, because nucleic acid may need to be done during the epidemic, there is a people's hospital around Poyin. Pay attention to the public account to apply for a health card and choose a nucleic acid test, as long as the Guangxi health code is green You can enter the inside for inspection, 10 yuan for mixed inspection, and the results will be released on the same day, which is very convenient~ I hope that I will have the benefit of upgrading the room next time I check in, hehe

msg:When I first arrived, it was difficult to drive in, and I was a little worried about whether I lived too far. Later, I found that the location was excellent. I could run downstairs at night and walk around the two rivers and four lakes, which was very comfortable.
The room is on the second floor, with no lake view and twin towers, but the view from the window is also great. The overall living experience is very good, the air conditioning is very hot, and it will not be wet and cold at all when it rains. The spare parts are L'Occitane, welcome fruit every day, and the desserts are also delicious, and the quality of the breakfast is also very high. Because of the epidemic, I can't go to the cloud restaurant to eat. The breakfast is delivered to the room. The rice noodles in the Chinese meal are very good. The taste can be ranked in the top of the Guilin rice noodles eaten in the past few days. The breakfast volume is also very large. It is a meal for two people. It is a pity that there are few gym facilities. , the swimming pool is small and not open, but the shortcomings are not hidden, and the night running by the two rivers and four lakes can completely make up for it.
The service of the little housekeeper is good. He will consult the types of meals every day, and can also provide information such as nucleic acid locations and one-day tour routes, which is very meticulous and thoughtful.
There is a travel photo in the package, including three photos. It is on the 8th floor. The photographer's skills are good, and the photos are quite impressive. It is a pity that it was raining that day, so there was no way to take pictures in the distance, but The selected photos are also quite satisfactory, recommended.

Although there are a lot of homestays, they look beautiful, but the hygiene and hardware are uneven. Boyin Hotel, abandoned and independent, it can be seen that the founder and team are gathering the strengths of hundreds of families, starting from bedding/sanitation/service, very warm and just right to meet the living requirements of Chinese people in the new era. Although the price is high, it is worth every penny.

🧹Hygienic: very clean, can be described as spotless. It is very comfortable.

🍃Environment: The environment of the hotel is the biggest highlight. It can be seen that it was carefully designed and decorated. Step by step is the scene, the lighting is soft. It is pleasing to the eye. The restaurant on the 8th floor has an observation deck, and you can see the lake, ancient pagodas and the green mountains of Guilin.

🔔Service: The service of this hotel is really great. It is one of the best hotels in the country that I have been to. From the front desk to the restaurant, they are smiling and courteous, and they take the initiative to help guests solve problems.

I will definitely stay in this hotel next time I come to Guilin.

He communicated many times in advance and arranged the room closest to the elevator. The hotel also provided wheelchairs to facilitate the elderly to travel. The hotel booked by Ctrip provides free pick-up service. There are free fruits, oranges, apples, dates, pears, bananas, and sweet supper desserts every day. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and of high quality. The toilet design is also very reasonable. It's nice to have tea and sunbathe on the inner balcony. Taking pictures on the roof, the effect is not good, especially at night is the best location to take pictures of the gold and silver pagodas. The breakfast was very good, especially the longan and red date paste, walnut black sesame paste and soy milk served by the hotel. Will stay in Guilin next time.

msg:Just leave Guilin and Yangshuo. The first stop in Guilin to do your homework, I chose the must-stay Lijiang River Retreat. In fact, before I came, I would have a little worry in my heart. I was afraid that the hotel would be unsatisfactory? Arrived with some doubts, the door of the hotel was very low-key. As soon as I entered the door, I was moved by the gentle and delicate sincere smile of the lady at the front desk. She also upgraded the room for us for free [强][强]The room is on the first floor, but very Quiet, the decoration design of the whole room is very simple and comfortable but with its own unique charm, which complements the beauty of the two rivers and four lakes. The bathroom is a separate small room and comes with a sink. The bed is really big, and two people can sleep properly in a big font. The pillows will not be too high or thrown away. It is better than many other five-star hotels. , We passed along the road and arrived at a viewing platform of the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. Many tourist groups took photos here, but I found that this viewing position was not as open and beautiful as the view from the path at the front entrance of the hotel! There are restaurants and bars on the 8th floor of the hotel, and there are terraces. You can see the beautiful scenery of Guilin's two rivers and four lakes. Elephant Trunk Hill can also be seen from a distance. I came here for breakfast one night. The taste is also good. With the fresh beauty of Guilin's early morning after the rain, it opened up a good mood for the day. Lijiang Poyin is really full of surprises and likes everywhere. Family members and friends who are traveling with us are full of praise, and they definitely live up to the first place in Guilin.

The view on the left is the Sun and Moon Twin Towers, and the mountains on the right are full of eyes. Not far downstairs is Xiangshan Park. With the boarding pier, the Guilin porridge shop next to it is open until 3 pm, and you can have a supper at the end of the cruise.
In addition, the hotel service is great, the staff are very patient to answer any questions, the breakfast is also very good, the staff will nod and greet them very politely, the fragrance of the hotel is quite comfortable, the toiletries are all from L’Occitane, and the laundry room has drying Machines, washing machines, disinfectant, laundry detergent, clothes drying racks can still be raised and lowered, especially meticulous and boutique hotels.
The only regret is that the room drawn by the blind box is a bit small, not a view room 😭😭😭, the other parts are perfect. If you want to stay in Guilin for one night, this hotel is really nothing to say, it is highly recommended

msg:Very good hotel. The originally scheduled lakeside double bed room was directly upgraded to the Yangyun Twin Tower double bed room for free, which is so beautiful. The room directly looks at the Sun and Moon Twin Towers through the large French windows. Drinking tea during the day and watching the scenery at night. The details of the hotel are very well done. The bathrobe is the most comfortable of all the five to seven-star hotels in the world I have stayed in. Although L’Occitane's toiletries are more common, they feel that the quality is better than other hotels. In addition, the sweet soup of ginseng and red dates in the evening tasted like Chaoshan sweet soup when I was a child. I am very satisfied overall and I have recommended it to a friend who specializes in signing a contract with a high-end hotel. Will continue to live next time.
🍃Environment: Elegant and high-end.

The front desk Xiaochuan has good service, enthusiasm and professionalism, and even the surrounding scenic spots and restaurants can help us one by one. The bed in the room we stayed in was oversized. This is too important! ! ! You can book ferry tickets at the hotel, and it is convenient to eat, play, walk, and call a taxi nearby. It is only about 10 minutes' drive from Guilin High-speed Railway Station. There are children’s toiletries, and the adult’s wash series will not feel a drop in price. There is a complimentary washing powder, which means that no matter whether it is used or not, the small details are in place. It may be that the staff I met are better, so this time I am very satisfied overall. For meals, breakfast would be richer and better. After two days of staying, the cuisine seemed to be similar, but it was enough. I was in a good mood for a day of dining while watching the lake view on the balcony. The swimming pool is a large bathtub, and no one goes to the sun in the evening, and the children are also very happy. I will definitely recommend my friends to come, I hope I will always have this level in the future~

msg:The Boyin Hotel is not big, with only one elevator and 60 rooms, but the service is good, the decoration is new, the sanitation is clean, and it is very close to Elephant Trunk Hill and Jingjiang Palace. Guoguo at the front desk, Spring in the restaurant, and an unknown brother, were very warm and sincere. The child took 2 extra slices of bread for breakfast, and accidentally ate 2 portions of rice noodles, and the bread was not finished. Spring sister took the packing box and said that she could take it away. She also asked if she needed some fruit. The fruit was rejected by me. Take the children on Ruyi Peak to eat. This is very humane. I went to Hilton last year. There was really nothing to eat in the surrounding mountains. The staff was very rigid. I took a donut for breakfast and would rather throw it away instead of bringing it. In fact, no one deliberately took it these days. I want to take those slices of bread, which can be worth a lot of money. Tourists come to play especially with children. In the mountainous area, they are likely to encounter children suddenly hungry. How about giving two slices of bread generously? Therefore, Poyin's management philosophy is commendable. The restaurant on the eighth floor tastes good for dinner, and the price-performance ratio is high in five-star hotels, but the variety is small. There is also cake and juice for one meal, thank you! The rice noodles for breakfast are delicious. The sweet porridge delivered in the evening is still packed in a thermos pot, which is really very careful! The hotel swimming pool is not a real swimming pool, it is a large jacuzzi, but a small hotel can also design a swimming pool with care. The fruits delivered are also generous in five-star hotels. The big business is really not a matter of calculating with customers a little bit by bit. Also, the most rare thing is that the hotel has a washing machine and a dryer, and washing powder is ready. This is rare in domestic five-star hotels. In fact, it is very necessary for tourists, especially in the rainy and sweaty summer. In short, next time you come to Guilin or recommended by your relatives and friends, you will still be the first choice! Hope that Poyin will continue to maintain service standards!

The room is very large, in addition to a big bed and a small Luohan bed, the staff took the initiative to make the bed and also thoughtfully brought small bath towels, slippers and bathrobes for the children. The Luohan bed is also very soft to sleep at night. There is a matching quilt without worrying about dragging it to the ground. It is enough for one person to sleep.

The room is very clean, the bath towels are also very soft and comfortable to use, the bath suit is still L’Occitane, and now even Marriott and Ritz don’t use L’Occitane.

During the day and night, you can go to the restaurant on the eighth floor to see the twin towers and the lake view. The view is very good. The morning breakfast offers a wide variety of food, including Chinese and Western styles. The environment is good, and the meal is pleasant to the body and mind!

The service attitude is also very good, softly speaking, when she left, the little girl also sent to the door and waited for us to get in the car before turning around. Really at home, I will definitely come next time.

The service is as good as always, especially the front desk clerk Guoguo, who is gentle and pleasant. He smiles and makes people feel like spring brows. The service attitude is very professional. He recognized me at a glance (the first time I checked out, it was Guoguo reception) , Could not help but immediately upgrade the room-the lake view room, from the balcony, you can see the Sun and Moon Twin Towers up close, and you can see the reflection very clearly. It was another staying experience that I didn't want to leave.

This time we took a night tour of the two rivers and four lakes. For those who have seen the night view of the Pearl River and the Bund, there is indeed a bit of a gap, but the scenery is not bad, but the price is a bit expensive.

There is a small swimming pool on the roof where children can also swim and play. When I get up in the morning, I open the curtains and you will see two rivers and four lakes. The restaurant for breakfast is on the top floor. The scenery is very good. The butler's reply messages are basically within seconds, and the service is definitely super five-star. Will choose here next time I come to Guilin!

msg:The hotel is right by the lake, and the scenic area is just outside the door. It is very convenient to walk to the dock and take a cruise on two rivers and four lakes. Because with the baby, the hotel also specially helped to upgrade the room, the room is very large, it is very pleasant to work on the balcony while enjoying the night view. The facilities in the room are free, the toiletries are from L’Occitane, and the hotel’s lady sisters are also very considerate. They delivered baby products, welcome fruit, and capsule coffee. When I came back in the evening, I was surprised to find that there was still white fungus and red date porridge on the table. Very warm. At night, go to the balcony on the 8th floor to enjoy the night view while eating the BBQ prepared by the hotel. The breeze is blowing slowly, not hot or cold, very pleasant. A great experience, highly recommended~

When I arrived at the hotel, I knew that we had upgraded the parent-child room directly with the child. The room was very big and clean, all the facilities were very new. The attitude of the hotel staff is good, and the sweet porridge is sent to the room at night, and there is free refreshment in the lobby. The hotel is in a very good location. The parent-child room is facing the sun and moon twin towers. The night view is good. The hotel is very close to all the scenic spots in the city center. It is basically walking distance. Really very good hotel and will stay here next time you have a chance to come to Guilin.

And the next day, it happened to coincide with my mother’s birthday. The housekeeper added WeChat in advance and helped to prepare a birthday cake~! Hahaha I got a room upgrade for free when I arrived at the front desk of the hotel that day, I was really touched!

The waiter will give us fruit for a while, and the lotus soup for a while, which are all delicious. Especially the amount of barbecue delivered in the evening was too large, and all four of them were full. The most satisfying thing is the travel photo we sent. The master is very professional, and we just happened to be planning to take a birthday photo for the child. This time saves it. What I think is a bit flawed is that the breakfast variety is a little bit less. Got to say it's great.

The exquisite design style, beautiful location and complete facilities of many hotels impressed me immediately. Make a contract. As soon as I confirmed the room, I received a call from the exclusive housekeeper, Wang, and through WeChat communication, all the needs of the hotel and the itinerary consultation and arrangement were handled carefully and carefully!
The hotel’s restaurant is exquisite and delicious, and the balcony view is even more superb. You can clearly see the Sun and Moon Towers. With the sunset glow, the mood of this meal is even more enjoyable!
This time itinerary of Guilin section directly booked the hotel’s one-day tour to Changfa Village of Huangluo Yaozhai, Ping'an Zhuangzhai, Longji Terraces and one-day chartered car for Shili Gallery in Xingping Ancient Town, Guanyan Scenic Area of Gudong Waterfall. The courteous tour guide and driver service, the whole itinerary does not worry about getting up early, everything is properly arranged, and it is very popular with the mother and the little girl!
Thanks again to Brother Wang and Brother Xiaolong for their sincerity and dedication!

There is a Starbucks next to it within walking distance, the location is invincible, it is also very close to Elephant Trunk Hill, there is free parking, and it is self-driving friendly.
So the three of us upgraded to a two-room room type, room number 666.
There is a tea room and a small terrace, so you can stay in the room very comfortable if you don't go out.

There are many choices for breakfast, but when we went there were a lot of people and the waiter was too busy, and waited for five minutes to clear the table.

The geographical location is unique, regardless of its appearance, but the real name is the big hidden in the city, the interior is unique, and the exterior is completely visual. The service is very good. I ran into square music that disturbed the people at night on the first night. I informed the hotel at the first time and solved the problem quickly. There is a welcome porridge on arrival the night of the first day.

The internal room type is my heart, especially the hallway. All kinds of hardware facilities are of high level. The bathroom is Kohler, the air conditioner is Daikin, and the decoration details are also paid special attention (just look at the photo under my basin). You must know how many hotels are out of sight. They are all sloppy. Otherwise, the finish is completely finished like the exposed place, enough to show the deep intentions. The breakfast is not too much, but the taste and ingredients are very good. The name here is "sirloin, soy milk, peanut butter".

The swimming pool is on the fifth floor, which is actually a big bathtub, but it is better than nothing in a hotel of this size in the city.

The only shortcoming is Wi-Fi, the bandwidth is insufficient, sometimes it will be out of power, including the connection method can also be more formal, I hope it can be improved.

湖景房內就能看到桂林必打卡：象鼻山、日月雙塔，遠處的羣山環繞、細雨綿綿、江上霧氣瀰漫、別有一番韻味！

小水吧有自動咖啡機
還有飲料小吃零食下午自己充一杯咖啡享受一下
湖景房可以泡澡看着窗外風景吃着酒店送的新鮮水果、滿足感十足。
早餐也吃到了地地道道的桂林米粉💖

msg:這種兩居室的家庭觀影房特別坑人。一間是黑屋子，另外一間有一個小窗户，是面對酒店的走道。房間完全沒有辦法通風。我真的不知道這麼高級的精品酒店怎麼會出現這種房型？我習慣訂前對酒店進行諮詢，酒店沒有提及這點。價格也高。
另外酒店在客人入住時候的服務也值得改進。
我們離店的時候送了我們一個特色的壯族的葯錘。

酒店內的設施很多，更令我驚喜的是有洗衣服務，雖然有收費，但起碼是有這服務我個人覺得很贊，而酒店亦有設置游泳及健身房間，由於時間不充足，我是沒有用得到它們的服務，還有叫外賣可以用得到酒店的機械人幫忙送，對我這個較懶的人非常之值得給五個贊

卫生：
很乾淨衛生，床褥以及衛生間都很乾淨，房間沒有異味，我個人有點潔癖都覺得很滿意，沒什麼可以挑剔￼

环境：
一進入酒店就覺得很堂皇豪華的感覺，無論是大堂的燈光還是房間的燈光都覺得很舒服時尚，酒店位處桂林景區步行只需5分鐘，很方便很近，同時行完景區我也可以到正陽步行街及東西巷走走吃吃，酒店對著漓江，走出去可以沿着江邊走看夜景，由於在餐廳位置在頂樓，高空對著日月雙塔影過去，超級靚靚靚

服务：
酒店的前台服務人員非常有禮貌及態度，因為我普通話比較爛😆另外可以+他們的微信服務人員，直接用手機微信聯繫需要，我也第一次遇到用這種方式找客服人員，好新穎！退房還有前台服務員送精油跟詢問住的感受，好真誠的服務態度，值得給個贊啦！

總結我媽媽也覺得好好，對比這幾天的居住感受，性價比高，衛生、方便度、以及高尚住宅感受全有，若下次再去桂林會再住這家酒店😊

msg:先説優點：
酒店的位置絕佳，就在雙塔邊上，餐廳在露台座位可以在美景中享受美食。步行可到象鼻山，離幾家有名的米粉店也不遠。
設施比較周全，房間贈送的水果品質和種類都挺好，迷你吧中的飲料也都可以免費飲用。在五樓還有健身房和一個小露台，露台上有室外泳池，應該是天氣冷了沒有開。 
服務比較熱情。離開的時候，小姐姐還幫我把箱子拎上了車。
再説缺點：
酒店前面的路上有石墩擋着車輛，要從一條小巷子裏繞到門口。熟悉的司機能夠順利找到，不熟悉的司機衹能把客人送到路口。
定的臨湖觀景大床房，寫明瞭親水觀湖，可是安排的房間在二樓，衹能看到一排棕櫚樹，壓根看不到湖。這樣的房間作為臨湖觀景房賣，很不地道。如果要觀湖衹有家庭房了。於是我衹能加了500塊，一個人住有大客廳和一大一小兩張床的12***的套房。
另外，早餐還可以，
早餐有米粉，麪包做的也不錯，常規的餐點都有。

msg:這個酒店是整個桂林行程中的最亮點，完美的酒店

1. 地理位置絕佳，日月雙塔、象山景區、玻璃橋、正陽路步行街、東西巷全在步行5-10分鐘的範圍內。我老公説：“躺酒店床上，就把桂林景點都看了。”

2. 超級舒適的超五星。不管是床品，還是沙發，或是喝茶的貴妃榻，都是非同一般的舒適。即使小物件（比如茶具、杯子、零食盒等）都那麼精緻。

3. 服務絕對到位，頂層的餐廳用餐體驗也不錯。

總之，在桂林住這個酒店性價比超高。

msg:這個酒店吧不太好評價，老實説到店的第一時間我先生是要求換酒店的，可能近一兩年定酒店都沒有踩過雷，所以萬分後悔沒有直接定糖舍或者悦榕莊。首先從位置來看，確實在湖邊、風景不錯，距離象山很近，但是這裏離陽朔、龍脊等等還是很遠的，相對而言並不是最方便；其次就是裝修和設施，酒店的游泳池和健身房真的是太小了，因為人多本來想窩在酒店游泳，誰知道看了一下那可能就是個比較大的浴缸，健身房還不如一個房間大實在轉不開身，除了沿湖跑圈不出門實在沒地方去；最後是早飯，可選擇的範圍真的很少，我基本每天都是米粉加上一點水果。以上三點讓我覺得花了兩千多一晚住這個酒店挺虧的，要知道我五月份就定了，那時候很多好的酒店並不貴。為什麼很難評價呢，主要是他的服務確實很不錯，礦泉水管夠，每天送水果，女兒要打印作業我找了好幾家打印店都關門結果管家二話不説全給我免費打印了，最重要的是有洗衣機和烘乾機，這是我第一次長假在外把所有的衣服全部洗乾淨了回家。

地理位置方面：就很優越，離哪兒都方便。兩江四湖中間的位置，樓下就是景點。晚上跟早上跑跑步溜達溜達最愜意不過。周邊點外賣也都是好吃的店鋪。

衞生方面：定了兩晚，因為行程變更，所以父母先入住的，沒看出來有什麼大問題。

餐：早餐在樓頂，有帶露台的座位，餐食還可以。有現做的米粉之類。

服務：前台服務很好，前期預訂酒店諮詢接電話和加了微信溝通的小姐姐小哥哥都很nice，門口的行李員也很熱情友好，但是早餐餐廳的阿姨態度一般，希望以後改正。

總的來説，非常推薦。

送的水果里人參果和青栆都很好吃。出門沿着湖邊走幾步就是象鼻山，正陽步行街，走到頭就是東西街。

1.服務完美，雖然有改進的空間，但是對我們來説已經是完美，因為酒店用改進的態度來彌補細小的瑕疵，這不影響我們對這次入住酒店的完美體驗；而且酒店用貼心的服務讓住客更加舒服。比如幫忙接收快遞並送入房間，幫忙郵寄快遞。。。
2.設施和位置更不用説，加分的項目是酒店有洗衣機和烘乾機，省去每次旅遊時旅行包塞滿有味道衣服的煩惱，樓下親子遊樂場讓我女兒完全沉浸其中，一樓的薑茶和其他飲品讓我們全家都開心不已，還有迷你圖書館，我84歲的老爸和82歲的岳父對此讚口不絕。。。酒店本身就是景點
3.8樓的食物價格自己點餐稍微偏貴，但就餐環境一流，每天早餐在無敵景觀的頂樓餐廳裏享用，對我們來説已經足夠
4.驚喜的是我們退房的時候酒店給我女兒送了一份精美禮物，為我們的完美旅程增添一份完美回憶。

msg:已經是第二次入住灕江泊隱酒店（兩江四湖店）了，店面清潔，房型大，房間設備齊全（有三床標間）、服務人員素質高、態度好。特別推薦位於7層的雲頂餐廳，可以一覽日月雙塔和羣山日落，菜品也很是講究。昨天我突發急病，發現這裏距離桂林市人民醫院（三甲醫院）打車衹需要五分鐘車程，醫生很專業，是我得到了及時的救治。特此推薦該酒店，下次來桂林還會選這家酒店入住。

整體比較乾淨整潔，就是樓層有點太低了，特地定的臨湖觀景房間，結果窗簾一拉，就能看到酒店門口路過的行人，相視太過尷尬了，景也看不到啥，全被樹給擋住了，還不如餐廳的觀景平台，衞生打掃也中規中矩，整體感覺性價比有點低

我覺得各方面都令人滿意，不能説無可挑剔，但是做的還是不錯的，説幾個我比較印象深刻的點:
1,停車條件比較一般，地面比較擁擠，衹有幾個車位，地下也很小，值得一提的是，我無論何時停車，某有各種服務人員幫我指引，這點還是做的很好的，並且主動幫忙提行李，非常熱情。
2,每個樓層都有可以隨時自取的礦泉水，這點特別好，看得出商家是捨得花錢的。
3,小朋友很愛吃他家零食，酒店也免費提供了很多次，對小朋友特別友善。
4,拿外賣很方便，機器人可以送到門口。
5,房間很大很舒服，小冰箱免費使用。
6,地點比較市區，去哪裡都方便。
7,走的時候還有伴手禮，很貼心。

提兩個缺點: 一個就是浴室的花灑管子有點漏水，用花灑的時候水飛的到處都是，第二個就是早餐弱了一點，雲端餐廳的晚餐也是差評。不知道餐飲是酒店自己的還是外包的，這個令人失望。

服務也還不錯，但是不值得這個價錢，端午節八百多訂了雙人房，窗戶打開對著是居民樓，門前也是小馬路⋯到的時候是晚上，一個人還是有點嚇人的。
下次來不會選擇這個了，過節的時候價格太虛高了，本地朋友說同等價位可以住更好的，不值得這個價錢。

       本次入住的是酒店的套間，面積很大，洗浴間和衞生間分離，有單獨的衣帽間，還有茶台和餐桌。因為帶着孩子，我們直接叫酒店送餐到房間，在炎熱的夏天，我們在房間邊享用晚餐，邊欣賞窗外的風景。夜晚，坐在窗邊邊喝茶邊看兩江西湖的夜景。
        酒店服務很到位，有貼心服務管家，每次出門前致電前台都提前幫叫好出租車等候。在此特別感謝我們的管家唐小姐，為我們推薦了地道的桂林米粉，以及入住期間給予的關心。

在計劃來桂林旅行之前
就被這家酒店種草了
第一晚就預訂了這裏
酒店位置就在日月雙塔景點旁
真的是從房間就能看到兩江四湖的景色
環境優美、設施全面、服務熱情、體驗感滿分哦💯
樓下就是灕江邊的公園、一下子就悠然自得起來了
我們的房間內還有茶台
邊欣賞風景邊喝茶真的禪意滿滿
-
房間內乾濕分離的衞生間女朋友很喜歡
獨立的衣帽間真的驚呆我了
這絕對是我這輩子住過最高級的酒店了
-
酒店內的觀景台也有很多
8F的餐廳外擺露台可以一覽兩江四湖美景
從5F的露天泳池往外看、有着不一樣的風景
隨手一拍就是大片！
從一樓出去就是兩江四湖走道
左邊是杉湖和日月雙塔以及知音台碼頭
右邊是榕湖、玻璃橋和湖心島以及古南門
走路就能到正陽步行街的美食街
地理位置十分優越！
-
早餐也是超棒哦
自助餐種類繁多、中西餐都有、還有桂林特色的米粉小吃
而且還可以坐在露台上邊賞江景邊吃早餐
也太愜意了吧！

酒店位於兩江四湖景區內，樓下50米就是遊船碼頭，走路去步行街東西巷吃東西非常方便，步行8分鐘到象鼻山公園。桂林市區沒有太多值得遊覽的景點，我此行四天三夜全部圍繞酒店遊玩。

非常感謝酒店的小夥伴們給我準備了生日蛋糕驚喜。酒店的自助早餐種類很齊全，從三天更換的菜品來看，多是廚師自己做的，而非半成品，蛋餃非常好吃！

房間設施：飲水管夠，mini bar全部可使用，每日送新鮮水果。所有電器衞浴產品都是大牌，看得出老闆運營的非常用心。

此行是我帶媽媽來玩，感謝酒店所有工作人員，尤其是小武和小唐的熱情款待。我一定會大力推薦給即將來旅遊的朋友！

環境：距離日月塔非常近，在頂層的雲端餐廳可以看到塔和江的全景。酒店大堂簡單大氣。每層設有自取礦泉水的地方，這個很方便，屋裡沒水了不用等人來送。
伴手禮:退房時給了伴手禮，雖然沒什麼特別的，但有這份心就足夠了。
早餐:在這個等級的酒店裡算是種類多的了。
酒店私訂旅拍:沒體驗，無法評價。

整體蠻不錯的，房價在桂林算是中高的。根據個人能力選擇，我個人是推薦這裏的。

酒店位置很好，距離桂林高鐵站也不遠，打車也就20分鐘左右，推薦大家嚐嚐桂林的椿記燒鵝，比陽朔做的更好吃。

在酒店的窗台那就能看到日月雙塔

msg:五星好評！酒店在桂林市中心，一是地理位置非常好。離桂林北站車程20分鐘左右，門口就是兩江四湖，日月雙塔出門就能看到。附近購物用餐都很方便。二是酒店服務非常貼心。管家提前聯繫加我微信，圖文並茂提醒到酒店的路線，酒店大堂每天都有免費自製的羅漢果茶、水果茶和水果，房間裏也每天有免費的水果、零食和飲料。詢問就餐出遊，都會提供很有誠意的建議。三是酒店的設施小而全。酒店五樓有免費提供的洗衣機和烘乾機，健身房和小遊泳池，小朋友每天都要去游泳，一樓還有一個小童樂園，都非常乾淨，讓人很放心。我住的是大床房因為沒有浴缸，第二天改成了湖景房，房間很大，乾濕分離，陽台還有一個大茶桌，我們就用作餐桌，每天晚上到餐廳把飯菜打包回來在陽台邊看夜景邊吃飯，非常不錯👍
順便推薦一下附近的椿記燒鵝，又便宜又好吃😋

來桂林必住綠水青山間的灕江泊隱酒店
店名台：灕江泊隱酒店（桂林兩江四湖象山景區店
地址：秀峯區杉湖北路5號1棟

首先酒店的環境可以説是特別棒
整個現代中式風 繁華間的一抹寧靜 
酒店在市中心的絕佳地理位置 非常便捷
這次我定的湖景房 有一個小陽台 從房間就可以直接看到兩江四湖日月雙塔
酒店設施齊全 房間寬敞乾淨 還有一個茶歇室 非常有意境
酒店頂樓是個觀景餐廳 拍照打卡特別棒 一線湖景 搭配美味下午茶
絕對不可錯過這個最佳觀景之地

msg:桂林的最後一晚，來了在點評上搜到的店，竟然是旅程中的意外之喜，真的非常非常滿意。
下樓就是湖邊，對面就是雙塔，樓頂的露台也可以看雙塔的夜景，往左走兩步就到了正陽步行街，有家江君烤翅巨好吃（同樣搜的點評評分哈哈）反方向可以去吃新郭記和椿記 走路基本上都是十來分鐘就到，這個位置讓我的美食之旅特別順哈哈，當然如果想去象鼻山景區和其他室內景區也很近，我來的時候，陽朔旅遊團就給我放到象鼻山附近，我溜溜達達走過來的。
然後説到住，住着和老式酒店不同，有種民宿的感覺，説實話是我來的三天最暖和的一天，東北人表示空調的最高温終於讓我可以室內穿背心了哈哈，室內環境也很好，還幸福的泡了澡，這晚的睡眠質量極高。
早飯樣式很多，我對一個紅豆汁特別有好感，讓我這個不怎麼吃早飯的人喝了一大杯。
第二天還約了拍照，試了兩套衣服，攝影師技術特別棒，我就按指示擺姿勢就行了，最終出片我特別滿意哈哈哈，話不多説都在圖裡哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈
可能十年內都不會再來，但是這份回憶我覺得值得我跟很多人分享😘
