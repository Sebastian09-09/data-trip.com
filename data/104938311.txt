msg:Not advise to stay at this hotel as vehicle is not allow to enter, and the staff is all not responding. Same breakfast everyday, and quality of food is also so so only. Worst is all staff black face all day and not polite as a 5 star rating hotel. 实在不见建议入住这家酒店，出入实在不方便。所有入口都被卡着了，打了车想要开进去还需要自己挪开障碍物，门童几乎不帮忙，大厅在5楼，一点都不方便。早餐餐厅里的员工没有一点朝气，各个脾气态度都不太好。食物品质和选择也是一般般。点了碗馄饨面汤，结果馄饨几乎黏成一块，也没熟透，拿给工作人员就说已经熟了的。员工对话都是大小声。主要房间烟味很重，空调又不太灵光。不会再选择这家酒店，还不如一间三星酒店。失望…

msg:We stayed here for 3d2n. The hotel is located conveniently next to a big new mall with many food options. There are also shops and restaurants around the area which could be easily accessible by foot. I love the 杀猪面. 

The Huangbian subway station is also right at the mall, which could take you directly to Yuexiu Park if you're into some sightseeing. 

Amenities and cleanliness is top-notch at Junluxe. We also appreciate the friendly and helpful staff who helped us secure airport transfers to Baiyun Airport. It would've been a challenge doing this myself as the road in front of the hotel is closed due to construction that is completing next to it; and we had large number of luggages, plus travelling as a group of 5. It took 2 concierge staff to kindly move our luggages and directed the multiple taxis to the underground parking. We were very grateful and gladly tipped the young men. 

I will gladly return. Thanks Junluxe.

Even telling it the staff it was the same on the next day. The room was clean and new. We got 2 bottles water every day. The Kids club is perfect for families. In the surrounding you have several coffees bars, fast food and restaurants . The subway is just around the corner with an escalator upwards but not downwards. This was a disadvantage with stroller or with luggage. To the city it was about 25 mins and cost 4RMB with subway. 

We enjoyed our stay in the hotel very much. The price is pretty okay for what the hotels offers to the guests. All the staff is really friendly. If we come to Guangzhou again, we definitely would book this hotel again.

The service attitude is very good, the room hygiene is very clean, the scenery is very good and you can see Baiyun Mountain directly. In general, it is a good hotel. I will choose it next time I come to Guangzhou! (I forgot the name of the concierge lady, but you are really beautiful!) A good hotel, the surrounding environment is very good, dining is convenient, and transportation is also convenient. The hotel staff are well trained. You can feel the full love for work, the service is very careful and considerate. We chatted on the 5th floor to watch the view. Everyone is very enthusiastic and worth recommending.

This time I ordered a business room package, which is only slightly cheaper than an ordinary deluxe room, but comes with two additional benefits.

The hotel also made special arrangements for me. After returning to the room with my girlfriend after a good night, I saw a celebration cake. Totally overjoyed. Youth class management is full of vitality.

There are still some details that can be improved (such as the arrangement of tableware when delivering meals), but overall, the service level is excellent.

Facilities: High-end swimming pool, swimming is relatively cold, we chose to play in the warm water pool at 39 degrees, which is very comfortable. The children had a lot of fun. The buffet breakfast and afternoon tea were also prepared very carefully ❤️

Service: The service of each waiter is very good. The front desk remembered my last name very carefully. There are waiters to guide and take care of each area. The high-end service is full. There is also a complete set of special children's shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush, and shoes. Pillows are also divided into various materials for us to choose! 

In short, it is a very satisfactory experience, which is worth coming often! It is also very worry-free to bring a baby!

There are also various snacks around the hotel, Luckin Coffee, and you can walk to the hotel from Exit D of Huangbian Station on Metro Line 2.

The chef will provide guests with various types of porridge, noodles, and noodles according to your favorite side dishes. If you are hungry at night and want to order takeout, the hotel robot can also provide food delivery to your room. From the entrance of the hotel, every staff member you meet will take the initiative to greet the guests.

I also like the design in the room, which is simple, stylish and generous. The bed is also very comfortable, the shower head water is very large, and the air conditioning cooling effect is also good! Compared with some famous five-star hotels, Junya's hardware facilities are still worthy of praise! The only shortcoming during this stay is that it is a bit inconvenient for motor vehicles to enter and exit. Because of construction, motor vehicles are not allowed to pass through the design park. Sometimes the driver who calls a car is afraid of trouble and does not want to drive to the underground parking lot. You need to walk to the park gate to get a car. I hope that the park will allow cars to pass through next time I stay. Overall, the stay experience was great and it is definitely worth recommending to friends!

The hotel is in a first-class location, just outside the Huangbian subway station. It's really far away from Yongqingfang in the old city, Shangxiajiu, and Canton Tower! This time the Hong Kong train goes north, it takes 45 minutes to reach Yongqingfang first, but there is always a traffic jam in the old city! If you are going to visit most of the scenic spots in your itinerary, you really want to stay in Huiguobian. When I book this trip, I will stay in Tanqu Hotel Xinjing + connecting rooms + isolation and a large shopping mall!
In addition, the hotel parking system is really confusing, and there are insufficient ground signs. Make a circle on the left and ask the mall staff to know first that you need to enter the parking lot of the Design City Park on the left, and then follow the instructions to scan the code several times to go to the designated parking space of the hotel. ! Thank you for having fun!

msg:It's quite boring when I think about it. I just went to another district to stay in a hotel for the night. I wanted to have some leisure before school started. I was afraid of traffic jams on the highway, so I chose a hotel in the city to stay. The hotel is very new and clean, and the front desk is very considerate. I bought a hotel package and everything was arranged. They helped me upgrade my room, arranged the number of people dining, took the initiative to provide supplies and small gifts for the children, and also helped me delay my check-out. When it was time to check in, I forgot about the complimentary game console coins and reminded me. During my stay, I was able to relax and enjoy the vacation with insufficient balance. What I am most satisfied with is the swimming pool. It is clean and hygienic, and the lifeguards are very responsible. I observed that they keep an eye on the children. In many hotel swimming pools, I have not experienced such attentive service. The buffet dinner and breakfast were also very good, not outstanding, but they didn't deduct points either. There is a shopping mall next to the hotel, and there are many choices of restaurants. After checking out and dining in the mall, the children played for a while with the game coins given by the hotel, and my husband and I sat and took a rest in the cafe. Overall it's very good.

msg:I took my granddaughter on a weekend trip and chose this hotel online. The guy at the check-in desk was very friendly and sent fruits to the kids. The hotel staff were very friendly. When I asked relevant questions when I checked out, Manager Zhang at the front desk explained patiently and carefully. The room is clean and tidy, and the bedding is comfortable. The bathroom and toilet in the room are separated to separate dry and wet areas. The bathroom and cloakroom are in the same area, making it convenient to wash and change clothes. The room lacks a workbench, and it is a bit inconvenient to charge electronic products online. The children's playground is clean and bright, and young children can play there for a day. The swimming pool water is clean, but there are private instructors to teach students to swim. It is best to use buoys to separate swimming students from free swimmers. In addition, private instructors do not change their shoes when entering the swimming pool. It also does not comply with the city’s swimming pool management regulations.

Winnie's service at the front desk is warm and thoughtful, which makes people feel very friendly. What's even more valuable is that the surrounding facilities of the hotel are complete, and the Shiguanghui Shopping Center is within walking distance, which provides great convenience to travelers.

The New Year check-in activities are even more eye-catching and full of strong festive a**osphere. The hotel has carefully prepared various New Year activities, which not only enriches the guests' stay experience, but also adds to the joy of the New Year. In addition, the hotel also provides a rich breakfast with all kinds of delicacies, which will greatly increase your appetite.

Overall, Junya Hotel is a very good hotel. Whether it is the environment, service or activity arrangement, it is very impressive. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and hope they can experience the high-quality service and happy New Year a**osphere here.

It's next to a shopping mall with restaurants and supermarkets, and it's a few minutes away from the Huangbian subway station. It's very convenient. The front desk upgraded the room for free because we had children. A welcome fruit was given and we were sent to the elevator. Both the hotel and the room were very clean and hygienic.

The hotel is very kind to children. It is also very friendly. There is a free children's playground, children's toiletries and step stools. The softness of the clothes is acceptable, not very soft.

Connecting room: very convenient, suitable for a family of four, no bathtub
Disadvantages: The overall room is very dark and there are very few lights. This is a bit unbearable. Although the manager on duty asked the maintenance man to repair the light *****, due to design problems, it was very dark, and those who could not accept it could be persuaded to leave.

Service: Most of the staff are very enthusiastic. The one point deducted is for the front desk and the staff inside the swimming pool. No bath towels were given. When I got to the swimming pool, I was already playing in the water, and I found that there were no bath towels on the lounge chairs or in the swimming pool. There was only one security guard in the swimming pool. I asked the security guard and he didn’t know where to get bath towels. I went to the front desk to ask. I had already entered the water, and it was super cold when I ran out with my children. There was no sense of service at all! There was no smile throughout the whole process. How unhappy was she! Later, I communicated with the cleaning lady to help get it.

It is recommended to put bath towels in the swimming pool and bathing area. This should be the most basic.

The only slightly troublesome thing is that the hotel's windows cannot open and close on their own. Staff have to be called to open and close the windows every day. It is recommended that the hotel configure window limiters as soon as possible to ensure safety and save the trouble of manual calls.

msg:The design of the hotel room is very unique, with wet and dry separation. The bathroom also has a sink, but the amount of water is small, so bathing is not satisfying. The front desk service was excellent, but it was a bit overwhelming. They gave us an extra breakfast, afternoon tea (dessert, pizza, sandwiches, soft drinks) and a gift when we left. I stayed at the hotel on New Year's Eve and deliberately chose to have a buffet New Year's Eve dinner in the hotel. There were a lot of people at the beginning and there were no service staff at the door. I was in a bad mood and felt like everyone was trying to grab it. But after a while, there were fewer people. According to me Guess, many people who didn't buy buffet tickets were persuaded to go back. The dining environment suddenly improved. The dishes were very rich, focusing on various meats and seafood. I liked the cheese lobster and durian cake. The breakfast is the most sumptuous I have had recently. It has everything you need, including dumplings. The hotel has a free swimming pool. Finally, I want to complain about the traffic in the hotel. It should be said that it is outrageous. There is no road on the ground that can lead to the entrance of the hotel. It is blocked in all directions. If you want to go to the hotel, you have to get off the car on the street and walk 200 meters, or use the underground garage of the hotel. It is impossible for people who go there for the first time, including locals, to find the specific location of the hotel directly. There are no road signs on the street, but there are road signs in the basement. It's easy.

After eight o'clock in the evening, he was hungry and worked for a long time, and the temperature was cooling down. When he arrived at the hotel, he was really tired, cold and hungry. We went to the Sheraton the next day, and the front desk took the initiative to record the information for us.
One of the rooms couldn't be locked at all. Later, when I went out to eat, I came back and found that the door locks were all broken. Someone came and looked very aggressive and even slammed the door.
Later, the duty manager came. He was very nice and knew how to handle things.
I didn't want to give any points at first, but I thought about the manager on duty and quickly solved the problem. Forget it, the points were given to the beautiful manager on duty. There was only one old man who brought his four-year-old baby when breakfast was served. We didn't go to eat, so we don't know how the breakfast was.
The windows couldn't be opened, it was stuffy, and the smell was too strong and always felt pungent. The sound insulation is very poor. Anyone passing by or closing the door will feel the sound at the door. I didn't sleep all night and checked out the next day. Poly Hotel is a hotel that comes and goes but is really average, and the combs don’t even match.

Loud talking and chatting, poor sound insulation. The hotel should be positioned as a five-star hotel, but the three cans of soda in the minibar are chargeable, which is a bit stingy. The hotel's catering service couldn't keep up. I had to wait almost an hour for a strawberry-themed afternoon tea in the lobby dining bar. One cup of coffee was leaked.

msg:I have stayed at Design City Junya Hotel several times. It is a hidden treasure hotel in my heart. I originally wanted to keep it in my heart, but after several times, the hotel’s stay experience deserves to be seen by more people, and it deserves a good review. , if I could give it a rating, I think it deserves more than 5 points of praise, especially Winnie Li. The service is very considerate and attentive. When encountering customer feedback problems, she will actively and attentively solve them as soon as possible and take care of the customer's feelings. In this way I have not experienced the service attitude and awareness even in many more expensive and high-end large five-star hotels in Guangzhou, so I am still very emotional. I did not expect to experience it here. It is very warm and caring, and the service concept exceeds my expectations. Moreover, the hotel's The breakfast is also very good. It is located in Baiyun District, so it has the famous tofu noodles from Baiyun Mountain, as well as the long-lost hand-pushed morning tea snacks, etc. In many, many places, you can see that it is working hard to develop its own characteristics... So, for me, In other words, it is a private treasure hotel with an affordable price and a strong sense of service from its staff. It is located in Baiyun District and is surrounded by the large business district of Poly Time. It has complete facilities and does not have the involution and speed of the Zhujiang New Town hotel district. rhythm, without losing its own characteristics. I often recommend it to my friends. It can be used as a staycation destination for people in the Pearl River Delta, and as a choice for business trips. Unfortunately, I did not take photos of the room for your reference. , there are only a few photos of the Chris**as a**osphere of the hotel, because I originally didn’t want to write a review and post photos, but in the end I still wanted to write it. After all, a good experience deserves to be recognized, and more good experiences are worthy of your coming. Experience it well. Now the Chris**as a**osphere is getting stronger and the hotel has more Chris**as a**osphere. I sincerely hope that Junya Hotel will get better and better. Thank you again Winnie for your considerate service...

The service is very good and everything is answered. The room was also very comfortable and clean.

There is a children's playground here, which children like very much, as well as a heated swimming pool and massage pool. In the evening, there is a simple meal in the lobby bar on the fifth floor. The price is very affordable. It is not the price of a hotel, but the price of a tea restaurant. There is also a live band.

The breakfast is also very sincere, with pork ribs and chicken feet, as well as special milk tea, lemon tea, tofu curd, rice rolls and other more Chinese foods.

The executive lounge is also very sincere and comfortable. Recommended!

I am very grateful to Amy at the front desk for her help during check-in and check-out. She thoughtfully arranged two adjacent rooms and gave one room that was ready for occupancy. We then let us put our luggage and go star-chasing💖When checking out, we asked about the damage to the USB on the bedside If the shower was damaged, he immediately apologized and treated us to fruit! It really makes you feel at ease, and Amy is smiling and approachable ~ Great!

The room is comfortable and tidy, and the wet and dry separation of the bathroom and toilet is very good😍

Finally, I would like to thank Jennie and the male colleagues in the bar depar**ent~ We were able to help us arrange late night snacks at 9:20 so that we didn’t have to walk around. Thank you very much to other colleagues who helped us🙏

Make our stay a pleasant experience

Room facilities, because the ventilation system is insufficient, the whole room smells of urine, and the air conditioner cannot be adjusted internally. If your room faces the west, it will be very hot in the afternoon. In addition, a reptile as thin as sesame seeds was seen in the room.

Breakfast has many choices, but the quality is average

There are two large connected 5-story shopping malls nearby, suitable for evening activities￼

4. There were mosquitoes on the day of check-in, but the hotel provided electric mosquito spray.
5. The TV cannot cast the screen. After looking for the hotel, the hotel sent a screen casting device that can be connected externally, but it is of no use. Once the screen casting device is connected, the wifi cannot be used. To cast online videos, you need to use your own data. It's very laggy when put on TV. I don’t know why it needs to be equipped with an LG TV.

I called several times in the middle of the night to communicate with the driver and drove around for half an hour before finding the parking lot. There were no instructions when we first entered.

msg:The experience in the hotel restaurant was poor and the morning buffet felt discriminated against. The waiter pushed the dining cart past and called to the waiter to get the meal. The waiter said "wait" and without stopping, he stopped in front and handed out the meal to the customers in suits who were seated in front. After going around for a while, no one came over to us. After asking again, the waiter said "no more" and left.
On that day, there were many hotel guests wearing suits and going to the conference hall for meetings. We all understand that the hotel wants to serve customers with large group orders, but it is outrageous to completely ignore ordinary guests and not even show respect.
When I reported it to the manager on duty, he was told that there was a round every half hour, and if there was no food for that round, there was nothing we could do, so please wait for the next round. Anyway, it's not their problem that the theme is deliberately ignoring you. The problem is that you are impatient to wait for the next round, and there's nothing they can do about it. Although we had already waited for a while when we ate, the second time we saw the dining car, we immediately stopped the waiter to inquire. Although, we were deceived and ignored.
It is suggested that the hotel should divide an area directly for ordinary guests like us when there are VIP guests, so as not to hinder the hotel's willingness to concentrate on serving VIPs.

There is a square where you can eat, so you don’t have to worry about food. You can walk to the hotel from Huangbian Station of Metro Line 2, which is not too far. From Beijing Road, Tiyu West Road takes about 30-40 minutes. If you are traveling with children or the elderly, it is recommended to stay in the downtown area, which is convenient for taking a lunch break. It is a bit of a hassle to get back and forth. The hotel can take Metro Line 2 directly to the airport T1 and T2, which takes about 30 minutes, which is quite convenient.

Some drivers don't deliver to the hotel entrance or the underground parking lot, which is very inconvenient! The service is good, there will be waiters who will give directions to the nearest place to call a taxi. The breakfast is rich. You can scan the QR code to order directly in the room, which is very efficient.

msg:The hotel is very new, and the geographical environment is relatively good in Baiyun District. There is a shopping mall, supermarkets and restaurants just around the corner when you go out.
The room facilities are good, because the executive room I live in has a high floor and is very quiet. The mountain view room is said to be good, but you can actually see the top of the mountain from a distance. When I went there, it happened to be mostly rainy and foggy, so I could only imagine the scenery.
Breakfast is a buffet. The restaurant is not large and there are not many places, so it feels relatively crowded. When you go to pick up your meal, it is best to leave one person at your seat, otherwise the waiter will be quick and clear the table. The raw porridge is very delicious, but you just need to wait.

msg:The hotel is clean and the rooms are quite big, but everything feels very stingy. Nowadays, five-star hotels rarely charge deposits. This hotel requires a 500 deposit for a room. I was informed that it would be refunded on the day of check-out. However, when I checked the account the next day, it was not found. I was refunded after I contacted the hotel myself. The room I booked included the executive lounge on the 26th floor. They were told that hot snacks would be available at 6pm, but the staff asked me to confirm the room number and contact the front desk over and over again. Eat, and if you want a Coke, you have to go to the studio on the side to get it. Who can’t afford a bottle of Coke? Yes, and what I ate was most likely the leftovers from breakfast, so I didn’t go there again the next day. As a Poly's five-star standard, but the whole hotel looks petty and the staff are not friendly. I'd better stay at Shangri-La next time, at least the Horizon Club is delicious!

Especially the administrative benefits are all five-star, and I enjoy them very much.
The only thing I feel is that the administrative floor is on the same floor as the confinement club. This innovation is too innovative. I have never heard of it even when I travel around the world. The cries of little breasts and the lively conversations of family members and visiting people. The sound of confinement service staff in professional clothing shuttled between the aisles, which was like a symphony scene. I also feel that I am also living in the Yuezi Club.
Ask your hotel general manager to think about what this feels like.
Finally, thank you very much for your hotel's professionalism and allowing me to enjoy professional five-star service. I will definitely come back and stay for another 4 days!

msg:The room was okay. I originally got off the plane in Baiyun at 1 a.m. that day, so I wanted to find a good one that was close enough to go to the city center the next day. It was later delayed until 3 o'clock, but because the time was special, I looked for it before booking. I went to the front desk to confirm whether to book on the 18th or the 17th in the early morning of the 18th. She clearly told me that it was the 18th. At three o'clock in the morning, I braved heavy rain and finally took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, but the front desk told me that I should book on the 17th. , I talked to her for a long time, and she said that on the 17th, she would check out from 3 to 8 in the morning. I said that I had called before coming to ask, otherwise I would not be able to come. She said that she would call her the next day. I went to check the phone recording 😂, and if I book on the 18th, I will be charged an extra 500 yuan. I don’t agree, because I booked two rooms for 1,200 and I think the current house price is also 500 yuan, not 1,200. Cheap, then she called their manager in the middle of the night and heard their manager ask me what room I had booked and at what price. Is there a big difference if I book a regular room and a deluxe room? I thought this was just a matter of taste. Flattery? I felt very uncomfortable after hearing that. Later she opened a room for me and said she would see me the next day. She didn’t call me the next day. I thought it was because I checked the recording and was embarrassed. Come on, the price of this hotel is comparable to that of franchised hotels in the city center. Is this the attitude of the front desk and manager? Moreover, delivery people are not allowed in when delivering takeout. When the takeout arrives, I need to call the front desk in person. The front desk just let me in. Am I here to enjoy myself or am I here to cause trouble? And I deliberately made it difficult. Since I wrote a negative review and typed so many words, I really should consider the problem of this hotel.

The hotel is also very caring, the decoration is simple but thoughtful, especially the cakes delivered are of high quality, and the cream fragrance is stronger than that of the cake shop👍🏻

The location is a bit out of the way, but it is very convenient. The subway is directly connected. There is a mall and various food stalls downstairs. There are a lot of food and entertainment.

The room this time includes the executive lounge. The food is rich and has local characteristics. The creme brulee in the dessert is especially delicious. The lounge has on-site bartending, and there are billiards and darts next to it. This configuration can be ranked 10% in the lounges of major international chains

The waiters encountered in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello. The check-in process is a bit cumbersome due to the special requirements of Baiyun District, but the front desk can also help to complete it smoothly.

Overall very recommended ⭐

The front desk immediately asked the service staff to bring an air purifier and opened the windows for ventilation. It is very convenient to eat and shop around.
The only shortcoming is that the quality of cleaning needs to be improved. I originally booked two rooms that can be connected. I just need the cleaning to open the doors of the two connected rooms with the key. But the cleaning came and said that it could not be opened for the time being. She is very busy and needs two. After hours, she will open it again when she is not so busy, and ask if she agrees. I did not agree, indicating that the door needed to be opened immediately, but the cleaning lady threw a face, as if taking the key to help the customer open the door was adding a lot of work burden to her. After opening the door, thank her politely, she is still angry! Even if your family owns countless properties and treats work as a pastime, you should know the most basic manners!

To reflect the hotel's swimming pool, we should go swimming. The sister at the front desk of the outsourcing company said that one room only I can swim with two people. I have stayed in so many hotels and have never tried this clause. Their company stipulates? Isn't the company policy the hotel policy? Then I said that one room card can accommodate 2 people, and our 2 room cards can accommodate 4 people. If there is an extra child to make up for 138 people, I said that I don’t have to swim. Later, a big guy fitness trainer came and told me After the discount, you can make up more than 180 swimming pools. You can go swimming. I continue to be uncompromising and communicate with the front desk. After waiting for a while, the front desk staff came to tell us that we can swim, and we will not collect money. I misunderstood. Finally, I asked them a question , Is your swimming pool and fitness room outsourced to an outside company? During the conversation with the front desk staff, a group of big guy fitness trainers came and surrounded me to watch the fun😂 The hotel breakfast should be mentioned, and the fruit hygiene needs to be improved.

msg:Facilities: When choosing a hotel, what you pay more attention to is whether it is a newly opened hotel in recent years, because the facilities of a newly opened hotel will be relatively new and complete. This restaurant was newly opened in 2023, and it really did not disappoint us, and it can be said to be a very pleasant surprise, okay? The room is a twin bed with a chaise longue and complete basic facilities. The washroom and toilet are independent, and are equipped with two washstands, which is convenient for family travel. At the same time, there is also a relatively small and exquisite coat area, which is very convenient for hanging clothes and placing suitcases. The most surprising thing is that the hotel also has a hand-held Philips ironing machine. The toiletries provided by the hotel are also very good, they are not miscellaneous brands. After I washed them, I found them to be good and asked for them again. I have already repurchased them. The hotel swimming pool is also very good. There is also a gym and a children's playground, which is convenient for babies to play in water.
Cleanliness: The hotel is newly opened, so the cleanliness is definitely worth mentioning. We stayed for three nights in a row and cleaned and tidied up every day.
Environment: The hotel is very close to the Huangbian Road subway station, about 5 minutes on foot. We basically used the subway to travel in those few days, which is indeed more convenient. At the same time, there is a shopping mall connected to the banquet hall area on the third floor of the hotel. It is very convenient and nice to eat and shop. By the way, there are many coffee shops downstairs, day coffee and night wine, as well as tea, which is delicious!
Service: The room service is very good. Before going, consider contacting the hotel with many people to see if it is convenient to make a bed. When we arrived, the room had already been made and the bed was reserved for us, and because we needed to wait when we checked in, the lady at the front desk was also handling it After checking in, they gave us a piece of fruit as an apology. Considering that we have a large number of people staying, the hotel will put a few more bottles of water every day. Every day when we enter and exit the hotel, there will be a little brother to help us open the door.
Breakfast: The hotel's breakfast is Chinese and Western. There are two coffee machines. It may be that there are not enough people. In short, it is very thoughtful. There are many types, and the western dim sum is delicious. The only fly in the oin**ent is that there are not many places for breakfast in the hotel. It is recommended to stagger the peak hours, otherwise you need to wait for a place.

msg:1. The overall feeling: It is slightly better than regular express hotels, but it has nothing to do with five-star hotels.
2. Hygiene: Passable, at least there is no peculiar smell, and there is no obvious garbage.
3. Layout: The room is fairly large, but the layout of the bathroom and bath is a bit strange. Entering the door is the bathroom, with a toilet, a sink, and a door; the second is the washstand, and the shower room, and the locker is right next to the washstand, which feels weird to be separated from wet and dry; then there is the bed and small sofa.
4. Cost-effectiveness and service: In general, I heard that the store just opened in March, but I didn’t feel any service. The service is not very mature. When communicating, I am not very sure about some information, and the voice is a bit low. Generally, the hotel will send some fruit or something, but there are 38 fruits at the checkin counter in the hotel lobby-fragrant pear, small apple, and nectarine. The room rate only includes the accommodation fee and two small bottles of mineral water in the room.
It is recommended to change the hotel's music to some soothing and brisk songs that don't need to be so exciting....

The service is very good, especially jennie at the front desk, who is warm, courteous, meticulous and considerate.
The room is spacious and bright, clean and comfortable, and the water quality of the indoor swimming pool is also very good.
The restaurant has good products, fresh ingredients, and sausage for breakfast; the buffet dinner has freshly prepared cocktails, freshly cut suckling pig, and freshly made moxibustion sushi, which are very distinctive.
The executive lounge has a nice view and the cocktails are delicious.

msg:Serve:
Basically, employees above the supervisory level are more attentive, eager to meet the needs of customers, and more enthusiastic! However, compared with the grassroots employees, they seem less enthusiastic and less polite.

Food: The administrative courtesy on the first day was quite tasteless, with few varieties and poor taste. The next day, I don’t know if it was because of the live broadcast or some other reason, but it still felt a little perfunctory. For example, radish beef brisket and curry chicken nuggets should have used radish for cost or efficiency. . . It is rarer to have radishes in chicken curry instead of potatoes. . .

Facilities: The facilities in the room are relatively complete in these aspects, and because it is a suite, the hair dryer is Dyson, but I would like to make a suggestion, that is, there is a charge for the large bucket of water in the hotel room, because the normal five-star hotel water No money will be collected, and then it was only after leaving that the deposit was deducted for no reason.

Hygiene: Hygiene is still acceptable, overall relatively clean and tidy

Environment: The hotel has its own gym, swimming pool, and there are dining bars, lobby bars, Chinese restaurants, and Western restaurants, which are all available

msg:This time, my husband and I chose the Junya Hotel for the 7th anniversary of our marriage, and we were not disappointed. The hotel knew that it was our 7th anniversary and arranged some small scenes in the room. They gave us a delicious mini cake and gave us an upgrade. I chose the room type, gave welcome fruit, and brought a bathtub. The children had a great time. The hotel is newly opened, but there is no smell at all. I stayed for two nights and it was very comfortable?
Let’s talk about the surrounding area: the nearby Thai-style small street is also full of Internet celebrities. There is no need to worry about what to eat in large complex shopping malls.

Talk about the buffet 🦐
The service from the cleaning staff to the leadership of the hotel is very good, especially Colin Lin, the director of the food and beverage depar**ent. We went to the buffet and arranged an anniversary for us. The cake was arranged by the window. The buffet seafood is very fresh and lively. Every dish is worth the money.

Talk about hotel facilities:
The hotel has a children's play area and a very long swimming pool. Next to the swimming pool is a hot spring pool similar to a hot spring. For children, if they are afraid of catching cold from swimming, they can go to the hot spring. It is also very good to learn to swim there. The water temperature is comfortable and not hot. Not cold, their details amazed me, using a deep wearing hair dryer with L'Oreal essential oils for women's care. The details are really touching.

Definitely recommend it!

It is recommended. After all, it is owned by the Poly Group. It is much better than those five-star hotels in the old city.
The five of us are traveling by renting a car, so it is very convenient to go back and forth to the city and around Guangzhou

The room is hygienic and clean.
But the design is unreasonable: the doors of different rooms are about 10 cm apart.
Getting in and out is embarrassing, and the sound of opening and closing the door seriously affects it! The door next door was still opening and closing after 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, which is very bad for traveling with children.
There are children's toothbrushes, but no children's slippers.
The front desk service is unprofessional and slow! It was a crash, but I waited for a long time at the front desk!
The swimming pool and fitness room are open to the public, but there are off-peak hours, so there are not many people.
It is convenient to change clothes and take a shower. Electric works well.
The children's playground area smells very bad (glue smell)
breakfast is ok. The environment of the restaurant is good, but the waiters are unprofessional: there are people at the next table who are eating, but they are spraying and wiping the table at a high distance, and they will grab the way of the customers when walking (the service will suddenly intersect directly in front of the customers holding the food). The plate in use will be taken away from you...,
Next to it is the commercial area, where you can eat, drink and have fun. It's good to have some BBQ and drink in the evening!
The traffic is also good, next to the subway entrance. Cars can also drive to the hotel entrance.
The doorman on the first floor is very polite!

msg:The newly opened hotel has comfortable and clean rooms, and there are many shopping and dining options in the surrounding area, but landscape leisure places such as parks are still under construction. New hotels inevitably have room for improvement, but the service is excellent. Special thanks to Simi, who gave us meticulous care during the stay. No matter what request, Simi responded immediately, acted quickly, professionally and well coordinated, making us feel satisfied, warm and happy. I would also like to thank Simi's supervisor, who did his best to solve our problems perfectly. The hotel's buffet breakfast has a lot of room for improvement, but the products of the hotel's Chinese restaurant are very good! Even those who are picky about food are full of praise. Given the chance, we would go on vacation again.

msg:The company is just 2 minutes next to the hotel, so I basically stay in this hotel. The infrastructure is put aside and the room rate increases by more than 50% when there is a negotiated price. I personally think it is a very unreasonable combination. As long as the review is good, breakfast will be given, so this rating cannot be reflected. The hotel's true peak season increase is understandable, but if it exceeds the market increase, the hotel is cheating. The relevant situation has been submitted to the relevant depar**ents. However, Junya is a local company. I don't know whether the government depar**ents can treat them equally. As an old customer of Ctrip, I hope the platform can come forward. Solve this kind of behavior that deceives consumers

msg:The first stop in Guangzhou, I landed a little early in the morning to check in. The lady at the front desk was very helpful, but then something happened that left me speechless. Because the hotel windows are closed, you need to contact the hotel staff to come to the room and use professional tools to open the windows. So an aunt came and stayed in our room for a long time without opening it. Then she turned around and closed the door and left. Then ten minutes later, he took the staff's room card and swiped the door directly to open the door and come in? ? Two girls share a room. You know there is someone in the room, but you just swipe your card in without knocking? Does that mean you can also swipe in after I fall asleep at night?

Then the next day when the cleaning staff finished cleaning, the refrigerator did not replenish the soda. I even specifically asked the front desk to deliver two bottles and charge for the room. The fee was deducted for four bottles of soda. I spent a long time trying to figure out what six bottles of soda is. It’s not your problem. You didn’t figure it out. You didn’t handle it. You came to me and kept asking. Do you think I drank six bottles of soda? It’s funny. You guys are 19.8, which is not much. If you want money, I'll just donate it and drink soda. It's so laborious.

Breakfast ends at 10 o'clock and there is nothing to eat at 9 o'clock. At the noodle stall, whoever can grab it eats the noodles, but I didn’t grab it anyway.

msg:The facilities and environment of the hotel are okay, and the welcome and front desk work are also good. The only thing that makes people very unhappy is that at night and in the morning, someone comes to the room by swiping the card or pushing the door (of course they don't come in). Then they go to the peephole to look but can't see it. I was very angry when I arrived. Secondly, the soundproofing next door was very poor. I could clearly hear the sound of others opening and closing doors, which made me not have a good rest at all. In the end, the breakfast was okay, and the food in the Chinese restaurant at my own expense was quite delicious.

msg:Checked in on the 18th. It rained heavily that night. I got wet and went back to the concierge on the first floor of the hotel to borrow an umbrella. The concierge said there was no umbrella and he had to go to the front desk on the fifth floor to get one. When I arrived at the front desk and reported my room number, the front desk saw that I was soaked and still refused to give me an umbrella. Is the deposit not enough to pay for the umbrella?
On the 19th, I came to the room with an executive gift and apologized. I booked an executive room, and these gifts were included. Why do you apologize to me with something I spent my own money? Is this the hotel's apology attitude?
I checked out on the morning of the 21st and had already paid 630 yuan for the room. The front desk said that the deposit would be refunded later, but half an hour after I left the hotel, the hotel again deducted 630 yuan for the room from the deposit. Until I called the front desk, the front desk said they didn't know about this.
During the 4-day stay, the experience was extremely poor. None of the staff training was in place from top to bottom.

I asked the guy downstairs and he told me to ask the driver to tell the security guard to pick up the hotel guests. But after asking, he still refused to let in. The guy said there was nothing you could do and you had to go out and take the car. Later, the plane was almost too late to catch up with the car in which I dragged two suitcases out in the heavy rain. The management is really bad. This is the first time I see a hotel where cars cannot be driven to the lobby to pick people up. Not recommended.

msg:首先 酒店周邊生活配套很全面，這是比較好的，接下來對酒店一些不足的地方，大概表述一下
1可能新酒店 電梯裏裝飾餘留味道很重
2wifi不穩定，信號很弱
3浴室淋浴沖水時一會兒熱一會恢復正常…
4入住一天，電視也不能看，雖然有原因，但要提前告知顧客
5房門入口地面有固定門吸，但門上怎麼沒對應的配件，開門後根本固定不住
6早上空調風力調到最大，也出不了很大的風，製冷效果不足，不解

五星標準不太匹配，有待改進…！





服務有待改善，五星酒店等級目前不太匹配

房間的衞生狀況令人滿意，清潔且整潔，體現出酒店對細節的關注。客房服務人員在樓層見面時也會禮貌地打招呼，這種對工作的敬業精神和尊重讓我感到非常温暖。更值得一提的是，早餐選擇了到三樓餐廳點了粵式早茶，味道十分不錯，為我的早餐時光增添了別樣的風味。

總的來説，這次入住體驗非常棒，我對郡雅酒店留下了極佳的印象。我相信無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，郡雅酒店都是一個理想的選擇。

酒店從在大堂停車開始就一路有人引導，也有停車券送，比較方便。前台設定在五樓，同時五樓有酒店的餐廳，據説早茶很正宗。
客房房間很大，內有洗衣服務，枕頭可以自己選擇材質，窗外風景也還可以，就是有的地方還在施工，不過酒店隔音很好，我沒有聽見過任何噪音。
酒店周邊過個路口就是商場，無論是出去買東西吃飯逛街還是唱k按摩都很方便。
辦理退房之後也有人員幫我送到車上，出行訂這家都是一路綠燈，好評！

雙人行政酒廊禮遇: 沒啥喝的，就可樂雪碧芬達，酒廊太小
游泳池，衹有幹蒸沒有濕蒸
房間也就中規中矩
早餐也中規中矩，沒有驚喜

唯一滿意的是Winnie的服務，因為臨時有事，延遲退房也沒問題

房間的送餐價格不貴。
入住的時候太晚了第二天才去體驗游泳池，因為是攜程會員有延遲退房福利，所以遊的時候在中午，人不多，水很清，真心不錯。那個按摩池很舒服，估計重金投資，比很多掛牌五星的酒店都好很多。更衣室裏麪也有桑南房，但女賓的沒開，男賓的貌似温度開得很高。 總的來説同城小度假是不錯的選擇。

訂了家庭房，由一間大床房和一間雙床房連通而成，中間有門可以關上也可以打開。房間足夠大，地毯柔軟、床品及拖鞋很舒適、暖氣充足，在降温的天氣裏也完全不會冷。洗手間浴室分開，十分方便，淋浴間寬敞，洗澡很舒心。
酒店早餐十分豐盛，中餐西餐一應俱全，也有現煮粉面及粥，餐廳環境很好。
周邊餐館很多，外賣也很方便，外賣可由機器人送到房間門口，但高峯期有可能排隊。小建議：可以考慮在一層大堂設定外賣櫃，方便住客自取。
總體體驗十分好，會推薦家人朋友也來住！

msg:首先我是一個經常出差的人，一年起碼有6個月是住在酒店裡，基本都是5星的，所以我相信我對酒店的各項評價是經過對比後中肯的。
這次是連住了3晚套房。但是酒店需要改進的地方真的是太多了。
1.入住第一天。有提供歡迎水果，但是是讓我等一會把袋子給我提上去的，歡迎水果不應該是在房間嘛？
2.關於隔音。因為在商業中心，白天有點吵可以理解。但是作為套房晚上白天我都經常聽到電梯聲音，早上8點多樓頂會有踩踏樓梯板的聲音，在外邊客廳還可以很清楚聽到門外走廊的聲音。就着實不符合套房的標準了
3.車不能開到酒店門口，衹能到地下停車場，不然走進去需要300米左右，這個是可以提前説明的，對於我這種拿着大行李箱的，找到地下停車場才方便進酒店。
4.關於瓶裝水，迷你吧等收費能接受，但是搞衞生前提示了讓多放幾瓶水，也沒放就真的不太合適。
5.關於早餐，酒廊等都沒去，就不評價了。
優點方面：服務人員熱情，這點值得肯定！但是重要的是隔音太差，提示的簡單事情做不到都需要改進！

竟然沒有書桌！！！
當然我不確定是否每個房間都沒有，至少我的房間沒有。
非常的不方便！
還有一點也很有意思，叫外賣的話不像其他有機器人的酒店，直接就送上來，這家酒店需要外賣到了之後打電話去前台，前台再通知保安，如果跟快遞小哥説直接讓保安用機器人送上來是不行的。非常麻煩。導致有一次夜裡11點外賣到了，保安不給用機器人送，必須要我通知前台，但是前台沒人接。不得已下樓去拿的。 實在不理解。

其他都還行，御公館的早茶一絕，非常推薦。

缺點：由於酒店所在地塊物業禁止地面交通，封閉了所有地面車輛道路，所有車輛一定要下地下車庫前往P2停車庫才能到達酒店。但是地下車庫裡麪極其複雜有5個停車庫，第一次前往的住客幾乎是不可能找到，因此建議1）每位新住客到店前提前電話通知對方，需要開車至P2車庫，給住客提前預警。2）在各大攜程等平台重點提醒開車/乘車住客注意前往車庫，以免造成住客由於找不到酒店而產生的不愉快

服務：服務給滿分，不管是酒店還是餐廳，健身房，員工態度都特別好，他們對待客人非常認真。例如吃飯的時候，服務員主動注意到我坐的桌子不穩，然後提出幫忙墊高。反正就是非常棒啦

🎂入住驚喜：入住當日恰巧為我的生日。抵達酒店時已接近23點，Simi已在大堂等待，入住房間時由三名工作人員陪同前往房間，非常有心準備了蛋糕，新酒店的入住歡迎儀式真的好隆重。
🍽早餐體驗：首日早餐為自助早餐、次日升級為“吃到飽”茶點，餐廳主理（一位非常gentle的男生）拿紙筆熱情與住客逐個交談，同時認真記錄客人反饋入住體驗及用餐反饋，並且當即予以反饋解決，時效性極佳。

🥂行政禮遇：因為連續兩日錯過晚餐餐點僅享用了一happy hour，咖啡和酒水都很棒哦，服務人員也是有禮有節。
☕️增值服務：因為離店前往機場前還是想take away美式，結果小朋友書包遺忘酒店，直到到達機場才發現，致電酒店，酒店很快在大堂吧找到遺失書包並通過順豐幫到送達。

👍all in all，入住體驗絕妙，任點任食早茶也不熟米其林。再次感謝酒店工作人員的用心服務，讓我們的旅程留下美好記憶，這也許就是服務行業最美好的客户回饋了吧。[愛心]

酒店離黃邊地鐵站非常近，交通方便。抵達酒店在大堂等辦入住的過程中，小姐姐們很熱情的送給家裡人一瓶礦泉水。辦理入住的過程中，工作人員小姐姐加了家人的微信，貼心的告知早餐，下午茶，酒廊的使用時間和位置，家裡人年齡比較大，沒有孩子的陪伴，不太能玩轉酒店，入住期間遇到的的所有問題，工作人員熱情周到的有問必答。
入住第一天，就貼心的送來了歡迎水果。因為酒店剛剛開業，個別地方還在裝修，非常積極的為家人考慮，先後提出更換樓層，升級早餐，贈送餐券和小禮物一系列的補救服務。
小範圍的裝修其實本來也不太會打擾到家裡人的休息，整個溝通過程中，能感受到酒店的全體工作人員，把控經營一家酒店所有的細節，工作非常嚴謹，任何一點可能會影響客人入住體驗的小問題，都重點關注。
我媽媽作為第一批客人，對酒店的評價很高，住的過程非常愉快。囑咐我特別感謝一下simi張穎超，謝謝您對家裡人的照顧，讓他們的廣州之行更加圓滿。
一直覺得，這個世界上沒有哪家酒店能提供完美無缺的入住體驗，但郡雅酒店所有工作人員儘自己最大努力，儘可能讓客人感到盡善盡美，賓至如歸的那顆心，才是我替家裡人寫這篇評價的原因。
很感謝酒店全體的工作人員帶給家裡人這麼貼心美好的體驗和回憶。
下次的廣州之行，也會把郡雅酒店作為入住的優選項。
期待重逢。

服務：服務感覺還沒達到五星水準，到退房當天也沒有電話告訴幾點退房，是否需要續住

但是但是去的時候，有企業包下酒店開年會，吃早餐人滿為患，餐食供應也一般，餐食水準最多四星標準，行政禮遇沒有辦法完全體驗（行政酒廊被企業拿去開年會使用），衹能去早餐廳吃些東西，而且很一般吧

新的酒店，沒有歡迎模式燈光，進去抹黑找開關，窗簾沒有電動，一點不智能；
衞生間淋浴空間太小，馬桶和淋浴洗漱分開，過於擁擠，設計細節感覺不到五星的標準。
空調貌似不給力，反正開到了16度感覺正好。

由於入住較晚，跟前台溝通可延期退房，這個很人性化。
泳池乾淨，救生員配置還挺多，安全感拉滿。游完泳更衣室還有桑拿房可以蒸，特別舒服，疲勞隨着汗水全部蒸出來可。健身房設定還挺多的相對於其他酒店。
如果有機會一定會再來一次。

希望酒店能夠重視和改善
1.房間蚊子多 開着蚊香 一整晚都在跟蚊子搏鬥 半夜竟然還是被蚊子吵醒了 導致睡眠質量變差 這點太難受了
2.客房服務沒有記住客人的名字 我們提出需求希望可以給兩個浴缸套 直接被拒絕 説衹能提供一個 語氣不是很好 有待培訓 第二次竟然還打不通了
3.點了外賣竟然需要自己打電話給前台請求送上房間 我們住過其他酒店一般是打電話通知我們送上樓 而不是住客要求送上樓 這點體驗很差
4.早餐一般 四星標準 達不到五星水平 沒有鮮榨果汁 有飲料櫃但是沒法打開 建議還是弄個罩子蓋起來 以免引起誤會
5.房間很大也有浴缸 但是好像沒有看到喝酒的一些高腳杯具 這個希望後期可以完善
總得來説 房間環境還是不錯的 也有浴缸 但是整體來説符合四星標準 達不到五星水平 整體客房服務以及早餐有待提高
