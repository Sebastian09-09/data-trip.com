msg:Hotel is nice, modern and clean. Location is not an upside unless you want peace and quiet outside the city centre. No air ventilation system in the bathroom which is strange. Also, unable to have the choice of heating or AC at the same time as this is just how the hotel system works. I went when Guangzhou was getting warmer again and they still had the heating system on as it was much cooler the week before and there was no way to turn AC on as you just can't have both options at same time - so first night was pretty uncomfortable as it was stuffy and hot. The hot water in the shower was not hot enough either.

msg:This trip was booked by a high school girl. When we checked in that day, I was like a country bumpkin who had never seen the world, screaming and making her feel embarrassed. I asked her how she chose it? She said that when she went to Changsha last time, she felt that InterContinental Group should be all right.

Yes, the hotel is surrounded by rivers and shaded by green trees. When the weather is good, you can see the slender waist. The room is so spacious that it is amazing. The bathroom alone has six areas, including clothes and hats, dressing, washing, shower, toilet, and bathroom! The balcony is even more amazing! It's so big that it seems free. The welcome desserts and fruits are also not vague, and they are attentive. There is nothing wrong with the details and service!

The best thing is that during the May Day Golden Holiday, in such a rush, the price can be controlled lower than the budget I gave, and I am pleased with the development of this little assistant.

Later I found out that it was on a small island in Haizhu District! The girl said that the transportation is convenient, and there is nothing that can't be solved by taking a taxi. We are not in a hurry, so we come slowly after getting enough sleep. Compared to buying a high-priced house in a good location, wouldn’t it be nice to save the money and live more comfortably?

The front desk is on the third floor, and the elevator in the lobby can only go to the third floor. You have to go to the other side to change the elevator. The first time I parked in the underground parking lot, I found that the elevator in the accommodation can only go to the third floor, and there are actually several steps to get to the elevator room. I couldn't push the suitcase and baby stroller, so I had to drive to the lobby door on the first floor, put the things down, and then take the third floor to transfer, and then drive the car to the parking lot.

The hotel is also very clean, and the mattress is of moderate hardness. However, the pillows are a little too high, which is a bit unfriendly for people who usually use pillows that are not very high.

The hotel services can meet almost any reasonable request. However, the hotel's wifi speed is a bit slow, and there is almost no signal in certain locations inside the hotel (the hotel entrance). In addition, it is not very friendly to guests who order takeout. The front desks of other hotels provide the service of robot delivery, but not here. As long as you order takeout, you must go to the first floor to pick it up in person. The front desk of the hotel is on the third floor. From the room Go down to the 3rd floor, and then you need to walk 20 meters to change to the elevator to reach the takeout counter on the first floor. I communicated with the front desk staff about this issue of taking out takeout, and the hotel’s reply was: The hotel has a robot specifically responsible for this. Ordering food is delivered in the hotel, and due to food safety storage issues, guests can only take out the food in person. I can't understand what the food safety issue has to do with the need to take out the food in person. However, my understanding is that This hotel is more supportive of guests ordering or dining in the hotel!

Regarding this, I feel very unhappy

It is the largest, best and most well-designed of all the five-star hotels I have stayed in in Guangzhou so far. It is highly recommended. The only regret is that it is a little cold due to the weather. The room temperature is the same as the bath water temperature; the room temperature is because the ceiling is too high, so the heating effect is affected, the lobby is very cold, and the staff are shivering; the room is relatively better, but if you have to turn on the heater like crazy, the sound is loud It's a bit big; the water in the room has to be left for a long time (I can't bear to waste water) to get warm. At first I thought the hotel didn't provide hot water! The service is also very good. I didn't encounter the situation that other reviews mentioned that extra drinking water was not given. Finally, there is a problem with the fixed position of the shower. As long as the water is turned on, it can only face in one direction. In each direction, there is a glass door, and there is no place for people to stand. It doesn't matter if you adjust it, the strength of the water flow will automatically turn in that direction. This requires the engineering depar**ent to adjust the method of fixing the shower head. Please see my picture. Thanks!

msg:Transportation: Relatively remote, but close to the university town, with a short shuttle bus ride from the hotel and one subway stop. But short barges are not always available.

Facilities: New hotel, fully intelligent hotel switches, curtains. Bring a river-view bathtub so you can take a bath and enjoy the scenery. The infinity swimming pool on the rooftop faces Sun Yat-sen University. The huge balcony is also a highlight, with Canton Tower in the distance. It's just that the hot water system is not very good and needs to be turned on for half an hour to warm the dishes.

Environment: Located on an island, it’s great for jogging. The running track is along the river, so you can breathe in oxygen and enjoy the scenery, making running easy.

Service: As a five-star hotel, it is lacking. First of all, there are not enough supplies, and there are no quilts for extra beds. The doorman also didn't offer to help with the boxes. The service staff didn't take the initiative to say hello. There is still a big gap between it and the previous xx hotel! Need to refuel

Catering: The breakfast is very rich, but there is almost nothing around. Takeout is almost impossible during the New Year, and the hotel is very expensive.

The balcony is super large, and the room is also super large. You can hang clothes on the balcony after washing. It is really suitable for bringing children. The only drawback is that the rooftop swimming pool is open-air. Guangzhou is still a bit cold in February. The hotel has a Chimelong bus and a bus to the subway station. I will come again next time.

It really pays attention to the guest experience and all depar**ents are very professional and attentive. 1. There was a lot of luggage, and the welcoming security guard helped push it to the lobby. As soon as he left, the intercom called the security guard, explaining that he saw that the guest had more luggage to help him, so he was not off duty. 2. Mr. Huang in the front office answered every question very patiently and enthusiastically, explained in detail the different experiences of room types with different orientations, and recommended the most suitable room. Finally, he forgot to get his ID card and he hurriedly caught up to deliver it, handing it over with both hands. Details highlight quality service. 3. Just in time for the New Year, there are also exquisite dessert surprises to satisfy your taste buds. 4. The room is exactly the same as the official photo, very a**ospheric and comfortable. 5. The view is very good, you can see all the landmarks of Guangzhou, watch the sunset, admire the bright lights, and rent bicycles for riding.

He was proactive and upgraded the rooms and also provided some compensation. The problem was handled properly and satisfactorily. As a northerner, when you go to the south, you will feel a little cold without heating. The hotel also very considerately sent electric heaters to our three rooms, which warmed us up instantly. We stayed one more night, and there were no problems on the second night. The room was very big, and the appearance and scenery were very good. It was very bright and spacious. The room also had a balcony. It was quite comfortable to live in it. Produced by a Chinese restaurant Not bad, recommended. It is hoped that after the epidemic, hotels will pay more attention to hygiene and cleaning standards and procedures.

msg:Worth the stay.
- Location: The area is unique on the biological island. It has a very quiet, comfortable and beautiful environment. You can also take a leisurely stroll on the island.
- The hotel has a unique design style, with light colors, elegant and warm. Every space and room is spacious and bright, and the overall comfort is very comfortable. The swimming pool and landscape on the 18th floor are also very good, but the swimming pool water is too cold in winter.
- My favorite part of the room is the extra-long and spacious terrace design, which has a wide view. The facilities in the room are basically complete. The bedding is ten comfortable and you can enjoy a rest comfortably in the room (but the menu in the room can be designed and placed more clearly). I just folded it and put it next to the phone, almost opened it after I left; in addition, the bathroom in the room did have an odor, but the bathroom in the hall had no smell. It would be better if it could be improved)
- The most praiseworthy service is Mr. Ashin Huang who checked in (the font was a little small at the time, I hope the English name is correct). He was meticulous and thoughtful, made room upgrades and postponements according to the situation at the time, and carefully asked about the direction of the room. His expression and voice made the guests feel happy. Comfort is valued
The minor incident that occurred later was also properly handled, thank you.

The beauty of the tranquility, the overflowing fragrance of tea, the quietly blooming flower trees... you can I don’t feel tired even if I don’t go out all day long. I really like the service of WingWing, the guest service director in the front office. I feel like a good friend with a sense of proportion. I am always there when you need me. I won't disturb you when you want to be alone. Will come next time! This smells great!

The executive lounge on the 18th floor of the hotel gives guests a quiet and noble feeling. The dinner is refined and nutritious, and the breakfast is rich, both Chinese and Western. It is very suitable for business trips and quiet enjoyment without being noisy by many people dining together.

msg:I was attracted to the hotel after I saw it advertised on the Internet as a hotel without right angles. The decoration and overall decoration of the hotel are really good. It can be seen that a lot of money and thought were spent on the design. When I checked in, I heard the phone ringing non-stop. The front desk was checking in. The person who checked me in looked like a manager and asked me if I could answer the phone. I agreed. He answered three calls in total. Although it looked like I can tell that he acted very quickly, but it definitely affected my check-in time and experience. I have stayed in many other five-star hotels, including Four Seasons, Mandarin, and Shangri-La. Generally, no waiters answer the phone in front of guests during check-in, which feels very rude. Listening to him answer the phone and repeat the trivial matters of how many bottles of water are needed in the room and reservations in the restaurant. This is like the front desk of a small hotel with 50 rooms or a small hotel like the All Seasons. He kept saying sorry to me and upgraded my room. I heard from the waiter that the hotel has been open for more than a year, but the carpets and some maintenance in the room feel like a hotel that has been open for more than 5 years. The balcony of the room is large and has a good view, which is rare in Guangzhou. The supplies are quite standard and on par with most five-star hotels. After checking in, I called to ask if takeout could be delivered to my room. I called twice before I got the call, and it seemed like the manager answered the phone. If something urgent happens, you will probably have to wait if you want to call. The bathroom door in the room closed so loudly that it felt like the glass would break when going to the toilet. Breakfast quality was good, but the floor was a bit sticky.

Because it is very new, the hotel room facilities are very complete, far exceeding those of traditional five-star hotels.
The hotel gave me a free upgrade when I checked in, and I could overlook the night lights of Guangzhou.
Because we are driving by car, the hotel is relatively convenient to enter and exit, and it is next to the University Town and Huangpu Ancient Port. It’s very convenient for eating, shopping and traveling.
It's a good choice and the price is very reasonable. It's worth recommending.
It’s a pity that I didn’t take photos of the hotel. I’ll take some photos of the surrounding breakfast and Whampoa Military Academy.

msg:Overall, a very cost-effective hotel

Facilities: The facilities are basically very environmentally friendly. There are many smart homes. The bedding and slippers are made of good materials. The only drawback is the bathroom. I would like to make some suggestions. The shower faucet and other hardware are of poor quality, and the sink faucet is short, making it inconvenient to wash hands. The shower head leaked badly and could not be fixed. The waterproof *****s on the doors of the shower room and bathroom make serious noises. It is recommended that they be replaced. The doors rebound strongly at night and may wake the children.

Hygiene: Carpets, beds, bathrooms, and toilets are all tidy, hygienic, and clean.

Environment: The most noteworthy thing about this hotel is the environment. The surrounding environment is very suitable for morning jogging and walking. It is very comfortable and quiet at night. The hotel lobby and swimming pool are very good points. The environment is definitely a perfect score.

Service: To be honest, the service is a bit disappointing. I was given a room card for one day in my room for two days. At night, I had to go to the front desk to swipe my room card with my child in my arms. The robot provided was also unusable. I ran to the third floor at night to get takeout, and then used the elevator to get it from the express locker on the first floor. If you are a woman, I don’t think you can go out alone to get it at night. The service hopes to be improved.

The hotel is located on a biological island, just when the temperature in Guangzhou is cooling down. It is very comfortable to go to the island at night, with quiet air and good air. The room is large, the decoration is simple, and the functional partitions are also reasonable. The suite's living room, bedroom, and bathroom all face river views. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and I fell asleep immediately. Bath salts are provided in the bathtub. The only drawback is that it has been cold recently and the air conditioner in the bedroom is not very effective in regulating heat. If you are not in a hurry, cycling around the biological island is very nice, and I will go there next time.

First of all, praise: 1. First of all, the ordinary rooms are not small, and they are all equipped with bathtubs and balconies. The front desk helped upgrade the river view suite to make the space more comfortable.
2. The river view is beautiful, you can see the Pearl River and Guangzhou landmarks from the room. The public swimming pool and gym are also beautiful! It should be the most beautiful in Guangzhou, no kidding!
3. Big big! The entire hotel is not just the rooms, but the entire public area is large, with a large parking lot, a large square, a large reception hall on the first floor, and a large lobby. It is really a space that makes other hotels jealous.
4. Bulgari for spare parts, the whole room is very comfortable, and the software and hardware are really good.
5. Cheap! Relatively speaking, this hotel is much cheaper than the five-star hotels in the city.
Imperfect: 1. The hygiene under the curtain next to the bathtub is very poor...need to pay attention. 2. The gym and swimming pool service needs to be improved. After looking for a long time, no one showed me the key to the locker.
Overall, it is still worth recommending!

I was asked to take my two children to the so-called children's center on the fifth floor. The fifth floor was reserved and there was nothing to do and there was nothing to do. It is a chargeable item. 2. Finally, after 5 o'clock, I went to the front desk and got the room card. When I got to the room, I saw that the cleanliness was terrible. There were still various unknown liquids and hair from the previous tenant on the dressing table. It was so disgusting that I stopped taking pictures. The front desk was asked to clean again, and other public spaces were also very dirty. The two children ran on the carpet barefoot for a while, and the soles of their feet were completely black. No one even said sorry during the whole process. 3. I have two children and wanted to have an extra quilt, but I was told that there wasn’t one. 4. If I want to send two more bottles of water, I was told that only two bottles are free, and the extra bottle is 5 yuan. 5. I asked for a clothes hanger and waited for a long time as shown in the picture. 6. When the front desk checked in but no room was available, she didn't apologize at all and looked very ugly, as if I owed her money.
For a five-star hotel to be like this, I have gained a lot of experience after traveling all over the country for more than ten years. I sincerely advise you to quit.

But the management really needs improvement, many details are not in place, and the concept is still much worse than international star hotels:
The most basic thing is that the time and date on the hotel elevator adverti*****t are wrong.
Hotel water and mineral water will be charged if more than four bottles per room are used
Children's Play World seems to have a lot of staff, but there is not much work to be done, and the package is coupon-based, so most of the staff don't know what's going on.
The infinity swimming pool and the changing room are too far away. There is no one to assist children when changing into the changing room alone. Not all wardrobe slippers in the dressing room are available, which makes it difficult to find a pair of slippers and go to the front desk to change the key.
I hope there will be improvements next time I check in.

The hotel's swimming pool is very big and very good, and maybe because there are few people, the water quality is very good. It is the best swimming pool I have ever visited in a five-star hotel.

The room is large and hygienic, with thoughtful details and an oversized balcony. It is a good place to relax during a vacation. You can have an unobstructed view of the Pearl River and Guangzhou landmarks and other buildings. The hotel's infinity river-view swimming pool is beautiful, the water is very clean, and the pool service staff are very responsible.

msg:This Saturday I saw on Ctrip that the Xianglan Guanzhou Hotel’s package package was relatively cost-effective, so my husband and I came over for a vacation. The package package included one afternoon tea and two breakfasts. The lunch buffet cost 148 per person. Let’s talk about service first. , very good, very good. When I went to check in, I casually said that I thought the view of my waist was pretty good. The manager on duty that day helped me find it for a long time. He showed how serious he was about his work. This is the first time I encountered it. For the lunch buffet, the ingredients are very fresh, but there are not many varieties. If you really don’t have anything to eat, you can consider it. The swimming pool is on the 18th floor. The water quality is super clean. I don’t need to wash my swimsuit for the first time. Yes, the bad thing is that the air conditioner is centrally controlled. I felt very cold as soon as I entered the room. I couldn't adjust it no matter what I did. I had to call the front desk and make sure to open the balcony door before the room temperature could come up. Overall, it was worth it. , if you want to relax on the weekend and don’t want to go too far, you can consider it. If you choose public transportation, go directly to Guanzhou Station on Line 4. There is a shuttle bus. The boarding point is at the bus stop opposite Exit B. For the timetable, see the picture below

msg:Amazing results from a short trip. Because you need to swipe to Guangzhou University City to punch in the city, I accidentally swipe to this hotel. It looks like a sci-fi island. The shape and interior decoration of the building are like being in a sci-fi story. The quality of the service staff is very high. After the epidemic, the quality of StarWorld Hotel's service and service staff has generally declined, but the quality of the hotel's service staff is really high. The interior decoration is full of details. The owner of the hotel should be the ultimate in detail control. Pay tribute to us for bringing us such a good stay experience. The room is also very large, with a sense of detachment from being completely outside of Guangzhou. Because it is an outlying island, the scenery at 6:00 in the morning is really profitable. The hotel is like a ship sailing towards dreams and glory.

From the front desk to the greeting staff, they are all great! And the scenery and air are very good! There are parks nearby! The food is good! Although there are not many styles, it is enough! And there is an infinity pool that is very beautiful!
Disadvantages: The electric kettle is a bit tricky! It is a direct heating type that needs to be plugged in with bottled mineral water to use it! And only two bottles of water are gone! ! Then there is the geographical location and transportation, except for taking a taxi, it is still a bit far away if you have to go out! Although there is a free shuttle bus to the subway station! But there are not many flights! It may be due to the number of guests! Then there is the infinity pool! Maybe because it saves electricity! It's not thermostat now! In addition to going in the afternoon is better! Other times the water temperature is very cold! And it's very windy because it's on the 18th floor!
I hope that next time I bring the elderly to experience it, I can also feel satisfied! !

After leaving it for half an hour, I turned on 3 taps before the hot water was available. I washed it successfully. I caught a cold after bathing twice. The air conditioner was 30 degrees Celsius and the room was only 21 degrees Celsius one night. I really admire the management of this hotel. I sent a hygienist to check it out. Warm water is called hot water. You can make your own decision.

The room is spacious, the location is on an island, the balcony view is particularly good, and the view is wide. Separate bathroom and powder room. The hair dryer is good, and the black technology dries really fast!
The more embarrassing things are: 1. The bright button at the head of the bed will open the bathroom curtains together; 2. The bathroom curtains are poorly shaded, and the sliding door does not shade, which makes the bedroom very bright during the day. 3. The drainage in the bathroom is very poor, and the water overflows out after taking a bath for ten minutes. 4. The lighting of the dressing table is dim and poorly designed.
5. The most troublesome thing is that customers need to go around and go to the first floor to get the takeaway. There is no waiter or robot to deliver it.

The decoration is very nice, it feels like your own home, very modern. You can see the river view from the oversized balcony, and take first-class photos. Each of the twin beds is 1.5 meters, enough to sleep. The hardware equipment is very new, the water flow is strong, the hot water comes out quickly, and the bathtub looks very clean. It may be because the hotel has not been built for a long time. Children are very happy to play in it. 👍🏻The most important thing is that there are so many plugs! ! Very humane! Just two steps away is a socket, don't worry about not having enough space to charge! Afternoon tea and breakfast have river views, which is not bad. Breakfast is ok.
Disadvantages: The service as a whole is okay, but it can be more detailed. For example, no one answered the front desk service calls from time to time, and the waiters were slow to deliver things. In addition, I first praised me for adding two quilts, and the front desk agreed, but the waiter said that there was no time when they delivered them, and asked us to put the quilt core into the quilt cover by ourselves. Well, it’s okay to pretend, but it would be better if they pretended, haha.
Praise and thank the butlers Zoey and Billy, and come again next time.

1. The room is large and bright, enough for my sister to run around in it without getting bored. Plus we prepared a box of toys, so she is quite happy and comfortable!
2. There are two 1.5-meter beds. My sister also gave us two baby crib bumpers for her bed, which was very considerate. The old mother can sleep peacefully without being anxious. My father and I sleep comfortably with a baby.
3. With a large balcony, we were upgraded to a high-rise room for free. The view of the Pearl River is very pleasant day and night, but the temperature outside is too hot to enjoy.
4. I am very satisfied with other health and services.

Next time you come, you can avoid the trap and come here directly!

I asked him to contact the front desk, but he said there was no front desk contact information. The takeaway I ordered could not be delivered for an hour.

Let’s talk about the minefield:
The check-in experience was really bad! I should have stayed in no less than 20 hotels in China this year, an unprecedented experience.
When I arrived at the hotel at 12:30, I was told that the house had not been cleaned. After putting down my luggage, I came back to check in before 4 o'clock. When I made the room card, the registration information for the first time was wrong. The elevator could not be scanned up. I took it to the front desk and redone it. OK, it still worked the second time. Question, does the weather in Guangzhou require people to do a return run?

Finally, I was able to swipe the room card. When I got upstairs, I scanned the room and there was rubbish everywhere. The bed was not made and the toilet was not flushed. I called the front desk and it said that the card information was entered incorrectly. I want to know how bad this SOP must be to cause problems repeatedly.

In addition, during the problem-solving process, all the service staff looked cold. I really felt like I was begging you to check in;

I hope this review can be of reference value to travelers, and I also hope that I am the only one who has made a mistake.

The hotel is very new, every detail switch is smart, the room is very big, sleep is very good, because it is very quiet at night. The bed was also very comfortable. The housekeepers Xiao Zhu and Xiao Wu are very nice, they speak very gentle and considerate, and they will come to see them next time.

msg:The hotel is very new. It can be seen that the designer puts his heart into the design, and details can be deducted. As a designer, it is worth learning to stay in such a hotel. The environment is naturally nothing to say. How to say about the service, the rules and regulations are serious, the low-level personnel have no authority, and the flexibility is not enough, so they rent a bicycle, the deposit machine is out of power, and they find that the network is not working when they change it. Then I proposed to use the ID card, but said no, there are regulations. Then the restaurant on the fourth floor has a very good environment, and you can see the small waist, but what is more annoying is that the tea table fee is very unreasonable, and children are charged. First, children do not drink tea for dinner, so we bring it ourselves We think it’s okay for adults to charge for water, but for children, it’s not okay to negotiate half the price, saying that there is no authority. The constant temperature of the swimming pool is not turned on, and the temperature on the island is not high, so it is impossible to swim. As a five-star hotel, the constant temperature of the swimming pool is not turned on. What is the meaning of the invariable swimming pool? Breakfast, how should I put it, there are relatively few types and the taste is average. Because I checked in on Monday, I got a free upgrade to the next room. This is worthy of recognition, after all, no one stays on Monday. Generally, family tourists may seldom come here, and there must be more business, and it is relatively remote, and the transportation is inconvenient. We chose this hotel because Chimelong didn't have a good rest and found a hotel with a quiet environment and a good environment. The sanitation is generally clean, but the details still need to be improved. There are no entertainment facilities for children. But the restaurant on the fourth floor, the dinner tastes good, you can try it, but everyone knows the price. This is a five-star hotel. I think the restaurant tastes really good.

I live on the 16th floor. I went up and saw an open door. It was so scary.

The bathroom hygiene in the room is very average. There are mold spots on the floor.

msg:I stayed in Xianglan Guanzhou for two nights during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and it felt very good
Record from the room to the hotel facilities:
[Room] We booked a river view double bed room, and it was a surprise that it was less than 700 yuan a night during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. The room is very open and comfortable, and the air conditioner is enough for the mattress to be soft. I finally adjusted it to 27° hahahaha. There are plenty of plugs, USB, etc., and it feels like charging can be done in any corner of the room.
[Balcony] I really like the big balcony, looking at the river view and my alma mater Sun Yat-Sen University, the chairs on the balcony are so comfortable, it's perfect to have a drink and a snack here at night, but it's not enough to have only one deck chair
[Bathroom] Automatic toilet, the toilet seat is warm and comfortable. The washing brand I use is Miller Harris. It has a plant fragrance. I don’t like this fragrance. It’s just a personal aesthetic and has nothing to do with quality.
[Bathroom] There is a small chair, which is friendly to the elderly and children
[cloakroom] ironing board, complete hangers, comfortable space
[Bar counter] There are plenty of bottled water, all of which are pure joy. It's very good for me, a big water drinker. Two wine glasses, two coffee cups and two glass drinking glasses. Served with chali tea bags and Nescafe. Even if I bring my own coffee, I like tea bags, but there is no wine opener
[Swimming pool] The famous infinity swimming pool, but this is not the point, the point is that the water is very clear, I rarely see hair, it seems that the rule of wearing a swimming cap is really necessary, just imagine that the water is full of hair. uncomfortable ah! Watching my alma mater swim again, comfortable, the deepest depth is 1.6 meters, and the depth setting is reasonable
[Gym] Very spacious, with a good view, overlooking the river, and a balcony. In the morning, I went for a run to do some strength. The fly in the ointment is that I didn't pull down the frame, and I was not good at practicing my back.
[Buffet] Dianping 148 people, the food types and products match the price.


Speaking of disadvantages:
The bathroom mirror light ***** is broken? Or is the circle of lights not going to come on at all?
The buffer glue of the bathroom door and the toilet door in the bathroom is very hard. When using the door, if you accidentally miss it, it will hit very loudly. I don't like it.


Overall, I was very happy to stay here for two nights. It was a very good experience and holiday, thank you hotel.

The disadvantage may be that there are too many people, and the six elevators have been waiting for a long time. And the buffet is not very tasty.

msg:The hotel is located in the eastern corner of Guangzhou Biological Island. The environment and location are particularly good. The balcony of the hotel room is spacious. The rooms facing north can directly see the Guangzhou Tower of Zhujiang New Town, and the view is also first-class. As a standard horizontal comparison of high-end hotels, the rooms are spacious and clean, the bathroom hardware facilities are slightly inferior, the quality of the lamps, especially the reading lights at the head of the bed, is worrying, the temperature of the hot water outlet in the hotel is unstable, and the temperature is not high enough. Fortunately, Guangzhou has entered the rhythm of summer , but definitely not in winter. The toilet uses an electric toilet, but it may be that the brand is relatively average, and the use experience is also average. I would like to talk about the management and service of the hotel. The reason why the hotel is relatively new may be that the management team has not yet worked together well. The service and management are average. First of all, as mentioned above, the reading light was not checked before the guests checked in. The light was broken. The problem was that it was still broken after calling the engineering depar**ent to repair it. The hotel did not give feedback in time, and wasted nearly an hour. time. At the same time, the maintenance personnel entered the room for maintenance, wearing work shoes without changing the shoe covers, which made people feel unprofessional. In the end, the conclusion of the communication was to cut off the power supply of the reading light. We don’t need it anymore, and we don’t need to change the room. Unfortunately, it was once again revealed that the hotel’s internal management mechanism is not good, and the depar**ents are not connected properly. Early in the morning, I was in a state of collapse, before I woke up at seven o'clock, the hotel attendant rang the doorbell and knocked on the door, asking why there was someone in the room, and at the same time there was a phone call to ask, and not long after, another attendant came to the door and rang the doorbell. Seriously interfere with the stay and rest experience and the planned time rhythm! After the complaint, the hotel was still slow to respond. The state-owned enterprise routine, reported to the leader to wait for the leader's feedback, and did not give any explanation until the check-out and leaving the hotel. This is the way to deal with it!
What is worthy of recognition is that during the process, the Ctrip platform has been following up and coordinating. In this regard, Ctrip is still quite reliable. Of course, in the end, the hotel may be pressured by the platform, and a manager took the initiative to contact me and gave me preferential policies and service guarantees for the next stay, but these are things for the future.

The second feeling is that the room is relatively large and comfortable.
But one thing to complain about is that the swimming pool of the hotel was outsourced to an organization for activities on the day of check-in. The whole swimming pool was playing loud nightclub music, and it was impossible to play normally in it! Very seriously affect the use and experience of the guests! ! ~

1. It took 15 minutes for the shower head to run cold water before hot water came out. The front desk said it was due to the floor, which was normal. In such a beautifully decorated hotel, I had to stand in the bathroom for more than ten minutes before I could get hot water. It was outrageous. Nowadays, even a three-star hotel wouldn't take so long to get hot water. (To be precise, the water will be warm after leaving it for fifteen minutes, and it will take twenty minutes to reach a suitable temperature for bathing)
2. The front desk threatened me that I would be fined if I checked out one minute late. This attitude is absolutely amazing.
3. The parking lot stinks.
4. The parking lot security attitude is extremely poor. Roar and roar.
I'm really impressed. This hotel has nothing but beautiful decoration. Don't come here and suffer.

msg:The worst five star hotel I have ever stayed in! ! ! I'm surprised how they managed to make the hotel so bad. It's a very high standard for it to be so bad.
First of all, the formaldehyde in the hotel is definitely not up to standard. The room still has a strong smell of formaldehyde. During the National Day, I brought my children with me. Since I checked in at night, I could only stay with my children for one night in fear.
Secondly, I reported to the front desk that the hotel room smelled heavy of formaldehyde, and the waiter asked me what I wanted? I asked them to get an air freshener and purifier. The waiter was very impatient and told me rudely that they didn't have one and told me to report it to the manager. Anyway, no one dealt with it until check-out.
Thirdly, the hot water in the room only has two options: super hot and cold water. It takes ten minutes to adjust the water temperature before it responds. It will either burn you to death or freeze to death.
I called the staff to ask for a plastic bag. I made three calls and waited for more than half an hour. The waiter was still very impatient and said that the hotel did not have plastic bags.
To get dry towels at the swimming pool, you need to go down a level to get them.
I lamented how they could make the hotel service industry so strong. How did they do it?

msg:In order to avoid traffic jams during the short holiday, I specifically chose this hotel close to my doorstep to hide away for two days, because the environment on the biological island is relatively quiet, but staying for two nights also made our family crazy for two nights:
1. The bathroom smells like urine and is unspeakably stinky;
2. There was a sewage odor in the bathroom, and the whole room was filled with a sewage smell. The staff came to deal with it and sprayed air freshener, but the smell was still there. The air freshener caused the nose of the child with rhinitis to become clogged;
3. The air conditioning control switch is like a fake. There is no difference between 18 degrees and 28 degrees. We are always shivering from the cold. The smell and cold can only make us sleep with the balcony door open.
I don’t know if these problems are left over from the early stages of the hotel’s renovation or what, but they have indeed damaged the hotel’s image. I hope the current management depar**ent will take notice!

msg:The experience of staying in a five-star hotel is really bad. After successfully making a reservation half a month in advance, I called and was told that there was no room. Later, I made a complaint and the platform resolved it and made a new reservation. The price for two nights booked directly on Ctrip was more than 5,000. But it’s just that the reservation was not paid. Before and after the check-in at the hotel, the front desk clearly told the offline direct payment of 3,000 for 2 nights, and then 500 as a deposit. At that time, I wondered why the price was cheap. I confirmed to the front desk staff that the answer was this price. , with colleagues and colleagues, the price of housing is the same as ours, so the doubts are dispelled. After staying for two nights and checking out, another set of words came up, saying that 3000 is just a deposit, saying that we only booked for one night...,, if the price for one night is expensive, why didn't the hotel notify the second night and add the fee instead It’s the same thing after check-out. Besides, colleagues in the same company check in at the same time for two nights. The same room type is booked on the same day. After check-out, they are told that there is a price difference of more than 2,000. The most ridiculous so-called leader is actually Threatening to change the price of our companions to be as high as ours if this is the case
1. From the perspective of consumers, it is difficult for normal people to accept the difference of more than 2,000 rooms booked at the same time as colleagues.
2. Even if the booking platform is different, so the price is different, the price set by the hotel staff we are traveling with is based on the platform booking, and we can accept it directly when we check in, instead of blindly thinking that we are amnesiac. we brainwash
3 Your hotel has not been open for a long time, and we can understand that the work system is immature. If we explain it with a good attitude from the beginning, we will not be so angry, instead of talking about the platform blindly, thinking that we are greedy for small things
In conclusion, it is inconvenient to take a taxi to go out, wait for half an hour, even the local driver said that it is not worth living there at this price, more than 2000 a night so far 🙂 The facilities are complete, but they are useless, and the swimming pool has no water 🙂
The experience of a five-star hotel is really bad, especially the so-called female leader, I can't express it in words... The design of the hotel is still good, but everyone must take pictures with their mobile phones when checking in, otherwise when checking out Here comes another set 🙂

The front desk and the welcome staff can't talk about service. They feel like they are in an independent world. They just deal with customers and leave. Not to mention taking luggage for guests. The highlight is that the breakfast service staff is very friendly, because we got up late, and the child slept late, and it was almost 10 o'clock when we arrived at the restaurant. We told the service staff, and the service boy warmly brought me a lunch box, and then brought some for the child . This is very touching. Miss a meal, there's really nothing to eat on this island.
The environment is quiet, 3 minutes' drive from the subway, the hotel does not have a shuttle bus or convenient service, it depends on the customer to call the car. This is a bad review.
Both merits and demerits, the room is really big, and the sound insulation is good, so there are probably few guests. Especially the balcony for watching the scenery is more comfortable, it is good to have a cup of tea and chat. It is suitable for guests who are on vacation and who love to watch the scenery.

It may be that there are few people on New Year's Eve, the front desk service is very good, and they helped to upgrade the executive suite. The environment is nice and quiet, the room is very large, the wide balcony has an excellent view, and you can have a panoramic view of the river.

🏨Hotel: Guangzhou Xianglan Guanzhou Hotel

📍Address: Biological Island, Huangpu District, the island has a beautiful environment, comfortable and quiet, very suitable for vacation🏖

🅿️Parking: Parking is free in the hotel parking lot, and there is a charging pile on the negative side. Guests who drive new energy vehicles can stay at ease and let their cars be fully charged.

🛏Room facilities: The room is very large, about 100 square meters, equipped with a cloakroom, and a separate dressing table, the bathroom is also large, and there is a drop-shaped large bathtub 🛁, the invincible river view outside the window, taking a bath 🛀 enjoying the view is very pleasant . The separate living room is really homey for a family to sit around and watch the Spring Festival Gala. The super-large viewing terrace is lit up at night, and you can see the Canton Tower CBD from afar. It is perfect for leisure and vacation!


🍽Food recommendation: The breakfast is very rich, and children like German sausages the most. It would be even better if the breakfast time can be extended to 10:30 and 11:00!


👍 Most recommended:
There is an infinity pool on the top floor, you must check in! Can make great movies

There is a greenway around the island downstairs, you can go downstairs for a walk when you get up early, the air is fresh, and you can take a walk at night, nice

The ink painting garden is near the hotel, within walking distance, free admission, a good place to walk your baby.

There is also a university town around the biological island, and the Lingnan Cultural Park is also highly recommended. Lingnan architectural complex and many children's amu*****t facilities are very suitable for parents and children.

In terms of dining, there are in the hotel, of course the price is not cheap, if you order takeaway. It cannot be sent upstairs. Food delivery robots are also broken. The phone at the front desk is not working, so I have to go down and get it myself.
The internal facilities give a very bad review to the shower area and toilet area! There is no switch prompt for the shower switch; moreover, the switch to turn on the hot water is broken. Because I think that a star hotel should not be bad in this regard. Otherwise, change the room early. The smart sensor in the toilet is tasteless. Can't rush away! Let's talk about the heating and cooling air conditioner, the noise is unbearable unless it is turned on to the minimum or turned off. If you are a light sleeper, don't choose this place. And hotel supplies! The dandruff is ethereal, I don't know how to deal with it, it's all white floating. If you are allergic to catkins, it is recommended to check out. Otherwise, don't sleep if you sneeze all night.
When you wake up, you can watch the sunrise with the curtains open. The environment is full marks for this place. but! Under the sun, the carpets are yellow, and the bathroom is yellow. See the light to die. Hygienic dead ends are absolutely impossible, I can't stand these problems. I won’t post the pictures, but the one above is the river view.

After checking in, I forgot to take two bags. When my husband asked, no one paid attention. When checking out, it was still the same person who checked in (long hair and glasses, female), with the same indifferent attitude and distracted spirit! Including the staff who asked us to move the car, they also had no basic qualities to serve customers. 3. The air conditioner in the room was too small in the first gear, and too noisy in the second gear. It was really terrible. I kept hearing the whirring of the air outlet when I slept at night; 4. The curtains next to the bathtub were also a **. I had to press the switch several times before it responded; 5. The bathroom was so smelly!!! The floor drain stinks! You have to hold your breath when you go to the toilet! The door of this toilet is also designed by a talented person. No matter how hard you control the force when closing the door, the door will slam when it closes. There is no soft rubber anti-collision ***** on the side of your door, and it directly hits the door frame! ! ! 6. The water outlet of the shower is too sparse, resulting in a strong water flow. The water splashes all over your body and it hurts! This hotel even has a temper with the shower! If the water valve is slightly off, the top spray will teach you a lesson immediately! Your facilities require too much precision in the movements of customers! Why don't you put these requirements on yourself? ? ? For example, the staff in the lobby! 7. The doukou cup is the kind that costs one dollar each, and the mouth of the cup is a curved notch. Which side do you want me to put my mouth on? 8. The bathrobe is as rough as sandpaper! 9. There is a movable window on the ceiling of the room, which is covered with handprints and stains.
Barely considered an advantage: I had a buffet dinner and breakfast in the Chinese restaurant downstairs. In comparison, the service here is very good. The dishes are just normal.
Summary: Hold on to your wallet and don’t stay unless necessary!

The room has not been lived in for a long time, and the cleaning is very sloppy. The carpet is full of fluff, the back of the bed is also dirty, the paper towels are black when wiped, and the balcony is even dirtier. Yes, stepping on it is a footprint, and the glass has not been cleaned for a long time and is very dirty.

msg:The experience is so bad that I really need to expose it to the contributing media. A hotel with a superficial appearance, the hardware facilities in the room, and the quality and attitude of the waiters are not good. It is not as good as a fast hotel, which simply ruined my entire Spring Festival trip.
Stayed for three nights and changed 3 rooms. First of all, the hot water in the first room was broken, and the front desk did not answer calls at night. The next day I went to the front desk to communicate face-to-face, the front desk did a few perfunctory words and didn’t even say an apology, but when I returned to the hotel at 9:30 p.m., it still hadn’t been repaired, so I waited for nearly an hour, and the master repaired it until 10:30 p.m. In order to tell me that the repair is not good, let me change a room. Then I waited at the front desk for more than half an hour, and told me that several rooms were hot water or the air conditioner was broken, and finally upgraded me to a suite, but the air conditioner was still broken when I went in, and the curtains of the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bathroom could not be closed ( Opposite is the university town, you can see clearly when you turn on the light and take a shower at night.) Then the hot water is still hot and cold, the manager explained that the hot water supply is insufficient because the room is full. I really don't understand how a five-star hotel can't even have enough hot water supply, and didn't consider the demand for full rooms when designing it? ? And in the middle of the night, you made me wait at the front desk for 45 minutes and looked at 3 rooms, but the air conditioners were all broken? ? Outrageous? !

msg:This is my first time to give a negative review. The hotel has a great sense of design, but the service, software and hardware are not up to par!

First of all, I don’t know if it was because of the group purchase package that I was given a poor end room. There was a problem with the air conditioning and there were obvious stains on the floor. The room was seriously inconsistent with the reservation picture! The staff also acknowledged this

Secondly, the room is not cheap and costs more than 1,000 yuan. The afternoon tea package has a price difference of 100 yuan on weekends, but it only gives two cups of coffee and two mini snacks. It is completely different from what is written in the group purchase and the photo of the dessert tower posted in the post. And it tastes worse than outside coffee shops

Later, after negotiation, I was changed to the room type that I wanted to book after seeing the pictures. However, the air conditioner still didn't work. I turned it on to 18 degrees and woke up from the heat in the middle of the night. The weather in Guangzhou is really terrible.

In summary, I have stayed in many five-star hotels that cost more than 1,000 yuan. In addition to design, software, service attitude, and manpower, they are far superior to this one. The experience is very bad!

On the other side, you can see the university town, the view is amazing! The design of the room has no corners and all arcs, reflecting a sense of comfort and security. The bathtub is like a half boat and half a water droplet. The hanging pictures also have different characteristics in each room. The cloakroom is also very good, and there is a special dressing table! The swimming pool is semi-indoor. Maybe the water quality of the swimming pool is not clean enough during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The water temperature of the swimming pool is too cold. The experience is not good. Free parking in the hotel, you can order takeaway! The experience is quite good, and I will choose to stay next time, hoping to improve the problem of the swimming pool!
Check-in is at the lobby on the 3rd floor! Not in the "Welcome Lobby" on the first floor!

msg:Strictly speaking, Biological Island is not a tourist attraction in Guangzhou, so it is quite comfortable and quiet. As the only hotel on the island, its layout is indeed worthy of a five-star hotel.
advantage:
1. The room is large and clean, with a riverside balcony overlooking the Canton Tower, with a first-class view! There is even a dressing table, suitable for young ladies who love to groom themselves
2. The swimming pool is very large, on the 18th floor, swimming while looking at the University City, refreshing
3. The geographical location is superior, there is a greenway when you go out, there is no such disturbance, it is a good choice for those who like cleanliness and outdoor sports

shortcoming:
1. The water in the swimming pool is so cold! Children can't swim for half an hour. Generally, five-star hotels have constant temperature.
2. The locker room is very large, with dry and wet steam room and large bubble pool, but because it is on the next floor, almost no one uses it. I am the only one in the whole locker room, and there is no waiter, so I dare not steam
3. The smart toilet in the room is too bad. It flushed my hair and my back was wet. I was so speechless. . .
4. The environment of Yuewangtai is very good, but the products are mediocre, the tea is not good, and the price is too expensive, probably because there is only this restaurant in the whole biological island. It is recommended to go to the nearby Yingzhou or University City shopping malls for food by car.

Overall, I am quite satisfied and will come again if I have the opportunity.

Originally, the front desk said that there was only one small cake that was enough for one person. I said yes, but I received a 6-inch cake that day The little cake was pleasantly surprised and happy all day long, and the room was decorated very well.
The only downside is that the takeaway can’t be delivered. You have to go to the elevator twice to get to the lobby on the first floor. It’s tiring. I mentioned this when I received a return visit from the hotel service at night. At that time, the hotel told me that I could call the front desk and ask them to deliver it. Ordered take out and called the front desk the next morning and she said they don't have it! Not enough staff? ? ? … Later, I mentioned that the person on the call back at night told me that it was ok, and she said to see if any colleagues were free to pick it up! In the end it was delivered to me. As a new hotel, it is necessary to strengthen communication service training! ! !
There is a lot of dust on the balcony! Other than that it's still great.
The food in the restaurant tastes good, I hope the spa will open next time

msg:Going out on weekends, away from the hustle and bustle, Guanzhou Hotel is still a good choice. There are greenways here for sports, cycling, and unmanned buses. It is really suitable for the whole family to play. But if you want to eat, you have to walk to the subway station, and you can only go to Wanshengwei Station or Pazhou Station. The hotel is newly opened, and the swimming pool is not heated. It is a bit cold when encountering drafts. It just opened, and the towels disinfected by the pool have run out, so they can only be picked up in the locker room. If there are many people on the chairs for rest, family members who do not go swimming can only stand and wait until there is a seat before sitting down. The key to the pool to get the locker needs to be mortgaged with the room card, which is different from other five-star hotels in the city.
       The environment of the room is great, spacious, with a terrace and a river below. There is a rowing team training, and the scenery is open and comfortable. The bed is very comfortable, all white and minimalist, a**ospheric. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is still good. Hope to keep improving and perfecting.

msg:I found this newly opened hotel on the Internet by chance. At the beginning, I found a lot of negative reviews, but I was actually quite concerned about it, after all, the room rate for one night is not low. But its surrounding environment is very good (I like quietness myself), and I can still enjoy the invincible first-line river view by the river. You can also see the sunrise or sunset...
Upstairs, there is an infinity pool on the 18th floor. I thought it was not open this time, so I didn’t have “equipment”. I didn’t know it was open until I arrived, so I regret that I didn’t experience it.
The room is fully intelligent equipment, which feels very good. The only thing about drinking water is that they can only use bottled water with smart kettles. But two bottles are obviously not enough to drink. Later, after I reported to the front desk, 4 bottles were quickly delivered.
The hygienic situation is not as bad as some negative reviews. Of course, if you want to use a magnifying glass to see if there are fingerprints and water marks, there is no way. Everyone likes it.
The sound insulation effect is still good. I can't hear the sound of the TV in the room after I step out of the balcony.
Different people have different opinions on traffic, and backpackers like me can only walk in. It's not far, take the subway for half an hour. The island is very quiet, there are no cars, and the best thing is that there are no electric cars rampaging.
For food and drink, the hotel has a restaurant. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, you can go to McDonald’s and convenience stores to help you when you get out of the subway...
As long as the price does not increase significantly in the future, I will consider going again, the island is so comfortable

The conditions of the swimming pool on the 18th floor and the gymnasium on the 17th floor are comparable to many high-end gyms. The environment of the infinity pool is very good, but the water temperature is a little cold.
Diet: Since the check-in time is Thursday, there is only a western food buffet on weekends, so I only have a taste of breakfast. There are many categories, the taste is very good, and the service attitude is very good.
Brother Liang Zhiqiang at the front desk is very nice. He had a lot of rooms when we checked in, and he helped us choose a big room on the side.
All in all a very good experience.

I couldn’t help it after paying all the money. I thought it was an illusion; when I checked in, there were guests next to me complaining about the poor service of the hotel. Check-in in the lobby feels that this hotel is not good (there are too many five-star hotels), the layout and location indicators of the hotel lobby are not clear, the lobby bar is also very simple, not as good as Samsung; after the check-in procedure, the room is indeed quite big Very comfortable, but the use of water boilers and plastic mouthwash cups shows that hygiene is not good; the hotel is divided into a welcome lobby on the first floor and a hotel lobby on the third floor, and there is no receptionist in the welcome lobby😓. The breakfast buffet the next day was also very poor, and the ingredients were too poor to say. This is the first time I saw that the swimming pool and fitness center of a five-star hotel are open from 10:00 to 19:00. I wanted to try the infinity pool, but there were not many people swimming (because the water was too cold and the temperature was not constant), and it was even more scary to see the locker room. , not a single waiter. Since I don't have the habit of taking pictures, I didn't take pictures one by one and upload them to everyone to share. The design of this hotel is very good. According to news reports, it was originally planned to be managed by a famous five-star hotel management company in Japan, but it is no longer the case. The experience of this stay is so bad that it cannot be described. The service, supporting facilities and food are not good.

The supporting facilities are not up to date, and I feel cheated! The skyline swimming pool recommended in the marketing is completely rescued by the scenery, which is convenient for taking pictures! Because there is no need for a changing room or a footbath to enter the swimming pool, guests can walk to the pool with their shoes on, and then swim directly into the water after taking off their shoes. This is really not as good as public swimming pools, and the most basic sanitation management is not done well, which is really disappointing!

There are two cotton swabs on the side of the mattress, and the carpet has wet water marks. In addition, the service is not as good as that of ordinary express hotels. The two men at the front desk did not have professional language communication, and it felt like they were invited at random without any training. After checking in, I called the front desk and needed an extra set of daily necessities. I waited for more than half an hour and called the second time. It was almost 11:00, and I didn’t answer the phone for the third time. Taiwan, it took ten minutes before someone delivered it. This is a hotel I won't be going back to.

The hotel customer service staff actually said that the engineering department said the occupancy rate, and the air conditioner should be turned on from 17:00 to 21:00. A five-star hotel can make customers swelter for an afternoon for this reason, and not turn on the air conditioner without strong requests. I think the waiter is okay, and provided us with a lot of mineral water. I am very grateful to the waiter for this. The hotel is not very convenient to enter and exit, and it is difficult to find convenience stores and restaurants around. It is difficult to find something to eat when hungry at night. The internal facilities are still good, but not refined enough. The toiletries are not packed in boxes and are scattered on the table. They are not high-end. The room does not provide handbags. The balcony only provides a stool. I don’t know where the other person sits when two people check in. There are still a lot of fruits when checking in, and the bathtub design is also very unique. The surrounding scenery is still very quiet. There are few channels to choose from on TV. It’s really boring to stay. If it weren’t for the new hotel to experience it, I would rather go back to the five-star hotels in Zhujiang New Town or the old city to be more comfortable.

msg:This is a hotel with a relatively 🈶 design sense, showing the Japanese a**osphere of attention to detail everywhere, such as leaving a chair + small coffee table on the large balcony (convenient for smokers), and designing a small platform next to the toilet to put mobile phones and toilets When the cover is turned up, sit on the gasket 🈶 a flush button... In addition, the sense of space is relatively strong (the floor is high), the doors and windows and other materials are thick (🈶 strong sense of stability), the only thing I am not used to is the southern cities like Guangzhou The floor public area and indoor carpet area is too large, and maintenance will be a problem in the future...

msg:The only hotel in Bio Island, the environment is very good, but when the swimming pool, gym and sky bar were not open, I could only live in a room and go to a Chinese restaurant to eat.

The room has a large terrace, which is a selling point. The bathtub can be seen, and the room is very comfortable. The hotel arranged a connecting room for us, and the door in the middle can be opened for interaction. But sometimes the speed of adding toothpaste is a little slow, but the afternoon tea and morning tea are very punctual.

The price of the hotel is not cheap, close to 1,000, which is more expensive than the Intercontinental, and it does not feel very worthwhile.

There are not too many kinds of breakfast but enough, and the products and services are good; 3. , The entrance epidemic prevention inspection is serious, yes; 4. The welcome fruit is not watery, plus points. 4. Sitting on the balcony in the evening, drinking tea and listening to the river breeze, looking north at Xiaoman’s waist showing neon lights; getting up early to watch the sunrise, the smoke waves sweeping the birds, and the rush of morning walkers. Looking back at the sleeping wife and daughter in the room, life is so beautiful, life is so quiet, and this is enough. Stay for another day!

I communicated with Manager Zhu in the front office in advance and booked me a room with a good view. The concierge at the door took the initiative to help me with my luggage. The staff at the front desk are also very polite and enthusiastic. The room has prepared welcome fruit. When I come back in the evening, the room even offers a turndown service, which is very pleasant. The water in the room is Fuss mineral water. It seems that the hotel is very attentive. Although the breakfast is delivered to the room as a package, it tastes good. The room was reserved for my mother. , The night view of the hotel is very good, and the facilities in the room are very smart. Unfortunately, the swimming pool is not yet open.

Before the check-in, the little brother took the initiative to help with the luggage, and the check-in time would not be too long. The room was huge, and it felt like there was no dust at all! The balcony is very large and comfortable, and the view is very comfortable. There are many varieties of fruits and drinks are welcome! The breakfast is now arranged on the fourth floor, the variety is not rich, the service rescues, haha, the waiters and chefs are super polite. It's just that there are still many places that have not been put into use, and there are no games for the time being. The air conditioner in the room is too windy, I hope it can be improved.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel, it was past 5 pm. I actually said that the sanitation of the room was not done well. I asked how long I would have to wait. Then I said I wanted to ask, but I didn’t give me a clear answer after I asked, and then I waited in such an embarrassing way. It took about ten minutes, and finally gave me the room card, and promised to extend the check-out until 2:00 the next day. As a result, when it was almost 1:00 noon the next day, the front desk called me and said that 12:00 was the check-out time. Asked if we were going to check in for an extended stay, I directly questioned whether their internal management was a bit chaotic. Okay, let’s continue to complain. After checking in and going to the room, I found that the air conditioner was broken. The toilet door in the room should have been a sliding door, but it turned out that there was only one side, and the other side was closed! Complete! No! Have! As a result, the toilet cannot be locked. Don't ask me why I know, because I changed the room after 8 o'clock in the evening, and then I realized that the normal toilet door is two doors that open opposite. It's not over yet, the hotel's front desk phone, switchboard phone... almost any call, if there is no answer, or if it is always on the call, then I can only go directly to the front desk to respond to the situation. To sum up, the hardware of the room seems to be high-end, but there are actually many problems, and the software such as services cannot keep up. It is said that it is a trial operation stage. Can these problems be improved after the actual operation?

最讓人氣憤的是：週日是母親節，特地在週六傍晚讓客服幫訂酒店四樓中餐廳週日中午的包房，客服回覆一會餐廳會有人聯繫，到時晚上還回復，後催了客服復説餐廳下班了第二天再回復。週日一早也未有回覆，怕一會沒房一家老小不方便外出餐飲，又繼續催客服，終於中餐廳打電話來説五天前就訂滿了，那為何不早點復客人好做其他打算。又説大廳有大台，但不能訂位，必須先到先得，或是現在下去坐着佔座，這時是10點半，我有病嗎去坐到中午，酒店套房客人連這點點優先都沒有？一副我就是這規定的口氣，真是糟心的經歷，不可能再光顧了，這還是洲際集團的酒店，真不知道怎麼排上的。

入駐第二天，打電話給前台説能不能多送幾瓶水？前台説，我們一個房間衹有三瓶水，多送需要給錢哦，我説第一次遇到五星級酒店拿幾瓶水要強調收費的，接電話的女士説看你是攜程黑鑽，可以送你兩瓶，敢情攜程黑鑽在香嵐官洲衹值2瓶水，誰稀罕，直接買了一箱自己帶到房間。
後期因為裝東西需要幾個酒店紙袋，又打電話給前台，又是一位女士接的電話，答覆我們一位客人衹能送2個紙袋，多送的要付錢。我説酒店按理説不都應該在衣帽間每天放一個紙袋？我之前一個沒用，就當你們每天給我配一個唄，對方答覆我們從來不在房間放紙袋子。
後期直接找攜程投訴，才將五個紙袋子送過來，我第一次遇到前台如此接電話，連一個三星酒店都不如，幾個紙袋子增加你多少成本？
有一説一，此次入住唯一覺得暖心的是胡霜，陳妮兩位客房服務人員，看我住的久還貼心的提供了床頭護手霜，香皂和中號牙膏，以及鮮花，這才是所謂的服務

msg:酒店周邊的景觀是不錯的，設施比較新，但本次入住體驗感並不好，以下幾點，請酒店能夠不斷優化提升：
1、前台辦理入住效率低，下午2點多到店，排隊等前兩位等了20分鐘，帶着孩子非常煩躁；
2、酒店用的燒水壺是飛利浦，操作極其複雜，掃碼操作視頻是空的，最後問服務員要了個常規燒水壺；
3、酒店的燈控非常雞肋，衹有很亮很亮和完全不亮兩種；
4、臨走時，使用了酒店的大堂吧贈飲券，結果用了個破破爛爛的紙杯裝，飲品還沒帶到車庫，4個杯子全爛了水灑了；
5、陽台的椅子和茶几沒有擦洗，一層的灰。

3，微信私人管家形同虛設【跟其他酒店的私人管家比】

        房間很大，景色很美，超適合帶娃度假，清靜悠閑，樓下就是公園，酒店還貼心有單車租賃，非常喜歡房間那個超大陽台，可以看到小蠻腰愜意!
        前台小哥哥服務態度很好，網上雙床沒房了，跟他一説馬上就安排上了，必須點贊!
       另外，客房送餐比下去餐廳吃便宜哦!
要是説缺點的話就是恆温泳池感覺跟常温一樣，水太冷了，更衣室在泳池的下一層比較麻煩。
       車庫上大堂也繞，大堂在三樓，然後大堂上客房要換電梯，感覺有點麻煩!

msg:半年多來不斷在**刷到這家酒店，趁中秋十一假期來試了一下，但卻總體感覺令人失望！三面臨水的地理環境和網紅泳池的確是亮點，裝修風格也有一定的格調，但整體讓人感覺是暴發户，很多華麗都衹停留於表面。
首先，讓我們最直接的不爽來自於房間的智能馬桶竟然壞了，不停在沖水，而且沖水的速度比排水的速度更快（也不是因為馬桶堵了，而是馬桶還有一個閥門擋住了排水），結果就是水漫金山，整個洗手間都淹了，雖然酒店後來派人來修了，但總覺得那馬桶會壞，不敢放心……。
其次是服務。第一、來修馬桶和來搞衞生的服務員雖然都有帶上手套，但修完馬桶那手套也不脱，就到處去觸摸其他位置，尤其是門把手，這讓客人看到不感到噁心嗎？第二、我們訂的是行政房，訂的條款裏面是有歡迎水果的及飲料的，但直到第二天臨退房了，我們終於打電話到前台問，前台開始還口硬説不包含，在我們再三強調下才送來“歡迎”水果。第三、我們也去過很多高檔品牌酒店的行政酒廊，這是我們第一次看到行政酒廊是沒有下午茶的，這算哪門子高檔酒店啊？
最後還有一些不合邏輯的地方，如門鈴是在走廊，但房門是要轉個彎才到，且房門沒有貓眼，所以這是一個非常大的安全隱患。還有就是健身中心的位置，無論要去泳池還是健身房都要先到18樓，但要進入健身房或到更衣室都必須到18樓經過那個網紅游泳池，再從泳池邊的入口走樓梯到回17樓才能進入，而且那條唯一上下的光滑的大理石樓梯也是連接更衣室和泳池的唯一通道。大家想象一下，到了18樓已經到了泳池邊了，誰還會再走到下面的更衣室啊？去健身的住客們，穿着整齊的運動裝備，穿過濕濕的泳池邊，才能走到健身房，那是什麼體驗？

msg:整體硬件是陪得上5星水準，到很多小細節尤其服務流程上離5星水準還是有一點距離的。譬如:
各種門（房間大門，房內浴室門，公共設施區域的門）可能阻尼設定的問題會“砰”地發出一聲巨響。譬如：在房間用吹風機的時候，插座明顯鬆脱，吹着吹着就會斷電。譬如：房間裏的電動馬桶半夜突然就壞了，沒法沖水，要臨時換房，且從確定要換房到拿到房卡都沒有前台主動打電話來告知，當時已經接近兩點，還是我們太累了打電話去問才説已經派服務員給我們送房卡。譬如: 房間的裝修格局都很上檔次，但是燈具開關設計過於“上檔次”，連我們這種經常住同類酒店的人都很難找到關燈的地方。再譬如，去之前定了個包間，收了500定金；結果吃完飯結賬的時候我自己一時沒想起來，酒店也完全不提退定金的事。直到出來半個小時想起來就在微信上問，一直到第二天也沒人回覆。還好餐廳出品是可以的，就決定第二天還是去喝個早茶。問了幾個經理，都説要查核，不清楚。甚至有個經理還説前晚付的金額一定是已經抵扣了定金的。我肯定我算的沒錯，讓他們再給打印昨晚的餐費，又過了一會才有另一個經理説確實沒退可以在今天的早茶費扣。好了等早茶結賬時，收銀員又按全額收，我説經理説了要扣除我定金的。又是一輪核對…還得找回“那個”經理才收對了錢。唉，就住進來一晚，吃住都是高端的價格，雖説工作人員服務態度都挺好，但總總細節真的讓人心累，感覺付了額外的服務費，還要自己額外“服務”自己。當然不拘細節的朋友們還是可以去體驗一下的，畢竟硬件設施和中餐出品我還是認可的。

msg:贊：酒店大大小小也住過一些 這個酒店有讓我想再來（孩子也這麼説）主要有幾點：1. 服務人員態度很好 2.整個房間很現代化 燈光窗簾控制等 都很自動 最喜歡是控制面板 我手伸過去就自動按鍵開燈 讓我知道哪個按鈕控制 3.房間裏面的每一個小細節都做的很好 物品質量到裝修設計 個人很喜歡 4.房間景觀空氣環境等都舒適滿意 5.衞生乾淨方面做的不錯，一般床單如果有點不乾淨我也會摸的出來，這次感受不錯。6.房費對比起來性價比算很高

批評：1.酒店上房間電梯多次出現自動熄掉全部選項 試過幾次需要重新按樓層然後錯過了自己樓層的現象 
2.無邊游泳池是我這次選這個酒店的其中一個原因 原本打算給孩子拍拍拍，但因為入住當天外國朋友們在這裏搞泳池派對，全是喝酒跳舞比堅尼，孩子實在不適合，導致沒辦法玩，這些活動個人本來也很接受，但建議這種出租活動不要在週末，畢竟很多家庭都是為了帶孩子過週末而入住的。

總結來説，這個酒店我很喜歡還是會選擇入住，不過下次入住前會先諮詢會不會有搞party活動再選擇。

msg:酒店的硬件設施沒問題，非常不錯，但是週末看到有多個活動舉行，酒店接待能力會有點不足，導致辦理入住時無法及時打掃好衞生。但酒店之後給升級了房型，辦理好入住。

酒店服務方面有些瑕疵，具體如下：一是房間內有二維碼可以掃碼點餐，但是真的掃碼後顯示“暫無服務”；二是服務員未經許可，在我們午休時自行刷門進入房間，雖然是誤會一場，但是給我們的感覺不佳。

msg:酒店的環境、景觀、房間規模都很好，可空調無論怎麼調風力和温度都是巨冷，燈光衹能全屋開或全屋關，很不人性化。最煩惱的是房間裏有蚊子，打給客服説酒店的電驅蚊液已全部送出沒有了，送來一瓶撕了標簽不知是該噴身上還是噴空氣的驅蚊水，不敢用，一宿不得安寧。

酒店人比較少，安靜，房型很大，基礎房型都非常寬敞，浴缸不是很多那種擺設款，很大很舒服，玻璃霧化效果關了直接泡澡看江景，太快樂了
陽台很寬，度假椅也是真的舒服，吹風看景，正對日落，市內度假這個水平沒得挑了
床墊是我喜歡的軟硬適中款，枕頭也不錯，全屋智能化水平很高，之前有些吐槽説的飛利浦煮水器我沒注意？我看到的是凈飲機，很方便，可能是換了，洗手間空間特別大，智能光起夜真的太方便，隔音也不錯，總之就是很滿意，之後想放空會再過來
樓下的粵王台，出品挺好吃的，這個價位這個江景這個出品，我覺得完全可以接受
自助餐廳沒有去吃，無法評價，天際泳池開的時間比較短，就沒上去了，不過我不太游泳，所以也沒評價
客房服務我覺得很好，電話立刻就接，我去的時候忘記充電器了，打電話要了之後兩分鐘就送到了，還送了三頭的，很貼心，喜歡
賓客服務經理Diane很熱情，服務很周到貼心，非常感謝

前台服務温暖細緻有禮貌，高奢酒店很難體驗到這麼這麼親民的服務，Iris為我們安排入住期間，粵語很純正温柔，利落又周全！
房間空間舒適排布得當，用品很現代。
18樓無邊泳池空氣好，水乾淨，救生衣負責又親切，帶着孩子玩兒多了一份放心；更衣室乾淨利落，設施齊備；
4樓用了中餐和晚餐，菜品和分量都不錯，價格稍高也可以接受～服務的幾位都親切有禮，應接及時得當。
酒店緊鄰環島綠道，走一走跑一跑或者騎行，都非常方便。
推薦推薦！

msg:以下是中肯的評價
1. 酒店設計同位置不錯，陽台景觀視覺開闊
2.房間設計新鮮感覺智能，但缺乏一些必須品（個人需要評價）燈開關衹有模式設定，人性化不夠
3.雖然開業不久，但已經有折舊感覺，例如我看到浴室花灑開關標識已經模糊，服務人手不足
4. 客房服務延時，浴室沒有熱水，由前台報備到工程部師傅到房處理（中途前台電話無人接聽，需要親自落前台投訴）大約1.5小時
5.客人電梯出現臨時停頓，急救按鈕當時無響應，應該虛設的，再次投訴。前台告訴會有值班經理致電溝通（到發佈為止，沒有與相關職員進行聯繫）
6.中餐廳服務一般，點了一個菜湯，等了一陣後，被告知沒有了，需要改其他菜，但最後飯都吃完都未上，結果取消了
7.泳池服務設備分配有問題，locker 需要落一層才有，並且指引不清晰
8.總體體驗評價，十分滿分，衹能給六分，合格

msg:虛有其表的酒店，硬件設施很好，但軟件配套極差，管理混亂，辦理入住時一大堆不知道是導遊還是什麼人圍着接待問東問西的，接待員專業水平也不夠處理問題不分主次，亂糟糟的。房間有問題打電話到客房中心，打了五次才有人接聽，之後再打又沒人接。在中餐廳和西餐廳完全沒有人接待，傻傻地站在門口等服務員，也不給你帶位，特別是西餐廳“幾位，進吧，裏面隨便坐”，這是什麼服務態度🤬。餐具衞生也差，從沒在餐廳裏見過這樣子的餐具，杯子拿了三個有兩個是崩口的，酒店的管理者不檢查的嗎？這家酒店差得打一星都給多了。

特別是經過前廳經理的講解才發現整個酒店所有設施都儘可能做得圓潤，特別是房間裏面，滿滿的現代日式風格（無蟎蟲風），據説這個老闆酒店聘請藝術大師打造。

如果你本身就是喜歡極簡主義的，你會喜歡這個有着180度江景大陽台的極簡舒適高科技房間。正式開業之後可能會客似雲來👍
🍃環境：景色來講，在廣州屬於稀缺，環境也是一流，非常安靜，對面就是大學城

msg:國慶期間住這網紅酒店，感受就是除了大、新、衞生還可以，其他都不行。
1. 節約成本，利潤最大化，影響客人體驗感受。
差不多14:00辦理入住，告訴我房間還沒有，要14:30以後才可以入住。我説：麻煩告訴具體入住時間。辦理人員無法回答。我接著説：15:00、17:00都是14:30以後，難道17:00入住，第二天我還要13:00退房嗎？合理嗎？！説了好幾遍，最後説幫我加急，先給我們預約好哪個房間，15:00左右可以入住。最後是我們未拿卡跟朋友上去房間看，發現整一層樓如此之大、每個房間60平方左右，居然在樓層的一邊（酒店的中央為界限）衹有一個個阿姨在打掃，阿姨很認真仔細，卻無奈根本做不來。房間打掃好我們自行進去了（前台已預約），房卡是我們自己主動聯繫前台兩次，最後16:30左右才送上了的。
2.  內部培訓完全不符合高級酒店的要求。
中餐廳（好像是4樓），裝修配得起這房費，服務卻不如一家普通的酒樓。
到餐廳坐下之前椅子臟了，部長級的人指着另一張椅子説：可以換一張。她的語氣沒有不妥，但行為有問題。看到餐廳的椅子臟了，是否馬上第一反應要不擦掉、要不給換了，但她卻讓客人自己換。我們還未能入住，拉着兩個個行李箱、背包、小孩…… 居然無動於衷！
更奇葩的是：我像服務員拿一杯温水，小孩子不能喝茶。她告訴我沒有温、衹有熱，我也算了，結果拿了一壺熱水和一個功夫茶的被稱為杯子。我問：沒有玻璃杯嗎？她的回答是：坐房間才可以用。這個回答，我覺得一個正常人都無法接受吧？！普通隨便一家酒樓，坐大廳都可以隨便讓服務員拿到玻璃杯，1921住一晚的高級酒店的餐廳，居然不給大廳客人玻璃杯。茶位費15元/位，這兩操作，對得是這個收費嗎？設定這規則的人員請問有高級大酒店餐廳經驗嗎？
3.  沐浴的水壓不足，朋友也都跟我一樣的感受，水時大時小，沐浴不舒適。
4.   小童用品不足。
有小童遊樂園，就是會有很多小朋友來啦，沒有提供小童拖鞋、沐浴洗髮用品。
5.  游泳池的水涼到…………所有下去的人都説涼。
6. 同第1點的第一句總結一樣。
早餐品種非常少，少之餘沒有覺得出品有多好，就是少而不精。

but服務真是有所欠缺，門口沒有迎接的人，假期這些大節日前台服務也衹有兩個，禮賓部也是前台兼任了。可能人員較少，所見酒店員工很少，能主動問好的沒有，話術也是有待提高。印象較好是餐廳的服務員，服務較為熱情。
周邊幾乎是沒有吃飯的了，中西餐廳都不踩雷，自助餐性價比很高節假日148/位，1.2以下小童免費。中餐館人均150菜式也很精緻。叫外賣等得比較久，大學城雖是琳琅滿目的外賣店，由於要送到生物島內所以至少都得繞5km的路。

可以點名表揚服務的就是前台，還有18樓泳池的服務人員，還有西餐廳門口的某兩位工作人員。還有一位送毛巾上門的客房服務員。其他的，尤其是中餐廳工作人員，作為五星級酒店的餐廳，這裏的服務人員一問三不知也就算了，態度跟大排檔沒什麼區別。茶點有一説一還行。住的一間客房門鎖有問題，關上門需要狠狠拉。總的來説家裡人看到開闊的視野還是挺開心那就算了。但這裏的服務水平亟待提高。

msg:知識城新開的一間高檔酒店，在試運行期間就馬上去體驗一下。服務還是可以的，有歡迎水果，迷你吧是免費的，房間科技感很強。早餐因為疫情原因是一人一份送到房間的，泳池等酒店配套設施都還沒投入使用。退房時前台送了一袋飲品，非常感謝！相信正式開業後會更好，不太貴的話會再來住的。

msg:第一次入住這一間酒店，之前也早有聽聞，這次特地過來體驗一番。環境非常好，坐落在生物島上，空氣新鮮。酒店服務也不錯，見到客人會主動打招呼，前台見我們兩人出行還贈送早餐，十分感謝。酒店非常有設計感，每一處都能看出設計師的別出心裁，整體科技感十足；房間內的設施也十分乾淨整潔，房間空間很寬敞，整體體驗很舒適
  但可惜還在試業期間，許多設施還在建設，空中泳池沒有開有點可惜，酒店早餐種類一般般，但味道還是不錯的；房間內部智能家居還沒完善，生活用品品質有待提高，但總體體驗還是不錯的，期待下次再次入住有更好體驗哈
