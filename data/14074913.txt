msg:Me and my husband stayed in the Guest-room - double occupancy.

+: The hotel exterior is beautiful. It is well located next to the outlets and the Liupancun Village food street. The beach is 8 min driving. The hotel is not new but clean. The view from the room is great and you can hear the birds in the morning! The pool is good. 

-: The breakfast is mainly local Chinese food with almost no variety of western food besides bread and fruit. 
- The room is not spacious for 2 people - not enough luggage space room to open and use your luggage. 
- There are animals on the territory of the hotel (llamas, alpacas, peacocks and even a dear). It might be fun for children but definitely not good for those animals(

Overall, the the hotel is nice and cost effective.

Wouldn't recommend, to be honest. But many seem to dig it.

We were struggling with communication but thankfully we had a great staff member Jesse helping us. He helped with sorting tickets, getting nucleic tests and finding results. I'm very thankful for his help and support towards us.

Cons: Booking policy was weird because we paid the full amount (as a "reservation booking") but then made us pay the same amount again when we are arrived and original payment was refunded. Which was pointless, a part payment as reservation would make sense.
We weren't much of a fan of the food and unfortunately there was not much around the hotel to do, alot of our activities were over 1hr away.

I would recommend the hotel because Jesse is so supportive and the hotel was clean.

Shuttle bus to and from the beach: This is still good. It should be a little distance from the beach. If you take a taxi, it will cost about ￥10.
The hotel has a shuttle bus to CDF Duty Free City, which is really good and convenient. My colleagues can save a lot of money.
The room I booked is not large. There is no stool in the room. There is one on the balcony, but I think it is a bit clean and I didn't sit on it. There is another point. The room is really really really really not soundproof. The diaphragm effect is too poor. The opening and closing of other rooms feels like opening my door. It's really bad.
The service attitude of their staff is also average. I went out in the morning for two days and told them to clean up the garbage and replenish the toiletries. I came back in the evening of the first day and cleaned everything. All my disposable sheets and quilts were removed from me. I thought about it. I came back in the evening of the second day and opened the door. 👀, it was intact and exactly the same. I wanted to come back to rest after playing outside, but when I saw it, it really affected my mood.
Breakfast: The variety is OK, and the freshness is also good, but there are some problems when entering the restaurant. When I went to eat the next day, I reported my room number and said that I did not include breakfast. I also checked the information. Fortunately, it was said that I did not include it. Later, I was asked to swipe the room card, but it still did not work. At that time, I began to doubt myself. Later, it was said that I included it. It was really a waste of time. Travel time is the most precious. I hope it will be improved.

As a result, I stayed for 8 nights instead of two nights. I couldn't go out and my wallet was emptied. We soaked in one hot spring pool every day, and we haven't finished all the pools. The swimming pool is even more circulating water, unlike other hotels that don't change the water all the time. The uncle who raises alpacas and ponies knows my daughters and greets us every day. There are also 2 cleaning sisters on the 4th floor of the building. The service and hygiene are very good. Because the one-year-old baby likes to bite slippers, we are barefoot in the room. The floor of this hotel is the only hotel that we don't use a rag to wipe again. Because we bring babies, bed fences, cribs, all delivered, really just make a phone call, there is nothing they can't do, and the breakfast, ate for a week and it was different cold and hot dishes every day. Next year, come to Sanya and stay in this private room. I don't know if you can give me a discount. The key point is that the hotel has a free shuttle bus to the beach and a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop every day! Let me emphasize again. Anyone who has been to Sanya knows how terrible mosquitoes, betel nut insects and midges are here. There are almost none in this hotel room. My daughter has finally had a bag here for a few days in Sanya, and she can finally sleep well.

msg:The hotel facilities are great, and the service quality is worth mentioning. When checking in, Xiaohui at the front desk was smiling and very friendly. During the stay, I called the front desk several times for help, and he answered the phone. His attitude was very good. We brought two children with us, and the children also liked this little brother. We added him on WeChat and said we would come again next time. The breakfast variety is also good, complete and delicious. The hotel also has hot springs, swimming pools, fish therapy, etc. It is great to take the children to soak in the water at night. It is very relaxing. I hope to see you again next time. When I come to Sanya, I will give priority to Accord Hotel.

When you are on vacation in the hotel, there are many options for hot spring pools, swimming pools, gyms, and some leisure facilities. Especially alpacas, ponies, peacocks, and some small animals are very popular with children. I originally stayed for only one night, and then renewed for 2 nights. The front desk service is good, the handsome guy Xiao Pan Xiao Yue answered questions enthusiastically, and also upgraded the room type. The hotel is about 2 km away from the beach, and the hotel has a car to pick up regularly, which is convenient. If I come to Sanya again, I will choose to stay here.

msg:The hotel is strategically located with convenient transportation, surrounded by outlets, commercial streets and famous attractions. As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby, the elegant a**osphere and friendly service made me instantly feel at home.

In terms of service, this place has undoubtedly reached a first-class level. The reception staff at the front desk were enthusiastic and professional and quickly helped me check in. Butler Xiao Pan introduced the hotel's facilities and services in detail. During my stay, the housekeeping service was also impressive. The room was tidied and cleaned every day to ensure that I was always in a comfortable environment.

When it comes to hygiene and comfort, I can only describe it as "impeccable". Every corner of the room is clean and tidy, and the bedding is soft and comfortable, allowing me to sleep peacefully every night.

In terms of breakfast, there are a variety of varieties provided here, including traditional Chinese breakfast, Western bread, fruits, etc. The restaurant environment is elegant and quiet, making it an excellent choice whether you are tasting delicious food or enjoying the beautiful morning light.

During this stay, I deeply appreciated the quality and care delivered by this fine hotel. Every detail showed professionalism and attentiveness, which gave me a real sense of home during the trip. I believe that this hotel will continue to win the trust and love of more guests in the future with its excellent services and facilities.

All in all, I was very impressed with this stay. If you are looking for a place to stay that combines high quality with a warm a**osphere, this is the hotel for you. Here, you can not only enjoy five-star luxury trea**ent, but also feel the warmth and comfort of home.

msg:When I first stepped into the Accord Suites Resort, I was attracted by its unique a**osphere and excellent service. This accommodation experience is undoubtedly a rare moment of relaxation in my busy life.
The facilities in the room are complete and novel, from high-quality bedding, to modern bathroom equipment, to high-speed Internet coverage, every detail reflects the hotel's intentions. What's even more rare is that the sound insulation effect of the room is very good, allowing me to enjoy the quiet while also ensuring adequate rest.
I would especially like to praise the hotel's service team. Every employee is smiling and very friendly. They are willing to help guests at any time, and Xiao Pan at the front desk is impeccable. Whether it is asking about travel routes or recommending local food, he can patiently answer questions. The check-in and check-out process was very smooth and there was no long wait. This efficient and caring service made me feel comfortable.
The hotel's restaurant provides a variety of cuisine, whether it is authentic local specialties or international cuisine sashimi, it can satisfy your taste buds. The breakfast options are particularly rich, with fresh fruits, delicious breads, and hot Chinese dim sum, making people feel good early in the morning. Dinner was equally satisfying.
In addition to basic rest and dining, the hotel's entertainment facilities are also quite complete. Gym, swimming pool, cute pet paradise and other facilities are all available.
Taking all of the above into account, I think the price at Accord Suites Resort is very reasonable. Considering the excellent service and first-class facilities, I think this is a very good value for money stay. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family without hesitation.
I look forward to Argyle Suites Resort continuing its excellent service and comfortable accommodations in the future. At the same time, I also suggest that the hotel can regularly update the facilities in the rooms to provide more novel and advanced equipment. This will not only meet the growing needs of guests, but also further consolidate its leading position in the market.

msg:The hotel can barely be considered a five-star hotel. Maybe a four-star hotel is more appropriate. Although it has everything it should have, it is still different from a real five-star hotel. Especially coming from Haitang Bay, I can feel the obvious gap. The equipment is a bit old, the gym is small, and the breakfast is average. The service was good. We were upgraded to a suite when we arrived very late. The room was okay and we could cook. It felt more like an apar**ent and not particularly comfortable. There are various activities during the Spring Festival, and there are many children. There are very few flights to the beach, not every five minutes as everyone said. Considering the price of hotels in Sanya during the Spring Festival, their price/performance ratio is still high, and the price is not particularly outrageous. Compared with Haitang Bay It's down-to-earth, but if you have requirements for a hotel and a vacation feel, I suggest you consider it.

msg:It can be said to be the most satisfying hotel I have ever stayed in. It’s not about how luxurious the hardware is, it’s mainly about the service experience and living experience. We arrived at the hotel on the evening of the fourth day of the ***** New Year. The waiter Xiaoye warmly received us and upgraded us to a two-bedroom suite for free. Whether on business or tourism, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and this is the first time I have experienced a substantial upgrade. I believe you all understand that the so-called upgrades in ordinary hotels are just the same room with a higher floor, but this hotel actually has a higher floor. I was actually upgraded from one bedroom and one living room to two bedrooms and one living room, which was really unexpected and pleasantly surprised.

The room was large, very clean, almost spotless. All hardware facilities are very characteristic of Sanya and very comfortable. I particularly like the oversized balcony.

The swimming pool, hot springs and cute pet paradise inside the hotel are very good. When you are not going out, you can completely pass the time in the hotel. There are also special events during the Spring Festival, but unfortunately I didn’t have the chance to experience them this time.

highly recommended! !

The security guard's attitude when parking was very poor and impatient, and the front desk would not take the initiative to take the luggage. The room is very small, looks very old, and feels very depressing. The bathroom is not small, and the design is not reasonable at all. There is no place to open the suitcase in the room. It calls itself a hotel, and all B&Bs provide disposable slippers. , there is no such thing in other places. It is understandable that children charge for breakfast, but they actually have to add 98.

msg:I called 110 while staying in the hotel! Terrible experience at this hotel!

That day, I was swimming alone in the hotel swimming pool, and I happened to meet an Internet celebrity live broadcast. The sound was very loud! At the beginning, I negotiated with the internet celebrity and asked him if he could stop live broadcasting near the swimming pool. Because I was swimming in a swimsuit! Don't want to be in the camera! Don't want to be disturbed! After all, staying in a hotel involves my privacy! However, this person still did not make any concessions and still dominated the live broadcast by the pool!

I went to negotiate with the hotel again to see if the internet celebrity could live broadcast from another location! ? Unexpectedly, the hotel actually said that the live broadcast was normal! Some employees reported that this internet celebrity was invited by them! The purpose is to sell hotel rooms!

In desperation, I could only call the police! Please police let this internet celebrity leave!

Once a customer checks into a hotel, they have the right to privacy protection. Find an internet celebrity to do a live broadcast by the pool to expose the privacy of the guests! Disturbing guests from relaxing! Such a terrible check-in experience!

msg:I live in one bedroom and one living room. It is clean and hygienic. The environment is very good and quite quiet. I arrived at the hotel before nine o'clock in the morning, and I happened to have a room, so I checked in directly. There is a laundry room, which is very convenient. The laundry beads have to be picked up at the front desk. It is far away from the sea, and it takes a long time to walk. It takes five minutes to drive. The hotel has a car (four times) every day. Usually we take a taxi back by ourselves.

I stayed for five days in total. l Argyle Hotel has a quieter and quieter environment than hotels of the same price near the underwater world, which is very suitable for vacation and leisure.
The service attitude of the hotel staff is good and enthusiastic. The cleaning aunt is more diligent, and the room is cleaned promptly and cleanly.
The next time I have the opportunity to come to Sanya, I will choose the Accord. I hope that the housing prices will not rise during the same period.

The location is about 45 minutes away from the airport and 20-30 minutes away from the city center. The environment is clean and tidy, the lobby is spacious, and the service attitude at the front desk is very good. The concierge depar**ent also provides paid pick-up and ticket services for different tourist attractions, free shuttle buses to and from the beach and duty-free shops. The room was big and clean, with plenty of water and towels provided, and the terrace had a great view. Due to the tight schedule, I was not able to use the hot springs, outdoor swimming pool and indoor fitness center in the hotel this time, but the facilities look good, but the area around the swimming pool is being renovated and there may be a little dust. There are many choices for breakfast, including salad, stir-fry, cold companion, pasta, fruit, dessert and so on. We stayed for 4 days, and the dishes have changed a little, so we won't get tired of eating. Overall, the hotel experience is very good, but it is not close to the bus station, it is recommended to take a taxi as a means of transportation.

I did a lot of homework before departure, and accommodation is a very important part. The first-tier hotels have the right time and place. Even in the so-called off-season, the prices are still high, and the proletarian working class is inevitably shy. Looking left and right, I chose the Accord with an attitude of giving it a try. I booked it for one night first, and then I will look at it later. The one-living room and one-bedroom classmate Xiao Chen at the front desk was upgraded to one living room and two bedrooms for free. The room and environment are good, and my parents-in-law are coming, so I will stay for another two days, thank you Xiaopan. Take it easy and stay a few more days.

When you come to the store, you can meet Mo Momo, the only pet dog who can swim and catch crabs in Houhai. It feels like the most family-friendly store in Houhai. The owner and his wife are very amiable, and the lady at the front desk is also very gentle and meticulous.

msg:The hotel service staff has a good attitude and the environment is clean and tidy. And take the initiative to upgrade the room type, one bedroom and one living room into two bedrooms and one living room (one big room and one small room) is really not too cool! The living room is quite spacious with a large balcony and a small kitchen. During the two nights I stayed, the aunt cleaned it every day and replaced the supplies in time! The breakfast in the hotel is not bad, I like the Hainan noodles and it is really delicious😄 The hotel has its own swimming pool, and the pool photos are also very good! It is less than ten minutes away from Yalong Bay Beach, and there are cute animals during the day~ In addition, there are free photo shoots, and the little brother is also very serious and responsible! Generally speaking, it is a treasure hotel, and it is very cost-effective to purchase the platform package. I am very satisfied with my first trip to Sanya. If there is a chance next time, I will come to this hotel again!

The hotel has its own hot springs and various types of soup pools, but the hot weather in the past few days was a bit too hot, so I didn't go there. There are not many people in the swimming pool during the day, but there are more people at night after the sun goes down. There are alpacas, ponies and, it is said, peacocks in the hotel. The self-service laundry service is very convenient, and the laundry detergent can be collected directly at the front desk.
Overall, it's pretty good. My boyfriend said that during the May 1st period, you can book a hotel with this kind of environment at this price. The price/performance ratio is already very high
The disadvantage is that there is no electric mosquito repellent in the room; another point is that there are relatively few sockets, which are not enough for people like me who have too many electronic products; the room I live in does not have a ventilation fan in the toilet

The big swimming pool and cute pet paradise are also very good, suitable for bringing children. The only disadvantage is that there are few supporting facilities around, so it is not convenient to eat and travel, and it is very suitable to live here by car.

msg:The very poor hotel does not meet the five-star mark at all. The lights in the room are all broken and the door cannot be locked. The corridor seems to be a wild building renovation because I was pregnant. As a result, there were a lot of bugs and I was bitten to death. I checked out that night and the hotel didn’t give me a refund. I admit that my hotel is such a good thing that Ctrip coordinated it for one day and one night and finally got a full refund. I really hope that when Ctrip evaluates star hotels in the future, it can seriously evaluate such a hotel. !

Everyone had a great time. The breakfast is very rich, you must try the hor fun noodle soup, it is super delicious [呲牙]
In addition, it is recommended to buy some small wine Yakult from the nearby supermarket after going out for a day. Make a cup yourself, and drink a cup when you are in the hot spring. It’s so refreshing hahaha

There are restaurants with local characteristics, and there are supermarkets and fruit stalls. Liupan Village is very good next to the forest park, and you can walk there without driving. There is a parking lot in Liupan Village, 9 yuan for half a day. 2 kilometers to the south, there is the Dongrong Food Court in the Marriott Hotel, and the beach is right across the hotel. I think that the beach in Yalong Bay is better than any other place, it is soft like space sand, and the beach in Wuzhizhou Island is not as cool as the water in Yalong Bay. So I chose to live in this cost-effective hotel in the Yalong Bay area. It is suitable for bringing children to live. There are swimming pools and warm pools. There are alpacas and ponies every day, as well as ducks, rabbits and peacocks. There are also dolls played by the staff in the courtyard for public relations every day🤩. There are supermarkets in the courtyard, and there are restaurants and bars that are quite expensive.

Finally, I said to check out and not stay here the next day. The front desk said that I booked on Ctrip and had to call Ctrip. In the end, the order was booked for a few days and I had to stay for a few days, and the fee would not be refunded if I did not stay. ! ! ! When I placed the order, there was no reminder that it could not be refunded, and if I didn’t stay, I would have to pay for the next few days!

She stayed for two consecutive days and found us 3 adults and 2 children when cleaning the next day. Just put a lot of bottles of shower gel, shampoo, and a few more bottles. The chubby little brother at the front desk is very nice and polite. The only dissatisfaction is that it is on the first floor and the back garden on the first floor is connected to China Unicom. From the balcony to the balcony of our room, if the balcony door is not locked, the room window is easy to be stolen. Although the people who live in are all qualified people, it is necessary to guard against others, and they will feel less safe. The buffet is also good, at least there will be no place to eat breakfast. In addition, there are not many places to eat nearby, and there are only a few of them, either in the outlets or in the food court.

We transferred from the crowded MGM, maybe because of the cleanliness, we didn't feel the difference, and it felt very profitable compared to this price. The restaurant is average, but it's convenient to order takeout.

msg:On this trip, I made a temporary decision. I saw many hotels and homestays. My son finally chose this one. I was worried that I would not choose it well. I saw that the hotel has many good reviews and a few bad reviews, so I tried to book for a day first. We arrived at the store early that day, and the receptionist was the beauty Wu Xiaoyan at the front desk. She had a very good service attitude and was very polite. Although she spoke few words, all the services were excellent. She was sympathetic to me with my two children and took the initiative to upgrade me as soon as possible. Room, this is the first warmth we felt during this trip, and this is one of the reasons why we choose to stay again. No matter what the hotel is, service is too important for the operation of a hotel. I have seen some bad reviews before. , said how bad the hotel's environment is, this time I paid attention to it, the environment has been improved, when I left today, the hotel staff were carefully cleaning the aisles, flushing the aisles, and the alpacas they raised. Watching for the children by the pool, green plants, phoenix trees, all lush and well maintained, I think it should be improved with heart, like! In terms of hardware facilities, there is a paid cafeteria in the hotel, which can be bought or not sold, because we did not buy it, so the cafeteria will not be evaluated; there is a large screen for watching movies in the hotel, which is open at night and closes at 10 pm. Swimming pool There is a small shop to buy swimsuits next to it, which is convenient! There are fitness equipment next to the swimming pool, a dry laundry room, and a lounge in the building. Now let's talk about the interior. I forgot to take pictures of the interior. Unfortunately, I can express it in words. The room has two rooms, one living room, one kitchen and one bathroom. Balcony, the room is clean and hygienic, the bedding is comfortable, and the air conditioner is turned on for the guests in advance, which is very considerate. There is cleaning in the middle of the stay. The air conditioner in the master bedroom where we live is a little cold, but I can accept it myself. It is recommended that the hotel is free Check from time to time, in addition the living room and other rooms are cold, and the room is equipped with mineral water. During the epidemic, takeout can be delivered to the Meituan cabinet in the lobby, which is very convenient. It is 17 yuan to go to Yalong Bay High-speed Railway Station. Next to the hotel is Yalong Bay Outlet Town No. 1. This is this shopping mall. There are big-name clothing stores, McDonald's, restaurants, etc. Although it is not particularly lively, the environment is good and clean. Usually tourists from the surrounding area are there. A taxi from the hotel to Wuzhizhou Island is about 50 yuan, and the Paradise Forest Park is about 10 yuan. That's about it for sharing, thank you for all the encounters. The camera technology is not good, don't mind it.

msg:Except for the public areas in the hotel, the other facilities are really outdated. The sanitary ware is so simple that it is worse than a fast hotel. The breakfast is not worthy of 1,000 yuan a night. It can be said that the breakfast is not even as good as the breakfast of some express hotels in third- and fourth-tier cities. The breakfast waiters and some chefs provided extremely poor service. I wouldn't choose a hotel like this if the price is around 300. I wanted to take some photos but I wasn’t in the mood to even take them.

The breakfast buffet has less variety and tastes ordinary. There are also buffets at noon and evening, which are similar to breakfast. The hotel guest is 30 yuan per person. After the buffet is over, you can also order a la carte. The noodles in Figure 3 that I had for breakfast were delicious.
It is close to Forest Park, and there are many restaurants around that can deliver meals. We live in a one-bedroom, one-bedroom suite with more than 400 people. There is a kitchen for cooking, which is very cost-effective. But it is not suitable for playing in a hotel.

The only thing that is not good is that the style of breakfast is too simple, and there are not many dishes. The key is to have breakfast at 7-10 o'clock. There is no meal at 9:30, and the extra meal is very slow. I'm a bit sorry for the 40-person breakfast fee! !

msg:This may be the most unhappy stay I've had in so many years. First of all, the overall hardware of the hotel is only 3.5 stars, which is the highest. The front desk is a joke. The uniforms worn by the reception staff made my heart skip a beat. It’s that Northeastern bathing style. People should abide by their own responsibilities and charge whatever price you are in. Except for the location in Yalong Bay, the price of this hotel should be its usual price. It is normal to increase by 50% during the New Year. If you double the price and make a corner, it is too much. The food for breakfast was horrible, and it was all gone before the time came, and nothing was left to pick up. How did you have the nerve to pay more than 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 for the room? Hainan Island is a bit crazy this year. There are so many people that they are like dumplings. The supplies and service personnel cannot keep up with the number of people entering the island. I booked this hotel very early. The pictures and introduction were quite attractive, and it met my family's requirements. Maybe my expectations were too high. It was a torment these three days. You might as well be deceived if you paid 10,000 yuan for it. If you are traveling with a large family, you can choose this hotel. The price must not be too high, otherwise you will regret it. Not worth it.

msg:The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, ten steps and one scene, whether it is the building or the garden, there is a sense of design. Most of the rooms are suites with new facilities and a sense of design, which is unified with the style of the entire hotel.
Children's favorites are the hotel's little peacocks, alpacas and ponies. The alpaca looks a little mischievous, the pony is docile, and the little peacock is lively and cute. The hotel is like a beautiful park, and you may encounter these cute little animals at any time during the day.
The swimming pool is very good, there are adult pools and children's paddling pools, the pool water is clear and transparent. The swimming pool is also very unique. It is really unique to watch movies on the big screen in the pool at night. The kids love it and go swimming every day.
The restaurant has a large amount of food, and the chef's skills are good. There is a small shop in the hotel, the owner and his wife are very nice, and the price is relatively cheap compared to the shops inside the general star hotel.
The service in the hotel is very good, the service staff I have encountered are very gentle and patient. Liu Hua at the front desk (I don't know if it's this name), Xiao Wu and other unnamed service staff are especially able to think about the guests. The child's birthday coincided with us. We only mentioned it in the lobby. I didn't expect the hotel to specially send birthday noodles after knowing it. Since it was during the lockdown period of the epidemic, the hotel was very busy at that time, the express delivery was stopped, and the supplies were becoming more and more scarce. We are very grateful for this special birthday gift!
During this stay, we caught up with the epidemic in Sanya. After the city was closed on August 6, tourists were blocked from leaving the island. Most of the tourists staying in the hotel brought their children. For fear of affecting the children’s return to school, tourists including us in a hurry. Fortunately, there is a nucleic acid testing point 200 meters away from the hotel. It is convenient to do nucleic acid testing every morning, and there are not many people in line. The hotel actively helped tourists to report information, and shared the information with the guests in a timely manner. We successfully took the government chartered flight to leave the island.
The epidemic has had a great impact on Sanya's tourism industry, as well as the work and life of tourists. For more than ten years, I have been to Sanya almost every year. I like the blue sky and blue sea here. I hope that the haze of the epidemic will dissipate as soon as possible, and this beautiful city will return to life as soon as possible.

msg:The hotel is located in the Yalong Bay area. It is quite far from Baihua Valley and close to the Outlets. There is a free parking lot when you drive by yourself. The service staff in the lobby are not very active in service. Our family carried 3 boxes to the room by ourselves; the room is not like a hotel , much like an apar**ent, it's clean, but there are geckos in the room (we live on the 2nd floor), and the air conditioning is particularly powerful! The swimming pool is not big, and the area for children is not large. There are several pools in the hot spring, so I didn't dare to try it (the water looked cloudy). The biggest fault of staying in this hotel this time is the breakfast. Breakfast is 30 per person. This price determines the quality of the dishes. It is worth 30. The hotel breakfast is too bad. Both are more than 600, but the experience is completely different, one is a high-end hotel, the other is an economic apar**ent. However, Yalong Bay is expensive. Maybe this price is normal, but we have lived in Huayu and Metropark (the same price in Yalong Bay), and the breakfast is several grades better than Accord. Every morning, someone complains in the restaurant that there is nothing to eat without this or that. This morning, the aunt of Northeast Cooking Noodles also criticized the customer, "If you don't have anything to eat, you can find the staff and tell me it's a good idea. I don't see that I'm busy!" I hope the hotel doesn't want it. Because the restaurant problem has ruined the hotel's future, pay attention to it, I may not come next time. There is a small zoo in the hotel, which is of little significance. The children are fresh for two minutes...

msg:All the low scores are for the male front desk with glasses and short hair, which ruined the impression of the whole hotel. When I checked in on New Year's Eve, they said they couldn't find my order and asked me which platform I bought it from. I couldn't see the phone in your hand. Is it Ctrip? I asked how to deal with this situation, but they didn't answer. They asked me to figure it out myself. I called Ctrip customer service, and the customer service proposed to communicate with the hotel, but the front desk refused to answer the phone. I was surprised. Why can't Ctrip remove the hotel if you don't want to cooperate with Ctrip? What does this mean? The whole process was like I owed him 8 million. Isn't staying in a hotel to get angry? After Ctrip handled it, they didn't say a word throughout the whole process and just left, like a ****. It's really the hotel with the worst service attitude I've ever stayed in. If you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it. Others don't stay in hotels to get angry. After reading many bad reviews in the past about service attitude, I am convinced. It seems that this is not an isolated case.

The hotel yard is in a triangular shape. At night, the echoes make a lot of noise. There is an outdoor swimming pool in the courtyard. The "Insomniac" bar next to the swimming pool is a big failure. From night to nearly 2 o'clock in the morning, drunkards laugh and shout without caring about the feelings of others. The hotel management is seriously lagging behind and is indifferent to this and fails to intervene in time. The breakfast is average, nothing special, just enough to fill you up. Ctrip advertises it as a five-star hotel, but in fact it is less than four stars. It feels like an upstart temporarily contracting a county hotel.

It is facing the mountains and open spaces, and it really suits us with this kind of empty scenery 😄😃 Although it was so unpleasant at the beginning, after changing the room the next day, I was still satisfied!

This time I came to Sanya again and stayed for a few more nights. Many facilities are not open in the off-season, but the room is really big. With children, I really like to live in this one-bedroom, one-bedroom room, which is great! big again! Very close to the beach, closer to the outlet, convenient to eat and shop! If I go to Sanya again, I will stay here again!

🍃Environment: The environment is more elegant, with constant temperature hot springs, outdoor swimming pools, barbecues by the pool at night, gymnasium (the time was too short to enter), and small animals, especially the constant temperature hot springs. In the past two days, Sanya is catching up with cloudy days and low temperatures , I can't go to the sea at all. Fortunately, there is this hot spring. There is no vaginal discharge in the swimsuit. 10 hot springs have been opened in the past two days, which is more comfortable.
🔔Service: When checking in, a concierge will lead you to the room and introduce various places.

About location: The hotel is temporarily booked during the Chinese New Year. The location of the hotel is close to the Yalong Bay Outlets, about 800-900 meters away from the Outlets.
About parking: There is free parking.
Service: The service of this hotel is really good, it is always on call, and I will arrange anything for you immediately. I stayed for 8 days. During the Chinese New Year, I did not encounter the situation of chattering and delaying.
Hotel facilities: There are 7 hot spring pools in the hotel (free for hotel guests), two swimming pools, one large and one small (non-constant temperature), there are four peacocks, an alpaca, and a pony in the hotel (can Ride and slip), there is an evening barbecue next to the hotel swimming pool to go to school.
About the price: The price is relatively cheap as a whole, suitable for bringing children to stay, the environment is also relatively good, very clean. There will also be artificial snowfall during Chinese New Year. Of course, there are not many entertainment facilities for children in the hotel. Compared with hotels specializing in parent-child facilities (such as Tianyu, Atlantis, etc.), there is no way to compare, but the overall cost performance will be much cheaper.
From the seaside: about 7 minutes by car from the side, very close. By car, you can park at Baihuagu Commercial Street, opposite the seaside.
If you want to know more, you can search for Tang Dou Ai Da Wang Duck in Red Book
Specializing in writing parent-child strategies and exploring stores. Sanya also wrote a guide to help avoid pits, as well as suggestions for items and brands to bring

msg:The service is really bad. I have stayed in the most outrageous hotel. I originally booked this hotel on Ctrip. This is the second time.
The first time, the attitude was okay, it was a young lady.
The second time, it was also a woman. But not alone. The second time I came, I admitted that I didn't see the deposit. The deposit asks me five hundred.
I didn't agree, after all, there are quite a few things that go wrong with the deposit. Just be careful. Then that woman was the one who received me, and she knew that she would not be able to quit. Also let me call Ctrip. Then Ctrip said they couldn't cancel the subscription. Do not deduct money normally.
Business doesn't do that.
Then there is a little brother next to him.
After communicating with him, he gave me the deposit money a little bit cheaper. Why is the deposit more expensive than one night.
Besides, am I such a bad talker? !
What's even more funny is that when I check out, the invoice is issued, and I have to scan the code, which is the end of the scan. Invoices can't be opened for half a day! An intern opened.
Really this kind of service attitude is not as good as Home Inn.
The lights are also dimmed. The pool looks okay (just for reference personal experience)

It is not far from the beach supermarket and Ole. There are shuttle buses to the beach every day, as well as buses to various attractions in Yalong Bay. Come to play with peacocks, ponies and alpacas for children: fruits are delivered for a few days during the Chinese New Year; you can order food at the restaurant downstairs, mutton skewers and prawn skewers are delicious, the price is moderate, seafood and meat are a little expensive; Chinese breakfast is complete . The waiter on the fifth floor of Building 2, Xiao Tan, is very good. One suggestion: the price of the restaurant should not change with the passenger flow: clean the mop with detergent, and the room will smell after mopping.

msg:The key to the hotel is nothing to say, it is very clean and tidy, the swimming pool is large, there are many hot spring pools, and the temperature of the warm water is appropriate. There are not many people going to me at this time. It can be said that I contracted the whole hot spring area by myself. Haha, it's so cool. The room is very comfortable with a large balcony. Looking down from the balcony, you can see the entire hotel. The details of the hotel are also very good, there will be napkins by the elevator. It’s just that it’s not very comfortable in the dim sum, that is, the hotel should pay more attention to the tourists who live alone, because a person is lonely and helpless in the field. The main thing is that the hotel can give people a warm and homely feeling, so I hope I will stay. Longer here. After staying for two days, I took the initiative to call and let them clean up. The service staff are relatively indifferent and don't say hello very much when they meet the guests. So I hope that the staff and services can be improved in the later period. Of course, this hotel is definitely a very cost-effective hotel nearby. recommend

msg:Very satisfied after staying two nights, soaking in the hot spring is so comfortable! I knew it would be more comfortable to book a suite. Ms. Liu Hua at the front desk was very helpful, helped with the luggage and reminded us of the things left in the room.

🔔Service: The service is the most satisfying. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, the attitude is very good. There are staff who check in to help us carry the luggage, especially the cleaning aunt, who helped us find the lost things and asked us if we want to change the cleaning items.
🍃Environment: Inside the resort, it is very quiet. There are more mosquitoes, so I suggest you bring good medicine.
🧹Sanitation: Sanitation is very good, and the toilets are very high-end.
🚗 Transportation: The transportation is not so convenient, and it is more friendly to friends who drive by car. There are many takeaways nearby, and the outlets are only a 10-minute walk away.

🚗 Transportation: It's all the way down from the highway, it's very easy to find, parking is also very convenient, the parking lot is close to the accommodation building; walking distance to the outlet, walk to the nearest seaside about two kilometers

🧹Hygienic: Be sure to like it, it’s very clean, and Yalong Bay has mountains on three sides and the sea on the other. Compared to other areas, it’s not humid and the bedding is very dry.

🔔Service: This experience is not bad, there is a place called Miss Lin Hui at the front desk that she has questions to patiently explain, and the room type is upgraded; as soon as the hotel comes in, the little brother helps to get the package, and finally the room card is opened and helped to get it.

The rooms are comfortable, the corridors are spacious, and the distance between the rooms is not restricted. It is a 15-minute walk from Ole and a 5-minute drive from the beach. It takes only 10 minutes to go to Baihua Valley Shopping Center. It is very convenient to call a taxi nearby. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to the duty-free city and beach. Good service.

設施一流水準，包括温泉泳池、園景設計、早餐標準都花了一些心思，萌寵也很可愛，小朋友很喜歡。
環境很乾凈，很優美安靜，房間隔音效果一級棒，晚上睡得很舒服。
前台的小李服務很周到很熱情，在餐廳丟了嬰兒濕巾，想辦法幫忙送了兩包濕巾。
缺點：
門卡很不靈敏，是通病，看到好幾個住客在門口一遍一遍試開門，給人一種酒店很老舊的感覺（實際不是）。
卧室的空餘插座竟然衹有床頭有一個，完全不夠用，很麻煩。
温泉池的標誌不是很全，有的温泉池沒有標誌不知道里麪是什麼葯湯不敢去。
早餐煎炸冷食較多、蒸煮糕點麪食較少，不是很有食慾。
注意事項：
萌寵樂園建議早上玩賞，小動物會牽出來散養，晚上去都在籠子裏不太好玩。

msg:作為三亞的最後一站，想着離森林公園比較近，就帶着爸媽選擇住在這裏。入住的時候前台一位個子不高的男生辦理的，因為我們三個人，而且我要提前飛回去一天，所以定了一室一廳。
看圖片一室一廳客廳蠻大，還有好多客人評價説都給升級了，所以抱着碰運氣的態度看看能不能升級，另外不能升級的話，我睡沙發也行。
辦理完入住發現沙發不夠大，加床客廳估計放不下，所以又到前台諮詢付費升級（剛入住就諮詢過前台，説滿房了升級不了）。
後來付了500升級到兩室一廳，前台衹給兩份早餐（升級前房間帶的），我們三個人兩份早餐是沒有辦法一起吃的，所以我就諮詢他能不能多送一份早餐給我們，他堅決説不可以，而且給的理由是餐廳是外包的。
前台態度執拗且強硬，説早餐可以額外付費¥68，我真的很不理解我都把升級的付了，為什麼不能多加一份早餐呢？還要額外花錢？
關鍵我後面還跟兩名其他工作人員（一名前台一名餐廳）打聽餐廳是否是外包的，得到的答案都是酒店的。
以上是在其他渠道預訂的情況，後來我回京，爸媽兩位不想搬行李所以又在攜程上預訂了一間。

真的很生氣，來三亞10天，這是體驗最差的服務，不説跟其他升級客人比，我加錢升級房間倒是情理之中，但是連額外一份的早餐還要再加錢，這種巨大落差感真的很讓人生氣。
也許這名男員工在恪盡職守的工作，但絕不是用心服務的。
酒店環境不錯，其他工作人員也都很熱情，但是這個破早餐毀了我整個旅遊的心情，最後離開也沒能釋懷，衹能借助衹言片語：不推薦這家酒店。

酒店服務也不錯，前台酒吧小賣部老闆都挺好的，挺熱心～
酒店衞生很乾凈，被褥不潮濕，房間通風好，層高挺高，整體很滿意
唯一感覺需要改善的就是酒店自帶的餐廳，雖然衹吃了一頓晚餐，但是很一般，且不便宜，好在周邊有挺多可以吃的選擇，外賣味道也蠻不錯。

早餐對得起價格吧，萌寵樂園無人看管，羊駝是不敢上去摸的，已經有人被吐口水了。
廚房雖然沒用到但大餐桌很方便吃外賣。
酒店位置雖然偏，但離奧萊近步行400米，奧萊中秋前是真沒人逛，價格也不是很划算一般正價打個7折，沙灘離的遠需要定時坐擺渡車去，但亞龍灣沙灘説實話去玩個兩小時就可以回來了，抓螃蟹撿貝殼要去三亞灣

msg:今年這次亞龍灣之行覺得最大的驚喜和滿意就是訂了這家酒店，今年其他酒店價格奇高，看了很多評論懷着忐忑心情訂了雅閣度假酒店，到了後酒店經理小陳見我們長者多且帶着小孩，主動為我們升級成了兩房套房，住進去發現酒店衞生情況良好，酒店設施齊全、蠻新，酒店地理位置也非常不錯走路到outlets也衹需要十分鐘。而且做為兩孩父母，酒店親子項目豐富，絲毫不亞於其他亞龍灣高端酒店親子項目，以前老是選擇大牌酒店趟，其實這次開啟了另外一種節約路徑且效果不錯，真心點贊，下一次還會選擇雅閣酒店！再次也特別為小陳的暖心服務點贊！第一次在攜程寫評論，説的不好大家請見諒！

msg:因為已經住了三晚海景了，所以無所謂是不是臨海了。最終選了這家，結果意外的覺得性價比很高。首先優點1.服務滿分，前台辦理入住時，小姐姐陳小蘭就很暖心，視房態幫我們升級了一級。不像我們上一家，別人升級了，我去投訴才給我升級。
2.泳池晚上有室外電影，配上酒吧的音樂，氛圍感拉滿。
缺點，離亞龍灣海灘2公里。但是説真的，一晚上便宜好幾百，打車吃飯不香嗎？

msg:設施：外部設施還可以的。有泡温泉的地方，還養了很多東西，外部環境還不錯的。內部設施很簡陋，裏面用的東西都很差，吹風機用的30塊錢的飛科，這個款式老的都找不出來了。裏面像民宿，反而不像五星酒店。需要提高下。
衞生：衞生很一般，剛進去有股尿味，蓋上馬桶蓋沖了很久，通了很久的風。隔音很差，樓上動靜都能聽到的。
環境：酒店應該是從民宿改過來的，外觀還可以，温泉那邊佈置的還不錯
服務：服務還行，工作人員都還熱情的

msg:是公寓類型，兩室一廳，亞龍灣附近價格相對經濟一點的，適合多人一起出遊，對住宿要求不高的。設施很一般，類似較新的出租房。要吐槽下包含的早餐，真不行，沒有服務意識，有點像家庭承包的小食堂。位置距離亞龍灣海灘有一點距離，一般要叫車，如果走的話將近1小時。適合衹需在亞龍灣海灘不太遠有個落腳點的客人選擇，其他服務什麼的就不要奢求了。

特色湯泉泡池:水温各種都有，適合小孩長者。
設施：房間有晾衣架，可以放陽台晾衣，所以游泳温泉的衣服都方便處理。

msg:不知道怎麼形容這麼差的酒店了，前台辦理入住的小妹，一副欠她錢似的，我隨口問了一聲，能否升級，她跟我説，酒店已經滿房，我心想疫情期間還能滿房很厲害了。然而當我打開房門時，天哪，與房間描述差的也太遠了點吧，我是學建築的，請問30㎡是包含走廊的公攤面積嗎？房間小到連行李箱打開都沒法走路，房間裏的衣櫃比出租屋裡的衣櫃都要破，移門會發出嘎吱嘎吱的響聲。我還要連住3個晚上，4天3晚，我見到的住客除了2個俄羅斯女人帶着2個娃之外就再也沒見過了，號稱温泉酒店，一問，温泉拆了。早餐更別提了，虛有其表的酒店，不如民宿的服務，設施破損不堪，到了夜裡，酒店陰森森的，房間燈都不亮的。給人感覺很不舒服。大家想體驗什麼叫"蝸居"可以來試試。
有一説一，禮賓部的小哥態度還可以，問了潛水有什麼優惠，就極力推薦，再問一下蜈支洲島的優惠，就讓我加了旅行社的小哥…奉勸大家一句不要花錢找罪受
圖片就沒有了，可以看看之前別人的差評圖片，跟我所見的差不多。

酒店設施較老。
周邊有一個奧特萊斯，有一個百花谷商場，比較小，吃的要到百花谷那邊，出行需要打的。離亞龍灣沙灘近。

msg:三年前就來住過感覺很好，雖然不算大但是配套温泉，泳池，晾衣服有陽台，都還是很方便的，什麼都有，性價比還是可以的，服務也還是挺好的，前台短髮的美女，還幫我們升級了房間很感謝。。。説説不足，房間晾衣架該換了，五個衣架壞三個。。。温泉很多個池子水温度高，燙的泡不了，本來能泡的池就不多，沒有全部開放，温泉管理人員工作要加強哦，還有就是客房卧室，衞生間的清潔有待加強。。。還有小童遊樂設備可以適量加那麼一兩個。。。有機會還會再來希望下次體驗會更好
