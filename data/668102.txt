msg:I went to Guangzhou for a week end with friends. Unfortunately the experience of the hotel was not so good: 1) we arrived at midnight after long travel and we had to wait 30 minutes for the check in because the hotel needed a lot of time to manage other customers; for me this is not acceptable for this level of hotels 2) the breakfast was rich in quantity, but the quality was not in line with the price paid and the average quality of Western hotels; especially the sweet desserts and coffee were not good (please consider that I am Italian and not Chinese, so of course the quality required is top level) 3) regarding the position, next time I will choose other hotels in the new built area close to the river, opposite of the Canton Tower, because it seemed much better. At the end, i think Doublee Tree should improve the quality of services for this hotel, because I travelled to other Double Tree hotels in the world and their quality was much better.

msg:Mr. Zero Zhang from the concierge is very friendly and helpful. When asked him for the nearby attractions and restaurants, he advised us patiently.

The location of the hotel is nearer to the East Gate of Yue Xiu Park, where we spotted this bookstore with Zen feel.  However, it took about 15 min walk to the nearer mrt station.

I would suggest the front desk to have a clearer queuing line for check in.  There is one counter stated on the floor carpet for membership, so I queued at the next counter where the staff was serving a customer in front of me.  Another counter was also busy at that time. As it was slightly further, so I thought it meant for checking out.  While I was waiting, I noticed guest who came in later than me was being served at this counter.  May be the hotel can arrange someone at the check-in counter to advise the guest when checking in. (This is the other hotel which I visited have done so.)

Some of the front desk staff doesn't speak English, which is absolutely unacceptable in Hilton. 
Now about the swimming pool. First time we came at 4 p.m. It was full with people, especially kids. There're only 4 deck chairs for the whole hotelü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. How can that be? So, we didn't have any place to sunbathe. If you want to see the empty pool and take a deck chair, you need to come in the morning, around 7:30 a.m. and don't forget about the cap.
The sauna was switched off, you can ask the staff to switch it on for you in advance. 
The breakfast was fine, but they ask you to wear a mask when you take the food, which is ridiculousü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I don't know, why this hotel is so overpriced and overrated, definitely not worth this money. 
The location is not that good too
If you want to have dinner (not a chinese style), you need to take a taxi. Or you can go to the Japanese restaurant on the second floor. 
The hotel's buffet is too expensive, the canteen doesn't look beautiful, so we didn't want to spend more than 200rmb per person.

The front desk staff also provided good service and gave us freshly made snacks (but I personally suggest that they should not be so sweet). You can see Baiyun Mountain, Zhongshan Memorial Hall and other attractions from the room window. The aunt in the housekeeping department is also very kind. I left my facial cleanser in the room when I checked out, and I came to pick it up in the early morning of the next night. The front desk and concierge staff who worked the night shift were also very friendly. Recommended to everyone

I didn‚Äôt like the breakfasts; when there was an influx of people who took part in the conference at this hotel, they swept everything away, but the food didn‚Äôt rise. The choice is poor. On the plus side, there is a good view from the window, you can see the Tower.

The male manager who checked in at the front desk looked very professional. The actual check-in night was very smooth. The overall lobby is also very good. , what was surprising was that the small cookies given by the hotel were very delicious, and they were still warm when you got them! I also bought a box when I left. Since I had called guest relations when I checked in, I arranged for a harder pillow in advance. After that, they also answered some of my little questions in the hotel and also provided information about where to eat, drink and have fun around the hotel. Good advice. The impression this hotel gave me is that the service is always online. This is a rare thing. Some newly opened hotels have very new facilities and equipment but lack this kind of gentle care. This is why I always prefer Hilton. One of the reasons for this brand, thanks again max and guest relations director

msg:The room was basically very satisfactory, and the arrangement was also the high floor I liked. However, it may be due to the Canton Fair + May Day holiday. Although I checked in at the hotel at more than 8 o'clock on the day of check-in, I just wanted a better view, but in the end there were not enough rooms. The view of the room I was given was not particularly good. A high-rise building opposite blocked it. Other hygiene, service, and location were very good. The child took a bath for 2 nights and was very happy and didn't want to leave.
Although we drove from Shenzhen, the location is excellent. It is very close to many attractions by taxi, and the taxi is basically the starting price. Don't consider driving in Guangzhou by yourself, the road is congested, and the parking fee is expensive. The welcome cookies given by the front desk lady are super liked by the children. They asked for them twice, which is great.
Small suggestions:
Children who are over 120 cm tall have to pay for breakfast. Can you give an option of bringing children with breakfast when launching the room, so that the experience is better.
In addition, I don't know if the sheets and bedding in the room are disinfected too much. After lying on the bed, my wife and I felt itchy. It may also be that our bodies are more sensitive. I hope to improve this aspect next time.

The lady at the front desk upgraded us to an executive twin room for free. We were upgraded directly on both days. This is great. Unfortunately, the weather was not good during the 2 days we stayed. Looking out the window, my waist looked hazy and beautiful üòÇ In addition, the children liked the cookies that were given. Director Xie and Xiaohui gave them to us before we left.

msg:Not bad. The location is relatively convenient. You can reach the Nanyue Palace Museum, Beijing Road Pedestrian Street, and Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall in a 10-minute walk. These are all nearby. There are two Starbucks, a 7-11, KFC, and a morning tea shop opposite the downstairs. (But I didn‚Äôt go. I booked the hotel‚Äôs breakfast and there was an egg I had never seen before.) The service is very good. We are 2 adults and 2 children. Four bottles of water are given every day. Cleaning the room is a daily routine, which feels very good. There is no problem with two 1.35-meter beds. For family travel, those with children and the elderly can consider it.

msg:An old five-star hotel with warm and courteous staff. I stayed in Guangzhou for five days and the transportation is very convenient. Online taxis responded quickly. I had a good rest every night when I returned to the hotel. I slept until I woke up naturally every day. The scenery in the beautiful room was very good. We had to catch a flight early on the last day. We originally wanted to stay in a regular room. When we went to the front desk to change rooms, the manager upgraded us and let us live in the original room with a beautiful view. We were pleasantly surprised. We will stay here again in the future when we go to Guangzhou.

msg:To be honest, the location of the hotel is quite far away. It is not as convenient as I said in the previous message. It takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to get to Beijing Road. ÔøºIn addition, the hotel's facilities are very dilapidated and cannot be called a five-star hotel. The most amount can only be three stars.
Breakfast is outrageous. Since we were a party of three, we had to pay extra for breakfast for one person, which cost about $150 per person. When we went to have breakfast, the hot dishes were basically cold. In addition, 70% of the food on the plate was already empty. Checked with the waiter and ignored it. Although we reported it to the front desk in the lobby and gave us a free dinner, in fact, the dinner situation was not so good that we went there.

I didn‚Äôt go to have breakfast again the next day. I originally hoped to pay more for breakfast so that I could have breakfast at the hotel before heading out, but it was really unsatisfactory. This trip is our first time staying at this hotel, but it may also be our last.

A hotel of such a big brand can actually provide this kind of service. Really disappointing.

msg:Bad review!!! The worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It's dirty, messy and has no service. This hotel is also suspected of illegal extortion. After we checked in, there was a mirror in the room. Because I turned around to pick up something, my bracelet lightly touched the mirror and the mirror broke (there are serious quality problems and they are not responsible for the safety of the guests). I cut my hand. We contacted the hotel immediately and told them that the mirror was broken and people were injured. The hotel didn't care about the injuries at all. We also felt that we were responsible for accidentally breaking the mirror, so we paid for the medical expenses to go to the hospital for disinfection and bandaging. I didn't expect that the hotel would directly deduct the deposit of 1,000 yuan the next day, and didn't return a cent. During this process, they never contacted us and directly deducted the money!!! I just don't understand. It's just a mirror, the cheapest kind with reflective paper on the back of the glass. They actually deducted 1,000 yuan without informing me. At night, I contacted the Ctrip platform, and the hotel actually **** said that we had to compensate 1,200 yuan for that mirror. My mobile number was on the check-in information. I had been in the hotel for more than 10 or 20 hours, but they didn't contact me or negotiate. The hotel actually told the platform that they couldn't contact me. Consumers suffered personal injuries in the hotel. No matter what the reason, the hotel should bear the responsibility. This is stipulated by law. However, this hotel actually ignored the injuries of the guests and didn't care about the injuries. It directly deducted the deposit. A broken mirror is extorting 1,200 yuan. Do you dare to stay in such a hotel? ? ? Such a hotel that ignores the personal safety of consumers and illegally deducts the deposit of guests without communication, do you dare to stay in it? ? ?

msg:I have stayed at DoubleTree by Hilton in many cities, and this one in Guangzhou made me very disappointed.
First, we took our children to stay in the end room. Later, we asked to change a few rooms. It may be because the fresh air ventilation facilities were old and the other rooms had a strong smell. Later, we chose the corner end room. The hotel explained that it was due to the weather in Guangzhou. But the other homes I stayed in later didn‚Äôt.
Secondly, the hotel is a 5-star hotel, but the details of the room facilities are not up to par. The TV in the bathroom cannot be displayed, and there are no basic facilities. There are no care packages, men's razors, disposable toilet mats, and bathtub bags. The experience is very poor.
The good thing is that the service staff has a good attitude

msg:Checking in at the lobby, the front desk said there was no reservation. No, I booked it on Ctrip a long time ago and quickly showed him the page. Hahaha, you booked the DoubleTree by Hilton Huihua, we are the DoubleTree by Hilton Guangzhou. It takes about 30 minutes to take a taxi from the two stores [laughing]. Don't worry, let's eat our freshly baked cookies first [doge]
I was dumbfounded all of a sudden. I had to run for more than 30 minutes. I was so tired. Fortunately, after explaining the situation to the hotel and Ctrip, they readily agreed to cancel the reservation and check in again.
The guest relations director of the hotel specially upgraded the room to a king-size bed room with unparalleled views, and also provided an extra breakfast and Venus at the front desk. Check-in was smooth and I was very happy. I called customer service and asked for two bottles of mineral water. Oh dear, I got three bottles at once. I couldn't help but think of the hotel I stayed in in a certain Central Plains area before, and it was repeatedly emphasized that one person should not exceed four bottles of water a day [In a daze]. During this period, I bothered that sweet little girl with many things, from sockets to bath towels and so on. All in all, it was smooth and happy.
I really have to praise this city and all the friendliness I encountered along the way.

Just scan the bike and go there to experience CITY WALK, Yuexiu Park and Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. It's nearby and can be reached on foot. The old town of Guangzhou is very close to anywhere you go.
The hotel staff are very friendly. They give you free chocolate biscuits when you check in. There are nuts in them. They taste good and are still warm in your hands. The entire check-in process was fast and efficient. Thanks to ANGIE and YANA for their help, I experienced Hilton's warm service.
There is a small shop in the hotel lobby and a hotel-operated sweet shop, which offers bread, desserts, coffee, drinks and Guangzhou specialty ice cream. It is very convenient to meet the needs of one-stop purchasing.
When traveling, I still prefer to stay in a better hotel. It is suitable in all aspects. I will choose your hotel next time~

The hotel facilities are older. The room has a slight smell and is relatively humid.
The front desk staff was very helpful when checking in.
But I was slightly unhappy on the day of departure.
Although it has been solved, I think as a hotel that emphasizes flexibility, your hotel can consider adding more flexible operation training for employees.

The disadvantages are that it has been open for a long time, the facilities are old, and the surrounding area is an old city. The scenery is not very good. All you can see in the beautiful room are old houses. The hair dryer in the room needs to be pressed by hand to use it. It will automatically stop after a few minutes and must wait for the heat to dissipate before it can be used again. The best thing is that the service is good and very considerate. Room attendant Shi Lisa took the initiative to discover problems and solved them in a timely manner, which is worthy of recognition.

msg:This DoubleTree by Hilton hotel has an excellent location, located in the old city, with complete commercial and living facilities, making travel and dining very convenient. The hotel staff are very attentive, professional and courteous in their words and deeds.

However, what I really want to complain about is that the facilities in the hotel rooms are a bit outdated. One of the two rooms I booked has obvious moisture. Mold stains are scattered in the corners and ceilings. There is a musty smell when entering and the air-conditioning exhaust system remains for a long time after it is turned on. It does not disperse, and even worse, there are occasional traces of tiny insects on the table.

Finally, there are doubts about whether the communication between Ctrip and the hotel is in place and smooth. It was clearly stated during the reservation that the need for adjacent or opposite rooms was confirmed, but upon check-in it was discovered that this requirement had not been fulfilled. This should be actively improved in the future.

When I checked in, I changed rooms three times. There was a particularly strong smell of cigarette smoke in one room. Then I changed it again, and found that the air conditioner in the room was dripping continuously, and the yellow stains in the shower room in the bathroom had not been cleaned. When checking out, the front desk said that it must be praised. . . Speechless

Thank you from the hotel. Very impressive reception
The hotel room is very comfortable and spacious. The little ones were very happy as soon as they checked in. They also prepared extra food, a water basin and a den for my puppy. They were very considerate.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay. I will still choose DoubleTree by Hilton Guangzhou next time I come to Guangzhou.

The hotel room is very comfortable. Among the nearby hotels within 500, this one is the most suitable. There are dedicated parking spaces.
There are also Internet celebrity restaurants nearby, and the time is tight.

The hygiene management of the hotel is goodüëç. Unfortunately, the body fat scale cannot be used, and the battery will not work.

Next time I bring my fur kids over to try.

msg:The service staff from the concierge to the front desk are very good, but the service of the check-in staff needs to be improved, because when we called at night, no one answered the phone, and we were asked to swipe our card from the 34th floor to the 1st floor to talk to the front desk... The hygiene and facilities are really poor. There are hairs on the bed. The hair conditioner in the bathroom is not new. I squeezed it twice and it disappeared. I thought there was a charging place next to the bed. I wanted to use my phone while charging, but it was not plugged in. For electricity, you have to go to the desk to charge, which is very inconvenient. There is no water supply in the room, and you need to pay a deposit when you go:((Originally, the trip customer service said that you only need to pay a one-night deposit when you arrive, but when you arrived at the site , and I had to pay an extra 800 deposit. Although I paid it back in the end, I felt very bad). If it weren‚Äôt for the great service attitude of the concierge at the back, the service quality would really be 1-2 points...

He seemed very impatient when asking about other hotel facilities. He said a few words in a hurry and served the guests behind him without paying attention to whether we heard him or not. Maybe it was because the guests at the back were the VIP version after all, they were talking and laughing, and they had a totally different attitude towards me. We are all guests in the hotel, so why should we be treated differently? I thought about it for several days and still couldn't figure it out. Maybe it's because I'm not lovable, or because I have a face that makes people easy to bully.
Hotels in big cities are just different. At least I have never been treated differently in other five-star hotels.

There was a large glass bottle of Evian with a price tag of 60. I hurriedly put it away in case my children would break it. There is a charge for everything in the refrigerator. There are not many five-star hotels that charge for it nowadays. I asked for a child's toothbrush, but it didn't even come with toothpaste. If I order a takeaway, other hotels either have waiters or robots to help deliver it. This hotel has to order it myself. Upstairs, it was on the 30th or 40th floor. I ran downstairs with my kids to get takeaways and found a robot at the door. I asked the doorman if the robot could help deliver the food next time. He told me to call their manager, and I accepted it. ,

msg:Come to Guangzhou, Shunde, Foshan, and Zhongshan with friends. The last stop is Guangzhou! Because we are eating and eating, we did not choose Tianhe District but chose Yuexiu District, which has more delicious food.
My friend and I hit it off and chose this hotel firmly
One is that it is very close to Beijing Road Pedestrian Street, and there are many good and delicious restaurants around
The second is that the classic hotel must be reliable
There is nothing wrong with the choice. Although I only stayed for one day, the experience was very good. Ms. Joyce was very friendly from the moment I checked in, and she would tell us in detail. If you are driving by yourself, you can register your license plate at the welcome desk. It will remind us that if you want to take out food, you need to bring your own door card.
They also gave us small snacks, which was a pleasant surprise, the cookies were baked deliciously, very American
They also kindly upgraded our room.
This is the night scene I took. Although there is no P picture, you can still see the gorgeous night in Guangzhou. You can also see Xiaoman‚Äôs waist from the window of the room.
A small suggestion is that the decoration of the hotel is still relatively old-fashioned, there is no USB port for the socket, and there is only one socket at the head of the bed, there will be a little shortage
Everything else is really good, the bathroom is also very clean
There is a small detail that makes me feel very good about this hotel. I checked in earlier. At that time, the aunt had just cleaned it. Then someone knocked on the door after a while and found that it was the inspector of the housekeeping. He told me, If the auntie finishes cleaning, they will usually conduct a second inspection. I didn't expect that there would be guests checking in so soon. I immediately felt that this was really professional and I felt very at ease.
If I come to Guangzhou again in the future, I think this hotel will still be considered

I just moved to this hotel from the Asia International Hotel the day before. The room facilities are much better than that hotel. With large glass windows, you can see Guangzhou at night night scene. Thank you very much, Director Xiao Xie, who helped me check in and gave me a free breakfastüòäThere are many types of breakfast, and the taste is also very good. I would like to make a small suggestion, that is, there is no Cantonese tea for breakfast.

After verifying the order, I was told that there were no twin beds available today. I checked Ctrip and found that the twin beds were still on sale today, and I was sure they were twin beds. Then I was told that there were twin beds again. They said they upgraded the floor for me. After applying for the room card, I found that the floor was also within the floor where I ordered and had not been upgraded.
The bedding felt damp and the toiletries were very poor. They were similar to those in ordinary fast hotels. The room size was not large. I feel that apart from the price, the quality and service do not match the usual Hilton. I will not choose this Hilton again next time.

The hotel feels that the facilities are quite old, the aisles are narrow and low, quite depressing, and the colors of the furniture and doors are quite outdated. Maybe because it is the rainy season, the room has a bad smell.
The breakfast seems to have a lot of varieties, but there are not many delicious ones, especially the western ones, which taste too ordinary.

The service is really good and the location is very good. It is very close to Beijing Road Pedestrian Street and Zhongshan Park. When we arrived, it was a bit inconvenient to take a taxi. It was a long way to the front and turned around. It was also a little far away from the subway station. The receptionist at the entrance of the hall and the receptionist at the front desk had very good professionalism. When we checked in, the person who opened the door for us was very handsome. The uncle at the front desk is a very beautiful girl (I checked in on the afternoon of the 7th, and a guest living in 3612 accidentally lost the business card she gave me, and her service is very good, as if she was the foreman at the front desk that day) The aunt in the housekeeping depar**ent who gave us hot chocolate chip cookies was also very polite. I asked her if she could give me two bottles of mineral water, and she said, tell me the room number, and I will get it for you right away and deliver it to you. When I checked out of the room today, I was very considerate and gave a small gift, a very beautiful small card bag. Thank you very much, Mr. Xie, for your greetings, very considerate. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay experience

msg:When traveling abroad, you still have to choose the Hilton Hotel. DoubleTree by Hilton Guangzhou is located in a superior location, very close to Yuexiu Park and Beijing Road Pedestrian Street. The facilities are not modern, but it is understandable. It is an old-fashioned famous store. Whether it is the receptionist at the entrance of the lobby or the receptionist at the front desk, they all have good professionalism and are very proactive! The variety of breakfast is quite rich, but I feel that the grade is not enough. There are stains on the base of the cold water pipe in the bathroom, which needs to be cleaned carefully with a small brush. The sewer pipe of the toilet has old marks of urine stains, and the surface of the rest is very shiny.

msg:The front desk called me to confirm before check-in, and according to my request, the manager Xiao Xie at the front desk upgraded the room type for free, arranged it as a honeymoon bed, and helped us deliver the luggage in person. The service exceeded expectations and was great. The proposed view room with a small waist view was also satisfied. I am very happy. Although the hotel is old, it is very clean. I would like to make a suggestion to improve the service quality of the cleaning staff. Because of our negligence, we forgot to press the cleaning button on the wall. We only found out when we came back from the trip at night. After confirming with the front desk that the room can be cleaned, the cleaning staff wrote an essay on where we need to clean after entering the room. I'm about to leave work, and I want to urge the guests to clean up. Hope not to hear this kind of conversation next time. The hotel industry is an industry that provides 24-hour thoughtful service. I hope that as a hotel under Hilton, it will not ruin Hilton's reputation. It is hoped that the on-the-job training and communication skills training of cleaning staff will be strengthened.

However, there are a few flaws. If you take a taxi from west to east, or from south to north to get to the hotel, you have to go far in front to make a U-turn, and the subway is a bit far away. The room lighting control system is too centralized, and there is no smart toilet. It is a bit cold in winter. Everything else is ok.

When we arrived at the hotel to check in, we were unable to check in because the previous guest checked out late. However, the front desk sent a dining coupon in the lobby to let us know. The executive room includes afternoon tea and dinner, so we took the temporary card and went to the 39th floor for afternoon tea (a small buffet). During the process, a very gentle front desk staff sent over the issued room card. The room can see the Canton Tower at night. The customer service is very good, fast, gentle and polite! The buffet breakfast is also good. There are freshly made porridge and rice rolls, which is very down-to-earth! ! There is a lot of passenger flow. There is a little lack of communication between the front desk and the restaurant. The other purchased breakfast is not displayed. Let us eat first and then solve it. Then the relationship director came to help, expressed the hotel's inconsiderateness and apology, and sent a practical note. Overall the service is really good! clean! Environmental facilities should have!

But only for the use of swimming pool facilities

I chose this hotel because of the swimming pool. I knew I had to go to the swimming pool check-in counter and ask for a swimming cap before I could swim. I just wanted to stay and play in the water, so I didn‚Äôt expect to bring a swimming cap. I also didn‚Äôt want to waste money on buying it from the hotel, which would end up not being able to swim. water.

I think if it is required to wear a swimming cap and get into the water first, it should be clearly stated in the hotel introduction/needs-to-know column.

Anyway, there is nothing to fault in other aspects, especially the gym, which has all the equipment. It is worth staying.

The introduction of this Hilton on Ctrip is very clear, and since it is Doubletree Hilton, I don't have much expectations. It is completely understandable that the room is old and dry everywhere, and I don't care about the spots on the bathroom glass. However, the alarm clock in the room went off at 7am without my knowledge. I'm not on a business trip, I don't need it and I didn't mention the wake-up service. Why is there a ghost alarm clock in the room that rings at 7 o'clock? ? ?

Secondly, after I left the store, a hotel customer service added me on WeChat, but they didn't say a word. I want to know why you add me if you are so deep? What is your customer service doing?

I came here on weekends for a short stay. The receptionist Qingqing was very warm and polite. Everyone who checked in was given a freshly baked cookie. The room was clean, tidy and comfortable, with a beautiful view of the city.
The executive lounge on the 39th floor is also a good place to watch the beautiful scenery. It is open from 6 to 22 o'clock and happy hour from 18 to 20 o'clock in the evening. Simple hot food is provided, and the variety is quite rich. The service staff of the lounge, Winnie, Rachel, and Kiki, provide meticulous service, respond to customers' needs in a timely manner, and pack things very diligently.
Fitness and swimming are on the 8th floor. There is a dry and wet sauna room in the locker room. You can come to exercise, swim, and relax in the sauna.
The breakfast the next morning was in the restaurant on the 2nd floor. The buffet breakfast had a lot of choices and was very filling, and the direct lunch was also saved.
Overall service and environment are satisfied.

I called the front desk and they said they would follow up. After another 20 minutes, there was still no meal. I called the front desk and they replied that the restaurant had not received the order. I transferred the call to the restaurant, and the restaurant said that the system had not received it. They also said that the front desk had sent it and it could be made immediately. I asked how long it would take, and they replied that it would take 40 minutes. This is the speed of a salad, a cake and a sandwich. I won't comment, but share it for your reference. I just want to say that the most unsatisfactory thing is that this system seems to be not part of their service. There are problems with the system, which affects the guests, and they have not taken any remedial measures. They found that they could not receive the order and did not take the initiative to tell the guests. At the end of the story, I want to say that if you are hungry, order takeout, and Capone will make it now and deliver it directly to the hotel door in 30 minutes. It is much faster than doing it in the hotel.

msg:This is the only negative review I have ever received from a hotel in the past 10 years. In the past, I would never give a negative review to any hotel as long as it was not excessive. First: the smell in the lobby is too strong, it's just the fragrance sprayed by cheap chemical synthesis agents. Second: The smell of smoke in the room was too strong. As soon as I opened the door, a strong smell of smoke hit my nose. For the sake of my health, I immediately went to the front desk and asked to change rooms. However, the answer given by the front desk was that there were no rooms anymore, so I had to find someone to spray some air. Freshener, after being rejected by us, we were told to discuss it with the manager. Third: We were asked to drag our luggage from the 34th floor to the 30th floor at around 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by the pungent smell of chemical synthetic agents. We also asked the hotel staff to smell it, but the hotel staff still refused. Answer: We have no spare rooms. Do you believe it? A hotel with more than 30 floors actually has no rooms. You won‚Äôt believe it anyway. In this way, there are only two choices, either A smoke room or B chemical air room. How to choose? It was already past 11 o'clock and we were exhausted after a day's travel. We thought about choosing A and were forced to smoke nicotine all night (we are two women who have never smoked, and the male in the family does not smoke either). For us, Speaking is a kind of torture, not to mention that Yang Kang's back lungs are already fragile. It is really a physical and mental torture, so much so that the next day he feels that the smoke in his nose is difficult to dissipate. Fourth: The hotel called again in the middle of the night and offered a plan of free airport transfer or breakfast. However, we rented a car and drove here, and maybe the breakfast was just to try Guangzhou morning tea. The solution proposed by the hotel could not solve our demands at all. In fact, we only need to change to a room with no peculiar smell. Why did the hotel change us to a room with air freshener when we made our request and clearly stated that we should not spray air freshener? What about the agent's room? Don't I speak Chinese? This is what makes me most angry. Have you ever considered the health of your customers? Have you ever considered the pain of dragging suitcases up and down when customers are physically and mentally exhausted? This is the worst hotel experience I've ever had. If there is a choice of 0 points, I will never choose 1

Then I started calling in the room, but couldn't get through. The two of them went down to the front desk in turn, saying that there was no room. The stench coming out of the carpet really feels like the hotel just collects the money and doesn't care about the follow-up. Hilton Hamptons are better than this. It is said that it is a gift of cookies, and I also packed a few pieces. The family of friends who booked together have not yet received it.

msg:First of all, I am still satisfied with this place and this facility at this price, but the package I booked stated that I could check in early, indicating that I could check in at nine o'clock in the morning. As a result, I went to the hotel after ten o'clock and was told that there was no room yet. , to check in at 12 noon. This is not false advertising. The second problem is that when I checked into the room, because my package included breakfast, the staff did not take the initiative to tell me where to eat in the morning. Third, the laundry service is not collected at night, but when the waiter knocks on the door when we are still resting at eleven in the morning? This logic doesn't make sense. I'll just stay for one night and pick up my clothes to wash before I check out in the morning. Shouldn't we be told to wait for you to finish washing before leaving? I personally feel that it is inappropriate to disturb customers to rest in this way. In the end, if you were a general budget hotel, I wouldn't ask for that much. Anyway, you are also joining Hilton. In this way, I can only doubt the brand of Hilton Hotel and the ability of its hotel management team.

When I checked in, I didn't see any welcome cookies. My husband gave me a double bed room. I said if I could change the big bed with my child and told me that the price was different, it didn't matter. Then the man next to him was making a noise and changed the big bed room... ... speechless... Then I found that the bed could be shared when I got to the roomüò• When I was staying in another hotel, people would ask me if I needed to share the bed? This is the difference!
After staying in such a big hotel, there is no welcome fruit, even an apple, and then I saw a half bottle of mineral water on the windowsill in the deepest part of the curtain. I may not know which customer has the rest...
I can't find a pocket in the room and can't find anything. It's all Coke Sprite 20 for a fee. As soon as I heard that I asked for a pocket, the cleaning gave me a used pocket... It looks disgusting. I said you can give me a new one. gave...
The child's doll landed in the hotel. Call the hotel at 20:30. I called the hotel three times and no one answered! ! ! ! The fourth time I answered, I asked, "Why did it take so long to answer the phone?" He didn't answer me, pretended not to hear, and asked me what was wrong
You are too embarrassed to be called Hilton? ? I travel with my children five times a year, and I stay in not too many hotels, but not too many hotels. This experience made me feel quite disappointed, and I will not stay again! Everyone take precautions

The takeout is placed outside at the entrance of the underground parking lot. If it rains heavily, you will be exhausted if you don't get soaked to death. Walked around a lot to get it.
3. The front desk service is like they owe you 10,000 yuan. The service of this kind of hotel is not as good as that of a hotel.
4. As a service industry, hotels are meant to better serve guests. We pay for your services, but when we pick up the car, we have to go to the door to report the license plate number. Is your front desk so delicate? Are your legs worthless? If you go to this hotel once, you won't go there a second time.
5. I paid the room fee for two days. After staying for one day, they asked me if I wanted to check out the next day. What did you guys say?
6. I asked which floor breakfast was on. When I came up, I impatiently told me that it was on the second floor. If there is breakfast in your room, it will be there. If not, there will be none. Why, is it so difficult for you to tell me? I don't know if I have breakfast. Even if I don't, what's the matter? Shouldn't you tell me? Are you a guest or am I a guest?
There are so many hotels in Guangzhou. Since I have chosen you, you should cherish it, so that you will close sooner or later.

msg:Every time I come to Guangzhou on business, I choose Hilton to stay. I have to say that this is the worst time I have ever stayed. First of all, I would like to thank the front desk for helping me upgrade the room for free, but the problem is also coming:
üßπHygienic: First of all, two bugs were found in the bath towel in the room (pictured), which is really terrifying. Secondly, the bathrobe in the room is ridiculously black. Is it because it hasn't been washed for too long? It is in sharp contrast with the white bed sheets (I forgot to take pictures here).
üçÉEnvironment: In addition, the light in the shower room is too dim, and the air conditioner in the room is not hot enough. It still has no cooling effect when it is adjusted to 18 degrees. The outside corridor is much cooler than the room, and the whole room is stuffy and hot. Since I was too late and tired when I checked in, there was no room change or complaint.
üîîService: The last thing I complained about was that I had to go to the concierge to scan the code and enter the license plate by myself. After staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I have encountered this. Isn't it all right to call and report the license plate? I stayed in room 3209. I really trouble your hotel to check the room facilities carefully. As for whether to choose Hilton next time, I really have to think about it.

The entrance is the main road of Dongfeng Road, with convenient transportation, adjacent to the provincial government and municipal party committee, and there is no need to say about public security.
The high-rise scenery is very good, the buildings are scaled with each other, the Huaguoshan TV Tower is overlooked in the north, the cbd is small in the south, and the panoramic view of Greater Guangzhou, the weather is a bit hazy.
The best experience is that Susan Xiaoli from the guest relationship follows up the whole process and is very responsible.

The service in the lobby is warm, courteous and efficient, especially Ameng, the guy at the front desk. After learning that the room type needed was full due to late check-in, he gave a room upgrade and gave a warm reminder. He was very thoughtful and meticulous, making people feel at home, which is worthy of praise. The fly in the oin**ent is that the TV memory in the room is too old and outdated, and there is basically no selectivity and readability. I hope the hotel can improve and update this aspect. Overall, the stay experience is good, the price is high, and it is worth recommending.

msg:1. The identification of the phone is not obvious (it is recommended to replace all the phones, the unobvious part is: because the keys of each hotel are not the same, so the guests do not know which is the customer service center)
2. The ceiling, I suggest you lie on the bed and have a look, it is all dirty
3. There is hair on the top of the bathtub in the bathroom, and the concave part, and the surrounding of the bathtub is dirty, so that the bathtub cover I bought for 20 yuan is useless (because I am not in the mood to soak)
4. The parking space, lobby and service also greatly reduced my experience. I don‚Äôt know if all the hotel services in the provincial capital are like this? There is no comparison yet, please combine the five-star hotels in Shenzhen to improve the service in the store and check the deficiencies by yourself!
May: The above suggestions can help you, thank you [rose]
