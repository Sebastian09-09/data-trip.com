There is a subway station downstairs. Whether it is a business trip or a leisure vacation, this is an ideal choice.

The service staff are polite and enthusiastic, and always smile. Whether it is front desk reception, room service or restaurant dining, they can be meticulous and meet my every need in a timely manner. This feeling of being at home is really unforgettable.
I personally have very high requirements for hotel hygiene. This time I was quite surprised by the cleanliness and tidiness of the hotel. The housekeeper who cleaned the room for me was also very attentive and helped to tidy up the room every day. I will definitely choose this hotel again when I come to Changsha next time [love]

There is a rest area on the side of the guest room, and the lights are not turned on. There are many chairs. If you are alone, you will feel scared.

Because of work reasons, I need to check out one day in advance, but the hotel said that it cannot be refunded, and it is not possible to pay compensation. I also understand that it is just to make money during the May Day holiday. Changsha is such a good city, I have to come more times, and this hotel is also very good.

The staff who came to deal with it were very polite. The management who came to solve the problem later was also very efficient. I didn't pay attention to the name of the management, but he was a man with curved eyes when he smiled. He spoke very politely, had a high EQ, and a really good attitude. The concierge who was wearing glasses and a little fat later also introduced the attractions and routes to me and my mother very professionally. Next time I come to Changsha, I will choose Jinmao!

I forgot my lipstick in the room, and the staff called me promptly and sent it to my home by SF Express. I gave it a thumbs up. It was just that the weather was not good.

You can see people walking and jogging in the morning and evening. It is very suitable for leisure and vacation, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The room was upgraded to a lake view room, but it was because I booked another twin room on the Marriott app for the same day, and there was no upgrade to a higher-level room, so I was upgraded to this Ctrip room with a double bed.
The room overlooks the entire rooftop of the Art Center
The facilities are standard. I have always liked the Namaran in the Luxury room.
The service needs to be improved. It is not on the same level as the Luxury hotels I have stayed in in Hangzhou and Nanjing.

For a family vacation, I felt that it was luxurious and comprehensive, as well as caring and warm humanized service. From the check-in at the front desk, they took great care. First of all, they arranged a non-smoking floor to take care of the family trip. Secondly, the room only included breakfast for two people, and they gave children breakfast attentively. The room also prepared children's slippers and toiletries. In addition, the staff gave tickets to the cute pet park on the third floor while waiting for the meal in the buffet restaurant, which not only killed time but also added fun. The hotel room has a wide view and overlooks the Meixi Lake area. I slept very well at night. The bedding is also soft and clean. The mattress is very supportive and I don't have back pain when I sleep. I went to the infinity pool, the facilities are also good, and I can swim while enjoying Zaha's masterpiece Meixi Lake Art Center. It's great. The breakfast is nice, and it's also nice to take a walk around the hotel in my spare time. I want to say too much: let's make it a five-star praise! PS: The hotel can be directly connected to Jinmao Lanxiu City Shopping Center, don't be too convenient

Although the transportation is a bit far from the bustling urban area, a taxi only costs less than 20 yuan for 10 kilometers, which is still acceptable.

There are many types of breakfast, both Chinese and Western, and the taste is okay. There are also Hunan-style rice noodles that you can try.
The lady at the front desk serves with a smile and has a very good attitude. As long as you ask for help, she will basically guide you in person.

msg:I chose to travel to Changsha during the Chinese New Year and spent half a day at Meixi Lake Jinmao. Facts have proved that I made the right choice.
First of all, the hotel is located along the subway line, with the back of Lanxiu City. There are tea shops, Chef Fei, Chuiyan, and various food, drink, entertainment, supermarkets and noodle shops. This shopping mall is quite big. The room is not small, the bed is quite big, and the interior is very clean. You can see Yuelu Mountain and Meixi Lake Park outside the window. As a girl from Meixi Lake, I was shocked to see the Meixi Lake Grand Theater. It was bigger than I expected. Overall, I had a good sleep.
Secondly, the service attitude is excellent. Whether it is the lady at the front desk, the boy at the luggage counter, or the beauty in the restaurant, or even the room staff and maintenance staff, they all have a good attitude and will take the initiative to say hello. During the Chinese New Year, I will respond to my requests and do my best to meet my requests. For example, if I want chopsticks, they will be given to me very late. When my children want to take a bath, the aunt in the guest room will go out of their way to bring us bath tape and bubble bath liquid, and also bring snacks and candies to the little friends. The child wanted to see the robot and asked the robot to deliver takeout once. Even if the WIFI in my father's room is not connected, the maintenance depar**ent staff will come specially to help them. I'm still very touched. This customer-oriented attitude makes people very comfortable. Thumbs up for them.
Finally, if I have to pick a fault, it is that the air conditioner in the room is really hot. The little brother also brought us a fan. It is a unique feeling to blow the fan in the winter. Hahahaha. Anyway, I am very satisfied. I stayed here for three days and I felt comfortable every day. Thank you to this hotel for your persistence during the Spring Festival. Thank you for your hard work. Happy New Year!

The hotel room is large in size, but the service and design details of the state-owned hotel brand are indeed a bit lacking. However, for a hotel priced at about 1,000 yuan, the price/performance ratio is relatively high. It is worth mentioning that the luggage room in the room is very large, and two suitcases can be opened without any pressure.

I booked a lake view room, which was very photogenic, and all the photos I checked in were wonderful.
Adjacent to the Meixi Lake International Culture and Art Center, the art center has a spectacular musical fountain every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. It is 2 kilometers away from Meixi Lake City Island, a good place for leisure and check-in. Opposite the hotel is Meixi Lake Festival Island, which is a good place to bring children and the best choice for fitness people to run in the morning. The transportation to Yuelu Mountain and Juzizhou is convenient, and taking a taxi is cost-effective for families.
The hotel has all the facilities, the room service is timely and enthusiastic, the cleaning is very considerate, and even your scattered clothes will be sorted and put away for you. Whether it is a corridor carpet or a room carpet, it is comfortable and clean, and feels great when you step on it with bare feet. Since we were staying with three people, we informed the front desk that art supplies were placed for three people on the first day, and then they were automatically placed for three people. An extra bag of paper towels was also placed in case there were not enough. It was very considerate and friendly to me.
The most surprising thing this time is the food at Taoyuan Chinese Restaurant in the hotel. There is no need to go outside the hotel to find food. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant have unique taste, fresh ingredients and rich ingredients. They also come with eight-treasure rice and fruit platter, which adds another 1 to the favorability score.

The twin room we booked was upgraded to a parent-child room for free. The kids liked it so much that they offered to live in the tent themselves. Opened up new ideas for bed separation.
The braised pickles for breakfast are pretty good. The preserved egg and lean meat porridge is a bit fishy.
The swimming pool is super awesome, and the children's pool is warm water, which is very suitable for children to swim.

msg:I wanted to come to the Meixi Lake Art Center for a concert, so I chose the Meixi Lake Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel, which is close to the art center. The hotel is connected to a shopping mall, which is more convenient for shopping and dining. One of the exits of the shopping mall is the entrance to the Art Center Station of Metro Line 2, which can be said to be quite convenient for travel. Check-in is one-to-one, you need to swipe your room card to use the elevator, and takeaways are delivered to your room by robots, which is safe and convenient. The room is generally good, from the size to the lake view outside the window, but it is a bit old after all, and some facilities are relatively old, such as a small hole in the hand towel, and the faucet of the washbasin has a bit of black magazine when the water first comes out, which is needed Let it go for a while and wait. The overall feeling is good, a satisfactory stay experience.

The most obvious thing is that the hygiene is not clean (the sink, table, walls and windows are all dirty), and the shower rod in the bathroom is broken... The sound insulation effect is also very poor, and people in the next room are talking early in the morning. Wake up with noise...
The only thing that remains is that the service attitude is very good. The only happy place.
I really hope to do some hygiene and snacks.

In addition, the hotel's encounter supplies come in large bottles and are locked.

The location of the hotel is very good, next to Meixi Lake, with a park downstairs, and the lobby directly leads to Jinmaohui Commercial Complex (there are 2 tea shops, please pay attention to the location when placing an order)
I stayed in a 180-degree lake view room and could see the fountain show at night. However, it has been hazy recently and the visibility is very low, which is a pity. The supplies are all BYREDO, and they smell very good, but the body lotion is a bit watery and not easy to absorb.
There is happy hour in the lobby bar on the first floor. The environment and food are both good.
There were quite a lot of people at breakfast, the flow was a bit messy, and the food was not great. It looked like the whole table was covered, but in fact there were not many choices.
There is a row full of porridge (preserved egg and lean meat porridge, millet porridge, oa**eal porridge, white porridge...)
There is a row full of eggs (hot spring eggs, single-sided fried eggs, double-sided fried eggs, hard-boiled eggs, tea eggs...)

The first feeling I felt when entering the hotel was that it was cold. The lobby and rooms were very cold. The hotel kept saying that the air conditioning temperature was controlled by the building management and they had no way to adjust it. The waiter said that it was cold and they could send a heater. But I should have turned up the temperature of the central air conditioner the next day, and I felt much better.
It has been open for 7 or 8 years and the facilities are a bit old. The refrigerator in the room didn't work. After reporting it to the front desk, we changed the room, but it still didn't cool, so I didn't bother to change it in the end. The hotel's views and services are always online, which is why you choose the Luxury Collection.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with everything you need. The raw porridge tastes good.

The beautiful woman at the front desk who checked in also had a very good attitude, and I will be there every time when I drag my suitcase. The staff took the initiative to help, which was very satisfying.
The dissatisfaction points are that firstly, the hotel floor towels are small and the color of the floor tiles is so dark that it is difficult to see the water stains. I slipped and fell; secondly, the waiters frequently disturbed me. I only stayed for one night and knocked on the door twice to ask if Cleaning is indeed thoughtful but not necessary. Guests will ask for it if needed.
In fact, it's not a big deal. I didn't care too much. I just made a small comment to the front desk when I checked out. As a result, the feedback from the waiter was not to accept or comfort me, but "I won't bother you to write a review." ". I didn't understand it at first, but she repeated it twice and I understood it. She just didn't want me to write a bad review about the hotel.
I was so shocked that I didn’t know what to say, so let me write a review. Is this how hotels handle customer feedback? Don’t let customers leave reviews? The follow-up was quite professional and I quickly received a call from the hotel to at least express my apology.
I didn't bother with the hotel, and I didn't plan to write any reviews. However, the waiter should not respond promptly to the guests' opinions, but at least show a positive attitude. Not to mention that my knees were swollen from falling in the hotel bathroom. Her first reaction was to ask the guests not to write reviews. This is outrageous. The employee's words are enough to affect the good impression of the guests. I hope the hotel will strengthen its management and prevent such things that are inconsistent with the hotel's image from happening again.

I was asked to go to another seat when someone occupied my seat, instead of giving up the seat to the person who occupied the wrong seat.

The entire design corresponds to a theater, but unfortunately there is an office building outside the glass window of the room. You can only see a little bit of the hibiscus flower building top of the Grand Theater to the right. There is a large shopping mall next to it, which is very convenient for traveling to eat and drink.

msg:It is worthy of being the No. 1 family hotel in Changsha and is well worth a stay. The location is excellent, with subway and shopping malls nearby. We stayed in an open-plan suite with a 270° panoramic view. The floor is very high and has a wide view, allowing you to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Meixi Lake. The bathtub next to the window is great, and there is a screen on the wall that can be played simultaneously with the TV.

The room area is 69 square meters, the space setting is very reasonable, and the sound insulation is relatively good. Breakfast is on the first floor of the hotel. The Chinese and Western meals are very rich. I am so full that I don’t want to eat lunch. His large swimming pool is on the third floor of the hotel. It is a major feature of his home. It has an excellent view and can see the modern art center. The best thing is that the first floor of the hotel has direct access to the large shopping mall in Xiucheng, so there is no need to worry about starving to death.

The lady arranged our luggage properly and gave us a breakfast. We went out to eat. After dinner, when we returned to the hotel, our luggage had already been delivered to the room by the concierge. The turndown service was also in place. Takeaways were delivered to the room by robots. The concierge also helped put the boxes in the car when leaving.

There are many, the taste is good, and there are some small incidents in the middle, and they can be responded to and solved in time. I will stay here again next time I come to Changsha.
The only thing I'm not satisfied with is that the pillow is too soft and I can't sleep well.

The glass in the room is so beautiful for taking pictures! In addition, transportation and dining are very convenient. The first floor is directly connected to the shopping mall. There are two tea shops in the shopping mall, and you can taste many famous Hunan cuisine chain stores! This hotel will still be my first choice when traveling to Changsha in the future!

The location of the hotel is convenient. There is a shopping mall downstairs. It is very convenient to eat and shop. Passing through the mall is Metro Line 2, which directly leads to Yuelu Mountain, Orange Island, Wuyi Square. The high-speed rail station is very convenient. There are not many people on the station, and there are basically seats.
The room is large, with a bathtub and shower, so you can go out and play for a day and take a bath to relieve your fatigue. We are a family of three staying with an extra bed, the mattress of the extra bed is very comfortable! A little disadvantage is the room service. The cups used the day before were not washed on the table, which does not meet the five-star standard.
The breakfast at the hotel is very good, with rich varieties of Chinese and Western styles and good quality
In Changsha in August, it is still very hot outside during the daytime. Swimming in the hotel during the daytime, and there is a sauna by the pool. It is a good choice to go to the city center in the evening.

That is, three Haagen-Dazs balls are really insincere, so small that there are three in a small cup, which is 100 yuan less than the price without ice cream.

Jinmao Gemini has a very good view, overlooking Meixi Lake and the Art Center. Go to the opposite Grand Theater to watch a performance, just across the road. My daughter left her bag on the restaurant seat during breakfast at the hotel. There were documents and wallets in it. It took me a long time to play before I remembered it. I was lucky to be collected by the hotel staff. I checked my identity and items and returned them quickly. I would like to give a thumbs up to all the hotel staff who took the money away. Special thanks to the beautiful person in the lobby who took me to find the bag Miss Lisa Huang Niannian asked me about any problems I encountered and took me to find them immediately, which made me feel at ease.

msg:I will not stay in this hotel for the second time. This is not a hotel that takes service as its purpose. It is a hotel that reveals calculations and schemes everywhere. Let me comment slowly. 1. The dessert stall at the check-in entrance faces the front desk, because you have to go through the stall to check in and check out. Especially when children see it, they all want to try ice cream. Obviously, there are many people checking in and out at the front desk, and there are many people coming and going, and it is noisy. You still have to run this stall. You can put the stall on the other side. If you want a quiet vacation, you will be disappointed before you check in. 2. There is really nothing worth eating for breakfast except coffee. Vegetarians can eat it. The only good rice noodles, beef brisket and radish are placed in a corner without lights. If you don’t look carefully, no one can see it clearly. The fruit is speechless. The cheap watermelon and dragon fruit that can be eaten are limited. There are only two plates, which are often empty, so you have to choose other unpalatable ones. Other fruits are not sliced. They are all big and unintentional. Many people don’t eat them. This is not the problem of the waiter, but the problem of business philosophy. If you are sincere, you can put 2 plates for each fruit with a high empty plate rate. If one plate is empty, you can change it immediately, at least the supply will not be cut off. It is not the problem of the waiter at the restaurant fruit stand, but the problem of the planner behind it. 3. The parent-child cute park is speechless. First, you are introduced to the door, and then various charges are charged, such as feeding small animals and charging for amusement facilities. This is not a parent-child hotel, but a large-scale paid entertainment city. 4. The coffee in the room is very **. If I want to drink coffee, I have a headache when I unpack it first, and it is even more difficult to make coffee. Generally, I am not a coffee lover, so I give up. The hotel saves money on consumables. I don’t like this kind of scheming hotel. 5. To say something good, the waiters are working very hard and are very polite, but if it exceeds their service capabilities, they will decisively refuse. At the same time, it reflects that the service concept of this hotel is superficial and does not really solve the real needs of the guests. 6. The environment and facilities are good, the room is large, the bathroom is wide and comfortable. There are many shopping malls around and food.

msg:Before coming to Changsha, I saw many hotels on Ctrip, and finally chose this one. Several reasons: Marriott’s Luxury Collection brand is relatively small in China. I haven’t seen it in other cities before. Changsha has it, so I want to try it Take a look; among hotels of similar grades, Changsha Luxury Collection is more cost-effective; a good place for running is on the edge of Meixi Lake. When I got up the next morning, I went downstairs and ran around the lake, which was exactly 10km. The distance is right, but the weather in Changsha is too sultry and sweats a lot; the location of the hotel is right, the floor is high, the view is good, the downstairs is the landmark cultural and art center, and you can go to Jinmao Show City without going out of the building, two days in a row In the evening, I ate two different Hunan cuisines, both of which were good. The hotel room has an entrance partition, which needs to be bypassed to walk in. It is more attentive and private, and can also isolate part of the noise in the corridor; the variety of breakfast does not count There are too many, mainly Western style, and there is also a Hunan local noodle and noodle stall, but I have not tasted it; the swimming pool is not big, the water temperature is suitable, and the curved roof of the cultural and art center is outside the window. If you can find an angle, the swimming pool is better. There is also a children's paddling pool, the water temperature is relatively hot. I didn't bring my daughter with me this time. She will definitely like the pool when she comes. The underground garage and the Jinmao Building have an entrance and exit. The signs for the hotel parking spaces inside are not very clear. It's just that there is no ventilation and air conditioning in the ba*****t, it's really stuffy; in addition, it is a national chain luxury brand hotel after all, and the staff's service enthusiasm and attitude are worthy of recognition. They helped us upgrade the lake view room when we checked in, and the view outside the window is amazing. That's right, the tall buildings across the lake, backed by mountains and facing the water, really feel like a little Hong Kong, and sitting by the window to watch the scenery is also a special feeling.

I have been playing for three days, and I really need to adjust it, and finally decided to take my children to this hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I met a beautiful lady at the front desk. I didn't know it was a Marriott hotel until I checked in. I don't think it will be bad without entering the room. After arriving at the room, I really felt that the choice was too correct. The hotel has a swimming pool and has direct access to the mall. There is no need to queue up for the tea, you can buy afternoon tea directly at the hotel, and the children will go to the swimming pool to have fun, it is not too comfortable. The food brands in the mall are quite complete, and you can eat directly in the mall at night. The entrance of the shopping mall is the subway entrance, and it is very convenient to go to Juzizhou and Wuyi Square. The environment downstairs is also superb. Needless to say, the supporting facilities in the room are top-notch decoration quality at first glance. The bed is also a king-size bed with a width of two meters. The mattress looks like lying on a cloud. I really want to buy it even if I lie on the bed. The same mattress. Room service is also super considerate, parking is free, and there is a dedicated butler. All in all, the stay experience was super satisfactory. After I posted it on Moments, I was already asked the name of the hotel by my friends. It will definitely be the first choice when going to Changsha in the future.

Next to it is the Cultural and Art Center, where you can check in and produce movies. There is also a small night market within a few minutes' walk. The most important thing is that the hotel's service is very special, and it takes the trouble to meet the special needs of the children who use robots to deliver water and meet the needs of visiting the art center. There are not enough tickets for the cute pet garden, so they are generously given away, and the breakfast is also perfectly resolved, and the water is also generously delivered. The staff are very nice and warm. They respond to any problems in a timely manner and try to solve them. It is the best service among the hotels I have stayed in. I strongly recommend it!

Compared with the crowds in the city center, it is more suitable to bring children to stay here. There is a cute pet paradise and a swimming pool for taking pictures. Even if you want to go to some Internet celebrity attractions, you can get there within half an hour. All in all highly recommend this is really great breakfast is also very rich and the service is very good

The hotel is OK overall. After using the Changsha tourist coupon, it’s 200 yuan cheaper. , children especially like to swim~ I have been swimming in the constant temperature children's pool. There are free tickets for the cute pet paradise. There is an indoor amu*****t park inside, which is charged separately. The older children are entrusted there. Parents are very relieved to go shopping by themselves. The Super Wings-themed room is also very popular for babies. There are special towels and bathrobes for babies, toilet chairs for children, etc. All aspects of baby check-in are ok. Next The next time I come to Changsha, I will continue to book!

msg:This is my first and last time to stay here. I will probably not choose this hotel again in the future. First of all, after checking in and entering the room, I found that the photos of the room that I saw when booking were different. There was no slide in the photo. Moreover, when I checked again on the confirmation call the day before to see if there was a slide, the staff said that they had seen it online. The picture arrived was consistent with the room. I chose this room type because my child liked the slide. Secondly, I found a cockroach in the sink after taking a bath at night! cockroach! This creature should not appear in a hotel like this, even in an ordinary hotel or B&B. Finally, the service response speed is extremely slow. It took nearly fifteen minutes from the time the cockroach was discovered and the housekeeper was informed to the door-to-door trea**ent. , and the handling method is difficult for me to understand. I just asked a cleaning lady to bring a towel to catch the cockroaches. I just want to ask, will the cockroaches stay there for 15 minutes and wait for someone to catch them? When the cleaning lady came in and was told that the cockroaches were gone, she was at a loss and didn't know what to say. She could only let her go. About ten minutes later, the housekeeper himself came to the room. I thought he came to me with the results of the trea**ent, but it turned out that He came to understand the situation, and then nothing happened. He just kept saying that he was sorry, that he had never encountered such a situation during his work, etc., and the result of the handling was reluctantly given after I repeatedly asked. Two solutions that were almost useless, and the hotel did not give an explanation for the cockroach incident until check out. Finally, let me say that breakfast is really average.

msg:Everything else is actually pretty good, but the front desk and the so-called housekeepers I met can be said to be from the best to the weirdest. When I checked in at the front desk, I booked one night each on the credit card platform and Ctrip platform. The only room types booked on the credit card platform are deluxe city view king rooms, and the 180-degree lake view room type on Panyunshang booked on Ctrip (the prices of the two on Ctrip are basically the same every day, and the room type on Panyunshang was even cheaper on the day I booked the room) ). When I checked in, I asked to stay in the same room for two nights. At first, the front desk said that it was not possible and that there would be an additional fee of 350 yuan, otherwise I could only stay one night and change rooms. Later, I said that the prices on Ctrip were the same, so I agreed to change the room, but I continued to stress. The price difference for their room was 350. When I transferred the room, I had already registered as a Marriott member. I asked my roommate to also register as a Marriott member to help her complete a task. After I refused directly, it was obvious that the front desk immediately made a bad face, and then asked me to add a so-called housekeeper. WeChat, Ctrip will give a 5-star review when the time comes, I agreed to this.
After checking out, the so-called housekeeper contacted me on WeChat to ask if I was satisfied with my stay. My answer was very good. Up to this point, I was ready to give a 5-star review. As a result, the so-called WeChat butler then said, "Please give Ctrip a five-star review and send a screenshot to him." I am also speechless. After I evaluate my feelings, do I still need to take a screenshot to report to you?
When I checked in, I only wanted to stay for two nights and hope that I could adjust between the two room types with the same price on the Ctrip platform to save the trouble of changing rooms after staying for one night. Other hotels will definitely take the initiative to help customers solve problems without asking them to ask. In your hotel, everyone from the front desk to the so-called WeChat butler gives you a great favor? Why is there a price difference of 350 yuan for a room, so the price you actually sell it for is not the same? Why do customers have to take screenshots and report to you after they have finished their reviews?

As long as the room was in good condition and there was no other consumption, the deposit was not refunded after leaving the hotel. It was not until I stayed in another hotel that I remembered the deposit and found that I didn't refund the money, so I called the hotel at least 5 times through Ctrip customer service. The hotel still insisted that the money had been refunded to the card, and I accepted it. In other words, if I did not take the initiative to trace the deposit, the hotel would definitely not refund the deposit. I have never experienced this kind of experience in any other hotel before.

The reply from the engineering depar**ent said that the air conditioner was not turned on, which was absolutely terrible. They gave a typhoon fan, but it only blew out the wind and made a very loud sound. Moreover, the problem was not solved in time and the wait took a long time. I have stayed in many hotels, but the experience in this hotel is terrible. It does not meet the 5-star standard at all. The hygiene is not good. The scenery is good, but the glass surface is covered with dirt inside and outside, and the toilet is not smart. I booked a room with Family Connect. The room and the middle of the big bed are also a little sagging because I brought several children. The children wanted pencils and couldn't get them from the front desk ~ The room price and facilities and services are far from consistent👎👎👎

I called the front desk the next day and asked but they said there was no one. I was given a salt packet. I asked the staff who delivered the stuff and they said There is bubble gel.
The service response was very slow. I called to ask if they could help heat things. The front desk promised to arrange for staff to come and help heat things up. After waiting for 20 minutes, no staff came. I called and asked for about ten minutes before they came to get it; It took half an hour of calling to get the hot food back. This situation also occurs when calling to ask for disposable bath bags, sockets, water delivery, etc.

Environment: The toilet is not a smart toilet. It is a smart toilet in all seasons. This is not the case in a hotel at this price. I wanted a king-size bed room with a lake view, but from my room, the hotel has a house in front and the lake can only be seen from the side.


Cute Pet Paradise 1 large 1 small package: The check-in staff didn’t tell me that this was included in the package.

[On vacation] 90 minutes of intensive beauty photography: I originally placed an order for this, but after understanding it, I forgot about it. It’s a trap; there is no free lunch🙄

Special praise for the hotel's cute pet paradise✅
There is only one ticket for check-in. We have three children. We told the front desk of the hotel that the lady at the front desk was also very enthusiastic and gave us three additional tickets. The children had a great time.
The special playground is open, facing the endless lake view, and the air field is excellent.

msg:Must, negative review
My classmate's family came from out of town and had a late-night snack near the West Railway Station. Thinking that they would live near Meixi Lake, they booked a gold trade deal from Ctrip.
Maybe we had a late night snack and drank wine, so we probably didn't check the check-in date carefully. We had clearly booked a check-in date of 2.3, but the front desk ignored it. The front desk was right. I decisively changed the order, and went to check in with my classmate's wife and children. We came back after a late night snack. During the process of adding a room, the front desk had a very bad attitude:
First, there was no one at the front desk. The girl at the front desk who checked in was chatting with others in the lobby.
Second, the front desk bullied me. First of all, I am sure that I did not say anything harsh to her. During the check-in process, she actually started yelling at me. Maybe she was disturbed by someone she was dating at that time. The hotel can check it herself. The video in the lobby, I also recorded it myself later, and there is video to prove it. While I was recording the video, she even called someone over, thinking she was going to call security to drive me away, but the manager in the lobby (I don’t know if he is the boss) came. The first is not apologizing, the second is not communicating, and the second is asking me to delete the video without saying a word. I'm right. Why should I delete the video? As a front desk leader, you don't communicate with customers and don't understand the reasons and processes. You deserve to do it. A leader of a five-star hotel?
I wanted to book a hotel with a classmate and his family that is close to home and has a good environment. I didn’t expect that a famous hotel (three stars is not enough in my heart) would have such poor front desk staff. It’s really embarrassing.
Third, as this is such a famous hotel, I asked them to help me book a taxi home. The front desk and the front desk manager said that I made the appoin**ent online, and the five-star hotel did not provide one-star service. I recommend that friends who come to Changsha in the future not to travel. Stay in this hotel, there are many hotels nearby,

However, due to some minor problems with the air conditioning, the hotel has been upgraded to a children's theme room. Although the fountain cannot be seen in the room, the children's theme room is indeed more suitable for families with children. The room layout and children's supplies are very considerate, and the children are very happy. The attitude and efficiency of the hotel to solve problems are very good. The cute pet paradise on the third floor is recommended, because it faces Meixi Lake outdoors, the scenery is good, it is clean and there is no peculiar smell, and children can feed small animals. Downstairs in the shopping mall, there is no need to queue up.

In the cute pet paradise, you are given three thin carrot sticks, and you have to buy the rest by yourself. It costs 20 yuan for a small basket, a few rabbits, an alpaca, and two fragrant pigs.
Not recommended.

Next to it is the Meixi Lake International Culture and Art Center, the posthumous work of the world-famous female architect Zaha Hadid. If you choose a high floor, you can overlook the entire Meixi from the sky. Lake Culture and Art Center, very spectacular. There is a door leading to Jinmao Show City in the hotel, and you can enter the shopping mall by swiping the room card. The four-story shopping mall integrates catering, entertainment, leisure, and supermarkets, as well as Changsha's characteristic "tea color and pleasant color", both on the first and third floors. There is an Internet celebrity swimming pool on the 3A floor of the hotel. From the swimming pool window, you can see the Meixi Lake International Culture and Art Center, which is very beautiful. The cute pet park on the third floor of the hotel has small animals such as pony, alpaca, sika deer, and small squirrels that can be fed to them. Children have a good time, but it is a bit hot in summer. It is recommended to play in the morning. The hotel's breakfast is also relatively rich, it is recommended to go early, and many dishes are not available later. I stayed for two nights, and the musical fountain in Meixi Lake was not opened, which is a little regrettable. But overall it is a satisfactory hotel and will stay again next time.

But staying in this hotel is a bit bad, let's talk about the following problems
The first point, toilet, everyone should know, this is the dirt caused by the long-term cleaning in place
The second point, there is a lot of dirt, dust, nails in the gaps between the windows
The third point is that the efficiency is very low. When I checked in, the front desk told me that I could use a robot to deliver takeaways upstairs, but it took an hour to deliver, and the smoothies I ordered from Starbucks were all melted.
The fourth point is that the plug is in poor contact and the hair dryer has a bad plug. I notified the engineering depar**ent of the hotel to change the number. The engineering depar**ent next to the desk said there was no way to do it and sent me a socket.
The fifth point, when the air conditioner is turned on to the maximum wind speed, there is an abnormal sound, which is a bit noisy.

Stayed for two days and found these problems so far!

The hotel thoughtfully arranged a room with a lake view for us, with a wide view, pleasant scenery, and tickets for the animal farm. The hotel pool is mini, and the win is on the exterior. Before check-in, the housekeeper contacted, and cared about the check-in requirements, prompted nucleic acid testing, and also helped to query information, and then helped to receive express delivery and arrange delivery to the room. When there are meeting guests at check-in, the staff can also pay attention to the needs of the guests, respond and quickly repair the room circuit. The front desk and the concierge also help each other with luggage, which is good. It is recommended to arrange a special elevator to get up and down for a large number of meeting guests, so as not to disturb other guests. Your hotel has this condition, and this is the luxury service standard.

But Ms. Nancy who answered the phone had a bad attitude, irresponsible, unfamiliar with hotel facilities, unprofessional reply, and overall arrogant. If there is no younger brother at the front desk who answered the phone the day before and received such service the next day, he would definitely choose to change hotels.
2. Hotel facilities: I saw that it was the No. 1 parent-child hotel in Changsha, so I chose it. But maybe because of the epidemic, there is not much parent-child entertainment. There is only one cute pet paradise, which is relatively small, a bit like Shenzhen's Sky City. But very clean.
3. Surrounding facilities: It takes 2 minutes to walk to Lanxiu City. There are many famous restaurants in Changsha, such as tea color and color, smoked cooking and fried cattle. Mini Mars with a parent-child game is highly recommended. 298 is one big and one small, it is worth going. There is also an art gallery downstairs, which is very beautiful, and it is a blockbuster if you take a photo. There is also Meixi Lake Park, which is very comfortable in the morning and evening. It is said that there is a musical fountain, but only 246 is open, so I just missed it. The coffee in the lounge downstairs is also average. Haagen-Dazs is only 20 yuan per ball, and the price is very fair. But to eat and drink, choose to go to the shopping center next door, it is very convenient and there are many choices.

On the whole, except for the phone call and bringing the children, the others are still very good.

The deluxe lake view room I booked is very big and the details are full. The staff will help to put the luggage, and then I found that there is a luggage desk to organize the luggage without squatting on the ground. Fat-Losing Stars recognize it as very healthy!

The breakfast is a wild buffet. The taste is not bad. The ingredients are fresh and the fruit is delicious. My favorite is the porridge and drinks without much sugar. Then there is white sugar on the table that can be added by yourself.

In the morning, no one goes to the gym. Maybe it's because there are fewer people staying in the hotel on weekdays. In the whole gym, I have the equipment and can't operate it. Ask the lady at the front desk. The lady will come and teach me how to use it, and I will not be embarrassed. Then the lady also told me to swim and walk away. Go to the locker room without going through the sink to get your shoes dirty
There are not many people swimming. The changing room facilities are very complete. The bathing place is very clean. I regret not coming to this hotel earlier. I will come here often in the future.

After arriving in the guest room, the manager on duty immediately went to the room to apologize, gave a small gift, and changed the room to another room for better viewing angles. The response was quick and the quality was high. .
The hotel itself is very new and the hardware is beyond doubt. The breakfast noodles are delicious, and there are few other dishes. The gym is a bit small, there are too many people in the swimming pool, and there are a lot of children. There are summer swimming classes for children. Swimming in the hotel is basically difficult.
The TV in the room is relatively old and cannot cast screens, and the remote control is often broken and unintelligent.
The room customer service is answered by the artificial intelligence phone, and the response is very good.

It is very pleasant to go out for a walk around the lake in the morning and evening. Next to it is the International Culture and Art Center. You can enter the shopping mall from the hotel. It is too convenient to eat and drink. You can also enter the subway station from the shopping mall. You can get to Yuelu Mountain, Orange Island, and Wuyi Square after a few stops on Line 2.

🌈The biggest highlight: The unique sky swimming pool has become the best viewing spot for Meixi Lake International Culture and Art Center. Meixi Lake International Art Center is the work of the famous female architect Zaha Hadid.
📌Location: No. 1177, Meixi Lake Huanhu Road, Yuelu District, Changsha City, Hunan Province #长沙梅溪湖金茂精品酒店[location]#, the surrounding environment is quiet, but far from the bustling CBD in the city center.
🏯Room: The room is equipped with cloakroom, Blueair air purifier, JBL Horizon audio, especially the design of double basin and bathtub by the window, which improves the guest's staying experience. "Hunan embroidery" works are dotted in the room, highlighting the regional characteristics.

From the South Station to the hotel directly to the subway 30 minutes, from the Line 2 Cultural and Art Center subway from the view of the show city directly to the hotel lobby. The decoration style of the hotel is my favorite decoration style. It seems to have arrived in the world. Listen to the hotel front desk staff introduce this luxury select hotel is a decorated style with Taohuayuan as the background, with strong local cultural characteristics. The room for us is a distinguished lake view room, this room type is highly recommended by me, the big floor-to-ceiling window is Lushan and Meixi Lake. Relaxing. Another authentic Yulan latte is an absolute godsend! Other than that, the service at the hotel is first class. Got me fruit and snacks. The aunt on the floor is also polite. Will come back again next time!

入住期間出了一些小狀況，酒店的值班經理小朱和酒店管家小齊也都非常積極的幫忙解決，後來又多定了一晚，一共住了三晚，確實是非常喜歡這個酒店。
對了，餐飲、健身房、游泳池、萌寵樂園也都可圈可點，酒店穿出去就是覽秀城，有兩家茶顏悦色，還有墨茉點心局，都是網紅店，法派餐廳也很棒，又便宜又好吃，服務環境也都好，反正很適合泡酒店的人羣。

衞生間很寬敞，三個人同時洗漱也不擁擠，浴盆的位置正好可以看到窗外的景色。
衣帽間可以打開放兩個大箱子，掛衣架充足。
早餐種類不是很多，住了四天調換口味也足夠了。
客房服務很贊。每天打掃衞生非常徹底。入住期間正趕上過生日，酒店給佈置了房間，還贈送了美味的蛋糕，並配上手繪的賀卡，小驚喜之餘很感動。
不足：早餐帶位有些混亂，前台不能保證一直有人，有的客人自己進入餐廳會坐到之前已經帶過客人的位置，造成客人之間的矛盾；對客人提出的問題響應不及時。住了四天，前三天還好，最後一天背景音樂聲音超級大，跟服務人員提出建議後，10分鐘沒反應。後來又再次提醒。

msg:我一人帶兩個孩子入住酒店，打車到達酒店時，門口的工作人員不會上前提行李或幫忙，這個印象分大減。中午到的可房間也還沒有準備好，這個可以理解，但我等了兩三個小時後，再回去居然也還是要讓我等一下才分配好房間。房間裏面有地方衞生不到位，地毯上有臟東西。泳池不錯，有個小的温水池，適合小孩子。第一次去泳池居然浴巾也沒有，第二次去才有。優點是房間很大，可以看到梅溪湖全景，但沒有音樂噴泉。給的萌寵樂園的門票，可是那邊要餵動物的話還要再買蔬菜，20塊就一小籃子。

首先，我要讚揚這家酒店的房間。房間非常乾淨整潔，每一個角落都打掃得一塵不染。床鋪也非常舒適，讓我在旅途中得到了極好的休息。
其次，酒店設施齊全，提供了各種現代化的便利設施，如高速互聯網、電視、空調等。這些設施讓我的住宿體驗更加舒適和便捷。
服務質量也是這家酒店的一大亮點。服務人員非常友好和熱情，總是樂於幫助客人解決問題。他們讓我感到非常歡迎和關注。特別是前台的ella chen 陳小芬[強]
此外，這家酒店的地理位置非常便利，周邊有許多餐館、商店和景點。這對於我們這些喜歡探索當地文化的遊客來説非常方便。
早餐是酒店體驗中非常重要的一部分，而這家酒店的早餐豐盛可口，提供了各種口味的食品，滿足了不同客人的需求。
最後，這家酒店的性價比非常高。雖然價格合理，但提供的服務和設施都非常出色。總體來説，這次入住經歷讓我非常滿意，我會毫不猶豫地向我的朋友們推薦這家酒店。（直接湖景升級成總統套房，就是忘記給拖鞋和袋子！這幾句才是我説的！）

msg:兩點認為該酒店需要在服務上再有所提高
1. 選擇該酒店很大程度上因為泳池原因，但到店被13-16 號泳池停止開放，該事件可以通過提前打電話告知的情況避免。 
2. 14/15 號連續早餐兩天發現國人有區別對待嫌疑。前一天臨近 9:45 還有鮮榨果汁供應，而 15 號 9:20 就不再提供。
個人感觸，14 號因為有外國團隊用餐，因此直至 10 點結束都有新鮮果汁供應。而 15 號因為外國團隊已經提前用餐結束，之後鮮榨果汁不再補充。服務人員搪塞的藉口是水果用完。對該理由，見仁見智。

服務：好評，唯一需要改進的可能是前台check in的等候時間有點長而且缺乏引導，可能正好有團客排隊有的亂亂的，但總的來説其他服務還是很好的

酒店出門右拐沿大街直行幾百米有商業街。
門口就是藝術中心大劇院，要能同時訂場演出就完美了。

房間佈局我也超愛，大大的落地窗能看到長沙的文創中心全貌，而且能看到半個長沙的湖景，尤其是晚上泡着澡看着外面的燈光，喝着紅酒，感覺非常的愜意。
每個房間配備了專門的管家，有什麼問題需要什麼直接可以跟管家説，太方便了，房間還給準備小童的洗漱用品，並且還給準備了小零食。服務真的很周到。一住進來就不想走了。
對了對了，酒店就可以直通商場，吃飯逛街都非常的方便，酒店裡還有游泳池，方便了很多，孩子可以玩水也不費媽。
就寫到這吧，總之去長沙一定要住的酒店。帶娃首選。圖片太少，當時被美景迷住了。

此外，酒店的位置也非常便利，靠近市中心，靠近梅溪湖，總的來説，我強烈推薦這家酒店。

送的旅拍服務挺好的，提前一天預約時間，可以在房間，泳池或者周邊取景，免費送五張精修圖。

送的萌寵樂園門票兩張，帶小朋友喂小動物，非常開心。

唯一美中不足，酒店這麼高，居然沒有頂層酒吧或者早餐廳，有點遺憾。

衞生：衞生狀況也挺好，每天會有打掃，阿姨還幫忙把睡衣疊好了，感謝。

服務：酒店上上下下的服務都很貼心，客服人員都非常有禮貌有耐心，還都長得特好看。

總的來説很方便，下次來長沙還定這家。

msg:一次非常滿意的體驗! 住的是湖景大床房，房間很大很舒適，景色無敵。服務人員很熱情專業，早餐豐富。萌寵樂園和泳池小朋友非常喜歡。交通方便，打車和坐地鐵去市區都不算很遠。

唯一覺得可以改進的就是萌寵和小朋友的遊樂設施在室外，夏天的話很熱。動物也很熱，狗狗在籠子裏看着熱的喘氣有點可憐。。。羊餓的叫的很慘。。。

除了這個之外其他的體驗都完美，以後來長沙會再次選擇這裏

酒店所有的人員服務更是沒得説了，周到熱情的服務時刻環繞你。有機會一定再次來光顧。

早餐也是可圈可點，吃到了湖南特色的米粉，還有糖油粑粑和葱油粑粑，每天的菜式也會有些許的變化，可見酒店的用心。
雖然梅溪湖遠離市中心，但是酒店連着一個商場，解決吃飯都不成問題，總之，這個酒店令人滿意！

跨年夜在酒店對面的梅溪湖感受到了長沙跨年的氛圍感，零點湖邊有市民和遊客在放煙花。不論是自己去湖邊看煙花還是在酒店房間裏看都很美，一次很開心的跨年體驗，一次很難忘的回憶！

但有一點酒店還是要引起重視：今天早上醒來人很不舒服、覺得發熱、本想測個體温看看**快送葯品、但問了迎賓、禮賓、客房服務電話表示都沒有、然後打了電話延遲了退房時間、但孩子還是要吃飯、所以幫孩子點了外賣、結果説點的盒子太大不可以送要自己下樓、外賣小哥可以送但禮賓部不肯、也不願意給我拿、真的這個太離譜了、雖然疫情過去、作為那麼高端一個酒店、配備體温計是有必要的、在客人表示狀態不好、身體不舒服要求送東西我覺得還是可以要求的。原本可以買點葯先吃下去緩解、最終自己身體還是很不舒服的情況下帶着孩子做高鐵回家了、回到家38.9、陽了。對於體温計、生病情況下拒絕送餐表示很想給差評。
給所有好評完全上訴對其它工作人員的付出、給出的5星好評、實際酒店還是有欠缺的

但是最接受不了的是房間裏為什麼那麼熱？這幾天長沙20度，房間裏一天不開空調，然後叫工作人員測量下來27.5度，開了空調我估計要直奔30度，一晚上熱醒了幾次沒法睡！工作人員幫我開了氣窗，温度還是維持在27度。到底是什麼問題？空調還不能製冷，2萬都沒睡好

酒店室內環境還可以，非常舒適，但是我住的開放式套房除了比大床房大了些，也沒啥特別的。
泳池據説是網紅打卡地，所以來打了個卡
酒店早餐真的是太一般了，不好吃，而且房間選擇是無法勾選不含早餐。。。很無語

缺點:
①登記入住耗時太久，大概等了二十分鐘。
②進到房間聞到濃重煙味，又重新到一樓大堂要求換無煙房，又等了十幾分鍾。
③入住兩天的最低温度衹有六七度，酒店居然不供暖。投訴後給了一台暖風機，但衹能暖前面兩米。第二天下午五點幾，打電話來説可以換一間另一個朝向的房間，可能會暖點。都晚上了，又沒有陽光了，不同朝向的房間能暖幾度，所以沒有換了。
④酒店的床一睡就凹進去，尤其雙人床的兩側。第一晚睡完腰痠。第二晚挪到床的正中才稍好些。
作為一間五星級的酒店，這樣的硬件、服務真的不行。

總結，整體軟硬件就是一晚七八百的水準，房費定價2000的話，那就水份太大，客人註定失望。以上供其他客人蔘考。

總體來説，入住體驗遠不如第一次，酒店設施老化明顯，服務水平有所下降。畢竟酒店地理位置和周圍景觀很不錯，希望酒店能夠改進提升，不負萬豪系高端品牌之名。

餐飲好，早餐品種豐富，味道好。

服務：4.8分

到酒店當天特別早，因為滿房的緣故，沒有辦法辦理提前入住，最早也得等到10點後。其實都還好，前台的工作人員估計是因為沒休息好的緣故，睡眼惺忪地草草交代了幾句就讓我簽字，説房間打掃了給我打電話，沒有任何的服務意識。當然，這衹是小插曲，豪華精選的品牌和設施環境，那還是很不錯的，後來也給我們升級了房型，推薦入住尊貴湖景房，樓層高，視野好，陽光灑進房間光線特別棒！

樓下就是大型商場，還有沃爾瑪，茶顏悦色就在商場裏超級無敵方便，人特別少。

酒店的泳池開放時間從早上六點多到晚上十一點，小朋友玩回來吃過飯還能去遊一會兒真的很棒。送的萌寵樂園票也蠻划算，雖然不大但也算很值了！

服務人員態度都很不錯，見面都會主動打招呼，幫拿行李，要送的東西也很及時送～

不過第二次去吃早餐領位有點迷惑，四大兩小因為衹有很昏暗的一個包房有足夠位子（且冷），我拒絕後表示就坐小桌子即可，有個沒收拾的不知道可不可坐的桌子，但領位的人就這麼丟下我們走了……也沒説可不可以坐或者帶到哪張可以坐的空桌，而旁邊收拾乾淨的位子又被阻止入座。。。衹能自己多次找不同的人要求收拾、要到了寶寶椅、增加的椅子、餐具，當然後續這些我找到的人都幫助了我讓我們順利坐下就餐了～

早餐廳忙中有序。服務也還不錯。煎蛋的雖然沒有積極熱情的態度，但也算完成他的工作。熱牛奶在非常不明顯位置用一個非常非常不明顯的器皿盛放，為此問了三次服務人員。最後一位服務人員陪同告知並幫我們端了過來。唯一不足給房間保潔，這是我住過打掃最不乾淨的，保養非常差的房間。簡直出乎意料之外！特別是衞生間，尤其衞生間的牆面存在很多手印之類各式污跡。洗手間兩個垃圾桶出於環保考慮沒有放垃圾袋，但垃圾桶外面全是污跡 不忍直視。我都不忍拍照！希望酒店督促保潔人員嚴格清潔擦拭垃圾桶！並且這樣的垃圾桶並不適合扔垃圾。他需要用力碰到一邊蓋子才能轉開垃圾桶蓋扔進去，這樣勢必非常有可能會被另一半蓋子碰到手。建議要麼去除蓋子要麼重換垃圾桶。上傳圖片都是剛入住時候眼睛所能看到的。我建議酒店保潔部門重新培訓，房間各平時保潔不擦的地方定期大掃除全部擦拭到位。這是我唯一入住自己用酒精紙巾把我手觸及到的地方都擦拭一遍的酒店。

如果吹風機能換成戴森，智能馬桶，水壺不跳電就更棒了

msg:1．酒店位置：比不了五一廣場附近的各種五星，略遠，但也僅僅是略，畢竟2號線還算方便。梅溪湖文化藝術中心站下車，地鐵口可穿過覽秀城直達酒店大堂。我是春節入住，萬幸定了它，解決了**煩，今年春節長沙已淪陷。酒店附近打卡出片的地標太多．中國結橋，達美美立方，城市島，梅溪湖文化藝術中心．
2．餐飲
早餐説實話要不是因為湖南米粉鎮台，其他的菜品算了吧．.．中餐熱菜少到可憐；西餐品相種類都略有不足；飲品水果中規中距吧。因為來旅行，午餐晚餐全部刷的網紅菜館，邊上覽秀城就有不少。酒店桃花源中餐廳評分很高，價位約人均200+。
3．亮點
泳池肯定是加分項，冬季水温都不錯，大落地窗配上梅溪湖文化藝術中心背景框，超級出片。健身房挨着泳池，大小適中，器械不錯，景色也可以。服務比較主動，酒店硬件和設計感也對得起價位。入住，退房速度也都不錯。外賣可以隨便點，打個電話就有機器人送餐，不用自己下樓。房間隔音也還行，晚上睡的
安靜
説點不足：空調暖風不給力，有些冷。淋浴區沒有防滑墊和防滑拖鞋

同樣在早餐的時候，也是那個大堂的女生跟我説（沒錯，我記得這位姐的説話和做事風格），沒有鮮榨果汁，一直都沒有……嗯……不知道真的假的，如果是真的，那我覺得早餐沒有鮮榨果汁這點酒店要改進一下。如果是假的，這位姐是不是有什麼毛病啊

服務是真的好，前台欣怡聽説我們離開是晚上的航班，幫忙把退房時間延遲到下午4點。中途有什麼要求，也是快速響應，很有温度。

酒店附近環境好，緊挨着梅溪湖大劇院，也有很棒的湖景，晚上很安靜，住起來舒服；
酒店服務也很不錯，有求必應，幫我升級了房間，也感謝管家Mandy幫我延遲了退房時間，配合了我飛機起飛時間；
酒店房間很乾凈，空間大，設施齊全。
長沙好酒店不多，除了君悦感覺就是這家，但是君悦酒店附近環境肯定沒辦法和這裏比。

非常需要改進的地方: 送外賣的機器人衹有兩台，老半天送不上來，還要下去取外賣，不知道一個機器人採購成本是多少，非常影響住房體驗。要知道隨便一個幾百塊的酒店都能很快由機器人送到房門口。。第二，電吹風是個無名牌，噪音大，風量小，半天也吹不幹頭髮。。早餐沒什麼好吃的。。最後，晚上挨個敲門的夜場服務我覺得大可不必。。。

奈何那幾天，天氣不好。就一直困在酒店。
升了我滿意的房型，實話，真的感受到了酒店的誠意。
因為疫情的緣故，第一時間向酒店求助，得到了當地社區人員的及時解困！
真心感激！！
第一次住豪華精選，希望酒店在餐飲讓能夠更加精進。
游泳池很漂亮！俯瞰看着藝術中心的確是一個非常享受的事。
時間太匆匆，我其實對長沙依依不捨，好多計劃去玩去吃的地方都沒有履行，全都因為疫情的緣故。
答應了經理來分享照片，結果耽擱了這麼久的時間。

匆忙改期離開長沙，還剩了一張返程的公務open機票
，不知一年內還能有機會再來嗎。

msg:這次閨蜜遊選了長沙，然後盲選了這家酒店，酒店很便捷出地鐵口穿過商場就到了，酒店環境也很好衞生工作也相當不錯，酒店前台小姑娘雷雨欣非常認真負責的幫我解決了很多問題，真的是一次非常完美入住體驗！還有酒店早餐非常值得吃，都很好吃😋可惜時間太趕沒有拍照，有點遺憾，下次去長沙還會選擇這家酒店！一定補上照片

床上用品很舒服，格局通透。
酒店用品也很齊全，非常貼心。阿姨打掃房間還幫忙把衣服疊好了。
窗外風景很美，旁邊就是商場。
