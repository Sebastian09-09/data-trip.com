msg:First, what's good about this place. A nice scenery that you wake up with if you take the ocean facing view. Its a nice walk to the beach. Very family oriented place with amenities that are chile-centric.

A good spread of breakfast and delicious too. 

However, I was surprised to see services staff such as Reception, Bell boy and Gym staff seems to be dis-interested and not service oriented. Did not offer help with our baggage during our checked in. Receptionist ask us to bring our own luggage to the baggage storage. Not that we couldn't carry it but we were just very surprised to see this coming from a prestigious/luxury hotel. 

Some of the equipment at the gym facilities were dirty. Watermelon seeds on the bench, dead cricket on the cable machine and visible sweat stain on the bench. The gym staff seems unbothered when we came in. Note there's a sign says that gym equipment is disinfected after each use. I came early to check out the gym and only goes to the gym after my breakfast (the dirt were still there) lmaoooo.

Room is good and the bed is very comfortable. However, I would like to point out that the room is overly used. Wooden furniture were pale and there's a mouldy smell in the shower room. Balcony privacy wooden gate seems to rotten and faulty.

msg:The best service I‚Äôve ever seen. My birthday occurred during the stay and I was very surprised when many staff came to my room only to congratulate me . Also hotel was always get in touch with WeChat application and staff answered me for my questions rapidly and  help me to resolve any troubles related with the airport transfer, flights or laundry service. Each room well equipped with the luxury cosmetics and good quality electronic devices. Which is not common practice.
Of course hotel has luxury territory and many activities available inside of it but it is exactly what you expect from a hotel of such level.
The only thing you should keep in mind before go there that it you can‚Äôt swim in the sea in this bay. But because of many activities and swimming pools available may be it is not a big problem:)

The facilities are very clean, everithing is well organized and for a family with small child perfekt spot to go with.
The breakfast was delicious with lots of options. 
We will come back for sure. üëçüèº
The only negative thing is that it's a little off site so not much is Arround. There is a Shoppingcenter nearby but with no western food options.

msg:I picked this resort as it seemed to be high quality and close to the beach, and both of those things were fulfilled.

The room was huge with an amazing view of the ocean and fresh fruit was surprise delivered on the first day.

All the staff was wonderful, and Marnie did an incredible job being my WeChat butler, she helped me with anything I asked, and even asked if I wanted different pillows for the bed, what amazing service!

The breakfast buffet was outstanding, both Chinese and western breakfast, much of it cooked to order.

The location is not too far from Sanya and close to Yalong Bay train station, so very convenient. Also right next to huge duty free mall with many restaurants, and more authentic food and shopping experiences a short drive away.

The pool was lovely and the aquarium was full of beautiful fish and turtles.

The beach is basically on site, past a lawn from the main building, but it is not supervised and the currents are apparently strong, so swimming is prohibited. 

I visited the nearby "super luxury" Atlantis to check out the bar there, but I'm happy I stayed at the Intercontinental since it's much quieter and much more relaxed. It's not cheap but it's one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.

msg:- hotel has a beautiful secluded beach, due to heavy waves, guests are not allowed to swim there but it is quiet and beautiful.
- only one hotel staff who worked at the Cove stand out.  Her name is È©¨‰∏ÄÁ∫¨.  We were astonished that some guests were using their hands and own fork to take buffet food.  No staff stopped the guest.  Only this one staff helped with some considerate arrangement.
- Our shower room started to have foul public toilet smell on our last night.  GM was concerned and able to offer an air purifier upon request.
- Hotel management should prohibit staff from harassing customers to give them personally  unjustifiable 5 stars rating, even requested the customer to take a screen shot to evident in exchange for priority room arrangement next time.  I call this is a form of bribery.

msg:Good:
- Beautiful sea-view room with a wonderful panoramic window.
- Lovely tropical gardens.
- Great swimming pool with lots of shaded areas and a transparent kayak.
- Lovely beach with loungers, sunshades and basic amenities (lemonade, towels, beach toys).
- Awesome night views.
- Amazing open-air aquarium with exotic fish and turtles.
- Great amenities for kids (electric vehicles, train, pedal karts, swimming pool floats and boats).
- Friendly and helpful staff.
- Great location near CDF mall.
- Really good breakfast.

Bad:
- I received a significant electric shock just by touching the front tray of the children‚Äôs popcorn machine at breakfast. I immediately informed a member of staff whose response made me feel this was not the first time it had happened. They switched off the popcorn machine and said somebody would fix it. 10mins later we saw the machine was switched on again (the staff member said it was fixed).
- The security chain on the door to our room locked itself from the inside after we left the room, so we could not get in when we got back. Had to wait 15-20min for staff to open the chain from the outside, then had to wait another 30-40min for a repairman to replace the old/faulty chain lock - this took a while because the new hardware did not fit properly and the door could not be closed (it was fixed with some loud hammering). The next day, the door couldn‚Äôt close again so I had to again wait for a repairman to fix it (more loud hammering).
- A few times we had no response when calling ‚Äúinstant service‚Äù on the phone. The WeChat service was also sometimes slower than we‚Äôd expected, especially for urgent questions.
- Tired and worn out exterior and interior decoration (faded/peeling paint, damp patches).
- Wobbly fixings (balcony light, toilet paper holder).
- Confusing A/C controls (two control panels, no indication what each one is for)
- Live music started quite late and was loud - we had to close balcony door to let our child sleep.
- Transparent doors to the shower and toilet cubicles.
- Inconsistent service at breakfast (some days very attentive, some days not so).
- No good value lunch or dinner options. I tried a room service salad which was terrible (it used canned beans, canned corn and canned chickpeas, and processed roast chicken) - surprisingly bad value and quality.
- One evening our taxi was not permitted to enter the hotel grounds due to a special event. We had to walk up the long driveway with our (tired) young daughter‚Ä¶.it would have been nice for the hotel to offer their electric buggy shuttle from the main road to the lobby.
- After the trip, I received an email with a link to the bill, but this link took me to a web page which said an online bill was unavailable.

Underwater Seafood restaurant is relatively cheaper to have lunch buffet while you are staying there. Make sure you make a booking as soon as you have made the hotelReservation. I was shocked that the local restaurants Outside cost even more so I guess buffets are good choice if you have kids. Overall the hotel impression was good and we wish to stay longer. In addition the hotel
beach was white and the same looked fabulous to play. The hotel guards would warn the kids to stay away from the water who were very responsible.

msg:Lucas, the butler of InterContinental Hotel Haitang Bay Tianfang, is very good! Lucas's butler service is attentive and thoughtful. On the day of check-out, the photographer who was scheduled to take us to the sea took us "down to the sea". The luggage was originally packed, but because the clothes were wet and needed to be dealt with, Lucas contacted us to help us add an extra hour on the basis of the delayed check-out time. It was very considerate. Thank you.
The hotel is a five-minute walk from the duty-free shop, which is very convenient.
I personally like the dressing table in my room very much, which I have never seen in other hotels.
The lawn is very pleasing to the eye and very beautiful for taking pictures. The LOVE-shaped wooden stakes are also very photogenic.
The mermaid is very beautiful and interacted with us, adding an unforgettable memory. Lucas also took the initiative to share the voucher to help us save a little meal money, which is also a real saving, thank you.
I have stayed in Edition, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, St. Regis... Tianfang is still the most suitable for taking pictures.
I received two calls from the InterContinental lady, asking if the suggestions I made were resolved, and also asked about our stay experience. The voice is very cute, and she kept talking to me with a smile.
The staff who handled the water in the bathroom was a little white and fat, very gentle and patient. Thank you.
Every staff member I met was very nice.
I spent a good three days at Tianfang InterContinental and spent a wonderful Mother's Day with my mother. I will come again. I will also recommend it to people around me.

-The room butler Lucas is super considerate. He added v in advance and introduced the hotel (including dining time, location, entertainment activities, duty-free shop discounts, parking reservations, etc.). The room he arranged is very suitable for our group to stay. We can give timely and patient answers to our questions! Five stars of praise! ! 
-The scenery and location of the hotel are nothing to say. The duty-free shop can be reached in five minutes from the lobby. The beach and swimming pool in the hotel are very nice. It is very friendly to friends who are not visiting Sanya for the first time to check in (except that it is a little far from the airport, everything else is amazing) 
-The breakfast is also very rich. I strongly recommend the dregs vinegar. I think there is no need to go out to eat dregs vinegar hot pot. It is enough to eat in the hotel; I really like papaya + passion fruit fruit desserts. I can't wait to eat a few bowls! The breakfast content is very rich, and it is perfect as a brunch! 
In short, it is very good. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at InterContinental, and I will look for Lucas when I stay at InterContinental! Thumbs up

The service for two nights and three days was very thoughtful and careful, and he also gave small gifts to the children. The room was on the 10th floor, which was a little low. The eaves of the lobby blocked the view a little, but I didn't see any construction at all. The breakfast and the executive lounge were quite delicious. The dregs vinegar and Baoluo noodles for breakfast were very special. The executive lounge also had special blends and special noodle stalls or porridge stalls. The hotel's amusement park is also suitable for children aged 2 or 3. It is also close to the beach and swimming pool. But the attitudes of the hotel waiters are indeed a bit uneven, maybe some of them are outsourced teams.

msg:I moved to InterContinental to extend my vacation. As a long-term business traveler, I was a gold card holder of InterContinental two years ago, but later I changed to Marriott for various reasons. As a result, I stayed at Sheraton a few days ago, but as a Marriott gold card holder, I was not given an upgrade. Instead, the late check-out that I enjoyed until 4 o'clock was only given until 3 o'clock. The key word is one word: noisy. Maybe it's because the people who stay here are all families with children. They come out to enjoy the quietness and don't want too much noise. I changed to InterContinental because I thought the service was good before. As for the experience, it was as good as before, and there was a surprise that I was upgraded to a suite. I'm used to staying in business class, and the warm details of InterContinental still improve my experience a lot. The bedding, toiletries and bath products are obviously comfortable. The housekeeper Stella's daily care is still very warm, thank you! I will stay here again next time!

He also helped me during my stay. Thank you very much. The hotel environment is great and the room is large. Because it is off-season, only the family pool is open (enough). It takes a few minutes to walk to the beach. I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant. The taste was great and the service was thoughtful. The concierge can make an appoin**ent for a free airport shuttle bus, which is very convenient. Thumbs up. It is a hotel that I will choose again! (Btw the beach sand in Haitang Bay is very fine, and the coast is also cleaned up by people who clean up garbage.)

msg:It was my first time in Sanya, and I was amazed by the environment and service of the hotel. The corridor has a city view, and the balcony has a sea view and a beautiful garden view, which fully matches all the elements of a resort hotel. The room manager Xiao Cui was very considerate and meticulous before, during and after check-in, and introduced the hotel service items in detail. She responded to our inquiries very promptly and tried her best to solve them. The hotel is next to the duty-free shop, which is very convenient for shopping. The hotel's restaurants have their own characteristics, especially the Chinese restaurant, the environment and dishes are very colorful.

msg:As expected of InterContinental, the hotel is good in terms of food, accommodation and transportation.
Food: There are many varieties of breakfast, and the varieties are adjusted every day. You will not get tired of it even if you stay for several days. The lunch is a buffet at the underwater restaurant. There are not so many choices, but the taste is OK, and the sashimi is also fresh. The children especially like the feeling of eating under the sea, and there is interaction with the little mermaid.
Accommodation: The room is large, facing the sea, the dream house, there are welcome fruits on the first day, and the mini bar is filled every day.
Transportation: It is right next to the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, and there is a bus to the airport, which is 45 minutes away.
There is a butler service. I am very grateful to the butler Xiao Su. Several times when I encountered problems and troubled her at very late hours, she could reply and help solve them immediately. She also gave a small gift before leaving, which is very thoughtful.

msg:This is a great hotel in terms of construction, layout and design, the rooms are excellent, the renovation is fresh. Excellent breakfasts. The impression is greatly spoiled by those responsible for management and service. Much or almost everything related to service and support works ‚Äúcarelessly‚Äù:
1. When checking in, there is zero information about the infrastructure. Due to their lack of knowledge of English, they cannot answer the questions properly. I had to study what it is and how it works based on reviews from other tourists.
2. One of the two pools is accessible, the second is permanently closed.
2. The backlight works at 30% in the dark, it looks like a run-down village where they save electricity. Very beautiful landscape design, but it is not visible.
3. You can wait 15-20 minutes for a menu in a restaurant.
4. At best, every 3 speaks English, and even then with a translator, for an international network, this is strange.
5. WiFi is more dead than alive, I stopped trying to adapt to it and switched to mobile. Internet a couple of hours after check-in.

Well, the most infuriating fact: we specially ordered an improved Deluxe with a sea view, we arrived late in the evening at the end of the May holidays, this, as I understand it, is high season and the first night cost X2 of the regular price. As a result, for the first day we were given a room of a smaller category and with a view of the construction site. The next day after lunch, after several calls to the manager and support, they moved me without apologizing, as if that‚Äôs how it should be. Well, they spoiled the mood quite a bit.

Facilities: The room is big enough, the bed in the king-size room is also big enough, there is plenty of space, and it is very comfortable to stay. For children, it is very happy to take a small train to the beach. For adults, Tianfu Chinese Restaurant tastes good, and the spa in the hotel is also comfortable and relaxing.

Environment: The beach sand is fine, and there are lounge chairs. It is very comfortable to dig sand with children. The big lawn is beautiful.

Service: We must give five stars to praise our lovely housekeeper Stella! From before check-in to check-out, every process has given sincere and meticulous service, which is not just a routine reception~ All the employees met in the hotel will also take the initiative to greet warmly.

The hotel contacted one day in advance to confirm the arrival time and number of people. When they heard that I was bringing children, they immediately said that they would arrange children's toiletries. The exclusive customer service Stella was thoughtful and enthusiastic. The other hotel staff, from the front desk to the duty manager and the concierge at the door, all reflected the professionalism of a five-star hotel. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the female staff on duty at the ice cream float in the lobby on the first floor saw my baby watching the cartoons on the float, and immediately brought a small stool for the baby.

The construction site has almost no impact on the scenery, and there was no noise disturbance during the stay. The hotel has its own beach and green space, which is large and of high quality.
Service: The hotel will provide guests with a butler, and the service is very professional.
Others: The underwater restaurant experience is very good, the a**osphere is great, and the food is delicious. There will be professional singers singing at the back of the hotel lobby at night, which is very interesting.
Disadvantages:
1) There is no food delivery robot, if you order takeout, you need to go downstairs to pick it up.
2) There are many mosquitoes outdoors in the area where the hotel is located at night, but as long as the doors and windows are closed at night, it will not affect the interior at all.
3) There are meal ordering services and multiple small dining bars inside the hotel, but the food prices are too high, it is recommended to optimize appropriately.
The overall stay experience is excellent, five-star recommendation, and I will come again next time!

msg:This travel experience is particularly satisfactory. First of all, I would like to thank Xiao Wang for his warm reception and attentive service, which made me feel very intuitively that the service level of Sanya's head hotel is professional and online. Next, I will share with friends other feelings about staying in this hotel.
1. Hotel room. The room type I stayed in this time is a classic sea view room. I think the InterContinental room is very special among all the hotels in Sanya. One is that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe most basic room type of the hotel is basically 88 square meters. The room is a**ospheric and the decoration design is tasteful. The most special design is that the bed is facing the balcony. Who can understand the feeling of seeing the blue sea as soon as you open your eyes every morning? If you can wake up at 6 o'clock one day, you can watch a sunrise on the sea while lying on the bed. It's really great. In addition, the balcony is also large, and there is a bathtub (there is also a shower in the room). You can take a bath while blowing the sea breeze and listening to the rolling waves in the distance. Because there is a wooden fence blocking it, you don't have to worry about being seen by others.
2. Other facilities of the hotel. It can be seen from the hotel's toiletries that the hotel is particularly attentive. Byredo toiletries and dyson hair dryers make people enjoy every bath. In addition, each room is also equipped with special toiletries and laundry detergent for children, which is also very child-friendly. The hotel breakfast is also very rich. The lobby bar faces the lawn and the beach, and the hotel greening is also very worthy of praise. The quality of the beach is also very good, with fine sand.
3. Hotel service. I would like to thank Xiao Wang and all the hotel staff for their help and service again. They are really attentive. The day before check-in, a staff member will contact me by phone to communicate the check-in time and special needs. Because this is a honeymoon with my girlfriend, Xiao Wang also specially arranged a room with a better location and made a special honeymoon arrangement. At around 1 a.m., there were also staff supporting room service. In the end, I even wanted to stay for another night, but unfortunately the original hotel could not support cancellation, so I had to stay at InterContinental next time I came to Sanya.
A very satisfying check-in experience.

msg:Last year, I took my children to Yalong Bay and stayed at MGM. The children liked it very much. This year, I came to Haitang Bay. Because I don‚Äôt like to change hotels with my children, I compared different hotels and finally chose Tianfang InterContinental. I was very satisfied with the stay experience. When I went there, the flight just caught up with the hotel‚Äôs free airport bus pick-up. I booked a classic sea view room. Although the floor was not ideal, it was 88 square meters of luxurious sea view. The area was large and there was a mini bar. The construction site could not be seen from the front of the balcony. Although the construction site was next to it, the sound insulation was also very good and could not be heard at all. Moreover, I added the butler on WeChat when I checked in. I especially thanked the butler "Xiao Wang" for his caring greetings every morning and evening, and responded to and helped solve problems in a timely manner. The hotel has rich parent-child activities, and the children are full of daily schedules. The children also like the teachers very much. The small train, battery car and parent-child bicycles are unlimited. I didn‚Äôt feel bored after staying for six days and five nights. If I come to Haitang Bay again next time, I will choose Tianfang InterContinental. ps: There are lounge chairs on his beach, which is a plus. I heard that other hotels don‚Äôt have them. Travel photography is also good.

The housekeeper service is 100 points. The housekeeper Daisy Xiaosu is very considerate. She is still sending warm reminders at 23:30 in the evening when it is not working time, and sometimes she replies to our questions at 7 o'clock in the morning. She also helped to send things when she was late. She is really a housekeeper. The experience is very good. The children also like this lovely big sister.
The environment is very beautiful, the beach is very beautiful, and the sand is soft and comfortable. The only flaw is the construction of the third phase of the duty-free city. You can hear the sound when you open the window during the day.

msg:InterContinental is the last stop of this trip. I stayed in four hotels last time and five this time. InterContinental is definitely among the top three. It is worth mentioning that the housekeeper is very considerate and enthusiastic. The day before I checked into the hotel, the housekeeper Xiaocui had already contacted me on WeChat and sent me notes and hotel information in advance. On the day of check-in, Xiaocui enthusiastically arranged welcome fruits and helped us solve many problems. The hotel room is very large, and you can see the sunrise when you open the curtains in the morning. The breakfast is very rich, and there are many activities for children around the hotel. The only shortcoming is that after checking in at the hotel, only one of the three rooms was given, and I had to wait for a long time for the other two rooms. Overall, InterContinental is very good and a perfect end to this trip to Sanya.

The service response is efficient, enthusiastic and thoughtful. The hotel has a strategic location, the beach is beautiful, and it is very close to the duty-free shop. The rooms and parent-child facilities are great. The children had a lot of fun. The buffet is rich in variety and delicious. I will continue to choose it next time.

Environment: The environment is great, the big lawn and the beach are great. The only thing is that there is a construction site nearby. The front desk also upgraded your room and tried to help you book a room with a better view.

Facilities: The facilities are relatively new and have a sense of age. Overall, it is okay. I also look forward to the renewal of InterContinental facilities.

Restaurant: The breakfast variety is relatively rich. I went to the Chinese restaurant twice and felt that the service was better the second time.

Overall: Suitable for family travel, overall in line with expectations (it would be more perfect if there was no construction site)

msg:The room and hotel facilities are quite good, but they are a bit old and well maintained. The sea view is very good. This is because a booking deposit was collected when booking the hotel on Ctrip, and the accommodation deposit was charged on a daily basis when checking into the hotel. The deposit is just over 10,000 yuan. I think the only items in the room are the Dyson hair dryer, which is more expensive and has fixed wires. So why do I need to pay so much? After talking to the front desk for a long time, the accommodation deposit was waived.

msg:I booked it in a hurry this time. I thought InterContinental wouldn't be too bad and the price was okay, not too expensive, so I booked it blindly.
I booked a Ctrip Premium Sea View Room. The room was pretty good with a good view; full set of Byredo toiletries + Dyson; very well prepared, even with bath towels; even the tea bags were my favorite Twinings (‚Åé‚ÅçÃ¥Ãõ·¥ó‚ÅçÃ¥Ãõ‚Åé)
The service was also OK. There would be a room assistant to add you on WeChat in advance. I would like to praise [Xiao Su] here, very considerate. The only thing that annoyed me a little was that this hotel was too parent-child friendly. There were many, many activities, but they were all centered around children. There were basically no adult entertainment projects, and even the swimming pool was for families [laughing and crying R] I tried the ispa on the first floor. The environment was good and I felt really relaxed after doing it.
I have to praise that the hotel bed was very, very comfortable to sleep on (I don't know if it's because my own mattress is the same model as InterContinental Shenkeng, haha), the kind that I couldn't wake up after the alarm clock went off for a long time.
The breakfast was also good! The Wan Ning noodle is delicious. One bowl makes me full. üòÖ
It is also close to the duty-free shop, but I don‚Äôt have anything I want to buy. It is more suitable for eating seafood nearby and then going to the duty-free shop to digest the food before walking back to the hotel.

After comparing many options, I chose this one. There are various children's activities, and the children have a lot of fun.
Stella saw that we brought one child with us, so she upgraded us to a parent-child room for free. We can see the sea view and the room is very large! 
The flight was delayed for a long time before leaving. Stella specially gave us a free late check-out, brought snacks for the children, and various warm tips. She responded very quickly to anything. She is very kind and the children like her very much! I will come here again next time!

Breakfast was very rich.
The view from the balcony is great.
What I like most is that you can see turtles, and you can also snorkel to see fish and turtles.
Very close to the duty-free shop.
The only drawback is that the TV cannot cast the screen. It is said that it is already being improved and will be available in the second half of the year.

She could always meet our requirements in time and was very attentive. I was very satisfied and gave her a thumbs up. Then let's talk about the children's facilities.

This was really good, because my son liked cars very much, and everything related to cars liked this. This was really special to his appetite, and he also liked to play with the excavator in the naughty castle. And the Earl Travel Photography was really great, the photos were very good, and the repairs were also very good. It was really beyond my expectation. Everything else was great, including the breakfast. I don't know where the bad reviews on the Internet came from. It's really rare to have this experience in Haitang Bay at this price. I will come back for a second look next time I have the chance.

Congratulations, there were many online reviews of the hotel, and I finally chose InterContinental... Check-in experience: 1. The Intercontinental butler service is first-class, especially the beautiful butler Liu Xin, who has a strong sense of responsibility, is enthusiastic and attentive, and is more warm. She also gave us a gift from our hotel. We made an appointment for a small gift. The room we booked was for two people, but we actually stayed there for three people. Butler Liu Xin and the enthusiastic little beauty at the front desk gave us another afternoon tea and breakfast for free, which was very user-friendly. Afternoon Tea Ctrip ( (Executive courtesy) is also available in two portions, adding one portion will solve the problem of dinner on the same day. Since afternoon tea is until 17:30, go early and eat more. If you eat more, you won't have to eat dinner. The variety is enough for dinner. The morning is not bad, unlike what some customers said online. I personally feel that there is a wide variety and the ingredients are fresh. It is not first-class. I cannot give a bad review. There is also an outdoor terrace table where you can watch the fish swimming around. , while savoring the delicious food, it is very warm and the guests are of high quality. There is no fighting for seats or queuing when dining, because the time is very long, from 7 to 11 o'clock in the morning, so that the guests can get up at any time, and there is no need to queue at all. There are pictures for everyone Can be browsed. 2. The services of the housekeeper (Li Xin), front desk, security, bellman, and cleaning staff are all top-notch and have five-star reviews. First, the car drives to the lobby door and you don‚Äôt need to take care of your luggage. The handsome bellman helps to keep it. After checking in, they will deliver it directly to the room. , this is the beautiful housekeeper Li Xin who welcomed us with a smile and led us through the formalities. The speed was very fast, and the security management was also humane and not rigid. We didn‚Äôt want to park, so he found us a perfect location next to the lobby. parking space. The beautiful lady at the front desk is skilled in business and has an amiable attitude. The cleaning staff, environmental protection workers, and the handsome guy at the swimming pool all greet the guests when they meet, and it is a good experience. It may be the off-season. The 1.3-meter swimming pool is closed. There is only a gradually getting deeper pool on the other side. Will the handsome guy at the swimming pool patiently tell me which side is deeper? Shallow over there? conscientious. 3. Let‚Äôs talk about some experience in terms of facilities and equipment: Since it was opened 10 years ago in 2014, some walls, wooden furniture, and bathroom tiles are a bit old, but the fabric sofas and restaurant chairs are clean and it feels like they have been regularly replaced with new fabrics. very good. The bed was clean and comfortable, and I slept very well. Because we booked a double-occupancy suite, the other person could only sleep on the sofa. I brought a small air-conditioned quilt at home, but when Butler Li Xin found out, he was very enthusiastic and arranged for someone to give a new one for free. The sheets and quilt were very touching. The next day, I took the initiative to send a WeChat message to ask about my sleeping experience. 4. In terms of hygiene, management and supervision still need to be strengthened. There are some blind spots. For example, the underside of the sofa on the balcony should not be touched every time. It can be seen through the floor-to-ceiling windows that there is no light on the other floors of the balcony, hahaüòä. 5. The hotel is good for travel photography. They say they give half an hour or 40 minutes of free travel photography time. HahaüòäThe actual photography time for me was more than an hour. I felt tired and couldn‚Äôt live up to the hard work of the photographer, so I purchased a travel photography package. , keep this beautiful set of photos as a souvenir! Good day, good mood, good scenery, beautiful experience! 6. Let me talk about Tao - Undersea Restaurant, the facilities and environment and the mermaid show are very good, but the price is high and the food does not match the food. The last person is 598, but there is no live seafood steaming program, and each person is given half a lobster. , the rest are all frozen seafood, and there are not many varieties. It is not as good as the Western Shark Seafood Buffet in the aisle of my house, but the undersea and mermaid performances are more special, and the food is average. The above are true and objective evaluations and are for your reference only! This trip is mainly about high-end hotel experience and self-driving. Because I have a home and a car in Sanya, I will choose this way to travel once a year in the off-season.

msg:It was a great experience to stay at the Intercontinental. The hotel has a beautiful environment, the lawn is beautiful and it‚Äôs very cinematic. The road inside the hotel is relatively clear. The balconies of the entire hotel room are all facing the same direction, facing the beach and the sea, and the room doors are all facing the direction of the second phase of the tax exemption. You can take the free train in the park to get to the beach, or you can walk there, which is not too far. Although the hotel is not a family hotel, there are quite a lot of things to do for three-year-olds. Those who like something quieter can choose InterContinental without hesitation. The hotel is located next to the duty-free shop, only five minutes away. If you want to shop, just close your eyes! I am very grateful to the hotel ambassador Cici Xiao Wang. She called the day before our stay and thoughtfully arranged a room relatively close to the elevator based on my situation (pregnant woman with a child) and upgraded the room type. We also communicated frequently during our stay and provided very considerate services. Next time you go on vacation, it‚Äôs better to choose Kaaba InterContinental! ! !

In their specialty underwater restaurant, there is a Nepalese guy who is very nice. Although his Chinese is not very good, he still communicates very seriously. The overall service is very good. It is worthy of being a five-star hotel, although the hotel is a bit old. , the room facilities are a bit old, but this is normal. Rooms with sea views are really healing. A wonderful March starts with vacation!

The experience is great, with a tranquility like home, and exquisite and thoughtful service is reflected in every aspect. The details such as swimming rings for children in the swimming pool and sports shoes beside the bicycles are outstanding. From now on, every time I come to Hainan, I will stay at Intercontinental for a few days. I like this place very much. The housekeeper Lucas was very nice and tried his best to solve our minor problems. He contacted us one day in advance to inquire about our requirements before we checked in, which was great!

The housekeepers Shirley and Xiaoxuan also took the initiative to contact us and gave us notes in advance. Finally, we stayed in a room with a great view on the 11th floor.
Traveling with a 2-year-old baby this time, I feel very parent-child. The hotel is fully equipped with all kinds of equipment, including crib, toothpaste and toothbrush, bathtub, bib, tableware, wash stool, etc. It is perfect for taking children on vacation.
For younger children, the playability is very high! There are indoor play spaces, outdoor swimming pools, seaside beaches, small trains, turtle feeding, etc.
For dining, I especially recommend the Chinese restaurant, which is really much better than restaurants outside and the ingredients taste great!

We came during the off-season and Lucas upgraded our room for us and we were very satisfied. The InterContinental room is very large. If you want to book another hotel, it is recommended to leave the InterContinental for the next few days, because it is a bit uncomfortable to change from a large room to a small room. The experience of the underwater restaurant was also very good. It was definitely not a real meal. The children were very happy that they did not ask to watch cartoons during the whole process.

msg:After many comparisons, we finally chose Tianfang InterContinental Hotel as our hotel to stay in Haitang Bay, Sanya. When I stayed in Yalong Bay before, I always felt that the hotels were generally old and the service was lagging behind. Although Lai Tianfang is an old hotel that has been open for ten years, it is well maintained and the management is very attentive. In particular, Xiao Yang, the one-on-one service ambassador, helped us solve many problems. Because it was a family trip, several rooms could not be arranged on the same floor, which was particularly inconvenient. Xiao Yang promptly communicated with the manager to help us cancel the original room type and arrange the closest room.
The design of the Tianfang InterContinental Hotel is relatively unique. The lobby is tall and spectacular. The appearance is like a big turtle (or golden toad) facing the sea and absorbing water vapor. There is a long green lawn leading to the sea, and there are different shapes of Feng Shui around it. The design should be an architectural work that has been guided by an expert. All in all, this stay was a good experience. Will definitely come again next time!

I highly recommend the premium sea view room. You can see the sea from the bed and the bathtub faces the room. sea. The hotel has thoughtfully prepared pillows of various softness and hardness and various baby products. You can ask the front desk for them. Whether you are checking in, changing rooms, or checking out, the concierge will proactively ask if you need help carrying your luggage. The hotel has its own beach area, where you can lie on a beach chair and watch the sea. It's very comfortable to order a coconut and drink it! If you don't go to the scenic spots, you can spend a day in the hotel, where you can snorkel, dive, dig in the sand and swim in the waves. During my stay, I also met a couple having a wedding. They set off fireworks on the beach at night, and the a**osphere was full! Oh, by the way, InterContinental still has butler-style service. The butler Xiao Su I met was very nice. He greeted me during check-in, check-out and every morning. He also responded quickly to any other needs.

msg:It can be said that it was an unexpected surprise to choose Kaaba Intercontinental for my vacation back home. I am very satisfied with it in every aspect.
First of all, it feels very good to be on vacation. The hotel is quieter and more leisurely than many family hotels. The garden, beach and rooms are relatively open, and the sandy beach is very fine. Whether you are walking in the garden or on the beach after a meal, or lying down on the balcony, It's very comfortable and makes people relax.
In addition, the interior of the room, toiletries and bedding are of very good quality. I am used to sleeping on tempur pedic mattresses, and I am most afraid of not being able to sleep on a bed when I go out, but the bed in the Kaaba is very comfortable.
I have to mention that the hotel is a 5-minute walk from the duty-free shop. My mother goes there every day, which is very convenient and very happy. I am also very satisfied with the fact that the room can watch the sunrise and the corridor can watch the night view.
Thanks to the housekeeper Xiaocui for providing us with considerate and enthusiastic service, making us feel at home. The room service is also warm and timely, and the breakfast has a lot of choices and the quality is up to standard.
Before checking in, I was worried about the construction site next to me after reading online posts. To be honest, I can see the construction site from the room, but there seems to be no construction, so I can't hear the noise, and it doesn't have much impact on the overall landscape. Posted some photos so you can judge for yourself.
Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, especially for people like me who want a leisurely vacation. I hope it will be helpful to everyone.

msg:I wanted to stay at Intercontinental before the Spring Festival, but I finally checked in successfully after the holiday. Before I even took off, I received a contact from the housekeeper Xiao Su, confirming the needs of children and other guests.
The check-in experience is very good. Suite guests will be led to the suite check-in area individually, and the staff will arrange for the elderly and children to sit and wait. The room is spacious, and I especially like the bathroom area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe InterContinental. The bathroom and shower room are very spacious, and an adult with two children can easily move around in the shower room. The bathtub is outdoors, which is a matter of opinion. I prefer it. There is actually a hollow fence near the bathtub, which takes into account sunlight, sea breeze and privacy. Haitang Bay is very windy, so in winter when the weather is cold and you don‚Äôt want to go to the swimming pool, you can take a comfortable hot bath on the balcony and watch the sea.
The children's playground is spacious and can be played by children of all sizes. I have never been to Yanlord. Among the St. Regis, Sheraton, Grand Hyatt, and Taikang Homes I have stayed in, it is the largest, and the second largest is the Grand Hyatt. Moreover, the children's parks of Intercontinental and Grand Hyatt do not have a trendy smell. A major feature of Intercontinental is that there are many free items. Except for fish feeding and snorkeling in the aquarium, other children's items are all free. The multi-person bicycles, electric cars, etc. next to it are all free. Next to the family heated swimming pool, there are also various free swimming rings, arm rings and even boats that can be borrowed. Riding on the small train is also free, and the staff will actively ask guests going to and from the beach hotel if they want to take a ride.
The executive lounge has a very good view. To be honest, I really like the view from the 17th floor. The waiters are also very nice. The elderly want to eat at the executive lounge, and the children want to eat other meals. The hotel's own restaurant can order it in advance and have it delivered to everyone. On the day of the Lantern Festival, we didn't have time to receive the gifts when we participated in the activities, so Xiao Su personally delivered them to the room that day.
The Undersea Restaurant is said to be the most cost-effective in Sanya. The buffet food is nothing special, but the snacks are more exquisite. But watching the mermaids while eating is really wonderful. It is still worth bringing your children to eat there. Be sure to reserve a seat in advance.
According to online reviews, Intercontinental is not very stable. The main reason is that the rooms face the construction site, so the experience varies greatly. If the budget allows, you can consider booking a sea view suite, which basically guarantees the view, but there is a small corner. When I saw the construction site, I personally felt it had little impact.

msg:I used to go to Sanya every year and stayed in almost all hotels in Haitang Bay. This time I chose Tianfang Intercontinental and I was not disappointed. The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, just a 10-minute walk away. The hotel focuses on parent-child activities and provides a variety of children's entertainment projects. It is also available for adults like us, which is rare. I booked a suite. The room was very large and comfortable for two adults and one child. Free access to the executive lounge was very affordable. The hotel's Tao Restaurant is an undersea buffet restaurant with a mermaid show, which is pretty good. The beautiful housekeeper Xiaocui asked us about our stay experience every day and responded immediately to any needs we had. She was very considerate. Overall, I am very satisfied and will choose Intercontinental again in the future.

msg:When traveling to Sanya this time, I compared many luxury hotels and finally chose Intercontinental Tianfang. It is next to the duty-free shop and only a 3-minute walk away. Haitang Bay is very fun and has beautiful scenery. It is also the closest to Atlantis.
The room is very large, with the ocean across the street and an unobstructed view. As soon as I open my eyes in the morning, I can see the beautiful sunrise. The room is equipped with all the facilities. The cleaning and care service is Byredo. Fruit is provided every day. Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay.
The breakfast is rich in variety. The Western and Chinese dishes are rich and delicious. They are very delicious. You will never taste the same thing even for a week. You can eat Hainan specialty vinegar, Wanning Hou'an noodles and other local specialties. It is open until 11 o'clock, which is very considerate.
I would like to praise the housekeeper Stella. She has been a friend since the first day she checked in. She is very friendly and gentle. She really cares about the guest experience. If I have any questions, she will patiently answer them. Cathy, the front desk who checked me in on the same day, I also like very much. She is very professional. Very gentle and a good impression
This was a very satisfying experience. I stayed for another eight nights. This is the hotel I will choose again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:For a family trip, I chose Kaaba Intercontinental with the attitude of giving it a try. It turns out that this is a seriously underestimated family hotel. From the moment we checked in, the girl on the far left at the front desk helped us check in. She was very enthusiastic, serious about her work, and friendly. This was the first good impression I had. Everything the child needs has been prepared in the room, including a stool for the child to wash his hands and step on, a stool for him to step on when he goes to the bathroom, a baby bathtub, a little yellow duck for bathing and playing, and a bath sponge. There are many activities for children to participate in, among which tree climbing is the most challenging one. Breakfast is one of the things I'm not very satisfied with this time. First of all, when I arranged the location, I felt it was very confusing. In addition, there are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is average. The bread and desserts are not delicious and there are few types. The midpoint is the steamed buns. It's all skin and almost no filling. There are no olives on the salad bar (pickles are placed in the place of olives), and there is no skim milk in the milk. By the way, I have a small suggestion. The capsule coffee machine in the room does not come with a small coffee cup. There is no way to remove the base under the coffee machine. I can only use the large coffee cup to hold the coffee with my hand. Overall, I am quite satisfied with everything. The best thing is that the service from check-in to room service is fast and responsive, with a warm attitude and a warm feeling. Next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will choose Tianfang InterContinental!

msg:Under the arrangement of our housekeeper Xiao Yang, we stayed in a suite. The upper floors were unobstructed and had a good angle. Xiao Yang was responsible and communicated with us in advance to understand our preferences and arranged them properly. The wind in Haitang Bay is indeed very strong and it is impossible to go into the sea, but the beach facilities are very good, the hotel is also large, and there are many rich activities, which is a good choice for parents and children. The suite we stayed in had breakfast for three people and executive benefits, which solved the problem of breakfast and dinner for three adults and one child, and the taste was very good. If you want to book an undersea restaurant, you should reserve a view seat early. Children still like it very much. The layout of the room is a bit special. The two beds are separated by a curtain instead of two rooms. The bathroom is huge and it is not crowded for four people. It is very good. I hope that when the hotel is renovated next time, the layout can be more reasonable and space division can be considered. Overall, I am very satisfied and will consider this place next time I come to Haitang Bay.

After checking in, we extended our stay for another day. The overall service and scenery are very good, the administrative courtesy is also well arranged, the room is tidy, the supplies are sufficient, and the service staff are also polite and patient. There are plenty of entertainment arrangements for children, and accommodation for the elderly is also good. I think a hotel that retains guests during the peak tourist season must be excellent in all aspects. Finally, I would like to give special praise to the person who contacted me, Xiao Yang, who was also very nice. I will stay here again if I have the opportunity.

msg:In the beautiful land of Sanya, InterContinental Hotel is undoubtedly my ideal place for a family vacation. It not only provides an unparalleled comfortable experience, but also adds endless warmth and joy to our family time.

When we set foot on this hot land with our parents and children, the housekeeper Xiaoxuan had already contacted us on WeChat in advance. She introduced us in detail to the hotel‚Äôs family activities, dining options and duty-free shop discounts, giving us a more comprehensive understanding of this vacation. On check-in day, we were informed that a room was ready for us, so we quickly packed our bags and headed to the Intercontinental.

We were impressed by Xiaoxuan's attentiveness and professionalism. She even considered that we and the elderly lived on the same floor so that we could take care of each other, and upgraded us to a room that was closer to us. As soon as we stepped into the room, we were attracted by the excellent room type and the magnificent sea view. It's like being in a beautiful picture, facing the sea, with spring flowers blooming. This is exactly the family vacation life we ‚Äã‚Äãyearn for.

In the next two days, we made a reservation for afternoon tea at an underwater restaurant, allowing the children to get up close to marine life and feel the charm of nature. The taste of afternoon tea is also quite good, adding a sweetness to our leisure time. In addition, we also booked a fish feeding activity. The price of 58 yuan is very affordable, which makes people feel that it is a great value for money. Sitting on the boat, we saw many turtles and small fish, as if we were in a magical underwater world.

Manager Wang Haiou of the Chinese restaurant also gave us meticulous care and service, making us feel the warmth of home during the meal. There is also Liu Chunxi in the children's area. He leads the children to catch crabs on the beach at night, making it fun for both adults and children. We also booked the photography service provided by the hotel and carefully selected some memorable photos to leave beautiful memories.

The most noteworthy thing is that the large lawn design of the InterContinental Hotel, which leads directly to the seaside, is so beautiful and convenient. Here, we enjoy the sunshine, sea breeze and green grass, and feel the gifts of nature.

All in all, everything about the InterContinental Hotel made us feel great! Not only does it have excellent parent-child activities, comfortable accommodation, delicious dining options and a professional service team, it also has an invisible power that brings family members closer together. Here we have gained wonderful memories and precious family time.

After checking in, I contacted Lucas several times for some minor issues, and he responded very quickly and solved the problem. I felt at ease during my stay at the hotel. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. The entrance to the Kaaba Intercontinental is very grand and the reception staff are very enthusiastic and will take the luggage to the room.

It has a large balcony and two beds, one large and one small, which is enough for four people. If you are slim or have small children, it will be no problem for five people. There are also two sinks. During our stay at the hotel, we chose the hotel's food delivery service. Scan the code or call, and the Chinese restaurant will deliver it to the room within 40 minutes. The hotel is very close to the beach. The hotel has a small tour train. We took the train for a while and walked the rest of the way to the beach. The sand on the beach is very clean and fine. It‚Äôs a wonderful travel memory!

The room in the suite was very clean, all children's supplies were well arranged, and a toiletry gift box was given as a check-in gift. The balcony is very large, and the children can take a bath in the bathtub on the balcony. The scenery on the balcony is also very beautiful, and you can see the entire lawn and the sea. The hotel has a heated swimming pool, which is very suitable for family outings. The children's playground is also rich in activities. The time periods are different every day, and the children can't keep up with it! The third day of my stay coincided with my birthday. The housekeeper Xiaoyang arranged the room decoration, cake and handwritten greeting cards, which was very considerate! In short, I will choose Kaaba Intercontinental for a family vacation next time I have the opportunity!

msg:A short one-day trip - the sea breeze on the beach in December is comfortable and pleasant; the sea view suite is luckily chosen in the middle, and the sea and green space look very healing.

In terms of service, the staff are very considerate ~ the store was closed in the middle of the night and the lady at the front desk helped find a lot of sanitary napkins (big thanks ü•π) and housekeeper Xiao Yang was also very enthusiastic (*¬ØÔ∏∂¬Ø*)

The location is really close to the duty-free shop! After exiting the gate, turn left and you'll be there in 5 or 6 minutes. It's a good place to come back and lie on the beach to bask in the sun when you're tired from shopping. There are many kinds of breakfast, and there are also small sausage machines and small popcorn machines for children (the level of childishness is just right for college students)

msg:I have stayed at many five-star hotels in Sanya, and I am most satisfied with the InterContinental Hotel in Haitang Bay. The service is outstanding. The hotel is high-end and the rooms are large enough. They pay great attention to details. It is suitable for a family vacation, and there are many things for children to do. There is a beach just outside the hotel. The sand in Haitang Bay is finer and softer than that in Yalong Bay.
Special thanks to the kind-hearted housekeeper Stella, whose name is easy to remember and means star in French. After meeting her, she was indeed as beautiful as her name suggests. She was as dazzling and shining as a star. She was upright, cheerful, kind and optimistic.

I spent a leisurely time these days. Because the room was full, breakfast and dinner were basically at 17 every day. I have tried all the three restaurants in the hotel without any surprises. I had a birthday in the middle of the night and the hotel even thoughtfully decorated the room and sent greeting cards and small cakes. The housekeeper Zora was very thoughtful and asked about my needs every day. The trip was really satisfying!

My housekeeper is a young lady (Wendy Xingzi) who is very nice and can consider all aspects of hotel guests. For example: She will take the initiative to ask hotel honeymoon guests if they need catering services; as long as they have any needs, she will respond instantly to provide help. Nowadays, there are very few butlers who can reply instantly, which is still good. Although this is not the first time I have stayed in a high-end hotel in China, they are the ones who can consider all aspects of their guests! I think the environment of a hotel is important, but more important is the service and accommodation experience provided to hotel guests‚ò∫Ô∏è
      We are also meticulous in our health services. My husband and I stayed here for a week, and they were cleaned very well every day, and even the scattered clothes were folded neatly! This really allows lazy people to completely free their hands~
      From an environmental point of view, the orientation of our room is also very well arranged (our housekeeper sister also specially arranged a floor with a wide view for us), facing the coconut grove and the sea. Every morning, I lie in bed and watch the sun rise gradually, starting a beautiful dayüòåWhen the sun is not shining in the afternoon, I can also sit on the sofa on the balcony, drink coffee and chat, looking at the sea in the distance, I feel very comfortable ~ This This is a leisurely vacationüèñÔ∏è„ÄêYou can enjoy the pictures below„Äë
      Of course, the hotel's breakfast has everything you need. It is simply a paradise for foodies üòù There are Chinese (soy milk, fried dough sticks, pancakes, fruit porridge, egg rolls, etc.), Western (bread, pizza, corn crisps, sausage, cheese, etc.), and local Hainan specialties (Hainanese noodles, pastries, etc.), I I am a foodie and not picky about my food. I can eat with gusto every morning and come home with a full belly of delicious foodüòã [You can enjoy the video below]
     Overall, this trip to Sanya was very enjoyableüòÄ

I really felt two completely different experiences from the same brand. If Kaaba Intercontinental hadn't come back to win, I really didn't plan to choose Intercontinental in the future.
Tianfang InterContinental's hardware facilities, software services, catering quality and other aspects are superior to those on the Mid-Levels Peninsula.
The check-in process was quick, and the front desk also helped us upgrade our room type for free. Our subsequent activities in the hotel went very smoothly with the help of our housekeeper Lucas. Lucas took the initiative to introduce us to the hotel's special activities. It not only has its own undersea sightseeing tunnel, but also has free shuttle buses to the airport and duty-free shops. The details of the room are also very good, including a Dyson hair dryer, a multifunctional bedside seat, pillows of various materials, and even the mattress can be chosen to be softer or harder according to personal preference. The hotel's breakfast is also rich in variety, and the chef at the made-to-order stall is very enthusiastic and not impatient at all. It feels like the chefs at each of their stalls are secretly competing. Whoever has the most customers eats the most winsüòÜ Every time I pass by, the chefs stare at me with expectant eyes and almost say: Eat more, eat some more Bar.
In short, I will choose Kaaba next time I come! Looking for a good night is really not enough

For a first-class hotel, zora is indeed a friendly butler with online communication skills. In order to make the trip experience better, zora took the initiative to upgrade my room.

Luggage is delivered directly to the room by the concierge. There are welcome fruits üçâ, free mini bar, and the parking lot on the ground üÖøÔ∏è. Next to it is the duty-free shop, which can be reached by walking a few hundred meters. The hotel is a little far from the beach üèñÔ∏è, and the concierge can also pick you up.


Hygiene: It is rare to find balcony sofas and indoor sofas near the sea that are quite clean, which proves that hygiene is in place.

Exclusive privilege - enjoy a Dyson hair dryer in all rooms upon check-in: Room Configuration
The only drawback: The TV cannot cast the screen, so it is recommended to keep up with the times.

Service: Some concierges still need to improve their etiquette level. When picking up and dropping off the beach or asking for mosquito repellent water, they will be polite and polite throughout the process.

I have to give a thumbs up to Kaaba‚Äôs service. After checking in, Stella, the housekeeper, saw that the child was feeling uncomfortable due to motion sickness and vomiting, so she brought the child a bowl of porridge, which was full of details.
At the same time, Stalla patiently helped us introduce the hotel's facilities and activities. Because the set meal I bought included coconut chicken hotpot and fish feeding on the shore, Stella reminded me to save the screenshot for easy retrieval, like üëçüèª
	
The children took a lunch break to regain their strength and participated in the hotel‚Äôs coconut tree climbing activity at 4:30. Although they only dared to climb to the first gift point, they had already surpassed themselves.
I went for a walk on the beach. The wind in Haitang Bay was really not that strong, but the sand was really fine.
Because my child got motion sick today, it was really a very special day for me to lie down.
	
facility:
After breakfast the next day, we went to the beach to ride the waves and dig sand. The hotel provided sand digging tools, towels, and water on the beach. The lunch set included ü••coconut chicken hot pot. Brother Da Cheng and I both liked it, it was delicious. My dad doesn‚Äôt like coconuts, hahaha, otherwise there won‚Äôt be enough food.
Went to the family swimming pool for a swim at around 2 o'clocküèäüèª‚ôÇÔ∏è. The wind was a little bit cold, but the water temperature was very suitable, and the towels were warm and easy to use, which was very considerate.
Later, I participated in the activity of traveling around the seabed‚ûïpainting, and took a group photo with the painting. Big Cheng was very happy.
Family activities:
The parent-child activities are very attractive. We only participated in climbing coconut trees and undersea painting. Other activities such as making waffles and sandwiches were also very interesting. Stella also reminded us that there are several places that need to be reserved in advance. If you have any questions these days, if you send Stella a WeChat message, she will get a reply in seconds. The service is perfect.
Special thanks to Stella for taking care of us these days and helping us apply for a late check-out at 2 o'clock, which made our return trip less stressful. Will come again next year

msg:In the early days of Sanya, I stayed at Mangrove Hotel and Hilton. In recent years, I stayed at Ritz-Carlton, Atlantis, Tianfang Intercontinental, and Coral Bay Oriental Mandarin. The Kaaba Intercontinental in this trip is quite satisfactory, with outstanding overall strength. Suitable for people with babies, who like to relax while watching the sea, and visit duty-free shops
Before traveling, the hotel would call me to ask about any special requests. On the day of check-in, one of them would do the formalities, and the other would be responsible for introducing the hotel facilities and maps. This way I was quite satisfied and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was wasting time waiting at the counter. After checking in, this person would give me a call. Bella, the hotel staff member I introduced, was assigned as my housekeeper this time. Perfect service from Bella.
Since I had to sleep with my breastfed baby, I made several special bed adjus**ents during this period, and Bella responded really quickly! And I was satisfied without any trouble! In the end, I removed the crib and put together an extra bed and bed rails next to the big bed. This was amazing. With the big bed room type 1109 on the 11th floor facing the sea, my husband and I would wake up naturally a few minutes before sunrise every morning. Refreshed and slept quite comfortably. We also watched the sunrise once! Continue to catch up on sleep. When I sleep, I leave the balcony door slightly open so I can fall asleep listening to the waves. I haven't encountered any mosquito bites here. Its air-conditioning outlet is naturally blocked by two mirrors, chandeliers, and bed backrests. This is really a good design to ensure the quality of sleep! There are trash cans at every foot where you can easily throw your rubbish. The aisle door opens automatically. Next to the luggage rack is a large table, which is very convenient for spreading things. These details are the highlight of Intercontinental.
Pictures 1 and 2 are of the corridor at the back of the room, pictures 4 and 5 are of the window, and the video is of the inside of the room. It all feels very open. Although there is a construction site, it does not affect the scenery. I also like the open-air balcony bathtub, where my husband and the baby with a baby lifebuoy can watch the sea and play in the water. Someone complained about the exposure before, but it was actually okay. It actually designed a fence and sliding door, but the person who complained didn't find the details.
This hotel feels comfortable and spacious. You can walk on the large lawn to the beach, push a stroller or take a small train there. Here comes another highlight. There are people taking photos at the beach. They are not provided by the hotel as travel photos, but it is really convenient. I met the guy with a round face and a very nice attitude. He took a photo and showed it to you. He said it was 20 pictures. If you need it, just look at the money given to you and direct it to you on the spot. For example, I thought I would pick three and gave the money to three, but he directed all the money to me. It saves time and is no burden. And it is true that the colors he takes are better than those taken with a mobile phone.
When I ate at the submarine restaurant, it was all hard dishes. The chicken soup was the first time in all the buffet restaurants that I tasted the same quality as the chicken soup at home. The Chinese restaurant set meal was upgraded with grouper. On the last day, I ate the coconut chicken hotpot that was complimentary when booking a room, which was also good.
The hotel is only five minutes away from the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop. If you have a baby, you can ask the hotel car to take it to the hotel entrance, and then push the baby stroller there, which is very close and convenient.
I took a look at the swimming pool and didn‚Äôt feel like it, so I didn‚Äôt swim. My next stop was the Mandarin Oriental at Coral Bay. It‚Äôs a different style with outstanding views. The Mandarin has a good swimming pool and self-service at the beach. But the sleep is really not as comfortable as the Intercontinental. There is a feeling of drawing energy.

Although we have not met in person, the service is attentive and the feedback is timely. The experience is very good. The location of the hotel is very convenient, just a few minutes walk to the duty-free shop. The garden design is also very good, with a high green plant coverage. It is very comfortable to walk leisurely in the hotel to the seaside. Along the way, you will encounter the hotel's small train that you can ride on, and there are also free tandem bicycles for riding. In addition, there are many kid-friendly facilities, games, and activities in the hotel, as well as small squirrel speakers that can be seen everywhere on the lawn. Various small animal shapes add to the childlike interest. Everywhere reflects the meticulousness and care of the hotel management, and everything is just right. . I experienced the buffet at the underwater restaurant. The a**osphere was full. I personally feel that the food can match the price. I am very satisfied. I will definitely experience it again if I have the opportunity in the future.

Service: The housekeeper Zora is very considerate and responds promptly to any questions or requests. When checking in, she recommended a room based on my needs. It faces the sea directly and cannot see the construction site. I am very satisfied and it directly improved my stay experience to a new level! For me, who has not been on vacation for three years, my first impression was very favorable, which directly increased my satisfaction with this trip. I will come again next timeüòÅ
Facilities: The hotel is very suitable for parents and children. The hardware design and services are in place. The needs of parents and children are considered. Although I did not bring the baby this time, I will bring the baby with me next time~ However, the refrigerator in the room cannot adjust the temperature. I need to freeze breast milk. , there was no free refrigerator. Zora was very attentive and kept it in the office, which solved a big problem.
Environment: I have the impression of a seaside resort hotel style. Open the curtains and face the sea directly. The lobby is very spacious and bright, the lawn is large, and the beach is not far away. It is very good.

The day before check-in, ZORA had contacted me in advance on WeChat to understand my special needs. After learning that I was traveling with an elderly person and a baby, ZORA contacted me after check-in. I was very happy to get a room upgrade for free. The room is super big and I can lie down and watch the sunrise. Because there are children staying, you can add a fence for children to board and other details. If you have any questions during your stay, you can directly contact the housekeeper ZORA. It is very convenient. Check in on the first day A cheesecake was given as a gift on the second day. After check-out, ZORA was very considerate and gave a small gift to the baby. The hotel's beach is very fine and sand digging tools are provided free of charge. The indoor children's playground is also very large. The children were too busy to play and refused to go back to the room. The breakfast is also very good, but it has been a bit cold in the past two days. It is a pity that the outdoor swimming pool is a bit cold.

It has everything a five-star resort hotel should have, especially:
1. The room is large in size, the bathroom and balcony are also large and all face the sea. You can watch the sea while bathing. The clever design does not require you to worry about privacy issues.
2. The overall environment of the hotel is relatively quiet, suitable for relaxing on vacation. Occasionally, I woke up before 7 o'clock one day and saw the sunrise over the sea from the balcony. The large lawn leads directly to the sea. Take a walk for a few minutes to watch the sea and listen to the waves.
3. The hotel staff are warm and friendly, and the room service responds quickly. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiaocui, who responded to our requests before and after our check-in and provided us with warm, attentive and thoughtful service.

When they learned that we were on honeymoon, they gave us customized greeting cards and beautiful mirror paintings, as well as a large fruit plate and cake.
All juices, mineral water, and coffee in the room water bar are free and unlimited! ! The swan made of towel also looks like a real swan! The swans in the hotel yesterday were beyond words... snails and geese.
After I found out I was pregnant, I put anti-makeup sponges on all the sharp corners in the room, which was super thoughtful!
There are many kinds of breakfast and the taste is very good.
The photos taken during the trip were all good, so they were packed right away!

Although the hotel has been open for a long time and the exterior wall does look a bit old, the in-room facilities are still maintained. It‚Äôs pretty good, very Southeast Asian. The room is very large, especially the dressing room connected to the desk, which is very convenient to use. There is also a dressing table in the key room, which is great! The bathtub in the room is on the balcony, which does have privacy issues. It doesn't matter if children use it.
    This time, Intercontinental's housekeeper Xiao Yang added me on WeChat early before check-in to understand our needs. The hotel package I ordered included an airport pick-up (drop-off), and she also arranged it in advance. I would like to mention the airport drop-off service here. The intercontinental car service is very good and very convenient. The hotel is right next to the duty-free shop, just a few minutes walk.
    The hotel room is far away from the beach, and there is also a courtesy car to pick up and drop off. Water and towels are also provided for hotel guests on the beach.
    This time I also experienced taking a small boat in the hotel to feed fish and turtles, which was quite interesting. It was the first time to see sea turtles so close up.
    The coconut chicken hot pot included in the hotel package also tastes great! The waiters are also very attentive.
    Very satisfied with this stay.

Miss Stella was very warm and thoughtful. The pillow was a bit high on the first night and I didn't get a good rest. On the second night, Stella helped change three different pillows.
The sea view room faces the sea. I set the alarm clock at 6:30 in the morning and opened the curtains to see the sunrise over the sea. After watching it, I continued to sleep and woke up early without pain.
Generally speaking, the service, environment, location, and food have all maintained the same level as InterContinental. I will choose InterContinental again next time I come to Sanya!

msg:It was really great to choose InterContinental for my honeymoon this time. Even before I arrived, Lucas, the butler, added my WeChat account and helped me arrange a room in a good location. Then he took me to check in. Afternoon tea was also arranged in the room. If you need anything, Tell him that everything will be resolved soon.
This time I was really pleasantly surprised by the intercontinental underwater restaurant. The mermaid sister gave me a thumbs up! !
The important point is that my room number is No. 15, and I can barely see the construction site next door, but the scenery is still very beautiful!
Before coming here, I had been struggling with which hotel to stay at, but after I came here, I felt that Intercontinental was still worth it!

msg:It was the first time I stayed at Intercontinental after many years. Before departure, the butler Xiao Yang took the initiative to call us to inquire about preferences and details. Then the concierge came to confirm the pick-up information before departure. As soon as we landed in Sanya, the driver was already waiting for us. We arrived at the hotel quickly After checking in, the room was ready~ The early communication was all clearly arranged, and small things such as clothes hangers and pedals for the children were ready. Before departure, Xiao Yang was informed that this trip was his parents' wedding anniversary. For my birthday, Xiao Yang specially wrote a card, decorated the room, and arranged a small cake. It was full of sincerity. In the next few days of my stay, I returned to the hotel late twice in the evening and went to Tianjin Hall to eat coconuts before closing the stall. Chicken, even though they are about to get off work, the waiters are always responsive to requests. The waiters, Jia Xuanting, Wu Xiaomeng and others are really very kind. After three meals in a row, I still can‚Äôt get enough of the coconut chicken in the restaurant. It‚Äôs so delicious! ! ! ! Recommend everyone to eat! ! ! Intercontinental's hardware and software are quite good, and the housekeeping staff are friendly and courteous. The children had a great time playing in the children's club and feeding the fish. When it comes to service, Butler Xiao Yang greeted him morning and night and gave all kinds of conscientious recommendations. When any minor problems arise during your stay, the service staff will take the initiative to ask and quickly help solve them without any prevarication. They are given full sincerity and service, which further enhances the experience of staying! Finally, I would like to thank the duty manager Zhang Yi for truly making the guests feel at home! I would also like to thank my best housekeeper Xiao Yang and Yang Shuning again. Thank you for your hard work~ I look forward to seeing you next time.

Yes, it‚Äôs close to the service desk, and the staff can take care of anything you need. For children‚Äôs projects, my son went on a treasure hunt and caught crabs on the beach. He was so happy.

We lost our room card on the first night, and she helped us get a replacement and sent it to the elevator. I asked if there was any ginger tea the next day and was given two large bowls of it. We forgot to bring our swimsuits when we left, so the housekeeper sent them to the second hotel for us. The service was really great! The hotel's public account has 1198. The lunch + afternoon tea + dinner package is quite cost-effective. There is no extra cost for playing with the train and electric cars. Swimming rings, arm rings and rowing are free. The children's activities in the evening are also very interesting. The breakfast is rich and proactive. Disposable bibs are provided. The beach sand is very fine, the beach is flat and open, and there are many small sand crabs. I will stay here again when I come to Sanya in the future~

[Butler Service] The hotel arranged an exclusive butler before check-in. Our butler is Lucas, and the service is very nice. Since I don‚Äôt know their working hours, I often bother him in the middle of the night to ask various questions, and Lucas answers them promptly and patiently. Yes, in short, you can ask the housekeeper for all questions during your stay here, which is very convenient and saves time.
[Accommodation] The room was very big and clean. What I care about most when choosing a hotel is whether the room facilities are old. The supporting facilities of InterContinental are relatively new.
[Eat] The coconut chicken hotpot included in the hotel package is so worth it! It is recommended to eat even if it does not include meals! The price is not expensive, but the five-star hotel standard coconut chicken is really much better than the ones outside. The breakfast is also super rich, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
[Play] The intercontinental outdoor swimming pool has slides, boats, various activities for children, small trains, and props for taking photos on the lawn, and they are all freeüÜì
[Shopping] Duty-free shop, just go there and walk for 5 minutes. There is nothing more convenient than this.

Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider Intercontinental because it is cost-effective, has complete supporting facilities, new facilities and good service! highly recommended

msg:InterContinental is really great. Everyone‚Äôs service is very warm and thoughtful. Before entering the hotel, there is an exclusive butler service, reminding and introducing various activities. My butler is Raina. The service is thoughtful and considerate throughout the whole process. If you have any questions Must answer! Besides, I am very satisfied with the underwater restaurant and coconut chicken given in the price this time, especially the experience of the underwater restaurant, the children are very happy! The hotel's small train travels between the beach and the lobby, saving a lot of energy! Although the beach cannot go into the sea, it is very beautiful. This time, the room type was upgraded and the check-out was delayed until 13:00. Drinks are replenished every day, and mineral water can be drunk wherever you want. Every waiter will greet you when they see you , and I can feel that it is not a perfunctory thing to develop the heart. This is really nice. Besides, the hotel lobby is very comfortable. There are band performances every night. It is really pleasant to drink wine and blow the sea breeze. Although the whole hotel There are a lot of guests but you really don't feel the noise, it's really comfortable! The only downside may be that the swimming pool is a bit small, but it's enough for children to play, it's still pretty good!

msg:This time, the family stayed at the Intercontinental for 4 nights. To sum up:
1. Harry, the hotel housekeeper, is very enthusiastic and can help solve any reasonable needs.
2. The staff in the children's world of the hotel are very dedicated. There are free activities suitable for children to play from 9:20 to 7:00 every day. (You can see the children's playground project arrangement in the second picture I posted Table) The focus is free, with quantity and quality. The children especially like to take the small train of the hotel to climb the coconut tree under the coconut tree. Every participating child has a prize. It can be seen that the hotel alone It is also a matter of heart, parents who bring their children to Sanya for fun can really choose InterContinental instead of stepping on the thunder.
3. The hotel room is spacious and big enough to live comfortably. The bathroom is also good. There is also a separate bathtub outside the balcony, which is perfect for soaking in the sea view. The minibar drinks in the room are free to drink, and will be added once a day without charge. There is no service fee for the hotel's meal service. It tastes good and is suitable for those who don't want to go out for food after playing in the water.
4. There is an underwater restaurant in the hotel that is self-service. Children under 1.4 meters are free, and the food is pretty good. You can see little turtles and mermaid shows.
5. The hotel's beach is very good, with fine sand.
6. The hotel is only a few hundred meters away from the duty-free area. It is suitable for shopping at 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. There is no need to queue up. For shopaholics, going back and forth several times a day will not delay the time of the hotel.
7. You can order takeaway, or you can go to the Duty Free Zone Phase 2 for food, which is very close, such as Burger King, and the price of Taier sauerkraut fish is the same as other places, and the portions are also sufficient.
In the past few times, I have stayed at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Sunny Bay, the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay, Sheraton, Sofitel in Haitang Bay, and Sheraton. I haven't stayed in other hotels, so it's hard to post. As far as the above is concerned, the convenience of children playing, adults shopping, and eating out and shopping is the first choice for InterContinental.

msg:The InterContinental is the first hotel I stayed at in Haitang Bay. It is located right next to the duty-free shop and is very convenient to walk to. The environment is also very good. The housekeeper Lucas responded to requests and upgraded to a sea view room, with an unparalleled view. There are a lot of activities for children here, and it has its own children's playground. There are different activities for children to participate in from morning to night every day. Children's swimming armbands, boats, and various life buoys are provided free of charge in the swimming pool, and sand digging tools are also provided free of charge on the beach. I knew that I would not bring these by myself. It is really easy to move in with a baby and worry-free.

msg:Having stayed in many high-end hotels, I did a lot of homework before coming to Sanya this time. After all, there are too many hotels to choose from. After comparing factors such as price, room size, supporting facilities, and geographical location, I finally chose InterContinental. Sure enough, the hotel is worthy of my more than a month's efforts.
Let‚Äôs talk about transportation and location first: InterContinental is right next door to the Duty Free City, 5 minutes‚Äô walk to Phase 1 for shopping, and 15 minutes‚Äô walk to the opposite Phase 2 for dinner (Phase 2 is mainly for eating, while Phase 1 is for shopping), and it‚Äôs right there in Phase 1 Just cross a flyover. It is the hotel closest to Duty Free City. In terms of supporting facilities, it should be the most complete, so there is basically no business in the InterContinental Hotel, so the whole hotel is much quieter and suitable for vacation.
Service: This must be mentioned. From the day before we checked in to the moment we left the hotel, the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the waiters can be felt everywhere. The housekeeper Shirley is responsible for tracking the whole process, meeting all our requirements, and if there are any questions and things that need to be resolved, just a WeChat message and reply immediately. We booked a suite, and the package gave us an executive trea**ent. This courtesy is a real courtesy. As long as you are in the hotel, you can enjoy it in all aspects. The whole check-in experience has improved to more than one level: when you check in, go to the VIP area to check in (it was already a non-busy time when we arrived at the hotel, and no one checked in. The sisters at the front desk didn't tell us that there was a VIP area to handle it for us, but we didn't know it. After seeing the room we booked and the courtesy, they immediately apologized and took us to the VIP area to help us handle it. Through this It can be seen from the details that their daily training on VIP service has gone to the core). One day includes breakfast (you can choose to go to the ordinary cafeteria on the B1 floor or the VIP restaurant on the 17th floor. The difference is that there are many people on B1, but there are relatively many varieties. There are not many people on the 17th floor. You can eat while looking at the sea, but the variety is relatively large. Not much. Personally, I think it‚Äôs actually quite a lot. You have everything you need, and you can drink as many drinks as you like), afternoon tea starting at 3 pm (VIP restaurant on the 17th floor) and light meals starting at 6 pm (this light meal is considered a simple The ceiling of the meal, although there is no meat, but staple food such as porridge, noodles, rice and cakes are all available, and there are many good wines to drink casually). So we basically didn't go out to eat. The first is that we are afraid of being cheated, and the second is that the hotel is fully satisfied. In addition, it includes room decoration, welcome fruit, daily replenishment of drinks (seven types), snacks (Snickers bars) and gifts (little turtles). The small gifts (travel suits), towels weaved into small animals and other details from the courtesies show that the service is really good.
Hotel facilities: InterContinental fully interprets what a parent-child hotel is, adding all elements that can satisfy guests and make them happy (especially children). Let me talk about those who are interested in children first: there is a children's club in the hotel (it is very large, and there are many different types of activities for children to play every day), a small train (free of charge, as long as you ask for it, basically can meet it, we propose to go around Walk around the central lawn twice, come right away), children's electric cars (outside the children's club on the B1 floor, free), trampoline, slides, game consoles, fish feeding by boat (feeding sharks and manta rays in the large central fish tank , turtles, 58/person) and a pool for playing bubbles (starting at 5:30 p.m. every day); adults can play snorkeling and deep diving (for a fee, in the diving club on the B1 floor, personal feeling is better than diving in Boundary Island) More, of course! Just in a big fish tank), three-person bicycle, archery fitness, adult pool, family pool (I thought at first that with the adult pool, the family pool should be shallow, but in fact there are many places that are very deep , only part of the shallow water provides a lot of fun, and there are lifesaving arms, etc.), table tennis (free), billiards (free), tennis (charged). Of course, not counting the very beautiful beach, the sand is very fine and slippery, it is very good to watch the sunrise, and it is also a good choice to come here in the evening to enjoy the sea breeze. In terms of food, the hotel has a Chinese restaurant, a cafeteria, a VIP restaurant on the 17th floor, and the most famous underwater restaurant on the B2 floor. Of course, the price is not cheap.
Design: The design of the hotel is also very good. The lobby is open, and it feels very cool without air conditioning. Going to the back is a big fish tank with many deep-water fish (diving fish feeding and other items are here), and then there is a super big fish tank. The lawn (the hotel also thoughtfully set up two football goals), on both sides of the lawn is the villa area, if you pay attention carefully, you can see squirrels on the trees. The lawn leads down to the beach. That is to say, the beach can directly enter the hotel, and although the beach is open, but there are very few people, it is a pity that you cannot go into the water.
Room: Come to the room that everyone cares about most. The hotel has a total of 17 floors, but it seems that there are no 13-14 floors. In fact, it should be 15 floors. The corridor on each floor faces the northwest (that is, the second phase of Duty Free City), where you can watch the sunset. The room is facing east and south, as long as it is high enough, you can basically see the sea. The biggest advantage of InterContinental is that it has the largest room area under the same price. The price-performance ratio is super high, which is one of the reasons why I choose InterContinental. This time I chose a connecting suite (actually a sea view room + a suite), 208 square meters, big enough and comfortable. And there is a bathtub on the balcony. Watching the sea soak your feet can clear away the fatigue of the day.
       It took me an hour to write this review, which is already the limit for someone like me who doesn't usually like to write reviews. The main reason is that the whole family was very happy and satisfied with staying here during this trip (the hotel that went to Haihua Island later had a huge gap). I hope that I can help more friends who have a hard time choosing a hotel when traveling to Sanya. If I have the chance, I hope to come again.

msg:It's the first time I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel, and I feel very good. From the hotel environment to the room, to the food and beverage, to the service, everything is great. It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive. The hotel has a butler, who will contact the customer after placing an order with Ctrip. The butler who received us was Justin, a young man who worked very hard. If we had any needs or doubts, we would tell him and he would reply and solve them one by one. The service is good. It's not like staying in a five-star hotel before and no one cares about it. We like the hotel's lawn leading to the beach. After the rain in the summer morning, the green lawn is more beautiful. We walked and took pictures while walking on the lawn, Hainan blue, coconut trees, and the sea blue in the distance... It's too beautiful, and it is also the most enjoyable visual and spiritual relaxation during vacation. The sea in Haitang Bay is very clean, and there are few people in summer. Many times, you can have a whole beach by yourself üèñÔ∏è, stop and go, stare at the sea in a daze, let go, clean up all the backlogs in your heart, and make yourself like the sea, clear and wide. Modern people continue to absorb every day, healthy or unhealthy, active or passive, unconsciously, will accumulate a lot of "garbage", we need to clean it up in real time. Facing the sea, one of the best clean ups. So, if you want to take a vacation, relax, and play in the water, let's go, Haitang Bay is a good place.

msg:The check-in experience is very good, the room facilities and bedding are very comfortable, the free minibar, afternoon tea, and happy hour provided make people feel that the room type booked is worth the money. The service staff are very friendly, and the butler Harry is also very nice. He contacted me the day before check-in, introduced some basic information of the hotel, and asked if there is any need. Then he actively tried to solve our need for late check-out, because although the reason for the full room was not resolved satisfactorily, he also tried his best to extend it for us by an hour. The hotel is very close to the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop. It takes only 5 minutes to walk out, which is very convenient. This is the first time I stayed in a hotel in Haitang Bay. Except that the beach is not as soft and delicate as Qingshui Bay like Yalong Bay and Lingshui, and there are too few supporting services and washing equipment, the hotel itself is really great. Comfortable. There is a small flaw. When the TV in the room is turned on, there is a welcome message welcoming Mr. or Ms. to check in. The name typed out in Chinese does not match the English one. I don‚Äôt know what the operation is. Also, the TV is really stuck. Although I basically don‚Äôt watch TV, but the kid turned it on, and I just glanced at it and found the problem. There are still some small flaws in the details. The flaws are not hidden, but the overall experience is still very enjoyable, and it is worth staying again.

This is the second hotel in Sanya. To be honest, my expectations are not that high, but I am very, very satisfied with the stay. It is much better than the luxury brand in Yalong Bay before.
1 I felt the service from the moment I checked in, confirmed the room and restaurant in advance, and added WeChat to inform me about the reservation methods for various activities, etc. After check-in, there are all kinds of relationships in every possible way. They are thoughtful in all aspects and respond in a timely manner. Every service staff in the hotel is very enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Justin, who is very, very nice.

2 The hotel is full of activities every day, and the baby is very happy
3 The beach of Haitang Bay is much better than that of Long Bay. The sand is very fine, and it is not as windy as others have said.
4 It is very convenient to walk to the duty-free shop for three minutes
5 The room is always a bit old, but it is acceptable. After all, the price/performance ratio is quite high, and the sea view is also good

The two fly in the oin**ent are a little bit far from the beach; the categories and tastes of the cafeteria are relatively average

Although the room was upgraded to a full sea view, it was very hot because of the exposed roof above. This room is not recommended. The housekeeper, Justin, is in charge of us. He basically responds quickly to WeChat, and accepts all suggestions humbly. However, we can improve on the fact that he didn‚Äôt take the initiative to meet with us. Every time we go to a hotel with a housekeeper, the housekeeper will come to say hello, which is also a kind of politeness. . In the middle, I changed to Shangri-La and stayed for one night, then changed back to InterContinental. I contacted Justin to arrange a room. 1015 is facing the sea view, but there is a roof under it, which is somewhat unsightly. Next time, I will let Justin arrange it in advance. In addition, the manager surnamed Li in the lounge on the 17th floor also wanted to praise her by real name. I casually said something perfunctory by Benedict, and she immediately responded that she received feedback from the housekeeper after the meal, and every time she went to the bar for the first three days She remembers what I want, and the other few waiters are far behind, especially the newcomer and the one who came up to help and a male waiter who serves at night. Intercontinental is really suitable for bringing children, the swimming pool is shaded, the small train is free, the swimming ring arm circle is free, the beach side pool side club has free mineral water, seven activities are free every day, but the coin-operated facilities are too expensive, compared to ours Beijing is expensive.

msg:The InterContinental in Haitang Bay can be said to be the king of cost performance. The service is five stars. From the moment I entered the door, I received Anna's considerate service like a spring breeze, and the butler Shirley's enthusiasm and patience made appropriate arrangements. Every staff member I encountered had an extremely good service attitude. I was really touched. The sea view is five stars, the beach is delicate, and the sea view is also beautiful. Even if you live on the middle floor, you are very comfortable. The bed faces the sea, and you can see the sea when you open your eyes. The rides are also very special. Children's snorkeling is safe and fun, which is not available in other hotels. Seeing turtles and swallow rays at the entrance of the underground underwater restaurant is no worse than Atlantis. There is also a large lawn, which is very suitable for children to play football. The living environment is superb, very quiet and very humane. One of the most important parts of my visit to Haitang Bay is to go to the hotel. This time, the intercontinental trip is perfect. Oh, by the way, the hotel's coconut chicken set meal is also delicious.

One-stop food, drink and play to meet all the needs of children. Next to it are Sanya duty-free shops, which meet the shopping needs of adults. The hotel garden design is so perfect, it's great! There is also a personal butler who serves you 24 hours a day. Our butler Xiao Yang is very good. He coordinates and handles the questions of the guests. I like this one.

msg:Before this trip to Sanya, I struggled with choosing a hotel for a long time, and finally chose the Kaaba InterContinental. I am glad that I did not choose the wrong one. InterContinental has a lot of parent-child activities. Except for snorkeling in the aquarium and feeding fish and turtles, all activities are free. Children have a great time playing from morning to night every day. The breakfast is rich, but there are too many people on the -1st floor, and sometimes you need to queue up. Fortunately, this time the suite provides executive trea**ent. There are much fewer people dining in the executive restaurant on the 17th floor, and there is free afternoon tea. Before I left on the last day, I encountered a small episode. A bug entered the room. Thanks to the help of customer service Xiao Yang and Manager Zhang, it was quickly and smoothly resolved. Overall, the InterContinental experience this time is still very good, and the whole family is very happy!

msg:I never bother to comment, but this time I have to write down some real feelings to prevent those who are misled by the good reviews.
I took the elderly and children on vacation, a total of 4 people, a total of 5 nights, 2 nights at the MGM, and 3 nights at the Kaaba Intercontinental. I originally planned to stay at the MGM, but was frightened by some people who commented that the MGM was old. , I saw that the Kaaba Intercontinental had a very high rating, so I chose to stay at the Kaaba Intercontinental again. The average price per person for 4 people was almost the same on both sides, but the result was disappointing and the gap was huge.
1. There are two shortcomings of the Tianfang Intercontinental. First, the area facing the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is not wide, and it has a narrow and deep layout. It seems that the hotel has a long way to go to the beach, so the sea view is difficult to see from any room upstairs. Reluctantly, even the best sea view room I booked is the same. On the left is a wasteland to be developed, and on the right is the Duty Free City Phase 2 construction site. Standing in the room and looking at the sea view, I really want to narrow my horizons. Compared with the MGM Supreme Sea View Suite It‚Äôs simply incomparable, you can see the difference in the video
2. The second flaw is the Kaaba Intercontinental lobby. Various bars, corridors, elevators, and room passages are fully open design. This design is in Sanya, especially in summer. It is really hot. The west-facing room passage is really hot. The death corridor is long and sunny, but it is the only way back to the room. The breakfast room is also hot except under the air-conditioning vents. This hotel is really hot everywhere except the room.
3. There is a problem with the management of the breakfast queue. Queuing is normal. It is understandable that one person queues for a family of three or four people. When I arrived around 10:10 and waited in line for about 20 minutes, a woman with a Beijing accent in front of me, Not only did I queue for my family of 4, but I also queued for her two other friends, a total of 11 people, when they were about to enter. The waiter didn't care. When I was sweating in the queue and watched others swaggering in, I regret coming here again, and not only this group of people, but also a father and son who queued up behind me were brought in by friends inside after waiting in line for a while. Why do people queue up for this kind of management?
4. There aren‚Äôt that many parent-child entertainment options at Kaaba Intercontinental. The location of the hotel is a bit awkward. I feel like there‚Äôs not much to do if you‚Äôre a couple, or if you‚Äôre bringing children or the elderly, it‚Äôs quite boring. Plus, it‚Äôs hot everywhere. So much so that my children didn't want to participate in any of the hotel's arrangements for the three days except playing in the room and visiting scenic spots outside. They were only interested in climbing coconut trees, but they didn't do it every day. They didn't go to the beach at all because it looked like they had to walk a long way. On the first day my child checked in, he cried and said he wanted to go back to MGM, so I wanted to take a family to experience it and thought it would be better to go to InterContinental. In fact, the result was really a slap in the face.
5. In terms of service, I would like to say that both companies have their own problems. There are indeed many people at MGM, and the check-in process takes a long time. There are not many people at the Intercontinental, and the check-in process does not take long, but no one will care about you after the check-in process. Let me tell you which way to get to the guest room elevator. I carried two heavy bags into the lobby at night, and the waiter at the door pretended not to see it. So many comments said that the service was good, but I really didn't feel much about it.
The good thing is that the bedding is quite comfortable, and both beds are quite comfortable. Maybe the only advantage of InterContinental is that it is close to the duty-free shop. The regular breakfast may be slightly better in InterContinental, but I got executive trea**ent at MGM, so it's okay. There is a semi-buffet ordering breakfast at the executive restaurant by the beach. The food there is very good.
Generally speaking, Intercontinental feels empty, deserted and hot. MGM has different places to play during the day and night. Parent-child and beach activities are more abundant and mature. The old situation is actually good enough to be ignored. InterContinental is in This aspect is also a bit old and has no advantages.
Comparing these two, family vacation is better to go to the beauty pageant.

msg:This is the last stop of this family outing, two rooms for two nights
Environment: The hotel is large overall, with an elegant environment, and the landscaping is also well done. It is very close to the duty-free shop, and it takes 10 minutes to walk there. To go to the nearest beach, you can take the small train in the store. The sand is very fine, but it's a pity that you can't swim in Haitang Bay. The environment of the breakfast room and Chinese restaurant is also very good. Breakfast dishes are also delicious.
Hygiene: The sanitation is very good, the linen bathtubs are relatively clean and comfortable, and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. The dining environment is very good. The public swimming pool and the slides in the children's area are a bit dirty. Maybe it rains a lot in those days and the cleaning is not timely enough.
Facilities: The room is very good, with a large area, a large balcony and a bathtub, and the wet and dry separation is also very good. The light in the room is slightly dark, which is acceptable. The small bar in the room is very thoughtful. The baby also likes the drinks and snacks. The room has everything that should be there.

Service: The most important service, butler stella and the hotel reservation depar**ent, have been contacted in advance before check-in to facilitate travel. The service level can also be maintained after check-in, which facilitates check-in and gives us a better room. Thanks Stella~. In the Tianfu restaurant inside the hotel, the environment and dishes are also very good, and the manager Wang is also very enthusiastic. Of course, there is also the underwater restaurant Tao, where the service staff are very enthusiastic. The variety of buffet is also good, relatively fresh.

But there was a small episode during the stay. The sightseeing elevator was being repaired that day, but there were no barriers or any reminders. After we swiped the card to board, the baby was trapped in the elevator for 5 minutes. There was also a sudden fall and emergency stop, and the baby was crying. It was caused by the lack of safety awareness of the hotel maintenance unit. In the end, the hotel manager on duty called to apologize..

Overall, the merits outweigh the demerits, and I still recommend everyone to stay here if everyone has a sufficient budget.

msg:The lobby is very stylishly designed. The front desk upgraded us to a sea view room on the 16th floor for free. The room has butler service and fresh welcome fruit. We think the intercontinental service is the most considerate when we travel with our friends. We have been to many hotels in Sanya. Compared with the services of the Sheraton Wanning Hotel and Haitang Bay Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel that I stayed in the past two days, the service of Tianfang is the best. Every waiter is polite. After we leave the room, the room service will clean up immediately, waiting for me The room will be very tidy again when you come back, and the design of the electric curtains in the room is also very user-friendly. It will automatically open when you enter the door. It will automatically close when you leave the room. The hair dryer is Dyson, and the toiletries are also very useful, especially our housekeeper Justin is online at any time. , let us make an appoin**ent for the shuttle bus to the airport in advance, which makes us very worry-free. Next time we come to Sanya, we will choose his homeüëç

InterContinental Sanya Haitang Bay Tianfang Resort has the temperature of home.
The hotel is clean and hygienic. In the sea view room, you can overlook the sea view from the balcony. You can enjoy the sea breeze and drink red wine. It‚Äôs comfortable~ In addition, the hotel has a rich variety of breakfasts, and I have eaten Hainanese specialties. The hotel service is thoughtful and considerate, especially Zhang Wenhao, the concierge manager, because our return flight was delayed for two hours, he gave us a late check-out after communication, which saved a lot of trouble. Coconut groves, beaches, lawns...every frame in the hotel is a landscape. It's a pity that I didn't book a follow-up photo. I recorded the scenery in every corner here, and I will make up for it in the coming year.

We came from Yalong Bay, got off the bus and took the initiative to help with the luggage, loaded the luggage cart and sent it to the room, praise. Check-in was also very smooth. We booked two rooms and cleaned one for us to rest. We didn't encounter the situation of waiting for several hours as mentioned on the Internet, and we even upgraded the sea view room for free. The scenery is very good. The family Everyone is very satisfied.
Speaking of the service, I am also very satisfied. All kinds of services are very good, especially the housekeeper Raina, who is very attentive to meet the needs of customers, and the communication is very comfortable.
The lobby of the hotel is very grand, and the environment is relatively quiet. It occupies a large area and is easy to go shopping. There are also a variety of parent-child entertainment activities. The sea view room is very large and comfortable to live in. In terms of hygiene, it is the most reassuring hotel for this trip. Five-star praise. It's a pity that the two days in Haitang Bay were mostly thunderstorms. If the weather is fine, it will be more beautiful.

msg:Clean and good service. However, the restaurant's crisis management needs to be strengthened. Halfway through lunch, the power, air conditioner, and lights were cut off due to maintenance. It is actually very dangerous to eat hot pot with open flames and children. But the manager sent fruit to the room, and it was very easy to avoid the additional chicken. For maritime affairs, we only delivered an afternoon tea upon request. This is not handled very well by Intercontinental! I don't want to eat afternoon tea either, I just want to see how to deal with it.
I didn't finish my breakfast the next day, so I took my place away when I came back with some fruit. The waiter said that it was for me and the child to give the young coconut, I smiled and said no. I joked that there was a power outage yesterday and I would close the seat if I didn‚Äôt finish eating today. Tried to see what they would do with it, and got nothing. This is the only downfall! Otherwise, everything is very good, especially the butler Xiaoyang, highly recommended! Responds almost in seconds, thoughtful.
I really like the room.
Still highly recommended. Now in Shangri-La, the room is much older.

msg:It is very pleasant to live at the Intercontinental this time
The hardware conditions of the InterContinental still feel that it is not as good as another parent-child hotel. The breakfast is average, the swimming pool is too small, and the room is too dark
However, because of the service, it has directly improved a few grades. The service of the butler Yang Shuning when you check in is really refreshing. The detailed and kind explanation makes the next journey very simple. If you have any problems, you can find the butler to solve them perfectly. First of all He took the initiative to help us upgrade the room, the room view is great, there is a capsule coffee machine, the room smelled a little at the beginning, and immediately arranged to deodorize, the effect is also very good, the bedding is very comfortable and the mattress is very comfortable, the room is large, the bathroom also oversized,
Later, I mentioned the catering part. The service of the female manager of the restaurant (I don‚Äôt know the name, but she is pregnant with the baby) is even better. Thank you very much for your service, so that we can eat well for 4 days. I hope the hotel will help her add chicken legs
The housekeeping depar**ent also cleaned up very cleanly, brought us a large box of water, and took things out very quickly.
Now I am in the Fairmont Hotel, and I am shocked by their poor service. It is not as good as the InterContinental in all aspects. Those who are hesitant about these two hotels can give up Fairmont directly.

Free swimming rings are provided in the swimming pool. Small trains, multi-person bicycles, and children's toy electric cars are free, and activities are also available. Very plentiful with very little extra charge. The underwater restaurant is especially recommended.

The sea view room we ordered is facing the sea and has a very good view. The receptionist, Xiao Yang Marnie, is very considerate. He heard that we are taking care of the children, and arranged a small tent and a small wooden horse for our room. There are also children's toiletries and slippers. The entertainment facilities are complete, suitable for lying flat vacations. The morning buffet can be eaten until 11 o'clock, skipping lunch directly.

The hotel has a super big lawn, and the small train rides are free for unlimited times. My baby is so happy. I came in the off-season. The price is cheap and there are few people. I don‚Äôt want to leave

The sound insulation effect of the large solid wooden door is very good. The only disadvantage of the whole hotel is that the road to the beach is a bit far away.

We lived on the 11th floor and didn't hear the sound of construction at all. The children in the underwater restaurant especially like to eat while watching the fish, but there are not many types of dishes. We were lucky to meet someone who proposed marriage. The Chinese restaurant tasted much better than I expected. Those who went there with the mentality of stepping on thunder did not step on thunder. There are many types of breakfast. On the day of check-out, the children didn't eat much breakfast because they were in a hurry to catch the plane. They proposed to pack some pastries for the children and the staff quickly packed them. The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, and it takes more than ten minutes to walk there. The only suggestion is that the hotel restaurant does not provide disposable bibs for babies. It would be better if it can be improved. Next time I go to Sanya, I will consider staying in the Kaaba intercontinental.

The photos are invincible. My child has a fever and the staff sent cheesecake to the room. Very caring. It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop. The bathtub on the balcony can soak in the bath and watch the sea.

The room is quite large, well-equipped, and there is a Dyson refrigerator, and the drinks and biscuits in the refrigerator will be replenished every day after drinking. It‚Äôs just that those game consoles in front of the children‚Äôs activity room can be moved indoors, it‚Äôs too hotüòÇ
Hygiene: The room is very clean, probably because we live on the 16th floor, there are no mosquitoes, and the children sleep soundly at night. I didn't expect this, so I like it.
Environment: Over the years, Sanya has stayed in several hotels one after another. Needless to say, the green gardens are very good, but the beach in Haitang Bay is less than that in Yalong Bay, and you can't swim in the sea. Compared with other hotels, there are fewer Kaaba swimming pools, one for adults and one for children. There are not many facilities for children to play in the swimming pool, but it is enough for children to have fun.
Service: The overall service is okay. The day before the arrival, the housekeeper Yang Shuning sent some introductions to the hotel activities and booked the hotel bus. On the day we came here, we turned on the air conditioner in advance, which greatly improved our favorability. We also recommended Tianfu Chinese Restaurant, which is really good. If it wasn‚Äôt for the time limit on the last day, we probably would have to use it three times. In addition, the little brother Xue Xianzan who brought the baby to the event is also very nice.
So on the whole, the Kaaba has won the satisfaction of the family, the children had a good time playing, the wife had a good time shopping, it is too close to the cdf üòìüòì, and finally the wallet is not happy.

Almost every year since my child was 7 years old, I came to Sanya for travel photography (I didn‚Äôt come during the two years of the epidemic). The Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel is a must-stay hotel üòÅ Apart from the clean and comfortable rooms, the beautiful underwater restaurant, and the extension to Apart from the large lawn by the sea, the most worth mentioning is the hotel's butler service. This time, my butler Stella made me feel at home. I can really have a meeting. Stella gave me a small surprise (the hotel‚Äôs mermaid princess doll) and a big surprise. When I opened the door of the room, I couldn‚Äôt help but "wow" I came out üòÖ (because Stella quietly helped me upgrade the room) I also prepared bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, and anti-mosquito bracelets for the children. Kindly told me, "Give children more anti-mosquito bracelets, preferably on their feet. You have to go outside to take pictures, and mosquitos will prefer children." After checking in, there was a small episode, the air conditioner in the room went on vacation I went üòÖ I contacted Stella for the first time, and of course it was resolved smoothly and efficiently. I must give a big thumbs up here üëçExcellent! I feel that the employees of Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel have a very positive working attitude, and they also actively provide guests with a good check-in experience. I hope that Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel will get better and better, and look forward to seeing you next timeüòä

The customer service said that the climate in Sanya caused many mosquitoes. The Duty Free City opposite is under construction. I directly upgraded to a deluxe sea view room. The room is quiet and has a beautiful view. I stayed for 4 nights and there were no mosquitos in the room. Although Ctrip showed that it was a hotel renovated in 2014, the room facilities are very new. It can‚Äôt be seen that it is a hotel in 2014. ;The attitude of the service staff is super good, as long as they look at each other, they will say hello, and the butler Stella is also very enthusiastic. If you have any requests, you will deal with them in a timely manner. Like it; the breakfast is self-service, from 7:00 to 11:00, with a variety of varieties , You can also pack bread and drinks. I highly recommend their beef ball noodles and chicken noodles. They also ate their coconut chicken and seaside barbecue. I recommend it; if you bring children to play, you can soak in the children's pool and go to the beach. I have participated in a few parent-child activities, and I feel average. Generally speaking, the hotel's facilities, environment and services are worthy of its price. I will come again next time Sanya tourism will come againüòÑ

msg:I had a good impression of the hotel before booking and read a lot of reviews. They are all surprisingly high. It is said that I have lived in several hotels in Sanya, and this is the best one! We were looking forward to a very high trip, but the first second when we came to the hotel, we felt overwhelmed! The front desk of the hotel arranged the check-in warmly and carefully, and upgraded the sea view room! Let us see such a beautiful blue sky and sea! During the check-in process, we were also introduced to the hotel's children's activities and services. In short, after arriving, I was radiated by the gentle and considerate hotel service, and when I got to the room, I was shocked by the spacious room furnishings and the endless sea view! In the next few days of staying, the feeling is really amazing and meticulous! The refrigerator is always full of drinks and biscuits that children love to eat. The water on the bar is always replenished with more than 6 bottles. The room was tidy and clean. The bathrobes, bath towels, toiletries, and bath series in the guest rooms are all from Braide. Every time I go out and come back, I have replaced it with a new one. When I go out in the morning, the bathrobe and towel are replaced with new ones. When I came back to sleep at noon, the clothes in the room were neatly folded, and the bed in the room was re-made and cleaned up! When I came back at night, the room was replenished and cleaned again! Every time I go out and come back, it is a clean and tidy new room. Really want to praise the service of the hotel! Every time I needed something, I called the hotel room and it was delivered quickly. The hotel breakfast is also very rich, and the activities for children are also very rich and interesting. Climb coconut trees and feed turtles. There is also a very interesting children's swimming pool, and the children refuse to come up to play! There is also a range of fun activities at the pool. The most important thing is that we found that you don‚Äôt need to bring any real toys, the hotel has carefully considered them for you! All kinds of swimming rings, pool toys, including boats, water guns, floating blankets, and basketballs. Even details such as water and towels have been considered, so you don't need to bring anything. You can go straight down in your swimsuit! The swimming pool not only provides towels, but also is hot. This is really, really sweet! This time, from food to accommodation to play, the impression of the hotel in all aspects is so good that it explodes! And in fact, we met a few families who went to other places first, and they all said that the online celebrity hotel we booked before was not good at all, and they all said that after coming here, they think this place is great! Same as word of mouth online! It can be seen that the hotel is really building a brand and reputation with heart, and it is a truly good brand! We decide now! Come back next year!
  There was also a small episode. I caught a plane and found a small suitcase left in the hotel. I contacted the hotel staff. The staff immediately gave feedback and patiently helped me arrange to send it back. Received the box today, thank you very much! Such a good service, such a good hotel, I will definitely come back next year!

First of all, the service is very nice. The guy at the front desk, Xiao An, is handsome and enthusiastic. Watching us take the children with us, he took the initiative to upgrade the room for us. The invincible sea view is really amazing. The other waiters are also great, the luggage is delivered to the room by the younger brother, and the younger sister immediately delivers the fruit. It may be seen that our family members are all chubby, and we also gave two plates of fruit. Everyone is polite, warm and smiling. The room facilities are also good. There are two oversized sinks, and the bathtub is on the balcony. I'm sorry to take a bath. Have you seen the glass of the shower? You can see the sea view when taking a shower. The hotel is very close to the seaside, passing through a large lawn, especially for filming. My baby has enjoyed playing football. The water quality of the hotel swimming pool is very good, and there are bubble parties. Besides eating, the Tianfu restaurant in the hotel is delicious, a bit expensive, but much cheaper than a few years ago. The hotel is next to the duty free shop. I will stay here next time I come to Sanya. Like Like

msg:Choosing Kaaba Intercontinental is really a wise choice! The three days and two nights originally booked, the baby refused to come back after playing, and we stayed too comfortably for another night!
One night in advance, the butler "Yami Ji" contacted us and told me a lot about the hotel's activities, restaurant opening hours...etc. Very considerate service ‚ù§Ô∏è
Check-in is also very fast, and any staff member in the hotel is very nice! We first went to the Children's Paradise and saw that the wave pool was being disinfected. The details are perfect, because in the past it was mainly for walking children, and the hygienic conditions were very good!
We booked a premium sea view room, as soon as we entered the room, we felt like we were at home, with an invincible sea view. The bed is also prepared for me with an L-shaped fence, so that the baby will sleep more safely. Drinks in the refrigerator are replenished once a day.
The small trains in the hotel and all kinds of cars for babies are free. Other hotels charge every time, but at the InterContinental Tianfang, you can have fun without any worries!
The activities in the hotel are also super rich. We also fed the fish and turtles. The children had a great time!
The next thing is to praise the food and beverages in the hotel. We ordered meals in the room and it was delicious! Qingbuliang one daily üòÉBuffet breakfast, and the underwater restaurant pay attention to details, and they will continue to come to arrange the products. It will be comfortable to look at when people pick up the meal.
There is also a children's area at the buffet üòÅ
The next time I go to Sanya Haitang Bay, I will choose Tianfang Intercontinental again. These four days and three nights are very comfortable and happy! Housekeeper Yami Ji also solved many problems for me, thank you to all the staff in the hotel!

She responded very quickly every time, and she was very patient in helping us even on rest days. Special thanks to the western restaurant The manager Lesley sent us coconut refreshments every day, and we felt embarrassed to deliver them to us. Under her leadership, whether it was eating coconut chicken hot pot or having breakfast, her team was very warm and responsible. The point I want to say is There is no perfection in this world, but you see that everyone wants to strive to be perfect, which is worthy of respect. Thank you for your hard work.

Facing the sea, looking at the lush trees, the garden full of colorful flowers, and the clean and refreshing swimming pool, I feel very good. It is very close to the duty-free shop, 5 to 10 minutes walk. There is an underwater restaurant, which can be visited for free during non-meal time periods. There are usually people cleaning and maintaining it, and there are many types of marine life. There are plenty of parent-child activities, but we didn't participate in a few, and basically came at our own pace. It is very close to the beach, there are battery cars that can be delivered for free, and there are also free tools for playing with sand. Children's toiletries are adequately prepared, and children's toothpaste is not spicy, which is really full of details. There are plenty of drinks. Seeing that we drank a lot of water, we brought a bottle of mineral water. The service staff, sanitation staff, and restaurant staff are all adequate. Everything we think of, the hotel has thought of. It is an unforgettable vacation experience.

I called the Tianfang InterContinental in advance and contacted the hotel butler arranged by the front desk. Because I haven't been to Sanya for more than three years, I consulted a lot of things.
The little girl explained to me patiently and politely.
Because it happened to meet a child‚Äôs birthday, I arranged the room, sent a cake, and gave me a mermaid doll
It's not a little bit better than the Internet celebrity parent-child hotel next to it~
The next time I come to Sanya, I will still come to InterContinental

The arrival of the guards, the front desk, the guest room, and the personal assistant service are very considerate, especially a girl named Stella who speaks softly and is very efficient. It is a step away from the duty-free shop, and you can get a 5% discount. It is quite a deal. Next time I go I will continue to choose this hotel. I generally don't comment. This is the only hotel that I can evaluate with my heart.

They will contact you one day before check-out and help you book a bus to the airport. They are very attentive and considerate! There is a private beach in the hotel. The sand is fine and the waves are big. You can't swim, but it's very suitable for watching the sea and riding the waves! The hotel is seven or eight minutes walk from the beach, and you can also take the hotel's free train to the beach, which is very convenient! There are quite a lot of facilities for children, all of which are free (except the claw machine). You can get bath towels at the beach and swimming pool, and you can take them back to the room. It is very user-friendly! The breakfast is rich and delicious, and the underwater restaurant is also very special. Dining in the tunnel is not as good as the window in the lobby, which is more beautiful! The price of coconut chicken hot pot in Tianjin Bay restaurant is moderate, and the taste is good. The price of Chinese restaurant is slightly higher, so it is not recommended! Stayed for five days, the overall feeling is very good, satisfied!

I must thank the housekeeper, Xiao Yang Marnie, for giving our parent-child trip a very good start. I learned that we are bringing a baby After we went together, we were upgraded to an open-plan parent-child suite. My God, the whole person was high after the baby entered. Every corner has been played over and over again.
The hotel has a lot of activities for children, such as small trains, electric cars, bicycles, and children-themed activities from morning to night, as well as bubble shows. From the lobby to the beach, because her father and I are lazy, we directly asked the hotel to drive a tour bus to take it there. It is good that the hotel has its own beach, with few people and fine sand, but the waves are a little too big to go into the sea. It is very convenient to come out of the beach and have a place to wash your feet.
Breakfast ends at 11:00, but my baby procrastinates, and I go there almost every day after 10:30. There are many dishes, and both children and adults can eat pretty good. There is also the underwater restaurant at night, and I was lucky enough to book the location of the tunnel. All the children in the restaurant are very happy.
It is a very good hotel overall, very suitable for babies under 3 years old

Check-in was a bit slow, and there were complimentary drinks in the lobby, which you can drink while waiting. The housekeeper, Shirley Xiaoxuan, is very caring and can solve any problems in a timely manner. The drinks and snacks in the minibar are replenished every day. The little brother who cleaned the place was very kind and gave us a lot of water. Because the bed and pillows were a bit soft, the housekeeper was able to help me deal with them in time. The bed was turned over hard, and the pillows were replaced with buckwheat husks for the child, and a gift was given when I checked out. Because it is the peak holiday season, I didn't upgrade to a room type. I was given an executive lounge for one day and a cocktail in the evening. This time I stayed at the Intercontinental very comfortably.

In fact, the five-star and above hotels at home and abroad are very good. This time I stayed at the Sanya Tianfang InterContinental and felt the most impressive and the most comfortable stay.
Facilities: Because it is a seaside city, no matter how high-end the hotel is, it seems that it is easy to be dirty and messy due to the influence of moisture. The entire InterContinental hotel facilities are well maintained, so there are basically no old things.

Hygiene: In terms of hygiene, we really pay attention to every corner and detail, especially the towels and bath towels, which are really white and soft, and smell good. I used to use my own towels every time I travel, but this time I used hotel towels with confidence. The daily cleaning is never perfunctory. I went into the room and touched the cabinets, and they were all clean. And although the room was disinfected, it didn't have any peculiar smell. The bed sheet quilt cover can directly wear underwear to sleep without pricking the skin.

Environment: The location of the hotel is very convenient for parking, traveling, eating, and visiting duty-free shops. During the few days of our stay, we basically solved all travel needs near the hotel. The hotel lobby is relatively transparent, and the elevator is fast, so you don't have to wait for a long time. The dining room is very comprehensive, including breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is rich and delicious. The beach belongs to the hotel, and outsiders can't get in, so it's very clean, and it's a blockbuster if you take a photo. The sound insulation of the room is excellent, so you can sleep peacefully every night.

Service: The services of five-star hotels are relatively professional, but I think InterContinental's services are more humane. When you check in, you will arrange one-on-one service from the butler, and clearly introduce the relevant content of the hotel's visits and meals. Respond quickly, enthusiastically and thoughtfully to customer needs.
Thanks to little brother Qi Yubo for his thoughtful service. In addition to saying good morning and good night every day, he also told me to spray the mosquito repellent provided by the hotel before going to bed at night, close the doors, windows, gauze curtains, and insert mosquito repellent. Even after get off work, I still need to communicate with me on WeChat, and explain it to other colleagues seriously. My daughter is more than two years old and is prone to allergies. She was bitten by a mosquito during this trip, and her forehead was swollen with two large bumps. It is estimated that the pain affected her sleep, and she was in a bad mood when she went out to play. Mr. Qi immediately sent me a special oin**ent for mosquito bites. After applying the oin**ent, the swelling subsided within a short while, and I was instantly revived with blood on the spot. I always care about the child's condition on WeChat, and told me that if the child is not feeling well, I must tell him as soon as possible, and he will arrange a hotel doctor to see the child. The young lady who is in charge of turning down the bed and cleaning the hotel rooms is also very good. Every time, she will replenish various supplies for us with a smile. Going out with no relatives, I am most afraid of encountering all kinds of emergencies. There is a caring hotel like InterContinental, and the hotel has a warm, caring, patient and handsome little brother like Qi Yubo. My heart is really at ease. I am grateful to have you! Thank you!

msg:My first birthday trip after the epidemic ended. I mainly wanted to go shopping at the duty-free shop, so I chose the nearest Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel. It was really convenient for shopping. I walked to the duty-free shop within ten minutes, and I would never be troubled by traffic jams. I can go back to sleep and go out to continue shopping. At first, I read the reviews and thought that the hotel is a bit old and the decoration will be old. I didn‚Äôt expect the hotel to be well maintained. There is not much difference between the various equipment and the newly opened one. I stayed in Asia the next day. Atlantis, comparing the two, it is obvious that InterContinental wins in terms of various laundry detergents, outlets, hair dryers, and other small details. Here, I must mention the butler Shirley, who prepared a birthday surprise for me and thoughtfully helped me apply for two Click to check out, and wechat will reply quickly if you have any questions. During this trip, I found that the service industry in Sanya is very good. All kinds of questions in the hotel are answered in a clear way, and I feel at home. Every birthday month in the future Will come to stay againüëç

msg:I am really satisfied with the Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel this time. The hotel is focusing on the "Continental" service, and I feel that it has done it. I used to prefer to go to the niche villa hotels in Perfume Bay. The service experience was not good. This time, after repeated comparisons, I chose the one next to the duty-free shop. The main reason is that the flight is relatively late and it is convenient to pass the time. I didn't expect a few surprises for me: First, the waiters will receive you with trot service, which is a scene that can only be seen in Japanese hotels. The supply of room service materials is particularly a**ospheric, and guests will not be asked to repeatedly call for water for a few bottles of water, such as water such as towels, such as tea bags and coffee. If the room staff finds that you drink a lot of tea, they will take the initiative to add mineral water water. The best thing is the dishes in the Chinese restaurant, the price is reasonable, and the main reason is that they are very delicious. We have experienced breakfast in the executive lounge and the lobby on the first floor, and it feels good. In particular, there are reminder signs on the table, which is very good, let the guests know which table is occupied and which table is empty, no need to fight for seats, and the place where the restaurant picks up cooked food does not need to be crowded and fight, and the portion is also up to you More scientific use. In Sanya in March, the weather is sometimes cold. The hotel has a heated swimming pool. The towels and mineral water by the pool are very convenient, and the children are very satisfied with the parent-child activities. The butler service arranged by the front desk has almost always helped us deal with problems in a decent and proactive manner. I especially commend the housekeeper Zhao Zibo and a little girl waiter from Guizhou in the room depar**ent. There is a special cabinet for takeaway at the entrance of the lobby, which feels more hygienic. Please remind me that there are two buses at the airport, you need to contact the front desk of the hotel, but there is basically no waiting when you leave on time. Please pay attention to this problem when you book your flight. It takes about 50 minutes to arrive at the hotel without traffic jams, and more than an hour in traffic jams. We will still choose this hotel next time.

msg:After the policy is opened, I can't wait to take my children out for travel. After three years, I can finally travel far! I stayed at the hotel in Yalong Bay for the past two days. This time, I wanted to change to Haitang Bay. I chose the hotel for a long time. After reading countless reviews, my eyes were dazzled. I finally chose the Intercontinental Hotel. I wanted to give it a try. attitude, I am worried that the imagination in the bad review will appear! The result is not at all. From the time of check-in, the hotel is very close to the first phase of the duty-free shop. Turn left when you go out. It should be the closest hotel to the duty-free shop in Haitang Bay. This way, you can take time for a walk at night, and it will not take up the time to play during the day. time. The hotel has a large lawn, and you can also take a boat to feed the big turtles in the hotel, or you can experience diving and feel the turtles around.
Stella who checked us in was very considerate and kind. She called the day before the trip to confirm the room type and arranged a central room in the hotel. The check-in was very fast. Seeing that we brought children, we also gave travel photography services as a gift. With the addition of WeChat, any questions during the journey will be actively answered and dealt with. I gave the children a mermaid bag, a free drink coupon in the lobby bar, and a fruit meal on the last day. The bellman is also good, very proactive, the restaurant waiter is also very good, clearing up the dishes is very diligent, and the staff will take the initiative to say hello when they see the guests! Children's activities are also very rich every day (except for snorkeling fees, etc.), which is very suitable for children aged 4-8. Children do not want to leave when they come. All in all, I think our family is very satisfied with the choice of InterContinental this time!

You can feed the sea turtles and fish by boat. The swimming pool is very clean. Various types of swimming rings for children are provided free of charge. The beach is fine and sand-digging tools are provided for children. Parents do not need to prepare in advance, which is very convenient , but Haitang Bay is too windy and the beach is sp****ly populated. The children's amusement park is suitable for babies aged 1-6. There are also a lot of children's activities, and children like it very much. Crossing the flyover from the hotel is a variety of restaurants in the second phase of the duty-free shop. The location is excellent. Our room is facing the construction site of the duty-free shop, but the noise is not too loud, it does not affect the rest, and the door is very soundproof.

You can register information at the front desk in advance, store your luggage, and you will be notified by phone when the room is cleaned. The luggage will be delivered directly to the room. Bed surrounds and baby toiletries can be provided. Because of the random room type booked, the two single beds are put together when there is no big bed, which is also very spacious.

I stayed on the 15th floor and did not see mosquitoes during the stay. The hotel has a lot of parent-child activities every day. If you report your room number, you can take a small train to and from the beach. Children are provided with sand digging tools and swimming equipment for free, as well as multi-person bicycles and electric toy cars. The children's playground is a little simple. The hotel is about 5 minutes' walk from the duty-free shop. There are many dining options in the second phase of duty-free, and it is very convenient to order takeaway. The housekeeper Raian was very considerate during the stay. The day before check-out, he would actively ask if we need to take the hotel airport bus, and applied for a later check-out for us. The service is very good. The next time I come to Sanya, I will give priority to staying again!

But now it is the high incidence of jl and nr, we are still relatively cautious, and try to avoid some hotels that are more popular with families in the choice of hotels. It just so happens that Tianfang InterContinental is also the closest hotel to the duty-free shop, and it takes only five to ten minutes to walk. It is perfect for ladies who love shopping. On the day of check-in, there were pieces of snacks in the small carpet in the room that were not cleaned up, but I didn't mind too much. I didn't expect that the housekeeper Raina specially arranged cakes and small gifts to express my apology! It immediately captured our heart to choose to live here next time! Raina's service is worthy of praise! In addition, I would like to praise the hotel's buffet breakfast, which is rich and fresh! Even at 10:30 in the morning, you will see some areas being replenished! The "buffet breakfast" with freshly squeezed vegetable juices is a plus in my heart! The baby area in the restaurant is also very cute! I also encouraged my mother to go to the baby area to get me cookies and marshmallows hahaha ü§≠The hotel‚Äôs minibar is also replenished every day, but we didn‚Äôt think of drinking it on the first day, and then we remembered...

msg:On the last day in Sanya, because I needed to go to the duty-free shop, I chose Tianfang Intercontinental. The parent-child activities and children's paradise inside are very good. The hotel can take the small train for free, and the children's paradise is also very rich in activities. I feel that the sanitation of the paradise is average, and the rooms are indeed relatively old. If you have requirements for room facilities, you need to be careful when choosing. I really think that the main reason for hygiene may be that the room is really too old. I was given a room on the fifth floor and the manager Lucy was really bad. After coordinating with the housekeeper Ji Xinxin, Wang and the housekeeper quickly helped me solve the problem, but if the first consideration is the duty-free shop and the parent-child needs of children, this must be no problem. I want to praise the service of the hotel staff is really good, no matter which one Depar**ent, the undersea restaurant recommended by a child is great, and the food is pretty good, not as bad as it says online, which is quite unexpected. Generally speaking, choose according to your own needs, because the price we temporarily ordered is very high So that kind of room is really unacceptable at the moment. Fortunately, there is coordination between the housekeeper and the manager, otherwise it will be very unpleasant

msg:One of the best hotels in Sanya for babysitters, Haitang Bay InterContinental must be ranked first.
Going here suddenly has a feeling of returning to my hometown. I remember that I came to Sanya a few years ago to test my diving certificate. Learning diving in the Haitang Bay Intercontinental Aquarium was one of the one-day courses. It was a great experience.
It's really a fate to meet thousands of miles away.
The hotel check-in is in charge of a full-time staff, Marine, who will inform the hotel of children's activities at different times of the day and help you make an appoin**ent.
Because of bringing children, Marine took the initiative to upgrade our room type to a 118-square-meter suite. This kind of good trea**ent is something I have never encountered in many InterContinental hotels in Sichuan.

The upgrade of the suite, the spacious room is more suitable for children's activities, and there are all kinds of toiletry sets suitable for children.
Stayed for two nights, took the children to catch up with the announcement every day, made cartoon soap, painted oiled paper umbrellas, mini hamburgers, etc., very busy.
The swimming pool provides towels and water for guests, and there is a bubble playground in the afternoon. You can experience and learn water canoeing at 6 pm on Fridays. This is not only a good place for adults to relax, but also a good place for children to consume their energy.
There is a duty-free shop next door to the InterContinental, so it is very convenient to go shopping. The second phase of the duty-free shop across the street has a wide selection of food courts.
The only regret this time is that the children are under 6 years old and cannot experience the snorkeling and mermaids in the aquarium. Save it for next time

First of all, although the two hotels have butler service, the Yamiji of the InterContinental is quite warm and thoughtful. From us From the welcome at check-in to the check-out at the end of the stay, they are full of enthusiasm and warmth. I give her a super 5 points for her caring service! InterContinental has bigger and richer event venues, next to CDFG.

The bedding is so comfortable! It is usually difficult to fall asleep, but this time I went to sleep within ten minutes after lying on the bed.
The upgraded room type has two sinks, which is just needed for girlfriends traveling!
The food ordered in the room is also delicious.
Come in February, the heated swimming pool is very comfortable, and it is not too cold to swim at night. And there is a shade of trees next to the swimming pool, you can swim in the shade in the morning without getting out of the sun! What's even more surprising is that the hotel took the initiative to clean the room twice, once in the morning, and all the towels and bathrobes were wet after swimming at noon. When I came back at night, I found new towels and bath towels!
In addition, the hotel's lawn and beach are also good, and it is only a 10-minute walk from the duty-free shop.

Especially the service of the housekeeper Shirley, is very good, responsive to every question, thank you for your company during the stay.

msg:I brought my baby to Sanya before New Year's Day last year and chose Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel. The hotel's private beach, huge lawn, heated swimming pool, hotel restaurant and special underwater restaurant all left a perfect impression. What needs to be emphasized is that Alice in the breakfast room is attentive and dedicated conscientious. The first stop of this year‚Äôs winter vacation brought the baby to the Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel in Haitang Bay as soon as possible. The whole journey was very smooth and even perfect. First of all, the cancellation of the flight after 9:00 pm was protected until the golden time of departure at 10:30 in the morning. Upon arriving at the hotel, I met Lucy Wang, the room manager with the same name and surname. After communication, we upgraded the deluxe sea view double bed room to a deluxe sea view twin bed room, and the floor and room number are also super satisfied. 1018 is so auspicious, haha! You can see the beautiful sunrise and sunset on the balcony every day, and your happiness index has increased by 100 times Thanks to the good service experience of the two ladies, I lived in the Intercontinental for two weeks this year. The key point is that the baby likes the afternoon tea every day. Ms. Alice will bring freshly squeezed orange juice at breakfast every day, and then ask the baby What kind of bread or fruit do you want to eat today? In the afternoon, service staff will be arranged to deliver it to the room on time or to the constant temperature swimming pool that the baby likes. The little friends are also very happy to play every day. The constant temperature swimming pool of the favorite hotel is played at least three times a day. Hours, tanned at any time but very happy haha, there is also a coconut tree climbing project in the children's playground, every time I am very active in queuing up to get the number, there are many activities, and the staff in the park area are very enthusiastic and caring . The hotel is decorated in a Southeast Asian style. The outside is unassuming, but the internal management is orderly. The experience has been very good for two consecutive years. I will come back with my baby in the next holiday! 1018 goodbye! Goodbye Miss Alice and Lucy Wang üòòüòé

I was told to wait for more than an hour before I had a room and then call me. I couldn't help but call me at 4:30 Called to urge me, and after two phone calls, I was finally asked to get the room card at 4:50 p.m. I don‚Äôt know any five-star hotel in the world that can only check into the room at 4:50 p.m., wasting an afternoon in vain Time, disrupted all schedules, can't play anything, the whole family is foolishly waiting for them to call, this is simply time kidnapping. What's the difference between this and buying seafood without a catty or two? I really want to call the 12350 consumer rights hotline to complain. Finally ÔøºAfter entering the room, the child wanted to play the project and said that he had to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. He didn't even enter the house and asked people to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. What's the reason for that? The whole hotel is old and dilapidated. All kinds of facilities and so-called amusement facilities are like public places in the countryside of sixth-tier cities. Ranked first, it's too Ôøºstepping on the pit, and it ruins all moods.

msg:I have stayed at Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel for n times. What attracts my family is the hotel's excellent service that can be called the industry benchmark, the first-line sea view, the hardware facilities of a super five-star hotel, and my family's favorite Tianfu Chinese restaurant.
Every dish in Tianfu Chinese Restaurant is very good. I heard that Mr. Chen, the chef, is also a calligrapher, and many dishes have his calligraphy works. The particularly amazing dishes are the black garlic soup, which tastes more delicious than the local soup in Guangdong. The cherry foie gras is delicious, and the sizzling beef and French fries have become the children's favorite. Hainan's special dish, Wenchang chicken, is tender and tender. The dipping sauce is perfect. The Sichuan cuisine that I personally like to eat is also a must here. The boiled fish and spicy chicken are fragrant but not spicy, and the ingredients are specially selected. It can be seen that the chef has carefully selected the ingredients. Speaking of Tianfu Chinese food, I have to mention the management team of the restaurant. The manager Hedy has a deep memory of our old customers and can remember our favorite dishes. He helps us book a table every day, recommends various exquisite dishes, and chats with our family. Sanya features, and will politely send our family back to the room, this is the feeling of being at home!

msg:From the beginning of the epidemic, I feel that I will come to Sanya every year to satisfy my children's yearning for the sea
Although I can go abroad this year
But I chose a familiar place with my children alone
InterContinental is the hotel that my mother has always recommended to me. My friend stayed here last year and the child remembered it. This year he asked me to take him to this hotel.
So decisively choose to stay for 4 nights

Environment: InterContinental is the first batch of hotels in Haitang Bay
Although the year is longer
But the environment is still beautiful, especially the big lawn, which is a special film
It is more convenient to go everywhere, especially shopping in duty-free shops


Service: The hotel called me to confirm the needs two days before check-in
Shirley, the exclusive butler, also added WeChat in time
Arranged check-in for us as soon as we arrived at the hotel
And arranged a birthday cake and decoration for the child
The service staff who clean the room are also very nice
I had a great chat with my son and made him a bunny and cards
The child also drew a picture for the aunt as a gift

It is worth mentioning that
The hotel's activities are really rich
The child is full from morning to night
It‚Äôs just that there is no hosting, it‚Äôs more expensive
 The cars at the entrance of the children's area are also free
Game consoles need to buy game currency
The breakfast in the restaurant is very rich

The only downside may be that the beach is a bit far away

Make a suggestion:
The self-service barbecue by the beach needs to be improved, there are few dishes and the replenishment is not timely.

Overall, the past few days at InterContinental are really full of happiness!

After actually checking in, I found that it was better than expected. The hotel check-in was very fast. I originally booked a premium sea view room, but the hotel upgraded us to a sea view suite. Thank you very much. Compared with the beautiful sea view of InterContinental Hotel in Banshan Peninsula, Tianfang InterContinental Hotel is a bit more open. When you open the balcony window, you can smell the unique fragrance of InterContinental Hotel mixed with the aroma of sea water, which is refreshing! The hotel's beach is also well maintained, the sea water is very clean, and the sand is not as rough as the online reviews. I have stayed in many hotels in Hainan, and it may be a little thicker than Wanning's, but it is not bad. My daughter had a great time playing. The hotel's parent-child programs are very rich, and the service is very thoughtful, which makes people feel at home. The housekeeper Shirley is kind and enthusiastic, and responsive. I have been to Hainan Island for vacation many times, and I have stayed in many hotels. In terms of overall quality, Tianfang InterContinental is definitely ranked high. I will still give priority to InterContinental when I come to vacation next time.

The buffet in the aquarium is a bit expensive, and the children are already very satisfied going to the ba*****t every day! Haitang Bay is a bit far from the scenic spots, but if it‚Äôs just a pure vacation, the price/performance ratio is still very high. The narration is the duty-free shop. You can go to the second phase of the duty-free shop for meals, which is very convenient! The bed in the lake view room is facing the sea, the sunrise is so beautiful! It's the fishing season now, and while walking on the beach, I even met fishermen collecting their nets. It's a very special experience, and it's really much more interesting than visiting tourist attractions! The attitude of the hotel staff is also very good, a hotel that will stay again!

It's really a hotel that I can continue to stay in next time, and I'm still looking forward to staying in a hotel. In short, I'm very satisfied. I'm also very satisfied with Raina, my housekeeper.

My favorite place is the hotel's beach, the sand is very fine, the sea breeze is blowing, and walking by the sea makes me feel very happy. If it is sunny, it is recommended to get up early, the sky is full of stars, and watch the sunrise around 7:10, you must experience it.

There was an unpleasant episode when we picked up the airport. The hotel reimbursed the taxi fare in time, and 2 room upgrades, 15% discount on food and beverages. The hotel is not the newest, but it is very comfortable, very clean, the staff service is also very nice, and the toiletries are also my favorite brand, I feel very good. It is next to the duty-free shop, but we were able to avoid the crowds. Thanks to the hard work of the staff, we had a pleasant 5 days, and we will choose InterContinental next time.

There is no butler service... Khan... I didn't expect much from the Kaaba at the beginning. When I went to the duty-free shop, I parked the car outside because it was really close to the duty-free city. I didn't expect to have a butler service when I checked in. The housekeeper, Xiao Zhao Enthusiastic and responsible, and respond promptly to any questions, because the elderly at home came with us, we took the children out for dinner, but the old man‚Äôs mobile phone ran out of power, so we asked the housekeeper to go to the old man‚Äôs room to check... They all helped us solve it very well Question... Give Xiao Zhao a thumbs up! ! The service and food and beverages have withstood the pressure during the peak season, and the overall Kaaba is very good! Very pleasantly surprised!

msg:During the Chinese New Year, it is difficult to book a hotel, and it is even more difficult to see the sea. This Chinese New Year, I want to lie down in Sanya for a few days and look at the sea. After staying in Sanya Bay for a few days, I wanted to change to Haitang Bay. I chose the InterContinental Hotel with a premium sea view. I specially ordered a premium sea view because I think it is more expensive than other sea view rooms and the location is better. When I checked in, I went early and told my sister at the front desk to choose a place with a better location, because I just wanted to lie in the hotel. I didn't expect my sister to agree, but I gave a connecting room on the far side, and I happened to meet a family next door. Ziren, the card game didn't end until after 11 o'clock, and there were 3-4 children who were really noisy. I called the front desk to ask for a room change, and the front desk said there was no room available. Later, Ms. Wang, the manager on duty of the hotel, calmed down after communicating with her. Ms. Wang did a lot of post-compensation work, which made me feel very professional. Until now, I still don't understand what the sister at the front desk who checked me in is thinking. You can tell me no, but you can't lie to me! If it weren't for the compensation made by the hotel manager later, I can only give the service one point. Talk about this hotel, I will definitely not stay again next time. The biggest advantage of the hotel is that the room is super large, but the bed is not big, and there is a lot of wasted area. The hotel is next to the duty-free shop, very close to the shopping, but it is not so critical for the small shopping demand, it is a bit noisy and there is a traffic jam, because it is next to the duty-free shop, it is difficult to eat with many people, and there is no food in the restaurant in the afternoon. Children in the park rarely play, and the beach should not belong to the hotel itself. The breakfast is really too average!

msg:Facilities: Parent-child activities are more abundant, but not suitable for children under three years old, üëãolder children participate;

Hygiene: Hygiene seems to be okay, but there is a peculiar smell near the toilet in the room;
In addition, it is not recommended for younger children to go to the hotel's heated swimming pool. The child is two and a half years old. After swimming in the heated swimming pool, he suddenly developed hives that night. The same situation did not occur in other indoor swimming pools before. I don't know if it is caused by the disinfectant water in the swimming pool.

Environment: Since it is the peak season before the Spring Festival, the occupancy rate is very high. The children's playground, restaurants, and swimming pools are all overcrowded. The experience is relatively not very good. It should be better in the off-season.

Service: The service is the most dissatisfied.
On the second day of check-in, the child turned on the do-not-disturb light when he took a nap in the afternoon, but the room service kept knocking on the door to wake up the child. After opening the door and telling the room staff to come back to turn down the bed and clean up at 6 pm, he returned to the room at 9 pm that night It was found that it was not cleaned, and the welcome fruit was not delivered;
I called the housekeeping depar**ent and they didn‚Äôt know much about it. A staff member came and didn‚Äôt know anything. I asked the hotel to contact the hotel directly and found that the cleaning of the hotel rooms should be outsourced rather than the hotel‚Äôs direct responsibility. After all, it belongs to a high-end hotel. This is the most basic sanitation service. However, the outsourcing system is adopted, which makes people very dissatisfied and worried about whether the hygiene standards are up to standard;
The welcome fruit marked by Ctrip when booking the hotel is a daily one, but after asking the hotel, I was told that it was only available on the day of check-in, which did not match the promotion.
After complaining about the interruption of the children's nap and the lack of daily fruit, the manager followed up, but the answer was that the room staff did not see the do not disturb light due to the strong sunlight at the time... This reason is not very acceptable to me, and finally I sent a cheesecake, a scented candle and a woven bag for the end. To be honest, the solution provided by the hotel for three or four thousand a night is not acceptable. I can only feel that the staff wants to finish the guest's complaint as soon as possible. Work.
Generally speaking, the experience is very average. As a high-end parent-child hotel, there are no reassuring sanitary conditions, and no complete supporting services. I hope that guests who plan to stay will consider it carefully.

The hotel lobby is very resort style, the log structure is my favorite style, and the ventilation is so good. Check-in can be done sitting down. The welcome drink tastes average, but they also prepared and provided it.
When I asked about the hotel's children's activity arrangements when I checked in, the young lady kindly provided the butler's WeChat account. The housekeepers Xiaohe and Xiaowu are very caring. Seat reservations, arrangements for children's activities, and suggestions for Sanya tours are all available.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel rooms. The balconies are all facing the sea. Maybe the rooms on 16.17.18 are the most frontal. If you have ample schedule, you can lie on the bed, open the balcony door, listen to the waves, and use your mobile phone.

Thank you again to the hotel's little sister Li Danyang! highly recommended!

When I come to Sanya again in the future, I will live in the InterContinental. Hotels with the same price and grade, I like InterContinental! There is a shortcoming. There are many people during the Spring Festival. The hotel starts to manage the swimming pool to maintain the water quality. For those who wear slippers to step on the pool and eat near the pool, they start to manage. This is very good, the water quality is good, and everyone has a good time playing. However, management methods and attitudes need to be improved. Come on, Intercontinental, look after you

After reading Ctrip's comments on InterContinental, there are many repeat customers. This attracted me to finally make a decision and stay for two days. Days later, I guess I will also become a repeat customer. When checking in, the housekeeper will first add WeChat to introduce the hotel facilities and children's programs. The programs are still very rich, and the schedule is relatively reasonable.
facility:. The toiletries in the room are byredo, which really poked me. It shows that the hotel is really continuing to follow up and upgrade. Children's products are also available. The room is not obviously outdated. It is very comfortable to live in. The room faces the sea and the second phase of the duty-free shop. Watch the sea during the day and watch the night view at night. The water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is very warm, and you can go into the water at any time in the weather of more than 20 degrees in January. The children's playground facilities are also very complete, and you can rent electric cars and bicycles for free.
Service: Our butler is Raina, who responds quickly to WeChat contact and answers all questions. Other hotel staff can also feel that although they are busy, they are in an orderly manner. What they want in the room can be delivered quickly. The children's playpen provided Also very clean. The only fly in the oin**ent is that we booked the hotel's free pick-up shuttle bus. The shuttle driver's attitude is poor and he doesn't help with luggage. However, the thoughtful service from the concierge after we arrived at the hotel immediately made us not mind this. Next time, we will take a taxi by ourselves. Enough. Not counting the shuttle bus, the hotel alone is really the best service hotel I have ever stayed in Sanya.

This time I want to change to Haitang Bay. I have chosen a hotel for a long time. After reading countless reviews, my eyes are dazzled. I finally chose the Intercontinental Hotel. I originally wanted to give it a try. , I am worried that the imagination in the bad review will appear! It turned out not at all. From the time of check-in, the staff at the front desk were very kind. They gave the children a mermaid bag, free drink coupons in the lobby bar, and the bellman was very proactive! The waiters in the restaurant are also very good, and they are very diligent in clearing the dishes. I brought a bowl of seafood soup with my left hand and a bowl of porridge with my right hand. The waiter saw that he took the initiative to help me get it to the table. He was afraid that I would not be able to lift it. , ha ha ha üòÑ! The little brother in the fruit section is also very good. Originally, there was no papaya in the buffet, so I tried to ask, can you cut a papaya for me? The chef brother immediately cut a papaya for me, removed the head and tail, and kept the best part, which is amazing Guests will take the initiative to say hello! All in all, I think our family is very satisfied with the choice of InterContinental this time! Also, our housekeepers put a little turtle made of shells in the room for the first time, and I thanked him the next day, the turtle is so cute! As a result, when I went back to the room at night, the children found that there were 2 more, hahaha üòÑThe small gesture is very heartwarming! Just a little turtle with a family of three üê¢!

No matter when the suitcase is checked in or checked out, when the waiter sees it, he will immediately step forward to help take it, which is very considerate. This time I stayed in a premium sea view room, located in the middle of the hotel, facing the sea, I felt very comfortable. Before I left, I saw the sun rising slowly by the sea, which was perfect. This trip, because of the intercontinental, healed full marks. Next time, I will still choose Intercontinental.

msg:The parent-child executive suite booked includes three meals a day, which is quite cost-effective. Tell me about the room, the area is 118, with a living room, the small bed is in the shape of a boat, and the size is quite large after sleeping, and I didn‚Äôt go for you even if I slept with an adult. The suite gave a set of Bai Ruide's toiletry set, which smells very good. The executive lounge is on the 17th floor, and you have to go through the corridor to enter. This design is a bit incomprehensible, after all, the wind on the top floor is too strong. The food in the lounge is pretty good, all delicious. Let‚Äôs go to b1 restaurant for breakfast. The variety is much richer, especially Hainan‚Äôs specialties Baoluo powder, seafood in dross cypress vinegar, seafood porridge, etc. are all delicious. I personally feel that the breakfast standard of Atlantis is higher than that of Atlantis. There is a saying that the hotel has been built for 14 years, the hardware is a bit old, and the floors of the suites are too low, which cannot be changed. Fortunately, the hotel rooms are well maintained, and the service is very good. The butler shirley is responsive and responds quickly. The little brother at the door is also very active in picking up and dropping off luggage, which is very impressive. It's very close to the duty-free shop. Generally speaking, it's a good choice to choose InterContinental when you come to Haitang Bay for vacation!

msg:Environment: The hotel environment and hardware facilities are very recommended. Sea view rooms are recommended for staying. The balcony bathtub design is very good. It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop and go out the gate 100 meters away.
Service: First of all, I checked into the hotel at night, and the check-in front desk was not very enthusiastic. The service staff were not able to check in. They asked me to go to the side to check in. The attitude was indifferent, and the license plate number was wrong when I drove. When I checked in, I was told to book in advance It takes half an hour to arrange the sea view room. After waiting for a while, the front desk manager arranged a light meal for waiting. If the rooms booked in advance are not ready in advance, is it necessary to make a reservation? The battery car in front of the door was also told that there was no electricity and it could not be delivered to the gate. In short, they had to wait, or they should go by themselves. Although the environment and facilities of the hotel are great, the check-in service this time definitely does not match the InterContinental brand.

msg:After letting go, I wanted to go to the beach with my family to feel the long-lost vacation a**osphere. After reading the reviews of several hotels on Ctrip, I chose Tianfang Intercontinental. It really lived up to expectations, and I can even say that I am very satisfied.
It‚Äôs winter, and the temperature in Sanya is a bit cooler. Although the waves here at Haitang Bay are too big to go into the sea, the quality of the beach is good. The hotel has a first-line sea view. From the hotel lawn to the end, there are fine sand and soft waves, blue sea and blue sky, which perfectly meets the family‚Äôs wishes. Looking forward to going to the beach for a walk every day. The beach has hotel lounge chairs and other facilities. In the afternoon, the sun is not shining, and you can stay on the shore for half a day with a book.
The hotel room is very large, the design is simple but very creative, the scenery seen from the balcony is really beautiful and indescribable, the invincible sea view is probably like this. The facilities in the room are sufficient to meet the needs, and the ventilation is very good. I especially like the design of the long table, which is very suitable for reading and writing or working with a computer. The hotel supports the service of ordering takeout, and there is a special takeout cabinet, which is easy to find. Of course, the design of the hotel's bathtub on the balcony is the only point that I don't understand, and it still feels a little awkward. As well as the lighting system of the hotel, the family complained about it and never really grasped its meaning, but since I personally don't care much about it, I won't talk about it.
The overall environment of the hotel is very good, with a seaside resort a**osphere without losing the sense of grandeur. It is especially worth the large lawn of the Amway Hotel. There is a really relaxing and soothing feeling during the walk. The villa area of the hotel has a beautiful garden design, which is spectacular and well-proportioned from a height. The swimming pool is at a constant temperature. Go swimming for a while when the weather is warm at noon, and then hold an iced young coconut and savor it slowly after landing. It is really the ultimate enjoyment.
The sanitation and service are commendable. The room is cleaned very cleanly. When you stop in the hotel occasionally, there will be service staff who will greet you warmly or ask if there is anything that can help. When arriving and leaving, they patiently helped us carry the luggage, and carefully noticed whether we needed to help store the luggage, including taking the initiative to help us save time when going through the check-out procedures, and promptly when we found that there were items suspected of being left behind in the room It can be said that it is very attentive to make inquiries on the phone.
Special thanks to Ms. Shirley, the hotel housekeeper, for being very patient. She often troubled her during the six days of staying in the hotel, but she has always answered and helped us very patiently and efficiently. Whether it was a warm introduction to the hotel's various restaurant facilities when we first arrived at the hotel, or later taking the initiative to inform us of the concert arrangements in the hotel lobby bar during the New Year's Eve, or the various help and care when we left the store, this trip has become more enjoyable. For the pleasure, I really thank her from the bottom of my heart.
There are many restaurants in the hotel. The coffee in the lobby bar is very good. Tianfu Chinese Restaurant is not as amazing as the breakfast. The breakfast variety is very rich and there are many choices. It is worth mentioning that one time when I had breakfast, I reflected the salad that my family liked to eat. It seems not every day, but the next day I was pleasantly surprised to find that this dish was available and the service staff asked if I needed help to pick up a portion. I felt that my every opinion was fully valued and I was very moved.
The hotel is very close to the Duty Free City, and sometimes I go to the second phase of the Duty Free City for dinner, and it is very convenient to go back and forth. The night wind is gusty, refreshing but not cold. You can see the night view of Duty Free City when you open the door of the hotel room and walk on the corridor. When you go back to the room and go to the balcony, you can see the swimming pool garden and the deep sea illuminated by the lights in the hotel. On New Year‚Äôs Day, you can see fireworks on both sides. Probably the most romantic New Year's Eve in the past few years.
There is a travel photography service in the hotel, but my family and I were a little socially afraid, so we didn't dare to try it. Every time I go to eat, I can pass by the children's club and the small train, but I'm too embarrassed to compete with the children for seats on the car, so I haven't tried it.
But all in all, this hotel experience is really satisfactory to me. If I have the opportunity to come to Haitang Bay in the future, I will probably still give priority to this hotel.

When checking in, Carter at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped us change to the 17th floor of the administrative building for breakfast, so as to avoid the crowded breakfast period. The hotel was full on the second day of check-in, and there was a small episode in the middle to clean up the room, but it is also understandable because many hotel staff have fallen down, so I am very grateful to the guy who comes to clean up the room every day, and he will respond to every request! In short, the service of InterContinental Hotel is quite good, our family had a very pleasant holiday

I have stayed in this hotel before and I have a good impression, but this time I am very disappointed. The duty-free shop next to the hotel I can see it in the room arranged for me by the construction. Opening the curtains will affect my mood. I asked to change the room, and the hotel staff actively helped me change it. It was late at night and I didn't hear the sound of decoration. The next day I could hear the sound of decoration outside. I was really angry. It was so noisy after spending money on vacation, and the smell of the room was like the kind that I haven't lived in for a long time. Same

From the lobby, it is very suitable for sitting and blowing the sea breeze

The housekeeper, Xiao Mao, is named Kexi, and his service is warm, professional and considerate. A home away from home and distinguished enjoyment.

msg:I decided to take my baby to Haitang Bay on the weekend, which is a wonderful memory. The overall service of the hotel is very good, whether it is reception at the door, check-in at the front desk or room service, the breakfast room (there is even a disposable bib for children, which is a surprise), the lounge, and the driver of the small train are warm and friendly. Parent-child activities are abundant and free, such as small trains and swimming rings that other hotels charge for. Anyway, the baby was having a good time. The housekeeper's sister, Xiao Mao, is very enthusiastic and considerate. Everything is arranged properly. The booking activities during the whole check-in process are very smooth. The mermaid doll and the key ring doll also like it very much. I lived in St. Regis and MGM at the beginning of the year, and last week at Westin Lingshui, this Haitang Bay Intercontinental and Yalong Bay St. Regis' snobbish service and Lingshui Westin's crotchless service are absolutely unsurpassable. Another key point is that it is very convenient for the hotel to do nucleic acid. The hotel has it, and the free mixed tube is also very close to walking.

msg:Sanya International Hotel is really great! First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the advantages. The tall, luxurious and spacious lobby, the warm and detail-oriented butler service, the convenient and fast walking distance of the duty-free city, and the spacious and comfortable guest rooms. We are very picky about Simmons and the thickness of the quilt. During the two nights staying at the Intercontinental Hotel, we felt comfortable with the combination of the air conditioner and the eiderdown quilt and the hardness of the Simmons. The rooms in Tlantis are much better. The best experience for me is the service. I have stayed in many super five-star hotels in Sanya. InterContinental Hotel is undoubtedly the most at home. Our housekeeper, Miss Zheng Xinyue, in addition to the meticulous and warm service. , also tried to solve our needs, and took the initiative to help me with the room type upgrade and subsequent room change requirements for free. After leaving the store, I forgot the data cable. Miss Zheng Xinyue found a way, and SF Express arrived at my station. I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel for the next two days, and the service couldn't keep up with the Intercontinental. The downside is that the entire garden environment is too poorly built, which is several orders of magnitude worse than Atlantis, and even far less than the garden landscape and the seaside leisure beach of the Renaissance Resort Hotel in Shanghai Tang Bay. Also, we like swimming, this time we stayed in Intercontinental for two days and didn't swim once. The swimming pool is too small and closed. The breakfast is generally rich and good, but worse than Atlantis. In general, the warm service, the comfort in the room, and the convenience of shopping in the duty-free city are the biggest highlights of InterContinental. Oh, and the beach barbecue and beer dinner provided by the hotel is great, and the free pick-up service of Mercedes-Benz S350 is very cordial. Next time you come to Sanya, Intercontinental is the first choice.

Location and transportation: The hotel is located at the end of Haitang Bay, and the navigation is very convenient. Next to it is the duty free shop.

Room facilities: The facilities are complete, and the hairdryer has also been updated to Dyson.
Breakfast: The variety is average, and it is withdrawn after eating a little.
wifi: stable.
Bed: moderately firm and soft, but later changed to a twin room.
Restaurant: The Underwater World restaurant is now more popular, and there are fewer "tortoiseshells" in it.

Although this hotel has been renovated for a long time, it is well maintained. In terms of service, it's just ceiling, the proportion of service staff is very high, and the response is really super fast! Once the door card is dropped, once the door card cannot be opened, the housekeeper Zhao Zibo can solve the current problem within 1-2 minutes. Simon the pool manager was great too! I heard that the family baby likes to play the power version, so I immediately added WeChat and helped us get it from another swimming pool before swimming. I was really moved and wanted to cry! The final drop off was also very good. I booked two hotels, both of which have pick-up and drop-off services. Kaaba Intercontinental called me very early to ask about pick-up or drop-off and flight status! ! It's easy to live here! ! For breakfast, Intercontinental has always been delicious. Kaaba Intercontinental is very a**ospheric. Breakfast can be packed, usually two or three breads for the baby. Comparing Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay, I personally think that it is suitable for older children, and children within the primary and secondary classes are still suitable for Yalong Bay Beach

The positive attitude of the service staff in the front hall and guest rooms makes people feel very comfortable. The breakfast quality and service are also worthy of recognition, which can meet the needs of bringing a baby. The only thing I want to complain about is the service of the indoor children's playground. 3-4 staff members can't see a smile and feel friendly to the children. Please help the first officer to get some game coins from the children's playground. The communication problem has not been resolved. , I was stunned by the staff impatiently: the chief mate is useless, we only listen to our manager. A position that needs love and patience the most should not have such rhetoric. How can such a manager who is the only one who respects me bring out such a staff? Service satisfaction points are deducted in this depar**ent. If there is no trip to the children's amusement park on the last day, this stay experience should be great.

msg:This time staying at the InterContinental was disappointing. First of all, I checked in at the lobby. The reception staff did not smile or greet me throughout the process. After registration, I gave the child a mermaid gift, and put it directly on the service desk without raising my head. I only said one word: " Give".

There was no welcome fruit when I entered the room. I called to ask and said I forgot it, and then made it up. The room is made of wood, which is very unfriendly to children, and there are sharp corners everywhere.

Children's facilities: There are many things to play in the Children's Paradise, and there are many small cars that can be driven at the door. The family swimming pool is relatively monotonous. The water temperature of the children's pool with slides is cold, and the water is full of dead leaves.

Cleanliness: Dirty looking sofa cushions, "masculine" pillows, hair on the sheets, blue carpet almost black.

The service was the most disappointing: When I checked in, I made a note that I needed a fence, a toilet for children, a footstool, and building blocks. After 5 hours of check-in, I was urged to deliver a footstool. The toilet was delivered only after calling the next day. At 9 o'clock in the evening, I asked the customer service for the building blocks. The child waited for a day, and 20 minutes later, a tent was delivered, saying that he had forgotten the building blocks and then picked them up. He waited another 20 minutes and then called to remind them to deliver them. Ask the customer service to send a hanger for bath towels and bathrobes, and after 2 reminders, they will send you bath towels and bathrobes, but the hangers say they forgot! (It took 1.5 hours to deliver these items)

There was no one to lead the breakfast buffet. I asked the 2 waiters where to sit? There was no response, and after I sat down, I asked the waiter to take a baby chair, and he left after listening.

Finally, I reported some situations to the housekeeper, and the hotel arranged a car transfer to the airport as compensation.

It's very powerful, and I changed the room to a better room and sent a meal coupon in the next two days. Just in time to encounter the epidemic, the housekeeper will also remind the nucleic acid, and it is also very timely to answer any questions.
The hotel's submarine restaurant is very good. I ate a lot of fried rice and sausages.
It is recommended to book a room with the executive lounge, where lunch and dinner can be solved, and the breakfast dining environment is also very good, so you don't have to crowd with the army.
Slightly far from the beach, but you can take a small train to it, very close to the duty-free shop

msg:I stayed here once a few years ago, and the impression was very good. After playing Wannings this time, before leaving Hainan, I decided to stay again. I booked a room for 5,000 a night for two nights. As a result, it made people very angry from the beginning of the check-in. After entering the door and inserting the card, there was no electricity, no electricity, not even the air conditioner. I contacted the housekeeper, and the reply was very slow, saying that the engineer would come to see it, and then we waited in the dark for a long time. , I didn't see anyone coming, so I went out to eat. When I went out, the room suddenly had electricity again. I thought it was okay to have electricity at last, but when I went out to eat and put in the card, there was no electricity again. This time I was told to let the master come to see it. All checked. At this point, I no longer dared to touch the room card at the door, for fear that there would be no electricity again. Because the hotel has been around for a long time after all, the outdated facilities were thought of before check-in, so it's okay. But the service was really poor. The housekeeper was slow and perfunctory in answering. After the first day of stay, there was a call back at the hotel to ask how the experience was. At that time, all the dissatisfactions were told again. The employee said that he was really sorry. You speak back. Then there is no more, that is to say, this return visit call is also used for perfunctory, the key is that the same employee called me after we stayed and left the hotel the next day to ask me how my experience was, which means that he didn‚Äôt even know we were Stayed for two days. Dealing with these problems is too stereotyped, it is a form, and it can't solve anything in practice. Such Intercontinental is so disappointing

First of all, the location is very good, and it is the closest to Sanya International Duty Free City, which is only a 5-minute walk away; secondly, the service is very good, and we will try our best to meet customer requirements; thirdly, the hotel has complete facilities and spacious and comfortable rooms to meet multiple needs. The room is large and spacious, with a desk, where children can do their homework. The room is equipped with a Dyson hair dryer to meet the needs of high-end people. The bathroom is also very large.

The children's playground, small trains, go-karts, and swimming pools are all available in the hotel, and children don't want to leave. The hotel also has a submarine restaurant, but you have to make a reservation one day in advance, otherwise there will be no space! There are also seaside restaurants, which are very romantic. This season is suitable for friends who are not too afraid of heat. I want to praise the Chinese restaurant, the service is warm, the dishes are exquisite, and the taste is very good! And there is also a group purchase package on Meituan, which is very cost-effective! The romantic beach has an internet celebrity check-in place (picture 1), which is very nice to take pictures! Next time we come, we will choose Kaaba Intercontinental!

msg:This Kaaba Intercontinental Hotel is really bad, whoever comes will regret it, let alone five stars and three stars. The old wooden furniture in the room looks like a homestay. If you call the front desk, you won't be able to get in touch if you don't call a few times. There are 2 people at the front desk and 1 person at the check-out. Slow to die. I have never seen such a dilapidated hotel open. We stayed in the classic sea view room, 2468 a night. The old one in the room was worth more than two hundred. The walls are still filthy.

I gave the room next to the fan, and said it was an upgraded room type. When I entered the room, it smelled musty and hygienic. Also very poor, with hair, the beds are made like this so what do guests think. Immediately asked to change the room and said that the same grade was gone. The most exaggerated thing was that the Fanta in the refrigerator was even drunk by others! ! I sent a bottle of red wine to compensate, sorry we really don't need it in the end and I don't want to take it away. I couldn't sleep at all in this musty room for two nights, what's the most important thing about travel? So depressing, brainwashed by various reviews on Xiaohongshu, I don't understand how this hotel can be compared with EDITION Yanlord? The only thing that is recognized in the whole process is that the pick-up driver drives really steadily. By the way, the food in the hotel is really unpalatable, and the food is really bad. Some varieties of breakfast will spit out when you eat them, such as the sticky rice noodles. There are also pickled powder, Baoluo powder! Usually only the worst hotels and the best hotels I will comment on, thank you very much!

Reservations make our activities in the hotel orderly and convenient. The hotel lobby also prepared children&#39;s supplies. Knowing that we were inconvenient to walk, we arranged the room in advance, which moved us very much. When we arrived at the hotel, it was like home. Haitang Bay Tianfang InterContinental has a beautiful environment. I came to this hotel before and experienced it myself. The hotel room and the two sides of the corridor are beautiful, overlooking Chiling, Wuzhizhou, and the duty-free shop and Haitang Bay Hotel Group.

msg:The hardware and facilities of the hotel are very good. Both the toiletries and the hair dryer are very good. The service of the housekeeper Xiaofan cici is very good. Our honeymoon tour not only upgraded the room type for us, but also sent us desserts, red wine and honeymoon layout. The only thing I am not satisfied with is the bad weather. You can still choose the InterContinental Hotel's preferred deluxe sea view room. The room size is very large. I stayed for two nights to shop at the duty-free shop. It is quite convenient to walk a few steps.

msg:This time, I booked a room facing the sea view for two nights. The sea view is really amazing. The room is also very big. The bath brand uses the classic Blanche fragrance of BYREDO. It can be said to be very, very tasteful. It's in place, unlike some hotels that are very well done on the outside. The details on the inside are very perfunctory. The hotel's children's playground is very large and there are many children's activities. Children like it very much. From breakfast to afternoon tea to dinner in the evening, everything was done very delicately and attentively. Very very satisfied. I decided to lock this hotel in Haitang Bay in the future. Both adults and children can have a good time. I have stayed in so many hotels in Haitang Bay. I think InterContinental really surprised me!
PS: Daisy, the lady who helped us check in this time, is so loving. The service is very good. The children like her very much.

The balcony is spacious enough to feel the blue sea and the beautiful green grass indoors. Small trains and battery cars are on call. The Executive Club basically includes all meals for one day except noon, and the grilled set at Haitian Yishi Restaurant is also good.

msg:This is the second hotel in this trip to Sanya. After changing from Yate, the first impression is that it is very clean and breathable. The sea breeze passes through the hotel lobby, which is very cool. One day in advance, the housekeeper Xiao Xu Arvin added me to WeChat to inquire about the situation. After arriving at the store, he helped me upgrade the room type and extra bed for free, and helped me make an advance reservation for the ocean restaurant, afternoon tea and seaside barbecue dinner. The butler Xiao Xu Arvin's service was very thoughtfulüëç. The hotel has a family swimming pool with a constant temperature of 28-29 ‚ÑÉ, which is open until ten o'clock in the evening. Our family likes it very much, and the body temperature is very comfortable. There is a large green lawn between the hotel and the beach, which is very beautiful for taking pictures. It is close to the first phase of the duty-free shop, and it is very convenient to walk for five minutes. My husband likes the decoration style of the Kaaba InterContinental Resort Hotel very much. It has a strong wooden feel and is full of Southeast Asian style. The wooden writing desk is very practical. In several hotels where I have stayed in Sanya, when ordering food is delivered to the room, the Kaaba is the best. The table top is long enough, the stools are sufficient, and the height is suitable. Next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will still choose Tianfang Intercontinental.

Service: There is a one-to-one butler service. The butler confirms the check-in time one day in advance, but it is difficult to get in touch. There may be too many guests and the service is average.
Room Facilities:
It is very convenient to have two toilet basins. The toilet is very user-friendly, and there is a partition on the side where you can place mobile phones or other things, which is very convenient.

msg:This is the first time I have stayed at the InterContinental Haitang Bay in Sanya. I booked a two-bedroom sea view suite. The view is normal. It may be due to the low floor. It is estimated that the upper floors of the same room type are better, but the rooms are full.
But it is worth recommending that the room types above the suite have butler service and executive lounge. These two places greatly improve the willingness to stay. My housekeeper this time is very careful and thoughtful, friendly and professional. I really want to praise it.
The executive lounge has more things than other hotels. You can have a leisurely coffee and breakfast every day here. You don't have to go downstairs to wait in line (too many people during the New Year)
Generally speaking, the sea of Haitang Bay in Sanya is not as beautiful as the beauty of Yalong Bay and the tranquility of Qingshui Bay, but the service of InterContinental will make me choose it again. They have the same service quality as a foreign resort hotel. I highly recommend staying ‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:1- Location: Go out and turn left, 5 minutes' walk to Duty Free Shop B, which is convenient for shopping (but there are pros and cons, and the road at the door is often congested accordingly)
2-Room: spacious and bright, in a relatively central position, basically facing the sea, the big bed is 2.4 meters visually, the balcony visually is 10+ square meters and equipped with recliners, which is very suitable for lying flat; although it is a hotel in 2013, it is maintained It is very good, and the decoration style is simple and Chinese, but it is not out of date; it is just that the design has many unreasonable points, such as the bathtub is on the semi-open balcony and is not connected to the shower room (with transparent glass in the middle), you have to go back to the room It takes a large circle to go to the shower room, which makes the bathtub more of a decoration; for example, the washroom and toilet are very large, but the other bedroom of the family room is small and can only fit a 1.5-meter bed, which shows that the designer designed that year In the layout of the room, how unconcerned and lazy to save trouble
3-Meals: B1 Tianjin Bay‚Äôs buffet breakfast is very rich, and there are even a variety of freshly made noodles in the north, as well as special children‚Äôs plates, children‚Äôs food and children‚Äôs meal picking locations, as well as children‚Äôs movie viewing activities and outdoor locations Next to the hotel‚Äôs ocean restaurant pool, it‚Äôs very comfortable to bask in the sun in the morning; the executive lounge is on the top 17th floor. Afternoon tea and happy hours in the evening are richer than atlantis, but the 17th floor is semi-outdoor except for the lounge area. Yes, the wind is a bit scary...
4-Kids Club: The facilities seem to be old, but it doesn‚Äôt prevent children from reluctant to go back to the room every day. There are also free train rides and outdoor trampolines in the garden, but overall it may be more suitable for preschool children
5-Beach: It seems to be a public beach in nature, not part of a hotel, the sand is very soft and fine, and there are basically no people, because the wind and waves in Haitang Bay are really scary
6-Other public areas: If I use one word to describe the Haitang Bay Intercontinental, it is "big", everywhere is empty and empty, the hotel lobby looks like a 5-story building, and the lawn is about to catch up with the football field. ... the greenery is very pleasing to the eye; the heated swimming pool is not visited, but every afternoon you can see children swimming, it must be not cold; in addition, although it is a parent-child hotel, it is not noisy, and people do not look like it. Many, probably mainly because there are not many rooms and the occupancy rate is not that big
Summary: Quiet, pleasant interior scenery, adults can be in a daze, children can also find their own fun, it is not easy to pick out faulty hotels.

msg:Since the summer vacation in July 2020 and the winter vacation of 2022, this is the sixth time I have come to Hainan. For 3-4 hotels for 8 nights each time, only first-line big brands are selected. InterContinental Haitang Bay is one of the top hotels in our knowledge. Feels like home, service sense is very good. The hotel is very well designed. Special thanks to the housekeeper Marine, who helped us make arrangements very well, I would like to thank you very much! We may continue to stay in this hotel on July 25th this year!

The location is first-class, just next to the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, and it can be reached in about ten minutes on foot. The hotel environment is first-class, from the lobby to the garden, the most favorite is definitely the room we live in. Next is the service of the hotel, which makes our guests feel at home, especially the private butler cici arranged for us by the hotel this time. We didn't arrive at the hotel and asked me about my accommodation needs in advance, and he was also careful and proactive. We care about our needs in the hotel, and the cleaning is also careful and meticulous, so that it is cleaned in the morning and evening. This stay is definitely a super satisfied one, and I will repurchase next time I have the opportunity.

Let's just say a few examples: The staff sent an older man to take the initiative to control the elevator for us. The other waiters avoided us as much as possible, let alone offered service. The hardware conditions are also unsatisfactory. The room is useless except that the area is large enough. The water leaking under the shower head is larger than the water at the head, and it overflows after a while. There are too many deficiencies, and it is useless to say more and offend people

msg:First of all, this is an enlightenment hotel that makes me a hotel lover. The Majestic and Mandarin Oriental that I have stayed in earlier due to brand activities are not even counted. Because of it, I began to take the initiative to understand the cultural history of major hotels, as well as the spaces behind each hotel, the architects and even the chefs of the restaurants. Therefore, it is worthy of me to write an article for it to share.

I went to Sanya for the first time a few years ago, and I lived on the Intercontinental Haitang Bay. At that time, I took a taxi to the hotel and got off the bus. The transparent lobby on both sides directly sent the hot sea breeze to my face. All of a sudden, I was rescued from the dizziness of three hours by plane plus more than half an hour by car. Sober instantly. "Ah, I'm back to my favorite tropics again!" I was naturally excited. Overall, the experience was very stunning. The room was spacious and spacious. The balcony was equipped with a bathtub. The toilet and bathroom were separated from wet and dry. The bed was facing the French window, and you could see the sea not far in front of you when you lay on the bed. Breakfast was in the undersea restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. Turtles and various marine fish were swimming around outside the glass. It was indeed a good experience to watch the fish swimming overhead while having breakfast. It was a pity that it coincided with the summer vacation and there were many children, which affected the overall dining experience.

Until this year, I came to Haitang Bay InterContinental again, and the experience it gave me gave me a new understanding of InterContinental, which is of course a good side. Arrived in Sanya on December 8. As Shanghai has an epidemic-related area, I was detained at the airport for nucleic acid after getting off the plane. I waited three hours for results before letting me leave. If you miss the shuttle bus arranged by the brand, you can only take a taxi to Westin on the first day. I was really tired and hungry after the morning flight plus the absence of lunch and waiting for the nucleic acid results for more than three hours. When I arrived at Westin, I did not smile at the front desk and did not help with luggage. When I arrived in the room, there was even no welcome fruit. . Sure enough, my bad impression of Westin has never been for no reason.

Perhaps because of the extremely poor experience at Westin, the next day I moved to the intercontinental which is 700 meters away in a straight line, and my liking for it was particularly magnified. First of all, the housekeeper Daisy Wang added my WeChat account the day before I checked in, asking about my estimated check-in time and other matters. Arrived at the hotel the next day, because it was an intercontinental gold card, so I was arranged to check in at the member counter. When I placed an order with Ctrip, Ctrip gave me the right to upgrade for free, and I asked the front desk staff whether to upgrade the room type. At this time, the housekeeper Daisy came and told me that because it was a gold card, I could upgrade to two consecutive levels for free. To the Premier Ocean View Room. When you arrive in the room, although the view is not as wide as the luxurious ocean view room that I lived in for the first time, the pseudo-set pattern makes people feel at home in physical sense. It is because the room type has been upgraded. The bathroom accessories in the room I live in this time are Byredo, which I like very much, and the smell is fresh and elegant. Dyson hair dryer, the balcony is also equipped with a bathtub, and the bathroom is square and large.

üçÉEnvironment: Enthusiasm, full of green plants. In the transparent lobby on both sides, the sea breeze is blowing, and it is quite pleasant to order a refreshing meal at the outdoor lobby bar at sunset in the afternoon. In front of the lobby is a central lawn, and walking across the lawn is the beach. There are children‚Äôs pools and family pools with complete facilities for children. Here I want to talk about the beach. Since it is Haitang Bay, there is a lot of wind and waves, so you can't swim in the sea. The fly in the oin**ent is that to walk from the lawn to the beach, you need to walk on the beach barefoot, which is not as good as Capella. Capella planted a flat lawn on the beach, dividing the beach into two halves, half of the lawn, and half of the sea. It is only a few meters away from the lawn to the beach. You can also walk on the lawn when you come back with wet feet. Comfortable experience.

Other facilities are very complete. The entire hotel is spacious and spacious, and there are also tropical villas, each in a staggered layout. There are many restaurants to choose from. Because it is low season, there is basically no need to make reservations for meals, and group purchase coupons can be used, which is very favorable. In terms of price and taste, the price/performance ratio is quite high.

üîîService: Needless to say, the service is of medium to upper level in general, very friendly and enthusiastic. Very good impression, especially the service of the butler Dasiy Wang is very good. The hotel also made a very detailed tax-free shopping guide, providing coupons and shuttle bus. Airport drop-off is also available, but you need to make an appoin**ent in advance.

üöó Transportation: It is only a few hundred meters away from the duty-free city. It is very convenient. There are many foods around and there are many options for ordering. The location is excellent.

Summary: This is a high-end resort hotel with high cost performance. The service is in place, eating, drinking and having fun can be solved in the hotel. A good hotel experience can be obtained at an average price of 145, so what are the reasons for rejection? Although there is still a gap compared to the next edition or Capella, Haitang Bay Intercontinental is a good choice for people with less time and budget. It is very family-friendly, and there are a lot of children's facilities and amusement items, but because of this, it is best for singles or couples to choose to come to this intercontinental in the off-season to avoid children's noise.

The deluxe sea-view room has a large area, and the balcony has a good view. It is very comfortable to watch the sunrise at 7 o'clock and sit on the balcony. The sea breeze is very comfortable. The scenery of the hotel is very good, there are footballs on the lawn, goals, and archery; the swimming pool must be mentioned, 10 to 10, all day constant temperature, hot bath towels, play and then soak in the hot water pool that can be massaged Bubble, don't be too happy. There are four restaurants. The breakfast is very rich, needless to say. It is open from 7 am to 11 am. The Chinese restaurant Lucheng Crab Fried Rice is so delicious, I went to eat it twice. The beach is very quiet and the waves are big. It has been walking along the beach. It is a primitive and undeveloped place. I saw a small pier where people played hot air balloons and yachts. Different from the noisy attractions, it meets many of your needs. Of course, the most convenient thing is that the Sanya International Duty Free City is next door. It is just right to go to 8pm. There are too many people during the day and there is a long line for paying money. Finally, and most importantly, our lovely little butler, Evelyn, was very dedicated and fulfilled many of our needs and spent a wonderful holiday with us. This is the seventh time I have come to Hainan, and I will come again when I meet.

I booked a luxurious suite, which can be used for afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge until 11 o‚Äôclock. All aspects of service are in place. After a five-minute stroll, I arrived at the duty-free city. It is not recommended to go out to eat because Haitang Bay is like Sanya more than ten years ago. The hotel's own restaurant is cost-effective, the most important thing is cleanliness and good service. Hope you all experience it by yourself!

I am very grateful to the hotel‚Äôs nina for helping to book the submarine restaurant and helping to reserve the location of the fish tank. It is true that the submarine creativity is good and it is very attractive to eat while watching the scenery, but the dishes and types are relatively conservative and not very prominent. The taste of the finished dishes is good, and they match well. I recommend Buddha Jumping the Wall. The 75th Anniversary Desserts were great, I finished it. The restaurant's sister Yinyi is very cute and has always taken care of the guests, and she would come to ask for help from time to time. However, the price of dinner in the underwater restaurant is relatively high, and there are 658 guests.
The supporting services around the hotel are good, and the travel shots that have to be delivered to the duty-free shop within walking distance also have surprises. The photographer has communicated in advance, so the results are very good.
When I finally left, the hotel‚Äôs nina kindly prepared a little surprise for me, which made this journey a successful conclusion. Not bad will come again in the future.

The bathtub has a separate wooden joist to protect privacy. In addition, every guest who comes to the hotel will have a professional housekeeping service, which includes the introduction of hotel features and the issuance of shopping coupons at duty-free shops. There are also some daily reminders. My housekeeper is Evelyn, and my lady is very considerate. Whether you are shooting a hotel garden view or setting a buffet location in an undersea restaurant, you can find Evelyn Xiaoxu to help you book a place. The young lady is very attentive, not only reminding you of the location of the umbrella in the room, but also reminding you to receive coupons for duty-free shops. Anyway, as long as there is anything you don‚Äôt know about the hotel, you can find Miss Butler. Xiao Xu will be very happy to help you solve the problem. In addition, the business of the undersea restaurant is very hot. If you want to watch the mermaid show by the window, you must make a reservation one or two days in advance. It is recommended to set the location one day before boarding the plane. In addition to the submarine restaurant, the hotel also has the Tianfu restaurant next door. It is 100 meters away from the lobby. There are some Hainanese specialties. The price can be 10% off with the hotel accommodation card. The waiter will give you an accurate order based on how many of you. Dishes are recommended to avoid waste. The few special dishes I ordered tasted good, not greasy! I will come to live next time. A pleasant trip to Hainan. Everyone treats tourists very friendly. Compared with the rumors about Hainan carrying passengers and poor service attitudes in previous years, this year has improved significantly, not bad, not bad, Hainan It is indeed a tourist capital! Next time I travel, I will choose Hainan!

msg:This is probably the best environment and service in InterContinental I have ever stayed in. I didn‚Äôt expect to have a caring butler service when I checked in at the front desk. Thanks to Xiaobai Lottie for the careful arrangement. Once I arrive at the hotel, I will inform the duty-free shop preferential information, make an appoin**ent in advance, and consult during the period. The problem is not solved one by one during working hours. The room is also a pleasant surprise. Welcome fruits are arranged, and you can also lie in bed to watch the sunrise and the sea. The breakfast variety is also very rich, the waiter is very proactive and will help open the door. Even the cleaning aunt will take the initiative to say hello when she meets it on the road. I feel that this is the hardware and software of a five-star hotel!

msg:I chose this hotel mainly to learn diving and research, because I saw that the hotel has a diving center and a sea aquarium. In fact, this goal has been achieved. The hotel itself is better than previously imagined in the evaluation, but there are also some points of communication, so People are not so comfortable, write them down one by one:

1. I booked a sea view room. I received a phone call request before departure. I said it would be fine if it meets the content of the order. When I arrived at the front desk, I had a sea view room but the floor was low and there was no sea view. I asked What can I see, answer to see the platform, I am now? ? Ready to check the order to reason, and later said that I upgraded to a room with a sea view on the 12th floor. I am really... Whether it is an upgraded or an original order, this time is a proper off-season. If you can arrange it, you can arrange it properly. There is no need to say it. So ugly, right

2. Actually, the room feels good. The electric curtains are opened to see the sea view. The balcony is large and there is a bathtub. The area, furniture and soft fittings of the room are all OK. The service staff are also very polite, and the overall hygiene is also good. Yes, especially there is a note on the bedside to provide a variety of pillow choices, which is very good, which makes people feel that the unpleasantness before is unnecessary...

The hotel has a lot of green space extending all the way to the sea. The beach should be public, but there are not many people in the off-season. It feels good. It is only because of the season that you can only look at the sea, but as a guest, it‚Äôs OK, better than before. Much better

3. The diving center is outsourced and does not belong to the hotel itself, but you can use the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool and seawater aquarium. The experience is good, because it is off-season and one-to-one learning is required. The final exam will be taken once in three days. To ow's certificate, in line with expectations

4. The underwater restaurant of the hotel, the highlight is the sea water tank and the mermaid, but the price is a bit more expensive, it feels not very worthwhile

5. The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, just a few steps away. This is a surprise. It is also recommended that the front desk explain clearly to the guests. When I check in, I told me about the shuttle bus, but I clearly remember that I saw it next to me when I came. , I think it‚Äôs very close when I overlook it from the upper floor. I thought I had made a mistake. I asked again before telling "It‚Äôs very close. Some guests think it‚Äôs very close, so they arrange a bus pick-up." This point is also...It is recommended to make it clear from the beginning. Well, because the bus has to be reserved one day in advance, it is really unnecessary

6. Finally, let me talk about Xiaofan Cici, who added me on WeChat. I want to express my gratitude for two things: First, I found out that the order included two breakfasts for children after I checked in. It was very inexplicable. The sea view double room, plus two children Where is the breakfast point? Of course, I didn‚Äôt see the content of such gibberish clearly. After communicating with Cici, I changed the normal breakfast with one person. The response was timely and the processing was very fast. Second, on the day I left, because the outing time was not arranged, Cici helped to delay the check-out. Thank you for your understanding by three o'clock in the afternoon

Above, there is a saying that the overall feeling is beyond expectations. If you can improve on the details, it will be better, and don‚Äôt ask for good comments. I originally planned to give good comments, but when I asked for it, I asked for five stars and screenshots. It was out of thin air. To add some unnecessary dislike

The photo is attached, five stars are not enough, but it is indeed a good experience, will recommend friends to live

The service is very good, especially thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Xu and a female manager at the front desk for their help and care. The living experience is full. The view of the room is facing the lawn, it is a pleasure to wake up every day! Breakfast is as rich and delicious as always, especially the fruit and my favorite passion fruit! I especially recommend the restaurant tunnel under the sea, I like to go twice! Another advantage is that it is super close to the duty-free shop!
The downside is that the pool is slightly smaller. I think that since Haitang Bay cannot go to the sea, we should strengthen the construction of the swimming pool in the park. There is too expensive dining in the hotel. In the intercontinental area of Qiandao Lake before, although the food was not cheap, it felt good value for money!

The intercontinental population density is low, which is much more comfortable than the Atlantis, which was full of people last year. The overall style of the hotel is a low-key style of wood tone, and you can see the intentions of gardening when you walk around the hotel. The headboard of the sea-view room faces the sea, and it is very comfortable to open your eyes every day.
When I checked in, a housekeeper added WeChat. This time, I was received by Cici Xiaofan. If she had something to do, I would get back to WeChat soon, and I would take the initiative to ask if there is a demand. I am very satisfied.
Hardware: I feel that the ventilation in the toilet in the room is not good. Is there no ventilation? The ventilation is too slow. The TV set got stuck for nearly half an hour the next night. There is a problem with the dial prompt on the phone. It was after 12 o'clock when I checked out. I closed the door and realized that I didn't get the water. I couldn't open it when I wanted to go in. I didn't bother to find someone to open the door. This is not so good. You can remind the guests first that the room card will fail after a few hours.
There are many varieties of breakfast, and you can change it for two days.
There is a hotel bus to and from the airport.
I feel that InterContinental is more suitable for business activities or family outings without children.

It is quite caring; you can also take a small train to tour the entire hotel, save yourself walking, and sit to the beach. , Accompany the children to dig sand, walk the waves, and provide mineral water and bath towels at the beach, which are really ubiquitous services. Food is also quite good, and adults and children like it quite a bit. No matter the room is well equipped, the child has a footstool and toiletries, so we don't need to bring our own. This time we went to coincide with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and we also prepared greeting cards and moon cakes. It was really meticulous. For all trips in the hotel, the car at the door can be used to pick up and drop off, which saves us a lot of effort for bringing the baby. But all this is due to the caring butler Alex Wenhao who arranged when InterContinental checked in. He will make arrangements for us according to our situation. All the peace of mind that allows us to travel with the baby will be a lot. InterContinental‚Äôs underwater restaurant will also Ask in advance if there are any arrangements, so that you can arrange a better location. Unfortunately, my child did not call the Underwater World and regretted that he did not go. So Alex Wenhao arranged the small details that we did not expect. The duty-free shop nearby , I also arrange shopping guides to avoid the trouble of long lines. If we have any problems, we will reply and provide help immediately. Even if we have a rest, we will solve them as soon as possible. I really want to give him a praise. Overall this is a hotel worthy of a second visit.

        The most convenient thing about staying at Kaaba Intercontinental is that apart from the hotel, there is a duty-free shop four minutes away, which is simply too convenient for people with shopping needs.

The food is better than the express hotel.

msg:Absolutely pleasantly surprised hotel, I really like this one, from the location (a five-minute walk from the duty-free shop) to the service is satisfactory! Arrived at the hotel just after 11 o'clock at noon, my hotel butler sister Xiao Yang helped us arrange early check-in, and from this moment we enjoy the quality services of InterContinental Kaaba! Sister Xiaoyang, the housekeeper, is really attentive, patient, and attentive. She has troubled her many things after staying for a week, and she has been perfectly resolved, which made my impression of this hotel continue to deepen. The two elderly people in the family are also very satisfied! The breakfast buffet in the hotel is not very rich, but the food is full and the service is also very good. We live on the 15th floor, with invincible sea views, facing the sea every day, clean every day, and enough mineral water pipes. If there is any need, just make a phone call and the housekeeping depar**ent will deliver things to the room. The food delivery service is also fast and good, and the taste is also good, lazy first choice. There are also quite a few entertainment items in the hotel, you can play at least a whole day. The filming effect of the sent trip was super good. Five photos were sent, but they were all very good. I paid another 300 for 15 photos. There is a free bus to the duty-free shop, in fact, it only takes about five minutes to walk there. Eat seafood around, many shops can call the car to pick up the car. After staying for a week, I felt reluctant to leave before I left. I will definitely choose InterContinental Kaaba Resort in Sanya in the future! This is a hotel that makes people really feel at home! I sincerely thank the housekeeper, Sister Xiaoyang, and all the hotel staff who have served our family. For me traveling with the two elderly people, it really helped a lot and made it a lot easier! Stop writing, and then writing will become a small composition, hahaha! Oh, by the way, if you want to talk about the shortcomings, for me, the luxurious afternoon tea in the underwater restaurant is too sweet, it depends on personal taste.

msg:InterContinental is one of my favorite hotel brands. I also went to InterContinental in Chongqing this year. The three-Asia InterContinental has the most beautiful scenery! none of them.
1. From the beginning of the reservation, I feel very good. Xiaofan phoned and communicated with WeChat in advance to understand the needs. The main thing that helped me choose the C room of the hotel, the view is very beautiful, the beauty is very nice. The only unpleasant view is the construction site next to the hotel, which is said to be a tax-free hotel under construction, which is closer to the sea.
2. The room is relatively large, the TV is a bit small, and does not match the room, the wooden facilities are a bit old, the style of a parent-child hotel, suitable for bringing children to play. However, bathing and shampooing are not self-contained. In Chongqing Intercontinental, all are Ferragamo's washing and protective clothing. The bathtub is a bit tasteless. On the balcony, it will be too hot in summer, and it is unlikely to go out in winter.
3. The sea floor restaurant has its own characteristics, and the breakfast is quite hearty, lasting until eleven o'clock. Hainan noodles are delicious! There are many restaurants in the hotel, so you can eat in the pool without going out. Xiaofan's introduction is also very detailed, which one is better and more appropriate.
4. When leaving the store, Mercedes-Benz will send it to the airport. The overall feeling is good!

The strengths of InterContinental are the super large balcony facing the sea and the super large bed, automatic curtains, and simple and a**ospheric lawn that can be seen in the eyes, and the underwater restaurant. Some people say that eating is lonely. , But I think the a**osphere is so-so and the price is right. After all, seeing the turtles, seeing the fish, and seeing the mermaid performance, is not a loss. Finally, he is really close to the duty-free shop. We basically went for a walk at night and bought something by the bow, which was quite happy.
What the hotel needs to improve is the service attitude. Some things that guests have already proposed should be done before, instead of making up when we are unhappy! There is also a singer singing in the lobby at night, and the waiter actually told me that this is a toll area. This surprised me. As a guest, I didn‚Äôt even have the right to sit in the public area. This is a loss of a five-star hotel. Demeanor needs to be improved!
In the end, the hotel corrected it in time. I think it was good. In fact, the communication between the hotel and the guests is very important.

The butler Xiaofan Cici, who added WeChat in advance, was super thoughtful, because the room was upgraded after the birthdays and anniversaries were notified in advance, and it was great. He also gave a variety of snacks, fruit plates, red wine birthday cakes and very pleasant surprises. During the stay, we will promptly follow up everything in time, and will remind you in advance if you need to make an appoin**ent. The room service is also in place. It is cleaned twice a day. No matter what time I encounter it, I will ask if I need to add anything and do I need any help. It‚Äôs so considerate. Stayed for two nights and didn't leave the hotel...the child was reluctant to think about it. The hotel may have to have a distance of 3-400 meters to the beach, which can be taken by a small sightseeing train, and even the concierge can send it there by a battery car. The most intimate thing is that there are almost no extra charge items in the hotel. Swimming rings, sand digging toys, children's playgrounds, and small trains are all free. In addition, the hotel's undersea buffet restaurant is also very good (although I really can't eat anything, soak the hotel every day). The child said that she must bring her grandpa and grandma to stay for a few more days next time. (Friendly reminder, be careful not to touch the ground when eating, it is easy to attract ants)

The location of the hotel is also good. It is convenient to go to the duty-free shop. But this takeaway can't be put outside the hotel, I don't understand. Because the same five-star hotel in Yalong Bay can. The breakfast staff are too few and the service is not in place. I have stayed in the hotel that lacks breakfast service.

msg:At that time, I chose the hotel for a long time between Crown and Intercontinental. In the end, I chose InterContinental and booked two 4-night luxury rooms. What I fancy is the sea view facing the 88-square-meter guest room and the bed. First, evaluate the advantages: the Haohai room is really good, especially the big bed is facing the balcony. Every morning, the electric curtain is opened and the bed looks at the sea. But don't choose the middle room below the 7th floor, as the dome will block a large part of your view. The location of the hotel is very good, just a few minutes walk to the Duty Free City. You can go to the second stage through the overpass. There are a lot of food and it is very convenient. The hotel lobby is open, very grand and full of Southeast Asian style. The breakfast is mostly Chinese noodles. It can meet the needs of children and the elderly. There is a small fish tank next to it. There are many turtles and little devil fish. If the weather is cool, it would be nice to sit outside and eat. Below the fish tank is the underwater restaurant. The lobster set menu at Tianfu Chinese Restaurant is very good, the price is not too expensive for 4-5 people and the price of 1,000 is not too expensive, the dishes, tastes and service are very good, praise one. In addition, the hotel room service is also very good, the price is not expensive, the mobile phone order is convenient, and it can be delivered within half an hour. The greenery of the hotel is good, there is a large lawn, and the beach is just walking past, but it is too awful, and there are almost no people on the big beach. The sand is not as fine as the Yalong Bay. Haitang Bay has relatively large waves, and there are no marine projects in the hotel. Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: the biggest shortcoming lies in the service. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no bellman who took the initiative to help carry the luggage. Our family waited on the sofa next to it until after we checked in. The so-called butler brought us into the guest room floor, and no one introduced us to the hotel's facilities. It was entirely our own exploration. The breakfast service was not positive enough to close empty plates. The waiter often walked past our table empty-handed but turned a blind eye to the few empty plates piled on the table. There are not many restaurants in the hotel. The all-day dining restaurant does not serve buffet in the evening. If you want a buffet, you can only go to the sea bottom restaurant. The price of 668 is a bit expensive. The hotel swimming pool is not big, one adult pool, one adult and children pool. All are outdoor swimming pools, no indoor swimming pools. Because there are children at home, they all play in the children‚Äôs pool, but there is a net red glass self-rowing boat for people to experience in the pool, and the boat is often unable to control the boat well, and it is easy to hit people, especially when there are too many people. . Let's talk about room service. The hinge of the toilet lid slipped off when I first checked in. It can be seen that the toilet lid did not turn up at all when cleaning, otherwise it would be impossible to find it. In addition, I need to complain about the most basic sanitation every day. Since the adults and children were tired on the first day, only the waiter was asked to change the towels. But in the next few days, the waiter really only changed the towels, did not do any cleaning, and did not replace the toiletries. It was not until the last night to improve and clean up completely. The hotel did a return visit the night before leaving the store, and I reported all these questions to the hotel. The hotel provided V3 fruit plate and red wine to make up for it, but because it was about to leave the store to catch a flight the next day, there was no tasting. I hope that as an established 5-star InterContinental, I will use more snacks in service management. .

Although there is a small episode later, it is actively solved for me. The big brand hotels are different, and they attach great importance to the customer experience. , I will continue to choose Intercontinental next time

msg:I have been in Sanya for 8 consecutive years, and I have stayed in several hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. InterContinental is really good. The amy service attitude at the front desk is very good. The room was upgraded and the hotel activities were introduced carefully. üëçThe daisy of the guest depar**ent is even more responsive, and I applied for a late check-out, which is greatly praised. Daily room cleaning is the best, at least twice a day. This is much better than other hotels, and I am very satisfied! The breakfast is very rich and varied. In fact, I can't eat much every day, but there are many choices. Baoluo noodles are really delicious. I recommend trying! I also ate at the Undersea Restaurant and Tianfu Chinese Restaurant. The Chinese restaurant is more recommended for taste. The taste is great. The glass windows of the Undersea Restaurant are better than the tunnel view. The hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs pool is very suitable for children to play, that is, the water in the pool with a slide is almost a bit, there are not many people playing, it is a pity that it is not fully utilized. The swimming pool can borrow a variety of swimming laps and water toys. The beach provides sand dredging toys for free. It is okay to not bring anything when you come to the store. It is really easy to travel. There are everything here. The activities in the children‚Äôs club are also very good. One day it rains, and it will not be boring to take the children to play in the club for a day. In short, a week in the hotel will not be boring, every day will be very fulfilling! It‚Äôs very close to the duty-free shop. It‚Äôs a 10-minute walk. If you apply one day in advance, you can get a 5% discount. I should stay here again next time.

msg:Today I have time to give a serious comment. There are definitely many advantages. Abundant parent-child activities, bringing a baby will not be boring. The facilities inside and outside the hotel are good. Mineral water is available everywhere, and children‚Äôs play items are also free. The beach in Bialong Bay is okay, very clean, and there are many choices for breakfast.
Mainly talk about the shortcomings I encountered:
1. I booked a premium sea view room, which is a few hundred larger than the ordinary sea view room. It is on the 15th floor. It is on the left side, but there is no particularly good angle. There is a large construction site on the right side of the hotel. It is huge. Our room is almost straight. To the construction site, if I take a seascape, I need to avoid it in order not to photograph it, and it is the kind that will exist for a few years in a short period of time, and there is no way. Picture one is the construction site I deliberately photographed alone, and picture two is the scenery facing my balcony. The construction site is still very influential and can only be avoided by looking at it from another angle.
2. After reading a lot of good reviews, they said that there is a housekeeper and would add wx, because we just came from Ritz and like this way of communication. As a result, we stayed for three days and two nights, and no one added me. Heap questions are all asked by themselves over the phone. The feeling is really the cold feeling of the big hotel.
3. The hotel‚Äôs sanitation is good. I ordered a double bed and called the waiter to put together a big bed. They put it together professionally. It was not simply smashed together, and it started from the mattress to be layered layer by layer, which was amazing. But we almost played outside the next day. We didn‚Äôt see any cleaning every time we came back. There was no cleaning from 10 o‚Äôclock to 4 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. We called twice and didn‚Äôt come. The cleaning house was hung up for a day, but no one came. In the end, my husband called again at 6-7 o'clock before coming to clean. This experience is particularly bad. Ritz always cleans at least twice a day, and there is a good night gift.
4. There was welcome fruit on the day of check-in, but there was no more on the next day. I didn‚Äôt add anything. I called to ask for a little bit. The lady on the phone said that it would be delivered soon, but after a minute, I received a call, saying that I was embarrassed and only checked in. Fruits are only available on the same day, and you will need to buy them later. I may not be harmed if there is no comparison. Fruits are all managed in Ritz, and hotels may have their own regulations.
5. The bathtub in the hotel is on the balcony. My baby likes to take a bath very much, but it is definitely not possible to soak in these few days. One is that there is only an outdoor fence, which is a bit dangerous. The other is that the weather is very hot and I can‚Äôt enjoy this thing very well. I believe that most of the bathtubs are left unused, which is really a waste and a pity.
Finally, I hope that these feelings can help you understand the hotel more three-dimensionally.

msg:The hotel is not bad. I called the parent-child room in advance and said it was the wedding anniversary. The room was also arranged. I chose the Kaaba in order to bring the children to experience the undersea restaurant. However, because the meal was ordered late, the seat was very bad and it was a big pillar. Blocking the view, the children are 122 cm tall, and the buffet is half price. The child only ate two lollipops. There are very few buffets, nothing delicious, and the service staff are not very positive. Fortunately, when I saw the mermaid show, it was more expensive, and occasionally extravagant. Compared with the Kaaba, Yanlord‚Äôs buffet dinner was cheaper and delicious.

In order to avoid the trouble of changing rooms for two nights, considering that there are no rooms in the same room type, Daisy, the hotel guest depar**ent, took the initiative to help. Both room types have been upgraded, which made us very touched. During our stay, we also frequently provided various consultations and assistance to make our trip to Sanya a perfect end.

Guests in the hotel can take mineral water for free at any time; considering that the water is easy to catch cold at the pool, it is provided at any time Heating bath towels; on the beach, taking into account that guests who play well in the sand need to wash, showers are installed at the beach exit for cleaning; room sanitation services are provided at least twice a day, trash bags are removed in time, and used towels and bathrobes are cleaned up and replaced. Supplement drinking water...Details determine success or failure. If you want a good holiday experience, InterContinental is your best choice!

The staff are very polite. The turn-down brother, the cleaning aunt, the lifeguard, and the young lady in the lobby bar

msg:It‚Äôs next door to the largest duty-free shop in Sanya. It‚Äôs only a five-minute walk away, and the hotel‚Äôs electric car ferry us to the entrance of the hotel, which is closer to the duty-free shop. Haha. When I checked in, I arranged room 12 on the 11th floor facing the sea, almost facing the east to see the sunrise. After check-in, Daisy served as a hotel butler and gave warm and heartfelt service throughout the whole process. Thank you very much for making us feel at home.

The hotel and room facilities are pretty good in all aspects. There is a very large desk on the right hand side after entering the door. I can do some work occasionally. The prompt signs in all aspects are also in place to let me know how to correctly place all kinds of use. Used indoor products to improve the efficiency of room cleaning; the sliding door leading to the balcony is very tightly sealed, soundproofing is excellent and I have lived for three days without mosquitoes; the automatic curtains are opened every morning to face the sea and I feel great. There is also a large bathtub on the right side of the balcony for bathing, which is very comfortable.

The only hope that the hotel can upgrade the toilet in the future. If there is a smart toilet, it must be very comfortable. Haha; the beach area is a public beach, and there are no hotel-specific facilities for playing on the beach. Of course, everyone will go to duty-free shops more often. Let's play.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent. Haitang Bay C is next to the duty-free shop. It is very convenient for shopping and dining.
Efficient and convenient check-in and check-out procedures
The room is clean and a**ospheric, the layout is reasonable, the furniture and facilities are well maintained
The huge floor-to-ceiling glass door on the balcony allows you to enjoy the unobstructed view of the sea and the sky while lying on the bed
Garden style, dense vegetation, clean beach, beautiful environment
Hotel Chinese restaurant Delicious dishes, fresh ingredients, elegant environment, highly recommended
Butler Xiaofan Cici is enthusiastic and physically able to solve our needs efficiently and in a timely manner, adding a lot to the hotel service
Talk about other feelings
1. The ocean restaurant has a good environment and abundant fish. The moment when the mermaid sister appeared, the whole audience was delicious, but the taste of seafood and other dishes was average. At the same time, many children affected the dining experience. The restaurant is more suitable for families with children.
2. The breakfast is rich in variety and variety, but it is not very delicious.
3. The duty-free shop next to the hotel is under construction along the coast. The view of the room next to the duty-free shop will be affected. It is recommended that the hotel confirm the room location in advance when booking.
In general, for adults, InterContinental Tianfang is definitely the first choice for booking Haitang Bay Hotel.

msg:awesome! The second time I came to Sanya, I chose for a long time and decided to live in Haitang Bay Intercontinental. I really did not choose the wrong one! Found a lot of details, automatic curtains! Open the door and open the curtain by yourself! Cool~ The waiter will clean the room and fold your clothes for you. . The bath water is very big! There are two sinks for washing at the same time! It is also equipped with children's bathing shampoo, very intimate! The hair dryer is Dyson's, as used at home! There are many pillow choices! Open the window to see the sea! Although I think it‚Äôs a bit far to go to the beach, I guess it will take ten minutes to walk, but the sand on the beach is particularly fine and pollution-free, much better than the Dadonghai in Sanya Bay! Almost every service staff will greet you. After having breakfast for a few days, there are quite a lot of varieties, but there will be no cucumber juice in the next few days! Very sad! If you want to talk about the shortcomings, it is that the toilet exhaust is not good. . There was a peculiar smell after going to the toilet. . The bed is too soft! Sleeping back pain~ My husband said that next time I come to Sanya, I will choose this one!

I took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type, and as soon as we entered the lobby of the hotel, a lady butler greeted us and asked very intimately.
Xiaofan Cici is our butler, the service is very good, the attitude is also very good, he also sent red wine and fruit plate very intimate, and kept asking us what we need.
The hotel care is a favorite of Bai Rui De, the gym is also very good, although the underwater restaurant did not eat lobster, but the photo is not bad. Staying in so many hotels at Intercontinental Kaaba is a very good experience, so I continued to stay and will come again in the future!

Parking lot üÖøÔ∏è: There are ground and underground parking spaces. The underground parking spaces are very large. It is super easy to park. You don't have to worry about bumping into the car door next to it. It's really amazing that Sanya can park underground, and there is no need to start to cool the car in advance!
Room: Free upgrade to the sea-view double room, the room area is as big as before, you can directly see the blue sky, white clouds and green grass outside and the sea horizon when you lie on the bed.
Breakfast: You have to swipe your room card to enter. You can't just report your room number, you must remember to bring your room card! The taste is still very good, but the smell of oily smoke near the door is a bit choking, I hope it can strengthen the exhaust of the restaurant~
Service: Before check-in, the butler Xiaofan Cici added WeChat in advance. After check-in, he also specially told me that the minibar is free, so considerate! I will also care about the experience of the guests staying, and after leaving the store, I will also care about whether to reach the next stop safely! Be sure to praise ~ Cici, a great beauty who is very considerate of the guests, I wish business prosperous~~~ I will stay in InterContinental Sanya in the future, with new and good services!

I ate at all three restaurants. I was persuaded to see that the online reviews were not very high. The prices are not cheap but they are all good ingredients and sufficient. The seafood pizza is full of oysters and shrimps. It is estimated that it is. There are more people ordering hotel meals to the hotel, and I didn‚Äôt meet too many people in the restaurant during the Dragon Boat Festival.
        There are also many activities for children in the hotel, except for one day when it rains and there are more people in the children‚Äôs playground, there are basically just a few children.
         This time I went to live and upgraded the family suite for free. It‚Äôs just that the floor is not high and I can‚Äôt see the sea. I had no idea about the sea view before. After I went there, I thought the sea view should be pretty good. shop

The room is transparent from north to south and the aisle is also very good. It is spacious, facing the duty-free city, and the scenery is also very good. The south side faces the sea with unobstructed views. All kinds of intimate details, Ferragamo's souvenirs, children‚Äôs toiletries, and the large balcony bathtub children like to play in the water. The hair dryer is also Dyson‚Äôs. The feeling of staying in is really good. In the evening, there is a resident singing and drinking wine and listening to the music at the edge of the lobby. It is very comfortable to walk through the duty-free city for 10 minutes. It is very convenient. There are food and other duty-free cities. If you want to spend a quiet vacation in Sanya, Haitang Bay is really a good choice, it is clean and very clean, and it is really fun to buy and buy in the duty-free city!

msg:This time I brought my family and I stayed at the Intercontinental Kaaba. To be honest, the room did not surprise me. It was a standard room and a suite that turned into a connecting room, but I felt very comfortable after checking in, and everything in the hotel felt just right. First of all, the hotel is very quiet and it doesn't feel crowded even during peak season. Secondly, the hotel has abundant facilities for various parent-child activities, and there is basically no charge. The hotel also comes with a diving pool, and the baby experienced snorkeling, and the price is reasonable. The beach of the hotel is quite big, and there are not many people. Except for the heat, there is nothing wrong with it. Finally, let's talk about the food and beverages. I have experienced various packages in various restaurants. In short, I am not disappointed. In the end, I would like to praise the housekeeper cici. I added cici WeChat when I checked in. If you have any questions on WeChat, you can ask cici to reply in time, so that we can travel without worry.

msg:I chose the parent-child family room. The children are very happy. Although they can't face the sea view, they can see the whole city of Sanya. The room has completely large glass windows, from the terrace to the bedroom, the glass has a very good view. I was fortunate enough to meet the waiter, who was also not far from home, and was very enthusiastic.
