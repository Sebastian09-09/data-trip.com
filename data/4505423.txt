msg:The service was great, the staff were nice and really did their best to assist. I would like to especially mention Yuan (not sure about the spelling) who attended to us when we arrived on our first night. she assisted with my questions even if we had to use a translator. I had so many problems at one time as it was our first night and she tried to patiently give me a solution or an answer.

We got lost going to the hotel as we came by metro and the maps were not accurate enough to find it easily. We asked three people and the last one finally called the hotel to ask where it was. When we reaches the hotel, the one on duty was already waiting for us at the door. 

Just when we thought the tea time was over, as we were tired and hungry after all that searching, that‚Äôs when she brought a new batch of creme brulee and nicely designed yoghurt. I kid you not, that‚Äôs the best tasting yoghurt for me ever (I‚Äôve tasted so many all these years from many different countries and brands).

The breakfast had enough variety and good quality food. Rooms were clean and comfortable.

msg:Great hotel with convenient access to subway. But it is a bit far from touristic places as you need to circle the mountain to go to the lake. It is more peaceful than city center hotel, so it is recommended if you want a relaxed/peaceful stay. 

Breakfast is good but mostly Chinese style. The western food is limited to a slice of bread, jam and a cup of coffee. If you like salty breakfast, it is a good hotel. If you like sweet breakfast, you should go somewhere else. 

I enjoy a lot the lobby of the hotel that is peaceful and with free afternoon tea. 

The room is a bit dark, especially the bathroom part. It is difficult to see clearly in the night.

We made use of the laundry room which was well equipped with washers dryers and ironing facilities.
The hotel is very near to a metro station but it took us a while to find. Ask at reception for directions as our electronic map didn‚Äôt find it.
Afternoon tea was a lovely extra.
One observation is that the mood lighting of our room was excellent but an option for a brighter light in the bathroom area would be useful.
A great hotel and would definitely recommend.

The room was sooo spacious and clean. The bath tub was huge, bathroom and shower too. 

This hotel is a food heaven. Breakfast is amazing, lots of options. I had a smoked salmon salad, fried eggs and fruit bowl. Everything is fresh and delicious. 

They have a free tea time from 1pm to 3pm. They serve different sandwiches , waffles , sweet bakeries and tea and coffee. 

The service was amazing, everyone is friendly from front desk, chefs, housekeepers literally everyone. 

There was a road passing by my room but I couldn‚Äôt hear any outside noise. 

The weather wasn‚Äôt great on the days I was there. It was raining, I couldn‚Äôt go outside. I‚Äôm definitely visiting Nook Hotel again! 

Lucy was soooo helpful with everything, she assisted me with the taxi when I was leaving. She spoke to the driver and even helped with my luggage. 

Nook Hotel is not like a fancy hotel but because of the size, you feel seen and important.

Room size was good‚Ä¶ spacious enough to still provide a 2-seater sofa, and a single armchair. Coffee making, kettle of good quality. 

Bathroom shower was good, vanity top very good and even a spacious area for a bath tub. 

It was cold outside at 2 - 5 degrees, but it was warm and good inside.

Breakfast was good and tasty. Coffee was good.

We had dinner at their in-house restaurant, and good was great! 

Front desk staff was warm and very friendly, and provided much assistance to us in hiring taxis, and showing us how to get around. It made our day as getting around was super easy with the directions given by one of the senior female staff ( which unfortunately I did not manage to get her name). She was patient and super helpful.

And housekeeping lady was equally warm and friendly. 

We had a lovely time here. We chose this location because it was only 15 minutes to Xixi Wetlands , which we wanted to visit and attend the night show : Jin Xi Gong Xixi. It was a beautiful performance, not to be missed. But they are closed for winter now. 

To get to West Lake, there is a Metro 450 m away and will take you pretty fast there.

After we arrived, the tool staff let the children choose a gift. There were some small toys in the small bag, which made the children very happy. We were upgraded to a studio (the one with a big bed and a bathtub). The mountain view was very nice and comfortable. I will book this room type directly in the future. The room decoration is very high-end and beautiful. There is also a book bar in the lobby (very much like a bookstore) and afternoon tea. One night when we came back late, I went to the lobby to get some afternoon tea to bring to the room. It felt like going home to the kitchen to find food. I personally liked it. The furniture in the room we stayed in all had rounded corners. I noticed this because I have children. The hotel also has an indoor playground for children to play. I really sigh that the design of this hotel is so thoughtful and cost-effective. I highly recommend it!

msg:It was my first time to travel to Hangzhou and I stayed at Xinyu Hotel for 3 days. I was very satisfied with it in every aspect.
Hotel lobby: The environment is clean and the design is good. As soon as you enter, you can tell that it is not an old-school hotel.
Surrounding area: There is a FamilyMart within a 5-minute walk. Although it is not very big, it is enough for our needs. Please note that it is only open until 10 o'clock. The hotel is very close to the scenic spot, and it usually takes half an hour to get there by taxi. The surrounding environment is very quiet, which is great when sleeping. It is cool, quiet and comfortable. The price is that we don‚Äôt have a lot of food. Usually we order takeout and it‚Äôs delivered in about 30 minutes, so it‚Äôs not a big problem.
Corridor: Clean, with a fresh scent, not bad.
Room: Much bigger than expected, very clean, no smell. There is a table for takeout. The bed was clean and the pillows were a bit soft. After the feedback, a hard pillow was provided in about 5 minutes, and the soft pillow was folded under it to sleep on. The height and firmness were just right. The softness of the bed is moderate, not too soft, not too hard, just right.
Toilet: There are door handles inside to separate the shower, toilet and sink. I like this design very much. The toilet has all the supplies I need: hair dryer, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, shower supplies... And the water pressure in the shower is enough, and the hot water is hot enough! Washes very well.
Cleaning service: Cleaning is very good, supplies are fully replenished, and the room feels like a new one every time I return to it. I met the cleaning lady once and she took the initiative to say hello. Professional and courteous.
Front desk customer service: proactive, friendly and courteous. As long as we walk to the front desk, the customer service staff will take the initiative to greet us. Sometimes they will even step out of the front desk to help. If another waiter is free, they will also take the initiative to help.
Among them, the tall, thin man with glasses at the front desk was very proactive and willing to help with express delivery issues, which made our trip more worry-free. There is also a front desk lady with big eyes and fair skin who is professional, fast and proactive. She can handle basically all problems quickly and accurately. Knowing that our driver would arrive after 2 o'clock, even though there were many guests, he tried his best to put our luggage for us at 3 o'clock. Now we can buy souvenirs easily and safely. Finally, before leaving the hotel, he took the initiative to see us off the hotel and returned the luggage to us. We provide mineral water.
To be honest, this kind of experience at this price is really cost-effective. If there is anything that can be improved, it is to improve the knowledge of the surrounding area, such as where to buy the nearest souvenirs and what time the nearby convenience stores are open. But these are just small shortcomings, and the flaws do not cover up the advantages. Overall, five-star praise!

Our group of foreign friends are also very satisfied, and we have seen many other foreigners. It can only be said that this hotel has the ability to receive tourists from all over the world. This trip gave us a lot of unexpected surprises. The hotel staff team is well-trained, the restaurant food is full of a**osphere, and the hotel rooms are spacious and textured.

msg:A very nice hotel, with courteous and considerate service staff. There is a nice aroma when you walk into the lobby. The subway entrance of Line 3 is a few hundred meters away. It is also not far from Tianmu Li, which is very convenient for shopping. The room is quite standard, and the quilt and mattress are quite comfortable. The Zhiwei Restaurant on the first floor is surprisingly delicious. It is a paradise where you can relax without crowds during the May Day holiday. I will come again!

The room is clean, but the bathroom is too dim, so it is a bit difficult to find things when you drop them. 3. The so-called mountain view room is separated from the mountain by a road, but the windows are very soundproof. 4. The curtains have poor light blocking performance, and light leaks from top to bottom, which is not acceptable for people who sleep lightly. 5. The facilities are simple, especially the hair dryer has too little wind.

I arrived early and thought I couldn't check in. The front desk was very enthusiastic to help me check the arrangements. Seeing that I was alone, they arranged a higher floor. Remind me that there is afternoon tea. When I checked out, they also asked if I needed to bring some water or coffee. Very considerate.
The room design and decoration are simple and comfortable, and the bedding and towels are clean. There is also a coffee machine and Hangzhou specialty tea (Jiuquhongmei and Longjing) in the room.
In terms of transportation, the Gudangxincun subway station is more than 100 meters downhill. There are restaurants next door, such as Starbucks, Jiangnanyi, Tianlunli, etc. Convenient and delicious.
In short, I am very satisfied and will come again.

He told us that free afternoon tea would be provided every day. The food was good. Considering that we were rarely in the hotel and left early and came back late, we booked a garden view room. There was no bathtub, but the room was good. The only bad thing was that the hygiene was not very clean. There were hairs on the floor and spider webs in the bathroom. I was afraid of spiders, so it was a little scary to see spider webs.

You can also go directly to Xiangji Temple on the Grand Canal. It is outside the restricted area, so just park your car at the hotel. Driving in Hangzhou scenic spots is not as convenient as public transportation. The breakfast is different from other star-rated hotels. Basically, I didn't eat any semi-finished products. It felt like they were all cooked in the morning. You can also make iced Americano yourself. Overall, it is good. I will come again if I have the chance.

Afternoon tea, breakfast, and snacks live up to their reputation and are very satisfying. The surroundings are quiet and it is pleasant to drink tea in the room. The hotel service is top notch and cannot be faulted. The disadvantage is that the air conditioner is a central air conditioner, which cannot be adjusted at will, and cannot meet different needs during alternating cold and warm seasons.

The food is so fresh and deliciousüòã

I checked in early in the morning and was not sure if I had left something behind. The staff was very enthusiastic to help check and find it. And since I have stayed in many hotels, there are very few hotels that I have not received positive reviews from during the whole trip, but the overall stay experience deserves a lot of praise.
Also, I especially like the big shower üöøIt‚Äôs really amazing

msg:I decided to go to Hangzhou at the last minute, so I looked for a hotel on Ctrip. I considered going to Lingyin Temple and West Lake. I didn‚Äôt consider the area around West Lake, so I focused on the area around Lingyin Temple. I liked this hotel the first time I saw it. I decided on this hotel after reading many reviews.
If you come by car, there are not many parking spaces on the ground in the hotel, but there are also underground parking spaces. There is also a slow charging charging station in the underground garage. The design style of the hotel can be felt from the entrance to the lobby. Although the lobby is in dark colors, the overall feeling is very Warm and comfortable. The hotel upgraded the room type when I checked in in the middle of the week. I was pleasantly surprised. The upgraded room has a great view. The interior of the room is also full of design style, whether it is the painting on the door, the setting of the bathroom, and the lighting and decoration style of the shower room. I also like the dark glass partitions in the room and bathroom area. It is very fashionable and improves the space. The room supplies are also very thoughtful. I also gave gifts to the children when I checked in, which is very thoughtful.
The hotel offers afternoon tea from 1:30 to 5 pm every day. Although it is just a few simple snacks, paired with tea, it feels very warm for guests who have come from afar.
The breakfast variety is also quite rich. In addition to the food on the dining table, there are also wonton noodles, eggs and egg pancakes that can be ordered. There are also many types of fruits, as well as cold meat.

When I was visiting, I found a hotel with a great sense of design and quietness, which seemed to combine the poetry and charm of Hangzhou. The leisurely feelings are hidden in the eyes. This hotel is very cost-effective in all aspects, whether it is service, facilities, breakfast, parking, or location. After returning from the tour, you can sit in the seating area in the hotel lobby, enjoy afternoon tea and read a book, which is extremely comfortable.

You don't have to worry too much when you go to burn incense early in the morning. I am also very satisfied with the various surrounding service measures of the hotel.

The small cakes for afternoon tea are made with homemade cream üßÅMy mother loves them so much, and the environment for breakfast in the morning is also very warm. I think homemade yogurt also tastes great, like cheese. On the way there, I also saw a children's toy room, laundry room, etc.

Hygiene: The hotel is not new, but the hygiene is really good. It is no exaggeration, everything is spotless! Apart from eating, sleeping and having fun, you really don‚Äôt need to worry too much. Highly recommended!

It was Chris**as Eve and I had red wine brewed, but I didn‚Äôt drink it because I was driving. I went to Tianmu at night and had a look around. There were quite a lot of people there. I went for breakfast quite late and it was okay to eat. There was one bagel left, so I felt it was a bit of a waste and asked if I could take it away. The service staff immediately gave me a box to pack it for me. The children's paradise children had a great time playing with the two little girls who lived in the same hotel. Before we left, we were given apples for Chris**as Eve. The service was really good, especially the young lady with short hair and glasses. She was very nice when we asked about the way to climb the mountain. She also helped us make coffee and pour fruit tea, which was really nice! The other service staff were also very nice. I spent a very happy two days. Thank you. I will take my family there again if I have the opportunity.

 The initial check-in experience was good. The girl at the front desk was quite enthusiastic. However, around ten o'clock in the evening, loud noises kept coming from upstairs, such as running and jumping, and the noise lasted for at least two hours. The sound insulation effect was also really poor. The whole family can't sleep! Going out for a day would be quite tiring. Still can't sleep well! I couldn't bear it anymore and I contacted the hotel front desk many times but to no avail. During the two hours of so-called resolution, I did not receive any satisfactory feedback.
The male hotel colleague came to our room and gave feedback and said: Hello, I have already told them, and there is nothing I can do if there is any noise! !
It‚Äôs so outrageous that our kids couldn‚Äôt sleep well all night.

Maybe this time I was unlucky. Anyway, I would not consider staying at this hotel again.
If you are a parent with a small child, it is recommended to change to another hotel. There is nothing on the guardrail...

There is a direct bus to Lingyin, but the road up the mountain from Lingyin is constantly jammed and takes a long time. You can share a bicycle and it is almost there after passing through the Lingxi Tunnel, which takes about 25 minutes.
Buffet afternoon tea: 1:30-17:00 p.m. There is pizza, small durian tarts, biscuits, coffee, tea, and milk tea. You can take it yourself. There are not many varieties, but the taste is pretty good. You can enjoy it in the lobby, or you can pack some to take back. Room
Service: The staff are very attentive, and there are masks and alcohol disinfectant wipes at the front desk. There is also mineral water. When we arrived, it was not time to check in. They helped us store our luggage and then we went to play first.

Facilities: All basic facilities are available. Except that I think the light in the shower room is a little dim, there is basically nothing else.

All in all, this will be the hotel of choice next time

In terms of environment, it is very quiet and the small hotel feels like home. There is not much noise at night, and it is close to the Ant Park. There is a shuttle bus to and from the area, which is very convenient. At the same time, it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the subway station, making it convenient to go out.

In terms of service, the staff are very, very, very considerate, and you feel like home from the moment you check in. Among them, I forgot to pick up my small bag in the lobby, and the staff proactively called me to remind me to retrieve it. Thumbs up. Especially after checking out on the last day, the outdoor temperature was only 15 degrees. The front desk took the initiative to ask if we needed coffee and helped make coffee. I really like it.

It can be said that this hotel is the most satisfying experience of our trip to Hangzhou, and we will book here next time!

I called customer service and he said there was no way to turn it on. He said he would give me a fan and asked me to open the window. It was so funny. , the indoor temperature was 26 degrees, and I woke up sweating even after sleeping. Finally, I called Ctrip customer service and asked for a refund before the store would turn on the air conditioner.



Environment: The so-called mountainous area faces the scrapyard

Service: There was no way to turn on the air conditioner. He told me to give me a fan and asked me to open the window. It was so funny that the indoor temperature was 26 degrees.

For people like me who have high requirements for food, the breakfast has fewer choices but the taste is very online! I am very full! I am a person who often suffers from insomnia when I go out to stay in hotels. I slept very well last night, which means that the bedding is moderately soft and hard.

The boss suggested that we go for a walk on the Xishan Trail next to it. It‚Äôs really great! In the afternoon, the hotel provides free afternoon tea, which is in the lobby. There are so many varieties of sandwiches, egg tarts, desserts, biscuits, coffee, scented tea, beef patties, French fries, etc. Two steps downstairs is Starbucks, convenience store, KFC, McDonald's, probably the headquarters of Ant Financial is here, so the supporting facilities are very good.
The boss is very nice. He talked for a while after we met during the three days of our stay. He is very kind. The staff is very good. The young ladies at the front desk help my daughter with beautiful braids every day. The eldest sister and the manager in the breakfast room offer help. It is no exaggeration to say that the breakfast is much better than too many luxury hotels. There will always be a new dish. I like the beef with spinach on the first morning and the chicken feet with chilli on the second day. They are really operating with care and give people a feeling of being at home.
By the way, the sound insulation is really good, and the mountain view room is facing the street, but with the blessing of four layers of glass, you can completely meditate after closing it!
Hangzhou, I really like it, I will only choose here next time! See you next time

There was a lady wearing glasses who was very enthusiastic. Thank you for her hospitality~ I even extended the check-out. I got up at 5:30 in the morning and went to Su Causeway at 6:30 to take a two-hour rowing boat , I can catch up with breakfast when I come back, and catch up on sleep.

If the air conditioner is turned on, it is cold, but when it is turned off at 26 degrees, the wind is still cold, which feels a little unreasonable. The attitude of the front desk is quite good, but the sanitation staff likes to make loud noises in the corridor, which especially affects the experience.
I'm still very satisfied with the hotel's breakfast. It's rich in variety and tastes good. It's delicious!
If you go back late at night, the location of the hotel is still a bit out of the way. It is not recommended to go back to the hotel too late

At dawn, the children clamored to go downstairs to blow bubbles.
The corner of the afternoon tea is small and delicate, very practical!
The biscuits belonged to Sam, and they were so delicious that I bought the same biscuits from Sam's Speedy that night.
The meals in the breakfast restaurant and Zhiwei Xiaoguan are also very good. Tired from walking all day, there is something to eat downstairs. The dishes are exquisite, delicious, and not expensive.
The ladies at the front desk are very enthusiastic, and even make coffee for us according to our taste.

There are not many types of breakfast but it is exquisite enough, and the waiter warmly received them and made egg rolls for the children. The patience and smiles at the front desk made our family feel very warm.
It is very close to Tianmuli, Botanical Garden and Wetland Museum.
When checking out in the afternoon, we were delayed because the baby was taking a nap. The lobby offers waffles, sandwiches, pizza, and coffee. Although I didn't eat them, my family said they tasted good.
I seldom comment. I didn't deliberately take pictures. I decided to post a review after I left. A hotel that is very friendly to babies, this feels like the last time it was the Sanya Ritz-Carlton haha.

Not enough fitness equipment!

3) There is no movie selection or set-top box for watching TV

4) There is no Wi-Fi provided. You need a local domestic phone number to connect to Wi-Fi. For foreigners,
It's very inconvenient

5) No frosted stickers in restrooms and shower areas
It is very embarrassing for a family to stay in a hotel

6) The bathroom is not pumped

The coffee is also very delicious, and there are various snacks, and then the service is very good. At first, because I was really angry when I couldn't find the hotel, and when I got to the hotel, I felt like I was back home. I have already recommended it to my friends.

msg:Today I finally have time to give an evaluation. In fact, I have a lot to say. Divide it into advantages and disadvantages.
advantage:
1. The hotel staff really make people feel at home, they will take the initiative to say hello, they will take the initiative to inquire after breakfast, and they will give the baby a washing set when they first arrive at the hotel, and the small bags are also very cute.
2. In fact, most of the breakfasts in domestic hotels are quite good. The hotel‚Äôs breakfasts are both Chinese and Western. There is no need to wait for a table, the environment is ok, and the staff are very enthusiastic.
3. The toiletries are quite complete, and there are more considerate cotton pads.
4. You can also drink coffee at the bar at any time, and there is unlimited supply of snacks.
5. I reserved a small tent with the hotel in advance, and the children still like it very much.
shortcoming:
1. In fact, I personally think that it is not suitable for bringing babies. The overall style of the hotel is dark. Whether it is in the lobby or in the rooms, the lighting is very dim, which is very difficult for the eyes. It is more suitable for couples. The bathroom didn't have a main light, and it was still made of black marble, so the baby didn't want to go in and take a bath. Compared with the gym that no one cares about, the children's area can actually be made bigger. If it is cloudy and rainy, children cannot discharge their discharges in the hotel at present.
2. The cleaning of the hotel auntie can be more detailed, there will be omissions, and things like bathrobes will not be changed every day.
3. You can change more types of breakfast. If you stay for more than three days, you will definitely get tired of eating.

Facilities: The room is small. The facilities listed in the room are very old. The wardrobe is torn. The floor lamp is crooked. The curtains are wrinkled‚Ä¶..

Hygiene: There are mold spots in the hygiene and the carpet is very dirty. You can hardly tell the original color of the carpet.

Environment: Designer hotel doesn‚Äôt look like that at all. The only possibility is that there is room to stand in the bathroom shower area.

Service: Not to mention. Let‚Äôs talk about a little detail: After checking out and leaving the hotel, I wanted to borrow a bicycle. But the front office staff expressed reluctance to lend it out. The lobby manager has basic professional qualities and said: It can be lent. Looking at this rather awkward look, I decided to forget it and go ride a shared bicycle.
ü§îAlso, the response time of room service is OK. It's okay to get parking tickets and so on. But as far as serving temperature is concerned...
Probably won't be a repeat customer.

msg:I took my parents and children with me on this trip, and the whole family was very, very satisfied with this hotel. The hotel is a boutique hotel with a small number of rooms, so the flow of people is not large, and there is no queue waiting to check in or have breakfast. The hotel is decorated in a modern style all day long. The hotel lobby is equipped with a large number of books collected by the boss, which can be read at will. The public areas are also very functional, including children's paradise, gym, and conference rooms. The rooms are equipped with complete supporting facilities and coffee capsules. Coffee machine, kettle, tea set with tea leaves, free small refrigerator, and small moon cakes that echo the Mid-Autumn Festival.
The biggest highlight of the hotel is the service. This is also the most touching thing for the elderly in the family. From the boss, to the front desk, to the aunt who cleans the room, they are all enthusiastic and patient. They will take the initiative to ask if they need a mask. I am patient and help with inquiries. For travel routes, we specially prepared small lucky bags for children during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which contained 4 to 5 small toys such as a kaleidoscope, a small watch, and a bubble blower, as well as a variety of snacks. If the children cannot finish their breakfast in time, the waiter will help pack it. In addition, the lobby bar has a high-end version of afternoon tea every afternoon, with coffee, black tea and homemade fruit tea to meet the different needs of the three generations of old, middle and young people.
In terms of catering, the hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the quantity and quality of the food are much higher than other boutique hotels in the same price range. I personally feel that there are not enough categories to make up for it. Dining around the hotel is also very convenient. Japanese food, Jiangsu and Zhejiang cuisine, Xinjiang cuisine, and Western food are all available.
In terms of transportation, it is a 5-minute walk from the subway station. It is also very convenient to take a taxi, and it is not far from the scenic spot.

The service and hardware are shown in the pictures , but there are too many comments, but the service is really surprising. It may be because I haven‚Äôt returned to China for a long time. In my impression, the service level in China is still the same as before. I didn‚Äôt expect that every employee in this store, from the front desk to the cleaning aunt, has a very good attitude Well, when you see the guests, you will greet them cordially. In particular, there is an employee named Lucy (should remember correctly), who took care of us from check-in to departure the next day. Before leaving, he gave us special Hangzhou snacks for us to try on the way, thank you! It is worth mentioning that although the restaurant in the hotel is not big, and there are not many varieties of breakfast, but everything is delicious.

msg:I chose a lot of designer hotels, and finally put my hope on this Hangzhou Xinyu Hotel. As expected, this hotel has given us too many surprises. When a group of 10 of us were waiting at checkin, the waiter enthusiastically brought them afternoon tea, as well as freshly released green dumplings. Immediately I feel ten times better. The style of the entire hotel is a dark design style, with warmth in the cool tones. The room was also very nice and clean. There is a coffee machine and an integrated teapot (I bought a set of exactly the same style online after I came back, worth more than 200 yuan). The bed is also very comfortable, and there are four types of pillows for you to choose from. The table lamp with a strong sense of design is also suitable for reading and drinking tea when returning to the room.
We stayed for two nights in total. The long table in the lobby on the first floor is very suitable for afternoon tea activities for 10 of us. The hotel staff is also enthusiastic about making tea and coffee for us. The afternoon tea snacks are different every day. Made our three experience great. Next to it is the second-ranked restaurant in Hangzhou, and the price is very reasonable. The daily breakfast makes us linger, and it is basically Sam's quality. Because our train was in the afternoon and it was raining outside, we needed to stay in the hotel for more time. The hotel staff was also very enthusiastic and let us stay and have a rest and prepared tea. 10 of us enjoyed chatting and drinking tea at the hotel. When we left, we fell in love with Xinyu. Whenever we come to Hangzhou, we will definitely stay in this hotel again. Thanks to the hotel staff~~ for letting us experience the warmth of Hangzhou.

You can ask the staff for details, but the navigation cannot find the welfare, which shows that this road is blocked. As a result, we navigated to the hotel by ourselves and took the subway one stop ahead of schedule. Next week, we walked for almost 20 minutes with our bags on our backs;
The hotel service is very good, and they offered breakfast benefits. I didn't expect much from the breakfast. In fact, it was really good, and new products would be added from time to time, but the warming board was useless. The hotel's bread and snacks are basically produced by Sam. Afternoon tea, PIZZA, waffles, etc. will be provided in the afternoon; self-service coffee and tea are available all day, which is very heartwarming.

The breakfast is not bad, but the restaurant is small. On the first morning, there was a seat, and there were many people queuing up. In the end, we had to pack it up and take it back to the room. The next day we went to have breakfast at 8 o'clock, and the experience was good.
The coffee and snacks in the lobby are very good. Next to it is Zhiwei Restaurant. It is very convenient to go downstairs to eat

The location of the hotel is quiet, five minutes walk from the subway station, only one subway station away from Tianmuli, and only five subway stations away from the shopping mall, very convenient.

She said that this is different from what I saw online. It looks like an apar**ent hotel from the outside, not as described on Ctrip. . As a result, when I walked in, I felt different immediately, I felt very comfortable, and the procedures were completed quickly. After checking into the room, my daughter smelled a smell she liked very much and immediately fell in love with it again. The room was clean, well designed and felt quite spacious. There is a mountain in front of you, and it is indeed a mountain view room. There are four bottles of water in the room, two large and two small, which are very suitable for carrying. There are also many small bottles of water at the entrance on the first floor for guests to pick up on demand, which is very considerate and convenient. . In addition, what is special is that the room is also equipped with capsule coffee, which is suitable for those who like to drink coffee.
The overall feeling is full, I will go there next time.
PS: When I got home, I received a call saying that the headset was pulled into the room, and the lady at the front desk helped me send it back. very grateful üòò

But when I arrived, I was disappointed and it was not worth more than 600. First of all, the location is not easy to find, and it is not in the scenic area. It is on the side of the road. The door is like a guest house. Secondly, the elevator is broken and dirty. Finally, the rooms are of Hanting level, but they are not as clean as they are. The windows are stained and so are the carpets. The sofa is also not clean. In short, the whole feeling is not very clean and not refined, except for the good front desk service, others are not worth the price. Might as well go to the next hotel.

The only downside is that the location is a little bit quiet, but the travel is still a bit inconvenient. Suitable for friends who drive by car, but the subway is right away It will improve a lot if you pass it. Overall, I'm very satisfied.
