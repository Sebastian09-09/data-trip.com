msg:Loved the layout for the buildings outside the main hotel.  Only four rooms in each building with own private entry and balcony. The room I had was very clean and spacious.  All the "streets" are lined with lots of greenery and flowers.  It's a small resort but quaint. Great for taking walks early morning or early evening in the streets and along footpaths. The buffet breakfast was great and the restaurant very easy to find. The restaurant and front desk (main hotel) are all walking distance.  The surrounding lake is beautiful and peaceful. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The hotel provides shuttle bus to the recreational park and the entree fee is not very expensive. The room is big and clean. I will prefer to take breakfast in the upper floor to enjoy the amazing view.

Hygiene: OK
Environment: The environment is good, and it is really healthy.
Service: Not very good, check-in may not be in advance due to holidays. There is no housekeeper or anything after check-in, just come by yourself. It is equivalent to no service after check-in
Hotel catering: I had lunch there at noon, there are only two sets of meals, and there are few dishes to order.

msg:1. Let's talk about the advantages first. The scenery is beautiful. As a resort built 10 years ago, the lawns and green plants are well maintained.

2. The service level is poor. The only good review is for the front desk. The curtains in the bathroom of the original room were damaged, and they offered to help us change rooms. The other one is for the restaurant staff. The service level is very good, timely and enthusiastic.

The quality of other personnel is not good. One is the shuttle bus driver. Is the hotel shuttle bus a bus? Is there a fixed parking platform? We stood at the annual card service center less than 20 meters away from the customer service center mentioned by the driver. We waved to him but no response. After we got on the bus, he blamed us and incited other passengers to say why we didn't wait for the next bus.

Another one is the female staff member of the golf experience center. At that time, we had already checked out, and my friend arrived at the experience hall before us. The front desk forgot to write the deadline on the experience card. She immediately asked the guests to go to the hotel front desk to make up the date. My friend said at the time, why should the customers bear the internal mistakes of yours? Obviously, you can communicate internally, so she reluctantly called and confirmed with the front desk. After we arrived, we gave her our experience card, and we used the center of the table nearby. She just kept watching from the side, and I don't know what expression she had. If we affected your internal customers, you could have communicated with us at the beginning to move to the inner position and leave the central position to the golf center's own customers, instead of putting on a contemptuous look. I don't know where this inexplicable sense of superiority comes from? Is it the sense of superiority that you have finally left your hometown and landed in the provincial capital?

In a word, such low-quality service level and personnel quality are not worthy of such a beautiful scenery!

After reading online reviews, I thought it was just average. I was too tired and decided to book a hotel. Let's take a rest in the room. It seems that we made the right decision this time. The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic and introduced a lot when checking in. The room is quite satisfactory and looks average. The decoration is a bit old-fashioned, but the room is still very clean. Breakfast is provided. It is a simple meal, but the portion is sufficient and the taste is very good (noodles are recommended); the surrounding scenery is beautiful and worth taking pictures.

When I arrived at the hotel, my first impression was that the reception hall was not so grand and the floor was a bit low. It was different from the urban hotel I stayed in before. This is true, but I still have to admit that it is fresh and clean. The beautiful woman at the front desk was also very enthusiastic. She introduced us to the breakfast time, the opening hours of the amu*****t park and their special golf course. It seems that the service is not as bad as the reviews said. Character, character [Âë≤Âë≤] Enter the room , the air conditioner is turned on in advance, and the area is large enough. The room I stayed in also has two small sofas. The overall color of the room is relatively dark, but it does not affect my liking (the light-colored log style is now common in fast hotel chains) One, let‚Äôs figure out the value.) I specifically observed the floors, walls, and so on. They are all quite new. The view of the lake in the breakfast room is great. If you take a photo of the scenery outside, it will be a landscape painting. I don‚Äôt know why I commented. Not a high score. The overall feeling is that it is cost-effective and highly recommended! Why do I feel like I am a quality inspector, hahahahaha

msg:The Chinese food in this hotel is very delicious! Simple dishes can also be done beautifully. In particular, the staff and managers of the Chinese restaurant are very dedicated and polite to the guests. It is recommended that friends in Jiangning come here for a dinner party!
This hotel offers great value for money! Free tickets to the amu*****t park, very affordable. The amu*****t park is nice.
The environment here is very beautiful, and the natural resources of Ginkgo Lake are very good.
The location here is far away from the city, and few guests come. Even on Saturday night, there are almost no people, so it is very quiet and is a good place for a niche vacation.
The room-related service here is poor. The staff are good at using rhetorical questions. I almost felt embarrassed to bother them, but the weather was too cold and the heating did not work at first. Three hours later. If it weren't for Ctrip's help, I would have stayed in a different star hotel.
There are very few customers here, so the staff is insufficient. The people facing customers are the most ordinary sanitation staff. I understand that they don't want us to come here and cause trouble. After all, they are not trained in hotel customer service. I also asked them for a heater. I was really sorry. Would it occupy the heater and make their staff freeze?
The hardware conditions here are generally good, the villas are well built, and the trees and landscape inside are pretty good! You can drive in, which is very convenient! But the facilities are old. I changed rooms and found that the coffee tables in the two rooms were not level. Not an exception.
The front lobby is not good. It feels like a farmhouse. There is only one staff member. There is no bathroom in the front lobby and there is no necessary hardware. It is definitely not up to the quality of a star hotel!
Overall, half good and half bad. As a farmhouse and B&B hotel, it is excellent, but it is seriously inconsistent with Ctrip's five-star or above star hotels!

1. Objective evaluation, the surrounding environment of the hotel is very early, on the edge of Ginkgo Lake, the room is a single-family villa, as if living in a park;
2. The hotel facilities are relatively old, the room has a musty smell, the buffet breakfast has few choices, and the taste is average;
3. The sanitation of the room is average, with obvious dust accumulation;
4. The most unbearable thing is the water quality. This is Nanjing. The hotel is located in Jiangning District, which has the largest production value in Nanjing. Ginkgo Lake is just outside the door, and the Yangtze River is next to it. How can there be such water quality? ? ? ! ! ! The water released is yellow and full of impurities. I am used to brushing my teeth with cold water, and the tap water released is also full of impurities. I didn‚Äôt know it at first, and I boiled a pot of hot water to drink it, but I couldn‚Äôt spit it out. I‚Äôm busy with my children and don‚Äôt have time. I‚Äôm going to call the consumer this week to make a complaint.

When I turned on the lights, the bloody mosquitoes on the wall were beaten more than 10 times. It was unbearable at 3:00, so I called the front desk and sent it over. Mosquito coil and toilet water.
I have stayed in the hotel with the worst hygienic environment, and the barren mountains and mountains are not as good.

The environment is nice, private and quiet. Each building has three floors and 6 rooms in total. It is very convenient to recommend self-driving, and the car can be nearby Free parking next to the villa where you live (parking in the amu*****t park is 8 yuan per time)
The check-in at the front desk is very fast, and then just drive to the corresponding area. The staff turned on the air conditioner for us in advance and it was very warm as soon as we entered the door. The first impression was pretty good. The room is large in size and has a large balcony, but it is not equipped Tables and chairs, if you can sit on the balcony chairs and drink tea to feel the tranquility in other warm seasons, it is a good highlight
The room facilities are quite satisfactory. If you have a bathtub and want to take a bath, you can buy a disposable bathtub bag, which is more hygienic. The noise of the air conditioner is a bit like that of a range hood. I didn't sleep well. This is crazy, I hope it can be improved
The breakfast is pretty good, the taste is good, the variety is enough, and the environment is not bad
There is still a distance between the hotel and the amu*****t park. It is most convenient to drive by yourself, or you can take a shuttle bus to and fro. The tickets in the package are unlimited entry and exit within 2 days
In the park, I prefer natural scenery areas, feeding small animals, quiet and healing, there is a continuous 8-minute fireworks show at night, it is really beautiful and worth watching

msg:Facilities: The hotel next to Ginkgo Lake Amusement Park. I live in Zone D. The external environment of the hotel is good. But the actual feeling of the room is a little old, one of the wall tiles in the bathroom is hollow, and I am a little worried that it will fall. In addition, the shower in the bathroom is loose and loose, barely usable, and the temperature adjus**ent is not sensitive. The water in the dehumidifier when I entered the door was almost full, and I poured it out myself.

Hygiene: Staying on the first floor, the suite is very large. The biggest problem is that there are too many mosquitoes. Even if you turn on the electric mosquito coil before going to bed, you will still be woken up by mosquito bites in the middle of the night.

Environment: The external environment is not bad, the feeling of a single-family villa, the car parks directly at the door, and the parking is quite convenient

Service: Generally speaking, there is no surprise feeling, and the guidance from check-in to the room can be done better. In addition, it is best to have someone guide you to queue up when you take the hotel electric car from the entrance of Ginkgo Lake Paradise at night. Now it is basically relying on grabbing.

If we two girls don't lock it, it won't ring me at that time? ? ? ? (It was more than 11 o'clock at that time) Then I asked Ctrip customer service to change a room in the middle of the night, but all the supplies in the new room were only one copy.

The sound of rumbling is unpleasant, and it is difficult to guarantee even the most basic sleep services. At this time, if you ask the front desk, you will only say sorry. Why didn't you remind it when you opened the room? It is also dedicated to the third floor, and the elevator is also broken. The key is that all the standard rooms face north, and you can only go to the big bed room on the south side. The elderly and children have to get up and pack their luggage. I walked around the park until 5:00 in the morning and found that even some of the air conditioners in the villa area were rumbling. We also found something like the picture below under our room. Alas, other hot water should be put in the old meeting, and the bath is hot and cold. Not to mention the inequality and so on. Talking to comfort is that it is convenient to go to the amu*****t park.

msg:Now that the epidemic situation is a little more serious, I dare not take my children out of Nanjing to play, so I just want to go to the surrounding areas of Nanjing to play on weekends. When I saw Ginkgo Lake Paradise, I booked this hotel in the surrounding area.
I was still a little apprehensive after seeing many reviews of the hotel before. After coming here, I was quite surprised.
The villa mountain view room we booked is not in the same room as the hotel's standard room. The villa area and the check-in front desk are not in the same building, but it's okay, not too far.
There are lake view rooms and mountain view rooms in the villa area. The lake view room is next to the lake. I looked at it, and when I opened the window, I should be able to see the lake at a glance. The mountain view room I booked is next to the lake view room, and I can't see the lake, but it's a bit like entering a small forest, which is full of tall trees, which is quite a feeling.
The day we came was Saturday, 12.11, it was cloudy, it rained at night, and the next day was wet everywhere.
The mountain view room of the villa is in a villa. A villa has 3 floors. We are on the third floor this time, which is the top floor. When you enter the door by swiping the card, it is all on the floor, with a sofa and a balcony. The sliding door opens to the balcony. You can see the mountain outside.
The toilet is very large, the dry and wet are separated, and there are two sinks, so that two people can brush their teeth and wash their faces at the same time. The toilet toilet is smart, with heating. There is also a long large bathtub.
There are two central air conditioners, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The air conditioner is quite powerful, and in a few degrees of weather outside, you can wear a single t-shirt inside.
The only downside I saw in the comment area is that there are really too few charging sockets, which may be related to the decoration of the villa. There are very few places reserved for charging. If you want to charge while lying on the bed, you must With a wiring board, I brought a 1 meter 5 wiring board, which is probably just right, so I can play and charge my phone while lying on the bed.
Then there are indeed a little more bugs, but it doesn't affect my satisfaction with him in this room. At the price of 899, I think it's okay to send Ginkgo Lake Park tickets, after all, it's still a weekend.
I sent breakfast for 2 people, and there is no charge for children who do not have 1.2 meters. It is a buffet-style breakfast, then duck blood vermicelli soup, wontons, and noodles. These three items are ordered with the waiter. If you want, she will order it for you and deliver it to you. Other soy milk, milk, mango juice, bread, cookies, bacon, ham, eggs, hash browns are all self-fetched. I think it's worth it if it is included in the room fee, but if you pay 68 per person by yourself, it's not worth it, and it's not worth it.
Overall, I am still satisfied. I will come again next time and live in a lake view room.

I hope this can be improved. The advantage is that the room hygiene and service attitude are not bad. There are shuttle buses in the morning and evening to go to the park area, but it takes a long time to get back for a taxi. It is recommended to walk not far by yourself. The breakfast is very rich, which I like very much. Overall, the price is slightly higher on holidays, and will consider staying again.

msg:We went by taxi. When the driver stopped at the hotel gate, I looked at it and asked in confusion if this was the hotel gate? I really can't tell it's the gate of the resort hotel. I showed my ID and checked in. Because there were very few people on the 30th, I checked us in after 10:00 in the morning. The lady at the front desk has a very good service. I chose the villa üè° Mountain View King Room, thinking that I can see the mountains , it turned out to be a house surrounded by bushes, the stairs were on the second floor, it was very humid, and the musty smell was a bit strong when the door was opened, and the children said it smelled bad as soon as they entered, open the balcony door, only the bushes can be seen outsideüòÑ, all It's mosquitoes and antsüêúDon't open the balcony door‚ö†Ô∏èThere is no activity at night, it's dark, only the faint light of the street lamp, you can't see itüôàLooking up at the sky, it's beautiful, the stars in the sky are really beautiful, in the city Can't see how beautiful it is! Let's talk about eating, because the park is closed at 5 o'clock (5 o'clock on non-holidays, 8 o'clock on holidays), the children are too tired to fall asleep after playing for a day. At 7 o'clock, they go to the front desk to ask the restaurant, they can only go to the nearby farmhouse, and they will also 2 kilometers, we didn't have a car, so we couldn't go there, we couldn't get a taxi, and the store didn't deliver. In the end, we had to choose a few biscuits that children can eat from the vending machine in the hotel lobby. I made do and fell asleep. In the middle of the night, the children were bitten by insectsüêõmosquitoü¶ü, and they dared not sleep because of crying. We brought the sheets ourselves, and the quilt cover did not use their quilt. I also sprayed them with mosquito repellent before going to bed. After tossing a few times, it finally dawned. Before 7 o'clock, I got up and packed up and went to breakfast. The breakfast was not bad and there were many kinds! After dinner, go back to the room to pick up our luggageüß≥We only stayed on the 30th for one night, so now we have to pack our luggage and put it at the front desk. The villa area we live in is a long way from the front desk. When we checked in, he brought us to our room. Let me answer the phone, but yesterday I called someone to answer, but this morning I couldn't answer the call, so I asked myself to go to the hotel lobby, we two children, and the suitcase, the children didn't want to walk with them üòì I went to the front desk and said to sit and pick up The shuttle bus went to the park, it turned out that the park opened at 9 o'clock, they started to deliver at 9 o'clock, there are still 15 minutes, I thought to get there early üòì We walked there by ourselves, my brother hugged, my brother didn't want to go, stop and go The stop has finally arrived, and there are already many people at the gate. Today is the first day of the National Day holiday on the 1st, and you can enter the park just by walking there! The overall experience this time is not very good, and you have to drive here by yourself, or it is not too inconvenient üò≠

msg:The hotel‚Äôs fire safety has major safety hazards and, check in 7.10, 2 adults, 2 children, 7.11 in the morning when the child is 3 years old when playing in the room, the room wall tiles fell and hit the child‚Äôs face, causing 2 blood stains. Falling from a higher place and hitting it, the consequences can be imagined. The hotel dodges the person in charge not on the same day. After the front desk phone relayed the promise of compensation, it has not fulfilled the obligation of compensation so far. In the case of the child's injury has not healed, he has asked to sign a one-time compensation agreement. The leader did not give feedback after the report, was extremely dissatisfied with responsibility, selfish, and inconsistent. In desperation, the situation and information have been fed back to the industry and commerce depar**ent, and the media has been contacted for exposure; where is the personal safety of our consumers in the resort hotel with such a huge safety hazard? Is this inconsistent handling of such delays a common problem in the hotel industry? Please learn from other residents.

msg:I took my children to Ginkgo Lake Paradise with my friends and booked two rooms. The villa is generally good and relatively clean. It was raining at noon. I wanted to order a simple meal from the hotel, but it was a pity that there was no service to deliver the meal to the room. There are not many varieties of breakfast, so it‚Äôs basically enough to eat. Win in the environment and win by the lake view.

msg:This hotel deserves a good review, because this is the worst experience I have ever stayed in a hotel of the same price. Let's talk about the room first. The sanitary condition is worrying. The sofa is full of stains when you enter the door. Can't you change the sofa cover? There were melon seed husks beside the bed, the floor was stained, the floor was not cleaned carefully, and there were paper towels in the shower. When it comes to the shower room, the hot water in the bathtub cannot be turned on at the same time. In addition, the water is small and the toilet space is large. It is very easy for children to catch a cold when taking a bath. Besides, you need to find the room yourself. The signs were not clear, so I searched for a long time; besides, the restaurant was obviously understaffed, and the staff told us that we would have to wait for an hour for dinner. Knowing that the location here is too far, where should we go to eat! Breakfast too, food was not well prepared and the plate was empty and not replenished. Finally, about the location, although the hotel is next to the playground, you still have to drive there, because there are not many shuttle buses, and it takes a long time to wait for a lot of people. It is recommended that you do not book this hotel because it is close, it is not related at all.

The service is good, breakfast is rich, Chinese and Western food are available, and the surrounding environment is very beautiful. Disadvantages: The lobby of the hotel is very small, and the decoration in the room is old and simple, similar to a fast hotel. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is somewhat low, but the main reasons for bringing children to play are convenience, good environment, rich breakfast, and the price is acceptable.

The old screen of the air conditioner is flickering, and there is no response when pressing it. , I didn‚Äôt sit down for a while, and I wanted to check out. The store‚Äôs business is probably not good, and the order for 3 days will not be refunded for one day. No matter what your reason is, unscrupulous merchants, how much money can they cheat with such services and equipment?
