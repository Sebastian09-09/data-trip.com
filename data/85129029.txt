msg:The service is really good. As soon as I entered the door, someone greeted me and guided me. The front desk staff also helped me press the elevator and smiled the whole time. It was so heartwarming. The environment is also impeccable. The decoration is luxurious, the sound insulation is also good, it is spacious and comfortable, and it feels like living in a palace. I want to bring my friends to experience it together

It is Chris**as🈷️, and the festive decoration a**osphere is very good. The service staff is very enthusiastic and willing to provide various help. The breakfast is rich.
The facilities are very user-friendly, the network high-speed signal is good, and the scenery outside the window is good. The overall stay experience is great, and I will stay there next time

The pillows and quilts are also very comfortable. Chris**as is coming soon, and there is a Chris**as tree in the lobby, which creates a nice a**osphere.

The room window faces the Yangtze River, basking in the sun, looking at the river view, relaxing and comfortable. In addition, the service of the front desk lady is warm and worth recommending.

msg:The room is spacious and bright, with a large panoramic window that allows you to take in the entire container port and the Yangtze River. The window makes you feel relaxed and happy, and you can sleep quietly and comfortably at night, and you can sleep all night. The bathroom is fully intelligent, with a fully automatic toilet, a large smart makeup mirror, a dry and wet separated shower room, and a large European-style bathtub. You can take a flower bath when you are tired. A full-length fitting mirror at the entrance gives beauty-loving ladies a sense of security. The room is equipped with a set of European-style sofas, and the mattress is very comfortable, with moderate hardness and softness. I like the overall style of the hotel very much, and the service is in place. I will stay there again next time.

msg:This time I came on a business trip nearby and wanted to find a comfortable hotel. I was attracted by its decoration style at first sight. The front desk is behind the murals. All the floors are basically carpeted, which is very luxurious. The guest room is what I want, relatively quiet and comfortable. I asked the front desk. It is not far from the center of Wuhan and there is a subway line. I will consider booking this hotel when I bring my family to Wuhan later.

There is a golden painting in the lobby, which is very suitable for people like me who check in everywhere. The hotel front desk is also very warm and attentive. There are foreign staff who help me take my luggage upstairs. The room is very spacious and comfortable, and the bedding is very comfortable. I want to buy a hotel pillow to take home. It is very friendly to insomniacs like me. There is also a buffet dinner on the second floor. The a**osphere is very good. Next time I will come back to experience their Western meal set. It is quite cost-effective to see that there are activities on ** and **. Overall, it is highly recommended.

msg:The room is new and clean.
Other buildings in this area have not been completed yet, so the environment is a little worse.
The service is average and the price/performance ratio is not high. I chose the free exchange upgrade room type, but it was not upgraded when I checked in. Maybe because there are few guests, breakfast is a list for self-selection, which is acceptable.
Because it is a newly opened hotel, the facilities are OK, electric curtains, smart toilets.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is very poor, and it is not worth the price even in first-tier cities.

msg:The whole hotel is decorated in a magnificent European style.
There is a large painting on the wall of the hotel lobby. With curiosity and appreciation of art, I got closer and found that this large painting was actually three-dimensional, which made people feel like they were there.
The front desk lady checked in very quickly. Her sunny smile sprinkled on my face, warming my slightly tired heart, making me more determined to make the right choice of this hotel.
The room is really spacious. The bathtub in the room makes me like and worry. I like the pleasure of calming down when taking a bath, and I worry that I am afraid that I will be immersed in this pleasure and can't extricate myself.
What surprised me was that the toilet in the room was smart, VERY GOOD.
Through the huge window of the room, the scenery outside the window came into view, and it was unobstructed. The sunset was reflected on the winding Yangtze River. Under the many container accessories of the port, it was "beautiful".
If there is a chance, I will still choose this hotel next time I come to Yangluo, bringing my family and my friends.

msg:I happened to be having a meeting here in Yangluo. I searched and found only this newly opened restaurant. I thought the environment should be pretty good, so I booked it directly~
Facilities: Newly opened hotels are different, all kinds of facilities are very new, the air conditioner is also fully turned on, such as smart toilets are equipped, and the bed is very comfortable;
Hygiene: It's pretty clean. Although the room is carpeted, it's well maintained and won't feel dirty;
Environment: You can see the majestic Yangluo Port outside the window, which is really shocking! The port + river view is really amazing!
Service: The service staff at the front desk are quite enthusiastic, and the check-in speed is also very fast. They even asked if they need to take the luggage back to the room, and the cleaning aunts they met on the way also took the initiative to say hello~
Overall, it meets the expectations of this price. I didn’t expect that such a good hotel can be booked in a place so far away from the center of Wuhan. It will be very nice to receive customers in the future~

The short-haired lady at the front desk was very professional. I like it manually. The room was clean and quiet. The toilet was very smart and opened automatically when you approached it. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant were exquisite and delicious (unfortunately I forgot to take pictures), and the service was also great
