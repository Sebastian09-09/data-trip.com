msg:We left with full expectations for the hotel, but the weather was not good, it was foggy everywhere, and the visibility had to be five meters. The starry sky, the distant mountains, and the sunrise that we promised were all not seen. It was very strange. Very sorry. Because it is the off-season, there are very few tourists, and many facilities in the scenic area are not open, making it inconvenient to eat. The girl at the front desk of the hotel is very enthusiastic and considerate. The bathtub in the room is very comfortable, the toilet is also very smart, and the room is super large. However, the bed is too hard and it is not very comfortable to sleep on. For a hotel at this price, it is recommended to change to a latex mattress:) This hotel is suitable for a family to relax. But you must choose the right time, otherwise you won’t be able to see anything, which is a pity

msg:The room is nice and the view is very good, but the service is not up to par. The staff has no sense of service at all. The unreasonable attitude of the security guard at the door makes people uncomfortable. The license plate number has been registered in advance, but the security guard seems to have no idea and responds very rudely, as if we are strangers waiting to break in. Check-in is quite fast, and the housekeeper also helps to take the luggage to the room. But such a high-end hotel does not have ironing facilities, and there is not even a cup, let alone welcome fruits and tea. Is this the real reason for the name Fang Xia Yun Ju? Let go of all needs, no need for service 😂 Let's talk about food and beverage. I went to the restaurant at about 7 o'clock in the evening to order food. There was only one table of guests eating, but the waiting time was a bit too long. And there are few choices. The menu is the same at noon and night. The meat dishes are very salty, the vegetarian dishes are very oily, and the level of cooking is not as good as the farmhouse outside. At least improve it. After all, your hotel is so beautiful and has such a good scenery. Can't you provide matching services with snacks to make guests live more comfortably? Breakfast is also a Chinese buffet, there is nothing to choose from. If you are worried about waste, you can make an appoin**ent the night before and provide it in the form of a set meal. You don't give people room for choice at this grassroots level. It's just wild plums, and there are no other choices nearby. Aren't you forcing it on customers? It really lowers the standard of the entire hotel. I wanted to order a coffee in the afternoon, and the boy at the front desk was surprised and impatient. He repeated several times that we only provide coffee in the morning, meaning that coffee should only be drunk in the morning. If you want it at other times, it's the customer's fault. This is the first time I heard such words from a high-quality hotel service staff, and I really wanted to laugh. Fortunately, the girl at the front desk helped to contact the restaurant sister to make a cup in the end. I didn't expect that one day drinking coffee would be a luxury. It seems that I have to bring a full set of rice cookers and rice when I come to stay next time, because the rice is too bad and has a very slag taste.

msg:I haven't had time to make a serious review, but I still took time out of my busy schedule today because the service the hotel gave me is really worthy of a thumbs up👍.
Because we were traveling with a one-and-a-half-year-old baby, it was really difficult. The hotel has been actively contacting me since I called them to confirm the reservation, reminding and repeatedly confirming our arrival time and method, and going to the high-speed rail station to pick us up.
We arrived at the hotel earlier than the check-in time, but because the room was available, the hotel let me check in immediately and did not let us wait.
It rained on the day of arrival, making it inconvenient to travel, and the hotel helped us order food (there was only one food delivery nearby), so we also had delicious meals in this hotel. Anyway, there was also a hotel car to take us to the restaurant for dinner, and after dinner, they took us back to the hotel, which was great.
After we checked out the next day, the hotel also sent us to the scenic spot. The most important thing is that after we came out of the scenic spot, the hotel also took our clothes lost in the room and the luggage stored in the hotel to pick us up, and sent us to the high-speed rail station. Because I didn’t buy tickets in advance, the lady also took us to find someone to buy tickets, which really helped a lot. Otherwise, we would miss that high-speed train and wait for a few hours for the next one.
The facilities of the hotel are very advanced and practical. In short, I feel that not a penny is spent in vain. It is a very pleasant experience. I think I should come once in winter and enjoy the fireplace!
By the way, because I brought my children, the hotel also took the initiative to contact us to help us with our luggage and picked us up and sent us back to the room many times. It was really touching. Thanks to all the staff for their care☺️

One day it was more than 10 degrees and I needed to thicken my clothes. The air is good and the negative oxygen ions are high. It would be great if we could meet the sunrise, but unfortunately we didn’t, and lost... But rainy days also have a special flavor, misty, rainy and misty. It is very close to the ancient town of Zhusha. To go to the ancient town, you will be picked up by the car in the store. You can also pick up the hotel from the high-speed railway station in the ancient town for free. The service is good, and the design of the hotel is also very unique. The humidity is heavy all year round and there will be some old and humid. It is not a complete five-star standard, but it is worth a visit. If you want to go, choose a good weather.

Before check-in, the hotel will call to add WeChat, if you drive here, you will pre-register the car number, and parking is free. The only pity is that during the holiday, there was a group of people who came to visit (the specific identity is unknown), and they reserved the restaurant and tea room that night. Ordinary guests can't eat in the hotel. After a tiring day, they don't want to go down the mountain to eat. The experience is greatly reduced. Later, I contacted the staff added on WeChat and helped to order takeout. I especially thank her.

After ordering, the boss will deliver the food to the room. The home-cooked dishes I ordered are also very good, and they are spicy. The breakfast is also very rich, with many different dishes. The minced meat vermicelli is super Great. And the hotel provides pick-up and drop-off, which can be picked up to the high-speed rail station. The master also chatted with us warmly on the way. The fly in the oin**ent is that we went in March, the mountains were so foggy that we couldn't see the scenery clearly, it was a vast expanse of whiteness. Overall, it's still worth a visit!

msg:環境一流的度假酒店，房間寬敞，景觀效果一流 ，強力推薦住2天，放鬆休閑，附近的“那個年代”一條街和地下長城礦洞都值得遊覽。躺在酒店床上可看山谷雲捲雲舒，非常愜意。唯一有點的遺憾是酒店早餐簡單，不太配得上酒店的高端奢華定位。

msg:環境：私人無邊懸崖泳池，超大的露台，和觀光沙發，面對無敵山景，耳邊是鳥鳴啾啾，特別適合泡一壺清茶看夕陽。可謂環境絕絕子，絲毫不亞於莫幹山裸心谷。
房型：2室2衞1廳很適合兩家人居住，我們和父母五口人一家一套互不打擾。如果是兩户一家三口入住也是沒問題的。
設施：之前看點評説的晚餐自助餐沒有了，需要乘車前往山下吃。吃完飯回來健身房烏漆麻黑跑步機的電線都是拔掉的。游泳池水很涼，8月初幾乎無法下水。早餐差到極點，有圖有真相，種類很少，且我們8:30到達的時候很多盤已經空了沒有人添加。沙拉沒有，咖啡也沒有。問了好幾句，服務員才不情願的用咖啡機給我做了一杯純咖，我問奶和糖呢？理直氣壯的跟我説：奶在那邊自己去倒（就是放在早餐枱的大奶壺），糖沒有（開玩笑嗎？廚房也沒有糖嗎？）最後我的早餐衹有那麼一點點種類，畢竟早上很少人吃炒菜的。
服務：這裏我必須要吐槽幾句。首先入住時前台忘記查核酸記錄，在我們第二天一早退房要趕往機場時要一個個查，時間本來就緊張，弄的很狼狽。其次我們入住的房間是要贈送附近硃砂古鎮的套票的，沒人提，我都退房了才想起來。服務實在和這麼貴的房價太不匹配。相比之下，開電瓶車的師傅服務特別好，送我們去吃飯的路上主動給我們講小鎮的歷史，建議我們吃哪家餐廳，他推薦的百味軒真的很好吃又實惠，特別感謝！
如果問我還會不會來住，我説沖環境是要來的，但沖服務不想再來。

msg:酒店的自然環境跟攜程上看到的圖片是基本一致的，然而，作為一個度假酒店，無論是設施還是服務，是完全不合格的，尤其是服務，我不得不送出人生的第一個差評！
這是為週年紀念特意訂的一個酒店，可以説，是帶着美好的心情前往酒店的。下午4點左右抵達酒店，進入房間後，先是發現陽台的泡池臟得嚇人，致電前台，要求打掃，前台女生不解釋衞生問題反而強調説泡池是另收費的，我以為收費是因為泡池水源是有什麼特別吧，一問之下衹是普通自來水啊，而且池子（普通泡池一個，衹有1.5平方左右大小）本來就是房間的一部分，我們預訂時也沒有註明池子需要另收費啊，前台女生沒有解釋收費的理由就衹是一直重複説“池子就是要另外收費的”～然後，電話一頭突然轉成一位男生了，跟我們説池子不用收費，我們心想怎麼收不收費可以這樣隨意切換的，也不多説了，就讓他們派人來搞衞生吧。搞衞生的阿姨來了，站在門口，連池子也沒看一眼就説那是水垢，洗不掉的～一翻脣舌之後才又折回去拿清洗工具。觀摩完房間，打算上個洗手間吧，一拉開洗手間玻璃門，一股濃烈的尿騷味撲面而來，我跟阿姨反應問題，阿姨頭也不抬跟我説“跟前台説吧”，我再次拿起電話～又一個阿姨來了，嘟嚷着去洗手間搞衞生了，然後，房間有點暗，打算把床頭的枱燈打開吧，又發現兩個燈都擰不亮，再次致電前台，隨後，洗手間阿姨的對講機響了，大概就是讓她幫我們看看燈是怎麼回事吧，對講機裏言語之間好像説得我們就是連燈也不會開的客人了，呵呵，我們就當沒聽到了，然後，阿姨也開不了，對講機一陣嘰裏呱啦的叫來了電工師傅，然後，兩位阿姨一位師傅就在我們房間裏進進出出的做着他們應該在客人入住前就處理的工作，時間轉眼過去快兩小時了，燈還是沒有修好，床頭裝按鈕的木板也撬開了～我再次致電前台，問是否可以換個房間，可是不出所料，前台女生給出的是標準答案：不好意思，房間今天都滿了。我忍了，繼續等，繼續看着幾個人在我們花2000多住一晚的房間進進出出（房間下面就是房子的水電設備房吧，師傅為了檢查線路需要不停進出），2小時前引我們進房間的小哥還提醒山區蚊蟲多、記得要隨手關好紗門～然而，因為搞衞生因為維修工作，我們房間一直處於開放狀態。眼看天黑了，維修檢查工作還在繼續，我突然想起，我也好歹是攜程的鑽石客户啊，於是拔通了攜程的客服專線如實反應問題，終於，在攜程的介入下，10分鐘後，搞衞生的阿姨通知我們可以換房了，那時候，我們寶貴的度假時間已經過去兩個多小時，本來計劃先睡個午覺，然後起床拍照的美好計劃全部落空！最後，換了房型是一模一樣的房間，可見，他們所説的“房間全滿了”就是鬼話！
大概也是攜程介入的原因吧，酒店後來有一個穿着圓領汗衫的中年男人帶着個女侍應捧來了兩份水果和帶着糊味的綠豆沙糖水，出於禮貌不想讓人難堪，我接下了，但後來基本原封不動讓阿姨拿走了。
新換的房間，帶着好久沒人入住的“荒涼”味道，尤其是陽台上的木板，室外的座椅，是全部沒有墊子的，而且明顯積層了，洗手間內其中一個洗手盆是帶裂紋的，配套毛巾不齊全～但是，我們已經衹想將就着過完這一晚了，畢竟，出遊時間如此寶貴，已經再不想浪費了。

酒店的自然環境還是如圖片一樣真實的，如果你衹想要自然環境，可以忍受沒有服務（酒店午餐晚餐均沒有任何餐飲提供，更別指望什麼大堂吧咖啡吧之類了），前台的女生男生，看起來都是剛畢業而且連專業培訓也沒接受過的本地小朋友。真的，你面對這樣的“工作人員”，是根本有理無處説的，也沒法指望他們能提供什麼專業服務，這也是我一開始為什麼不得不“忍受”着不專業服務的原因。酒店雖然説位於硃砂古鎮風景區內，但整個風景區甚至硃砂古鎮，都是一派荒涼凋零的感覺。

附上3張圖片，衹為方便大家腦補一下我以上的經歷。衹能説，沒有相應的配套和服務，是不能稱之為度假酒店的。即使沒有上面的經歷，我也不會再去了。
