There is also a bath, which is also very exquisite.

Hygiene: Clean and tidy, the room attendant is very enthusiastic, the room I stayed in at the beginning had a floor drain and smelled bad, but it was fine after changing to another room!
Environment: The breakfast variety is relatively rich, there is a bright counter, the hot dishes are heavy, there was a wedding that day, the hotel was quite lively, the facade was grand, and parking and access were convenient.
Location: Because it is not in the city center, the price is not high, and the cost performance is very good! Self-driving is recommended!

There was also a sofa in the room for rest. I didn't have breakfast. My husband said that you can't find this level at this price in our place. But it may be a distance from Changchun Station.

I booked a king-size bed room, but there was a bed frame for an extra bed opposite the bed. The front desk impatiently changed the room. The new room was not bad, but the hygiene was too average. There were hairs in the big bathtub. It was disgusting. It was also weird that someone asked you for a deposit in this era.

We went out for a day and no one cleaned the room when we came back. When I asked for the Wi-Fi password, I provided the wrong password. It was wrong for a long time, and they blamed us for the wrong input. It was embarrassing 😳 The overall experience was not good, and it was far from the city.

msg:The location is a bit off, but the environment is really good. We stayed together for three days. The first day was arranged by the travel agency, and we stayed for two more days. The travel agency was very bad. They took us to all the self-funded attractions. If we didn't go, we would stay in the car. Once we got on the car, we were asked to pay 1,200 yuan per person. I was very dissatisfied. Don't sign up for a tour group when you go to the Northeast. The only thing I was satisfied with was the accommodation on the first night. It was a five-star hotel with a good environment and a cheap price, so we stayed for two more nights. I didn't take photos. The room was very spacious and the facilities were new. There were two 1.35-meter beds, which were enough for a family of four. There was free parking. The slippers and disposable toothbrushes were better than those in other big hotels. I was very satisfied with the stay. I will consider staying in this hotel again when I come to Changchun in the future.

msg:一次令人無語、氣憤、大開眼界的體驗！攜程上下的訂單，款預付給攜程，攜程負責開發票！退房時，按公司要求去開個水單，按以往的經驗，都是絲滑的很，沒想到大早上就碰個大釘子！前台業務素質低下，説按規定這種不給開，又説看不到我在攜程的價格，給它們看了我手機上訂單的價格，也是不能開！叫來了一個所謂的經理，也是一套説辭，説水單上寫不了價格，要不就寫他們實收的攜程的錢！我就想説，我不管在哪兒下的單，通過的什麼途徑，是不是在你們家住了，是不是你們給我辦的入住和退房，水單不是發票，衹是證明我入住的一個流水賬而已！至於你和攜程的事不用跟我説，你不知道價格，可以問攜程，況且我也讓他們看了我的訂單。按我實際定單開個水單居然比登天還難！後來當地企業主管，在他們那兒有會員卡，還認識，好説歹説，開了，又不給蓋章，我説不用什麼發票章或者公章，衹要是你們酒店隨便哪個部門的章都可以。傀儡般的前台又打電話請示，然後才蓋了一個前廳部的章。期間一個面目猙獰的女服務員還試圖要和我吵架！從前台到經理，均業務素質低下，不合格上崗，態度惡略，沒有處理和解決問題的能力！酒店規定和流程大錯特錯，服務員還以為他們家的規定是聯合國憲章，以此抵賴！對我的正當訴求，衹是按我實際訂單開個水單居然百般刁難，層層請示，體現了無知，愚昧，傲慢！真是應了那句話，投資不過山海關，東北人才外流嚴重，從上到下，官僚主義盛行，這家酒店的管理又很好的詮釋了這些論點，充當了一次反面的形象代表！奉勸大家儘量少去這種地方！
