msg:An older hotel in Wudalianchi, the room is very large, the curtains are like a big curtain, you can run from the window to the door, but the layout is not reasonable and there is a smell. When I first checked in, they gave me a fruit plate and upgraded my room. I wanted to give a good review, but this hotel has some fatal problems, which may be insignificant to the hotel, but this is why Northeast hotels can never get it right. The room had a whole window glass cracked, but it was still usable at the moment, and the mirror light in the room bathroom was also broken. After reporting to the front desk, the hotel's attitude was that there was no big problem and it could still be used. However, these problems are big problems in high-end hotels in the south or Europe and the United States, and they need to be dealt with. I hope the hotel managers and service staff understand what I mean. Secondly, the hotel deposit for two days is too high, which is unreasonable. Thirdly, the hotel breakfast ends at 8:30. Why is it so early? Tourists come to vacation, not to work. Shouldn't it be at least after 9:30? The hotel breakfast is quite rich, but you have to go earlier

Wudalianchi didn't have enough fun in one day, so I came back to continue to stay. The hotel's facilities are completely up to the specifications of a five-star hotel. The rooms are huge, with a big bathtub. I took a soak in it at night, and it was extremely comfortable. The fatigue and cold of the day were swept away. There is also a reminder at the hotel washbasin to remind guests not to drink the water in the faucet, because there is a small faucet of purified water for drinking next to it, which is really considerate. There are disposable slippers, plastic slippers, bathrobes, etc. in the room. The breakfast is also good, the WiFi does not require a password, and the network speed is fast. The parking lot is huge, and the hotel is a landmark building that can be seen from a long distance. The hotel is in Wudalianchi City, 20 kilometers away from the scenic spot, so it is convenient to travel by car. By the way, the taxi in the city is five yuan no matter where you go.
