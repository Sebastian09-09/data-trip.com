msg:Excellent level of service and amenities as you would expect for a 5 star hotel. We spent 4 nights here. Really great attitude from all the staff. I wasn’t happy they requested a full deposit on top of the Trip.com deposit, but the manager spoke English and gave a fair compromise. The hotel is showing signs of ageing now (Feb 2024), but everything important seemed very clean and well kept, towels were plump and bright white, bedding also, kettle, coffee machine and utensils all spotless. Great to have a Nespresso machine; they give you 3 capsules a night along with some good tea. The breakfast was excellent, and they kept the coffee flowing, but note their advice about timing because you will be queuing after 9am. There were two negatives for us: the bed was way too soft, and the room temperature was too warm on the lowest setting (in winter), so we didn’t sleep well. Overall, considering we only paid 899 a night, we thought excellent value, but if we were to stay again they’d have to offer another room with a firmer mattress.

msg:Undoubtedly, your group in Chengdu did really teach me a lesson! 

However, considering the old and sweet affection from others…like Marriott in Shekmun, Shartin, HKSAR, PRC, and Marriott in Singapore….., few patience still remains and counts. 

Because of this, 
please kindly allow me to share my thoughts and feelings to you according to these so-called SERVICRS!!!

They can be listed as follows: 

Front Desk
       1)HU,Jin ：(胡瑾）
               Director of Operations
          Bella Wang: 
               Operator of Front Desk
               HU JIN in Charge
The manager HU, she did not allow me to speak anything about the hotel service, when I tried to take down her name and the number of her working permit….
She directly refused and abruptly grabbed my pen in a VERY BAD AND RUDE way! 

I can guarantee in the name of my whole family !!! Only other creatures like animals WOULD PERFORM LIKE THIS!!! 

I have never seen such a scene. 

I was terrified and scared at that moment, I vanished to my Room 0917 directly! 

JUST In case of getting harmed by such an unreasonable and rude creature! 

Jesus!!! 

That was like a miracle and disaster for my entire trip in Chengdu!!!

I hide myself in my NO. 0917 Room for the whole night until 02/05/2023 due to the departure flight! 

Merely because I just want to escape from that monster without any interest to stay! 

Concierge:
     No luggage delivery service 
     No luggage service instructions 
     No relevant information for guidance 
     N/A FOR MANAGER 

I was and am very very disappointed about everything in Your Hotel in Chengdu, Sichuan, PRC……

your manager and her group upset me and harmed me and made me lose faith in your entire MARRIOTT GROUP. 

Should you have any inquiries and questions regarding all these complaints, please feel free to contact me.

For I have already escaped from CHENGDU, far far away from that WOMAN—Devil HU JIN! 

By the way, no apologies ARE NEEDED and WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Our room was not ready at check in time, but the staff arranged for us to rest in a separate room until the room we booked was ready and prepared some fruit and snacks for us while we waited. 

Breakfast was exceptional. Good mix of Chinese, western, and other international cuisines, with a large assortment of fresh juices. 

Location of the hotel is very close to many tourist spots (kuanzhai alley, wuhousi, jinli street, tianfu square, etc.) and within walking distance to a virus test spot.

The day before check-in, Rain, the front desk of the hotel, contacted me by phone to learn about the specific time and check-in requirements of the store, and added WeChat. During the stay, Rain and Kate took the initiative to ask for opinions and inquire about the check-in experience. After learning that we needed to delay check-out, they solved it in time, making our trip very successful. The hotel has all kinds of facilities, which are as easy to use as they were 6 years ago. It can be seen that the maintenance of the hotel is still in place. The card swiping system in the elevator is very convenient. The room number can be displayed by swiping it. The electric curtains in the room are very smooth to use, and the smart toilet is super easy to use. I will choose St. Regis Chengdu again if I have the chance in the future.

My niece liked the children's toothbrush and the small desserts in the evening. After staying for two days, the flowers in the lobby were changed. It was really luxurious, which was better than the Ritz. I also worked in the hotel industry before, and I took a special look at the hygiene of some corners. It was okay. Then the staff were also very enthusiastic, whether it was the front desk, the housekeeper, the restaurant or the staff in the elevator. They greeted warmly. There was just a small detail. When taking children, I often go back to the hotel to rest, and the number of times I go in and out will be more. I noticed that there seemed to be a vacancy at the lobby door. If there happened to be guests with luggage in and out, it would be inconvenient.

The day we checked in was Mother's Day. After learning about the situation, the housekeeper sent them a cake. The small surprise and thoughtfulness touched me even in a foreign place.
Although the hotel is relatively old, it is well maintained and has a more classical a**osphere.

The guest rooms are spacious and bright, and the design of the crystal lamps in the room echoes the lobby, which not only adds a sense of luxury, but also adds a sense of warmth.
On the last night of stay, the room service also gave a small surprise, which the children especially liked!
I think I will choose to stay at St. Regis when I come to Chengdu in the future.

msg:St. Regis Chengdu
The hotel is conveniently located, but the only drawback is that the hotel logo and instructions are not obvious enough.
We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 pm. Because the underground parking lot of the previous hotel of the same group and the same level in Chengdu (hereinafter referred to as the previous one) left us with a very bad impression, we applied to St. Regis to park on the ground. The concierge helped direct the parking in the rain. I am really grateful.
1. Because the hotel was booked through Ctrip, I am not very clear about the information required for the reservation, but the hotel front desk requires that the original ID card must be provided to check in. Can this situation be improved? At present, electronic ID cards are very popular, and sometimes it is indeed more convenient and faster for everyone to provide electronic ID cards.
2. After checking in, a handsome concierge helped to send the luggage to the room. I also sighed with my friends that fortunately there is no habit of tipping in China, otherwise I would feel that it would be unreasonable not to give such a good service a little reward.
3. Originally, we booked a suite, but the holiday just ended on the day we checked in. The hotel took the initiative to help upgrade the room type. Compared with the previous one, there is really no comparison without harm. Also, because the previous check-in was during the Qingming Festival holiday, the price would be higher. Because my friend's birthday is on this trip, I just want to evaluate the level of birthday decoration in the two hotels. The decoration of the first hotel can be described as perfunctory. After I reported it to the front desk, they added a swan towel similar to the honeymoon decoration. How can I say that the housekeeping department tried hard, but the customer was still not satisfied. St. Regis also helped with the birthday decoration, which was full of surprises. The handwritten greeting card was matched with the birthday cake-shaped towel, plus flower petals, etc., all of which reflected the staff's attentiveness. The refrigerator also gave a delicious brownie birthday cake and welcome fruit. After a day of tiring running around, I instantly resolved it after seeing these attentive hospitality.
4. The hotel opened in 2014, which is 10 years ago. Before coming, I was mentally prepared that the decoration would be relatively old, which was also reflected in the previous hotel, but I was very happy that this hotel was not old because of its age. There are smart toilets and electric curtains that keep pace with the times. The decoration style is also very classic and atmospheric, especially the room height makes people feel suddenly bright.
5. Because I couldn't sleep, I got up at more than six in the morning and went to the hotel gym. Worried about hypoglycemia, I asked the guy at the gym for mints, but was told that the gym only prepared sweet mints every day 🍎, so I showed off one on the bench at the entrance of the gym. After showing off, I went to the specially isolated yoga room to stretch, and then occupied the Smith machine and gantry for 45 minutes. During this time, only one guy was running on the treadmill. The entire gym is not very large, but the equipment is relatively complete, and it is just right to accommodate 6-7 guests to exercise at the same time. The swimming pool and the gym are both on the sixth floor. You can see the swimming pool in the gym. It is long and *****-shaped, and it should be about 25 meters long. There are blue LED lights on the top, with floor-to-ceiling windows. If you want to take pictures in the swimming pool, it should be very good.
6. After the gym, I saw that the elevator had the words "Yunfu on the 27th floor". I guessed it was the hotel executive lounge. It was still early, so I pressed the button to go up and took a look. It was an open-air environment. Because it was raining outside, I didn't go out for a stroll.
7. The hotel breakfast is very rich and the service is very enthusiastic, but there was a small episode in the middle. I forgot to change my shoes when I went to the restaurant, and I went there wearing hotel slippers. I was stopped by the front desk. After changing my shoes and finishing breakfast, I happened to meet the restaurant manager. I asked the reason for the stop. He answered, "Because the restaurant floor is slippery, hotel slippers are more likely to fall, and people are protecting everyone's safety, so hotel slippers are not allowed to enter." By the way, the hotel restaurant is on the 4th floor. Because the instructions are not obvious, I called the front desk to confirm it before I found it.
8. After breakfast, a friend happened to come to the lobby to look for it. While waiting for my friend, I met Richard, the hotel's duty manager. He was very enthusiastic and patiently listened to my suggestions and feelings about the hotel. For my reasonable requests, he was willing to help and said that if I come next time, they will definitely do better.
In summary, Chengdu St. Regis is my first choice hotel next time I come to Chengdu, and I am willing to recommend it to friends who need to stay in a hotel in Chengdu.

msg:A family of four wanted to live near Chunxi Road. After choosing for a long time, we finally chose St. Regis because the room was relatively large and there were two 1.52 beds🛏️.
After arriving, the overall feeling I had was still very interesting. The hotel happened to be holding a champagne opening ceremony, and invited us to visit and try some desserts and champagne🍾
The room was upgraded for us, probably on a higher floor. Because we have two children in our family, we prepared a baby bathtub and red panda toiletries for us.
The staff who cleaned the room were very gentle and cleaned very cleanly. The room is really big, and the TV is the children's favorite, which can be raised and lowered freely. The eldest also went to the 6th floor to swim for several days in a row🏊🏻♀️.
The hotel is located in a quiet place in the bustling city. Because we have a large family, we basically take a taxi when we go out. It takes a long time to get to various attractions. If you walk, Chunxi Road will take more than ten minutes, and it will take more than twenty minutes to go to People's Park Kuanzhai!
Every staff member of the hotel is very enthusiastic. Every time you return to the hotel, you will be greeted by a welcome back at the door! Very warm!
Although the hotel is a bit old, it is still well maintained. There are so many delicious foods in Chengdu. I didn’t try the hotel’s breakfast, but I can experience it next time!

The biggest difference is that the St. Regis is more attentive and provides 24-hour butler service. The front desk ada chloe knew that it was my first time to stay at the St. Regis and gave it to me. The upgraded room type was very warm and welcoming. I will stay at St. Regis next time I go on a business trip.

The little girl at the front desk, Chloe, smiled sweetly and spoke softly. She introduced the features of the hotel and opened the champagne with a saber. She also invited me to open the champagne too. She was so enthusiastic, hahaha. Unable to resist the enthusiasm, I went to the lobby at six o'clock to see the butler Hacken, who was wearing a very professional equestrian suit and opening champagne. The young man was quite cute wearing a red scarf. The concierge Ethen also took the initiative to help us with our luggage during check-in and check-out. She also greeted me directly when she saw me, which was very happy. All in all, this stay was a great experience and I recommend it to everyone!

The St. Regis Chengdu really surprised me and was very heart-warming. The waiters are very good in terms of appearance, manners, and service actions. On the first day of my stay, I participated in the hotel's night-time ceremony, where free champagne and ham slices were provided. St. Regis’ bears can be of good quality and can have names embroidered for free. 24-hour butler service provides coffee, hot milk, honey grapefruit water, cookies and other drinks. The shower room is large enough and the massage shower head is comfortable. The room was very clean and the check-in procedure at the front desk was quick. We called one day in advance to confirm the guest's preferences and requirements for the room. I hope St. Regis can continue to maintain this level of service and will choose St. Regis next time.

The room is very large and very spacious. The best part is that the living room area is completely separated from the master bedroom, which is very convenient for moving in with a slightly older boy. It is highly recommended that the hotel set up family rooms, which are suitable for mothers taking two children to stay, especially when the boys are older and the children are not old enough to check in alone, so they can only stay with adults. The only small suggestion is to deal with the brown marks on the edge of the bathtub as soon as possible, which affects the appearance very much.

It's just that the carpets are a bit old, which is understandable since the renovation took 10 years. It's within walking distance of Chunxi Road, making it convenient to travel.

msg:The room overall seems to be OK, with standard star hotel configurations. The TV is really bad. I have seen people lying on the bedside to adjust the channel if they want to watch TV. Although a lot of problems were solved by your store's engineers and they sincerely apologized👍. It was terminated for 3 days. It’s an unnecessary bummer. It’s worth mentioning that the so-called housekeeper, haha, the response is seriously delayed and the service is even more dispensable. I don’t know how he or she views his outrageous behavior😡 I won’t go into detail. After all, they don’t have this awareness. No. It was my first time to stay at the St. Regis in Chengdu, but I remembered this St. Regis in Chengdu. It turned out that the St. Regis hotel was not reliable and it was no longer the first choice🙍♀️The St. Regis Lhasa left me with unforgettable and beautiful memories. Next time Read more bad reviews, don’t just believe them, and don’t choose based on good impressions... The only good thing about this place is the Toto toilet🚽, it may be a little funny and unbelievable, but it is indeed the most positive and enthusiastic response🤣Breakfast, quite satisfactory, not as good as Jinjiang Rich. I will come back to this favorite tourist place, but this New Year’s Day also makes me remember your store completely...

msg:It was past two o'clock in the morning when I returned to Chengdu from western Sichuan to the city. The first thing I thought of was the familiar St. Regis. Because the sudden high fever made me feel particularly uncomfortable, I asked a friend to take me back to Chengdu overnight. As a result, the St. Regis was full that night and I had to choose Wall Street. I have never stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in Chengdu. It is not as good as the one in Beijing. The bed had hair and the sofa was also dusty. I was very disappointed. I went straight to St. Regis the next day and the decoration style was still so familiar. Chloe knew my pain the night before and was considerate. I upgraded the room and there was a cute green basket as soon as I entered the door. It was very cute and there was a place to put my sunglasses and mask clip. I loved it. After entering, both the lighting from the room and the city view were very comfortable. I simply packed my suitcase. Put on I love y music, but the speakers may be a bit old, JBL, the reverb effect is very good, but the class may be old, and the boss effect of Park Hyatt is not as good, but I am still very happy. I put on my makeup and went to IFS. I went shopping and the hotel was only a 15-minute walk to the entrance. There are handsome doormen in the lobby who open the door, so there is basically no need to do anything. When I came back from shopping in the evening, Andy arranged delicious nougat for me, saying that it was freshly made in the kitchen in the evening and it was delicious. Later, he also gave me Anxin Cantonese red bean paste. I will arrive later. I went out to experience the nightlife of young people in Chengdu. I returned to the hotel and took a comfortable shower. The moment I lay on the pillow on the bed, I felt like the comfort of a tipsy back. I slept super comfortable. The St. Regis bedding is unparalleled. I didn’t care about it before. I stayed with St. Regis wherever I went. Thank you for letting me know about St. Regis. I slept until after 10 o'clock in the morning and didn't want to eat breakfast. Fortunately, Chloe and Andy gave me two fruits, some small oranges, and a bubble bath. I put on my makeup and prepared to check out. In the afternoon, I went to eat at Wuliguan recommended by the manager, but it didn't go unnoticed. Finally, after watching the giant panda, I went back to the hotel to pick up my luggage and go to the airport. My friend knew that I was alone outside and gave me flowers. But in the morning I forgot to take it for a bath and left it at the hotel. I couldn’t bear to take the flowers back to Hangzhou before they withered. The porters and doormen helped me when I got on the bus. Thank you for making me feel like the experience was great. Thank you St. Regis.

It is hygienic and clean. The surrounding environment is convenient. When I went downstairs to go shopping, I walked directly to Chunxi Road. There are many delicious restaurants nearby. Because I was in a hurry and wanted to eat Chengdu snacks so much that I couldn't dine at the hotel, so I had a look at the door and it felt good.
Environment: The design is grand and many people say it is old-fashioned. Maybe it is because I have stayed in too many Internet celebrity hotels... A hotel that has been renovated for 14 years has a unique flavor, and the hardware is well maintained.

It took at least ten minutes for the previous groups of guests. I was still coordinating and waiting for the room to be cleaned when I checked in. I felt quite disappointed. The guests came all the way and really wanted to go back to their rooms early to rest.

The room is relatively spacious and comfortable, but the facilities are a bit old and the air conditioner is very noisy. I have no choice but to turn off the air conditioner to sleep at night.

The hotel is in a good location, very close to Chunxi Road, but not too noisy or traffic jam. There are also some good local restaurants next to the hotel where you can eat without having to crowd with tourists.

msg:Because the visa application process was nearby, I chose the St. Regis Hotel. The room is really large and very comfortable. The roof is relatively high and the floor-to-ceiling glass feels very comfortable in the house. The swimming pool is amazing, definitely the highlight of the hotel. Needless to say, the butler service is really considerate. My check-in butler is Lorenzo, who is very good and always provides service with a smile. It was late at night and we needed hot grapefruit tea, which was brought to the room very quickly, which made people feel very warm. Overall great stay experience

msg:The service was very good. I just had to wait for a while to check in, and then I was given three fruits on the fruit plate in the room. I wanted to add some persimmons but said no. The room was large. We were given a corner room. The hygiene was good. The toilet was a washlet and the shower also had a massage showerhead. Sorry, the supplies were from a brand I didn't recognize. There is a makeup mirror on the countertop in the living room, which is a good comment. As soon as we entered the room, we were given tea and cookies, turned down and gave us delicious snowflake cakes. There is a shopping mall next to it, so it is very convenient to go in and out to eat~ Then there were return visits, small gifts, and praise to Andy, Bella, and Caroline.

msg:The reason why I chose the St. Regis was purely because it was the most expensive hotel in our area. I went to Chengdu and wanted to experience it, but maybe because it had been open for a long time, the equipment in the room was aging. It was better than the butler-style hotel. The service is famous, including the pretty girl at the front desk (Picture 8) and the housekeeping staff.

msg:I avoided traveling to Chengdu during the National Day holiday and stayed at St. Regis Chengdu for two nights. It felt pretty good. First of all, the design style of the hotel room is urban. The style is luxurious, the space is spacious, the facilities are complete, and it is very convenient to use, which is in line with the positioning of a five-star hotel. The butler service is considerate, there is welcome fruit when you check in, and you ask for ironing clothes every day. According to the demand, the waiter at the front desk downstairs took the initiative to push the luggage and help call the vehicle. The attitude was very good, which changed the impression of poor service in Chengdu hotels. There were many kinds of breakfast and the dining experience was good. Next time I go to Chengdu, St. Regis is definitely a must-have.

As soon as you enter the hotel, you will be greeted by staff. There are about three counters for check-in or check-out. If you need to wait, there is a sofa next to you to rest. Special thanks to ada carolin and Iris at the front desk, they are super nice.

The room is quite comfortable and the bed is quite big. The bathroom has a bathtub and shower, and the double sinks are very convenient. The shower nozzle is very interesting. It actually has a pressure massage nozzle on the back. Haha, a quick shower can relieve your tiredness.

The swimming pool is also very good. It has a large space and the water depth is about 1.3 meters at the maximum. There seems to be a sauna or something. There is also a warm water soaking pool next to the swimming pool, which is great.

If you drive there, you can park for free, which is very convenient.

It's nice to take a bath, but the TV doesn't seem to be working properly.
The snowflake cake on the bedside table is delicious
Enough of the Ice Age
The smart toilet is much better than Temple House
During the epidemic, the 5,000-dollar apar**ent was actually not smart.
I feel embarrassed to say that I am the number one, because the location is good.
I wake up hungry in the morning, drink some water, take a walk, and have a good meal
The ada who checked out watched me leave.
I hope you will already be the lobby manager next time I come here🥰

I encountered some hotel employees who had poor service and were rude. After the follow-up communication was resolved, I felt pretty good. Most of the staff are polite and enthusiastic. Breakfast is a bit average.

msg:I just came back from Japan the day before and flew two flights in a row. I wanted to pack my luggage and soak in a hot spring, so I temporarily decided to stay at St. Regis for a night to make a transition. As a result, I slept from afternoon to night and did not experience any night-time rituals or turn-down. I booked a beggar's room and was given two fruits, which I didn't like to eat. I originally wanted to drink Chengdu’s Bloody Mary, but I slept there again😅😅The bed was still comfortable, so I fell asleep.

Facilities: The facilities are old, the bathtub has a lot of scratches, and the shower head seems to have been opened. The cloakroom was too small, and neither of the two 20kg large boxes could be unfolded. It was also very dark, so I had to drag the boxes to the window to sort them out. It was funny. The good thing is that there are many tables in the room, the layout is good, the circulation is reasonable, and it is really comfortable. I didn’t like the style of St. Regis before, but now I think it is worthy of St. Regis.

Service: Relatively average. Although the butler service delivers things quickly, it is not as user-friendly and touching as the service in chain hotels where I have stayed several times. I don’t like others to serve me. I didn’t ask for anything, but some staff seem a bit arrogant, haha😄

Many people think that the rooms are very old and the facilities and equipment are very old. For example, if your home has been renovated for nearly ten years, can you guarantee that everything is as new as ever? What kind of bicycle do you want at this price? The front desk team is very good-looking. Thanks to Manager Xiao Liu for arranging the room. Next time I come back, I will definitely choose St. Regis Chengdu. I would like to give a small suggestion. The lobby is a bit too cold. I feel a cold wind stabbing my spine while sitting and checking in. It would be better if the heating in the lobby could be improved.

The two family rooms booked in advance did not provide any children's supplies, they had to ask for them. Checked into the room at 6pm. There was no welcome preparation in the room. When I went back at 11 o'clock, I discovered that there were a few candies, because the candies had melted due to the heat of the air conditioner. 6666
The air conditioning is super! Invincible! hot! It's boring** and you can't adjust it yourself.
There were very few types of breakfast. All the bottles in the juice area were sticky and were not cleaned immediately. The yogurt area was also very dirty. I have never seen any hotel with such a dirty breakfast.
Next time I go to Chengdu, I will not choose St. Regis. Please choose carefully, Chengdu St. Regis cannot meet the standards.

Compared with St. Regis in other cities in China, the house price of St. Regis in Chengdu should be considered very cheap. Then I booked two rooms.
The result surprised me a lot..
The services of Bella and lris at the front desk are excellent. They upgraded me to two imperial suites. It should be a room type with a price of tens of thousands.
It’s an exaggeration.. I live in a room of almost 200 square meters. I can roll around by myself. There are many shopping malls nearby, and it’s very convenient to eat.
The night view at night is also beautiful q
Gym and pool are good
that feels great
I highly recommend everyone to live here, very comfortable
Next time I come back, I will continue to live in St. Regis..

The room equipment is very new, TOTO's smart toilet, and there is a place to sit in the super-large bathroom. This is not considered by many hotels. The TV is also liftable Yep, those of us who don't watch TV really like the design. When we checked in, Sherry, the housekeeper, took the initiative to add me on WeChat, and provided considerate service every day, bringing us tea, desserts, and solving problems in a timely manner.

1. We chose to stay at the St. Regis Hotel after a long journey. The air conditioner in the room we were given did not circulate air. It was like being in a sauna. It felt like we were completely out of breath. Check-in was after 2 o'clock, and the elderly and children were basically all the same. I was outside (because I was doing errands outside), it was almost 11 o'clock in the evening, and I still hadn't rested. When I returned to the hotel, I found that I couldn't breathe. At this level, it was like cerebral hypoxia.
   St. Regis Hotel, I would like to ask if your rooms are not inspected or maintained. The last time I stayed in your house, there was a strong musty and damp smell and I didn’t give a bad review. Why do you really call this St. Regis! Basic facilities Neither can be done well

2. When it comes to service, I don’t want to go into details. I want to talk about two main points. The first is to call the hotel housekeeper. The housekeeper is very impatient. Come and try your sauna room. The processing speed is very slow and he keeps urging you to do nothing. When people came, I went downstairs to the front desk to ask. The young lady at the front desk stared at you with a funny smile like she was watching a show. She didn’t say anything, and the manager came over to apologize. Of course, ATINA’s housekeeper is very good, and this housekeeper is still me. I encountered this by chance. When I checked into the hotel, they didn’t tell me who my housekeeper was. Well, ATINA actively contacted my colleagues after work to help me solve the problem. Thank you very much to her. Originally, I didn’t want to give a bad review because of her, but I really can’t accept St. Regis. The facilities and rooms are dilapidated and not checked. You can just make some changes to the room if you like. I would like to add here. I have one thing to mention. Later, ATINA gave me a fruit plate, drinks, and a bear. Thank you very much to her, but to be honest, I spent a lot of money. I didn’t have a good rest at night, especially the elderly who came home with a cold, so I have to leave a bad review.
3. In the end, after procrastinating for a long time, the solution was to change me to a house with no door in the toilet and bathroom. It was a disgusting house type anyway. I didn’t even want to post the photos, but the advantage was that I could breathe. I didn’t expect that I would be disappointed with Rui. Ji tolerated it again and again, but in the end it was so low that all he needed was ventilation.
I have stayed at St. Regis Chengdu three or four times, but there is no next time.

Generally speaking, it is very good, but compared with other St. Regis, the hardware of this St. Regis needs to be improved, and there is even a smell of sewer outside the door. I wonder if it is because Evergrande Plaza has not been operating recently...

msg:I got up early in the morning to pack up and prepare to check out, and found Xiaoqiang under the pillow... put myself in the guest's shoes. After making another complaint, I met a housekeeper who could serve me for the first time... I paid 2,000 per night for Xiaoqiang to accompany me to sleep. The staff who came had no solution except apologizing... By the way, I called the complaint phone three times. I just saw the staff coming over. If Xiaoqiang was alive, he would have disappeared long ago, right? Does the client still have to seize the evidence as soon as possible? I still couldn't find a satisfactory solution until I left Chengdu. The reply I received before boarding the plane was that they still need to clean the guest room and find out the reason... I really can't understand the idea of ​​​​this solution. As a service industry, solving customer problems is not the first priority.
In short, St. Regis Chengdu is quite disappointing. Rights protection complaints are still on the way. I just hope that the hotel will learn a lesson and learn more from St. Regis Lhasa. The gap between the same company is too big!

It only takes more than ten minutes to walk to Chunxi Road in Taikoo Li, but for me, who is afraid of the heat, I basically didn't walk. We arrived at the hotel by car, and parking is very convenient, with our own parking lot. After entering the hotel, the hotel's perfume smells very good, and I feel that the sweat smell on my body has disappeared. Kingsley, Lynn, and Andy at the check-in front desk were very enthusiastic and helped us upgrade the room for free. Since the room only had a big bed, they gave us an extra bed for free. The room service staff also helped us clean up very enthusiastically. The room is very comfortable, and you can enjoy the night view of downtown Chengdu. The breakfast is also very rich, and it is very comfortable to eat every day. In short, the staying experience is very good, and I will stay here again next time I come to Chengdu! Thank you also to all the service staff in the hotel for their enthusiastic service!

The location of the hotel is very good, just on the side of Chunxi Road, and it takes only ten minutes to walk to Taikoo Li. When we checked in, I was very grateful to Bella, xiola, and Iris, the beauties at the front desk, who arranged three rooms for us on the same floor, and put our luggage in the room thoughtfully. As soon as we entered the hotel, we felt professionalism, enthusiasm, and made us feel at home. The rooms are very large, clean and luxurious. It's very quiet, and the privacy is very good. Both adults and children can sleep beautifully, and the bedding is great. The whole room is equipped with intelligent home furnishing, intelligent lifting of TV, electric curtains, and intelligent lighting design, so that we no longer need to look for switches to operate. The toilet toto in the bathroom is fully intelligent and comfortable. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel check-in is too 🔥, there are often no rooms, and you need to wait for the room to be cleaned when you arrive late. If you come to check in, you must book a room earlier. Next time you come to Chengdu, you will stay at St. Regis again.

I am very satisfied with this stay, especially the housekeeper Chloe, who is very considerate and efficient. The response of the room service is very fast. However, there are some small details that can be improved. The main reason is that the hotel has been renovated for a long time and the bedside lights The control panel is not very sensitive and the lampshade of the bedside lamp is a bit yellow. These are some very small details that the St. Regis Hotel can do better.

msg:This is the worst experience of my life
The core is hotel decoration and front-end services
1. The entire bed is decorated with snakeskin, the mini bar is decorated with cracks, and there are two large desks inside the big bed.
I won’t mention the clichés, but I suddenly noticed the snakeskin decoration and was shocked. I called and asked, and they said that all rooms are like this.
The psychological shadow is too great
2. As St. Regis is famous for its butler service, there are no pre-inquiries.

The hotel is very old, but I was on a business trip. I thought it would be a bit older for a hotel with a price of more than 900 yuan. I really couldn't stand it. It is connected to a half-dead shopping mall. It is so low.

I had a call from customer service today to ask about my stay, and I couldn’t tell! She was very polite, but didn't you record my phone calls?
Seeing that skin cast too much shadow on me, the whole piece!

My colleagues and I changed hotels because we couldn't check out. Really so broken

I had to ask for it three times on the night of check-in (I don’t know why. Other hotels just need to explain it again.) The room looks old, well-maintained, and cleaned very clean. The vicinity of Evergrande Plaza is not very popular, but it is not far from the central business district. You can walk to Tianfu Square and Taikoo Li within 30 minutes. The hotel can iron and dry two pieces of clothes per day for free. (Not used, but should be helpful for many travelers)
The number of breakfast varieties is medium, but the quality is very high. All the staff in the breakfast room have a good sense of service. The attached Cantonese restaurant tastes good, and there is no discount for non-Marriott members staying in the hotel (Marriott members get 10% off, Dianping seems to be 30% off), I understand that guests are not encouraged to eat, so I changed my habit and only ate once. Finally, I pointed out that there is a shortcoming in the structure of the hotel, that is, if the tenant next door closes the door heavily, it will cause a certain vibration in the corner. At first I thought it was a noise, but then I realized it. Unfortunately, I live on a higher floor and still encounter "neighbors" who close their doors multiple times during midnight, early morning and night. The attitude of the hotel is not bad. They proposed remedial measures such as changing the room and giving me desserts (although I didn't accept it, but the housekeeper's kindness accepted it.) I hope that the hotel will redecorate the small equipment that slows down the closing of the door in the future.

I have to say that the details are well controlled, and the swimming pool is very clean. Special thanks to Chelsea Bella and Xiola, overall the check-in experience was very good, and the two children had a great time. The restaurant on the second floor has good dishes and good service.

The hotel took the initiative to upgrade the room and responded in a timely manner. Even some details are more appropriate than Six Senses and there are no flaws. Because St. Regis Chengdu opened earlier, I had expected problems such as the aging of the facilities, but overall it is still in good condition. Personally, I can give it full marks.

It cost more than 1,000 yuan per night, and I had to change rooms twice after checking in. There was either a musty or cigarette smell. I ended up changing to a connecting room, but I was too lazy to change. The location is also average, there is no food around, it is a long walk from Taikoo Li, the staff is slow to respond, check out at noon, and the deposit will not be returned in the evening. I like Chengdu very much. I also stayed in other hotels during this trip. In comparison, the St. Regis was very bad, extremely bad.

When checking in, the waitress at the front desk had a haughty face and forced to pay more to upgrade the room type on the grounds that the room was not cleaned. Today I checked out and arrived at the airport. The hotel called to ask for a good review. Sending gifts by mail is really disappointing, isn't it? I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Xi'an, the Regent Hotel Chongqing, and the St. Regis Chengdu within half a month. The St. Regis Chengdu is the worst. Learn from the services of the other two. The facilities are old, but the service is so low Look, who dares to come and live in the future.

msg:Generally speaking, the most reliable hotels in the center of Chengdu are St. Regis and Grand Hyatt. The breakfasts of these hotels plus WA are basically below the average level. St. Regis has almost been there in the past two months because of its high cost performance. There are three types of freshly squeezed juices, including orange juice, watermelon, and cucumber, and a bunch of fruits such as longan, pear, orange, grapefruit, dragon fruit, papaya, and honeydew melon.

      There are also a lot of choices in the noodle stall area, such as sausage noodles, beef noodles, dandan noodles, and red oil noodles. There are five or six kinds of ingredients, and you can mix them yourself. The lack of deep-fried dough sticks is hard and firewood. It should be semi-finished products that are difficult to eat. I am particularly satisfied with them before. The big bowl of yogurt that I love is gone. I pair it with blueberries, and strawberries can eliminate a big bowl of super slimming. The kitchen knows my appeal and prepared exclusive customization for me for 2 consecutive days.

ps: The service of Caroline and Ms. Song at the front desk is very good, making me feel at home and I will come back next time

I checked out at 11 a.m. and left my luggage at the hotel until 4 p.m. to pick it up. The hotel didn't tell me about anything left behind. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I had left it in the hotel. I asked the hotel today that they indeed had my pants left.

Toto's smart toilet is very good The electronically controlled curtains, lighting system and hidden TV are convenient to use and full of ceremonies. The most commendable thing is St. Regis’s butler service, which is excellent as always, especially Kingsley, Iris and Xiola’s responsiveness, which makes people feel more comfortable , there are abundant welcome fruits and professional turndown service. The next day's room is clean and tidy, and there are many choices of pillows. The buckwheat husk pillows and lavender pillows I chose are of good quality. There are two indoor and outdoor rooms on the 6th floor. There are two swimming pools, the children's pool has a high water temperature, and the standard swimming pool has a suitable water temperature and is very comfortable. This stay was a perfect experience, and I will choose St. Regis again when I come to Chengdu in the future.

This time I stayed in a hotel room where the air-conditioning outlet was facing the bed. The wind was blowing directly at everyone, and the air-conditioning was very loud. The children I brought with me were so noisy that they couldn't sleep at 1:30 in the middle of the night. The maintenance man brought a ladder in the middle of the night. During the inspection, the sound was a bit loud as soon as I walked in. The air conditioner was turned off and the noise disappeared. Then the maintenance man asked why there were other noises. After a long inspection, he said there was no problem. The sound of the air conditioner in the St. Regis Hotel was relatively loud. The housekeeper suggested giving us earplugs to sleep with. Who are you trying to fool? I was really speechless. I finally turned off the air conditioner and slept for one night. The experience was imaginable. What kind of hotel management and service has it become? When I checked out the next day, I called to apologize and give me a pair of eye masks as compensation. Refuse decisively and complain directly to the headquarters and local 12315. This is not just a service problem, but also a local management problem.
I hope that my unpleasant experience will make the hotel realize that chain services must be standardized and unified. I hope it can bring a better experience to other guests and not make people think that St. Regis Shenzhen and St. Regis Chengdu are not the same hotel.

msg:It's the first time I live in St. Regis Chengdu, I didn't expect the experience to be very good. When getting off the car, the concierge opened the door and helped carry the luggage. Many people checked in when they entered the lobby. The staff immediately took over the luggage and arranged for them to wait for the check-in. The style of the hotel is the old money style that I like, and their service is very comfortable, the kind that I like just right, not too exaggerated, and overall very comfortable. The staff will take the initiative to say hello, especially thanks to katrina, kingsley and xiola for taking care of them, and will note my personal preferences. This trip to Chengdu is very satisfying, and I will continue to stay at St. Regis next time I come to Chengdu.

msg:During the stay, the hotel manager named Feng made a series of operations that were directly equivalent to chasing the guests away, immediately canceling the next itinerary, and leaving. How can a five-star hotel have such a so-called duty manager? Follow-up, another manager of the hotel, Carolin, communicated with me on the phone. , The attitude is indeed very good, but I would also like to say that those who spend money to come to a five-star hotel only need one service. Maybe the facilities in your hotel here are a bit outdated, which is acceptable, but the service from a five-star hotel is not the same as that of a fast hotel. I will definitely not choose St. Regis next time I come to Chengdu. I have to say that the security guards at the door are very good. They will immediately open the door for you when the car comes and goes. There is also a boy to help you carry your luggage. On the contrary, the guest room is where guests continue to stay. I didn't even look at it. I called after two o'clock to directly urge them to check out. They didn't take the guests' demands into consideration at all!

The room is very comfortable, large in size, smart toilet, relatively modern, which I like. Check-in at the front desk was a bit slow at the beginning, but Ada and Cecily quickly completed the formalities, and at night they gave poplar nectar to turn down the bed. Special praise, St. Regis's bed is so comfortable, I really like it! The breakfast is good, very rich, satisfying the tastes of adults and children. It is worth staying next time

Comments, the local star standard is estimated to be a bit far from that of Shanghai, and I was very anxious to book this five-star hotel. I first considered that this hotel has a swimming pool, and there are also some bad reviews. But after I went in, I was really glad that I chose the right hotel. The service is very good and the environment is good. Although the facilities are a bit old, I still like it very much. I will choose this hotel next time when I go to Chengdu. The front desk is katrina, white and xiola The service attitude is also very good.

I am very happy that the online booking did not include breakfast. As a result, Ms. Katrina at the front desk not only helped us upgrade the room, but also gave us a 40% discount on breakfast, which is a double!

In addition, thanks to Chelsea and Caroline for making the trip to Chengdu very satisfying! I would like to choose St. Regis next time~

msg:Overall it is a very good hotel. IFS is very close to Chunxi Road. It takes 10 minutes to walk there. Every service staff in the hotel is very proactive. They will greet each other when they meet each other. They will press the elevator and help hold the elevator door. Will take the initiative to greet you and ask if you need anything. At the buffet in the morning, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen a receptionist take a seat. Samuel is really professional in registering and arranging a table, especially on the New Year’s Eve morning. In the case of heavy passenger flow, he maintains order and soothes emotions. Really very good. When I checked in, there was a slight flaw, because when the staff of the hotel reservation depar**ent answered Ctrip's question about the difference in room types, they didn't update it in time after the hotel policy changed, so I always thought that the deluxe room can enjoy the happy hour trea**ent, but in fact No, so it's a little annoying. Here we seriously praise Ctrip Xiaoqin, who really thinks what the customer thinks, and with their help and coordination, the solution was satisfactorily resolved.

Generally speaking, if the premium deluxe room is only for high floors, it is actually better to choose a deluxe room. The area and room type are the same. Others, whether it is bedding, breakfast, room service (I think the room smells of smoke, they immediately brought a Dyson air purifier) are all very good.

Will stay again in the future.

The bed is soft, but the top five stars basically have this problem. The hotel service is very satisfactory. The staff are very nice and considerate. I took two children with me when I checked in and made breakfast as a gift. Thank you very much. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast on the 4th floor is rich and varied. The breakfast dishes are all available after staying for two days There are obvious changes in some categories, and the taste is quite good. The dessert macaron is superb, and my family is very satisfied with it. The next time I come to Chengdu, I will book St. Regis again, and I will go to Sanya soon. Because of St. Regis Chengdu's favorability, I will book St. Regis Sanya again immediately. Love it🫰♥️

I chose this hotel because I mainly visited Chunxi Road on the first day and I was familiar with the surrounding area of the hotel. The hotel has a convenient parking lot, a dedicated parking lot, and the rooms are relatively large, equipped with TWG tea bags. There is also a business downstairs in the hotel. I was tired from shopping at night, so I went to Changle to relax. Hotel check-out can be extended until 2 pm, which is more humane. In short, it's the first time I live in St. Regis, and I feel pretty good.

Hygiene: clean does make up for the lack of older facilities
Environment: The overall environment is good
Service: A total of three reservations were made, and the first two were cancelled due to the epidemic. This stay was to celebrate acquaintance with my husband at St. Regis ten years ago, and we are still at St. Regis ten years later. We have always liked St. Regis Hotel very much. There is no special housekeeper. Someone came to introduce us after calling the housekeeper in the room. The cleaning SU SU is very good, I like her smile, and she does her best to do things 👍
Alicia, the deputy manager of Yanting Chinese Restaurant on the second floor, was very considerate and introduced the dishes to us carefully. My husband and I both like food, and we have a soft spot for foie gras. We recommend foie gras in cherry juice, which goes well with very good. Together with Alicia's service, we had a great evening.
HAPPY HOUR: It's a pity I don't have time to experience 'Chuan Marie'

Breakfast: rich dishes and good attitude

Just because I arrived a little late, I reserved a room in the originally reserved room and had to change it. Regarding the room type, I thought that since I had changed it, I would spend an extra 100 to upgrade it, but I didn’t expect it to be rubbish? The service is remarkable. The guy at the front desk said he was sending desserts, but he didn't. Even though we couldn't eat them, it showed the quality of the service. But there is also some intention, I found that all the tea bags were used, and a few extra bottles of water were put in the next day.

msg:The check-in service this time can only be said to be a bit out of line with its own hotel specifications. Because I came to check in alone, I went to climb Mount Qingcheng during the day on the day of check-in. The image was a bit embarrassing, but I didn't care about going to the hotel and then cleaning it up, but I was really convinced by the front desk of your hotel that afternoon.
First, Yingbin looked at me at the door with a big travel bag and asked if I was here for a meal or a visit. After answering that it was a check-in, it seemed that I realized that there was such an option and immediately opened the door for me. Then when I came in and asked about the front desk, the other of the two front desks of your hotel happened to be idle at that time. During our conversation, he glanced at me for a while, and he was really speechless. .
After I checked into the room, because it was almost night, I just wanted to eat some fruit and wait for a takeaway. I was too lazy to go out. As a result, I waited for a long time and couldn't wait for the welcome fruit plate. Finally, when I went down to get the takeaway, I asked for the welcome at the door. , and finally explained that too many guests were missed today.
In addition to these, the effort to get up for a meal at breakfast the next day was immediately taken away, and they were still cleaning up when I came back, but this was also an accident that the plate was emptied at that time.
In addition to these, it is a little surprising that the shower compar**ent in the changing room of the swimming fitness layer does not have lights. It can only be said that it is indeed environmentally friendly and low-carbon, and even lights are not needed. The non-slip blankets on the floor blocked some compar**ents and the door of the steam sauna opposite, and had to be pushed hard to open.
But one thing to say, other aspects of the installation are very good, the hot pool is very spacious, just next to the swimming pool, the side facing the outside is full of bright large glass, the night view is very beautiful at night, but it will reflect when you look in the pool It's not very clear. The room will be relatively small, but the degree of intelligence is higher, which is still very good.
One last thing to mention, I redeemed the late check-out on Ctrip and marked the check-out at 14:00. As a result, the phone in the bathroom rang around 13:20, urging me to quickly clean up their room at 13:30. After asking the housekeeper later, he said, "I'm sorry, maybe the check-out remarks were not noticed over there. I'll give you the remarks over there. . .
Summary: The infrastructure of St. Regis is better and the night view is better, but the service attitude is poor, the details are not noticed at all, and there is still a situation where the hotel rushes people.

msg:The room was huge, a bit like the spaciousness of a hotel in Macau. The decoration style is American, very simple, and the colors are more elegant. There is a small mirror on the right side of the door, which is the design of the entrance... I think the guests who are not picky about the hotel should be satisfied. The little brother Kinsley of the hotel is very nice~ I will choose St. Regis next time I come to Chengdu.

Next time I go to Chengdu, I will stay at the St. Regis Hotel and I will recommend it to my friends!

The hotel is located on Chunxi Road, very close to Taikoo Li, and there are many delicious food nearby. In the afternoon of the third day, I went downstairs to do nucleic acid work, caught up with the rain, and got wet instantly. After returning to the hotel, the hotel staff, especially Ziyin, xiola and Cecily, contacted us immediately and prepared hot drinks for us to ward off the cold. Very thoughtful and considerate, thank you very much! Patiently answer some information about attractions, food and more!
Very good check-in experience, blindly looking for the hotel booked online, the result is unexpectedly satisfied! Choose Regis, you will never step on the pit!

Transportation: convenient
Hygiene: clean
Environment: spacious and clean
Service: Butler service, very warm, friendly, thoughtful and caring

msg:Every time I go to Chengdu, I like to unlock hotels I have never stayed in, and this time I chose St. Regis. Also had a good experience. When I checked in, Miss ADA FENG at the front desk kindly upgraded the room type, because the room was still being cleaned, and I had to deal with work. She and my colleagues specially asked me to take a break in the West Point room, ordered mocha, and settled the bill. When I actually told me that it was a gift from the hotel, I was very happy to receive an unexpected courtesy. After entering the room, there is nothing to say about the facilities. The bedding and toiletries also maintain the consistent quality of St. Regis. The height of the key room is higher than that of ordinary hotels, so it is very a**ospheric and comfortable. During the stay, the same feeling was very good. The butler service is unique to St. Regis. Everyone and the staff are very enthusiastic and proactive. Seeing that I like drinking black tea, they even sent me a lot of TWG tea bags. When the night fell, I went to the open-air bar on the top floor. The a**osphere and environment were very good, and the drinks were produced at the standard level. It is a pity that there are not many guests. It is also very convenient to go out, not far from anywhere. Because during the epidemic prevention period, nucleic acid needs to be done on time, and there is a nucleic acid point in the square on the side of the hotel, which is very convenient. I check in every day without queuing. In short, I like Chengdu St. Regis very much, so I changed from one night to three days, hahaha, I think I will definitely come back next time.

It was very loud, and the staff came to adjust it to make it smaller, but there was still resonance, and finally asked to change the room. The next day the manager called to apologize, sent me fruit, and adjusted the check-out time to 14:00. Now that the problem with the room is so big, shouldn't it be adjusted immediately? Adjus**ents must be made when the guests can't bear it. When I made the reservation, I ordered to check out at 14 o'clock. If I apologize, I will apologize normally. Saying something like adjusting the check-out at 14 o'clock makes me feel that the apology is so perfunctory. Will not choose this hotel again

Always leave a very warm feeling

The room continues the feel of old money in Manhattan, New York
Extensive use of Art Decro's lines and mirrors

In addition, this time my room is a double bed room with a 270-degree window view
Wake up in the morning by the sunlight after the curtains are slowly opened

Lots of variety in the morning
Restaurant service is also very good
Remember my name, always say hello back and forth
Makes people feel kind and caring

I was lucky to choose the St. Regis hotel this time.
I hope that after the epidemic, I can come back often to stay at "The St. Regis Chengdu"

Special thanks to the hotel staff Caroline and Noel for their attentive attitude, which made me feel the consistent service spirit of St. Regis.

The waiter in the parking lot when we went out and came back asked if we were staying in the hotel, and also asked our room impatiently. No., Ctrip members didn't enjoy the room upgrade when I went to stay. I sent it off casually, and then Ctrip's reservations cannot participate in Marriott's points. When I go to stay, I will not actively associate member information, and I need to take the initiative to ask. There were peeling skins in many parts of the room, and the most important thing was that there was blood on the pillow on the second night. It was too late at that time. As a five-star old-fashioned hotel, the butler service is not felt at all. Even when I said that I went out and called to register the license plate, I had to go to the lobby to register and then go down another elevator. The service staff will not greet you. All in all...not a pleasant stay. There is blood on the pillow, it really should be separated.

Park Hyatt Banyan Tree Shangri-La Conrad, etc., breakfast is better than this St. Regis. The location is not bad, just right from Taikoo Li Chunxi Road, neither noisy nor far. As for the so-called butler service, I don't really feel the special feature, maybe I haven't booked a suite haha~
Compliment the waiters at the entrance of the hotel, they are all more enthusiastic. Warmer than the lobby~
Although the breakfast is not delicious, the waiters in the breakfast depar**ent are very enthusiastic and proactive.
This St. Regis may serve you ok, but the hardware is too old to keep up with the service.

The housekeeper Roro was very thoughtful and helped to change the twin room, but unfortunately it was a smoking floor. I wanted to change it again and told that only this floor has a room, so I sent a purifier. For non-smokers, this room is really a pain. The breakfast has few varieties and the taste is not good. I didn't feel the century-old butler service. I was disappointed to stay for a day and decided to check out and return to the Ritz-Carlton. It's even more outrageous when you leave the store. There is no smile at the front desk, no greeting, no goodbye, and a black face. It's a program check out. Bad review! Finally, while waiting for the taxi, a man at the door also helped us with our luggage and said goodbye to us. The experience is super bad, the room is old.

Hope to make up for the regret next time and experience the spa and swimming pool.

The surrounding area is relatively close to Taikoo Li on Chunxi Road, and the starting fee can be reached. The Evergrande shopping mall next to it is relatively poor, and it feels like it is going to close down. Li Bai's sauce pork buns across the road from the hotel entrance are delicious. You can try it when you see what I have commented. It is just across the road, 3 pieces of sauce pork buns

msg:I am a very picky person who is very clean. After seeing many hotels, I finally chose St. Regis. First of all, the most important thing is the bedding. After three days of sleep, I feel comfortable and relax. Secondly, I am used to using smart toilets at home. Ordinary toilets are always awkward when I go out. Fortunately, Regis is a smart toilet, which feels like home hahaha. The hotel’s service is very good. I will take the initiative to open the door to take my luggage and greet me, especially Miss Ada. The meticulous care made me feel at home. The breakfast is also very rich, the waiter sister will lead to the seat and ask if you want coffee or tea, the dishes are fresh, there are freshly squeezed juices, and I fell in love with the baked mushrooms. The St. Regis is located in Evergrande Plaza. It is very convenient to walk to Chunxi Road for about ten minutes, and the transportation is also very convenient. However, it would be great if there could be a small robot to deliver the food to the room. After all, it is not convenient to live alone. Nice experience!

I called the housekeeper to deliver them and told me that there were in the cabinet (maybe I could not find it when I stayed in the hotel for the first time). I waited for about half a time. Delivered only hours. Wake up in the morning to wash and find that there is no shaver (previously standard) and let it be sent. Then I was ready to make a cup of black tea to drink, and found that there was no black tea (there was no tea bag). Downstairs for breakfast, the restaurant was full, and had to move to the bar to have breakfast on the high stools. The dishes were not as rich as before. In short, a very bad stay experience.

How about an extra bed? Just remove the desk chair and replace it with a small bed. Don’t you know that the family room can still be operated like this? Is this what a five-star hotel looks like? Because it was too late, I decided to change the hotel the next day.

Breakfast is ok, not very hearty. However, the happy afternoon tea is very powerful, the snacks, cakes and sandwiches provided are delicious, as well as champagne and a variety of soft drinks. You can enjoy a leisurely afternoon.

msg:Stayed for 3 nights in total and the hotel service was speechless when checking out on the last day. It was the first time I met the trea**ent of a chauffeur at St. Regis.
Because we checked out, the luggage was placed in the concierge and waiting for the bus in the lobby. At that time, the rest area on the left side of the lobby was already full of people, so we sat in the rest area on the back. Just sitting down, a service staff in the lobby came over with a menu and asked us if we wanted to consume. I said no, and she immediately said, you can't sit here without consumption. The tone makes people feel really uncomfortable.
First, we are hotel guests, even if we check out, can't we wait in the lobby on the first floor of the hotel?
Second, if there is a consumption area in the rest area of the hotel, you can put a sign directly to indicate that there is no sign, and you can't sit without consumption, the service attitude is bad, and the experience is extremely poor.
Third, it is obviously a rest area, and the left side is full, so the rest of the guests can only stand in the lobby? Can't sit and rest even if the area to your right is empty? Is this the so-called hotel service?
I don't understand where the service of the hotel is reflected? At a price of more than 1,000, although the lobby is full of service staff, it feels like a face-saving effort.
In short, the rushing behavior on the last day makes the experience extremely poor and is not recommended.

msg:Very bad experience! ! ! I booked a suite for 3,300 yuan a night and stayed for two nights in a row. I arrived at the front desk at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. After 20 minutes of check-in, the check-in procedure was not finished. Under my constant urging, the front desk told me that because the room had not been cleaned, I needed to wait at least half an hour! That's why I was so smeared that I couldn't finish the formalities! Haven't you cleaned the hotel I arrived at after five o'clock? Then I ordered at night and the next morning, I ordered five items each time, and I could forget two! The most ridiculous thing is that after leaving the hotel, the hotel called me and said that you were leaving in a hurry. We forgot to give you a gift of a Parma toiletry set. I asked me for the address. The funny thing is that I didn't have time to give it. When the address came out, the woman suddenly changed the conversation and said that this set of gifts needs to be praised by them on Ctrip before they can get it! Did something go wrong? ! What do you think of consumers? ! I tell you this: From my ten years of staying in a 5 star hotel, this hotel was the worst experience of my life! none of them! I will never come back in this life! Service is so bad! I give 0 points!

The engineer came and said that it was broken and many needed overhaul! But don't fix it! There are obvious cracks on the glass in the wine cabinet, but it is still placed for guests...

酒店地庫免費停車，電梯直達大堂，前台服務人員高效專業，對這幾天裏管家 Rain 細緻周到的幫助表示感謝！

msg:酒店位置感覺在手機賣場區，購物不是很方便；可能因為下雨堵車，去周邊景點的車程都在30分鐘左右。
房間很大，寫字枱就有兩張，還有沙發也有很舒適，休息區域是足夠了。電視機是從寫字枱旁邊的槽裏升起來的，感覺離床太近，也容易卡住東西。浴室裏的鑲嵌式小電視根本就不能用，這個應該改進一下及時維護。
因為入住時剛好生日，酒店還送了生日蛋糕，很貼心！

自打決定來成都旅遊，就開始着手酒店預訂，網上看一圈，酒店評論褒貶不一，帶着忐忑的心情決定下單瑞吉。所有美好的體驗從辦理入住開始，一進大堂，就有工作人員熱情相迎，幫忙推行李箱。入住環節不拖沓很高效，隨後來到房間。房間裏很乾凈，衞生間也沒有死角。管家Clytze和Cecilia很貼心的寫了歡迎卡片，為我們準備了歡迎水果，甜品和續住水果。工作人員還耐心的為我們推薦了周邊美食。第二天起床後感覺身體不舒服，管家Clytze和其他工作人員得知後送來了薑糖水和體温計，感覺很貼心。因為攜帶長者和孩子，管家還為我們富餘了退房時間。房間衞生每天都打掃的很仔細，每天外出回來都乾淨整潔。瑞吉還是那個瑞吉，雖然硬件設施會隨着時間正常消耗，但酒店服務因為管家和工作人員的熱情周到依然在線。再來成都的話，還會選擇這裏，萬豪系依然值得信賴。

首先來説服務，一下車就有服務生幫忙搬行李開車門，這點很五星，前台check in也很快，很有禮貌，
特別感謝Hacken和Florence的管家服務，為我們答疑解惑，訂單送飲料等等。
酒店的位置還行，沒有另一家網紅酒店方便，可以出門打車
酒店的早餐，比較單一，品種一般，沒什麼特色，吃2天就沒興趣了。
再説一下環境，酒店總體環境很乾凈衞生，，大大堂有香薰，衹是或許濃烈，估計迎合老外喜歡的濃烈型。
房間的衞生也還不錯，內部感覺是十幾年前的美式裝修風格，電視機很高級，自動升降的，不怎麼方便，晚上回來會貼心的鋪上床邊墊和衞生間防滑布，類似於夜床服務，總體還是很不錯的，來成都還是會考慮住瑞吉。

msg:根據實際打分，分別説明下客觀的評價。
首先，總體來説，還可以，反正這價位基本上也就是買個服務和衞生。所以大體上過得去。

接下來就是要吐槽的。
第一，瑞吉大堂每次走進去一股濃烈的，薰得人發暈的香水味。之前在長沙的瑞吉的味道甚至蔓延到了運達廣場裏面。有香氛ok，但是真的濃到讓人想吐了，實在無法理解。
第二，我們才住十層，洗澡的水壓非常低。水壓低導致水流量少，導致隨便調節一下温度就很燙或者很冷，真的很受不了這種堵塞一樣的淋浴。
第三，非常不理解馬桶每次為什麼沖完水，水位還是那麼高，上廁所非常容易濺到好嗎！
第四，空調聲很大。中央空調的聲音快和吹風機一樣大了，真的夠離譜的。
第五，打掃按了幾次門鈴就會馬上開門進來。這是真的夠無語的，有幾次睡床上，打掃的阿姨在外面按門鈴，又不想起身開門，大聲説不用打掃她也聽不到。然後就直接開門進來了。🙃所以床頭有沒那種可以直接在門口顯示免打擾的東西啊。弄的真的很煩。

msg:這次入住瑞吉酒店感受到了非常貼心的服務 ，因為長者着涼了有點發燒，管家katrina很細心的送來了薑糖水和銀耳羹，有了賓至如歸的感覺。而且從入住到離店，一直很關心我們的情況，這點給瑞吉的入住體驗一下子拉滿。
房間很大，雖然開業不少時間了，但是衞生維護的不錯，下次來成都還會選擇這裏。

缺點：進出洗手間，衹能馬桶蓋總是自動抬起，些許有一點點煩，不過很方便，但是對於男士他衹是抬起了馬桶蓋，但是馬桶圈並沒有抬起，男士小便還要手動抬馬桶圈，有點得不償失；管家式服務感覺就是個名字，沒有太多實質性意義，雖然沒有它服務也挺好的；冰箱裏的飲料和櫃子裏的零食不是免費的，感覺有點小氣；冰箱裏沒有無糖飲料，對不喜甜的和糖尿病患者不友好。
總體上説，是非常好的酒店，是我到成都的首選。

msg:去之前就聽説瑞吉的服務不行，網友還真是靠譜，瑞吉的前台服務的確一般。以下一一點評：

1.我是4/3凌晨一點到的酒店，由於班機延誤，整個人已經虛脱狀態。一進入瑞吉，禮賓也沒有馬上來接手行李，更沒有要送到房間的意思。

2.我由於三天走了五萬步，實在太累了，提出要late checkout到兩點，這一般酒店都會同意，前台竟然毫不考慮拒絕，再我“細緻”溝通後才同意。

3.我們一家三口，有可能會不停時間出門覓食，要求三張房卡，前台再度露出不可思議表情，詢問我，你知道我們不需要取電卡嗎？我回答：你知道我們有三個人嗎？前台才露出恍然大悟表情。。。。

4. 進了房間一股煙味撲鼻而來，赫然發現書桌上有煙灰缸。令帶着青少年和不抽煙的我怒不可竭，打了電話要求換房，客房中心回覆會跟前台處理。等了五分鐘無人理會，憤而下樓親自辦理。本來要對同一個前台發飆，可惜他在接待下一組，幸好另一位前台態度和藹，幫我處理完畢。

簡而言之，瑞吉的服務的確一般，不值這個星。
但是酒店還是不錯，房間很大很舒服，浴室是這次成都九寨溝旅遊最好的。其他的由於衹住一晚，沒能多加體驗。

msg:標間加床需要480元，後來果斷升級了一室一廳，後來發現是個明智的決定。服務和精細程度比其他成都五星級酒店好很多。燈光和舒適度都很好

唯二不足的就是門衞要照顧過往車輛不能及時幫忙拉開玻璃門。入住的人太多，早餐派對，希望做好分流。

msg:瑞吉房間衞生和環境還可以。
但是位置還是離春熙路挺遠的，我前面一天住香格里拉的，夜景美，含2人早餐、含2人當天晚餐自助，才1450元真是超值。以為瑞吉酒店離太古裏和lfs近才選的，房價高1300多元一晚都不含早餐、性價比超低，如果是來旅遊建議全季酒店和美居，皇冠假日都近春熙路吧（真實評價，不想要所謂的贈品😃，我就是被小紅書上騙來的）

選擇的是家庭親子房，房間很NICE，雖然感覺是大號大床房加了個床，但酒店在各個細節方面做得還是很到位的，靜音的門鎖，隱藏的電視機和國際頻道，不錯的視野，人性化的整體燈光設定，乾濕分離的衞生間，牆噴的淋浴噴頭……不一而足，在硬件配置和細節上值得肯定。
在軟件和服務上，早餐位於4樓，菜品種類不是最多，但該有的都有，整體味道也不錯，還有冰淇淋加分。唯一美中不足的是2天用餐都要排隊，建議可以適當增加運能。
入住的時候説是有管家服務的，不過由於家庭出遊早出晚歸，沒有很好體驗相關的服務，禮賓部的行李運輸和代寄快遞很實用，前台的辦理入住和退房的手續也很迅速高效，Bella和Addy的態度很親切，服務也很到位。
整體是一次愉快的入住，下次來成都還會考慮入住。

服務：我跟朋友帶兩個娃成都行，晚上到達瑞吉，到門口就有服務人員主動過來幫忙拉行李，開門，引導辦理入住。辦理入住的小妹妹還主動給我們做了房間升級，還有專人給我們把行李送到房間，並給我們主動提供了小童洗漱用品套裝非常貼心。另外每天都可以按需提供牛奶咖啡直接送至房間，味道不錯哦。礦泉水也足量供應。
房間：房間很大，70平米左右。兩個1.5的床，還有一個小客廳，另有一個大辦公桌，空間很不合理。洗漱區分為三個區域，淋浴間、廁所間和洗手間（含浴缸）。
另外游泳池看上去特別棒，但因為時間問題沒有去享受，可惜了。
此次特別感謝chloe和andy，還有很多不知道姓名小同志們。

當初選這家酒店就是希望能安安靜靜休息，然後you have it.

健身房點贊👍，器械特別齊全，外面天氣冷，就在酒店跑了個酸爽。

被早餐的Croissant和晚上床頭的糖 甜到了，西點師傅太棒了，做出了讓人吃出幸福感的食物。

成都 成都 真是個充滿善意的城市。

第一次住瑞吉也想提一點小意見，電話裏也和前台小姐姐溝通過，覺得早餐這塊還有進步的空間。還有員工的培訓也可以加強～我第一天下錯了樓層，問了一個酒店服務人員，她居然不知道餐廳在幾樓😂。其他都挺滿意的～

除了第一天入住的時候送了2套小童洗漱用品，後面兩天也是沒有！前提這個東西是你們告訴我提供的！不是我們自己硬要的！夜床也是開的莫名其妙第一次見到衹開一半的？
因為我的腳被鞋磨破了我就穿着拖鞋被告知不能出入早餐廳！這個是我的問題我接受畢竟用早餐的地方可能會影響到別人！但是為什麼女生穿着睡衣就可以出入了？早餐排隊排了快20分鐘也是沒誰了！入住期間除了門僮和晚上送牛奶的小哥哥很優秀，其他真的是很糟糕很有優越感的樣子！
妥妥的大冤種下次真的不會再去了！
