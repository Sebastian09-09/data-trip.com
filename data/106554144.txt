msg:The best boutique hotel in Shandong Province. It is built on a cliff, so the view from the window is very beautiful. As it is located on a cliff, the road up is very difficult, but the view upon arrival is worth the effort (the hotel also provides transportation). When you arrive at the hotel lobby, everyone greets you with a smile and the staff here, who show you to your room, also greet you with a bright smile every time you meet them. One wall of the room was built to resemble an actual cliff, and the props show that great care was taken. However, it is a bit inconvenient because the bathroom is open. The restaurant isn't that big, but it's clean, and the woman who appears to be the manager is very friendly and seems to have a good understanding of wine. All of the ingredients on the dinner menu were fresh and the food was very delicious. Several activities are included, so be sure to try them!! The swimming pool has clean water and a nice view.

Needless to say, the location is the center of the entire scenic area and is very close to the glass bridge. The recreational projects in the scenic area are also very good. It is worth praising that the room we booked only includes recreational projects for two adults, and the hotel gave us recreational projects for two children. The dinner for two people is just right for two adults and two children, enough to eat, and very exquisite. The hotel's sightseeing car can take you anywhere, and the driver is also very friendly. It was a very good and special experience, and the whole family felt very good.

There was a heavy spring snow the night before we left, and we thought we couldn't get down the mountain. As a result, when we got up early in the morning, the scenic area began to organize snow removal, and the way down the mountain was unobstructed. It is really worth experiencing and feeling by everyone~ The only drawback is that the swimming pool would be more perfect if the dressing room was equipped with a wardrobe

Dawn breakfast for two: I ordered Chinese and Western breakfast with my son, which was exquisite and delicious. It was so happy.
The sunset dinner was also rich and delicious, and every dish was gorgeous. It was a pity that we went too late and didn't see the beautiful sunset. Although the location of the hotel is steep, it was a very happy experience. The housekeeper took us to visit the cave room of the hotel. It was very impressive. Each room type is unique. I really want to experience them all. I will definitely go back to experience it when spring comes. The hotel carefully prepared fruits, desserts, bread and water for the guests on the way to parting. It was a very pleasant stay. Thank you to every staff member who entertained us.

msg:The whole trip to Shandong ended perfectly with this wild luxury hotel in Zibo. During the 3-day and 2-night stay, I experienced 3 different scenery (① a fairyland surrounded by clouds and mist in the mountains; ② surrounded by mountain scenery in sunny autumn; ③ a silver ice and snow world flashing)

I stayed in the 3F cliff suite with excellent outdoor view (the hotel lobby is on the 5F, and the guest rooms are sunken and unfolded in sequence). The suite has a 270-degree floor-to-ceiling glass window. You can sit and drink coffee and enjoy the cliff scenery without going out. It's amazing! Go up the indoor stairs to the upper floor is a tea room with an outdoor terrace, where you can see the "Beauty Peak" up close.

The dinner brought by the hotel during the stay was very good. The agricultural and sideline products produced by the own farm combined with Shandong Lu cuisine made exquisite dishes, and there was no repetition in two days.

There are also special pick-up and drop-off vehicles to go to various nearby attractions, which are nice! During the off-season, the manager was arranged to take us on a tour of the hotel in the afternoon. For example, the hotel's largest cliff suite (200+ square meters) comes with a private independent kitchen; the cave room where the hotel's most expensive furniture, the "Chieftain Chair" (600w), is located; and the cave room with the most unique view in the hotel (with its own courtyard pavilion "Beauty Peak" within reach).

I used to think that good hotels were in the south, but this trip overturned my perception. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I searched for this boutique hotel when Zibo was hot. It looks very unique. From the location to the decoration style, I can't imagine that the wall is a cliff, so my husband's birthday came. From the communication when I checked in, to the warm service from the heart of the housekeeper, to the beautiful scenery outside the window when I entered the hotel, the shocking design and decoration, to the high quality of the hotel supplies and restaurant products, it is indeed worthy of being a home away from home. I hope everyone can come to the mountains to be a fairy for a day~~~~

The attractions in the scenic area are relatively simple, there is almost no entertainment in the hotel, there is not even a basic gym, and the meals are even more ordinary. The prawns for dinner are not fresh. The hardware and software conditions at this price are hard to understand. It is incomparable to Banyan Tree, and it is several levels lower.

msg:The hotel has a great view. You can see beautiful scenery in the restaurant and cliff room.
After arriving at the hotel, there was a vacancy, so I paid extra to upgrade to a deluxe room. (It is recommended to upgrade if you have the spare money, the sense of space will be much more relaxed.
The hotel is on the top of the mountain in the scenic area. It is very convenient to ask for a sightseeing bus to pick you up for free in the scenic area, but I personally recommend hiking from the glass plank road to the speed skating track and rafting. The hiking time is about half an hour, and the scenery is very beautiful.
If you insist on saying that there may be places to avoid, it is that sometimes there will be small insects (the ecological environment of the scenic area is too good, there are many small insects, and the butterfly is super big). If you are afraid of insects, be mentally prepared.
I wish to experience the cave room next time~
Anyway, staying here will make people feel: this money is worth it. Haha.

Traveling from the top of Xingshan Mountain to the downstream is not tiring and does not turn back. The scenery and beauty coexist. The hotel room card can play unlimited times in the projects in the scenic area

Simply make some comments and suggestions
1. There are too few lights on the sink, and the face is dark when washing, which is not friendly to women
2. There is only one trash can next to the toilet in the room
3. The temperature in the mountains should be considered. It is best to control the air conditioning, heating and cooling independently
4. The quality of shampoo and shower gel is slightly lower

msg:The most comfortable hotel experience in recent years, bar none.
1. Before I came here, I was always afraid that it was an internet celebrity attraction and that if the product was not right, I would have to use a filter. It was already late at night when we arrived on the first day. When I opened the window at around 6 o'clock in the morning, I was instantly shocked by the scenery in front of me. The photos of sunset restaurants, cliff views and other photos displayed by the store are basically the same as reality.
2. The quality of the free breakfast and dinner in the hotel is very high. As a veteran gourmet who has eaten all over Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, I feel that the taste of this restaurant is not inferior to most high-end restaurants.
3. My friends had a great time in the hotel’s infinity swimming pool and it was very exciting. Other accommodation environments are very warm and a**ospheric, because you can see endless mountain views from any angle from the windows.
4. The service is very good. The hotel's side manager picked us up and dropped us off many times. He made us feel at home with all kinds of thoughtful considerations.
5. If you want to rest during your free time in the future, you will definitely stay here again for a few weeks.

The hotel is located in the scenic spot, it is very distinctive, rock walls can be seen everywhere in the room, the facilities are very new, and the service staff are polite and attentive. The fly in the oin**ent is that the level of the restaurant is average. The breakfast is in the form of a set meal, and there is not much to eat, which is not suitable for a hotel at this price.
If you get up early, you can visit the scenic spot directly. There are few people and the environment is good, so you don’t have to go back. At the bottom of the mountain, take the ferry back. All kinds of tickets and tickets in the scenic area are included in the room rate, and no additional consumption is required.
ps Gaode navigation remember not to navigate the hotel directly, you will enter the particularly difficult wild road, navigate the scenic spot directly, and there will be staff to pick you up after arriving at the scenic spot.

       潭溪山景區夏天本身就山清水秀的，還有漂流和玻璃棧道等娛樂項目，在景區裏出示酒店房卡，所有項目都不用再額外付費了；
       由於酒店的定位是一家野奢酒店，所以體量很小，總共就16間客房（8間崖壁房間和8間洞穴房間），我這次住的是崖壁客房。其實從照片就能看出來，崖壁客房直接嵌在了一面崖壁上，所以房間裏的一面牆就是天然的山體。房間裏的細節也很到位，反正在我住過的位於山區的酒店裡，它是唯一一家每個房間都配備了遮陽帽和登山杖的酒店。還有房間裏面能照到風景的那麪鏡子我也非常喜歡；
       整個酒店的頂部是一個直升飛機停機坪，這是現在野奢酒店的標配了。同時這裏也是整個潭溪山景區的制高點，四周都沒有遮擋，可以看到很美的日出和日落；
       淄博是非遺文化琉璃的起源地，所以酒店也將在地文化融入其中，據説淄博原來出品的琉璃製品多以蔬菜造型為主，現在則越來越時尚。酒店也會不定期邀請琉璃技藝的非遺傳承人來教授課程；
       酒店房費裏面是包含晚餐的，雖然不是魯菜為主，但畢竟是沿海大省，在這裏可以實現鮑魚自由～雖然是間小體量的酒店，但還是設計了一間酒吧，度假氛圍直接拉滿，晚上可以來喝一杯，吧枱上部的造型融入了春秋戰國時期的兵馬元素，感覺整個酒店的設計者還是很花心思的。

msg:清川屬於野奢酒店，十大野奢之一、還是值得體驗的。説一下我和先生帶着孩子（6歲）長者（70歲）三天兩晚的入住體驗吧！
入住當天已是晚8點了，還趕上了山裡的大雨。山道崎嶇非常不好開。建議大家下午之前入住，畢竟6k的房價。晚上入住還是有些浪費的。工作人員還是值得表揚的，前台的小姐姐很可愛、餐廳的小格格很勤快很認真、負責的前廳經理也是個小哥哥，為人也是率真健談，比較為客人客人着想。聽得進去建議和意見。從交談中得知酒店的出資人是當地人，為建設家鄉投資建設懸崖酒店。不論當地就業和道路都做出了很大的努力。
美中不足，在住店期間發生了一點小插曲。雖已解決，但感受到了酒店開業時間短暫、人員不足、經驗不足、缺少服務意識和缺少快速解決客訴的經驗（和同價位酒店相比較）
酒店的地理位置決定了建設成本，所以想要拔草的客人應該不會被價格嚇退，但是肯定也會對員工的服務有要求的，所以希望後期這塊可以跟上。
房型的話對長者和小孩都不是特別友好，畢竟不是親子類酒店，個人建議10歲以下小童的話，家長還是需要精心照看。畢竟房間構造稜稜角角、保留的自然巖石景觀和樓梯類甚多。所以小朋友的家長們要注意啦。避免磕碰，當然了酒店定位並不是為小孩子準備的，但畢竟不拒絕家庭形式客人，還是應該多叮囑。多標識✅
因為房間挑高很高（估計有5米）面積90平米左右，所以選擇了給長者+床，住在一起。但是很失誤的決定，實話實説沒有這麼差加床體驗了。1.2米很薄很薄的一個墊子，跟床完全沒有任何干係（800元）大多數酒店或者套房都有加床服務，幾百元不等，但絕對不會有這麼薄的墊子鋪在那、所以這樣服務0分。但是轉天服務人員也給想辦法弄了兩層，算是加厚了一點點。要不真的…無法理解這是加了800元的床。
泳池的話！好看！但水温實在不敢恭維，畢竟是山裡麪，崖壁旁，個人覺得應該提高水温。除非正午，不然很難下水，小心感冒😷。
餐食還是可圈可點的，住的三天兩晚基本把餐廳的菜單嚐了一遍，沒有特別吐槽的菜品。深山裡的食材運輸難度大。價格也很良心了。衹是早點希望改進一下，中餐、廣餐、西餐三種選擇。都試過以後可以很負責任的説，選擇中餐吧。其餘兩種還可以，但是沒有中餐豐富。尤其廣餐，可能真的有點….不那麼盡人情😅都是一些預製菜品吧。大多數餐品都是廚師精心調配的。
總體來説，值得體驗。但是側面瞭解到清川的房價從開業至今確實也是一直在往下降，所以大家也可以在觀測觀測。如果各方面細節能再提升一些的話可能會再次選擇入住。畢竟在羣山峻嶺中，天然氧吧。温度舒適，難得放空。

msg:這是非常優秀的酒店和旅遊項目，目前的價格和知名度都被嚴重低估，絕對物超所值。如果開在一線城市，價格翻三倍不説，日日爆滿絕對沒有問題。潭溪山人很少，同時體驗到東亞風格更愜意舒心的服務和國外景點人少空靈的景觀體驗。漂流、高空橋很值得體驗，酒店的泳池每次使用的時候都衹有我們自己，可以説是與出國無異了。

個人認為擺渡車的服務不夠積極，這一點確實需要改進
