msg:The hotel was a great choice! They go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. Check in and check out is speedy. The staff is very respectful and friendly! The room is spacious and the bed is like a cloud. Breakfast is rich and there are many different varieties of both Western and Chinese cuisine.  There is a beach across the street.
I traveled with a baby and they brought her free toys every single day to make sure she had something new to play with each day. 
Thank you, Seaview Garden Hotel! I hope to stay again!

msg:This is a mixed review for me. On one hand, we paid for a Seaview that had a building blocking 80% of our view.  When we asked to change rooms, they gave us a run around and told us to deal with it. We contacted ctrip, and quickly got a room with a better view. From that point they were pretty kind and courteous. Afterwards, we went to the Hawaiian BBQ restaurant that is affiliated with the hotel. We could only stay there an hour as they were closing. My girlfriend and I had one beer apiece, along with two plates of cold kebabs as they didn‚Äôt want to heat anything else. We would have eaten more, but there was no food. When the bill came, it was 572.  That was surprising to say the least. Throughout the days to come, we realize that all of the restaurants were quite expensive. So when we looked at their room service selection, we were happy as it appeared to be less expensive. Each meal, we bought no more than 300 worth. And we only ate four times while we were there.ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº  The bill came out to 4300. I don‚Äôt know where their additional expenses came from.  The hotel offered quite a few amenities, but we were busy exploring the city. Please not they have very slow room service. However, besides our initial interaction, all of the staff were kind and warm, It is therefore that I say that it was a mixed review. And I hope that this helps someone when deciding to stay.ÔøºÔøºÔøº

msg:The review was posted by mistake, so I took a screenshot and put it in the last picture. Anyway, the first place is not false. It is the hotel that I am most satisfied with among the three hotels I booked this time. I will book this hotel again next time. The hotel has grilled durian buffet at night, and you can eat it as much as you want without restrictions. If you like it, just go for it. There are two children's slides, suitable for children aged 1-7, and there is also a place to watch movies and cartoons. The location is excellent, and the beach is just across the road.

msg:I traveled with my elders and children and came to the familiar Qingdao again. I stayed in Seaview Garden for the first time and booked two days in a row. It was so comfortable! Wheat Island Park is not far away from the opposite side. You can walk there after breakfast at the hotel. The hotel provides strollers and the breakfast is super rich. The children and family praised it. When I left my clothes at the hotel, I immediately contacted them to send them home. It felt like home. The toiletries are all made in China and the mineral water is from Laoshan. The details are really full of a sense of belonging. Every day, the children are given small dolls and conch shells. The children were very happy to receive them and said they would take them back to their good friends! It happened to be my birthday and the hotel also gave me a cake. The six-inch cake should be freshly made, especially attentive! Looking forward to my next trip to Qingdao~

msg:After comparing a lot of hotels online, I finally chose Qingdao Seaview Garden Hotel. I have to say that there is a reason why so many people recommend it. When we took a taxi to the hotel entrance, a doorman opened the door for us. The service was very good. He led us into the lobby very considerately. When we entered the lobby to check in, the front desk lady brought us black tea and a small snack. These thoughtful actions are very heartwarming. The lady asked us if we drove here. The hotel provides free car washing services, which is very friendly to people who drive. We asked the front desk lady if we could get a room with a sea view. At that time, the room had not been cleaned up. The lady was very considerate and chose a room with a large sea view for us. We went early, about 10:30, and the room was cleaned very quickly. It was cleaned up around 11 o'clock, which was very efficient.
When I entered the room, I was very surprised. The area was really super large, and the view of the sea was very good. The room number was 2801. The sloping roof window felt very interesting. I liked it very much. Then there were welcome fruits in the room (two apples üçé, two pears üçê, two oranges üçä). There were 4 bottles of drinks in the minibar, and there seemed to be 6 bottles of mineral water. The hotel was very a**ospheric, and the hotel prepared everything very well. The slippers were also very textured. Shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion were all in small bottles, which were very convenient to take away. It was very considerate. There was a large bathtub, and 2 packs of bath salts. The bathing experience was very good. The hotel also prepared disposable bathtub sets. What I didn't expect was that there were two packs of washing powder and soap, and two wash basins, which were very suitable for two people to wash at the same time without wasting time. The hotel has carefully considered the small things such as razors, combs, cotton swabs, and makeup remover cotton for customers, which I am very satisfied with. After entering the room, the room service asked us if we needed a doll. I thought it was only given to children with children, but I didn't expect it to be given to adults. It was two cute little whales. üê≥ 
Next, let's talk about the lunch part. We ordered a buffet for two. There are many types of buffets, such as the more expensive durian and foie gras, which are unlimited, and salmon is also available. Then the ice cream was Haagen-Dazs, which was very delicious. I ate a lot. The fruits included strawberries, jackfruit, longan, hawthorn, grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon, pear, and orange. I have to say that the lunch experience was very good. We sat at table 38, and the waiter was right next to us. He cleaned up the food in a timely manner. Then for breakfast, we went to have breakfast at around 8 o'clock. I felt that this time was not too late, but when we went there, we felt that many things were already less. The replenishment was not very timely, but it was enough to eat. You can try the characteristics of Shandong, such as Linyi millet soup, spicy soup, sweet foam, etc. When you come to the hotel, you can't miss the free gym, swimming pool, and sauna. When we went there, it was off-season, and there was no one in the swimming pool. The swimming pool was quite small. After all, this hotel has a long history. As long as the hygiene is good, it feels OK. Then there was no one in the sauna room. I went in to experience dry steaming and wet steaming, which felt pretty good. I strongly recommend sisters with children to travel with their children. There are many children's amusement facilities on the negative first floor, with a wide variety of activities. You can also watch movies, which is especially suitable for energetic babies. There is a beach opposite the hotel. We saw tents set up next to the beach. It should be the equipment provided by the hotel. It feels quite cost-effective. Then there are also activities for adults to play on the negative first floor, such as billiard hall, chess and card room, and table tennis hall, but these are charged, 70 yuan per hour, depending on personal needs. Choose as appropriate. It is worth mentioning that it was my friend's birthday on the day I stayed in the hotel, and then we asked the hotel if we could send a bowl of longevity noodles. The hotel agreed very readily. This move made people feel very heartwarming, because my friend's birthday did not match the date on the ID card. I thought the hotel would refuse, but the hotel agreed very readily, and the meal was delivered quickly. Give the hotel a thumbs up. In general, this experience is very satisfactory. A good hotel can greatly improve people's favorability towards this place. The hotel is located in a place where you can see the sea, so you won't feel bored staying in the hotel all day. The hotel's Haidilao-style service makes people feel at home. If I come to Qingdao again in the future, I will choose this hotel again. I recommend it very much‚ù§Ô∏è

The bathroom, washing and shower were all separate, and there was a large bathtub, and a disposable bath set for the bathtub was also provided. Although it was a garden-view room, the balcony could see the sea, which was very nice. There were a full range of children's products, good sound insulation, plenty of bottled water and drinks in the room, and a small refrigerator, which was very clean. Service: The hotel service details were very in place. Bottled water was available in the hotel lobby and corridors for guests to take. The public bathrooms were also equipped with hand towels. Takeaway incubators and sand digging tools for children were available at the lobby door. Entertainment: Because it was Children's Day, the hotel also had many activities. There were two amusement parks on the underground floor to satisfy children and adults to play, a small cinema and a billiard hall. Environment: The hotel environment is very good and clean. There is a beach right outside the hotel. You can catch a lot of crabs, conches and fish. It is really a paradise for children. Food and Beverage: There are so many varieties of breakfast that you can't eat them all. The hotel also has 3 restaurants with Qingdao cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, and seafood buffet. In summary, it is great! !

They sent me a notebook after I checked out. However, if the butler who receives you is an experienced and enthusiastic one, I guess the stay experience should be better. This time we just heated the milk before bedtime. I called to ask for the shells that the baby wanted. The north-facing room faces a big pit, which is really a sight. The first room smelled of cigarettes. The one we changed to was much better. The hotel is just across the road from the beach. If the weather is good, the scenery should be good. I recommend going to the swimming pool. Although it is small, it is filtered seawater, which is quite interesting.

msg:I learned about this hotel from a public account. I did some research and booked it with some trepidation. In the end, I found that it was worth investing in it and I would come again if I had the chance.

Location and transportation:
It is a little far from the subway station, but very close to the beach. It is across a road and you can walk to Xiaomai Island and Yaner Island.

Room view:
The sea view room you live in has a perfect view of the sea. Sitting on the balcony, looking at the sea, eating, and feeling very happy.

Breakfast:
There are many types of breakfast, and the taste is okay. It is not a weekend, so there are not many people, and there is no need to wait for a seat.

Room facilities:
There are many details in the room. The bathtub has a disposable bag, the spare parts have washing powder, and the children have special toiletries. They have all the supplies you can think of; there are two children's playgrounds according to age groups. The place where children play has equipment for all ages, and the place where big children play is also very challenging.

Service:
The service is the most praiseworthy thing about Seaview Garden Hotel. In fact, this hotel is a bit old, and the overall style is also old style, but the service is very ceiling, so many people recommend them.

Very detailed information is provided from the moment you check in. Someone will show you to the room, welcome you with fruit drinks and toys for children. If you need anything, you can just call and they will respond immediately. When you walk in the hotel, the staff are very warm and greet you. The plastic table on the balcony was burned when eating takeout, and we contacted the staff to check it out, but they didn't ask for compensation. I was really embarrassed to come here.

msg:Location: I booked a business sea view room in advance, and upgraded to an executive sea view room after arriving at the front desk. The room is clean, with a small balcony to sit and look at the sea in the distance (but you can't watch the sunrise and sunset because it faces south). You can cross the road from the hotel to the seaside wooden boardwalk, which is convenient for children to go to the beach to dig sand and pick up shells, and visit Yanershan Island Park.
Service: Warm and thoughtful, giving the baby a small plush gift, and the room staff are also warm and polite.
Facilities: Mainly considering bringing the baby to stay, there is a children's play area on the first floor of the hotel, which can kill some time.
The overall environment is comfortable, and the hotel arranges a seafood buffet, and the dishes are also good. The overall stay feels good!

msg:The most comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in. I booked it based on the reviews of good service, especially when traveling with children. I really need a hotel with good service and child-friendly. This time it exceeded my expectations. The most satisfying thing about this trip is staying in this hotel. Compared with the super five-star hotels with luxurious decoration and no strict service, Seaview Garden is so comfortable. I can't take away those high-end hardware. The soft service is the most popular, especially for me who travels with children. I solved a lot of troubles. All the requirements raised during the stay were met. It was not an unreasonable request, but it was indeed only this hotel that could do it among hotels of the same price.
There were many people during the May Day holiday, but I observed that the service was not inadequate. What impressed me was not just leaving a handwritten note, but inadvertently, there was no seat for breakfast. A small table for two people was originally arranged. When I went in, a large table next to it had just left. The supervisor immediately told the guests to sit here for more comfort and moved here, instead of arranging for maximum benefits. I understand.
When I took my child to swim, I was shivering because I had to take a bath towel when I got ashore. The service staff immediately handed over a warm bath towel, which was just a timely help.
The daily cleaning is very active, and the cleaning will not be delayed because of check-out the next day. Welcome fruits are also provided every day, not just once on the first day of check-in.
Of course, there are some imperfections, but they are all within an acceptable range. The only point is that the May Day premium is a bit high. In short, I am very satisfied and will stay here again when I come to Qingdao in the future.

The room hygiene is also unsatisfactory. When checking in, I was told that the room was not cleaned well and I needed to wait. It is understandable during peak hours, and it should be cleaned even if it is urgent. I didn't experience the double sauna, nor did I use the subway pick-up station. In short, the feeling is average. For a price of thousands of yuan, good service alone is not enough to attract people.

The service was completely beyond my expectations. Every staff member was so serious and responded to the questions as soon as possible.
The most touching thing was that the 4-year-old baby suddenly developed acute mumps and laryngitis at 2 a.m., and I anxiously consulted the staff on duty at the front desk. The brother took our whole family to the Children's Hospital without saying a word. Parents should know how anxious it is to see a sick baby in a strange city. It's okay to see a doctor in time. I really thank my colleagues at Seaview Garden. The restaurant manager also found us in the morning to ask about the baby's condition.
Later, when I was on the road, I talked to the taxi driver, and he also proudly said that this is our local Pang Donglai.

It is worth mentioning that the car we rented was clean for 6 days because the hotel master would clean the cars parked in the yard one by one in the morning. The service is really as good as the ceiling level said on the Internet.
[Friendly with children] You can watch movies on the underground first floor of the hotel, and children can play slides and games. It is also easy to take care of children in the hotel at night after being tired during the day. In addition, the hotel will send small dolls or small shells to the children every day. When we left, the children packed a large bag themselves. üòÇ
[Quiet Location] The hotel is in a very quiet location. Crossing the road is Yaner Island. You can directly check in the Internet celebrity Yaner Cave by taking a walk. It is not far from Xiaomai Island. If you want to go to the area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãZhanqiao Xiaoyu Mountain, take a taxi for 20 minutes without traffic jams.
[Breakfast] The hotel has a rich breakfast. We usually eat more breakfast, bring some fruit snacks to eat in the scenic area at noon, and have a full meal in the evening.

After parking for one night, there is a special person to wash the car in the morning, which makes people feel good. 2. From the entrance, there has been a special service to help look after the children, carry things, and guide the service. It is very considerate. Check-in is very fast. A very beautiful manager led us to the room and introduced the room to us. She also gave us a lot of dolls. The child experience is super good! And a very cute little sister also brought a small doll to the child for an extra bed, and the child was very happy! 3. Drinks are filled at any time when you check in, which is very considerate. The underground playground satisfies the child's experience in the hotel. It's more than 8 o'clock in the evening. I have to go to the underground playground to play until 9 o'clock to close and return to the room. 4. The buffet is great! Needless to say, there are many types of breakfast, but the reservation is very full, and you need to keep looking for a seat. This was not informed in advance. We were always rushed with the plate in the morning, which was very embarrassing. The lunch buffet was very good before, but I didn't make an appoin**ent this time.
I will make a repeat reservation when I come to Qingdao.

First of all, I was very satisfied with the service! The staff was very considerate! They took the initiative to help with the luggage and made it clear that no tips were accepted.
Snacks, hot towels and black tea were provided when checking in! It made the check-in less boring. When entering the room, the staff introduced enthusiastically... and prepared welcome fruits and tea. When I came back in the evening, they had prepared snacks and closed the curtains.
Secondly, the scenery and location are also very good. Going downstairs is the beach, and the sand is soft and clean! It is very convenient to go out and drive to any place.
I was so satisfied that I stayed again the next day! After learning that we had climbed Laoshan, the butler prepared a foot bath bucket for us! Everything made me feel very humane! It added points to my impression of Qingdao!

The last time I remember that the service of one guest and one luggage delivery was in a hotel in Japan in 2019.
Although the decoration is old, it gives people a very clean feeling, and a sense of security that everything can be used with confidence.
The two rooms booked are of different room types. The front desk brother upgraded one of them for our convenience. At the front desk, I said that I needed to put the bed together, and there was already a waiter operating it in the room. After arriving in the room, I needed various things. Three or four groups of people came and went, delivering tea, stools, and express delivery... Every time they came with small gifts, fruits or children's toys.
Every detail can reflect the management in place and human touch.
And the hotel is across the road from the beach. If you come in summer, you should not have to go to the beach to squeeze in the crowd.
In short, it is an impeccable hotel in terms of service.

Although the room we booked is not a real sea view room, we can still see the distant view. Due to time constraints, I only stayed for one night, but it felt really good.

Because I didn‚Äôt check carefully when I left in the morning, I left the same charger. I found it when the hotel was cleaning at noon, so I called and asked to send it.

There were itinerary reminders and confirmation calls throughout the process. The buffet is also great, with many varieties, fresh ingredients and good taste. They also reserved a seat by the window for us in advance, so we can enjoy the garden view while eating. The decoration style of the room is also pleasing to the eye, warm and luxurious. There are customers' names on the TV welcome screen, and heart-warming reminder cards are everywhere in the room.

msg:So disappointing, is this really a five-star hotel? The hotel room facilities are old beyond imagination, the mattress is hard and not elastic, the bathroom is as small as a bathroom, and the shower head is jaw-dropping. Alas, the only thing left is the service. In fact, the service is not outstanding. There is no butler who can add WeChat. The reviews say it is the Haidilao service in the hotel, which is really an exaggeration. I have stayed at Haitian and MGM, and the service is better. The swimming pool is even more unspeakable. It's dilapidated. It's made of sea water. It's so busy that everyone spits in the pool all the time. My business sea view room is facing the blue roof of the front building, and most of the sea view is blocked. I originally booked for three nights, but I couldn't stand it anymore. I stayed for one night and checked out early and moved to MGM. The only saving grace is the breakfast, which is really good and rich, but there are too few coffee machines, only two, and you need to queue up. The breakfast fee is 100 yuan for adults, 50 yuan for 130 to 150 yuan, and free for those below 130 yuan.
After I left the store, I called back and said I would mail a gift to express my apology, but I really wanted to give a true review.

Because you are traveling with a baby, it is inevitable that you will need help when you need it. The hotel will consider almost every detail for you. When I booked the hotel, I made a note to help put the bed together, and it was already set up when I checked in. The welcome fruit when you first checked in was very fresh and delicious. Not only were regular disposable supplies provided, but also washing powder was provided to facilitate laundry. As soon as you check in, the hotel staff will proactively inform you of the location of various facilities and restaurants, as well as what is free and what is charged in the room. Every staff member you meet at the front desk, restaurant or corridor is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to help you if you need it.
The soundproofing of the room is also good. As long as you don't shout in the corridor, it is basically quiet. Later, because the child needed to take a nap, the hotel helped us delay check-out for a few hours. Thank you very much.
If there are any shortcomings, firstly, the hotel has been open for many years. There are no sockets at the bedside, so charging is a little inconvenient. Secondly, the children's playground is a little dirty, and the age divisions are not particularly clear. Children's playgrounds often have There are older children running around. It is estimated that many tourists come here for the children's paradise, so they should pay attention.
I will choose Sea View again if I have the chance.

The staff passing by asked about the situation and contacted the car owner several times but no one answered the phone. The hotel staff contacted colleagues at various work stations and everyone worked together. Working together, we moved the parked car to the side! !

The little friends will enjoy themselves. The hotel's buffet is as good as ever and can cater for people with various dietary needs. To my surprise, the egg yolk crisps, flower cakes and chocolate cookies in the dinner buffet are particularly delicious and are all freshly baked. I didn't get to wash my car this time, which was a bit regretful, maybe because the weather was too cold. Of course, the hotel has shortcomings.

After checking in in the afternoon, I took the children to the children's playground on the first floor. The children had a great time. I think there are two children's playgrounds, divided into adults and children, which are very user-friendly.

Areas that can be improved:
The parking lot is crowded when there are many people. It is a holiday and the traffic flow is relatively heavy, which is understandable.
The hotel's buffet has a long queue. If you plan to dine in the evening or in the morning, remember to make a reservation in advance.

msg:After driving through the long highway and going around and around, we finally arrived in Qingdao city. It gets dark early in Qingdao in the off-season. By five o'clock, the highway can no longer be seen clearly. On some sections of the road, one can only rely on taxi high beams and white or yellow lights in the distance to detect the surroundings. Many of my impressions of foreign cities come from books and textbooks. I imagined Qingdao to be gentle. In fact, during the three days I came here, the word "gentle" still appeared in my mind from time to time, and I could feel the romance and tranquility of the seaside city. The city color of Qingdao, I always think is orange. The hotel we rented is located on the seaside of Changhua Road in Shinan District. The houses in the hotel complex are also orange-red with a strong Qingdao color, or colonial color.
The price of the hotel during the time we went was much more tolerant compared to the peak season. The hotel's sincere and dedicated service is surprising, of course I heard about it before coming here. From the contact and holiday arrangements made by the housekeeper Wang Lina before arriving at the hotel, the considerate service of the hotel staff in the drop-off area, the arrangements made by the customer service at the hotel front desk, and the smiles of many people you meet, all tell you the goodwill of this hotel. The management of the hotel is one side, and I don't think the goodwill that can be released in everyone's eyes is deceiving. The next morning I went for a swim in the hotel's indoor swimming pool and found that I had forgotten to bring my swimming goggles in my busy schedule. After the hotel staff told me that I needed to go to the store to buy it, I declined. He walked out with a bang, came back with the swimming goggles of the swimming pool instructor, and said softly that he could lend them to me. Perhaps it is this kindness from my brother that makes me like this place even more.
Although I had my initial impression of Qingdao, my feeling about this city was still unfamiliar and one-sided. During the afternoon, I strolled along the beach with my lover. Apart from the bustling piers, old colonial addresses, or some man-made attractions, the long beach line did not have the bustle of people coming and going in the summer. It was cold, and most people went back to rest after nightfall, and the earth returned to calm. Maybe I won‚Äôt come here often in the next few years, but this time has created a lot of pleasant memories, and I am still grateful in my heart.

From the "top hat doorman" you meet when you enter the hotel courtyard to the handsome man and pretty girl who greets you, to the front desk and floor service staff, the service attitude of the hotel staff you encounter is really first-rate.
There is also a children's playground and children's theater on the ba*****t floor. Children staying in the hotel and families from the city who came to eat had a great time. Yesterday I also saw the "Thanksgiving" craft nest activity organized by the hotel specifically for children...
The adult swimming pool has purified seawater, is hygienic and smells like the sea. It is a good pool for swimming all year round.
The hotel faces the sea and has ample parking spaces in the courtyard and underground.
Fruit in the lobby 24 hours a day is so considerate and rare!

msg:About check-in:

First of all, let me criticize myself. I booked the wrong date. I found out when the lady at the front desk took the initiative to contact me. After explaining the reason, she readily helped me change the date.


About the service:

I heard from the local driver that the service in Seaview Garden is one of the best. The online taxi we took drove all the way to the entrance of the lobby. Before the door was opened, the concierge came to help with the luggage immediately. I immediately felt at home. The ladies were very gentle and quickly opened the room. On the way in the morning, the concierge went with us and the reception girl explained along the way. There are also fruits, drinks, welcome refreshments, everything you need. There was a cold wind during the day. When I came back at night, I tried to ask the front desk if there was any cold medicine, and it was delivered to the guest room within two minutes.

About decoration:

When I booked the room, I was a little confused between the Haitian and Seaview Garden. Now I feel that I made the right choice. It is the decoration style that I like. It is warm and romantic. If you like to take pictures, it is beyond photos! (ps: I like the bathroom the most. It‚Äôs the bathroom of my dreams, hahahaha.)

About the location:

Just across the road from the hotel entrance is the seaside. The scenery is very good, especially when the sea breeze blows at three or four o'clock in the afternoon. It's really enjoyable. If you have enough time, you can check in early in the afternoon and then follow the coastal road to Qinyu Road. Walking in the same direction, you will pass by Yan'er Mountain, Badaguan, Zhanqiao, and bathing beaches. You can also take photos at the comic street, Daxue Road, and Xiaoyu Mountain where internet celebrities check in. The executive lounge on the seventh floor of the hotel can be Seeing the panoramic view of the sea, the field of vision is wide and the mind can calm down (it is recommended to try it).

They are considerate and will personally take you to the hotel room to introduce the hotel facilities to you. The service of the hotel's Ginkgo Tree Restaurant is also very good. There is a dish that we told the waiter about. We were not used to it, so the waiter rushed over and asked if we could change it to another dish for free. We quickly said no, no, because it was our taste that we were not used to, not the food, but their attitude was very satisfactory, and they even turned down the bed at night. We were thoughtfully given sliced ‚Äã‚Äãoranges. Of course we were too full and didn‚Äôt eat them, but everything made us feel comfortable. Except for the older rooms and poorer views, other service details beat St. Regis. The experience was much better. St. Regis Even though the scenery is first-class, the service is not that great.

I was attracted by the pictures on the Internet, but I didn't expect to be very disappointed when I came here! From the moment I walked in to the lobby, I didn't feel much star service. The aromatherapy in the lobby was also very tacky and the smell was unpleasant. We arrived at 11:50 and were told that check-in would be in the afternoon and asked us to wait. We were notified that we could check in at two o'clock when we were outside. The waiter at the front desk did not introduce breakfast or hotel facilities at all. We called later I called to inquire. It can be said that the hotel did not provide any proactive care and service during the entire check-in process, which is really disappointing. There is a difference between the reserved room and the actual picture online. Overall, I feel that this hotel is not cost-effective. Although the decoration and design materials of the old five-star rooms are more high-quality, but to be honest, compared with the new five-star hotel of Haitian Hotel , at the same price, their hardware, services and location are much better. I would still strongly recommend the latter, which is more cost-effective. The environment of the breakfast restaurant does not have any sea view to speak of, and the food is very simple. The only thing I'm satisfied with is probably that the sea is right across the road, and it's also relatively close to Haizhilian Park. By the way, there is a 1937 Laojindao local restaurant on Shunde Road near the hotel. It is highly recommended! ! !

The child wanted to eat fried chicken steak for breakfast, and the staff immediately went to ask the kitchen if they could make it today, and told them that there were other chicken steaks to choose from. The staff at the swimming pool, Zhang Mengyuan, was even more enthusiastic to help take care of the children's safety and help them take a bath and dry their hair. The breakfast at Sea View Garden is very good. The beef stew and roasted pork knuckle are suitable for children and the elderly. The fruit quality is very high. The cantaloupe and dates are very sweet. It is much better than other hotels I changed to later. When I come to Qingdao in the future, I will choose Sea View Garden again, yyds!

The breakfast taste is quite satisfactory, and I didn't find anything particularly delicious, so I didn't eat the buffet at noon for fear of stepping into the trap.

In the early morning of the first day we moved in, my husband was watching the sea view on the balcony and looking at his car. Suddenly he said, someone is in my car! Ah, I was shocked. It was broad daylight. Nothing would happen in the hotel yard. What was going on? He took a closer look and saw that it was the waiter wiping our car. It was incredible! This kind of service surprised and touched us! After breakfast, I went downstairs to take a special look at the car. I drove ten hours to Qingdao last night and the car was very dirty. Today it is as clean as new! We are so happy! When we came out of the room, the room service staff, a woman in her forties, greeted us and asked if we wanted to change the sheets. My husband and I said it was no trouble and we would change them tomorrow. She said, no trouble, no trouble. When we came back in the evening, we found that the sheets and quilts had been replaced with new ones. We stayed for four days and the bedding was brand new every day. Let us who are tired have a comfortable and relaxing rest. The service staff and reception staff of the hotel are very warm and kind, making you feel at home!

msg:I took an elderly person with me on this trip and specially chose a two-bedroom suite with a sea view. It was said to have a side sea view, but in fact the view was very good and the sea view was great! I chose Seaview Garden Hotel because it is the hotel with the best service in Qingdao, and the stay experience is truly worthy of its reputation. The best is to be as friendly as family, and the best is to be meticulous and considerate.
Separated from the sea by a road, it is very convenient to go to Mai Island, Olympic Sailing, May Fourth Square and Yan'er Island.
A very perfect stay experience, highly recommended!

Service: It can be said to be Haidilao-style service. The lady who checked in was very nice and answered questions patiently. When entering the room, there will be staff to guide you and help you with your luggage. Everything you can think of and what you need can be given to you.

There are fruits and mineral water every day, and there are three kinds of drinks in the minibar, which are also free. The outdoor swimming pool looks pretty good, and the children are 150. Adults seem to be more than 200. Forgot the exact price. There are electronic game room, children's playground, small cinema, table tennis and billiards and other recreational facilities in the underground.

The breakfast variety is very rich, and the dessert bread is very good. It is suitable for family trips with children aged eight or nine and under. You can stay in the hotel without coming out, and walk along the seaside plank road when it is cooler at night. There is a beach across the road. It is more suitable to go in the morning. In the afternoon, the sea water recedes and the exposed sand is thicker, and the sand exposed in the morning is finer. In the morning, there was relatively little Enteromorpha (I checked and found out that the sea**** cultivation in the coastal areas of Jiangsu caused the outbreak of Enteromorpha, and it flowed to Qingdao, which is really depressing~

For dinner, there is a Shuangheyuan Dayao 3rd Road store and a Kaihaijiang West Road store nearby, both of which are about 10 yuan away by taxi. The hotel's own restaurant, Ginkgo Seafood, is also delicious.

This restaurant is famous for its good service, and it really has the style of Lu Lu: a sincere enthusiasm, for fear that the customers will not be satisfied, and what is not done is unexpected, so customers just ask, and they will find a way to meet it. We had already eaten a lot of fruit for breakfast, but we didn‚Äôt eat the fruit in the room. The waiter was worried that we didn‚Äôt know how to use a knife, so he specially peeled a plate of oranges and put them in the room (I‚Äôm a little embarrassed...thank you Yulian). In addition, I like to add a lot of milk to my coffee. It is very difficult to use a tall glass to receive the latte from the coffee machine. The next day, I found that the outlet of the coffee machine was silently raised... The local hotel is so careful, it is worth writing more.

In short, it is recommended to bring children. They have a rich breakfast, and Ten-year-old children make up the difference of 50, which is a good deal! There are seven or eight kinds of fruits for breakfast, and there are many other Chinese and Western styles. It is recommended to have breakfast at the hotel.

msg:The first choice for parent-child travel, first-class five-star service!
I have been booking hotels on Ctrip for more than ten years, and I basically consider star ratings and reviews. This time I came to Qingdao as well. After looking at all the high-star hotels, I went back and forth many times, and finally chose Seaview Garden. The overall feeling of 3 nights is that I chose the right one.
1. The service is super good. One guest area, small gifts in the room, snacks and other details are full. When we came, the room we booked hadn‚Äôt been tidied up yet. The very nice lady at the front desk (unfortunately I didn‚Äôt remember the name) decided to upgrade to Building 3 with a slightly better apar**ent. , He also said that if it is not full, the family room will be given, and I fully feel the coolness and a**osphere of Shandong. In addition, Master Lu at the pick-up station is very nice, reminding the big waves not to go into the sea; he also rubs his feet after walking too much, and the front desk provides free band-aids and so on.
2. Suitable for parents and children. It's not easy to travel with two babies. The hotel thoughtfully prepared children's toiletry bags and slippers, as well as plush toys and shells. The children liked it very much. The waiter, Sister Wu, warmly gave me an extra fruit plate, thank you very much! There are two free activity areas on the basement floor, as well as a game area (purchase game currency), suitable for children of different ages; the indoor swimming pool is 1.2 meters, and the outdoor is 0.6-1.2 meters. A swimming cap and goggles are required. The children swim very happily.
3. Beautiful environment. The hotel room is very clean, cleaned in a timely manner, and the accommodation is very quiet; the hotel yard is not too big, but it has its own lawn and a small beach where children dig sand; the location is superior, the sea and Internet celebrity cave are just across the road, and it is easy to walk Not far away are the Level Zero Scenic Spot, Wheat Island, etc. It is also very convenient to take a taxi to go to Ge‚Äôs scenic spots; the seaside plank road is very suitable for sports, and the scenery along the way is good.
4. Diverse food. The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory, with a rich variety, and the taste of beef noodles is okay; the buffet needs to be reserved in advance, and the foie gras is really good, more than 300 for adults, and more than 200 for children above 1.2 meters. There are many online reviews. In all fairness, this price is still very cost-effective! Guangdong Restaurant has better service and taste, while Baiguoshu is a local Qingdao dish with large servings, and the overall consumption of the two restaurants is about the same.
All in all, Seaview Garden Hotel deserves its five-star rating, and it is worth coming again!

The hotel's children's play area and swimming pool are enough for children to play for a day without getting tired, and the hotel's seafood is also amazing! Walk to the beach for 5 minutes across the road. You can catch the sea according to the tide table and there are not many people. Wheat Island on the left and Yaner Island Park on the right can be reached in a 10-minute walk. It is really beautiful to take pictures to see the sunrise and sunset!

Unlimited fruits and drinks in the room, very considerate.
Gifts and snacks are given to the children every day, and the children like it very much.
I really like the underground amu*****t facilities, big slides, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and movie rooms!
The sea is just outside the hotel, tents can be pitched on the lawn, and sand can be played on the beach not far away, which is very good. All the waiters are excellent. The waiter at the door will take the initiative to help you with your luggage.
Put on your swimsuit and go to the swimming pool. The waiter in the swimming pool will ask you to buy bath towels for you and send them back to the hotel for fear of freezing on the road. I used more than ten bath towels in two days...
The breakfast is very rich, with everything you can think of, and there is no limit.
The photos were all taken at the hotel.

From the moment I entered the hotel, I could feel that the receptionist at the door and the front desk staff were very enthusiastic, serious and responsible. The hotel rooms are very beautiful and clean, with warm and meticulous facilities. There are high-end TOTO automatic toilets, more than a dozen towels, complete bathing utensils, and a clothesline in particular. It reflects the hotel's people-oriented and wholehearted service to guests. Concept, room service personnel are on call when there is any problem, and solve the problems of guests in a timely manner, including drying racks on the balcony, seats for bathing, and delivering fruits and small gifts before going to bed every day. The hotel swimming pool is seawater, very clean, and the staff is very serious about safety inspections. The facilities in the gym are very complete, and the staff are very enthusiastic and serve with a smile. The breakfast is good, there are many samples, there are homemade health drinks, and the service staff in the restaurant have a good service attitude. Because I failed to check in in time, I received a subsidy when I checked out, and I received a follow-up call for advice. In short, we think that although the Garden Hotel is an old hotel, it can be said to be the ceiling of domestic hotels in terms of hotel management and personnel training. Our check-in experience is very good, and we give it a big üëçüèª praise.

There is a parking lot, both on the ground and underground (the ground of the underground parking lot is not very clean), suitable for self-driving. I personally think that when you come to Qingdao for vacation, you must stay at the Seaview Garden Hotel once.

The sea view room is booked, the service is okay, and it is not as exemplary as I heard. Compared with the parent-child hotels in Sanya, I feel that the service is still quite poor. The underground swimming pool is very hot and stuffy, and the outdoor swimming pool was not open when I went there. So after staying for two days, I went swimming once and didn't want to go again. Because I'm not used to Shandong cuisine, I didn't eat well in Qingdao these few days. The Cantonese restaurant in the hotel was not bad, and I settled my meals there. The service of the Cantonese restaurant is very warm and serious. A thumbs upüëçüèªThe children's paradise is still good, and there is also a small theater, which is very friendly to children. Next time I come to Qingdao, I will choose this place again.

It is located on the seaside of Qingdao, surrounded by a vast green area and beautiful gardens, giving a sense of tranquility and relaxation. At the same time, the architectural design of the hotel is also very attractive, and its unique appearance and exquisite decoration are impressive.

The furniture and equipment in the room are very modern, equipped with a large LCD TV, mini refrigerator, high-speed wireless network, etc. At the same time, the room also has a quiet office area, which is convenient for guests to handle some work affairs.

The hotel's dining options are rich and varied. The breakfast offers a rich buffet with various tastes, including Chinese and Western dishes. I especially like their seafood buffet, fresh seafood and exquisite cooking make my mouth full. In addition, the hotel also has a high-end Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant, which provide formal dinners and special dishes to meet the needs of different guests.

msg:The location of the hotel is near the seaside and not far from major scenic spots. You can go to Yan'er Island by taking the seaside plank road, but the subway is not very convenient and you have to walk 1.2 kilometers by bus. Tools and kegs are provided, very user-friendly. There are many stones on the beach. The internal environment of the hotel is high-end. The children‚Äôs amu*****t park on the first floor of the ba*****t has all the facilities. The children like the sauna very much. Everyone is greeted with a smile on Kaohsiung Road. Luggage is picked up at the station by Kaohsiung Road. When the door is opened, the manager will take us to the subway. We say no, we will go to eat first. Tim saw that the children liked it and sent a whole bag of shells, which are very beautiful and there are small dolls, but our children don‚Äôt like it. The room is not big but it‚Äôs very quiet. Everywhere is clean. The toiletries are Kappa white moss. I like the smell. I told my aunt about the body lotion. She directly took three small bottles and gave me a big bubble bath. The disposable plastic film was also provided. The accommodation is very considerate and the overall comfort is good. The reason is the chef. Every dish is generally full. The breakfast buffet is good. There are coffee, juice, Chinese and Western styles. It can be said to be very conscientious. There are some dissatisfaction. The north-facing room is relatively stuffy. The door is ringing, but there is no sound if you don‚Äôt open it. There‚Äôs a big pit outside the window. The municipal land doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. If you go out, you‚Äôre looking for a room with a sea view. Don‚Äôt choose this air conditioner. It may be a bit old. I couldn't find where to turn on the TV station because the children were clamoring to watch cartoons. I fiddled with it for an hour and then sent a projection device. I didn't use it to compare with the overall experience. When I called, I had nothing to say, and even said that I would send me a small gift. The sea view hotel is very heartwarming. I would recommend it to my colleagues and friends who want to go. The trip to Qingdao for three days and two nights is worth visiting, especially with children.

The hotel even upgraded the garden view room for free, and I can see the sea; the hotel facilities are complete and the details are well done; the hotel is underground The first floor is full of children's play area, children like it very much, and look forward to the small gifts from the hotel every day; the hotel is very close to the sea, you can dig sand to pick up shells in the morning; from the plank road opposite the hotel, you can go east to Wheat Island, go to May Fourth Square is also very convenient; every hotel staff is smiling and feels very kind.
In short, it is worth recommending!

Children like conch shells and toys, so I called the front desk and sent them to the room. I have come here a lot, no matter the environment or the service, it is really first-class, recommended, super recommended. I really regret that I checked out and went to St. Regis the next day.

msg:I chose this hotel at the beginning because it is close to the seaside, and there is also a children's playground indoors. It is very convenient to go to various attractions in the city. I didn't expect to be amazed by their high-quality and considerate service after I moved in. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and this hotel is definitely the first in terms of serviceüëç. Although it is not a newly built hotel, the facilities are very good in all aspects, and politeness can be seen everywhere Greetings and smiling faces make people feel like a spring breeze. I especially thank Liu Caigui, an employee of the guest room depar**ent, for his meticulous and thoughtful care and service from check in to check out. Before leaving, he even prepared apples and mineral water thoughtfully. I am really touched I would also like to thank Master Lu from the Vehicle Depar**ent for picking up and dropping off the airport in a timely manner, and for giving us pertinent advice during the process of clearing the way for us, so that we can travel smoothly and relatively easily during the May 1st crowded traffic jam. After completing our check-in plan, the experience is good. During this trip, the kids had a lot of fun at the hotel‚Äôs playground. When we went out and crossed the road, our older friends could also go to the beach opposite the hotel to enjoy the sea breeze. It was comfortable and leisurely, and it was very convenient not to go to the crowded seaside attractions. , I am very satisfied with the whole process. Next time I come to Qingdao, I want to stay at your home.

This is something that I don‚Äôt have in so many five-star hotels. The curtain in the bathroom can be opened and closed with one button, which is very convenient and privacy is very goodüëå
Hygiene: It is clean and hygienic, and I was worried about the bad hygiene. I made enough preparations, and I bought a lot of disposable things for staying and resting, but I didn't expect it to be almost useless;
Environment: The front desk of the hotel is very gray and powerful. It is directly upgraded to the sea view room facing the sea and the spring flowers blooming. The super sea view room has complete supporting facilities and it is very convenient to go out.
Service: Be sure to say: Mom thinks the door is very powerful. The handsome little brother in a hat is responsible for opening the door and escorting you in. I am very surprised that I am worried about you knocking on your head and helping you protect your head. It's a pity that staying for one night didn't affect the excellent quality and super service attitude in the slightest. I saw that I took the initiative to help you carry your luggage and load the car. There is no problem with the attitude and service because you left. This point is greatly appreciated by the little brother wearing a hatüëç.
Finally, I concluded that it was very late to fly to Qingdao after get off work, and the family was already very tired after a long journey. The front desk was very thoughtful and prepared a bucket for feet, thinking of the guests, it was really good to relieve fatigue. Going out to eat breakfast is clean and hygienic. Chinese and Western food is complete, the taste is good, and the service attitude is good. It is very comfortable for mothers to experience. Selected
This one is very good üëç.
I will come here often in the future, and I feel great. Thank you for the hotel's service and first-class standards that make me very happy.

The hotel not only has a good view, but is very close to the sea, and the service is even more considerate. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a sea view room for free, and there was also a caring housekeeper, Zhang Mengli. Thanks to her for asking about her health every day, bringing fresh fruit and purified water, and sending a bucket of soaking feet when she returned to the hotel at night, she is so considerate!

msg:1. I think the best location of the hotel is the location of the hotel. It is the seaside plank road when we go out. It gave us a great surprise when we first arrived in Qingdao, and it also brought us great convenience in our later travels. I think everyone comes to Qingdao to see the sea. Yes, then you can take a walk on the beach to watch the sunset as soon as you go out, and there are few people. What a unique condition.
2. The breakfast is very delicious, with rich variety and delicious taste. My family and I spend two hours eating breakfast at the hotel every day~
3. The bed is very comfortable, you can fall asleep as soon as you touch the pillow!
4. The service of the hotel is very good. Someone delivered to the room and introduced the room. The drinks in the refrigerator are free to refill, which is very delicious. Every day, there are people giving fresh fruits, and the apples are extremely sweet. What impressed me the most was that when I returned to the hotel late one night, I saw the words on the table, "Knowing that you are tired from walking all day, I specially brought you a bucket of soaking feet and a plate of sliced oranges. I wish you a pleasant journey!" , The oranges are really sweet, the foot bath bucket is also very comfortable, and we even gave us foot bath balls.
5. The facilities are very complete, there are sauna swimming pool and gym, children's play facilities.
Thank you for the meticulous care and excellent service of the hotel. I like this hotel.

Welcome fruits and gifts were delivered to the room immediately after we checked in. There is a standard turndown service, and the incubator is thoughtfully used for takeaway (It is recommended to separate hot and cold ones in hot weather) In addition to rich breakfast, there are many local specialties to choose from. In addition, there is a children's playground for children to discharge. Overall, business travelers with sea views and vacationers can basically find their place in the hotel

Opposite the hotel is the sea, you can watch the stars at night
Finally, the buffet is delicious. If you like seafood, you can have a drink.

Facilities: Scissors, nail clippers, glasses cloth, pencils, rulers, erasers, glue in the desk drawer...everything is available. In the mini bar, there are four types of beverages and several kinds of fruits updated every day, and the mineral water is unlimited and can be replenished at any time. The hotel provides free saunas, sweat steaming and wet steaming. Currently, there is an indoor seawater swimming pool with a water depth of 1.2 meters and a water temperature of about 30¬∞C. Swimming rings are provided. There is a children's playground and a small theater, which shows cartoons during the day and is suitable for all ages at night.
Service: It is indeed worthy of the title of Haidilao in the hotel industry. When I came back from the outside on the first night, there were snacks, cut fruits and small dolls on the table. The waiter also left a small note, and the reminder card on the bed marked it Tomorrow's weather and what to wear. When I went out the next day, I asked the service desk about the order of the tour, and the waiter quickly found a mini version of the map. When swimming, the waiter will put mineral water and lemonade on a small table and bring it to you.
The meal in the Ginkgo Tree restaurant in the set meal is very large, and 3 people can't finish it. The homemade yogurt is delicious. Before leaving, the waiter even packed a longan for the child.
Before leaving, due to a small problem during check-out, the lobby manager apologized in time and gave the children conch and delicious food. Every time I go out to take a taxi, the waiter is very enthusiastic and helps to see if the car has arrived. In short, I am very satisfied with the stay.

msg:The penultimate stop of my trip around China during the pandemic, Qingdao, chose to stay at the Seaview Garden Hotel, which has received explosive online praise. It really lives up to its reputation. The experience on the last day was infinitely close to the perfect hotel in my mind. Under the service of Manager Liu Caigui, I felt the ceiling of Chinese hotel services, which is better than a number of international luxury brands (but I mostly stay in luxury brands in Shanghai, and Shanghai hotels themselves are quite arrogant), and Xiamen Airlines Jinyan has its own strengths.
Facilities: Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are well maintained, and the toilet is also a full version of the smart toilet; the TV can be projected, the screen is not very large but it is enough; the supplies are crabtree; there is a capsule coffee machine in the deluxe sea view room, and the minibar and fruit are free and renewable for all room types.
Service: Overall, it is indeed the ceiling. The disadvantage is that due to the epidemic, the details of some waiters may not be very in place, but after communicating with Manager Liu Caigui, it was resolved, and I was readily upgraded to the executive sea view super deluxe king-size bed room. This service attitude is even more valuable at a time when international big brands are a bit rotten. It is worth mentioning that the night bed service here is unique. I suggest Shanghai Ritz and Waldorf Astoria Tianjin St. Regis to learn what night bed service is.
Location: It is only one street away from the seaside and a 15-minute walk from the subway station. Fortunately, there is a free subway station. It costs about 10 yuan to take a taxi to the mainstream scenic spots and shopping malls using Gaode.
Scenery: There is no scenery in the north-facing room. The scenery of the sea view room that was upgraded to me later is invincible. It seems to be the only sea view with a balcony in Qingdao City. It has its own merits with St. Regis. However, high-rise hotels are now the mainstream, so St. Regis often has it. But the balcony with sea breeze may only be here and Sanya. In the morning, have a cup of coffee and watch the sun rise from the sea. Maybe this is the meaning of travel!
Dining: I had breakfast and buffet dinner. If you like seafood for dinner, you can rush without thinking. The breakfast noodle stall tastes good. Both are large and comprehensive. Unfortunately, because there are too many types and the temperature is low, the production and temperature of self-service food cannot be guaranteed. However, all-you-can-eat seafood is enough for the ticket price.
Price: December is the off-season, and the basic room price is about 500, which is basically the same as Westin Shangri-La and more than half cheaper than St. Regis.
Generally speaking, unless you really want to experience high-rise sea views and international luxury brands or are extremely concerned about the location of the hotel, coming to Seaview Garden will give you a very comfortable experience.

msg:I have been eating buffet in the sea before, never lived. This time I couldn't go anywhere because of the epidemic, so I decided to go to the hotel for seven days. The first hotel chose the sea view, because the opposite is the beach, children can dig sand, and there is a children's playground inside the hotel.
Facilities: Old-fashioned hotel style, the room decoration is very old. Because it is close to the sea, it is a little humid. The room was very considerate and provided a bath bag and bath salts. Those who like to take a bath can use it with confidence.
Hygiene: The cleaning is very clean. There is a button to quickly clean the call. When you go out, choose to clean. When you come back, the room has a new look.
Environment: The overall environment is very good, and there is a children's amu*****t park, but it is more suitable for little babies of 3-6. There is a recreation center where you can swim, but the child said that the water has a particularly salty smell, and I don't know why. It is worth mentioning that there is a small movie theater that can seat about 30 people and plays movies every two hours, which children especially like. The breakfast variety is very rich.
Baiguoshu Double Set (A/B Set): Originally, I didn't have much hope for the gift set, but to my surprise, the dishes are very fresh and delicious, and the weight is full.
Service: There is really nothing to say about the service. The old five-star hotel had a little problem with check-in, and the hotel changed the room. The housekeeper accompanied the whole process to visit the room and change the room. Because my luggage was messy, the concierge helped me with my luggage throughout.
All-you-can-drink in the mini bar, and in-room ordering service.
Children's slippers and toiletry bag are presented, which is very considerate.
Complimentary mask care package.
Girls' makeup and cotton pads are also available, which is too thoughtful.
You can park your car for free.
Two suggestions: 1. You can call on everyone to wear masks when picking up meals. During the epidemic, although waiters may increase their workload, it is still necessary to remind everyone to protect everyone's health.
2. It happened to be the wedding banquet on the 3rd, but I couldn't find a parking space. This is too exaggerated. I hope to reserve at least some parking spaces for hotel guests in the future.
The overall feeling is very good, it is worth recommending.

msg:1. The service is ok. Although there is a butler service, the butler did not take the initiative to inform the hotel of the facilities and service hours (including where the breakfast is and what time it is), and the basic service is not well trained. But if you encounter problems, you can help them in time.
2. The room type reservation is exquisite, and the overall cost performance is not high. The basic deluxe sea view room facilities are still relatively old, and the executive and business room types in Building 3 have been refurbished, so they will be much better. However, the business sea view room is on the lower floor, and the view of the sea is not good. If you are obsessed with sea view (like me), you need to book the executive deluxe sea view room (later paid for the upgrade), Value for money is up to you.
3. The middle upgrade helped us to arrange the room on the 4th floor at the beginning. Later, the room on the 4th floor was renovated, and the decoration of the whole floor was very tasteful. After feedback, we upgraded to the room on the 8th floor. But in fact, if there is a decoration plan early in the morning, we should not be arranged to the 4th floor in the middle. 3 nights basically changed a room every night.
4. The overall score is 5 stars, but there is still a gap between the picture and the actual situation, and the service also has a gap with expectations (maybe because the local friends told me that the service of this hotel was famous in the country at the beginning, my expectations were relatively high).

There are additional toys and treats for the little ones every night. This time, I had prepared the room in advance and upgraded it to an executive sea view room. The children's supplies and fruits in the room had already been prepared. Although the facilities in the room are a bit outdated, the bathroom is very new, and the toilet is also a smart toilet. The room type booked has a balcony, which is very suitable for blowing the sea breeze and drying clothes. Every staff member is very enthusiastic and the service is very flexible, especially the housekeeper Lu Ping, who took the initiative to contact and add WeChat before checking in, and the service is very considerate and professional.

As a local old-fashioned hotel in Qingdao, the location is very good. The surrounding residential area will not be too noisy. The seaside is just across the street. It is very convenient to go out for a walk in the morning or after dinner. Then there is Wheat Island not far to the north, and Yan'er Island and the Olympic Sailing Center are very close to the south.

There are welcome fruits when you check in. The drinks and mineral water in the refrigerator are not only free, but you can even ask the hotel for it after drinking. Stayed for two nights and gave 7 small toys, unfortunately there are no children üòÇ)

In addition, the hotel also has one-to-one butler service! Our housekeeper, Miss Lu Ping, is super nice. In addition to hotel services, she can answer any questions about the location of nucleic acid testing points, specialty supermarkets, and travel suggestions. Knowing that there are elderly people staying, she will be reminded to use buckwheat pillows, and even make arrangements at night. The foot bath is really more thoughtful than I thought, thank you very muchüôè

msg:An extremely excellent accommodation experience, a hotel that has hosted the 2008 Olympic Games, so it continues the superiority of the service! At first I thought it was a state-owned enterprise that would not have much expectations for the service, but after check-in, free breakfast was provided, and a special person brought the room and introduced the entire hotel facilities at the same time. During the busy hours of breakfast, there is also a special person to take a seat. It can be said that many 5-star hotels at home and abroad have not had such good service this summer. Although the hotel facilities are American old-fashioned, I personally still pursue service more than hardware. There are indoor and outdoor pools, and the outdoor pool is a saltwater pool. There is also a children's playground. I will come here next time with my family.

All the staff are enthusiastic and will help in time. The room is prepared in advance with children's bathrobes, toiletries and small dolls ~ unlimited fruit drinks ~ children's park cinema on the first floor and other amu*****t facilities are readily available, liberating parents ~ the water quality of the outdoor swimming pool is clear ~ there are corresponding service personnel to provide services ~ at that time Booked for one night, the children didn't have enough fun, so they stayed for another night. All aspects of the experience have made you feel at home! Finally, I said that the breakfast dishes are rich in variety and choices, and they have prepared children's sterilized tableware very intimately. The best choice for family travel in Qingdao.

I checked in at Mai Island or Yan'er Island opposite the hotel. The hotel also provided a small bucket and a small shovel. The service attitude of the hall manager was very good. Got our courtesy gift, the kids like it very much. The hotel's facilities are also very good. Our trip this time is a star hotel + homestay, and this style is also essential.

I read other comments that this is a parent-child ceiling in Qingdao, which can be played by all ages. The playability is very high, and it is not a problem to discharge for 1 hour. There are also electric fishing ponds, magnetic construction, painting and handicraft rooms, and sand dredging ponds that do not need to go to the beach. Although they are a bit small, they are enough to play. Discovery Fort, climbing wall, all-day cinema, game hall, and a mini toilet for children. I never thought that there is such a hotel in the city that is suitable for children before the age of 3. The hotel sofa can also be combined with a small bed instead of a crib , the only thing is that there is no children's high stool in the room, it is inconvenient to wash hands. The breakfast is also very rich, the quality is good, the children like it very much! The days when you can't leave the blue are worth taking a vacation in the city often~

Those old hotels near the sea used to be withered, and they were crowded in my impression more than ten years ago. There is no more vivid fireworks like coffee and drinking üòî. I used to study in Qingdao, and I saw that many seaside hotels were full of people, brightly lit every night, and many foreigners and tourists. I didn‚Äôt expect that a city would drive backwards. Now those bustling hotels are all withered, and there is no such a**osphere anymore. . Therefore, this hotel is the most prosperous hotel I stay in, and it is very suitable for taking many children. The service can be said to be cautious and hospitable, because everyone likes to read comments on online platforms. There was a little episode in the check-in, because my cultivation still needs to be improved. After waiting for a long time for the check-in and I didn't eat lunch, I was a little hungry. The hotel quickly arranged a check-in for me and gave me a small red envelope. I think in retrospect, I was not patient enough and my self-cultivation needs to be improved. Next time I will not lose my temper.

Although the first one was an old house, it was too old. The second one was Qinyu Sea on Qinyu Road. It was fine too, but the noise of talking and motorbikes all night was annoying. Occasionally saw that the Garden Seaview Hotel had a room and booked it for one night. The result was unexpectedly satisfying. First of all, the room was large, and secondly, the doors were used better, because we didn't even hear the sound of children running in the corridor. It's so rare. Finally, there are details. There are welcome fruits and gifts for the children. There are even 6 bottles of water. There are water and cups on the bedside. The children's area on the first floor is not too fun. Although we only stayed for one day and enjoyed nothing else, I still think I will choose this hotel again next time I come.

Impressive incident: I saw a wound in the trash can when I was doing hygiene. Stickers, we prepared band-aids for us, really careful
üåü This time I came here as well as I did in the past. It is really amazing to be able to persist like this. The housekeeper Rita is super caring and has a strong ability to act, and the information will be returned in seconds~~
¬∑The contact information was added before check-in, because we will check in early and prepare the room early. I initially booked a north-facing queen room. When I entered the room, I complained about the scenery outside the window. Rita immediately arranged for us to upgrade the south-facing room typeüëçüèª
¬∑ The new room is not stingy, the view and area are much better
¬∑Remarked that for those who came for a birthday, the bed layout is very cartoon, after all, a parent-child hotel hahahaha
¬∑It's the cherry seasonüçí, and a big box of cherries was sent, delicious
¬∑On the eve of check-out, we also gave us a big bag of shell conch üêö! Great!
¬∑ Beach slippers hotel can also provide ü©¥
¬∑ Order takeaway butler will also help to bring it to the door of the house
¬∑ One afternoon, I was tired and hungry and had no energy to wait for the buffet in the evening. When I came back to the room, I found biscuits, üëçüèª admiration
¬∑ Asked for a bag of ice cubes, just said a little more. A whole big plastic bag... almost can't lift it, really generous hahahaha
¬∑I gave a birthday cake on the day of check-in, and I also gave one when I ate the buffet the next day. It was very considerate, but the only drawback is that the cake cream & chocolate are not very good.
¬∑ The fruit delivered is delicious, hahahaha
¬∑ Rita also brought water and apples in the car to catch the plane, which is so sweet
üöó Transportation: DiDi drivers are recognized as a good hotel, and the word of mouth is as always. High-rise landscape hotels in CBD cannot replace intimate butler service. It's quite convenient to get to the attractions in the city, within 30 minutes of a taxi, and it's a bit far to take the subway~
üçöAfter a search of buffets, the best in Qingdao is actually here. The dishes are really complete, you can eat them in two meals... The supply is fast and the quality is really goodüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª No matter which country or region the dishes are delicious! ! !

msg:Before booking, I heard that Sea View Garden is the Haidilao of Qingdao's hotel industry, so I will experience it this time.
After getting off the car, the porter took the initiative to take the box. Warm reception at the front desk. The lady who led me into the room introduced me carefully and thoughtfully. The room attendant delivered things quickly and even more fruit. Indeed the service is more than you want.
The hotel breakfast is very rich, but there are many people dining.
The business of the hotel is very good, and there are frequent traffic jams at the door.
The hotel software is really great, but the hardware is really a bit old. The bathroom door was peeled, and it stayed for two days without cleaning it.
Despite the flaws, Qingdao Seaview Garden Hotel is still the five-star hotel with the best service I have ever stayed in.

The breakfast ended at 10 o'clock, and after 10 o'clock, although there were still many guests still having breakfast, the waiters came out with their carts and began to collect the plates, take meals, and set up lunch.

But since the reservation was made, I was very pleasantly surprised to feel the level of sea view service, which is really beyond five-star. The room reservation depar**ent provides full service like a housekeeper Liu, confirming the room and upgrading it, coordinating the driver of the team to pick up people at the subway entrance (the concierge team calls and informs who the pick-up driver is, and the driver then contacts the boarding location again to pick up the person. We sent hot towels and warmly introduced the surrounding environment attractions, etc.), the front desk was quick to check in, and the service staff brought hot tea and snacks. After moving in, we can meet various needs, because there are many things to do with children and the elderly, such as children's supplies, bed-screw, bed baffles, etc. Xiao Liu has arranged them, it is really comprehensive! There is no need to worry about the room facilities, it is warm and comfortable! Our floor service sister Wang is also very good, and she also gives gifts to children with food and drinks. The old man kept complimenting, and the children also had a great time. The whole negative floor was a children's entertainment area. Not to mention in terms of catering, the sea view buffet itself is ceiling-level, and the breakfast buffet is impeccable and rich in variety. During the epidemic, the hotel's epidemic prevention measures are also very strict. Must go again sometime!

After moving in, I was not disappointed. The facilities are old but not old
But the hygiene is super good ~~ and the service is really good! !
Not as good as various reviews say, but good and just right, very comfortable feeling
The playground on the first floor is super good, 3 playgrounds cater for different age groups
There is also a drawing room and a building block room for fishing~~
The epidemic can't go far, the best place to take the two children is the hotel! ! Anyway, this is the most cost-effective I have lived in.
Although the buffet is expensive, it is really refreshing. I like red wine and foie gras very much.
Grilled durian, hairy crabs are generally only male, I don't like to eat sashimi, my baby has eaten a lot, and Haagen-Dazs is refreshing. I am satisfied! ! !

Because my wife likes its buffet, I chose it as the first stop in Qingdao this time. Although the facilities have aged a lot, the first-class service and the first-line sea view are still great. What's even more rare is that until I left Qingdao yesterday, I found that a piece of clothes was left behind, but I don't know which hotel it left in. The hotel called me yesterday afternoon and sent the clothes to me. Very good service experience! When staying in a hotel, it is not just about the hardware and the sea view, but also the service! It is more than a hundred times better than the experience of the Bliss Soup Spring in Jimo.

msg:On the first day of 2022, I experienced the so-called hotel ceiling, which was very bad.
1. I have used Ctrip for more than ten years and thought I would choose a hotel: look at ratings, look at room types, look at reviews, and look at bad reviews. But it is still very regrettable that the navy in the praise has brought the rhythm. Choose this hotel.
2. Hardware: Almost 0 points, very poor. The decoration of the whole hotel is old and the sanitation is worrying. Obvious stains on the bottom of the bathtub (rust?), wallpaper falling on the corners, jammed doors and windows, hot and cold water, exposed switches in the elevator car (don‚Äôt worry about children sticking their fingers in?), every detail is there Remind the hotel that it is time to re-maintain and renovate. The biggest pain point, and the biggest selling point of the hotel, is the children's playground on the first floor. It was very big the moment I entered, and I didn‚Äôt stay long. I found a problem, didn‚Äôt ventilate, and held my breath. No Gaoxing parent-child hotel will put such an important children's playground in the ba*****t.
3. Software: No feeling, no evaluation. To be honest, I was attracted by the hotel services in the evaluation. The review repeated how good the hotel service is, and how good Zhao Hui‚Äôs service is (the waiter‚Äôs name is repeated, like every Ctrip guest is very lucky to be received by her, so hard) When we checked in, it was more than 3 pm, we ordered 2 Only 1 room can be accommodated. The service is normal. Give the room card and bring the room. I don't feel any special service at other times. In the evening, I gave a big apple and cheap candy corn in the Ctrip welcome package. It was embarrassing. I don‚Äôt know what kind of paint is written on the big apple. Are you sure the guests dare to eat it? I didn‚Äôt see the yogurt written in the package. In each location of the hotel, there are writings to emphasize family service. It is recommended not to exaggerate, as the expectations for guests are too high, and the name does not match the truth.
4. Meals. Can't evaluate. Similarly, the dinner buffet of this hotel is also recommended online. I booked the position one day in advance, and I checked it online. There was more than one person in 300. I was full of expectations. I asked about the hotel again on January 1. The price increased on New Year's Day. There were 458 people and I couldn't afford it, so I immediately refunded the reservation. The daily buffet in Shanghai is 300 per capita, and the so-called Ceiling Hidden Buffet and Guanglin Yadian near the house are also 400. I have little knowledge and it is the first time I have encountered self-help with such a high price increase during the festival.
5. Location. The location is close to the sea, across the road, and to be honest, it is very convenient to see the sea.

I booked for 2 nights. If it's not for the child to fall asleep at the hotel, I should unsubscribe directly to St. Regis or Haitian. Later, I only stayed for 1 night and moved out quickly.

I first saw this hotel recommendation in the official account of a travel blogger, and it also said that the service is very good. Now I suggest that you post recommendations from the media, and you can live there in person, don‚Äôt be ignorant of your conscience to make money.

Although the room has a sloping ceiling, it is large in size and has a good view and can see the sea. Breakfast and dinner are absolutely rich, but the stomach is too small, so many delicacies can't be eaten. The seafood for dinner is very fresh, and the dishes are fast. The crabs are not very big but they are very fresh and fat. Desserts are better if they are richer. On the first floor, there is a playground for children to play, and the dolls are full of fun, and even the toilets are very intimate with children‚Äôs special sinks and small stools. The services are top-notch. Special thanks to Bingbing butler, who is kind and caring, five-star praise. I hope that the hotel will launch more group buying activities, so that the whole family will have the opportunity to play again in the future.

Miss sister carefully selected socks for us and sent them to our room. I am very grateful to Miss Sister. It feels great to be taken care of by others. Miss Sister left the shop the next day and sent them to us. We, we are already good friends. We will definitely come to Seaview Garden once, and hope that next time we come, we can see Miss Li Bingbing again! Treating us like family members, it feels good to be cared for and warm!

She also prepared baby cots for us in advance. The pick-up staff went directly to the exit of the airport to meet them, saving us the trouble of finding a parking lot. After arriving at the hotel, I booked a sea-view big bed room. Butler Li Yanwen helped me to apply for an upgrade to the sea-view suite. The room is large and there are two bathrooms with separate dry and wet rooms. It was a pleasant surprise. Butler Zhao Hui is also very enthusiastic.
Later, when we went to the beach, the child caught a bit of cold. Several staff members gave us medicine and rubbing alcohol for a few days. It was so heart-warming. I really came to the Seaview Hotel and felt full of feelings of being at home. great.
Thank you to the whole team, from pick-up, check-in arrangements, drop-off, the hotel environment is very goodüëç. Will come again.

The children‚Äôs playground on the ba*****t level is super big. A good place for parents and children.

        Before you come, look at the pictures and book a room, hoping to have a panoramic view of the beautiful sea in the room with a balcony. There was no balcony when I checked in and the view was not good enough. I just expressed a slight dissatisfaction. The handsome guy who provided us with butler service immediately went to the reception desk to coordinate the room change, and finally upgraded to the executive deluxe ocean view room for free, which satisfied our wish.
        In addition, the hotel service is very good, and the doorman politely comes to pick up the suitcase and deliver it to the room when I get off the bus. There is ample supply of snacks, fruits and beverages every day when the room is opened. The breakfast is rich in Western and Chinese style, and the yogurt made by the hotel is delicious. Sauna and swimming are free.
         The dishes in Baiguoshu Xiaoting are delicious.
         The location of the hotel is very good, and it is also very pleasant to walk on the boardwalk in front of the hotel!
        Oh, the name of the handsome guy who provides us with 5-star service is Ding Chao.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel environment is very good, with a garden, the room can see the sea view, but because the room is relatively short on the third floor, only a little can be seen.
The room equipment is old, especially the hair dryer. After changing a few sockets, the wind is too small. It takes a long time to blow the hair before it dries. I hope the hotel will update the hair dryer.
üîîService: Very good. I was promoted to a business ocean view room. I waited for a few hours for check-in and refunded a part of the money when I checked out. This was very unexpected. Looking at other comments, there is a housekeeper. I was not assigned a housekeeper this time. There may be many people on the National Day. The waiter smiled and would greet us.

To be honest, in terms of geographical location, Seaview Garden is by no means dominant. Now there is St. Regis, which is known for its characteristics. Service is probably the most important competitive core in the future. However, when the service consciousness has become increasingly competitive today, how can we always be able to To be No. 1 in the service industry is indeed no small challenge. In the tweet of Hip Tour, the clothes put in the room were all washed after returning, so it was sealed as Qingdao hotel yyds. According to the actual measurement, the room type of more than two thousand one nights did not enjoy this service. I am afraid it is also because of the person. Different service. Next time I will choose the new hotel St. Regis to try, so be it.

There are many activities for children to play. Indoor projects can make up for the vacancy when encountering heavy rain. Anxious at the hotel. The service is meticulous and responsive, and children have everything they need. Everyone has said the benefits, add a few points:
1. The hair dryer is Dyson's, 2990 hair dryer, only used in Yate.
2. Executive lounge dinner is not used, buffet dinner can offset 150 yuan per person. The locals in Qingdao are also very keen on this self-service. They booked one day in advance, and they lined up to table 117, so everyone makes an appoin**ent as soon as possible.
3. Thank you for the upgrade. The first sentence at the front desk is "Is the administrative package done well?" I thought the room was upgraded by one level, but I never expected it to rise to the top with huge price disparity.
4. The small desk is fully furnished, and the child likes it very much, so he can't help but draw and write when he is in the room.
5. Audi A6L pick-up station and drop-off station, the master walks along the coastline specially, so that we can see different scenery and explain to us different famous scenic spots.
6. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools, to satisfy children's desire to swim in the water.
7. There are other people's evaluations.

In the end, I chose this local brand, which is known as the service-oriented local brand. Qingdao celebrates his girlfriend's birthday, it is still very important to communicate effectively and in a timely manner. Facts have proved that this hotel is indeed worthy of the praise on the Internet!

Thank you for the room housekeeper #ËµµÊÖß of the hotel in advance. I started calling from the morning of the check-in day because I noted the birthday in advance and also helped our room make a simple birthday decoration. I ordered a cake for my girlfriend. I thought I would be in the room as soon as I walked in. I asked the trustee Zhao Hui to receive it for me and put it in the room in advance. The service is responsive, and we have been caring about our journey along the way. This feeling is really good!

I usually write hotel reviews, and if they are intact, I will give some suggestions that I feel are inadequate, but I personally do not feel any obvious shortcomings in this hotel. Excellent service and standard five-star facilities are nothing to choose from. I have to say something, that the security at the door was a bit dull. I drove back to the hotel on Saturday night. Maybe there were more people coming for dinner on the weekend. The security didn‚Äôt guide the parking. A random stop was blocked at the door and it was blocked for 10 minutes. The security guard stood there and watched, and finally the manager from the Ginkgo Tree Restaurant came out to guide the vehicle to clear the way.

In addition to the hotel‚Äôs supporting Hawaiian barbecue buffet, although they claim to be open until 12 o‚Äôclock in the evening, they are not recommended to go after 8 o‚Äôclock, not recommended, not recommended! ! Not recommended on weekends! Not recommended! Not recommended! ! To be honest, this barbecue is a bit stretched, really, you are such an excellent hotel...... This is really. .

As for breakfast, it‚Äôs quite satisfactory. It‚Äôs a medium-to-higher level, but it doesn‚Äôt reach the level of ‚Äúplenty‚Äù in other reviews, but it‚Äôs pretty good.

In short, it is a hotel worth staying in. I think next time I come to Qingdao, this hotel will be the first choice. Thank you again for your dedicated service, thank you!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, the service is the best in the five-star, and the best stay experience in China. Our plane arrived just after one o'clock. After the last customer chose to go to the hotel by himself, Huo Hengbin, a friend in the concierge depar**ent, flexibly decided to wait for us at the airport for 40-50 minutes with the driver and provided us with great help. Because we have a lot of luggage, it is not very convenient to take a drip. During the stay, the young man took a day off and was worried that we would be too tired to go out at night, so he provided us with a lot of help.
During the stay, Miss Liu Caigui, the lobby manager, quickly helped us solve many problems several times. The front desk service was also very patient. The driver and cleaning aunt were also very kind to us.
The buffet in the hotel is very good and rich. Foreign friends and children like the wine service and will stay again next time.

msg:The hotel is quite good~ Take two babies to play, the babies are very happy. The hotel is very caring, and left gifts and notes for the baby in the hotel, which are handwritten. Open the balcony door and you can see the sea. The Hawaiian self-service downstairs is okay. In-house guests are cheaper than Meituan. The breakfast is also good, I feel better than Wanda Vista. I feel that they have indicators for assessing the service, and the service is to the extreme, and they must be satisfied within 5 minutes of making a call. Even the express delivery was delivered to the house. After I left, I called and asked if I had reached my destination safely. Screen windows and doors were installed in the middle. The guest was coordinating with an elderly grandma, who felt that the hotel was very milky and thoughtful and hired older staff. All in all it is a good experience.

The outdoor swimming pool happened to be a typhoon that day. It was raining and I couldn‚Äôt play. The breakfast variety of the hotel was very good There are many, good tastes, great location, very close to the beach, if you don‚Äôt want to go out if you‚Äôre tired, the hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a buffet restaurant. We ate a buffet on the first day, and it‚Äôs not expensive. There are seafood and barbecue. Yes, the most important thing is that the service of this hotel is really attentive. I received a phone call from the hotel as soon as I arrived home and asked if it was safe to arrive. I also asked about my stay in the past two days. This is the first time I received such a call. Moved, thanks to Chu Peng‚Äôs enthusiastic service, just for this call, I will choose Seaview Garden Hotel next time I come to Qingdao, not to mention this hotel is really good and worth recommending

The children's tourist place is powerful, and the indoor is not affected by the weather. The outdoor swimming pool has two deep pools, so babies can play with confidence, and the swimming laps are free to use. There is a small artificial beach by the pool, free sand dredging tools, sunshades and electric fans. Drinking water can be accessed from many places, snacks and small gifts are given to the room every day, and the bath towels are particularly soft. The breakfast is rich and tastes good. The only disadvantage is that the bath water temperature is not stable, it will be cold for a while and hot for a while, and it needs to be adjusted constantly.

                       The hotel is really good, the service is first-rate;
                       Seafood is delicious, it is recommended to eat in the city;
                       Qingdao people are sincere and enthusiastic!
 Let‚Äôs talk about the weather first. The main theme is rain, rain and rain. During the four-day and three-night trip to Qingdao, the real playable time is only two full days. Fortunately, it is basically rain showers and stops, but the short-term is still very big. We rushed to the two and a half days without rain during this period, and played the Olympic Sailing Center, Trestle, Underwater World, Laoshan Qingshan Fishing Village; Olympic Sailing Center, Underwater World is really worth a visit, especially if traveling with children; Trestle , Qingshan Fishing Village basically continues the usual characteristics of Qingdao: red tiles and green trees, blue sea and blue sky, I feel that if the weather is clearer, the viewing experience is better! Let‚Äôs talk about hotels. I have to say that the credibility of online reviews is still very high. The Qingdao Seaview Garden Hotel, which scored as high as 4.9 in Ctrip‚Äôs reviews, is very good in terms of hardware and software, and the location is absolutely nothing In other words, in order to live in a better room, although we waited a little time when we checked in, it was definitely worth it. The room was spacious and bright, with well-equipped facilities, the bathroom was a full smart toilet, the fruit and drinks in the room were all free, and it was updated daily and soundproofed. Not bad, not noisy at all, service is on call! Next time I come to Qingdao, I will definitely choose this hotel again!

msg:Qingdao Seaview Garden Hotel. It has high reviews online. I was not disappointed after I came. The concierge service was very good from the moment I got off the car. Helped to open the car door. Take the luggage. There is hot üçµ in the lobby. There is mineral water at hand basically everywhere. The check-in front desk was busy. A separate channel was opened. A business card was given when checking in. It said that you can call him at any time if you need anything, including outside the hotel. Fruits were also delivered when you checked in. Snacks were prepared after dinner and returned to the room. Mineral water was placed on the two bedside tables.

üç¥ At noon, I had dinner in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. Although I didn't order a lot. But the service was still very good. Cold dishes and yogurt were prepared while waiting for the dishes.

Dinner hotel buffet. Hotel guests have discounts. The reviews are quite high. The price and variety are not as good as expected. The breakfast the next day was also in this restaurant. Breakfast is 100üí∞ per person. But I think that whether it is breakfast or dinner, the children feel that they eat a little less than other hotels. There are more soups and porridge. A large row. But the staple food is steamed buns. It is written on the sign. They said they were out of breakfast and dinner. They asked how many you wanted. If you wanted to eat, you had to wait. It took 20 minutes to steam. If you didn't tell them, they wouldn't prepare it. I don't understand why a buffet is made like ordering. But I can tell from the people eating. Although there are many people in the hotel, many of them are business people.

üé†There is a children's playground on the B1 floor. The first floor is for children to play. There are many rooms. There is also a small children's theater. Although there are no large game facilities, it is enough for children to play. There is also a chess and card room for adults. Mother and baby roomüöº. It closes at 9:30 pm. It is said that it is free for hotel guests. Those who come from outside are charged. In fact, there is no one to watch. Many people nearby come here to walk their children for free. Some even run back and forth in shoes. They also catch up with the ball pool to get new ocean balls. The children are still playing in it. The staff took the express ** bag and poured it directly into it. It was still the cleaning lady who found it in time. It was cleaned and disinfected at that time. The management staff also came to deal with the problem in time. In fact, whether the children's playground is charged or free, since it is in the hotel, there should be staff to watch it. It's OK when there are few children. When there are many children, some parents let their children play by themselves. Climbing frames are quite dangerous.

‚ùóÔ∏èAlthough there were some minor problems, the management handled them very well. In fact, taking remedial measures is secondary. We should still be more careful. For example, new toys need to be cleaned. It's common sense. Overall, the service is still very good.

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èBook a hotel and follow the navigation. Be sure to search for Seaview Garden Hotel. Otherwise, without the sea view, it will be another hotel [laughing and crying]
