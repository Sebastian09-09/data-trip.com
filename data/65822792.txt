I asked the front desk to send a new one. The attitude was very bad. A deposit of 1,500 yuan was collected for the second check-in, but it was refused to be refunded after leaving the hotel. The hotel front desk phone was called three times before it was connected. After contacting Ctrip customer service, it still refused to refund the deposit. The front desk service was extremely poor and disrespectful to the guests. I asked him if there was a manager who could help me deal with it, and he said no. Regarding the refund of the deposit, the front desk customer service kept arguing. First, they said that it would be credited within two hours. I waited from day to night and it still hadn't been credited. Then they said it would be credited in three days. The two front desk staff, one man and one woman, kept shirking each other's responsibility. One of the male front desk staff had a very bad attitude. He actually said, "Then you can give a bad review. It's none of my business whether the deposit is refunded or not." I've never seen such a thing in my life.

Service: I didn't expect that there are still hotels that require you to go downstairs to pick up takeout. Robots can't deliver takeout, and hotel service staff can't help deliver it. Everything seems to be in the epidemic stage. Takeout can only be placed on the table at the door and you can pick it up yourself. There is not even a takeout cabinet. There is no service staff at the door, and you have to carry your luggage yourself when you get off the bus. Such service in a five-star hotel is unacceptable.
The driver of the Disney shuttle service was rushing to get off work, and he almost collided with other cars while speeding all the way.

I met two young front desk staff, a man and a woman, who were very enthusiastic. They saw that we were taking care of the children, and even helped us upgrade to two levels and live directly in the executive suite. The suite is very spacious, with floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides. You can see the surrounding villa area and Lujiazui in the distance. The breakfast was great. I got a crayfish set for lunch, which I thought was pretty tasteless, but it turned out that the garlic flavor was quite delicious, and the rice cake base inside was very tasty. It was enough for two people! The hotel also has a shuttle bus to Disney, which is very cost-effective.

We took the initiative to call to find out which floor our breakfast was on and what the business hours were. We were not directed to the guest room elevator, and there was no service at all! There were two female managers standing at the elevator entrance chatting. We walked over to take the elevator and ignored us. Later, foreigners came to check in. They were very proactive in dragging their luggage, pressing the elevator button, and chatting. Why don't you be so worshipful to foreigners? ! I have a bad impression of Wyndham and even hurt it!

There are relatively few types of breakfast, and the taste is quite satisfactory. The meal is ready at 9:30, and I am really pressed for time when taking the children out. The front desk said that Shanghai's control is very tight, and disposable items must be collected at the front desk. However, the next day when I stayed at the Ritz, I didn't seem so embarrassed. I went upstairs with a bunch of slippers, toothbrushes, etc. I don't know if it was the tight control or the hotel's problem.

msg:We stayed for a total of five days and four nights. On the first day, our child was asked to walk softly and speak softly. However, our child did not run or yell in particular. He just walked normally with slippers on. We have specifically told him not to walk too loudly. The next day, they almost asked us to change rooms at 10:30 pm. We decided not to change because it was too inconvenient for us to take our children with us. Fortunately, they understood! Later, I decided to renew the purchase for two nights. The cleaning lady is very serious!

There is no swimming pool and the gym is huge.
I asked for an extra bed, but there was none on the first day. I asked for buckwheat pillows, but they were told there were five in the entire hotel, but they were gone.
The details are rough. The only advantage is that the room is large, and the rest are all disadvantages. Logically speaking, a new five-star hotel should have good facilities, and the toilet is not smart.
I made an appoin**ent for the shuttle bus back to Disneyland, and registered the passenger and contact information. However, no one called you when the time came. After the fireworks, many people took the children to the toilet, which delayed a bit of time. I arrived a little late and no one was waiting. you.
I will never come again, the experience was extremely bad! ! !

The house price in a remote place next to Pudong Airport is nearly 700 yuan. I arranged a room at the end. I said that I didn't like staying in the end room. The service staff said, "Then add 100 yuan to upgrade. It doesn't matter, it's just 100 yuan." "Breakfast", what does 100 yuan mean? Are all the waiters at Wyndham so awesome?
The room was very noisy, the glass was dirty, there was no soundproofing at all, and I couldn't rest well at night. A very weird room type, with a balcony-like aisle in the room.
The waiter is also cold, not to mention enthusiastic, but he is already pretty good at dealing with you. I wonder if the waiters are not happy at work.

The bottom of the curtains did not block the light, which made my eyes dazzle early in the morning. The air conditioning temperature was set to 30 degrees. The room was still the same. It was very cold and very noisy. There were no extra quilts in the other room with two children. Secondly, the sound insulation effect of the room was really bad. When the children called in the corridor and the next room made any noise, they could hear it. It's clear that it's so bad that it's not as good as a hotel

However, the next night we found the parking lot driver and said that we had not booked back to the hotel at all. The shuttle bus... It was so cold at night that we walked for 20 minutes and waited for more than half an hour to take a taxi back to the hotel... It was so speechless. The hotel also had no solution at all, so I just said sorry... …What’s the use of being sorry. Won't go there again.

When I checked in, I made a reservation for the shuttle bus to Disney for the next day. I would go there in the morning and return in the evening. It would be much more convenient to avoid waiting during the rush hour for taxis;
As a hotel of choice for travel, the overall experience is good. The hotel environment is clean, bright and comfortable;
Hotel services are basically online. The young lady and brother King at the front desk were enthusiastic and thoughtful in reminding us about the shuttle bus. The uncle at the door helped us deliver our luggage. The lady who cleans the guest rooms is also very good;
I don’t pay much attention to the situation around the hotel. I leave early and come back late. However, there is noise behind the hotel in the morning due to construction. If you don’t sleep well;
Generally speaking, it is your first choice when going to Disneyland or connecting flights. If you are in Pudong, the Chuansha area, it is worth recommending! [Rose]

After returning to the room and turning on the air conditioner for less than ten minutes, my throat felt extremely uncomfortable and itchy. I looked up at the air outlet of the air conditioner and saw the dust. It took less than fifteen minutes to clean the air conditioner filter from removal to completion. It was very difficult. Arrangements? I understand that the hotel does not plan for the Qing Dynasty, and the managers don’t care either.
Booked a Disney shuttle over the phone, reported room number, number of people, both sides, both sides, hung up the phone less than three minutes later, I called and asked, not to check, but to ask, twice, and when I told you, you should swat mosquitoes in your ears. Already?
I didn’t worry about calling the front desk to see if there was a greeting. When I answered the phone, there was no sound. I didn’t even say hello. When ordering, I made it very clear that I wanted Caesar salad. Follow me to the Chinese restaurant. What’s going on? Are the dishes on the Western menu produced by the kitchen? The phone at the Chinese restaurant rang for at least a minute, but no one answered it, and there was no call back to the switchboard.
I called the western restaurant and ordered salad instead of pasta. The girl who answered the phone at the western restaurant was very nice and knew that she would call back after confirmation. The girl who delivered the food was also very nice, but she couldn't chew the pasta. That's it. For the sake of the customer service lady and the food delivery girl, forget it. I'm too lazy to complain.
The Wyndham brand charges management fees and does not interfere with operations, so it is understandable that there are no standards, but would the owner consider changing to a general manager with management capabilities? These loopholes are not a regulatory issue of one depar**ent. Of course, it may also be because it is so close to Disney that customer reviews don’t matter. So I sincerely hope that another hotel will open nearby to replace you in three to five years. After all, after three years of opening, the customer reviews have dropped to 4.5, which also shows that If your hotel doesn't pay attention to it, then I wish the business will always be "booming".

This is the first time I've ever stayed in a hotel and I didn't inform them. It's even more cruel. Unfortunately, we arrived at 9:30 with our children, and we had already begged the waiter to let us get something for the children to eat later, but no one paid attention to us, just like we were competing to see who could move faster (put away the tableware first) , it depends on how you take things)😱😱, I would like to ask the management, after collecting the breakfast, should they throw it away or give it to the employees? So much so that the employees are so motivated. It’s really hard to imagine that those expressionless people who compete with the guests and quickly collect the food are five-star waiters or the enemies of our guests.

msg:I went to Shanghai Disneyland and chose this hotel. It is a 20-minute drive from Disney, with two buses in the morning and evening. The bus in the morning was quite satisfactory, but the one in the evening was really hard to describe. The hotel notice states that the car has the hotel's logo, and that the shuttle bus leaves at nine o'clock and ten o'clock. After playing Disney that day, I went to the fourth row of the Donald Duck parking lot and found a car with the hotel's logo, but the door was not open and the driver was not there. There were drivers all around waiting for passengers with their doors open, so I called the hotel and waited for a reply. At nine o'clock, a driver came, moved the car, and left. We followed the driver and saw another bus. There was no hotel LOGO or any markings on the bus. The driver said: "Don't make a mistake by taking the bus to Wyndham." Then the people who got on the bus behind us were anxious and worried. Are you in the right car? It really casts a shadow over the happy Disney trip!
In addition, there are very few breakfast options in the hotel. The soundproofing of the room is very poor, and the sounds in the corridor can be heard clearly.
All in all, I will not stay at this hotel again in the future.

msg:The room was okay, but there was no window. We stayed for two nights. Mother and daughter always bring their own towels and bath towels when staying in any star-rated hotel. They never use hotel towels. They use them to cushion the stools and sofas. Ask the cleaning lady how to wash your face. Only one-third of the towels are wet, because they are only used to wipe off the countertop, and only one-third is used, and will not be used on the face or body at all. In the afternoon, the hotel front desk called and said that a towel was missing, right? We took it, but before I could finish my words, I said I had to pay. I was afraid to even use it. How could I take a towel from you? When I came back from Disney that night, I checked on the cleaning of the room, and found that one hair was missing. I was also surprised why only one was taken away, and the bathrobe on the stool was not taken away, nor was a new one added to the bathroom. I have added new bath towels. I have been to so many five- and four-star hotels and I have never encountered this problem of not changing into bath clothes! I hope you will reflect on it and train your waiters to not ask customers if they have taken it. Although it is a small matter, it is really uncomfortable and that’s why I wrote so many comments!

It's unbelievable for a 5-star hotel to treat guests like this. I had a good impression of the hotel I stayed in Hongqiao District yesterday, but not the one in Pudong. The manager of this store should think about it. Hospitality is interactive, and it is easy to gain or lose a customer.

I booked it for 3 days, but every night when I went back, the door couldn't be opened. Fortunately, I had to go to the front desk to change the card. This is really bad.
Why can't it be done right the first time? I come back very tired every night and stand at the door with my child in my arms waiting for the room key. I am really speechless.

msg:It was the first time I saw that a five-star hotel can have worse hygiene and service than a portable hotel. When I walked into the room, I felt a bit smelly. Later I called the front desk and asked the front desk that their exhaust system was automatically controlled. After we finished dinner When we returned to the room, the toilet smelled terrible. We contacted customer service and sent a staff member to check. The young man said no, it was too smelly before even entering the toilet. We were asked to contact us to change the room ourselves. But we waited until we could change the room. When the staff came, we hadn't packed our things yet, so they asked us to give them our room keys. What kind of magical operation was this? As a result, the phone in a new room didn't work, so I called on my mobile phone, and they actually said it was because they were talking! Are busy and unavailable the same situation? At least the light can be on when the line is busy, right? This is the first time I have seen that five-star service can be so bad, and the hygiene can be so bad.

I needed to book a hotel car to pick me up from the airport, so Manager Zhou got in touch with me, and he thoughtfully arranged the hotel drop-off service. Then I informed on WeChat that the guest was an old man in his eighties. Perhaps because Europeans are relatively independent, he has been unwilling to let us accompany him. After Manager Zhou learned about this situation, he took the initiative to say that he would accompany the guests throughout the entire process when they checked in. In addition, he would also accompany the guests throughout the airport drop-off process until they were sent to the customs office! And they shared the itinerary and photos with me throughout the whole process, which made me feel very at ease! I believe that with such employees in this hotel, this hotel will definitely be excellent! I don’t know how to express my gratitude. I always feel that just writing good reviews is not enough. I hope that Manager Zhou can make greater progress in his work and your hotel can also prosper!

The hotel has a shuttle bus to and from Disney every morning and evening, especially the shuttle bus back at night. The driver will call in advance to inform you of the parking location, which is very considerate.
The hotel lobby, facilities and environment maintain the style of Wyndham; I like the bathroom in the room the most, with an oversized sink and a full-length polishable makeup mirror, which makes me feel good after washing😌

msg:The room was a bit cold and the air conditioner needed to be turned on at full capacity. The service couldn't keep up. My daughter was sick and couldn't go downstairs to get medicine. I called the front desk and said they were busy downstairs and asked me to get it myself. My daughter was sick and didn't go downstairs. I was speechless. In the end, after three calls, the robot delivered the medicine more than half an hour later. If it wasn't necessary, I would have gone down and picked it up myself, and I wouldn't have been able to provide this service. The waiter who went to get some bread for breakfast cleared away the tables. He couldn't see the vegetables and fruits he had just brought back, and they were all dumped before they could be eaten. Can't wait even a minute. It's not far from Disney, and there is a shuttle bus back at night. This is the only convenient place. The service is really bad.

At around 10 o'clock in the evening, the master couldn't fix it. I asked the front desk to change the room. As a result, the hotel staff came in and said that he didn't feel cold and said that there was no room. I dismissed it and didn't propose a solution. The man who repaired the air conditioner said to ask the front desk to provide warm air, but it took a long time to bring it. The service attitude was average.

I can't hear the words "please, thank you, you". When making a car appoin**ent or afternoon tea, you must answer one. The exact time. If you are not sure about the answer, the front desk will say that you will not be able to sit down if you don't ask for an appoin**ent. It seems to be threatening you... The facilities in the room are also average, and the TV does not even have a screen. The location of the hotel is also remote. When the taxi reaches the entrance, it won't automatically lift the lever, and there is no one there. In the end, we had to get out of the car, drag our luggage and walk in. It's so bad that we won't choose it when we go to Disneyland in the future...

After checking in, I brought some items that needed to be mailed because I am not in China usually, so some things were not available. Got it, I didn’t know how to place the express delivery, so I found Mr. Zhou, the service manager in the hotel lobby, for help. In the afternoon, the lobby was full of guests and it was too busy. We added each other on WeChat and he helped me place the order and arrange for the express delivery, which saved me the trouble. There are many things and the service is perfect. I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:It is advertised as a 5-star hotel, but the service can be said to be very poor. The attitude of the front desk is cold and cold. Normally, when guests ask for a good talk, they will be cold and unresolved. Only when they lose their temper will they try to find a way to solve the guest's problem. Incident 1: I bought some medicine online in the morning and called the front desk to ask for them to be delivered to me. The result was that the hotel did not handle the medicines and asked me to go downstairs to get them. This reason made sense, so I asked the front desk what items could be delivered to the room. The front desk said Ordinary takeout is fine. After taking a shower in the evening, I ordered a takeaway and called the front desk to have it delivered to the room. However, the front desk told me that food could not be delivered to the room and that I had to go downstairs to get it myself. I asked what I could touch, and the front desk said that the needs of customers such as medicines were very urgent. It can be delivered to the room, and I got angry at that time. Isn't this treating the guests like monkeys? Without this room delivery service, it's okay if I don't have it. They insist on treating me like a **, which is very annoying! I asked the front desk why the statement was different in the morning and at night. The front desk hesitated and finally said that it mainly depends on whether they have free manpower and has nothing to do with the items. I said a few words to him (no swear words). The front desk did not apologize at all. I was helpless. I can only hang up the phone
Incident 2: One day when I returned to the hotel and was getting ready to go to bed at 1pm, I found that the light switch in the bathroom was broken and could not be turned off. There was a layer of glass between the bathroom and the bedroom, and it was very bright and I couldn’t sleep. I called the front desk and asked someone to fix it. The front desk directly told me that the maintenance workers were off work and couldn't repair it. I was already angry about the takeout incident, so I just said, "Is it possible that I won't sleep if the light is on all night?" The front desk saw that I was already angry. I asked my colleagues for help, but the maintenance man came within 2 minutes and repaired it in 1 minute. It was obvious that there were maintenance workers on duty. When the front desk encountered a guest's problem, the first thing he did was not think about how to solve it. It is better to do less than to do more. Only when you encounter someone with a tough attitude do you think of a solution. What kind of hotel service is this? I am speechless. B&Bs have better service than you. You simply don’t take your guests seriously!
I won’t talk about the little things that are unpleasant to me. In short, after experiencing it, in one sentence, the service is terrible! It’s impossible to stay at a hotel with this kind of indifferent attitude toward guests, and I definitely won’t recommend it to others!

The housekeeping depar**ent actually said that the indoor temperature in the south was just this temperature. I was speechless. Finally, the heater kept the temperature and buzzed all night. It's very unreasonable that Wyndham charges a deposit even though it's obviously free of charge if you have a good reputation, and it's not refundable after check-out, but 24 hours later. After feedback to Ctrip, Ctrip is still very trustworthy and protects consumers. It actively coordinates and follows up. Although it was returned a day later, the process was very uncomfortable. Thank you Ctrip. Later, when I read the reviews of sweet potatoes, I realized that I was not the only one who felt this way.

msg:I am a service trainer myself. I took my daughter to play in Disney in the summer vacation. I originally planned to stay in the Disney Hotel or the Toy Story Hotel, but the price is indeed too high, and I have to stay in Disneyland during the day. I don’t think I have time to enjoy it in the hotel. , so I chose the Wyndham Hotel. Considering that it is 15 minutes away from Disney, it is convenient to take a taxi. The hotel is also equipped with a bus to pick up the hotel after the Disney fireworks show at night, so as to avoid tens of thousands of people leaving the park at the same time and not being able to take a taxi. Embarrassing, the internal facilities of the hotel are still very refreshing and clean, especially at night, it is very quiet, and you can have a good sleep to ensure the mental state of Disney the next day, which is very good. The price/performance ratio of the hotel is relatively high. Two nights are definitely needed, and you must have a good rest the next day after playing. Considering that the children got up too late the next day after being tired from playing, the hotel also arranged a late check-out service for us, so that we had enough time to rest and not pack up our luggage nervously. The little friends were also very happy 😃, a good journey , recommended~

Let’s talk about the overall layout first. The bathroom takes up one-third of the area. The room is actually not very big, especially for two adults and one child with a baby. The big bed will be a bit cramped, and two adults want to sleep on the sofa.
Secondly, the cleanliness of the room is given 4.5 points (out of 5 points). The hotel as a whole should be very new, but there are many stains in the corners of the room and on the sofa.
The business suite is on the 21st floor of the highest floor, and you must check in at 2 pm, even half an hour earlier! We didn't check in until about 3 o'clock. The front desk said it was ventilating, and the previous person was smoking in the room, so we waited an extra hour and waited in the lobby
In the hotel introduction, it is written that there is a children's playground. In fact, there is only a big bear in the lobby on the first floor, and there is a small room for younger children to play in the restaurant (such as eating in)
The hotel does not have a swimming pool, and the gym does not seem to be seen on the sign icon of the elevator room. There are few recreational activities in the hotel itself
The room service is good, food and beverages can be delivered, and the taste is good, and the hotel has a lot of breakfast varieties
Generally speaking, the price is 2 nights, and the price/performance ratio is average

2. Praise the hotel's Disney shuttle bus, it is really convenient! ! ! It was 7:20 and 8:20 in the morning. We didn’t catch up. We thought it was too early. We made an appoin**ent because there were too many people coming back at night. There are 9:00 and 10:00, and 9:00 is good. It's just right to go to the store to buy something after the fireworks show.
3. The hotel is very new, and the sanitation is very clean. The only thing I feel is a bit of decoration, but it doesn't hurt.

5. Will choose again next time
6. The price is also very reasonable, more than 600 per night on weekends
Facilities: good

Ms. Zhang Li at the front desk is so awesome. When we left, we accidentally left the child's water glass in the room, so we quickly contacted Ms. Zhang Li at the front desk, and she immediately asked Shansong to send the child's water glass to the airport for us. After returning to Beijing, I found that the child's clothes were left in the hotel room. I contacted her again, and she was very enthusiastic to help us mail the clothes back. It is really troublesome for you. I will definitely come to live here next time! Just go to Zhang Li and give the hotel a big, big, big, big high praise! ! !

msg:The room is quite comfortable and clean. The only problem is the service. The waiter at the check-in last night was enthusiastic, but the waiter at the luggage desk when I checked out this morning was completely different. In the lobby elevator, I saw a female guest carrying a lot of things, and the suitcase could not be pushed normally. She was walking forward on her legs. After looking back for a few times, she went straight to the concierge desk and stood still. She was also wearing the concierge desk uniform. It's definitely the staff at the door. Fortunately, I walked a few steps and saw my colleagues in the lobby. I had someone to help me, otherwise I would have been very embarrassed when I went out. So what exactly is the luggage rack used for? Just store luggage? Even though he saw that the guest had too much luggage, he didn't mean to help at all. This service should really be strengthened.

msg:Because it is also the first time to live in such a cheap Disney hotel. Talk about your personal real feelings, for your reference.
￼As a hotel that is mainly convenient to go to Disney, I can only score three points here.
1. The transportation is inconvenient, and it takes about half an hour to drive there from the hotel.
2. The parking location is too far away. Park in the Donald Duck parking lot. The Donald Duck parking lot is still far away from Disneyland. In addition, the staff will set up fences to limit the flow and keep walking around the lake. If there is a large flow of people, walk to Disneyland I feel like it will take more than 40 minutes at the door.
3. The shuttle bus to Disneyland is not flexible (this is particularly fatal). There are two shifts each in the morning and evening, and you have to make an appoin**ent one day in advance. It’s okay to say in the morning, just get up early and control the time yourself. If Disney doesn’t release the first fireworks at night, it will only show the second one at 9:15 p.m., plus the flow of people leaving, plus the distance to the Donald Duck parking lot, plus the large and inflexible children’s stroller , In addition to queuing for a whole day, my legs didn't work, I couldn't make it to the parking lot at 10 o'clock, I called the staff, the solution was just to let us hurry up and leave on time at 10 o'clock. We are not special forces and we can't do it no matter how we run. What if the last bus at 10 o’clock can’t make it? The hotel’s solution is to take a taxi back to the hotel. Well, let’s go back to the first question. The hotel is more than 10 kilometers away from Disney, so you can calculate how much the taxi costs Calculate.
4. The service is okay, four points for the front desk and five points for the cleaning lady.
5. When I set the hotel price, it was more than 580 per night.
You can refer to the following, make a comprehensive comparison, and choose a satisfactory play plan

msg:A very bad experience. This is the first time I have written a negative review in so many years using Ctrip! I booked this hotel because I decided to go to Disneyland on the spur of the moment. The hotel in the park was full. I thought Wyndham was a chain and the service was guaranteed. The result was super disappointing! ! !

Disneyland and Pudong Airport shuttle bus service: The hotel relies on Disney for business and has a shuttle bus. I made a reservation with the front desk for the pick-up schedule one day in advance. The front desk said that 21 o'clock and 22 o'clock are optional. When I asked the front desk what time the park closed, the front desk said 9:30 pm, so I chose 22:00. Who knew this was the beginning of a big pit! In fact, Disney closes at 20 o'clock and starts clearing out guests! 20-20:30 is the last time for everyone to shop and check out, and the staff starts to rush people away. So after 20:30, there is nowhere to go! The temperature in Shanghai dropped sharply and there was a strong wind warning. Because I was deceived by the front desk and made a reservation for the 22:00 shuttle bus, I had to take refuge in a Starbucks outside the park, but Starbucks also had to close later. I walked from Starbucks to the parking lot at around nine o'clock. I arrived at the hotel parking space at 9:40, but there was no car! There were only buses from other hotels before and after, and no Wyndham cars, so we had to wait in the freezing cold in a deserted parking lot. I started calling the hotel shortly before 22:00, but didn't get through. By 22:00 there was still no car! When I called the hotel at 22:01, the front desk said "the driver has already driven away"! The front desk thought I was late, so I said I had been standing here for 20 minutes, and neither the driver nor the car were there! And at the request of the front desk, I took a video to prove that the parking space I was in was correct! After the front desk contacted the driver, he insisted that he had not picked up the person and refused to come back. The front desk asked me to take a taxi and go back to the hotel first.

Service: When I returned to the hotel, I told the front desk sincerely, "No one is short of the taxi fare, but your driver really has no service, so you can't lie like this." But the front desk kept trying to excuse the driver, showing me the driver’s reply in the WeChat group, saying that the driver said he was waiting, wondering if I didn’t see the car, and saying that the driver called me at 9:30...as if the driver was the hotel General manager, whatever you say is imperial edict. First of all, it is normal for the driver to call and not hear anything. Disney always has music and there are a lot of people leaving the show. I put my phone in my bag, so I just didn’t hear it. But this has nothing to do with your shuttle not picking up people! I booked a car at 22:00 and wanted to finish work early. When I couldn’t get through to the phone at 9:30, I pretended that the guest was late and ran away early! Let alone professionalism, is this something done by a conscientious person? The front desk said that I couldn't find a parking space myself, so I stood there and took a video for you. It's not wrong at all. Drivers from other hotels around are also there. No one is blind. They can't see your transparent shuttle bus, right?
The front desk made excuses for the driver, thinking that the customer was a nuisance. Speechless and chilling! I don’t know if the driver is your boss or a relative of the hotel’s Shenma people. Taking this job is like a gift to your hotel!
Later, a foreman-like person came and started talking to me, asking the front desk to ask the driver tomorrow and give me an answer. But the result is that the hotel never gave any reply, whether it was a reasonable explanation, apology, or compensation for the fare, nothing! Just pretend this incident never happened and never contact the customer again!
The service attitude of the hotel staff is really terrible. First the wrong message is given, then the driver fails to perform his duties and lies, and then all employees cooperate with the lie!

I would like to ask if a family is traveling with the elderly and young children. In the high temperature and cold wind of Shanghai winter night, they cannot wait for a car, and the driver refuses to lend it to others and lies. What should the elderly and children do if they get sick? (In fact, I left Shanghai for the second time. Are you sick and have a fever every day)? If there is a conflict between the driver and the passenger, something breaks the law or harms the passenger, and the hotel takes the side of the driver and works together to frame the guest, then how dangerous is the guest? (It’s terrible for a hotel that doesn’t even ask about the facts and only treats guests’ complaints as trouble!)

I will never stay at any Wyndham hotel again! I will definitely not let friends around me stay here again! Please keep your eyes open and don’t bring personal safety risks to yourself and your family!

Wyndham actually checked it out and the online reviews were not high because Atour on the first day was really bad. I went to stay at Wyndham, only to find that Wyndham was not as bad as my online reviews. The room was large, the hotel lobby was grand, and the front desk service was very friendly. It's much better than Atour in Pudong. The only flaw is that the concierge at the hotel door is not enthusiastic enough and will not take the initiative to help. I would like to remind friends who want to go to Disneyland, don’t look at the online comment section and stay at Atour next to it. Come and stay at Wyndham. It is really much better, and there is also the hotel’s own shuttle bus to and from Disney. Atour is really good at paying for it.

1. After checking in at the lobby, you have to drag your luggage to another building.
2. What I put was the worst water, ice dew (where did I put my grade?
3. The room is ridiculously small and the toilet takes up more than half of it.
4. Don’t choose the one without windows. You will suffocate yourself to death (if you don’t check in at 11 o’clock, you can just choose...
5. There is still noise in the room
After staying here, I realized that the reason for so many bad reviews is there. I would really appreciate it.

Inconvenient: There is no robot to deliver the takeaway, so you have to come down and get it yourself. quite inconvenient
Breakfast: The porridge for breakfast is made of boiled rice mixed with water, not raw rice. I don’t think it tastes good, and the fruit I picked up from the fruit basket was rotten. I have lived in five-star, four-star and three-star restaurants in Shanghai on business trips, and I have eaten noodles many times. The worst one is Pudong Wyndham.
On the whole, Shanghai is not a tourist city, and it does not have the trea**ent of Suzhou Wyndham. In addition, it is close to Disney, and there is no shortage of customer traffic. Except that the bathroom meets the price standard, I can only give three stars

Especially when you come back at night, it is very convenient to go directly to the hotel without queuing for a taxi! When we left, the master at the door was very caring. He watched us take care of the children and helped us put our luggage in the car! I will stay in this hotel again next time! Specially photographed the name of the master! Thank you~ You can also store luggage for free! No need to store in Disney! Save money again! Take a taxi to Disneyland for around 40!

msg:Extremely bad experience, the worst two times I stayed at this hotel. The room smelled very bad, and there were piles of hair on the floor. The day before, there were toothpaste bottle caps left on the sink, two bottles of shampoo, and no shower gel and other low-level hygiene problems. I booked two rooms and told the front desk to arrange a nearby room. They agreed very well and said that the card would be issued and sent to the room. However, the card was not sent in the afternoon and evening. At around 1 o'clock in the night, I received family members and went to the front desk to get the card. , I temporarily opened a room that was the farthest away. I said, didn't I ask you to keep the room at noon? The front desk said I'm sorry, it's the peak tourist season, there are no rooms, and this is the only one far away. When he said this, he didn't even dare to look at me. He lied boldly, forgetting to reserve a room next to his room and reserve a card. He was unwilling to admit it or express his apology. Another thing is that we have to go to Disneyland early on the 30th and don’t have time to have breakfast. I hope to move the breakfast for four people to the next day. We still have three days of accommodation, so we will have to buy one less breakfast later. We need to call the front desk and they will handle it. No, the manager answered the phone and said he would call me back in 10 minutes, but he never called me back. This kind of garbage management is also 5-star. It is so funny that it is unimaginable. I read some reviews and found that there are many one-star reviews. I'm so angry. This hotel is in a state of disrepair. It's habitually left in a state of disrepair. I'd only praise them for not wanting to make progress. They're just dawdling around waiting to close.

msg:After checking in, I found in the bathroom at 10pm that the previous guest's underwear had not been cleaned. After contacting the front desk, the housekeeping manager came to the room to communicate. The manager cleaned up the clothes and came to the room again to communicate and said that he would personally pay 500 yuan as compensation. This handling method was not accepted on the spot, because what happened in the hotel should be compensated by the hotel, and the manager's personal compensation was not accepted. Since I brought my child late that day, it was too difficult to check out or change rooms, so I reluctantly continued to check in. It is recommended to negotiate the next day. Before check-out the next day, the manager brought a foreman who completely refused to admit that such a low-level mistake had not been made in their hotel. This meant that the guest acted on his own initiative just to seek compensation. At this time, the guest felt extremely helpless and aggrieved. The poor hygiene, service, and attitude of the hotel not only made me feel disgusted, but also caused mental harm.

There was a constant beeping sound. The phone at the front desk was on auto. When I got down the elevator, I realized that the entire hotel was out of power and I almost closed the door. It took a long time to deal with it, and it was repeated over and over again. After a night of tossing, I couldn't sleep at all, which affected my travel the next day. The key is that the hotel had no explanation for this incident. It didn't take the initiative to contact the customer throughout the day to apologize and explain compensation measures. If you don't take the initiative to mention it when checking out, just pretend that nothing happened. If you mention it, there will be no discount.

msg:As a five-diamond hotel, there is almost no service at all. After arriving at the hotel, there is no concierge service at the door. There is only one waiter at the front desk to check in at around ten o'clock in the evening. After waiting for a while, another waiter came to check in slowly. After arriving in the room, the most speechless thing is that there are urine and feces stains on the toilet seat in the bathroom. This is the first time this has happened in so many hotels. It is really disgusting. When I reported it to the front desk, the front desk just looked up at me. He told me lightly to ask the waiter to take a look. He didn't realize the seriousness of the hygiene problem. Now that all kinds of viruses are flooding, I know if the guest who left the stain is a virus carrier? The service attitude at the front desk is really bad, there is no sense of service at all, I complained to the manager on duty, but I just nodded and agreed, there is no substantive solution, after changing the room, there are still hygiene problems, there are oil stains and dust on the table, on the bedside table It's also a layer of dust. I was too tired after playing Disney for two days, and I haven't had dinner yet. I waited for ten minutes to check in at the store, another ten minutes for the manager on duty, and fifteen minutes for changing rooms. I dare not just wait for them to solve the problem and wait for so long without a substantive solution. Is this the hygienic standard of Ctrip's Five Diamond Hotel? I really can't agree, the worst experience during my trip to Shanghai has already been complained to the local health bureau and epidemic prevention depar**ent!

Hygiene: In general, exposed wires can be seen in the bathroom. When I first checked in, I opened the toilet lid and saw a piece of paper floating on the water

Service: Average, very average, this is the first time I stayed in a hotel and didn't change the bedding. I stayed for 2 consecutive days. When I went back halfway, I saw that the quilt and pillows had been placed, but the creases and dust on the bedding could tell that it was not a new bedding. It’s fine if you’re staying in a B&B, but why are you so lazy in a hotel that costs 500 a day? In the middle, there are no supplements such as slippers.

On the second day of the ***** New Year on the 23rd, return to the hotel around 22 (staying for the second night). The wind was strong, and there was a roaring sound from the air leaking from the bed in the bedroom. I called the front desk three times and waited for 30 minutes, but no engineering staff came to the door. Finally, the front desk staff came to the door by themselves, saying that the engineering staff was repairing something and had no time to come. . . The front desk staff went into the room and fiddled for a long time and found that they couldn't solve this problem. Later, they took a wide tape and said to stick the window up. . . The result is useless. I then proposed to change the room, and told me that there was only a twin room of 780 yuan that could be changed, but I checked with Ctrip and Fliggy that night there was still a room with the same price as mine, and the hotel replied that the platform system was lagging. . . Reluctantly wanting to sleep peacefully, I changed to a twin room.
For such a large hotel chain, even during holidays, no engineering personnel were present within 30 minutes of a breakdown. I didn't feel any apology from the hotel, not even a word of apology when I checked out. At 12 o'clock at night, I took 2 suitcases and 2 bags, and carried my sleeping son to the downstairs room for 3.4 times.

The sound insulation of the room is very poor, and the alarm clock in the next room seems to be the same as that of my own room. There are no convenience stores nearby, and everything has to be taken out or run errands. Although the hotel is non-smoking, lighters or matches are not provided, and smoking at the door is impossible. Smokers who have just got off the plane should pay attention. There are very few types of breakfast, it can only be said to be ordinary, you can consider buying McDonald's breakfast takeaway without breakfast. If you want to be more convenient, you need to go to the nearby Greenland Plaza to find other hotels, because all the supporting facilities are there. The glass of the shower room is translucent. If you are on a business trip, it is not recommended to share a room with two people, because you can see it and get drunk 😵‍💫.

Disadvantages: The breakfast is not very rich, I don't know if the occupancy rate is not high? In addition, the location is slightly off, there is no convenience store nearby, it is not very convenient to buy some small things.
Overall, if you go to Disney instead of staying in Disneytown, it is a very good choice, the children are very happy to live there🥳

The location of the hotel is relatively remote, and it is a bit inconvenient to not have a convenience store.
The main complaint is that the hotel's sound insulation is a bit poor. In the early morning, the cleaning auntie's walkie-talkie is invincible and loud, and the door to the room can't be opened. If you get up late, you will be disturbed.

It's clean, the room is big, the bed is comfortable, the toiletries are from the hotel's own brand, and the tea bags are from Lipton. The hotel upgraded the senior deluxe double room for free, and brought a small tea room, just for takeaway! The hotel has a service of delivering food to the room, but it is only until 10 p.m., so when you come back from Disney and want to eat, you can only order takeout, but there are no delicious takeaways around. The next day, I ordered the hotel to deliver the meal at noon. The fried rice was relatively light, the four-season roasted bran was delicious, and the fruit was also delivered! really not bad! The hotel has packaged Disney transfers, leaving on time at 7:40 in the morning, waiting for no one, it is best to come down 5 minutes earlier. Come back on time at 10 pm, and it's very convenient to come back without taking a taxi!

We waited for a long time at the front desk of Block B with the child in our arms. The key was that there were no chairs at the front desk. ! Later, when I met the waiter, I helped to change the card! Otherwise, we would have to walk to Block A with the baby in our arms. The key point is that it is very cold at night! ! ! The waiter also told us that our crib was sent to the wrong room! The little girl at the front desk is really unreliable! There was a problem with the purifier in the room. Later, maintenance personnel were sent over. After working for a long time, they were not able to fix it. They were told that it was a heater. You have an air conditioner and don’t need to fix it, so I left! Later, we researched it ourselves, and it was done! Key master, do you think we are stupid? Is it because we don’t understand purifiers? ? ?

You can take a bath and go to the toilet inside, isn't it embarrassing? Changed to a family suite, but there were no children's toiletries, and I was forced to use an adult glass to brush my teeth. My son couldn't hold it and broke it, and the compensation was 30 yuan. Haha, I can only say that I am too speechless.

The independent tatami leisure space can drink tea, chat and work. This design left a very good impression on me. The bathroom is also big and comfortable. The parking is convenient, the hotel breakfast is ok, the taste is good, but the variety is not rich, the price is a bit low for children to buy half price. Dinner can be a la carte, buffet price is not high. The space for children to play is a bit small, but the public space is still ok, and the parent-child experience is generally good. The hotel service is good, it can meet the five-diamond standard, and I hope to make persistent efforts! The surrounding area is relatively desolate, and the lively Chuansha Commercial Plaza is about 10-15 minutes' walk away, which is acceptable. Many guests who go to Disney stay here for a good price because there is a free shuttle bus. During the epidemic period, we cannot leave Shanghai. It is a very good choice to take a vacation here. I hope the hotel can carry out more activities to enrich the guest's stay experience.

msg:It seems that the room rate is cheap but the price is not high. The experience is really bad. The only one who pays the bill may be the Wyndham brand, but I am really disappointed with the current Wyndham operation and management. As a full service hotel Actually it feels similar to the whole season. It is completely incomparable with the equivalent Marriott and Hyatt.
Let me talk to the hotel management and owners about my feelings.
1. There are more than 50 TV stations, 90% of which are domestic channels and 10% are satellite channels. (But there is no such channel as the standard Phoenix TV.) It's really surprising.
2. I booked an executive room with a higher price, because I checked in very late after I took a shower and went to bed at more than 11 o’clock in the evening. I found that it was a bit hot after the shower. At this time, I discovered that the air conditioner was broken! Only hot air is emitted, but not cooling at all. Because it was too late, I finished washing and I was not happy to contact the front desk to send someone to see it. So I could only open the window to let the wind out, and then two mosquitoes flew around while I was sleeping and struggled for a long time.
Then there is the key point. At about 3:30 in the morning, the construction site opposite the hotel began to enter and exit with a large number of construction vehicles to start watering and other operations, which was very noisy! But when I checked in, there was no front desk telling me about construction, nor did I arrange a relatively quiet room for me. (The general manager of your hotel must not live on the 2105 side, right) I originally came out to relax and then I really didn't rest all night. I can't accept this very much. The executive room was checked out the next day and no one asked me how my stay was
3. I personally feel that the hotel’s breakfast is really bad. Regardless of the type, freshness and taste of the breakfast, it’s almost the same as a business hotel and does not match Wyndham’s brand.
4. Drinks in the executive lounge cannot be taken away and must be consumed in the lounge is also a weird rule (your lounge and lobby are combined, where does the executive lounge feel) I just want to drink a can of Coke and have to sit foolishly I can only leave after drinking there

Conclusion: I was very disappointed and had a very bad experience. There are some small details that I can't complain about. I hope that the owners and hotel operators can improve. Please be worthy of the Wyndham brand and don't widen the gap with Hyatt Marriott. Let the engineering depar**ent check the facilities in the rooms and public areas. Strengthen training, the front desk and lobby bar service can be more enthusiastic, don't look cold.

msg:Wyndham used to see it during travel or travel bookings, but I have never stayed. This time I booked it in the screening area~ but this accommodation experience is really bad, and I will not treat Wyndham in the future. Would book again
The hotel environment is quite ok, but the handling and service attitude of the encounters really cannot make people think that this is a four- or five-star hotel.
I went out to play during the day and came back to bathe the child at about nine o’clock in the evening. I quickly washed it and found that the bathroom barrier had fallen off. The water in the shower room flowed directly to the bathroom and room just like the video.
Then I called the front desk from my room, and no one answered after 10 minutes, including emergency service calls, so I could only get off the front desk to respond.
Then he said to arrange maintenance personnel and service personnel to repair and scrub, and did not mention changing the room at all. Because the maintenance time will be longer and it will affect the child’s sleep, I strongly request to change the room, and then the manager’s operation is accepted. Normally, other five-star hotels will arrange for the same room type or upgrade, and he will change me a room For rooms with cheaper prices, there is no indication from beginning to end how to deal with this price difference.
Since I originally booked a children's themed room, I took a child to change to a downgraded room, so I totally disagreed with the replacement and had no choice but to wait for the maintenance staff to fix it. At the same time, we asked to change to another room with the same theme tomorrow. The service staff said that it was possible. We would confirm which room to change to as soon as possible. Then there was no reply for more than an hour, and I would go to the front desk again. No one answered at the time) asked, the service staff said that they had forgotten about it.
It's about 11 o'clock after the busy work, the water retaining ***** has been applied with a thick glue, and the adult can take a bath when it dries. The very choking glue smell in the shower during the bath made people cry.
When we were outing the next day, a hotel staff called to apologize and prepared a better fruit plate for us and put it in the room. When we came back at around 5pm, we found that there was none. The staff said that Make sure it’s fresh and want to wait until we come back to prepare, and ask which dragon fruit, cantaloupe, and pineapple you want. I said that you can prepare the fruit plate and bring two small cakes for the child. I waited for about an hour to deliver it (I thought I had prepared it carefully). There were indeed two small cakes from the morning buffet, but it was completely different from the fruit plate I imagined. It contained an apple, a pear and an orange (at the time) I forgot to take pictures). They were all unpeeled and uncut. I once again apologized to the hotel and admired.
I personally feel that the staff's ability to deal with complaints and service attitudes really have a lot of room for improvement and improvement.

First: There is a large construction site next to the hotel. Construction starts at 6 o'clock in the morning. It is impossible not to wake up!
Second: Speaking of service, in February, there was no epidemic in Shanghai. When the revolving door was not opened, there was no service at all in the foyer. The doorman sat behind a chair with an expressionless face.
Third: The invoice was not received after leaving the store.
Fourth: New problems arise because the invoice has not been received...
I called the front desk and told me that the email could not be sent now because it had become a quarantine hotel and it would take 1-2 months before it could be sent.
Well, I expressed my understanding during the epidemic, and then told me while laughing, you will call us in 1-2 months to ask us to issue an invoice, and specifically told me that you took the initiative to call. As a hotel employee, when I questioned the service attitude, the little sister said with disdain (I made up my mind based on the voice), what's your name...

msg:Stayed for two nights, the room was quite big, but the airtight room still smelled of decoration when I just entered, and it will be much better after ventilation. Fortunately, it was very windy that day, as soon as the window was opened, the large French window balcony was indeed very good. It feels very comfortable, except that there is no swimming pool for the five-diamond, and the restaurant on the second floor ate for two consecutive days. On the second day, the waiter miscalculated the bill and calculated it by dozens of dollars. Fortunately, I have The habit of reading the order, I found out that it was not right, otherwise, it would cost an extra 50 yuan. Another thing that was not good was that all the waiters at the front desk did not smile. We two old people, two children, plus me a woman, waiter Seeing that we were holding four big boxes, we didn't ask if we could help! What, so I still feel a little uncomfortable, after all, the hotel is not cheap, and it is still linked to the Wyndham chain brand, and it is not far to drive to Disney for about 15 minutes. You can choose to take the hotel car, but you have to make an appoin**ent one day in advance, so we didn't take the ride and drove directly.

msg:Location traffic is average, travel by taxi. The hotel facilities are good, the rooms are relatively large, the hotel facilities are relatively new, and the maintenance is good. Hotel service is also available, and the service is prompt and warm. The shuttle bus to Disney is also very convenient in the morning and evening, especially after watching the light show, there must be a car to pick up, otherwise there is no way to return with the children. The hotel is good in all aspects, the only shortcoming is that there is a tatami in the room. Although it is convenient for drinking tea and sitting, the small square table is too square and the corners of the table are too sharp and easy to hurt the children. The hotel can deal with it later.

msg:Special thanks to KIMI Yang, such a good comrade deserves to be seen by the leader, there are two special thanks. First, I checked in at 12:30 noon. Kimi Yang helped me rent a baby stroller and let me get it at 1:30. Without delaying the entrance ticket in the afternoon, five or six mothers were enviously asking me where I rented the car. Second, I have booked a car at 10:50 with the hotel before returning, but there is no contact information of the driver, and if the phone in the lobby cannot be reached, I contact KIMI Yang via WeChat transfer and leave a message to tell him the situation and tell him another mobile phone number. Because the phone I contacted before was out of power, he saw it when he was completely hopeless, called me another mobile phone number, and also told me the parking lot location of the hotel car. If it wasn’t Kimi Yang, he couldn’t. Imagine how to drag a sleeping baby back with an old man. Very good little brother! Only from the customer's point of view can we be so considerate! The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also very good!

They can hear clearly and can't fall asleep at all, and the hotel towels are rolled up without washing. Put it there, very disgusting, the hotel buffet has very few dishes, the food is very limited, the grilled oysters are smelly, it is not recommended.

Kempinski’s sanitation and facilities are not as good as this one. Kempinski is really hard to say. Don’t be sure. This Wyndham is a newcomer, the sanitation is very clean, the bed is very comfortable, I especially praise the front desk staff Du Feifei, the people are very nice, I think the customers think, very friendly ~ also very close to Disney, it is very convenient to take a taxi, There is also a shopping mall nearby, Lawson has everything. Can be upgraded to deluxe double room, deluxe double room room type, area is much better, there is a small balcony.

There are not many and many people who want to have a porridge. It’s called rice, fruit, and no dishes, and I’m yelling in the lobby. I didn’t rant for a long time and didn’t take the initiative to serve food. I’m sorry to charge you so much. The room facilities can be a small five-star room.

msg:It's pretty nice to book this hotel when you go to Disney! It is the best hotel within 10 kilometers of Disney. Apart from the hotels in Disney, this is definitely ranked first. The most important thing is that the price is too affordable and the price is high! Did not say that the breakfast was not good or the shuttle bus was not on time as stated in the comments! Our two mothers and two sons struggled with each other for a long time before we booked this hotel. The result was a very good stay. As soon as we entered the lobby, we felt so new and new. The welcome drink is also the best in many hotels, absolutely fresh No juice is added.
Let’s talk about breakfast. The breakfast in star hotels has all kinds of Chinese and Western styles, and the quality and taste are also very good. It is certainly not perfect when there are many people. However, most hotels with children are so noisy, and hotel management is well managed. Just go on.
In addition, I would like to thank the hotel driver master: the four of us finished breakfast and ordered out to take the shuttle bus, which happened to be 4 more of us. We were about to take a taxi, and the next reception car, Master Koster, told us to transfer to the car in time. Go to Disney. I made a special car to pick you up, so I would like to thank the hotel management staff in charge of reception! Next time I go to stay at Wyndham Hotel!

對於這種情況，我們和前台溝通，答案是明確得不到財務上的任何補償。但我理解，前台的權限有限，因此希望與酒店經理溝通。但得到的回覆是，酒店經理不可能與顧客直接溝通，並且連聯繫方式都沒有。我想知道酒店經理為何能有這種權利，拒絕與顧客交流？這是何種高高在上的態度？我們本意這是想溝通一個合理的賠償，我們甚至沒有提出大額賠償，而是希望得到哪怕一點合理的財務補償，得到的卻是酒店拒絕溝通的解決方法。我們致電了酒店中國區的客服，客服承諾會盡快給我們的郵箱發送聯繫郵件，我們也長時間沒有收到。可見該酒店對於顧客的訴求是如何得不上心和不負責。我們不差錢，但現在我們對於酒店的服務態度感到非常失望，對於這件事情我們會一直追究下去。

msg:訂的是無窗户的房間 跟大堂不在同一棟（叫外賣的時候小哥會經常送錯 導致拿外賣很麻煩）
衞生很好房間也足夠大
但是槽點很多
1、外賣 沒有機器人 要自己下樓拿
2、空調衹有暖氣 超級無敵熱 熱到小孩根本睡不着 打電話問服務枱怎麼辦 得到的答覆是讓我們關了空調或者打開門
如果關空調 幾乎不能呼吸的程度
打開門 那怎麼睡覺呢
對於一個接近六百的房間來説是十分不值得的 下次不會考慮了

舒適度[咖啡]：我預訂的是豪華大床房，房間挺大，有個榻榻米的陽台空間，如果在酒店房間里長時間的逗留這個可以喝茶品酒，再説酒店的淋浴間霧化玻璃，[捂臉]霧化一半，有點尷尬，整體的來説床舒適透氣性好；
服務[強]：酒店屬於中規中矩，酒店的服務經理King接待的我們，熱情周到講解提醒到位，綜合來説沒有過多的需求就住宿而已，不會有太多的期望和要求，還是能考慮二刷的；
[玫瑰][玫瑰][玫瑰]總的來説第一去迪士尼或浦東機場轉機可以選擇，酒店沒有太多的遊玩周邊也還沒有商業區不在酒店用餐的話衹能外賣了，規規矩矩有基本的服務，有班車的使用，簡單出行足矣，還是可以考慮和推薦的。

房間設設施也都正常的。交通我們都是打車，都比較方便
班車的安排實在不能不吐槽，去程提前約過接機，從頭到尾都沒有聯繫過，最後是自己打車過去。
後來選了送機，想説時間也方便，還強調提醒我們要準時，車不等人。結果當天車輛安排混亂，一時説這台車是去T2，一時又説那台，發車時間都是不準時，而且最後根本兩個航站都會停靠。大家行李衹能塞在走道，師傅也不安排大件行李要放好，開車行李東倒西歪。
不清楚這家酒店的實際經營管理方是直屬還是加盟性質那種，酒店大堂工作人員工作氛圍完全不像其他大酒店那樣穩重，工作人員之間溝通挺呱噪的。
最後建議淋浴間的多通風，玻璃門常關閉，有明顯的濕氣黴味。

從第一晚，酒店內的備品就不齊全，在樓下也沒有提醒需要自取牙具。前台的服務態度也不能講是聊勝於無，也可以説是不如沒有吧。兩個女孩沒有提醒且絕對不會客房充足的情況下，直接開了尾房。到了房間後，吹風機也沒有風，我們再次打電話問了兩遍，才講清楚需要找220v電壓的插孔。
最離譜的是，預約接送班車衹給約了早晨班，沒有約晚班。大半夜十點和我們講沒有預約不能上車…聯繫酒店方後給到的回覆也是直接撇清責任…
衹能講，如果考慮選這家，那可以再考慮一下…

msg:去迪士尼玩，在這裏住2晚還是比較合適的，玩累了一整天，要住隔音好點，床品也要舒適的酒店，才能休息好恢復元氣。酒店算是比較新，各方面設施都不錯，也滿足我們的基本需求。就是訂晚了衹有無窗房間，但不影響休息，房間空間也大，洗浴設施都很好。
點名表揚人美聲甜的前台文靜小姐姐，根據我們的需求安排房間，預訂班車接送，非常貼心周到～
迪士尼樂園及浦東機場班車接送服務:接送服務很好，離迪士尼也不遠，來回方便快速;附近一公里就有購物中心可以逛街吃飯看電影，安排個2～3天的行程是很合適的。

年紀大了沒什麼拍照習慣，酒店房間還是很不錯的

如果不是要去迪士尼，不會住在這家酒店。酒店離迪士尼不遠，酒店也有來回迪士尼的班車，但是千萬不要購買車上所謂導遊推薦的一百多塊的嚮導服務，基本沒用。去迪士尼的朋友下載好迪士尼app就行了，導遊完全沒用。如果想要購買快速通道，一定要通過官方渠道。
酒店打掃衞生不認真，住了三晚，棉簽衹有第一天的時候有。有一天晚上十一點跟客房服務要垃圾袋和紙巾，客房服務無人接聽電話。打給前台，前台説送過來，最後沒有結果。
酒店的自助早餐一般般，肯定不值得130塊錢。

帶娃長者去迪士尼的話個人強烈推薦這家酒店，首先，温德姆酒店地理位非常好，距離機場15分鐘，距離迪士尼樂園也是15分鐘的車程，還有酒店貼心的免費接送服務（出行無憂），然後酒店距離地鐵口1.1公里，去陸家嘴也是非常近的，所以從服務和地理位置來看，個人覺得這家酒店非常棒。

msg:入住浦東温德姆酒店兩間兩晚，訂的主題套房加商務套房，帶着小朋友去迪士尼遊玩的，因為兩種房型不在一起，酒店經理King幫我們調整了其中一間升級到一塊，入住後出現了一點小插曲（電話，保險箱不好用的問題）工程師也很快處理好了，還是很給力的！從開發票，打包早餐到預訂班車來回酒店和迪士尼，King都幫着處理好，非常到位，以後有機會再二刷一遍，推薦～

msg:人員服務比較差。首先是停車，一個戴眼鏡的小夥應該是引導酒店客人停車的，莫名其妙上來就問：“誰讓你停到B2來的？”，我都難以想象這是一個服務性質的酒店的工作人員從嘴裏説出的第一句話，交流過程中嘴裏還在一直髮出“qie”的語氣詞，十分不禮貌，而且停車場從入口從沒有看到一句類似告知入住酒店客人需要將車停在B1，不可停在B2的告示。其次，酒店沒有外賣機器人，而且前台很直接地表示不幫忙送外賣，需要客人自己下樓取，十分不方便，且以這個價位的酒店而言，前台直接拒絕幫送外賣的態度與語氣也令人十分不悦。第三，入住的是17樓的房間，晚上18:00-21:00之間有咚咚咚咚的節湊感聲音，下樓到前台詢問周邊是否有ktv，當時前台的一位男士工作人員説附近沒有ktv，並表示會安排人來房間看一下，看看是什麼原因，且當場拿起手機給工作人員打電話，但是事後並沒有工作人員前來我們入住房間查看，可見裝模作樣服務可能已經成了習慣。因為本人去過迪士尼已經三四次了，總體感覺，迪士尼周邊的酒店和民俗都被去消費的顧客給寵壞了，完全忘了服務才是他們立足的根本。望以上評論對其他計劃前遊玩的客人有所幫助。

2 ，要求酒店送一份水果到房間，從晚上10點一直等到12點都沒有來 。要求換新的拖鞋 也沒有換
3，酒店沒有任何夜床服務，詢問原因，酒店客房外包，這個酒店是特許經營的，完全沒有任何服務。入住的朋友們一定要小心
4，口渴了，想喝一瓶依雲，看了下 沒有任何中文標識，印刷特別粗糙，應該是假貨，因為依雲為了長途運輸，有專門的出口瓶子，這一看就是假貨，一個五星級酒店，放在外面的水居然是假的，大家請自行甄別
5，值班經理在退房的時候承諾，下回免費升級房間，呵呵 就像之前承諾的minibar免費一樣，最後還是強制收款，就是把你騙退房了就算了
這個酒店不住也罷
6，酒店的中央空調是沒有開的哦。這個也要care下

msg:海浦東温德姆酒店是最爛的酒店，訂酒店之前我提前打個電話確認接機，之後我才定温德姆酒店，告訴我，衹要提前一天預約就可以，結果説過了9:20就不接了，承諾全是廢紙，騙子一個，第一天下飛機，11點多到的酒店，結果安排一個二樓非常偏僻的一個二樓特別臟亂差，又吵，一宿都沒睡着覺，造音大的厲害，早晨也沒讓坐上去迪士尼的班車。早餐沒吃上，然後可以打包帶走，結果説必須得提前預約才能帶走，結果白花了早餐好幾百塊錢，也沒吃上早餐，温德姆酒店，你坑了客人的幾百塊錢，難道你就富了嗎？早餐沒吃上，也不會給退錢，我訂酒店提前半個多月，已經在備註上寫了15層，結果到那是二層，非常吵，非常吵的二層，一宿都沒睡覺，告誡以後的遊客一定要慎重考慮，訂這家一點不講信用的酒店，因為五一了，遊客非常多，所以你們就這樣的無禮，我的親身體驗，告誡所有的客人，一定要慎重訂這家酒店，衹能坑這一次，我也告誡以後的遊客不要訂你家的酒店，
設施：臟亂差
服務：傲慢無禮，不講理，無信用可言，
環境：環境又吵又鬧，都沒睡着覺我

1⃣️酒店沒有床圍，對帶小童家庭不友好
2⃣️酒店自助早餐真的真的真的沒東西吃（必須説三遍）
3⃣️酒店迪士尼樂園班車接送時間（am7:30，8:30～pm9:00，10:00）衹有兩班，過時不候連電話也不會來問一下，煙花秀晚上9:15結束大批人和童車行動非常緩慢根本趕不上10的車（如果健步如飛而且沒帶小孩的當我沒説）等我們趕到酒店班車也沒了打電話也沒人接，然後衹能自己在黑夜裡打車，而且別的酒店的車都還在等客人。
大家自行斟酌

去的時候才知道有兩棟用來住宿，我們的樓和前台不在一起。當時前台告知等辦完入住帶我們去，結果等了20分鐘也騰不出一個人來引領。後來我們提出自行過去。
入住以後更離譜，牙刷拖鞋都沒有，前台電話打不通，無奈又上下十層樓去另一棟樓的前台領取。
奔着迪士尼去的，周圍基本沒有基礎設施，最近的便利店走路大概在半小時左右

1.服務差：預訂兩天並付款，可房卡衹刷一天，並且前台不接聽電話。晚上10點從迪士尼回賓館後，本來很累了，結果還得下樓到前台續卡，更可氣的是，兩次續卡後又出錯，上上下下的折騰了40分鐘才進房間。
2.設施差：浴室是半透明的，一塊簾子也沒有，洗浴極不方便。
3.位置差：周邊吃飯很不方便，需步行1公里以上才有。

msg:不知不覺，住了兩個多禮拜，今天退房的時候，還有些不捨！特別特別特別感謝JOHN，這兩個禮拜真心麻煩他了。對於我的請求，他總是能想辦法幫我搞定！也要感謝前台LISA，幫我協調房間，尤其在房間特別緊缺的時候！還要感謝客房部的王福艷大姐！她打掃得房間真的超級乾淨！而且很替客户着想！也想對以後的住户説：如果你要去迪斯尼，那選擇入住温德姆你一定不會後悔。當然，再好的酒店也會有需要改進的地方，比如：客房服務的電話永遠沒有接通過！前台的電話也會偶爾沒人接。我覺得這些都是一個五星級不應該有的事情！希望酒店在這些方面可以改進，希望温德姆也越來越好！希望以後的住户，不要隨隨便便給酒店差評！因為大家都不容易！青山不改，綠水長流，後會有期！

msg:非常糟糕的一次入住體驗。春節和家人朋友一起去迪士尼樂園，選擇了這家酒店。因為買了樂園的早享票很早要去排隊入園，所以事先提前問了前台是否能在6點去打包一點早點（我們的房費是含早的）。可是到第二天早上去餐廳打包的時候。大堂經理態度非常惡劣，對我們極其不尊重！一點尊敬和一個笑臉都沒有，還大聲呵斥餐廳的服務員不允許我們自己自助打包。現場十分無禮和尷尬！甚至連小衹的酸奶都不給我們！

另外，酒店房間隔音很差，走廊的説話聲音聽的非常清楚，可能去迪士尼的遊客很多，早上很早的，晚上很晚的都有，特別影響休息。

還有，酒店前台電話經常沒人接或很久才接聽。打電話詢問接駁車，打了很多次才接聽。晚上甚至根本不接！説好的晚上10點鐘最後一班車，最終也沒來。不知道什麼原因？


希望酒店方能看到評價給出合理的解釋！

msg:第一次入住這家酒店，先説説整體的感受：
地理位置：對於本次出差來説，位置極佳，距離出差的公司很近，挨着機場，抵達的時候幾站地鐵+滴滴很快就到了，就是浦東機場T2換2號線有點遠。但是酒店有免費的接機可以預訂（這種方式是最方便的，不過這次我預訂的是送機，司機師傅服務態度非常好，主動提行李，開車也很穩。預訂衹要提前聯繫前台即可，很方便！！！）地圖上看距離迪士尼也很近，而且酒店也有車可以接送，很人性化，下次去迪士尼會體驗一下。
酒店環境+服務：酒店新開不久，整體的硬件都很新；員工的服務意識也在線，因為疫情防控的原因，門口的保安大哥會要求掃描地點碼，也會主動幫忙拿行李，前台的同事辦理入住結賬效率也很高，整體服務達到期望，着重需要提及的是前台還配了一個水果的盒子，每天都會準備不同的水果供客人取用，很人性化，選擇也多。看得出花了心思準備的，前台還有免費的迎賓飲料，超出期望。
房間：因為定的比較臨時，衹訂到了入門級的無窗房（詢問工作人員，酒店週末生意超級好，如果需要預訂還得提前），房間衞生非常好，浴室超級大，淋浴間也非常非常的寬敞，水温穩定，空調温度也可調，免費水，迷你吧也都有配備。並沒有因為無窗而影響入住體驗。由於房間在配樓，辦理完入住手續，前台的小姐姐還親自送到配樓的大門口（雖然衹有幾步路，其實指明即可，但還是會主動指引。這個服務得手動點贊）
這是今年下半年疫情後的第一次出差，整體的入住體驗非常棒，下次到上海還會選擇這裏！

最後退房的時候和值班經理溝通 結果得到反饋説 是每個人體感不一樣 現在已經是秋天了 和外面温度差不多空調就會停運 接待了兩百多位客人沒有人反映空調問題～ 我想請這位經理看看下面有條差評是夏天40度空調打到28度就下不來了 這也是體感問題咯？承認酒店設施有問題是件很難的事情嘛？跟我窮繞八繞就意思我們體感温度不一樣是我們的問題 相比之下前台小姐姐態度讓人舒服太多了
以及看到好多條評論説按金退的慢不知真假 説24h內退款 反正一直到晚上都沒退 按道理五星是退房即退按金的吧～ 
除了距離迪士尼近 比較新 別的都配不上五星水平

msg:酒店入住時，門口發現一攤別人喝多了吐第一：在門口的嘔吐物，雖然客服幫忙換了房間，但是體驗感特別差，第二是早餐特別差，我們9點半去吃的早餐，幾乎沒有東西可以選，而且能選的餐枱旁邊，都有一些別的客人拿過東西以後留下的痕跡，比如麪包屑，醬油等，體驗感差，這種環境，兩個人還收了238的早餐費。第三：訂房時收了500按金，現在還沒有退回？

msg:客房對面清早施工，十分吵鬧，提出申訴前台大堂男經理一張撲克臉，態度惡劣印象極差，極盡推諉之能事，不是有個迪斯尼這種地方應該不會有人來第二次，周邊環境較差，餐飲不行，電梯空調寒冷，住宿人員複雜，管理較為混亂。唯有客房服務人員較友好。
