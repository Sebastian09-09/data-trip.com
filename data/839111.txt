- The hotel boasts a legendary history, and I'm delighted that it is now open to the public, allowing us to experience the distinguished hospitality once reserved for government guests of the city.
- Service exceptional beyond exceptional. 
- Bedroom, living room, and walk-in closet are well decorated and comfortable. The beautiful marble bathroom.
- Fitness is well equipped and pool is temperature control. 

So so :
- Bed is tough and blanket is thin. Not so comfortable.

msg:During my extensive global travels, I’ve had the privilege of experiencing numerous luxury hotels, and I must say, the Sofitel Legend Hotel in Xi’an stands out as a truly remarkable gem. Its enchanting façade, reminiscent of a meticulously crafted petit château, transports guests to a world of mystique and elegance. The ambiance created by the hotel is nothing short of a sensory delight, gracing each moment with a unique touch of beauty and indulgence.

The meticulously designed garden, a picturesque masterpiece, feels like stepping into a fragrant dream. Meandering through lush green lawns, I found solace in the tranquility of nature, as if time itself stood still for my enjoyment. This distinctive environment allowed me to rediscover a sense of inner serenity during my brief stay.

The culinary experiences at the hotel are undoubtedly a highlight, with a sumptuous and diverse breakfast selection as well as exquisite afternoon tea offerings. Whether indulging in French classics or savoring local delights, each dish is a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate. While the service, on occasion, may not have been flawless, I commend the hotel’s proactive approach in swiftly addressing feedback, demonstrating a genuine commitment to continuous improvement and guest satisfaction.

The presence of a well-stocked Mini Bar in the room further elevated my stay, providing a range of snacks and beverages that added convenience and comfort to my leisure moments.

I must take this opportunity to commend the three dedicated butlers, Eric, Mandy, and Flora. Their professionalism and warm hospitality redefine the concept of “home away from home.” Always greeted with a smile, they patiently attended to my inquiries, even offering invaluable travel insights that enriched my exploration of the city.

In summary, the Sofitel Legend Hotel in Xi’an has left an indelible mark on my memory, crafting an unforgettable experience. As a seasoned connoisseur of luxury accommodations, I confidently place this hotel among the finest I’ve encountered. Its charming French-inspired façade, harmonious garden landscape, and unforgettable culinary journey have etched a profound impression in my heart. This is a journey I will cherish for years to come.

msg:The two stars on service, one for concierge one for the hotel bar’s waitress (Rose 游娜，a trainee but who offered us excellent service , made up for other issue we felt being unfairly treated). 

The itself, being a historical building and all, looks magnificent. Even though the decor may seem dated, but inside our room was comfortable, and cosy, we got nothing to complain. 

Concierge would accept our deliveries and helped with luggage and all, again, nothing to complain. 

BUT, on the second day, the hotel housekeeping mistakenly took a huge bagful of our travel stuff ( including snacks, mini packed laundry detergents, biscuits, fruits, alcohol wipes , packed tissues etc), they simply throw away as garbage. We deliberately left it in a corner so it WONT be mistaken as rubbish. We did NOT leave it next to the bin, and we HAVE already taken out our takeaway boxes. 

Because we did not at all expect this to happen at a five star hotel , we did not realise it was missing until the next morning when we were getting ready to leave for train station. At this point, when we called, the hotel told us, housekeeping merely thrown out two EMPTY takeaway boxes, that was NOT true!  They could confirm it from surveillance camera that it’s s about heavy yellow bag been taken out instead of two empty takeaway boxes. 

Yes, perhaps it’s not valuable, it’s not a gold chain or a camera, but it’s something very handy to our long journey , and their initial response was not acceptable. We are also not sure what other small things we have left inside the bag ( Because we didn’t think someone will throw it out!!!!). 
It was obvious it’s not a bag of garbage, if they were not sure why not keep it until we are back and ask?  In all the years staying in any international five star hotel chains, we’ve never had to deal with such situation … 

And one more thing, made us uncomfortable, was before we depart we decided to have a drink in the hotel bar. I asked the bar staff for two Proseccos, she replied if it’s the bubbly free drink being offer upon check in. I spent about 60rmb for two sips, and only to find out it was offer for free which we never been offered upon our arrival ( was nobody else just us two on the arrival night). 
However. After hearing my complain, the bar staff Rose was very thoughtful gave me a second pour, I still paid, but at least feeling not as mistreated. Perhaps this just the final straw on the pile. 
 
On check out, the front desk staffs were busy, no one asked how was our stay , so I did not tell them our experience as above, I had only this one chanel to let out. 

Legend, not so legend. 

传奇酒店让我期待已久，毕竟全球六家，而且在西安的历史建筑内，所以完全没有考虑其他酒店，哪怕我本身几乎不住索菲特，也没有用过accor的loyalty program。
酒店所在建筑的确很棒，我很喜欢，里面的设施也都达到需求。礼宾部前台都很有礼貌，让人觉得很帮助。但是我遇到了两件事，让我觉得以后恐怕不会回来。

1，我们有一个旅途中用的袋子（黄色美团超市袋，里面是一个大的绿色纸袋，因为美团袋子不怕脏放在火车站火车上地上都不担心弄脏，到家了直接拿下来丢掉即可）。里面放了各种小零食，全部可以肉眼看到没有拆开，还有路上用的小包纸巾，ole买的小包酒精湿纸巾，还有小号垃圾袋，以及旅行装洗洁精等。我们把它放在书桌边上的一个墙角，特地放得离垃圾桶区域远一些（房间也没有很多空间放东西我们也不能当路中间）。在我们用完了外卖以及快递后，按照酒店茶几上放的小牌子的要求，打电话请客房部也来收走了。我们理解古建筑立面万一染上污渍会比较难清理。
结果我们离开了一个白天，回来也没特意检查，毕竟这是我们住的地方，我也不想一天到晚防贼一样，也没有对自己的物品拍照。到了第二天我们准备收拾东西离开酒店了，发现这个袋子不见了，这是一个至少有8-10斤左右的袋子，不会轻易错过，于是我们致电酒店管家，在插叙后，告知的确丢掉，但就是一包里面两个空外卖盒… 这是让我最生气和不愿意接受的部分，不小心处理了，不能理解也得理解，但是总不能说瞎话，cctv调出来，我来看看这位清理人员拎出来的是什么东西？？？ 随便看一眼就看到里面的东西都是没有吃过没有用过，就算不确定我也能理解，为什么不放半天等客人回来了确认一下？这里面没有任何异味和汁水，存放一下并不会妨碍你们的酒店。或许对酒店来说，都是些不值钱的东西，没了就没了，有什么好抱怨的，但是将心比心，东西的价值很多时候不在意实际价钱的高低。我们在外面旅行，这些东西是我们的需求，不是钱能买的。

第二个点，我们在离店前，去酒店的酒吧喝一杯，我问吧台服务员点起泡酒（之前我在房间点过，意大利起泡酒），她问我是不是入住时候免费送的起泡酒，我当时就愣了，入住的时候，没有任何人offer我们任何到店饮品。而且到店时就我们俩没有别的客人（所以不是因为太忙）。我拿着一小杯我要付钱别人免费的起泡酒加上被丢了东西，心里不是滋味，不患寡而患不均。是，说我小气，60多一杯的酒在这儿逼逼…  我朋友点了个咖啡，我看到旁边来了另外两个客人，其中一位和一个服务员说，我上次来你们也送的哦，别忘了哦，服务员轻声说知道知道。之间随她的咖啡一起来的，是一份曲奇饼干… 看这个我们桌上孤零零的饮品，心里又是一根稻草压上去。
可能吧台一位员工看到了这个问题，她还是个实习生，也知道了我关于免费不免费起泡酒的不满，于是主动给我续了一杯酒，还拿了饼干（虽然我们也没有吃）、但是心里好受了很多。人真是奇怪的动物（我自己），确实这些都是小东西小细节不值钱可能，但是感觉不公平那就像损失了一个亿，同样是客人为什么没有标准化的服务流程，需要客人去“哭奶喝”，… 逼着大家小气。我不知道这个酒店开了多少时间，但是与传奇这个品牌相比，远远还做的不够。希望传奇品牌有的不紧是历史人物们踏足过的辉煌， 更能够创造属于自己新的传奇。

msg:The Legend Hotel, adjacent to the Xi'an Municipal Government, has a superior geographical location. The manor-style historical building is well-maintained both inside and outside, with a high green coverage rate. Several large ginkgo trees show its value. If you stay here in autumn, it will be a different scene. There is a small museum on the first floor of the hotel, which records the glorious history of the hotel and the heavyweight foreign guests it has received. Although I stayed here for only two nights during the May Day holiday, I could feel the courtesy and enthusiasm of the hotel waiters from the moment I got off the car at the hotel entrance. They carried my luggage, opened the door and showed me the way, greeted me when I met them, and responded to my requests. Special praise to the two Butlers Gu Yan and Yang Fan who received me and my husband. They upgraded my room type when the occupancy rate was very high during the holiday, and arranged a high-floor side suite. The room was clean and reasonably laid out, with a bathroom at each end, which met all my expectations for hotel accommodation. During the stay, Legend provided guests with a semi-buffet breakfast service on a la carte basis. Both Chinese and Western specialties were well prepared, and the appetite was well controlled, demonstrating the quality that a long-established five-star hotel should have. In the evening from 17:30 to 19:30, the lounge on the 7th floor also provides free happy hour for guests. There are not many dishes, but the quality is not ambiguous at all, and the types are changed every day. On the second day of check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Gu called me to confirm the specific time of cleaning the room. The housekeeper Xiao Yang was able to delay the check-out by one hour on the day of our departure as requested. Every little bit is full of sincerity. My husband and I plan to come to Xi'an to see the ginkgo again in autumn, and we will definitely choose the Legend Hotel next time👍

The only drawback is that the underground garage is tight, and there is no elevator directly to the hotel. After calling the front desk, someone drove a battery car to pick me up. The service is especially good, everyone smiles and greets proactively. It is worthy of being a legendary hotel!

The building is tall, elegant and romantic. The garden has towering ancient trees. It is quiet and pleasant in the downtown area. The hotel has received countless heads of state from various countries. It has a profound historical heritage and professional and thoughtful service. Before arriving, the housekeeper Xiao Ge called to ask about preferences and requirements, and tried his best to meet the reasonable needs of the guests, which was heartwarming. Check-in was quick and convenient, and the welcome drinks included champagne and soft drinks. The room was also upgraded for free and happy hour was given. Mr. Chang Pengfei, the head of the concierge depar**ent, was even more polite, enthusiastic and thoughtful. He patiently answered my questions and took the initiative to make many useful suggestions, which gave people a deeper understanding of the local folk customs of Xi'an. Staying in Sofitel Legend has added another beautiful scenery to my trip to Xi'an, which is unforgettable.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels, and I like to check in at hotels. The only one that impressed me was Sofitel Legend.
First, after checking in, the front desk lady will take us upstairs to introduce the room, and every detail will be summarized.
Second, the small bar drinks in the room can be free once. And there are two free laundry services. The cleaning staff will also put different biscuits or cakes at the head of the bed every day, which is also very good!
Third, any doorman service is very good. Yesterday afternoon, when I checked out and took the box down the elevator, the doorman brother ran directly from the door to help me with the luggage! It was running! Not walking fast!
Fourth, every service staff is very polite, and the service attitude is the best and most considerate of all the hotels I have stayed in. I was listening to the guests very seriously. My boyfriend and I casually said that we should go to skp. After hearing this, the doorman brother patiently told us what places to visit and play around skp. The breakfast is also delicious, half buffet and half order, and the roujiamo is better than what you eat outside.
Fifth, the service is not for any individual, but for every group. What I have seen and heard, whether it is foreign friends, young people or the elderly. The service attitude is always uniform and patient!
Sixth, the gym is open 24 hours a day, and the swimming pool is also very clean. The hotel museum has the history of this hotel, which is also very good. There is a sense of inheritance.
It's a pity that the school didn't have a holiday, so I couldn't stay here for too long. After a long time abroad, even if I don't go home, as long as I return to China, I feel at home, but this feeling is given to me by Xi'an, and it is given to me by the Legend Sofitel Xi'an. I am really moved. I feel that every service staff here takes their work very seriously.
Finally, before getting on the bus, I said thank you, and the doorman told me that it's okay, and I will remember to come often if I have the chance in the future.
I think of all kinds of things! I am really moved. I am very happy.
Xi'an is very good, and I hope that the Sofitel Xi'an City Wall will get better and better!

We would like to praise the three staff members, Sun Baoyi, Zhang Yingdan and Miao Yuan, for providing us with impeccable service throughout the whole process.

In the People's Building, the antique a**osphere brought by the sense of the times is everywhere. The room type has been upgraded, the night bed service is great, and the room has two toilets.

This is a rare hotel where you can watch TV while going to the toilet, brushing your teeth, taking a bath, and taking a bath. It is unique!

The room is large and the bathroom is spacious. The bathtub is very suitable for small girls, but the big one cannot fit in it. It comes with bath salts. But there is no floor mat in the shower room, and the scale and hair dryer don't work well. There is no Hermès now, big bottle, environmentally friendly

The bed is placed at the door and the sound insulation is very poor. Breakfast is a la carte, but I personally prefer a full buffet.

The courtyard is also beautiful after snow. The waiters are very enthusiastic and will greet you wherever they meet. The concierge Sun Baoyi will ask me if I need an umbrella when it snows, remind me to call a car in advance on snowy days, and help me carry my luggage to the car. The only thing that made me feel a little bad during my stay was that the waiter opened the door and came in to refill the mini bar without confirming whether there was anyone in the room. If the guest happened to be taking a shower or changing clothes, it would be an accident if he came in directly. Fortunately, I was resting in bed and didn't change clothes at the time, but I was still startled by someone who suddenly opened the door and came in. I hope it can be improved.

If there is a shortcoming, it is that the room is not big. I booked a Premier Room and upgraded it to a Deluxe Premier Room.

The doorman has always been very polite and discerning. The room was kept very clean. The most important thing is the bed, which is very comfortable to sleep on. I am a bed and pillow person, but after staying here for the past few days, I slept very well every night. I wanted to ask where I bought this mattress.

Let’s talk about the shortcomings: the breakfast is very, very unreliable, and none of the a la carte items are delicious. I really think that otherwise we should cancel the a la carte order, as it would be a waste of manpower to keep it. What's even more outrageous is that on the last day we went to have breakfast, we waited for a long time at the door and there was no waiter. We found a place to sit down by ourselves, and the waiter came in a hurry after we had picked up the dishes. There weren't many people at breakfast. I couldn't see 15 tables in total, and the waiters were so busy. Also, if the plates are smaller, the table will be full with two plates; the heating is not enough, and the dishes will be cold within five minutes. All in all, the breakfast experience was not very good.

As a native of Xi'an, I chose the Sofitel Legend Hotel to stay with my mother on my birthday, because my mother and I both lived in the alley next to the People's Building when we were young, and we have a lot of memories of the neighborhood and the hotel yard. Check-in was very smooth. From the entrance to the foyer, lobby, and reception desk, there were staff guidance and guidance. This is really great. It shows that the staff ratio is sufficient and the service is in place during the off-season.

When I checked in, I learned that it was my birthday, and a customized cake was specially made for me as a blessing. Then a staff member led me to the guest room and introduced the facilities and services in the room one by one, which was very considerate.

The advantage of a traditional hotel is that it has very good lighting, an independent dressing area, and an independent dry and wet bathing area. It is very comfortable and convenient on the circulation line. It has a large space and double toilets. The space layout in the guest room is very good, and it is worthy of it. It is a well-established hotel. There is a turndown service in the evening. The rooms are very clean and it makes your stay very peaceful.

The executive lounge on the 7th floor includes fruits, refreshments, snacks and special cocktails, with rich varieties, elegant environment and enthusiastic staff.

Because we are staying in the off-season, we can eat breakfast as we go without queuing. In addition to the buffet area, breakfast also has a la carte items.

On one side of the lobby on the first floor is the Roman Holiday breakfast area, and on the other side is the front desk seating area and small museum. Be sure to take time to see that history.

There are spacious gardens and fountains in the front and rear buildings of the hotel. It is also great to take a walk and enjoy the scenery. Both the luxurious and elegant hard-furnished facilities inside and outside the hotel, as well as the culture and connotation of the soft furnishings, fully demonstrate the taste and taste of the hotel. It is of high quality and has a constant temperature swimming pool. Those who like swimming can try it out.

Special thanks to Yang Minglang, the front desk staff, who provided us with the most considerate, meticulous and enthusiastic service possible during our stay, which added a lot to the service items of Legend Hotel. Thank you.

The hotel rooms are made of exquisite materials and are worthy of being called a Diamond Hotel. They are not comparable to the average Marriott or Hilton. The service is also very good, and the hotel staff always considers the residents. The breakfast buffet does not have too many types, but you can choose to order a la carte and the chef will make it specially for you.

The hotel waives additional breakfast fees for children under 12 years old, which is also very considerate. Overall, I would recommend this hotel and I'm sure it's the best hotel in Xi'an.

After the noodles are cooked, bring them to the table! When the children saw it, they said "Wow", what a service! Then he said, "There's a lot of beef." Ha ha ha ha

msg:After staying for several days, I checked out today. I didn’t have a good check-in experience. On the day I checked in, there was a water problem in the lobby at night. However, Manager Fang quickly solved it and apologized. It was very good. The speed and attitude in handling the problem were behind the scenes. I extended my stay again. I really like the retro old building and the decoration style. The ginkgo tree corridor at the back is very beautiful this season. You can take a photo of the hotel. But the breakfast is not stable. I asked for the salmon bacon eggs Benedict. Are you coming? Yes, there was another time when the eggs benigues were too old and not tasty. I was leaving the store this morning. I ordered an egg benigne. The bread underneath was too hard and the eggs were old. I ordered a cumin one. The Roujiamo also has more vegetables than meat, and the breakfast is unstable. After the subsequent experience, I went to the lobby bar to experience it and it felt average. I tried it several times and didn't ask you if you wanted to refill the coffee. Maybe I didn't spend money. If the service is not as good as the lobby of Sofitel Xining, Legend should not lose to ordinary Sofitel in terms of service details. The swimming pool is very good and the male coach is very good. In short, Manager Fang is special, the service behind is good, and the concierge is also very good. , the concierge will take the initiative to press the elevator, and the executive lounge butler is also good. Although there are a few hot dishes in the executive lounge, they are too plain, have no characteristics, and are too Western-style. See you next time, legend

msg:Sofitel Legend Hotel definitely deserves five-star praise, because the evaluation of a hotel is not only based on hardware, but mainly on the quality of hotel services.
The location of the hotel is very good👍 suitable for visiting various attractions within the city walls. The hotel's service can be said to be responsive to all questions, proactive and enthusiastic, and is by no means just the casual service of a business hotel.
The hotel's room size is okay and the facilities are complete. It's just that the temperature in Xi'an has cooled down in the past few days. The temperature in the breakfast restaurant is a little lower, but shawls can be provided.
Hope to have the opportunity to stay at this hotel again in a suitable season.

msg:Not all hotels can be called legends!
     During the National Day, I booked three top hotels in Xi'an through the Ctrip platform: Sofitel Legend, Canopy by Hilton, and W hotel. These three hotels have their own characteristics, but Sofitel Legend Xi'an left a deeper and unforgettable impression on me.
     From the architecture to the environment, from the exterior to the interior, Sofitel Legend exudes elegance, dignity, magnificence, art and culture from the inside out.
      Before I checked in on September 29, the hotel took the initiative to call and communicate. and accommodated my additional requests as much as possible. So I would first like to thank the beautiful women and handsome guys at the front desk that day. Your patience and enthusiasm made me feel at home.
      The museum explanation at 4pm is the highlight and distinctive feature of the hotel! I would like to express my special thanks to Mr. Chang Pengfei, Head of Concierge Depar**ent. Not only for your active assistance and patient service, but also for your elegant and professional explanations and gentle demeanor, which made our whole family feel like spring breeze and immersed in the cultural and historical a**osphere you described.
     The free happy hour in the evening and the enthusiasm of the receptionist, the exquisite and clean swimming pool, gym and polite service staff, proactively asking if there is a self-service + order breakfast service for packing... There are too many details to make I truly felt the coziness and comfort of home.
     Therefore, whether it is a high-end business reception or a family vacation, Sofitel Legend Xi'an will be my only choice in Xi'an in the future, because it truly explains to guests what the art of living is.

msg:This time I came to Xi'an and stayed in three five-star hotels. I think Sofitel Legend Xi'an is the best hotel in Xi'an. I stayed for two consecutive days, and the little girl at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade my room for free. She also gave me free fruit for both days. The service staff was gentle and enthusiastic, and the service was proactive, thoughtful and professional. The takeaway service staff delivered the order to the room immediately, which was very considerate. I found that I didn't use the hotel's pillow at night, so the next day I took the initiative to send a buckwheat pillow and told me that if I still felt uncomfortable, I could ask for another pillow, and the hotel could adjust it for the guest. The service is really warm and attentive. Of course, the hotel's environmental facilities are also very nice. In short, I will choose to stay at Sofitel Legend Hotel next time I come to Xi'an.

msg:This is a family trip suitable for mothers to travel together. After six days in Beijing, I was very tired. Coupled with the dryness and cooling in the north, both of us had sore throats and colds😷, so we decided to find a comfortable hotel🏨There are many sightseeing distances It's far away and not suitable for traveling. In addition, everyone recommended it to be near the clock tower. After entering the city, I wandered around but was not satisfied. I decided to spend one night at Legend with the mentality of trying.
Hygiene: clean, no smell, even no fluff on down products. There is often fluff on the carpets in some stores.
Environment: AccorHotels, I went to the wrong place. The guy from another hotel told me that there are four stores here (o(╯□╰)o), restaurants, theaters, and a Swan Lake performance on the 17th. What a pity 17 We left at noon to see Huangguoshu Waterfall (crying, the scenic spots are no longer fragrant. I originally saw Giselle in Beijing, but my mother liked Tchaikovsky more, so I was doubly regretful). The independent small courtyard has pavilions, fountains, and beautiful ginkgo trees. It is as quiet as advertised. It is 1.6 kilometers away from Muslim Street and 1.4 kilometers away from Yongxingfang. The interior decoration is elegant and solemn, which suits my taste (it’s not so damp that it makes me get rheumatism🤔)
Service: It must be praised. I am surprised that there are so many negative reviews on the Internet. I went to the wrong place. My brother called the hotel to pick me up. I thought I would wait for a long time, but suddenly he took the initiative to take my luggage in the car. The car drove to the hotel 🏨 (although it was not far, I felt warm in the cold), opened the door proactively (I am happy because it is difficult to open the door in winter ☺), proactively said hello, sat down to check in, and gave me a drink. It was very fast, no queues, and there was a hotel butler. He took me to the room and explained it to me, which is perfect for people like me who can't find their way around. At night, they took the initiative to help me make the bed, draw the curtains, gave me snacks, and put bath towels on the floor. I finally didn’t have to call and ask for it (I often ask for the curtains because I am not diligent o(╯□╰)o). The weather was dry, so I asked I added a humidifier, and it turned out that the humidifier checked in before me (which added to my satisfaction), and the check-out process was quick and easy. It freed my hands and I didn’t need to touch the suitcase during the whole process (it smelled good regardless of the luggage).
Facilities: The toilet temperature is suitable, the shower head is large, the lights are bright and not dazzling, the big bed is not too small for fat people, the pillows and quilts have no smell and no hair comes out (hate lint), the space is enough for fat people to walk (hate narrow spaces), and the facilities are not felt It’s old. I think it’s complete and sufficient. Again, I don’t understand why I feel bad🧐
If it weren't for the schedule, I would continue to stay (also because the guy next door is so enthusiastic and plans to go next door to experience it for two days😅). The disadvantage is that I forgot that a member of a certain pig forgot to collect wool (he was so angry that he fainted, even more I'm angry because I'm poor this year, and a certain treasure gave me a downgrade as a gift member, so I impulsively booked a chain hotel and suffered a lot). Plan to stay on the 15th

msg:I came here for the historical features and legendary hotels, thinking that when I come to Xi'an, I want to stay in the most unique hotel. It is said that the hotel has hosted many dignitaries and celebrities.
It’s quite interesting to have your own museum.

It was formerly the People's Building, which is also a very meaningful building. It is now operated by the French Accor Group. The service meets the standards of a star-rated hotel. It is also the only star-rated hotel I have stayed in that has turndown service, which is quite unique.

The happy hour is good, with a wide variety of wines, and can almost replace dinner.

French architecture, elegant environment, very beautiful.

I coordinated the twin beds with the housekeeper. The layout of the room was average, but it just gave me a sense of history and feelings. Moreover, the overall price in Xi'an made a hotel of this level not so expensive, and the price/performance ratio was acceptable.

100 USD coupon, because after dinner time I can only eat at the Ezhu restaurant across the street 😂 It’s not that delicious to be honest.

The predecessor of the hotel is the People's Building of Xi'an built in 1953. The hotel also has early items from the People's Building. A small museum~ The legendary service experience of Sofitel Xi'an (one of the few in China) can definitely wash away the fatigue of the special forces punching in for a day, thumbs up~👍, especially the hotel bellman Bert and the front desk Tommy are very warm and considerate, we will come next time Stay at Sofitel Legend in Xi'an😄

Travelers who like in-depth travel and comfortable travel should choose this hotel. Both of us are elders.

I have to say that the hotel staff's service is very professional and their temperament is extraordinary. They are indeed worthy of the hotel's reputation. The European-style hotel building is very majestic at first glance. It is very photogenic even if you take any pictures. The rooms are large and each room type is well equipped. Yunshui, the actual internal hardware facilities are far more advanced than the ancient and sophisticated appearance, and the window view is also very comfortable, full of green leaves.
The location is also very convenient, right in the middle of Yongxingfang and Drum Tower, so you don’t have to worry about eating, drinking and having fun.
But the only unpleasant thing was that there happened to be a wedding held in the hotel on the day I stayed. It was so noisy early in the morning that people couldn't sleep.

msg:I will stay at this hotel when I come to Xi'an from now on! The environment is good and the service is good. Don't go wrong. Sofitel Legend Xi'an is not a Sofitel hotel. Just two words difference, the grade is very different. The service is very good. There is a little girl with big eyes and dimples who smile when she speaks. There is also a young man named Yang Minglang who is also very nice. A particularly good experience😊

msg:The hotel is great, the overall feeling is low-key, luxurious, and tasteful on the one hand; on the other hand, it is very warm and homey, making people very comfortable.
The design and layout of the room is very user-friendly, and the room hardware is well preserved. The internal management is meticulous and thoughtful, and every detail makes me feel that I have put my heart and soul into it. The slight but comfortable creaking sound of stepping on the wooden floor made me feel the historical precipitation and thickness of the hotel.
After staying for two nights, when we parked at the door, the service staff at the door would take the initiative to come down the steps to greet us. A guest commented before that no one came out to pick up luggage or greet me at the door. I also encountered it once during the period, and it happened that the service person was not at the door, which is understandable.
The breakfast is also good, it is a small but refined style, with both Chinese and Western elements, especially the a la carte food tastes great! It can also be delivered to the room, but I didn't try it.
Will stay again, recommended!

msg:Transferring to Xi'an on vacation, Hilton Jiayue and Sofitel Legend hesitated for a long time, and finally chose Sofitel Legend, which can be regarded as the fulfillment of the desire to feel the luxury of the old brand

Environment: Since 1953, operated by Mr. Hong Qing, the location has a strong sense of history. I really don’t need to exaggerate it too much. If you like the old school and the fusion of classics, it’s recommended to go here. It’s a pity that the museum next door is under renovation, so I don’t have a chance to visit

Facilities: Although there is a strong sense of age, there must be jade in the old stone. Although there are obvious traces of use in the room, the maintenance and cleaning work is very good. However, there are also flaws, the gym is not well maintained, the gantry is full of rust, the middle and long poles are missing, and the sweat stains on the bracelet are obvious

Service: Very standardized butler model, standard introduction, standard guidance, standard storage and storage of meals... The surface layer is very good, but the inner layer has obvious shortcomings: the swimming pool service is deserted, the lifeguard is useless, and the bracelet in the locker room It depends on whether there are staff in the swimming pool. If there is no staff, you have to wait

Finally, if it is a business trip or check-in, it is recommended to be the first choice. The immersive experience it brings cannot be experienced in other top luxury. The hotel fully guarantees the privacy of each guest and does it very well. It is old-fashioned and old-fashioned. service, must be satisfied

Like the breakfast, order system. I especially like Eggs Benedict. I recommend everyone who stays here to try it. It's delicious!
Happyhour's meals are slightly insufficient, and some are estimated to be left over from breakfast.

msg:The decoration style of the hotel combines Chinese and Western styles, and the hotel's own museum displays historical treasures in detail. Because there are not many rooms in the hotel, one-to-one English-style butler service is adopted. The night before, we will communicate with the specific needs by phone, understand the age structure of the occupants, and prepare room supplies. On the day of check-in, the butler will accompany you throughout the process. Sit down and drink a cup of freshly ground welcome coffee or champagne, and the butler will introduce relevant content by the sofa after check-in.
We arrived in the evening, and he helped us upgrade both rooms from a prime minister room to a deluxe prime minister room. Here you can enjoy the happy hour in the executive lounge at 5:30 pm every day. There are various snacks including salmon kebabs, fruit snacks and red wine, which can be eaten as dinner. The water in the room is Evian, and there are plenty of fruit drinks and snacks. The TV is embedded in the mirror in the bathroom, and you can watch it in the mirror while taking a bath. Breakfast is a combination of buffet and a la carte. In addition to the buffet, there are two pages of menus to choose from. Basically, they have all the specialties of Xi'an. In the morning, I ate their Eggs Benedict and Beef Soup with a combination of Chinese and Western. It can be said that expensive value for money.
But in the room when I checked in on the first day, there was a problem with the bathroom door, and the door could not be closed. See Figure 7, there is always a gap. The bedside phone didn't work either. It was fixed immediately after I raised it the next day.
A suggestion: Basically, the service staff during the check-in period are very friendly and enthusiastic, but when we arrived and when we left, the luggage was brought in by ourselves. On the day of check-in, it is said that because the guests just arrived at the front, the service staff went to pick up the front luggage. On the day we left, we waited for the car in the lobby for a while before leaving. Maybe the service staff felt that they had already checked out and did not need to serve. As a result, our three suitcases came and went by the old people and children lifting up and down the stairs at the door to the car at the door. This has never happened before in other luxury hotels. This experience does not match the star rating of your hotel. I hope that the service at this price can last from beginning to end.

How can a hotel make the people of Xi'an proud of it? Then go find out. When I arrived at the hotel door, I was wondering why there was no doorman. An employee in a tuxedo trotted forward from the lobby to pick up the luggage. Twice, the gentleman said, "Sir, I can just come." I have stayed in many luxury hotels , This is the first time I have experienced this kind of experience. The proper and considerate service made me feel as if I had walked into my own "palace". After stepping into the lobby, the partners in the concierge politely led us to the front desk, and the front desk staff received us warmly and sincerely , Since then, the legendary hotel tour has officially kicked off, making me forget all the unpleasant things I experienced at W the night before. In addition to meeting the standard of luxury hotel welcome and check-in, turndown service, free mini bar for the first round, happy hour with executive trea**ent, calling the last name when answering the phone, taking the initiative to press the elevator for guests, etc., I also feel that only in Four Seasons Hotel Experienced "sincerity": The breakfast chef will take the initiative to ask you about your taste, mentioning that you can order meals other than the menu and make them for us separately, and recommend which specialties nearby are delicious; the housekeeper will remember your itinerary, I waited in front of the door with my luggage early, and I was more anxious than you to delay the time; because I like the history and architecture of the hotel, the butler also gave me a book about legends, which is incredible. After leaving for a long time, I couldn’t calm down: what kind of hotel culture can make employees have such confidence and sincerity? I think this is also a question that most luxury hotels should think about. Finally, thanks again to Frank, August, Flora, Derek for their excellent service, see you next time~

The a**osphere of the whole hotel is quiet and low-key, unlike many hotels that are crowded and chaotic, there is no loud noise here, and the footsteps are light, which is what I like. Sandwiches and tiramisu yyds for free afternoon tea, black tea ☕️ also 🉑️.
There are many types of breakfast, and the desserts are my favorite. Chef She Niu asked us how our breakfast was, and shared with us the delicious and interesting things in Xi'an.

msg:A great stay experience, it really met expectations. Staying at Sofitel Legend itself is an important part of this trip. I have always wanted to experience this golden key hotel, which is only one of the five in the world. Needless to say, the overall environment, the building is very characteristic of the times, it is an antique in itself, the rooms are very spacious, and every part of the old building is effectively used. There are two bathrooms in one room. At first I wondered if it was redundant, but when both of them had to use it, I suddenly realized that it was really humane. There is a mini bar in the room, as well as welcome fruit (but the Wuren dim sum given at the turndown is really not delicious haha, the gift of MM beans the next day is so cute). I give the restaurant a good review. The breakfast is semi-buffet, and there is nothing wrong with the order. The chef will come to talk to the guests who have not talked about the food, recommend where to go, and teach us how to drink the most authentic Hu spicy soup. It’s really hard work. The small biscuits made by the hotel are also super cute. You must buy two boxes to take away. The service was very good. On the first day we arrived at midnight, the front desk and the concierge were still very active in checking us in and delivering our luggage, and they would listen carefully to the guests. At that time, I just muttered and wanted another quilt. I had to call again to ask for it, but it was delivered to me in a while, and I feel very good. There are other services that help guests to be more convenient. It can be said that everyone is well trained. Legend is a hotel that I will strongly recommend to my friends (already recommended). As for the only shortcoming, has the hotel changed the toiletries? I remember it was Hermes at the beginning? The current shampoo makes my hair astringent after washing, and the toothbrush is not too high-end. The hair dryer may mistakenly think it is Dyson, but it turns out to be something else. It would be better if these can be improved.

msg:This is the first time in my life that I have complained about a hotel. I booked this hotel when traveling to Xi'an. It is also the most expensive hotel in Xi'an on Ctrip. The hardware facilities are okay, which is understandable as it is an old hotel, but the service level surprised me. It rained heavily on the first day I arrived at the hotel. No one came to hold an umbrella at the hotel gate (because this hotel is special, the driveway does not have a rain cover), and no one came to carry the suitcase. I carried the suitcase in by myself in the rain. hotel. After checking into the hotel, I discovered that there were stains on the toilet in the master bedroom. I informed the hotel waiter, and he came in and took a look before calling the housekeeper to clean and disinfect the toilet. I tolerated the first two, but then another service-related loophole occurred that made me unable to bear it any longer, so I wrote this review. Because I arrived in Xi'an on the second stop after traveling from Xinjiang, I didn't have enough clothes. On the first day I arrived at the hotel, I sent my dirty clothes to the laundry service. On the third night, I found that the clothes returned were missing two pieces and called the front desk. However, the front desk’s attitude was not to verify the laundry depar**ent at the first moment. Instead, they asked me to search in the room with a questioning tone, saying that the laundry was all done together. Send it back and it will not be missed. And I found that the laundry was delivered without leaving a laundry list for me. This kind of service cannot match the price. Although they found the clothes later and sent them to me and asked me to understand them, as a famous five-star hotel in Xi'an, it should provide customers with professional and thoughtful services and leave a good stay experience to customers. This hotel did not I am very disappointed with the service and management that match it. From a facility perspective, the wifi is very slow and can only use 5G; from a hygiene perspective, the toilet leaves stains; from a service perspective, I didn't have a good experience either.

msg:The hotel customer service called the hotel one day in advance to ask if there were any additional needs. At the same time, the reservation was required to check in 4 hours in advance. However, when I went to the front desk to check in, the waiting time was very long. I was told that there were no clean rooms, which felt very perfunctory. In addition, during the rest period after check-in, the waiter came to knock on the door and delivered fruit regardless of the matter. He didn't understand why he didn't put it in the room in advance and came in midway to disturb the guest's rest. In addition, even though two people were checking in, the waiter made the bed at night and only provided slippers and snacks for one person. It was obvious that he was not clear about the number of guests and was not paying attention. It's really a waste of more than 2,400 room fees. Very poor experience

msg:After hesitating for a long time between Sofitel Legend and W Hotel, I finally chose Sofitel. Facts have proved that the choice is correct. I am a bit of a clean freak, and I am very concerned about the hygiene of the hotel. The bed sheets are clean and tidy, even the fabric sofa and the carpet are not stained at all, and there is not a trace of dust in the corners. If there is only one point of nitpicking, there is no separate small package for shampoo and bath😌
      In addition to the various foods displayed outside the hotel for breakfast, there are also hot foods cooked to order from all over the world on the menu. The chef told us what you want to eat that is not on the menu. It is also very rich. On the fourth day of the stay, the child suddenly vomited and had diarrhea. Within two minutes of calling the front desk, Meng Jianmei, the room manager, came to clean up the stains. Suddenly, I was a little overwhelmed by the incident. The hotel responded to my needs, especially Qi Fenping, the housekeeping depar**ent, who taught me to make salt water for my children like my own sisters. Liu Guilong, the concierge manager, and Zhang Shiqi, the housekeeper, helped me run errands to buy medicine and take a taxi to the hospital. The child's porridge was delivered to the room the next morning. Fortunately, the child recovered immediately after seeing the illness. When I walked in the hotel, even the staff I had never met came up to greet me, and their attitude was not the kind of mechanical politeness, which really made me feel at home. warmth! Sofitel Legend Hotel is the most satisfactory hotel I have stayed in so far, and the only hotel with a full score. The next time you come to Xi'an, it will be Sofitel Legend Hotel!

The hotel has a small museum. The history of the entire building complex was told by Frank Chang, the head concierge, which made us feel more kind and friendly to the hotel.
When checking out, the concierge also specially presented precious commemorative books and postcards. BIG surprise!!! I was so moved that I cried

There are only five in the world, one each in Hanoi (Vietnam), Aswan (Egypt), Santa Clara (Colombia), Amsterdam (Netherlands), and Xi'an (China). The selection of Xi'an, the ancient capital of China, is said to be a gaze at history and an embrace of time. It was originally the People's Building built in 1953 to receive heads of state. It was built as a hotel in 14 years. It is an old building with a strong history and wonderful stories. It has a French style with a sense of design inside and outside. There is a small garden behind the hotel And the small museum inside the hotel makes it a bright feature too. Whether it is the welcome cocktail afternoon tea at the legendary lobby bar for residents, or more well-designed service details and considerate concierge services, this place that is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle is more warm.

msg:I have stayed in hundreds of five-star hotels around the world, and this is a wonderful hotel with the worst service I have ever stayed in.
I just checked into the hotel and took a taxi to the hotel. There was not a single waiter outside the hotel lobby. Note: There is actually no eaves outside the hotel lobby, and taxis can only park on the ground under the steps outside the lobby. So I had to stand under the sun, and when I couldn't see a "grandpa" from the hotel to help with the luggage, I carried the heavy boxes up the stairs step by step to the hotel lobby.
Secondly, I wanted to take a bath on the first night of my stay, but at twelve o'clock in the evening, I found that the bathtub was broken and could not hold water at all. Called the front desk and said it couldn't be repaired and asked the engineering staff to come. It was barely usable after maintenance engineers came to repair it in the middle of the night.
The strange thing is that when I came back the next night, I found that the water in the bathtub the night before had not been drained when the waiter cleaned the room. I was thinking: Does the waiter think this is for keeping drinks? ?
In addition, the windows in the hotel room felt like they hadn't been cleaned in several years, and the glass was covered with mud and water.
When I left the hotel at noon on the last day, it was raining. I checked out the room with my luggage and told the front desk that I was leaving. The taxi was waiting at the door, and there was no one in the hotel to help me carry my luggage to the car. Once again, I could only carry the heavy box down the stairs and to the car in the rain.

The butler-style service is excellent, and the meticulousness has been achieved to the extreme. Whether it is asking some stories about the hotel or travel tips, the staff can talk freely and come together one by one, full of patience and enthusiasm. Friends who come to Xi'an must not miss the only legendary hotel in China~

Is this a problem of management awareness or management level? Although this comment is irrelevant, people who read it still advise you not to step on the pit!

msg:Sofitel Legend Xi'an has a superior geographical location, rich historical content, and caring personnel, and its reputation is well-deserved.

When I checked in during the epidemic, the front desk staff was full of enthusiasm. I checked the very detailed nucleic acid testing locations and working hours to inform the guests, which was very convenient. Danny, the front office manager, led us to do an in-depth tour of the hotel. We visited the hotel museum, public areas and guest rooms of different grades. We learned about the various bonuses of the number 53. The hotel uses the original floor for cutting and resurfacing. It is very moving to feel his strong pride in such a building that bears witness to history.

But the hotel does have some flaws. The room was remodeled from the original room. The layout is strange and the area is too small. It has been a long time since I have seen a twin room with two 1-meter beds. In the end, the reason why I temporarily changed the check-in time and left the store early was the lack of catering during the epidemic. The original happy hour only had a few sweet and salty snacks, French fries and chicken nuggets. Like breakfast, I need to go to the Sofitel next door to pick them up. , is a complete downgrade. On the morning of the third day of check-in, my own restaurant opened, but the variety of food was limited, but not up to the existing standard. In fact, if you feel that there are too few guests to guarantee the catering package, you don't have to open it at all. Such a downgrade will fool you and you don't know what the hotel considers.

Finally, I would like to thank the staff for their hard work, and recommend it to everyone who pays attention to historical value and can tolerate some settings that do not meet modern hotel settings.

msg:The second time I stayed in the legend, I felt that there were some changes compared to three years ago. From the current housing prices, we can feel the impact of the epidemic on the hotel industry. The original price of the prime minister's room is now cheaper and you can live in a suite, which also shows the sincerity of the legend.

The price is lower, and the experience is actually lower, but it is understandable that it does not affect too much on the whole. The legend is still a legend, and other hotels in many places cannot compare. If you consider the Renmin Building as a non-famous quality scenic spot in Xi'an, Living here is so worth it!

I only experienced the swimming pool this time. It is really not big. The water is still a little cold. The small pool next to it is not warm. The changing room is also very small. There is a shower room, a toilet and a changing room. It is very cold, but the housekeepers may be very comfortable in suits and leather shoes, but it is really cold for guests with short clothes and short sleeves, and it is easy to catch a cold. After all, there are guests who come to travel and need to wear short clothes to walk in the high temperature of Xi'an.

Breakfast is my favorite. It is not noisy, and the standard is not fooled. Especially the special snacks in Xi'an, the taste is really good, which makes up for the regret of being unable to get up early to catch the morning market with children. Probably because there are few guests, the chefs are very leisurely, very willing to chat with the guests, care about how we eat, what special needs we have, and also introduce Xi'an's delicious, fun and legendary specialty dishes😄 It gives a very warm feeling.

In addition to Evian, the mineral water is also equipped with mineral water for the capsule coffee machine. Daily fruit, free first round of drinks in the fridge, happy hour in the afternoon

The key is that the service is good, every staff member is very welcoming, doesn't feel overdone, feels at home. The housekeeper service is very considerate, almost no one can be seen, but they are everywhere. Every time you go out and come back, the room will be cleaned, and fruit, snacks, etc. will be given away, so you won't be disturbed, but everything is in order , very relaxing.

Breakfast should have everything, although it can't be said to be particularly rich, but the quality of things is very good, and there are some à la carte dishes.

The only thing I think is a little bit flawed is that in the disposable toiletries, the quality of the comb is not good enough, and the wooden comb is a bit hanging on the hair, which is not very good

This is the hotel you must choose when you come to Xi'an in the future.

One of the only two supreme suites in the hotel, located in the middle of the building, is really legendary. The room is large, the layout is comfortable, and the breakfast is better than the Westin. The hotel is adjacent to the government compound. The regional environment is white walls, green tiles and ancient trees. . The building is a historical building, so the swimming pool and gym are limited by the site, but they are sufficient. Weaknesses: The water pressure of the bathtub faucet is not enough, which may be an exception, and the bathroom is slightly smelly. Overall, a good enough luxury hotel

Hermès care and Evian water reflect the nobility in every aspect. The important thing is the baby shower. Milk and water are provided for free whenever needed. The water temperature of the swimming pool is 30 degrees, which is especially suitable for babies to play. The hotel offered to provide late check-out for babies taking a nap, which was really considerate. My baby and I love breakfast the most. It is semi-open and independent. The service staff are very warm and friendly, and the food ordered is of high quality. You can rent Hanfu in Datang.

I couldn't go back to Xi'an to celebrate my parents' birthday because my child went to school, but it was my mother's 60th birthday, so I chose a historic and a**ospheric hotel. Unexpectedly, not only that, but my mother said that this is still the place where my grandfather used to have meetings, so my mother felt more cordial.
I called a few days in advance to confirm. I made some requests and the housekeeper helped me realize them one by one. For example, I upgraded my suite, arranged check-in in advance, checked out late, and made exquisite cakes. The Japanese food placement service is also very good. I heard my parents keep asking them if they want additional meals, and the taste is very good. Happy hour is also very rich. There is no buffet for breakfast because of the epidemic, but the order is very rich and the taste is also very good. The chef also specially sent white fungus soup. When I checked out, my parents proposed to issue an invoice, but because I told the housekeeper not to tell the room charge, the housekeeper was particularly responsible for calling me to confirm whether the invoice can be invoiced. In short, it is the requirements of the guests, they are all satisfied as much as possible, and they do very well. I am really grateful to the butlers Cherry Hattie and Fancy for allowing my parents to leave a very good experience.

Quite plentiful, the steamed bun is delicious, and Benedy is not bad too~

Room facilities:
There is no electric toilet, this should not be; the shower water flow in the bathroom is OK; the bed is big, it is very comfortable to fall asleep, the bedding is also very soft and skin-friendly; there are welcome fruits, which are not too high-end; the toiletries are Hermès, but toothbrushes Something is still a bit bad; the cloakroom is large, but the space for the boxes is small.

Cost performance:
The historical period is heavy, and the room facilities could be better. In comparison, there is no W as cost-effective.

There is a suggestion that the TV should be replaced. It is relatively old and can only watch live TV. Without the intelligent system of the new TV, it is not possible to watch on-demand programs. If you take your children there, you cannot watch cartoons at night

The most praiseworthy part of the hotel is the concierge. We made a temporary divergence to Xi'an this time without making arrangements for the itinerary. After booking the hotel, I called the hotel concierge. Wang Kaixiang, who was in charge of us, quickly made an itinerary for us. He also arranged the car and the tour guide to go out the next day. Tickets for major attractions were also arranged. Proper 👍👍.

Manager Liu of the concierge depar**ent is also very responsible, the reception is very good, you must like it!

The decoration style of this hotel has grown in my aesthetics!
Very a**ospheric, light and luxurious light white style!
The service is very good, it is very suitable for bringing children to parent-child experience!
The room is not small and the air conditioner is slightly cold.
Although there are not many varieties for breakfast, you can order local specialties, which can be satisfied!
The hotel is located in the city center and the location is very convenient. Basically, one-day groups can come to pick you up!
Overall very satisfied, worth recommending to friends!

2. The room equipment is luxurious, the washbasin and luggage countertops are jade-like textures. I have actually seen it for the first time after staying in more than 100 hotels.

From the doorman service to the room introduction, it has the feel of a high-end hotel. Butler Andy's service is very good, afternoon tea and happy hour are great, breakfast is also a la carte and semi-buffet, the food is exquisite and delicious. I will stay for a few more days in the future. The only drawback is that it is too low-key in the courtyard of the People's Building. Sometimes when calling a taxi, you will drive to another Sofitel next to it. I hope the instructions at the door can be clearer or provide guidance.

酒店外表看起來有點歷史，不知是翻新還是維護得很好。房間內除了窗簾比較有歷史感，其他的並沒有感受到一絲老破舊的痕跡。
設施也是很好，有要求服務響應很快很滿意。
員工態度也是十分的熱情，這是行業標準了。
地理位置也挺好的，距離城牆5分鐘，鐘樓5分鐘，很完美。
下次來西安，這酒店一定是首選。

衝著全國唯一一家索菲特傳奇而去，
建築物有70年歷史，外觀看起來就很歐式
步入旋轉感應門，歐式風格撲面而來
11點多到前台小姐姐很熱情幫忙check in 
全程很專業，講話也很温柔，有賓至如歸的感覺
再帶到6樓房間，就是忘記問對方名字以便點評感謝了
因為帶了孩子，訂的豪華首相雙人間，床稍微有點小，其餘都不錯，安靜、舒適

房間以這個價位來説偏小，但也還不錯

前台辦理入住，主動升級房型，雖然升級的房型朝向不滿意還是補差換了套房，還是值得肯定的。

不過在生日入住酒店，連一張問候卡片都沒有收到，也是第一次，想説離真正細緻高標準的服務還差口氣。
房間的熱水系統不太穩定，洗澡水忽冷忽熱，台盆的熱水放很久，水温熱水流很小。可能老樓的關係，燈泡也會有電壓不穩的閃爍。
早餐不錯，半點餐制，量不大，很友好，自助區有一種無麩質麥片，在麪食天下的西安也是用心了。

另外人民大廈大門進來有三家酒店，指示不夠清晰，如果路不熟的司機可能要花點時間。

msg:酒店有70年歷史，但是我們住酒店並不是奔着有歷史去的，酒店很小，到處都小，也很落後，當初定的時候感覺價格比麗思卡爾頓和w都高，所以想體驗，但是個人感覺這個價格太不值了，首先沒有雙床房，帶孩子不能住，入住的時候為了加床費用的問題大費口舌，孩子12歲，攜程標註13歲以上收費，孩子12歲，酒店認為認為超過12歲就應該收費，旅行不想影響心情，所以不想爭論，要同意的時候又説收個早餐就行，早餐太簡單了，住了四天到最後竟然衹吃了水果，不過7樓的歡樂時光每天下午去坐坐倒是挺好的，以前住酒店感覺價格差不多都不會差，但是以後真的要慎重

酒店因為疫情原因，這個五一格外安靜，前台管家安排了北向的房間，所以酒店就更顯得寧靜。窗外是70年歷史的建築，以及鬱鬱葱葱的花園，這個花園很有層次，尤其在這個季節，白楊楓樹高大參天，柳樹平添嫵媚，還有女貞梧桐，各種喬木，在草木之中，月季花開正濃。
這種花園，如果沒有幾十年的功夫，很難有這麼茂盛的感覺。
房間佈置也是法式宮廷風，以米白色為主。前台服務人員都很熱情，客人出入都會問好。
酒店假期還贈送了餐飲券，用於中餐廳，性價比很高。

早餐很多都是單點，點完後廚師會親自給你端過來。並且有各種鮮榨果汁。
買了帶早餐的套餐，還送了下午茶，有各種可以單點的飲料，雞蛋，小糕點，簡單沙拉三明治。服務極好，穿着燕尾服的前台會下幾級樓梯幫客人拿行李。
房間裏的傢俱佈置極具法式風格，有單獨的客衞。
美中不足的是，空調開得太大。當然這也是所有連鎖國際酒店的通病，希望以後能適量調高一些，更環保舒適。

2.早餐環境好，安靜，現做的熱食選擇有正反兩面，隨便點。每天廚師長還熱情的端着當日甜品請大家品嚐，還仔細詢問每個人的感受。
3特別表揚一下管家inner小姐姐，一點點的小猶豫小遲疑，都被細心發現，替客人着想，妥帖的安排，讓我感覺到了：home away from home！

另外另外：酒店園子裏有一排銀杏樹（見圖）和一大叢櫻花樹，春秋必定是極美的！

房間內部搭配有調性，配置精美。但是因為傢俱配置較多，感覺空間不大。我們帶着孩子，進去行李箱一放感覺都鋪滿了。
可能由於是老建築的關係，衞生間稍顯侷促，衹有一個小面盆，我的護膚化粧品和孩子的各種擦的一拿出來就沒地方擺了。
服務響應迅速，服務態度好。裏面的工作人員親和力都比較強，每次遇見都會詢問有沒有需要幫忙。
泳池稍小，但是人少，適合帶小孩去玩一下。
酒店早餐豐富，點餐和自助搭配。有當地特色小吃可以點，在裏面吃到了很好吃的肉夾饃。
房間裏面備品是愛馬仕的。小童也有專門的洗浴備品和拖鞋浴袍等（好像要打電話要才提供，我們孩子游泳習慣性會跟酒店要小童浴袍）
總體來説去西安遊玩推薦入住，體驗不錯。

酒店從禮賓到客房到餐廳，服務都超級棒。
禮賓部的胖哥哥會提醒今天要下雨，問我們有沒有帶傘。餐廳的小姐姐居然記得我前一天要了兩杯咖啡，問我今天還是一樣嗎。

我買的是兩晚的首相和兩晚的豪華首相套票，看我們帶着小朋友給免費升級成四晚都是豪華首相，很贊。房間每日水果，迷你吧，開夜床服務都很到位。順便説一下，套票裡帶的雙人晚餐量很大，我們兩大一小根本吃不完。

非常不錯的入住體驗，下次來西安一定還會選擇傳奇。

msg:大概就是所謂的期待越高、失望越大，特意放在了最後一天來體驗。但説實話，很一般，服務不太能匹配6星還是5星的稱號。
兩點check in時説在查房、需要等候3到4分鐘，結果等了半小時才入住。等候期間沒見其他入住客人，可見跟暑期高峯並無關聯。最失望的是等待過程中沒有任何一名工作人員主動關切並照顧客人情緒，我們詢問後才端上一杯白開水，實在有失服務水準。
有小朋友入住並未提前備好小童洗漱用品、拖鞋浴袍。 minibar收費，遠不如之前幾天住的一家精品酒店大氣，水、茶、小零食不斷，可以隨意自取。
其它服務如免費漢服租借、傳説中的介紹傳奇之旅，都是我們自己在網上看到點評並詢問後才得知有。
沒有體會到極致的管家式服務，除了入住當天介紹了一下房間的設施。
最令人詫異的是離開時居然沒有服務生幫忙提行李。
還有離店後的一個小插曲。入住期間送浴袍時詢問了一下有沒有孩子浴袍，服務人員可能沒聽清沒有任何響應，想想算了。離店後接到酒店打來的電話，説房內內兩件浴袍不見了，不同工作人員交接口述時變成了我們小孩是不是不小心自己放到行李箱了。這樣的曲解也是蠻無語的。
工作人員態度挺疏離，也有可能是我們和之前幾天住的酒店的熱情服務相對比、以及對索菲特較高的期待所導致的主觀感受。
當然也有還不錯的服務，免費加床、漢服租借處的小姐姐比較熱心幫忙挑選服飾、愛馬仕的洗漱用品，但整體而言，服務差強人意。
