Mr. Sean checked us in, he was super welcoming and professional. It was our daughter’s birthday so the hotel gave us TWO birthday cakes for free when we requested for a chocolate cake. Thank you so much for your great hospitality. We had a great stay as always. Highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling with kids. There is a play area for kids at their restaurant too. Breakfast buffet is great, different varieties of yummy food. Their dinner buffet is also great. A lot of seafood etc. Highly recommend

What is unlucky is that it happened to have a electronic musical festival going on there at the water park. They have those heavy metal music going on and on until 10 pm. If you have kids with you I would suggest to avoid the music festival!
But the hotel itself is very comfortable.

msg:Went here for an unplanned staycation when my children were driving me mad at home. Very child friendly and the employees are lovely. It’s not the kind of place to come if you don’t like children, noise or a bit of wear and tear.  The water park next door is really noisy but at least it drowns out the sound of your own children bickering (no pun intended). Bit of a hiccup with room service but they were very good about it, alls well that ends well, and anyway it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the pool is open to 10pm and the water park across the way stopped pumping out loud music at 7.30 so we had a lovely evening swim. Same went for the morning we got in the pool at 9am and it was still fairly quiet until we got out at 11.30am.  Room service food was fine, I don’t think especially pricey for a hotel of this kind and frankly there is nothing to stop you going to the global centre for something else if you’d rather.  Pool is nice and saves you from entering the absolute bedlam of the waterpark next door (I went once before, never again, not for the faint of heart). Breakfast was very nice, plenty of choice.  Before we left I put my bags in left luggage and went to the Global Centre where I bought makeup and we all had macdonalds and left happy. Overall we had a fun time. I then forgot something I’d left in the room, called slightly panicky, they located it and called me back within minutes. Really impressed. 
One slight annoyance was that I couldn’t find a machine that would rent me a phone charger pack, unlike others I’ve used in Chengdu both machines I found claimed they could only rent to Chinese nationals. 
Overall though I’d definitely go back again for a change of scene and a hotel where children are welcome.

It is recommended that the hotel increase the number of staff for management. Everything else was good. I will come again in a few days.

The hotel sent manager Liu Tao to provide butler service. He was very enthusiastic and provided us with thoughtful service. We arranged a view room with a view of the water world. In addition, the next day, our friends temporarily stayed for one night and added a bed. The hotel also solved the furniture arrangement in the room very well, and my friends lived very comfortably. The hotel's equipment is a bit old, and the toilet broke after a few uses. Fortunately, the repairman came in time. There was some smoke in the toilet. We lived in a non-smoking room. It was probably from the sewer or ventilation system. In short, it was a good experience.

msg:I originally wanted to go to the InterContinental Hotel for study and reference, but was disappointed.

Facilities: Let’s talk about the facilities first. There are quite a lot of things in the room, but many of them are quite old. There are no instructions for everything, so you can’t find anything wherever you look. The toiletries were not replaced when they were gone. There were no sandals, no disposable slippers, nothing in the room. I called to ask for them. After they were delivered, the waiter didn't say a word, and there was no service attitude at all. Many facilities in the room are broken and have become furnishings and cannot be used. Although they are a bit old, many of them can be improved.
Hygiene: Now talking about hygiene, there are obvious stains in the mouthwash cup. This should not be found in a high-star hotel. Detailed hygiene is not very good.
Environment: The hotel is in a good location. Inside Universal, you can see the water park when you open the window, which is suitable for parent-child travel.
Service: I don’t know if there is a lack of manpower. There are quite a lot of people in the restaurant, but I feel that there is not enough manpower at the front desk. What surprised me most is that as a high-star hotel, you cannot check in with an electronic ID card. I didn’t forget to bring my ID card. I asked for help. Is the photo acceptable? The front desk kept saying that only the ID card for check-in was required, which meant that no ID card was needed for check-in. I was shocked that it could be done like this. There was almost no service at all during the entire stay. When checking out, my friend fell in the lobby and no staff cared about doing anything.
Alas, the overall stay experience is quite disappointing. I don’t know how the good reviews came about.

The weather in Chengdu finally cleared up at the end of the holiday, and my son could finally play in the water park that he had longed for. The hotel is also very convenient, not far from the airport, and the environment is not bad. It is a proper resort hotel. There are several hotels. There are two rooms, but there is a shuttle bus, which is also very convenient. Although I arrived very late, the housekeeper Cherry contacted me early in the morning and learned that I was specializing in the water park. I specially secured the room closest to the park and also prepared baby supplies for my son, which was very considerate. Another particularly good thing is that the hotel can exchange breakfast for lunch. I happened to arrive late the day before, so I could have a good sleep and have lunch the next day. This is great, and the lunch was not bad. All in all, my stay was very enjoyable. Satisfied

The Global Center has complete dining and entertainment facilities, and you can enjoy your vacation happily with your children just staying in the Global Center.

msg:I came to Chengdu for a rare holiday with my family. My friend recommended that I must stay at the InterContinental Hotel Global Center. It is indeed a good choice. The hotel is very beautiful. It is located in a complex. There is a subway that can directly reach Tianfu Airport. It is next to the shopping mall. It is really convenient for me to travel with two children. Special thanks to the housekeeper Cherry. We called me early in the morning when we were still in Sanxingdui to help prepare the room. Knowing that we were with children, she was particularly considerate to prepare children's supplies and bed fences, arranged a room close to the lobby, and prepared small gifts for the children. Many hotels do not have this service. Although I was very tired when I arrived at the hotel, the children were still very excited when they arrived at the room. I especially liked the down pillows in the room. It was so comfortable. I woke up the next day without the fatigue of the first day. The swimming pool is also great. I checked in in a hurry and felt the hot spring. The water temperature is very suitable. It is worth mentioning that because our flight was delayed, the housekeeper specially arranged for us to check out late and afternoon tea in the executive lounge. The Earl Grey tea in the afternoon tea was delicious, and Napoleon was also delicious. I bought another box when I left. In short, it was a perfect stay. I will bring my children to the water park again in the summer vacation.

msg:I stayed in the hotel for one night when I went to Chengdu to visit relatives. The hotel is located in the Global Center of Chengdu Hi-tech Zone. There is an indoor water world. Although it was not open when I checked in, the children still had a pleasant weekend. Let me share my experience of staying here.
Facilities: There are many guest rooms in the hotel. This time I stayed in a parent-child room with my children. There is a garden, bunk beds, bathtubs, dolls and toys in the room. The hotel provides free facilities such as gyms, swimming pools, and shuttle buses. There are large businesses around the hotel. Generally speaking, it is very convenient.
Hygiene: Although it is a ten-year-old hotel, the basic decoration is made of stone, the materials are relatively sophisticated, and it is well maintained. The quality of InterContinental's bedding and linens is still good, but it is recommended to further increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfection of sofas and other furniture, so as to bring a better stay experience.
Environment: Parking in the surrounding area is expensive. Although the money is not much, it is far higher than the normal level of parking fees in the market. This will greatly affect the stay experience. It is recommended to negotiate with the property for improvement.
Service: I have to give a thumbs up to the service of Paradise InterContinental. The service of Jim, the butler, started before check-in. He welcomed guests upon check-in, provided small surprise toys, cakes and fruits upon check-in, and children's sanitary ware. The full details fully took care of the various needs of parent-child travel. The small episodes that occurred during the check-in were also thoughtfully solved. It received praise from the whole family and made them feel at home.
In general, I will come again and look forward to my next stay.

Finally, it is also very suitable to stay here to catch an early flight to Tianfu Airport✈️. It is very close to the highway exit and the time is controllable👍

He took the initiative to contact us in advance and helped to upgrade the room to a room with a garden on the first floor. He prepared children's products in advance and arranged welcome fruits for us. When we checked in, there was a little unpleasantness due to the work error of the concierge. Chen contacted me in time and took the initiative to upgrade our room to a superb one-bedroom suite for the next day. My husband and children were very satisfied. Although the hotel is a bit old, the overall maintenance is still very good, and the cleanliness is very clean. The breakfast level of InterContinental is still relatively stable. The breakfast croissant is particularly delicious. The wagyu golden noodles of this InterContinental breakfast are said to be very famous and taste really good. Guests staying in the hotel buy Napoleon at 15% off, and they brought a lot for their friends when they left. This time I came mainly to SKP shopping, and it is very close to walk through the door of the hotel and the Global Center. I hope the hotel can arrange parking tickets. I will stay here next time. I feel that it is very convenient to bring children to play and go shopping here.

The ocean world outside belongs to a third party. You need to purchase separate tickets to play with water in summer and slides in winter.

My friends liked it very much after watching it and hope to come and play next summer.

Not only is the hotel environment and facilities good, the service staff are also very kind and professional, especially the hotel butler, Manager Xiong, who proactively helped us solve problems when we encountered them, allowing us to Feel the warmth of home in the field. The child felt uncomfortable and vomited, so the waiter was immediately called to clean up and bring medicine. Later, the bed sheets were accidentally soiled and they were replaced in time. This is a warm hotel. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Chengdu in the future, and will also recommend it to my relatives and friends.

Before we arrived on the day of check-in, Sharon J called us, introduced the hotel and rooms in detail, and added WeChat for any questions. Answer, very patiently. Full marks for service.
What I have to mention is the parking fee at the hotel. We stayed for three days and two nights, and the parking fee was 300 yuan. They said we used the minibar to make up for it. We don’t usually drink Coke, and a few cans of drinks are not worth 300 yuan. The parking fee A big discount for Intercontinental. Another regret is that the water park is not open. The children booked a hotel for New Year's Eve because of the water park. They were disappointed. There were no children's activities during the New Year. The hotel swimming pool only opened one big one and two small pools. Overall, it was not interesting. , if it is a family trip, it still makes sense to wait until the water park opens.

Children can play in the Ocean Park next to the hotel all day long, which is great.

She is not just a hotel housekeeper, but more like our friend in another place. She went out of her way to answer our questions and gave us lots of helpful advice and tips. She introduced us to the most famous attractions in Chengdu, such as Kuanzhai Alley, Jinli Ancient Street, Wuhou Temple, etc. She also told us how to use public transportation to visit Chengdu, so that we can experience the charm of this city more conveniently.
The experience of staying at the Paradise Interstate was also great. The hotel's facilities are all available, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the beds are soft and comfortable, allowing us to enjoy a good sleep every night. Breakfast provides a wealth of choices, whether Chinese or Western, to meet the needs of different tastes. Cherry's friendly attitude and thoughtful service made us feel at home.
When we left Chengdu, we were filled with wonderful memories of this city. We thank Cherry and Paradise Interstate for an unforgettable travel experience. We hope to return to Chengdu in the near future, stay at this delightful hotel again, and meet Cherry again. Thank you for your warm hospitality! Looking forward to our next gathering!

As the last stop of this trip, I am so satisfied with choosing Global Intercontinental. It is close to Shuangliu Airport, 50 minutes by subway, and 30 minutes by car. The hotel is close to two major shopping malls, so it is very convenient for eating, drinking, playing, and walking the kids.

The child likes to swim. The hotel has a 39-degree heated swimming pool. The child does not want to get up to play. At this time, I have to praise the butler service provided by the hotel.

The housekeeper Grace who arranged the room contacted us in advance before we arrived at the hotel to understand our needs in detail. According to our needs, she thoughtfully prepared a room close to the swimming pool. In the cold winter, she ensured that we could return from the swimming pool in the shortest distance. When we got to the room, we thanked Grace for being so considerate. During our stay, Grace also answered all our questions and quickly helped us solve our problems, which made us feel the warmth and warmth of Intercontinental.

The hotel's bedding is comfortable, the toiletries are good, and the space in the family suite is reasonably allocated to meet the different needs of a family of young and old. It is a resort hotel that I will come back to and recommend to friends.

We are looking forward to coming back to InterContinental during the summer vacation to experience the water park!

I hesitated for a long time between Global Center Intercontinental and Century City Intercontinental, and finally chose Global Center Intercontinental. Facts have proved that if you are walking a baby, there is nothing wrong with choosing this!
Because I set out with two orders, on the high-speed train, I received a call from the intercontinental housekeeper at Century City to inquire about check-in. After a brief explanation, I have been waiting for the call from the housekeeper at Global Center Intercontinental, but I didn’t get there. Maybe I missed it. ! When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a cute lady in red clothes as soon as we entered. Later I found out that she was Selena, the deputy guest relations manager. She showed us the room, checked in, introduced us to the hotel's facilities and areas, and even took the initiative to add WeChat also provided good contact for our itinerary planning in the next few days! Seeing that we had a baby, we sent a special WeChat message to prepare exquisite souvenirs for our baby. I felt beautiful and professional👍
As for the hotel, although it opened earlier, the quality of InterContinental is there, and there are no problems such as obsolescence. The quality is online!
On the first day of happy hour in the executive lounge, I felt that the service staff was insufficient, and the supply of dishes and drinks was somewhat out of line. There was a significant improvement on New Year's Day. It is recommended that the hotel pay attention to the guest experience in the lounge and increase staffing in time! The two handsome guys were so busy that they took off. The two handsome guys on the 31st were still very enthusiastic in their service!
Finally, when it comes to baby-walking, the hotel has everything to eat, drink and have fun, including a children's playground, shopping mall, SKP across the street, and local specialty snacks. It is not too convenient to bring children! All in all, bringing your baby is the right thing to do 🤭 I hope InterContinental will continue to maintain good guest relations!
Finally, I want to mention something. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a fat gentleman. Seeing me carrying my bag and my family holding the child, he just opened the trunk for me and did not take the initiative to carry the big suitcase for me. A little hope it can be strengthened! I hope the InterContinental Hotel at Global Center will get better and better

I like it very much ~ I feel that it is indeed an Intercontinental, but I didn't feel happy for a few minutes before I discovered this room. The hygiene is indeed average. There is a pillowcase on the cupboard at the end of the bed. I don't know if it is used or not. Maybe there are too many rooms and the staff's service cannot keep up. The facilities are relatively old, and there is always a feeling of dust in the air. The most unbearable thing is the bad smell in the bathroom... It's a pity that such a beautiful bathroom, the room is filled with the smell of sewer return all night, not to mention how uncomfortable it is, not having it all night Sleep well. Later, I called the waiter to come and see, but there was nothing I could do. I just put a bottle of fragrance, which was of no use. After checking out, the lady also called to say that the hotel would make rectifications.
There is a fee for parking in the hotel. It cost about 70 yuan for one night. The elevator is not directly accessible and you need to walk a long way with your luggage. The breakfast options are relatively limited and the taste is average. This is too different from the impression of intercontinental. To be honest, I am very disappointed.

Whether you are playing in the water or shopping for food, it only takes a few minutes after you leave the room. After all, there are a lot of people everywhere during the Double Festival, so it’s quite comfortable to play comfortably and relax among the crowd.
On the day of departure, while I was still on the high-speed train, I received a call from the hotel housekeeper Xiaoyan, asking about my specific needs. She specially booked me a deluxe room on the eighth floor and prepared welcome fruits. The service remained high even during the peak period of the Double Festival holiday. Excellent quality, must give it a thumbs up!
The room was overall very nice, with a super large bed and a balcony with a view. The sitting area of ​​the room has a comfortable double sofa and desk, and the layout is OK.
The hotel has a heated swimming pool exclusively for guests. Of course, you can also choose to go rafting, surfing, and water skiing in the nearby Global Center Ocean Park. There will be many people there to accompany you.
It is said that the Global Center cost tens of billions at the time. It is an all-inclusive super complex with extremely rich accommodation brands. So if you are too lazy to go and see the heads of people, just staying near the hotel and eating out is enough fun. However, I couldn't help but go to Jinli and met the melancholy bear and the orange cat napping on the roof. They were such a cute couple.
The best thing about the hotel buffet is the soup noodles and rice noodles, the bamboo shoot soup with meat sauce, and the hot soup is sprinkled with coriander and chopped green onion. It tastes very good, recommended!

msg:Stayed for three nights in early November and it was very nice. The hotel is very cost-effective. If the park is open in the summer, it will probably be more lively, but there will be a lot of people. The hotel breakfast is by the pool, which is very beautiful. As for the room, it was very hot for a few days in early November, but the air conditioner in the hotel was turned off. It was quite hot at night because the hotel is located in the Global Center, so it is very convenient to go to Global Center to eat and other things. The hotel has cribs and bed rails, which are basically available for parents and children under the Intercontinental brand. This is very necessary for raising babies. The hotel itself does not have a dedicated children's playground. Perhaps because it is integrated with the Universal Center Park and shopping mall, the baby basically did not play much with the hotel's facilities during the few days he was in the hotel. It would be better if you have your own amu*****t park, such as ocean balls, trampolines, etc. Although you can spend money in shopping malls, most parent-child hotels will have their own amu*****t park. Hope it can be gradually improved. Overall it's very good. I will choose here again next time I come to Chengdu.

I called the front desk and they said that if I change rooms, I might have the same problem and they can help me deal with it. I think I didn't ask them to deal with it, I just opened the door to get some air. Overall stay experience is good

msg:The hotel management service is very poor. I stayed for 5 days in total, and I was already confirming the order information with the hotel housekeeper at noon on the day of check-in. After confirming, I thought it would save more time to check in at night. Unexpectedly, the hotel front desk could not find the order. Finally, I showed the confirmation message with the hotel housekeeper, saying that the room would be reserved for me for enough time. But I have to pay for the room. The problem is that I have already paid for the room or authorized the deduction upon departure. At 7.8 o'clock on the last night, the hotel called again and said that I had not paid for the room. Ctrip customer service asked me if I would directly authorize the card to charge the fee. I agreed. During the period, I also contacted the housekeeper to solve the problem, thinking that everything was solved, but on the last morning The room card was stopped directly. Halfway through playing with my children, I had to go to the front desk to renew my room card, but the front desk once again said that I had not paid the room fee. I showed my charge information, but the hotel front desk refused to give me the room card because they had not received the money. Ctrip also stated that they had indeed deducted the fee, and stated that the hotel had confirmed the order and fee issues with them multiple times. As a customer, I don't understand why the hotel can do this. Since the hotel has communicated with the service platform many times and the customer showed the deduction voucher, it still said that the guest did not pay and did not give the guest a room card. As such a large hotel, it is impossible for every guest to pay cash at the store. What is the cooperation and negotiation channel between the hotel and major service platforms? This is not what I should bear as a customer. For this stay, if there can be a negative score, then I will definitely give a negative score!

msg:The hurried trip to Chengdu ended successfully. In the past, when I went to Chengdu, I would always look for hotels near Kuanzhai Alley. This time my friend bought a new house near the InterContinental Hotel, and he helped me book it at the InterContinental Paradise. I had other friends traveling with me, so I booked a room on Ctrip. When we arrived at the destination, a friend told us that the hotel was very big because it was connected to a shopping mall and divided into several areas. I checked in at the front desk because I wanted to have two rooms together, so I asked the front desk. Ms. Yu at the front desk patiently helped us check in and gave us two free breakfasts. And told me that I can contact her if I have any questions during my stay. The little girl is enthusiastic and thoughtful and must order 👍. The room is very comfortable, 🈶 balcony, and very clean. The next day we went out and accidentally touched the do not disturb switch. The hotel and the cleaning lady communicated with me in time. Very heartwarming. The breakfast was also very delicious. I stayed for a few days and tasted a variety of different meals. The swimming pool is right inside the restaurant, which feels nice

I asked a service girl how to take the subway. Unexpectedly, the girl took us from the hotel through the shopping mall to the subway entrance. Unfortunately, I was afraid of being rude and didn't ask the girl her name. On the night of check-in, the hotel also sent a large plate of fruit to each of the two rooms, which was very considerate. The cleaning staff are also very good. In short, the service is worthy of being intercontinental.
The downside is that hotel parking is not free. Breakfast is a little less refined.

msg:My favorite family hotel in Chengdu, Global Center Tianxue Intercontinental, is a hotel that is not tiring and easy to take care of with kids. Although the facilities are a bit old, I am overall very satisfied with the hotel and it is very suitable for bringing kids.
The hotel and the entire Global Center Lotte Depar**ent Store are a whole building. You can walk your kids, eat, go shopping, play in the water, and take a bath in the Global Center without going out. It is no exaggeration to say that we did not go out for three whole days. I don’t feel it’s raining outside, I don’t know if it’s cloudy or sunny, haha~~
Although the facilities are not new enough, the rooms are slightly larger than the star hotels in the city center, with a large balcony. Since it is the National Day holiday, a national flag is hung on each balcony, which is particularly a**ospheric and shocking! You can see the big screen of the amusement park in the distance. If you like the hustle and bustle, you can order a takeaway balcony drink. I like to close the door quietly and immediately block out the sound.
If you don’t want to eat in the hotel, you can go to the shopping mall, where snacks and various brand chain restaurants are available. In the past, you could take the hotel shuttle bus to get there in a few minutes, and it’s only a few minutes away to take a stroll after eating. For beautiful moms who like shopping, there is SKP right across the street😃
Because the overall experience is better, I still want to stay in this hotel next time I go to Chengdu.

First of all, the booking was cared for by the concierge Jim and the butler Jim provided full service. We arranged to upgrade the room type and it was warm all the way. Excellent service and careful guidance. The day of check-in happened to be my sister's birthday, and they arranged a surprise birthday cake and a**ospheric gifts for us. We experienced the thoughtful and meticulous five-star service. So I will summarize it from five dimensions.
        Service# One-to-one butler-style service, responsive to all requests.
        Environment# The poolside scenery is relaxing and refreshing, and the hall is magnificent.
        Hygiene# Clean and comfortable, the bedding is high-end and comfortable.
        Facilities # The facilities are complete, including water facilities for children, especially suitable for family vacations.
        Location # The location is convenient for transportation. The core area of ​​the High-tech Zone is very dazzling. Opposite is Chengdu SKP

         All in all, I am very satisfied with all the services and environment. If you come to Chengdu next time, you will choose Paradise Intercontinental. Thanks again to concierge Jim for his full service, which left a very good impression on us.

They helped to book the room in advance and chose Area C, which is closer to the restaurant. There is no need to take the shuttle bus, and it was upgraded to exclusive for free. house. The entire hotel is surrounded by Ocean Park. The room is spacious and clean, with a bathtub, a cloakroom and a large balcony. The balcony has a clothes drying rod and children's toiletries. The shopping mall has everything you need to eat, drink, and play, and you can stay there all day without going out. The only bad thing is that our room was on the second floor and it was a little noisy.

The bed is big, soft and comfortable. Drinks in the room (including those in the refrigerator) are free to drink without charge. Hot spring baths are free, very suitable for family fun. The hotel also provided fruit. The breakfast is very rich, and the service attitude is very good, especially Xiao Li, the front desk clerk, is very good.

msg:This should be the seventh time I have stayed in an IHG hotel, and it is really a surprise every time! Because there is only one day difference between my girlfriend's birthday and Chinese Valentine's Day, I booked a garden suite at InterContinental Universal to celebrate the two festivals together. After ten o'clock in the morning on the day of check-in (waking up not too early or too late), Ms. Amanda, the manager of the InterContinental Hotel, got in touch with me—she is a warm, caring, and warm woman, and I feel even more so after meeting at the poolside restaurant— —Ms. Amanda asked me in detail about my needs for room layout and service details, such as whether to prepare any surprises! So there were very special clay bouquets and custom picture frames, as well as great seating at the poolside restaurant. I have to say that the food at the InterContinental Hotel is always hard to disappoint. Among the cafeterias in Chengdu where you can rest assured to eat, the Global InterContinental is a rare choice of cost-effective. In the afternoon of the next day, we went directly to the water park from the internal road of the hotel. Ms. Amanda even helped us to delay the check-out until 4 o'clock so that we could go back to shower and change clothes after the game. In addition, I want to mention that the omelette for breakfast is not listed, so I need to ask the handsome chef who made the omelette to help me make it! This is a perfect hotel travel experience, my girlfriend and I are very happy, thanks again to everyone at Global InterContinental!

msg:It depends on taking the baby to Paradise Island to play in the water during the summer vacation.
The hotel has 4 districts, ABCD, and you need to take a shuttle bus. Districts B and C are closer to Paradise Island, and District D is the farthest. Hotel guests get a 10% discount on going to Paradise Island. In fact, the hotel also has its own swimming pool, which is not particularly large. Guests staying in the hotel need to wear swimming caps and swimsuits.
The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory, and there are still many types. Children over 1.4 make up 78. Sitting by the pool is hotter. A drink from the minibar was given at check-in. Wanglaoji and beer in the small refrigerator are also good, and there can be less carbonated drinks.
The only thing that bothers me is that after we checked in, we were told that we could enter the room at 2:30. We all finished eating in the mall after 3:00, and the auntie was still cleaning the room when we got to the room. Tired and sleepy after waiting for a long time, it is understandable that there are too many people and insufficient manpower during the summer vacation, but sitting on the sofa next to an aunt who is the same age as my mother has been sweating and cleaning it is very uncomfortable.
I hope that next time I bring my baby to stay with me, I will have a different feeling.

msg:Very satisfying experience, it should be said that it is the best service experience of staying in a hotel for many years!
It's my little girl's birthday on the weekend, and I booked the InterContinental. I plan to come to the pool to have a buffet seafood barbecue, and the children to swim or go surfing in Ocean Park.
On Friday, I received a call from InterContinental Hotel’s customer service Coco, added WeChat, and arranged a detailed itinerary for me, especially helping me to book a place by the water at the Paradise Island Seafood Buffet Restaurant, and also recommended buying 300-500 vouchers, In this way, my 1,000 yuan dinner was finally settled for 600 yuan; I heard that the child gave us a birthday cake after his birthday, which is very considerate.
      Write down the other contents truthfully: if the swimming pool needs a swimming ring, it is best to rent a big 60 goose; I have two children, and it is a waste to buy two 118 first; secondly, there must be a swimming cap, and I forgot to bring it. Hang up more than 100 and buy three. The money is a bit wronged, of course, the responsibility lies with me;
    Overall, my little daughter spent her 7th birthday here, very satisfied, and will come again in the future! I hope that the 3,500 yuan parent-child room in the hotel has a discount. If it is 1,500-2,000, I will bite the bullet. Hahaha
     The inpatient hotel business is booming, and I wish Ms. Coco, whom I have never met, happy every day.

I have a deep memory of the water world adjacent to the hotel, the swimming pool next to the breakfast room (you can swim in the water at any time and then come up to continue eating), and the freshly squeezed watermelon juice for breakfast. This time I came to Chengdu again Ordered here. After booking two rooms, the hotel housekeeper, Cao Zhiwei, took the initiative to contact me two days in advance to ask about my room preference, and thoughtfully gave me a connecting room. After two days of staying, adults and children are very satisfied. The first round of drinks in the small refrigerator is free, and there are plastic slippers in the room for the convenience of going to the water world. Generally speaking, it meets the standard and tonality of InterContinental, especially if you want to play in the water world, this is really the first choice. How happy it is to be able to return to the room immediately after playing for a day! We stayed for two nights this time, and we played in the water world for two consecutive days. The child was very happy, and it can be regarded as carrying her full of childhood memories~

The shopping malls around me don’t have much interest in shopping and they’re cheaper Some of the brands feel that the Global Center is a Phnom Penh shell with a spectacular appearance. The core does not match the children’s water play. It’s really too ordinary. It’s a project that can be found in any third- and fourth-tier cities, but it’s considered the best in Chengdu. The water doesn’t change every day at nine o’clock in the morning. From the room, I saw a few workers starting to pick up sundries. After a while, tourists entered the venue and continued to enjoy the pool on the first day.

If we bring our kids and don't take a battery car, we will be tired walking around on the road all day. The swimming pool and restaurant are in District A, one north and one south of us. After swimming today, I went to the lobby to eat some snacks. All the waiters from the swimming pool to the lobby didn't know where to change into a dry bathrobe. The concierge stood at the door of the guest room in District C and said he didn't know where to get it. Finally, the front desk staff asked the concierge to get it from the guest room in District A. Are the facilities really reasonable? Or did we not stay in the administrative room in District A because we didn't pay enough, so they arranged the farthest guest room for me? The Ocean Park is too boring. I advise foreign tourists who come here not to go in. Adults are 188, children are 100, and there is no free ticket. Sunac is really a little crazy. What level of park is this... Atlantis can't compare, and Chimelong can't compare. It's really disappointing and boring. The only advantage is that it is connected to the shopping mall, so you don't have to worry about food and drink.
The hotel facilities are old, the sofa is dirty, there is no night light, and it is the first time I have encountered a parking fee charged by the hour! ! The front desk staff gave me feedback on my dissatisfaction and gave me breakfast for my 98cm child. It turns out that breakfast for children under one meter is charged!

I brought my children to play, and I still had a good time, but the food and beverages are really a little bit far away. The buffet at night is completely sorry for the price. The food and drinks are a bit shabby, and the breakfast is too ordinary. There is nothing to eat.

msg:I have lived in many five-star hotels at home and abroad with my baby, and I am well-informed, but this time I stayed at Paradise Intercontinental, but I was moved by the service here. First of all, Kevin Li Linguo helped us upgrade to a suite with a garden in Zone A. Next to the suite is the swimming pool and breakfast restaurant, and it is some distance from Ocean Paradise, so it is relatively quiet at night. Secondly, the hotel management is very thoughtful. The front desk, room service, restaurant, swimming pool and other staff are not only professional and efficient, but also warm and thoughtful from the bottom of their hearts, responding to requests without shuffling each other. The "customer-centric" service concept is engraved into the DNA of the staff. The children like this place very much. Yesterday, they really didn’t want to leave the hotel. Before they left, they cried and cried, until I promised him that they would come back to Chengdu next time. InterContinental Paradise is the first choice for family vacations.

The park is not hot, and it is even a bit cold indoors. After playing in the water park, we went directly to the hot spring for a dip. It was very comfortable. The housekeeper, ursula, is very nice. After he took the initiative to add me, he helped me upgrade the room type. The staff at the front desk who helped me check in knew that our family of three also gave us a special breakfast. I also helped my friend to check in in advance. I didn’t wait until the afternoon. In the case of such a heavy traffic during the summer vacation, I also applied for a late check-out until after 4 pm. It’s really considerate❤️

msg:The first negative review on Ctrip was given to InterContinental! The rating on Ctrip is 4.7 which is really not unreasonable! This hotel is just like the Global Center store, which has the worst service and the worst hardware facilities among all five-star hotels! The worst dining environment!
First, this hotel is built right next to the water park and does not have any children's toiletries! We called at about ten o'clock on the first night and asked for a toothbrush! Urged three times! After waiting for more than an hour, the child was so sleepy that he threw a temper tantrum and didn’t even get it! The first time I called, I was given the reason: there were too few night shift waiters! not enough people! I called a second time and gave the reason: We are a hotel for adults, so we don’t have children’s equipment as standard! I asked back: Are all your water parks for adults? The waiter replied: Yes! When the waiter brought it, he was angrier than me. He handed it to me and turned away! I didn’t even say a word about waiting, sorry! Oh my God! Is this a five-star hotel? 1,000+ pairs of hotels without breakfast. That’s it? !
Facilities: The house facilities are very old! There was water dripping from the door frame of the room for two days! I get it on my head every time I come out of the bathroom!
Dining environment; Breakfast is in Water World! They don't have a dedicated breakfast restaurant! It’s the food stall of Water World! No air conditioning, no fans! Just the sweltering heat of bleaching powder. Breakfast for 178 people. My clothes were soaked after eating! It just so happens that the self-service can help guests eat less! Coax people on time at half past ten!
Breakfast in a five-star hotel is always a treat! Because with this kid, my family takes breakfast very seriously! The next day I resolutely gave up and ate at the Starbucks next door! I really have no appetite, so I eat breakfast with the smell of bleach!
In addition, we left our children’s clothes at the hotel when we checked out! We called multiple times to ask the waiter to look it up for us! pity! Nobody cares about you! Nobody replied to you! At least reply to see if we have found it! As a result, I asked my friend to find it in the hotel! hahaha! This hotel is the worst among five stars! none of them! It is simply incomparable to Hilton and Marriott! Please keep your eyes open! It's not necessary to play in the water world and live next to it. Don't stay here all night! Simply unreasonable!

Before I came here, I thought that like Atlantis Sanya, although there is a water world outside, it is separate from the hotel. No matter how crazy the outside is, the hotel room is quiet. And Chengdu Intercontinental, let you feel the KTV disco style in the room every minute [wipe sweat]

#室室# The overall is old, the attitude of the staff is quite good, and the rest have not had time to experience. Bear the brunt of the sound and light pollution.

Of course, if you brought your baby to high, you may feel that the a**osphere is particularly good, and eating in the mall is also convenient. But the truth is a bit too loud and too late.

Finally, the location of the room is so far away, it is inconvenient to bring children, although there is a shuttle bus.

The water park is from 10:00-22:00, and there is no limit to the number of entries and exits. There are also discounted tickets on Thursdays.
The hotel is clean and hygienic, and the balconies of all rooms face the water park.
Special thanks to Cookie, the Deputy Manager of Guest Relations, for his warm and thoughtful service. Specially prepared toiletries for children. Fruits, desserts and children's toys were also presented as gifts.

msg:Chengdu is free and easy on the 5th, and I booked a hotel on the platform one month in advance, and the Intercontinental is the hotel for the last night. I booked the Marriott Executive for the previous three nights, and I was exhausted after three days of playing. I checked the InterContinental on the Internet before, which is relatively new, and I thought about going to the hotel for the last two days and one night. There is nothing to say about the environment and hardware. InterContinental's mattresses are so famous and extremely comfortable. I could have checked in 4 hours earlier, but I was told at 12:00 that the room was still being cleaned and I could only enter the room at 13:30 in the afternoon. I took my parents and children to the hotel for lunch buffet. There were not many people, and the sun umbrella was facing the cold at noon. The position of the fan is the only way to sit comfortably and not get too hot. It is worth mentioning that I just picked a few dim sum from the InterContinental Buffet, and they are all on the line. After check-in, the hotel service manager called to ask about the experience of check-in. I mentioned that I didn’t check in early, and I didn’t have the double bed I wanted, only the double bed. So these two problems were solved for me on the spot. Execution is still online. After swimming the next day, I suddenly found that the hotel did not put mineral water in the room on the first day, and there was only Sprite Coke in the minibar, so I called the service manager, and the waiter came over with 8 bottles of water at a time. On the return flight, I was a little dumbfounded. Of course, people didn’t know if our afternoon flight was right.
I personally like the gorgeous aisles of the Intercontinental Hotel, and the crystal lights are sensory. The intercontinental swimming pool is all residents of the store. Although it doesn't look as fun as the wave pool in the big shopping mall next door, it is enough for children to play. It is recommended to swim in summer.

The temperature is very good and the water quality is clean. There is no need to worry about safety issues. There are lifeguards in every area. member.

msg:I am from Chengdu, and I usually stay here to take my kids to play in their bathing pool. One of the two pools is 36 degrees and the other is 40 degrees. The temperature is very suitable. The children played in the cooler pool, and the adults soaked in the hotter pool. Especially when the temperature in Chengdu dropped sharply today, I felt warm and comfortable after soaking for an hour.
But the breakfast is not as good as before. I remember there used to be pangasius and fried vegetables, but they were not available this time. Then the porridge was very thin, basically only water and no rice...
Platinum Ambassador membership comes with privileges, and it is very convenient to eat or take out in the mall.

The most important thing is that the children had so much fun, one day was not enough, and then they continued for half a day. For grown-ups, it’s also a must. Crossing the road means SKP can stand it? Coffee, bread, all major brands, it’s so simple, just opened, the service attitude is very enthusiastic, I’m a little embarrassed not to buy it😬
In short, after visiting the major attractions in the capital, the last stop, a family trip, is recommended!

msg:Chengdu is crowded everywhere on May Day. I stayed for four days. After going out to see the people mountain people sea on the first day, I decided to give up going out for the next three days. I am very glad that I chose this hotel at that time. First of all, the service is very considerate. Although some employees are obviously relatively new, they are all concerned about the customer's experience. For example, our two children didn’t get up early for breakfast, and it’s hard to avoid queuing up during peak hours, but the length is completely acceptable. The staff has been delivering bread and yogurt, and there is a giant panda doll next to the children interacting with them. The children are not bored. The parking lot staff quietly put sun visors on the windshield of the car. The service staff Xiaohu was very thoughtful and predictable, and provided me with a lot of useful information on his own initiative, which saved me a lot of injustice. When I was leaving the store, a man helped me check out quickly and asked me about my stay experience and opinions. Secondly, the hotel is very playful, it is simply a paradise for children. There are dolls in the lobby to welcome us, and clowns to deliver balloons. The most important thing is that the swimming pool area is very large. In addition to the infinity pool and several hotter children's pools, there is also a bubble pool, which opens at 2 pm. Our two little ones go to check in on time every day, basically in the afternoon The hotel pool is soaking. One day in the middle, we went to the Ocean Paradise connected to the hotel. The hotel service staff kindly reminded hotel guests that they can check in 20 minutes earlier than other guests, so as to avoid queuing. We went to experience it quickly. Moreover, the hotel also offers a flexible policy of exchanging breakfast for lunch on May Day. We went to the park early that day after eating some bread, went back to the room at noon to wash up briefly, and had lunch in the cafeteria. After eating, the children jumped out of the bubble It’s a pool (the cafeteria is right by the pool), it’s really worth it, saving a few hundred. The hotel sends guests to SKP Gaohe is very cool, and the experience is full. Although the brand of Chengdu SKP is still relatively general, it is estimated that it is still being adjusted.
In short, it was a perfect trip, and I will come again next time.
On a negative note, parking is a bit expensive. It is recommended not to come by car, or park the car elsewhere.

Every time I stay, I have a very good feeling, first-class facilities, clean and beautiful environment, and the warm and thoughtful service of the waiters makes me feel It's very comfortable, especially on April 28 when I celebrated my granddaughter's birthday at the hotel. The hotel specially arranged tables and balls for us by the swimming pool, as well as birthday cakes. The children said it was so fun to eat in the balls and stay in the room What caught my eye was the birthday a**osphere created by Teyi, the colorful balloon shape, the exquisite paper cake, the photo album made by the hotel for my granddaughter, and the blessing signed by Jiang Xue, the manager of the lobby, which made me feel warm and moved——InterContinental The hotel deserves my first choice.

msg:In the global center outside the hotel, from the gate to the front desk, the environment is good, it is the glass roof, a bit empty and cool, it takes 2 minutes to walk to the front desk, and there is a little distance from the front desk to the D building where we checked in. When we checked in, the front desk didn't inform us of the pick-up The shuttle bus can be delivered for free. After walking for a long time, the room is not bad, facing the large slide, it is cold, it is not open, and it is still quiet. It is said to be a parent-child hotel, but there are no bathrobes, slippers and toiletries for children in the room
The first round of minibar is free, and the room service is very good, and it is called well
The breakfast service is very good. The manager on duty is very enthusiastic and will guide you to the seat and order coffee
The swimming pool is divided into cold water pool and warm water pool, which is quite good, because there are basically no people there on weekdays😝
There is an entrance in the middle of the CD building of the hotel to go to Lotte Depar**ent Store, where you can find everything you need to eat, drink and have fun. It’s a hot pot shop with special characteristics. I haven’t seen it🤭
To the south of the CD building is the Ocean Park, you can buy parent-child tickets from the Dianping group the day before, and the price is more favorable

In addition, it takes 24 hours to refund the deposit after check-out, which is a bit slower than other hotels
Overall, it is a little less a**osphere than the expected Intercontinental

After arriving at the hotel, because of some problems with the tires, all the repair shops were closed during the holidays during the Spring Festival. As a result, the problem could not be solved. Thanks to sean and jim, they helped find a way to inflate the tires and patiently called one by one. Calling various car repair shops, I finally found a suitable repair shop. It is so heartwarming. I really give it a full score. If I have the opportunity to go to Chengdu again in the future, I will definitely choose to stay at InterContinental Paradise Hotel Global Center. By the way, the cotton candy presented to the children in the hotel lobby is so cute!

In addition, the accommodation and parking are at your own expense, which is about 50 yuan a day. This should be informed in advance, and it is best to reduce this fee.

First of all, I don't ask for a free upgrade, and I don't know if the room type has been upgraded! And there is no eye contact at the front desk throughout the check-in process, let alone a smile! Simply the worst front desk ever! !
We took our children to send our luggage to the room, but we were asked to take it by ourselves, and we couldn't find the room. On the way, we met the porter who helped us deliver it. And the service at InterContinental is really bad. Seeing that we bring children, we don't even know how to send children's bathrobes and slippers...
When I checked out, the front desk didn't say a word, and the deposit was not refunded. I called to ask and said that I would arrive the next day. Will you die if you say one more word? Other homes are on the same day, you want the next day!

The only gratification is that the concierge and security guard at the door did provide active service when checking out, especially the security guard, who is the kind who sees life in his eyes👍

You are not afraid of the children being exposed to the sun. I didn't play. The next day, because some friends came and they were not sure where to stay, they didn't renew the room. After 12 noon, before my friends arrived, I went to the front desk and asked if I could check out until 2 o'clock. Who knows the front office manager (Kevin Li Linguo) agreed immediately, and helped me renew my room card (I'm afraid I won't be able to enter the room after 12 o'clock) The service is very considerate

msg:It takes about half an hour to get to the hotel from Shuangliu Airport.
The hotel is very large, and the accommodation seems to have buildings in areas A-E. Both D and E need to take battery cars. The check-in place of the hotel is too small relative to the size of the hotel, and there is no place to rest while waiting for the check-in, which is very crowded and tiring to stand. The best part of traveling to this hotel during the epidemic is that it provides nucleic acid services inside the hotel every afternoon. After all, it is terrible for foreign tourists to look for nucleic acid points outside and endure the high temperature of 40 degrees. There was a wait for more than ten minutes when the electric car came in and out, and the driver of the online car-hailing was going to go crazy. There are many people in Ocean Paradise, not only hotel guests but also many people who come to play specially.

The staff didn't say anything but shook their heads. I asked you if you didn't know anything, and the staff replied that I came on the first day today and was drunk. After arriving at the room, after opening the mini bar, it was empty. The room I booked was to use the mini bar for free, but it was empty. After calling to make up the drink, the front desk explained that it may have been forgotten. It was the first time I encountered such a thing in a five-star hotel.

msg:It is said that this hotel is the top 1 parent-child hotel in Chengdu. It is famous from Wuhan, and it is a worthwhile trip! ! First of all, I would like to thank the customer manager Tina and the hotel for their warm hospitality: we are two mothers with a 7-year-old (about 120) and a 10-year-old child (about 140) staying in a twin room (including 2 breakfasts). I ordered a separate buffet breakfast for the children. I didn't expect the hotel to directly give the children two buffet breakfasts. The children were very happy, thank you very much! !
        InterContinental Hotel Universal Center is an all-indoor five-star hotel integrating shopping, water park and hotel accommodation. Each room has a balcony and faces the water world. We stay in the innermost E area, but the shuttle bus is very convenient , every two or three minutes from 6:30-23:30 in the morning, stopping at the lobby, water world/shopping center and various accommodation areas of the hotel. Our E area is relatively close to the loudspeaker of the water park, and the door is very noisy, but the children seem to be not afraid of this noise, and they cheer along with the screams of the crowd, and once the door is closed, the sound can not be heard. Very good! ! This water world is charged separately. Our two mothers have no water and there are many people who are afraid that they will not be able to watch their children, so they did not go; but the hotel's free swimming pool is also fully enough for children to play with water, and there are warm children's pools and warm children's pools. , cold water children's pool, my baby is about 120 to the chest, the pool is very suitable for children, very humane water temperature, like! !
        There is a cafeteria next to the swimming pool. The breakfast is quite rich. The noodles are good and strong. Every time there is a queue, the beef yuba and mustard shredded pork are added by themselves. Chinese desserts, Western desserts, coffee, milk, juices... basically everything you can think of. We had a very early trip one day, and we had to leave at 6:50. This hall is open at 6:30. If we haven’t finished eating, we can pack the rest for the children to eat on the road! !
        In addition, the hotel can directly connect to the shopping center, and there are basically various brands to eat and shop, such as KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, KKV... Don't worry about forgetting to bring any daily necessities, you can basically buy them, and take-out is also very convenient!
        The only thing is that the hotel is a bit far from Chunxi Street, Jinli, and Kuanzhai Alley. I heard that there is a subway nearby but I haven't taken it before. For the convenience of taking children, I basically take a taxi! !

I didn’t fall asleep until 7 o’clock in the morning. Unexpectedly, the hotel rang the doorbell after 9 o’clock, but there was no response and I continued to press it. While pressing it, I asked if I needed laundry. Think clearly before staying in this hotel, oh yes, the hotel parking is not free, there is a charge

For those of us who don’t have time to come out, it is a good place to bring babies and self-healing.

Downstairs is a super large playground. After playing for a whole day, the children had so much fun ! The waiter also helped us deliver baby bathrobes, and a beautiful waiter in the breakfast restaurant the next day (forgot to ask his name) was very good at packing food for the children on the high-speed train for free, which was very caring! Must do it again this summer!

msg:Thank you very much Kelly at the front desk. When I first checked in, she patiently took out the guide map and explained the boundaries of the hot springs to me. Because I specially brought children to the soup pool, I am very concerned about this issue.
Considering the convenience of soaking in soup later, he also specially helped us upgrade our room and helped us to check out late for free, which was really considerate. Very happy to live in Intercontinental.
I was a little worried because I saw some bad reviews on the Internet before, but when I arrived, I actually felt that the staff were warm and considerate, the hygiene was clean, and the staff were very nice when eating breakfast. Winter may be the off-season, so many people, taking their children to play around the world for two days, are also on vacation.

Convenient floor area and floor, a fruit plate will be delivered every day, there are also children's toilet tools and small slippers in the room ~ very caring! Stayed for two days and two nights, very good experience! The interior of the hotel is full of flavor~
       After getting up and eating the hotel's rich "sea view buffet", I went to the ocean pool to play. I felt that it was not enough to play in the morning. After lunch, I would play in the hotel's soup pool. I can also visit Lotte Depar**ent Store in the evening, a full day! The children are very happy~ I also want to say that because the hotel is integrated with the business district, it is inevitable that there will be troubles of going the wrong way or not finding the entrance, so I have to thank Manager Liu Tao here for every second Reply to the information, let us have a 100% good experience when playing and staying~

msg:(Written in a special period: under the epidemic) In early November in Chengdu, I do not know whether it is late autumn or early winter. There was chill in the air. The leaves have turned yellow, and many people's green codes have also turned yellow. The wind and mood have a strong coolness.
Hi! intercontinental,
I am back again!
The enthusiasm of the staff makes me feel like I am home.
In this largest single building in Asia, under this huge glass dome, you finally temporarily forgot the cold, and you are finally surrounded by warmth everywhere.

     As always, after receiving the booking information, Mr. Jim, the concierge I trust and relied on, sent me a WeChat greeting. After confirming my arrival time at the hotel, I waited early at the hotel entrance and waited for my arrival. Next, when I saw a familiar face again, it was as kind as seeing a loved one. Mr. Jim has now become the ambassador of InterContinental Chengdu Global Center. There are pictures of him everywhere. His sincere smile is enough to infect everyone and to soothe the impetuous hearts of every guest after the trip. Yes, you just Like an angel!
       The housekeeping manager Sean contacted me to confirm the room preferences, floor, and size. Finally, I arranged the room according to my wishes and upgraded to an executive suite. I was satisfied with the area, the floor I was satisfied with, and the location I was satisfied with. Yu Jim is like an angel, Sean is like a cute elf, handsome in appearance, super execution, he is more like Doraemon, he can change magic in his pocket at any time to meet all your needs.
    Due to the epidemic, the hotel has upgraded its prevention and control measures. From entering the gate to checking in at the front desk, each floor has due diligence inspections and confirmations to ensure the safety of every visitor. Mr. Jim did his best to help me complete every step of the operation within the safe distance range, full of warmth.
     The suites are equipped with luxurious fabrics, furniture and facilities, all with strong yet elegant colors, European-style bold and a**ospheric layout, and natural and beautiful lines, giving every guest a luxurious and comfortable, supreme and noble experience.
The spacious room is based on white walls and elegantly decorated. It gives people a home environment that is truly pleasing to the senses, and makes people experience unprecedented warmth upon arrival. Luxurious mattresses and optional pillows ensure a comfortable sleep . The shower room chose the Hermès in the shower world-hansgrohe. The unique raindrop effect can really see the large water droplets tilting down from the top, just like the natural rain effect is like the rain falling from the sky, the air The voice makes people so calm, but it also inspires endless vitality. Coupled with high-end bathroom products BYREDO, it is enough to bring enough freshness, comfort and relaxation after a tiring day.
  Although Cherry was on vacation in the executive lounge, she thoughtfully made the best arrangements for me when she knew that I was going to check in. He reserved a place in the executive lounge and put small gifts on the seat early.
      Due to the epidemic, there are no diners in the cafeteria outside the lounge, and the swimming pool is also very quiet. Occasionally there are ripples in the breeze, bringing the breath and coolness of winter.
Only the red candles at the entrance of the lounge are still opening with enthusiasm, one by one, clusters after clusters, so bright and vigorous. In the current epidemic, they are silent and brave to cheer for China and Chengdu.
The executive lounge is used the most every time you stay in the hotel. This time I am honored to receive professional and considerate services from Caesar, the bar manager, Laura and Yolanda. Caesar is not tired of my various requirements, and will remember my preferences when I was in the lounge a week ago, and the time period when the lounge is not open, still in order to provide the convenience of dining. Yolanda is still so enthusiastic and caring about my needs everywhere. Although there are very few guests at the moment of the epidemic, their faces are always filled with warm and enthusiastic smiles. On this day of the beginning of winter, in the special period when the epidemic situation is closed and restricted, every sincere smile is enough to warm each of us. One's heart.
This is a special stay. Under the special background of the epidemic, you originally thought the journey would be a little bleak, lonely, and lonely. However, from checking in to leaving the hotel, every area, every time period, every contact with the hotel staff is full of warmth and care, and every hotel staff ensures that they are within the safe range and give the guests the greatest help and service. .
   If you haven't stayed here, if you haven't felt their warmth and professionalism, if you haven't experienced what it is to be truly at home, if you have stayed in other hotels, you still feel a little regretful. So after the epidemic, come to the InterContinental Hotel at the Global Center and bring your expectations, all your love.

It feels more suitable for taking children. There are a lot of fun in the world, and it’s more convenient to eat a lot. The room manager personally delivers it. Guopan came over, the attitude was very good 👍🏻, also helped me borrow a power bank, and also gave me breakfast! Will come again in the future! But one suggestion is that there is only a paper pump on the desk in the guest room, and there is no bathroom. You can also prepare a disposable bath bag for the epidemic. The most important thing is that the bath towels are a bit dark. You can change it. It will be perfect. NS!

msg:A disgusting hotel where people are serving dishes. All the staff I met in this hotel were very snobbish and petty people.
First of all, when you check in, tell you that the room is very, very far away. Breakfast is in the opposite direction, which is also very far away. Sure enough, I didn't restrain my curiosity and asked why, the waiter blinked Kazilan's big eyes and said, because the executive suite was nearby. Damn, it means you poor ghost, the room you booked is cheap, so I'm going to ask? I have stayed in so many hotels and haven't seen this kind of obvious snobbery, ha ha.
Secondly, line up for breakfast. If you don’t line up, you can just rush inside to get in. The honest people lined up at the door for a long time. There are no rules.
There are cards for ordering noodles and fried eggs on the table. When you want to order, just say, now there are so many people, go in line by yourself. Damn, then you should put the card away. What are you doing? What about disgusting people?
If you are in a hurry, just complain. The waiter just said so, so let's get it for you. Then, just wait, wait a lifetime and won't get it for you. Then you get angry, scold them loudly, and get it for you. Ha ha. I am a polite intellectual, and I was forced into a triad by this InterContinental Hotel.
Third, it is very noisy. Because the ocean world is outside the window, it is deafening every afternoon. Don't think about taking a break. It will be quiet only after the door closes at 7:30 in the evening.
Finally, I booked for three nights and checked out decisively for two nights. The deposit is the latest refund I have ever seen. It arrived the next day.
I don't recommend it. If you have money, you can book an executive suite. Maybe the service will be better.

The hotel gives a feeling of a Mediterranean town. There is a sightseeing car from the lobby to the accommodation, which is very convenient! The room is spacious, clean and tidy! There is a large balcony with a view, and the bathroom is divided into wet and dry areas, so it does not interfere with each other! The bed was very soft and clean, quiet at night, and slept well! Because the child is so tall, he also gave a breakfast. The breakfast is rich in variety and I can't taste it at all. There are also many amu*****t projects in Ocean Park, such as rafting, surfing, speed skating, big horns, hot tub, steaming...Some people have to wait in line and can't finish the day. There is a shopping mall next to the accommodation, which is full of food and commodities. It's really a pleasant trip for both body and mind.

Manager Ji Jun was very nice before check-in, contacted in advance, guided parking, checked in, and sent the children a mask doll warmly. 2. During this period of time, there are relatively few people. Big friends and children are so happy to play in the water. The water is clear. The hotel also has its own swimming pool. Sooner or later, you can take a relaxing swim. 3. The breakfast environment is comfortable, and it feels like a holiday in Sanya. There are many types of breakfast, the noodles are delicious, and the Western-style dim sum is also rich. 4. The room is low-key and luxurious, haha, I like the design of the large viewing balcony and bathroom, play with the water and come to a bubble bath, so cool!

Other aspects are really impeccable. Parking is very convenient, there is sufficient parking space in the underground parking lot, you need to pay extra, 24 hours 50 yuan, acceptable. Under the intimate arrangement of Vivian, our trip is perfect, thank you Vivian Gao!

msg:I often stay in hotels and have experienced many hotel services, but I want to say that the service of InterContinental exceeded my expectations! Mr. He is going to celebrate his wedding anniversary, and because he wants to play in Ocean Paradise, he has booked the Global Intercontinental Hotel. When checking in, I casually mentioned to the young lady at the front desk that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, but the young lady directly helped us upgrade the suite for free, which was great. Later, my husband and I went out for a stroll and returned to the room in the evening. I found the beautiful cakes and fruit bowls on the table. I was really happy. In a casual word, the hotel gave us a different surprise! I am really grateful to the beautiful young lady Emily for giving these unexpected surprises!
        I wanted to eat instant noodles, but accidentally knocked it over. The cleaning sister of the hotel did not have any impatience. She helped us clean up and further disinfected and decontaminated, which was very good! In many cases, the most basic and good embodiment of a hotel may lie in the clean elder sisters at the most basic level!
        There is still half an hour to check out, Ben has been packed, ready to check out! As a result, there was an emergency online meeting, which was estimated to be over after 13:00. I hurriedly contacted Emily. Miss sister helped us to adjust the application, which was delayed until two o'clock. We have more time to meet and check out! that's nice! And in the end it turned out to be a quick check out, and just left after giving the room card! So good!
        Beautiful environment, convenient shopping, convenient play! Choose Intercontinental next time!

The first night I slept, my chest was tight and I didn’t fall asleep. The next few days depended on Rhodiola. maintain. 2. Without the usual standards of InterContinental, the shower gel shampoo comes in large bottles, and there are no children's bath products. 3. When we checked in, there was no basket for changing towels, no trash cans, and no tissue boxes in the bathroom. 4. You can feel the obvious stuffiness when dining in the breakfast area of the hotel. 5. There is no ventilation in the toilet area, and the smell will disappear for a long time. The tiles next to the bathtub are broken and can be opened. It is easy to hit the child. 6. The staff at the entrance of the breakfast area told us that the breakfast for the child was 89 yuan, and we confirmed it, but the front desk charged us 98 yuan when we checked out. Generally speaking, one night in this hotel with children is enough. It is not easy to stay more. I stayed for three nights this time, and I depended on Rhodiola for the whole stay.

msg:The intercontinental of the Global Center still gives people a shocking feeling. It is very good in all aspects. I also need to mention that the driving friends are very impressed. The hotel will take the initiative to put sun shades on the cars parked in the parking lot. It is worthy of praise 👍 You can’t use your room card to use Paradise Island Ocean Park for free. You have to buy a ticket separately, which is very bad. After all, the room rate of nearly 1,500 yuan a day is relatively high in Chengdu, without Ocean Park. It's a bit unreasonable. I still remember that when this restaurant first opened, there were more than 700 holidays in one night, including double breakfasts, and unlimited use of Ocean Park. Unfortunately, those days are gone forever...

msg:I took the baby to Chengdu to play and chose for a long time. Choose this hotel. Just because there are so many things to play in the hotel, I don't want to walk the baby too hard. Also walked two babies.

Set executive deluxe room. In area a. Trust me. Certainly set in A
Area of the room. It will be too quiet. The room is very comfortable! Room service is also in place. I saw a one-and-a-half-year-old baby who immediately took the crib. The welcome fruit plate is a huge one. The fruit is very fresh. There is a children's water park in the hotel, which makes the children fun! And the front desk Jike is very good! Saw two dolls. Give late check-out until 2:30 in the afternoon. And the attitude is good! First choice with a baby.

When checking out, the room card will be handed over to the staff for quick check-out. It is suitable for the whole family to take a vacation, eating, drinking, playing and shopping. The Paradise Island Water World in the Global Center is so fun, staying in the hotel for five minutes to the scene! Will come again if there is a chance!

The high-rise building can see the hotel’s swimming pool, which is also a landscape. We took the kids to play in the water park. Breakfast is very human at half past ten! So suitable for our lazy people! Hotel buffet breakfast can also be packaged

msg:The hotel’s facilities are undoubtedly good, but there is room for improvement in management. I was very disappointed when I entered the room on the first day of check-in. After returning to the front desk, Miss Zhang helped to adjust the room, which made a big difference! thank you very much! Generally speaking, there is a big gap between the sanitary conditions and service levels of international five-star hotels. The hotel’s living, amu*****t, and dining layouts are a bit confusing, and many layouts have poor visual effects! In addition to playing, the surfing area can also be a hotel landscape, but now it may be considered to prevent people from escaping the ticket. Surrounded by the surroundings, the plane cannot be viewed. The first day to see the surfing area, I wanted to take a picture of the scenery, and the security was rude. Yelling!

旅拍體驗服務:避雷！太糟了，旅拍的預約的時候才説酒店這邊的門店裝修，不能拍，等到過幾天我們都走了才能約，我就問那店裡裝修不能户外麼？回答説也不行，反饋酒店方幫忙溝通，旅拍方才答應説要拍可以到他們市中心的門店，車程接近一小時，服務是衹拍5張照片不含其他任何東西，人間不值，而且既然是這種情況，就應該事先通知酒店方裝修不能拍攝的這幾天不要賣這個套餐了，但是他們沒有通知，酒店也是不知情的，所以這家旅拍很坑。

msg:時隔兩年再次入住這家酒店，因為地理位置不錯，離機場方便，很意外這次有專門的管家提前聯繫我，讓我回到了熟悉的感覺，這次入住管家專門給我安排了離大堂近的房間，房間很寬敞，獨立的陽台很舒服，洗漱用品也是我喜歡的味道，本次預訂含了下午茶，由於時間原因沒能用到，衹是給管家小周提了一嘴，就幫我安排了行政酒廊的晚間餐食，很是感謝，服務非常用心 ，帥哥調的雞尾酒也很好喝，瞬間沒了疲憊感，早餐也很豐盛，整體環境都非常棒，室外泳池也令人很享受，難得遇到水質這麼好的泳池，雖然衹入住了一晚，非常享受整個過程

🏨 管家服務很好。賓客經理小袁熱情周到，會提前聯繫我們，安排我們喜歡的高樓層和小孩的洗漱用品、床上用品。不管我是洲際會員或者攜程客人，都感受到小袁熱情的待客之道。
🍽️ 早餐種類多，比較新鮮。口味一般，可以加強服務主動性和口味多樣化。廚師需要及時補餐。
📝 建議：酒店快10年了，設施和設備老化嚴重，客房內充電插頭不夠用，也沒有USB。電視特別小，有的頻道雪花嚴重，真的太老了。雖然房間是地中海風格，但也略顯陳舊。吹風機建議換成戴森才可以與洲際匹配。按摩浴缸也有故障，不是很好用，建議多檢查。停車費太貴，如果開車來，相信大多數人跟我們一樣介意。
🛏️ 整體而言，各方面基本滿意。希望下次來的時候可以看到酒店硬件方面的翻新🆕

msg:已經是第四次入住天堂洲際酒店，體驗感還是非常棒，貼心的接送服務，感謝管家Jim，給孩子免費贈送的早餐，延遲到16:00的退房，每日清晨的問候。五一水上世界已開放，玩耍的人們還是比較多的，孩子非常開心，但水還是有些涼，玩的時間不能太長，之後到湯池泡泡還是非常舒服的。下次來成都還是會選擇入住的，也會推薦給朋友的。

 但是作為一個親子酒店和大型遊玩場所讓人無語的是居然沒有地下停車場和待客泊車的服務，到了那天是晚上22:30左右了，還下着小雨，小朋友已經睡着，結果停好車後，還要抱着小盆友在露天停車場淋着雨走了很長一段距離才到酒店！太具體了，且第二天走居然還收了66的停車費！你敢想，花了接近2k入住的酒店，沒有免費停車服務

雖是十年的老酒店，但基本裝潢都是石材，用料比較考究，維護得不錯。洲際的床品，布草品質還是能打的，但建議沙發等傢什，進一步提高清潔消毒頻率，這樣能帶來更好的入住感受。
尤其感謝管家王小燕，服務從入住前就開始了，下榻迎賓，驚喜小玩具，入住糕點水果，小童潔具用品，滿滿細節充分照顧了親子出行的各種需要，得到了一家老小的好評，得到了賓至如歸的感受。
總的來説，還會再來，期待下一次的入住。

設施：非常陳舊，廁所門和衞生巾門無法同時打開，空調開最小風速聲音也非常大，晚上睡覺開空調噪音，不開空調濕熱。房間很小，呈狹長走勢，一盞大大大水晶吊燈不當不正的吊在層高不高的房間裏，非常詭異的設計；竟然沒有夜燈！廊燈控制到床尾的筒燈，因此睡覺時衹能選擇一片黑暗；廁所燈也是要麼全開，要麼全關；廁所和卧室的玻璃牆用90年代的百葉窗遮擋。
總之，感覺是山寨洲際。這個洲際是給洲際集團抹黑的吧。

msg:入住感覺不錯，表揚Shirley小胡幫忙解決問題，還有寶寶晚上吐了弄臟地面，幫忙搞衞生的保潔阿姨。
很喜歡百瑞德這個品牌，更願意選擇洲際
風軒出品還不錯，300買500券很划算，點贊
唯一需要注意是員工開電瓶車注意安全，小心急剎
小小建議是員工對價格項目及周邊不是特別熟悉，可以加強培訓，有問有答，客户體驗感更好

msg:這次出差住在環球中心的洲際酒店，可能是我住過的五星酒店裡最差的體驗了，首先説好的洲際的服務倒是沒什麼問題，是五星的標準，早餐也比較有特色，但是我接下來我要説的就是為什麼差啦，房間隔音實在是差的不能再差，隔壁房間説話都能聽見，第一晚我11點半到，早上四點多隔壁房間大聲説話就吵醒了，跟客服反饋，處理到是很及時，第二天給我換了一個房間説是隔音會好，結果12點隔壁一對野鴛鴦又吵醒，氣的一度想報警。白天酒店根本沒法呆，不知道是培訓還是什麼，再加上回音，很吵。第三點也要特別提醒自駕的人注意，這個酒店是沒有停車場的，全部要自費。

msg:入住前：管家Sharon 蔣 提前聯繫跟我溝通好了房型和入住時間，這個體驗非常好，非常感謝她耐心細緻的關照。
入住過程：説實話，一進到這個大廳我還是被震撼到了，如此巨大的前台大廳我還是頭次見到。入住過程也很絲滑，前台的服務人員很快速高效的幫我辦理的入住。唯獨差一點的是，整個大堂的面積這麼大，指示卻不夠清晰。給我的語言指引也不夠，導致我找a區，半天沒有找到。很可惜，我希望這樣高水平的酒店後續可以安排專人指引或者是考慮一下更明確的指示牌。
房間內部：房間內部可以用豪華大氣，宮廷奢華來形容，整個房間的設施很完善，能滿足所有住宿需要，讓人覺得非常舒服。陽台上看到整個環球城內部的景觀也很漂亮。唯獨就是設施稍顯老舊，走廊上有些破損的漆麪也沒有及時得到修復。
本次太忙，其他的還沒有來得及體驗，希望下次再入駐時，能夠再體驗一下他們的自助餐，以及去那個水上世界的遊樂活動吧。

工作人員拿私人電話聯繫，上來就是直呼姓名，也不報自己的單位，還以為是推銷騷擾電話，缺乏禮儀培訓，這跟洲際酒店招牌相去甚遠。

辦理入住的過程很順利，高效便捷，房間環境令人舒心，隨處可見的工作人員，諮詢問問題都很是熱情。
早餐的種類豐富，選擇性比較多，有當地特色，也有適合大眾口味的食物，住了兩晚，總體來説相當滿意。
遊樂場地，水很乾凈，在房間可以看見，湯池每天早上都是放的新水，遊樂設施繁多，孩子玩的很盡興，泡在水裡根本不想出來😄😄
重點説一下，退房的時候，因自己原因，遺漏了衣服，小袁很是熱心，幫我尋找，並且第二天就郵寄給我，這裏必須誇一下，大家可以放心沖，我還會去的😉😉

msg:春節前購買了888的酒店套餐，實際使用情況一言難盡，還被要求過來五星好評，那我就不得不得吐個槽了：
1. 酒店員工培訓極其不到位，我們晚上十點到酒店，因為地方太大了，錯誤地走到了商場，商場沒有任何指示標誌，商場的保安和兩位保潔都給指了完全相反的方向，終於找到酒店大堂以後，門口的門僮居然不知道自家酒店地下車庫的入口，還需要走過去再找一個保安問路，第二天自助餐的服務員全程在做滑鏟武打和花式甩抹布的動作，感覺就是個剛剛上崗的寒假臨時工，把工作當遊樂場所。
2. 作為酒店最大賣點的室內玩水樂園是不開放的，請問室內玩水樂園在冬季不開放，等到夏季，你們還有什麼競爭力嗎？酒店前台説海洋樂園是不開的，但是我們開了海洋球。好吧，海洋球…
3. 房間內洗手池的冷水出水量非常小，熱水正常，非常燙手；馬桶就是普通馬桶，上水非常慢，聲音巨大，而不是宣傳頁寫的智能馬桶；淋浴間積水嚴重，十分鐘以後就流到了衞生間的地面上。
4. 酒店付費停車，6員每小時，我一共花了72，在成都算是天價停車費了，個人覺得非常不值。酒店説為了彌補停車不免費，把房間內的六瓶可樂免費贈飲，關鍵是，這個贈飲是你們當一個權益放在888套餐裏賣的呀！！！搞不懂這個酒店套餐算不算價格欺詐，大家都去直接訂房六百就好了，不要買這個套餐，沒有任何意義！歡迎水果還是第二天打電話才送來的…
4. 酒店的游泳池沒有救生員，我們中午11點到11點半，遊了半小時，才姍姍來遲一個工作人員，在我的強烈要求下，勉強坐在了救生員的位置，穿着全副武裝的外套和皮鞋。
5. 非要説一下亮點的話，酒店管家主動添加微信，詢問入住要求和時間，免費添加了一個小童自助餐，響應詢問很及時，態度禮貌，算是唯一的一個亮點。聯繫我的酒店管家叫姜學，如果不是他的工作，我覺得這家酒店，我會毫無保留的打一分。
總之就是性價比超級低，員工服務意識低下，設施陳舊，不值得一來。

服務：酒店服務很好，提前一天就打電話來問有什麼需求，事先做好了準備。
環境：非常哇塞
衞生：就一般般，酒店比較舊了，應該翻新裝修。房間櫃子都有壞的。
目前有個問題就是停車場不屬於酒店管理，得另外繳費。一晚上就是五十。

【早餐】酒店泳池前的餐廳是正版的，在C區房前攔截客人的早餐廳是盜版的。意思就是：早餐半路攔截的，説前面人多，讓你在這邊吃，就是個大忽悠，菜品少，服務跟不上。總結：可以設定兩個早餐廳，但是必須保證菜品的一致性，明顯菜品少很多，環境差一些。
【房間服務】阿姨人很好，很專業。
【房間設施】達到5星標準，乾淨，床品挺舒服。
【遊樂設施】水上樂園相當好玩，可能是暑假旺季，對住店客人並沒有很好的優惠票價，其他的還是很不錯的，夜場的電音show也很震撼！
非常值得一遊！！！

衞生：衞生不用説，非常棒👍🏻特別要表揚，這次帶了長者一起出門，對房間的衞生都特別滿意、讚不絕口

服務：服務永遠不會讓人失望，尤其禮賓Jim不光態度好，還幫我們一家和朋友一家解決了所有可能遇到的問題，給我們這趟跨年之旅錦上添花。


設施：浴缸很大，淋浴可以帶孩子一起洗澡，大小噴頭是分開的，而且乾濕分離以後的浴室依然空間很大。洗手池有兩個，家裡人多也不用擔心洗漱需要排隊。

環境：讓人意外的是海洋世界沒有水，可能是因為冬天天氣冷的緣故。不過原來的場地現在是特別大的海洋球樂園，遛娃一整天不用換地方，提前一天買票還有優惠，入住的客人可以憑房卡九折

首先酒店環境，衞生，服務樣樣各方面我都給五星好評，這是你們應該得的，如果可以的話，我給管家Cherry打9分，還有一分是希望你繼續加油💪不要太驕傲哈哈。免早和送水果是我房間完全沒有的條件，而且送來的水果既新鮮，品種也多，還特別甜。
再説説早餐:
我個人覺得酒店的早餐可以再提升一個檔，水果區品種有點少，而且今早的芒果全是壞的。（這裡有點小失望）感覺比送的水果差得太遠太遠。其實早餐也可以提供炒菜的，有三四個含蔬菜即可。
酒店房間:
酒店房間空間比一般房間可能會大兩三平，洗漱用品大人小孩都分開的挺好！如果房間沒有小朋友的可以請客服送喲。
祝大家旅途愉快！

msg:雖然酒店是2014年開業的 沒有智能家居 在周邊來説也算是價格很高的了 但是床品很舒服，衞生很好，安保也很好，裝修也是正經5星級+，酒店的自助中規中矩，但是心情整個會很好，氛圍就像是去海邊度假，在炎熱的夏天來玩還是很推薦的！

這是我第三次來了，每次來成都都喜歡住這，服務很好，入住有分配的管家，會從大堂送你去房間，我的管家Tom-Liu很認真負責

我來主要是為了玩水上樂園，酒店本身有游泳池、熱水池也很好玩，就算不想去水上樂園也可以就躺在酒店泳池邊上擺爛。洲際本身都比較商務，但是這個洲際就偏度假。住在這裏很方便，不僅是水上樂園，還有商場，也不是非得吃酒店的東西就很方便。

説一下費用吧，房間1000，自助350+，早餐不要訂酒店的時候定，前台價格89比較划算，水上樂園門票也是不要在房費裏定，憑房卡是9折門票-169，最划算的是攜程直接買雙人票100左右2人但是要提前定不然沒有。買泳具還是去水上世界門口買便宜一點，酒店健身房買貴很多。可以在水上樂園租電動水槍和浮水器，我們傻乎乎自己帶水槍……

總體來説，度假很推薦，比我們三月去海南還好玩！下次還要來

配置設施就不用提了，總之是不會後悔的選擇。

果然是洲際
還是我國內住過的體驗最好的洲際

設施：新。有特色，歐式地中海風格建築，一層門口隨手一拍就是聖託里尼

衞生：乾淨整潔，本來擔心房間都在室內成都濕度又大可能會有黴味兒，但是絲毫沒聞到

環境：不是一般的高大上，帶娃住了2晚3天連環球中心門都沒出過……要不是因為五一房間太貴還能繼續宅在裏面


服務：服務員熱情有禮貌，特別感謝前台袁必遠，入住還給孩子送了小禮物

房間景色也非常好，下次有機會再帶孩子來成都還是首選

服務：服務是最大問題：預訂的高樓層豪華房沒有了，服務員居然問能不能安排低樓層的。問題是高樓層售賣價格是比低樓層貴。酒店沒房衹有給客人升級，哪有降級的，聞所未聞，可以説違反消費者權益保護法的。衹此一項就夠得上差評。後來經費勁協調才解決。另外，酒店和海洋樂園是分開的，住店退房後，退房當天是不能在海洋樂園享住店折扣的，這點也不合理。很多客人是退完房才去樂園。

msg:Sensationell!!! Das Hotel befindet sich in einer Shopping Mall! In einer Dimension die man sich bildlich nicht vorstellen kann. Der gesamte Aufenthalt war sensationell. Wir wurden herzlich von einem Englisch sprechenden Team empfangen. Haben einen Gutsein für die Hotel Bar bekommen, ein kostenloses Upgrade des Zimmers in der Nähe vom Hotel Restaurant für das Frühstück mit unseren Kindern. Die Auswahl im Restaurant war sehr vielfältig und lecker. Es befindet sich ein Aquapark im Gebäude, der für die Hotelgäste vergünstigt ist. Wunderschön für Kinder. Auch auf die Nachfrage für ein spät Check-out wurde zugestimmt und ohne Probleme ermöglicht. Wir werden sicherlich noch einmal kommen. Danke
