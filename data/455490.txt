One complaint. In the morning I really had to rush to get back from exercising for breakfast before closing at 10:30. When I walked in at 10:10 staff started cleaning the name tags off buffet etc. The cleaner was even mopping around my feet while I was eating. 
People come here to have a holiday. I understand the staff have to do their jobs etc but breakfast should be a more peaceful experience. Previously I had the same issue with the breakfast.

msg:So many more positives that I would definitely stay here again - but there are a couple things that could be improved. Here are the good bits:
Location: super close to Yalong bay and easy to get Didi to other places 
Service: rooms cleaned everyday, 24 hour reception, 24 hour resort transport, awesome breakfast, free shuttle bus to beach
Cleanliness: all good!
Amenities: warm swimming pool with loungers, all the usual things you would expect in the room.
Here’s the stuff to improve:
Half of the main swimming pool was closed the whole duration - this was not mentioned when booked. 
The swimming pool is open until 11:00pm which means if you’re in building one, you will hear kids screaming until 11:00pm.
The beach bus is super old and broken - the ac doesn’t work and half the time I felt like we were going to break down! Also, there is no service between 11:30 and 14:00.
Some areas of the resort/villas are still under construction.

msg:The hotel is situated in the right place, close to every activity place in Yalong beach. 
They have one good amenity…the transport to the room and administrative office. But

1. The room has a very old muggy smell. Like it was in a wet environment without the widows been open. 
2. Our bathroom smelled of urine for the entire period of our stay. We reported the leak in the toilet, but even after “the fix”, the toilet leaked and was thus the source of the urine smell. 
3. Broken soap bar holder, broken toilet paper holder. 
4. Fridge takes 20 hours to cool any food inside. 
5. The shower switch didn’t work, we had to jostle it ourselves to interchange between shower modes.
6. The cleaning service was bad, they never changed our sheets during our whole stay. Even when they cleaned, they didn’t clear up the table. We had left used cups and found them exactly where we left them. We left some towels on the floor and found them right there when we returned in the evening. We even decided on our second day to call them to clean. But even when they cleaned, the same mop used to clean the urine in the bathroom, was used to clean the rest of the room without being washed. In essence, the entire room smelled worse after cleaning. 
7. The phone to call the lobby is in the toilet! Who does that? So that means only the person in the toilet can call… shocking. 
8. They didn’t change the towels on the last day. 
9. The hotel didn’t provide an iron.
10. They supplied us with a tiny gown for our daughter even though we specified her age when applying for the room. 
11. The instructions for the geyser are only in Chinese, so we had to endure cold water for our first night.

It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the beach. The hotel is also close to the Tropical Forest Park (3km by DiDi).
The breakfast was delicious and the room was very clean. There is a bathtub on the balcony which is great!

msg:This is one of the most beautiful properties I’ve stayed in in Sanya. Gorgeous, tropical, palm filled walkways, palapa gazebos and bridges that span koi filled rivers and ponds … I honestly felt I had been transported to Bali. The property is humongous and consists of an impressive lobby of dark wood, and many private villas all decorated in South East Asian decor. My massive room with its impressive view of the jungle below, was at the back of the property (reachable by walking or shuttle cart), on the 6th floor of one of the two tall buildings. It was lovely to soak at night in the December air in the private balcony tub and then crawl into the very comfortable queen bed with its nice linens and feather pillows. Another great feature of this room is that it had a small kitchenette with a full sized fridge and freezer and separate sink. This came in really handy as most restaurants (there is one on the property) were about a 10-15 minute walk away and I  spent most of the time at the property near the pool having stayed at the beach a few days prior to this. The pool itself is also gorgeous, well maintained and equipped with very comfortable loungers situated under shaded palapas among palm trees.The only downside of this hotel I would say is a not-so-nice smell of sulphur (?) that comes and goes depending on where you are on the property. While I don’t think it would prevent me from coming again, it’s definitely something to be aware of if you’re scent sensitive. Thank you to the friendly helpful staff at the front desk for an enjoyable stay at Stony Brook!

The only one thing what I don’t like is hotel it’s quite old and has a old smell, so for me if they had a smell killer in the rooms would be very nice. Room is big, hotel workers clean room every day, also I love the bath in the balcony. Swimming pool is nice.  
If you need to do makeup take a mirror with you, light in the room don’t let you to see yourself well. About rest in Sanya: I advise to you to rent a bike, because everything is not close to each other. Water in this beach is warmer then in another near beaches .

msg:Most cost effective stay on Yalong bay! You'll get same high level of service as usual for this area, but prices are relatively low! The hotel itself is situated little bit deeper in a tropical green, therefore it has some kind of calm 'Bali' vibe. And if you want to go to the beach, there is a 5 minutes transfer each half an hour.

🚕🚎🚌 It is super easy to get here on taxi either from Sanya airport, or from Yalong train station. Or you can take a public bus to enjoy scenery along the beautiful road from Sanya. 

🏡 The room is spacious and comfortable. It is also quite private. We had a bath on balcony, and it was a joyful and relaxing experience to take a hot bath, while it was heavy tropical rainfall outside.

🥪 Breakfast is really delicious, we were surprised by the good quality of brewered coffee. Not only Chinese, but also Western dishes are present here, so everyone will be able to find smth suitable for themselves. And if you order late night waimai you can call a hotel car to pick you up and take it on the main gate.

🏊🏻 One more thing, worth mentioning - is a swimming pool with a good 1,4m depths, which is suitable for swimming routine.

Summing up, amazing place, which is absolutely worth visiting for this price! Hope to return here in nearest future!

The hotel is by the mountainside overlooking the  ocean. Food has great choices although very few western options. Close to the shopping places and the covid testing place is just 11rmb taxi ride away. It feels like you're in a jungle with how lush the environment is, landscape is beautiful. I love the big swimming pool as well. My husband and I had a massage (1 hour essential oils) and it was very good. We stayed here for 6 nights.

The resort service is great ; the workers are helpful; shuttles to take you around the resort . The rooms are abit out dated and can do with some modern decor ; the beds were comfortable . There is a restaurant at the resort which only provides Chinese food no western food for foreigners so you may have to order food from outside .

About a 12 minute walk to the beach from the reception area, but they no longer offer a private beach section.

msg:Fantastic place, we loved it!
Located not too far from Yalong bay beach (about 15 min walk), close to the shopping malls, and the best food market! Plus very reasonably priced compared to other hotels in the area. The territory is huge and green, the service is outstanding, we never waited a minute for the electric car to take us to our building. Overall the personnel was always friendly and eager to help (despite the fact that nobody there could speak English). The room was very spacious with a super comfy bed, great shower and a balcony with an amazing view on the green territory and Yalong bay. There was a bathtub on the balcony which we never even used because the pool was so great (and almost always empty), so we ended up soaking there both day and night (it is open till 11 pm) only going to the beach in the afternoon (the waves were too big anyway). Water bottles refilled daily, the room service was also very good. Breakfast was a very good choice of Chinese food and the common European options (toasts, pastry, cereal, coffee, salad bar). However, then it was changed a bit: salad/fruit bar, pastry and cereal were still there but the rest we had to order from the menu. Anyway it was enough! We also rented a car in Sanya and we were able to park it there in the hotel with no extra charge. The only thing was the WIFI, quite slow and not always I could connect. But the rest was outstanding. Would love to come back there again! Thank you!

msg:This resort is a hidden gem; nestled in the lush green tropical forest with the ocean a short stroll away. Its a great escape from the hustle and bustle and you could literally laze around for days at the resort. The check in was quick and then you’re whisked away by the battery car to your guest room. My view overlooked the pool and garden and I loved soaking under the stars in the balcony bath tub. There’s battery cars at your request that will take you to the lobby and a shuttle that takes you to the beach/shopping centre. The breakfasts were great and they switched up the menu every day. There’s a bus stop nearby that I used to go to Tianya Haijiao, Sanya Bay and the forest park (bus 25)Stony Brook Villa has my heart 🤲🏽👏🏽🥳😍🤌🏽

The bathtub needs to be serviced as we struggled releasing the water (the plug was difficult to turn). Our key cards wouldn't work and we constantly had to get them rechecked at the hotel on a daily basis.

The swimming pool is huge, clean and amazing. The environment is peaceful and surrounded by a lot of trees. There is free shuttle service every hour to the beach as well as free shuttle service from the beach back to the hotel.

 the villa is beautiful with stone floors. there is a full size fridge and freezer, washing machine, stove and oven and sink in the kitchen. but no crockery/cutlery.

the rooms are spacious,beautiful bath and comfortable beds. the air conditioner and fans work well after some time (the rooms are large and need time to cool off)

the pool is much bigger than expected, with a small covered lapa.

the water was clean and warm.

there isn't a convenience store on site but delivery was fine, you just have to collect it at one of the gates or at reception.

there is a bus to the beach from the lobby every half hour but it's only about a 10min walk away.

the beach has a number of seafood restaurants and a burger King and Starbucks. the beach looked nice but it was raining when we were there so can't comment really.

the staff were patient and efficient.

wonderful stay and would stay again despite the relatively long  walk to the beach.

Stony Brook Villa is a wonderful hotel, built on huge grounds, it’s so quiet and beautiful, full of trees, water ways and beautiful buildings. Just walking around is a pleasure. The swimming pool is very big, clean and quiet. The rooms are 60+ meter square, with very comfortable beds and nicely furnished. The walk to the beautiful Yalong bay takes less than 15 minutes. I would like to mention the exceptional service, especially from the manager Mr. Steven Chen. Mr. Chen went out of his way by upgrading our room to the deluxe sea view one, let us checkout at 4pm, bringing us extra water to the room, gave us a present and assisted in everything, all the time. The breakfast was also fresh and relatively varied. A big thanks to the hotel and Mr. Steven Chen and cannot wait to return! ❤️

The swimming pool gazebos reek of urine, most disgusting. I guess staying in a villa can be nice but for this price why not get a room or even a villa at a reputable hotel? I would refund the very first day but there was no such option. It’s far from the sea and the shuttle buses are not regular. Wasn’t the best yet not the worst experience.

I can clearly see squirrels running around and birds chirping on the balcony. The 2nd floor is actually cleaner than the 7th floor. You can see the sea and distant mountains on the 7th floor. The only difference is that the smell of humidity is very strong, and you can't dry it even if you open the window. It's a bit inconvenient to call for a shuttle bus to the lobby door when you go out, but the speed is very fast and the scenery on the road is nice. They are all quiet villas. I lived there for a few days before I found that there was a forest park behind me. I actually saw a yellow monkey. Overall, it's very good. I love this place and will continue to come here

There is a shuttle bus to pick you up. If you want to go from the room to the lobby, you can call the shuttle bus, which is available 24 hours a day and arrives quickly. The room smells very musty! So strong that we decided to go to the forest park temporarily in order to stay in the room for less time. The facilities in the room are relatively old, and the shower room is very simple. There is only a small swimming pool in the hotel. When booking the room, it said that there would be welcome fruit and turndown. The welcome fruit was delivered only after we called the front desk to ask for it ourselves, and the turndown was not delivered if we didn't ask for it. Overall, the hotel facilities are very average. There is a gloomy feeling of living in the mountains with no other people around. The service is not particularly good, which is different from what I saw in the comment area before checking in.

There really is no harm without comparison, especially during this trip to Hainan, I went to several places and stayed in several five-star hotels. The experience and comfort at Shixi Villa were the best in all aspects, making both children and adults happy. , the breakfast is also the richest and most delicious, and the swimming pool and children's water village children's playground are also the richest and most fun. In short, our family likes it very much. We don't want to come out after spending a whole day in the swimming pool. The water in the swimming pool is very clean and clear. The hotel's access to the beach is also very convenient. There are frangipani trees around the swimming pool, which is a good way to avoid sunburn. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic and will not make you uncomfortable. They are just right. This year I still made an appoin**ent with the hotel’s photo shooting box. I still produced great results and communicated with the photographer very happily. I took some scenes that I didn’t take last year and bought all the negatives because I really like it. In short, Shixi Villa is back again It left us with wonderful memories of our trip to Sanya! Special thanks to Xiao Zhao and A Liang for their help!

Especially looking at the large villas in front of me, I concluded that I was too poor.
Will come next time
I just hope that the service staff at the front desk can strengthen their service awareness. They look unhappy and ask questions and answers. I hope they can strengthen their service awareness.
It was the first time a boy called me and said he didn't know anything. He told me that he was new here. When I got to the front desk, a girl looked unhappy, which affected my image.

You have to call first and then wait for the bus. Even when you go out, if you don't go out or eat all day, it's nice to stay in the hotel.

You must choose to live upstairs; 2. The community is very large, and there is a shuttle bus. The shuttle bus comes very quickly. The hotel lobby is a 15-minute walk from Yalong Bay. There is a free shuttle bus to the beach in the morning and afternoon. It takes about half an hour to go there, and we usually miss it when we come back. We either walk back or take a taxi back; 3. It is very quiet to live here, and it is together with the private villas. The community environment is very beautiful. It is really a blessing to be woken up by the sound of birds in the morning. It is really suitable for living here.

There are relatively few sockets, there are no sockets at the bedside, and most of the sockets are occupied by hotel facilities. Otherwise, there is no space to insert it. The hotel said that the communication equipment was temporarily damaged, but I didn't see the phone at all. To contact the hotel, I had to dial an external line. You need to take a battery car from the lobby to the room, which is a bit far. Because there is a villa area in front of the hotel room, you have to bypass the villa. But the electric car is quite fast. Just call or go downstairs and wait. By the way, the hotel also has a dryer, which is nice.
Hygiene: Overall it's OK, but because it's old and has previous style design, there may be some marks on the bedside and the like. The bedding is OK, as are towels and the like.
Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is good, with garden views and an outdoor swimming pool. It is very close to Yalong Bay and Baihua Valley. There is a scheduled shuttle bus to the beach, just wait for the bus at the scheduled time.

msg:I must give a five-star praise. I stayed at Shixi Villa on the last night of this trip, which marked a successful end to my trip. The elder brother who greeted guests in the parking lot at the front desk was warm and thoughtful, and he was very flexible in handling things, which made me feel at home. When I arrived, there were no seats in the parking lot, but he helped me check in the car and guided me to park in the underground garage near the check-in building. The room is very big and my son is very satisfied. The breakfast is also very rich. I made an appoin**ent with the eldest sister of the health care depar**ent to do a back spa for me. It was really comfortable and we talked for a long time. Although I only booked a hotel for one night, I also gave away the tickets and travel photos of Areca Valley. The travel photographers are very nice. They helped me coordinate the time and took the photos very well, drawing a successful conclusion to my trip. Although it cost money to buy photos in the end, I think it is very worthwhile! I have to say that the sea in Yalong Bay is the most beautiful, and it is a hot day, so it is right not to let everyone pay for it in vain! Because it was an evening flight, the front desk of the hotel also helped me with late check-out, and finally pulled a sling. I got a call from the hotel as soon as I drove out of the hotel. The room attendant found it and reported it in time. When I went back to pick it up, the clothes were gone It has been bagged and labeled. They are really warm and thoughtful. Next time I come to Yalong Bay, I hope to have the opportunity to stay in Shixi Villa and see them again. The swimming pool is huge, and the swimming pool in front of Building No. 2 is 0.6 meters high, which is very suitable for children to play. The swimming pool in front of Building No. 1 is 1.4 meters deep, and the depth of the swimming pool is also suitable. After a day, it was a pleasant and relaxing day. There are also Bohou Village Night Market and Liupan Night Market nearby. It is very convenient to go shopping and eat at night.

msg:The hotel is located in Yalong Bay, not far from the seaside. You can go shopping in the Baihua Valley next to it in the evening. In the villa area, the environment is beautiful and pleasant. Since it has been open for a long time, the room facilities are slightly outdated, the breakfast is rich in variety, and there is a small supermarket next to the restaurant for convenient shopping. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to and from the beach and Baihua Valley, which is worth recommending.

msg:1. There is a 24-hour shuttle bus from each building to the lobby, and there is a bus for a phone call. The little buddies are very hard. Strong sense of service. 2. To go to the beach, you need to change to a silver-gray van, which runs every half an hour. The return timetable has been extended by 10 minutes. 3. There are public baths on the destination beach. The water is very shallow, the deepest point is about 1.4 meters. very safe. 4. Takeaways can only be picked up at the entrance of the lobby or from the takeaway cabinet in the underground parking lot at the entrance of the villa area. 5. The room is big, fresh and clean. There are rare large Siemens refrigerators. Furniture dark brown, Southeast Asian style. 6. The cleaning aunt is serious and responsible. If you don't want to clean the room, remember to hang "Do Not Disturb". 7. The big swimming pool is really big. 8. There are many green plants, but no mosquito bites. Feel free to go shopping at night. 9. I often see cute little geckos, there are also in the room, please don't hurt them. Regardless of them, they will hide themselves. Summary: The most satisfying thing is the room. The sea view room has been upgraded, overlooking the sea from the mountains, overlooking Yalong Bay, with a 90-degree distant sea view. Suggestions to the hotel: 1. Replace the beach shuttle bus with a sightseeing bus. The van is too stuffy and rustic. 2. Replace the carpet in the elevator with a Southeast Asian style, which will improve the check-in experience.

It will be cooler if you live in summer, because there are many green plants and no sun. You can go to the swimming pool to play in the water, it is also very close to the beach, and there are shuttle buses. The buffet breakfast changes every day. This is recommended, and you won't get tired of it. Backed by the mountain and facing the sea, the view from the balcony is full of green and blue, which is really beautiful. It is a hotel that I would like to stay in next time.

You need to take a shuttle bus from the lobby to the accommodation area. It takes about ten minutes to walk. The shuttle bus is more convenient and available on call; it is also relatively close to the beach Far, the hotel has a shuttle bus to the seaside, at 6 o'clock at the latest, it costs about 10 yuan to take a taxi by yourself;

There are currently 2 swimming pools open in the entire hotel, one for adults, with a water depth of about 1.4 meters; one for children, with a water depth of 0.4 meters, children are still very happy to play in the water; but there are no other children's playgrounds, if you bring children to play, it is recommended Seaside or special parent-child hotels;

The internal facilities of the room are relatively old, and the shower room and toilet are quite small; a few days ago, I lived on the second floor of Building 2, which should be directly above the restaurant. There is a small exhaust pipe outside the window, and it can Smelled a strong kitchen smell, I couldn't bear it on the last day and moved to the 6th floor;

If you drive by yourself, after checking in at the front desk, you can drive in from another entrance of the hotel, and then park in the underground parking garage. Let’s talk about the facilities. The advantage of the courtyard room on the first floor is that you don’t have to wait for the elevator, you can walk in by yourself, but there are also disadvantages. There are many vegetation around, the light is not good, and you can’t open the windows for ventilation. Secondly, the service needs to be optimized, and there is only one room The telephone landline is in the toilet, and it is broken when you pick it up. You can only contact the front desk and the shuttle bus through your mobile phone; the breakfast service is relatively rich, and the buffet has many varieties, which is very appetizing. In short, if the full score is 5 points, you can score 4.3 points, and 0.7 points need to work hard on service and hardware. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel for the service it provided us.

msg:I checked in at 9 o'clock in the evening. There were several uncles and aunts at the front desk who were checking in. There were two staff members. In front of the first staff member was a sign for inquiries. I was waiting in front of it. My uncle and aunt waited for about five minutes to check in. When it was my turn, another guest came behind me and checked in at the first staff member... The room I checked in was on the first floor, and it was really not soundproof at all. Noisy, a group of people came back after 11 o'clock in the evening and quarreled for more than half an hour. The next morning, the sound of cars and various sounds of walking and closing the door were really speechless. I didn’t sleep well. I got up to swim the next morning. My swimming trunks were wet. I was looking for a bag in the room. I went to the aunt who cleaned the room to ask for a bag, but they didn’t give me a garbage bag.... After checking out, I went to the front desk to ask if there was any bag, and the front desk answered They ignored me and questioned me saying that there was a bag in the room, and I ignored it when I said there was no room... I returned the room card to the front desk and left. After half an hour, I still haven't checked out for me. I have to wait in another hotel It took a long time to get on the information, really speechless...

msg:I stayed in this hotel for a total of four days. If you want to stay for a few more days, it is recommended to book a few more days on Tuesday and Wednesday. The price of these two days is cheap.
Transportation: It is very close to Baihua Valley, Yalong Bay Forest Park, and the beach. It takes three minutes to drive to the beach.
Hygiene: Very clean. Although the furniture is old, the cleaning is still clean. The bedding is a bit damp, but it will be fine after a while. We live on the second floor
Environment: I really like the environment of the hotel. Let me talk about the room first. The room is large, mainly dark-colored furniture, very textured and comfortable, especially the balcony window view. A big coconut tree comes into view. You can see the coconut up close. Tree. Besides, outside the room, there is a hill behind and the villa area in front. There are about three or four rows of private villas that have been sold. There are many beautiful tropical green plants on all the roads. It is recommended to get up in the morning and take a stroll. The leaves and the sound of birds make you feel People are very comfortable, and the cool wind in this season is also very comfortable. Downstairs there is a swimming pool swimming pool, which is not constant temperature. It is recommended to enter the water around 3:00 pm. The water temperature is still a bit cold. The swimming pool has gazebos and lounge chairs, and the overall environment is very comfortable. The hotel as a whole is very quiet, suitable for rest, and the sound insulation is okay. There are Siemens refrigerators and Daikin air conditioners in the room. We haven’t used them this season, so I won’t say whether they are easy to use. Maybe there is a water heater, and there will be a little noise when running , I'm a light sleeper and it didn't bother me.
Service: You can directly call the shuttle bus to go to the front desk or pick up food, and you will be downstairs in two or three minutes. It is very convenient. In fact, it takes a few minutes to walk without calling a car. There are regular shuttle buses to the beach. During the period, bath towels or band-aids were needed to be sent to the room by the service staff quickly. It is more cost-effective to buy breakfast with Ctrip directly. It is more than 100 to buy directly at the hotel, and more than 30 to Ctrip. The breakfast is very good. The buffet has both Chinese and Western dishes. The dishes are different every day. The taste is very good. The ingredients are not discounted. The dining environment Also very good and great value.

msg:I finally know what it feels like to be in a hotel that costs thousands of dollars but doesn’t have high ratings.
First of all, the advantage: free transfer to the beach (you can get to the nearby beach in two or three minutes, and you can take the bus whenever you want. (This may be the only advantage I think)
Facilities: Because it is a villa area, it is built in the mountains. The days are hot and the nights are dark. The inside of the room was also very dark.
1. The biggest bug is that the room we live in is on the upper and lower floors. There is only one shower room and toilet, located upstairs. There are two single beds downstairs. If you need to take a shower or use the toilet, you have to go up stairs, which is very inconvenient. Going up and down stairs at night can also affect the sleep of your co-residents.
2. The lighting control is not convenient (because the toilet is on the second floor and we all slept on the second floor). It is impossible to turn off the lights on the first floor while lying on the bed on the second floor. There are no charging sockets on either side of the bed. I turned on the electricity after unplugging the bedside lamp.
The double bed is very small. Since there are only two people on this trip, there is nothing except two beds on the first floor. So they all slept upstairs.
3. Travel is inconvenient! You need to take a shuttle bus from the front desk to the room! five minutes! If you need to go out for something, call the shuttle bus number. In addition, the guest room's landline is also on the second floor, which means that if you are resting on the first floor, you have to climb up to make calls.
4. Takeaway is not convenient either. The front desk doesn’t accept it, so you still need to take the shuttle bus!
First make a call from your room, then go downstairs and wait for the bus. Then the driver will take it to the takeaway storage area for pick-up.
5. The water pressure is very low and the air conditioning facilities are old. The lighting control system is messy. If you need to charge your mobile phone at night, the bedside lamp cannot be used. There is no bedside lamp and the mirror faces the bed (some people care about this). The bathroom and toilet are all transparent glass on the same side, facing the mirror and lying on the bed. People can observe people taking a shower and going to the toilet from this mirror. (Papa is very insecure)
6. There is also a sales office in the lobby at the front desk. The environment looks very high-end. However, for tourists staying in a hotel that costs a thousand yuan to live in, it is not as comfortable as staying in a hotel that costs 300 yuan (we felt very disappointed this time)
It’s very hard for me to accept takeout. It’s just for convenience.

The stairs in the room are also very narrow, so you need to pay attention to safety when going up and down.
Samsung is my limit

msg:From a few conveniences.
Service: There are only two staff at the front desk. They were not very enthusiastic when they checked in. They kept playing with their mobile phones. After talking for a long time, they slowly put down their mobile phones. This is not very good. But the guys who drive in the park are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to help with luggage. The master who drove to the beach was also straightforward.
Facilities: There should not be many guests in the hotel now, and the villa area is basically purchased by private individuals. Only the back three buildings are mainly for hotel guests. The swimming pool is only open in front of Building 1. The takeaway is at the supermarket next to the parking lot. You can ask the little brother to drive to pick you up. It's a little far to walk. The supermarket and breakfast place are in Building 3. The shuttle bus to the beach can refer to the picture.
Room: The room we stayed in is a duplex on the highest floor, the lights are a bit dim, and you can see the sea from the room. At night, there will be a few small geckos on the wall of the balcony, which are quite cute. The floor drain next to the bathtub upstairs has a bit of a bad smell. There is only one bathroom in this room type, so it will be inconvenient upstairs. And the hotel does not provide disposable slippers. The room will be cleaned by staff every day, garbage bags will be cleared, and mineral water will be replenished. Thank you very much!
Environment: The hotel is really a natural oxygen bar. It is very suitable for the elderly hhhh there are many plants, and there is a pond of koi in front of the lobby. There is a path full of floral scents, perfect for morning and evening walks.
Breakfast: There are not many types of breakfast, but it is delicious. There are about three kinds of desserts and fruits, and there will also be porridge, meals and pastries. very nice.
All in all, the hotel is quiet at night. (If there are no neighbors talking on the balcony in the middle of the night) it is very suitable for rest. Everything is good, very satisfied.

msg:The house is very wide. Four adults and two children live in it. It is spacious, and the children can run and play. There is a big bathtub and a balcony. The facilities are simple and capable, suitable for us to bring children. The price/performance ratio is really high. I made a special call to ask, two children, one two years old and one three years old, can stay and there is no charge for breakfast. The aunt who cleans the room is also very kind. The environment is very good and there are many green plants. It is very comfortable to walk downstairs. There is a shuttle bus to the beach, and it takes about 10 minutes to walk. The food in the hotel is also ok. The only small flaw is the hot water. When other people use water, it will suddenly become larger and smaller, and it is not very stable. I went here for takeaway and dine-in. There is a Sichuan restaurant called Rongcheng Impression. The taste is online, and the portion is OK. The price is more affordable than several other restaurants we have eaten in this place. The surrounding supporting facilities are also very complete.

msg:The environment is nothing to say, tropical rainforest style, with a lot of vegetation, the hotel room style is very Southeast Asian, big enough, there is a balcony, and the balcony bathtub is big enough for two adults.
The facilities are relatively old, and a water heater is required. If you take a bath and then take a bath, the hot water can only be used to fill the bathtub once. The bed was a bit too soft for me to sleep comfortably. There are no mosquitoes in winter, and it is not humid. There are two swimming pools downstairs, relatively shallow but clean.
Hotel services are average, non-luxury hotel services. There is only one restaurant, and the breakfast buffet is good, with many choices, but the restaurant closes early, and if you miss a meal, it will close later. There is a canteen next to the restaurant. The free coconut chicken hot pot must be ordered in advance, not on the same day.
You can order takeaway, but it can only be delivered to the hotel service point, and you need to walk or take an electric car to pick up the meal yourself. There is a transfer to the beach, and it takes only 10 minutes to walk to Yalong Bay Beach (public beach).
There is a spy service, but only two people are doing it, and only one person calls and is told that the other one does not know when to come back. It feels like an individual outsourcing service.
Generally speaking, the environment is very good, the room is large, the equipment is relatively old but it doesn't affect it, and the service can't keep up.
5 points for 3.8 points.

In addition, the hotel also has a shuttle bus to the beach, half an hour is still very good.

The only bad thing is that when we entered the room, we found that the sanitation had not been cleaned up. It may be due to the reduction of staff due to the epidemic. The cigarette butts left by the previous guest, food leftovers, and messy quilts were not cleaned. Let the good mood when I first arrived a little affected...

Nanny service.
Check in and out of the hotel, there is a battery car to pick you up at any time.
The hotel upgraded us to a sea view room.
It can be regarded as a good hotel for tranquility in the bustle of Yalong Bay.
It only takes 10 minutes to walk to Yalong Bay Beach.
The hotel's large bathtub can be used for soaking.

msg:Strongly recommend the hotel. The hotel is located in Yalong Bay and you can walk to the beach (the walking time is about ten minutes. If you don’t want to walk, there is also a hotel shuttle bus🚌). Click on the Raiders to choose
The hotel room facilities are a bit outdated, but it is very good at this price. You can give 90% of the price. The greenery outside the hotel is really nothing to say. The one next to it suddenly can't remember what it is called paradise... almost greenery is very good. After eating during the day Breakfast will take a walk around the hotel to inhale oxygen
The hotel's breakfast and price also match very well. It's not the same every day. After staying for a few days, I don't feel tired at all.
If you want to live in Yalong Bay economically with your family, this hotel is the first choice

The main reason is that the breakfast is too hip. I went to eat at 9:30, and there were almost none. The bread in the bread area was really bad, so I ate a bowl of noodles and gave up. Almost no one eats, even a poached egg is procrastinated, so I won't go there again.

The next day, I changed to another big bed room, and the 5th floor was fine. There were no bugs, maybe there were fewer bugs in popular places.
The quality of the hotel service staff is still good. Every time they encounter it, they take the initiative to say hello. When the elevator encounters, they let the guests go first. The shuttle bus is also very enthusiastic, and they will take the initiative to help with luggage.
The food is really average, the hotel buffet breakfast is not cost-effective, and the food variety is not too much, but it can still be imported, because the hotel room is still far from the lobby, and the takeaway cannot be delivered. It is better to go out to eat by yourself.

msg:End of this trip to Sanya The last hotel is not too surprising, the price is super high, the hotel is integrated with the tropical rainforest, so big that you need to take a shuttle bus to get in and out, and it is the kind that is on call. The birds and flowers are accompanied by the fragrance of flowers all day, the air is fresh, quiet and beautiful, which relieves all the fatigue of the journey. Breakfast tends to be Chinese-style. Although there are not as many varieties as five-star hotels, it is still delicious. There is also a nucleic acid testing station nearby, which is very suitable for those who are returning home.

Relatively speaking, it is much better than Pullman because last year, it was broken and old and old! At first I thought there were only pool villas here. This time, we booked a courtyard room because it was cheap 😄 When we arrived at the front desk, the lady upgraded the sea view room, and the little brother gave the room card to the guest with both hands! very warm. There is a young driver in a small car to deliver it to the guest room and help with the luggage. When I went to Yalong Bay, I went to the Forest Park Hotel. I felt that the oxygen park was full of oxygen. It's a pity that I've been here for the past few days and it's been sunny for two days and it's almost cloudy and rainy☔️It's a pity For room configuration, let's take a look at the refrigerators. The refrigerators are oversized. The general hotels are small! The light switch has the word Shixishu. Anyway, I will not choose another hotel when I come to Yalong Bay in the future. It is recommended that the hotel install a make-up mirror for its guests. It will be better for girls who love makeup.

The front desk of the hotel lobby is separated from the accommodation area. There are special battery cars used to pick up and drop off tourists. The entire residential area is in the tropical forest with high vegetation coverage and is very quiet. I feel good after seeing it!
The swimming pool is clean, can smell the clean filter with sterilized water. The room is clean, similar to Southeast Asian style, and the light is a little dark. The space is very large. It is worth mentioning that the shampoo is very fragrant. Before leaving the store, I specifically asked the front desk to ask for three bottles, and the little brother at the front desk gave me generously.
The service of the hotel is also very good. There are tram drivers picking up and going in and out of the hotel, and recommending travel strategies for you. When you want to go out, you can contact the tram driver to pick you up with a phone call, which is very convenient. When going to the beach to play, there are also hotel shuttles at different times!
The only fly in the oin**ent is that the vending machine in the accommodation area is too highly rated, and a can of Coke costs 9.9! It is recommended to buy good snacks and drinks to bring back to the room to enjoy! Oh, by the way, the room also has an oversized refrigerator to keep fresh food and drinks chilled!
Recommended! 👍👍👍

When we arrive at the hotel lobby, the park will send a car to every building for everyone. There are often cars, so you don’t have to wait for a long time. Most of the little brothers who drive are very good, especially He Ruzun, who I took photos of. He greets us enthusiastically every time. My kids also like to talk to him. He is very kind to every guest staying in the hotel, boy, come on! You are great!
I ordered a garden-view room in the second phase. The room is very large. The balcony, small dining room, sink, shower room and toilet are all arranged reasonably. There are flowers in front of the balcony, and the balcony has a bathtub. I am reluctant to live for these seven days. The young lady in the guest room is very serious and responsible.
The whole park is like a park with a lot of green plants. The restaurant in Building 2 has breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner, all of which can be ordered, the chefs are good at craftsmanship, and the waiters are very warm and thoughtful.
The hotel is a certain distance away from Yalong Bay Beach. It takes about 15 minutes to get there. You can also take the hotel’s shuttle bus. The timetable is shown in the picture.
Well, next time I think I will stay here again.

The tiled floor (Sanya is damp, the floor is not easy to take care of), the small mattress on the bed, the slippers and the washing supplies are very inferior. By the way, the more plants have more insects, the little cockroaches are crawling on my arms openly, making me jump in fright...
I ordered a "sea view room", I really feel so good, an old waiter at the front desk said that we are second-tier sea view......
The service of the hotel staff is still very good, and also gave me a late check-out until 2 o'clock. The service of the battery car brother is also good, but he didn't help me get on and off the trolley case.
Try to avoid holidays next time and stay at your favorite Shangyalong Bay Hotel. I still encourage this hotel to give it 5 points.
Also, I would like to thank the Ctrip customer service for their tireless communication on nucleic acid and other matters, so that I, a tourist from a star-studded place, can legally and reasonably stay at the Shanghai South Hotel.

Compared with the star-rated room by the sea, it feels more like a vacation, and the apar**ent type is very suitable for living with the family. There are no more types of breakfast than five-star hotels, but the quality is still very good. It is worth mentioning that the price of the meals in the hotel restaurant is relatively reasonable, and the taste is also very good! No more eating unpalatable takeaways or going to the high street to eat. My favorite is the swimming pool, which is like being surrounded by jungle, giving people a different sense of experience, and the water is crystal clear. The hotel's room density is low, so there are relatively few people. We don't like the noisy environment. We plan to live here every time we go!

Thanks to Xiao Zhao at the front desk for arranging a room near the swimming pool for us according to our preferences. The front desk staff here are all very good, as well as Xiao Wang, and a man whose last name is unknown. The shuttle bus staff is also very responsible. next time you come to stay.

I rummaged through the hotels in Yalong Bay and always chose this one. . The hotel environment is very good, full of Thai style, the swimming pool is also good, the hotel has been upgraded to the 6th floor, the view is very good, but the hotel is a little old, overall good. The service attitude is very positive except for the lobby staff who was a little perfunctory that day. Some small suggestions, the battery shuttle is too slow, you can add some more. On the day of check-out, you drag your luggage and go to the outside road to take a taxi.

msg:I stayed three more times, staying for nearly twenty days in total. The location of the hotel is very good, not far from the beach and Valley of Flowers, but it is very quiet. The greenery in the park is very good, with redbuds in bloom, coconut trees swaying, and a strong tropical a**osphere. At the same time, clear streams flow down from high places, and the trails are staggered and winding. Walking along them makes you feel like you are in the graceful south of the Yangtze River. The room is large enough, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and there is no odor; the bedding is dry and comfortable for sleeping; there is a clothes drying rack on the balcony, which is convenient and practical. Special praise should be given to the cleaning staff, Ms. Zheng Lanzhen. Every time we meet in the corridor, she will greet us kindly. She is also very thorough when cleaning the room and responds to requests, which reflects the qualities that hotel employees should have.

Note: The hotel does not need to reply, but please do not copy and paste reply clichés. If you don't even have the ability and intention to comment one review after another, it will only reduce the hotel's points.

msg:It was a particularly bad experience. I booked two duplex suites with one bedroom and one living room, but when I checked in, I found that there was no bathroom on the first floor. The old man had inconvenient legs and feet, so he couldn't go upstairs at all, and the stairs were high and narrow, so there was no way to help them go upstairs. I communicated with the hotel about this, but the hotel only agreed to exchange one set of six-person rooms with extra money for a flat-floor room, and leave the other set alone, which is very unsatisfactory. Our two sets of people can live in a six-person room with two bedrooms and one living room. A duplex is empty, and the price of the two duplexes is much higher than that of a six-person house. The practice of the hotel is very special. Don't be angry. At the same time, I am very grateful to the staff of Ctrip for their communication and understanding!

🧹Hygiene: Hygiene is a bit poor, it may be crowded in peak season, and there is hair left under the mattress and around the bed.

🔔Service: The hotel's own restaurant is very cost-effective, if you are too lazy to go out and eat a meal directly. Things you can buy in the supermarket are not expensive.

🚗 Transportation: The hotel is far from the seaside. Although there are vehicles to pick up and drop off, it is not very convenient to travel at night.

Overall, the hotel is very good, suitable for family outings with older children.

It is very close to the beach and takes a taxi for 10 yuan. There is also a battery car to pick you up, but the last trip back to the hotel is at 6 pm. There is a children's swimming pool downstairs. Although it's not big, children can have fun. The breakfast is average, not amazing, but it's worth the price. It has everything you need. The only thing I have to complain about is the musty smell in the room, which is understandable because the air humidity is high near the mountains and the sea, but The temperature of the hair dryer is very low and the wind is very small. It takes a long time to dry the hair every time. There is no conditioner. The shampoo washes the hair like hay. The toothpaste of Bay Mangrove Hotel is very clean. The hotel can’t spend a lot of money on these small things, but it really affects the experience, and it is recommended to improve.

About location: It only takes more than ten minutes to walk from the commercial street, not to mention that there is a free shuttle bus to and from, which is very convenient to travel.
About the room type: This time I live in a deluxe sea view room. The room "faces the sea and blooms in spring" has an antique design, Southeast Asian resort style, transparent and bright, and an open-air bathtub.
About the service: The staff were very polite and attentive when they got out of the car and were attracted by Xiao Dong's nanny service. They helped us move the boxes and check in and then drove us to the room. The lady at the front desk treats guests with patience and care. I was fortunate enough to meet Xiao Dong and Xiao Zhao during the trip. I hope that I can chat with them next time.

In addition, this hotel is staying with a group of villas, so the left half of the hotel lobby is for check-in and the right half is for real estate. Don't show your ID card to the real estate to check in.

Secondly, the uncle of the doorman is fierce. It's not just me who thinks so. Every time I go out to eat, 4 drivers say that the doorman is fierce and look down on people? I took a trip to Shanghai, and I muttered something in my mouth with all kinds of strange and disgusting expressions.

Then every time if you want to go out to get takeout or something, it is a long journey and you need to call a car. All the men in the concierge who help you drive need to be rectified. They are all shouting "Would you like to dive, I have a package" He said, "I can find out." He was very polite and even sent the luggage to the room, and added WeChat before leaving. If you say no, you can imagine the result yourself. Anyway, I went all the way to order takeaway later.

The swimming pool is good, the breakfast is very rich, the balcony bathtub is very dirty anyway, the auntie probably only cleans the room, and the balcony does not look at it. When I went there, there were a few cute little cuties and a lot of leaves in the bathtub....

Anyway, I personally think that it will definitely not reach the five-star level, especially the quality of service, who buys a package ticket for a driver looks good, and does not buy a package with a look of disgust, your hotel does not rectify it, I really don't recommend others to come. Oh, and there is the balcony bathtub, I really need to clean it up.

It is not as good as the previous three-star Zhanyun Hotel (next to my friend’s house, for the convenience of gathering with friends). Although I have a three-star hotel, the furniture is very good. New, clean and hygienic. I saw that this hotel is five-star, the price is such a good price, and I moved too far. As a result, this hotel is definitely not up to the five-star level. I blamed me for the cheap price, more than 300 a night, I thought It is an off-season promotion. From the picture of Ctrip, it is still very good. If you want to be the same as Samsung's price, it is better to live here. Next time, you must not be greedy for cheap. You must also check the rating of each hotel. It is too important! The price of staying for two nights is not as good as booking an expensive hotel, because the most important thing is mood when you come out to play. The breakfast buffet is also very general. The most funny thing is that the five-star hotel does not have freshly ground coffee. It is instant. In short, everyone Just think of this hotel as a three-star business hotel. Let’s talk about the advantages of the hotel, that is, the hotel has a good garden and a good location in Yalong Bay. If you don’t mind the room and hardware conditions, then staying is fine. My husband will check out early. Yes, to be honest, I feel very uncomfortable because I booked the hotel, and the family was disappointed. If the hotel can see the comments, please at least maintain the hardware. Let’s go back to the old. Can you replace the mirror? ? Please look at pictures 3 and 4, don’t you think the guests will be disgusting if you live in the room?

🍃Environment: I really like it here. Surrounded by greenery, there are fewer people than those hotels near the sea.

🔔Service: But without losing, no other hotel is warm and thoughtful. Some employees are enthusiastic and some are average.
The epidemic has come to Hainan four times in the past two years. I have no particular interest in the sea. Shixi Villa is lush and lush and prefers it. Although the opening time is not short, the materials used at the beginning are very good, and the maintenance is good now, so I am happy Stay for a few days. The weather in Hainan in December is the best of the year, neither hot nor humid, nor mosquitoes. Due to the epidemic, the peak season is not busy. The price is special and the ticket for Happy Flight is also cheap. I feel very relaxed this time. Although Yalong Bay has the most tourists, it is also the most convenient tourist facility. In addition, the photographer who sent the trip to the hotel released the pigeons.

After a few tests, I found it a little troublesome. So some scenic spots in the park will not be visited in the next few days. It just happens to be here. Stayed for a few days, the environment is very good, there is a swimming pool.
The concierge, Xiaohe, came to pick you up every time. We wanted to go to the bus station and specially helped us stop to the back door, which was very close. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to and from the beach, which is very convenient. It is also very close to the beach and the commercial center, and not far on foot. It’s just that the capers and fish that I’ve been thinking about have not been eaten in the pot.

msg:I don’t usually comment on the hotel when I book it. I’m lazy. I have to write about my true feelings for this hotel. It’s really great. It is the off-season for tourism, so there are not many guests in the hotel. I prefer this. It feels very quiet and the service will be more precise because there are few people. The 24-hour battery car can pick up and drop off from the lobby to the room you booked.

The staff at the front desk are very qualified and the service is very good and caring. The staff at the concierge will take the initiative to help you with your luggage. The staff of the housekeeping depar**ent, if they see a guest taking the elevator, they will take the next shift, because they may carry some items for cleaning the room and do not want to affect the guest’s accommodation experience.

The overall feeling is very good and very clean. You can overlook the mountains in the distance. There is also a bathtub on the balcony. If you have a bathing need, you can bring your own disposable bath cloth to make it cleaner.

Did not eat out for breakfast in the hotel. If you want to have breakfast in the hotel, you can book it with the room, which is more affordable than buying it separately in the hotel.

Overall, a very satisfying experience. Didn't find out what's wrong, the room is large and comfortable, and the air conditioning is also very good. There is also a refrigerator in the room, 24-hour hot water, including battery car pick-up, and guests can go up and down the mountain 24 hours a day. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose to stay here, if I come to Yalong Bay~

Cost-effective and value-for-money, you must give a big thumbs up.

If you find a little regret, it may be that the swimming pool of the hotel on the mountain is not as good as the luxury hotels you live in Yalong Bay. Those luxury hotels have their own private beaches, and the swimming pools may be more beautiful. This side is away from the beach of Yalong Bay, about 20 minutes' walk. If you need to pick up and drop off from the hotel, there will be a battery trolley sent out on time to take guests there. However, it is sent at regular intervals, so you need to study the time in advance.

Unexpectedly, I ended up staying for 6 consecutive nights. After moving in, I gave a small surprise, the room was upgraded to the 7th floor. The front desk manager and the battery car service brother are very enthusiastic and courteous. The rooms are spacious and clean, with mountains and sea (although a little far from the sea is not a sea view). The golf course in the distance has a panoramic view. I really like to stand on the balcony of the guest room after sunset, enjoying the scenery of the tropical island in Yalong Bay. I like the sea but don't like swimming in the sea. The swimming pool in Shixi Villa is relatively standard, it should be 50 meters in length, and it is very pleasant to swim. Swim more than 1,000 meters a day for 6 days, very enjoyable. The tropical plants in the garden are lush and lush, and the mountain springs gurgling down the terrain and converge into a pool in front of the lobby. The fish swim happily, and the environment is absolutely first-class. The room service Xiao Zhou is conscientious, enthusiastic and diligent, ensuring the cleanliness of the rooms for 6 days. All in all, this time I spent more than 20 days in Sanya on a rest trip and stayed in many hotels, I was very satisfied with it.

The service attitude of the staff is very good, and the Yalong Bay Forest Park is very close. Not far from the sea.
Overall, I think the hotel’s price/performance ratio is also very high. I like the hotel’s swimming pool the most. The small swimming pool depth is very suitable for children and small adults. The decoration of the swimming pool is also very holiday style, like the one in Thailand.

It takes ten minutes to walk to the seaside, and the hotel has a special round-trip car to go to the seaside. The dining and commercial area is right by the sea. It's cheaper to live here than a seaside hotel. It's better than the seaside. The seaside is windy. It is more suitable for vacation and family travel.

Then I immediately called the front desk and the staff entered the room and said that the water was warm. I repeatedly emphasized that the water temperature was not high enough to take a bath. Later, I checked and found that the heating pump was not turned on. At that time, the water temperature showed that it was only 26°C. Is this temperature defined by the hotel as warm water? Is this temperature suitable for bathing? Later the staff said it was because I didn't turn on the heating water pump? As a customer, do I need to turn on the heating water pump by myself when staying in a hotel? No hot water is my problem? Later, it was more than an hour (10:30 in the evening) when the water temperature hit 40°C. I can't understand this operation

Since I stayed in the hotel with my little friend for a long time, Manager Chen also specially gave me fruits and dolls. It was so thoughtful. The swimming pool was very big and clean. This was the most satisfying part of my 9-day trip in Sanya. A hotel, highly recommended to stay!

msg:The hotel environment is very good, the rooms are super big, like living in a tropical rainforest~ After the rain, strolling in the hotel and taking photos is like going to a scenic spot. The swimming pool industry is very big, and my boyfriend likes to swim in it. According to the evaluation, the facilities are old, and I found it was okay. Good hygiene and cleanness are enough. Although you need to take a battery car to the lobby, it is very convenient. Every time you call, you will pick us up. It is not far to Yalong Bay, you can walk. The hotel also has a car that can be sent there. Very satisfied,! !

酒店內部有一些果樹，這讓我們的住宿體驗更加特別。孩子們第一次見到了蓮霧樹和長在樹上的蓮霧果，這成為了他們美好的回憶。值得一提的是，開通勤車的小哥特意帶我們繞了一圈，讓我們近距離觀賞了這些美麗的果樹，讓我們感到非常驚喜和愉悦。
更令人感動的是，有一個打掃衞生的大叔爬上樹給孩子們摘蓮霧。他的善舉讓我們感受到了這家酒店工作人員的温暖和貼心。雖然這家酒店看起來有些年代了，但工作人員的熱情和專業足以彌補這個缺點，讓我們感受到了家的温暖和舒適。
這次入住酒店的經歷令人滿意，我會毫不猶豫地推薦這家酒店給我的朋友和家人。感謝所有工作人員為我們帶來了如此愉快的住宿體驗。

msg:作為公寓式酒店的配置，房間、廳和衞生間的佈局是合理的，適合一家二代的親子旅遊，但開放式的廚房設計卻顯得不實用。設施舊而不破。衞生條件一般。服務一般。第一次有早餐廳的服務人員反覆幾次問我們是否已經吃過，據説有人已經用我們的房間吃過早餐。大堂寓離住的房間很遠，不甚方便。

msg:入住一號樓兩個晚上，第一個晚上回房間時候，刷房卡打不開門了，打電話跟前台説了一下，後來來個服務員，拿張卡刷半天還是不開，他又叫了另外一個服務員，兩個小夥子鼓搗半天還是打不開門，我們就蹲在房間門口一直等，他説得去拿鑰匙開了，後來去別處拿了鑰匙把房門打開了，然後就是來了位修理師傅，修了好久的門鎖，一直到我們都洗完澡準備睡覺了，他還沒修完，等我們都躺下了，終於修完了，他説讓我們得重新辦房卡，舊的用不了了，當時太晚了就沒弄，第二天早上出去吃早餐時候順便辦了新房卡，結果回來時候還是打不開門，又打電話問前台，説是得找服務員授權，後來來個服務員弄了一下，終於可以正常開門了。第二晚在晚上十點多了，樓上就一直有噪音，挪椅子的聲音，在床上蹦床咚咚咚的聲音，房間裏跑來跑去的聲音，大聲嚷嚷的聲音，給前台打電話説了一下這個情況，等了會兒還是噪音不斷，後來我們就在陽台聽聽到底是哪屋，大概率是我們樓上那屋的，好像有幾個小孩在房間裏鬧，還有在陽台浴缸那洗澡嚷嚷的，我們就沖樓上喊了一句：都幾點了，再鬧騰就報警了。後來終於消停了，總之這兩個晚上真是沒有順心的。
酒店的服務員態度還算不錯，辦理入住時候前台挺好的，打電話叫電瓶車也能及時響應，客房打掃的服務員那天看我家小孩不舒服，主動給了好幾瓶水。
就是房間稍微有點舊，房間裏的隔斷櫃門全是鏤空雕花，感覺不太乾淨，酒店位置離亞龍灣海灘不算遠，去的時候坐酒店擺渡車，回來時候逛完百花谷就溜達回來了

酒店裝修陳舊，跟住進了古宅裏面，讓人不能不聯想到電影那種鬼故事的場景。
進門一股子黴味，床墊裏面的彈簧硌得慌，比睡地上都難受，一晚上沒睡着。
酒店在山腳下，荒涼的不行，酒店的住客寥寥無幾，晚上感覺慎得慌。
空調噪音大，製冷效果也不行，給的蚊香液估計是放時間久了，一點用也沒有，估計蚊子也是好久沒聞到人味了，一個勁的吸血，一晚上被蚊子咬的滿身的包。
早餐可以放棄了，感覺好多都是放置了好幾天，吃完就想跑廁所。
還有就是攜程，沒有對酒店進行考察嗎？酒店推薦排名還挺靠前。推薦這樣的酒店真是讓人入坑啊。

房間電話不通電視不好開，打了兩次電話也很快來處理了。還有就是晚上在溪谷餐廳點菜吃飯，那個椰子雞套餐的雞肉，不是一點難煮難吃，其他菜味道還可以，還給了優惠。

msg:簡單來説，這個酒店問題很多，差勁。
1,門鎖不好用，剛到酒店門鎖就開不開，反覆嘗試才打開，後來也有偶爾打不開的情況
2,我住那個房間，床頭竟然沒有插座，插座在床靠背下面，被床墊擋着，我把電視機的插排拔掉，換到床頭充的電...
3,在床頭弄插排的時候，發現床和後面的靠背連接的地方壞了，導致我一翻身，靠背就會碰到牆，發出碰碰的異響

其實在這個時候，我都沒在意，都是小插曲...但是漏水的事情我就忍無可忍了

4，我住的是上下兩層的海景複式，我的床在一層，對應二層有個淋浴間，凌晨兩點半睡覺的時候，突然間驚醒了，天花板上漏水，直接漏在了我枕頭邊上...第二天找前台反饋，保潔阿姨過來看了下説後面會修，連個道歉都沒有...退房的時候前台也沒道歉...好像不知道一樣...這服務態度...

感覺這個酒店，沒有人在用心維護... 連漏水這樣的事都能發生...還不如我平時住的快捷酒店

服務方面除了開電瓶車的小哥比較熱情之外，整個大堂的人都很冷漠，後來發現這裏其實是別墅羣更多的可能側重於賣別墅，所以不是專業的酒店了。裏面雖然植被很茂盛，但是沒有一點意思，因為去海南不就是海邊，沙灘，泳池麼，裏面樓下倒是有個泳池但是看上去臟臟的，而且大部分酒店植被都很茂盛。最難以忍受的是早餐，真的是超級差，也沒有小童餐具，圍兜，罐裝酸奶，牛角包等，水果就衹有西瓜和香蕉，亞龍灣之前也住過這種不靠近沙灘海邊的酒店，但是同等價格早餐至少還是很豐富的。酒店設施比較老舊，但是還在忍受範圍內，房間大小還可以，但是那洗護產品一股古龍水的味道差點薰暈。總體感覺價格跟服務不匹配，因為沒啥服務壓根兒。

園林、植樹、很美，東南亞風情濃郁，早餐也算選擇多和豐富。
物超所值！每半小時一班的沙灘車很方便。
下次如果還來亞龍灣，還會住這家。

首先前台小哥哥不知道名字，眼睛大東北口音的一個小哥哥幫我們留了一個樓層高的房間，應該是升級了
然後還有一個開電瓶車的小哥哥叫何如尊的，非常好，我們的行李又多又重，熱情服務到位，幫我們搬箱子弄寄存，非常非常好！
唯一美中不足的，批評下打掃一號樓的保潔，第二天收拾的太草率了，前一天我用的面膜紙在陽台也沒收拾！
不過總體很推薦，本來住一晚上，後來住了三個晚上！

🧹衞生：也特別好，我住的是一號樓五層，每天打掃房間的短髮大姐都特別負責任。她一來打掃，孩子也很喜歡大姐，阿姨阿姨的叫。


🔔服務：特別感謝今天擺渡車接我們出來的禮賓部小徐，行李很沉，他幫着抬上抬下。服務態度很好，一點沒有不耐煩。 在石溪墅住了四天，從環境到服務都特別貼心

酒店安靜不吵鬧，性價比高，很適合家庭入住，房間面積大，房間內有大冰箱。因為距離海有點距離，所以陽台的海景看的不是那麼明顯，不過整體景色是好看的。員工服務也不錯，晚上需要衞生服務，也立馬過來清理。整體入住都很滿意。

不過沒有電梯上到地面，需要走上來，這一點就不太方便。不過房間非常大，還有大冰箱，有一個大陽台，晾曬衣服非常方便，是度假的首選。

msg:1、中午到酒店被告知房間還沒打掃完，於是打算先寄存行李出去玩，寄存行李過程中，那麼大個箱子門口大哥從頭到尾沒有幫一下忙，很酷。
2、玩回來的路上點了兩個外賣，想着回去就能拿到然後回房間吃，結果被告知酒店上午有客人外賣被別人拿走後投訴了酒店，然後外賣就不讓放大堂了，必須去酒店外面拿。其中一份外賣怎麼都送不進來，一路上外賣小哥打了七八個電話，我不知道我是來玩的還是來打電話的。另一份外賣不知道怎麼送進來了，找前台拿的時候居然問我買的什麼？我能理解被人投訴外賣被偷酒店也很想採取一些措施，但是我買的什麼為什麼要告訴你？
3、一位開電車的小哥不錯，又是幫忙搬行李，又是各種介紹，還加微信讓我們有問題可以問他。
4、環境是真不錯，服務也是真一般，以後還是老老實實選擇品牌了。
