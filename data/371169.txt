msg:This is the first time we came to Wuhan and we received great hospitality from this hotel. The hotel is clean with great amenities and I want specially thanks Miyan Dang and Thomas Tang for helping us to order Mei Tuan. We are both foreigner and basically we cannot order any food via the Mei Tuan app. Thanks to both the Westin staffs for helping us to order our dinner and branch and send up to our room. They even let us extend our room until 2pm instead of normal check out time.

And then we wait and wait ,about three days the money didn't give back to us , and then I thought that they were to busy, but then I wait about one week and more they didn't give back the money to us, the time that we check out date is 7.13 but now is 7.21 whenever we called them they said wait three days or more but we are been waiting so long that we are not sure that they will give us the money back. So I think that they were so Unreliable tht they didn't do the things and they didn't said that they did it .

msg:1. A small shop selling Maotai has been newly added on the left hand side of the entrance. This kind of setting has been seen in some five-star hotels in fifth-tier cities, but it is generally limited to high-end fashion shoes and bags and other goods that are needed for emergency evening parties. What the Westin Hotel guests need in an emergency is Maotai?
2. When queuing, guests cut in line at will. The front desk does not maintain order. It is not like a five-star hotel at all. After complaining, I initially thought that I would not deal with it. I waited for half an hour at the front desk. Finally, I got an apology from the duty manager. They said that they would strengthen training. It is not easy for guests to rush to promote businesses to improve their service level.
3. Breakfast was not finished. No matter the "occupancy" nameplate, full cup of coffee and full plate of fruit, the meal was taken away within a minute after the person left to get the food. After pointing it out, the two waiters left without saying a word... I had to politely ask them to come back and trouble them to help bring back some fruit. After a while, two lonely pears came back and said that the other fruits had been thrown away. So they were in a hurry to collect the meal and take out the garbage instead of thinking about serving the guests who really need it?
4. The restaurant faces the garden. You can see that the cleaning staff of the garden building are not equipped with special cleaning buckets and basins. Are the rags washed in the fountain?
5. When breakfast was almost over, the waiter quarreled loudly in front of the guests and almost got into a fight. The guests who were sipping coffee nearby immediately put down their cups and left the restaurant. Low management level
6. We booked a river view room, but it turned out to be the side of the building. We saw a line of river view. We asked the front desk and found out that it was called side river view. But the side view was not even as good as the ordinary room because the residents of the high-rise building opposite had clothes hanging on the balconies. The ordinary rooms at the back at least had a view of the garden at the back of the hotel. What's worse is that there was municipal construction downstairs. On Saturday, it kept banging until 1 a.m. The hotel notice said it started two years ago. The hotel should know about this noise pollution. In this case, they still marked the side rooms as side river view and charged half the price. I can only say that the management awareness of Wuhan Westin is low. It's the level of killing chickens to get * when you look "forward"
I came to Wuhan Westin ten years ago and had a good impression. I was very disappointed this time. I quickly changed to Donghu. No matter how good the location is, it will only sink without good management. Wuhan Westin, never see you again

The children are so happy! Going to the Provincial Museum, Wuhan University, and East Lake is also nearby. I made a good choice, and I share the guide with you. The May Day holiday arrived early and traveled on the 29th. It was off-peak for 2 days. The hotel upgraded the river view room, with an unbeatable panoramic view of the night light show. The elderly and children are happy, and the mood is instantly relaxed! The service is good, the hygiene is good, and the room sister also wrote a small card with problems.

1: I arrived at the hotel during the peak period of check-in and check-out, and the staff took the initiative to guide me to check in on the executive floor, which saved a lot of time.
2: The person who checked in was a girl named Chen Siyu. She was very patient. When I was hesitating about whether I wanted a suite, the direction of the room, etc., she kept smiling and helped me solve all my questions and picky questions, so I I remember her smile, like the spring sunshine, clear and bright!
Three: The breakfast category is pretty good, and the hot dry noodles taste good. I won’t go into details here.

In short, you listen to me, if you come to Wuhan and choose Westin, you won’t go wrong! ! !

msg:The room facilities and hygiene standards are excellent and meet the star standards. The food and drinks in the executive lounge are also of high quality~ The only drawback is that the toothbrush head is too hard, and there is no floor mat or shower slippers in the shower room. It may be because there are many guests staying, and the proactive service is not very good. Star-rated hotels often consider issues from the perspective of guests and details determine success or failure~

Complete facilities: the room is large enough, the bed is comfortable, and the shower has sufficient water; the disadvantage is that the windows are closed and not very breathable.
Good service: the executive room provides an executive lounge - although the dishes are average, the drinks are okay, and the hotel provides a map of Wuhan, which helps tourists understand local attractions and routes;
The overall hotel experience is good!

It was ok that we didn't provide free breakfast with two children, but there was no welcome gift. It was a five-star hotel, but there was no service at all. As for the executive lounge service and lounge privileges, we arrived late and brought two children with us. Due to time constraints, we could only go out to find food and didn't go. As for hygiene, it needs to be improved. The whole room is closed, and the room is very stuffy. It is also very stuffy without air conditioning. It's very uncomfortable. It costs 700 to 800 yuan a night, which feels very worthless! But to be honest, the breakfast is OK.

There is not much breakfast in the hotel, it has changed for two consecutive days, and the quality is good.
The room was extremely hot and stuffy, and the air conditioner couldn't adjust the temperature up or down at 24 degrees. You can choose to open the windows, but you have to accept the sound of traffic on the road.
The static electricity on the sheets was like fireworks. Although silky, it was stuffy and uncomfortable.
We paid 299 yuan for an extra bed and a side view of the river, but downstairs was a construction site and construction was still going on at 2 a.m. If we complained, the hotel could only change rooms. From 1712-1508 (with a river view), it still treated the symptoms but not the root cause. The construction ended after three o'clock in the morning and collapsed.
The main function of the hotel is to sleep. If it affects sleep, no matter how good the scenery is, it will not get points.

The executive lounge is also good. The menu is a little small, but it is enough to fill you up. Cookies, drinks and fruits are always provided.
The buffet service is average and a bit messy. When there are few people, they don't help clear away dirty dishes. When there are many people, they take away unfinished dishes. The buffet dinner menu is not rich and does not have many special features.
The Chinese element restaurant is suitable for banquets, and the business set menu for two people is also good.

Advantages: Complete facilities, including a bathtub for bathing, a swimming pool, a gym, etc. Although it is not a river view room, the upper floors on the side are very convenient to see the river view (although, there is nothing good to see...))
Disadvantages: The service response was not timely enough. I forgot to replenish the tea bags during cleaning the day before. It took more than ten minutes to deliver them after asking for them twice the next day.
The basin faucet will drip and overflow at night. It is best to check and repair it in time.

msg:Check-in was really slow. I arrived at the hotel at two o'clock and was told that I would have to wait for an hour to check in, but it actually took me two hours to get my room card. Fortunately, I booked an executive room, so I could have afternoon tea in the executive lounge while waiting. The location of the hotel is very good, right on the bank of the Wuchang River. The night view is indeed beautiful. The room is relatively large and the bed is very comfortable. However, the temperature of the air conditioner is a bit high. The central air conditioner cannot be adjusted and the window can only be opened for ventilation. The executive suite costs more than 800 yuan during non-weekends and also includes executive lounge benefits, which is quite good.

msg:I came to Wuhan for a concert and spent an extra day thinking about it and found a riverside hotel. The room has a side view of the river. The bar and restaurant on the fifth floor have very nice river views. The restaurant offers a set meal for one person and the bar offers mulled wine. The set meals are all good~
I'm very satisfied with the Westin's services and facilities. There are latex pillows. The service call was answered in one call and the response was quick (although this is basic, but I went to several Marriott and Hilton hotels this year. Emmm). I checked in in advance when I had a room. It’s also very pleasant to delay check-out until after one o’clock. You should be kind to yourself when you go out ~ I will consider this next time when I come 🤭

msg:It was my first time to stay at R&F Westin and I chose the executive suite. The overall stay experience was very satisfying. Before checking in, I was worried about the negative reviews online, but after checking in, the incomparable river view, rich breakfast, warm concierge service, and daily clean and tidy room service made me put aside my previous worries and stayed for 6 consecutive nights. It is worth mentioning that the hotel has its own European-style garden. Taking a walk after breakfast every day completely relaxes the body and mind. There are several clean and hygienic restaurants in the hotel quarantine, with Hunan, Cantonese, and Chu cuisine to choose from. I finally found a hotel that I can safely choose when I come to Wuhan in the future.

msg:Let me comment on this hotel. These waiters, on the first day I checked in, I found a woman to carry my luggage. The receptionist was standing there with a sad and unwilling look on her face. She was very talkative and ignored her, asking her questions. It was also weird. In the end, I took things to the room, and I helped him carry a lot of them. Finally, when she picked up a suitcase, he said she couldn't carry it. I am also a woman and I moved it from the car, but you said you couldn't carry it. , I can’t carry it, what are you doing to welcome guests and carry your luggage? I took a photo of the hotel lobby and sent a check-in video. This waiter was hiding here and there, as if she was afraid that I would take a photo of her. If you are still like this even though you are already wearing a mask, there is no need to poke people at work. You are the only one of the hotel staff who wears a mask. Is Wuhan still unsafe now?
Let's talk about the room. There was a door and a fitting in the room. The hotel didn't fix it, and there was still a smell of cigarette smoke coming from next door.
There is also breakfast. On the first day, because the breakfast was not finished, there was still some fruit. I thought it was a waste, so I asked a male waiter to pack it, and he packed it immediately. Others were also packing it. The next day, because the children were eating breakfast. When I was eating, I didn’t want him to eat fruit, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to finish the meal. Then I said I would give you some fruit as a reward after you finish the meal. Unexpectedly, when the waiter Luo Xiaomeng came to the door, he asked in a questioning tone, “Why are you doing this?” You have to pack it, why do you want to pack it, and you have to sign a liability exemption agreement, saying that a whole fruit can be packed, but I didn’t even see the whole fruit. This tone of voice makes us beg for food. You have to send fruit to our room in your hotel. This is just because the child ate some fruit. Why didn't it happen on the first day? If it happened on the first day, we would also do it on the second day. If you don’t know how to take it, why don’t you talk nicely? This is the service attitude of your 5-star hotel. In the end, the hotel manager came to apologize and gave us fruits. We didn’t want anything and didn’t take any. We changed hotels. The hotel manager called us to apologize from beginning to end, and we didn’t hear any waiters come to apologize. . The hotel manager asked us why we didn't take away the fruit from the front desk. Did we almost say that? It's just because children need to eat fruit when they eat. When we say that the meal is good, we reward them with fruits and then pack them. It doesn't take much for you to cut up a small amount of fruit. I originally stayed in a 5-star hotel. I thought that 5-star service would definitely be ok. Who knew it wouldn’t even be as good as 3-star? Let me show you how other hotels do it. The last picture shows how breakfast can be delivered because I can’t get up. The room and the service are very good. The breakfast is also very rich. Learn from other people's services.

Sit down at the tourist bar in the evening, have a drink and enjoy the river breeze, it is very comfortable! The service staff are very friendly and enthusiastic. Miss Joanne in the lobby is attentive and enthusiastic. She recommended travel routes and local food, and answered all questions! The rooms are clean and the bedding is very comfortable. I stayed with my parents and the two elderly people praised it full of praise! Due to time constraints, I only stayed at the Westin for one night and visited only two exhibition halls of the Hubei Provincial Museum. I recommend everyone to take a look. The cultural relics inside are absolutely unique treasures! I would also like to talk about the breakfast. The breakfast here is definitely the most cost-effective among hotels in the same category. The variety and taste are very good! I will definitely come back to Wuhan and stay at the R&F Westin again!

After checking in, I opened the door to find flower petals, candles, cakes, and birthday hats. I was very touched, especially the little cutie in the middle of the bed. It was very cute. Overall, I was very satisfied. I highly praised the Westin Wuhan R&F Hotel for Yina’s sweet smile and professional service. Full marks 💯

As soon as they enter, they are greeted by the fragrant lobby. The queue at the front desk is also orderly. There are really a lot of customers. The handsome man at the front desk, Manager Yu, is very patient. He doesn't mind our many questions and handles them. The interesting and delicious places around the hotel are described in detail. Hujin Restaurant, which I passed by when I was eating, also recommended many signature dishes without any surprises. The mattress in the room is really comfortable and the sanitary conditions are good. Come and experience the river view when the price drops. At the end of the check-out, I received a handbook as a gift. I hope the hotel will become more and more amazing.

However, in fact, I was naive. The light bulb above my head in the room was inexplicably on. The front desk service is pretty good. The fruit delivered may not be seen due to the do not disturb sign. The breakfast seems to have a lot of variety, but it doesn't have much content. I don't know how the breakfast is in the off-season. It is recommended that you can enjoy the upgraded benefits at the same price in the peak season.

msg:The accommodation experience at the Westin Wuhan Hotel this time was indeed not ideal. 1. When I first checked in, the front desk upgraded the room type, but the air conditioner in the 2010 room had a peculiar smell. It took 15 minutes to call the express service and it could not be resolved. I had to take my children to get it. Take your luggage to the hotel front desk to handle it and change rooms.
2. Since I booked a room and brought two light meals, I had already made a reservation when I checked in. Who knew that when I went to the lobby bar for dinner at noon the next day, I was told that there was no reservation in advance and no preparations. After waiting for half an hour, I made two servings (actually four boiled eggs, four sandwiches, two cups of yogurt, and two vegetable salads)
3. The hotel breakfast is not as simple as a business hotel, and it ends at 10:00. The dishes are simple. If you want to eat an omelette, the service staff is always not at the service station. It really does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel.
4. The only bright spot may be the unpleasantness of the previous day. The hotel sent a fruit platter in the evening, which was indeed a surprise.
5. The hotel lobby is grand and upscale, but the service really needs to be improved.

The overall style is relatively old, but it does not affect the interior at all. The bed is my favorite Heavenly Bed, very soft. The toiletries are still white tea and aloe vera, and the bathroom has good reviews.
There is a garden next to the restaurant, and the coffee at breakfast is better than Intercontinental. You can go to the executive lounge upstairs in the evening, which is very nice.
Special thanks to Owen from the concierge, who greeted us warmly every time we met and planned our itinerary.

msg:After coming to Wuhan for a long time, I made sure to find a hotel along the river to stay. I researched all the five-star brand hotels and finally chose the Westin. When I saw the comments that there are construction projects here, I felt a little excited. But from the moment you entered the lobby, you knew it was worth it! It was the right choice! The young ladies at the front desk are very enthusiastic. They are not only good-looking but also very attentive and caring. After check-in, a young lady named Ella Cheng helped us with our luggage and introduced us to nearby food. We were given a fruit plate as a gift, which was very considerate and the person was kind-hearted.
Because the room is an executive room, you can use the executive lounge on the 21st floor. After going to the Yellow Crane Tower and Hubei Provincial Museum, I was really tired and needed some alcohol, so my friend went to the executive lounge to have a drink and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the river. Thank you very much Ms. Chen Siyu's enthusiastic service, and the "Tequila Sunrise" prepared by Ms. Camellia for us was very beautiful. The service staff in the lounge are very enthusiastic, thank them very much! I hope I can come here and experience the beautiful cocktails next time I have the opportunity.

After finishing the bartending on the 21st floor, we went to the bar floor on the 5th floor to have a few more drinks with friends. It was another feeling outdoors, blowing the river breeze, looking at the beautiful scenery, drinking good wine, and sweeping away the fatigue of the whole day.
When I woke up the next day, I had an early morning yoga session along the river in front of the big floor-to-ceiling windows. It was simply wonderful and worth it!
I will stay here next time I come to Wuhan! It felt great from start to finish.

I would also like to express my special thanks to the room service depar**ent for finding the necklace I lost in the room and couriering it home for me. I am very grateful to the hotel for its considerate service. I will choose to stay at your hotel again when I visit Wuhan in the future! !

There was a very low-frequency noise every 5-10 seconds (maybe because I am sensitive to low-frequency resonance sounds); 2. Every 5-10 minutes. The frame will vibrate with a small sound. I opened the window and found that outside the window was the equipment platform (probably separated by two floors, very close) and the municipal construction site.
Basically, I didn’t rest well at all, so can’t you arrange a higher floor for me, depressed

msg:I have stayed in quite a few hotels under its banner before. This is the first time I stayed at Westin. The overall feeling of the hotel is quite luxurious and worthy of the star rating.
The overall service of this store is not bad, and the traffic is relatively convenient. It is about 800 meters away from the subway station, and it takes about 10 minutes to walk. Taxi rides are almost always available within seconds.
The layout of the room is OK. It is similar to other hotels under its banner in all aspects. The main reason is that the hygiene is really good and it is very clean. I like the feeling of cleanliness.
The only downside is that this kind of old-fashioned big hotel can actually improve the hardware, such as TV, and it feels like it should follow the trend. Let’s build a food delivery robot.

msg:Just after watching "Thirty Thousand Miles of Chang'an", I went to Wuhan on a business trip and stayed in this hotel near Wuchang River Beach. When I checked in, it was the first time when the lights came on. When I saw the river view outside the window, it was really lonely sails, distant shadows and blue sky. Only the Yangtze River flowed into the sky. Walking 500 meters from the hotel, it is the gourmet street of Wanda Mansion, where all the breakfast varieties in Hubei can be selected.
Returning to the hotel after dinner, I was once again amazed by the river view outside the window. The bright lights show the two rivers and four banks, making Jiangcheng look like a dream.
During this stay, I was most impressed by Ms. Cheng Qiuyue's warm service, smile, and sweet image, which is simply the face value of Westin. Forget it, I can't comment anymore, my wife found out that I was going to kneel down on the durian.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the fruit in the room is not very fresh, and the apples are wilted, like putting After a long time, the guests didn't eat it and took it out again. When I checked in, I said I would give you a fruit plate. In fact, I don’t care if I send it or not. The content of the fruit plate is an apple, a pear, and an orange. (If you don't want to give it away, you really don't have to give it away, I don't mind, but it's really inappropriate for you to give a wilting apple). The guy who checked in was a young man, he felt unskilled in business, and his attitude was average. I only asked a few questions, obviously impatient. I booked a room three days in advance, with elderly and children, but the room was arranged at 7 One is on the 19th floor. I negotiated for a long time before being transferred to the 19th floor. (If it’s convenient for the guests, why not? The young man insisted that they can’t be arranged together. After I begged hard, the young man said that there is another room on the 19th floor. It’s actually a very simple matter, and it took me a lot of trouble. Besides, Have I upgraded? The room type I live in is the room type I ordered. This guy is wearing a black suit, so I won’t name names, I hope to pay attention next time). In comparison, the coco in the lounge is still very good, smiling all the time The service is very professional. I hope Westin can bring you a better experience next time!

msg:The first is the service. I waited two hours for the room to check in. From the beginning, it was said that someone was cleaning my room. After two hours of cleaning, I almost thought that the hotel gave me half a floor. The second is the room, which has a sense of age. The so-called front river view room is the least interesting thing I have stayed in so many hotels. It is completely unnecessary, and it will protect everyone from lightning. Then there is the lounge, watermelon juice, lemonade, soda, cola, two kinds of fruit, two kinds of cakes, no more, this is the executive lounge, and it is also the most foolish executive lounge I have ever encountered. Finally, let’s talk about breakfast. In the hotel on the 22nd floor, the breakfast counter is only 1/4 of that of ordinary high-end hotels. Fortunately, we had to catch the train, so we had an early meal and there were not many people. It’s hard to imagine how to eat when there are many people. Not to mention the meals, anyway, I just drank a bowl of porridge, some fruits are fast, and I don’t seem to have much appetite for others.
Having said so much, the hotel’s reply is probably very sorry, and I value it very much, and I look forward to the next time... I think the same problem was raised last year, but there is still no improvement. I still hope that the hotel will not always engage in formalism. Hit the smiley man. Let's improve the management level and software and hardware.

msg:The room is a river view room, which enjoys administrative courtesy. Although it is facing the river view to the west, it is dark glass so it can block part of the sunlight radiation. Maybe the problem of west exposure has been considered in the design. The only downside is that there is a smell of smoke when entering the room, but the two room attendants said they couldn't smell it. The central air conditioner comes out of the air outlet. Then asked to open the window. Overall is very good. The hall is magnificent.

msg:overall feeling is disappoin**ent
I have lived in the Marriott, Renaissance and Sheraton before. The Westin in Wuhan has the worst conditions. It is unbearable.
The service is good, the doorman and the service center are well-trained, and the service staff encountered in the executive lounge are also very nice
Main complaints:
1. The bed is actually made of two pieces, and it is super soft. I only found it when I was sleeping, otherwise I must ask for a replacement
2. The room facilities and supplies are simple, which is the level of express hotels
3. The guest room was not inspected properly. Spikes protruded from the foot of the bed, which was easy to scratch. Fortunately, we were not injured (pictured)
4. Didn’t notice the word game, side river view is not river view room
5. Objective evaluation, hardware conditions are not as good as Howard Johnson Hotel

msg:🥰Because I really coveted the Westin bed, after staying in other hotels for a few days, I specially arranged to stay at the Westin Wuhan R&F Hotel by the river for two days.

📍On Yanjiang Avenue on the east side of the river, if the floor is high enough, the weather is good enough, and the room is just close to the side of the river, you can see a good view of the river. The location is not bad, it takes about ten minutes to walk to the subway station Yanjiang Road Station, and it can be reached quickly by bicycle.

👩🏻‍💼The service is still as good as ever, and the check-in was very smooth. The only thing is that it is not well synchronized with the benefits on a certain journey, which leads to the need for individual privileges to be communicated later.

🍶Executive suites can enjoy the trea**ent of the executive floor. In the evening, there is a happy hour in the executive lounge. I went up to have a look, and prepared a lot of base wine and various alcoholic drinks. Ask, do you serve cocktails here? Answer, oh, they are all self-service, you can adjust them yourself. Ah, this... I finally want to go to the executive lounge and have a drink, but I have to be a bartender? It really refreshed my understanding of the executive lounge.

🛁The suite room is spacious, the living room has a sofa and a work desk, and the bathroom has a shower, bathtub, and toilet with wet and dry partitions. The bathtub is very comfortable, but the shower is very weird. The knob design of the shower head is really anti-human. Found that you can't close it at all, ahahaha that's awesome, then I asked the staff to help with it, just said, this is a design problem, all suites are like this...uh

🛏The bedroom space does not disappoint. The bed is comfortable enough. If you have special needs for pillows, you can contact the staff. There is also a massage chair in the room that can be used at any time. That being said, this massage chair is a lifesaver.

📺In fact, the room setting is very considerate. There is a TV in the living room, a TV in the bedroom, and even a small TV in the bathtub. However, every TV is not! clear! Chu! Hahahaha I really watched the blurred version of the Spring Festival Gala the whole time. Normally, I wouldn’t go to a hotel to watch TV, but it’s so rare that I have to watch it once.

🍜The breakfast on the first floor is okay. There are quite a lot of Chinese and Western styles, and Wuhan-style hot and dry noodles, noodle nests, etc. have been added, and the taste is not bad.

[Fireworks] The overall experience is still quite satisfactory. Most of the minor problems that have occurred may be caused by relatively old equipment? Upgrading will be better~

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, the view from the river view room is very positive, just in time to watch the light show at night. Breakfast is also good. Stroll along the river and you can walk to the Yangtze River Bridge (take the ferry here for 1.5 and you can go directly to the pedestrian street on the other side, every half an hour)
You can walk to the Yellow Crane Tower by turning another corner. It is also very convenient to ride a bicycle.
The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the subway station, and the pedestrian street is just one stop across the river. Those who like to live in a lively area are actually recommended to live near the pedestrian street on the other side of the river. It is convenient to go anywhere. Those who like to live quietly and enjoy the river view recommend this place. After all, crossing the river is also very convenient!
Because I chose the executive river view room, I can enjoy afternoon tea, dinner and drinks in the executive lounge for free. Zhang Yu ROSY in the executive lounge is very NICE. He patiently answered many of my questions and recommended suitable drinks. The mixed wine is also delicious. Thank you so much! !
Xiao Xie at the front desk gave me 2 Wuhan refrigerator stickers when I checked out, which is very considerate~~~Thank you

msg:Checked in after 2 pm on 1/30, and was told that either the room was downgraded, and I booked a river view suite or a river view twin room to give you a garden view room, or wait for our room to become vacant at some point. Tell the front desk that there are three children, but there is no way. During the period, it is invalid to complain to the day shift manager, and it is invalid to communicate with Ctrip.
Back at the hotel at night, when I opened the bathroom, I saw the empty box of hair conditioner that the previous guest had used up. I called Ctrip to report this. The customer service said that the manager would take the initiative to find me, but in fact he didn't. It was after 11:00 in the middle of the night, and the manager told Ctrip that he would come to my room to have a look! Unbelievable! I have three children with me, why are you here when the children are resting at this point? I reject!
On the morning of 1/31, I put the empty hair conditioner box from the previous guest in a bag and handed it to the front desk and asked her to hand it to the manager. After that, the hotel did not apologize in any form.
In many cases, customers don't want you to send things, they just want an attitude. I spent more than 7,000 yuan for two nights here, so I won’t be greedy for you to give me a discount of 15 cents. I didn’t give me mineral water in my room on 1/31, let alone an executive room, even an ordinary standard room. Mineral water should not be added. Five-star hotels in third-tier small cities would not make such low-level mistakes again and again. The manager is like this, the front desk waiter, room service is no wonder.
Disgusting check-in experience, don't contact me to modify the evaluation in any form, complain to the end. There is no need for you to make false statements.

The attitude is extremely bad. They don’t want to entertain guests at all. The per capita meal fee is 600, and then they tell me that there is no juice, because fruits tend to go bad in winter. I don’t understand the logic of this. Anyway, it’s disgusting. Sound insulation... It's like no, the sound of the sports car on the riverside and the chatter of neighbors in all directions are clear.

msg:The most unacceptable thing is to change the double bed to a double bed, the feeling of putting two beds together, how did your management come up with it? Does Ctrip allow this to happen as well? In addition, the front desk clearly informed Ctrip that the rooms booked by Ctrip are all on the lower floors! ! It's totally cheating consumers. The service attitude of the front desk and the switchboard is bad. Once you enter the guest room, it is said that you can watch the river. It is indeed possible. People have to lie on the side of the window to maintain a posture, and the air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted. It will be hot and cold for a while, and it will be the next day I have a cold. The sound insulation is also extremely poor. After listening to the sound of large trucks outside all night, the sanitation is not as good as some domestic chain hotels, and the facilities and equipment are also dilapidated. That TV could be shabby and smaller. I went downstairs to have breakfast in the morning, but I couldn’t dine in. In the current environment where dine-in is allowed, I still can’t dine-in, and I didn’t inform in advance if I couldn’t dine-in. The process of waiting there for packing is also chaotic. Pack it up and change it immediately hotel. Worst Westin ever lived in the world. none of them. Hope all Marriott members avoid this hotel! ! Pull across, pull across! Pulled down the quality of Westin. Strongly recommend delisting.

msg:Not to mention the location of the hotel, the Wuchang River Beach is located at C, overlooking the other side of Hankou. I was a little disappointed with the service. This hotel set all the river views as executive rooms, so I got a room on the 6th floor, which was the lowest floor executive room in the history of personal hotel living. It may be because of the large number of people on the National Day, the executive lounge was full of people, and the front desk did not answer any questions about the consultation. The terrace music bar on the 5th floor is good, but the singers continue to sing until nearly 11 o'clock, which is not friendly to the guests on the nearby floors.

msg:This stay was to visit an "old friend" in the hotel. As an old-fashioned Marriott-style luxury hotel, some of the details of the check-in process are still not in place (for example, the lack of the welcome letter on the TV and the fruit plate that is not very attentive) may be caused by too few employees. However, the attraction of the hotel is never the exaggerated design and multi-functional facilities, only the service is more popular.

But I'm also very happy to see "old acquaintances" once before leaving the country.
Thomas, who is eager to help with luggage when entering and leaving the hotel.
Joanne and Maura Vicky, who appear in the lounge and the front desk with a smile every day ~ I am super happy every time I see them, even if there is a lot of unpleasantness in the hotel, they will disappear.
There is also Chef Liu Qin in the breakfast room, who greets us warmly when we walk into the breakfast room and cooks a delicate and delicious egg Benny every time.
There is not much to say. Let everyone be promoted as soon as possible~ I hope that when I come in the future, I can drink sweet red hahaha. The dry red in the lounge is too unpleasant to drink.

Afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge was closed due to the epidemic, the hotel presented 2 moon cakes. The evening meal is a buffet in the executive lounge. There are not many dishes, but cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, cakes and fruits are available. The special feature is wine, rum, beer and other wines. After dinner, I went to the terrace bar on the 5th floor for a stroll. It was so nice to watch the magnificent night view of the Yangtze River blowing the river breeze in this weather! It's a pity that Westin couldn't appreciate the Mid-Autumn Moon when he saw the river facing west. The breakfast dishes are rich, but I think there are less cakes in the pastry for dessert lovers. The gym has a separate exercise room, the swimming pool has a 40-degree and 28-degree bath pool and a sauna room, and the locker is equipped with slippers and bath towels. The swimming pool is about 25 meters long and 15 meters wide, all 1.5 meters deep.

msg:The hotel is located on the edge of the Yangtze River. It is a rare five-star hotel with river view rooms in Wuhan. Jenny Xiaoyang was really patient and meticulous when checking in at the front desk. Because of doubts about check-in, he specially asked the manager for me. Later, I heard that Marriott has a special custom room card, but the front desk still looked for a long time to help me check in with the custom card.

This time I stayed in a 02-type room, one on each floor. When you open the door, you can see the unobstructed view of the river. When you open your eyes and turn your head in the morning, you can see the water in the Yangtze River gleaming. For a moment, I envy the endlessness of the Yangtze River." In the evening, I went to the Executive Lounge on the 21st floor to sit down for a drink, have some snacks, and look at the night view outside the window, and the entire Jiangcheng had a panoramic view.

msg:If it was a convenient hotel or a three-star four-star hotel, I wouldn't say this, but as a five-star hotel, Westin still has a lot of room to improve its soft power. The guest saw that the guest was carrying a lot of things as if he didn't see it. He didn't mean to ask the guest to help us carry things, but at least tell us that the elevator should go over there. The elevator is divided into two parts. The staff of the hotel who are the hotel guests look at us, can't even tell the difference between guests and non-guests? Besides the doorman and the other hotel staff at the front desk, when they see the guests, they don't say arrogance, at least they keep silent. Not to mention that Hyatt is affiliated. Even Niccolo with sloppy online reviews is doing better than your hotel. At least their staff are energetic and confident.
         Let's talk about a good place. It's an old hotel. The facilities are definitely old, but fortunately, the sanitation is very good. The room is generally comfortable. There is nothing to say about the river view.

Let’s talk about the equipment first, look at the pictures, watch the video and talk, this rain is really scary! A shower head came out of the big black hole, and the surrounding was not closed. Turning on the water is like a goddess scattered flowers. It looks like it has been blocked for a long time and no one has maintained it! On the first day, I stayed in the 15th-floor administrative river view room, but the air conditioner was turned on for an hour and the temperature couldn't come down, Wuhan! Can you imagine how terrible it is... I called the front desk and called a maintenance technician to come up. The result of the thermometer was that the air conditioner was ok, but the indoor temperature was indeed 27 degrees higher (I have been driving for an hour and a half. ), the front desk still doesn't know how to deal with it stupidly. I don't say that he can't think of a solution for changing rooms (the person on duty must be a rookie). Then we changed rooms, but all the sockets were out of power. We foolishly plugged in our mobile phones and fell asleep. The next day, we didn't charge a single cell of electricity, so we called again and came to fix it. I feel like I'm not here to stay in a hotel, I'm here to test and repair. Then I found that the shower control valve of the bathtub was broken. Well, at this point I have lost my temper, just praying to end my trip to this store as soon as possible.
Because, I have had enough.
Let's talk about his executive lounge again, it's so shabby! There is no light meal in the executive lounge, only fruit, and it is still available for a limited time, so you can count! If you can't afford the executive lounge, don't do it. If you can, please do it well. We can afford the 100 yuan price increase.
The only good thing is the scenery, already pictured above. Breakfast is better than Hilton's across the river.

4. There are no paper towels on the breakfast table, ask the receptionist, just point to the waiter, let me find the waiter by myself, I have astigmatism without glasses, I really can't see clearly.
5. When ordering a scrambled egg for breakfast, the chef didn’t raise his eyes, let alone raise his head. He didn’t tell me how long it would take to wait, so he made his own. I said hello, I want a scrambled egg without adding anything, until I think it’s possible I did it, I saw that he put the ingredients and asked, and I said I don’t want to add ingredients, he reluctantly changed it for me.
6. The little brother directing the parking is very enthusiastic, boast~
7. It's great to receive good morning from room service in the morning^_^
8. I don’t know when Westin became like this. I have only lived in Tianjin and Wuhan in China. This time, Westin Wuhan made me feel that I don’t even want to come to Wuhan again.

In addition, there is an open-air bar on the 5th floor of the hotel, and you can also watch the lights. show.
       But when it comes to the room and service, I feel so-so, and I feel sorry for the price. The price of more than 1700 is supposed to be much higher than the experience here. First of all, the room is not big, the hotel facilities are not new, and the waiters are not Enthusiastic (here, let’s talk about the car boy at the entrance of the hotel. When he saw the car coming, it was like he didn’t see it. There was no guidance at all. Is this the service of a five-star hotel?)
       In fact, since there is an open-air bar on the 5th floor, why spend the money to live in this room? It doesn't feel worth it.

I have experienced three waiters in the hotel, the first one is extremely teasing, the second one rolls his eyes, and the third one is the legendary Li Mochou. At the end of the quarrel, I suddenly felt the helplessness of catching turtles in the urn, and there was no object to appeal. In the end, you can only blame yourself for the wrong choice. It's inevitable that the room is bad. If you call to ask your request after booking, it's a fart. As long as the waiter of the emperor and the empress dowager has a service attitude of 1% on Ctrip, it will never delay my entire trip to Wuhan because of this, if not for the nearly 1,600 yuan administrative river view king room Looking forward, I will definitely not be played in applause. Infinite regret, extreme regret, regret for choosing! ! !

After asking, he asked me to go to the other side. He didn't deal with it, and then I waited in line again, it was my turn, and repeated it again. The front desk checked, but the room was still not ready, and asked me if the 15th floor was okay, and that was only the 15th floor. As for other things such as sanitation and environment, they are all good. In particular, the cleaning lady has a very good attitude, and the cleaning service is very professional, so give it a good review.

🧹Sanitation: The hygiene is very good, the public areas are relatively clean, and the house cleaning is in place
🍃Environment: The environment is good, especially the open-air bar on the 5th floor of the night view. The price is also ok. All sofa seats, no matter the size, cost 600 yuan to offset a cocktail of 60-70 yuan on average. A small sofa seat can sit at most for two or three people. A lot of unreasonable rooms say that you can't see the river view, but you can still see a small part of the room was upgraded to the 22nd floor for free (23 floors in total). It's a small surprise.
🔔Service: The room service is very timely after hanging up the phone. The waiting time is less than 3 minutes. The only downside is that the room service call is often unable to get through. There are too few operators. Sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes. The lobby manager dealt with it very quickly and seriously, and also gave a fruit plate to express his gratitude for the excellent service. There are many kinds of buffet dinners. The price of more than 200 per person is not expensive, but the taste is almost meaningless.
Overall it's good for the price

First of all, the hotel has a beautiful environment and the service is in place. The cleaning aunt basically responds to all requests and is tireless, conscientious, conscientious, and friendly. The breakfast is very good, the combination of Chinese and Western, the chef is very good at communication, you can make fried egg whites with the egg yolk removed in 45 seconds on one side, and you can also fry the egg rolls that burst when you bite, especially the chief responsible for the juice can squeeze out the peeling slices and cut off the fibers of freshly squeezed orange juice. I would like to thank Mr. Xu Lili, the lobby manager, for his gentle and friendly attitude and courteous service, which can make the guests feel at home. Finally, I would like to comment on the slippers and bathrobes of the hotel. The slippers have a dense and warm texture, and there is no discomfort after wearing them on the Yangtze River. They are of high quality. It warmed my heart, and then I was no longer afraid of the world's cynicism and bravely stood on the edge of the Yangtze River and under the neon lights, but the thin bathrobe seemed to have armor all over my body. Thanks again for the service of Mr. Xu Lili in the hotel lobby. I wish you good health and smooth work. I also wish Wuhan R&F Westin Hotel can maintain its leading position in the industry and provide better service and experience to consumers.

msg:Location: Located in Wuchang, it doesn't look too far from anywhere on the map, but it's not close to the main attractions. There is no large commercial plaza nearby, and it is far from cbd.
Facilities: very old, like a 1980s hostel. Because it is so old, the whole room, lounge and gym are very dirty. Modern facilities (such as usb ports) are not available, bathroom and carpet are very bad dirty.
Service: This should be the worst hotel in the Marriott depar**ent. The front desk clerk didn't smile or greeted the whole process, even if he asked three questions. The waiter walking in the corridor directly turned his head when he saw the guest.
The most worthy feedback is that during my stay, I arranged a room that had just been brushed the day before. Housekeeping said that because the Dragon Boat Festival was too full, we could only arrange this room. Normally, after brushing the glue, it will be idle for a period of time before selling it. to guests.
We strongly do not urge everyone to travel to Wuhan and stay in this hotel!

I felt that Jiang Jing looked lonely. The room was very clean, in line with the requirements of a five-star hotel. The room includes administrative trea**ent. The view of the administrative corridor on the 21st floor is very good, quiet and leisurely, but the food quality is average, and the breakfast variety is very small. Evening dessert cocktails were good. The view of the open-air bar on the 9th floor is very good, it is too cold in winter... I will make another reservation for my next business trip.

Opening the curtains is the office building, without privacy. The telephone receiver has no sound at all, and the landline must be hands-free. What is particularly strange is that the windows cannot be opened or closed, and the hotel staff must be able to open and close them. The most important thing is cold 🥶.

msg:The Westin Hotel has an excellent location, facing the river in front, the hotel is relatively new, the lobby is magnificent, magnificent, and the room decoration is relatively high-end, in short, the hardware is good, but the waiters generally feel relatively indifferent, maybe the hotel is high-end, and there are more guests. The reason, see Ctrip’s previous comment. There is an observation deck on the 5th floor to see the beautiful scenery of the Yangtze River. After checking in in the afternoon, I went to the bar on the 5th floor with my wife. A male waiter asked me indifferently after hearing my question. In this situation, I am no longer interested in replying. Also not interested in planning to drink a glass of beer. Because the room has a brochure introducing breakfast service, it says that breakfast is from 6 to 11, and the next morning is at 9:50, but the waiter who looks like a master said that the meal will be taken immediately. Take the meal as soon as possible. The meal was fast and surprising. Some meals were not available and the counter was empty. I rushed to grab some meals, and I was uncomfortable to eat. I originally imagined enjoying a delicious breakfast, but it turned out to be a food grab. A very unpleasant dining experience, Westin, I want to say that loving you is not easy...

Because the Yellow Crane Tower and the Provincial Museum are in Wuchang, I finally wanted convenience and the most important thing, so I booked the Westin executive river view room (but later according to The taxi driver said that it’s better to watch the light show in Hankou, and the cruise ship terminal is also closer. In short, each has its own advantages), the room is worthy of the name, and the river view is invincible! The rooms and bathrooms are relatively large and sanitary. The front desk is very welcoming and attentive. In addition, the hotel is more regular. The executive room can enjoy the executive lounge. Unlike many hotels, they cut corners as soon as they open to the country. In the morning, I ate in the executive lounge. Although there are not as many types as on the first floor, it is better than the environment. I think there are two places in the hotel that can be improved: one is that some facilities need to be checked and maintained, especially the wall sockets. Several of them are loose. It is embarrassing that the hair dryer will fall off as soon as it is plugged in. The second is that as a five-star hotel, there is no night train service, which is a bit unexpected.

The most important thing is that I was not satisfied with the floor of the room I set, and wanted to change to a higher floor. I used the fruit as an excuse to prevaricate me. I didn't hear my request at all!
After waiting for a long time, give me the card, and I asked to change the senior level. Waited at least 10 minutes to change the room card!
When I arrived at the room, I actually called and said that I had forgotten to collect my deposit and asked me to go downstairs to pay. I paid by the way when I went downstairs for dinner.
The most weird thing is that under the sofa in the room there is a pair of slippers that the last guest passed through, and there is a bottle behind the air purifier, the water left by the last customer.
And the plug of the kettle is broken. . . bad. . . .

But the river view is very beautiful, and the night view is beautiful. The breakfast is rich and delicious.
However, this experience is not as good as the previous check-in experience!

msg:Extremely not recommended, Westin is no longer the Westin it used to be. First, check in at the front desk is encouraged to jump in the queue. Whoever can squeeze in at the front desk will come first. After many years of hard work, we finally returned to the uncivilized era. After expressing dissatisfaction with the front desk staff, the front desk looked nonchalant and asked me to record her. Her name is Sherry Yang Kunyue. She can do this kind of behavior, which shows that encouraging jump in the queue is not a personal act, but a unified arrangement of the hotel. And I got my wish and got a room near the air conditioner. The movement was not small, which affected my sleep. I secretly regretted that I should not offend the front desk. Another very bad place is hygiene. Let's take a look at the pictures for yourself. Now I don't even bother to clean up. The service is also not as good as before. I called the switchboard and asked to transfer to the front desk, but I told me how to contact the front desk and told me that the room could never contact the front desk directly. I could only tell the switchboard to call the front desk. I said Please ask the front desk to contact me. As a result, I did not receive a call from the front desk for three days from check-in to check-out. Business trips are all five-star hotels, and Westin Hefei is the worst. If it wasn't for being too busy, I would definitely change to another hotel!

msg:Although the hotel has been renovated for many years after opening, it is still very magnificent, an ultra-standard luxury hotel. When we checked in to the hotel, the room was not yet accepted. Mr. Zhou Chenghan, the hotel concierge, took us to the executive lounge to rest and drink first. He also helped us stay in the riverside room and delivered drinks. Everything was arranged so pleasantly. The hotel’s breakfast and dinner are very rich, and you can take a walk along the river after you leave the hotel. The night view is very beautiful.

In addition to seeing the night view of the Yangtze River, the most comfortable thing is the bed and pillows in the room. The hotel is very human and equipped with narrow and long pillows, which is full of happiness for people with cervical spondylosis. The beautiful butler lamb, the sweet voice and thoughtful service left a deep impression on me, thank you for sending fruits, thank you for upgrading the room, and thank you for the warm and thoughtful service. Next time I come to plan to live, cherish every opportunity to see the river [Tongue]

msg:這次跨年夜選擇2晚入住外觀高大尚的富力威斯汀酒店行政江景房，這次入住富力威斯汀酒店行政房感受是最差，太差！！！以前各地大酒店享受行政酒廊待遇的住過N家，而這次是我住過體驗感最差的啦！先説房間，一千多元的行政豪華房，冰箱裏衹放了五六罐一般的飲料並且是收費的。再説更差的行政酒廊，下午茶極其簡單，兩天的下午茶，茶包沒有，喝茶要找服務員要，簡單的幾種飲料和極簡小餅乾、點心就沒別的了。晚上的歡樂時光晚餐，差到令人難以相信的地步，跨新年和元旦的晚上，僅有兩葷兩素而其中每晚一葷都是鴨架，前20分鐘，兩葷兩素，20分鐘之後衹有一葷兩素，加上稀飯麪包點心、一些涼菜和酒水。住店的客人包括行政樓的客人還不少，後來的就沒有什麼吃的了。元旦晚上的兩葷中有一個是甲魚估計衹殺了一衹一刻鐘之內前面幾個人取完後就再也沒添加，就變成了一葷兩素。
健身房裡瓶裝水都沒有，衹有桶裝水包裹的緊緊的，看不清日期看不清是不是過期了，運動渴了根本不敢喝。
游泳池不大，由於池水不太幹凈也不知道多少天換一次，在泳池裡游泳會特別累、特別費勁，總之開開心心來酒店選擇行政房跨新年，結果太失望之極，太不值啦！頭一次給住過的五星級酒店這種差評。

2、服務總的來講是可以的，不過跨年夜酒吧上菜實在是太慢了，主要是孩子餓的受不了，酒吧和後廚是脱節的；
3、設施説老實話是住過的所有萬豪系的酒店裡最差的，沒有之一。跨年夜1500的單價性價比不高；
4、以為會有跨年不一樣的燈光秀，客房標題也是這麼寫的，結果什麼也沒有，多少有些誤導。

早餐可以吃飽，作為遊客，沒有一點驚喜。中規中矩都不達標。餐盤居然還很臟。這是可以擦掉的臟，已經擦過的盤子。
第一次到武漢住的太失望了。

服務：最可圈可點的就是接待我的前台鬱經理，主打的就是真實。各個價位，請吃飯的地方講的很詳細，哪裡好停車哪裡要開車都説的蠻清楚。畢竟招待領導問的多一些，打了好幾個電話也都能接到解決問題，好像現在小龍蝦不太行了可以湖景酒樓和簡什麼請客。不過好像武漢早餐吃的還是有點少，估計沒找對地方
設施：訂了好多些房。江景擺在這就沒的説了絕佳水平，就是地毯確實不怎麼亮了，房間功能智能化差一些。
衞生：每天都有打掃到位
鬱經理真的很附則，最後還跟我郵寄發票，五星好評，點贊哦

老牌5星級豪華酒店，確實老，但不舊，中規中矩。不過現代感科技感基本沒有。屋裡的窗簾都要手動拉，馬桶傳統老式，不帶清洗功能，浴缸、洗手枱大而簡單。房內傢俱齊全也是簡單。空調也有點老，略吵。室內空氣有點悶。
值得讚譽的是床墊，枕頭、被子超級！可以睡個好覺。
看得出服務人員還是很用心的，很努力幫助客人。基本上有求必應，特別是同意延遲退房很痛快！不過可能是培訓上不夠，門僮幫忙把行李從出租車上拿下來，就熱情地塞給客人，並不像其他豪華酒店那樣至少拿到大堂。中餐廳服務員少，略有點亂。

2、設施很老舊：武漢室外20度左右的天氣，房間體感28度，送來冰扇機衹涼了一會兒，又悶又熱，晚上熱醒很多次
3、服務態度欠佳：反應熱之後，雖然有送冰扇機，但説房間並不熱，言談間讓人感覺他們覺得客人在無理取鬧，溝通不愉快
4、訂得攜程含早房間，吃早餐時告知這個早餐不是一般自助早餐，衹是大堂吧一杯咖啡…最後是自己烏龍搞錯，但就覺得不是五星水準的服務

位置:旁邊就是長江，黃鶴樓户部巷、萬松園這些景點離得都挺近的，都很方便，離火車站也很近，半小時差不多可以到
設施:這家酒店算是老牌酒店了，開業也比較長時間了，整體設施設備有些老舊，但保養還可以，泳池這些配備都有👍
衞生:房間衞生很ok，房間佈局還比較有特色，酒店禁煙，這點對帶孩子的家庭出行很贊👍公共區域的衞生也保持的很好，打掃阿姨碰到了也會微笑打招呼
服務:服務周到，碰到的每個服務員都很熱情，面帶笑容，有問必答，給了我們一行很多幫助，讓我們對武漢多了一份美好的回憶，在這住感覺像回到了家一樣，總之十分推薦！

msg:酒店大堂富力堂皇，大廳中間巨大的水晶燈非常吸眼。前台背景是武漢歷史文化最負盛名的地標 黃鶴樓，中西合璧。另外酒店的燈光佈置很能體現整體品味，整體大堂色温很温和但不失明亮。晚上大廳會把燈光調的很暗，也很有氛圍。酒店的交通位置也特別好。房間也很乾凈整潔，住的非常舒服，服務員態度都特別好，特別是ella，服務很熱情，因為外面在下雨，還幫忙拿了雨傘。下次還要再來。

msg:一次非常不好的入住體驗

1. 下午4.20到店竟然告訴我 房間沒有打掃乾淨 需要等。在多次詢問後承諾半小時以內打掃乾淨… 本來下午到的晚 想要收拾一下行李 晚上可以出去逛逛～ 這一耽誤 下午的時間全都浪費了。
2. 有消費陷阱，玩文字遊戲～ 訂房間的時候看了大字介紹是 燈光秀江景 就想當然的定了 畢竟是大品牌 沒必要虛假宣傳～ 結果到了才知道 江景還分主江景和側江景～ 側江景 就是 打開窗户就是居民樓～ 能直接看到人家客廳內裝飾的距離！你要站在窗邊 完全側過身去才能看到一小綹江景。
3.早餐有失水準～品類少而不精 焗豆感覺直接就是從罐頭裡倒出來的 豆是豆 湯水是湯水～ 其他的就更不用説了。

反正就是很不建議個人出行來住～ 同等價位可以訂到更好的。

本身是萬豪de會員 住過多家威斯汀酒店 武漢的富力威斯汀屬於特別差的。

第一 14店到酒店 説還沒打掃出差 在酒店等到15店 還説沒收拾出來

第二 莫名其妙被扣按金 通常扣按金是有酒店消費 但是我沒有消費 至少你電話過來 告知一聲 不能自己就扣了

第三 就一個總機 衹記錄 不回覆也沒人聯繫

第四 屬於老酒店設施陳舊行政套房裡 還是32寸小電視。 其他設施和餐飲 與千元每晚的價位 相去甚遠。

第五 周邊都是施工工地 我住在23層 一大早 就是非常響施工聲音。

綜合來講特別差 建議考慮 其他豪華酒店

江景房可以説是武漢天花板了，正對長江，視野無敵。威斯汀的天夢之床也是最愛，每次都能休息的很好。強烈推薦

酒店的保潔也還可以就一個人打掃，沒有喧嘩。真的遇到過那種兩個人一組在走廊很吵的受不了。酒店整體相對安靜。
感謝經理贈送的早餐及第一天接待我的前台在有兩天新增人員後很有格局靈活的多加了一份。很會處理我們還覺得不好意思但是的確考慮客人便捷這麼靈活的前台不多見。
感謝威斯汀的服務！

所謂的三個行政酒廊服務其實沒東西，下午茶時間，下午2點到6點之間，衹有兩種餅乾，花生米葡萄乾，兩種水果，幾種飲料就沒了…下午茶需要單獨付費購買，行政酒廊沒有行政酒廊的職能了。説晚上6點才有。也是第一次見這樣的行政酒廊，也是大開眼界了。下圖中有行政酒廊下午茶階段的幾乎所有東西。
酒店沒有類似純牛奶這樣的基本的飲品可以購買。

msg:住了兩晚武漢新世界然後過來的，説一下兩家對比的感受。
新世界788含單早，威斯汀799不含早，同樣是在攜程訂的大床房，到店時間都是在晚上23點左右，新世界兩晚都主動升級了房型。威斯汀給我的是9樓，個人想住高一點，詢問能不能房型升級，前台拒絕了，後面我説在長沙威斯汀也會主動升級房型，前台説他要去申請看看，當時挺晚的，不確定申請後的結果，就説算了，但是的確有點影響入住體驗了。
床品來説，威斯汀偏軟，睡上去就塌下去了，個人不是很喜歡。新世界的床睡得就更舒服，房間還有空氣凈化器。
不過威斯汀外賣可以由機器人送到房間很方便。
早上起床晚了，12點15左右退房的，謝謝酒店沒有催退房。

msg:朋友一家從外地過來玩，擔心到店比較早房間沒打掃出來，就提前一天過來酒店希望提前溝通一下。本着試一試的原則，但結果出乎意料，在大堂碰到兩位經理熱情的招待了我，帥氣的王經理在瞭解了我的需求後第一時間與前台團隊溝通落實，讓我無比心安。周經理又添加了我的微信，告知第二天我朋友到店可以第一時間聯繫他，他來跟進入住事宜，最終整個入住非常順利，朋友一家也住得非常開心。
另外前台辦理入住的陳小姐也非常熱情地為我們介紹酒店的設施以及周邊好吃的好玩的景點，以後親朋好友過來會首選貴酒店！

入住其他其他的一些服務細節也是有板有眼，響應及時（加被子、更換蕎麥皮枕頭、下雨時增加房間用傘等）
總體而言，符合老五星酒店的服務品質，尤其在這個幾乎全民出行、房間爆滿的五一假期。

缺點：從硬件設施上達到了5星，但是細節上完全不行：
房卡出現故障。入住當天就有一張房卡刷不開門，給前台打電話倒是積極派人來解決，但在門口等了幾分鐘才把新房卡拿過來。而且最離譜的事，拿過來的新房卡刷不了電梯。另一張房卡能刷電梯但也開不了門。
早餐翻枱率慢。週末客人多，早餐時座位幾乎全部佔滿。但很多桌上明明客人已經離開但遲遲沒有收拾。
還有最後一個細節，房間門無法常開，門背後的磁鐵老化。
如果這是個4星或者便宜的5星也就算了，但一晚1k+的五星酒店如果細節還做不好是不是應該考慮降星了？

msg:1.服務：做為萬豪集團下的五星酒店，在服務上面略微顯得很小氣。我們是打算一大早6:50左右乘車出發前往東湖櫻花園，酒店早餐是6:30開始，需要服務員提供打包餐盒，此時不知是因為沒有培訓到位還是沒有做過這方面服務得預案，我們被告知衹能打包麪包，而水果、春捲、雞蛋等其他的乾糧不能被打包。其實我們就兩位，因時間沖忙需要打包，也不是大拿特拿，揮霍浪費，這點服務都沒有，給人感覺很不舒服。 
相比北京、廣州的萬豪集團酒店，因為早上趕時間，酒店是可以提供餐盒打包，也沒被告知衹能打包前台的麪包，希望以後可以改進！

2.早餐品種：早餐品種真的很一般，衹能説該有的都有，比較簡單，但是品質算不上五星級，水果衹有兩種新鮮水果，橘子和人蔘果，其他的是罐頭食品，鮮切的有三種，酸奶不是瓶裝，需要自己盛的，唯一覺得可以的就是有武漢特色熱乾麪和燙粉。

3.位置：酒店位置還可以，在臨江大道，環境清幽，可以步行前往長江堤岸，但是距離積玉橋地鐵站距離有一丟丟遠，而且附近在修地鐵，需要走小路。

msg:誠懇的評分，是希望能有所改進。威斯汀是我心中的老牌五星酒店，這次入住的整體體驗四星。前期預訂溝通和入住後的客房服務我給3星，一線服務人員服務態度總體比較熱情，3星給的是服務水平。其中前期溝通如果沒有攜程的幫忙，酒店彷彿始終無法get客人的需求🤷，而客房服務接線人員，可以説是熱情禮貌，但對客人的要求轉頭就忘..另外，我原本訂的是豪華大床房，因為攜程的溝通，酒店升級了行政樓層，説實話房間其實差別不大，並沒有額外驚喜的體驗。這次因為行程原因到店很晚，目前住過的一些新興酒店，都會有一些夜床暖心服務，比如幫你放好浴缸的水，或者床頭的熱牛奶。這一點上，人性化上老牌五星酒店也該跟上腳步了。

msg:鑒於酒店裝修年代久遠，各種設施陳舊可以理解，酒店早餐90元，但取餐點擁擠，並且食物補充緩慢。前台人員推薦使用攜程訂房，但攜程訂房並無優惠，且開具發票流程繁瑣。同等價位，該酒店並非首選。

msg:酒店已經開業11年了，根本就不是2019年裝修過，為什麼堂堂國際五星還要靠騙人來入住，攜程真的越來越差了，投訴之後客服人員説私人給我200元補助，為什麼要難為一個個人行為，做道德綁架，設施破舊不堪，管理素質差，住過最差的威斯丁、沒有之一，
