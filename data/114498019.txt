The hotel is stylish and the room is clean, spacious and very comfortable. The staffs were friendly.

It will be great if they can include coffee machine and full-body big mirror in the room.

And add clear signage for cars to get in as our taxi drivers always make the wrong side and missed the entrance.

msg:Due to weather conditions in Guangzhou, the flight was delayed, so I decided to stay in Guangzhou for another night. So I found the New World Hotel not far from the airport on Ctrip. Let me talk about the good aspects first. 
1. When I arrived, the guy downstairs was very enthusiastic to help open the door and guide me to check in. 
2. Because I was with a child, the front desk staff took the initiative to provide children's toiletries. 
3. When I shuttled around the hotel, the service staff would take the initiative to greet me and ask about my needs, which made me feel comfortable and happy. 
4. The hard facilities in the guest room are good, and the entrance is divided into three parts, dry and wet. There is a small entrance hall designed for home, and a glass door is added in the sleeping area and the bathroom area. The hotel's sound insulation and privacy are very good. 
The bad aspects, 
1. There is no A4 paper in the guest room, and enough drinking water (the water is in a paper box), so you need to call the service center actively. 
2. Although the room lights have intelligent control, they are stupid and difficult to use. Many buttons conflict with each other, and the curtains are still manual at this price, which is very puzzling (all national brands under Huazhu can achieve automatic curtains). I accept it, but it can't be difficult to use, which reduces the comfort of staying.
3. The system actually rejected my late check-out permission on Ctrip. Fortunately, I took the initiative to call the service center and solved the problem.
I hope that the hotel management can optimize the small details in the future, and I wish it will get better and better.

msg:Let me give you the conclusion first. This is a hotel that really surprised me and made me fall in love with it. It is the best hotel I have stayed in in 2024.

[Hardware]
Because it may be a new hotel, the hardware is very good. The New World Hotel is under the Rosewood Group, so the decoration style and some toiletries are similar to the style of Rosewood. I will give you a few examples of how good the hardware is. The water in the room is not bottled water, but natural mineral water in a very high-quality paper box. The hair dryer is from Lefen, with a market price of about 600 yuan. It feels similar to Dyson. The yoga mat in the gym is from Lululemon, and the price is also around 600 yuan.

【Service】
This is consistent with most of the comments on Ctrip. It is very good and meticulous. First of all, when you arrive at the hotel entrance, there are staff to help you take your suitcase to the elevator entrance. Because check-in is done on the 9th floor, after that, the front desk staff will take you to the elevator entrance to the guest room. When eating breakfast, from entering the restaurant to sitting down, there are service staff at every distance within sight, such as helping you with tableware, pouring coffee, etc. The response speed is very fast. One thing I hope to improve is that the speed of collecting meals is too fast. I haven't finished eating yet, and when I went to get something, it was collected. The most impressive thing is that no matter where you are, the hotel staff will smile when they look at you or meet you. Smile can bring people closer, in any corner of the world.

【Food and surrounding environment】
This is an aspect that I care about when choosing a hotel. I really like breakfast. All the ingredients can only be described in three words: just right. Take the food I ate as an example, seafood porridge, the porridge was cooked just right, with fried dough sticks, the fried dough sticks were not oily or dry, the egg rolls were just right in size, style, and saltiness, the orange juice was not too sweet (most orange juices are very sweet), the fried noodles and bacon were not too oily, and the bread was freshly baked, basically comparable to the bakery. The most unexpected thing is that you can order freshly made banana muffins, which are both beautiful and delicious. The interior environment of the restaurant is warm and cozy, and the exterior is a floor-to-ceiling window with a good view.

The hotel is surrounded by mountains and has good green plants, so when you are in the room, gym, and restaurant, the visual range is green, which makes people feel relaxed and happy

The above is my feeling, I will definitely stay here a second time.

msg:The HBA design of the newly opened Guangzhou New World Hotel still has many shadows of Guangzhou's magnificence, but the colors are also much younger and richer. Rather than saying that it is the replacement of Rosewood, it is better to say that it is a slightly simplified (not reduced) youth version of Rosewood, which is very suitable for weekend staycation to eat and drink in the hotel.

The location and view are indeed average, the room decoration is similar to that of a magnificent mansion; the food is as good as the magnificent one; the service is simply much better.

This time I stayed in an executive suite. The circulation was very good, from the living room to the bedroom, through the open cloakroom in the corridor, and to the bathroom. It was a very homely experience.

The service attitude of colleagues in all depar**ents of the hotel is very good. Whether it is the bellboy who gets out of the car to help carry the luggage, to the front office, to various restaurants, and to the housekeeping, they are all very enthusiastic and attentive. In particular, Wilson and Cynthia in the front office, and Alan on the other side, made everyone feel as comfortable and warm as home, which left a deep impression.

But when I actually arrived, it was not the case.
Some bloggers on Ctrip claimed "luxury in the clouds"?
Excuse me?
Did those bloggers get the magnificence of New World wrong? It's not Baiyun New World, right?
Those who posted it, don't say you have stayed there. Please take a look... What is a 15-story hotel in the clouds? Are you wandering in your mind?
The room facilities are very ordinary, no bathtub, no teapot, no wine glasses...
The room is probably slightly better than Yado. That's all.
The location is extremely bad. It is claimed to be the first choice for business travel online? Haha, everyone in Guangzhou knows that Yongtai and Mawu, when did they become the first choice for business travel?
Surrounded by residential areas and urban villages... That's it, one time is enough, I won't choose it again next time.

msg:The hotel has complete facilities and the rooms are comfortable and clean. It's a pity that the service of the staff is too assembly line. The hotel does not have a restaurant or delivery service at night. If you order takeout, you have to go to the first floor to get it! The hotel has two robots, and they would rather leave them empty than help bring the takeout! I called and asked and they said there was no room delivery service! I can only say that most of the other hotels in Guangzhou have the service of robots bringing it up. This is not difficult to deal with. Does it have to remain unchanged? It is not good to go down to get takeout at night. If you go down to get it in pajamas, it will affect your image, right? It is not humane at all! There is also a damp smell in the corridor of the guest room. I don’t know if it has rained heavily in Guangzhou recently. The hotel can add some aromatherapy to be better.

msg:I had a good impression of Qingyuan New World, so I chose the newly opened one for a few days. Compared with the Japanese hot spring hotel style of Qingyuan branch, this one is more modern and youthful.
Facilities: The room is not small, and the retro iron glass door divides it into two parts. The entrance is the cloakroom and washing and makeup area. The inner opening is the living and bedroom area, with a bar and sofa, so that the whole family can easily find a comfortable position, and the floor-to-ceiling glass has a transparent view. The bed in the double room is against the wall on both sides, which is suitable for a family with two children. There are enough sockets, the location is reasonable, and it is also equipped with charging cables with multiple interfaces.
Environment: Although it is located in the suburbs, the hotel belongs to the newly built area, and the nearby residential areas are not dirty and messy. You can reach the subway station along a commercial area. The journey is not short, but the experience is okay.
Service: Two sets of children's products, including slippers and toiletries, were delivered immediately when checking in. Because we asked the hotel staff to open the window for ventilation, electric mosquito liquid was also delivered immediately. Candy and greeting cards were also sent later. The staff are polite and the restaurant service is timely. The staff of Yan Restaurant are enthusiastic and friendly.

2. It is a new hotel, and the facilities are very new. I like the style of the hotel: clean, dry, warm and cozy, and the supplies inside are very tasteful.
3. The mattress is relatively comfortable, not too soft and collapses, and makes you feel safe when lying on it.
4. The design of the bathroom separates the toilet area, wash area, and shower area. The space is large and very clean. The hygienic environment must be maintained to this extreme.
5. The hotel is equipped with a Dyson hair dryer. In short, I was impressed.
6. The front desk, cleaning staff, and waiters all smile politely and say hello when they meet. I also like this. In today's society, there is too little interaction between people.
7. There is a charger at the bedside, which is very considerate. You don’t have to worry about forgetting to bring the charger.
8. I ordered a takeaway and the robot delivered it to my door, but the robot didn't seem to knock on the door. I waited for a long time.
9. The hotel is the poetry of the neighborhood and the distance. I simply need an environment to rest, sleep well, eat well, and feel comfortable.
10. What I like most is the free parking.

msg:Overall a very good stay!
Location: A little out of the way, but the surrounding area is very popular and very popular. There is actually a market on the street next to it, with stalls set up on the roadside. I like it very much.
Hardware: The hotel's hardware, decoration, and design have surpassed most hotels of the same level. As a sub-brand of Rosewood, New World not only has many shadows of Rosewood, but also retains some of Rosewood's control over quality and a**osphere.
The bedding in the room feels a little higher than the average five-star hotel. There is no bathtub, but the glass door is very good and the sound insulation is high-end. The furniture in the room is modern and simple, and the colors, patterns and designs are more homely, warm and comfortable. , relaxing, small and slightly exquisite, all the displays and containers can be seen to have been carefully selected. The wardrobe and under the sink are all hollowed out, giving a better sense of space. Personally, I like this new style of design.
A**osphere: Green plants and flowers are used very well. There are many large green plants in the light-toned environment of the public area, and flowers are also placed in many places, which are just right.
The lighting is also good. There are many floor lamps, wall lamps, and chandeliers, which create the overall a**osphere. The only thing I think is that the lighting is too bright. It would be more advanced if it was darker (personally).
Music, I didn’t pay much attention to the music when I arrived on the first floor, the lobby on the 9th floor, the lobby bar, the guest room aisle, and the elevator. However, when I had breakfast in the morning, the music in the restaurant was very good, and it was very suitable for the restaurant environment, giving a relaxed and cozy feeling.
Service: When arriving and leaving, the young man on the first floor was polite and proactive. The person who checked in should be Director Li. Bieber's service was good. When the elevator encountered a glitch when I arrived, he immediately comforted me and told me that the hotel was checking in. They repaired it and arranged a room with a better location for me. They were very sincere and professional. They called me one hour after checking in to ask about the room situation and if there was any need for assistance. They also asked about the check-in situation when they left. The smile was very sincere (no I understand why employees don’t wear work badges (you won’t know their names if you don’t ask, and you won’t necessarily remember them if you ask). The female employees at the front desk on the first and second days were not so proactive and enthusiastic. On the contrary, the male employees were more enthusiastic.
Restaurant: Western restaurant, breakfast is good and rich, much higher than ordinary five-star quality, especially the quality of food. The furnishings of the restaurant are very comfortable, the decoration and green plants are just right, with magnificent shadows (commendation), service staff and chefs, It's ok, it would be better to be more proactive and enthusiastic (don't imitate Huali's aloofness for this), the warm service is easy to perceive, just like Bieber at the front desk, sincerity is just right. The tableware, containers, and items in the western restaurant can be seen to be carefully selected.
I visited the lobby bar. The environment is very comfortable, the bar is exquisite, and the little sister is more enthusiastic. I haven’t tried the products yet, so I’ll try it next time.
I only visited the Chinese restaurant. It was very good and a shadow of the beauty, but more compact. The person who led me should be the manager, a man who was very proactive, enthusiastic and professional.
The guy at the fitness center was very proactive and enthusiastic in his service. Although he was a little green, he was very professional and I was impressed by his dedication. He introduced almost all the facilities to me, and he was patient and attentive.
The self-service check-in machine at the front desk (although I have never used it), paperless check-in, and robot delivery are all respected and recognized by the younger generation. As a new hotel, they have done a good job.
This stay at Guangzhou New World Hotel completely changed my perception of the New World Hotel brand, and even made me look at it with admiration. Overall, it is really good!
Of course, there are still some flaws in the service details. For example, the operator said that the takeout can be delivered to the room by a robot. When the takeout arrived, I asked the concierge on the first floor and said that it would take 20 minutes if I used a robot. I saw three or four robots, but later I said I would pick it up myself. I left it at the front desk. I went to the front desk on the 9th floor and asked a female employee. She said she didn’t know and asked me to go to the first floor. But when I went to the first floor, the concierge helped me take it out of the robot. When I entered the elevator, I saw that it was not mine, so I went down again. I asked on the floor, and then the concierge accompanied me to the front desk on the 9th floor. It turned out to be in the cabinet at the front desk. I asked a few minutes ago and said I didn’t know.
OK, not much to say about other minor flaws. Hope this hotel gets better and better.

The ingredients are very fresh and there are many choices, but not mixed. Each choice is on the apex of the customer. The taste is very good, far exceeding the average five-star hotel. The croissant series is very delicious, and the refreshments are also very good. For this breakfast, I will go again. The gym has complete equipment, as well as leg stretching equipment. The guy in the gym will also guide you to use these equipment. Love it. There are also supermarkets around the hotel, and it is also convenient to eat. It is indeed a product of the New World and is trustworthy.

msg:Extraordinary experience, home-like warmth - my cost-effective choice in Guangzhou

Among the star-studded hotel clusters in Guangzhou, the New World Hotel is like a shining pearl. Although it is far away from the bustling city center and Jiahe Wanggang subway station, its excellent service and superb hardware facilities are like a glorious halo, making all these distances pale in comparison. I have no hesitation in rating it as the top cost-effective hotel I have experienced in Guangzhou.

This time, traveling with my father, we deliberately chose this brand hotel that is well-known in Hong Kong and has recently opened grandly. With a little curiosity in anticipation, we stepped into the door of the New World Hotel. As it turns out, this place not only meets our expectations, but also adds countless warm memories to our journey with its ingenious service.

A small booking misunderstanding also became the beginning of our service experience. I originally thought that the reservation included two breakfasts, but it turned out to be another solution. However, when this little episode was conveyed to the front desk, they not only did not blame us, but generously added a breakfast for us with great tolerance and understanding. This unexpected surprise made us deeply feel the warmth and thoughtfulness of the New World Hotel.

Everything in the room is full of artistic a**osphere. Every detail and every decoration reveals the hotel's pursuit and love of beauty. The design of the space cleverly uses the separation of doors to maintain privacy while maintaining a sense of openness. The toilet and wash basin from a well-known American brand are not only of high quality, but also first-class comfort, making every use a kind of enjoyment.

As a traveler who is very particular about hairstyles, the high-efficiency hair dryer provided in the hotel room is undoubtedly a powerful assistant for me to take care of my hairstyle. This care for details makes me feel relaxed when I am ready to go out. And the quality drinks selected in the mini bar make me feel warm in my heart when I enjoy them, as if I am in the comfortable environment of my own home.

For me, a fitness enthusiast, the world-class brand fitness equipment in the hotel's fitness room is undoubtedly a tribute to me. Every sweat is responded to with the most thoughtful response, and every muscle stretch is full of a sense of accomplishment.

Even though I felt a little disappointed because of the small omission of the razor on the first night, the hotel's quick response and remedy afterwards were like a timely spring breeze, which resolved all the waiting. This quick response to guest needs once again confirmed the efficiency and professionalism of New World Hotel's service.

msg:I stayed at New World on my birthday. I originally wanted to stay in a more urban area, but it seemed that there were recent events in Guangzhou and many hotels were unavailable. However, I booked a satisfactory hotel by mistake. First of all, let’s talk about the service. I feel that the staff are all young, the handsome guys and beauties are really eye-catching, and the service attitude is very good. Whether it is the Chinese restaurant, the front desk, the doorman (I don’t think I said that, don’t mind if I am wrong), and even the cleaning aunt is very polite. Very nice. I called a day in advance to understand my needs, upgraded the room type and sent a cake. Regarding the room, since it was upgraded to a courtyard room, it has a large balcony. The weather is not too hot yet, so it is quite comfortable to sit. Although the room is not luxurious, I like its simplicity and elegance, especially the light green tiles in the bathroom, which are very nice. The 2-meter big bed can be rolled around casually, and the Bose stereo is connected to play music in the morning. It shouldn't be too wonderful to welcome the new day. The breakfast is small but refined, and the products are similar to those at Mandarin Oriental. Although not as rich, it is still good and the price is right. Went to Yifang for lunch. The barbecued pork was the best I have eaten this year. I will repurchase it! The shortcomings are probably that it is far from the city and the surrounding scenery is average😅. But if I’m driving by myself and like to stay in a hotel and don’t need to go out much, I think it’s a good choice. Then I feel that the hotel should be positioned as an affordable luxury hotel, suitable for the young middle class. It is probably not suitable for wealthy people who need family travel. It has been included in the Treasure Hotel. I also hope that the hotel will get better and better and that the employees will receive a salary increase😄.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I took my mother and daughter to Guangzhou for six days. I stayed at New World for the whole trip. I chose this hotel based on reviews of the new opening, the Rosewood brand, and Dyson hair dryers. The location actually feels a bit far for travel, as it is not far from the Jiahe subway station. Wanggang is also about fifteen minutes away, and we only took the subway once. The key point is that during the Spring Festival, the prices of Four Seasons, Rosewood, and Indigo in the city center have been sold to 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a day, which is outrageous, so I can only accept the New World from afar. The hotel is brand new and there is nothing wrong with it. The concierge's service is very good. They open the door and send it to the elevator. The front desk service is also very attentive. Our room is on the 11th floor. The hotel's breakfast is very delicious. The variety is quite complete, combining Chinese and Western styles to meet the needs of all tastes. . Express takeout is delivered upstairs by robots, and sometimes the delivery rush is slower at night. But I would like to say a few minor issues. First, there is a charge for laundry. There is no self-service laundry. As a result, we had to take all our clothes home to wash. It was very annoying. A five-star hotel actually charges for laundry. Second, the hotel personally paid for it before checking in. I called to confirm the information and was told that children's toiletries would be prepared for my daughter, but I didn't see them when I got to the room. I had to call the front desk myself to deliver them. Although they were delivered quickly, I had to rush them myself, which didn't feel good. Third, there is no indoor swimming pool. The climate in Guangzhou at this time is not suitable, so my daughter cannot swim. The overall evaluation is good, except that the location is a bit far, and a taxi to the scenic spots is basically between 40-60. For reference.

The room is large and the decoration is simple but warm. The room does not include breakfast, but it is added. The quality level is high. Smoked salmon is also available. Order banana pancake. The staff service is also good. I found out that I arrived at 12 in the evening. There are still professional staff reception from the door to the lobby. Overall, I am very satisfied and will bring my family to experience it next time.

The hotel room was very large, and the mini bar on the first night was free. The water cups, coffee cups, and kettles were all very nice and tasteful.
Because the temperature was not high enough, I didn't go swimming. The swimming pool has a special children's pool, and there is also a hot spring in the locker room.
The balcony is very large, and it should be very good to sit on the sofa chair and blow the wind.

msg:It is a very pleasant hotel. The lobby is on the 9th floor, but there is a doorman on the ground floor. He is very responsible and helps with luggage. You can feel the good training of the hotel in his words and deeds. Especially when I arrived at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, every employee at the front desk still treated me with the best attitude. I really felt at home. According to my request, I arranged the room closest to the elevator. I was actually prepared to be noisy, but the soundproofing was very good and very quiet. Needless to say, the room is clean and tidy. The retro-style decoration is very popular with me, especially the bathroom separation is quite thoughtful. The bar is even more popular with me. During a conference call, my foreign colleagues can ask me where I am. , I also showed off the water in the paper packaging, it’s so cute~
It's a pity that I was in a hurry for both nights this time and didn't experience the rest in detail. I hope I can take it more leisurely next time. Oh, by the way, the shower gel smells so good that I forgot to ask if I could buy it...
However, there is one small detail that would be great if it could be improved. When taking a taxi, the taxi driver seems to overdrive, causing me to park on the road outside and I have to walk in. Is it possible to set up an additional drive-in terminal on the roadside leading to the lobby? Guidance signs make it easier for drivers to find their way.

After checking in, the room did remain airy and smell-free. I also prepared an extra body lotion (I learned from the housekeeper that I needed it)
I came to Guangzhou specially to eat delicious food and stayed for two nights. The staff greeted me politely throughout the whole process. The room has wet and dry separation (there are two sinks) and the Chinese and Western buffet breakfast is great! The gym facilities are also very advanced.

In short, I will choose this restaurant next time I come to Guangzhou.

Guangzhou New World Hotel is a new project of Guangzhou Rosewood
Inherited the exquisiteness of Rosewood staff uniforms

The room amenities are a combination of environmental protection and Muji style, very textured
The service is much better than Rosewood
Except that it is located in Jiahe Wanggang, it is too far from the city
It is really good compared to other hotels at this price

msg:Three advantages and one disadvantage
1. In the guest room, from the duck in the entrance to the bathroom space with azure glaze as the keynote, to the streamlined yet elegant bedroom, it has a magnificent shadow and the youthful vitality of a new hotel. The details are in place. The shower head has a stable water flow. There will be no water splashing on the floor tiles. The room is fully equipped with everything from toiletries to laundry bags and shopping bags. It maintains a stable five-star standard. I stayed in a deluxe king bed. The city view is not as good as the cloud view of the three-piece suit with a small waist, but it is mid-range. The urban scenery with the axis extending to both sides is more down-to-earth. The only flaw is that the corridor looks a bit like a Hanting courtyard.
2. The buffet bar in the restaurant has a light luxury style and the variety and quality of the food. The pineapples are really sweet and there will be someone to help you mix the salad. Even in some luxury hotels, the attentive waiters will move around and clear away the bone plates in time. The excellent service reminds me of the Westin when I was at Starwood
3. In the service section, special thanks to Ms. Elaine from the reservation depar**ent for preparing a small surprise and trying her best to help me solve all my needs before check-in. Every staff member from the welcome to the front desk to the cleaning is serving with a smile. If you give a metaphor to a hotel, This new world is like a young lady who always wears high heels and is always fully dressed, full of elegance and intelligence.
The final shortcoming is that there are too few people in the hotel. A good hotel should be discovered by more guests. Apart from its poor location, it is still a very cost-effective hotel at the same level. It is difficult to find rivals. This time I did not experience the hotel due to the weather. The elevated floor is a small pity. This is a good hotel that is very suitable for young people's first impression. Finally, if you stay in a 400-yuan express hotel, you might as well spend an extra 200 to experience luxurious service. Life is your own and be kind to yourself.

In comparison, although the New World Hotel is a little further away, the price is about the same as hotels such as All Seasons during the same period, but the stay experience is completely different. The 2-meter large bed, brand-new decoration, warm and considerate services (front desk, concierge, restaurant and guest rooms) all made us very happy. The hotel is about 15 minutes' walk from the subway station. The breakfast at the hotel is very rich. The first round of drinks in the room is free. Will definitely stay here next time.

msg:Found Guangzhou New World Hotel by accident

During the Spring Festival, the price of a room is only HK$1,000, which is really affordable.

As soon as I entered the room, I was really surprised. I wonder if it is related to the same group as the Rosewood Hotel in Hong Kong. The slippers have the same fluffy lining as the Rosewood Hotel in Hong Kong and are very comfortable.

There is no bottled water, but boxed water is used instead.

The service couldn't be better. When we were taking pictures in the lobby, the receptionist sister took the initiative to come and asked if we could take a photo for us. Every employee took the initiative to say hello and say Happy New Year. The luggage will be carried to the room for help.

The breakfast is really the best I have ever had in a hotel in Guangzhou. The bread is baked on site, sausages, eggs, pancakes, waffles are all freshly made, and there are snacks...

The only drawback is that it is quite far from the subway station, and it is difficult to get a taxi during the Spring Festival. I went out on the morning of the first day of the new year and couldn't get a taxi. I had to accept the reality and walk to the subway station. Even if I chose an expensive car and the price increased, I couldn't get a taxi. Maybe The location is too remote

During the check-in process, I followed up on the check-in feedback and recommended many delicious restaurants.

msg:Guangzhou has a new super treasure hotel for city vacation! ! !
This hotel is located near Jiahe Wanggang, Baiyun District, Guangzhou City. This area is said to be built to create Baiyun New City's own "Guangdong World". The surrounding supporting facilities are very complete, and restaurants, shopping malls and shopping are all within walking distance.
We checked in for one day just in time for the hotel's new opening. As soon as you enter the door, you can feel that the design and layout of the hotel are very exquisite and elegant! The aesthetics are first-rate, with colors and artworks in every corner, and there are so many scenes and angles that you can take any photo.
The hotel's front desk is on the 9th floor, and as soon as the elevator door opens, several employees come forward to welcome us. The lady in charge of receiving us, Rachael, was very enthusiastic and meticulous. She went through the check-in procedure very efficiently. She also took us all the way to the guest room and gave a comprehensive explanation and introduction to the guest room. like!
The room is comfortable and spacious, with a warm feeling at home. Bose speakers are used in the living room, mini bar is free to use, Marlin dog care is used in the bath, and the suite is equipped with Dyson's latest hair dryer! My wife was so happy when she saw it~ We could briefly explore the lobby bar on the 9th floor. The environment and privacy are excellent. I heard that the coffee is very good, but it’s a pity that I don’t have enough time to try it. Well, I will definitely do it next time!

Breakfast is a la carte, with both Chinese and Western styles. To be honest, I haven’t had an English breakfast in a long time. , all in all, very cost-effective, highly recommended!

msg:Outstanding is my only comment. Thirty minutes' drive from Zhujiang New Town starts the staycation of the newly opened "Guangzhou New World Hotel" at 2D1N. The "Yifang Chinese Restaurant" on the first floor of the hotel serves Guang Yu Xuan's standard. Shunde milk white porridge is paired with crispy fried milk slices and rich raw milk slices. The porridge is really satisfying. The mixed vegetables are served in chicken soup made from scallops and shrimps, which is really surprising. The restaurant is positioned to be more people-friendly, but the product and service are absolutely top-notch. "Nanshe" has no merit, and I hope it will be limited to Baiyun. Even if it does not use high-end ingredients, it will at least have some changes, so that it will not be just a replacement for "Patina". The most frequently used word in "Guangzhou New World Hotel" is "Miss Qu". I feel that everyone in all depar**ents knows my next reservation. The day before check-in, GSO will add WeChat to understand the needs. During the stay, everyone has just the right information. Serve. After checking in, there will be a follow up to ask for opinions on the service. Outstanding is my only comment. Special thanks to GSO Rachel for her service.

msg:Ten miles away from Nanjing Road, a new world! The last time I stayed at New World was Beijing New World 7 or 8 years ago, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Yangcheng again. The design of the hotel is full of Lingnan elements, and it is very online as a Rosewood Group brand. The bedding in the room is very nice, the thread count of the linen is slightly less, Dyson is the standard bathroom equipment, and the Marlin dog's care is a plus. It’s a good experience to choose Bosch and Samsung for audio and video systems. 10 points for service. Special thanks to Ms. Tan for her professional service, which was meticulous and refreshing. And Ms. Gu was very considerate in helping me clean the leftover T-shirt. It is understandable that a newly opened hotel can provide such a level of service. You must still choose New World next time! Looking forward to the production of Guang Yuxuan team.

Sure enough, not only does it have magnificent hardware, but the service here is warmer and definitely better. All the products and the details of the room really feel the management's care. When it comes to catering, there are really surprises in terms of ingredients, products, and services, and there is also delicious wine☺️. The details and supplies in the guest rooms are also absolutely in place. I am someone who can never make do with coffee and hair dryers. , and as expected, it comes with my favorite coffee, Dyson hair dryer. This is definitely the best hotel in Baiyun. At this price, staying at Baiyun Little Rosewood is really not too cost-effective☀️

Although there is no night view of Zhujiang New Town, the night view of Baiyun New Town is also very beautiful when looking at the sunset. There is a mature business district around, so shopping and eating are not a problem. The Chinese restaurant is on the first floor, with guaranteed food, and the Western restaurant is on the 9th floor, with a foreign chef in charge. Very cost-effective hotel

The overall facilities and equipment of the hotel rooms are very good, and the price-performance ratio can be said to be extremely high. I didn’t expect that during this stay, I would be able to experience a Dyson hairdryer and a Bose soundbar😍I also encountered a robot to help deliver supplies haha🤖

The service is even more surprising ❤️ When booking, I mentioned that I would bring children to stay. In addition to the carefully prepared welcome cards and gifts, the room was also thoughtfully prepared with a variety of children's amenities, from children's toiletries to slippers and bathrobes. , and there is also a super cute little tent➕little gift🎁The children will not want to leave when they have fun🤣

My first stay has completely raised my expectations. I hope to come back soon to experience it next time💫

When I checked in, I provided my name and confirmation number, but they said there was no such booking information. I confirmed with Ctrip many times, and the reply was confirmed successfully. Finally, it was found out that the front desk entered the wrong information for my query, and it kept coming. I was told to wait and checked into another room the next day. At four o'clock in the morning, four people were chatting loudly in the next room and no one was paying attention. I don't know if it was because of the loud noise or poor sound insulation. I could hear the sound of showering and flushing the toilet in the next room.

msg:Comment on the following points:
1. As a newly opened hotel, it is not very intelligent.
2. The hotel process is quite immature. For example, when delivering a takeout, the front desk informed the delivery person that he could help deliver it to the room. After waiting for almost half an hour, it still didn’t arrive. He was told that there were too many takeaways and could not be delivered in time? !
3. The hotel's public relations capabilities are quite weak. It cannot be said to be unprofessional. At least it has not received any formal training. There is no solution for dissatisfied customers. What's the point of making this after-sales call? Will customers accept it?
4. After checking out, the hotel did not take the initiative to inform the guests of the things left behind. Instead, they called and asked before saying they had them? After checking out, wouldn’t it be discovered when the room is being cleaned? Still have other plans. (I also accept express delivery)

除了區位略微偏一些，到景點比較遠以外，基本可以説是完美。
房間設計開闊舒適，用品馬林狗子，礦泉水，迷你吧，都很有品。
早餐很好吃，中餐西餐餐點非常好吃，中餐推薦麪條，西餐必須試試麪包，酥非常細，層次感特別好，就是冷了影響脆度，但是依然能嚐出美味。
健身房有史密斯，基本功能算是齊全吧。
兩個有待改進的地方：
一是毛巾掉絮，二是廁所雖然分區但是沒有通風。
下次還會再來住～～

msg:在春節期間，800+的價格住在新世界真的不錯，位置對於自駕的遊客也非常非常友好，停車方便，周邊環境也很不錯，應該是類新區，開車去其他區近。
房間設計蠻漂亮，布草乾淨舒適，服務響應很快但是落實有點慢估計這兩天人太多了。
非常值得一提的是三餐，南舍餐廳的早餐品類豐富味道好吃，選品也很大方，卡仕酸奶無限供應真的捨得下本了。一樓的一方餐廳也是很棒，比小紅書大眾點評推薦的所有粵菜都要好吃，人均不算太低但是很值得。
整個酒店服務對帶娃家庭來説都是很舒適的，離店回訪也很用心，會為客户特殊需要做備註，讓我很想返程再住看看，節假日這個價格住小瑰麗，閉眼沖它！

msg:特別特別特別優秀
辦理入住和退房時候的工作人員都非常棒
每個人都很客氣，見到會主動打招呼
辦理入住後會把客人帶到房間門口，很貼心
衞生很不錯，設施也不錯，洗漱用品是馬林狗子的，很用心了
而且比較意外的是，牙刷不像別的酒店（如ritz，君悦，康萊德等等等）那麼硬，還挺舒服的
不管幾點回來，都會見到工作人員在地下停車場入口附近指引
唯一的不足就是地下停車場的充電樁有的車輛識別不了，沒能充了電，相信很快會調試好。

因為來的時候是春節期間，所以廣州許多有名的餐廳都不開，無意間發現酒店的一方餐廳，抱着試一試的態度，結果令人驚喜。
菜品非常非常好吃，服務人員都很温柔，説話軟軟的，添茶非常及時
一方真的很很很很好吃，如果不是今天趕飛機，真的想午餐也在這裏吃

一家好的酒店真的會給一趟旅程加很多分，如果有機會再來廣州，還會選擇這裏。

衞生：春節人很多，房間打掃的挺乾淨，安心！
環境：酒店很新環境沒話説，但好像地理位置有點偏，附近沒什麼好吃好玩的，需要打車一段路。
服務：前台小哥哥姐姐温柔周到。
不足：訂的顯示有早餐，但竟然一個房間衹有一份，有點不合理，望改進！

msg:年前假期第一站選擇了吃喝玩樂的廣州，本着住新不住舊的理念，在一眾新酒店中選擇了新世界。由於航班延誤的原因，凌晨三點才到店。和前台提了一嘴能不能升房，就爽快的升級到了帶陽台的庭院大床房。
👍優點：
1、房間是套房的形式，審美很高級，洗護是馬林狗子，衞生間和浴室分別在兩邊，使用起來非常的舒服。衞生間鏡子採光極好，化粧再也不用擔心看不清楚了。
2、床品高級手感佳，床頭的音箱加分。房間很大，兩個人住超級舒服。
3、早餐西式選擇蠻多的，西點很美味。
4、服務態度好，也很在乎住客的反饋。
❌缺點：
1、餐廳服務人員應該要佩戴好口罩，不然感覺不夠衞生。
2、距離地鐵站太遠了😂最好定時有車送去地鐵站，不然對遊客不太友好，因為遠離市區。
3、説好的戴森吹風機，結果説是套房才有，這個很掉價。
總體還是性價比很高的酒店，如果可以配車去地鐵站，還會選擇再次入住。

房間感覺舒適，可惜淋浴設施不是很理想，水壓很小，可調熱度也不夠；
洗髮水、護髮素、淋浴乳是卡在一個架上，而且每次只能取出很少的份量，很不人性化。

酒店的自助早餐選項不算很多，最出色的是烘焙部分，有多種選擇而且很好吃，
必吃的是即場製作的香蕉鬆餅，師傅的手勢一流，非常驚艷及美味。

再通過攜程修改預訂提前一天離店，居然就直接被酒店拒絕了，被我打電話一頓質問，還堅持説不能修改訂單。
