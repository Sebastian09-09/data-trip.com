There is a walking trail along the river outside, but there are no trees. You can have morning tea or order dishes in the Chinese restaurant on the second floor. The taste and production are good, and the price is affordable by White Swan's standards. The buffet in the evening is Southeast Asian themed, which is good.

msg:I stayed in a hotel of White Swan Group in Meizhou before. I didn't dare to go far with my baby during the May Day holiday, so I chose the White Swan Caiyi Hotel in Lishui. There were too many guests on May Day. I arrived in the morning. The front desk service was a gentle girl who helped contact the aunt who did the cleaning to finish the cleaning as soon as possible so that we could check in early. The children's facilities in the room also made the baby very happy. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all served in the hotel. The price was reasonable and the taste was good. If you take your baby out, Foshan White Swan Caiyi Hotel is a good choice.

However, there are many shortcomings: it is inconvenient to enter and exit, the surrounding roads are relatively narrow, and surrounding residents are still blocking one side. The internal roads are relatively wide. At this time, it should be possible to enter and exit from both sides, but it has to be entered and exited in one direction. It also passes through a very narrow riverside road. I don't know how to consider it. I stayed a few times and it always made me unhappy because of this. I hope the hotel can design it well and not let all the old customers abandon it.

msg:This weekend, my family came to Foshan to play, because the White Swan brand chose this Caiyi Hotel, and the reason is that they like Guangzhou White Swan very much. The hotel is very new, the decoration style is fresh, and the hardware is quite good. Children like to play in the swimming pool.
It is a pity that the hotel service is very general and can be said to be poor. From checkin at the front desk to dining in the restaurant before leaving, there is almost nothing satisfactory. Traveling from Shenzhen to Foshan on weekends was very congested. It took almost four hours to arrive, and my family was already very tired. Check-in was only at about 9 o'clock in the evening. There were at least 5 people at the front desk including the manager. At that time, there were only about 3 families checking in, but the efficiency was very slow ~ it took about 20 minutes. Tell the waiter not to give the room to Wei, because there are two elderly people over 80 years old, Cantonese are very particular, but she actually gave the room to Wei, and said that there are only two rooms, I said that I can upgrade the room, but was rejected, the reason It should be that they find it troublesome to adjust the room, so they can only accept it. When I went to the room, the door card could not open the room. The old man waited at the door for more than 10 minutes, and finally said that the door lock was out of power, and the engineering depar**ent was required to repair it. In this case, the hotel’s solution is to let the old man continue to wait. No room change, no upgrade, almost an hour later, the door lock was not repaired before the room was changed. The matter that could have been solved at the beginning, but tossing the elderly for such a long time, this kind of service awareness is really speechless. In fact, many guests checked in after us, indicating that the room was available, but they didn’t give it to us. At that time, there was a manager-level lady at the front desk. Seeing us, she never came forward to help solve the problem, and even avoided walking away. Looking around, you can't expect anything from such a service.
        The next day I booked a private room on the third floor for lunch. The reservation information was that food and refreshments could be ordered in the room before 14:00. When the family ordered food at 12:30, the waiter said that they could only order food instead of refreshments. When I arrived, I said that you can order refreshments according to the message sent by your manager. In fact, we just want to eat the white swan sachima. The waiter said that we can’t order it. You have to go to the manager yourself to order it. Then he came back after a while Said it was ready. Under all kinds of divine operations, we were all calm and did not lose our temper, but every waiter in the hotel was so aggressive, which is really not flattering.
        I don’t want to write too much, I’m not a low-level Ctrip, and I have stayed in many top hotels in China. Caiyi is the first one that can ignore the requirements and evaluations of guests. In short, I definitely don’t recommend it. It’s just this time, and I will never stay. It can be said to be the failure of the White Swan brand.
I would like to add that the location of this hotel is too far away, there is nothing but the river view.

The equipment in the room is very new and good, it is a new hotel after all. The TV is from Sony, and it can cast the screen, but the name of the TV is not clearly distinguished in the room, so it is a bit difficult to find it.

The welcome fruits are two apples and two bananas, but you need to tell the front desk specifically that we have this order, and then they will be delivered slowly. The fruits will not be delivered until 11 o'clock in the evening.
The waiting time for check-in was long, and the service quality of the staff was average, and they could not solve the guests' needs or questions well. For example, when he called me at night, I said I was drying my hair and asked him to give a brief conclusion. In the end, he didn't think of what to say and had no conclusion...
I took the children to the area on the first floor to play with blocks, but the aunt yelled that we couldn't get out without the card, and she wanted to close the door (she thought we were not residents). We are good residents, but the experience is not very good.

Buffet: The buffet in the evening has few varieties. When I went to eat at 7:30, I saw that the dishes were all gone, and the hotel would not add more. For example, all the beef in the cauliflower beef is gone; all the vegetables in the salted vegetables are gone... There are no special dishes, at least you give enough.

msg:入住前台給升級了江景房，酒店新開的，硬件上沒的説。因為朋友在這邊宴請，晚餐和早茶都是在酒店用的。客房服務人員這邊能看的出來，相應培訓肯定平常沒少扣細節。酒店安全管理也過關，電梯分單雙樓層，朋友想上來坐坐，酒店人員都不給隨便刷卡。3樓包房餐廳略死板，一個裝飾的小紙傘因為孩子多，想跟廚房要一個都不能滿足，付費也不行。早茶也不錯，總體很值得推薦。

msg:我訂的是以下套餐:
2大1小自助晚餐: 衹能説一般般
早餐:跟自助晚餐相對比，挺豐盛的。

新開的酒店，設施齊設備比較新，房間相對比較小，但也夠用。江景景觀不錯，如果窗户換成全幅落地玻璃景觀更美。


衞生：床單上有肉眼可見的明顯小污漬2處，這還不是我特意去查看的。

環境：挺好的


服務：整體服務是不錯的。但是，這裏要特別吐槽一下。因為個人有早起運動的習慣，晚飯回房間後特意致電前台詢問一樓的健身房能否早點開門（門上掛牌時間7:00-22:00），因客房在5樓以上，在1樓運動也不會影響樓下住客休息。
我前後致電3次，並且前台電話很不容易才打進去。第一次致電是一位女士接的電話，説要問客房管理部門，稍後給我回電答覆，等了半小時沒回電，我第二次致電前台，這次是一位男士接的電話，他説幫我催一下，掛電話後這次等了二十來分鐘依舊是沒有接到回覆。我有點上火了😡春節期間比較繁忙我可以理解，但作為五星級酒店，服務質量肯定是擺在第一位的，我衹不過是需要一個明確的答覆，行或者不行，最多幾分鐘就可以落實的事情，為什麼要推來推去？為什麼會讓我等待這麼長時間？我夫人幫我第三次致電前台，問健身房6點能否開門，這次可能是一位當班領導接的電話，很明確給了可以的答覆，並且小孩因為想吃水果也幫忙及時安排送了蘋果和橘子上來，這才是我希望看到的作為一家五星級酒店應有的擔當和服務效率！

從飲食來講，種類其實不算很豐富，但好在會一直添，一直換，建議那個酸甜豬頸肉可以加量，味道非常不錯。但是餐廳空調太冷了，可能是坐在風口的位置下（其實也可以不把我們安排在風口底下，可以改進）。
