If there was any problem, he would contact us and reply to the message in time. He helped us solve it immediately, which made people feel warm. From the room to the facilities, from the service to the transportation, I was very satisfied. The room was very spacious and bright, the scenery was very beautiful, and the bedding was comfortable, which gave me a good rest. The hotel facilities were also very complete, including restaurants, swimming pools, etc., which allowed me to fully relax in my spare time.

In addition, the location here is also very good, right in the center of the ancient town, and the transportation to the Sun Palace or Yuji Island is very convenient.

Xiao Du’s housekeeper service is first-class. From the restaurant to the bar, from the public area to the room, it makes people feel warm everywhere. I especially thank the housekeeper Xiao Du for his professional, thoughtful and enthusiastic service, and for taking care of him throughout the whole process. Thank you very much! In addition, the guest room sister who cleans the room specially prepared some more mineral water, which is very considerate! I think, don’t read too many people’s complaints, the facts are the most important, and the facts must be experienced by yourself. If you don’t believe it, try another one? When I returned to the room at night, I suddenly found milk sago and cake on the table. It was cozy! I will definitely come to check in next time!

msg:Some people say that "star hotels are 'wine', resort hotels are 'coffee', and homestays are 'tea'." Tea is not distinguished by appearance. Good tea is suitable for the taste, soothing the mood, and good for health. Good coffee needs to be blended slowly and tasted carefully to know the balance of sour, sweet, and bitter, and the appropriate smoothness and thickness. It seems to be a secret hidden in the mountains, quiet and profound. Every drop of good wine comes from the encounter between grains and yeast, which is not ostentatious but powerful. To put it in human words, Li's Courtyard has the turndown service and hygiene standards of star hotels, the comfortable relaxation brought by the architectural aesthetics of resort hotels, and the warm service and localized experience of high-end homestays. The time of this trip was limited, and I was unable to experience the tie-dye and armor horse activities recommended by the housekeeper. I will definitely come again next time!

msg:The overall check-in experience is very good, with obvious advantages and disadvantages. Before check-in, the hotel staff communicated in advance more than once to understand the guests' check-in requirements, which should have been a plus, but there were communication problems between the staff, and the men and women were mistaken, which was a bit ridiculous; after check-in, it was good overall, worth recommending or choosing again. I deducted points for the environment because there was still construction in the hotel yard, and the insufficient trea**ent of the construction would reduce the guests' check-in experience. The construction area should be effectively shielded, and the noise was also affected. The deduction for facilities is that there are a lot of things in the room, and there is a suspicion of stacking, such as the floor lamp on the balcony door, which is useless; the balcony door leaks air with a very obvious whistling sound, and the button at the head of the bed is installed upside down. As a senior hotel guest, I will comment on these truthfully, and it is generally OK. The afternoon tea provided by the hotel is good, the room butler is very good, and the smile of the service staff makes me think that the hotel is worth recommending.

The hotel room supplies are of high quality, including Kohler sanitary ware, Dyson hair dryer, Diptyque toiletries, Marshall stereo, and Doterra essential oil fragrance. Facial towels are also prepared! Bath towels and bedding are very useful.
In addition, the hotel prepares sumptuous afternoon tea and good night desserts every day. Eat and eat every day🤣
Another highlight of Li's Courtyard that has to be mentioned is the service. In addition to the pre-departure inquiries mentioned above, the room service and butler service after check-in are very considerate. Butler Xiao Zhang takes the initiative to ask about car, photography, and activity needs, and provides services every day. They will ask for information about the needs of the day and are very detailed.
From the store manager to housekeeper Xiao Zhang, to every staff member in the hotel, they all enthusiastically and carefully provide warm services to the guests. The hotel a**osphere is very friendly and it is a warm hotel!
Highly recommended! I will definitely choose Li's Courtyard next time I come back!

msg:The hotel is in a great location with a large courtyard. The hotel staff contacted us immediately after placing the order. Due to the off-season, we were given a free room upgrade upon arrival. There are breakfast, afternoon tea, and goodnight desserts every day. You can stay in the hotel all day without going out and eat as much as you want! The service is also first-class. I will choose it again when I come to Shuanglang!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. If you drive by yourself, it is also very close to the parking lot. There are many room types, including an infinity pool and a sea-view family room. It is very beautiful. The service is one-on-one butler-style and considerate, and the room facilities are all smart. There are different afternoon teas and evening desserts every day. There is a small refrigerator in the room with a variety of drinks for you to drink. We left the hotel early and the butler specially provided a loving breakfast. I will definitely bring it next time I have the opportunity. Staying with family 😄

The children spent a day playing in the water and were very happy. The specialty restaurants in the courtyard are also good. The ancient town is like a night market snack street, very rich. The hotel has a warm and thoughtful one-on-one service from the butler Xiaolong, who can solve all problems during the stay and also delivers fruits during the stay.

環境：新酒店，剛好淡季，客人不多，公共區域很大，設計很到位。房間比較舒適，但有一點就是浴缸放在陽台上，衹能穿上泳衣去泡才行，真正想放鬆泡泡浴，私隱性有點欠缺，但這樣的設計佈局美觀度提高很多。另外，水蚊子的問題確實需要解決一下，不然看起來有點……
服務：管家，前台和服務生都很熱情，很有禮貌，提出的需要都能及時迴應和解決

環境很好就在洱海邊上，時時刻刻都可以享受到最清新的海風，聽到浪花的聲音。
客棧的服務也是非常的周到，尤其是我們的管家小彬，幫忙拿行李，安排行程，而且小彬很熱情，像家人一樣提醒氣候變化出門的保暖這些，很有温度的酒店，早餐也非常的豐盛，，完全符合我對早餐的所有期待!
下午茶也是非常的精品，自己製作的小蛋糕，精心切的水果很美味，還有咖啡和果汁氣泡作為飲料，下午的時候曬着太陽，坐在公區，公區面積超大臨着洱海，吹吹海風，吃下午茶可太安逸了床品很舒服和家裡睡的一樣!真的愛了，對我們這種喜歡拍照打卡的人來説，這真的太安逸了吧!
不説了，下次來還要住這家!強烈推薦
