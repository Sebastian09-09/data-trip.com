msg:I had a great time at this hotel. It is a beautiful and cozy hotel with a pleasant staff. The food was okay, the usual breakfast items. The location was not very convenient as we had to constantly take cabs to travel far distances to get to our destinations. It was rather affordable and easy to find.

msg:When making your booking here, just stick to the standard rooms, the more premium selections don’t bring a whole lot new to the table.  
The rooms are very modern with all the essential charging ports conveniently located.  The bathroom is huge and tub is deep; they could include bath salts in the executive room. 
Avoid making the booking with the “afternoon tea set” selection was very limited to the point that nobody went. I would rather have a fruit platter sent to my room. 
The location itself is close to Nanshan station, where the area is more residential than commercial. However taking 1-2 stations along lines 11 or 12 should solve your problems.

We booked a non-smoking room and quickly under 5 minutes the issue was solved . A welcome fruit plate at the sofa area and free coffee at the cafe in the lobby area from 3pm . We did our wedding ceremony via zoom there and house keeper brought us glasses for a champagne bottle we had . 
I would highly recommend and come back to stay here again !

The breakfast is below Mercure average, not enough selections and the staff stops refilling the trays half an hour before breakfast ends. Most importantly, the hotel staff is dishonest. At check-in, the staffer said he gave me an upgrade to executive room and hope I have a good experience. I found out soon enough that he gave me exactly what I booked--a luxury queen room. There was no upgrade. I find that utterly repulsive.

The other annoying aspect is the cleaners are knocking at your door very early to clean, so if you had a late night, they will wake you up, which was very disturbing.

There are four drinks in the refrigerator, such as Coke and Sprite. Since no one told me, I don't know whether it is drinkable or paid.
There were 6 of us who stayed for two days. On the first day, there were two capsule coffees. I drank one. When I came back the next day, the room was cleaned, but there was only one capsule left yesterday. No more capsules were added.
In a word, the hardware is perfect, but the software needs to be improved!

msg:Everything is okay, but there is indeed a lot of room for improvement. Every waiter feels cold compared to others. Will the guests have a sense of belonging and come back again? The answer is no, because there are so many hotels and so many choices. Even though we clearly agreed to check out at 2 pm, we booked a room around 13:20 and asked in a very polite manner: "Do you want to check out today?" I also ordered takeout, but after waiting for more than ten minutes, it was not delivered to my room. I called the front desk to inquire and found out that they had not put it into the "meal delivery robot" to deliver it to my room. If you can't live in it, think about it yourself. Looking forward to improvements in hotel service!

In addition, the hotel has no special facilities and no view. It is opposite a building, so the curtains must be closed all the time.

He even upgraded our room, which was so touching🥲 The environment and location were very good. The drinks provided were very diverse, including mineral water, Coke and Sprite. While we were waiting for drinks, the hotel even had a coffee machine. There was actually a piece of fruit in the room, but we had a robot bring us an extra piece (we couldn’t eat it).
  There should be scale on the overhead shower head in the shower room. The water spray is a little skewed and the water spray is not very concentrated. It needs to be cleaned. I wrote it on the hotel comment card. I don’t know if you saw it.

The bathroom makeup mirror has an inner light, and is equipped with a smart toilet and a capsule coffee machine (I don’t drink coffee ~ I don’t know about capsule coffee) Whether there is a fee). The lighting in the room is very bright, and I always think the spotlights are too dazzling, but theirs is nice, not dazzling, and bright enough. The whole room feels like it was carefully decorated and done with care. The only bad thing is that the carpet is not spread all the way. The sound insulation is not very good, but it does not affect the rest.
	
🗺️The hotel is a 10-minute walk from the subway, and there are many places to eat around. The location is very good. It's not far from the airport, about 35 minutes' drive.
🙋The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic, upgraded to an executive room for free, and said she could provide bath salts~
🍳Breakfast💰106, the breakfast coupon given by Ctrip as a diamond member, the food is good, the variety is quite satisfactory, but the ingredients are good and can be eaten ~ the sausage is made of meat, not starch, fried chicken nuggets It's also fresh, the stir-fried dishes taste good, the freshly cooked noodles and noodles are delicious, and the dishes are very fresh.

First of all, I would like to thank Jenny, the front desk staff, for upgrading both of our rooms and giving us an extra breakfast (we originally had one breakfast per room and a king-size bed room without a bathtub);
Secondly, I think the overall staff is very friendly and will proactively provide a welcome drink when checking in;
Third, this is amazing. The room is very clean and tidy. It is the kind of clean that you will feel very comfortable as soon as you open the door. There is no drainage smell and the toilet smell is better than some big five-star brands.

Fourth, after checking in, every room was given free fruit and a free minibar. It was really a surprise.

I don't know the quality of the breakfast, but it would be nice if the breakfast time could be extended to 11 o'clock. Since the view outside the room is very close to the house opposite, the curtains were closed throughout. Also, the room I stayed in has a bathtub. I hope that some bath salts can be placed next time to facilitate the guests to take a bath.

The ceiling in the same price range! I personally think it’s not inferior to a hotel room worth thousands of dollars!
The room was very clean and smart, and the takeaway you ordered in the middle of the night was delivered by a robot!
The attitude of the waiters is also very good! Overall very satisfied!
Finally, downstairs is the internet celebrity restaurant Xiao Nan Ji, highly recommended! It’s so delicious!

This time I will still choose a hotel under the Huazhu Club. The service is still attentive, with fruit plates, afternoon tea, and robots delivering meals. The whole place is clean and hygienic. The buffet breakfast is quite rich, and children's portions are also included. The bathroom also has a bathtub and a fully automatic toilet, which children especially like haha. All the staff are very welcoming and ask me if I have enough drinking water every time. I feel at home😊
Ps: I also tried the late night snack stall in front of the door, which was also very good. There is another tea restaurant not far away, very nice, haha

Room light control and curtain control are all fully automatic, and the experience is good. It's just that the toilet's ventilation is just so-so, and the ventilation is not strong enough. Secondly, there is only a trash can in the bathroom between the toilet and toilet, which is inconvenient (to throw out trash). After washing, you have to open the toilet door to throw out trash.
Secondly, breakfast is really a failing area of ​​the hotel. There are very few meals and the presentation is mediocre.

msg:I traveled on November 1 and stayed at this hotel. Let me talk about my personal experience. I have stayed in many first-tier hotels such as Hilton, Shangri-La, and InterContinental before, so I believe I still have a say.

1. The front desk of the hotel feels very welcoming when you need to find them, no matter morning or evening, and they are not listless just because it is night. This gives a good first impression.

2. There is a coffee bar in the hotel lobby, and there is a man at the bar who is very discerning. As soon as I sat down on the sofa, tea was brought to me, even though I was only sitting for a short while to wait for the bus. But in terms of service capabilities, all previous first-tier hotels were not up to standard.

3. The aunt in charge of cleaning on the 9th floor is patient and meticulous in her service. She will deliver the supplies needed in the room in a timely manner. They also read room messages and handle requests as needed, which is great.

4. The hotel has a good food delivery robot. You no longer have to worry about being hungry late at night and ordering takeout but it is inconvenient to pick it up. It can be delivered directly to the door of the room by robot.

5. Although the hotel's breakfast is not as rich as the first-tier hotels mentioned earlier, according to my observation, if a certain item is missing, the restaurant staff will deal with it immediately and replenish it. In contrast, some first-tier hotels that I have stayed at cannot meet this standard when there are many people.

6. Finally, let me talk about the room. My pictures were all taken when I checked in. The facilities are quite satisfactory, but the key is intelligence. Curtains, lights, etc. can be operated by touch. The bathroom toilet is also automatic. Also, let me talk about this pillow. It is the most comfortable pillow among all the hotels I have stayed in. Note that it is the most comfortable pillow among all the hotels. The memory pillow is really good. Although I don’t know the brand, it deserves praise.

To sum up, the service attitude of this hotel is very good, no matter the position, it is very good. The facilities are complete and the rooms are good. It deserves full marks from me.

There is no disposable bath bag. I gave it to you when I asked for it, and also gave me bath salts. Good reviews. It’s a good hotel. The bed is relatively soft, and the TV can only watch various channels without selecting programs. The capsule coffee machine has good reviews, but it is too bitter. There is no sugar and no cream balls. Even after putting two packs of Nestlé Mate, it is still bitter. The costa is not delicious either.

Buffet afternoon tea set: Really disappointed, just a few pieces 🍉, several kinds of bread snacks, the bread is hard, the floss and scallops are not delicious

The breakfast is rich, with hot stir-fried vegetables and toast.

The robot is cute but the welcome fruit is average

I forgot to take a picture. There is a casserole porridge nearby that tastes good. I had a late night snack.

Location: It is acceptable. If you call a car, the driver can save the need to find the location of the destination, because it is very easy to find; if you take the subway, it is not too far from the hotel, and the environmental sanitation and security are not bad.

Restaurant: The hotel has a wide variety of breakfast options, but it seems to be too early to end at 10 o'clock, so after 9:15, there will be many people like a street market. Staff service is very fast and professional.


Fitness facilities: The space is small, the facilities are insufficient, and the sanitation environment is good, but the air-conditioning is seriously insufficient, even 25 degrees. This temperature can be used in sports places. I believe the hotel can make improvements immediately, please pay attention.

Room: The bed type is a bit hard (I don't like it very much), but some people like it, so there should be no problem. There is no refill for the ballpoint pen in the room. I told the waitress and she gave me a new one immediately, which is worthy of praise. The air-conditioning in the hotel room is not enough, and I can't sleep if it gets hotter. Although the hotel had a special person come to follow up immediately, but the air conditioner could not be turned down, but his attitude was still very professional and polite. The hotel's bathtub is large and comfortable, but it is not balanced. Please ask the hotel to find workers to make repairs. Smart toilet is my first choice, which is my main reason to choose this hotel. (Because I travel and do business, and I also use smart toilets at home, so I can’t leave it [naughty])

Check-in: The staff is fairly professional, but it would be better if they can take the initiative and smile. Feels like a 4 star hotel quality. However, the decoration and style of the hotel lobby is not bad. In addition, we found that someone was secretly smoking in the corridor, and hoped to do a good job of checking it early (personal reason: because once I smell the smell of smoke, I will feel uncomfortable for the next one to two hours); the smell of the hotel corridor is fresh, tidy.

Conclusion: Generally speaking, this hotel is also at a five-star level. If the above things can be improved, it will definitely be more popular. I am also interested in trying to stay again in the future.

High-quality staff: FO Chaya (after making coffee for us, asked us about our living experience intimately, which is worthy of praise), Auntie Procter & Gamble on the 8th floor (when we have extra needs, her service is very good, she is also very polite and sincere smile)

Staff that could be improved: FO LAYLA (the service is very fast, but it would be perfect with more smiles)

When I go to pick up the clothes the next morning, they not only help dry them, but also help them. Fold it in the laundry basket!
The hotel is very close to Happy Coast and Happy Harbor. It is recommended that Happy Harbor is more suitable for bringing children to play. Playing video games in Happy Harbor StarCraft is not only very cost-effective, but also can be exchanged for many prizes. There are a lot of food and drinks nearby, and the price is very reasonable.

After staying for four nights, I could vividly remember the conversation of the two men and women upstairs talking about bathing and other activities. I was speechless. It was two o'clock in the morning every day and there was still a lot of movement. I called the front desk and hoped to communicate with the guests staying upstairs, but they only agreed verbally and did nothing. I had to make a live call at one o'clock in the morning to "remind you to turn down the volume" upstairs... I couldn't fall asleep every day, so I had to turn on the TV very loudly! I won’t stay here again, so be careful especially when traveling in the morning.

msg:I am actually very satisfied with the room rate including two breakfasts. After all, breakfast at your own expense costs more than 100 yuan. The room is very large, the toilet is a smart toilet, and a robot will deliver food to the door when ordering food, and the phone will notify you to pick up the food. The lady who serves the floor has a good attitude. I live on the 5th floor, which is not a high floor. Disposable toiletries, shampoo and bath products are a bit average, but the toothbrushes are experienced and made of environmentally friendly materials. Overall, the room is very satisfactory. There are free drinks in the mini bar. The most surprising thing is the breakfast. I don’t have any expectations because I do hotel catering, but the breakfast buffet is small and well-equipped, which is interesting! Next time if the price is similar, I will still choose this Grand Mercure. It is quite convenient and there are many parking places, but it takes seven or eight minutes to walk from the subway station. It is not very friendly in hot weather, but non-local cars are prohibited⛔️ Still There is a trade-off, the price of a hotel with convenient transportation will not be low! No matter personal travel or business trip, it is recommended!

I just don’t know how this executive room has been upgraded compared to the room I booked 😂 The drinks in the small refrigerator are all free. I don’t know if it counts as one of the benefits.
Facilities: Since it is a hotel renovated in recent years, the facilities are very new. The curtains are all electric, and the bedside tables on both sides can control the lights of the whole house, which is very good. In many hotels I have stayed in before, some lights can only be switched on and off by the bedside table on one side, which is not so convenient in comparison. The TV is relatively large, but it is not appropriate to directly cast the screen from the mobile phone. The bathroom is actually equipped with a smart toilet, which is quite surprising for a hotel at this price in China. That is, the toilet lid cannot be opened by induction or by remote control, which is a little insufficient. The bathtub has a good shape. After taking a bath, it is very comfortable to lean on. The hotel also provides a disposable bathtub cover. Like it! The water spray from the big top of the shower is not very good, much worse than the Kohler at home. The toothpaste that comes with it is quite special, not the kind of small ones, but the packaging like KFC ketchup. The pillows are also good and comfortable. They don't provide two high and low down pillows like most hotels. The pillows provided seem to be memory foam pillows, which are more suitable for me. There are enough outlets in the room, so I’m not afraid that I won’t be able to find a place to charge it😄Finally, the air conditioner is not very powerful. I have already turned it on to 23 or 24 degrees and it doesn’t feel very cool. Obviously, the air conditioners in the corridors and lobby are very cool.

Service: Very good, except that my ID card was not swiped out at the beginning of check-in, which was a bit slow, but other efficiency is very high. Ask the hotel in the room for water and other things, and someone will deliver it quickly. There are robots in the hotel. At first I thought it would be delivered by a robot, but I didn’t expect it to be delivered directly by the staff.

Breakfast: There are quite a lot of varieties, there are freshly squeezed juices, and the watermelon is also very fresh. There is also beef brisket at the noodle stall, which tastes good too. It's just that the food is not replenished in a timely manner, and several things are empty. And my wife said that the coffee is more difficult to drink.

msg:I booked a deluxe executive double room this time. This hotel has several advantages and disadvantages that can be used as a reference for other booking friends.
advantage:
- The lobby and rooms look decent and stylish, and feel comfortable.
- The room has a lot of space and the lighting can be adjusted very brightly, which I like very much.
- The quality of service is good. I have ordered takeout several times and it was delivered quickly.
shortcoming:
- The facilities are relatively old, such as:
1) The shower curtain that separates the bathroom from the room is broken and cannot be used.
2) The bathtub kept shaking while soaking in the bath. I don't know if it is a problem with the floor or the bathtub.
3) The sofa in the room is stained.
- The brand of TV used is very high-end, but it cannot cast the screen, and sometimes the Internet will be disconnected when watching digital TV, which deducts a lot of points.
- The wifi is weak, super slow, I ended up using my own network directly.
- Air conditioner is not cold enough.

msg:The surprise hotel for the May 1 trip to Shenzhen, first of all, it is located near the Nanshan subway station, about ten minutes' walk, which is convenient and not noisy. It is very close to the Internet celebrity old hot pot and Chaoshan cuisine restaurant, and it takes about ten minutes to walk. If you want to eat at these two restaurants, go there. We booked a twin room with a 1.2 single bed. It is no problem to sleep two skinny people. The room has a small sofa, a small writing desk, a large bathroom, a separate toilet and shower, and smart toilet electric curtains, which is very convenient. The room provides free mini bar drinks every day, including Coke Sprite and two bottles of boutique water, and welcome fruit on the first day of check-in. When we checked in, a male service staff in the lobby gave us three extra servings of fruit, so we had a lot of fruit every day, and the bananas and apples inside were delicious. For this location, this service, the price of the hotel is simply too friendly during the skyrocketing May Day. In short, the praise is highly praised, and I will stay at Grand Mercure Nanshan next time I come to Shenzhen.

I am still satisfied, but I am still dissatisfied: before checking in, they will call you to ask you what time you are arriving, and then tell you that they will reserve a room for you. I have already made a reservation and guaranteed it. Do I need to make this call before saying that I will reserve the room for you? Isn’t it appropriate to leave it alone? Secondly, in the same way, they will visit you after checking out and ask you to give them five stars. In this busy world, there are not many hotels like this, and it seems to be an intrusion.

The facilities are in perfect condition, the toilet flushes automatically, the shower is very large and the shower is very comfortable, it is worth coming again. The breakfast is okay, the hotel at this price is not bad, there are freshly cooked soup noodles and noodles. In addition, the hotel downstairs is next to a seafood food stall "Xiao Nan Ji", which is worth recommending. It tastes good, and there are still people waiting in line at 10 o'clock in the evening.

The first room I was assigned was very nice, large, new, and clean, but a neighbor down the hall kept smoking and the door was left open. The smell is unbearable. I told the front desk and they came and asked me to choose a new room. I think their customer service is exactly that. They were always helpful and never made me feel like a burden. The facilities are very new and modern. The decor of the room was beautiful, fresh and clean. The aunties who clean are very friendly and do a thorough job. Every member of staff at the hotel is very welcoming. The best part of this hotel is the breakfast. While it might look like the typical food you see in other hotel breakfasts, the quality and taste is very high. The fruit is fresh and sweet. All dishes are fresh and taste good. The servers are very attentive and make sure everything is in order. I will return here without a doubt. Great value for money. Excellent service, rooms, facilities and breakfast. Recommended booking

I don't like this kind of thing very much, but you can't see it in the room type photos. The front desk receptionist The man was just polite and showed no enthusiasm. Perhaps the online reviews were too good and the business was too busy. The breakfast was very average and the room was not as big as indicated. It only had smart curtains and switches as mentioned in the reviews. What about the toiletries in the bathroom? It is an environmentally friendly product, but the wooden comb actually broke after use. There is only a trash can between the toilet and the toilet, and there is no toilet next to the bathtub. It is very inconvenient, so I feel that the price and experience do not match it. It is very average anyway.

Lying on my side against the pillow, I can hear some electric sounds, which is also strange. . In addition, as long as the door next door is closed tightly, the room will shake. At 8 o'clock in the morning, the waiter is already outside with a vacuum cleaner to vacuum the floor. . In short, this sound insulation affects sleep very much. . In addition, this is probably not a non-smoking room. There will be a smell of smoke after turning off the air conditioner for a while, so it must be turned on to stop it. .

However, there is still a gap in the details of sanitation and cleaning, which is mainly reflected in some dead corners in the bathroom, and needs to be strengthened in terms of professionalism. Generally speaking, it is good. I will choose it next time when I come to Shenzhen for business trip. I hope the hotel will get better and better.

Check in The lady at the front desk was very friendly. When I entered the room, there was a smell of cigarettes. I went back to the front desk to change the room. The lady immediately changed the room for us. This is a good point. The room is big enough. There is a small sofa and a small dining table by the window. Soon after entering the room, a small robot brings welcome fruit. The hygiene is ok, the bedding is ok, and the breakfast is ok. Only when you sleep at night, the fresh air system, every once in a while A lot of points were deducted for the time running, it was very loud, and I couldn't sleep well all night. When checking out, the lady at the front desk asked about our check-in experience and explained everything. I hope that the country will legislate and punish smoking in non-smoking rooms. This is common in mainland hotels now, and the quality of the people needs to be improved. If the hotel improves which fresh air system has no noise, Grand Mercure Hotel is definitely the first choice, with high cost performance.

Contact The main station, the main station sent it to the room immediately. The most speechless thing is that I found a 1cm-sized cockroach in the hotel room for the first time.

Go to the front desk in the lobby to check the renewal order with the staff at 9 o'clock in the morning
At that time, a female employee said that there was no problem after receiving the order from Ctrip. She continued to live normally.

Then I called again at two o'clock in the afternoon and said that I didn’t find the order.
Described the problem and situation to the male employee, the employee said that he found it

At 11:40 in the middle of the night, I called a friend
Said we have placed fewer orders.
I immediately communicated with the front desk, and as soon as the front desk found the name of the people who checked in, the phone number was resolved in less than 2 minutes, saying that there was no missing order.

I am really curious to have this leisure time to harass the guests in the middle of the night and don't have time to check the order by myself?
Ctrip's customer service is a hundred times more active and serious in handling problems than the hotel front desk
The hotel facilities are good, but the front desk service of garbage needs to be improved!!

設施和空間遠超南山附近住過的同等級酒店，前台和保潔的服務也都很nice，地理位置也相當不錯，周邊很多宵夜選擇。另外每日mini吧暢飲對於碳酸愛好者們來説應該也會是一大加分。
個人覺得唯一差一點的就是早餐，品類和水準都還有蠻多改進的空間，anyway還是強烈推薦。

唯有少少問題就係浴室花灑一般，地下有少少污漬

房間衞生還不錯。隔音太差了，半夜隔壁房間電視聲音，聽的一清二楚。甚至有一個人打噴嚏我都聽到了。

後面兩天因為工作就沒有繼續住了，換了希爾頓花園酒店，房間小到沒有地方放行李箱，什麼智能設施都沒有，連我老公這種什麼也不關心的，啥都能將就的人都説還是美爵酒店好
