msg:My first impression of Shangri La Guilin is that many staff speak English proficiently or at least the basics that are required for their job. I arrived an hour and a half before the check in time but they promptly checked me into my room without any long wait. My luggage was taken to my room by a bell boy whose English was even better than the front of the house. My initial thoughts of the room was that it was quite old fashioned and the interior design & amenities were dated in comparison to most 5 star hotels. The view however was exceptional. I could clearly see the garden, river and mountains. After my first night I was woken by some loud music. Though the staff tried to tell the dancers that playing the music was disruptive to their guests, they continued to play it which further frustrated me. I informed the guest manager Edward who was very helpful in rectifying this. He upgraded me into a much nicer room that he ensured me should be quieter. They also gave me complimentary fruits in the room which added to the nice gesture. This is exactly the kind of quality of service that earns them a 5 star rating. Carl at the front desk was also very competent and was very helpful when I had to pay for something through wechat. 
The room I came with was a package deal that included breakfast, spa voucher, photoshoot and club privileges. It was worth the extra cost as the all inclusive club buffet during happy hour was filling and tasty (photo attached).
Breakfast was a Chinese buffet with a fusion of western basics such as cereal, toast and bakery items.

If you have the time, I would highly recommend seeing Kelly (English name) for a "signature Asian" massage at the spa. She applied the perfect pressure for me and was very kind. 

The photoshoot was organised through wechat and included 6 photos. The photographer was lovely and the final photos made special memories of my time in China.

Suggestions for improvement: several items in the room are in need of repair or replacement eg. old hair dryer that lightly blows air (useless), flickering lights when you turn it on and the phones. I also think if they were to refurbish the pools outside then the place would appear less worn down.

Overall, the service and reputation is what made this stay worth it. I look forward to staying at Shangri La again

msg:It was great time to stay at Shangrila in Guilin.  All workers are very nice and kind. One of the worker even helped my son blow his nose!  The hotel is just beside the river so it‚Äôs nice to take a walk.  By using share bike, it takes 15 min to get the city side.  I think it‚Äôs convenient enough and ridding share bike during trip is also good experience.  Our highlight is the last night with Peach & Aries at the bar in Shangrila.  Their music was awesome and they also let my wife sing with them.  Playing some Japanese songs means a lot to me.

"I highly recommend the Shangri La hotel Guilin in terms of service, cleanliness, and facilities. We had a wonderful experience during our 9-day stay in December which included being there for Christmas Day. The hotel had decorations up everywhere and the public areas played Christmas songs. As a Westerner who enjoys celebrating Christmas, this was wonderful and helped make the festive season feel more familiar.
The room was spacious and clean. The decor, simple but elegant. The bathroom had a bath and shower and was very clean. We were on the 7th floor facing the river.
December is not 'in season for hotels in China and some of the hotel facilities were closed especially during the weekdays e.g the kids club and game room. Even though this was the case, the hotel gladly opened the game room for our daughter each day so that she could enjoy the many gaming consoles and other fun activities they have in this area. As the hotel was not full and there were fewer guests, the breakfast buffet had fewer options than it would normally have during a busier season. This, however, was not a problem, as the staff and kitchen were incredibly accommodating towards us, especially as Westerners. Whatever we wanted to eat that was not available in the buffet was provided for us. The kitchen cooked up pancakes & waffles for our daughter each day and made omelettes and special fried rice dishes for my husband and me. No request was too much effort. We were thoroughly spoilt. In particular, I would like to thank Athena Liu, Food and Beverage Director, and her marvelous team for the exceptional service we received in the restaurants. Their welcoming manner, warm smiles, and efforts to make us feel comfortable were greatly appreciated. We would also like to thank Sophia Lang, duty manager, who also went out of her way to assist us and make sure our every need was met during our stay. " If we find ourselves in Guilin again, we will not hesitate to book in at the Shangri La again.

It‚Äôs important to explain to staff that recommendations are given by visitors upon their well and once they have time / leave .. otherwise it feels like they do the help in return.

msg:I traveled with my parents and my son to Guilin and this is our first time to be here, so I booked Shangri-La Guilin since we quite often stay with Shangri-La when traveling. The overall experience with Shangri-La Guilin was very good and the staff are very polite and nice. I booked two executive rooms and the staff from the executive lounge provided us very good service, especially Amanda and Wenjing Han. They helped us to quickly check in and carried the luggage to our rooms. Upon my request in advance via phone, the linked rooms were arranged for us and two tents were already set in the room, my son loved them so much. The hotel also organized many interesting activities for kids but unfortunately we were unable to participate due to our full visiting schedule. The riverside rooms provide brilliant view of green mountains and river. The hotel itself is also very beautiful with a lot of plants, little animals, and very nice swimming pools both indoor and outdoor. The breakfast is very attracted with quite a lot choices, including local special dishes such as Guilin rice noodle and You Cha (tea). My parents are very satisfied with the hotel and its relevant services, too. If we go back to Guilin in the future, Shangri-La Guilin is definitely our choice of stay.

I received a call from Guixiang Guest Relations Xiao Wu one day in advance. His voice was gentle and considerate. He confirmed my check-in time and arranged the room in advance, and also upgraded it for free. On the day of check-in, I met Xiao Wu at the front desk who helped me with the formalities. It turned out to be a big beauty. She was warm and generous, attentive and considerate, and skilled in business. She told us the dining times of the hotel at different times, which was very considerate. The room was clean and hygienic, and the bedding was tidy. The cleaning aunt Deng Longjiao was very polite and sent red wine and fruit with a smile on her face. If you need anything, you can tell her at any time. The service is thoughtful. The breakfast variety is rich. I met the handsome Wang Peixian. After helping us arrange the dining location, he carefully and considerately sent coffee and milk. The service was in place. This stay experience is good, and I will come again next time.

The travel photographer who sent me was also very serious and helped my family to retouch the photos! When taking pictures, I met a cleaning lady in the garden. She was very enthusiastic. It was hot and she was afraid that we were thirsty, so she took the initiative to get us water and sprayed me with floral water! This aunt is excellent!

Whether it is Zhenzhen at the front desk, Xiao Wu, the butler at the back office, or Xiao Zhao at the room service, many of my requests can be completed according to my ideas, which is generally very satisfactory.

The room is very quiet, well-lit, and cleaned. The food in the VIP lounge and restaurant is also very good.
I give the hotel a full score here. Shangri-La will be my first choice for future travel and accommodation‚ù§

When I checked in, I felt that I was not satisfied with the view in the living room, so I communicated with the front desk. Manager Li of the hotel immediately arranged another room, thank you very much, so that my mother can enjoy the beautiful Guilin landscape in the room, which is very comfortable.

Next time I come back to Guilin, I will still choose Shangri-La Hotel!

Later, I discovered that the hotel actually had nostalgic game consoles from the 1990s to play, and there were over a hundred games! It's a pity that I didn't have enough time, so I only played two games, and some facilities were not used.

The staff at the dinner buffet are very diligent (most of the staff here are polite and smart, knowing the needs of the guests before they ask). It would be nice if the dinner buffet in the Western restaurant was more rich. I feel like there could be more styles.

The only drawback is that the scenery in the room is slightly different from the hotel introduction photos. Some rooms basically do not have a view of the Li River. You have to go to the Horizon Club to see it. The views and drinks in the Horizon Club are really good, and the service is also very attentive!

msg:I have stayed in five-star or luxury hotels of various brands at home and abroad. Guilin Shangri-La is the most cost-effective and value-for-money hotel I have stayed in in the past two years. I don‚Äôt have the habit of getting up early for breakfast, so I can‚Äôt comment on it without experiencing the breakfast. However, the hotel‚Äôs front desk and concierge services are very good. In addition, Guilin Shangri-La is positioned as a family hotel. There are many small animals in the hotel. I made an appoin**ent with one that comes with the reservation. For the travel photography project, photographer Xixi‚Äôs service was superb. It was much better than the travel photography service we cooperated with in the hotel in Sanya before. Because of the shooting service in the hotel, we got up early and met the breeder Wan Xiaofeng in the garden. She was very enthusiastic and friendly with us. We said hello, and my friend who likes small animals asked if he could feed the pigeons. He gave us feed to feed the pigeons on the grass, and gave us boiled eggs to feed the peacocks, but I was too timid to feed the peacocks to my friend. In short, the service staff and living experience of this hotel are excellent. I have recommended it to all my friends and relatives. I want to come back to Guilin again in the summer to visit the Guilin Shangri-La Hotel~ It is really a hotel that I would like to write a good review on my own. correct! ! ! The price of the minibar in the room is super cheap! ! Really worth it! We are staying as girlfriends, so it is better for families, children and couples to stay! ! !

The hotel is also equipped with a gym and a buffet restaurant with rich cuisine.

msg:The hotel is in a good location, among the mountains and rivers beside the Li River, and it seems not too far from the scenic spots in the city. For a three-day and two-night tour alone, I chose a river-view room with a wide view and fell asleep with the beautiful mountains and rivers. There are docile animals such as ostriches, peacocks, and rabbits in the back garden of the hotel. Sister Wan Xiaofeng in the animal area is very patient and will take the initiative to introduce the habits of ostriches and the origin of the little peacock. I must be the luckiest guest in the spring of 2024. I didn‚Äôt want to get up early and didn‚Äôt order breakfast on the first day.
I checked in for the Chun Kee Roast Goose morning tea, and the next day I had the afternoon tea buffet at the hotel restaurant Shang Palace. The one that suited my taste the most was a side dish of mixed eggplant, sweet and sour, fragrant and glutinous, and other dishes were incompetent.

The children loved the hotel's amusement facilities and small animals. They spent half a day playing in the hotel zoo, catching up with the peacocks in full bloom and feeding the pigeons. The hotel staff are all professional and friendly. We wanted to feed the pigeons with the biscuits we brought, but the hotel staff Wan Xiaofeng kindly reminded us not to feed the pigeons biscuits. She also gave us some pigeon feed to feed. Behind the hotel is the Li River, and the transportation is very convenient.

Holder of Hilton Gold Card and Ctrip Diamond Card. I have stayed in many Hilton and Marriott hotels all over the country. Guilin Shangri-La left a deep impression, which is better than similar hotels.
Location: Located on the Li River in downtown Guilin, with picturesque scenery outside the window.
Service: Benchmark service. Name and praise Wu Wenjing, the customer service supervisor, for understanding the needs in advance, making check-in arrangements in advance, and greetings for service at any time. . The concierges, waiters, and aunties in the hotel all nodded and said hello, and helped deliver the luggage.
Facilities: It has a private garden comparable to a resort hotel, and the facilities are well maintained. The parking space is large and parking is convenient. The swimming pool is perfect, with 5 lanes and 1.9 meters of water depth.
Breakfast: A full range of breakfast options are available during the Spring Festival when the room is full. Dishes are guaranteed to be produced. Bread, cold cuts, and coffee beans are all of high quality.
Next time I come to Guilin, I will choose Shangri-La.

msg:I booked a landscape view room and I really like the scenery outside the window. Nearby is the hotel's own garden, and in the distance are the characteristic mountains of Guilin. I feel that this landscape is the highlight of this hotel. I can stay by the window and stare at the scenery outside the window in a daze all afternoon. The buildings at the bottom of the mountain must not be built too high. There are two tall buildings on the right blocking the two mountains. I feel bad that the painting is affected by these two tall buildings. Fortunately, the effect on the far right is not big.
The hotel building is in Chinese style, and the room decoration is also antique. Prefer to have breakfast in the Horizon Club on the sixth floor, which is quieter. Eating breakfast on the first floor felt a bit noisy, like eating a meal from a tour group. Maybe it‚Äôs because there are so many people traveling in these two days. The room is clean and tidy, and the staff is friendly and responsible. When traveling to the hotel, it is very convenient to book a ride-hailing service online. Check out today and take the high-speed rail. There are two taxis parked in front of the hotel, so there is no need to worry about traffic problems. Yesterday morning we departed from the hotel and took a cruise to Yangshuo. We spent four hours on the cruise enjoying the essence of Guilin's landscape. In the afternoon we took a bus back to Guilin and did not choose to stay in Yangshuo. I think hotels in Guilin are more cost-effective. The shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion used in the hotel are all L'Occitane brands.

I originally chose between ciao and cinnamon, but considering the family and children, I chose cinnamon. First of all, the service is very good. Whether it is the housekeeper Wu Wenjing who contacted us in advance to arrange the room, check-in in the lobby was smooth, and we could check in at twelve o'clock. Guixiang's children's paradise has always been the reason why I choose Shangri-La every time. Anna quan of the park is also very considerate towards babies, making me feel safe to leave my children here. By the way, the fried dough sticks for breakfast are also delicious, freshly fried. In short, it is the right choice to choose cinnamon for your trip to Guilin.

msg:Shangri-La is the third hotel we stayed at during this New Year trip to Guangxi. I have to say that the classic big-name hotel chain does bring you all-round comfort!

Facilities: The classic red and gold-gilded classical Chinese style is really big and impressive enough in Guilin! Although it has a history of 13 years, the facilities with a bit of age cannot conceal its momentum because they are clean enough. The standard room is 42 square meters, and the bed is about 2 meters large. The room is spacious, with oversized floor-to-ceiling windows and a bright and clean bathroom sink. I have a place to dry my washed clothes. The air conditioning and ventilation system are really good, the quiet temperature is very suitable and the ventilation is fast. The only two shortcomings are that the lights in the room are gorgeous but too dim, and there are too many doors from the parking lot to the lobby, making it easy to get dizzy.
Hygiene: Very neat and clean.
Environment: The hotel garden should be thousands of square meters, the fruit trees, flowers and plants are beautifully repaired, the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are also very clean, there are paid go-karts and free indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds. You can directly see the Two Rivers and Four Lakes scenic area from the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room. You can watch the fireworks during the Chinese New Year. The hotel also has wonderful ethnic song and dance performances, which you can watch without leaving home. The visibility in the morning is very good, and you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful mountains and rivers, which is very pleasant!
Service: There is a welcome fruit plate, which is super large! The uncle who greeted us at the door and took the luggage was very warm and polite. He sent the luggage to the room and helped put it on the table. Thank you! Because the room was not cleaned until 17:00, the front desk extended check-out by 1 hour and kept apologizing, which was very considerate. Breakfast is also good. The local oil tea and rice noodles can be restored to 80%, which is goodüëç
Personally, I am very inclined to choose a five-star chain, because it is most likely to guarantee comprehensive hardware facilities, which will instantly improve the stay experience. We also respond quickly to feedback! Guilin Shangri-La did not disappoint me, I will still choose it next time I come to Guilin!

Thank you for your service during the Spring Festival

The breakfast is very rich. It is understandable that there are many people during the Spring Festival.
But the waiters will collect the plates in time and try their best to serve the guests.
The hotel has arranged a series of Spring Festival activities, which are very rich. Thank you very much.
Had dinner at the hotel and was very moved to see the restaurant manager busy serving guests and meals from breakfast to dinner. Thank you to every staff member during the holiday.

On the first day of the Spring Festival, there was a large lion dance at the door to pray for blessings. There was a Zhuang performance in the evening. It felt so worth it. Thank you Guilin Shangri-La. I wish you a prosperous business in 2024. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Guilin!

Wan Xiaofeng, the aunt in charge of feeding the small animals, is very nice and even teaches the children how to feed various small animals! We also gave away a cormorant toy unique to the hotel!

msg:The hotel facilities are average, but what makes it better is the enthusiastic service of the staff. From teachers Pato and Anna who are in charge of parent-child projects, to Wan Xiaofeng who is in charge of animal feeding, and Li Jinhua who is in charge of room service, everyone is patient and enthusiastic in providing entertainment services to the children. In two days, the child fulfilled her wish of feeding pigeons, taking a boat ride, and even took a cookie baking class. She had so much fun that she refused to leave. This trip deserves a super rating

msg:The hotel is a time-honored five-star hotel. The hotel is a garden-style hotel with an elegant environment, a large outdoor lawn, a miniature zoo, and a path leading to the shore of the Li River. You can stroll along the shore of the Li River and enjoy the scenery. The hotel room has the layout of an old five-star hotel, quite satisfactory and featureless, but still very comfortable, except for the old-fashioned hair dryer that can't leave the drawer. The customer service staff are all very polite, enthusiastic and considerate, especially Ding Wenhui, the lady who checked in at the counter. She was very careful and patient in explaining all kinds of things. She was very considerate and tried her best to meet our needs. She also told us that the hotel has a back door. I went to the restaurant I wanted to eat along the river without taking many detours and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. Thank you very much.

After contacting the hotel manager Wu Wenjing, the problem was solved immediately. In addition, the hotel's service is warm and provides a lot of help to tourists during their travels.
There are four seasons of osmanthus planted in the back garden of the hotel, and there is a strong fragrance of osmanthus even in winter. There is a mini zoo in the back garden of the hotel. Aunt Wan Xiaofeng from the zoo enthusiastically took us to experience feeding pigeons and told us a lot about the animals here.
The hotel's breakfast is rich and tastes good. You can eat Guilin's local specialties, Guilin rice noodles and oil tea, and the taste is no less than the restaurants we ate out during our trip to Guilin. The restaurant‚Äôs fried dough sticks are particularly amazing and highly recommended. There is still room for improvement in the western food depar**ent compared with hotels of the same quality in the eastern coastal areas. In addition, there are several kittens outside the restaurant, which are very cute.

The most important thing is that there are parent-child activities on New Year's Day, which are very interesting. The dishes at Shang Palace are delicious and unique. The only drawback is that it is a bit far from the city center, but fortunately the taxi fare is not high. Also, during the dry season, there is too little water in the river opposite the hotel, which is a pity.

msg:It is a very happy family trip. Children can take a small train, feed animals, ride a hand-cranked boat, archery, Frisbee, do intangible cultural heritage activities, and a children's playground. Parents can also relax in nature, swim and exercise, and the elders in the family can also have morning classes with masters. We can practice Tai Chi together, which is very suitable for a family stay in the hotel.
The food at the hotel tastes great and the service is superb. As soon as I entered the door, I met James from the concierge. His enthusiasm was just right to make people feel warm. Anna and Paco from the activity depar**ent were thoughtful and kind. There were also many unknown brothers and sisters who were very loving to accompany me. The little girl had a lot of fun. Very happy. Wan Xiaofeng at the zoo is kind and attentive, and the children enjoyed feeding the animals. The travel photos provided by the hotel were very good, and Photographer Lin did a great job taking photos, which helped us capture many happy and unforgettable moments. The activities in the intangible cultural heritage space are very suitable for children. Painting rocks and making round fans not only cultivate children's hands-on skills, but also enhance their understanding of traditional culture. Finally, there was an episode. While swimming before leaving, my family charged their mobile phones. When the online taxi arrived at the hotel, I realized that I had forgotten to bring the charger. The beautiful woman at the front desk quickly helped us contact us, and Mr. Zhai from the concierge even rushed around. The hotel's attentive and meticulous service left a deep impression on us. The children were reluctant to leave when we left. It was a New Year's Day trip that the whole family loved.

msg:The hotel environment, hygiene, and service staff are all fine, but there is a lot of room for improvement in the management of the hotel itself. The first is that the check-in efficiency is very low; the second is that the hotel's access card is very insensitive and often malfunctions; the third is that the hotel's buffet restaurant has no personnel to divert people when it is crowded in the morning; the fourth is that the placement of toiletries in the hotel is not checked according to standards. , I left two bottles of shampoo but there was no shower gel, and it was replenished the next day; another most unacceptable thing is that hotel staff can enter at will, the door of the room that has not been checked in is open, and I go out for a walk after checking in in the afternoon After walking around for a while, I found that someone had brought the fruit directly in. We hope to improve all of these. If we don't improve, I'm afraid I won't stay here again, nor will I recommend it to my friends. The hardware facilities of the hotel itself are still very good. This point needs to be clarified.

Intangible cultural heritage handicraft experience: It was a gift item when booking a room. I originally wanted to try it, but it unexpectedly became the highlight of the trip. Teacher Dandan patiently guided me to complete the work. It was a very pleasant experience. I gained not only the work but also the knowledge.
One visit to the Baby Paradise: The baby had a great time. I have to say that Guixiang‚Äôs children‚Äôs entertainment was very powerful and the baby never forgot it.

I said that if there were children, please prepare a set of toiletries. Unexpectedly, the room not only had toiletries, but also a sink station. Chairs, children's toilet seats, children's bathtubs, children's slippers, and bath towels are really all available. The children are super happy.
There is a cute pet paradise in the hotel, and you can play with small trains for a fee. The staff's service is really good. It is no exaggeration to say that I have stayed in so many five-star hotels and have never seen such good service. It was a little cold when I went down in the morning, and the staff offered to help me look after the baby for a while and let me go back and change clothes. Throughout the whole process, he was very patient and accompanied the children to feed the animals. He led us to play with us, explained, and helped us take photos. He even took the initiative to bring us water for us to drink in case we were thirsty. The duck laid eggs, which was very strange to the child because we had never seen them before. The staff actually picked them up. I picked up the duck eggs and gave them to the child.
I secretly took a photo of the name tags of the staff members, Wan Xiaofeng and Li Jinhua. I feel that no words of gratitude to them in person are as good as thanking them here. I hope the hotel leaders can see and praise these two employees.
The breakfast in the hotel is also great, and the kids in the swimming pool also love it. I will stay here next time I go to Guilin. I rarely write reviews. This time it was really because the hotel service was so good.

However, the breakfast variety is a bit limited and the taste is average, especially Guilin rice noodles. Isn't it supposed to be mixed by default? It was actually soup by default. When I asked why it was soup, the waiter was so mean that we blamed us for not telling us... I eat so many rice noodles in Guilin, and by default they are all mixed...

Like the zoo, it is very suitable for such a big baby. When I woke up in the morning, Miss Wan Xiaofeng warmly invited everyone to feed the pigeons, and soon a group of children appeared on the empty grass. The pigeons are fat and clean, and can even be touched, which changed my view of flat-haired animals. Sister Wan also carefully prepared the ingredients for the animal feeding activity in the afternoon, and the children were very happy. Manager Song of the zoo was serious and responsible, patiently explained the habits of various animals, and had a friendly exchange with the peacocks that were molting. The children learned a lot of new knowledge.

The art activities of the summer camp can bring back many beautiful souvenirs, making the trip more meaningful.

The hotel's children's world has three-story slides, jumping beds, and various facilities for playing house. After the cub went there once, he strongly asked to go again the next day.

From the back door of the hotel is the Lijiang River, you can go down to the river to play in the water and fish.

msg:There are huge doubts about the management of this Shangri-La. I have been staying in hotels for more than 4 months since I returned to China. Marriott/Hyatt/Accor are already mid/high-level members. In the fourth quarter of this year, I stayed in this hotel for more than a month through third-party and official bookings in a short period of time. As a result, I didn‚Äôt accumulate points for two nights. When I was doing the Double 11 event, I wanted to book a luxury club package. I asked a total of three people at the front desk and told me that this activity cannot be scored. I was confused. I paid at the hotel front desk to renew my room, but I couldn't earn points by booking a room directly with the internal staff. Later, I found out that I had purchased the wrong internal staff channel. Shangri-La officially has an activity with the same price that allows you to accumulate nights by points. It purely reflects how unfamiliar these three staff members are with their company's activities, and how uneasy they are about members accumulating points and nights. I have made a third-party reservation for this hotel for half a month, and the rest are official direct reservations, so I am still one night away from being upgraded from a gold member to an emerald member. However, due to the two wrong nights, the membership level cannot be upgraded. I have been waiting for the hotel to make up the nights and points, but it has been a week since I checked out, and it is still far away. I can‚Äôt go to the next Shangri-La to use my membership rights. Could it be that I missed two nights in Guilin? So funny. My new hotel is ready to check out and I have collected points. What am I waiting for? ? Frequent flyers mine their points system

But before I left, I found that not only was the price cheaper, but I could cancel it at any time, which made me a bit speechless. After the key feedback, there is no response, huh, huh.
Room facilities: There were mold spots on the walls of the room, and there were black spots on the pillows. I asked to change the pillowcases, but I was given an environmental reminder to recycle them! Then give me a clean pillowcase! Speechless! Once you turn off the water, the shower will fall and you will be hit on the head. Be careful if there are old people and children!
Location and transportation: It is basically around 15 to take a taxi when you go out, which is not particularly convenient.
Service: Except for the service staff at the door to help open the door and take the luggage, I didn't feel it. The basic facilities were not introduced at the front desk.
It is understandable that the hotel will take a long time, but basic maintenance can still be done, such as removing mold and odor, changing bedding and towels, free drinking water, and even the lid is hard to open... continue Put it badly, anyway, it won't come again.

He also took care of our ideas in terms of communication. The results were beautiful. It was a pity that it was raining heavily that day and I couldn't take many outdoor shots. What is particularly worth mentioning is that I received a call from the hotel right after I got off the plane. My mother had forgotten a sun hat and asked me for my address to send it back. Thank you to Miss Lu from the housekeeping depar**ent for your attentiveness! It was really a pleasure. I will choose Shangri-La Hotel again when I travel in the future.

msg:Guilin Shangri-La is still a little far from the city center, and you need to take a taxi when you go out. Fortunately, it is very convenient to take a taxi in downtown Guilin. The hotel facilities are slightly outdated, and the parent-child layout is more careful. There is a small zoo, an outdoor paddling pool, an indoor swimming pool and a special swimming lane for children. However, the outdoor swimming pool is only open from 15:00 to 20:00 in the afternoon, which is not very friendly to tourists, because it is relatively sunny during the day, and children usually go out to visit scenic spots in the afternoon, and children do not have fun. Shangri-La's breakfast is as rich as ever. The hotel is separated by a road from the Lijiang River. This section is relatively dry and there is not much water; in fact, you can only see a little bit of the river in the river view room, which is a bit disappointing. But on the other side of the hotel, there is a construction site with no scenery at all. There are fruit shops and supermarkets around the hotel, as well as various small restaurants, which can provide some supplies. In short, if you don't want to be so noisy in the city center, this place is suitable for families and children.

I was very lucky to meet Ms. Lily Wang in the executive lounge (Horizon Club Lounge) who served us well last time. She helped us upgrade the children's favorite room with balcony. And... Our flight back was delayed, and she arranged the late check-out very considerately. Really helped us, really great service.

In addition, I think all the service staff in this hotel except the service staff in the executive lounge are very good. There are also free travel photos that are also very good! Because the service for foreigners is also very good, so as a foreigner, it is recommended to choose this hotel.

The first trip to the forest from Shangri-La was a great success ~ thank you very much!

msg:Let me give you some background first: the executive floor of the Shangri-La brand is called "Luxury Club". Now let's officially start the review.
Positive point:
1. The attitude of the service staff is very enthusiastic, including the front desk, concierge, PA sister, etc.
2. Although I don‚Äôt take care of children myself, I can see that there are many kinds of entertainment facilities for children.
3. The view outside the window is okay, but if you don‚Äôt just stay in the hotel and will go out for fun, there is no need to buy a high-priced room for this view.
Negative points:
1. The small refrigerator in the minibar of the executive room is not open. There are no snacks except a few bottles of regular drinks. There are only two bottles of mineral water and it is ice dew;
2. The breakfast service in the executive lounge clearly appeared in the brochure in the guest room, but the front desk told us that breakfast is not available in the executive lounge and needs to be squeezed into the unified breakfast room. During the summer travel peak, I almost couldn‚Äôt find a seat for breakfast. . Not to mention the executive lounge check-in service mentioned in the brochure. If I really bring it up, will the front desk receptionist think that I am unworldly? ? ?
Summarize:
It‚Äôs worth staying for families with children. Just stay in the basic room type. The best price is less than 1,000 yuan/room/night. The view itself is not unique. The executive floor does not have any special advantages except the executive lounge happy hour (available from 17-19 o'clock, equivalent to a dinner). The view rooms and executive rooms are slightly redundant.

Secondly, as a parent-child hotel, all parent-child activities cost money! Children's Paradise is 69 yuan for an hour and a half, and 118 yuan for a day! But the point is that the environment of the children's playground looks the same as that of the villages and towns. Where is the value of 118? In summer, the outdoor pool is only open from 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm. At other times, children can only go indoors if they want to swim, but children like outdoor pools. After all, outdoor pools are more friendly to children in terms of temperature and depth. The breakfast is quite rich, but I suggest that the small wonton stall should be removed, otherwise I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to wait for a bowl of wonton in my life! It's embarrassing to take my child to eat the buffet. The two of them went to pick up the meal together and left a pack of wet wipes to occupy the seat.

The river view room can see the beautiful river view and swimming pool view. The outdoor swimming pool and recreational facilities are very suitable for families with children. The park is relatively large and green, and the small signs with the names of each plant are full of details and textures. You can walk to the riverside after a walk. Rich breakfast, I will stay here again next time.
Special thanks to Ms. Yang Yuqian from the Guest Relations Depar**ent for her thoughtful follow-up service throughout the whole process, allowing our family to experience the service of a five-star hotel as home away from home.

Outdoor and indoor pools keep kids entertained. There are plenty of parking spaces, and the breakfast meets the 5-star positioning. The front desk reception is well-trained, but the welcome and doorman are useless, and the welcome fruit is not 5-star. During the stay, there was construction in front of the hotel.

Hotel peripherals are not bad

Make complaints:
1. I bring children to check in at night, there are no toiletries for the children, and no one answers the call to the front desk at 12 o'clock in the evening. May I ask if the five-star hotel is not hot, 24 hours? The next day, I told the front desk that I needed supplies for children, but I still didn‚Äôt have any when I came back at noon, and I told the cleaning staff to give them. It‚Äôs summer vacation, isn‚Äôt it basic awareness?
2. There are very few breakfast items, only bread, rice noodles, fried eggs, and fruits.
3. When I was looking for a place in the hotel, I couldn‚Äôt see any people. I didn‚Äôt know who to ask, but there was only someone at the front desk in the lobby.
4. The bathtub is as shown in the picture, and the toiletries are too lazy to complain.
5. There is no service to speak of. Before I left, I saw that the relevant account had arrived, but I was very enthusiastic!

The ostriches in the hotel are poorly raised! Hungry, I have been pecking at the railing and pecking at the grass. It makes me feel distressed. I hope the hotel can pay attention to it.
When I booked, it was said that there was welcome fruit, but there was none at all. In summary, the hard facilities met my expectations, and the service was not treated attentively.

The well-equipped gym must be a five-star praise. If you want to travel to Guilin, you can boldly choose Shangri-La, but the peak is coming soon. You should book in advance with Ctrip.

She was very patient and answered my questions very quickly and in detail. In the end, I accepted most of her advice. The suggested itinerary is 10 minutes enjoyable and the elderly are 10 minutes happy.

The room depar**ent had planned in advance that our rooms would be adjacent to each other. This was our request. Not only did they meet our request, they also specially selected two rooms with the most beautiful views.

We asked the hotel car to pick us up at the station and take us to the hotel. The two-day trip after 20 was also a chartered car, as well as the return trip.
We had arranged for the same driver to come to us earlier
The driver, Master Xiao, was enthusiastic and enthusiastic, especially since we had two elderly people. His driving skills were very stable and he also helped us take photos. He was punctual and had a good attitude. On the last day, we were late because we had to go back to the station. The hotel was very enthusiastic and called the waiter to come to the room to help us with our luggage.
 
On the first day, we went to the small zoo in the hotel. The waiter there, Ms. Lily Wan, was very enthusiastic. She explained the animals very carefully and even took photos for our family.

On the morning of the last day, we booked a travel photo shoot delivered by the hotel. They sent someone to contact us in advance.
That morning, Xixi took photos for us. We didn‚Äôt prepare anything. Egg Tart was very patient. The framing was also very good. He was knowledgeable and stirred up the a**osphere. The service was very good.

The rice noodle stall is hidden away. The Holiday Inn Express I stayed in before was served outside. The breakfast sausage is also the cheapest variety. All children's activities are charged, children's playground is 99 yuan, rock climbing is 80 yuan, and feeding small animals is 50 yuan. The rock climbing instructor and the aunt who feeds the small animals are what I want to praise the most. They are sincere and sincerely take the children to play, encourage the children to climb up, and try their best to make the peacock open. Others at the front desk during check-in and the waiters at Shang Palace dining feel more professional. In general, it is okay to bring your baby to experience it.

msg:The overall environment of this Shangri-La is good, but the facilities are a bit outdated, and there are no USB charging heads in the room. The breakfast is also very average. I only ate small wontons and rice noodles for two consecutive days.
There is really no fun in downtown Guilin. During the holidays, there are still traffic jams in the urban area. Fortunately, the hotel has a swimming pool. This season, the outdoor ones are not open, only the indoor ones are open.
There is a pool outside where you can play boats, but it costs 30 yuan for ten minutes. I thought the advertised indoor children's playground could be fun, but it turned out that it charged 100 per person, which is outrageous. . . So the so-called parent-child hotel is that the activities and facilities are charged extra, which is far worse than similar hotels in Sanya! üôÉüôÉ

The rich children's activities in the hotel are especially recommended, and the children had a great time.

Rock climbing instructors will patiently guide and try their best to help children climb to the top. The small zoo is the favorite of children. There is a time in the morning and in the afternoon where you can buy feed and vegetables from the staff to feed the animals. There are not as many people as in the park, and the animals are all very active. It was amazing to see the peacock spread its tail for two consecutive days, and the bunny is also super cute. The staff of the small animal area, Wan Xiaofeng and Manager Song, are very caring for animals and children.

Generally speaking, it is perfect, suitable for families with children. The only downside is the game world on the second floor. The original VR games and shooting games are gone. There are only shooting machines and darts. There are only two darts and the target board is broken. The rest are almost all computer games. , it is not good for children to play computer games for a long time.

msg:The purpose of traveling to Guilin during the Spring Festival is very clear, to walk the baby. In Ctrip's parent-child list, I selected two top-ranked urban hotels, and Shangri-La satisfied my baby the most.
Location: A hotel in the city center, 15 minutes by taxi from Guilin North Railway Station. The Two Rivers, Four Lakes, and Elephant Trunk Hill are all nearby. You can see the Lijiang River from the window sill. The location is super good.
Dining: The breakfast buffet is great, as is the lunch buffet. The afternoon tea in the lobby bar is also great. There is also a Chinese restaurant, which I didn't have time to eat. The street opposite the hotel is full of food, there are rice noodle shops and barbecue shops, and the taste is very good. There is also a large supermarket.
Room: I bought a winter camp package. There is a tent in the room. The five-year-old was so happy to see it. Even the child‚Äôs father likes to sleep in it, saying it is more comfortable than a bed.
Walking the baby: The winter camp is rich in activities, and there are special activity groups, which will be reminded before each activity. I bought a winter camp and learned that the second child is only two years old. The small train, rowing boat, and playground are all free for us to use. It was an unexpected surprise and I was very happy. You can also feed ostriches and watch rabbits and peacocks, which is full of fun. The gold coin treasure hunt and bonfire party are also super hot. When I got home, I asked my child, and she said that she really liked Shangri-La and everything. Did you say there are Shangri-Las in other places? still going...

When you open the door for a guest, you will also emphasize that I opened the door for you, which will give people the feeling that they are serving you.
Secondly, I queued up for 30 minutes at the front desk to check in. I don‚Äôt understand why there are so many people in line but only two windows are open for check-in, and it is very slow. There is actually one person in line in front of me, but I still waited for 30 minutes. I finally got in line. It was already a little later in the afternoon and I was told that I couldn‚Äôt check in, saying that there were only rooms available after 2:00 in the afternoon. I had no choice but to hang around outside for 2 hours, waiting to be notified. The actual notification time was 3:00 in the afternoon, and the outside was very, very hot. The whole mess up our plans. What made me even more angry was that when I went back to get my room card, I had to go through the process of queuing for half an hour to check in again. Then the waiter in the lobby also had a bad attitude and was very impatient with the guests.
The room card I was given couldn't be swiped to open the room after being used once. I don't know why, so I had to go back and swipe it again and again.
What‚Äôs even more funny is that they let us check in at three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, but asked us to check out before twelve o‚Äôclock the next day. What kind of logic is this?

It can be said that this is a hotel with no service! Highly not recommended, Shangri-La‚Äôs overall facilities and services are backward

There are three points that are okay, cheap, good spa, and walking across the Li River in the sunset is beautiful.

msg:After staying for two consecutive days, I was not happy when I finally left. Because the old hotel is a five-star hotel, it is better to choose the service. There is no charging pile, and it is inconvenient to drive the tram. Get takeout by yourself. There is no comb in the room, and it is inconvenient without a handbag. When I finally left, the car couldn't get out. When checking in and checking out, there are repeated confirmations of the registration of the license plate number. In the end, I still couldn't get out, and turned around again. The concierge at the door had no sense of service and a bad attitude. The only thing worth mentioning is that the environment of the hotel courtyard is very good, with many animals and plants. Hope to improve and become a standard A-level hotel.

The breakfast is particularly commendable. There are not only excellent Guilin specialties, but also Western-style breakfasts that children love. Zhenzhen kept asking us what else we need.

One is the can of beer in the mini bar. After that, I opened it with a groan and listened to the free gift. Only Guilin Shangri-La charges a fee. Although 8 yuan is very cost-effective, it lacks a familiar feeling and the taste of home. The second point is that the garden leads to the riverside. The door, regardless of whether you go in or out, walked around the wet muddy roads of the two construction sites in the dark at night and came back. The soles of the shoes were covered with mud. The maintenance is just an excuse. I don‚Äôt believe in electronic technology. Guilin University of Aeronautics and Astronautics can tolerate a fault. Except for these two points, it is still five-star. Shangri-La is trustworthy.

Here are two things to talk about: First, the hotel has done a good job of protecting its employees. All front-line staff are accompanied by protective masks and also wear masks. The second problem is a very serious incident! ! On the second morning of check-in, at around 6:30, I heard a woman in the next room answering the phone. I was very excited, and there were various coughing sounds in the room one after another. There is also the sound of opening and closing doors. I immediately got up and went downstairs to find the management staff of the hotel to report. I saw all kinds of garbage piled up at the door of her room, including paper bags for medicines delivered by Meituan. When I arrived at the lobby, I met a man in a black uniform. He said he was the manager on duty. I explained the situation to him. I was very worried that the guest in the next room was infected with the new crown virus, and it was possible in such an irresponsible way It will spread in the hotel. The manager also immediately arranged for someone to clean up the garbage, and called the residents for consultation. There were six of us as a 75 year old with two 8 year olds. There are three rooms, and the middle of the two rooms is the lady's room. So we decided to check out early and leave the hotel (we were supposed to stay for 2 days). Unexpectedly, when I left the room, I met this lady with two young children, all of whom were not wearing masks. Walk casually in the hotel (it should be to have breakfast). Now I don't know how many passengers who stayed in Shangri-La, Guilin were infected that day. But six of us, five of us started showing symptoms of different new crown infections the next day: fever, fever! fever! So here I will not accept any reply from Guilin Shangri-La Hotel. There is a problem with your management, which is a very serious problem. It is your responsibility and concern for your employees to protect them. I like it, but many guests in the hotel don't wear masks, and there is no service staff to remind them. I hope Shangri-La management company will seriously think about it.

On the second morning of our stay, we also took the initiative to ask about our rest situation and what else we needed, etc. In short, it was both attentive and considerate! Likeüëç

Luna and Sophia, who checked in at the front desk, are not only well-trained, but also have a friendly attitude and arrange my needs properly. The decoration of the hotel is elegant and a**ospheric, which belongs to the consistent style of Shangri-La. Since the hotel has been in operation for more than 10 years, the facilities and equipment are outdated. Fortunately, the hotel is properly maintained and does not affect the experience of guests at all, which is impressive. The cleaning of the room was also very professional. Julie, the floor attendant, brought me a buckwheat pillow and repeatedly asked me if I had any other needs. There are not many choices of high-end chain hotels in the city of Guilin. If you want to live comfortably and at ease, choose Shangri-La!
The only fly in the oin**ent of the hotel is that the management of the breakfast restaurant is slightly chaotic. Many waiters lack training and are often overwhelmed by the requirements of the guests. The entire team lacks unified and coordinated management. I hope it can be improved.
However, I still love this Shangri-La, and I will still choose Shangri-La in Guilin in the future!

I chose another hotel for the second time because I wanted to live near Binjiang Road so that I could eat snacks and go shopping on Zhengyang Street. Shangri-La's facilities are great, with a game room, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a paddling pool for children, a small interactive zoo, a small train to sit on, and more. In terms of accommodation, it is an old hotel, but it is still clean and reassuring. The little beauty at the front desk enthusiastically added WeChat to inform the amu*****t and consumption matters. The breakfast is pretty good and comprehensive. It seems that there are still snacks that need to be queued up. If you bring your parents and children, you will stay at Shangri-La again.

As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, it is very stylish, but when you enter the room, you will be greeted with a decoration style of the 1980s. The bathroom space is cramped, the toilet seat is yellow, and the hardware facilities are not good. The key details are also poorly done. First, only one box of paper is placed in the bathroom, and the room is not equipped; second, the kettle is also very old and dirty, and it can be replaced without much money; third, The TV is also very small and old, and cannot support screen projection, and the screen feels a little fuzzy; then the toilet will also smell bad from time to time. . . Then the room was also very cold, even with the air conditioner turned off, it still felt cold.
Then the buffet breakfast is not very good, the dishes are not good, I don‚Äôt like Chinese style, maybe porridge, noodles, wontons should be available, rice noodles are also light, but Western-style salami is also not available, and fresh juice is not available, anyway. There's not much to look forward to, and if it wasn't included in the room rate, I wouldn't pay for it.
The night I stayed, I also went to see the buffet dinner, but I didn't have much to eat, so I went to Shang Palace to eat a la carte. This beer fish is still very good! Probably the only one I remember from Shangri-La, Guilin, because it is not spicy, it is freshly made, the fish is delicious, there are no bones, and the tomato, celery and tofu are accompanied by a taste. The other is taro, pumpkin and coconut juice. Yes, and the soup is also sweet.
The scenery outside the window is okay, but because the trip is nearing the end, it may not be too amazing. If it is the first day to stay, it may be better~ There are some small animals and camping tents in the garden, which may also be suitable for children to play.
Compared to the other 2 hotels in this itinerary, there is no harm without comparison

The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools. I personally think that because there are some swimming lessons indoors, it is not very good for guests staying in the hotel during the summer vacation. They have to swim with many people. The outdoor ones are closed too early, and they don‚Äôt get sunburned until five o‚Äôclock. It closes at 6 o'clock, and it's nice to walk around the outdoor area of the hotel at night.
Shangri-La has always felt that the breakfast is richer than many hotels of the same level, and Guilin's is also ok. There are some areas, as well as the local specialties of Guilin Braised Vegetable Noodles and Camellia.
The hotel room is not too big, and the equipment is average, but it is a parent-child hotel. It is very considerate to welcome fruits and provide some toiletries for children. Of course, there is also Ctrip's housekeeper service, adding WeChat to help deal with some needs in time, and care Ask about the stay experience, like!
Finally, the location is very suitable for traveling to the surrounding classics. When the noon is the hottest, children can also spend a happy time in the playground on the second floor. I personally recommend staying at Shangri-La.

Service: What is the most important thing about staying in a hotel? I think it's service because it directly affects your mood. Shangri-La, as an old-fashioned hotel with little advantages in facilities, made us unhesitating to give it a full five-star rating for its service beyond expectations.
If you don't know how to use Ctrip's platinum room upgrade privileges when you check in, the kyling at the front desk takes the initiative to handle it and arrives at the room with the view; the porter is polite; the executive chef walks by himself during the breakfast rush hour Lianfeng was busy, wrapping wontons and frying fritters; the children wanted to eat üçä, and Aunt Huang (Serena) immediately went to help us get it, which was very heartwarming. The best part is the parent-child activities. Anna, Pato and Susan are well organized. In the picture, the beautiful and kind-hearted Miss Susan is holding the children to wash their hands. Barry and another little brother at the archery depar**ent are also super nice. Children enjoy watching ostriches play in the playground and take a bubble bath. A family-friendly hotel. It's okay to soak for a day.

Environment: Looking up to see the mountains, pushing the window to see the river, you can go directly to the river from the hotel garden.

Transportation: It's very convenient to come from the airport or take a taxi, and to go for a string at night.

All in all a very satisfying stay. I don't know if Guilin people are so nice or the hotel has good training, which left a very good impression on us. I hope that the epidemic will subside, and I will stay in Shangri-La next time I come to Guilin. I hope that these hard-working people here will reciprocate. Oh by the way, this package from Ctrip is also very valuable. I like Ctrip. Everyone must overcome the epidemic üò∑!

There were too many activities to play, so I didn't go anywhere in the two days I arrived in Guilin. Teacher Xiaopao is undoubtedly the treasure of Shangri-La. From morning till night, he is the one who checks in and sign up for the summer camp, he is the one who leads the exercise in the morning, he is the parent-child activity on the lawn in the morning, and he is the little fireman or making pizza in the afternoon. He was the one who took the dip, he was also the one who took the treasure hunt at night, and he was the one who drove the little train until nine o'clock in the evening. With such a fight, I really doubt that Shangri-La gave him shares. Of course, the summer camp also has services such as travel photography and afternoon tea, which are all good. Only five photos will be sent for travel photography, and the rest will cost extra. Objectively speaking, it is not bad to shoot for children. Finally, when returning from Yangshuo, continue to stay at Shangri-La. Such intimate parent-child service really makes the children linger, adding a lot of joy to the holiday. By the way, there is also a projector in the room, which really makes people not want to leave the hotel for a moment. Of course, there is still room for improvement, such as front desk service, come on!

Guilin's summer is cooler than expected, especially in the morning and night, and the children living in the hotel are very happy. Participated in the hotel summer camp activities, Susan, Anna and the summer camp teacher Pato are responsible for organizing the summer camp activities, from the morning bumper boat, lawn Frisbee, handicraft activities, water flying carpet, bubble bath, garden treasure hunt, small animals Feeding is very appealing to children.
Finally, some digressions. Guilin and Yangshuo became famous very early, but in recent years, I feel that they have gone down a bit. When choosing Guilin Yangshuo Hotel this time, I found that Guilin and Yangshuo hotels lack the middle ground of chain hotels. There are several high-end hotels and homestays all over the place. There are too few domestic and foreign chain hotels, which greatly affects the travel quality and experience.

msg:In the summer parent-child tour, I chose the old brand Shangri-La among the many recommendations. It really lived up to my expectations. It was impeccable in terms of site selection and gardens. Every shot was a beautiful view, but the parent-child activities exceeded my expectations. FOOD!
The parent-child activities are very rich. In fact, children have the right to speak. The children enjoy all the activities of the hotel. After leaving the hotel, they are still talking about the teacher. The children‚Äôs fun also allows parents to relax‚ò∫Ô∏è

Breakfast: The variety of breakfast is not particularly rich, but it is absolutely excellent. The first recommendation is fried dough sticks + nest egg beef porridge. This combination must be served twice a day. Guilin rice noodles and wontons taste very good. When Master Wang Zhenshan sees me, he will always warmly make crispy fried dough sticks for us. He must praise üëçüèª

Dinner: Since we are all with children, we choose to dine at Shang Palace in the hotel. Most of them are local specialties, which satisfies our purpose of coming to Guilin to find delicious food, and the taste is very good! Vinegar blood duck, Lipu taro, beer fish, passion fruit lilyüëçüèª During the restaurant, Master Yang and Master Sun also came to the box to ask if we were satisfied with the dishes. The service was really meticulous!
Five-star recommendation

The hotel is on the edge of the Li River, and it takes 5 minutes to walk to the beach of the Li River. All the main attractions in the city require a taxi, and the basic taxi fee is 10-20 yuan. There is nothing to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and all are taxis to Dongxixiang to eat. The hotel restaurant, Tang Palace Chinese Restaurant, had a meal, and the taste was just average. The swimming pool is well received, the outdoor and indoor swimming pools are very comfortable and meet the 5-star standard. There are kids bubble machines and kids pool parties on time every day at 5pm. The service is 5-star standard. Unfortunately, the room facilities are old and the toilet is defective.

We had afternoon tea in the lobby bar, but we came to the lobby bar and were told that there were only drinks and no desserts. I was wondering why there was no dessert in the afternoon tea, and even communicated with the assistant lobby manager who was broadcasting live at the time and told the executive room that there was only happy hour and no afternoon tea. And I also used a strange feeling to despise others and said that you can drink the coffee soft drinks in the package in the room. , and it was not a phone call. The manager on duty that day was really responsible. During the lobby bar, Wang Zehui, who was serving at the time, said that we were a little hungry after driving for a day, and we took it when we failed to communicate with the hotel. Egg tarts, bread, snacks and fruits are really good. In the evening, the manager on duty called again and gave him a bottle of red wine. Picture 3, I haven't figured out why there is still a door in the room. It's trivial, but always Feeling insecure! The hotel breakfast is very good, comparable to the Intercontinental Hotel!

In the lobby bar, there was nothing you could eat. There was no Chris**as cake, only nougat on display, nothing. I bought a box out of patience and couldn't describe the taste. I looked at the production date and it was ten days old. Well, I ate a sample. Let's talk about the house facilities, they are really old. The soundproofing was not that good. I was really speechless. I thought I was staying in a hotel. The bed was soft and the bedding was heavy, so I couldn't sleep well all night. Really the worst five-star hotel I've ever stayed in. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. Well, due to the influence of the masks, we were given something to eat, and we picked up some fresh things to wrap our bellies in hastily.

üîîService: It is indeed the level of Shangri-La. The service is better than the hardware. Thank you Luna and Amanda for their care

üçÉEnvironment: The oversized garden looks good even on rainy days. From the window, you can see the Lijiang River in the flood. It's not unique after all.


üöó Transportation: It is not the most core scenic spot, but fortunately it is quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle. There is a small gate that leads directly to the Lijiang River in two minutes, which is especially suitable for walking in the evening.

In particular, Shang Palace's Cantonese cuisine is quite good, not worse than Cantonese, so affordable

The hotel has a heated swimming pool and gym, as well as Western and Chinese restaurants, all of which are very suitable for bringing children on vacation. The room can also choose to have tents or no tents. If you have a baby, it is recommended to book a parent-child room. When we checked into Shangri-La Hotel, we were delayed for a while at the front desk due to some problems. The duty manager of the hotel, Amanda, came forward to help solve the problem and sent us to our room. Also gave my little one a small gift. My little friend loves the gifts she prepared. The next day, she decided to stay and wanted to change rooms. She went to the big night, and not only called her colleague Lily to help when she was resting. He also followed up on things in person. Helped me solve a lot of problems. Don't rush to complain when you encounter something, you can find Amanda

msg:Familiar brands, familiar scents, when you step into Shangri-La Hotel, Guilin, you will feel at home as always. Compared with Shangri-La in other cities, this trip to Guilin impressed me a lot.
At the beginning of stepping into the hotel, from the epidemic prevention reception at the door, concierge, to check-in, I felt the enthusiasm of the city of Guilin and the delicate tradition of Shangri-La.
Especially during check-in, EVE and Sienna took the initiative to introduce more suitable room types according to our family's accommodation needs, and applied for discounts very thoughtfully. It was so sweet to know that we were going out during the day and asked HSKP to prepare enough drinking water in advance. like!!!
The comfortable bed greatly relieves the fatigue of playing a day. A wide variety of breakfast allows us to go out and play full of energy.
The most distinctive thing is that the hotel is located on the bank of the Li River. The river view room we lived in faced Yushan and Diecai Mountain, and the typical karst mountains and ancient towers came into view in minutes. Morning & afternoon & setting sun & night, the four o'clock scenery are all beautiful.
Although it is not next to the noisy urban attractions, it is very close to some major attractions and has convenient transportation. It is the best choice for visiting Guilin!

Later, when I checked out, I met a young aunt with glasses, and I heard her name is Niki. This is the most polite young aunt I have met. She is gentle and attentive. She will ask me how I felt during my stay at the hotel and give me a quick Check out.

At night, you can accompany the children to sit in the tent and watch the projection (thanks to Qin Linghua from the housekeeping depar**ent, who originally came to deliver fruit at that time, took the initiative It is recommended to watch the projection and help us to debug it clearly);
2. For the winter camp package ordered, Miss Susan and Anna brought a few children to make dumplings, handicrafts, and feeding in the mini-zoo on the first day of the new year (Miss Tang Jie, the breeder, is very good, not only patiently instructing feeding methods, but also more I gave the child a fresh vegetable to satisfy the child), and there is a home theater at night. It has been raining and very cold during the Spring Festival in Guilin. It just happened that the hotel's K20 growth activities filled the blank time when they were unwilling to go out. Children like parents to worry about it;
3. The activities in the lobby on New Year's Eve were really lively and rich. Even the general manager personally went to the scene to make dumplings and cook dumplings for everyone, and felt the warmth and caring of the big-name hotels to the guests;
4. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeepers Xiao Xu and Amanda. From check-in to check-out, all check-in details and dining itinerary were followed up in time for feedback. My wife was satisfied, and our family spent an unforgettable Spring Festival in the Year of the Tiger.
I wish the hotel will develop better and better, see you next time üëãüèª

When checking in, the hotel room had a problem that Shangri-La should not have, and the service was awarded to the front desk with 5 points. Liao Shijing and Han Wenjing, thank them for their professional and friendly service. Let‚Äôs talk about what the hotel needs to improve: the service of the security outside the hotel lobby needs to be improved. Almost all security guards will not take the initiative to greet guests. One night when they went out and walked around, a security guard and a female colleague kept chatting outside the hotel and asked him if he had a taxi. He said that let us go out and take a taxi by ourselves. Perhaps in his mind, chatting with colleagues is more important than serving guests. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs catering. The Chinese restaurant Shang Palace offers a dim sum buffet at lunchtime. I thought that Shang Palace‚Äôs dishes would be good, so I ate it. I was disappointed. In general, the fried noodles in the last picture are even worse. When it came up, it was not hot. Not to mention that the noodles seemed to have been soaked for a long time. The taste was even worse. Although it is a buffet, the minimum dish quality must be guaranteed. After all, it is Shangri-La Shang Palace, not the street. Small restaurant, hope the hotel will pay attention to improvement

The location of the hotel is relatively far away, and there is nothing to eat and shop around except the hotel within walking distance. The "River View Room" that has been upgraded with money can only see such a little river view. There is also a construction site next to it. The indoor swimming pool that the little friends were looking forward to was closed, and the hotel did not apologize or send the children any amu*****t items in the hotel as compensation. The most irritating thing is that the weather was only a few ten degrees lower. We stayed on the 5th floor. The kid slept all night and got bitten over 20 bags. He was distressed and wronged. I didn‚Äôt want to mention it. It was an accommodation that greatly affected the travel mood. , Really smashed the Shangri-La brand.

Choosing to book with Ctrip is also a wise choice. If you directly book the River View Room on October 5-7 (National Day) through Shangri-La App, double breakfast is not included 1330+; breakfast is sold separately for 128 per person. Ctrip booked River View Room with 1150 breakfast. Decisively chose Ctrip.

The rooms are arranged in 569 and 563 on the 5th floor, and the view is good. During the stay, I experienced the dinner at Shang Palace and the osmanthus-themed afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge (118 for two persons). The dinner at Shang Palace was originally more than 400. Report your Shangri-La membership number (I am a low-level gold member) and enjoy a 15% discount. In the end, it only costs 350, which is very affordable.

The hotel‚Äôs garden is directly connected to the Li River. It is still very convenient. Then, there are ostriches and peacocks in the hotel garden.

During my stay, I experienced that the swimming pool is 25m long. The facilities are very good.

Overall, it is a great hotel. The service is also very good. It is worth staying experience.

Bea from the concierge sent us welcome fruits! The breakfast is very rich, and the chef delivers bread, biscuits and juices for us every day. We also received Mooncakes for the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is very heartwarming and will stay again next time!

The luggage rack in the room is extremely dirty. The room feels very humid, with a musty smell.
The location is not particularly convenient, you need to take a taxi.
There is still a gap between Shangri-La and other places.

Wan Xiaofeng was afraid that the child would be bitten by mosquitoes, so he squatted and sprayed mosquito repellent water. Li Jinhua accompanied the child to feed the small animals and explained to the child. You can go to the riverside to play in the water by crossing the road. Next time I come to Guilin, I will choose Shangri-La.

The cleaning aunts are very responsible and clean up in a timely and thorough manner. Although it is an old hotel, the maintenance is still very good. To the cleaning aunts, you have worked hard! During the period, I broke the paper box for personal reasons. Yuki was also worried about whether my hand was injured, so I replaced the broken items in time. It is really people-oriented! There are shirley, harper, and Eric in charge of the summer camp activities. They are well organized and patient. I'm sorry to take the small train during your rest time. Thank you very much.

The summer camp package I ordered was just perfunctory, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be rich in activities, feeding animals, plants, rowing, swimming pool floating carpets, and movies at night, and the playroom was also fun. The kids didn‚Äôt want to go out anyway. Next time I come to Guilin, I will book Shangri-La. Going out from the back door is the Lijiang River where you can play in the water and catch snails.

Because I saw other people's comments that late check-out until four o'clock, afternoon tea was delivered. The proposal was rejected by the supervisor when checking in, okay! July is the peak season. However, the late check-out of the hotel reached three o'clock, and it was upgraded to a Horizon Club check-in. Hotel facilities and five-star are still in line. We were very touched by the service of the red doorman. He helped us pack the souvenir in a cardboard box, delivered it to the door, and put it on the car. Shangri-La's service is still okay.
However, the quality of catering in Guilin Shangri-La is far from that of Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Beijing Shangri-La. The only downside!

It has its own garden and its own outdoor swimming pool and zoo, suitable for parent-child travel. The room sleeps a family of three without any problems. The beautiful view of the Lijiang River outside the window on the 6th floor
Room facilities:
The room facilities are very complete, and the aunt who cleans up is particularly good. Asking for water and things are very patient.
Watching the sun slowly fall in the room, the lights are on, it's so romantic! Passing through the back door of the hotel garden, the water of the Lijiang River is not deep enough to reach a point on the calf to play. The emphasis is on Fang Weilin and Wang Jun from the concierge for helping us pack special products, run the car and bind the room, and very patiently find me a patch panel, service and quality. Great (the room does not have a lot of sockets and the equipment is not enough to charge hahaha) We booked the room separately for 5 days and booked the river view room at the back of the building and the front desk three days ago. When I arrived, I meant to go through the formalities separately and the service was very attentive
Breakfast: If you don‚Äôt have time to eat, you can pack bread and ham jam on the road. It‚Äôs especially friendly for those who don‚Äôt have time to have breakfast. Unlike some hotels, the package service is not as good as Shangri-La.
Overall, the overall quality of Shangri-La's service facility staff is really higher than anywhere else

We arrived early in Guilin due to an early flight, but the staff was very attentive and considerate. Here I would like to thank Mr. Lu Wenjin at the front desk. He saw me with the elderly and children, and helped me check in in advance. Our executive mountain view room has been upgraded to a higher level so that we can settle down, otherwise my family will have to sit in the hall for a long time. Thank you, Mr. Lu.
The food in the executive lounge is very good, the dining environment is very quiet, the waiters inside are very kind, and every time we leave after the meal, they will tell us to sit down when we are tired, which makes people feel very cordial .
If I come to Guilin again next time, we will definitely stay again. I also hope that Shangri-La can do better and better.

       You can walk down to the Li River in three minutes from the back door of the hotel. Under the Yushan Bridge, many Guilin people are playing and fishing. The Lijiang River is the best gift from nature to Guilin.

        We will bring the baby back next holiday. Shangri-La is really great.

msg:We have stayed in several hotels this time, and the Shangri-La Hotel in Guilin is the most impressive! Because the plane was late, we arrived at the hotel in the early morning, and the Lavender who helped us check in was very enthusiastic, because we were the first time to Guilin, and had "100,000 why" for the itinerary, she was very patient and detailed. We went very smoothly for the next few days and the family had a great time. The upgraded river view room has a beautiful view, the hotel also has a child's favorite heated swimming pool, and the water is not willing to come out. Lavender said that Guilin has many beautiful places in addition to Lijiang Yangshuo. Come back next time, you will live in Shangri-La!
