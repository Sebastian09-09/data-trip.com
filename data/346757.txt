msg:We stayed there second time and it‚Äôs a wonderful peaceful place, not crowded, the perfect place to calm down from the busy Shanghai. We stayed in a Pool Villa what is really wonderful. All the staff is so nice and helpful, we needed the Covid Test at day 3 in Hainan and the hotel driver brought us to the local hospital to do it, very convenient, total time 20 minutes. The only weak point is the restaurant, very slow service, one hour to get drinks, maybe a communication problem. And restaurant is very loud. The other days we chose the bar for dinner, quiet, outside seating and drinks and food much quicker. When we need a quiet place we will always come back!

The medium-sized hotel provides a peaceful atmosphere. Rooms are spacious very clean  and well equiped. We were welcomed with a plate of fresh fruits and a minibar of soft drinks. Fruits and drinks were refilled regularly during our stay.. The staff is very helpful, polite and attentive to your desire and comfort as well as discreet. The Chinese and Western breakfast buffet is varied and abundant. The Chinese restaurant provides a broad menu of tasty Chinese dishes.  There are also some Western classical dishes (we didn't try). The long infinity pool with a beautiful view on the sea is magnificent and very pleasant. The beach is far from being overcrowded, you are nearly alone when walking. We stayed 8 nights and we have globally been very satisfied of our stay in Narada hotel. For those looking to spend holidays in a quiet place and in a small-medium scale hotel, here is the place to be.  We would definitely recommend it and would certainly come back.

The overall architecture of the place is elegant and grand, both in its building and in its park.
The service is discreet and attentive. They are here when you need them. It is recommended to speak Mandarin.
The hotel restaurant was a nice surprise - especially for me who usually does not like hotel food.
They may not exactly fit in the expected criteria of an international luxury hotel and we recommend any international guest to look beyond those Western standards and appreciate how unique this place is.
We had a fantastic time. Highly recommended.

Not enough accommodation!
Ha ha
Really, you can tell just by looking at the picture!
Turning off the highway, what came into view were rows of greenhouses, and I was immediately filled with doubts. But as soon as I walked into the hotel lobby, I knew this was the right way to start a vacation‚õ±Ô∏è!
The lobby is connected to the Internet celebrity swimming pool. We also watched a coconut picking performance in the swimming pool on the third day, haha
The hotel is a seamless transition between mountains and sea. Every green spot, combined with the glass sea intertwined with blue and emerald green, is simply awesome! We didn‚Äôt even go to Boundary Island in our plan. We were facing Boundary Island directly on the hotel‚Äôs beach loungers and there was no need to go there. Of course, the disadvantage is that there are no water rides here, which is a small pity.
There are rabbits on the grassüê∞. I saw two of them, they were very cute, especially the one in the morning.
The hotel room is amazing! Thanks to the handsome guy Li Xiuchuan in the front office, he also helped to upgrade the room type, which made the experience great. The handsome guy also helped us book kayaks in the swimming pool, and we had fun for a long time.
The hotel's breakfast is really good, especially the sour noodles. I highly recommend trying it!
To be honest, I was very reluctant to leave the store. The weather in Hainan was just right at this time, and I thought about going back to Beijing to eat the wind and sand. Alas.
I'm already planning my next stay. Let's see what type of villa we can book. We look forward to surprises!
Welcome necklace: very beautiful

Lingshui itself is very small, which is very different from the visual sense of everyone on May Day. There is basically no one on Junlan's private beach, and it feels like a private beach. The hotel itself is very beautiful, full of green. Although there are many trees, there are not many mosquitoes. The disinfection is very in place. The waiter's attitude is very good. We added Xiaosun WeChat on the first day of our stay. In the next few days, Xiaosun responded to our needs. It was a very good experience, especially on the day of check-out. Because of the flight delay, we checked out at more than three o'clock in the afternoon. The hotel was also considerate and did not rush us. The overall feeling was very good. I recommend staying here~

They also helped send me to the airport. The only regret is that I can't go to the sea. In short, it is more suitable for families and quiet people. For those who like to walk around, forget it, you can't even order milk tea next to it.

Each room is an independent villa with a private swimming pool and a private hot spring bath, which is very private... There are also free iPads, Bluetooth speakers, and fruits... The housekeeper also specially upgraded me to a unique suite, with first-class space, facilities, and environment! It is close to the sea and the sea view is also first-class! I will stay at Junlan if I have the chance to come to Hainan in the future! Finally, I was given coffee when I left~ It was really thoughtful!

The whole hotel seems to be in the rainforest. The air is very good, very quiet and beautiful. The most important thing is that there are free Tesla charging stations, which is more convenient than Westin and Haikou Ritz-Carlton.

msg:A very suitable hotel for vacation. There is a private beach inside the hotel. It is relatively clean, but the waves are too big and not suitable for going to the sea. You can sunbathe on the beach and enjoy the sea breeze. There is a public infinity pool facing the coast, which is suitable for taking photos and checking in. The hotel organizes different activities every day, which is suitable for bringing children to participate. This time, I didn't experience the entertainment facilities due to time constraints, so it's not a good review. The buffet breakfast is really good, with many categories and timely replenishment. Lunch and dinner are basically normal prices. If there is no special forces attraction demand, you can be lazy in the hotel.
This time I stayed in Youlanju, and a mini bar and fruit plate were given as soon as I entered the house. There was a puppy made of bath towels on the bed, which was stupid and cute. The villa has its own small swimming pool and soaking pool. The surrounding greenery is very good, so there are more mosquitoes. Be careful to prevent bites. The only drawback is that the hotel has been built for a long time and the room facilities are relatively old. I hope it can be optimized in the future.

There are a lot of bugs outdoors, and the bathtub and swimming pool are full of bugs.
There is no beach.
You don't need to buy a package, the sea tour included in the package is a rip-off.
No one told me before departure that the second floor would cost an additional 150 yuan per person.
The sea tour is just a solicitation, and you have to pay extra for all the projects.
It's a waste of time!

msg:Very amazing hotel. Very cost-effective for off-season travel. The front desk was very nice to upgrade to a room with pavilion and hot spring when checking in.
The hotel is a full villa series. The vegetation is very lush, which means that the ecology is very good and there are many mosquitoes. My husband was woken up by mosquitoes in the middle of the night.
The hotel service is very good. I don‚Äôt know if my son is allergic to pollen or mosquitoes. His face is very swollen. I specially asked the doctor in the infirmary to help. Not only did he send anti-itching oin**ent, but he also asked the restaurant to send boiled mung bean soup to the room.
We saw a beautiful sunset on the first day of our stay. Later, the weather was not good and it was cloudy.
The hotel has a private beach with a large area. Due to the low number of people in the off-season and the big waves, the sea feels scary, and it is not as blue as Yalong Bay. Maybe it is also related to the weather.

Facilities: The toilet is very poor, and it is blocked in various ways. The door is not easy to close. However, the hotel provides children's sand play tools. There are two rooms, and the room with a double bed is very small and very poor.
Breakfast: It's okay, and some content will be changed. There are drinks in the mini bar, which is rich and not bad.
Check-out: It cannot be delayed for a while, and it must be checked out at 12 o'clock.
In short, I will not consider coming again in the future. I have come to Sanya four times, and this is the first hotel that I stepped on. I don't know how the high score of 4.8 came.

There were many mosquitoes and the service was not up to the name of the top luxury hotel. I couldn't stay there, so I randomly booked the Perfume Bay Junlan. I heard about it from a hotel control friend many years ago. I didn't have any hope. It is indeed an old hotel for more than ten years. I didn't expect it to be really surprising everywhere. Xiao Min at the front desk was warm and thoughtful but not excessive, and responded everywhere. The Chinese restaurant tastes good, and the Zaobo vinegar hot pot is delicious. There are not many types of breakfast, but there are Chinese and Western styles, Hainan characteristics, and the pancakes and rice noodles are delicious. I like the hotel's swimming pool very much. The scenery is good and it is big enough. I am a person who attracts mosquitoes. I didn't use mosquito repellent for four days and I was not bitten at all. The room is large, the depth and size of the swimming pool are also good, the only drawback is that there is no bathtub, only an outdoor soaking pool. It is considered to be an old hotel that is well maintained. I hope that there will be more activities in the hotel in the future. Next time I will go directly to Perfume Bay Junlan in Hainan, the cost performance is super high.

All the villas are located in lush tropical gardens, with super large swimming pools and hot springs. The beds are very large and comfortable. It really doesn't look like a hotel that has been around for more than ten years. The facilities are well maintained, and the private beach is very quiet and beautiful~
The breakfast was different for two days. The meals were exquisite and delicious. It felt great to eat while looking at the sea. There were also island delicacies in the small car at the door of the restaurant. The pancakes were super fragrant~
The service was very good, and they spoke softly and patiently. Compared with the first five-star hotel in Yalong Bay many years ago, the service has made a qualitative leap~
The entire hotel is a single-family villa. You can only see many people at breakfast. It is recommended to friends who like a quiet vacation~
Junlan is really the most unexpected hotel in the past few days. I will come again next time~

The package we originally booked was the Youlanju Pool Villa (170 square meters), and we were directly upgraded to the Bilanju Pool Villa (200 square meters). The room was 30 square meters larger. I was really happy. The housekeeper would also ask about our well-being and be very responsible. The environment here is very good, with its own beach and excellent greenery, just like a small forest. In addition, Junlan has a free shuttle bus, which directly sent us to Lingshui Station on the last day, which is very convenient. Junlan has hotel activities every day, such as making mung bean cakes, kayaking experience, etc. The hotel uses a small car similar to a sightseeing car for service. If necessary, you can call the front desk. On the last day, I called once to move my luggage to the front desk to check out, but the car came very slowly and pulled it to the front desk by itself. I hope this can be improved. In addition, the Filipino resident singer in the hotel bar is great. Sitting by the pool at night and ordering a cocktail (I ordered a Singapore Sling for 58 yuan, and the cup capacity is quite large, üòÑ), it feels great, hahahaha. I will continue to choose Junlan when I come to Lingshui next time!

By the way, the hotel breakfast is also very good and the environment is very good. The swimming pool in the hotel lobby is beautiful with water and sky. I just say that the type of pool villa will be quieter. It depends on whether you like privacy and quiet or a more lively style. Personally, I still like it. I think it's very good, especially the private swimming pool. I think the experience is relatively clean. However, there are many green plants outside, so be careful to prevent mosquitoes. The beach at the hotel is also great. Although it is not very fine sand, it is relatively clean and soft to step on. The hotel also gave me chocolates when I left, which was generally quite good!

Objectively speaking, Xiangshui Bay Narada Resort Hotel is the one with the best experience: 1. The lobby and public areas The landscape is very beautiful and has a sense of design. The beach is clean and quiet, very suitable for vacation and relaxation; 2. The rooms are all single-family villas with lush tropical greenery. The interior decoration style and exterior landscape are all Southeast Asian style, and the scent of incense is very good Zen-like, it is easy for people to relax; 3. The service and security awareness are very good. The butler Xiao Wang added WeChat in advance and asked if he needed pick-up or drop-off. The response speed of the room was also very fast. When walking in the hotel, all the staff will be polite Say hello with a smile.
Frankly speaking, before booking, I saw many reviews saying that the hotel was aging, and I was actually quite worried. After actually checking in, I felt that there would indeed be some normal signs of aging, such as water stains on the outer wall of the swimming pool and scratches on the woodwork, but I I think these are very normal and reasonable signs of use, and the guest room is very clean in terms of hygiene. The only drawback is that the clothes hanger clips are broken. It is recommended that the room staff check and replace them. Finally, thank you again to Butler Wang! Next time I come to Lingshui, I will choose Junlan!

The breakfast is very good, it changes a little every day, the Banlan Bojie is delicious, the juice is also delicious, the coffee is not good and a bit sour. A breakfast can last until 34:00 in the afternoon. Afternoon tea looks good but tastes average. I had dinner twice, and the hygiene of the tableware was worrisome. The first time I ate, I heard the next table say that the spoon was not cleaned and had rice grains stuck on it. The next day, I encountered it myself, and it was really disappointing that there were hard and dried rice grains stuck to it. There was almost no seafood, the food was served very slowly, the shrimp balls were average, and the gnocchi were delicious. If you want to eat seafood, you still have to go to the restaurant next to the hotel, which means you have to go through a garbage dump. The smell is stinky, so if you choose to eat at the hotel for the next two days, you will be charged a 15% service charge.

Disadvantages: The weather is bad and the swimming pool has become a complete decoration. It feels very worthless without a swimming pool. The rooms are relatively old. The big room is okay, but the small room is really too small and smells musty. I especially want to complain that the door is very difficult to lock. The hardware can really be upgraded! As for the butler service, it does not exist. There was no butler throughout the whole process, and no one introduced the service. I relied on the phone to consult whatever I thought of. I asked repeatedly about a problem about the pool switch before it was solved. The children's playground is relatively simple and only suitable for smaller children. The price during the Spring Festival is so high but it‚Äôs really not worth it to enjoy only such a small amount of service. I advise everyone to go during the off-season when the temperature is high.
p.s. The cleaning lady was pretty good, she taught us how to lock the door and open the pool, and her service was enthusiastic.

Environment: The vegetation coverage is large, there are many types of plants, and everything is lush and green. The infinity heated swimming pool is the busiest place every day. It was windy and the waves were strong during the days we stayed, so we were not allowed to go into the sea. We could only dig sand at the private beach. Step on the sea water

Our whole family is very happy after staying here these days. We all say that we will stay at the Narada Hotel next time we come to Lingshui.

The overall environment of the villa is okay. The hardware facilities are only superficially similar to those of swimming pool villas in Southeast Asia. For example, at first glance, it looks like the W in Koh Samui where I live, but the swimming pool in W is constant temperature and very warm. The swimming pool in the room here is not The temperature is constant. Sanya is very cold and windy in winter, so the indoor swimming pool has become a decoration. Children cannot get in the water and have to go all the way to the public constant temperature swimming pool next to the lobby. I will not consider coming here in winter in the future. , but there is also a hot spring pool in the room that acts like a bathtub. This design is a plus. The water is very hot and you can adjust the temperature by yourself. After soaking twice, it instantly cured my cold. However, it is not for those with mysophobia, because Next to the outdoor swimming pool, there is a lot of floating dust such as leaves and insects, and it feels like it has not been cleaned.

The overall service is pretty good. The housekeeper I met, Xiao Li, is very nice. Anyone who can help with the application is welcome.

What's not very happy is that my friend and I both booked from Ctrip. She had afternoon tea for me but not me. I'm really unhappy. She booked it earlier and it was much cheaper than me.
The beach next to the hotel has big waves and you can't go into the water.

I only plugged in the electric mosquito repellent liquid and had a good sleep all night ~ In addition, my mother and I have very high requirements for air, so we still opened the door by the swimming pool at night, and there were no mosquitoes invading, so it was very comfortable. The villa has a beautiful environment, with waves and beaches that make people forget to leave. I won‚Äôt go into details here. What‚Äôs particularly worth mentioning is that the hotel‚Äôs services are soothing. Every detail embodies warmth and care, and it also has the right sense of proportion and boundary.

In addition, the hotel's breakfast is of good quality; the lunch provided is also good, and the prawns with sea****, floss, and meat are sweet and delicious. Unfortunately, due to the nuclear sewage problem, we don't dare to eat more seafood. I think these lovely people in Hainan are so pitiful and Japan is so bad! !

I originally planned to stay in the hotel with my children for five days, do some work, and help the children with their classes. After arriving at the hotel, I found that there are many activities arranged for children every day. The 7-year-old child basically has nothing to do except eating during the day. In the gardens, camping bases, and beaches outside the hotel, you can lie down or sit in a daze for a long time, and you can also buy coffee or juice. In terms of food, you can have a meal, Chinese food, barbecue, or even make tea by the fire. You can eat to your heart's content without leaving the hotel in these days.
The boys, girls, and cleaning aunties in the hotel are all very friendly. Every time they meet, they say hello with a smile and ask if they need help. It deeply made our family of three feel "at home".
Although the trip was short, it left us with very good memories. We are grateful to every staff member we met at Junlan‚ù§Ô∏èSee you next year‚úåüèª

The front desk guy who received us, Huang Xiandeng, served us very enthusiastically and attentively. Due to the upgrade of our room, it had not been cleaned yet. Well, we took the children to the hotel first. Xiao Huang learned that the children needed sand digging tools, and immediately enthusiastically placed the sand digging tools at the door of our room. In the evening, the child wanted to catch sand crabs. Since there was no flashlight, Liang Ying and Huang Min at the front desk enthusiastically borrowed flashlights and water bottles. The beach was relatively empty at night, and the child was a little scared and did not dare to catch sand crabs. After Liang Ying at the front desk learned about it, I immediately came to accompany the baby to catch sand crabs, and finally caught two. The baby smiled happily. There are many activities in their hotel, including little chefs, glue crafts, magic balloons, kayak rafting, etc. The two staff there, Huang Jiaxian and Chen Youyan, are very patient and meticulous in teaching the children how to do it. , under the guidance of the two young ladies, the finished product made by the children was very good. The hotel has a very beautiful environment. The villas are located along the boulevards. The room design is very grand. There is not only a family swimming pool in the patio, but also a small bathing and surfing pool. It is an ideal resort hotel. All staff services are very good. , we were deeply impressed by their consideration for their guests. It is a beautiful resort hotel worth recommending and staying at.

msg:I have been to Hainan several times. Before, I went to Sanya. This time I changed to Lingshui. The sea in Xiangshui Bay is very beautiful. The hotel has an exclusive beach. It is quiet and relaxing with few people. The hotels are all villas, and there are not many people overall. The service is very good. If you need anything, you can talk to the housekeeper or the front desk. We went to Boundary Island to play, and housekeeper Huang Ying also helped arrange a car pick-up. It was very convenient. The driver, Master Fu, was also very helpful. major.
The hotel has daily activities, but we basically played in the swimming pool. The children were so happy. I was very happy to have breakfast until 11 o'clock, so I could sleep in peacefully. I'll stay again next time if I have the chance.

msg:This time I came to Lingshui and stayed at Junlan for 12 days. All the rooms are single-family villas, and the intervals are relatively wide. They have their own large swimming pool, and the privacy is very good.
The public infinity pool in the hotel is very beautiful and can be seen directly from the lobby. There are very few people on the beach. There is a dedicated service person at the pool and towels will be provided.
The room is very clean, but there are still many mosquitoes due to environmental factors. The hotel provides mosquito coils. The swimming pool in the room will be cleaned every day to ensure it is clean.
The western restaurant was under renovation when I checked in. All meals were in the Chinese restaurant. The environment was not bad and the Chinese food tasted good. I recommend the coconut chicken hotpot set meal. You can't buy such good chicken outside. I don't recommend other hotpots, as they are not as good as coconut chicken. The Western steaks and pasta are good, don't order pizza, it's just the same breakfast pizza. The breakfast is okay and filling. The Xiaodao food truck has freshly made food every day which is very good.
The restaurants around the hotel are not recommended. It is recommended to go to Yingzhou or Lingshui County for dining. If it is too far, you can also order food at the hotel.
Overall, I felt good after staying there for more than 10 days. I will choose Junlan next time I travel.

msg:Bring the kids on vacation before the holidays are over. It was the right choice to choose Narada for the first time in Perfume Bay. First of all, the staff are very nice. The butler, Xiao Sun, is very attentive and enthusiastic, with a particularly good service attitude, and solves various problems in a timely manner. The room is also very spacious, and the swimming pool in the villa is slightly smaller, but it does not affect the children's mood of playing. The whole Narada is very big, you will get lost. It has its own beach, few people are very clean, and there is fresh water on the shore to wash your feet. Strolling around in the yard is like being in a tropical rainforest. Fortunately, there are battery cars to pick you up at any time. The hotel will also organize some activities for children. The girls in the children's center are also very interesting, taking the children to legally pick flowers and cut grass in the yard to make plant printing and painting. Check in on Saturday, for the night crab catching activity on the beach. Brother Shanhao, the team leader, is very caring. He insisted on putting crabs in each child‚Äôs bucket. When it was finally over, he still thought that there was still one child in the bucket that was still empty. The child kept digging sand pits with a big shovel all night for crabs, and his clothes were soaked from exhaustion. In the end, the crabs have to be released in a unified way, which is very loving. The hotel's infinity pool is not big, but the sea view is invincible. You can take a taxi to Boundary Island within 20 yuan, which is very convenient. The one on the Twelve Sea is Boundary Island. What's more convenient is that the takeaway can help to pick it up at the gate of the yard and deliver it to the room, so that we are too lazy to leave the house with children, and even eat three takeaway meals, the taste and price are very good. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are not many varieties of breakfast, but they took care of us and didn't charge extra for the children. The furniture in the room is a bit old, but it's not a big problem. The airport pick-up shuttle bus has a fixed departure time, which is also considered convenient. We caught it by coincidence, so we went directly to our family, and the airport went directly to the hotel, about an hour and a half. The driver's attitude is good. Maybe because it is a minibus, it will appear to be a bit aggressive when you drive faster. It is recommended to add a fixed process to remind all passengers to wear seat belts after getting on the bus. Minibuses must also wear seat belts, after all, the whole journey is high-speed. In general, Narada's experience in Perfume Bay is very good, and I will come again if I have the opportunity.

msg:The most satisfactory hotel in this trip, as expected.
üëâEnvironment: Perfume Bay is just down from the expressway. The villas are hidden in the dense vegetation. The hotel lobby faces the infinity pool and the sea directly, with a wide view and beautiful scenery. The hotel has its own private beach. Although the sand is not soft enough, the color of the sea is extremely beautiful.
üëâFacilities:
#Ê±†Ê±†# There is an infinity pool facing the sea and a small pool by the sea. It is reassuring to see the staff cleaning it up. It is open from 8:00 to 10:00 pm every day, and it feels a bit early to close at night.
#gym# I didn't go to experience it, it's on the first floor.
#È§êÂéÖ#Western restaurants, Chinese restaurants, and bars are all available, and the bar is the latest to open, like 11 o'clock in the evening. You can buy the hotel's package, eat on the sea-viewing platform, and there are singers singing, the a**osphere is very good.
#OTHER# There are battery cars available for pick-up and drop-off, basically on call; the hotel also has some activities every day, but it needs to be booked in advance. This time we went to experience the sea project, and it was too late to enjoy it. The breakfast is rich, but the smell of oily smoke is a bit big.
üëâRoom: The room is large and the hygiene is good. The moment you enter the door, it is fragrant and feels very good. The toiletries are from L'Occitane. There are soft drinks and welcome fruit. As for the disadvantage, the bed is a bit small, which is a bit embarrassing for a family of three, especially a family of teenagers. Also, the toilet is a bit old, it will be perfect if it is replaced with a smart toilet üòÉ
üëâService: It can be said that all the waiters are warm and courteous. They greeted us proactively on the road. Xiao Li, who received us, added WeChat and cared for us all the way.
Coming here is the right way to open a vacation,

msg:Because I have been to Thailand and Bali many times, I booked this hotel when I saw that it felt like a foreign holiday villa, but after the experience, it was really not very good.
The advantage is the infinity pool, the view and scenery are very good, not inferior to foreign countries, the beach is relatively quiet, there are few people, although the waves are relatively large.
There are too many shortcomings, the room facilities are old, there is no service concept at all, the breakfast is crowded, etc.
1. When you check in, there is no welcome link, no water and towels are provided, and there are question marks all over your face. This is a must. Then when checking in, the front desk didn't say a word, and the whole process was silent until it was finished. Didn't tell you the breakfast location, time, how to use the battery car, room location, hotel facilities...not at all, I only answered mechanically after asking one by one, which is really weird.
2. After checking in to the room, the little brother found that there was no welcome fruit, and said that he would send it immediately. Then after we had a short rest, we found that a recliner was missing, so we called someone to ask, and we were told that it was sent for repair? ? I told him that I hope to send it back as soon as possible, and at the same time asked him why there is no welcome fruit yet, and told me right away. Afterwards, I went out to play, until I returned to the room at 8:00 p.m., and there was still no welcome fruit... You don‚Äôt have to give it to me, but since you said yes, it‚Äôs been so long, why? After calling to inquire again, the waiter seemed confused and didn't know why he didn't deliver it, and it was delivered after eight o'clock. It's really a late welcome.
3. Let‚Äôs talk about the reclining chair. After asking and urging many times, it was delivered at noon the next day.
4. There was a queue for breakfast. After nine o‚Äôclock, the entrance of the restaurant was crowded with people. The reception lady was obviously confused. Many people asked why this happened. Several families were obviously irritable and about to lose their temper. Several people are talking about how this fits the positioning of your hotel. You have to wait in line until after 10 o'clock to get in, and the meal closes at 10:30, so how can you eat. It wasn't until everyone became more and more angry that a male staff member came and began to speed up people's entry by sharing tables and other methods to calm everyone's anger. I have never seen a five-star hotel with such chaotic management.
5. As for turning down the bed, this should always be the most necessary service item in resort hotels. On the first day, we went back to the room at about 8:00 and found that it was not turned on. We called and asked, saying that it might not be our turn yet? ? ? When will it be your turn? But we didn't care about it. We went back to the room at almost nine o'clock the next day, and it hadn't opened yet. Now I was in a hurry, and I went to ask the front desk, and the front desk said to help me. As a result, it took ten minutes before someone called and asked me why I hadn't turned it on, hadn't it been turned on for two days? Could it be that I opened it for myself? In the end, I didn't give me an explanation. I didn't have this service during the two days I stayed, and the result was very tragic. The next afternoon, I packed up my food and put it outside. I hoped that the garbage would be collected when the turndown was opened, but it was not opened. When I woke up the next morning, I found that the yard was full of garbage knocked by mice. It was really too disgusting. Until now, no one has informed the reason and apologized for not turning the bed down for two days.
If the above is just an ordinary five-star hotel, I don't care at all, but you are a resort hotel. A resort hotel means that I spend all day in the hotel, and the service is the most basic. How can you deserve such a service? on your facilities and publicity. In the longer term, how does the hotel develop? As a review expert, I take responsibility for my every word. From check-in to check-out, the service awareness and performance shown by your hotel is too disappointing.

There is an infinity pool outside the hotel lobby connected to the beach. The private beach is less crowded and beautiful, and you can see it Boundary Island.
The hotel butler Xiaomin's service is very good, the concierge service is superb and on call. The child had a fever on the second day of staying in the hotel, and the room sent a thermometer. The hotel has many parent-child activities, but unfortunately the child was sick and did not participate.

There are not many things to eat around, but the Taoyuan restaurant inside the hotel has relatively moderate prices and dishes. The taste is also good.
Service: This must be amazing. I have stayed here many times, and I am very satisfied with the service attitude every time, whether it is the front desk or the room and restaurant service staff.
Facilities: Each room has its own swimming pool, but Jinglanju or Pinlanju is still recommended. The living room is large, with a swimming pool in the front yard and a soaking pool in the backyard. The backyard is also relatively private.
Transportation: The hotel has a free shuttle bus to the airport, just check the schedule and make an appoin**ent in advance.

The Tianlan Residence where I live is very comfortable. The hotel has been more than ten years old, and the room does not have any peculiar smell.
The service of the hotel is still very good. The pick-up and drop-off in the hotel responds very quickly. If there are any items that need to be added, they will be delivered quickly. You can also help to pick up the takeaway, haha
There is a seafood restaurant near the hotel is also good
The breakfast is average, the restaurant is a bit hot, the bar and the lobby are open, drinking a little wine is really sweaty
The hotel pick-up service is used back and forth. It takes about an hour to get to the airport. This is the farthest hotel trip to Hainan from Sanya. I am very satisfied

msg:Narada Resort & Spa Perfume Bay, the second hotel of this trip to Hainan. The whole villa, with a swimming pool, is amazing! The hotel has been in business for some years, and some equipment is old. But the advantage is that there are not many people and it is very private! It is highly recommended for children who like to play with water, and it is not idle to stay in it for a day. The housekeeper Deren is very attentive and can help us solve any problems we have. He can also arrange the set meals ordered on Ctrip, which is amazing! The price-performance ratio is super high, and I will go again next time I have a chance!

msg:It can only be said that there is no harm without comparison. I spent the first three nights at Raffles in Clear Water Bay (just comparing the two hotels I stayed in this time, nothing else). From the time of check-in at Narada, there is no place to make people feel comfortable. Said our room hadn't been cleaned up yet, it would take a while. This time, I waited for nearly 3 hours in the hotel lobby without air conditioning under the high temperature of more than 30 degrees at noon before I got to the room. Normally, you can check in at 3 o'clock. I arrived early and I can bear it, but can you arrange a cooler place for people to stay? After I couldn't bear to ask three times when I could check in, I arranged an air-conditioned place like an office to stay for a while, and the air-conditioning effect was not very good. Finally, around 14:50, I got on the electric car to the room.
Speaking of the room, it is undeniable that the detached house is indeed larger than the single room. There are three small yards on the front, back and side, with swimming pools, soaking pools and couch chairs respectively. It may be more suitable for those who are socially phobic and willing to stay in the room, but the light is a bit dark at night, which is a bit scary. More private space, less public space.
Looking at the beach, although the hotel has a private beach with few people and very quiet, it seems that it is too lazy to maintain it. The sand is thicker than the public beach in Clear Water Bay.
The package comes with three coupons: Water afternoon tea, Narada special drink, and Tomahawk steak set. I had afternoon tea that afternoon. Except for fresh French fries online, I didn't really want to comment on the others, and I found out that there was a piece of fruit missing the next day. The Narada special drink can only be used at the bar. I don‚Äôt remember whether it‚Äôs good or not. I just remember that we wanted to finish drinking and go back to the room. It‚Äôs too hot without air conditioning... Half of the tomahawk steak was eaten, and the waiter kindly offered to help heat it up. The not-so-high wine was ignited with a lighter for about two seconds, but it was not heated, but the steak was completely full of wine...I don‚Äôt have much to say about the others because I didn‚Äôt report high expectations.
The last two highlights may be the seaside view from the lobby and the infinity pool, both of which are beautiful.
The breakfast and restaurant waiters are really not worthy of the room fee. The service awareness is not as good as the cleaning lady who came out of the restaurant. I will not go again, and I even want to avoid all the Narada...

The sand on the beach is very fine and there are not many people. There were no people at 5.6 o'clock, so it was free to dig sand. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is good, there are many kinds of juices, and there are local specialties in rotation every day. The waiters are very enthusiastic, and the shuttle bus is basically timely. I ate two meals at the Chinese restaurant in the evening, the taste was not bad, and the price was acceptable. The only downside is that the hardware of the hotel is still a bit old, and the toilet can be upgraded

There are relatively few people in the hotel, and the service is very good. The whole family can order hot pot and eat it in the yard when traveling together. It is very comfortable. It is very convenient for someone to take it away after eating. Among all the hotels in Sanya, this is the only hotel that helps us deliver food to our door, like it.
The hotel's infinity pool is accompanied by the accompaniment of the bar at night, the a**osphere is full, and the free time after the baby sleeps is very good.
I would like to praise the children's playground here. The little girls are very loving and patient. They care about every child. Later, the baby in the family went to live in another hotel. I guess they never forget the girls here. Play with plasticine with her, make mung bean cakes together, and play with building blocks together.

I have a good impression from the moment I entered the hotel yard. The security guard will ask if I have already checked in. If I have not checked in, I need to register. If I have already checked in, I need to show the key card. The security guard will also salute when entering and leaving the hotel. I can feel the quality of the hotel~ The hotel is not good Miscellaneous people are allowed to enter, so it looks very quiet. When we checked in, we gave each of us a welcome necklace, made of coconut shell and mother-of-pearl, and the hotel's logo, which is very beautiful and unique~ After check-in, there is The little brother helped us move our luggage to the shuttle bus and then sent us back to our room, and then helped us move our luggage to the door of the room. There was no need to do anything during the whole process. Although the hotel is a few years old, it is well maintained and the sanitation is also very clean. The water in the private pool is also very clear, and there are welcome fruits in both rooms. The lovely room aunt also folded a bath towel baby elephant and a face towel bunny on each bed~ The toiletries are still from L‚ÄôOccitane, and the ones in the minibar Drinks are free, capsule coffee machine and tea set are all available, wine glasses, tea cups, coffee cups, ice buckets are all complete, there are iPods and iPads by the bedside, curtains are electric, it is a very qualified five-star hotel (hanging Call a certain Laideng), the hotel staff are also well-trained, no matter where you go, you will smile and say hello, and you will be very enthusiastic and patient when you ask questions. When I had breakfast the next day, it was past 10:30 So there is no coconut milk. I want to drink refreshing and refreshing, so I asked the waiter if there is any coconut milk. She searched everywhere and finally found a cup for me. I like it upup
And the hotel's infinity pool is super good, but it's a pity that I didn't bring a telephoto lens. I took a lot of nice photos with my friends at the hotel. The sea behind the hotel is super blue. The beach is the hotel's private beach, so there are no outside tourists, especially Good movie~ I really love it
If there is a chance, I will come back again for vacation~

I became attached to the hotel 10 years ago. I like the beautiful scenery and quiet vacation environment here. I come here almost every year with my family and friends. The most I live in is the sea view villa (the first row near the sea). I have also lived in two-bedroom and other room types.
The reason for the mask is that I haven‚Äôt seen her in three years. This is my mother‚Äôs 70th birthday. I accompanied the two elderly people to Sanya. The first choice is Narada Perfume Bay. I stayed at Tianlan Residence
To be honest, we can see the traces of time in the hardware, but we can feel the hotel's attentive service everywhere. The room service learned that there are elderly people who are staying, carefully put non-slip floor mats on each passageway, and carefully arranged balloons and presented cakes for dinner ( Two days earlier than my birthday) The old man recommended by the travel photographer is also very satisfied
The Ritz-Carlton is also in the villa area. Compared with Narada in Perfume Bay, if you want to have the sea alone, you can come here to experience it.
Thank you everyone at Narada for serving us Thank you everyone We will meet again soon

The service staff are very polite, and they will greet the guests when they meet on the road, and there is also a battery car pick-up service. The meals provided by the hotel are quite OK, so there is no need to go out for food. PS, the bay of this hotel faces east, so you can't take pictures of the sunset, but get up early to take pictures of the sunrise on the beach, which is just as beautiful!

Facilities: The hotel facilities are a little outdated
Because it is close to the seaside, the room smells very strong
I booked a two-bedroom room with one large room and one small room. As expected, one room is very large, and the other room is very small... In sharp contrast, the bed in the small bedroom is only 1.5 inches wide. If two adults will be crowded, there is another room type. A bit surprised there is no bathtub...
It is worth mentioning that the toiletries are all L‚ÄôOccitane, very easy to use!

msg:Maybe it's because I have lived in the Banyan Tree in Phuket, so there is a big gap between Narada and what I expected. I didn‚Äôt look carefully at the photos of the booked parent-child play villa. I thought the two rooms were about the same. In fact, I felt that one room was in the sky, the other room was on the ground. I feel uncomfortable. I don't quite understand the design concept of this house. It should be a family living in this type of house. If the luxury room is regarded as having the function of family gatherings, then there should be a sofa for four people. If it is purely for living Function, then why should it be designed as two rooms with such a big gap. When you bring children, you will first choose a house with a parent-child theme, so you focus on parent-child, and ignore the small room that is a bed as soon as you enter the door.
The breakfast in the hotel is really not flattering. The breakfast for more than 300 people, what to eat, a bunch of colorful cold drinks, some tasteless and rotten vegetables, which kind of ingredients are worth it, are still all service charges . After eating for two days in a row, I stopped paying for breakfast on the third day. Especially on the day of Lantern Festival, the hotel did not have Lantern Festival and glutinous rice balls. This is really unexpected. The hotel did not show any indication of traditional Chinese festivals. Afterwards we went to other hotels, and the person in charge of the food and beverage depar**ent of the hotel personally delivered glutinous rice balls to us. Even though it was over fifteen, the comparison was too great.
But Narada Hotel is commendable that the room service is still available, and the clothes hangers and flashlights we need are all provided to us.
The swimming pool of the villa is also very good, very big, and the water quality is very clean!

I called at 3 o‚Äôclock and said it was ok, but I couldn‚Äôt find the key. I waited for a battery car at the door for a long time, saying that the room card was taken away by other colleagues and given to others, haha, how can it be so messy. Another 15-20 minutes of delay. When we arrived at the new room, we were still checking the sanitation.
I originally wanted to give some points to the brother of the battery car. He has a good attitude, but he is not professional. He told me that he can send up to 4 bottles of mineral water a day. I:? Who came to your hotel to steal a few bottles of Nongfu Spring?

Besides the facilities, the constant temperature swimming pool is not constant temperature at all, as shown in the picture below, I said why no one swims in the distance, and I realized that the water there is cold when I went down, I asked the waiter next to it and said it was like this!

The facilities and equipment are too old and not updated at all. The garden environment of the room and the green environment outside are shown in the picture below.

In short, this is a pit, it seems to imitate Bali, but regardless of the environmental facilities or service, I really can't give a high score!

msg:Lingshui Narada is really beautiful

Because of the mask, I haven‚Äôt been abroad in the past few years, so the only vacation option is Sanya. I have been to Haitang Bay, Wanning, Lingshui, Dadonghai, and lived in Edison, Westin, Le Meridien, Park Hyatt, Autograph.. I like the cultural heritage of Park Hyatt and the rooftop swimming pool of Greentown Blue Bay suites the most, but because they are all in popular bays, it is difficult to feel a quiet vacation

This time, I chose Narada in Lingshui Perfume Bay for the New Year‚Äôs holiday. I was completely surprised, it‚Äôs so beautiful! There are no tall buildings, but a villa-style hotel surrounded by lush greenery. Each room has its own private hot spring pool and swimming pool. The weather these days is just right, with a slight breeze blowing

üè†Service: The hotel provides pick-up and drop-off service, but the daily time is fixed, you need to call the front desk one day in advance to confirm the pick-up time. All the service staff are providing warm help during the stay

Because the villas in the park have a large space adjacent to each other, you can call the front desk in advance when you go out to play or have a meal, and the car will arrive at the door soon. The more touching thing is that when we came back from having breakfast, the auntie cleaned up and cleaned the swimming pool in the room. Because I have a habit of incense, I will put a few extra sticks for me, and the details are taken care of!

üçΩÔ∏èMeals: The hotel's breakfast is delicious, muffins, donuts, egg tarts, a variety of delicious juices, and rice noodles with plenty of glutinous rice flour! If you don‚Äôt have dinner in the hotel, you will go out to eat. There are several authentic small restaurants nearby~delicious and cheap! (Recommend Three Aunts, Hailan Seafood, Yellow Kitchen Dregs Vinegar)

üåäFun: The hotel has different activity experiences every day, such as paddle boarding, coffee making, kite flying and so on. You can take part in it when you are bored! The infinity pool is heated, so it feels comfortable to swim even in bad weather. The sand on the private beach is very fine and there is no coastline of dumplings in the popular bay, where you can see the sunrise and sunsetüåÑ

Next to the beach, there is a campsite ‚õ∫Ô∏è that cooperates with the hotel. There are some food and beverages for sale. You can order a cup of coffee and blow the sea breeze. Don‚Äôt be too comfortable~

Take a walk back to the room after dinner late at night. If it‚Äôs not cold, take a swim in the room and soak in the soup pool, and you will feel good physically and mentally.

It is said that it is a set meal for two, but it is not a problem for four people to be full. highly recommended! Every staff member I encountered was very kind. Compared with the last time I stayed at the bedside, there was an iPad on the bedside to introduce various facilities in the hotel. It is recommended to use the APP online, so that guests can order food by themselves and obtain information on various places in the hotel with just a QR code.

From the cleaning staff to the front desk, the communication with the battery car driver and the service details, we can see that the management is very good. Because it is a hotel in an all-villa area, it is not noisy like other hotels, and there are few people on the beach. It is very suitable for vacation and rest, and will come again next time.

The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Li Xiuchuan, who responded super quickly to help me when I needed help!
I come to Sanya several times a year, and I used to go to Haitang Bay or Yalong Bay. This is the first time I have come to Lingshui. The hotel staff said that the temperature here is a few degrees lower than Haitang Bay, so it is not so hot in summer. And it's relatively quieter here, I didn't feel tired after staying for six nights, I recommend it to friends around me!

Of course, the children's favorite is the swimming pool and hot spring pool in the yard. There is nothing else they can ask for in a proper house. Narada is not the best pool villa, but it must be the best cost-effective.

I also said that it was a welcome necklace, but I didn‚Äôt give it away. I only gave it when I checked out. It's a farewell necklace.
The hotel looks like Bali. But the service is far inferior to that of Ayana in Bali. I will not stay here again. The experience is not good.

Each room type of Narada is a single-family villa, and the whole environment is very quiet, with villas interspersed among the lush trees, which feels very Japanese.

The interior of the room is also designed with a tall spire, a bit like Chiang Mai. Equipped with a private swimming pool and a hot spring pool. Very comfortable to live in.

The hotel has several swimming pools, one of which is an infinity pool. It seems that it has been standard for hotels for several years.

Overall a very good hotel for vacation.

The area is so large that you can get lost every time you go out for a walk. The privacy is superb and very quiet. It is definitely a holy place for vacation. Because there have been cloudy and rainy days recently, the mountains behind are shrouded in clouds and mist, and the sea is as beautiful as a fairyland. Living here seems to be isolated from the world. The hotel service is also very good. There is a special car from Sanya to pick up and drop off. We upgraded the room type for free. The Lingshui acid powder for breakfast is delicious. There are souvenirs when you check out. All in all, the living experience is great

msg:I generally don‚Äôt choose a hotel that is more than ten years old, unless the brand is very trustworthy. This hotel is more than ten years old and I have never stayed in it. I tried it for the first time, but I was pleasantly surprised and will choose it again. 1. The hotel facilities are well maintained and there is no sense of outdated hardware. The design is exquisite, the front hall is transparent, and you can look at the boundless sea at a glance when you enter the hall. The blue of the swimming pool and sea water is very healing. Waiting for the accounting results at Sanya Airport, I was very upset at first, because my nucleic acid was negative 30 times in the past month, and I had to ask for the results before I got off the plane. The space is transparent, the sea breeze blows comfortably, and when I look back and see the healing blue, I feel better immediately. Detached small courtyard design, beautiful garden landscape.
2. The service is very good, and every employee is well-educated online. The speech is very polite and polite, and responds to any demands of the guests in a timely manner. From entering the store to leaving, all the staff I met made people want to praise. When checking in, Alive in the front hall took the initiative to add WeChat. If you have any questions, you can ask her at any time. She provides 24-hour butler service, which is very considerate. There is a battery car to pick up and drop off at any time from the front hall to the room. If you have a problem, call the front desk and someone will come to solve it immediately.
3. The room has an independent swimming pool and a soup pool. I have experienced both. The water quality is clean and safe to use. Someone cleans it every day, and the swimming pool continues to circulate.
4. The beach is quiet and invincible, the most beautiful at noon! clean beach
5. Provide a variety of entertainment activities, including free experience of various water sports and paid teaching in the sea.
6. The spa is also very good, the masseuses are very good, and the price is cost-effective.
7. There is a nucleic acid point at the entrance of the hotel facing the street, which saves time during special periods.
8. It is very close to Boundary Island. It is very convenient for those who like water sports to live here.

It‚Äôs especially natural. Those who are afraid of small insects may be a little panicked. When you enter the door, you can see all kinds of geckos, snails, cockroaches or flying insects. Insects have been removed from the room, and incense has been lit, but insects still appear at any time. I quite enjoy this environment.

This sea is really even more beautiful than the Perfume Bay on the other side of a certain Hao. It is very clean. It is not fine sand, but a bit of large particles of sand. It has an exotic taste, and the vegetation is really like the west coast of Hawaii.

When you go to the beach or the swimming pool, you need to call the battery car in the hotel. The overall service speed is very fast, and taking the car is also part of the experience. Contact Xiao Li on WeChat responded quickly.

With the open-air 88-meter swimming pool, the private swimming pool in the villa is basically unnecessary, which is too small in comparison. The swimming pool by the beach has surfing activities and kayaking. Anyway, if you stay for 2 nights, you may not be able to play here.

The housekeeper, Runyan, was very considerate. She told me about all kinds of matters when I checked in. There are activities in the hotel every day, which is very suitable for bringing a baby to experience. I feel that I am too busy.
The highlight of the hotel is the greening, 60% of the green area, and all the rooms are villas. Because there are not many people, Runyan also helped me to upgrade and experience a better room type.
The car is on call, it is convenient to go anywhere, and it is not far from the seaside. The water here is better than that in Sanya. The waves are rough, but the water is clear and the coastline is very long, which is suitable for taking pictures. The clouds are shrouded in mist and the scenery is superb.
The swimming pool is very clean, and a few fallen leaves are inevitable. The breakfast place is not too big, but everything is basically satisfied. The swimming pool in front of the lobby feels connected to the sea at a glance, and the design is particularly good.
Everything in the house is complete, there is a pool, you can take a hot spring at any time, there are also yoga mats, weight scales, and umbrellas are equipped, and the sanitation is also timely.

I brought my parents and children to Hainan for the first time. I avoided the popular Sanya and chose to come to Lingshui, a small but beautiful county town. Unexpectedly, there is a beautiful Perfume Bay here, as well as a resort hotel with first-class environment and service.
This time, when I stayed at Narada in Perfume Bay, I enjoyed a very considerate service as soon as I entered the lobby. The staff helped us upgrade our room for free. Orders and services in the middle of the check-in also only need WeChat and the housekeeper to speak to the housekeeper and get an immediate reply.
The second is the super private and comfortable living environment, as if living in a forest park. The design of the villa has the fusion elements of Chinese style and Southeast Asia. Pushing open the door of the bedroom and living room is the private swimming pool, and there are two bathrooms connected to the two bedrooms. Hot spring pool, children wake up excited every day.
The public places of the hotel are also beautiful. The entire hotel is built between the mountains and the sea. Passing through the tropical jungle-like villa area is the lobby. The lobby extends out to a wide infinity pool and beach. Special photo shoot~
Mom and Dad are very satisfied with this stay, we have already planned to come again!

The swimming pool in the room is also very good for taking pictures, and I took a lot of pictures. There is also a pool, but I don't use it. If you are not in a hurry, you can stay for two nights next time.

msg:It has been the third consecutive summer vacation, and I have come to Hainan for vacation. This time I chose to stay at Narada Resort & Spa Lingshui Perfume Bay for six consecutive nights. When we checked in, the lovely housekeeper Meng Meng warmly received us. She carefully and patiently followed our instructions. needs, help us choose the best room and arrange it properly. In the next few days, the housekeeper Meng Meng will help us make reservations and arrange catering package services, and will introduce the hotel's various activities and entertainment for children and children in detail, and She also often understands what we need. During the stay, she provided attentive service, reflecting a very high level of professional service.
The villas of Narada Resort & Spa are very private. Another commendable feature is the design of the villa swimming pool, which integrates the surrounding plants and environmental design. Swimming in the villa does not have to worry about being exposed to the sun, and swimming in the shade is very comfortable.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the Chinese food tastes good. I‚Äôve gotten fat again during my vacation, hahaÔΩ∏ÔæûÔΩØ!(‡πë‚Ä¢ÃÄ„ÖÇ‚Ä¢ÃÅ)Ÿà‚úß
The water in Xiangshui Bay where the hotel is located is very blue. I think it is much better than Haitang Bay, where there are many first-tier high-end hotels. Narada Resort and Spa Lingshui Xiangshui Bay is worth visiting again.

I waited for a long time when I checked in, and there was often no place for breakfast. The overall service and environment are inconsistent. Now that the hardware condition is already very good, it is recommended to improve the service. I live in Banyan Tree in Sanya. Although the facilities of Banyan Tree are much older, the service beats Narada, and the price is similar. Overall, Narada is average in terms of cost performance.

There are a lot of breakfast patterns, but none of them are very delicious

Originally only booked for seven days, but finally stayed for half a month because of the epidemic.
Narada is still the same Narada, and the high-quality service as always has made us feel the warmth of home during the sudden epidemic lockdown.
Every employee here has a sincere smile on their face, and we still provide meticulous room service during the epidemic.
Manager Yang and Manager Huang of the hotel also gave our family too much meticulous care, even in the case of shortage of materials and inconvenient transportation during the closure and control. They sent a car to take us to the nucleic acid, reminded us to pay attention to safety, paid attention to our meals and needs at any time, helped us contact government agencies to understand the return policy, etc. They did a lot.
The days of sealing and controlling in Lingshui will be unforgettable for a lifetime, but we are really not alone in Narada. We sincerely thank you and we will come often in the future.

I can't forget that the seaside staff took the children to catch crabs under the stars at night, the unparalleled infinity pool under the sunset, and the courteous staff of every one. This is called real service, not a few fruits. When it comes to folding a towel, I can feel everyone's courtesy and concern for the guests, and try their best to make our stay comfortable and happy. There is also a bonfire party by the sea, which is very fun! This year, I experienced the hotel's SPA, which is also very pleasant. It is comfortable and clean, and the taste of Taoyuan Restaurant is still the same. My friend's son Pian'erchuan ate three bowls. The only small comment is that there were many children's styles for breakfast last year, and this year there are only marshmallows, which is a little regrettable. But the Hainanese chicken rice for breakfast is more than half a thumbs up I paid 188 at the Yanjiang Hotel. In addition, not far from the hotel, there is an authentic Lingshui sour powder king, which is known to everyone in the local area. People who live in the hotel can check in. Hainan's favorite hotel, Narada, will see you next year!

The details are good, in time for the Qixi Festival, when I came back after dinner, there was a rose at the door.
The room environment is good, very clean, the room will kill mosquitoes, not bitten, the swimming pool is large and clean, there is a hot spring pool in the backyard, and there are yoga mats for exercise.
The hotel's infinity pool is very beautiful, the beach is less crowded and comfortable, and there is a bonfire party in the evening.
The breakfast is quite rich, and the price of the Chinese restaurant is moderate. For dinner, you can order all kinds of hot pot and barbecue to eat in the courtyard of the room. Fee plus 300.
The only downside is the spa, the service and techniques are a little bit mean.

The chicken hot pot has been eaten before, but this time I ordered two home packages, and the grilling package is not bad. But the seafood hot pot on the second day was too low-quality, especially the ingredients, which were not fresh, and I made a reservation one day in advance. When I wanted to eat it, they would say that there was no crab, so I replaced the fish with fish, which was already there. As a result, three fish came, and they were not very fresh. As a result, they were half-cooked, and they were not delicious, nor were they eaten. Also, the snail was very tasty and not fresh. In addition, the fire of this hot pot is very small, I told them, and they said that it is impossible. In the end, the hot pot must be covered with a lid, and it will take a long time to cook. The experience is not very good, and I have a little diarrhea after eating. Other services are fine, hope to improve.

When I was about to go out to the pharmacy to buy medicines by myself, the hotel customer service looked for the hotel again. The driver helped me go to the nearby pharmacy to help me find the medicine I needed, so that I could wait in the room with peace of mind. I was moved! Next time you come to Hainan, you must stay here!

msg:The first time I came to Sanya, I decided to find a place with relatively few people due to the epidemic. After researching on Ctrip for a long time, I chose this place. The most important thing is that I saw that they are all small villas, and I have lived in Liangzhu Narada before, and I am more recognized for the brand. After staying for two days, I was very satisfied in all aspects. The lounge chairs in the yard were very comfortable, but the weather was a bit cold, and I didn't dare to go into the swimming pool of the villa. The housekeeper Zhang Runyan is very caring, and answered all kinds of questions in a timely manner. The day before we left the store, we booked the hotel's free shuttle bus in time.
Overall, it is worth recommending. I spend most of my time lying around, so I didn‚Äôt take many pictures, so I won‚Äôt post pictures.

It's just that I didn't take the initiative to introduce or ask whether I needed a mosquito net. The next day the child was bitten on the face and knew that there was a mosquito net. It is better to solve the problem, and it will provide a better anti-swelling and anti-itching medicine.

Upgrading the room directly when there are few people staying is also part of the hotel's routine operation. The service of the hotel at the same price is not optimal, and there is room for improvement, especially the security depar**ent. It's just a question of putting it vertically and horizontally, it's really a bit hypocritical, and the attitude is also very rude.

Butler Spicy is still very good, thank you!

In addition, a lot of garbage has been washed up by the wind and waves in the past few days. In addition, during the epidemic period, there was a shortage of manpower, and there was a lot of garbage on the beach. However, the special circumstances are understandable. I believe this should not be the case under normal circumstances.

During the epidemic, it was very comfortable to stay, and there was no need to go out. The breakfast was delivered to the room. The Chinese food was large and full, and the taste was very good.

There are swimming pools and hot tubs in the yard, so you can have fun regardless of the weather in the morning or evening. The privacy is also not bad, and it is very good for children who love water. The infinity pool is very nice.

I especially like the quietness of the room, which is not so quiet in many more upscale hotels.

Overall, although there are deficiencies, the flaws do not hide the good. I will recommend it to my friends and will go again!

You can play in the pool and swimming pool in the room. There are not many people, and the beach and sea view are invincible. The restaurant's breakfast is also very rich. I would like to praise Miss Bella, the housekeeper, who is really nice. When checking in, she introduced the location of various facilities in the hotel in detail. She took good care of her throughout the whole journey. Made us really feel at home and made us feel so warm. Next time I come to Perfume Bay, I will choose Narada from Perfume Bay.

msg:I have stayed at the Sanya Bay Bird's Nest Resort under Narada, but I like Perfume Bay the most. Of course, I also like the other two. The blue sky, blue sea, fine sand and quiet time are exclusive. There are not many guests and it is not noisy. They all live in villas. It's very comfortable. The hotel has been around for a long time, and the facilities are a bit outdated, especially if the door locks are good or bad, but it didn't make me feel uncomfortable at all, because the hotel's butler, Li Xiuchuan's warm service and meticulous dedication, made me very happy. It is also because of the unabated favor of Narada! Worthy of praiseüëç Next time you have the opportunity to come to Parfum Bay Narada to enjoy this quiet and elegant place to relax~

The villa is in Chinese style, with incense and tea sets, the swimming pool in the front yard and the massage pool in the back yard. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the lobby and the beach, of course. You can call a car through the front desk to pick you up. On the way, I met a staff member who chopped coconuts to send us two. At that time, I asked Xiao Li to help open it. He came to the door to help open it in person. Fresh mangosteen, rambutan, Lingshui acid powder and dross vinegar, which are rare in many hotels, are of course some improvements, but they are much better than other hotels üòã Usually I rarely give full marks, but the environment here is quiet, the fragrance of birds and flowers, and light luxury The small flaws of the matching and enthusiastic service can be ignored, and I will definitely come again next time, for the fruit and service.

There is a lot of sand in the courtyard that can easily be brought into the room, and the sun is not good. The landscape is average, it is not very satisfying to take the family to the family. One big and one small room is only suitable for a family of three, otherwise the small room is too small to spread the luggage, the outdoor environment is beautiful, and the water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is very suitable, but there is a danger of broken tiles on the bottom of the water, and I may consider it again next time. .

We have always liked the combination of hotels and homestays, and in Narada, we have experienced the services that a real hotel or homestay should have. The private swimming pool is quite big, and it is not a big problem if there are a little small leaves. The temperature in February can be used in the afternoon when there is sunshine. The bathroom and the soup pool at the back are my favorites. All the staff inside are very enthusiastic, especially Xiao Li at the front desk. The only downside may be that the hotel's beach has too many waves and cannot go into the water, which is also for safety reasons.

The whole hotel has a calm style, the infinity pool is beautiful, and not many people are the biggest advantage. There is also a battery car transfer throughout the journey.

Now you can swim and have a constant temperature. The sanitation of the room is very careful, and the facilities are complete and clean. I like the courtyard and private swimming pool of the single house. After April, the weather is a little hotter and you can bring your family and your mouth into the water without pressure. After the spring, Lingshui is already hot and you can take good pictures, and there is no pressure in the water when it is sunny. However, the waves on the beach in front of the hotel are not suitable for children to play or swim in the sea. I heard that surfing can be done after May. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello. The hotel's battery car is on call. . The surfing base is close to the hotel, and will come again in summer! The hotel also has a lot of camping projects. I had a great time this time. The housekeeper was very considerate. I also gave a small gift when I left the store. We met Yin Tao at breakfast!

Many times it basically sits on the entire beach. The swimming pool in the villa courtyard is also very clean. Unfortunately, it was cold when I went there. The small warm pool in the backyard was the biggest surprise. I didn‚Äôt think that I needed to soak in private soup in Hainan, but it was really fragrant and I soaked it three times in two nights, and it was very convenient to put water. The bad part is that there are really many mosquitoes. The hotel provides electric mosquito repellent liquid, mosquito repellent toilet water, and coiled incense. Only coiled incense is the best. The next day I told the guest room that I immediately sprayed the mosquitoes to kill the mosquitoes. The next day I ordered the incense and it was nothing. There is also a good beach here, but you can't go into the sea, you can only tread water on the shore, which is a little regrettable.

The hotel has been open for a long time and the facilities are outdated, but the service is really nothing to say. The small towel is well padded, this kind of service is very old-fashioned, standard, and there is Xiao Li at the front desk, who communicates smoothly, responds at any time, and arranges properly. However, such a good service cannot make up for the lack of hotel hardware. I hope the hotel will follow up. , at least do a good job of breakfast.

Overall still very satisfied! The room is very quiet and the environment is very good. If the food and beverage can be better, it will be perfect

msg:After staying for 10 nights, I finally moved to Sanya. Unexpectedly, before leaving the hotel, there will be a small surprise, a small gift from the tea industry, and this can't help but let people say a few more words about the welcome service attitude here.

Different from other hotels in Hainan, the staff here, whether it is the luggage brother, the garden maintenance staff, the cleaning staff, the restaurant waiter, or the front desk, will take the initiative to say hello and provide kind service. Yes, other hotels will also have service staff who take the initiative to say hello, but like this, it is very rare for all staff to maintain the same service attitude. And this is very important for a hotel, which allows people to have a natural sense of intimacy and comfort.

The hotel‚Äôs hardware is excellent, the environment is very comfortable, and the staff is courteous. Perhaps it is also a key factor in staying here over the years.

Of course, there is also a small suggestion. Hot water is available in the pool in the villa, but why can‚Äôt the pool that comes with it also introduce hot water? If the swimming pool can also have a hot water switch, then Narada after winter will become an all-weather paradise. After all, after entering November, the water in the swimming pool was still a bit cold, which discouraged a lot of desire to play in the water.

Booked a two-bed villa with a swimming pool and a warm water bath, which is especially suitable for relaxing. The best thing to experience is the butler service (Meng Meng). The aromatherapy essential oils in the room permeate the whole night. You can ask the cleaning aunt to leave candles and essential oils (orange flavor) to help you sleep.
L'Occitane's body lotion needs to be asked by the aunt. This is not good. It should be placed on the initiative, resulting in no skin care on the first day.
The spa is average, not recommended, and I don't like the technique.

There is a garden, a private pool, and a housekeeper. If you have any questions, it is very convenient to consult the housekeeper directly. The public infinity pool is also very beautiful and you can directly watch the sea. The restaurant‚Äôs dishes are delicious, and the hotel‚Äôs service is also very good. We went to the hotel‚Äôs spa on a rainy day, and the technicians were in place and comfortable. It is recommended that everyone come to play after a typhoon, a very comfortable trip.

msg:In comparison, the price/performance ratio is quite high. I have also stayed in five-star hotels in Wanning, Sanya. Narada Perfume Bay hardware services and meals are very good, especially suitable for leisure and vacation. There are not many people, although it is not possible to go to the sea. But there are few people, so few are critical. The room‚Äôs soaking pool is also very comfortable, and the bath towels are also very important for the pool and bath. There are indeed a lot of mosquitoes, but the hotel provides a variety of mosquito coils, liquid mosquito coils, and sandalwood, all of which can be ordered. Hainan estimates that in addition to staying in a high-rise hotel, text is indispensable. The housekeeper is also very caring, and the response of the room service is also considered timely. Parent-child paradise is relatively simple, but parent-child activities are still good. Especially the Dongpo meat in the Chinese restaurant is very delicious. I ordered it several times for the children, and they were all CD-ROMs.

üßπHygienic: The overall sanitation of the room is okay, that is, the swimming pool in the room. It may be because of wind and rain. The swimming pool is full of leaves. The hotel has not been cleaned up before check-in. It is recommended that the hotel can be improved.
üçÉEnvironment: The environment of the hotel is very good. Highlights are the infinity pool and private beach. However, the sand on the beach is not fine enough and has a little bit of feet. The personal feeling of the room environment may generally be because the Westin villa room I lived in the previous day still feels obvious Gap.
üîîService: Personally feel that the service is very good. The hotel also provides butler service. But because of the short check-in time, I won‚Äôt comment too much.
Generally speaking, it is quite satisfactory and a little surprise. It is worth experiencing

Although there was only half a sunny day during the stay, it was always stormy and the staff's warm and thoughtful service did not affect the good mood of the holiday at all. The hotels are all villa rooms and are very private. When you go to the beach or the restaurant, you will be picked up by a phone and battery car. Although it is not noisy at all during the big holiday, the breakfast is much more orderly than the hotels in Haitang Bay. The cartoon marshmallows prepared by the children and the freshly squeezed fruit juices of various colors are in a particularly good mood. In short, a pleasant staying experience.

msg:It took a long time for my heart to finally make a trip. There were few people, and the baby liked it so much, so I directly cancelled the plan of Shimei Bay and stayed here for three consecutive nights. The hotel is backed by Niuling Mountain and has the invincible sea view of Perfume Bay. The three days of cloudy and sunny weather are different, and the sea constantly changes to create different scenery. It can be described as a thousand mountains and seas. The sand is fine, and the whiteness is slightly inferior to some world-class white beaches. The waves are very rushing and it is dangerous to go to the sea, but it is still the best beach I have seen in China. There is nothing to say about the service. As a hotel that has been open for a long time, the maintenance is already very good. The infinity pool of the net celebrity and the wedding hall at 18 degrees north latitude are enough to attract attention. The most rare thing is that there was almost no increase in prices during the National Day, conscience!

msg:To be honest, it's not worth the trip.
Choosing Lingshui‚Äôs Perfume Bay is my own mistake. Lingshui is still relatively backward in development and suitable for young surfers. For family or parent-child travel, there are too few places to play in Lingshui, which is very inconvenient, and the scenery is not online. The beauty. It is 90 kilometers away from Sanya Airport, a one-and-a-half hour drive.
Staying in the hotel for four days, boring,
Location: Lingshui as a whole is very remote. The location of this hotel is even more remote. It is said to be a quiet niche resort hotel, but the surrounding area is very desolate. There are almost no restaurants in the surrounding area. You need to drive 30 kilometers away. The taste of several restaurants is also average. If you must come to Lingshui Le M√©ridien Westin, the location is better.
Hotel facilities: The hotel focuses on a clean private swimming pool resort hotel. In fact, there is nothing. The breakfast is poor and it is not delicious. There is one Chinese restaurant that does not eat well. The western restaurant is not delicious. The hotel only has these two options plus no food around. Yes, the great pleasure of traveling is gone. There is one swimming pool, the biggest highlight of the infinity pool. It's not interesting to watch it for a day. Other than that, there are no rides. Some people commented that you can always play in the hotel. I don't know what to play. The hotel scenery is really average. In Thailand or Sanya, at least the scenery seen from the breakfast room or lobby is beautiful. The hotel is really too small. The garden school lobby is small. I don't think its facilities meet the standards of a five-star hotel.
Service: The service attitude is really good, everything is respectful, and if there is a problem, admit mistakes, that is, the ability is too lacking, and it must be the staff training. Watching the breakfast restaurant cook making pancakes and ordering dishes in the Chinese restaurant is really anxious. But the service attitude is so good that I am embarrassed to give a bad review.

The biggest advantage here is the release of the film, nothing else

I prefer this one. There are only 90 rooms in this house, so it is basically impossible to see people except the breakfast area and public swimming pool area. Each room has its own private bath and swimming pool, and it has achieved good privacy. The greenery of the hotel is invincible, and it can be regarded as perfect except for the price. But when I learned about the sale of villas in the same plate After the price of 1300W, I got a little psychological balance~ If I have to pick the ribs in the egg, this is after all a hotel that has been in operation since 2010, and it is 11 years old after all, and the room facilities are a little old. , But by no means to the extent that it affects the senses. The front desk of the hotel is a little flustered during the peak check-in period. The location is a bit remote. It is not a problem if you drive by yourself. It is 15 minutes drive from Lingshui County. There are also good restaurants around the hotel. Others are basically perfect. of.

        Besides the environment, each villa is equipped with a private swimming pool. It is a step-by-step view after leaving your room. The best is the infinity swimming pool. The excellent location for taking pictures and punching in is definitely not to be missed. It may be that the scenery of the hotel is really beautiful. , We saw a lot of couples taking wedding photos here.
        Finally, I would like to thank Meng Meng, who received us during check-in, patiently explained the situation and precautions of the entire hotel, added my WeChat, and contacted her whenever there is anything. During the three days of staying, she did not bother her less. Every time, she responded to me as soon as possible and helped us make arrangements. It was very nice.

First of all, the hotels are all pool villas, with relatively few people, so you can stay away from the hustle and bustle and take a leisurely vacation; secondly, the hotel‚Äôs landscaping is very beautiful and the vegetation is prosperous, and you feel like walking in a natural oxygen bar; the hotel‚Äôs 88-meter infinity swimming pool, seen from the lobby The color of the sea and the sky is refreshing, the filming effect is quite good, and the hotel also has travel shooting services. In terms of catering, both the breakfast and the Chinese restaurant produce good quality, but the price is slightly higher; in particular, the hotel‚Äôs service really feels at home. The staff will take the initiative to say hello when they encounter it. Our housekeeper, Xiao Li, is even more enthusiastic and responsive. , I applied for a free breakfast for my child, asked if I needed help every day, and delivered partridge tea when I checked out. Looking forward to the next opportunity to stay again.

Very good, the butler Anna‚Äôs service was very careful and caring. She applied for breakfast for the children and told me directly on WeChat if something happened. She would arrange it in advance. Before leaving, although she was not on duty, she still entrusted the front desk to give tea as a gift. You need to call a battery car to travel in the villa area. The service of the younger brother Xiaozhuang is very good, and it will be there soon after calling the mobile phone. The hotel‚Äôs layout paid great attention to details. The bed, including the floor towels at the bathroom entrance, were decorated with flowers. One day when I returned to the room, there were wooden bookmarks on the bed in each room. The hotel also arranges various activities for children every day, praise.

Hotel view:
The infinity pool has sea views, and the film is great. The sea of the hotel faces east, and you can see the sunrise üåÖüëçüèª. The night view is also beautiful. There are not many people playing on the beach in the hotel, but the sand is thicker than Wanning, with broken shells and corals. You need to wear diving shoes. Walking barefoot will hurt. The waves on the beach are relatively big, so you cannot go into the sea.

Hotel breakfast:
It varies from person to person. I feel good personally. I like to eat more, but my friends in the same group feel average and have few things.

Hotel travel:
We arrived at the hotel by car. There is an underground parking lot. If you don‚Äôt have a car, you can only choose a hotel to eat. The price is more expensive. It is more convenient to have a car, but there are not many shops nearby.

Improve:
The hotel‚Äôs wifi is not very good. I booked a two-bedroom villa at Narada, the router for the double bed room is 6 antennas, and the router for the double bed room is an old-fashioned single antenna router. Although some of the staff have seen it, There is no improvement, and the 4G signal in the room is not good, so I can only walk to the living room with a mobile phone.

The environment of this hotel is really beautiful. As soon as I enter the hotel, I am greeted with endless swimming pools and sea views. Each room has a separate swimming pool so that our stay has enough privacy. The green environment of the hotel is not to say. It feels like being in a tropical rainforest. It is very convenient to have a golf cart to pick you up every time you travel. The breakfast is also good. To catch up with my birthday, the hotel also sent a cake specially, which made us very touched, but the amount is too large, the cream is too much and too much wasted. It is recommended that you can prepare a small piece of delicious cake in the future. Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings, Because the hotel is located in a remote location and there is no restaurant entertainment to enjoy, under this premise, the hotel has only one restaurant, which is slightly insufficient. The bar only provides bottled drinks and full bottles of wine for sale, so that you can drink without snacks. It becomes very boring. In addition, the service time of the restaurant is too limited. I have no food later. The beach is completely forbidden to go to the sea. Friends who like to absorb water should think twice. Want to go surfing in Wanning, it takes 15 minutes by car. It's okay. The hotel is generally luxurious but lacks dining options. That's it.

The room has its own swimming pool, which is very convenient, but the equipment in the room is too old. There is a soaking pool in the backyard, and the water is only discharged after a long time after the staff came to repair it.
The breakfast in the hotel was a little messy and no one took a seat. Among them was a guy frying bacon with a very lazy attitude. Asking him two questions was very reluctant to answer, unlike the guy next to the bar, who was very enthusiastic.

msg:There is no photo evaluation, because I really don't have the mood to take pictures in the hotel.
I really don't understand why this hotel has such a high rating, it is easy to mislead tourists.

üöó Transportation: It's best to drive there by yourself, because there is nothing nearby. There are no street lights around at night. If you go to a nearby restaurant for dinner on the reviews, you must drive, not ~walk ~walk, because there are no street lights, there will occasionally be cow dung on the road!

üßπSanitation: The surface is hygienic, but there is a lot of dust on the bedside lamp and lamp holder, and there is a lot of dust on the movable TV stand, which seems to have not been wiped for a long time. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the roomü¶ü, one was killed in the first half of the night, and another was killed in the second half of the night. Because I am sensitive to mosquitoes, I will be completely red and swollen for several days after being bitten by mosquitoes, so I basically did not sleep on the first night of my stay, and I have been fighting mosquitoes. The room itself was dimly lit, with all the lights on, and it was hard to find, very frustrating. In addition, when I first checked in in the afternoon, I found mosquitoes, so I specially asked for two electric mosquito coils to be inserted at the two bedsides, but I didn't expect it to be completely useless. I don't know if the hotel has done any cleaning before the guests check in*.

üîîService: The hotel staff will basically not greet you when they encounter you, but if you have any questions, they will still be enthusiastic to help. After negotiation with Ctrip's customer service, we refunded the room for the next two nights, and the little brother at the front desk helped it smoothly. The service is alright. The housekeeper's younger brother contacted me one day in advance to help me upgrade to Jinglan Residence, which was highly praised, although I only stayed for one night.

Breakfast: If you charge such an expensive room rate, then the breakfast can only be said to be too bad. If you book a hotel of the same price in Sanya, any one's breakfast will be better than this one.

In addition, the hotel does not have a heated swimming pool. If you feel that the water in your villa pool is cold, then you will basically be unable to swim when you stay in this hotel.

If you are indifferent to mosquitoes, think the room is almost clean, and you are just looking for a quiet hotel with nothing, then this is ok. Others, be careful!

First, there is no special passage for people to walk in the parking lot. You can only walk in and out from the driveway, which is slightly inconvenient. Second, the waiter in the breakfast restaurant only records the room number or is busy collecting the table. There is no special receptionist. Customers need to find an empty table to sit on.

Speaking of the hotel, we are two big and two small, no extra bed, we are one big and two naps on the big bed, and one adult sleeps on the couch. The mattress is very comfortable and the pillows are quite comfortable. We are not self-driving, but we saw a parking lot passing by. The Perfume Bay beach is not as good as Yalong Bay. It has a bit of shells, which is still acceptable. The waves are a bit big and cannot swim in the sea. Relatively speaking, there are relatively few people on the beach. There are two public swimming pools, the upper one is an infinity pool, the scenery is very good, the photo is this pool. There is also a swimming pool below, where the kayaks are there. This time I gave a voucher, but we didn't experience it. The breakfast is pretty good. The dregs vinegar and Lingshui acid powder are delicious. The omelettes can also have different tenderness to choose from. There are many different flavors of juice, all freshly squeezed. According to the previous reviews, there may be more mosquitoes. The greenery of the whole hotel is very good. There are indeed mosquitoes outside. Fortunately, there are a variety of mosquito coils in the room, and I didn't get bitten much. The room also has Liushen toilet water. The entire hotel is a villa, so you call for battery cars to get in and out, and you can send a car soon after you call the hotel. And because of swimming several times a day, the demand for bath towels is very large, and the hotel will send us quickly. The service was really good, and the staff were very polite, and gave the local partridge tea as a souvenir before leaving. Husband said that two nights were too short, and he would come again later.

msg:The hotel butler, Meng Meng, was very good and thoughtful and caring. He brought the elderly and children. Because it is a villa with a pool, he prepared the children‚Äôs swimming laps and fences in advance, and felt his care. Knowing that the old man likes to boil mineral water to make tea, he specially sent a large bucket of mineral water. The adult toiletries are L‚ÄôOccitane‚Äôs children‚Äôs two-in-one shampoo and shower gel from Haroshan. Because there was a wedding banquet, the home set meal was set late and almost didn't eat it. Later, the housekeeper Meng Meng gave the arrangement and the seafood was fresh and delicious. The view of the sea is very suitable for taking pictures! Mr. Zeng, the travel photographer, is also very good. The shooting technique is very good. He helped to take pictures of the whole family, and I am very satisfied that all the negatives are left.

The hotel is beautiful and quiet. It is very suitable for vacation. The infinity pool is great. The restaurant food is also very good, the girl especially likes to eat the salt and pepper shrimp in the hotel restaurant, the room facilities are good, all the single-family pool villas, but the pool water in the room is relatively shallow, not suitable for adults, a lot of leaves fall on the wind after the wind The swimming pool didn‚Äôt feel very good. The hotel‚Äôs service was very good. It was equipped with an exclusive butler. The shuttle bus was available on call. The private beach was beautiful. Many people came to take wedding photos. The hotel‚Äôs design was also very good. It was the best one of our trip. I'm sorry to have only booked for two nights, I will definitely stay at your home next time you come to Hainan!

The beach here is very soft, but the waves are so big that it is not allowed to swim in the sea. The staff reminded that they are all undercurrents.
There are relatively few restaurants near the hotel, and when encountering self-willed cows, they take a break in the morning on the road.

msg:This time I went to Hainan for a total of 3 days. I stayed at this hotel for the first time. Compared with other hotels with sea view balconies, this jungle villa type hotel can really relax people and fully experience the joy of holiday. The privacy of the room is very good. There is a shuttle battery car that can directly transfer to the room. In particular, this hotel has a super long beach. At night, you can lie on the beach and watch the stars. There are not many people in the swimming pool. Those who want to take pictures can take pictures beautifully. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the meals. Breakfast and dinner are very rich and worth recommending. Finally, I would like to talk about the service staff, Xiao Li, who is warm and considerate, caring for guests in every possible way, and has a degree of relaxation, which will not make people feel disturbed. It is very good and needs to be liked.

msg:The swimming pool is very beautiful, the grass is quite big, the room color is a bit dark Chinese style, the wooden table is ugly, it is recommended to change to another style, we live in a 450 square meter one-bedroom villa, more than 2000 including breakfast, cost-effective not bad. The whole environment is pretty good. Breakfast is indoors, but there are tables and chairs outside. The waiter does not want us to sit outside, but we still insist on sitting outside for safety. The hotel's anti-virus awareness is not strong. How safe it is for guests to sit outside and eat. If a guest is infected, then your hotel is closed, the loss is great, and there will be a bad reputation. This bad influence will take a long time. Although it is far outside, one day, sitting on the seat under the eaves, it was still drenched by the rain. It would be great if the hotel could support the umbrellas. The virus is a protracted battle. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ten years, eight years, and 20 years. , Change the way the hotel eats. The reason why I came to Sanya was because I was able to sit on an outside table for dinner, but I found that some hotels and restaurants still eat in confined spaces, which makes people very uneasy. You can sit outside and enjoy the scenery while eating. Some guests are afraid of heat and are willing to eat in an air-conditioned house. But quite a few people like me are afraid to eat in the room. I came to Sanya for the third time this year. I dared to eat in the hotel a few times before. If the hotel can do something better, I will spend more in the hotel.

msg:The infinity pool is beautiful, and the pool in the villa is also beautiful. The small bedroom is too small. It rained, so the floating afternoon tea didn't float. It's a pity. Meng Meng at the front desk is very nice. He can solve problems in time and is very patient. The pool was not used because the service staff on the first day didn't know how to drain the water, and it was not used again on the second day because it rained. There are many mosquitoes. Maybe it's because of the rich vegetation. There are many mosquitoes in the yard of the villa.
One complaint is that the bottled water is not enough. The aunt who does the cleaning doesn't deliver water. She told me that the two bedrooms are replenished once a day for a total of six bottles of water. For taking children to make milk powder, it is not enough. If it is four big and two small, it is relatively less. The Nongfu Spring Hotel ** is given. If you buy it yourself, it is 6 yuan a bottle. The aunt directly asked me to pay for it. I guess the hotel makes money from this! For a resort hotel, this has never been encountered. The overall feeling lowers the grade of the hotel!
