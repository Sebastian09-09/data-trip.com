msg:Awesome location and extraordinary services!! Especially when we need to change the room from our first booking to second booking (with different family members so we have 3 different bookings), REN JUN DANIEL provided extraordinary services!!

This hotel is the first Hilton (changed to Grand Metro now) in Nanjing, 10 minute from Zhong Shan Landmarks, close to every where. Although not brand new, but the services and location make up every thing. Buffet breakfast has all kinds of different style gourmet, and changing every day. 

Beautiful view from the window!

The service is okay.  I used the lobby cafe tea place- the service is lukewarm.  But the front desk gave me 4 cups of coffee or tea free from the place.  So it cancelled out the negative service experience.  ￼

Metropark is next to the Ming Palace. I often passed by it when I came to Nanjing last time.
I was lucky to upgrade to a suite this time, and there was a late check-out.
The overall style is that of an old star hotel. Everything is very old-fashioned. I like it very much, and my girlfriend is also very satisfied.
Comfortable service, practical facilities, but unfortunately I didn't experience the dining.
If I have the opportunity to come to Nanjing again, I will choose here again.

The only shortcoming of the hotel is that the shower head in the shower room is fixed, and once the water is turned on, it will definitely be splashed with cold water. Fortunately, there is a movable shower head on the bathtub to make up for the shortcoming.

so I just stayed next to the museum~
Go out of the hotel, turn left for a few dozen meters, the location is amazing!

The front desk Xiao Li was very enthusiastic and upgraded us to a mountain view room.
In the room, you can see: Purple Mountain shrouded in clouds and mist,
and you can also pay attention to the long queues at the museum downstairs in real time...
Watch the sunrise at the museum in the morning and the night view of the museum in the evening,
it's beautiful!
Really,
The happiest thing about this trip to Nanjing is that I chose the right hotel~

Xiao Li also sent us a tourist map and route reference,
which is very thoughtful👍

The hotel's hardware facilities are also very good,
If you need a room, call and it will be delivered within 10 minutes~

The hotel is in a prime location, very close to the nearby Zhongshan Scenic Area.
It's also very convenient to go to Hongshan Zoo, the high-speed rail station, and take the subway.

Told my friends that we will stay here again next time we come to Nanjing~🌸

msg:When I came to Nanjing for tourism, my friend recommended this hotel. Because of its good location, next to the Nanjing Museum, and affordable price, I immediately booked two nights. After entering the door, the reception hall is super large, with restaurants and cafes, which is very convenient for eating and drinking. What I am most grateful for is that there is no thick chemical fragrance sprayed in the hall (many hotels spray, which almost suffocates me), but there is spray in the elevator, so I have to wear a mask and cover my palms ☹️, It rained yesterday, and the hotel provided umbrellas for free, which was great. I borrowed one and went to the museum next door. I made an appointment on the spot and visited the history museum. I came back and had a meal at the Korean restaurant in the hotel, which was very good. Today the weather turned good, so I stayed another day and visited the famous Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. I like the scenery there very much. All the staff have a very good attitude, such as Xiao Li at the front desk and Zhang Haizhen, the guest room on the 14th floor. Thank you!

msg:In 2019, I came to Nanjing alone and stayed at Vision. The location is good, just next to the Nanjing Expo. This time I brought my parents and children to Nanjing to play. After staying in a hotel in Xinjiekou for two days, I checked out early and came to Vision again. In contrast, you can't go wrong by choosing a branded old five-star hotel.

Lu Qing at the front desk received and checked in. Free breakfast for an extra bed was given. Because of various problems such as decoration noise, I changed rooms three times, and they were all solved. The young man in the concierge depar**ent also ran up and down to help change rooms several times. Thank you very much!

I especially want to praise the staff at the door, Brother Yang Huaiqiang, who is very enthusiastic and works very seriously. He will write down the license plate number of the taxi and give it to the guests so that they can contact when needed. This detail really makes me feel that Vision's management and training are particularly good, and the old five-star service is really nothing to say. Because of negligence, I forgot my bag in the trunk when I got off the car at the hotel in Xinjiekou. Thanks to the phone number on the taxi ticket, otherwise I would have to check the hotel's surveillance. Judging from the details of the service, good is really good! In the context of the hotel industry starting to increase good reviews and treats, good reviews for the sake of good reviews seem to be missing something. What can really impress guests is not deliberately catering to guests, but the intimate and professional service that guests naturally feel. This is the killer move! As an old five-star hotel, Vivanta has done it! Very good!

Based on my experience of staying twice, I highly recommend everyone to choose Vivanta when coming to Nanjing! The view of the mountain view room is very healing, with a large area of ​​green. And it is very quiet at night, the elderly and children sleep very well!

Goodbye Vivanta, thank you for meeting, see you later!

The socket in the room is broken, the bathtub needs to be manually pressed, the swimming pool is not open, there are no children's toothbrushes and slippers, and there is a musty smell when entering the room. The most complaining thing is the breakfast. For breakfast per person, you have to queue for 20 minutes to eat noodles. It's not that the noodles are delicious, but there is nothing else to eat. You have to queue up for fried eggs. I ate four fried eggs. There is basically no fruit, no bananas, only a few pieces of cantaloupe, and only a few kinds of bread. Noodles and other hot dishes are basically the same as those provided for free in 300-400 hotels. The price has gone up, but the service has not kept up. Suggest improvement. By the way, the delivery is okay. The 22 pickled mustard greens and shredded pork noodles are good. It is worth praising and not expensive. There is also the basketball court. They said they would charge a fee. It's terrible...

msg:The location is great, and it is convenient for travel. It is separated from the Nanjing Museum by a wall. It is very close to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Ming Palace Site, Presidential Palace, etc. You can ride a bike to it. Next to it is the Ming Palace Station. John at the front desk also provided great service and took the initiative to upgrade the room type. The response of the room service was also very fast. It can be felt that the service staff have received good training, and everyone has a strong sense of wanting good reviews. The photo is the view outside the window, which is very good. It is said that this is an upgraded room type with superior twin beds. Unfortunately, blood stains were found on the quilt. In general, during the May Day holiday, the price-performance ratio is not bad. Between the 1k All Seasons and the 1k2 this Metropark, it is better to choose the Metropark. Especially this one has two 1.3m single beds, which is the biggest highlight.

msg:I was originally hesitant between traditional star hotels and non-standard characteristic B&Bs in scenic spots, but I finally chose the old five-star hotel, which really did not disappoint me! The location is extremely advantageous, separated by a wall from the Nanbo Museum, very close to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Purple Mountain, and the Ming Palace Museum. It takes a few steps to climb the Ming City Wall, and it is not far from the Confucius Temple, Qinhuai River, and Xuanwu Lake. In terms of hotel facilities, the room is large, clean and hygienic, with a bathtub and shower room, and comfortable bedding; in terms of service, from the concierge to the front desk to the guest room, they are all polite and courteous. The front desk lady Elena Sun is warm and thoughtful, and has been following up the service; Aunt Bai, the room attendant on the sixth floor, is very nice and responsive! It gave me a great experience!

Convenient transportation! The subway station can be reached in one or two minutes on foot.
The Ming City Wall is just outside the door, and it is very close to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Music Stage, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, Meiling Palace, Purple Mountain, Xuanwu Lake, and Crescent Lake.
The Nanjing Museum starts at 9 am. After making an appoin**ent, you can go downstairs to visit. You can go back to the hotel for lunch at noon, sleep for a while, and then enter the museum to continue visiting. You only need to take the subway to go to Confucius Temple. You can also take the subway to Nanjing South Station.
You can order takeout at will, and there are many delicious places near the hotel!
In short, it is convenient!

Convenient for self-driving and free parking.
The hotel lobby is magnificent and imposing, and the decoration style is somewhat ancient.
The room is spacious and bright, the two-meter bed is comfortable, and the soundproofing is good. After a tiring day on the road, the sleep quality is very good. There is also a bathtub, which can relieve muscle soreness.
Walk to Nanjing Expo, Ming Palace Ruins Park, buses and subways are not far away, five minutes from the subway entrance, and there is no traffic jam to Jiming Temple.
Book early, otherwise there will be no rooms. Nanjing tourism is popular, and Vivanta is very cost-effective #Destination for staying in a hotel #High-end hotel that you will understand after sleeping

The lobby on the first floor is also very grand, with the style of an old five-star hotel. Accommodation and parking are free, which is very important to me. Old hotels do have old and outdated facilities. You can feel that they also want to change, but it is probably not so easy to completely renovate. The bed is very comfortable and the quilt is very soft. I booked a few nights and one evaluation was full marks upon request💯. This one will be evaluated realistically. The first picture is to say that the curtain rod was thrown into the gap above the head by some second-year guest. I repaired it for a long time before pulling it😐. Check the guest rooms more carefully in the future.

Even a taxi to Niushou Mountain, which is very far away, only costs tens of yuan. The location is very satisfactory.

Facilities: The driver said that this is an old hotel, the original landmark building. This is not important to us. We are not here to clean up the hotel. What is important is quality and safety.

Service: The key point is service. Special thanks to the lobby manager Qian Jin. He contacted the hotel before coming to check in. It was my son's birthday on the day of check-in. The manager had already sent the welcome fruit plate and birthday cake to the hotel on the same day, and also sent a youth group. , very attentive ❤️ Thank you again for making us feel very warm.

Metropark is an old five-star hotel with poor equipment, but the service is still good. There is no drinking water. Four bottles were delivered within three minutes of a phone call.

The hotel room is spacious and the breakfast is rich in variety. There are local Nanjing snacks such as duck blood vermicelli soup, pan-fried buns, sweet-scented osmanthus rice dumplings, salted duck, etc. The taste is very good.

The restaurant has a good environment, the facilities are clean and tidy, the waiters are polite, and the dishes are closed on time. In particular, Manager Xia helped introduce Nanjing's special delicacies and was warm and friendly, which made our stay very happy. We were very impressed the first time and will continue to choose next time.

msg:It is particularly difficult to book a hotel in Nanjing during the Spring Festival. The strong New Year flavor attracts tourists from all over the country. The Confucius Temple, Laomendong and Zhongshan Scenic Area are full. So you can imagine how difficult it is to book a satisfactory hotel. The price cannot be too outrageous and the room cannot be lower than five-star standards. Metropark became the only one I liked when browsing on Ctrip. This is an authentic old five-star hotel. The five-star hotel brand issued by the state hangs impressively on the pillars of the magnificent lobby. From the doorman, lobby, concierge, front desk, and elevators, the first to come into contact with the tabletop software and hardware It seems that it meets the five-star standard. The doorman is not like the doormen of other hotels who insist that you stop in the basement. Instead, he humanely knows that you are exhausted and there is a seat on the ground floor. He will help you stop in front of the lobby door on the ground floor. VIP parking space. A bespectacled staff member named Zhou at the front desk even enthusiastically provided tips for visiting Nanjing during the New Year. He patiently provided self-driving tour routes, subway routes and other various routes. He was well-spoken and well-trained, and he felt like he graduated from Tsinghua and Peking University. Top students have training experience here. I saw some negative comments in the reviews saying that the decoration of this hotel is too old. I think so. A hotel is divided into hardware and software. The software must be five-star and there is no dispute. In terms of hardware, the wallpaper, furniture, and carpets in the room can feel a bit old, but the bedding and bathroom facilities are visibly brand new, and the materials used are also very particular. Even the toilet is an electric toilet, and the scenery outside the window is even better. It is a room with city and mountain views that is refreshing and unobstructed. The hotel is very close to the Zhongshan Scenic Area, and transportation is extremely convenient. Even during the Chinese New Year, there was no traffic jam. Finally, I hope that Metropark can renovate the rooms as soon as possible. The high-quality services inherited over the years have been carried forward, and the hardware that also keeps pace with the times can make the hotel shine even more. I wish the hotel business is prosperous!

I called the front desk a few minutes in advance to inform the situation and asked the front desk to prepare. There was no concierge at the door of the hotel when the car arrived, and there was no one at the front desk. He only came after calling, but there was no greeting. Because in the past, due to flight delays, I was charged half-price room rates at other international five-star hotels. When I asked, the front desk replied: Upgrading is not possible. Someone will pick us up at the hotel tomorrow morning and ask if we can get a complimentary breakfast. The front desk replied: No. First time in years feeling so unhappy in a five star hotel. Isn’t it the warmth of home that you get when you book a five-star hotel? Is it because the hotel management has no training and implementation? (I read Ctrip reviews during breakfast, so it should be yes) Is it a problem with the front desk waiter’s personal quality? (The long-haired waitress wearing glasses who served the front desk after 1 o’clock on February 5th, I really think she is not qualified to serve this bowl) It was a very unpleasant experience Such a great stay experience that I don’t even want to come back to Nanjing again!

Children can play independently and sleep in small tents. However, other facilities in the room are old and have a sense of age when used and looked at. Especially the shower head and drain in the bathtub, which need to be replaced with new ones as soon as possible. In this twin room, there are two fixed lights between the two beds, so the beds cannot be combined, which is a pity for a parent-child room.

Environment: Living on the 20th floor (parent-child rooms should always be on high floors), the night view is unobstructed, beautiful and quiet~

The disadvantage is: the hotel decoration is relatively early, very quaint, and the facilities are relatively old!

msg:I booked this hotel for the convenience of taking my children to the museum. When I entered the room, I saw that it was too old. It was at least ten or twenty years behind modern hotels, right? More than a thousand dollars for me to live in a room with dirty carpets, moldy walls, and a damp smell? Am I crazy? There is also a snack street outside the hotel, full of the smell of stinky tofu and grilled squid. . . I quickly called Ctrip to cancel the room for the next two days. You can't find anything worse than this one at the same price point if you close your eyes, right? I really gritted my teeth and slept all night, and checked out early the next day and changed hotels. The hotel hardware is not good, and the service awareness cannot keep up. In the parent-child double bed room, except for three pairs of pillows, everything else is two. I have always been proud of myself as someone who knows how to choose a hotel, but this time I was slapped in the face.

The service from Xiao Lu in the lobby is good, and the room facilities are well-equipped, which is great. Xiao Cang and Xiao Zhou in the restaurant have great service attitude and gave us the best price. Thumbs up! The hotel is located next to Nanjing Museum, one stop from the Zhongshan Scenic Area subway, and very convenient to the city. In addition, the waiter Xie Fangfang was also great. Knowing that we had children, she gave us two extra bottles of water.

msg:Before the trip, although I knew that the hotel was old and I was fully prepared, I was still disappointed when I checked in. I evaluated the stay experience in a realistic manner because there is a museum attraction next door to the hotel and I originally wanted to take my children to visit it. It was convenient, so I chose Metropark. In fact, all the people visiting the museum were stranded outside the hotel lobby. The environment was so bad that even the taxis I ordered couldn't get in. I was confused. All the facilities in the room are those of a fast hotel. The wallpaper is peeling and the basin is yellow. The most unbearable thing is that there is no big light in the whole room. The light is dim, even for children who want to read. The bathroom is small and poorly laid out. The shower room is so small that it can only be used by one person. When taking a bath with a baby, an adult has to stand next to the toilet. There is also a cheap hair dryer. Since the room has a super-large bed, the hotel must consider bringing it. If children stay, they don't even have slippers or toothbrushes. I asked for only four bottles of mineral water a day, which I have never encountered before. As for breakfast, it is probably only a three-star standard. There are few varieties and poor taste. What is speechless is that the small wontons are gone at 8 o'clock. The waiter and I She said she wanted to have breakfast, but the steamer that said meat buns contained vegetable buns... I just want to say that I don't know how I got this score of 4.8. I always believe in Ctrip and choose Ctrip. This time I am so disappointed. The hotel is always fine. , I can keep up in other aspects, but what’s the result? Except for the price increase during the holidays, everything else remains the same. I will never choose a five-star hotel like this again.

msg:Taking advantage of the autumn holiday, I took my baby to visit this ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, a city with cultural heritage. I am very grateful to Xiao Zhou at the front desk for upgrading me to the Supreme Suite, which is much better than I expected. I looked at many hotels online and combined the following three points: I chose this Zhonghai Metropark with good value for money: 1. Location, less than 200 meters from the subway entrance, convenient to go anywhere on Line 2. It is 3 or 4 stops away from the Presidential Palace, less than 100 meters from the Palace Museum, less than 2km from the Zhongshan Scenic Area, Confucius Temple and Qinhuai River are also convenient to take the subway, and the slightly farther Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall is also a subway trip, 20 minutes, very convenient. . 2. Hygiene, this is the most important thing when taking children. It is clean and tidy, and it also has a bathtub that the baby likes. It is very touching to have a bathtub at this price. 3. Price, I think the cost performance is okay. The upgrade of more than 500 yuan also comes with a buffet breakfast, which is quite satisfactory. In summary, I would recommend it and stay again if I have the opportunity.

Facilities: It is indeed a bit old, but it has all the necessary functions, and the environment is relatively comfortable, so there is no problem of not being able to live in it.
Service: Very polite, especially cleaning the room and taking care of whether there is anyone there, saying hello when coming in and out, and taking the initiative to help carry luggage.
Price: It is a medium price. After all, it is comparable to high-end hotels. You can also see the scenery of Nanjing Museum and Zhongshan. It is considered a very good hotel!

The room is a refurbished room, clean and tidy. 3. It is convenient to eat in the hotel. The restaurant service on the first floor is very enthusiastic. The decoration of the Chinese restaurant on the top floor is too old and the air conditioner is not strong. The view is good. It should be good if it is reorganized. Comprehensive conclusion: Although the old hotel is well maintained, the lobby holds marble stairs and hand-painted palace wall paintings. Will stay again next time.
Facilities: Good
Hygiene: Good
Environment: convenient
Service: The check-out at the front desk needs to be strengthened. There is no separate check-in and check-out counters so that everyone queues up in order, resulting in a very long check-out queue. Basically, it is recommended to divert passengers who are staying in the house.

First of all, I would like to thank Xiao Zhou at the front desk for helping me upgrade my room type. He was also very considerate and asked me about my favorite direction. He also explained the precautions in detail.
I live on the eighth floor. The floor is not very high, but it is said that this is a newly renovated room in 2017 and it is a non-smoking floor. First of all, it is very quiet. It is indeed an old five-star air conditioner. It ventilates all day long whether I am in the room or not, but sometimes it still happens. There is a slight smell of smoke and moisture. It is cleaned quickly every day. It is clean and quite safe. The shower room does have some small toilet drains that need to be improved.

But overall I am still very satisfied. The service staff have very good attitudes. They also help with luggage and greetings. It is very close to the subway and Nanjing. I will choose to continue to stay in Nanjing in the future. I hope it will get better~

Service: The concierge staff are very helpful and helpful, helping to open the door and pick up luggage. Xiao Wang, the front desk check-in, is enthusiastic and attentive, and upgraded to a newly renovated room for free.

Environment: The hotel has convenient transportation. When you go out, turn left and walk a few dozen meters to the Nanjing Museum, one of the three major museums in the country. Turn right and walk a few dozen meters to the subway station/bus station.

Facilities: The entire hotel has a strong old-money style, and the rooms are comfortable and hygienic. The black and green tea provided are all tea leaves, not tea bags. I have tried them all and the quality is not bad. It is a very satisfying stay experience and the price-performance ratio is very high.

Others: There is a "small food market" in front of the hotel starting in the evening.

Because I brought a baby, one of them was very thoughtful and helped to upgrade the 2.6-meter luxury double bed room for free. The room was a bit messy with things in it, so I didn’t take a picture of the real thing. I found a few pictures on the Internet, and they were exactly the same without color difference. Picture 2 is a 2.6m deluxe double room, and pictures 2 and 3 are the other two 2.1m double rooms. They were cleaned in a timely manner. It is clean and tidy, because it is the only high-rise building near Xuanwu District, with a very wide view. The last picture is the view from the window.
The buffet breakfast is also very rich. I took some pictures for your reference. There are many kinds of coffee and food. There are both Chinese and Western food, and the taste is not bad.
The transportation is quite convenient, and it is very convenient to go to Nanjing Station and all common scenic spots.
It is strongly recommended to choose this hotel when traveling in Nanjing

The subway station is very close and you can quickly get to Xinjiekou, Confucius Temple, Laomendong and other attractions. It is very convenient to check in. However, the facilities are old, the rooms are quite decent, not very big, and the windows basically cannot be opened. The sheets, pillowcases and other items in the room were quite dirty with fine dust. The air conditioner was turned on very hot, because it was a bit stuffy and uncomfortable without opening the windows.

In addition, Ms. Chen Juan from the room service was a light in our Nanjing trip. She went to the first floor to help us get the children's slippers.

The bed is very big, it should be 2.3 meters or 2.6 meters, but it is just two beds spliced ​​together. I originally thought that the people in the middle would sleep very uncomfortable because there would be a gap in the middle, but after sleeping for two days, it felt okay, and the family of three still slept quite spaciously. The waiter on the 7th floor is very good. She responded quickly when there was a need. The room was cleaned very clean. The air-conditioning quilt I brought was also folded neatly for me. I didn’t use the kettle. I took two bottles of mineral water with me every day. Play. There is only one room card. Taking the room card away will not affect the air conditioner.

I like to live higher, but the TV cannot be turned on. Give me I moved to the 7th floor, and when I entered the door, I felt that the air conditioner was sufficient.

Knowing that we are traveling, she even gave us a self-made travel guide at the front desk. She took the initiative to add WeChat and responded to our requests. The waiter Xu Hongzhen saw us buying mineral springs when cleaning the room For water, I was afraid that the mineral water in the room was not enough to drink, so I added a few more bottles for us; every time we went out, the concierge asked us if we needed help or called for a car. This is a hotel worth recommending.

The hotel is very close to the Nanjing Museum. On the first day, the elderly and children were too tired to walk and it was very convenient to go back to sleep in the afternoon. It's just that the hotel is too old and the high-rise windows can't be opened. In short, it's cost-effective. It's convenient to visit the museum and Zhongshan scenic spot. The Korean barbecue downstairs is also delicious.

However, the door feels messy when repairing the door. The front desk was a bit aloof. One question and three questions, and I also suggested Baidu 🤨. I asked different staff members different travel questions at different times, and they were all the same.
The room had a big bed and a great view. But the five-star hotel doesn’t come to clean even after staying here, which also refreshes my three views. After a day of playing, I don’t even have clean bath towels🤐
Dinner buffet 158 ​​per person is a good deal

msg:1. We changed from the B&B in Confucius Temple. The B&B is too small to accommodate our family of three! The Metropark room is big enough and spacious! Ignore the situation where we messed up the photos.
2. Metropark Hotel has a good location, only two or three hundred meters away from Minggu Palace Station on Line 2, and is separated from Nanjing Museum by a wall! It happened that there was an exhibition in the museum, and the child went there twice, very happy. Then we shared bicycles to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Meiling Palace and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, not far away! Subway + bus to Niushou Mountain.
3. From entering the hotel gate, the concierge, the front desk, the guest room, all the hotel staff encountered are of high quality, good attitude, and fast service response, which makes our whole family very satisfied!
4. An old five-star hotel, although the hardware facilities have been upgraded, but there are still imprints of old equipment, which has a sense of age and is quite tasteful! Another thing to praise is the elevator, which is very fast, but it does not make the ears uncomfortable, and there is no obvious sense of pause. The car space is large enough. There are 6 or 8 elevators in total, which is very convenient!
5. The price is beautiful! I hope it will be at this price again in the future! By the way, the hotel has a free gym and swimming pool.
6. I have never written so many reviews, which is enough to show my love for this store! Hahahahahaha

1. When I first entered the room, the toilet was still flushing and it was very noisy. I don’t know if someone had just used it or there was something wrong with the toilet! There are still water stains on the toilet rim! Later, the flushing stopped and there was no noise, so I didn’t call customer service!
2. There are no dental appliances in the standard rooms! There was only an empty dental kit box inside! Called and had it delivered.
3. Even if the facilities are old, the light in the bathroom is broken! It couldn't be opened for no reason after we took a shower! I didn’t call customer service in the middle of the night! Very depressed! Very speechless!
4. When you check out, give feedback to the front desk. You know the professional smile and rhetoric at the front desk, which is completely insincere!
In short, the standard room priced at 900 yuan without breakfast gave me an experience that was worse than even a budget hotel. It was very bad!

msg:Brother Zhou at the reception in the lobby is very good. Originally, the buffet breakfast was delivered once a day, but he helped us move the breakfast rolls that were given to us on the same day for each of the two days, so that we don’t have to go to the hotel for the buffet breakfast in two days. In the second day, you can eat some special breakfast shops in Nanjing.
And he also helped us upgrade the super big bed room for free. The bed seems to be 2.6 meters, and it is not a problem to sleep five people. The room is on the 27th floor. It is very quiet and has good lighting. There is a refrigerator in it, which is very convenient.
The location of the hotel is still very convenient, and it is very fast to go to most attractions.
However, maybe because the hotel has been around for a long time, it is inevitable that some facilities still have obvious signs of use. There are stains on the toilet that cannot be wiped off, so I dare not sit on it directly, and the momentum is not very strong. I found it several times. Rush once.
The wet and dry separation is also not very good. Although there is a shower room, it is a high fixed shower head. If you want to be more convenient, you have to stand outside the bathtub, and there is a movable shower next to it, but that The water pipe is a bit short, and it’s not very convenient for me to use it to wash my back. My boyfriend is 185, and the bathroom is full of water every time after taking a shower. I can’t go to the toilet when he takes a shower. After taking a shower, I also have to be careful not to step on the water. After all, the hotel slippers are not waterproof, so I hope to at least put a curtain on the side of the bathtub.
The hotel's buffet breakfast doesn't have many types and the taste is average, but it's a gift, so I don't think it matters. If you want to spend money, forget it. There are many shops opposite the hotel, so there is no need to eat at the hotel. There is even a snack street next to the hotel exit. I think the food in it is quite delicious, better than the hotel's buffet breakfast. By the way, I would like to share the rolled cold skin and duck blood vermicelli soup bought at the snack street in front of the hotel. The rolled cold skin is delicious, but if you are afraid of spicy food, remember to take the sauerkraut. The stall owner said it is not spicy but it is still a bit spicy, but it is delicious, boyfriend After eating it once, I kept clamoring to eat it again. We have eaten duck blood vermicelli soup in 3 different restaurants this time, and both of us think that although the snack street is relatively simple, it has everything you should have, and the taste is very good.
Overall, the experience is still very good, and I will stay here again next time.

msg:I checked in at noon and turned on the air conditioner for 2 hours. I didn’t feel it. I asked the customer service and said that the outdoor temperature was low and the air conditioner could not be turned on. The local weather showed that it was 28 degrees, but the windows could not be opened. To open it, the customer service needed to send someone over. I was afraid of heat, and I brought a lot of chocolate back from abroad. Without air conditioning, I was worried that it would soften. It was very uncomfortable in such a room temperature. I called three times and went to the front desk to tell me why there was no air conditioning. Everyone felt sick. Not the same, I already feel a little hot in this kind of weather. If you don't turn on the air conditioner, you can only turn on the ventilation, which feels very stuffy. I didn't wait for the air conditioner to come until I went to bed at night. Five-star hotels don't even bother to turn on the air conditioner. I don't care much about the feelings of the guests. The front desk service and luggage storage are very good. The hotel is relatively old, and the sanitation is average. The glass windows are very dirty, and there is no desire to see the city outside. I also chose the hotel based on the good reviews on the Internet, how did I know it would be so bad👎.

There are no tall buildings around the hotel, so the view from the window is very wide. Recommended to stay. If the weather outside is bad, you can also eat in the hotel.

msg:The room rates of Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch have always been ridiculously high, even more expensive than the five-star hotel and Nanjing Metropark International Hotel not far away! ! ! Are the people who choose to stay in Hanting **? Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch is 25 square meters smaller than the ordinary room area of ​​the five-star Nanjing Metropark International Hotel, which is 2 kilometers away from the store. The room area of ​​Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch is only 15 square meters! Each room of Metropark International is more than 40 square meters! Living in a room of Metropark is equivalent to living in two Hanting rooms, but the room rate is cheaper than Hanting! Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch is simply a pigeon cage! Two people living in it will be hit by the corner of the table when turning around! Metropark Hotel is the highest level five-star hotel in Nanjing. It is only 300 to 400 yuan per night when booked on Ctrip. This Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch does not have any interstellar standards. The accommodation conditions do not meet the interstellar standards in all aspects, and the service is super poor! The price of Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch is actually higher than that of the five-star Metropark Hotel! I want to ask, all the guests staying in Hanting Jiuhuashan Branch, don’t you make a comparison? Not to mention breakfast, the breakfast plates of Hanting are not disinfected at all, almost every plate is dirty, and there are greasy stains on the table. How can anyone eat like this? Wake up, all the great gods! Poor at home, rich on the road, when you go out, choose a good and cheap five-star hotel, such as the Grand Metropark Hotel, don't choose the Hanting Jiuhuashan Express Hotel, which has hygiene, service, and rooms like pigeon cages. The price is higher than that of a five-star hotel. This is the private boss setting the price blindly. The service, environment, and experience of the Hanting Jiuhuashan store are far worse than those of similar express hotels, and they are marked at a sky-high price! Look at the super buffet breakfast I ate at Nanjing Metropark, which is all imported ingredients, and the plates are disinfected. Luxurious five-star breakfast enjoyment! See the picture! Compared with the Hanting Jiuhuashan store of Metropark and the street stall, I really don’t know what’s wrong with the current society. Is it because all the guests of Hanting are stupid? Or is it that the private boss of the express hotel is black-hearted? In the peak tourist season, I hope you will choose the Nanjing Metropark Hotel, a top international hotel with super cost-effectiveness, which is very close to the Hanting Jiuhuashan store!

The seams of the wallpaper are open, doesn’t it look nice? Then there is the swimming and fitness area. I wanted to go swimming with my children, but the waiter at the door just lowered his head and played with his mobile phone, focusing on what a customer liked. This is the worst service I have ever experienced in a hotel. In the end, the children felt that the swimming pool It was too small and there were too many people in the pool, so I didn’t swim. Finally, it was breakfast. The waiter stood beside my table. He glanced at the empty plates and empty bowls on the table and then turned around and ignored me. I could only take the initiative to ask the waiter to collect the empty plates. I was really speechless. The only advantage of the overall hotel is its good location. Other hardware facilities and software services are useless. It is the biggest failure of this trip to Nanjing. I will go to Nanjing again, but I will never go to this hotel again.

msg:The hotel facilities are relatively old, and it feels like it was more than ten years ago. Especially when lying on the bed, there is a musty smell at the head of the bed, which is smoky. It was late at night and I didn't look for the front desk again. Fortunately, I only booked for one night, so let's make do with it.
The only uncle at the door served very well and opened the car door. There is no expression on the front desk, and I will not choose this hotel in the future.

The wallpaper is cracked, the bedside table is dusty and cannot be charged, and the curtains of the chairs are not clean at first glance. Why do they deceive consumers like this?

msg:First of all, I went to the hotel recommended by Ctrip. When I arrived at the hotel, I saw that the lobby is quite large. Let me tell you a few points, which are very annoying.
First: If you have friends who like to order takeout, it is recommended to skip this hotel directly. I have stayed in so many hotels, and the only hotel that takes 10 minutes to get takeout. See Figure 3. The highlights are one by one The standard is the takeaway cabinet.
Second: Although the hotel lobby is very large, the service is almost invisible, and I don’t know how the online reviews are so good. The service is meaningless. My girlfriend got out of the car with a big box, and it was as if she hadn’t seen it. I really had no choice but to ignore the urging horn behind me, take it down and put it in the hotel lobby, and then go out to park.
Third: Room facilities and equipment, a lot of stains on the carpet in the aisle and corridor, the wallpaper on the wall of the room is peeling off, I came in and thought it was a guest house, the overall color is yellow and warm, I guess the facilities at the head of the bed are right, it should be from the 1980s Well, I vaguely remember that I also have this set at home.
Fourth: I tried the hotel buffet. The variety was okay. There was lobster in the past, but it was a pity that I didn’t eat lobster. The only detail that can reflect the management and service is that the table was not cleared in time, especially when I couldn’t find paper and put away the plates. Not in time, I knew it was a lobster buffet, I couldn't find the paper, and I didn't clean up the garbage. Many big tables were eaten by several people I didn't know. It was like a garbage dump. I also took it, although I didn't eat lobster. The more I think about it, the more angry I am, I just came to eat lobster, and I didn't see the lobster hair. The grilled sausage that I ate the whole time was not bad.
Fifth: The surrounding traffic is inconvenient, parking is very inconvenient, and there is only one museum next to it. It is particularly troublesome to eat or something, and you have to order takeaway, and when it comes to ordering takeaway, it is scary to think about it. Go downstairs to get takeaway. The milk tea I ordered was iced.
Sixth: The only thing that is better is the night scene. It is a night view of the city. If you have never been to a big city, you can choose it. Try to choose a higher floor.
Oh, by the way, let me add that the TV is rubbish, it reminds me of the old Panda TV in my house.

The equipment is very old, the air conditioner cannot be used alone, and the toilet is not drained well in hot weather (in mid-October), so the room was changed soon. The only advantage is convenience, the nucleic acid test is very close, the museum is next door, and the Ariake Imperial Palace Museum is not far away, all within walking distance.

When checking in, there is almost no one, and the waiters are very empty. Usually, when you check in at a five-star hotel, you should ask about luggage, introduce parking, rooms, breakfast, hotel facilities, hotel restaurants, and guides for sightseeing around. And we didn’t get any of this information. We just kept reviewing our certificates for the epidemic prevention depar**ent. In addition, we only collected the deposit and so on. We didn’t say anything else, and the room card was ignored once it was given. . This rating is too high. 4.4 is about the same. I can lower it for you.

msg:The hotel was only booked for going to Nambo!
Found that the old five-star is really not good... Dim lights! **manner!
Arrived around 2:15pm
To check in, it said that there is no room to wait for 1 hour!
Speechless to the extreme!
Emphasize that it is not 10:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon. The front desk will roll their eyes to the sky, saying that there is only one aunt on the first floor! Does this have anything to do with me? Your aunt asked for leave that day, can I check in at 5 o'clock? !
In the end, I rolled my eyes and upgraded the room type, which is actually a little bit higher!

After swiping the door card of the elevator, the floor is a decoration, but it is useless, and you can go up to the desired floor without the card!

The central air conditioner is basically unable to adjust the room at 25.5 degrees!
Huge thick quilt!
Huge tall pillows! It's crazy!

While waiting for the bus, I saw the Children's Paradise on the first floor and wanted to take my baby to see it! To pass through their restaurant on the 1st floor, the waiter rushed over instantly: "I kept emphasizing that dinner is about to start, don't let me go!" We said, let's go and see the children's playground! Waiter: "Just a few cushions are nothing to look at!" Capitalized speechless! The three of us want to stay in your hotel and bring our children to steal your dinner, can't we? !

In addition, the little brother who helped drive at the door, can you see if I got into the car?
Before I got in, they started to close the door for me. I was thinking for a while... Is this car still an automatic door? How did you start pissing me off...
Turning around, I found that it was my brother who closed the two doors with his cool hands!

In general, the old five-star is really not good...

前台小陳服務態度好，入住很順利，有問題詢問時非常快速耐心。整體入住感覺及值得入住的體驗。

老牌五星酒店（是旅遊局認定的那種五星，不是五鑽）的最大的好處就是房間空間大，服務非常有水準，從前台入住到客房服務，就是一流的服務水準。早餐也是星級標準，中西式都有，樣式多。另外五星級酒店的地理位置都好，視野好。我出門住店的需求是房間大，很在意衞生情況，還有安全，以及酒店的服務質量，這幾個方面下來我發現，老牌五星不會踩坑，性價比很高，也不用操心，所以現在經常這麼篩選酒店。同樣的價格，新酒店除了裝修新以外，其他是達不到我想要的，比如房間大小，衞生，和服務。新酒店在一線城市，800起步吧才能達到我想要的標準。所以考慮我的預算，找旅遊局認定的老五星酒店這個方法很好，屢試不爽。這次維景的體驗我覺得挺棒的

讓我更感動的是樓層大姐的熱情。每次遇到，她都會主動與我打招呼，並詢問我是否需要任何幫助。她的笑容和親切的話語讓我彷彿置身於家中，感受到了温暖和關懷。
總的來説，這次入住讓我對這家酒店留下了深刻的印象。無論是免費升級的服務，還是衞生環境的清潔，以及陳娟大姐的熱情，都體現了酒店對客人的尊重和關懷。我會毫不猶豫地推薦這家酒店給我的朋友和家人，並期待下次再次入住。

帶娃來南博的話是非常適合的，衞生間新裝修了，暖氣很足，服務也很OK。如果單純追求打卡拍照，那這個酒店偏商務務實型，是不太合適。但是帶娃出行很便宜，地鐵口很近，南博以及其他景點也在旁邊。
小童早餐+39，很划算的選擇！

msg:很好的設施和地理位置，衹有一個非常刺眼的問題，就是從外面進入賓館大院不是暢通無阻的，而是設定了彎彎曲曲的阻擋自行車的東西，人行必須繞來繞去地走，如同低級小區門口那樣，和這麼高檔的賓館很不相稱。這也反應出賓館管理思維相當落後，不是首先考慮客人怎麼方便，賓館道路怎麼設定才顯得大氣，衹是在想怎麼方便管控。在門口就想起前幾年瘋控時的小區大門情景。這麼好的酒店，好遺憾

2）交通便利，去紫金山各景點很便捷。離2號線地鐵口也很近，兩站路就可以到大行宮站。另，南京博物院就在隔壁，對逛博物館感興趣的朋友可將此做首先。
3）早餐豐富，床大且舒適，設施雖然已有一些年頭，但依舊體現出高性價比，下次如有機會，會再考慮南京維景。

msg:服務：樓層服務員是個有心人，主要她讓我體會到了三點，第一，第一天因飲用水不夠向服務員多要了兩瓶，次日在打掃房間時她特地給我多備了兩瓶，第二，出門時匆忙忘記關閉勿擾按鍵，特地電話諮詢我是個要打掃，第三，我把護膚品放在洗漱架子上，她怕打碎，特地給我墊了塊毛巾，還給我留了紙條表示未經同意，動了護膚品。其實都不是什麼驚天動地的大事，但是從小事上讓我看到了服務員的細心，也説明她應該還是挺熱愛自己的工作，有這樣的服務員，我相信酒店也會因為這些原因，帶來很多回頭客。這就是細節決定成敗。
特別説明一下服務員的姓名為關曉蘭。在這裏也我真誠的説一聲，謝謝。

1、近，就在隔壁。出門左拐即是。
2、餐飲方便。酒店負一樓就是韓國本家烤肉，還有一家日本料理，馬路對面還有很多特色小店，選擇種類多。
3、交通便利，從南京南站打車20分鐘即到，坐地鐵也很方便，地鐵口離酒店也就五分鐘步行路程。住在酒店清晨打車15分鐘可以在6點半之前看到不收費的明孝陵，騎單車15分鐘可以到富貴山段城牆，沿城牆走不遠就是幽靜的琵琶湖。初夏正是荇菜盛開的時節，美的像一幅油畫。
4、服務好。我去的時候不僅升級了房間，還贈送了早晨的自助餐。謝謝前台的小王姑娘還給我延遲退房到下午兩點。退房時門僮小陳還贈送了我一頂遮陽帽。
非常美好的旅行感受，推薦給大家。

1.酒店設備老舊，無法感受高端酒店的設施。
2.早餐更是讓人失望😔，且不説品種多少，食材質量還不如普通酒店，比如：若讓你閉眼吃一口紫薯、你真猜不出是何物，像是凍了的紫薯蒸後吃一口的感覺，芋頭也是如此，吃了一口無法下嚥。還有像是葱花餅切了小塊，硬的像是昨夜剩的。總之，無法體驗高端酒店的好食品。
3.讓人最不能容忍的是前台冷若冰霜的服務，一位戴眼鏡的女士，視乎認為我當她麪在攜程網上下單有點不高興，就要給我最盡頭的客房，我提出老年人不大方便，可否給離電梯近點的，她説那就要等，我衹能同意，給了一間另一層靠中間的，且有已經收拾好的客房。給我有種店大欺人的感覺。
      而後換到離它不遠的天豐酒店，價格少它近一半，早餐不但品種多，且好吃。
     當今的老年人不差錢，也不是所有的老年人都捨不得消費，關鍵是“物有所值”。我很少點評，之所以寫的詳細，是提醒預訂酒店的人們，理性選擇。

現在很多酒店雖然是5星但是硬件達到，軟件缺不行。維京雖然硬件有點老了點，但是軟件是真的配的上五星。
酒店工作人員的服務意識都真的很好，特別是前台周葉林，入住的時候非常貼心，考慮到我們帶娃提供了很多幫助。
五一的南京人山人海，回到地鐵回酒店的路上涼爽安靜，特別舒服！

2、設施設備齊全；
3、親子房有小童喜歡的玩具和帳篷⛺️，非常nice；
4、特別要提一下這個床，不是那種軟軟軟軟躺下要費勁起來地位那種，老媽表示床很舒服；
5、房間本來的套餐是每天2份，check in的時候的帥哥Mr.Zhou送了我們寶寶一份，太温馨。
6、酒店傍邊就是南博，200m就到了。近真是好處多，對面也有很多吃飯的店家；還有7-Eleven,便利啊！
7、酒店出門右轉➡️200m地鐵2號線明故宮站；
總之，這次選的酒店超讚！

2）所有工作人員都積極主動，禮貌有度，服務態度非常好。

前台小陸luffy服務態度超級好，很貼心給我們免費升級了行政套房，很驚喜。36樓視野太棒了，整個南京都可以看到。
房間設施不用説，五星級標準。點餐送到房間來，服務超讚。打掃時還給我們把衣服疊好。
還有延遲退房，服務真的太到位。可惜沒有拍照片，衹有發給朋友的小視頻裏截圖。。
不愧是南京老牌五星酒店！

下次來南京我還要住維景！！！朋友來我也推薦！！

酒店交通算便利，地鐵站離得不遠，南京南打車過來要42rmb。
設施：酒店真的比較老了，浴室淋雨門都關不上… 到處都是生銹的痕跡，就顯得看着比較臟，所以對衞生的分數也就不好評判了…天花板也有斑塊裂紋，感覺岌岌可危要掉🙈🙈🙈

服務：辦理入退房的服務員都非常有禮貌，效率也很高，前台小王服務態度非常好。禮賓台寄存行李的小哥門也很nice，下車也主動幫忙拿了行李箱。服務這塊做的很到位。

唯一減分就是設施項了！！ 真的可以翻新翻新了，畢竟一晚價格500rmb的酒店，印象分一下子拉胯了，不會選擇再入住🙈🙈

msg:總結：大概是南京天花板級別的酒店，沒有之一，老牌涉外酒店確實頂。

一個細節，空調起碼距今十年，97年開業的酒店，至今空調老當益壯，製冷效果一流，早年有堆很多好料是肯定的。


1⃣️地段：座標地段一流，毗鄰明孝陵等等，大部分景點出門十五分鐘內能到，除了晚上不大好點外賣之外沒有任何毛病。


2⃣️服務：私以為傳統酒店更傾向於親和的邊界感，但是各種服務又拿捏得剛剛好，例如説晚上六點之前確定入住時間，在例如説絕大多數客房服務二十分鐘內來人，哪怕是晚上九點多，適合我這種i人。

尤其是前台的陸青老師，入住體驗相當不錯。

另外保潔王艷華姨姨也超棒的，見人三分笑，又熱心，讓人看着就開心。


3⃣️房間設施：不吹不黑，今年住過的所有酒店同價位乃至雙倍價位採光最佳，更偏向於低色温暖色調燈光，無主燈設計裏相對採光好的，所以久住舒適感也到位。

順便説一句，順手掂了一下水壺，很有質感，搜了同款，沒搜到，可能酒店內供。浴鹽挺好用的，想再回去要幾包的程度。

酒店空調説不上頂尖，但是十幾年了還老當益壯的空調有點噪聲我也理解，但真的這個價位沒得挑了。

4⃣️客餐服務：點了餛飩，對的起價格，而且有在刻意模仿南京路邊味道。

優點是模仿的很到位，至少胡椒粉量足，缺點是太到位了，誰家泡泡餛飩這麼多肉啊，而且捏的太緊了，不好熟，建議換個餛飩皮供應商，不然皮粘牙的問題改不了。

5⃣️沖就完了，誰不住我都會難過的。

唯一覺得需要改進的是，智能馬桶很多按鍵都失靈了，酒店可以更換一下。
