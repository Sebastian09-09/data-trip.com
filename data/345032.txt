msg:The stay at the hotel was good. The hotel facilities are old but in good shape. The location is perfect for people who cross to and from HK. There are a lot of good places nearby to enjoy a good time, dinner, and shopping. Also, the hotel offers free parking. The amenities are good quality and plenty of them, which is very weird in those times of savings from big Hotel chains. Therefore I enjoy the amenities of this hotel. 
The only annoying thing was the cleaning service crew. They started to pressure me at 11 AM (checkout is at 12 pm), but they knocked on the door insistently, and after I went out, somebody reached me to ask me if the room was empty. It is a sincerely very uncomfortable sense. I prefer another hotel that respects those details.
Referring to shower, the curtain was dirty and old, need to pay more attention to cleaning process.

The club floor Horizon Lounge seems newly renovated and the staff was excellent. Special kudos goes out to Maria Liao who was at the front desk during check-in and did a superb job checking me in and making sure all my needs were met. There are more modern hotels for sure in Shenzhen but as a traveller of going back and forth between Shenzhen and Hong Kong this is still the Grand Dame of hotels to stay!

Tried to call room service and waited for half an hour after calling many times to be told that there was no food. Eventually calling the manager who apologized and arranged a sandwich.

Went to the rooftop bar and the barman explained that all of the staff were brand new and mostly very young, only 2 people on the hotel spoke English and he was one of them. He has only been there for 2 weeks himself and explained that the hotel was in chaos since reopening. He did provide a good service

There are different types of cuisine that you can try. Using the metro station, you can reach the hotel on line 1, exit E1 or E2. The room is excellent; the bathtub is awesome. There is a rooftop bar on the 31st floor. You can enjoy your drinks and food by looking at the fantastic view of Shenzhen and Hongkong. 
The pool is clean, and so does the gym. There are saunas and a jacuzzi as well. 
I will surely come back to this hotel.

Breakfast spread is decent but felt quite cheap and below par for international cuisine, Luckily the Chinese food options are still great and flavorful (thank you chef for the Changfen! Egg Benedict should change name and/or recipe please…)

msg:The service at this Shangri La was outstanding, so much so, that I extended my trip, twice!

The facilities and rooms are beautifully maintained, clean and inviting. After a stressful journey, I felt calm on arriving to the room and welcomed the chance to relax in comfort.

The team at the Shangri La are friendly and easy to talk to. I could not ask for better hospitality. I am grateful for the kind advice given. The team know the area well and when asked with unique queries went well out of their way to provide clear, well written and thoughtful answers. I am shocked at how much they helped strengthen the experience of seeing Shenzhen and settling into the community.

Inside the hotel are glamorous hallways, beautifully artistic deserts, elaborate shop displays and social areas such as the bar, coffee shop and buffet. There’s plenty to do and a charming gym and pool to work out in.

In the evening you can see the immaculately clean windows being maintained and with smiles too! What a friendly and warm place to stay.

I highly recommend the Shangri La, in Shenzhen.

On a side note, I must give a HUGE thank you to Jesse who was especially friendly from arrival. Jesse helped send a postcard to my nephew and made his day! Thank you so much, Jesse, it was lovely to meet you and your amazing team.

msg:I want to give them a good review. I came here because of the word Shangri-La. After reading the reviews, I felt that the breakfast was good, so I specially added 200 yuan for breakfast. It is an old five-star hotel, but the facilities in all aspects cannot keep up with the times. To be honest, it can reach the stars. , as soon as you enter the room, it is old and shabby, the ceiling of the corridor is heavy on your head, the carpet is old and dirty, the door is narrow and old, the plug of the hair dryer in the bathroom is broken, and the mineral water is so cold that I dare not drink it. You still need to pay a 500 deposit to check in. What can you do about a dilapidated room? Maybe it's because there is a bottle of wine in the room, but I don't drink it and put it in a safe place. I just put it on the table. It feels like touching porcelain. Otherwise, if you are not careful, the five hundred will be gone. And that The switches are only a few years old. It can be concluded that this hotel was almost the same in 2004, and it cannot be renovated in 2014. I reluctantly stayed and put all my hope on breakfast. I woke up early with my son. When I went to the restaurant, I could see nothing around. There were a few frozen snacks and a few steamed breads and eggs. I immediately lost my appetite. Express Hotel It's not that bad. I was really disappointed in an instant. Isn't this fooling the customers like they are fools? The waiter said that the restaurant is under renovation and this place is temporary. Isn't there a standard five-star breakfast? Please ask the relevant departments to check carefully. Those reviews are fake. You will understand when you look at the picture above. I would like to thank Ctrip for its help. It is a trustworthy platform, but we need to review these hotel false information.

(In addition to not preparing a swimming cap, you need to buy a swimming cap if you fall into the water)
In fact, all the staff in all depar**ents are very polite.

The lobby attendant is also very attentive. After checking in, he took the initiative to send us to the elevator and pressed the elevator. It has 5-star service, but the room is a bit disappointing. If it were in the 80s or early 90s, this type of room would be good, but now it is 2024, it feels a bit Out! ￼

This time, considering the convenience of business travel, I chose the Shangri-La Hotel, which is located next to the Luohu Port and Shenzhen Railway Station. The experience of staying here is very good, with a wide view. Outside the window is the large green mountain view of the Luohu Port and the New Territories of Hong Kong. Although the furniture in the room is a little old, it is well maintained, the bedding is comfortable, the air conditioning is powerful, the bathroom is clean, and the shower is full of water. In addition to the welcome fruit plate, the afternoon tea in the executive lounge, the happy hours in the evening, and the buffet breakfast are all very good 👍. I especially want to praise the high level of the hotel staff. During the stay, the front desk customer service, executive lounge customer service, leisure club customer service, room cleaners, and even the waiters in the lobby bakery were patient, meticulous and thoughtful. The next morning, because I wanted to do a fitness and swim before checking out, the room service operator ROSE also specially helped me apply for a check-out at 2 pm, so that I could have plenty of time to enjoy the hotel facilities. It was really considerate! This time, I once again experienced the classic high-quality service of Shangri-La, and I will definitely stay here again when I come to Shenzhen in the future!

The water is very big, it is very comfortable to wash, and there is something to soak in. It happened to be a 4-day mountain climbing in HK, and I needed a comfortable hot bath. The location is also very good, just outside the port. The service attitude of the guys in the lobby, the concierge, and the room service is very good, and the requests are responded to quickly; especially the guy in the concierge is tall and strong, he picked up my 15kg mountaineering bag at once, and helped to deliver it to the room and put it in place. Please praise the hotel if you see it.

The afternoon tea was simple pastries which were not bad at all. The price/performance ratio was high and the service attitude was also ok. It was worth it! Fulin is right opposite the window view.

Whether it is the remote-controlled curtains or the Bose speakers, they all show the style of an old five-star hotel. The staff's responsive service attitude is very valuable! The toiletries and soaps in the rooms are all produced by L'Occitane, which is very outstanding. The breakfast is rich, and there is a cart to push the freshly baked food to the table for diners to taste, which is warm and delicious. The staff in the executive lounge are very dedicated, and the comprehensive service makes the guests feel like spring breeze, but the food is a bit monotonous. If the ingredients of happy hour can be enriched and the quality can be improved, it will be more perfect. In short, all the experiences are worth the room price, and I will definitely come again next time.

We don’t have to think in advance about what time to get on the bus and go back at night. As long as we can get to Luohu before twelve o’clock. Just go outside and walk to the hotel in five minutes. There are road signs along the way, which is very convenient.
We returned to the hotel to check in in the evening. Mandy and Witter, who were on duty, were very enthusiastic in their service. They also upgraded the room to a higher floor and gave us two complimentary breakfasts. This made us fortunate to experience Shangri-La's breakfast. Breakfast is on the second floor. The variety is very rich. There will also be waiters pushing a trolley to deliver freshly made small bowls of wonton noodles from table to table. Good reviews!

Facilities: Although it is a hotel that has been open for a long time, it inevitably begins to expose the shortcomings of the early design, such as the low height of the room and the shared bathroom, shower and bathtub. However, it is well maintained and the facilities accessible in the room are all normal. There is no moldy area, which is rare for most older hotels. This shows that Luohu Shangri-La is diligent in daily maintenance.

This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. I believe we will meet again in the future!

The young front desk staff was nice, helpful, and friendly. It's a pity that the housekeeping staff at the back up had a numb attitude! First, I checked up at 2:15 and went to the room. When I entered the room, I saw the aunt in charge of the room decorating the room. Then at 4pm, I went to the front desk to ask housekeeping to replenish supplies and evening turn down service before 6:00. I learned that when I returned to the room at 7pm, there was no service at all in the room. When I called to follow up, the housekeeping aunt was there. I got to the room at 7:15, looking very impatient. In short, the housekeeping aunt always arranges services when the guests are present, completely disturbing the guests' use of the room! It's really strange that Shangri La or other hotel groups of the same level have never tried this kind of situation.

I would like to express special appreciation to the lady at the Lobby Lounge staff who served afternoon tea. She was so friendly and attentive! Reception staff are also nice.

2) Facilities:
Dated and old-fashioned, but overall well maintained and clean.

3) Food:
A surprise on the New Year’s afternoon tea table, the taste is average and it’s perfect for check-in!
Although the breakfast buffet has a variety of choices, most of them are not in good taste and are very ordinary, not up to Shangri-La standards!

4) Location:
Luohu Station. But I don’t know that the entrance and exit are barrier free access.

In addition, Shenzhen Railway Station is less than 200 meters away on foot. The hotel has a strong New Year a**osphere. The second floor offers a variety of Chinese and Western food options, especially the morning tea at Shang Palace is very delicious. The children's play area on the fifth floor has a variety of projects, including an outdoor swimming pool, indoor gym, sauna, and archery slide. The top 31st floor overlooks the entire Luohu District.

The hotel has a strategic location, a gorgeous lobby, and rooms with sunny views. But the hotel is indeed a bit old, and the facilities in the room are not modern enough. There is no safe, no shoehorn, and disposable slippers without covers. I still hope the hotel management can pay attention to improving these details.

msg:I often stayed at this hotel 20 years ago, and my experience this time was jaw-dropping:
•The facilities are extremely outdated and the traces of sewage on the bathroom ceiling have not been dealt with.
•The bathtub floor drain cover cannot be pulled up to drain water, making it completely unusable
•There is no socket for boiling a kettle at the bar, so we have to move it to the writing table for makeshift use.
•The ceiling of the elevator hall is so high that you can touch it with your hands, which is very depressing. This is the first time I have seen such an embarrassing situation in a star-rated hotel.
•The sound insulation of the room is extremely poor, and the sound of rain, toilet flushing, and bathtub draining in the next room can be clearly heard
•It’s like a love hotel. From 2 to 3 o’clock in the morning, the noise is endless. I strongly question the hotel’s check-in management.
•Many podium businesses have been closed down. It’s suffocating and disappointing that the Shangri-La hotel brand has fallen to this level.

msg:The hotel decoration is old and the bathroom shower is an old flat bathtub. I heard a rumbling sound every few minutes when I went to bed at night. I thought it was the subway or high-speed train. Later I figured out that it was because the room I was given was next to the elevator, so it was very noisy and I couldn't sleep. In addition, it is a common problem in Shangri-La that the sensor lights in the cloakrooms will light up inexplicably at night. As soon as I checked in and entered the room, a waiter knocked on the door and asked me to apply insecticide. This is very strange. It cannot be done during cleaning. Does it have to be done after the guest checks in? The breakfast is quite rich (compared to other hotels in the same area). In short, the experience is very poor, and I probably won't choose it again.

I asked the waiter at the bar next to me, but his attitude was very bad. He just said that it was not our responsibility and then left. I can't believe the attitude of the waiters at this hotel. The reason for borrowing a power bank was also because the hotel did not provide suitable charging cables at that time. The service attitude is so bad! Will not be returning. The price, the old facilities and the poor service are incredible!

The plug socket in the bathroom is unused and it's hard to blow your hair. At that time, there was only a hair dryer by the bed, and there was no comb provided near the bathroom. I will not stay here again. The only advantage is that it is close to the port.

The only drawback is the different trea**ent of Chinese and foreign guests. My colleague and I both placed orders with Ctrip, and my colleague was a foreigner. We were arranged to have a fruit plate on the 20th floor or above every day. I was arranged to be on the 11th floor and asked if it was possible to stay on a higher floor. The front desk said there were no rooms and said they would give me a welcome fruit.
The attitude of the restaurant waiters and concierge is quite good. Even so, I won't choose this hotel next time. Bye👋
I hope this article can help hotel leaders see why Chinese people bully Chinese people? !

I just simply said that my wife’s birthday is tomorrow. Before I checked out, they actually sent me a birthday cake. It adds more color to the hotel. I am very satisfied with the hotel overall. The breakfast has Japanese, Chinese and Western options. I am also very satisfied with the taste. It should be considered the best breakfast in a hotel in Shenzhen for the time being. It is a pity that I visited the swimming pool when I left. It turned out that the swimming pool is very beautiful. I will definitely bring my children back next time. There are so many advantages to staying here. The disadvantages are that I really can't imagine going to the hotel. It takes about 5 minutes to reach Luohu Railway Station at a normal pace. It's so convenient. It doesn't take 1 minute to wash off the subway station. The air-conditioning is cold enough to take a shower. The water temperature and power are very good.

The front desk made several calls to confirm and they were told that it could be used on the fifth floor. However, I went to the fifth and fifth floors the next day.

msg:1. The environmental facilities are relatively old, but the location is very convenient and the transportation is convenient.
Room 1214, where 2 stayed, actually had a plumbing equipment room. It was dark and the key was that you could still get a phone call. You had to use a chair to block your diaphragm when sleeping at night.
3. It’s hard to get through the room service call after 10pm.

Excellent location, other than average

It’s raining heavily in Shenzhen. Off-topic. Fanlou’s double skin milk is delicious🤤

It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel, giving people a home away from home experience. My mother was allowed to check in early and check out late, and it also came with breakfast. Special praise for Elva and Bill at the front desk and Mike and Leo at the swimming and fitness center. Their service is warm and thoughtful, and my mother praised them full of praise.

msg:On a typhoon day, when I came out of Luohu Port, I saw a hotel on the sign and checked in quickly. I didn't expect it to be a treasure hotel. There are also many varieties to choose from for breakfast. The Supo pork in the Chinese restaurant is super delicious! Really recommend, worth a try.
Hygiene: Very clean. Carpets are the easiest place to hide dirt and evil, but the carpets in the room look like they have been carefully vacuumed.

Facilities: It is a long-established five-star hotel that has been open for about 30 years. However, there are no traces of time from the room equipment (shower, bathtub, toilet). It is probably that it has been replaced, or it has been carefully maintained.

Service: The overall service attitude is very good, whether it is luggage storage, restaurants, or check-in, especially Steven at the concierge, I really have to praise him!

Environment: The decoration style is European-style. Although it is not the minimalist style that is currently popular, it was decorated decades ago, which reflects its luxury several years ago. It’s also good to experience the aesthetics of the older generation. It's right next to the port, and the location is really good. In short, I will still choose this hotel next time I go to Hong Kong!

When we checked in, the front desk told us that the decoration was ready, but when we entered the room, we were a little disappointed to see that there was no decoration at all. Afterwards, we went out to the hotel lobby The waiters congratulated us and asked if our room is satisfactory? Later we said that the room was not furnished, and then we went out to the street.
They all went back to the room. Unexpectedly, the room is very beautifully decorated. Thank you, the waiter in the lobby has a very good attitude👍🏻

I checked in late at Shang Palace. Normally, other hotels such as Simou Hotel or Wenmou Oriental Hotel will upgrade the room type when I check in for the first time or later. In the case of registration, Kowloon Shangri-La will have welcome tea and seasonal fruits to welcome guests. Hong Kong Shangri-La will have a manager to introduce welcome fruit and chocolate in the room. But Shenzhen Shangri-La did not prepare anything 🤨The only thing I can praise is the warm hospitality of the F&B waiters, and the concierge depar**ent is eager to help the elderly connect to Wifi

The food area is less than the coffee shop and has fewer choices, but it is better than less people and clean food concentration, and the room can be delayed room until 4 o'clock

The swimming pool on 5/F is open, and the locker room has a sauna, STEAM bath, hot and cold soaking bath, and the fitness room is being renovated and is temporarily moved to the ground floor.
The room has fruit, bath salt, bathtub and shower. But there is no floor lamp for lighting, which is not very convenient
MINIBAR has 3-4 types of tea bags, the hot water in the drinking kettle is ready, and I feel thoughtful

Arrived at around 12:00, check-in can be arranged. High flexibility.
At the back door of the hotel, you can choose different subway entrances from Luohu South or Renmin South, which is convenient for traveling on different routes

The room is not soundproof, and someone coughing in the corridor can be heard clearly. Fortunately, I and the front desk asked for a quiet room, the room at the back of the corridor. If it's in a room next to the elevator, I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep. The hotel's elevator movement is too loud, a bit exaggerated.
The hotel's breakfast is okay, but unfortunately there is no cake to eat

The hotel should put a notice outside the dining room door saying that diners are not allowed to wear pajamas and bathrobes in the dining room. Nowadays, many people are choosing vegetarian meals, meals without onions, garlic, and leeks. I think hotels should provide more such options. This is a general trend. The hotel might as well go to the Qingchun Pumen vegetarian restaurant in the Wanxiang Tiandi shopping mall to get directions. They make very ordinary ingredients very delicious.

They gave me a hotel that was not only close to the elevator, but also right on the stairs, and also had a secret door. The room, this eleven, Ctrip gave too many scares, there are problems in every place, and the performance is really getting worse.

Thumbs up to the hotel’s swimming pool lifeguards, they are very responsible. I accidentally stayed with the same person for two nights. They were both responsible and very nice. The facilities are indeed old. In addition, the aunt who cleans the room is very nice. I don’t even know her name. It's just a moment when I'm touched

The negative reviews about check-in were very bad, including the duty manager, whose attitude was not very good, and there was a long queue for check-in even though there were more than 11 people. Many people complained, and no chairs were provided for accompanying family members. , there is not even a public chair in the lobby, and the children are tired and can only sit on the suitcases. The Eleven Hotel does not have more staff during the busiest season. It is really a very bad experience. I have stayed in many Shangri-La places, and this is the worst one. one

Her professionalism and high emotional intelligence are reflected in every look and every detail. When we met for the second time, she remembered my last name exactly like an old friend, which was so touching. In fact, every service staff we came into contact with in Shangri-La was very nice⋯⋯
Shenzhen Shangri-La is the best choice for reunion with relatives at Luohu Port. We were a little hesitant before, but we finally found out that after exiting the customs at Luohu Port, we can reach the hotel within a few steps, which made our daughter who is studying at the University of Hong Kong feel at home immediately. And travel is also very convenient. After two days of staying, we adjusted to the executive suite. The arrangement of the Shangri-La executive suite is very friendly, and it is more homely than a family living in two rooms.
The decoration style with a sense of age has not affected our love for Shangri-La at all. After all, the environment, service, meals and the quality of sleep we need most have given the best satisfaction.

I deliberately chose the Shangri-La Hotel in Shenzhen near the port to stay for one night. The hotel lobby is full of style, the hotel rooms are clean and tidy, and it is very comfortable to live in. It’s my first time in Shenzhen, and I’m not familiar with life. I’m very grateful to the hotel service ambassador, Manager Liu Ronglin, who patiently and tirelessly introduced good places to eat and drink near the hotel. I feel like I’m at home. It’s so heartwarming!

I slept until midnight and found that the big bed room turned out to be two single beds. Thinking that I am too tired and have to drive tomorrow morning, I want to wash my face and put on makeup when I wake up in the morning, and I don't even have a makeup mirror. There is a layer of dust on the closet. I don't know if it has been cleaned for hundreds of years. I have lived in the most rubbish Shangri-La.

msg:After going around, I still chose Shangri-La. During the Spring Festival, many hotels increased their prices, but Shangri-La's prices remained stable. The ratings on the Internet are obviously low, which may be related to the facilities of such an old hotel, but from the perspective of service quality, hotel location, and overall staying experience, Shangri-La's ratings are definitely underestimated. The room facilities are definitely not new or modern, but the overall maintenance is good, and it can be seen that the facilities were good when they were first built. The room faces the Luohu port, and the night view is very good, which also allows the children to feel the a**osphere of the port. The only dissatisfaction is the entrance and exit passage of the garage, which is very narrow. The scratches when leaving the garage also made me, an old driver, experience the challenge of entering and exiting the old garage, and I also remind friends who drive to be careful.

There is a very good seafood restaurant "No. 79 Fishing Boat" next to it, which is worth a try. In addition, Shenzhen's most popular Cantonese cuisine "Fan Lou" is an 8-minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is very clean, and a piece of fruit is served as soon as you enter the room, which is quite satisfactory for the New Year. The attitude of the girls at the front desk and reception desk is very good, and they will stay again next time.

But when I actually lived in it, I found that the setting is really very ordinary, even outdated. I feel that many hotel facilities with a price of more than 300 will be much better. Of course, although the facilities are average, the service is really good, especially the lobby manager, who will take the initiative to greet you and is very kind! Special thanks to Rock and Bill, especially Rock, for providing me with a lot of convenience and caring!

Just about to sleep for 10 minutes, another waiter desperately rang the doorbell and came to deliver the quilt. I was so angry that I didn't feel sleepy at all.

Shangri-La is on this level. too poor.

First of all, the front desk customer service delia and twitter patiently answered my questions. I checked in in the early morning. I hope I can sleep later the next day. I want to check out late. Thank you two for helping me apply to meet my requirements.

When we checked in, we also gave welcome fruit, which was a pleasant surprise and thoughtful. Every corner of the hotel is clean and tidy. The service staff greet each other and are very kind.

The breakfast is not bad, the variety is OK, there are many choices, the viewing seat with less people sitting, quiet and comfortable.

In a small holiday, you can actually choose a hotel to relax. Although you don't do anything, the comfortable environment can let your mind empty for a while, and will come again next time.

When I saw the exterior of the hotel, I knew there might be no shower. As expected, there was only a bathtub when entering the door. The bathroom accessories are also ordinary. I counted four Hong Kong sockets in the room, which caused the charging port to be tense at night.

Since we didn’t remove the DND button when we went out during the day, we didn’t come back until 10:00 p.m. to let the waiter clean the room. The response was also very fast, so the service was given high marks.

If you go to Hong Kong from Luohu, you can live here~

Location: Superb. Opposite the railway station, 200 meters from the No. 9 subway station, the railway station business district, not far from the Mixc City and Litchi Park;
Environment: Opened for many years, it is unexpected that the environmental sanitation facilities are so well maintained, the warm color design style, the heritage of Shangri-La still exists, and the art in the public area, including the murals, shows the oriental charm everywhere;
Rooms: The rooms are small in size. But although the sparrow is small and complete, of course, the space has also been well used. The most attractive places for me are the electric curtains, the jogging map is hung on the wooden door of the shower room, there are many choices of tea bags, the configuration of charging holes and three charging lines are very convenient, and the sound insulation effect is very good. Dissatisfied with the suggestion: the room air conditioner cannot Set warm air. However, the eldest sister in the guest room sent a heater to solve the problem; the TV station has less than 40 stations; there is no separate shower room, only a bathtub separated by a shower curtain, which is inconvenient to take a bath and easily causes water to overflow to the ground;
Catering: The breakfast is rich and tastes good, the functional areas are reasonably distributed, and there are many innovative food practices. The open kitchen satisfies the visual and taste experience of diners, and the service is timely. Especially the on-site production of rice rolls is very delicious.
Service: room, catering, front desk service is great, especially the service of front desk Bill, Nina, concierge Ives.

This year happens to be the 50th anniversary of Shangri-La Hotel Group. You can feel the high-quality service from Shangri-La as soon as you enter the door. Because it is the anniversary, I contacted the hotel in advance and expressed my hope for a late check-out. After communication, the hotel said that a late check-out is possible. Around 15.00, but after arriving at the front desk, the front desk staff Mrs. Chang said that because it was an anniversary, she took the initiative to upgrade my room type and arranged the room for me. Thank you very much to Shangri-La Hotel. Talking about the hotel, the location is excellent. It is within a 20-minute walk from Luohu Railway Station, Guomao Business District, Dongmen Business District, and Vientiane City. In terms of room types, except for the entrance, which is relatively residential, other locations are more utilized. good. The mattress is soft, the lighting is good, and the facilities in the room are complete. The bathroom is basically separated from wet and dry. It is also equipped with high-quality slippers, all with logos. Unlike the ordinary slippers that are usually provided in hotels, the toiletries are all from Shangri-La. The private brand has a refreshing mint flavor. Also, if you order a takeaway late-night snack at night, you don’t need to go downstairs to get it yourself. The hotel will provide a robot to deliver it directly to the room, which is very suitable for patients with "cancer dependence". The hotel's epidemic prevention is also very good. No matter which door you come in from, there will be personnel on duty to guard you, and you will be asked to show your health code. This not only ensures the hotel's own prevention and control management, but also ensures the safety of guests staying at the hotel. What impressed me most this time was the attitude and quality of the Shangri-La Hotel’s service. Because you need a paper bag when you check out, it took less than 3 minutes from calling the room to getting the paper bag. The aunt who delivered it was also very considerate, because I was honest today. It is the coldest day since the beginning of winter in Shenzhen. My aunt thoughtfully reminded me that it is very cold outside and raining. She thoughtfully reminded me that it is very cold outside and I need to wear more clothes. If you don’t bring an umbrella, she can also provide one. I was in such a hurry that I didn't have time to ask him his name. She was the aunt in charge of the service on the 18th floor. Furthermore, since it is the second anniversary, I am very grateful for GRO June's handwritten letter. I have received blessings from you and all the front office staff, and I wish you all the best. What is also more impressive is the calendar in the room. Guests who like the culture of Shangri-La Hotel Group can take a look. As the calendar says, Shangri-La is not only a paradise that can be found on the map, but also represents a beautiful moment. If the hotel sees this comment [laughing] I wonder if you can tell me how to purchase the 2022 calendar, I would like to buy it. The only drawback is that the hair dryer provided in the room does not fit the socket in the bathroom. It can only be used outside, but not in the bathroom. I hope the hotel can pay attention to this small detail. All in all, this was a very good stay experience. I will definitely choose to stay at Shangri-La Hotel Shenzhen again. It is worth everyone's choice.

msg:Shenzhen Shangri-La, facing the Luohu port, has been in business for 29 years and can be regarded as a group of witnesses of China's reform and opening up at the same time. Of course, while keeping up with the pace of Shenzhen and sharing the dividends of reform and opening up, Shenzhen Shangri-La must have had a long period of brilliance. However, as luxury hotels are built more and more, and the more they are built, the more advanced they are, the hardware flaws of Shenzhen Shangri-La can undoubtedly be penetrated at a glance: small rooms, aging facilities, unreasonable elevator settings, etc... However, it is precisely because of these innate characteristics. Shangri-La, Shenzhen, has kept up with its inferiority and made up for it with diligence, excellent service, delicious dishes, refined management and high cost performance, maintaining its vigorous vitality and good reputation. It is really commendable and quite Not easy! What was particularly impressive was William Xiao, the guest service manager in the front hall. He was dedicated to his work and responded immediately. It can be said that he is wholeheartedly caring and serving customers. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks!

This time, because my family’s eye surgery in Shenzhen took longer than expected, I tried to choose Shangri-La Hotel. I arrived late to check in and I was very tired, but the polite smiles of the staff at the epidemic prevention desk and the warm and considerate service of Martin Ding on the front desk alleviated my headaches a lot. The layout of the room is very reasonable, there is also a good desk, the view is very good and very quiet. It is worth noting that the bedding is very clean and there is no smell at all, the bathroom should have not been renovated for a long time, and the bathtub and wash basin are completely free of mildew. Personally think this hotel is very cost-effective, and I will definitely choose it next time if I need it

I also called Ctrip before, hoping to remind the hotel to pay attention to the investigation, but so far I have not received any response from either party. I don’t know if anyone in other accommodations has this situation. We were on a business trip for 3 people and two rooms on different floors started to itch on the night of check-in. There were different degrees of itchy packages similar to insect bites. The next day, it started to get worse during the day. One of them went to the hospital after returning and said it was an insect bite. Sexual allergies. I couldn't help but scratched it. Now it is all acne marks but it doesn't itch anymore. The last one is serious. The one who has been applying the medicine to this day is still itchy (18 days).
Excluding the previous night’s hotel and other dining and other places (friends who do not stay in the hotel basically have traveled in the places we have been, including renting a car and doing it all right) have not been to the grass, greenery, woods and so on.

msg:I stayed in this room 2322. The lobby is the same as always in Shangri-La style, and the young lady who checks in is very professional. I took the room card and went to the elevator, the old card-type elevator, and then started my slot. The door to the room is old, but it's a bit broken. After the card was inserted, there was a faint musty smell. The room facilities are old and a huge bed. The room air conditioner has been turned on at 22 degrees and there is a creaking sound. After all, the price was less than 600, and there was no idea at the time. Due to the sound of the air conditioner, it was not very hot in Shenzhen these days, so I turned off the air conditioner and got into the big bed. The big bed is made up of two beds, and there is a ditch in the middle, so you can sleep alone. When I touched the quilt, it was damp, not dry, the air conditioner was not turned on, and I took a shower (shower on the tub) and fell asleep without the quilt. Then the next night, the room was a bit hot, and I turned on the air conditioner, put on headphones and covered my quilt to sleep. I woke up in the morning and found that there were several bumps on my legs. Since it was not itchy or painful, I didn't take it seriously. When I checked out more than 11 years ago, I suddenly felt itchy. At first sight, the pimple became a piece. I don't know if it was an insect bite or eczema. I immediately contacted the service staff in the lobby, but my car arrived at the airport ten minutes later and left before the corresponding staff. Called 12345 in the car and complained to the hotel after their guidance. As soon as the complaint was over, the hotel called. The person in charge had something just now and was very polite when he contacted me. I finished talking to him, and his reply was very sincere. I have no problem with Shangri-La's service, but I am really not satisfied with the sanitation and facilities. To be honest, this hotel is up to four stars from the room alone.

If you don’t open the window and don’t boil the kettle, you can count as a five-star hotel room?
After setting down the trip, I immediately followed the guide and went to the second floor for a snack buffet. The restaurant was fighting for the hotel's face and it was very comfortable. There are pictures, in fact, check-in that day is for your birthday in the evening.
The room is indeed an old hotel. I am still not satisfied with not opening the window, but when I think about going out later, I find it bothersome not to sign the agreement with them. In fact, it can be done like many hotels to open the window half-slit, which is too much. What registration code does the hotel have to scan? Will it be possible to reveal the personal information of the guest who has stayed in the hotel throughout the trip? The other five stars are standard face recognition and then green code travel is fine.
It was only in the evening that the kettle was not being boiled, and the waiter smiled and brought it to me. Do I really drink free drinks from the refrigerator? They are too confident.
The scores are all earned by the restaurant, and the gym equipment is iron-colored and black, and it can't win the praise. Had to see the goldfish pond, which was also dirty.

The veteran five-star a**osphere is strong, especially for the cleaning aunt on the 15th floor this time, I greet warmly when I go in and out, and the room is cleaned seriously and responsible. Of course, the attitude of the pretty girl at the front desk is also very enthusiastic, overall very satisfied, and will continue to stay next time on business trip.
Finally, a suggestion: It would be better if the breakfast price is affordable.

3.入住要繳500元按金，退房後當天傍晚才能到微信或付款寶，國外遊客一時間沒有現金或付款寶等，那就十分不便。此做法落後其它酒店幾十年。
4．大堂連張沙發都沒有，想發條訊息衹能站着發，一家人check in，一家陪站。
5.我的大床房，宣稱有30㎡，實質目測最多20㎡。
6.花近700元住這樣的酒店，性價比實在太低！

5樓泳池有沖氣滑梯，水深0.9-1.1-1.3，小孩玩得非常高興。
總的來説性價比一般，就是帶着小孩選擇大品牌不用過於擔心衞生問題。

房間看了評價有心裏準備，馬桶蓋板沒有阻尼哐哐響，淋浴在浴缸上，廁所隔音也不咋地。
泳池不大，水温合適，晚上八點還暖和着，還有好多免費使用的充氣玩具，充氣滑梯也有，小孩喜歡瘋了，出去玩都沒心思

服務：相對比酒店各個業務服務算還行吧
總體就是根本不知道五星級酒店誰給定位的，臟亂差一點兒不誇張，這種淡季沒有早餐還要八百多一晚實在是太差了，酒店電話還是沒有免提的老式的，洗漱台就更一言難盡處處不合理，現在五星級酒店想淋浴洗澡還要站在老式浴缸裏，拖鞋一穿就破了真的除了名字和酒店佔地面積大一些真心不如如家七天連鎖店，房卡開門都特別難

在這個特殊的時刻，Maria 的團隊展現了專業精神和同情心。謝謝他們在我們最困難的時刻伸出援手。如果有機會，我們一定會推薦深圳香格里拉酒店給親朋好友，再次感謝他們的幫助！

1.車地庫到酒店大堂沒電梯，行李自己從樓梯抬上去的（行李很多，確實有點困難）
2.向禮賓部要求了三次，要求把車輛訊息錄入酒店系統，一直未錄入，導致每次出入都要顯示收費，還得找酒店工作人員手動錄入車輛訊息後才能放行。
3.最後也是最無法理解的事情，晚上十二點，客人已經入睡的情況下，酒店客服打電話到房間，詢問下一天的早上是否需要早餐（我們預訂的是第一天酒店吃早餐，第二天吃深圳小吃店的早餐）

msg:非常糟糕的居住體驗，大家要慎選！10月1日下午約2:20左右到達酒店前台辦理3間房入住，接待人員在沒有與我確認的情況下分別給了我10樓2間走廊盡頭的2間尾房、以及11樓盡頭的1間尾房。我進入房間後隨即與總枱聯繫要求換房，但總枱以房間已滿為由直接拒絕了我的請求，當晚我在該房的居住體驗極差，基本沒有睡好覺。讓我迷惑的是：1.為什麼就這麼好巧不巧給我的三間房全是尾房。2.我是在下午2點第一時間辦理入住，按理説這個時間不至於要到尾房的地步：3.我發現時尾房後，在入住10分鐘內提出換房請求，酒店非常果斷的回絕説客房已滿，但其實當天即便到晚上搜尋OTA平台都可以看到同房型在售。所以綜上來看，我能聯想到受到這樣的“禮遇”衹能是酒店工作人員的故意為之。説實話，在這種老牌五星級酒店發生這樣的事讓我深感意外，如此不專業服務甚至是不如路邊快捷酒店

房間挺老舊，隔音不好，凌晨隔壁房間放水洗澡的聲音巨響……再説説前台，我訂了兩個房間，入住時就跟前台説了我朋友的房間都掛他名下，他自己付.  我住兩晚先付了2500，結果第二天下午就把我的房卡給註銷了，原因是按金不夠！因為前台把我朋友和我的房間搞混在一起.  
鬧心的是晚上快11點回酒店在前台跟那女生解釋説清楚後準備回房間睡覺才發現房卡註銷了，電梯刷不了又去找前台更新，另一個小哥哥又開始問我按金不夠的問題簡直要瘋掉…… 我凌晨三點半就要起床去機場啊啊啊

老牌酒店、所以整體有點舊舊的。我個人覺得服務很好、工作人員態度很好、很親切。第一天接待我的小姑娘、名字應該叫Cherry.李，説話温温柔柔、幫我寄存行李、取行李、也會詢問客人的入住反饋、工作態度非常積極。如果有機會以後還會入住。

地理位置對於前往香港則很不錯。
若以價錢來說則性價比相對較低。
