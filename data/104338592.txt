The bathroom was a bit small but adequate, with floor-to-ceiling windows and a nice view. We ordered takeout for breakfast and ate it by ourselves in the courtyard while basking in the sun. There was also a cat who led the family. Running around, she's very well-behaved and can be fed. Whether or not she masturbates depends on your ability😏Overall, it's good, breaking the stereotype of a B&B.

msg:I have been thinking about this negative review for a long time, but I still feel it is necessary to give it! And everyone on the trip so far is pretty pissed off.
I booked three rooms for the Saturday night of 11/25 a week in advance, and I booked the Jinlin Manor, two forest rooms and one starry sky room. Until around 10 p.m. when we finished checking into the store at Disneyland, the store never called to ask if there was any change when we checked in.
When we arrived at the front desk, the Jinlin Manor was closed, and no service staff informed us. It says it's fully booked. Strange, what about our room? ? ? ?
We were taken to Linxi across the street and told that small pets were not allowed. I said it was clearly written on your introduction, why not? The clerk said we just can't. Immediately, I pulled out Ctrip’s profile, and it clearly stated that small pets are allowed. The clerk is still quibbling, saying that the operation has not changed. Strange, your operation has not changed, what does it have to do with us? I saw it was available on the homepage, so I chose this B&B.
What's even weirder is that there is only one forest room, because the previous guest smoked too much and the smoke smell could not be dissipated, so it smelled like 84 disinfectant. Hahaha, then I suggest the fire depar**ent come and check, but do you have a smoking room? If that was the case and check out was at 2pm, why didn't you call us immediately to let us know? ? What a mess! No management! ! ! It's like being deceived as soon as you step into the B&B.
Finally, the soundproofing of Linxi’s accommodation was so poor that I was speechless! Regret to death!
Really bad reviews! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Probably the business is very good anyway, so it doesn't matter what the customer's experience is, so it won't go far.
The rooms available in Linxi do not have forest rooms at all, and the prices are different from those in Jinlin. They are cheaper. The merchant finally gave us a 15% discount. Does that mean we were silenced? impossible! The 15% discount compensated 465 yuan, which is considered the price difference with Jinlin. However, guests’ true feelings still need to be given real feedback!

I was very satisfied with the sanitary conditions, very clean and tidy, and the attitude of the staff was also very good. When we go to the Disney B&B, we will arrange free pick-up and drop-off by commercial vehicles. The pick-up and drop-off staff are also very good. They are still picking up guests back to the B&B at around 9pm. Highly recommended.

I booked a starry sky room and was told that the window could not be opened. It was very hot when I opened it because there was no heat insulation. The air conditioner was so loud that I couldn't sleep at night. There was only one waiter, but his attitude was very good. The breakfast was average, just like the specifications of an ordinary B&B. The price was more than 800. Because it is in the Disney section, I booked it because the photos I saw were very beautiful. The quilt in the room is for winter. They don't have summer quilts. I don't know what the boss's brain circuit is thinking. The quilt is very thick. It was 38 degrees yesterday. If the air conditioner has to be turned on very low, then the electricity bill will be very expensive, hahaha 😂 In short, it's okay if it's around 500. More than 800 is totally not cost-effective

msg:Checking in at Jinlin, the guys and girls at the front desk were very proactive and talkative. They quickly arranged a room. Although the room was small, it was decorated very warmly, and many details made people feel comfortable. Compared with the standardized process of traditional chain hotels, boutique homestays should highlight personalized services so that guests can experience the feeling of going home. I like the refrigerator in the public hall on the first floor of his house, which is full of snacks and drinks, full of sincerity. I like his hand-grinded coffee machine. From grinding beans to compressing finished products, life slowed down all of a sudden. The nostalgic arcade in the corner made our father and son lie flat for an afternoon. It was late at night, looking at the exquisite garden and the dazzling swimming pool outside the window, it made people intoxicated. I happened to meet the investor during my morning run the next day and chatted for a while. I like his concept of operating and managing the hotel. I hope that Jinlin will not forget his original intention in the future and provide a space for busy people in the city to escape from the world.
