msg:The price/performance ratio during the May Day holiday is good. The parking lot is relatively large and the room service response speed is relatively fast. The two bottles of water in the room are too small, so I basically bought water from outside. The room facilities are quite old, the socket location is inconvenient, and the air conditioning is basically ineffective. It seems that there is only one person to clean the table for breakfast, which is not very timely. If there are many people and they go late, they have to wait for a long time to get a seat. The distance to the scenic spots is basically more than 40 kilometers. In general, this price is still cost-effective during the May Day holiday.

I went to the hotel swimming pool, but it was full of black water. The refrigerator in the suite was broken and couldn't be used. There was a big bathtub, but the waiter said it was broken and couldn't be used. I booked a non-smoking room, but the front desk said there were no non-smoking rooms! I thought to myself: Oh my God!

It covers a large area, the rooms are big, and the breakfast restaurant is also quite big. The hotel service is good and very thoughtful and attentive. It's just that the hotel is old and the equipment is a bit outdated. The mattress is too soft. The bathtub is very big but can't be used. The shower water in the bathroom has to run out.

msg:The location is very good. There are many shopping malls, food courts, hotels and hospitals around more than one kilometer. The location is very good.
The room is very warm, with a wide view, clean and sanitary. It is an old five-star style.
The service is also very warm and I feel good.
Parking is also convenient. There are large parking lots in front and behind the hotel, which can accommodate many cars.
It's a pity that the gym is in the advertisement, but it doesn't.
The facilities in the room are relatively old, especially in terms of plugs and sockets, which can't keep up with the convenience of using electronic devices in this era.
What I want to complain about most is the breakfast. Although this old five-star hotel is cheap, the breakfast is really unsatisfactory, with few varieties and poor quality. If the quality of breakfast can be improved, the quality of the entire hotel should be improved.

Even if it is late, there is still a parking space for breakfast. Although there is nothing to eat, there are many people, but my uncle is very nice. Ask him for it He will ask me if two of the yogurts are enough, should I take more?
Talking about the shortcomings, first of all, there is a KTV under the hotel, which is very noisy at night. In addition, the hotel does not need to swipe the room card for breakfast. The management is not very standardized. The breakfast variety is relatively small, just a little more. In addition, the toilet is leaking and needs to be repaired

msg:Taking advantage of the National Day, a family of three checked in. The overall impression was okay when we checked in, but it was limited to the front desk. We checked in to building B, and the door locks are unlocked by swiping a card.
Pros: The room is very spacious, with a small balcony.
Disadvantages: The elevator in the underground parking lot cannot directly go upstairs; Building B is too far from the front desk, and the elevator has to go through the lobby to go up to the second floor and walk at least 200 meters before there is an elevator; the equipment is outdated; there is no power socket at the head of the bed, even the USB port No. There are only two spare two-hole plugs that can be used in the entire room; the toiletries do not include razors and shower caps, and they are disposable packaging given at the front desk when you check in, and the drawers in the room are empty; the refrigerator is cut off and cannot be used; There is a big bathtub; but there is no water, so it cannot be used; the door lock cannot be opened after going out for dinner at night, and the waiter is called to say that the door lock is broken! ? After waiting for 20 minutes or half an hour, the staff who repaired the lock came, and when it was repaired, they said that it was repaired. Not apologetic; too little choice in the buffet.
Summary: My overall feeling is that it does not meet the five-star standard at all; the price-performance ratio of the express hotels of Home Inn Jinjiang Inn is higher than this.

The room facilities are old, and the bath towels for guests have big holes. I can't figure it out. Isn't your hotel a home away from home? Bath towels are estimated to be a bit old, and advocating saving should not be like this! Then I was crazy about money. If I want a bottle of water, the small bottle will charge me 10 yuan a bottle! This is the first time I have lived in so many hotels! More than international super 7-star hotel charges! Bad bad bad review!

msg:Last night, I went to stay in Building A because I thought Building B was too far away. After entering the room, I found a musty smell in the corridor that choked my nose. When I entered the room, there was also a musty smell. The facilities were outdated. I went to the front desk to change to Room 1659 in Building B. The result was the same. I took a shower. There is no way to wash it. I am very disappointed. There are no toiletries and slippers in the room. The front desk asked me to bring it upstairs. When I changed the slippers, I found that they were disposable slippers worn by someone.

To be honest: If you go to Xikou or Yuyao to stay in a hotel of the same quality, it is more expensive than Shangyu International Hotel. Anyway, it is only a sleeping time. , have a light meal in the morning, and you can park a motorcycle at the door, the appearance is quite grand, the only thing I want to ask the front desk is to borrow a charging plug for fifteen minutes, I have the power cord, he said no, I am a little disappointed, if in the future If you visit Siming Mountain, you will stay again.
