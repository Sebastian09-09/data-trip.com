The lobby is very clean and bright, and the front desk staff is attentive, enthusiastic and polite. The room is clean and tidy, there is no peculiar smell, and it is very comfortable to sleep at night with good sound insulation. The toilet is a smart toilet. I especially like the decorative paintings on the wall at the head of the bed, which are very tasteful. The breakfast is rich in variety and quite appetizing. It is worth mentioning that the view from the room is so beautiful. It feels great to end this trip in a comfortable hotel.

The attitude of the hotel staff and the decoration were of the level of a five-star hotel, which was pretty good. If there was anything wrong, the hotel's appearance was not grand enough, and the toilet in the room always flushed on the buttocks.
