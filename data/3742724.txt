msg:We booked the hotel with free pick up services from Guangzhou train station. The Driver - Mr  Lee is a very polite and nice driver. he managed to put all our 3 28"' luggage into his Hiphi X. BTW the concierge service was very professional, they contacted me a day before to confirm my arrival time and etc. I am impressed with the excellent services from Mr Lee and the concierges team.
i have checked in hotel on 29th Dec, which is a super peak reason, we arrived at 3pm but notice that quite a few customers still waiting for their room impatiently. this counter staff - Kevin chen was kept apologize with his friendly smile with angry customers. not given additional trouble to Kevin, i agreed to left the hotel and come back after 1 hour, since i have not taken my lunch. after 1 hour, room still not ready, and Kevin again gave his professional service to explain and apologies with additional free Breakfasts. 

Ha..ha.... somehow.. i accepted his offer and wait further for their notification. Kevin somehow has the champ and good smiles that can calm down customers like me.. Overall, hotel location is excellent for travel with metro and many options of good food nearby. The count-down party at Park Hyatt was amazing.

I really enjoyed the stayed with Park Hyatt Guangzhou and will definitely come back again. i hope to see the Driver Mr Lee and Kevin Chen in my future trips.

The bar is also very beautiful and comfortable. The breakfast is also very delicious. The swimming pool has a beautiful view. I definitely enjoyed my stay.

msg:We absolutely loved our stay at the Park Hyatt. As we arrived we were greeted by the porters downstairs. Friendly and professional. We checked in quickly, the guy at the desk spoke english and noted some of our requests. We walked in the room and loved the décor, modern and cosy and we were travelling with our 3month old daughter and her crib was already in there. Loved the toilet with all its functions, the bathroom facilities and coffee machine were all highlights. A welcome bowl of fruit arrived very soon after we walked in and we even asked for some more. We enjoyed a dip in the pool and drinks and snacks overlooking the Canton Tower. After dinner we headed back to the room and the bed was super comfy and we slept really well all night. The next morning we headed down for breakfast and loved the selection of fresh hot breakfasts they had on the menu. We took our time and had a very leisurely breakfast. It was also lovely to personally meet the general manager Marco who came over to talk to us. Our daughter was the star of the show flashing her smiles at other breakfast goers and workers. We loved our time so much we decided to change our train home and arranged late check out to enjoy the room and bath a little more. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be visiting again! Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable.

msg:Park Hyatt Guangzhou is a truly unique hotel. While other top-end hotels chase after grandness, sophistication, and luxuriousness, Park Hyatt keeps up its pursuit for simplicity and nature and performs them in a magically elegant fashion. It is a hotel as fresh as a deep tranquil bamboo forest, where the only sound one can hear comes from the wind.

Such emphasis on simplicity and nature is well manifested in its rooms. Park Hyatt Guangzhou substantially utilizes plain wooden furniture – from its mini-bar cardboard, desk, bedside table, to its floor. The furniture is so simple to the extent that I would not be surprised if someone told me they come from the village house of a grassroots family in rural Hunan. However, it is on these simple items that Park Hyatt Guangzhou plays its magic. The hotel hosts these pieces of furniture on top of a plain but exquisite background, thus extracting the simple beauty inside them while cleaning all their humble elements away. That is why I would say that the interior design of Park Hyatt Guangzhou is really an art masterpiece. It is easy to design a lovely room by using luxurious materials, but it requires a master to create something adorable by using humble items, and Park Hyatt Guangzhou does just that. Because of so, the vibe of Park Hyatt Guangzhou is the most unique among all the top-end hotels in Guangzhou, which all opt for the easier route of luxuriousness. It is because of this that I would also say that Park Hyatt Guangzhou is the hotel that can calm one’s mind the most in Guangzhou. I said that Grand Hyatt Shenzhen is like an oasis in a bustling town; now, I would say that Park Hyatt Guangzhou is even more than that – it is an Alps forest in the most premium land of southern China.

The people at Park Hyatt Guangzhou are so as well. Every lady and gentleman I had the honor to encounter at Park Hyatt Guangzhou diffused out a great sense of peace and calm. Usually, this is not an ideal quality for hotel people because it means the lack of enthusiasm when communicating with their guests. However, it is not the case in Park Hyatt Guangzhou. While sending out enormous peace and calm, the ladies and gentlemen at Park Hyatt Guangzhou could still all make me feel incredibly warm and cared for. If this is not magic, what is magic? It is especially so with Ms. Beryl Tang, who helped me change my room without any hesitation even when it was already midnight. Beyond that, Beryl even personally guided me to visit different rooms and informed me about the characteristics of each room in a manner that could not be more friendly and genuine. Our exchange was short because of your efficiency but I really enjoyed it, Beryl. It really surprised me when I realized that it was still your internship. I had never imagined that such a young lady would be able to deliver such professional services, which were professional to the extent that I thought you already had many years of experience in the industry! I firmly believe you will soon become a superstar in the hotel industry, Beryl! Thanks for everything.

The housekeeper Skylar is very enthusiastic, Katie's service is very thoughtful, the fruit sent by the hotel is fresh and seasonal, and the Tremella syrup is great, thick and sweet and light.
I will choose this place next time.

She asked about the room requirements before check-in and was very friendly. I also liked the prepared sweet soup. The room was well arranged and you can enjoy the dazzling view of Guangzhou at night. I will choose it again next time if I have the chance!

msg:The Park Hyatt is a golden diamond hotel, but no one opened the door to the hotel lobby. It was not that it was too late, but there was no awareness at all. No one picked up the suitcases and no one asked. The front desk in the lobby did not know how to say hello when entering the hotel while playing with their mobile phones. At least nod. Well, it feels like I have stayed in an express hotel. There is dust on the floor of the room and dust on the background of the bedside. As a gold and diamond level hotel, I stayed in Beijing once and had an average experience. I didn’t expect the one in Guangzhou to be even worse. I will not choose Park Hyatt in the future. . Apart from this, the only highlight is the service provided by the butler Skylar during check-in, including room introduction, etc., which is worthy of encouragement.

There is sugar water to drink in the evening, which is in a thermos. It is still hot when I go back at 11 o'clock. It is good. But the parking is stingy. If you stay for one night, you will be charged for parking for more than 24 hours. It is too troublesome to take the elevator twice from the parking lot to the room.

msg:Very satisfied! My husband and I went to Guangzhou for our anniversary and booked a package from Ctrip. We stayed in a river view room for 2 nights. The hotel upgraded us to a tower view room. They also helped us decorate the room and sent us a small cake. It was full of ceremony.
At first, I only looked at the room photos on Ctrip. Among the luxury hotels in Guangzhou, the first one I passed was Park Hyatt. I thought it was old, especially the red carpet, which looked tacky and a bit disgusting. But when I actually checked in, I felt that the design and decoration were quite textured. The hotel in the photos on Ctrip could really consider changing it.
What I am most satisfied with is the service and breakfast. Miss Skylar contacted me the night before check-in to ask about my needs. The butler-style service was touching. The breakfast was also very rich. I stayed in the Rosewood later, and the breakfast at Park Hyatt was still delicious~

It is built with wooden elements in the "Guangzhou Lingnan Courtyard". The room is large and comfortable. The front desk Katie Qiu's service is great! She contacted us one day in advance to ask about our preferences for the room. The only drawback is that the bathroom has a little odor and the water temperature is not very stable. I hope that the hotel management can see the above problems and improve them as soon as possible. Other aspects are still good! Thanks again for Katie's service!

The room was really big, and when I saw that the bathroom had a large floor-to-ceiling window facing the city's CBD, I couldn't wait to take a bath to get rid of my fatigue. The bathtub was so big that I could rarely stretch my legs. It was really I hope it has a massage function.
The toiletries have not changed. They are Le Labo's bergamot scent that I like. The whole set of products has a soothing effect. The hair still looks like it has been treated. It is not like other hotels that either dry it out or make it tangled. Oil.
The minibar is included in the package, so you can eat snacks and watch TV in the evening, and it is accompanied by night lights with a view of the entire city, which is comfortable!
It was during the Canton Fair, and there were a lot of people in the hotel. Skylar still received us very considerately and very efficiently. We really have to give it a thumbs up!
This was a very satisfying and relaxing journey, and I hope Park Hyatt can maintain such a high standard!

We were worried about missing our flight, so we took the high-speed rail instead. After we came back, we were especially told to thank Skylar. We received a call on the high-speed rail, reminding us that it was raining heavily in Guangzhou and we needed to bring our rain gear. We were picked up in person when we checked in. The stay was very good. Thank you very much for Skylar's enthusiastic service! We were also very satisfied with the room arrangement. The sweet soup prepared at night was also very good. Skylar's professional service was a special plus. The hotel is also very close to the US Consulate, and it is highly recommended for business. It is worth choosing again!

msg:Let's talk about the advantages first. The hardware is impeccable and the hygiene is very satisfactory. There is no stain or body hair, unlike a hotel of the same price in the opposite building. Although I think this is reasonable, it is really good.

There are a lot of complaints, especially the staff. First of all, when checking in, it is also an old luxury hotel. Knowing that there are many guests during the Canton Fair, they are unprepared? The front desk is seriously understaffed. There are four tables in total, and only one staff member is on duty at one table. Check-in took more than 20 minutes. You might as well send someone to pour monk fruit tea. You might as well send this person to help check in. When I got to the room, I waited for nearly half an hour for my luggage. It's unimaginable.

Secondly, the instructions can be clearer, such as going up to the 65th floor before going downstairs, such as the location of the gym and swimming pool. I can check it myself, look around and ask, of course I can figure it out, but it won't take much saliva for the front desk to give more instructions. Also, I went downstairs in my pajamas at night. I guess even a primary school student knew that I was going to get takeout, but the waiter on the first floor was still staring at me, and I didn't say anything and didn't give me any instructions. Are they all robots?

Then there was the room. There was not even a tissue in the huge room. There was none on the coffee table, the table, or the bar. I had to run to the bathroom or the toilet to find tissue after eating at the table. It was amazing. Then there was no power on the scale and the TV remote control (or it was broken). I didn't use it because I came back late on the first day, but when I came back in the evening of the second day, I found that even after cleaning, it was still not handled. I don't understand. I suggest improving the checklist for cleaning the room.

None of them are particularly unbearable, but these details can completely determine whether I come here or go somewhere else for the same high price per night.

I don't know if it was because there were too many people on the weekend, the view seats outside were very crowded, I ordered a bottle of wine and cake and flowers, but I asked the waiter 3 times before they were finally served.

Under the same conditions, Park Hyatt and Four Seasons are 500 to 1,000 yuan different. This time I chose Guangzhou Tower. When night falls and the lights come on, the stars are shining, which makes the small waist more graceful. Then lie down like Ge You, taste coffee, and taste life. It is very comfortable.

The room is not big, but the space is well separated. Apart from the low pressure of the shower in the bathroom and the slow Internet speed, there is nothing wrong with it. . The service is indeed first-class.

I had to wait for more than two hours to check in and check out before 11 o'clock the next day. I called to ask what time to check out, but I was speechless. I probably won’t choose this hotel next time I go to Guangzhou. This time I stayed in three hotels in Guangzhou, so there is no harm in not comparing them. The elevators at the Park Hyatt are very slow, and you have to wait for a long time every time you go out. The breakfast that was amazing last year also seems to have declined in quality this year, so there is no reason to choose to stay there again in the future. .

There are some small details that can be adjusted. You can put another box of paper towels in the bedroom for more convenience. The signs in the elevator can be more obvious, with lights on or color changes. The faucet of the sink is too long and it is not very convenient to wash your face. The trash can in the toilet is not very convenient to open and the location is not convenient to use. Fix the base to make it easier to open, or replace it with an electric one. The location can be placed next to the sink.

msg:Guangzhou Park Hyatt perfectly proves the recent popular phrase "high-end hotels are fast-paced". If this hotel requires itself to meet the standards of fast-paced hotels, then it is a fast-paced hotel.

I had lowered my expectations before checking in, but there were no surprises as expected.... But I didn't make any big mistakes either, so it can be said to be mediocre

I heard that the breakfast was good before I went there, but in actual experience, you can eat more and better at any restaurant in Guangzhou for nearly 250 yuan. Overall, the price-performance ratio is not high.

The noodles are boiled in plain water... At least chicken soup is used, it has no taste at all. By the way, this breakfast has relatively few hot Chinese dishes, and the meat is only smoked salmon, bacon, ham... This can only be guessed by cost control.

Finally, I strongly recommend that the hotel maintain or replace the carpet. I don't know why it looks dirty... And the paintings hanging in the room look really cheap...

msg:It was my first time booking the Park Hyatt Guangzhou, and I made the right choice! The day before check-in, the little beauty Katie Qiu called us to consult our needs. All the requests were taken seriously and perfectly met. She also paid attention to us during our stay, making us feel at home. All problems were solved in a timely and high-quality way. The hotel rooms are very well-equipped, cleverly and thoughtfully designed, spacious and comfortable. The entire team is very efficient in serving and solving problems. They are also smiling, polite and very friendly. In addition, Yue Jingxuan on the 68th floor also lives up to its reputation. Every dish is delicious and unique.

I was very impressed with my stay this time. I will definitely come back to Park Hyatt next time I go back to Guangzhou😀

The photo doesn't tell you how big it is, but it's really spacious. Even with 2 dining tables, it doesn't feel crowded at all. It's still well designed. The simple meals in the lobby bar are very particular. I recommend Barolo. This wine selection is still very pleasant. Canton Tower is quite spectacular when viewed from a restaurant or bar.

Just across the street is the US Consulate. If you have such needs, this Hyatt is excellent.

msg:The lobby of Park Hyatt Guangzhou can look at the Canton Tower parallel to each other, which is an excellent location. The high-altitude indoor swimming pool of the hotel can also look at the waistline from a parallel perspective. It is simply not too enjoyable.
You can always trust Park Hyatt. When I checked in, I saw children and was afraid of waiting too long. The guy at the lobby upgraded the room type, which was very considerate. I have always felt that the Park Hyatt is a hotel with super five-star service. The hygiene is very good, the facilities are complete, and they are very attentive.
Park Hyatt Guangzhou is a fusion of Lingnan style and modern design. Both in the lobby and in the room, you feel very comfortable. The executive lounge overlooks Xiaomanyao and the night view of the Pearl River, which is really amazing.
This time we were traveling with our children. Although it is not a family hotel, the warm service made us feel very happy.

It is about an 8-minute walk from the APM Huacheng Avenue Station. It is very convenient whether you are going to the Canton Tower, taking a night tour of the Pearl River, or shopping and eating.

Katie, who was in charge of the reception, had a sweet voice and very considerate service. Not only did she prepare welcome fruits, but she also delivered desserts every night. It was really warm.

Like the Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing and Shanghai, the Park Hyatt Hotel in Guangzhou is also located in a high-rise building. The first floor of the hotel is the welcome hall. You can take the elevator to the check-in lobby on the 65th floor in about half a minute.

Originally, when I first arrived in the afternoon, I was not too fond of the large number of log design elements in the hotel, and even felt a little old-fashioned. However, after nightfall, I discovered that the Park Hyatt, set against the lights, was as deep and peaceful as a Cantonese mansion. Charming. It is also like an old friend: although it is not pleasant at first sight, it is still long-lasting.

I would like to give special praise to Skylar for their excellent service! Not only did they contact us in advance, they also did a great job. When we arrived at the store, they welcomed us to the guest room very warmly and introduced the hotel very carefully! The prepared sugar water also brings warmth in the cooling weather in Guangzhou! Will come again next time.

msg:This time I took my daughter to travel to Guangzhou. I had stayed in a Hyatt hotel before, so I chose the Park Hyatt. The housekeeper Abby called me one day in advance to ask about my preferences for the room and added me as a friend. Before arriving the next day I sent her a message and she came downstairs to pick me up with water in advance. She helped me carry my luggage and accompanied me throughout the check-in process. She also gave my daughter chocolates to taste, which made me feel very warm as soon as I entered the hotel. After checking in, she sent me to my room about ten minutes later and I saw her coming to the room with fruits. She recommended a lot of authentic Guangzhou delicacies to me and marked which ones were particularly recommended. I went to taste them on the same day and they really matched the taste! In the evening, I asked her to help me book a bar on the 70th floor. It was wonderful to drink wine while enjoying the river breeze. The staff also thoughtfully gave me a shawl. When I returned to the room, I saw the warm red bean paste with Cantonese sugar water provided by the hotel. It gave me a bit of winter warmth in Guangzhou, where the temperature was over ten degrees. During this period, she was very responsible and asked me if I had enough fruit to eat and if I needed to clean the room. She saw me telling her that the red bean paste was delicious, so she gave it to me again that night. I think this is the employee responsibility that a good hotel should have. I had a great time on this trip, but the plan was a little rushed. If I come back to Guangzhou next time, I will still choose the warm Park Hyatt🥇🥇

msg:As one of the three high-rise hotels in Guangzhou, the scenery of Guangzhou Park Hyatt is definitely the biggest highlight. It rises from the first floor by elevator. The background board of the front desk on the 65th floor is Four Seasons and Magnificent. The lobby bar Yue Hall faces the view of Canton Tower. , the overall design has a feeling of Tokyo Park Hyatt. The room is simple and bright, with an unobstructed view of the Guangzhou landscape behind the large floor-to-ceiling windows. You can sit in front of the window and drink tea in a daze all afternoon. The terrace bar on the 70th floor is the best place to watch the lights of Canton Tower. Be sure to book a window seat in advance. The hotel service is also very good. Skylar and Kevin helped with check-in and check-out. They were enthusiastic and efficient.
Looking forward to your next stay.

I have also reported the main shortcomings to the hotel. After staying for two nights, there was no turndown service on the second night and the turndown service on the first night was rather perfunctory, and the garbage in the trash can was not cleaned in time. The paper towels were not replaced in time, resulting in the tissue box being out of paper on the last day.
Breakfast is semi-buffet style with relatively few varieties.
And to go from the lobby on the first floor to the guest room, you need to transfer to the elevator twice, which makes the design somewhat cumbersome.

An international hotel has such service. I have commented this afternoon, but there is still no result. This is definitely not going to work!
What kind of attitude did you promise to give me results, but so far there are no results?
The duty manager's attitude makes me very angry. Where is your attitude?
Where are the international brand hotels? Have you dealt with them?
A head chef is very dissatisfied with the way he treats guests and the way he communicates with the front desk. The attitude is very poor. I have already left the hotel. I have a very poor attitude towards such hotel service.
Facilities: Poor facilities and equipment, no sense of experience, old hotel
Hygiene: It was not clean at night. There were mosquito bites during the special meals. When I came to the hotel to drink wine, the manager changed it for me.
Environment: The entire hotel environment is very poor and the experience is poor
Service: There is no service. The attitude of the hotel executives and hotel waiters towards me is slightly better than the service attitude of the girl, but the rest is a mess, very bad.

After checking out, they directly deducted several hundred restaurant charges from me without confirming with me. After I asked repeatedly, I found out that the staff charged the wrong amount, but it would take more than a week for a refund.
The carpet in the hotel is simply beyond description, and the lighting design is extremely unscientific.
I have dedicated staff who have contacted and followed up before I checked in. There are no five-star charges and one-star services. They are all wrong.

Location: Absolute advantage. Canton Tower can be seen from the lobby and some rooms. Downstairs are Guojin and AutoNavi. It is very convenient to eat and very close to the square.
Food: Park Hyatt's own food has an absolute advantage. Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants, and afternoon tea are all very good.
I will definitely choose Park Hyatt again when I come to Guangzhou in the future.

The lobby is on the 65th floor with a nice view.

Service: The most impressive thing about this trip was the hotel service. The night before I checked in, Katie contacted me on WeChat and followed her along the way. We got off the plane and went to the attractions first. When we arrived at the hotel in the evening, we were handed over to Skylar to pick us up. He enthusiastically escorted me into the room, introduced various items, and arranged for Cantonese-style sugar water to be delivered to the hotel. Before checking out, Katie specially asked us to see us off in the lobby to make up for the regret of not being able to pick us up. She sent us to the first floor to get in the car.
Also, Mary Yuan, the receptionist in the lobby that night, had a very special name that I remembered right away. I told my daughter she was Miss Dollar, and my daughter corrected her as Mary Yuan. I remember her, she was very meticulous and gentle, and she adjusted our room. To the room where Canton Tower can be seen a little.
I have stayed in many five-star hotels, even the one owned by Wang Sicong's family in Shanghai. To be honest, the service at this Park Hyatt is so impressive. The girls are very gentle and look young. They may still be babies at home, but when facing guests, they are very polite, considerate and considerate, and are sincerely serious about their work. Like it!
There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, but the quality is the best, including passion fruit, dinosaur eggs, eggs benny and waffles.
The water in the swimming pool is very clean and has been tested. You can see the Canton Tower. The infinity pool is great!

It's low-key and hidden in Zhujiang New Town. Next door is K11 and Canton Tower. It's very comfortable to go for a walk at night. The a**osphere of the hotel is very good. The rooms are very comfortable and I can sleep peacefully. The tone of the original wood is softer and warmer.

The only flaw is that the floor mat in the guest toilet 🚽 is just covered with a thin absorbent towel (too cheap). If it can be replaced with a thick carpet, it will be better to walk on.

msg:Guangzhou’s high-end afternoon tea and evening rooftop bar, Park Hyatt should be directly linked to the first choice of search engines! This is also the reason why I chose this hotel. Nowadays, everyone likes to "check in" and use gimmicks, but the details often make people feel regretful. But after all, Park Hyatt has many years of confidence and guarantee. I like their afternoon tea time and delicious breakfast snacks. The facilities in the clubhouse are less crowded, clean and quiet. It is a pleasant stay experience. Recommended!

msg:Here is my review of my stay at this hotel:

First of all, the location of this hotel is very convenient. It is located in the city center, close to many famous attractions and business districts, and has convenient transportation. During my stay, I was able to easily access nearby shopping centers and restaurants, which made my trip even more convenient.

Secondly, the appearance and facilities of the hotel are very exquisite. The design of the lobby is very modern and luxurious. The decoration of the guest rooms is very exquisite, and the bedding and furniture are very comfortable. I also particularly like the public areas of the hotel, including the lounge and restaurant. The environment is elegant and suitable for leisure and work.

In addition, the hotel's service quality is also excellent. The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic. They responded promptly to my needs and questions and provided effective assistance. The hotel also provided thoughtful services such as luggage storage and travel consultation, which made me feel at home.

The cleanliness and hygiene of the hotel are also commendable. Both the guest rooms and public areas are kept very clean and tidy. They have strict hygiene measures which gave me a sense of peace of mind and comfort.

In terms of dining, the hotel offers a variety of options and the food is of very high quality. Whether it was breakfast or dinner, I was able to taste delicious local and international dishes, which was a real treat.

Finally, the price of this hotel is very reasonable for the services and facilities it offers, making it a great value for money. I feel like I got good value for money.

Overall, I was very impressed with this hotel. The location is convenient, the facilities are elegant, the service is excellent, clean and tidy, the food and beverages are abundant, and the value exceeds expectations. If given the chance, I will definitely choose to stay at this hotel again.

msg:A very good living experience. Before checking in, I received a caring call from Katie and added a WeChat account. After getting off the car, we couldn't find the hotel lobby for a while. Katie came to pick us up and accompanied us all the way to check in and deliver it to the room. He also thoughtfully returned daily necessities to the children and told us the specific location of the US Consulate. In the evening, Jason also specially delivered sweet soup in a thermos bottle, which made the children who were a little tired and hungry from swimming immediately feel the warmth, which was really touching. The location of the Park Hyatt is very good. Whether it is the lobby or the room, the infinity pool gives people a very good experience. Especially the surrounding shopping malls and restaurants are also very convenient, which is really good. By the way, it is also a good choice to sit in the cafe in the lobby and enjoy a cup of cloud coffee👍When leaving, Katie even sent us all the way to the car. She is a very beautiful and professional girl. I give her a thumbs up again👍

msg:First, I first called the lobby at ten o'clock to ask what time I could check in. The reply said that the safest time would be two o'clock. If I arrived at three o'clock, the hotel would give me a first and last room without informing me in advance! Second, I booked a river view room, and when I checked in, I was told that I could see the tower upgrade with river view. The upgrade cost more than 200. This consumption front desk did not inform the fee in advance. Third, I went to the guest room twice and couldn't open the door. It was like a ghost punching the wall. I tried it with my friend but couldn't open it, couldn't push it or pull it out. I asked the waiter to solve it. Fourth, when I entered the room, I found that the room service was not complete from the beginning. When I arrived from 6 to 7 o'clock, the waiter came to the door three times, once to deliver water, once to deliver welcome fruit, and once to inquire about turndown. Can't we provide complete consultation and service at once? Fourth, it was extremely cold, the air conditioner did not heat up, the room was extremely small, and the design was unreasonable. I bumped into the mirror three times, and I lost my ID card holder for no reason. I was given a quilt in the middle of the night. I booked a twin room and got a double room. How can I cover myself with a big quilt? The grass cloth was very poor, the bed was very hard, the pillows were very uncomfortable, and I barely slept the whole night. There are so many choices at the same price range and star rating, I will never choose Park Hyatt again! One star is too much

The front desk floor on the 65th floor was perfect for taking pictures of my waist. The room faced the river and there were few people in the swimming pool. My children loved it. We ran out of sweet water in the evening, so we gave the hotel homemade tiger skin rolls as a gift, which were particularly delicious.

msg:Park Hyatt Guangzhou is the hotel I will choose every time I travel. The service of the hotel is very good, the facilities are perfect, and the travel is convenient. I originally planned to stay for four days, but I couldn't help but stay for a few more days.
👤Park Hyatt's service has always been very good. Ms. Skylar is very enthusiastic and brought me sugar water and fruit during my stay. Brother Alex Gong also provided me with a lot of help. Thank you so much for your professional, enthusiastic, generous and courteous service attitude. The aunt who was in charge of the hygiene of 6010 during the stay was also very friendly. She found that I drank water quickly and would prepare a few more bottles of water for me every time I cleaned. She also helped me roll up the power cord and put it neatly. She was very delicate and enthusiastic.
🏩The design of the hotel is Lingnan style, which is one of the reasons why I choose Park Hyatt Guangzhou as always. I really like the decoration of the room and bathroom. The hotel has a beautiful view. This time I stayed on the 60th floor, which is a relatively high floor of the hotel. Whether it is day or night, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery of Guangzhou. Even if it is raining, you can still witness the foggy city of Guangzhou from a high altitude. Five-star recommendation.

msg:Regrettable accommodation experience, hope it can be improved

I'm sorry to say that my experience at the Park Hyatt Guangzhou fell far short of my expectations. I had several issues that I feel should not be happening for a hotel with such a reputation.

First, there seemed to be a problem with the room's air conditioning system, which prevented it from cooling properly. Considering Guangzhou's climate, a well-working air conditioning system is essential. However, in my room, the air conditioner never seemed to provide enough cooling no matter how I adjusted it, which made my night's sleep very uncomfortable.

Secondly, I was quite disappointed with the quality of the beds. The bed was so hard that you could visibly feel the springs underneath it, providing a very cheap and uncomfortable sleeping experience. This is an extremely rare experience for me in an upscale hotel and far from the standard I've come to expect from a Park Hyatt.

In addition, I am not satisfied with the breakfast service. Breakfast was advertised until 10am, but when I arrived at 9:40, there was a long line of customers waiting. Even more dissatisfying is that the front desk staff did not seem to care about the needs of the guests. No one came to ask or guide where to wait in line, and no one informed them of possible waiting times. This lack of efficiency and customer care is unacceptable under any circumstances.

Overall, my stay fell short of expectations in many important aspects, which is really disappointing for a Park Hyatt hotel that symbolizes high-quality service and facilities. I hope the hotel will take this feedback seriously and make improvements where necessary to ensure that future guests can enjoy the comfort and satisfaction they deserve.

msg:During the Spring Festival, the room rates of five-star hotels located in Guangzhou’s C position are high. I completely understand and accept this. However, the room facilities and sanitary conditions are completely inconsistent with the price and the quality of the hotel.
1. I don’t know if it’s because the toilet is not cleaned properly or because of the exhaust design. It smells like a poop pit that someone else just squatted in. It feels disgusting!
2. The refrigerator in the room is placed in a very stylish cabinet. Although it looks good, it makes a lot of noise. Apart from the noise of the refrigerator and the resonance of the cabinets, it was impossible to sleep.
3. The sound insulation effect of the room is very poor. The noise of the children next door came through very clearly early in the morning. In addition, I didn't sleep well due to the noise from the refrigerator the night before. I was woken up early in the morning and was about to collapse.
4. The phone on the bedside is also like a decoration. If I want to inform the front desk at night about the noise from the refrigerator and the noise next door, I have to find the front desk phone with my mobile phone and call it.
I stay in five-star hotels no less than ten times a year, and this is my first negative review of a hotel. Can

msg:Park Hyatt Guangzhou has the same design sense as the previous Park Hyatt series, moderate space, comfortable living environment, and excellent considerate service. I am very impressed with the management reception staff of the hotel: Yan no . Alex. Skylar. I failed to book dinner on the 68th floor of the hotel on a certain platform. Before I left, I called the front desk and immediately helped me arrange it. When I checked into the hotel, I could enjoy a delicious meal.
I believe that Park Hyatt's considerate service reflects the entire hotel management and the quality of all management teams.
Thank you for your dedication!

It would be perfect if my children could see the night view of the Canton Tower. Unexpectedly, the front desk of the hotel (whose name is very impressive is Xian Zhaoyuan) readily met my request. I was upgraded to a Guangzhou Tower view room for free, and I also gave red bean porridge and fruit for supper. It was a pleasant night! Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will stay here again. The most important thing is for the children to be happy!

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Park Hyatt Guangzhou, the view from the room is good. Although I didn't stay for a long time, the service of the whole hotel during my stay was very comfortable. Whether it is the attitude or professionalism of the hotel staff, they all demonstrate the style of the Park Hyatt brand! What was particularly impressive was the butler: Alex Gong, who helped us deal with everything in advance when we left the store. The luggage was placed on the first floor so that we could pick it up when we came back. He has an unparalleled service perspective on the needs and arrangements of guests. Behind the professionalism is the support of Hyatt Group's training, and I hope it will be maintained. It's a little regret that I didn't get to eat the dishes in the hotel restaurant. Next time I have a chance to come back, I must try it!

Park Hyatt’s impression, first of all, the location, if parents bring their children or go to the US Consulate for a visa interview alone, Amway Park Hyatt is very close, across the road is the US Consulate’s visa interview queue, the location is very good, just a few minutes walk downstairs To Huadu Square, there are Guangzhou Library, Guangzhou Museum, Guangzhou Grand Theater, Haixinsha Asian Games Park, and IFC is next to it. Secondly, the hotel provided fruit as a gift, and upgraded us from the river view room to the tower view room for free. In the room, we can enjoy the brilliance of Xiaomanyao at night and the tranquility of the day. Tina at the front desk is warm and thoughtful, very nice. Finally, the Cantonese restaurant on the 68th floor is also good.

msg:Totally in love with this hotel. Came here a week ago. This time I came to the first floor and Alex, the concierge whom I reviewed last week, called me by my name when he saw me. I have allergies, and he taught me how to buy allergy medicine and arranged for the concierge to pick up the courier medicine for me, so that I didn’t have to worry about answering courier calls during the meeting. The river view suite is amazing, the scenery feels like it is surrounded by 200 degrees. What's slightly worse is that I arrived at three o'clock and there was no room for me. I had to wait for fifty minutes and still couldn't check in. By that time, all the guests I had arranged to meet at four o'clock had already arrived. I was wearing the wrinkled clothes and pants from the journey, and I was a little embarrassed. Fortunately, the front desk slightly upgraded me to a room type, and I entered the room at four o'clock. This shows that the front desk has sense and knows how to handle this situation. So I still like the overall experience.

msg:I rarely give reviews, this Park Hyatt is really bad.
1. Look at the pictures and talk, this is called the River View Room, right?
2. There are too few breakfast categories, which does not meet the positioning of the first-class hotel.
3. The cleaning is not clean, there are towels left by the previous customer when entering the hotel toilet.
4. The most unbearable thing is that the wireless network in the hotel is basically unusable. If you swipe WeChat, you will get stuck. If you don’t connect to the wireless network, the mobile phone signal will be good and bad.
5. It is hard to say that it is a luxury hotel in terms of hardware and software.
6. Because of the need for business trips, I have lived in Ritz, Wenhua, and Rosewood in Guangzhou, and this one is the worst. Other homes have more or less bright spots.

msg:As the largest city in southern China, there are so many hotels to choose from in Guangzhou. But since you want to see the city scenery, there are only a few high-altitude hotels in the city center. After all, this is a Park Hyatt built on top of a skyscraper and facing the Canton Tower. The scenery is invincible. After I checked in, I realized that Park Hyatt Guangzhou is a hotel "created with heart", which integrates the long and long history and culture of Lingnan with the exquisite and modern brand characteristics of Park Hyatt from inside to outside. Thanks to Ms. Yanni for her warm service and professional and efficient check-in.

This is exactly like a four-star hotel or even a three-star hotel. The service is not even as good as an express hotel. 1. In terms of room hygiene, the water was opened by someone else, so I was reluctant to add more bottles of water. Later, after using a kettle to boil the water, I found a layer of something floating on the surface. 2. The sound insulation is very poor. You can clearly hear singing in the next room and downstairs. 3. The open kitchen of the hotel's Yuexuan restaurant smelled smoky after eating. It took 40 minutes to order the noodles. The waiters chatted together and had no sense of service. 4. There is a queue for breakfast. The waiters only care about serving foreigners, but they treat Chinese people differently. All in all a disgusting experience.

The water in the swimming pool is very clean, and the water temperature of 31 degrees is also very suitable. It is very friendly to children! However, the carpets in the corridors of the hotel can be replaced or do a deep cleaning... The mottled feeling of water stains really makes people feel that it has dropped several levels in an instant. The breakfast buffet is still very good. Although there are not many choices, the delicacy and taste are still very good.

Check-in on the 65th floor, and then transfer to the elevator for guests staying in the hotel to go to the guest room area. This is well designed to ensure the safety and privacy of the guests. The hotel is designed by Super Tudou. The design sense does not really stand out. Compared with The Mandarin Oriental in the same city is inferior. The service is in line with Park Hyatt's standard except for breakfast. The room size is normal for a luxury hotel. There is a separate bathroom and a smart toilet. This is great, the bathroom space is normal, the double sinks that are standard in luxury hotels, and the mirror TV next to the bathtub are all equipped. The biggest highlight is that under the general trend of hotel environmental protection, this hotel can still provide small bottles of spare parts, which is really amazing. Bedding is average. The minibar is average. The drinking water in the guest room is generously equipped with Tibet Glacier 5100 mineral water. The breakfast is average, and the service is inferior to other luxury hotels. I asked if I needed coffee, but I didn't make tea. It may be because of the large number of people. I personally feel that the breakfast is very average, much worse than Beijing Park Hyatt. Personally, I think this Park Hyatt is not very outstanding.

It’s very inconvenient to think about getting off the elevator first when you stay in the hotel. And the high pressure response is also very strong. There are so many concierge staff, and none of them assists in pressing and sending off the elevator on the first floor.
Hygiene: Look at the pictures and let's talk, it's too average, and the shower room smells bad when taking a bath. It's really not as hygienic as an express hotel. This is the Park Hyatt Hotel.
Service: The hotel has too many requirements, not to mention that they can't help with delivery, even the takeaway brother is not allowed to pass through this road on a bicycle ✅Originally, the communication was good, and the drinks that were ordered were also sealed. The concierge said that they could help deliver to the room, but when the takeaway arrived, the takeaway asked everyone, and they all answered: no. This time the hotel staff discriminated against takeaways and delivery guys. I called the front desk again, and they told me with a very general attitude that I could send it away, ban it once, and sign a waiver. When I heard it, I said that I would go down by myself. Would you rather play with your mobile phone or computer than help with the service? There is no one to help with luggage. And during the check-in period, I kept rubbing the floor, and my ears were uncomfortable when the elevator came up.
Service: The only good service was on the first floor. I went to pick up takeaway and saw that I had a lot of things in my hand. Xiaoyu at the front desk quickly helped press the elevator when checking in, and another person helped me move the room to the next floor.

msg:It is the first time to live in a five-star hotel in the city where I live. After choosing between Park Hyatt and Ritz for a long time, I finally chose Park Hyatt. Sure enough, I chose the right one!

The design is relatively young and fashionable (I thought Ritz was old-fashioned at the time), which is my favorite style. The room is more than 50 square meters, like Ctrip's service! Helped to upgrade to a river view room, and also gave fruit. There is a loose sofa area, a round table dining area, a large bed of 2 meters, and comfortable bedding. I like its bathtub the most, it is clean and comfortable.

In terms of landscape, full floor-to-ceiling glass windows allow you to see the night and day views of Zhujiang New Town at 180 degrees, which is very open

The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel's service staff can't keep up with the response speed (this was the case a few years ago), and every time you ask for something to be delivered, you have to rush it in time, unlike the service that a five-star hotel should have

The indoor pool and spa pool are nice and less crowded. But swimming requires a swimming cap.

msg:It can only be said that it is very average. I did not expect Park Hyatt Guangzhou to be like this. Let me talk about my feelings:
First, check in after 4:00 pm, the front desk said the room was not cleaned well before that, we can only go shopping around
Second, there were mosquitoes in the room, which woke us up in the middle of the night, biting several bags on our feet, and feedback from room service, we waited for a long time before delivering a bottle of toilet water spray
Thirdly, the hair dryer is broken. I told the guest room that they didn’t believe it, saying that I hadn’t turned on the main power switch. Finally, I arranged for the waiter to try it in person. It was indeed broken, so I replaced it with a new one.
Fourth, the child wants to take a bath, but the water in the bathtub is broken
Fifth, I ordered sandwiches at the coffee bar in the lobby, and waited for more than an hour to deliver them. The waiters themselves were embarrassed

Overall experience: I have lived in a lot of five-star hotels. This is the first time I have encountered a hotel with so many problems. The sanitation is not up to standard, the equipment has problems, and the service cannot keep up. I don’t know if I will choose Park Hyatt in the future, but I will definitely not choose it in the future. Park Hyatt Guangzhou.

msg:Because I booked another hotel and found bugs, I changed here temporarily. It was already early in the morning when I rushed over, and I was very embarrassed and tired. I originally thought that this May Day holiday experience was over, but luckily I met Xiaoxian (Xian Zhaoyuan). He listened to our experience and was very considerate of us, and specially upgraded our room, which instantly comforted our tired soul. After that, I added WeChat to ask if we need to add quilts, slippers, etc. after we checked in. In the middle of the night, he helped us carefully analyze what type of room we should book in the next few days. Judging from the year of the hotel's renovation, I thought it would be relatively old. After arriving at the room, I feel that the maintenance of all aspects of the facilities is relatively good, and the smart devices are relatively easy to use. The hotel lobby is facing Xiaomanyao, whether it is taking pictures or watching the night view is very good.

The room is clean but the carpet is still dirty

There are only 4 bottles of purified water in the room, other charges are too expensive

Compared with the Regent Hotel where I stayed in Chongqing before, it is a world away.

The typical skin is bigger than the bone, flashy, only the outside but no content

The breakfast is expensive, but there is nothing hard to eat. It is generally not delicious. Although there are many types, there is nothing special, and there is no caviar.

msg:It was my first time to stay at the high-end Park Hyatt Hotel. I thought it would give my children a wonderful memory and make them yearn for the big city! So Sheben asked for two rooms. The space was large enough and the environment was average. Everyone is just coveting the beautiful scenery of the Pearl River outside the window and the invincible appeal of the Canton Tower. This is the key value of the hotel. However, I think the hotel's service is not good enough, mainly reflected in two aspects: First, I upgraded to a suite. Originally, the customer service said that they would help me add an extra bed for free. Both of them were OK. Then I took my children out shopping. I thought I would see an extra bed when I came back, but it was empty. I called customer service. The reply made me speechless. They said I didn't tell them and I wanted to ask. I originally booked a twin room. You suggested that if I pay more for an upgrade, you can provide me with better services. Can anyone tell that I am sure I want an extra bed? Park Hyatt Hotel customer service, aren’t you the best? After repeated communication, we had no choice but to give me an extra bed. Second, I went out for fun the next morning and checked out early. When I checked out, I specifically asked the front desk staff if parking was free? The front desk said that as long as you drive out before twelve o'clock that night, it's free. good! Then I went shopping for a whole day and came back around 7pm to drive to the next place. I was stopped in front of the Banpo toll pole for nearly 30 minutes. The property management said that the hotel didn't communicate with them and they didn't know it was free! Then I called the front desk of the hotel and said that they were communicating with each other, but they still didn't give any information! The people behind came up and said fiercely, "Let's get them out first!" I want to ask, there is only one road and it is on a slope, with parked cars and full of people, how can you fill my anger towards you? ? ! ! ! In the end, I don’t know how you guys evened it out with the property management company, so I went out. The female front desk staff on the phone had such a bad attitude and her tone was really disgusting! If ** wasn't in a hurry to eat, I would have gone up and asked who the front desk woman was, with such a disgusting attitude! ! ! ! ! I have a negative review about your service.

msg:For the last stop of this trip to Guangdong, I specially booked my favorite hotel brand - Park Hyatt.
On the 53-70 floors of Kaiying Plaza, the first time you take the elevator, you will feel a little dizzy, especially when you come up from the underground garage, you need to take the elevator three times to get to the room.
Check in at the front desk on the 65th floor. Soon, the little brother at the front desk upgraded us to a river view room with a side view of the Pearl River. Because I had a late flight on the last day, he also helped me delay check-out until 3 pm.
The hotel is well maintained, very clean and the rooms are bright. The swimming pool faces Xiaomanyao, and the night view is beautiful. Children and the elderly have to play for a while every night.
But to say a word, if you want to see Xiaomanyao, this hotel is almost the same, the building is not high enough and there is a block in front.
Also, the lunch buffet at the hotel's Italian restaurant is a bit pitted, there are too few varieties, and it's not very good to eat!
Welcome fruit (only on the first day of check-in): This is almost meaningless. In a hotel in the south, the fruit turns out to be apples, pears, bananas and other northern fruits!

6. The breakfast is a bit small, and it may be a bit difficult to catch up with too many people, but the service is still in place, busy but not chaotic!
7. The trouble of changing elevators in high-floor hotels is inevitable~
8. It is recommended that the water bar has a teapot 🫖, and there can be a little Chinese tea on it, which is definitely more professional and considerate than those coffee bags and tea bags! come on!

All stored items can be delivered directly to the room. The hotel is also convenient to travel. It takes more than 20 minutes to take a taxi to the old city. It faces Canton Tower across the river, and the selected tower view room is considered to be facing Canton Tower. The only thing to complain about is the Wi-Fi, which is unstable. Also, the sanitary basket in the toilet is not very convenient to use. (It is also a common problem of all Park Hyatt hotels)

The hotel facilities are not very new, and the bathrobe was torn with a big hole. I stayed in the room for two consecutive days, and when I returned to the room at 10 o'clock in the evening the next day, no one cleaned it. The house stinks because I bought raw pickles the day before. I really don't know where to drop it. Inform the hotel that it is possible that I hung up and please do not disturb. But pretty sure I didn't. The service attitude is good, but maybe the Spring Festival is too busy.

Praise the breakfast, unexpectedly delicious!
Dinner is a simple meal, mainly drinking and enjoying the scenery, the view is really great!
The swimming pool is very comfortable, there is not much to say from the pictures, the baby refuses to leave after swimming.
The size of the room is OK, not crowded, and the floor-to-ceiling windows have a pleasant view～
Finally, Park Hyatt's software-service is really nothing to say!

On the first night, I bought a set meal with a $100 spending credit, but the food in the lobby bar is terrible! ! Not worth the lightning protection but the breakfast is very good in the form of buffet + a la carte, worth trying
On the first night, I upgraded to a river view room, but I couldn’t see the river (shown in P1) and the view was not as good as that of P2. If I went to the garden view room, I could even see the river in the garden view room, so there was no need to book a river view room.
The service is basically not worthy of the Park Hyatt brand. There is no doorman on the first floor to help with the luggage. I called the room depar**ent to ask for something and the delivery time was very slow. I can’t explain it in words, so I was a little disappointed. The weather was bad two days ago and I didn’t try the bar on the 70th floor
Let's talk about the benefits. The view is really good. The hotel rooms are all above the 55th floor. The location is unbeatable. It is close to the Zhujiang New Town subway station. The hardware and bedding can also be praised, but I'm afraid I won't stay next time. The experience is not as good as Chongqing Regent

After returning to China under the epidemic, after the quarantine was completed in Guangzhou, I carefully selected the Park Hyatt Hotel to stay for two days. It was a perfect leisure travel experience. Park Hyatt Guangzhou is an elegant hotel with sophisticated modernity and Lingnan style. Located in the center of Guangzhou Pearl River New Town, the hotel lobby is located on the 65th floor. It is worth mentioning that there is an open-air outdoor bar on the 70th floor. The waiter and the little girl at the front desk were very considerate and upgraded me to the highest floor room of the hotel. The view here is very good. The adjacent skyscrapers stand in front of you like a group of heroes competing for hegemony. It is very oppressive and shocking! Standing in front of the window, you can look down. Usually, you can overlook the Pearl River New Town. The Pearl River is even more beautiful at night! People who are afraid of heights, be careful to fall! 😄
Facilities: The hotel rooms are still very high-tech. As soon as you enter the door, the floor-to-ceiling large curtains slowly rise like a giant screen, which is full of dignity. Needless to say, the sensor sanitary ware is a hidden artifact in the bathroom specially introduced by the hotel reception manager. It was amazing that there was an invisible TV in the mirror in front of the bathtub. Don't think of the standby red dot as a monitor! Ha ha ha ha! - Set a time to go swimming, the sun shines into the infinity pool, like being in a crystal palace, it is rare to have such a clean, not many people come here for entertainment, spend an afternoon in comfort, forget the discomfort of the epidemic, so happy! Will choose here next time.

From the beginning of the check-in, the entire housing experience is very good, the service is considerate, and every detail reflects the high-quality service of the top hotel industry.
The room is a minimalist style of wood that combines the characteristics of Lingnan, which is very comfortable. My favorite is the bathroom, which is spacious and bright. The three-piece bath is the woody fragrance of le labo, which matches the overall style of the room. (The only fly in the oin**ent, the cable TV can't watch me, my fan husband is quite depressed)
The swimming pool needs to be reserved in advance, it is best to avoid crowds. The half-sky swimming pool, the water is very clean, and the swimming is very enjoyable. Not only the view is good, there are towels and lemonade in the rest area, and you can also have a bird's-eye view of the CBD when you are resting.
It's very caring that when I came back from a walk in the evening, the hotel also sent Tremella sugar water, which is very heart-warming.
There are many kinds of breakfast, the most recommended is wonton, which is really a signature. Secondly, you can try the char siew crisps and Chinese dim sum, and the croissants are also very good. Looking at the beautiful scenery and drinking a glass of freshly squeezed juice, you will be full of energy in the morning [naughty] [naughty]
Finally, a special thanks to Ares, Ryan and Bieber at the front desk. After they learned that I was pregnant, they arranged a lot of services very considerately, including a one-hour late check-out, so that we could not be in such a hurry.
Because the experience this time was really good, my husband and I decided to come to the "tour of the city" at intervals in the future, and regularly broadcast [Kiss][Kiss][Kiss]

msg:[I didn't expect the experience of staying at Park Hyatt to wash away the fatigue of my work]
Located in the CBD of Guangzhou, the location of Park Hyatt is naturally unbelievable. As a frequent guest of Guangzhou hotels, staying at Park Hyatt for the first time left a very comfortable and unforgettable experience. From the hardware to the attentiveness of the service staff, they are all professional five-star!

The hotel lobby is located on the 65th floor, and the view of the small waist in the distance is integrated with the lounge, which is very elegant. When checking in, while admiring the woodcarving design, Chinese and Western fusion and very stylish decorations, I have forgotten how I just got in from the evening rush hour of the traffic jam.

The front desk staff Mia has a sweet smile and knows my check-in arrangement very well. Knowing that I am here with my friends to celebrate the anniversary this time, I also thoughtfully prepared the sweet soup from the restaurant and the fruits that come with the hotel for us😊 I am very thoughtful!

The rooms on the 62nd floor are simply furnished and show ingenuity everywhere. The comfortable layout makes people just want to stay in the room, not even thinking of having breakfast downstairs the next day.
A lot of details are blended just right. The floor-to-ceiling glass in the room has a panoramic view of the city center of Guangzhou on the 62nd floor. From day to night, you can feel the heartbeat of this bustling city at close range.

This trip is in a hurry, and I can only experience the hotel room for a short time. I hope that next time I will have the opportunity to go to the hotel's star-rated restaurant to enjoy a formal meal.

In general, the experience of staying in a hotel is the journey itself.

When I went out to the hotel, I accidentally left the hotel umbrella in the taxi. I praised Jason Chen from the concierge for his emergency response ability and helped him deal with it properly in time. At the same time, I thanked rio deng from the concierge for walking a long distance to retrieve the umbrella. Thank you for their caring service!

The toiletries and coffee machines are very professional! Comfortable bedding! The most amazing is the Guangzhou Tower View Swimming Pool on the 63rd floor, which is worth taking pictures and punching in. In addition, the coffee bar and outdoor bar have excellent viewing positions.

msg:This is a stylish hotel
The design from the lobby to the guest rooms is full of Lingnan elements
Among the many luxury hotels in Guangzhou, Park Hyatt was finally chosen as the proposal hotel, and overall I am quite satisfied.

⭕️Service: The hotel helped to upgrade the river view room on the high floor, you can see the Canton Tower, which is worth extra points. The overall service is quite satisfactory, from the bellman to the front desk to the room service to the restaurant service, although there is no surprise, but the overall is patient and friendly.
⭕️Facilities: Basically the same as the descriptions of other reviews, but the overall hygiene standard is definitely no problem. The facilities are starting to age a bit, and the carpet stains in the corridor are more obvious, which affects the overall grade a bit. The toilet sewer has a peculiar smell. In addition, the sound insulation is really not very good. If you speak loudly outside, you can hear it clearly inside.
⭕️Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is relatively comfortable. The Lingnan architecture and wood carving art in the lobby are more distinctive. Canton Tower can also be seen from the lobby bar. There is a sense of serenity and luxury in the evening. If you do not pursue the ultimate high-rise and Guangzhou Tower view, it is a good choice
⭕️ Catering: The package includes light buffet and breakfast, which are arranged in the Italian restaurant, which is relatively small in size. The happy hour is relatively short. Arrived at the restaurant at 7 and it was over at 8. There are also fewer types of drinks and snacks to choose from. Breakfast is ok. The wontons in the Ming file are more recommended.

To sum up: I personally think that Park Hyatt is the most cost-effective among luxury hotels in Guangzhou. If you don't have much obsession with Cloud Hotel and Panoramic Pearl River➕Guangzhou Tower. Park Hyatt's Tower View Room is also a good choice.

When you go to the swimming pool, you need to wear a swimming cap or buy room cleaning services. The smart toilet bathtub has a mirror TV. The corridor is dark.

msg:I stayed at Rosewood just a week ago, so I can make a comparison. Let’s summarize first: Park Hyatt wins by comparison between these two stays.
1-Location: Not much difference, K11 is downstairs in Rosewood, and Friendship Store is next to Park Hyatt.
2-Parking: The difference is not much, and the road for Rosewood to enter the parking lot is narrow. Park Hyatt has mechanical bits.
3- Hygiene: Park Hyatt wins. In response to these two stays, the magnificent bathtub has hair, the indoor bathroom and the sliding door in the middle of the room have residual appetite, the carpet has broken bread, and the work table has broken appetite, and the sanitary condition is appalling. Park Hyatt hygiene is acceptable.
4- Warm feeling: Park Hyatt wins. Both houses have fruit, but Park Hyatt has a disinfection kit. This time, the children in Park Hyatt snorted in the swimming pool, and the housekeeping quickly provided iodophors and Band-Aids. The decoration of the lobby and rooms, the aroma of aroma, Park Hyatt is more comfortable.
5-Scenery: Magnificent High, the last time I lived was on the 90th floor, and the Park Hyatt was on the 56th floor, I feel the same. Magnificent has a slight advantage.
6- Wellness Center: Park Hyatt wins. The treadmill has an isolation glass, which is very considerate. Park Hyatt has a waiter who regularly sprays and wipes it for disinfection. The Park Hyatt locker room has a large hot tub with massage and wet steam. Pool view is good. Rosewood is more like an apar**ent facility.
7-Service: I think Park Hyatt is better, although everyone is polite, but Park Hyatt feels more natural service regardless of catering, housekeeping, fitness or front desk. Catering is also a coaxing attitude.
8- Epidemic prevention: Park Hyatt wins. The Park Hyatt parking lot needs to scan the code, the main entrance needs to scan the code, the front desk needs to see the itinerary code, and the fitness center needs to make an appoin**ent to prevent the number of guests from exceeding a certain number. The rooms are equipped with masks and disinfectants, which are very comfortable and safe. The Rosewood parking lot has QR code scanning, but it is not available after arrival, and there are no supporting anti-epidemic materials.
9- Bathroom: Leveling. Park Hyatt has an electric toilet, but the water pressure is average. The magnificent shower was comfortable and the bathtub drained smoothly. The matching cleaning supplies are about the same.
10- Room comfort: Park Hyatt wins. Although the Park Hyatt rooms are not magnificent, they are reasonably furnished. The carpet design is more reasonable and safer than the magnificent ones. The Park Hyatt central air conditioner is more comfortable than the magnificent ones.
11- Value for money. Magnificent 1600, Park Hyatt 1200, I chose the cheapest room type, Park Hyatt wins.

The room is spacious and the bedding is comfortable. The round table is very big, and you can put it down for office and tea. Facing Jiang Jing and Xiaoman Yao to work, I feel comfortable.
The flushing sound of the smart sensor toilet in the bathroom is slightly loud
The rainforest shower in the shower room has good water flow and strength
The towel and bathrobe are soft, the mirror TV opposite the bathtub can watch TV while soaking in the bath, and the walk-in cloakroom is enough. Slippers are a little ordinary.
The hotel is full of modern design. The front desk and restaurant can overlook the Guangzhou skyline. It is worth seeing during the day and night.
The key point I want to say is that Park Hyatt's five-star service is too intimate. I hope that all hotels will take this as a standard, so that guests can feel spoiled.
Miss MIA at the front desk was very considerate to upgrade my city view to a river view room when I checked in. In addition to the welcome fruit plate, I added sugar water
The next day, I tried to discuss with the hotel to delay the check-out at 12:00, and it was very refreshing to extend it to 14:30.
The hotel's toiletries are a niche high-end brand, which is very easy to use. I had the cheek to call and ask if I could send me a set to take away, and I gave it.
In short, a pleasant stay, strongly recommended, see you next time.

The room was upgraded, and a Swiss roll was given to the room in the evening [the taste is moist, full and super delicious] The room card design of Guangzhou Park Hyatt is very characteristic of local culture, so I also asked for a suite of cards as a souvenir.
I also experienced the Roof bar during my stay. Several cocktails in the special wine list are very good, and the scenery is also very good [Picture 3] The facial trea**ent and body massage of the hotel's own spa are also very comfortable, and I should come again~

The hotel is a basic renovation of an office building, and the sound insulation of the rooms is not very good because the facade is made of steel frame glass without solid walls. The two drains in the bathroom were not properly placed, so two black holes were exposed; the exposed wires of the lights under the bathtub were not well hidden.

The same goes for the high-end hotel style of log-textured furniture, and I feel that Conrad will be better. I hope Park Hyatt can match the standard of Sun Bay Hotel.

msg:My impression of Park Hyatt Guangzhou is mixed.
Room type: River view room (two buffet meals, birthday cake)
shortcoming:
1⃣️The attitude of the service staff is not positive enough, and the receptionist of the doorman is not skilled or warm. Doormen are the first impression of hotel service, so they should be trained in place.
2⃣️When I checked in the hotel that day, I was sitting in the lobby bar waiting for my friends. At that time, the lady at work told me that it was a consumption area, but it was okay to wait for someone, and I also had coffee in my hand at that time. When I checked out the next day, I was waiting for my car with coffee, and the lady came over and told me that I could not take outside things here. So why is it possible on the first day and not on the second day? Is it because I didn't spend here the next day 😅
3⃣️The sound inventory in the guest room is not enough. I called the guest service at three or four o'clock on the day I checked in, after 8 o'clock in the evening and 10 o'clock in the evening, and at 9 o'clock in the morning of the next day. …Shouldn’t every room in this class of hotel have a stereo…
4⃣️The carpet in the guest room area is stained, and the sanitary corners inside the room are not cleaned enough.
5⃣️ The staff at the front desk were not proactive enough, and did not introduce each area and floor in detail. For example, the gym and swimming pool had to ask before telling them which floor they were on.
6⃣️ There is no introduction of coffee in the minibar.
advantage:
1⃣️The room is very beautiful and comfortable. This is the best feeling I have ever stayed in a thousand-yuan hotel in Guangzhou. The matching things are also complete, and it is also a big brand. (The magnificent is very stingy), and the view of the room is very good (I told the front desk to face the west side of the river view, because the east side is pressed by the east and west towers and feels very depressing).
2⃣️Room Service responds quickly.
3⃣️The decoration of the hotel reveals the heritage of Lingnan everywhere, it feels like living in a museum. The scent is also very comfortable and very safe.
4⃣️The swimming pool is the most comfortable in the hotel I have stayed in, and the number of people is strictly controlled, so it is really enjoyable.
5⃣️ The birthday cake was very delicious, the room card is very beautiful, I specially asked for a set from the front desk.
Summary: The experience is still very good. Compared with Magnificent, I think Park Hyatt is more cost-effective. At least I think it's worth it this time. Park Hyatt's style is worth revisiting and tasting slowly, but humanistic care and service need to be improved.

The front desk said that there are many guests in the hotel, and the receptionist at the door said that a lot of guests have left in the past few days. listen to who. Regardless of the number of guests, the hotel requires guests to check in at three o'clock, so we came after three o'clock. You don't have a room to talk about. In the breakfast room the next day, there may be a guest who is unwell and makes a loud noise similar to howling. It greatly reduces the dining experience.

If you like wooden furniture, you will definitely love Park Hyatt. Breakfast is not big, but it is better than the high-quality 70F bar. The wine is also good. Cocktails 🍹150+ outdoor landscape Invincible, unfortunately, the heavy rain in Guangzhou is looking forward to the next stay


🔔Service: worthy of praise, one word of service is fast!

Opinion: I was a little anxious when I checked out, and I dropped a pair of headphones. Can I pay attention to the headphones and call me after I communicated with the front desk? The front desk is reluctant, so I can't calculate it

The design and layout of the room is reasonable, and the window looks out of the river view and the small waist. The weather was cloudy and rainy, and the photo was a little blurry. The toiletries are labo, which is a bit of a surprise. I prefer their perfumes. Heated swimming pool environment is good. After listening to a friend's recommendation for dinner, I ate at a Chinese restaurant. I booked the last table of the day. I was very lucky. The cherry foie gras and tangerine peel and red bean crisp are very good. There is also a small surprise, that is, the elevator encounters a star! Excited my husband.

msg:The first time I stayed at Park Hyatt, this time I was completely enthralled by fans! Great service from start to finish!
The main purpose of booking this is to apply for a visa, it is just opposite the US consulate, and it is very convenient to walk for 3 minutes. There are also many shopping malls nearby, and delicious restaurants and cafes are all within walking distance!
Jason Chen and Kevin Chen were very friendly during check-in and check-out. They took care of many details and upgraded our room type. On the first night's turndown service, they also gave sugar water, red bean paste in a thermos cup, and friends. It was still warm when I came back from the house. It is said to be made by the restaurant's dessert chef, and it tastes really good! When we checked out, he also kindly helped us store our luggage and put it directly on the first floor, which was very convenient when we went to pick it up. There are always refills of hand sanitizer, alcohol disinfectant wipes and masks in the room at any time, and I take care of it when I go out and bring it back for disinfection. The toiletries are all le labo, and the scent is very pleasant~
The view of the lobby bar is facing the Canton Tower. It is very good to drink tea during the day and drink at night! The terrace view of the bar on the 70th floor is also very good for the night view. There are more choices of wine than the lobby bar, and there are bands singing, which is very relaxing. Ctrip also gave a small Lancome gift box after booking, which made people feel happy from beginning to end!
The most surprising thing is that the foreman Mark Ma on the first floor also provided stamps and helped me send postcards~ It is my personal habit to send postcards to friends when I travel. Said that the hotel provides stamps and delivery services, and also helped me check the postage to different countries, and carefully distributed the stamps for me. I was really surprised and thankful! It is really reassuring that the old hotel still retains the service of such an old school~
It can be considered that I have experienced most of the services, and every detail makes people feel very comfortable ~ I will choose Park Hyatt when I come to Guangzhou in the future, and I will recommend it to my friends!

🧹Hygiene: very clean and the toiletries are the smell of le labo
🍃Environment: The location is not to be said, it is very convenient to go anywhere. The environment in the hotel is also very good. I like this decoration style
🔔Service: The staff are very enthusiastic and will help you patiently if you have any questions. When checking in, kelvin chen also sent a small snack, which is a whole caring stay.
If there is a disadvantage, the faucet on the washstand is a little long, and I am a little worried about whether it will knock when I wash my face.
Anyway, all in all, it's pretty good. I should choose here next time I come to Guangzhou👍

msg:The anniversary encountered a heavy rainstorm that has never been seen in a century, and the epidemic prevention and control policies of various provinces are really unfavorable for travel. We can only find a place to celebrate at home. I have already experienced the high ⭐ hotels in the urban area of Guangzhou. I didn’t have much in the way, and I accidentally saw the Park Hyatt River View Room package pushed by Ctrip. I thought that it would not be convenient to go out to eat in such bad weather. Although it is not a dinner, it also saves the trouble of finding a place to eat, so I settled on this place. Yanni, the young lady who helped check in, was warm and polite. Knowing that it was an anniversary, she even arranged arrangements and desserts. The most surprising thing was that she drew the illustrations by herself. Now the hotel services are so swept up 😅, please comment on the hotel, Park Hyatt's consistent style, the public areas are extremely attentive and regardless of cost, the interior of the room is simple, and small details still need to be paid attention to. There are two soap trays in it, and I wonder if I have to go back to the bathroom to wash my hands after using the toilet? Why not consider arranging one of them to go over there to the bathroom? The second is the glass plate with soap, which is exquisite and beautiful but not practical. The soap becomes soft when wet and sticks directly to the plate. It cannot be taken out for secondary use. It's a bit big, and it doesn't have as many categories as the Grand Hyatt, especially the main dishes are only grilled lamb chops and fish bean curd soup. If you don't eat beef and mutton, there are basically only two choices of cold cuts and fruits. It should be thoughtful and add one more hot meat dish as appropriate. The lounge meal is still the most meticulous and thoughtful by Rika, the combination of hot and cold meat dishes is reasonable, and the selection of drinks is also more rigorous. Generally speaking, the service is the most satisfactory, and the others are relatively inferior.

msg:Personally, I think Park Hyatt's room is quite large for a five-star hotel. It is more than 50 square meters. When you enter the door, you first pass through the bathroom, then the bathroom, the independent cloakroom, and finally the bed. There is a round table by the window. The design is very reasonable, and you feel at home when you live. I have been to Rosewood before, the room can be said to walk to the bed as soon as you enter the door, very small 😂)

My favorite is this round table. Many hotel tables are long desks. Park Hyatt's round table makes people feel very warm and is very suitable for sitting down and staring at the window while eating.
I booked a normal room type, so I didn't face Xiaoman's waist, but I could still see a little from the side...

The staff will also let me go in first and wait, saying it's too cold... very caring.
From checking in to waiting for the elevator, taking takeaways to leaving the store, every service has achieved a five-star standard, which is very valuable for the current service industry.

msg:I have been to the self-service Heyue Bar before, and I like the high-altitude landscape of the public area and the design of the bird's nest. This time I came here specially. The style of the corridor in the guest room is relatively dark, the space in the room is not too large and more than 50 square meters, the wood simple tone ➕ Chinese hollow decorative background wall, the a**osphere is plain style. The check-in experience is very good. The double breakfast and dinner included in the hotel have surprises. The room has welcome fruits and late-night sweets. The hotel's high-altitude swimming pool is also equipped with a family hot spring and a concierge pool. The arranged river view room also sees part of the Canton Tower, which is refreshing at night and in the morning, and the years are quiet.
The hotel is fully equipped, and it is easy to bring a 16-month-old son. In addition to the BB bed and toiletries, there is a children's bathtub, which can be slowly soaked in the bathtub. Children's tableware and dining chairs are also readily available. The overall process has a high sense of comfort, there is a feeling of moisturizing and silent, and I spent a pleasant weekend. Special thanks to Tony at the front desk for her patient service and Clara's warm care.

msg:The five-star hotel in Zhujiang New Town, the hotel is actually quite new, and the room space is quite large. My favorite is the design of the bathtub. You can see the TV in the open style and take a bath🛀, which is very comfortable, and the service is average. There are not too many smiles to greet customers, no special reminders, and no other special warm services. It is quite satisfactory, I always feel that the five-star hotel in Zhujiang New Town is not as humane as the old Guangzhou hotel, I don’t know why? The price of the hotel is much more expensive than others. Including the Michelin restaurant Yuejingxuan, the dishes are simple and there are few choices, there are not too many innovative dishes, and the taste of the dishes is still a bit bitter. That is to say, it was flat, and there were no special highlights. And when I left the hotel, I accidentally left a hair clip, and the hotel waiter did not contact me. Anyway, it was a little troublesome to go to the hotel for 100 yuan.

msg:1 5720 Room linen hygiene is not up to standard, with black marks on it

2 The quilt spread is looser than the last stay

There was a problem with the room. The housekeeping manager asked me if I had dinner. I guess they would have to clean the room again. Then they left the room and went to the front desk. After learning about it, they asked me to sit in the lobby bar. The front desk took me to the coffee shop and left.

Question 3 During this period, no staff came to ask, even if it’s a glass of lemonade.

4 Lobby bar There are oil stains and water stains on the table, as well as unidentified solid particles on the table

It can be seen that Guangzhou Park Hyatt has been a bit slack in hygiene recently

Waiting for the room... I can understand it for about 1 hour. It may be well prepared. The hotel also said that it is in deep cleaning.

5 Come to my new room 5601. The table and chairs next to the dining table are not clean. The table has the mark of the water glass left by the upper guest. I wonder if I can’t wipe it off. Try to use the alcohol cotton next to it to clean it up. I can’t help but wipe it off. Do you think the dining table in the guest room has been wiped?

A room manager at the front desk was in room 5601, smugly saying that this room has been thoroughly cleaned, including all buttons that have been disinfected with alcohol. He was quite confident. Next, in the witness of all of us:

6 I received a yellow on the chair under the dining table. It may be the residue of potato chips. The upper guest left a large mark on the chair, indicating that he has used this chair. This chair must be a little away from the dining table before cleaning to accommodate another person. Sit in the room staff when they cleaned and pushed back under the dining table, didn't they see the large debris on it? Did the room supervisor just check the room? The room where I waited for an hour had a major hygiene problem, even if the Hanting Hotel at home would not appear, I found it in this dirty Baiyue.

Waiting for the room for close to an hour, I can assume that it is being cleaned again, and you will also talk about deep cleaning from beginning to end, but is this really the case?


Talk about service

7 A front desk employee came in and said, "Buy me a good comment when it's troublesome to leave?" Park Hyatt. Don't you think this is wrong? If the guest hasn’t checked in yet, what do you ask the customer to do and upgrade the room type as a condition. It is clearly stated in Ctrip that the membership rights can be upgraded for free.
The true evaluation is good or bad depends on what kind of experience Park Hyatt brings to customers... not just the 5-star reviews

8 After being taken to the lobby bar by the front desk, everyone ignored me
 Then I was invited to the Chinese restaurant. The staff there asked me to sit on the outermost place where people came and went, facing away from the wind, and I offered to change to the inside. All sorts of prevarications. Do I have that excess?

10 Then the hotel again proposed to upgrade the room type to 6001. The third room in the room was full of smoke. I asked her to take off the mask. The manager also emphasized that this is a non-smoking room... The non-smoking room is full of smoke? Do you not clean it up? Manager At this time, it is useful to say that the angle of this room is good and the scenery is good. Room 6001 feels a bit like a bar, full of smoke
 
Change the room to three rooms

11 Front and back front desk manager has a black face all the time, speaks quickly, talks up, and reverses black and white. Wong, the manager surnamed me, also raised questions and doubts why you have a problem with your hotel, why do other people have no problems?

12 There is no soap in the living room and toilet

13 Suspected camera

14 Many oil stains on the sink

15 Guangzhou Park Hyatt is still actively providing disposable items such as toothbrushes!

16 The paint on the breakfast spoon has fallen off the scum

9. When the hygienic condition of room 5720 appeared, I offered to present a breakfast as compensation. After I went into a new room again and saw 6001 when there was a more serious hygienic problem, I asked whether I could drop off the airport for free and the hotel finally gave the request. Charge 450 yuan? Ctrip luxury car is only 284 at the same time? I don’t want this car, but what I want to see from these things is the attitude the hotel can show. Then another depar**ent manager asked for a discount of 50 and also said that this is already a special application... (In fact, it is a health problem in a depar**ent within the hotel, and another depar**ent does not want to pay for this depar**ent, and the depar**ents are not coordinated)
After Ctrip learned about the airport 450, they immediately raised this part of the cost. They are responsible for the hotel’s own sanitary service. The sanitary service is messed up. The sanitation of the room is not as good as one. Business? I'm asking for compensation. Looking at you for a road of more than 20 kilometers, it is 20 yuan per kilometer? This is no longer a question of how much money is, but how *** this hotel is

msg:I booked a Park Hyatt Garden View room, but was upgraded to a Park Hyatt River View room when I checked in. I could see the beautiful view of the Pearl River, which was great value and amazing! When I went to the hotel restaurant the next day, the waiter helped me order the meal and asked me what to avoid. I said: green beans, cane sugar, black tea. When I drank the conch slice olive soup, I ate two bites and found scallops, so I told the waiter that I forgot to say that I was allergic to scallops. . . He said it's okay, we will return this dish for you. . When adding dumplings for me, they told me the ingredients very carefully. The service details are very good!

msg:I stayed on a business trip for the third time. The hotel was very satisfied, as always, but this time it was very unpleasant. There was a stupid couple living next door. They started quarreling at 4 or 5 in the morning and quarreled at 6 in the morning. They immediately woke up and couldn't sleep. This quality makes people speechless. I had to catch a plane in the morning and slept for 4 hours a night. I couldn't fall asleep after waking up.

msg:Since Mr. Liang Jianzhang, CEO of Ctrip, recommends to experience Guangzhou Park Hyatt Hotel, he also mentioned that some rooms can see the famous building Canton Tower, (nicknamed Xiaomanyao) may wish to experience it. Stepping into the lobby on the 65th floor, it is like entering an art gallery. Logs, blue bricks, stone bodies, threshold windows, and exquisite sculptures, under soft lighting, present the essence of Lingnan architecture. Staying on the 56th floor in the landscape room, you can see the Guangzhou Tower in the blue sky during the day and the erratic white clouds. At night, the Guangzhou Tower is amazed by the ever-changing colors. Swimming on the 65th floor seems to be connected to the sky, overlooking the slow flowing of the Pearl River, the boats on the river, and the grassy meadows on the river bank. It is refreshing and happy, and I can't help but want to raise a wine glass to enjoy the wine. The room’s facilities configuration is very good: the world’s top ten mattress brand American Simmons mattress, founded in 1870, touch adjustable light source, 100-year-old Japanese TOTO full smart toilet, double independent bath basin, a full set of well-known bath brand BRGAOTE22, The art furnishings in the room are also pleasing to the eye. There are currently four Black Pearl Two Diamond restaurants in Guangzhou. Yue Jing Xuan restaurant on the 68th floor of the hotel is one of them. The Park Hyatt Guangzhou is designed by the famous American GP Architects Co., Ltd., and the interior is designed by the Japanese design master Takashi Sugimoto who has won international awards, giving people a sense of luxury and art as a whole. Manager Hu Rong at the front desk left a deep impression on me. He was polite, smiling and whispering to introduce the hotel’s various services, which gave us a deeper understanding of the hotel. The Park Hyatt Hotel’s hardware facilities and software services complement each other. The high-end hotel, I have told my friends to go to Guangzhou to experience it.

The rooms are well-equipped, quiet in the middle of the noisy, facing the Canton Tower outside the window, with unobstructed views of the city.

In the evening, I ate in the 65 Yue Hall of the hotel. It was amazing. In addition to the buffet section, you can also order a main course. The lamb chops you ordered were very delicious and the drinks were all-you-can-drink. The experience exceeded expectations.

Park Hyatt’s service is very attentive, the hotel staff are very kind and professional, and I will stay here again next time.

msg:Let me spit it out. As the highest level of the Hyatt Group, Guangzhou Park Hyatt is a bit sorry for this brand. The sound insulation is really bad. The partition between the room should be made of wood/decorative panels. The first night The crazy cry of the woman next door is imaginative, and the talk between the two men next door and the sound of the TV can be heard clearly on the second night~ The hotel’s air conditioner is still very noisy when the wind speed is set to the minimum. Sleeping can only be thorough. It’s turned off~ The noise of the mini bar is also the most outrageous of all the 5-star hotels I have stayed in. I had to unplug the power socket~ In addition, on the third night I went to the bar on the 70th floor, and the man at the door said outdoor There was no seat. After we went in, we saw a lot of empty sofa seats outside. We asked the waiter outside but said we could sit~
Besides, the housekeeper is nicer, and will also fold clothes for the guests~ The tower view room has a good view, facing the waist of Xiaoman, I just feel that the light-on time has been shortened because of the shortage of electricity in the country?
Oh, yes, Park Hyatt’s lobby is very low-key, similar to Mandarin Oriental~ I still like the a**ospheric style of the four seasons~

The overall experience is worth the price. The scenery outside the window is beautiful. The downside is that the design of the guest room is quite satisfactory. The style of the TV and the mini bar cabinet is a bit strange. People with more cushions on the sofa cannot sit down. The oblique light in the room is very dangerous. It is especially easy to bump your head when you stand up after using the computer several times. It is recommended to remove.

After that, there is the Yue Bar on the 70th floor of the hotel. The open-air location is really cool. You must book well in advance and you will not regret it! The last is breakfast.

After check-in, the guest room is well decorated, but the air-conditioning fan is abnormally loud. After the minimum wind is turned off, you can still hear it. After reporting to the hotel, I learned that most rooms are like this. Because there is no time to change rooms, I chose to use earplugs. . Fan noise is a problem that shouldn't occur. The embarrassing thing is that the wind is still hot when it is turned off, which leads to lack of sleep that night. It is worth mentioning that the swimming pool is not only tastefully decorated, but also clean and comfortable, with first-class views, and the waiters are also very polite. Finally, it has the level of a first-class hotel.

🧹Sanitation: The lobby, guest rooms, restaurants and swimming pools of the hotel are clean and hygienic. The toilet in my favorite guest room is separate from the toilet, and the toilet and curtains are fully automatic. The toiletries provided in the guest rooms smell fragrant.
🔔Service: The waiters are warm and polite. Will send check-in fruit. On the day of check-in, the hotel helped decorate the room and gave a very delicious birthday cake. What's touching is that the birthday cake is not perfunctory at all, it is packed in a beautiful box, and the chocolate flavor is very rich and silky. I think the Park Hyatt Hotel in Guangzhou is a five-star hotel with a good price/performance ratio. More than 1,000 room rates include breakfast and dinner at a very discount. Ctrip's preferential activities are also very powerful. All in all, this stay is very happy and satisfied.

The strangest thing is that in the lobby on the first floor, those Internet celebrities who look like monsters dominate the elevator to take photos, and the hotel security will not drive them away, but the residents cannot use it normally! This sense of experience alone disgusts me! It is totally inconsistent with the service management quality of a five-star hotel. Need to complain to the hotel staff to resolve
The welcome fruit is not prepared in advance, so you have to call and ask in person.
The sanitation of the room is still acceptable, but the mattress is very soft, and my back hurts until I slept.
I hope the hotel should still pay attention to its own image, and don’t take photos of too many messy internet celebrities. This will only lower the grade and seriously affect the guest’s experience.

The buffet breakfast is also average, not many types. The river view room I booked was a room on the 55th floor far away from the river view. I said that an additional 230 yuan would be needed to have a room with a higher view and a better view. The soundproofing was fine when I checked in. No other noise was heard, but the central air conditioner was a bit noisy and the cooling was not fast. The attitude of the waiter encountered was okay. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is not high, which is not in line with this positioning.

msg:Generally, I choose Four Seasons Hotel and Rosewood. I stayed at Park Hyatt for two days. The service experience of the tower view room was too bad. I refreshed the room card twice and couldn't open the door. I waited at the door of the room for twenty minutes and called Ctrip to solve the problem. Ctrip's service is very good, and the processing speed is fast, but Park Hyatt needs to improve, and the facilities are good, but the buffet is much worse than the four seasons magnificent, you get what you pay Well, I hope to improve in the future.

And because of the wine tasting, I took 4 ice buckets, 4 mineral water (I gave me a box of 24 bottles directly), 2 red wine glasses, including asking them to help me clean my own decanter and There is no complaint in the red wine glass. Good service is available in many places, but it is a matter of persistence. thank you all.
🍃Environment: Changing the elevator is indeed less troublesome. But the scenery along the way is good. The furnishings of the rooms are not luxurious, but very warm. Things are always in a very "hands-on" position.
🧹Sanitation: Sanitation is still good. Especially because I have guests coming over, and I asked them to help me clean my utensils very clean.
🚗 Transportation: Located in the center. Walk for about 10 minutes to K11, and about 5 minutes to Friendship National Gold (West Tower). But the car is very congested.
There are many good hotels in Guangzhou. This kind of considerate service is the reason why I will visit again.

Good location, good room orientation, good room facilities

But the software (service) is surprising
After taking a shower, I found that the razor in the room was used by the previous guest; the cotton box was full of water stains; the facial tissues were not a whole box, and a few sheets would be empty; call room service for laundry Bag box tote bag, only delivered in 55 minutes...

The most excessive thing is that the position of the towel bucket is extremely unreasonable. There is an iron frame on the bucket, and the corners are very sharp, so the hand bleeds directly! Ask for band-aids with room service, and the guest room says to send two bath towels!

Also Park Hyatt, Beijing Park Hyatt is very good in these details, I feel that Guangzhou Park Hyatt’s service is not as good as other Hyatt Group brands, such as Grand Hyatt😒

Only after I landed in Guangzhou, I called on the road. I dialed three 5 stars nearby. The service attitude of the front desk on the Park Hyatt phone was very good. The success attracted me to place an order immediately and go directly to the hotel. Check in at the front desk, Miss Thea Tang actually took the initiative to ask you if you were Mr. Li who called before, right? Everything is ready for the room, and what needs to be set up. The journey of the epidemic and the typhoon will immediately become much warmer. And answered many of my questions and needs one by one.
It was really a very satisfying stay. This is my first time in Guangzhou and staying at Park Hyatt, but I believe there is no reason for me to stay in another home in the future. Hope the hotel maintains a high standard of service. Thanks Thea.

Oh, the view of P.S. Hotel is really great, there are also internet celebrity restaurants and internet celebrity bars. It's just that the workers don't have the opportunity and time to experience it. I took a few photos for your reference.

msg:This year’s birthday is rare to spend in Guangzhou. After comparing the Four Seasons, Park Hyatt chose Park Hyatt. I booked it half a month in advance and called me to inform me that I was there for my birthday. The guest room was very thoughtfully furnished with birthday decorations, but only decorations. There was not even a box of snacks in the comment area, which was a bit disappointing.
At 10.30 in the evening, the hotel manager on duty entered the room to inform the visitor that he needed to leave. After we all said that we would cooperate with the work and leave immediately, the manager still stood in the room to supervise us until everyone left. I feel that privacy has been violated. If we wait at the door will be better. The lady at the switchboard is very nice, as long as it is not particularly excessive, I will basically meet the free and delayed check out until 1 o’clock, but the delivery speed of the room is a bit slow, and I waited for a bath towel for almost 30 minutes.
The room included double breakfast, but I ordered another breakfast because I couldn't get up. The taste of wonton noodles and dim sum is very ordinary to me as a local.

The decoration is Jian Su art design. It is a clean stream of luxury hotels. The swimming pool is invincible in Guangzhou. Glance at the bottom of the mountains. The service in the Italian restaurant is more intimate. Consult the taste and softness according to customer needs. Room cleaning needs to be improved. The parking lot is relatively weak compared to the hotel area, and there is no good guide and prompt, it is easy to go to B4. It is recommended to add luminous word guidelines.

The downside is that the soundproofing of the room is really not good and needs to be improved.

Special praise to the front desk suise zhou, a colleague who can make customers feel at home. The two colleagues in the fitness pool are also very enthusiastic. He also said to help us take the baby and let us go swimming. Although this is the case, I am still a little worried. When I came back after changing my clothes, I found that the handsome guy helped my wife move the stroller to the swimming pool. It was very good, and the room was also very careful. With baby supplies, I went to the food and beverage depar**ent. The products are generally good. First of all, I said that the way of chatting with customers in the buffet light meal needs to be changed. When I came here, I said that I can't wear slippers here. I am forced to have no choice for tomorrow's breakfast. I had to go back to my room to change my shoes. At that time, I really wanted to scold that wearing slippers is not suitable for dining. The next day was not the same. There were guests who wore slippers that night. They dined at the Yue Restaurant that night, although there were not many products. At that time, I wanted to order a steak. As a result, the waiter didn't have time to do anything. I immediately changed to a western restaurant for dinner. The woman in black clothes should be the manager and said that she would arrange for me to sit by the window. As a result, I was fully booked, but the service attitude was good. I ordered the steak and it was delicious and tender. Second My wife is also very satisfied with the daily breakfast. I feel very satisfied. I suggest GSM not to just stand in the lobby and say hello. In fact, if you have time, you can chat with the guests and ask the guests how they feel about staying in the hotel. You can also ask the guests' opinions when you check out. Before the guests leave, you can vent and give your opinions. The food and beverage depar**ent suggests changing the way of communication. Otherwise, it will be too easy to provoke complaints from guests. I wanted to give a bad review. Will come again and bring some souvenirs to my colleagues at the front desk

説説缺點：1.空調太吵，開着空調難以入睡。2.走廊地毯很臟，就是那種看着洗不掉的污漬，很膈應。3.房間裏的全自動馬桶，真的沒有必要，沖馬桶時無法蓋上馬桶蓋，讓我很不能接受。還有馬桶邊上的垃圾桶，帶蓋的，還要用腳踩才能打開，自己腦補這畫面吧。4.台盆的水龍頭設計很不合理，洗臉的時候衹能用半邊水池，這個應該很多人提過吧。5.房間隔音不行，隔壁人聊天都能聽見。
本來衝著柏悦住的，住下來有點失望。

服務：首先非常感謝skylar姐姐全程無微不至的服務。入住前就加了微信確認喜好，入住過程中的所有問題都能迅速且妥善地解答和處理。其次酒店裡所有的客房服務人員，餐廳服務員和門僮態度都很友好而且服務時會面帶笑容，這點會讓人感覺很親切。

環境：是中式嶺南風的設計，如果喜歡歐式奢華裝飾的可能會覺着有點素，但是踩在了本人喜好點上，喜歡簡雅設計的十分推薦入住。總體來説可能會更適合家庭旅行和商務旅行。

衞生：具有五星級酒店應有的標準
早餐：類別很豐盛，中式（多為廣式）西式都有，味道很好。
但仍然感覺有一些小問題：
1.設施問題：例如説電視機和浴室屏幕都是不能投屏的，迷你吧的冰箱有點小。
2.早餐在人多的時候上菜有些混亂，會上錯菜。
但總體來説是一次非常好的體驗

msg:廣州柏悦酒店環境優雅典雅怡人，將現代與經典活力與寧靜巧妙融入酒店設計中，酒店裡處處洋溢着濃郁的藝術構造，充滿古典浪漫得色彩，讓客人暢想奢華精美的同時，也能感受到家一般的温暖舒適。周邊配套的商場K11，逛街購物咖啡餐廳應有盡有交通便利，恆温泳池我跟家人都很喜歡。這裏提到一下Abby小姐姐，在我辦理入住等待房間時送了我巧克力，口味綿軟香甜我很喜歡，看我帶了小朋友就準備了小童洗護還有幾瓶洗護小樣送來給我，臨近聖誕節還準備了可愛的小熊掛件跟聖誕小襪子送給我們，看到我們是三個人也有問我水果夠不夠吃是否需要加一些的話，晚上又送來了精美的瑞士捲跟一壺糖水給我們享用，這次住的我很開心，正如她卡片上寫的給我留下了一個美好的柏悦記憶。

塔景房就那樣吧，入住太晚遺憾沒有住到一個視角更正中的房間，我這間衹能説是擦邊看到。
服務都挺好的，遇到的工作人員都很專業。比較多人入住，希望可以在退房高峯期分出一個櫃枱處理退房。
另外酒店的地下停車場有異味，下水道的味道一直瀰漫著，通往酒店地下電梯間入口也設計地很隨便，起碼可以搞個自動玻璃門分隔一下，然後在電梯間噴點香水掩蓋下。

msg:到了廣州落地前一家酒店後，因為設施、房間、服務等均不滿意，所以臨時攜程上改的訂單。不愧是CBD核心地段，毗鄰IFS、高德置地中心、大劇院，地理位置相當好，出行方便，地鐵口大概走路2分鐘，叫車也方便。
到酒店一樓，帥氣小哥哥就會幫你拿好行李，直接去65樓辦理入住就好。辦理入住時，前台小姐姐會跟你確認訂單，因為廣交會期間客房非常滿，所以這次是付費升級了一個江景房和一個塔景房，同時再後一晚+了兩份早飯。
廣交會人是非常多啊，但是酒店總體服務人員的安排、管理也是比較好的，同時健身房、泳池去的時候正好沒有客人，健身房風景很不錯哦。
早點是離店前吃的，服務員小姐姐會積極幫忙安排好座位，同時詢問需要的飲料。早飯種類可選擇項相對來説少一點，有一部分是需要人工點單的。雖然種類少，但不影響好吃啊，基本沒有踩雷的，最推薦就是可頌，酥脆的不行。
離店的時候問前台kevin chen小哥哥要了一份洗護套裝，也答應了我這無理的要求。
有一點點做的不足的是，塔景房的玻璃外面不是很乾凈，有很多污垢，需要加強哦！
總體而言很滿意啦，就是廣交會讓房價漲價太多啦，下次廣州來還會光顧的。

整體服務讓人滿意，管家Skylar熱情周到，能滿足個性化需求。
早餐優質，牛腩麪和麪包好吃，入住送的晚安甜品陳皮紅豆沙很不錯。

體驗還可以～但是可以更好～
1、入住前一天晚上酒店打來電話，確認入住。（詢問能否面對廣州塔，告知園景房，看的是城市，哈哈，升級失敗～）
2、一點左右到，入住超級快，可以説簽了名字馬上拿房卡！不過沒有歡迎飲料，歡迎小點心
3、房間還不錯，乾濕分離智能馬桶，超級贊。
評論裏説會送糖水和瑞士捲，等了很久也沒有，哈哈，純路人體驗了～
4、spa400元券衹能抵用一小時以上消費，最便宜的項目至少你還得付一大半…
5、泳池人很少，每晚七點廣州塔開燈，可以在游泳看。有蒸汽房！
6、評論説退房有小禮物，伴手禮。期待了一下可是啥也沒給，哈哈～
7、別的五星都可以兩點延遲退房，這家衹能一點。可以理解。
8、打電話加早餐，説要288，我主動問了可以用180的團購券嗎？前台説那就算你170吧！有點emmmm……特地提一下：評論裏説早餐豐盛的，是沒吃過早餐嗎…

服務：早餐廳服務欠佳，客流高峯要等位貌似街坊的早茶餐廳， 問題是等位浪費的時間酒店不Care， 到點立即收拾餐食，客人必須快速地吃完。這個不太符合5星酒店的服務舉措。

msg:房間淋浴間水温時冷時熱、房間全天可清晰的聽到，不定時發出有“咚”的聲音、座機電話用不了、沒有個性化服，退房後，在前台左手邊大堂吧的沙發上坐着，看廣州塔，沒多一會，有位女士工作人員挺瘦小的，問我是幹嘛的？還特意提醒我，我坐的位置是餐廳，意思是消費才可以坐，我當時尋思，我真閑着沒事，來這裏蹭wiFi蹭空調嗎！這裏坐着那麼多人沒去問，隔壁一對男女坐得比我還久呢，就偏偏問我，這不明擺着在趕我走嘛！看我手提一個帆布袋，穿一條大襠短褲，—件掉色的T恤，用古代一句話，這是不是*****呢？！唯一有態度有禮貌有熱情的是一樓禮賓他們，見到每個人都笑臉相迎，甚至坐在車上拿出行李牌，他都可以幫你去取行李

msg:房間設施低調的奢華，全實木的裝飾，到處的木雕據説都有意義，65層大堂的景色很好，70層bar稍擁擠。
迷你吧及小食:滿滿飲料和小食。
400元SPA代金券:水療中心很大，每個房間設施齊備，浴巾和蓋毯太舒適了。手法不錯，值得體驗。
幾個點值得改進：凌晨1點前台電話無人接聽；諮詢bar時，未告知樂隊時間和廣州塔亮燈時間，後來10點半過去時，都沒了。

早餐：雖然種類不算很多，但品質很不錯，比一般五星級酒店確實好不少；
設施：游泳池算是半開放的，而且可以看到廣州塔和珠江夜景，水温對小朋友比較友好。房間設施及服務也很ok，有咖啡機😀
電梯不能直達房間，每次都要去lobby中轉，如果從車庫上來還要在一層多種轉一次。千萬不要在工作日高峯期幻想拿着箱子坐3號線去機場，簡直噩夢。非常感謝Alex和Jennifer的幫助😃

辦理入住前台人員（至少 2 人，別甩鍋給新員工，就是管理不作為）業務知識掌握的“不熟練”，在升房、加床方便的報價胡亂，報了兩三次價格，想賺外快就直説。我既然能訂的起這兩間房，也差不差一百二百的，但是客人不傻阿～酒店作為一個城市的明信片，這樣確實不好。

環境:  環境也很好，雖然住的是江景套房，但還是能看到小蠻腰的!!
設施:設施維護的都非常好，其實入住之前還是有點擔心的哈哈，但是一點都不像開業了八年的樣子!!設施維護的都很nice嗷房間內都是木質打造，也是我喜歡的日本設計師！
衞生:  室內的衞生都打掃的很乾凈，服務人員也都提前在床邊、浴室鋪上了腳墊防止滑倒，也都主動給鋪了夜床，就很貼心!但唯一的一點就是窗外的玻璃確實是有一點點臟啦哈哈哈哈，晚上看夜 是一點不影響噠，就是白天會有一些明顯～總的來説，這次的住宿體驗非常非常的滿意，比其他超五星酒店都更讓人舒服，早餐出品很好吃～
不管是其他工作人員的貼心服務，還是酒店的設施環境、風景，都是絕絕子哈哈哈!推薦大家來住受一下!!!
地點：位於廣州珠江新城CBD，樓下就是K11花城廣場，距離太古滙衹有一公里工作的距離!吃喝玩樂city walk 應有盡有噠啦～ 大家可以來體驗一下～

msg:定酒店一直的標準是年份新一點，環境硬件好，服務好，所以選了一下定了柏悦，但是住的不是很順心。
先吐槽一下攜程，定完酒店，正好看到是攜程的金鑽客户，有蠻多權益（免費升級房型，積分換早餐等）於是諮詢了一下，攜程“態度很好”馬上要去和酒店協調，實則是甩鍋給酒店，一通溝通下來是都不能享受，其實我看了下越好的酒店越不會參與這些攜程的權益活動，我都不知道攜程為什麼要去做無用功的溝通。
然後辦理入住的時候還要被告知一下不能免費升級房型等問題，我説我知道不用升級。就此入住就發生幾件奇葩事情，先是燒水壺燒到一半不燒了，於是以為是水壺壞了，客房換了新的水壺，結果試下來是電路壞了。晚上回來發現智能馬桶也不工作了，再找工程部過來看一下，也是線路問題。第二天晚上到酒店，手機充電，電路問題把手機充電插頭燒掉了，還好沒把手機燒壞。和客房聯繫了一下，説要麼換一間房，因為不想像搬家一樣再理一次行李，所以還是算了。我猜大概為了對這個事情做點補償，第二天下午聯繫説送個果盤過來，我説那就等晚上我們回酒店了再送吧。真的也不稀罕你們這三個水果，也不差錢去買這幾個東西，直到晚上9:40送過來，送過來時説因為我們房間開的是免打擾模式所以就走了！那麼我打電話給客房送紙巾等用品過來的時候，人家不是敲門送的嗎？
ps：酒店的洗漱台盆設計真的，連洗臉都很不方便，誰用誰知道！洗澡水温不是很穩定，水也不大，隔音不太好。其他服務倒其實還好，響應也蠻快的。
真的好幾年沒有寫過這種小作文了～入住三天感覺稍微不太好，才會寫點評，希望以後寫點評的機會能少點，至少説明入住沒問題

我們帶寶寶入住，安排了一間無煙房，但是房間煙味很重，要求換房，在房間等了二十多分鐘才來人幫忙換房。第一間房有櫃門關不嚴，該維修了。

退房的時候看我們推着寶寶車，Skylar接待的，很熱情，住了一天終於感受到這裡是柏悦。

整體上感覺這不是柏悦該有的水準。

廣州這間柏悦真的毫無記憶點，印象最深的估計就是走道地毯上一塊塊的污漬。如果不是在附近辦事一定是不會再選擇了。排除地理位置優勢，價格上下兩三百範圍內都有更新更好的選擇。
SPA倒是推薦的，價格適中，技師手法力道都算不錯。
