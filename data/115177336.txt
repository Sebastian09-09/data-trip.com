msg:The hotel is in an alley, the parking lot is a bit far away, more than 200 meters, and you have to cross a traffic light. It seems not easy! It is close to Dongguan Street, about 300 meters through the alley. The hotel is a salt merchant's house, which is really beautiful. The room feels a bit depressing. It's hot without air conditioning! The quilt is also thick. It's a bit cold with air conditioning, and the noise is a bit loud.
The breakfast has the taste of Yangzhou morning tea. The place for afternoon tea, the courtyard, the hostess is warm and generous, and it feels good!
I arrived at five o'clock, and until the next morning, I only saw a little girl at the front desk, and it was Friday.

msg:Yangzhou B&B brings endless surprises

During the 24h Special Forces trip in Yangzhou, I stayed at the awesome Reconstruction·Ice Ou Pavilion. The food, accommodation, travel and entertainment facilities are all excellent. I don't want to check out at all!

🛌The Ice Ou Pavilion itself was rebuilt from an old house in the Qing Dynasty, so it is named "Reconstruction·Ice Ou Pavilion". Entering the Ice Ou Pavilion, you can see water, pine, bamboo, stone, calligraphy and painting, which constitute the ancient and a**ospheric sense of Chinese style. It is no exaggeration to call it a step-by-step scene. This is the first surprise. The original building was built in the form of a quadrangle. Each small courtyard also has a separate landscape, with a sense of winding paths. Checking in is like returning to your own garden in Jiangnan, and the experience is excellent. The room furnishings are exquisite and simple, showing taste, and are also equipped with professional tea sets. You can enjoy the leisure of tea tasting without going to the teahouse.
📍The location of the Ice Ou Pavilion is at the southeast corner of Dongguan Street, and it takes about 20 minutes to get there by taxi from the railway station. To the south of the road is Pishi Street. A few hundred meters to the west is Caiyi Street. Attractions such as Heyuan, Geyuan, and Slender West Lake can be reached on foot, which is very convenient. There are restaurants, specialty shops, lacquer fan workshops, etc. at the entrance of the hotel. If you don't go far, you can fully experience the slow life of Yangzhou by strolling at the door of your home. This is the second surprise.
🍜The next morning, I wanted to go out to experience the morning tea culture, but I saw that the breakfast menu of the hotel's own restaurant, Bingou Pavilion·Xiyan, almost included all the special dishes of Yangzhou morning tea (what I want to eat). I decided to experience the hotel's breakfast first, but I didn't expect it to be the third surprise. The breakfast of Xiyan is not the common buffet style of the hotel but a fixed menu, including green Yangchun tea, three-piece buns, thousand-layer oil cakes, hot dried silk, black vinegar sauce crystal meat, shrimp roe wontons and other dishes. It can be said that everything you should eat is included, and the taste is also excellent, especially the soup of shrimp roe wontons, which has to be filled with eyebrows after drinking. The dining environment of Xiyan is also very quiet, with exquisite landscapes in every corner, unlike the noisy teahouses outside. In this way, having breakfast at Xiyan has become a cost-effective choice to experience the Yangzhou morning tea culture.
📱The hotel also has a dedicated butler. If you have any questions, send WeChat and the response speed is also very fast. Overall, it is a perfect hotel experience!

The housekeeper service is very thoughtful. We took the wrong road at the beginning and waited for us at the door for a long time. The hotel's restaurant is also very good. I strongly recommend fried hairtail. It is worth staying here to experience the characteristics of Yangzhou.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good in the downtown area, very close to various attractions. The yellow car at the door is a good choice for you to go out. It takes only 10 minutes to go to Heyuan, Geyuan, Siwangting, and the yellow car. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to Dongguan Street. It is very convenient to go out for snacks at night. Although it is in the downtown area, it is extremely quiet, and you can wake up naturally. After visiting the scenic spots, I found that the scenery of the hotel is better than the scenic spots. From the beginning of the door, it is a surprise all the way. The antique buildings add more Chinese aesthetic details on the basis of retaining the original houses. It is the most satisfactory hotel on this trip. The two young ladies at the front desk are very enthusiastic, and the staff they met are also very polite and will take the initiative to say hello. The breakfast is also very elegant, which is in line with the temperament of the hotel. Here I have to praise the breakfast of mixed dried silk, which feels better than the fun garden I went to eat on an empty stomach the day before. After breakfast, go to the cafe for a cup of rooftop coffee. A pleasant day begins. It is very suitable for dazed reading. In short, it is quite satisfactory.

msg:A friend recommended this hotel to stay in. It is a new hotel (opened during the Chinese New Year), with a good location (Dongguan Street), a good environment (ancient house style), and good service. After checking in, I was very satisfied. First of all, the service is very good. There is a butler service from the beginning of the reservation. Concise matters were sent in advance, and there were immediate replies if there were any questions. The hotel is in a very good location, next to Dongguan Street and Pishi Street, and it is convenient to go anywhere. It is just a few steps away from the car. The environment is so good, every detail is a scene, compared to the flow of people in Geyuan and Heyuan, it is simply quiet and exquisite here, and the night view is also beautiful, and I can't stop taking pictures. Although the room I stayed in was small, the floor height was very good, the linens were comfortable, the shower water was very large and hot, and the free toiletries were super good. The most amazing thing is the breakfast. The hotel is divided into 5 major sections: accommodation, catering, cultural and creative, coffee, and tea room. In the morning, I had authentic Huaiyang morning tea, a cup of clear tea, a bowl of wonton noodles, green vegetable wraps with fresh meat buns, hot dried silk, appetizers... I came back and experienced it quietly.

In the hotel, there is a scene at every step. I feel the deep cultural heritage and care of the designer. The morning tea is also delicious. There are different packages every day. A very good accommodation experience. I will recommend it to my friends and will visit again next time I come to Yangzhou.

msg:Hygiene: It looked clean at first glance, but when I washed my hands, I saw a hair on the counter, and there were also tiny pieces of fluff that I didn't know if it was the rag or something else.
Facilities: It was renovated from a very retro old house, but the room was very unsafe. The door and bed were all floor-to-ceiling transparent glass. If you want to go out, you have to open the curtains behind the door, and then after closing the door from the outside, the curtains inside are open, and the luggage inside can be seen clearly. As for charging, I brought a USB charging cable, but it may not have good contact and it was completely unusable (I confirmed that my cable was good when I got home)
Service: The parking lot is on the opposite side of Pishi Street, which is full of pedestrians and difficult to drive in. The reservation was not written in the reservation information. He called me at work and insisted on adding WeChat before he would tell me the parking lot location. When I asked him on the phone about the parking lot address, he said he couldn't tell me clearly and had to add WeChat!
I walked to the hotel with my luggage, but no one answered after more than 200 meters. I checked in. First, they said that the public security system was offline, and asked me to take a photo with my ID card. I had to keep a photo of such a sensitive thing as my ID card? ! Seeing that I didn't want to, he said he would come back to register later, which was fine.
Then he took me to the room, first into a courtyard, and then upstairs I found that I had made a mistake with the room card and couldn't open it. He also asked me to swipe it again when I went out later. Fortunately, the waiter found it and brought it to me. This was not over yet. Just when I wanted to sit down and rest for a while, the waiter came and said that the breakfast coupon was wrong and asked me to change it... There were mistakes everywhere.
Then the next day for breakfast, my friend's family of three came first, and I thought that everything was ready, so why was there only so much? I went later, but I found that the things served were different from theirs, and then I found that the meal was not ready yet, and then I asked them to bring it to you. When I was served, I found that the tableware was not given to me. At the end of the meal, I felt that it was not ready either. I asked and found that there was a plate of side dishes that were not given. In fact, there was also fruit that was not served, so I left. I thought I would not eat it, but forget it. Anyway, the service is hard to describe, all kinds of mistakes.
There was a woman at the front desk who was very arrogant. I really didn't like the tone of her voice. She was not tall and was a little fat with a mask on. She seemed to be a small leader like a foreman. When we were about to leave, a few tourists wanted to ask about the room price and so on. Although they looked like they came from the suburbs and had no plans to stay, they might stay in the future or introduce it to friends. Then the woman ignored them and ignored them. Fortunately, a girl next to them answered.

It was quiet in the bustling city, and you wouldn't get tired of it if you stayed there all day! The only shortcoming is that the front desk staff needs to be trained more. They were too unprofessional. They sat at the front desk wearing contact lenses, talked to me while wearing them, and followed me with one of the glasses. It was too funny.

The hotel's breakfast should be in cooperation with the restaurant next door, and it is delicious.
The only small drawback is that because the room is very large, there will still be dust in some small corners, I hope to pay attention to it

Next door is Xiyan, which is very high-end and suitable for filming. Because I caught the high-speed train in the morning, I couldn't have breakfast, so the B&B gave me souvenirs.

The hotel is in a good location. The hotel entrance is very lively, but the room is very quiet. Geyuan and Dongguan Street are right at the door. After visiting Dongguan Street at night, it is not tiring to walk back and rest. It is also a short walk to Heyuan through Pishi Street. It is not far from Slender West Lake. You can get there quickly by taking a taxi.
I had a very happy stay. My parents also liked it. I will choose it next time.

冰甌館本身是由清朝鹽商老宅改建而成，外觀看上去，滿滿的老錢風😎
整個酒店的是江南園林風格，古樸大氣感，松，竹，石，水，一步一景。
我們住的小院仿照四合院形式建成，三間房共享一個院子，距離很近卻又互不打擾，體驗感極好。
房間裝修是極簡風，更顯大氣。
冰甌館的位置在東關街東南方位，再往南過個馬路就是皮市街，往西走個幾百米就到綵衣街，何園、個園都可以步行到達，非常方便。
酒店還有餐廳，茶室，咖啡館，出品都非常出彩。
酒店早餐就能體驗早茶文化，套餐菜單幾乎包含了揚州早茶的特色菜式，就餐環境也十分幽靜，每一處都是精緻造景。
提一些建議，早餐的菜單最好分A，B兩版。住兩晚的客人可以換一下菜式，不然太單調了。

msg:這次到揚州玩，住的地方超級贊👍🏻。這是一座清朝時期進士的老宅子基礎上進行的裝修，通過跟附近其他老宅對比可以發現結構、房樑、立柱等應該都是保護鑲嵌進去了。整體是木質的感覺，也能聞到實木的清香，且裝修的整體感覺很乾凈雅緻。房間裏的設備比如吹風機、化粧鏡都很好。
     遇到一個前台小姐姐又美人又好，很熱情的跟我們介紹揚州好玩的好吃的，還貼心的發了攻略。
     這次定的含早餐，本來還查攻略要去哪裡哪裡吃早茶，後來在酒店餐廳吃就非常好吃，餐廳環境好，分量足，味道也很棒👍🏻（圖二是餐廳的環境，外面是很漂亮的小花園，本來就是對外營業的）。
       整體而言很推薦這次的民宿。

msg:很棒的一家寵物友好酒店 我們這次四個人加兩衹狗住的套房 停車場離酒店有一個馬路的距離 少許有些不方便 管家會提前到停車場來接 入住之前管家會提前加上微信 空調地暖都把我們提前開好 一進房間特別暖和 酒店環境特別不錯 很適合拍照 套房有院子 房間從客廳到兩個卧室都很大 淋浴的水壓稍微有點小 酒店位置離幾個景點也很近 可以直接步行到景點

msg:來揚州玩，盲選了這家酒店，第一個👍下單後沒多久酒店前台給我打電話，加了微信核對訊息，還告訴我如果自駕還是高鐵的一些具體訊息，這個還是很貼心的.
第二個👍我記得我來的時候，前台有個上海小姐姐，可能她聽到我説的話，才知道她也是上海人，嘿嘿這個還蠻好的，他鄉遇故知，溝通起來也很方便，很快幫我辦理入住，帶我進的房間，她會告訴我有任何需要和前台聯繫，超有愛的一個上海姐姐❤️
第三個👍我被這個酒店的大堂所吸引，名副其實的鹽商大宅，雖然裝修簡易，但看得出老闆還是花過心思的，聽説還是文保單位，很多東西不能隨意改動，能改成這樣也不錯了
第4個👍地理位置也很優勢，去哪裡都很方便，出門也不用擔心不認識路。因為微信隨時可以聯繫前台，她們也會很熱心的解答，這點真的要給酒店大大的贊
第五個[心碎]早餐餐廳體驗感一般，餐廳服務員基本素質不是很好，幾次上菜要等很久，要催幾次，這點真的有待加強，其餘的我都很滿意.值得推薦

照片不能顯現它的舒適!!照片衹能選這幾張，我拍了好多，裝修風格yyds。 床特別軟，趴着很舒服。有家的感覺，衞生間也很好看裝飾的，整個名宿很大，茶社，餐廳，商店，咖啡館都很適合拍照，很出圈，名宿旁邊都有便利店餐廳，出門就是東關街，皮市街。晚上出門逛一圈還蠻熱鬧的值得姐妹們來一次!真的很不錯。

非常熱情的前台，整個入住過程愉快且放心，首先下了車就有前台小姐姐親自接待並一路帶領我們走進房間，其次映入眼簾的房間佈局很是簡約清新侘寂風格。各類設施齊全，衞生更是細緻，前台也是有問必答，非常滿意的一次入住體驗，推薦!!!
離東關街站距離真的很近，出行超級方便
如果有機會還來這座城市我想都會選擇這家民宿，因為放心，所以如一，房間位置優越，窗外景觀得天獨厚，出門便是燈紅酒綠，當然最放心的還是衞生質量，清爽乾淨，會推薦給朋友入住體驗。

msg:優點：
酒店地理位置：很不錯，步行到東關街皮市街都很近。
酒店環境：古色古香，能感受到中式庭院風格美感。
寵物友好：妥妥的寵物友好，毛孩子玩的很開心。
配套：酒店內部還有茶園，咖啡店和文創店。風格很不錯，可以體驗觀光一下，也很出片。


新店開張還是有些疏漏的地方需要改善：
1. 人員培訓不足：辦入住的時候我在攜程上訂的是帶浴缸的大床房，服務員帶我們去了一間沒有浴缸的房間。之後找到店家老闆才得以調解。
2. 房間衞生：房間大門有縫隙導致房間地面的灰有點多，客袍的廚裏也有積灰。希望店家能改善大門的縫隙還有增加清潔阿姨的清潔意識培訓。
3. 台盆水温：台盆的水温無法調節，開了熱水會很燙，再開冷水調節的話會直接變成冷水。已和店家提出，希望能儘快改善。不然冬天用水很不方便。
4.早餐：早餐是套餐沒有選擇，我們連住兩天吃的內容是一樣的。希望店家能多些選擇，不要求每天內容都要不同，但至少連住的客人能不天天吃一樣的早餐。

整體來説這家酒店在揚州還是很有優勢的，值得體驗一下，希望店家能快快完善酒店硬件軟件，有機會還會去住的。

早餐小點也不遜色，唯一不方便的沒有菜單，需要到pos機上看。酒店連通的咖啡店也很不錯，小地圖留着下次來打卡。

附近餐飲：冶春、獅子樓、小淮食大淮味、共和春、毛牌樓步行就可到達，富春茶社、大麒麟閣糕點店就在斜對面。酒店周邊還有燒烤、涮肉，等
出行一般都會選擇冰甌館，酒店設施完善，乾淨、衞生、安全。酒店服務工作人員專業、熱情，辦理入住的同時會有温馨提示、出行建議攻略，初次遊揚州的客人會很方便。謝謝酒店工作人員提供的服務，祝越來越好，下次來揚州還會住冰甌館

msg:東關街新開的民宿，有一定文化底藴，也花了很大心思在改造、裝修和軟件佈置上，景緻不錯，鬧中取靜，很難得，房間用品也還好。接下來就得説説“但是”了，整個酒店至少分成了四部分，分別是住宿、文創、咖啡、餐廳，除了住宿之外，其他區域都是承包出去，獨立運作，獨立管理。文創泛善可陳，咖啡正常水平，餐廳承擔著民宿住店客人的早餐供應，也對外營業，可是承載力嚴重不夠啊，心思都在外面付費點餐的客人那裡，根本無法應付民宿客人的用餐需求，民宿客人晚上去吃飯（也是點餐，單獨付費），告訴你沒位置；早上去用餐，沒人搭理，得自己去找服務人員，上菜不上茶，餐具擦不乾淨，茶水不知道是第幾泡的，民宿安排綠茶，上的卻是紅茶，顏色和白水一樣，早餐口味非常一般。建議冰甌館老闆：既然餐廳外包，就招一家合格的運營企業，既然餐廳人員承載力不夠，服務能力有限，就不要既想賺外面遊客的錢，還要惦記住店客人的早餐供應，不然兩頭都照顧不到。
