She managed to find me discounted tickets. She also send us off after checkout and gave some souvenirs. Hotel Breakfast is sumptuous with a lot of variety. The check in process could be better and they only changed the room type but not the bed type though I booked wrongly on Trip. Hot Springs was a little disappointing, only single entry even though I bought the package and the pools are not really unique. Nonetheless still a very pleasant stay!

It is super child friendly and good for a family, however, not good for single people. It is in a remote location with not many food areas nearby. It is about 20 minutes to the terra-cotta warriors which is convenient. Great buffet breakfast, but was packed when we went in June. Beautiful and quiet outdoor area in the back for taking pictures. For young singles traveling staying xi‚Äôan the city is better than all the way in lingtong. Service was nice, however, when we arrived our room as not ready and needed to wait a bit. We were compensated with some cookies.

msg:This is the worst hot spring hotel I have ever stayed in. There is no hot spring in the room. If you bring your baby with you, you have to pay for all the tourist facilities inside, including the carousel, the pet park, the feeding of small animals, the excavator, and the hot spring! The water in the swimming pool is too unclean. After returning, my father's eyes were inflamed, my baby had large patches of red rashes, and my mother's face was also allergic... I am really convinced! And the baby slept restlessly at night and cried several times when he got up. I don't know if he was scared by something unclean... And I said I didn't want the last room, but I was only given the last room!

She also informed me of the hotel's service hours in a timely manner. I booked an ocean room, and it was a bit cold in the room at night. She immediately contacted and sent a fan heater. There were too many people in the hot spring, and the experience was average. The cute pet park is charged, 138/2 people feeding and additional charges are a bit expensive. There are also ponies in the hotel, and the children are very happy to ride. I also watched a show. Generally speaking, this trip was pleasant and the children liked itüíï

We stayed in the forest-themed parent-child room, which is a super large room with separate toilet and shower, a bathtub and a large balcony with a great view. The room is also soundproofed and has a good sleep.
The hotel has many children's facilities, a small zoo, a small playground, and horse riding at the door.
The food is also very delicious, the breakfast is very rich, and the dinner buffet is a little expensive.
The hotel has hot springs, but I couldn't soak in the hot springs due to time reasons.
The hotel service is super considerate, and the waiter in the lobby is responsive, which feels very good!
I believe that this is the most cost-effective and comfortable hotel in Lintong. Hungry

msg:About half a month in advance, I purchased Angsana's hot spring package on Ctrip#hotel#È´òappearancehotelcontrol#, priced at 1,598 for three days and two nights, two breakfasts, and two hot springs for two people. It is indeed the cheapest price in recent times, but The disadvantage is that you need to make a second reservation three days in advance, and no refunds or changes are allowed.
The hotel service is already very good for a luxury hotel in Xi'an. The service staff who provide guidance during peak check-in periods are all online and the processing efficiency is high.
Facilities: The room size is very good. Angsana must have been open for more than ten years. The facilities are well maintained. The response to guest rooms and maintenance is very fast. The stay is very comfortable. I soaked in the hot springs for two days and I was really reluctant to leave.
Breakfast: The variety is acceptable, salads, snacks, hot dishes, cold dishes, noodle stalls, omelettes, Shaanxi snacks... There are Chinese and Western food options, and the service staff has a proactive attitude. But the restaurant was so cold that I couldn't stand it even wearing cotton clothes... The restaurant took tables and cleared away very quickly.
Others: Nowadays, the quality of many guests in domestic hotels is worrying, and a lot of food is wasted, especially in the buffet format. Parents are the best role models for their children. I hope that every parent can abide by public ethics, not make noise in public places, and not waste food. Every hotel Everyone should vigorously promote Operation CD and actively protect the limited resources of the earth.

The shuttle bus, hotel staff, and housekeepers are all very considerate. Dad even gave me a cake on his birthday. , the only shortcoming is that the temperature in the public area is low, it is a bit cold to swim in the hot spring and walk around in a bathrobe. The housekeeper Jingjing is very considerate and is online 24 hours a day. If I have any problems, she always solves them very well. In the room at night There was something wrong with the light switch. We communicated in time and extended the check-out by two hours. The front desk also sent handmade cookies. I really value the guest's experience and will visit frequently in the future.

The crib is for small babies and is a bit wobbly. My 2-year-old baby is not a good sleeper and doesn't dare to use it, so he sleeps on a sofa and a footstool. The baby finds it very fun and very comfortable.

The hotel is animal-themed, with ponies at the door and dog-drawn carriages inside, which is quite interesting.

The swimming pool is very fun, half indoor and half outdoor, unique. A swimming cap is required, so it is recommended to come prepared.

You can only enter the hot spring once, and you have to pay an entrance fee to go again, which is a fly in the oin**ent. Taking children to the hot springs can last up to 40 minutes at a time. If it lasts longer, the children will not be able to bear it. However, once the ticket is used, it will be invalid, and adults cannot go in again. I feel that the hot springs are not worth it. It is recommended to calculate the accumulated time for hotel guests, or simply allow multiple entry and exit.

There are floats on both sides of the lobby, and there are beautiful and handsome guys dressed as Snow White and many cartoon characters standing on them. It is very beautiful and the participation is successful. After we checked in, Brother Mario became our housekeeper Eddie. He was very serious and responsible, and answered all our questions despite his busy schedule. When we forgot to get our room card, he immediately came to deliver it and we couldn't find a place to soak in the hot spring. , I couldn‚Äôt find a place to swim, but my little brother helped me with every detail and took the trouble to answer questions. I am a real gold medal housekeeper. Every staff member is smiling and very enthusiastic. The hotel is very large and has a green natural oxygen bar. The room has a bathtub. There is a large balcony, surrounded by greenery, which is refreshing. The fatigue of the day has disappeared. First, I went to swim. There were many red apples on the table outside. They were so sweet after eating them. Then I went to the hot springs because I didn‚Äôt go with my family. , I went in but couldn‚Äôt find my family. The staff immediately made a note and said that I can come with my family later. It means that the hot spring ticket has been canceled and has not been used. It is raining heavily and soaking in the 38 hot spring water. Chatting with my family in the pool has a unique flavor. The staff handed me hot sugar-free soy milk. I was so happy and comfortable. I went back to the room and had a good sleep. I woke up at 9 o'clock the next day. The breakfast in the morning was very rich. Both the Western restaurant and the banquet hall were serving breakfast. There were all kinds of drinks, including xylitol yogurt, bean berry juice and milk, and dessert üçÆ Roujiamo Hu Tofu in spicy soup, snacks are all available, the Roujiamo is very delicious, the skin is like Tongguan Roujiamo, very crispy and fragrant, plus the meat is fat but not greasy, lean but not woody, I ate two and a half at once , which I rarely eat in the past. When I saw reviews online saying that the breakfast was not good and so-so, I thought it was quite different. We are very satisfied with the food. Because our children had to take online classes at 12:30, housekeeper Eddie immediately contacted the front desk to postpone our check-out until 1:30. Because there were still so many people coming today, it was difficult to be very humane. In short, it is a very cost-effective hot spring hotel. I wish it better and better. I would like to thank every staff member for their dedicated service, especially our little brother butler Eddie. Warms the hearts of travelers‚ù§Ô∏è. Will come back to Angsana again. Thanks.

This time I took care of the cubs and my family, and I had a profound experience.
First of all, I chose this time to travel because I saw a low price. After booking, I found that the price had been reduced again, so I contacted Ctrip customer service. The communication was smooth and the problem was solved.
When I arrived at the hotel lobby, Wang Zitong received me. At first I thought it was just to add WeChat to facilitate the collection of guests for subsequent events. Unexpectedly, this journey gave me a full sense of being arranged. I thought of you everywhere and said The common point is that you were dozed off and the pillow was handed over to you. Hahahahaha, don‚Äôt feel too good.
There was still some fear in my heart that I would have too many things to do and trouble others, but it seemed that my thoughts had been pierced through and everything was arranged step by step. Not only was the check-in experience great, but the pleasure brought by this beauty was even more refreshing and natural!

It's very much like a resort hotel in Southeast Asia, full of details, from the drinks in the room to the hole shoes in the room, the round bathtub, the pet paradise, and the considerate butler service. The swimming pool is connected indoors and outdoors. In the end, the scenic spots were disappointing, so I simply came back to play in the hotel, and also made up for the regret of not having a vacation for several years due to the epidemic. The takeaway can be delivered to the room, which is great.
Why is such a good hotel so low-key? It seems that the decoration has been in business for some years. There are hot springs and outlets outside. Taking advantage of the heat in Xi'an and surrounding attractions, it can become popular on the Internet. It is recommended to have a regular shuttle bus to and from nearby attractions, which is a good publicity.
It's a pity that we only stayed for one night. The two children made the room a bit messy. They left a note to express their apologies. They wanted to press some tips, but found that they had no cash with them.

The hotel focuses on parent-child, which is really good. There is a children's paradise, and a cute pet paradise where you can get in touch with animals, but there is a fee. Even the children's playground also charges 30 tickets, which is not available in other parent-child hotels. Besides, there is really nothing to eat at the self-service hot pot bar. I'm sorry for the standard of a 5-star hotel, and I am very disappointed. The hot spring is good but there is an additional charge. When booking a room, you can directly book a package with hot springs including 2 big and 1 small hot spring tickets. However, if the child exceeds 130cm, he will have to pay a supplementary fare, so he is not counted as a child.

Special thanks to "Quiet Housekeeper" for his thoughtful and meticulous service. I also thank the staff of the room depar**ent for helping me clean the hot spring pool and clean up the room. This time I was in a hurry and didn't experience the spa provided by the private soup, which is a little regrettable. Can only wait for the next experience.

Take a dip in the hot spring at night to sweep away the fatigue of the day. It coincides with May Day, and there are many activities in the hotel. We went to the garden during the day, and caught up with the last fire tree and silver flower activity in the hot spring at night. The whole stay was a good experience, except that the quality of the toilet paper in the toilet was a bit... I have already given comments to the hotel , hoping to improve

The taste of the Chinese restaurant is okay, the set menu is very small, and each dish is just one bite. It refreshed my understanding of Cantonese or Shaanxi cuisine, and it is not unreasonable to order a la carte. Finally, it is unreasonable that hot spring hotel guests can only enter and exit the hot spring once per day. I hope this can be improved. Regardless of whether I was in a hot spring or a hotel, I was asked to give five-star reviews in person, which was a bit embarrassing and really forced.

msg:The hot spring is good, and the price-performance ratio is really low during the Chinese New Year. For a hotel with a price of more than 2,600, the restaurant said that you need to make a reservation, but you can't get an appoin**ent, so you have to queue up; the breakfast feels like a city hall, the banquet hall was temporarily renovated, the route is long, and things are replenished slowly; also I have to complain, there are not enough service staff, but there are a few people standing at the door of the restaurant. The first-grade child said that he is over 1.3m tall. He picks up the POS machine and asks you to replenish the money; the housekeeper is very good, greets you, and proactively reminds you to replenish water. ! It is understandable that there are many people during the Chinese New Year, but since you dare to charge twice the usual price, your service must keep up. The overall experience is average. Considering the price, it is a negative review and a negative score!

During the stay, the butler Jiajia provided good service, was online at any time, and responded to information in a timely manner. Every staff member in the hotel will greet you warmly. The eldest sister in the bathing area is also very nice. The child accidentally lost the bracelet. After the eldest sister found out, she contacted the front desk to solve it in time. All in all, a very pleasant and relaxing trip.

msg:I seldom write reviews on Ctrip, but if I don't write this review today, I'm really angry. Three houses have been booked on Ctrip, and a private soup room has been booked at the front desk. It was said to start check-in at 3 o'clock, but it was already 5 o'clock after the private soup house was packed, and the children kept wandering around halfway, waiting, which was a waste of time. They could have been in the soup in the afternoon, but they had been put on hold. We entered the private soup room and were cleaning up. Then it was time for the children to eat dinner. After the meal, it was dark. It was like wasting most of the day, and nothing was done. It was too cold and dark at night for children to play at all. On the second day, the private soup room did not release water, saying that we let it go when we checked in the day before, and let us go to the public pool. Well, it is already eleven o'clock. After a few minutes in the public pool, we went back to the house to clean up. The theme house needs Check out at 12 o'clock, hey, anyway, the check-in experience is very bad, especially messy. It was too late to check in, so I didn't send a fruit plate as compensation. This is not the point, the point is the front desk management, the room was charged twice. When I booked at the front desk, I had already paid 2488 for private soup. When my friend checked in, he said he hadn't paid, and paid again. My friend asked again and again, but the front desk said it hadn't been paid. The point is that we all checked out and left, and the front desk didn't find it. When we came back, we found out that we had paid too much. We found the hotel. The hotel salesman called back that night, said sorry, and said that we would refund as soon as possible. Two days later, the money has not been refunded, and no one has contacted us. This is the so-called five-star hotel. Level hotel, really powerless to complain. The experience is too bad. h

The sanitation is still a little bit poor, and the details are not paid much attention to, and the dust and water stains are a bit serious.
The heating in the room is quite good, but once you go out and walk from the room to the lobby and restaurant, it will be a bit cold. So I changed my clothes and put on a bathrobe and walked to the hot spring. It was a long distance and it was quite cold.
The mattress is too soft, the pillows are too high, and the quilt is too thick. I didn't sleep well all night.
It's not a good experience to walk back after soaking in the hot spring and meet a drunkard in the lobby.

Let me talk about the bad things: the photo is opposite to the peacock next to the restaurant. The ice skates on the roof fell down, and there was a trash can next to it. I was smoking there and almost hit it. The response was given to a passing cook. But after I had breakfast and watched the peacock with my children, I didn't put up a sign to inform the guests. It's dangerous. And the slogan on the sign, "Elopement" is not very good. After all, a lot of people take their children there, and there is a sandpit for children to play next to the slogan. In the end, the chair on the balcony of the guest room peeled off and was stabbed.

The location of the hotel is not bad. It takes 10 minutes to get off the Lianhuo Expressway, and it takes 5 minutes to walk from the No. 9 subway station, which is also very convenient. There is an Ole next to it, so you can go shopping after breakfast. In addition, you can also book a room for takeaway, which saves a lot of travel and is convenient.
Everywhere the hotel goes is the warm hospitality of the staff, and it can be seen that a lot of effort has been made in the management training.
The guest room is also very comfortable, moderate in size, clean and tidy. It seems that every room has a terrace, so you can go outside and get some fresh air. In winter, the heating in the room is very sufficient, and it feels like it is above 28 degrees. It is also equipped with children's pajamas, slippers, toothbrushes, little yellow ducks and other children's products. The parent-child travel experience will be better.
The hotel has a lot of facilities and equipment for children. Those with children should have fun. There are also peacocks to watch and hot springs to soak in.
The only fly in the oin**ent may be that after swimming at 9:30 in the evening, the temperature in the swimming pool changing room is a bit low. It feels a bit cold just out of the swimming pool in winter. It is estimated that there are fewer people and the frequency of use is relatively low. I hope it will be more perfect in the future!

For the first time, the couple took Dabao and Erbao on a trip at the same time, and they chose the forest-themed parent-child twin room. There is a large bathtub in the room, which satisfies Dabao's curiosity and entertainment needs. Two beds can be combined, there are tents and wooden horses on the carpet in the house. Babies are happy. Erbao suddenly had a high fever in the middle of the night, and the manager on duty helped us watch Dabao. We can take Erbao to Lintong Maternal and Child Health Hospital with confidence, which is a 10-minute drive away. It is very convenient to travel, and it is very fast to go to the Outlets Wangfujing store. Each room has a personal butler, our Jingzi is very enthusiastic and has good service

The refrigerator is empty. Is it because the Ctrip order has not paid the deposit? If you need it, you can brush it. If you don't need to do it, the Ctrip guests can't afford to drink. Several hotels are like this recently.
The hotel carpet stains can only be said to be very general, lazy to take details
Worst experience when I went out, my friend ordered a takeaway and delivered it to the door. I didn‚Äôt allow entry to the door. I understand the requirement for epidemic prevention. Inform the Ctrip customer service that the customer service has been in contact for more than an hour before and after. If you get it at the front desk or the concierge, you can keep warm and don't need to blow it on the table by the road.
Don't contact me, I'm just honestly commenting, thank you

We booked a space parent-child suite and it was great! Checked in at 12:30 noon. After putting down our things, we went to the Chinese restaurant to eat. We ordered a set of four-person meal, which was full of portions! The mandarin fish bubble cake is super delicious, the beef is also good, the soup is rich in taste, the baby's favorite is the fish maw and red jujube soup, after drinking a big bowl [naughty]. After lunch, I went to the lobby to watch the float tour. There are five or six floats with various characters: Princess, Marvel, Pirate, Coral, Mario, Zootopia, Chinese style... Each team will perform in the lobby. A program, rich and interesting, the baby also chatted and shook hands with Ultraman Spiderman, I really like it üòç! There is also a playground + swimming pool + hot spring‚ô®Ô∏è on the B floor. Mothers go to the hot spring. I take my baby to the playground and play every item. Hahaha, it's so cute. There is also a bubble bath at 5 or 6 in the afternoon, and the baby is sent to the hot spring to play in the water. The water temperature is just right, and it swims like a small fish üòÅ, super happy! In the evening, we have the lunch set meal, the portion is so full that almost everything is packed! There is a place for hot meals in the western restaurant. After it‚Äôs hot, go back to the guest room to eat. There are free drinks and snacks in the lobby, which is very convenient. I will accompany my baby to play Lego in the guest room (the aunt in the Chinese restaurant specially gave the baby a box, super nice)! Mothers go out for a walk and sleep comfortably at night. The breakfast on the second day was super rich, which is worthy of the standard configuration of the 5-star hotel. It was very delicious. After I was full, I set off for the Terracotta Warriors and Horses and the Emperor Mausoleum Museum! It is very convenient along the way, the scenery is also very good, the road is also easy to walk, a full and interesting weekend! !

When I asked the waiter for directions, one asked me to go downstairs and the other asked me to go upstairs. , there are no signs at many intersections, it‚Äôs like a maze. The most annoying thing is that breakfast is also treated differently. When I went downstairs to eat in the morning, I was told that the seats were full because there were too many guests, so I had to go to another temporary restaurant a little further away. Everyone The hotels are all booked several days in advance. Doesn‚Äôt the hotel keep statistics on how many guests dine on that day? As a result, the breakfast in the temporary restaurant was nothing, and many dishes were leftovers from the buffet dinner the day before. It was simply terrible. It was a terrible experience in a resort hotel. Later, I told the housekeeper that I started to lie. First, he said that he would send fruit as an apology, and he would also give a small gift when checking out. However, after waiting for an hour, there was no fruit, and the small check-out gift was also nothing. Don't promise things you can't do, as this will make people feel even worse. In short, such a service is really not suitable for a resort hotel of this level. Don't be too upset. The hot spring is also a mess, the swimming pool is extremely dirty, and the children are itchy and allergic the next day. I can no longer complain. By the way, when I first checked in, the air conditioner in the room was blowing hot air. In the summer...

msg:From the moment we entered the hotel, it was very cold without air conditioning except in the lobby. The staff all wore down jackets. Checking in on Thursday afternoon, almost none of the hotel's supporting shopping and service facilities were open, and the room service was also discontinued early! After entering the room, I turned the heating on as high as possible and the temperature in the room did not rise to 20 degrees until departure. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was broken and had no exhaust function, the plug in the bathtub was also broken and could not be used, and the carpet was full of dirt and hair. There are no drinks in the ice bar in the room. The delivery person can enter the hotel at will and walk to the door of the room. The restaurant temperature was very low during breakfast and the plates were cold.
It's really disappointing. A hot spring hotel guest needs to change into a bathrobe before entering the hot spring area. The temperature in the indoor aisle is extremely cold and there is white mist in the air. The staff wears down jackets. After all, it‚Äôs a big brand hotel, but it‚Äôs reluctant to turn on the heating? The lockers in the hotel's hot spring area are also furnished and cannot be used!
Also, on the night of check-in, the police station conducted a ward check to check the ID cards of the residents. I can understand this, but I had just entered the room from the hot spring area, and on the way back to the room, I met the inspector in the room next to me. Knock on the door. The corridor and the room were so cold. When I entered the room, my wife and I were wearing swimsuits and bath towels. Once we entered the room, we needed to change out of soaked clothes. Is it inappropriate for some men to check the identity of guests at this time? Did the hotel staff not feel the temperature or see the guests soaking wet? Can't we coordinate with the police at the police station?
All in all, this stay was the worst experience ever!

The only suggestion is that if it is possible to replace it with a smart toilet, it will be more perfect!

msg:The hotel is really good value for money. Because the reservation is early, the price is relatively high. The hotel has its own garden with lush trees. Check in at the turn of spring and summer.
There are also many entertainment facilities in the hotel, including electric trains and Trojan horses suitable for parents and children, and very warm fruit tea at the front desk. The layout of the hotel room is a typical case of combining Chinese style with modern luxury decoration.
The hotel also has high requirements for the service staff. Every time you see a guest, you will wave your hand to let the guest feel the hotel's intentions.
The Angsana Hot Springs packaged by the hotel is the most favorable price through direct sales through the hotel's official channels.
This time the occupancy rate is very high, and there is a huge contrast with the high-star hotels in downtown Xi'an. Maybe this is the market for local family travel in Xi'an.

Every time I feel comfortable, I brought my family and children to the front desk, and booked a space-themed room type, which is not far from the front desk. Building, 2nd floor ocean theme, 3rd floor forest theme, 4th floor space theme. The decoration style of the room is the same as other room types. Because there are children staying in the hotel, the hotel is more careful. It is similar to other parent-child hotels that we usually live in, and it has all the necessary configurations. After soaking in the hot springs in the evening and swimming in the morning, the children had a great time this weekend.

The special surprise is that when checking in at the front desk, Ctrip members will have a separate butler service, from check-in to stay service, to check-out, which is very considerate. Special thanks to Angsana service housekeeper Xiaohao, who provides one-to-one service, is very warm and considerate, and gives a good review!

In the past, the check-in was made by official WeChat. This experience was booked by Ctrip. The service was pleasantly surprised and praised.

msg:This is my son‚Äôs first time in a hot spring at the age of two. In fact, he has taken him to Huajiantang before. It‚Äôs just that he was too young at the time. During the period of caution, he still chose to let him play in a bubble bath indoors.
This time came true
In the hot springs in winter, keeping warm is very important
The witch‚Äôs parent-child room arranged by the son‚Äôs favorite astronaut in minutes

Room facilities: The hotel may be a long time. The decoration style and indoor facilities are a bit old
The room is at a good temperature all day long. The TV screen is really bad. At night there is a green highlight behind the TV, which particularly affects sleep.


Value for money: the price is not bad, the price is very close to the people

Breakfast: The point is that their breakfast buffet is too unpalatable. It‚Äôs not improvised. It‚Äôs really unpalatable. Internet song in the morning, bacon yes, bacon ü•ì is hard and dry. The noodles are salty and there is no other taste. This is the worst hotel buffet eaten by the witch, it is definitely Yuechun! Minefield

The bed: too soft and has hair, the witch tidy up in advance


Hygiene: The picture of the witch shows the industrial waste around their hot springs. Industrial waste is really seen everywhere. Taking the children around in the hotel, I was directly surprised that everywhere there is no star-rated hotel should have! They also require customers who cannot enter the hot spring from the lobby without changing their bathrobes to walk outside. Your sanitary environment is a landscape!
The children‚Äôs play area is not open at all, trash can be seen everywhere, and the play facilities are dusty

Parking: parking is more convenient, but can not park above the hotel

Room view: good view

Location and transportation: convenient location and transportation

Service: First of all, put your luggage and familiarize yourself with the environment. I have been to the Aegean Sea many times before. After the epidemic, the basic principle is the first time to check in the hotel in Xi'an. No, let us change our bathrobes and walk over. Our child was two years old. At that time, the hotel lobby temperature was just right to wear a coat. Let the child be wrapped in bathrobes. Your hotel should think about it carefully. The guests really feel! It took a long time for the battery car to arrive, and the front desk was also ignorant!
The younger brothers and sisters who serve in the hot spring pool are very enthusiastic, changing the bathrobe and pouring water actively
Hot springs‚ô®pools are quite open, ranging from more than 20¬∞ to more than 40¬∞. The water in the pool is also relatively clean. There are fewer people in the week.
After soaking in the hot spring, there is a dining area to order food in the hot spring area
In the evening, I stopped by Ole. Bring the children to push the stroller. If you don‚Äôt drive well and park, there is still a little distance to walk.
The final conclusion I wanted to punch in and finish writing ‚úçüèªÔ∏è but I was afraid that the stay at the time was not good and biased
Hotel facilities are slightly outdated 1000+ price There are too many hot springs around Xi'an to choose from
The breakfast category is low, the category is poor, and it is unpalatable. Objectively speaking, it is unpalatable. When you leave the store, you also leave a message with the front desk. If you are lazy and don‚Äôt want to go out for breakfast, order takeaway.
There are no welcome fruits and desserts when I check into the hotel and arrive at the store
It advertises parent-child entertainment, but there is nothing, even the carousel in the lobby is paid
Service The front desk is not very welcoming. It is the basic problem. I can't talk about how warm and thoughtful the service is!
The only good thing is that the hot spring area services are generally more enthusiastic!

The Chinese restaurant is far away, and the long corridor that runs through the room does not have the heating. It was cold with the children and they had to wear overcoats.
üîîService: The waiter will greet the customer, which still makes people feel a lot cordial.

üçÉEnvironment: The environment is okay, some buildings are too far from the hot springs and the aisles are cold. After changing clothes, I walked through the lobby for a long time, and the colder part of the road from the hotel to the hot spring is also shared with Yue Liu. In short, it is not worthy of Banyan Tree‚Äôs signature. Buy and sell with one hammer!

The fly in the oin**ent is that when we went there, the door of the hotel was being renovated. We had to take a detour. After walking up and down the parking lot, we could check in at the front desk.

In addition, it should be noted that Building 3 and Building 7 are far away from each other. When you travel, you are already tired by boat and car. You have to walk for a while when you return to the hotel. If necessary, you can communicate with the front desk to stay in Building 1.

After checking out, I remembered that there was something left in the room, and it was a relatively long distance, so I asked the front desk if I could ask the waiter to deliver it. The front desk only said personal belongings, which is inconvenientüòÖüòÖ

After all, the epidemic does not let go of the province. I haven‚Äôt been out for a long time and feel like a vacation, so I chose Angsana as a wedding anniversary.
facility:
Although it has been open for some years, the facilities are still well maintained
spa:
It feels great to take an outdoor hot spring in winter, but it‚Äôs a bit cold when changing from one pool to another.
Experience:
Because I grabbed the special price of Ctrip, it was a very cost-effective excursion. The next day I checked out and went shopping in Ole. I got a lot of rewards~

msg:Angsana Lintong Hot Spring Hotel, Xi‚Äôan This time I went home to take my girlfriend to see my parents. I was not lucky to run into those few infectious viruses that did not obey the command, which caused most of Xi‚Äôan‚Äôs scenic spots to be closed. So I thought of coming to a hot spring hotel to relax. We paid more attention to privacy, so we directly chose a private soup house and booked two rooms. During the reading, I saw bad reviews saying that there was a problem with the soup house service and hardware equipment, and most of them criticized the service for failing to keep up. After going tremblingly, from the entrance to the lobby, from the front desk to the check-in introduction, the staff were all very enthusiastic. From the order information, they guessed that they were a family, so they arranged the rooms together wisely. Introduce it to me carefully and then to my parents again. The lighting in the room is very mild, and the hot springs are full marks. If it rains and snows, the scenery should be more beautiful. Sitting outside in the upper body, I can't feel the cold at all, and the drinks and snacks presented are just enough to replenish energy for the body after consumption. In short, this is an absolutely valid evaluation, so there is no need to worry about it. The water in the private hot springs is also constantly changing, and it doesn't give people the feeling of soaking in the bathtub outdoors. If there is no accident thereafter, you should bring your family with you once every winter.

There are only two hot spring pools in the hot spring pool, and you can only squeeze in one hot spring pool with seven or eight people. The route design is also very frustrating. You can only wear bathrobes when you take a shortcut from the hotel to the hot springs, otherwise you have to go around a path without street lights and without any guidance. I managed to stay up until night to sleep, but I couldn‚Äôt turn off the reading at the head of the bed, so I just stared at my eyes, unable to sleep.

The mattresses are very comfortable, and the down pillows are my favorite. Banyan Tree Spa is not to be missed. The essential oils and techniques are addictive. A 5-minute walk from the gate is Ole. The whole road is covered by trees. Don‚Äôt spend too much money. Convenient, it‚Äôs worth coming to experience every year

The swimming pool is also a little special, it is connected indoor and outdoor. The room supplies are complete, sandals are hole shoes. What supplies are needed, the room attendant also delivered them quickly. Checked in at 12 and checked out at 15 and checked out for three nights. The little sister who cleaned the room in the past two days had a very good attitude. She forgot to ask her name and praised her. She was gentle and kind, thank you little sister. Checking in the hotel gave me souvenirs of shadow puppets. I gave me a box of cookies when I checked out. Thank you! The only friendly reminder that what You Dai has improved is the speed of serving dishes at Tang Fengxuan Chinese Restaurant. The taste is still good, maybe there are fewer chefs. A large plate of red apples will be placed every day at the elevator entrance on the first floor of the hotel for guests to take at will. In short, if I come again, I will still choose this hotel.

Because every time we bring children, Yang Xinmeng at the front desk arranged for us a room close to the hot spring, so that we can take the children to play.

The swimming pool is good, haha, it should be a little bigger to highlight that it is a resort hotel, it will be more magnificent! The temperature in the hotel‚Äôs corridor is a bit boring. I would like to suggest that the hotel put more signs on some doors of the passage, or open the doors with transparent glass windows, and go to the swimming pool. They are all the same doors. It is indeed a bit for guests to push blindly. Worried about going wrong, haha! Miss Yang at the front desk likes her attitude üëç!

The result was to send an air-conditioning fan to solve the problem, because they couldn‚Äôt fix it, and the worst thing was that there were blood stains on the bed sheets. It was disgusting.

msg:Das Hotel in Verbindung mit dem Schwimmbad ist sehr gut. Wir waren √§u√üerst zufrieden. Es eignet sich gut um von dort auch die Terrakotta Armee zu besichtigen. Ôøº vom Hotel aus kann man auch in hei√üen Quellen baden. Diese Badelandschaft hat uns gut gefallen und hatte auch ein sehr gutes Restaurant, welches wir besucht haben. Wir empfehlen das Hotel gerne weiter. Ôøº Uns hat es so gut gefallen, dass wir sogar den Aufenthalt verl√§ngert haben top Service sehr gepflegt au√üergew√∂hnlich viel Aufmerksamkeit gegen√ºber Kindern Ôøº
