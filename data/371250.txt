msg:I went to Shenzhen for a business trip of several days. Because I had good experiences with Kempinski before I decided to book at them. 

The booking process was pretty straightforward and easy through TRIP.COM. At check-in I explained my situation and they have extended my check out to 8PM even though I was willing to pay. 

Even though the rooms are a little bit outdated, it was clean and well equipped. Always tidy when I come back from a work day. When they notice that I drink more water they have placed more bottles for me everyday. 

Location wise it's very central for Shenzhen with Metro station directly in front of the hotel. Few stations to borders to HK and to the airport. 
The hotel is now surrounded by shopping malls thus also easy to find food. 

All with all: maybe not the top notch 5* hotel anymore but the people serve with a heart. I will visit here again.

I needed an international plug adapter they gave it to me for free, they allowed me to check out very late since my flight was only late afternoon, and finally after loosing my earpods in the room, I called them one day after my checkout to inquire about it, they had already found it and they arranged to ship it back to me in Shanghai.

The decoration is classic with wood and yellowish theme, it somehow makes me feel like a glorified Vienna hotel. The lobby is grand and lavish, but the worse part is the front desk. I cannot say rude, they are just not friendly. Minimum welcoming, very limited English. The room have centralized heater, but shenzhen winter is never that cold, I feel like being barbecued. I turned on air conditioner and set to 5’C and the room still at 29’C. The amenities are good, abundant amount of soap, and provide all amenities.

But a turnaround happened 😄😄 A concierge manager Alyssa contacted me and cared about my accommodation experience. She introduced the hotel facilities and services very enthusiastically.

msg:I have been to Shenzhen more than a dozen times, mostly for business trips, and seldom walked around and felt the city. This time, in order to watch Lin Zhixuan's concert, I chose the Kempinski Hotel, which is close to the Spring Cocoon Stadium. After getting off the plane, I picked up the rented car. A BMW Series for two days was only less than 300 yuan, a conscience price. I navigated about 20 kilometers and went straight to the hotel to check in. The front desk handled the procedures very quickly and added two breakfasts very considerately. The hotel facilities are indeed a bit old, but fortunately they are well maintained and have all the basic functions. The room is not big. Although it is close to the downtown area, it is very quiet. The bedding is okay, but there is a socket on the side of the bed, which makes it a bit troublesome to charge the mobile phone. If you need to contact the housekeeping center, the response is very fast. The breakfast is standard, the variety is okay, but of course the flavor is not to be mentioned. The main advantage is the location. It is more than 10 minutes' walk from the Spring Cocoon Stadium, and you can walk there for the evening concert, especially after the show. Looking at the pedestrians and cars on the street, I was glad to have chosen Kempinski. There are many shopping malls and delicious food around. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I first chose Hanzhou on Dianping.com, a porridge shop nearby, and ordered shrimp porridge, chicken and matsutake porridge, and Chaozhou-style three-in-one. I regretted that the porridge was too large. One bowl was enough for two people. The taste was also unique in the capital. It was fragrant. The three-in-one was also unique. But after eating, I wondered what to do for dinner, because I had my eyes on the well-received Deyi Zhe, a Shunde dish, which I must try. I walked around Coast City casually. There was not much to see in the mall. There were mainly many delicious foods. I just regretted that I had little time and could not satisfy my appetite. Around five o'clock, the first wave arrived at Deyizhe. There were not many people yet. We ordered Shunde boneless three-flavor fish, raw Shuidong kale, and Shunde double-skin milk. The fish was so tender. There was a small three-jin haiwan (said to be a freshwater fish). There were three flavors: original, chopped pepper, and black bean sauce. Personally, I feel that the original flavor best reflects the original freshness of the fish. The blind spot raw kale is fresh and slightly bitter, light and refreshing. I have eaten double-skin milk in Shunde a long time ago. It is usually made from buffalo milk, tender and smooth like fat, with a full mouthful of milk. My wife praised it highly. When I returned to Beijing, I always regretted eating two bowls. The manager was very considerate. He introduced the origin of the three-flavor fish and also gave away kudzu, bamboo sugarcane, and water chestnut water. This meal was extremely satisfying. After watching the concert, I returned to the hotel near midnight and thought about having a midnight snack. I searched for Feiha Grilled Skewers, which is said to be the best in Nanshan. It is a few hundred meters away from the hotel. I lined up online and waited for half an hour on site. Finally, we ate it. Although it was very popular, we felt that it was a failure. The quality, taste and grilled smell of the skewers were very average. It seems that the locals’ understanding of Northeastern grilled skewers is still very different. I really don’t recommend it! The next morning, I went from the hotel to Shenzhen Talent Park and ran for ten kilometers in the morning. The trail was very friendly. There were many people doing morning exercises. The environment was excellent. Across the sea, Hong Kong was vaguely visible. I checked out of the hotel in the morning and went straight to Dameisha Outlets to stroll around. In the afternoon, I drove to Dafen Oil Painting Village, the first in China, to visit Dafen Art Museum, to see the people who DIY oil paintings, and to feel the ocean painted in the village. It was worth the trip. I flew back to the capital at night. In short, this trip was originally expected to be unoriginal, but I booked Kempinski, and everything was fine. Music, food, shopping and painting, it was a very interesting trip to Shenzhen.

msg:I wanted to stay in a hotel for my wedding anniversary because I could relax and swim. I searched a lot of hotels, but some of them were relatively remote or did not have a heated swimming pool. Finally, I chose Shenzhen Hebinski Hotel.

Likes: It allows us to check in early and check out late at the hotel until 6pm. There are many restaurants near the hotel and the location is right next to Coast City. It is very convenient. This time we mainly bought a package that includes buffet breakfast and dinner buffet. The buffet seafood dinner is very rich. Although the appearance of the hotel is not very new, the feeling after checking in is okay. It can be seen that this hotel used to be very high-end. The front desk staff are very polite. This is really appreciated.

Areas that need improvement: We checked in on a Saturday, so the staff should be slow to close the dishes during breakfast on Sunday. Basically, they have to inform first comers every time that the dishes will be closed. F&B should improve the training of the staff when facing guests. There is no need to smile or feel a bit disinclined to work. This is not a complaint, I just want the hotel to do better so as not to waste the other advantages of the hotel.

The overall experience is not limited to the geographical advantage. There are all kinds of restaurants. We originally wanted to stay in a nearby restaurant to eat, but because the package was so attractive, it included breakfast and dinner buffets, so we ended up looking for a restaurant in Coast City for dinner the next day. Overall Rating I will come back to experience it again.

I stayed at Hypinski in Bangkok and Sanya Hainan Island a long time ago, and the experience was very good.

The lobby was magnificent and upscale. The room had a wide view, and you could see the entire China Resources Brush Building. It was great. The 2.16-meter-wide bed was really not exaggerated, it was soft, like cotton 🌸, and I slept until dawn. In addition, there were many varieties of breakfast, a combination of Chinese and Western, and there was always a suitable taste. Because it was raining when we left, the beautiful lady at the concierge on the first floor took the initiative to hold an umbrella and send us to the subway station 50 meters away from the door. It was warm, thank you very much! The hotel's 24-hour check-in courtesy is great and worth a thumbs up. I will definitely stay at KBSJ next time I go. Oh yeah!

msg:I have stayed at Kempinski Xiamen several times, so I have a good impression of Kempinski. I read the reviews online in advance, and they all said that Kempinski was too old, so I hesitated for a long time and finally decided, because I value service more. I think the old five-star hotels are more experienced and the service is relatively better.
I like cleanliness, and I will wipe it with disinfectant wipes every time I stay in a hotel. It turned out that the aunt may not have cleaned a certain place. I gave feedback to Ctrip, and Ctrip immediately gave feedback to the hotel. Then they asked me to change the room or hotel. In fact, I didn’t really want to toss. I thought I would make the best of it. But later they kept saying that it didn’t matter and changed me to a suite. I felt a little embarrassed, 😭😭 After all, I didn’t want to be thought that I was deliberately making trouble.
Every time I asked the front desk to deliver takeout, it was very fast.
These two days were very good. Overall, I think the service can make up for all the problems.
I will continue to consider Kempinski in the future

Pros: convenient location, very close to the center of Nanshan, good value for money for a five-star hotel. Checked in at midnight, the front desk helped us upgrade to the executive floor room, the view from the high-rise window is good, you can see the Sunjian Building and a little bit of the seaside. The hotel is very flexible in the check-out time, and the check-out is delayed to 6 pm, which is particularly good.

I said I wanted a room on a higher floor, but they arranged for me to go to the 1905 elevator! Everyone knows that it is very noisy. There are only two small bottles of mineral water in the room. At that time, I wanted to drink tea after running around for a day. After washing the kettle and cups, there were only half a small bottle left! I called the front desk and they delivered 3 more bottles (I couldn't bear to give them). It was only enough to make a cup. I was a little angry and ran downstairs to buy another bottle of water. There is no charging parking space in the hotel. I will not go to any Kempinski in the future. went

Three days later, I vaguely felt that I had forgotten something, but I couldn't remember it.

msg:It’s not bad to book a room on the same day just to watch the game! This is also a hotel where foreign players stay. The double bed room we booked had a really big bed! The room is not particularly big, but other facilities are quite satisfactory! The location is very close to the Spring Cocoon Stadium, about 200 to 300 meters away, just across the intersection. There is the Coastal Shopping Center nearby and the MixC next to the arena. It is very convenient to eat and drink!

msg:First time staying at this German brand hotel. Very satisfied. Opened in 2006, the hotel facilities and furniture are well maintained. The breakfast ingredients are fresh, the variety is complete, and the service attitude is good. The only drawback is that there are not enough service staff and the countertops are not cleaned immediately. Special thanks to hotel staff MIKE and others last night - they took good care of and comforted my daughter. (My daughter fell asleep and found her parents were not there.) It is worth mentioning the front desk colleagues, LEO and the red ambassador. The check-in was smooth and satisfactory.

The location of the hotel is very good. There are many food and entertainment shops in the back street. The only thing I have to say is that it is a bit far from the subway platform. It takes one minute to get to the subway station and you have to walk more than ten kilometers to get to the platform. It's more convenient to take a taxi.

I expressed my gratitude with joy, but I didn’t tell the restaurant. Halfway through the meal, the restaurant waiter came over and asked questions, as if we were cheating on food and drink. It was very embarrassing. Very dissatisfied! The female doorkeeper in the lobby talks and chats and basically ignores the customers coming in and out!

The plug of the hair dryer in the bathroom can only be inserted under the basin. If you want to dry your hair, you have to squat down and do it. What's wrong? Do you want to blow your head and lower your head first?

On the morning of check-in, my colleague called the service center in advance, and the room was prepared first. The location was on a high floor. When I arrived at the hotel before one o'clock, the front desk would not say that I had to wait before the check-in time, and I checked in very smoothly.

There is also a special roll call to thank Lris in the service center.

I was in a hurry on the day of check-out in the morning, and a few pieces of clothing were left in the closet of the room. The follow-up service center called but did not hear the call. After I called back, it was Lris who kindly handled the follow-up return for me. Big thanks to Lris for taking the trouble too.

In addition, the environment and dining level of the hotel are also very good. Of course, the service of the hotel staff is the most impressive. Please give Lris in the service center chicken legs and rewards.

Next time I come to Shenzhen for inspection, I will continue to choose to stay at Kempinski.

I called several times and no one answered. Because I had two children, the room at the elevator entrance was afraid of being too noisy with people coming and going. I called the front desk three times and no one answered. Finally, I got through and said that all the remaining rooms were in the elevator. I'm really speechless.

When was I going to check out, I was already in Vientiane City. The room type given is unique, and the whole room is crooked. Even if the air conditioner is turned on at 26 degrees all night, it will freeze to death. Maybe it is environmental protection. The page shows that there is a 24-hour check-in service.

Crowne Plaza is more considerate and flexible, while Kempinski is more rigid and emphasizes internal regulations. It's a little less humane. Although the Kempinski is more upscale, the Intercontinental is more upscale than the Kempinski and does not have these problems. Therefore, I think there is an internal problem at Kempinski that needs to be rectified.

Next time If you come to Guangzhou, you will consider staying here.

msg:I booked a room for a customer, but the customer went to the hotel and paid for the room again, and lost the order. There is no need to pay for a credit guarantee. You book directly at the hotel to pay. For an online guarantee, you pay for the room online. When you arrive at the hotel, you still have to pay a deposit, and then deduct the room money from the deposit. It's my fault that I didn't see clearly that this hotel is different from other hotels. It turns out that guests have to go to the hotel to pay for the room no matter whether they pay online or not! So why bother paying online? I paid the rent here, and the guest paid a deposit when they arrived at the store. When they left the store, the guest's money was deducted from the rent, and my money was returned the same way. I didn't know how to explain it to the guest. If it's a guest, I don't recommend this hotel for business bookings. The attitude of the service staff who calls to consult is also very confident and arrogant. I don't listen to your request at all, just say that our hotel is like this, and I will ask Ctrip to reply to you. Never bad reviews, but this time I am really angry, and I will not dare to book this hotel for guests next time. super depressed

The afternoon tea is also full of sincerity, the coffee is very fragrant, and the amount of freshly squeezed orange juice is plentiful.
There are many choices for breakfast, and the quality is good. I also ate honeycomb. It was a sweet morning.
The only hardware that has been complained a lot is that it is a bit old, but I still like this retro feeling, a bit like a hotel in Macau. Hotel management, sanitation and other software are doing well.
The transportation of the hotel is very convenient. It is just outside the subway exit. It is also very close to Shenwan Vientiane City. There is Da Dong in Shenwan Vientiane City. Friends who miss roast duck can go there. It's not far from Shekou Old Street. It's a few subway stops away. It's not bad to go there to eat and shop.

There is basically nothing to eat in the executive lounge snacks. , the breakfast is also very average, the things are exactly the same on both mornings. The service is also very average.

Kempinski Hotel is located next to Coastal City, Haide 3rd Road, Houhaibin Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen. Next to the Houhai subway station, there are restaurants and shopping malls downstairs. The three major business districts of Nanshan are all around. The hotel service is really good and the environment is very comfortable. The service is warm and thoughtful. Very polite. The south-facing location that I arranged for me faces the city view of the business district.
Go shopping during the day and eat nearby delicacies at night.

The hotel is old and strong, and it can be seen that it is trying to maintain the honor of the old five-star chain, but after all, it is old-fashioned in terms of decoration style and facilities and hardware. The room facilities are even three and a half stars. It is more comfortable and skin-friendly, but there is no sign of renovation in the hardware.

The reason given was that there was not enough manpower during the Chinese New Year. The room facilities were very old, and everything was small. The carpet was dirty. Is the hardware not working? Let the software make up for it, but the service It’s really not like this brand. I’ve lived in Shanghai and Suzhou, and they all feel good. This hotel feels like a guest house. Besides, there’s not much variety for breakfast. I’ve asked for coffee twice, and I’ve been asked to go back and wait, except The location is convenient, there is nothing good about it, and the price is not low, only the room aunt is very enthusiastic, and the only one who makes me feel the service is the room aunt! At the concierge desk at the door, there are always 2 staff members chatting, staying for 2 nights, chatting in and out... Anyway, I will never choose this hotel again next time, and I must consider Ctrip's comments and ratings next time!

I especially like it. Before coming here, the driver gave us the phone number ********. I can check in when I come at 14:12, the hotel upgrades the top executive floor for free, and also provides breakfast. It's only 10 minutes' walk from Talent Park, and it's also very close to MixC. The location is superior, the surrounding environment is good, and the hotel staff are friendly. I've heard of Kempinski Hotel in Beijing before. This time it really lives up to its reputation. Next time I come to Shenzhen Will stay in your hotel.

I arrived quite late, and when I checked in, Vicky took the initiative to ask about the check-out time. She helped arrange a delayed check-out until 2 p.m., and when I checked in, she took the initiative to ask if I could return it. Is there anyone else who can help me? If you have any questions, dial 0. They are very considerate. I asked the concierge to help me carry my luggage to the elevator. Although the floor is not high, I live on the eighth floor but I can see Shenzhen Bay outside the window. The landscape not bad. It's very close to the subway station. Turn right when you go out and you'll find the subway entrance. It's so convenient. It's so convenient for shopping nearby. When I checked in, I was asked who was staying. I originally wanted to say one person, but the front desk told me that everyone who checked in had to register, so they asked me for the name of my roommate. Later, my friend reported his name and checked in, but he didn't need it. I came down to pick it up. Although I thought it was a bit troublesome to register 2 people, it was quite considerate.

They are active, serious and responsible when encountering difficulties. They are anxious for the needs of the guests. The matter is quickly resolved.

First of all, the transportation is convenient. From the airport, take subway line 11 to exit D1 of Houhai Station and walk about 100 meters. The coastal city is about 600 meters away. There are various Cantonese-style delicacies such as Diandude.
The hotel's front desk reception managers Kevin and Selina's thoughtful and meticulous service for customers is impressive.
Next time you come to Shenzhen, you should choose Kempinski Hotel first.

The first day I slept with a sore back and a sore back, and the next day I changed a room and it was slightly better. When n waves of people came to look at the mattress, they ended with embarrassment. The doorman at the door is also invisible. When you get off the bus, you have to carry a lot of luggage by yourself, and no one helps you. It's too bad. It's a fake five-star!

Catering: No evaluation if not eaten
Service: I feel that the service does not have a five-star professional feeling at all, it is very wooden
Sleep: I didn’t rest well at the most important thing. The soundproofing was extremely poor. Someone passing by at the door could hear the talking, and the noise upstairs could also be heard. It collapsed.

In short: Super five-star price, the average experience of an express hotel, staying in five-star hotels all over the country for so many times, the experience is the worst!

msg:In the hotel booked by Ctrip, the hotel did not provide a room bill on the grounds of booking a room at the time of check-out, and repeatedly communicated that the insurance process was needed, and printed an empty form with no price but a name, and the hotel said that they did not provide the room price. This is the first time I have seen such a weird bill after staying in a hotel for so many years. Everyone can understand that there is a difference in agency bookings. However, as a five-star hotel, since it accepts agency rates, the process and service cannot be improved, which is incredible. The hotel does not provide reservation prices for different sales channel platforms. It can't help but make people think. How unrecognizable is this price? As a front desk staff member of a five-star hotel, I said that my hotel bill is like this. Do you need to retrain the basic functions of the bill? ! I hope that the Ctrip platform can pay attention to this phenomenon. After all, the front desk emphasizes the different trea**ent caused by the booking channel, which causes inconvenience and makes people feel very bad.

msg:Probably because I went late, the experience from the entrance was not good: an uncle sat at the door and stopped me and asked to show the itinerary code and fill in the visit information. This is understandable, but the whole process is cold and too lazy to answer questions and don’t help with luggage. , My two big bags can only be put on the ground, and then from check-in to check-in, there is no one to guide and take luggage. I am satisfied with other facilities and sanitation.

The mattress is also very comfortable! Except for these two, other facilities are very old! Up to 400-500 yuan. Actually more than 800. It is recommended to redecorate as soon as possible, otherwise, its superior location will be seriously wasted!

msg:A completely disappointed experience, this time I chose the highest price international hotel within the working area. The shower leaks, the bathroom does not go well, the toilet flush button fails, and the front desk warmly tells you to upgrade the room when you check in. , The moment I entered, I felt like I was in a small hotel in a second-class city. Finally, the quality of the breakfast is very poor, with few varieties. In conclusion, don't live here if you live in orange crystals, it's a waste of money.

msg:今次是光顧攜程花了接近1400元住這間垃圾酒店，簡直三星酒店也不如，該酒店被攜程抬舉得太高了，根本就名過於實三星酒店也不如。
本人是第一次入住該酒店，購買了雙早雙晚。被安排入住200x號房。
前台衹得一個職員為客人辦理入住手續。
旁邊是辦退房手續的又是衹得一位職員，我排隊䓁了很久才有人為我辦理取房，前枱燈光昏昏暗暗的，大堂中央是酒吧很是侷促感覺，旁邊是室內噴水池。職員辦理入住態度冷漠又沒笑容又沒禮貌，又不夠人手，我真被被嚇一跳，五星酒店衹有一個職員在為客人服務？
入到房間浴室一邊是浴缸另一邊是淋浴間面積很狹隘坐廁是面對着玻璃淋浴間，開了玻璃門就去不了坐廁。浴室可用空間太小了
房間面積亦不大，電視機很殘舊畫麪都不是高清矇䑃龍龍的又一敗筆，床頭竟然沒有插電頭被客人充電確是失敗，就萛普通賓館床頭都有電插頭供客人充電啦。畢竟這酒店年期都太舊了，所以很多設施都追不上現今社會設施。
至於餐廳方面收客人接近300元一位自助晚餐竟然沒什麼名貴食材供應，都是一些極普通熟食，如雞翅，土豆，炒飯，炒菜，牛仔粒等，燒烤生蠔和煎魚也不新鮮，每位位上的小青龍外形小得可憐像是鳳爪一樣。生蠔更不堪提要排隊配給，燒烤師父態度又傲慢，不是客人要求什麼就可以給什麼？啤酒紅酒也沒有簡直是一頓垃圾晚餐。
餐廳坐位擺設也好有問題，前坐和後坐都背對背，因而當晚我都見有客人如要出入就要後麪另一客人起身讓位而有所爭抝，這五星酒店真是3星不如。
下次不會再來了。

酒店房間和衞生間也很乾淨，沒有抽煙味，沒有異味。
酒店的工作人員都非常專業和友好。他們總是微笑着迎接每一位客人，提供周到的服務。無論是前台還是客房服務都讓人我們感覺到他們的用心和熱情。特別感謝Peter幫我們upgrade咗房間，還安排我們幾個房間同層大家可以互相照應，Peter在我們入住期间主動联系我們有甚麽需要盡力幫我們解決，所以我们今次入住相當愉快😀
最後，酒店的位置也很便利，周圍有許多餐廳和購物中心，地鐵站也很近，出行也很方便。

msg:作為一線城市的千元以上的酒店，性價比實在是很低。房間衞生間的燈有一衹不亮，住一晚懶得叫人了，吹風機插頭插在衞生間不知是電壓問題還是怎樣，不工作。（看清楚了，是插在220伏那個口）。換在房間裏，勉強用，但是插頭很鬆，吹了一會兒就掉下來，算了，頭髮也湊合算吹乾了。
以上我都認為可以忍，畢竟現在物價飛漲，多幾百塊去萬豪之類的酒店可能就沒這問題了。【不可以接受的是】---【禮賓的態度】，登記存行李時，早上七點半左右，整個人發散着“別惹我”的氣息，沒有任何禮貌用語不説，還態度強硬， “姓什麼？？” “電話？？” “放多久？？”，縣級招待所的服務員可能也不會如此説話。警察叔叔地界估計是這個調調。
辛苦碼字，給後來人提醒，避雷！

其次是娛樂豐富。周邊既可以看演出、看比賽，也可以購物。餐飲就更不必説了，各種選擇應有盡有。
老牌的賓館，設計都是非常好的。雖然房間設施略舊，但不會影響到心理感受。
推薦。

美中不足：五星級酒店浴室沒有護髮素是不可接受的（我對於備品品牌和質量基本沒有要求）。衞生間門打開會碰到坐在馬桶上的人，應該有辦法改善。
令人生氣：延遲到14:00退房，13:42前台給我打電話催促退房，當時我正在午睡，自己定了13:45的鬧鐘，以備準時離開。被吵醒不説，這樣催促非常不尊重人，且應該提前和客人確認好退房時間，而不是還沒到點就催！

msg:入住了豪華大床房和行政大床房兩種房型，總體沒有太大差別。入住的豪華大床房位於19樓，窗很大還有可以打開通風透氣的小窗，很不錯，但淋浴室地漏下水有問題，還有就是放洗漱用品的地方太小，沒有護髮素，衞生間門關不住；行政房位於21樓玻璃窗密閉不能透氣，洗臉盆下水有點堵，馬桶按鈕回彈不行要手動。酒店不能接受寵物入住。行政房裡的飲料點心好像也不能隨便吃？一般來説行政房裡冰箱裏的東西是可以吃的。總體感覺還行，但“凱賓斯基”這名字會讓人有很多期待，期待一旦高了失望也會隨之而來。晚餐自助對住客半價，但也就衹值這個價，三文魚金槍魚新鮮度很不夠！生蠔還不錯。品種不算很多，網上評價過高了。

缺點：畢竟年代久遠，設施和房間配套肯定落伍了，最大的缺點是原來套房隔成的客房，一扇門隔着，隔音極差，再遇到素質欠佳的住客，無奈衹能電話投訴。
