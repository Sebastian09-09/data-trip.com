msg:Overall a lovely experience, very luxurious. The check-in process was particularly notable—it didn’t feel like many hotels where you stand at a counter to check in, instead your luggage is taken to a counter and you’re seated in armchair while the concierge checked you in. A nice touch! 

The rooms are extremely spacious, with even the fairly basic room I booked having a seating and dining area. Everything in the room (curtains, lights, AC) is controlled via an iPad, which also felt very nice. The bed was comfy, view of the Bund was stunning both at night and during the day, and the bed was comfy. The added amenities like a Nespresso machine, selection of Chinese teas, and bath salts for the huge circular bathtub were all greatly appreciated. 

The breakfast had a good variety of Chinese (especially Shanghainese) and western options, mostly on-par with other 5-star hotels in China. Not bad but nothing to make it stand out. 

My complaints are few, but worth mentioning: 1.) the AC in the room just wasn’t that effective. Even though the weather is cooling down in Shanghai, the room seemed stuffy. I cranked it all the way down to 15 C but still woke up too warm. 2.) I left my room in the evening briefly to grab some takeaway I had ordered and when I returned there was a staff member in my room!! He was placing a plate of fruit on the table (which id lovely and not the reason I’m complaining). I was quite startled and said “hello” in Chinese and looked a bit shocked but he didn’t say a word or apologize and just ran out while staring at me. Perhaps he only speaks Chinese, saw I was a foreigner and thought I couldn’t speak Chinese…not sure. It was definitely a strange encounter.

My husband and I enjoyed going to the rooftop bar.  It has a fantastic view.  The service was slow and they stopped serving drinks at midnight, but overall, I would come back.  I love the location of the hotel.  We live in Shanghai, but really liked being down on the Bund for the night and within walking distance to Yuan Gardens and old town.  It was a good getaway.

But two nice ladies at the reception  desk were nice enough to upgrade our basic room to one with a nice little view of the Huangpu River. Much gratitude to them!

The room amenities and housekeeping needs a little improvement. Our toilet smelled funny and wanting of thorough cleaning. The bathroom roll up curtain may also need to be replaced as it was quite grimy and smelled a little moldy.

However, I would like to make special mention of your staff at the all-day dining restaurant and the lady at the bar (night shift)  for their courtesy and kindness everytime we dine. 

Also, we highly commend your people at the main lobby for their professional work ethic. My husband left his bag at the lobby area for an hour or so, and he was able to find it with no hassle at all.

msg:There are not many choices in South Bund, only Bund Indigo and Wanda Reign. Indigo only has C4, let's talk about Wanda Reign C5. First of all, the basic room is really ordinary, and the view is generally blocked. You can upgrade to the third-level Bund Deluxe Room (the one with a price of 3,000 on Ctrip). There is only one room on each floor, with a wide view. You can see the Bund river view and the city view at the same time, and feel the uneven feeling of the alternation of old and new Shanghai. There is also a massage chair in the room. It is also very pleasant to have a deep massage while looking at the river view.
Let's talk about the design of the hotel. The materials used in the public areas and rooms of the hotel can be seen to have spent a lot of money. It is not ugly. There is a mature and stable feeling. If you think about it, it is a bit similar to the European style under the Chinese aesthetics of the previous generation. A large number of gold-plated faucets and crystal lamps are also very exquisite. It is more suitable for a business style for talking business. The service is pretty good in hotels of this level, and the service of Manager Daisy is particularly good.
The breakfast is not very delicious. The noodles in Songhelou should not taste like this. The quality of bread, vegetables and fruits is average. The swimming pool is a bit small.
The Cool Bar on the 21st floor has a terrace where you can enjoy the best night view of South Bund.

Even the hotel's doormen and porters were very helpful. Seeing that we were not very familiar with the surroundings, they took the initiative to ask if we needed help and gave us detailed answers and directions. Special thanks to Mr. Gong, the hotel's supervisor, for his timely response and resolution of our issues during our stay. We fully felt the service experience of a luxury hotel.

msg:Opposite the hotel is the Ancient City Park. Facing the hotel gate, on the left is the Shiliupu Wharf (see Figure 2). Go straight ahead and you will see the Bund International Buildings. Go right and you will see the road to Yu Garden. You can walk there.
The room is quite large. The deluxe Bund room I booked can only see a corner of the Huangpu River, and I can't even see the three-piece set of Lujiazui (see Figure 3); there is a massage chair in the room, and everything is very exquisite (see Figures 7 and 8).
There is nothing amazing about the breakfast, such as the spring rolls, which are soft and hard inside. The spring rolls with leek and meat filling that I ate in a restaurant in Xinghua some time ago were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with marinade inside, which was very delicious. The chefs have a high level of foreign language skills. I saw them speak English directly to communicate with foreign friends.
The service is very good. For example, the handsome guy Jin Yang patiently explained to us how to play, professional and enthusiastic, and the handsome guy Sun Hao took the initiative to help take the luggage and put it in the car. The room was cleaned very cleanly, and the clothes I casually put on the bed were folded for me. Thumbs up for them! ! !
Although the rating is five stars, I think there are still some places that need to optimize the process: First, the delivery of things. At 11:19 pm, when we were already asleep and did not call for delivery, the waiter rang the doorbell and knocked on the door to deliver the bath bag. I was sleeping soundly, but I was awakened. If it is delivered, can it be delivered earlier? It can't be delivered after 11 pm. If it is delivered to the wrong place, it is even more wrong.
Second, about cleaning. We went out in the morning and came back to rest at around 2 pm. As soon as we came back, the waiter rang the doorbell to clean. We said we needed to rest for an hour before cleaning. The waiter was very dedicated and came to clean again in less than an hour. We went out for a whole morning and no one came to clean. I wanted to come back to rest for a while. I had so much time that I had to clean at this time. As a five-star hotel, can we optimize the process and clean when the guests are out? Let's take their service on the cruise ship this time. When we came back after breakfast, the room was completely cleaned. The time for our breakfast every day is not fixed, but they can accurately grasp it.

The hotel phone only has one button for calling the butler, and there is no food delivery or room service. No one answered the phone at 2 a.m. I ordered takeout, but no concierge arranged for a robot to deliver it upstairs. I waited for a long time and then went downstairs to pick it up myself. The front desk was snoring, and the concierge was not at work, sitting on the chairs in the lobby. The takeout was just there and no one was in charge. If the guests had something urgent, no one would respond, which is ridiculous. The service during the day is nothing to complain about, polite, meticulous and professional. No one responded at midnight, which is really a bad review. Moreover, there is no HBO on the satellite channel.

From the front desk to the concierge, to the door greeters, they are all very gentle. The takeout will be delivered upstairs by a robot, which is a plus! ! There was a takeaway in the evening that was too heavy for the robot to fit, so the handsome guy at the concierge even helped me carry it upstairs!

Because we had booked in advance and noted our needs, the entire check-in process was very fast and met our needs. Then the little guy at the lobby helped carry the luggage to the check-in floor, which was very considerate and heartwarming. When you enter the room, your eyes will shine.

The massage chair in the bedroom is also a unique feature. The cloakroom, bathroom, and dressing room each have their own unique characteristics, which can only be fully understood after living there. The hotel's breakfast includes a variety of Chinese and Western food. The most impressive thing is the four-color noodles. The service of the foreman and waiters is patient, kind, thoughtful and standardized. The cleaning lady was very quick and tidy. After she finished the cleaning, she asked everyone to check everything to see if there was anything missing or that needed to be sorted. The best part was that she laid a thin square towel under the cosmetics I placed. . The most enjoyable thing about staying here is that the room price is reasonable and the overall configuration of the room. I will stay at this hotel again and recommend it to my friends.

msg:Every Chinese New Year coincides with my mother’s birthday, so staying in a hotel near the Bund has become her unwavering choice. From the North Bund, Suzhou River, all the way from Chen Yi Plaza to this time near Yu Garden, you can almost stay in luxury (or five-star) hotels along the route. I asked my mother what she thought of the Ruihua Hotel. She said that although it is not a C-level place for sightseeing on the Bund, the deluxe Bund room can already overlook the entire Wanguo Building Group and Lujiazui, and the view can be said to be excellent. Hotel bedding and pillows also meet the positioning of comfort. As for breakfast, the dishes are not rich, but they have everything you need. Freshly baked Western-style bread is more recommended (nut tarts and pistachio records are especially not recommended😂) There is nothing else to complain about. Notes for birthdays and anniversaries are all arranged and prepared🍰, thank you!
The room is clean, no smell, moderate air conditioning, no floor heating. This room type has a massage chair.
In terms of service, the service did not drop during the Chinese New Year. The response and feedback from welcome to check-in to room service were very good. The leadership and etiquette of breakfast, as well as the closing were also prompt (one day I got up from breakfast to get the second one) Wow, the tables in front of us have been sorted😅)
Although the gym and swimming pool are not large in size, they are fully functional and usable! The receptionist and pool lifeguard on the second floor are also very welcoming.
The geographical location, although it is not a C-position hotel on the Bund, but within a 15-minute walk, you can get close to the C-position photo spot on the Bund. I tried it that day. It took about half an hour to walk from the peninsula to the hotel (slowly), for reference.
Nearby attractions are very close to Yu Garden and Chenghuang Temple. Along the way, you can take Fangbang Middle Road. There used to be Cat Street, but now it has become Flower Street. You can also take photos.
For dining nearby, the nearest one (actually adjacent to the hotel, but you have to go out. I heard you can also take b1 but it is not very ventilated) BFC can be used as a reference. We went to the Bund Yuan for a few days to eat. In the elevator, I also saw a customer ordering takeout and having it delivered by a robot.

msg:The Wanda Reign Hotel on the Bund has a superior location. The "three-piece suite" of the river view room has a panoramic view of the Huangpu River. The view of the viewing room is broad and clear. Whether it is the scenery on both sides of the Huangpu River or the international buildings on the Bund, it is condescending and very eye-catching! The decoration of the hotel is very unique and the rooms have different styles. The bathroom and shower room are separated, and the smart toilet in the bathroom is very powerful. The cloakroom is spacious and has a dressing table and stool for women. Toiletries are all L'Occitane. I would like to praise the slippers, which are not the usual white ones. Comfortable. The environment is good and the facilities are unique. Not far from the door is the Yu Garden Scenic Area, and downstairs is the Shiliupu Pier. In particular, the hotel service is commendable and considerate. Welcome fruits were also given. It would be better if the buffet on the first floor had more variety. Due to weather conditions, I was unable to go to the 21st floor to experience the terrace scenery, which was a bit regretful!

Indoor massage chairs, smart toilets, Dyson hair dryers, capsule coffee machines, iPads, L'Occitane toiletries, etc. are all available. There are a wide variety of Western-style breads for breakfast, and it can be seen that they are thoughtful in Western-style pastries. There are various Chinese porridges and soy milk fried dough sticks, as well as snacks and hot dishes to meet the needs of different groups of people. Almond walnut dew is a dessert that particularly surprises me. The service is very good. The lady at the lobby heard that I wanted to delay my check-out for a while, so she generously helped me delay my check-out for three hours for free. Thank you very much! The good environment and good service brought me and my children a very beautiful mood!

The lady at the front desk enthusiastically arranged for early check-in. The room is large and well designed. I like the design of the cloakroom the most, it's quite special. There are also many different choices of coffee and tea in the room, and you don't want to go out when you are in the room.

This is my first time staying at Wanda Ruihua. The location is very good. It is convenient for visiting the Bund and admiring the lanterns of Yu Garden. It is just a short walk away.
Facilities: The heated swimming pool is winter-friendly. After checking in, I took a short break in the room and tried it. What is worthy of praise is that the mattress is soft and supportive, the bedding is very comfortable and skin-friendly, including the bathrobe, which is not heavy and heavy, adding to the relaxation and comfort. The bathtub shower water flow is very large, and bathing enthusiasts will love it.
Environment: The layout of the hotel is pretty good. Breakfast is on the first floor. It is full of Chris**as a**osphere. The manager arranges the seats in an orderly manner. I don’t like the noisy breakfast buffet. I originally wanted to experience the bar on the top floor to see the night view, but it happened to be an event. If you realize it, leave it for next time🙈
Service: They are really considerate and will follow the guest's feelings in every detail. Mina is very considerate. She specially informs you about air conditioning and humidifiers in winter. She also thoughtfully asks if there is any luggage that needs help. When checking out, remind her that the car can be left before leaving. Then go to the concierge to report. Although it is just a small detail, it gives you the warm feeling of differentiated service🩷

There are welcome fruits and the service is in place. The aunt cleans very well and is very polite. She will say hello when passing by.

Breakfast was okay, average but not amazing. The chocolate horns were delicious but not sweet. In terms of ingredients, it is a pity that the yogurt does not have Greek yogurt, and the Guangming yogurt provided has a bit high sugar content. The milk is only cow's milk, no plant milk options. Those who don’t drink milk can only choose black coffee. The service was pretty good. I told him that the coffee was cold and replaced it with hot one.

The little girl with glasses when checking in and the grace who checked out were both nice. Check-in was completed quickly, I was given a satisfactory room, and check-out was also very fast.

The breakfast in the hotel is great. The Chris**as a**osphere in the lobby bar is very suitable for the occasion. Every receptionist is polite. The little girl Mina at the front desk was polite and smiling. She was very cute. We delayed the room and booked a spot for afternoon tea. At the end of breakfast, all the managers and supervisors of the restaurant were at the door to thank the guests and see them off. One of the female managers had a particularly warm smile because she took a few pills. I informed the female manager about the rose tea and said, "No problem, you can take it away if you like it." It was a very good experience. However, there was a slight discrepancy in suggesting that the afternoon tea was not from the hotel but from a cooperative private cafe.

It is very convenient to take the shuttle bus to major hotels. It is very convenient to go anywhere, and the directions on the road are also very clear. The facilities nearby are complete, the surrounding seafood hot pot is good, and the price is very beautiful. The service at the hotel front desk is enthusiastic. It is a super satisfying stay. The stay is comfortable and considerate. The air conditioning in the room is quiet and the temperature control is just right. The front desk is very patient and provides good service. I saw elderly people and children. After checking in, I directly changed to a newly renovated room with separate dry and wet rooms to ensure safe bathing. There is a bathtub and a separate shower room, and a crib and bedding are also installed. The linen is also very clean, and children are given a free one. I got a breakfast coupon. The breakfast is rich and exquisite. The opening hours are also very generous. It is very convenient. The hotel staff Eve is very friendly. When checking in, she took the initiative to give a city map and inform the surrounding attractions routes. The hotel facilities are complete, complete and luxurious. The room is clean, the environment is located on the side of the road, and the environmental sanitation management is very strict. The windows are very soundproof, and you can basically hear no noise. The beautiful scenery in the room is unobstructed, and the night view is even more beautiful. Extremely satisfied! The facilities are also very in line with tourists' requirements...it is convenient and quick to store and pick up luggage. You can help bring your luggage to the room when you check in. The reception staff at every step are very friendly. The hotel itself is an attraction, with its own shopping mall. You can play in the hotel for a day, and you can buy something in the hotel every night. It is worth experiencing. The entire hotel is in a bustling area but can give people a quiet sleeping space. The photos are great. All in all, I have a very good impression of this hotel and Shanghai. The hotel rooms are well designed and highly technological, especially the blackout curtains, which are completely light-proof and ensure good sleep. The movies on the hotel TV are all free. The TV is large and has speakers. It is very comfortable to rest in the afternoon without going out to the hotel. Daisy is considerate and will choose to stay here again next time. Recommended

I came to Shanghai for two days and was very tired and wanted to rest more. However, at 6:40 in the morning, the waiter used the room card without the guest's permission. He opened the door and entered the room, frightening us two ladies and two children to wake up. The children were so frightened that they cried, thinking they were bad guys. I have stayed in hotels so many times. This is the first time I encountered this situation in a five-star hotel. It was so terrible. I will never stay in this hotel again.

Overall, the hotel accommodation experience was okay. I arrived early on the first day, and the hotel front desk specially helped me clean the room and let me check in in time. Thank you very much! The room facilities and beds are as comfortable and clean as other city hotels. 👍
  The coffee in the minibar in the room tastes good👍, and the three levels of hotels have been divided into three categories; in addition, the Pu'er tastes good, and the tea set is also good enough!
  This time the room can still see the Huangpu River and the street view.
  When I returned to the room in the evening, I saw the hotel providing fruit and turn-down service, which was great! 👍
   The breakfast on the first floor is very rich👍, a combination of Chinese and Western, especially noodles - it tastes good! 👍
Generally speaking, when I travel on business, I would still choose Jiahua or Ruihua under the Wanyue Club.
If you come with your family in the future, it will be your first choice because the hotel is very close to the Bund, Yu Garden, tourist bus station and the cruise ship at Pier 16, just one road and sidewalk away.
One thing I hope to pay attention to is that the tea set - the teapot lid is extended along the edge. I don't know if it is a problem with the tea set, there is tea stain.

The most frustrating thing was that the air conditioner was turned on for three hours and there was no warm air. I washed my head and the socket was broken and wet. Waiting for the engineering depar**ent to come and repair the socket, ok, I moved to the third room. The spray I just sprayed when I entered the room still couldn't cover up the pungent smell. The worst part was that it automatically entered sleep mode at 4 o'clock in the morning. The room temperature 21.9, that is, it was such a cold day without heating, and I successfully caught a cold! The staff's solution was to give me five bottles of mineral water, a heater, and said they would give me an extra quilt, and then asked me to add the hotel manager's WeChat account, and then there was no result! From the moment I checked in, I felt that the staff were perfunctory, and when I checked out at the end, I saw that the staff were all working hard and playing with their phones!

Service: The butler service is very attentive. He contacted me one day in advance and arranged a birthday-themed room. There were welcome fruits and a strawberry cake as soon as he entered the door, as shown in the picture. The words Happy Birthday made of rose petals are very thoughtful. It was also very prompt to call the housekeeper and ask for something I needed. Because I had an older child, I asked for an extra bed, but there were no extra beds. But the bed is big enough and very comfortable, and one can turn over without disturbing others.

When I returned to the room, I wanted to take a cold shower, but there was no hot water (the water was lukewarm but not hot).
The key point is that the shower head on the ceiling is still dripping cold water. I asked the manager to change the room and the same problem still exists. The time is too long. The manager's solution is to send red wine. When we said we don't drink red wine, he said to send fruit. Personally, I don't think so. Professional hotel management is still not as good as the Marriott we stayed in a few days ago. The room we finally changed to was an embarrassing and stingy river view (blocked by the TV)

msg:Everyone, please be prepared for the small room. The Pujiang room I booked was over 3,600 per day. The room was really small and depressing. On the same day, I saw a panoramic room on Ctrip. The price was over 4,000. I thought I couldn’t make up much money so I decided I just wanted to change the room type the next day, but the front desk told me that I couldn't pay the price difference according to Ctrip. I had to pay 1,000➕ according to the front desk. In the end, after the discount plus tax, I paid more than 900 before they changed the room for me, and they kept saying no. I'm really drunk because I don't have a room. I'm a person who is afraid of trouble and I don't want to get into trouble. I just spend the money as I spend it. At least it will be comfortable to live in a bigger room. As a result, two people from the hotel came to ask me for feedback today, and another one urged me to give a five-star review. Why don't you think you have enough feedback? Really convinced. If you want to see the river view, you can stay at the Waldorf Astoria. Indigo on the Bund is also good. With a budget of 4,000 yuan, there are still many options in Shanghai. Anyway, this is my first and last time staying in this hotel.

There are two rooms with 270-degree panoramic views. They almost take in the entire view of Pudong and Puxi. I love it. In the evening, enjoy the buffet at Cafe Reign on the first floor of the hotel. The quality of the dining environment, food and service are both excellent. The breakfast in the hotel has a wide variety of choices, which is suitable for Chinese tastes. My mother likes it. The hotel is very close to Yu Garden. It is also good to visit Yu Garden during the festival. During my stay, I discovered that Xiao Yan at the front desk is a hotel employee with high professionalism, quick thinking, and sincere trea**ent of others, which is great! Looking forward to seeing you next time👋🏻.

On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, 2 boxes of moon cakes were given. The view from the room was the Oriental Pearl Tower on the Bund, which was very comfortable.
The massage chair could be more user-friendly. The overall stay experience was great. I will stay here again next time.

I was a little nervous before going, but the hotel housekeeper contacted me a day in advance and arranged a bed surround, small slippers and toiletries for the child. I was informed that I would arrive at around twelve o'clock and promised to try my best to arrange check-in.
    On the day of arrival, when the car stopped, service staff helped open the door and push the luggage. When you enter, there are two foremen in beautiful clothes who ask you kindly and guide you to the front desk to check in. The room has been cleaned and the requested items have been added. Also asked if I needed help carrying my luggage to the room. Every employee I met smiled and said hello, and my inquiries were answered quickly.
   The children were very happy with the two-day buffet breakfast. The service staff enthusiastically guided the children to get things that were out of reach and asked for help. Every service staff responded promptly and helped me to return to the hotel while I was playing. I held my sleeping child in my arms and the door service staff took the initiative. Help me get my things and push the elevator back to my room.
  The massage chair, smart curtains, smart washroom and electroplated glass in the room are safe, private and convenient, bringing a lot of convenience and leisure to our journey. The scenery is also very good. It is just opposite Pier 2 of Shiliupu. It is within walking distance. My children watch the Bund by the window every day. They are very happy and say that they will choose Ruihua next time they come to stay.

I sit in the room and leisurely look at the night view of the Bund every night. It feels great because the bathtub in the room leaks. This time, manager Mina Zheng also helped upgrade the room to a Bund suite and gave the child a bunch of toys. The child accidentally broke a teacup in the room. Not only did the hotel not compensate the child, it first asked the child if he had anything to do, and then gave it to the child. There are a lot of toys to comfort the children. It is really very user-friendly. The breakfast is also great and has everything you need. The swimming pool is also very good. We almost booked it during the Chinese New Year. In short, if you have enough budget, it is a no-brainer to choose Wanda Ruihua. That's right. The location is excellent. There are all kinds of delicious food and supermarkets in the shopping mall next to it. It takes half an hour to get to Disney. Other famous attractions are within half an hour's drive. Some attractions are within walking distance. The key is to lie in the room at night and watch the Bund, across the road. You can take a boat at any time at Shiliupu Pier.

The hotel can not only enjoy the streets of the Bund, but also enjoy the vibrant river view of the Bund, and overlook the scenery of the Pujiang River. It is even better to combine the lighting scenery at night. The surrounding scenic spots are very close, and delicious food and fun are all nearby.

Environment: Noble and elegant, showing his nobility all the time. The interior decoration design of the room is still unique.
Service: Eve's efficient and considerate service is considerate and thoughtful.
The bar on the 21st floor has a superb view, recommended.

The environment is very bad. Everywhere is dirty. I can't sleep at all, especially if the hotel is renovated. The service is very special. I can't find anyone for even the smallest of things. Once I find someone, I just play football and don't care about anything. I don't recommend everyone to stay there.

msg:To be honest, at this price of more than 2,000 a night, don't come here even if you go to Hilton Marriott. Open the window and see a building. Secondly, for me, the decoration is really indescribable, and it smells like entering the room. The hallway is full of smoke smell 15th floor. I have to make complaints about the service: First, I checked out until 14:00. I checked out after nine o'clock and said I would go shopping around noon and report my license plate number before going out. The front desk said that we will not keep it when you check out. I said that my rights are at 2:00, so is it different for me to check out at 2:00? The desk at the front desk is in a mess. To be honest, it is the worst hotel among so many five-star hotels. I give the service two points for the service staff in the restaurant. There are not many types of breakfast. Is the score really written by the customer? You can get five stars for the price, but keep up with the service. I was disappointed when I entered the hotel.

msg:This time I checked in at Shanghai Wanda Reign Hotel, and overall I am very satisfied. First of all, the hotel is located in the BFC Bund Financial Center. There are supermarkets and shopping malls downstairs, which is very convenient. Opposite is the sidewalk on the Bund. It is very pleasant to walk around with your loved one in the evening breeze at night.

Transportation: The transportation of the hotel is very convenient. It seems that you can get off at Yuyuan Station by subway and walk for about 10 minutes to reach the hotel. If you drive, get off the Yan'an Elevated Highway and turn right at a few intersections.

Service: The business of the hotel is very hot. There was a small episode when we checked in. Fortunately, Jay, the manager on duty, came out to solve it immediately. He has a very good attitude and is super handsome. Help us upgrade for free to the popular Internet celebrity room type-Pujiang room on a high floor! The view is amazing! In addition, I also helped to make a late check-out, like it!

Environment: The design of the hotel entrance and the lobby on the first floor is very clever, the environment is elegant and grand

Overall, it's still a very good staying experience. I hope to have the opportunity to choose Shanghai Wanda Reign Hotel again!

msg:After comparing the five-star hotels on the Bund, I finally chose Wanda Reign’s Pujiang Room. The location is very good. You can walk to Chenghuang Temple, the Bund, and Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. It’s a great choice during Golden Week. But not as good as expected. The rooms are small, and one of them is at the end of the corridor. The room is very small due to the structure. We didn't ask for a replacement because we wanted our two rooms to be connected together. The view from the room is good, with a panoramic view of Lujiazui buildings, but the Jinmao Tower is just blocked by the Shanghai Center, but the view is still very good. You can see the feasting lights of Shanghai at night, the bustling crowd downstairs, and The continuous flow of traffic jams into the long queue, the contrast is really wonderful. There is some peculiar smell in the bathroom of the guest room. The breakfast is okay. The attitude of all the service staff is very good. Because the welcome fruit was delivered late, the butler compensated with two fruits, cake and red wine. Sitting check in at the front desk of the hotel, crossing your legs, looking more casual than the guests...

Is this to curb children's natural instincts? Or can you squat down and reason with the children?
I have never seen such cold service in a five-star hotel.
I went over to ask the waiter what happened, but he pretended that he didn't hear anything and left. I was shocked. . .

There was a problem with the faucet in the room and the bath water was not hot. I called the maintenance man again to install it.

In short, Wanda has an exaggerated decoration, full of wealthy a**osphere, a musty smell in the room, and the software and services are basically at the level of a fast hotel. poor!

The children's tableware is actually on the top There are still residues left, the knives and forks feel sticky to the touch, and the service of the waiters can't keep up.

A series of layouts in the room are very different from the promotional pictures. Not to mention the room view. The service concept that luxury hotels adhere to, this hotel has not achieved it either , the concierge guy is even more arrogant. Compared with all the luxury hotels I have stayed in on the Bund in Shanghai, this one is the least I recommend to do, and the whole hotel has no care and attitude for the guests. Service It's not in place. The second thing I can't believe is that my room is treated with welcome fruit. I only got the welcome fruit 2 hours before check-out. If I don't call him the next day to check out It won’t be delivered, and the hotel staff will accuse you of “using too much” if you use too much L’Occitane spare parts in the room. Yes, these are a series of dissatisfaction during your stay in this Wanda Ruihua.
      Summary: This hotel is not a five-star luxury hotel, and even Marriott's service is better than it. I hope all fans and friends stay cautiously. Of course, I personally do not recommend you to live in this hotel in Shanghai, and I was finally annoyed half dead mood

The hotel is across the river from Lujiazui, the location is unique, and the hotel is close to bfc, shopping is also very convenient. The room is designed with intelligent system, smart toilet, Boss audio, and equipped with iPad and coffee machine. The toiletries are from L'Occitane, and the fragrance is very good Smell, you can also listen to music while soaking in the bath 🛀 to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the magic city.

The hotel staff warmly welcome the service, considerate service, luxurious decoration, beautiful, many famous masterpieces full of artistic a**osphere, very high-end view of the Bund, close to BFC Bund Financial Center, eating and shopping are very convenient and cost-effective. It is much better than Pangu Seven Star. Come to punch in the nameless Napoleon of the same style. You can order takeaway at the hotel and it will be delivered directly to the hotel lobby.

msg:Weird hotel! Because there was a typhoon, I arranged a two-night buffer time in Shanghai to transfer overseas. I wanted a twin bed and wanted to eat at Xin Rong Ji, so I chose this hotel. Eve, the self-proclaimed butler of this hotel, called to say hello one day in advance and added her on WeChat. I just Mentioned to have a good rest before connecting flights. The flight was unexpectedly delayed, and I checked in at almost 1 a.m. After entering the room and lying down, I kept hearing noises. The family of three didn't have a good rest all night. I tossed and turned and blamed myself for choosing a hotel with such an outdated air conditioner in the room. When I opened the curtains in the morning, I suddenly discovered that the source of the noise was the central air-conditioning host less than 10 meters outside the window. Next, after making a complaint, a front desk person came to upgrade and change rooms, and a set of standard procedures were followed. Then there was nothing more. It seemed that the hotel had given me a huge discount. I stayed in a noisy room for one night and was offered a view room for one night. Do I still have to write a thank you letter to the boss of Wanda Reign? Isn't the purpose of the housekeeper's call to understand the guests' demands and provide better services in a targeted manner? Instead of reserving a quiet room in advance, the guest is given a noisy room that needs to be managed, without any apology afterwards. What makes me sick is that you chose a noisy room for me and then made it seem like you really have butler-like attentive service. After all these years, the square outlet of the bathtub still has sharp corners that can scratch people. There are also many sharp corners in the room facilities. In the morning, there was only one person at the concierge and front desk who was busy and couldn't answer the phone. There was a staff member who was lifting his pants while looking inside. Walking to the entrance of the lobby... From the time when the customer relations manager asked for good reviews when checking out in the early days of opening, to the sales manager to increase the price after the guest came to the airport after the price was quoted, to now when the Dong Shi Xiaofeng housekeeper called, this hotel has not made much progress. ….

The last episode, special thanks to Jay at the front desk. Although I left the hotel for 2 days, the hotel phone was not connected. Jay, who was on vacation, also helped me find the lost computer in the room. The service is very attentive.

I went to live again during the Spring Festival in 2023. After the epidemic, the Bund is full of tourists, the hotel rooms are full, the scenery is still the same, and the hardware facilities are still luxurious and elegant. The number of service personnel is a little short, so we helped organize some rooms by ourselves, and the staff replenished consumables.
There are many guests, there is a queue for breakfast, and some food even has to be replenished. For the breakfast of the third person, I bought a group purchase from Dianping, which is very affordable.
I still bought afternoon tea and took it into the room to taste. The manager of the lobby bar also handled the accident skillfully, which is pretty good!

The hotel helped to upgrade the parent-child room for free, and the beautiful manager in the lobby also warmly presented New Year gifts to the children, adding surprises to this trip. The large floor-to-ceiling windows in the room can look around the Huangpu River 270 degrees, and the view is transparent. Children like the small tent in the room very much, and they can play in it all day. In addition, there are many small snacks and drinks in the room, all of which can be used for free (although I didn't know it at first, I only enjoyed a pack of potato chips, but it feels very warm). The only regret is that the breakfast is not enough, there is no pasta that the children want to eat, and there are fewer meals provided, which need to be constantly replenished, but perhaps this is an advocacy of saving while ensuring food quality.

However, the hotel rooms were full during the Chinese New Year and I was not able to get my wish. I am a little regretful. It may be that the weather is not beautiful and it is raining continuously. I feel that Wanda Ruihua's Pujiang house is quite satisfactory. But the flaws are not hidden. All the staff I met in the hotel were very proactive and enthusiastic. I especially want to praise the handsome guy in the front lobby, Jay, who took me to see the Bund room and Pujiang room for me to choose when I checked in I stayed at J Hotel in 2010, and I could only choose Chinese and Western room types blindly.) I later learned that Jay was also helping me with some problems during my vacation. It can be said to be responsive👍There is also Sun Xinxia from room service, Xiaoya from Youyan Yipin, self-help Ma Yuxuan from the restaurant, these nice little brothers and sisters, gave us the most thoughtful positioning service, made us feel like home away from home, and had a happy New Year, thank you very much🙏

First of all, the lobby is very beautiful, with a great mural. The young lady at the door gave my baby a bunny and a lollipop as soon as she entered the door. The children were very happy~ When they entered the room, they were surrounded by the 270-degree river view I was shocked, with such a comfortable scenery, I didn't want to go out o(≧v≦)o The icing on the cake massage chair is also very clean, even the cleanliness I just sit on and feel it!
Secondly, maybe because of the New Year’s Eve, there was a clown who made balloons in the hotel in the afternoon. The welcome fruit and dried fruit are very fresh, and the plate is beautiful. I know the birthday of the child, and I also sent a strawberry cake❤️The water pressure in the room is very good, the bath and shower are very comfortable, the room and bathroom lights have various modes, I really enjoy it up!
Finally, the lion dance on the first day of the new year was also very special. There was an aunt who smiled sweetly and gave a red envelope to the baby (I guess it was the leader). The children and the elderly were all beaming and happy~
The epidemic is over, and the new year is here. Living here on New Year's Eve, the family members feel very happy! Details determine success or failure, we hope to do better and better, next time we will continue to come!

msg:It was a perfect check-in experience. The service is one of the highlights of Ruihua. After the experience, I was really pleasantly surprised. Eve provides one-stop service from check-in to the room. A small gift is presented, and the hotel facilities and business hours are introduced to solve the problem. A series of questions we ask. You can see the ultimate view of the Bund from the room, and the night view is even more shocking. Enjoying the Bund from a wide angle and facing Lujiazui across the sea is really beautiful! The hardware is good, and the jade decoration is extraordinarily extravagant. It is also equipped with a Chinese tea set and coffee machine.
The location, environment and service are perfect and impeccable!
Thank you Eve for your meticulous work. If there is a need, I will definitely choose Ruihua again.

If it is based on this star rating, I think it is not in place. According to the 5-star mark, it is quite in place. The service staff will say hello when they see it, and the equipment in the room is quite complete. When you go to the restaurant for breakfast in the morning, you will be given a seat. You will first ask what you want to drink, and you will ask for help. The welcome fruit and small desserts are very cute. The sweet soup in the evening is good. The only bad thing is that after 9 o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone for the housekeeping service. When I checked out, I mentioned that the staff said it might be busy 's just not in...
Daily 300 yuan food and beverage deduction: the front desk didn’t offer it, and I didn’t plan to eat at the hotel, so I didn’t take the initiative to ask for it

If you look at the "three-piece suit" from the front, you can see the whole Bund side panorama on the left. It can be said that except for the suite, this room is invincible (this is why we have to work hard🤗🤗) Everything else is fine, but the communication between the waiters will be broken, causing the cold drinks we ordered to run back and forth, and the ice has melted! But the housekeeper is very caring, and immediately waived the minibar for the day. The service can keep up, but the communication between the staff is not in place. I hope to improve the training next time. Overall, an absolute YYDS

Are you talking so rudely? The hygiene is also poor. As soon as you enter the room, there is a pile of dirty things on the bedside table.

msg:The 2-night special package purchased on Ctrip can also be accommodated on National Day. Every night, a 500 yuan meal coupon will be given, which is equivalent to 1,300 per night. It has also been upgraded to a Bund River View Room, which can see the Wanguo Building Complex and the three-piece suite of Pujiang River. I have to sigh. The night view is really beautiful!
Wanda Reign is a high-end hotel opened by Wang Sicong. As soon as you step into the lobby, you can feel the luxurious a**osphere. Although it is luxurious, it is not earthy. Various artworks and paintings make the whole hotel full of art and high-end feeling. The hardware is good overall. The Bund River View Room has a massage sofa, and you don't want to get down when you sit on it~🛁 The glass next to it is a dimming glass, and there are three lighting options. The laundry in the room is L'Occitane, and the bathing area of the swimming pool is also L'Occitane, which is very generous. The most unsatisfactory part of the hardware is the swimming pool. The area is too small. It is only 12 meters long. It is OK for children to swim, but adults can swim for 8 times. [Facepalm]
There are not many choices for breakfast. Fortunately, there are not many people on National Day, and there is no need to queue. The experience is very good. The meal coupons presented by Ctrip We ate the hotel's seafood buffet dinner on the first day. Each table will have a waiter delivering hairy crabs, daily specials and Buddha Jumping Over the Wall. I think the quality of Buddha Jumping Over the Wall is quite high. . The next day we went to have afternoon tea. Unfortunately, because there was a wedding banquet, Ruiku, which had an invincible river view on the 21st floor, was reserved. We could only eat afternoon tea in the lobby. The ingredients were ordinary and the taste was quite ordinary. It is not recommended. .
I thought that all the people who stayed at Wanda Ruihua were internet celebrities and young people. As a result, the [Facepalm] swimming pools with babies were all children during the National Day. However, I don’t think the hotel is suitable for very young children, because there is no Any parent-child facilities, the hotel must be aware of this, so every day in the lobby, a clown who makes balloons for children for free is arranged. The clown's skills are the most superb I have ever seen, making shields, bows, and bouquets. It's amazing, the shopping malls can sell dozens or hundreds of them outside, and the children are super happy to get the balloons.
We came by car from the same city. When we finally left, the front desk told us that the parking fee of 120/day can only be waived by booking on Ctrip. Otherwise, we will also be charged for booking on the official website. Fortunately, we booked on Ctrip.
The most surprising thing from this experience is the service. The service of Wanda Ruihua is really good. All the waiters will greet you and respond to you as soon as you need it. I hope it will continue~

msg:The first time I stayed at the Wanda Reign Shanghai Hotel, the location is good, very luxurious, very Wang Sicong, and the experience is very good. Room design, decoration style, high-end bathroom, toiletries, turndown service, bathrobes and pajamas, high-grade bedding, and other facilities details can not be faulted.
Grace.Yu at the front desk was very attentive, considerate and patient to help check in. The Deluxe Pujiang Room is upgraded to the Deluxe Bund Room. The butler service is also very meticulous and helps to solve many subtle problems. Wanda Ruihua's service is truly a home away from home. In addition, I would like to commend Ctrip for a free overnight parking fee when booking a room on Ctrip. Wanda Ruihua's official website doesn't even give it away. This is where the hotel needs to be optimized and upgraded. There is also an electric kettle that does not match the luxurious decoration of the hotel and needs to be optimized. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay experience. Looking forward to the next optimization surprise for me. I have seen a lot of luxury pictures, with a few detailed pictures.

The service of the hotel is very good. Every time we meet, we will take the initiative to say hello to the guests.

Milo's check-in process at the front desk is very professional.
This time I came to the hotel with my children and prepared a lot of gifts for the children. The baby is very happy. Eve's enthusiastic service has further improved my experience. There is a shopping mall on the negative second floor of the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping. You can order room service in the room. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied and a hotel worth choosing.

Every service staff of Wanda Reign is very warm and warm, especially the hotel. Manager Zhang has a strong sense of responsibility, timely service, and actively help us solve problems. As a leader in the hotel, Wanda's hardware facilities are of course needless to say, especially the Japanese restaurant, the environment and taste are first-class.

msg:I booked a hotel because it was for a marriage proposal, so I started to select it from the major hotels in the Bund and Lujiazui about a month ago. Later, because I watched the punch-in video of an up master at station B, I left a good one. Impressed, so I finally chose Wanda Ruihua.
First of all, let me say that the overall feeling of staying is very good. The first impression of the hotel lobby, the external hardware facilities, as well as the service attitude and professionalism of the staff are all very worthy of recognition.
Secondly, I mainly want to say a few points that I feel inadequate in experience:
1. (And what I care about most) As the hotel I chose to propose, I was a little surprised that I didn't receive some blessings or some simple arrangements provided by the hotel from beginning to end. (Pictures are arranged by my friends)
2. The massage chair in the room blocked the biggest selling point of the room - the river view.
3. As a "seven-star" hotel, the air conditioner always switches from the cooling mode to the automatic mode without warning, which is really confusing; the other is that the socket of the hair dryer is very loose, basically it is done by holding the socket by hand. dry.
4. The overall breakfast is not bad, and the staff's service awareness is also very good, that is, the bacon is almost dry than the yak meat...
5. I originally wanted to go swimming, but I didn't know in advance that I needed to prepare a swimming cap. When I arrived at the scene, I was persuaded to quit by 150 swimming caps. Understand the premium for luxury hotels, but hopefully within a reasonable range.

The above is almost the experience of this stay. There are too many good reviews on major platforms so I won’t go into details. I am also an ordinary office worker. Because of important days, I occasionally have a little extravagance. I don’t like to say what is right or wrong. I just share some real feelings for the reference of the hotel and other guests.

If you insist on small shortcomings: there is no children's playground, the swimming pool is relatively small, the room is less cooled during the day, and it is related to the floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the summer.

msg:I have heard about the Wanda Reign Shanghai Hotel. It is a super five-star hotel. The hotel is built according to the 7-star service standard. The hotel is close to the Huangpu River. I booked a Bund room. Nina at the front desk arranged for me a room with a view of Shiliyangchang. The scenery is beautiful and I like it very much. The sanitary environment of the hotel is very good. 2 days, the first day was at the cafeteria on the first floor. The cafeteria has many varieties, and there are many things I want to eat. The price is not expensive, and the price-performance ratio is very high. Yang Yipin dine, the restaurant is 3 Michelin stars, very good, the dishes taste great, the presentation is very beautiful, I can't help but eat more, and I will lose weight next time, hahaha. It is also a Japanese restaurant on the fifth floor. The sashimi is very fresh and refreshing. The layout is very good. The decoration is very pleasant. Cozy, Shanghai Wanda Reign is really a good place for leisure and vacation. I recommend everyone to come. It's a very nice hotel. The hotel is full of works of art. When you walk into the lobby, you will be greeted by a Jingxiu Oriental painting. According to the staff of the hotel, this painting is worth 100 million yuan. I have to say, Wang Sicong, really Proudly, I booked a Bund room. I entered the room at night, and the room was lying on the bed. I could see the ten-mile-long location on the North Bund in Shanghai. If I could see this location, it could only be unique to Wanda Reign Hotel. If you want to see the boundless scenery of the North Bund, you can come to Wanda Reign Hotel. The dishes of the hotel are of high quality and low price. The food court on the first floor is from the cafeteria. She has no time limit. Unlike other hotels, there is only one Half an hour, or 2 hours, the time here can be practical throughout the meal, just like dinner lasts from 5:30 to 9:30 pm, for a full 4 hours, you can eat all the time, isn't it very profitable, the hotel's The location is right at Shiliupu Wharf. The location of the hotel is very good. Go straight ahead is the Bund Street, and behind the hotel is the bfc shopping mall. At the hotel, hahaha, the left side is like the direction of Yu Garden, it is still a scenic spot, you can go shopping if you have nothing to do, and the right side is the location of the pier. You can book a cruise ticket at night and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Huangpu River from a quiet distance. Hotel staff nina, warm service, very attentive, answer any questions, and give us what we want in the room. Compared with other 5 star hotels, the service is really in place, if it is a birthday, an anniversary or something , After booking the room, call the hotel, they remarked, the hotel is equipped with a special housekeeper, there will be corresponding arrangements, very romantic, all in all, in a word, Shanghai Wanda Reign Hotel, you will never regret it, yes Your best choice, hahaha, I will come anyway, and I will recommend more to you, hahaha. I heard that Shanghai Wanda Reign Hotel is famous for its service and can be called Haidilao in the hotel industry.

msg:At first, I thought about having a holiday with my girlfriend, and I hesitated in several five-star hotels by the Huangpu River. Considering that my girlfriend would get up early the next day to go to work in Renguang, and I liked the European-style hotel style, I settled on Wanda Rui. magnificent. When CHECK IN was recommended to register as a member of Wan Yue Club, in fact, it was to upgrade a room with a better view. Facts have proved that although the landscape is not as good as the first-line river views such as the Peninsula, Peace, and Waldorf Astoria, it is also full of ritual to find peace in the middle of the noise. When I checked in, because I didn't understand the concept of Ctrip's flash stay, I thought that I didn't need to pay an additional deposit. Although one of the foreman on duty failed to give me a convincing answer at first, but after understanding it clearly, he even called to explain it. The spirit of seeking knowledge is worthy of praise. The sanitation of the room is above the standard of all aspects. I am a fitness enthusiast, and I pay special attention to the hotel's fitness and wellness services every time I stay in the hotel. The gym and swimming pool are located on the second floor of the hotel and clock in the next morning. Although the sparrow is small and complete, it can be seen that a lot of effort has been spent on equipment maintenance. There is also fruit mineral water inside, and the person in charge will also remind you to wear running shoes to enter. The breakfast is flawless, the service is very warm, and the variety of dishes is rich at first glance, but there are too many sweets and desserts. It is also possible that I am from Shanghai. It is also good for some foreign residents to feel the food of this gang. choose. The parking lot is located in BFC. When I checked out, I took the initiative to consult the vehicle information and exempted the parking fee of 15 yuan per hour. This is very heartwarming for the guests because a night is also a small expense. Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay experience and my girlfriend. There are a few points that need to be improved and hope that the hotel will adopt: 1. The state of the staff, especially the housekeeping depar**ent, needs to be more enthusiastic. Sometimes a smile and a nod can make guests feel at home. 2. The curtain control button on the left side of the floor-to-ceiling window in the room fails. 3. I was woken up by a front desk phone and laundry service when I went back to my room after exercising in the morning. I understand, but I can try a better way. The above opinions are all from my subjective feelings. Of course, it may be a little one-sided. I look forward to staying again!

msg:During the epidemic, it is not necessary to leave the city, so I traveled locally.
The advantages first:
The location is very good. The Bund is at the door. It is very convenient to eat and drink coffee at the BFC next to it. It is less than 500 meters to the Yuyuan City God Temple, just to see the lights.
The Pujiang View Room faces the river view and the Oriental Pearl Tower Shanghai Center. The Bund buildings can be seen from the oblique angle, and the view is great.
The check-in experience from the doorman to the front desk is very good. The decoration style and utensils in the room are also good. The decoration is quite new, there is a capsule coffee machine, and the bathroom is full of beautiful utensils. Especially the hot air balloon crystal chandelier on the coffee table is chic and beautiful. After I went back, I searched everywhere for the same model but couldn't find it. Next time I stay, I want to ask the hotel directly if I can buy it.

shortcoming:
(1) The heating in the Pujiang view room is not enough, and it is necessary to wear a thin sweater indoors when it is opened to 30 degrees. Although the front desk reminded me when I checked in, as someone who has always been afraid of heat, I would feel that the cold is really cold, and the shower is even colder.
(2) The bathroom and toilet have glass doors, and the bathtub is fully open. Always feel that many hotels don't seem to consider that sometimes the occupants may be adult friends or parents and adult children? Embarrassed or not. Even if it's a couple, I'm not happy to be seen on the wc and bathing.
(3) The buffet breakfast and dinner are very general, and there are not many choices. Although the sashimi is still enough. However, it is not as good as the breakfast and dinner buffet at Jinmao Grand Hyatt, which is half the price of the river view room. Although the room size and facilities are much better

The overall environment, facilities and surrounding transportation of the hotel are quite convenient. The service is also great! The hot air balloon chandelier is really nice! As soon as the lights are turned on at night, the scenery of Lujiazui opposite is unobstructed. ❤️In the evening, I also took a tour of the Chenghuang Temple and walked along Fuyou Road for five or six minutes. It is also excellent to see the lights 🙂

msg:After dining in Wanda Ruihua cafeteria countless times, I always wanted to stay one night to experience the blingbling of this hotel. This Spring Festival, I brought LG to stay, and I couldn't stand the temptation of the front desk and upgraded. Generally speaking, hardware, room space design, and service are all first-class. After my girlfriend has stayed in high-star hotels in Shanghai, she commented that this hotel is ranked second, and the first is kept secret. Speaking of a few flaws, because I am a Ctrip member, I gave a welcome fruit worth 40 yuan. Picture 9, the quality and aesthetics are a bit difficult to describe. You must know that as a lady, you have expectations for the welcome fruit. This suggestion is for reference only...

3. The Pujiang house is facing Lujiazui, and I didn’t realize there was a Bund house before. However, it is still possible to see some of the Bund obliquely. The Yuyuan Garden is generally covered, so you can't see it clearly.
4. The hotel is very warm, warm to a little dry.

Overall very good, worth living.

msg:Because we often take our children to stay in the branded five-star hotel
But this time I was a little disappointed with Wanda Reign.
I'll just say it briefly...
1. It is estimated that the hotel has been closed for too long due to the epidemic situation, so there are serious dust mites inside, and the child will keep running nose when entering.
2. The plug port of the hair dryer is loose, and the power is always cut off when blowing hair.
3. The curtain switch is broken, and the blackout curtain cannot be closed alone.
4. There is no smile at the checkin front desk, and there is no good first feeling when entering the hotel.


Maybe only the breakfast service is okay, the waiter will greet you face to face, very kind.

Someone will help you with various things at any time. You don't have to ask yourself. I like that the hotel has a housekeeper service on the day to help clean and fill the things for the day. Next time I want to try it, I can see the rooms on both sides of the Bund and Lujiazui. My girlfriend also gave a small cake for her birthday:) The hotel also has coffee machine capsules There are also tea pots that are very good. You can drink while watching the Huangpu River.
The only downside is the hotel's restaurant. The decoration inside is very good, but the food is really bad, and it may not reach the level of 100 yuan buffet. It's a bit disappointing that the package includes breakfast and dinner. If I knew this, I might not choose The package directly booked the room and then went to their restaurant on the fifth floor to eat a la carte.

The hotel facilities are also very good, the overall style is very comfortable, and the rooms and bathrooms are very clean. I booked a little yellow duck themed room, and the tent, slide and swing were also very nice. (If possible, the swing can be upgraded. It is a little small for a 5-year-old child, but it should be no problem for children under 4 years old)
In terms of catering, since I didn't have dinner at the hotel, I can't comment, but judging from the breakfast, it seems to be good.
As for the view outside the window, it is the most satisfying place. Let’s just take pictures with your mobile phone. I can’t say it’s necessarily the best, but it’s definitely the best value for money. Thank you!
I had a comfortable and warm tenth anniversary and Chris**as with my eldest and youngest daughters. Thank you Wanda.
In addition, the staff here are very nice and I feel very comfortable. Thank you again~

msg:I gave my daughter her twentieth birthday, and I couldn’t leave Shanghai. I have stayed in several riverview hotels in Pudong and finally chose Wanda Ruihua. From the outside, the hardware is indeed hard enough, the decoration is luxurious, and the service in the lobby is also polite and comfortable. The front desk upgraded the deluxe room with Ctrip package and arranged a Yuyuan room on the 18th floor. As a Shanghainese, I can look at the last old city side in Shanghai from a condescending position, but if you are a foreigner, I am afraid that the following is a mess. The breakfast did not match the luxury positioning of the hotel itself. The cold cuts were not what a five-star hotel should have. The lady leader arranged a seat. We picked up the meal and found that the seat was arranged again. All coffee is delivered without a mixing spoon, let alone a butter knife. The cafeteria should not have any view, even if the decoration looks luxurious, it still makes people feel uncomfortable. Let’s talk about a good place for breakfast. There are many varieties of porridge and freshly squeezed juice. Although there are almost no cakes, the desserts taste good. The omelet at the egg stall is quite satisfying, even better than Ritz. The view of the bar on the 21st floor is very good, and the quality and service of the afternoon tea are also acceptable. The wife of the swimming pool is too small, it is simply a large pool. Some things happened on the night of check-in, but the hotel's solution was a bit sincere. In general, the hotel hardware is good, and there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of service. Four points are based on the landscape on the 21st floor and the attitude of the managers on duty to solve problems.

The other room was upgraded to Executive Bund Room 1103, with large glass on both sides. The view is quite shocking, the views of the two rooms are quite impressive, super recommended, of course 1103 is better.
If you are facing the Bund, take Nanjing Road Peace Hotel as a reference, you have to walk a little more than 1km to the right. The entrance of the hotel is on Longtan Road, and the parking entrance has to pass two intersections and turn right.
The hotel's overall service details are very nice, the fruit tea, fruit plate, and sweets delivered by the turn-down service. After the phone call, both rooms gave us children's slippers, bathrobes and toiletries.
I didn't eat the hotel buffet in the evening, and went to ****ing the Heping Hotel. As expected, it was just spending money to buy a feeling, and the food itself should not be too demanding.
Overall a very satisfactory two-day and one-night weekend trip.

The girl at the front desk was very enthusiastic and patient when I checked in. Let me apply for Ruihua membership. Upgraded the executive room with 270 degree Pujiang view at a good price, and also presented a breakfast for one person. Finally, I spent more than 300 yuan to go through the membership procedures. I stayed in the 3888 yuan executive room. I am very happy. Thank you Wang Jiamin at the front desk. Great happiness!
After check-in, the room facilities are generally good, the toilet is smart, the massage chair is also very comfortable, not to mention the 270-degree view, and the floor service is responsive! The shortcomings of the room is that the electric kettle is too broken and has lime scale, which is far from the five-star standard. In addition, there are no drinks from the minibar. You must know that many five-star hotels in Shanghai can give away some for free at least one day.
The hotel’s breakfast is very good, and the overall service is very good. I will continue to consider staying in the holidays in the future!

We booked three rooms at the same time and requested that the three rooms be on the same floor. Coco was patient We deployed and upgraded the Yuyuan room on the 20th floor for us free of charge, which met our needs. The hotel service staff were very friendly. The Huaiyang cuisine on the fifth floor of the hotel was delicious. It was the hotel’s fifth anniversary celebration. Group bought a hotel package, and I will check in for dinner when I have time next time

A little episode happened after I entered the room, but the handling by the front office manager Terry still made me feel the Ruihua brand's service awareness and service concept. I upgraded the room and personally Re-checked, warm and thoughtful, handled properly, and give Terry likes it!
It is hoped that the management side can continue to improve the management level, avoid the short-term confusion when unexpected events occur, and improve the customer experience!

I don't want to keep calling people to get things if there is a problem. It disturbs the rest. I hope you can regularly check whether the equipment and facilities in the room can be used normally.

Because there is only one theme for each child in the hotel, it is recommended that you do not hesitate to enjoy the experience, and the experience cannot be replicated~ Especially suitable for mothers with babies~ Baby playing on the slides, mothers can make tea and watch the river view to relax. The hotel presents fruit and biscuits very intimately when checking in, and it is also very user-friendly when checking out, without queuing. The room facilities are smart, with visual door control very safe. On weekends, Mr. Clown will make balloons for children in the lobby. The hotel is suitable for family trips and family gatherings~

1. The gate is slightly small and does not have the style of a five-star hotel, but there is no way for a small amount of money. Someone helps to take the luggage and open the door;
2. There is a welcome drink, it is too hot on the day, and the ice drink is simply sending charcoal in the snow;
3. The room is a river view room with a good view, but the "corkscrew" is blocked;
4. I made a cup of capsule coffee in the room in the afternoon, just when I was thinking of something to eat, I delivered a wealth of snacks and fruits, which was awesome
5. I made a late appoin**ent with a friend to have afternoon tea in the lobby. Booking on Ctrip is more cost-effective and the taste is good
6. In the evening, I went to the top floor and had a cocktail. The price is a bit more expensive than other hotels. French fries are delicious, but the cocktail is not as good as W
7. Breakfast is enough to eat, not too many varieties, but definitely enough
8. The fly in the oin**ent is the swimming pool, which is a bit disappointing. There is no five-star standard at all. The kick is not straight, there is a line in the bathroom, and there is no sauna pool;
Next time if you don’t check in, it’s because of this pool, others are very satisfied

msg:The hotel welcome service is very good, and then there is a series of troubles:
1: Check-in procedures, poor attitude;
2: Fruits delivered to the room will be delivered to the room at 10 pm;
The third point, I want to say the most serious thing:
Checking out the next day, after leaving the store, the front desk called and said that the tablet computer in the room was lost. In order to prove my innocence, I went back decisively and opened all the suitcases and backpacks for them to check. The video, even the Didi taxi I took, was checked by them. I saved the video. Then, two high-speed trains were delayed. The final result of the investigation was: their waiter cleaned the room, and the tablet computer waiter took it by himself. I left and forgot to put it back in the room. When I checked out, another waiter told the front desk that it was lost. It was a problem with their internal management. However, they found it and gave me an innocence, but the front desk called me and asked me to put it. Where is it, let me think hard, and I have never seen it! I even thought of what positioning, there are other ways, this is the management of Wanda Reign Hotel, I feel that I have been greatly insulted, a second-hand tablet computer touched by thousands of people, the guests paid a few thousand dollars deposit to stay in the hotel , May it be taken away? However, the brain circuit of their managers thinks that the guests have moved the computer, and I am also very angry. Now even the Express Hotel is not managed like this. I have saved all the screenshots and all the videos before and after the incident. I live here. A hotel makes me unforgettable, who is embarrassing?

房間的傢俱不知道是時間久了還是啥，看起來比較陳舊斑駁，床邊更沒發看，破破爛爛的，但是不影響閨蜜跨年的快樂心情。
初一退房後在大廳溜達，一位服務枱小姐姐過來詢問入住感受，實話實説，表示房間床，傢俱偏陳舊，應當適當改善。小姐姐聽説後表示抱歉，並且一定要送小禮物。看看小姐姐比較誠心，我同意了，稍微等了10分鐘左右，拿了一瓶餐前酒過來送給我。我表示不用了，家裡紅酒太多了，沒必要。這時小姐姐還想送我，並且表示需要我當面在攜程上寫好評。此時性質就改變了，不是為了表達歉意，而是要寫好評。侮辱人嗎？
開車離開時，一位什麼經理打電話過來，表示下次入住時會免費升級房間。我需要嗎？搞事情嗎？

辦了延時退房到兩點，並不像有些酒店到了一點就開始提醒。
唯一的不足就是酒店門口是臨時停車，想要停車有點繞，不是很方便。
總的來説很舒適，體驗很好，下次還回來。

從大堂經理到禮賓部到清潔阿姨都非常專業，非常有禮貌，熱情有分寸，沒有那種有的奢華酒店的高傲感。入住快，大堂經理親自帶到電梯，禮賓部小哥不用提醒自動把大件行李全部放在客房衣帽間行李架上，熱情耐心的帶客人介紹二樓的設施。這些細節上的服務質素絲毫不比文華東方還有隔壁華爾道夫悦榕莊費爾蒙我都住過）這些的差，甚至更好。
大堂裝修大氣，客房風格和用料也奢華精緻，但絲毫不顯舊，很喜歡斑竹紋理的門和門框，加了中式高雅風。我最喜歡的是客房門有電子貓眼顯示屏，叫服務員能看到門外是誰，套房設計裏卧室和洗手間分明，卧室看不到亂七八糟的鏡子讓中式迷x人士非常有安全感！酒店雖然在馬路邊，但防噪做的很不錯，這種安全感讓我這樣住酒店習慣睡不好的人睡得很安心！
驚喜還有就是衞生間區域特別有取暖，冬天走在上面也很舒服。除了智能馬桶戴森吹風機咖啡機這些標配，細節做得好的地方還有，化粧鏡的高度對東方人身高也很友好！另外浴袍絲質很舒服，不是很多酒店那種又厚又像毛巾的實際上很難穿。
雖然酒店客房是老派奢華風，但燈光窗簾Bose音響Pad自動按鍵的又現代科技感俱全，皮質按摩椅真的在晚上放鬆時非常實用。
因為升級到270度套房，所以外灘和陸家嘴卧室和浴室都能看到而且景色絕佳，窗户也打理的非常乾淨，這個價格與外灘同類的相比太值了！
早餐下午茶的服務也很有禮貌，下午茶的咖啡好喝。
Check out的時候看到很多老外入住，以後一定會再次選擇這裏，支持我們自己國有的豪華酒店品牌！

msg:我住的還是套房呢，除了晚上的夜景好看一點，其他一無是處，那個早餐都趕不上外面的早餐店，種類特別少，具難吃，我們在酒店的中餐廳吃的晚餐，味道極不推薦，還是和平飯店的飯更好吃，那個服務就不要提了，差到極致，説話都是不搭理你，就餐期間不斷的被打擾，推銷卡，那個服務員在那站着，擋着你都坐不下，還是我自己讓他讓一下，還極不情願給我讓了一下。一點都不推薦。

msg:説走就走的旅行，一場完美的邂逅!酒店與與陸家嘴隔江相望，地理位置得天獨厚，並且酒店緊鄰bfc，購物等距離豫園、城隍廟、外灘步行即可到達!酒店環境奢華衞生，大氣磅礴，工作人員Daisy服務熱情、熱心。大堂是採用了Art deco 的裝飾方法，很高挑，大堂看着金碧輝煌的，非常漂亮，復古藝術氣息濃厚，奢華有內涵。酒店整體氛圍是奢華古典，並且酒店是琳琅滿目的藝術品，很藝術。酒店門前就有一個雕塑，很精緻典雅。[藝術品]
酒店裡共有百來件價值不菲的藝術品復古宮廷風格的每個角落都充斥着富麗華貴之感還有很多件藝術品分別擺放在酒店各處比如check-in櫃枱旁，電梯廳，餐廳，走道...每件藝術品旁還有介紹，彷彿一場文化之旅，這裏的房間有不同的景觀
面對外灘美景，浦江江景，或者豫園景觀房間裝飾融合海派元素，洗手間“鑲金裹玉”，全大理石搭配鑲金的水龍頭，充滿了奢華感覺。床睡的超舒服，後來一查是美國Talalay乳膠手工製造，造價20多萬。我感覺一天都可以在上面[餐廳]
下午茶可以選在酒店一樓大堂酒廊也可以去21層的「瑞酷」來個下午茶，入口處好似teamlab的感應燈光秀，晚上來這裏露台小酌一杯

從一進門的那一刻起，我就被酒店的高端大氣所震撼。大堂寬敞明亮，裝飾典雅，每一處細節都透露出品味與質感。辦理入住手續時，前台的服務人員bella態度熱情周到，耐心解答我的各種疑問，讓我感到非常舒心。
我的房間寬敞明亮，裝飾精美。柔軟的床榻，讓我彷彿陷入了雲朵之中，一夜好眠。浴室的設施也非常齊全，淋浴設備、浴缸、吹風機等一應俱全，讓我享受到了極致的舒適體驗。
酒店的餐飲也是一大亮點。早餐豐富多樣，中西式美食應有盡有，讓我大快朵頤。晚餐時，我選擇了酒店的自助餐廳，各種美食琳琅滿目，讓我眼花繚亂。每一道菜都精緻美味，讓我回味無窮。
此外，酒店還提供了各種娛樂設施，如健身房、游泳池、SPA等，讓我在忙碌的旅途中得到了充分的放鬆和享受。
總的來説，這家五星級酒店給我留下了深刻的印象。無論是硬件設施還是服務質量，都達到了非常高的水平。在這裏，我感受到了賓至如歸的温暖和舒適。如果有機會，我一定會再次選擇入住這家酒店，並向我的朋友們推薦它。
這次的入住體驗讓我對五星級酒店有了全新的認識，也讓我更加期待下一次的旅行。

不過很快幫我們換了新的房間，免費贈送了水果餐飲

閑逛酒店去聆聽那些巧妙地融入了白玉蘭、蘇綉等海派元素的 Art Deco 設計之音，"優雅精緻"從大堂到前台，從電梯廳到走廊，從客房到名仕會被演繹得淋漓盡致。
我住的江景房位置極好，將黃浦江、外灘、十六鋪等上海標誌性維度輕鬆拿捏。再加上房間裏量身定製的，全套傢俱擺設以及藝術品，讓人夢迴上世紀二十年代。Eve的介紹真的太精彩了。讓人夢迴上世紀二十年代上海的繁華如夢與霓虹絢爛。

1、辦理入住的前台，感覺欠了她錢，全程接待吝嗇得一丁點微笑也沒有給出。更別提，等待時間那麼久説聲抱歉了；
2、入住當晚，身體不適有點發燒，打電話給前台需要冰塊物理降温。座機連續撥打快捷服務不少於10分鐘，無人接聽。後面改為手機打酒店對外公開的聯繫方式，不管選擇1訂房還是2諮詢，一樣無人接聽，這個真的是非常惱火的一個事情，定位這麼高的一個奢華酒店夜晚不安排人值班的嗎？？電話終於接通，提醒儘快送上來，又是等了好幾分鐘……所謂的管家服務了？？！！

-
環境：因為是標榜的七星級，整體環境也好，設計也好都很符合自己的審批，我對象都直呼家裡以後新房裝修都想參考的程度
-
服務：yoki從開始的選房環節就幫了我很大的忙，後面的各種備註裝飾啊還有各種協助我演戲，總之讓我有種賓至如歸的感覺，其他人也非常熱情，在各種程度上提現了管家式服務
-
早餐：説實話出差去的五星級酒店也很多，感覺酒店早餐都大差不差，但是這邊的麪條還是給我了小驚喜，非常符合我的口味，炫了一整碗！

1.酒店給安排的朝北的房間，打開落地窗連江邊都看不到，呵呵……   看到的是一片待拆遷的棚户區（看圖為證）
2.早餐幾乎沒有什麼特色，可以選擇的也不多哦。那也不是最重要的，太太喝了杯橙汁，喝到了噁心的白色顆粒，服務生和經理異口同聲的説肯定是果粒，我們真的是無語了，後來我們趕時間也就不計較了。
3.綜述：真的是體驗感太差了，服務質量、裝修設計、餐飲服務……，其實我們真的衹是想要你們酒店給個態度而已……

既然是這個檔次的賓館，作為客人期望就高了，就得挑剔點：￼我覺得前台￼登記的人員毫無五星級的熱情的感覺，登記手續比較慢，為什麼不給客人送杯飲料呢？絕對需要改進。複印材料收$10人民幣￼一張真是太小氣了。

首先，入住沒有迎賓水果（攜程上訂的都應該有）
這樣級別的五星酒店還在用200的吹風機，不是説不行，但是參考一下其他五星酒店吧
洗完澡花灑還滲水吱吱響，但是太晚了也懶得折騰找前台
雖然當晚的入住體驗一般，但是隔天退房的時候酒店的Kay也有詢問入住體驗以及向酒店反饋，並且想給我們提供補償。

msg:入住兩次，感受一同評價。同價格區間的酒店裡應該算是較差的。第一次攜程訂的，可能出於平台壓力，有管家提前一天給你打電話確認，入住後一段時間管家會再次致電詢問意見。但是有趣的是，雖然説是管家，但衹有她能聯繫到你，你有問題是聯繫不到他的。還有停車場，我並不介意2000+的酒店停車場額外收費，但起碼保證客人找得到吧，事實上是如果你第一次自駕去，幾乎沒可能找得到酒店樓下的地下停車區域，導致我付款了兩次停車費。第二次入住**訂的，那是真的什麼都沒有。你能想到這級別的酒店該有的統統都沒有，你能想到可能收費的倒是基本都收費。天冷了才知道所謂每間房花費多少的酒店連地暖都沒有。酒店除了地段基本一無是處。應該不會再有下次了。

msg:此行為母親慶祝生日，選擇了萬達瑞華酒店，主要看中酒店的地理位置，出門左手豫園右手外灘。
客觀評價一下酒店的優缺點，大家自行參考~
先説優點：
1、裝修確實豪華，大廳富麗堂皇，隨處可見的藝術品和畫作，房間也用了大量的大理石和銅金，喜歡土豪風的可以沖。
2、景色不錯，這個位置浦東浦西都能欣賞。
3、外灘房的按摩椅和Boss音響使用感都很不錯。
4、客房服務響應及時，送水送東西基本五分鐘內送到。
5、母親生日贈送了蛋糕，做了玫瑰花簡單佈置。
再説缺點：
1、我預訂的外灘房，當天入住登記時給到的房間景色被電視機遮擋，且房間裏沒有按摩椅。預訂前特意確認過外灘以上房型是有按摩椅的，感覺就是一間普通江景房，但和酒店溝通更換房間時被告知説不是所有外灘房都有按摩椅？？？雖然之後酒店妥善解決了，但那一瞬間挺不爽的，所買非所得。
2、自助早餐很一般，品種少味道just soso
3、歡迎水果比較寒酸，還有這個價位的酒店竟然首輪minibar不是🆓的，有點失望。
4、也不算缺點，因為地理位置關係，酒店遊客比較多，還有碰到旅遊團的可能性。

下午出去用餐，在大堂等車，e小姐送來了兔子掛件送給小寶寶，孩子開心的不得了，禮賓部叫車也是十分速度，不到5min就到達酒店門口了，下雨忘記帶傘了，e小姐及時為我們送上了雨傘，這一切都是那麼的讓我感動。
晚上去餐廳用餐，餐廳也是很濃的春節氣氛，裝飾的超漂亮的，沉迷在美景裏，大年三十夜晚，餐廳還特意請來了著名的書法家為客人提字，我們拿到了一堆春聯，得到了一個好彩頭，真的是太開心了，第二天臨走的時候，e小姐特意過來送我們出門，還為我們送上了春節祝福語，真的超級Nice，這麼棒的的酒店，肯定是我會反覆選擇的地方。並且會分享給我的朋友們。

除了這個外其他沒什麼問題，酒店服務和地點都非常好，員工熱情而且反應速度快，景色很美，如果想看全景這裏的確是個不錯選擇

msg:風格非常典雅，富麗堂皇，步入大堂，一種上世紀二、三十年代的artdeco設計撲面而來，位置東臨浦江，西接豫園，外灘黃浦江上，靠近16鋪碼頭，也是上海最著名的碼頭，位置很好。一覽無餘十里洋場，景觀絕對不會差，遠眺陸家嘴的繁華，房間藍牙設備音響效果特別好。
露台下午茶也是必打卡項目，近賞外灘百年萬國建築，如此江景擁有這樣的下午茶真的很不錯。
Eve小姐的晚餐安排，完整了我們的一天，自助餐廳，食材用料講究，蝦肉個頭很飽滿，每一口都是享受。
服務也很好，響應速度很快，更加期待下一次到來。

整個酒店所選的藝術品都是和酒店氣質相符合的，大唐正中央聚福油畫以上海為時代背景，既有東方神韻又有西方格調的東方明珠-上海的繁花似錦。
服務和管理做的都非常好，是一個住過一次願意再次回來的酒店，此次是Eve小姐接待的，感受到很親切，給我們提供出行便利，十分細心。
用餐區做的也很好，口感符合我們的要求，儘管可能滿足客户需求，吃得好，住的也好，服務也好，肯定是值得信賴的品牌。希望未來有更多的機會選擇瑞華。

參觀完整棟樓，發現裏面非常有內涵，被藝術品包圍着，眾多的藝術品你可以從旁邊的二維碼裏獲取訊息，找到其中的故事，在不經意間一枚雕法精湛的手工吊燈就在你身旁。玉蘭花元素融入的恰到好處。Eve小姐對藝術品講的非常專業，值得一提。頂層瑞酷餐廳，有整個上海灘，無敵的江景，對面便是浦東的天際線。黃浦江盡收眼底哦，這裏的下午茶，海鮮和香檳很不錯。
Eve十分周到，讓我們整個行程方便了不少。

記得Eve小姐身穿定製旗袍，真是太美了，大堂好像也變得靈動起來，服務也好很好，雙雙在線，鼓勵鼓勵。五星水準就是不一樣哈。選擇的房間景色優美，床睡得很舒服，後來一查才發現原來是美國Talalay乳膠手工製造。
頂樓下午茶瑞酷更是有趣，入口處號好似teamlab的燈光秀，露台小酌一杯真是太舒服了，

msg:我在攜程上定的房間，上面是送我一份禮物，我也不知道，酒店也沒人告訴我，等我坐上高鐵酒店給我打電話，説沒有去領，我説你們沒有人告訴我一聲嗎，然後説給我郵寄，運費到付，這麼大的酒店就這個服務，到那裡辦理入住，帶着孩子拖着行李，也沒有服務員幫我把行李送到房間，還讓我給好評，真是無語了
