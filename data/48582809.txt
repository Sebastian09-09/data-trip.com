The location is good and you can find delicious food within walking distance. It is suitable for self-driving tourists, and the underground garage is large enough. The lobby is quite grand, and there are Yangming Study, Japanese food store, etc. going in. The restaurant on the first floor is very large and the breakfast is quite rich. I took my baby to the swimming pool for an hour in the morning. The environment is good. There are three areas: massage pool, shallow pool, and deep pool. Of course, the most satisfactory thing is the room itself. The area is large enough and the layout is cute enough. There is a row of ducks on the bathtub, which surprised the children. If you are a girl family, don't miss the Snow White parent-child room!

First of all, the grand lobby is my first impression of this hotel🙏🙏🙏. The high ceilings and gorgeous decorations make people feel very comfortable and luxurious. The lobby also has a comfortable lounge area and reception area, which makes guests feel happy while waiting to check in or check out🌹🌹🌹.
The cleanliness of the guest rooms is my second impression of this hotel. The room decoration is tall and grand, the facilities are complete, and the bedding is also very comfortable🌹🌹🌹. The daily housekeeping service is also very in place, making guests feel at home.
The good service of the waiter is my third impression of this hotel.

The hotel is only a few minutes' drive from Yuyao North Station, making it convenient for guests to travel to other cities or regions. In addition, the transportation around the hotel is also very convenient, and it is easy to reach the commercial district.

The hotel is just a stone's throw away from Yuyao North Station, which provides great convenience for my business trip. Whether it is a quick shuttle between cities or a day trip to other cities, it seems extremely easy [wow][wow]. 9

What is even more unique is that the hotel cleverly incorporates the theme of Yangming culture, which gives me a deeper understanding and experience of Chinese philosophy and culture. [Victory][Victory] The design details in the room and the artistic decorations in the public areas all reflect a tribute to Wang Yangming and his thoughts, allowing people to enjoy a modern stay while also feeling the profound cultural heritage.

Of course, as a five-star accommodation, Ningbo Bright Hotel is no less impressive in catering services [666][666][666]. The breakfast selection is rich and varied, with fresh fruits, hot snacks and freshly ground coffee, all of which inject vitality into my morning. The buffet dinner is a feast for the taste buds, from authentic Chinese cuisine to international cuisine, each dish is carefully prepared by professional chefs to ensure the quality and taste of the food [Wang Chai][Wang Chai].

In addition to the superior geographical location and rich dining services, the hotel's service staff is also worthy of praise. [Rose][Rose][Rose]They always greet every guest with enthusiasm, and their attentive service makes the entire accommodation experience more warm [strong][strong][strong].

The breakfast is very diverse, and the Japanese side dishes such as clams, yellow mud snails, crab legs and sake are the highlights. There was no yellow croaker noodles during the May Day holiday. The air conditioning adjus**ent in the sigh room was buggy, and it was cold one day and hot the next.
The swimming pool is good. I borrowed a swimming ring and a floating board, and the children had fun.
The lobby is large, bright and comfortable, and the reception is OK.
The charging piles are in the underground parking lot, and the number is sufficient.
The Yangmingxuan on the second floor is of first-class quality, good service attitude, and great environment. It's really good. The Japanese food on the first floor is also great.
The main complaint is the lobby bar. I had afternoon tea, and two foreigners smoked and even sent ashtrays. The advice was ineffective, and the complaint was useless at the beginning. It took a long time to solve it, and the afternoon tea was not solved for an hour. Later, they apologized and sent fruits, etc., hey

msg:On the last day of the May Day holiday, I chose Yuyao Bright Hotel. I booked in advance and noted in the order that the room was above the 10th floor, facing the sun, and quiet, and the hotel confirmed it. But when checking in, the handsome guy in uniform at the front desk told me that there were no rooms above the 10th floor, only the 6th floor. I showed the order, and the order showed that the hotel had agreed to my check-in request, so I changed the floor and checked in on the 11th floor, but when I checked in the room, it faced north, and there was an air-conditioning fan downstairs, which was noisy. I returned to the lobby to negotiate, and another handsome guy at the front desk who was not in uniform immediately changed to the 14th floor. The room was facing the sun and quiet, indicating that there were rooms facing the sun above the 10th floor of the hotel. On the day of check-in, it was already more than 5 pm when I arrived at the hotel. In order to change rooms, the guests went up and down the stairs and were very tired, and their mood for vacation was greatly affected. The overall feeling is that because of the room booked on Ctrip, the hotel is not very friendly to guests. I hope that Ctrip officials will strengthen communication with the hotel and look forward to Ctrip guests having a good check-in experience.

The only thing I want to complain about is the curtain in this room. I have stayed in so many hotels, but this is the only one with a transparent curtain!
You can see it when you take a shower or go to the toilet! Change it quickly. It doesn't even provide basic privacy protection.

msg:A hotel whose quality far exceeds its price, this is a highly recommended local hotel in Yuyao.

Normally it costs about 400 per night for two breakfasts, but the result of staying here far exceeded expectations!

Let me start by boasting about the breakfast, which can even be said to be luxurious! Better than many big-name chains selling for thousands of dollars! The noodle stall has Ningbo specialty yellow croaker noodles, and there are no limited quantities. Other choices are also very rich, including Yuyao special sauce duck, big cakes, etc. The noodle stall is also very strong. Many items are freshly made by the aunt, and there are even unlimited shrimp dumplings. .

The Western food stall also offers bacon, chicken drumsticks, egg tarts, etc. Although the juice is a bit weak, it also provides fresh yogurt!

The room is big enough, a little bigger than the hotel's own promotional picture, and spacious enough.

The service is also good, the number of fruits delivered exceeds that of the Nanjing Ritz-Carlton, and sweet soup is also delivered in the evening.

Although the hardware is not too outstanding, it has everything it needs.

The gym and swimming pool are also well equipped and the swimming pool is big enough! Mountain view swimming pool, sauna and room temperature pool facilities are very complete.

Wang Yangming elements can be seen everywhere in the hotel, and it is indeed a hotel with heart.

The only drawback is that the room heating is too adequate and too hot.

msg:The hotel is great. I often come to Yuyao for business trips and have stayed in several hotels. I usually stay in Pacific Hotels. I found this one is better and newer, and the staff are very enthusiastic and polite. I will come again next time🤭 I especially praise the auntie who made Qingtuan for breakfast. It happened to be Qingming Festival these few days and I had delicious Qingtuan. I was very happy🥳The auntie's surname is Ni, if I remember correctly😅

msg:The hotel is in a good location. There is a shopping mall and a place to eat supper nearby, which is very convenient. You can park directly on the roadside. If you go late, you may have to park downstairs. The room is not bad, with welcome fruits and pumpkin porridge, which is very warm. The bedding is very comfortable, especially the pillow is moderately soft and hard. The bath products are actually from Jasmine! I like it very much. The breakfast is also very good, especially the freshly made wontons are very delicious. You can also DIY salty paste and tofu pudding by yourself, which is delicious😋The only drawback is that the TV is a bit old and cannot be cast on the screen, everything else is very good👍👍👍

msg:In recent years, when I return to Yuyao to visit relatives, I always choose to stay at Braite because it has a high-end atmosphere, comfortable bedding, large bath water, fast WiFi, free parking, and a rich breakfast. Next to Zhongan Plaza, you don’t have to worry about eating, drinking and having fun. However, the temperature was high during the Spring Festival this year. It was too hot in the room and there was no air conditioning, making it uncomfortable to sleep. Yuyao people really want to get rich. At 0 o'clock on the fifth day of the ***** New Year, they set off fireworks in the middle of the road, and the passing vehicles honked their horns to avoid them. The Hilton in Yuyao is about to open, and Brat's status in my heart is shaky.

Dessert red bean paste and fruit plate are delivered to the room every night. It is higher quality than similar hotels in some big cities. There are too many. The facilities and service standards are equivalent to those of foreign-related hotels. It is very comfortable. I originally booked a two-night trip. If it hadn't rained later, I would have wanted to stay for another two nights. The lady at the front desk was also very enthusiastic. I will come again next time.

The temperature of the constant-temperature swimming pool was just right. There were many kinds of buffets in the morning. The hotel is very close to Yangming Ancient Street. The lantern show at night was very beautiful. This was the only time I stayed here. A slight drawback is that I ordered lunch at 11 o'clock the next day. I called after 12 o'clock to ask why the order was not delivered yet but was missed. In the end, I didn't get it until after one o'clock. Maybe the waiters were too short during the Spring Festival to take care of me. Others are generally very satisfied.

Environment: The location is good. There is a shopping mall not far away. It is very convenient for eating and shopping.

Breakfast: There are quite a lot of varieties, and there is also a big yellow croaker noodle, but the yellow croaker has a bit of fishy smell and doesn’t feel very fresh. The freshly made egg pancakes taste very good.

Overall very good

msg:I accompanied my husband on a nostalgic trip to Yuyao for 4 days before the National Day and stayed at the Brat Hotel for 3 nights. The reason why I chose Brat is because I saw the pictures and videos posted by my friends in the circle of friends when they went to the hotel in Yuyao to attend a relative's wedding banquet. They were very high-end and elegant, and the online search score was very high. After checking in this time, I feel really great! This is a hotel with a very good service attitude. First of all, the staff at the hotel door take the trouble to open and close the car door for every guest who gets off the car at the hotel door with a smile. (The hotel's underground parking lot is large and you can take the elevator directly to the hotel lobby). Inside the hotel Regardless of whether it is the reception, front desk or other staff, they always smile and say hello to the guests when they see them. The lobby is luxurious and grand. I booked a deluxe twin room. The front desk staff checked in very quickly, and their request for a room on a higher floor was also met. The mountain view room on the 20th floor was very nice. What was even better was that I checked in on the 28th. The girl at the front desk said that the 29th was the Mid-Autumn Festival and gave me a mooncake delivery coupon for the hotel. You can get it at the coffee bar in the lobby. A box of mooncakes. After receiving the mooncakes, I drank a 168 yuan afternoon tea for two with my husband at the coffee bar. The appearance and taste were good. Room 2005 was clean and spacious. The cloakroom can store a lot of luggage and clothes. Two 1.35-meter-wide The bed is of moderate softness and hardness, making it very comfortable to sleep on. The bathroom is also very large, with dry and wet separations. The bath water is large and the water temperature is comfortable. There is also a large bathtub for guests who like to take a bath. Nongfu Spring, fruits and candies are placed at the elevator entrance of each floor. You can pick them up for free, which is very considerate! Every night, either fruit, mung bean soup or fruit, moon cakes and yogurt are given as gifts. The turndown service they provide is very warm. The hotel has a rich variety of Chinese and Western buffets in the morning. I had yellow croaker noodles for three consecutive days. Because there were so many people wanting to eat yellow croaker noodles, a large pot of yellow croaker toppings cooked in the kitchen was gone after a while, and I had to wait again. It is cooked in the kitchen, so hotel guests who really want to eat must be patient and wait in line for a while. The hotel is not far from Yangming Ancient Town, Wang Yangming's Former Residence, and Yuyao Museum. It is about 2 kilometers away. It is also convenient to take a taxi. The Hemudu Site Museum and the thousand-year-old Jinguan Village are all worth visiting. The nearby Zhongan Plaza is very lively and has many restaurants, which can definitely solve your dining problem. I heard that the swimming pool and gym on the third floor of the hotel are good. Unfortunately, I just spent the past two days playing and eating, so I didn’t have time to exercise. I also brought my swimsuit for nothing. I will definitely make up for this regret when I come back in the future!

I arrived at the hotel after 14:00 on the same day to check into two deluxe double rooms. I requested that they be arranged on the same floor as much as possible. The front desk did their best! After completing the check-in, staff will accompany you to the room floor for check-in. Heartwarming~

Environment: The surrounding environment of the hotel is definitely average. You can see the mountains and villa area on one side, and the busy night view of Yuyao on the other. The environment in the hotel is okay, clean and quiet overall!

Unexpectedly, after I arrived, the hotel upgraded me to a deluxe suite for free. I called in advance to reserve one. A small bed, the hotel had already prepared it for us when we arrived! The room I stayed in was generally clean and tidy. Because my baby likes to crawl around and explore the world, I wiped the floor with wet paper towels in advance and found it to be quite clean. Stayed for two days and was very satisfied. The hotel also thoughtfully prepared welcome fruit snacks. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the hotel’s robot food delivery is excellent!

msg:1. I originally booked a room due to the hotel's location advantage. It is about ten minutes' drive from Yuyao North Station and is convenient for travel.

2. The hotel’s facilities and services score full plus points. The overall facilities are very new, and the Yangming study room in the lobby is very unique. When I entered the room and opened the curtains, I saw a green mountain, which was very surprising. The tea sets and pots in the room were carefully picked, especially the two vigorous foxtail grasses. I stayed here for two nights and received fruits and hot porridge, which is very suitable for young people who go to bed late to replenish a little energy.

3. The surrounding environment is very quiet, not in a busy city, but there is a business district within walking distance, making it easy to eat and shop, which is very convenient. There is a farmhouse about a hundred meters away. It has local seafood, and the environment and dishes are very nice.

4. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, the hotel gives away mooncake gift boxes. The packaging is portable and not out of stock. I think it’s a good gift. Because of the very pleasant stay experience, I bought a few boxes at the hotel to give to my family and friends. The staff helped me mail them. I will follow up on the taste evaluation. I believe it will not be bad.

msg:The location of the hotel is still very good. It is adjacent to Zhong'an Square. It is convenient to eat and drink nearby. By the way, there is a restaurant next door to the hotel that eats stewed chicken hot pot. Speaking of which, the hotel hardware is almost impeccable. The deluxe twin room is on the 19th floor, quiet and comfortable. The room is huge and spread out, and the quietness of the air conditioner is a surprise. Small speakers enhance the fun. We did our homework beforehand and headed for the bathtub. We brought our own bathtub cover and bath salt, which was a great comfort to us after we had trekked hard for most of the day on the Hongling Ancient Trail. The bedding and toiletries are very good. The bathrobes and spare bedding are all individually packaged, so they are clean and safe. The slippers are updated every day and are of excellent quality. If the toilet is a smart toilet, it is perfect. The breakfast is useless, with a little less variety, and the yellow croaker noodles are a surprise.
The waiters in the ba*****t and lobby are warm and thoughtful. The receptionists at the front desk are friendly and professional, and the room service staff are enthusiastic and responsive.
If you come to Yuyao again, Bright is a must-choice hotel.

Unfortunately, you can’t find coffee. There are local special yellow fish noodles and Liang Nong big cake. The receptionist and check-out invoice are very patient. There seems to be some in the lobby There is a reading room with books and cultural and creative products in it. It feels better than international big-name hotels. The price is also very beautiful, and the overall cost performance is high. It is suggested that the hotel can launch cost-effective local specialties for sale, which is convenient for travelers who do not have time to shop.

Because the child had a cold and wanted to take a bath at night, I mentioned it to Feng Meili at the front desk. The beautiful sister changed it immediately. For rooms with bathtubs, they also offer bathtub membranes, which is great. The room facilities are pretty good, very clean, and the bedding is very comfortable. The breakfast is quite rich. Since it is the May Day holiday, there are many people, but the waiters are responsive and have a very good attitude. Although there are many people, the feeling is quite good. In particular, the coffee is delicious. There is also a small children's playground in the breakfast area. The children like it very much and have a lot of fun. The hotel's swimming pool should be praised, there is a doll pool, there is a jacuzzi, and the water quality is good! In short, it is a hotel worth staying in. There are not many hotels like this in Yuyao, and I will still stay here in the future.

Time not only does not admit mistakes, but directly gives us what is born
The same goes for the management. When we took the elevator, the doors were closed, and he came over to open the elevator door again. After entering, he didn’t apologize at all. He felt that he was also a guest, and pushed us away with confidence and pressed the elevator floor button.
Such a hotel charges the price of a 5-star high-end hotel. It does not make people feel any 5-star high-end service. I will never stay there again

In addition, although the hotel is new, there are stains on the sheets, bathtubs, and carpets that have not been cleaned.
  In short, the location is remote and the hotel hardware and software services are very poor. If it were not for a meeting, I would never stay in this hotel again in my life..

msg:伯瑞特應該是餘姚當地最好的酒店之一，酒店免費升級到行政房。酒店很安靜，能讓我逃離能城市的喧囂睡個好覺。早餐也不錯 ，用餐人不多，還有黃魚麪哦！下面説説這次入住體驗不足之處：1，入住第一天房間衞生間台盆上方牆面滲水，導致第二天一早台盆上都是水。2，空調滴水管堵住導致房間也滴水。以上2點問題聯繫酒店後都馬上解決了。3，空調突然不製冷，在我出遊離開酒店前就和前台反應問題望他們解決，但當我時隔5個多小時後回到房間後，問題依舊沒有解決。我再次撥打電話，好在酒店響應比較快最終也解決了問題。我希望貴酒店在客人入住前檢查下各方面的硬件設施以免給住客帶來不便。

客房服務也很及時，有什麼需要就打個電話就可以，不用到前台去，電話基本上都是秒接的。並且外賣也有機器人送上樓，對於我這種比較宅比較懶的人簡直不要太方便。
酒店三樓還有健身房和泳池，有空的時候也能去放鬆一下，附近還有一個叫陽明古鎮的景點，很適合晚上出門散步閑逛。
退房的時候前台的工作人員依舊很熱情，還提醒了我停了車的話需要掃一下停車碼，非常的方便。真的是一家很不錯的酒店，下次來餘姚也會選擇入住！

房間挺大的，沒有異味，床睡着也很舒服，房間隔音也不錯，睡了個好覺。
酒店旁邊就是商場，逛商場買東西吃飯什麼的都很方便。入住那天下午我在大堂吧那邊看了一會書，那邊挺有氛圍的，很適合下午去閑坐看書，糕點也很好吃。晚上回房間的時候酒店這邊還送了一份歡迎水果，水果也很新鮮。
總的來説這家酒店真的很不錯，停車場很大，很方便，出場的時候前台掃碼就可以！！！入住體驗非常棒，有機會來餘姚還會選這家酒店，強烈推薦！！

另外一間還好，但是少個浴缸🤣
還有就是為什麼要這樣一個升降浴簾，
要知道家庭出遊我們帶孩子出來，晚上透過這個浴簾
其實是可以看到裏面的，外面燈光關掉廁所燈打開的情況，你們可以試試看，其實可以看得清楚的。
還有，第二天的早餐，亂哄哄的，服務人員都來不及收拾，感覺都沒什麼好吃的東西，希望改進吧！酒店整體還是很氣派的，這個價位不算貴。位置也不錯！

菜品中規中矩，沒什麼出彩的，味道也不是很好。
特色黃魚麪早上8點之後才提供，
我老公硬等了半個多小時才搶到一碗。
全程下來的體驗就很普通，沒什麼能記錄的🙄

有個建議，請下次酒店設施改造時新風系統考慮一下，這個改造化錢不用多，可引進一些室外新鮮空氣-免費新風，房間就會更舒適了。

客房洗漱用品衹有牙刷牙膏，浴帽和料理包都沒有。這麼好硬件的酒店，不行就交給專業的酒店管理公司吧，自己管理太勉為其難了。

環境：大堂敞亮整潔，客房及樓層環境也整潔ok.
服務：所有見到的服務員都會主動問好，這點很好，也喝到了晚安銀耳羹。這是管理的魅力。這次江浙滬跑了20多天，14個城市基本都是5星酒店，體驗各異，伯瑞特屬於相對優秀的酒店。

唯一不滿意的是早餐廳的服務生,可能是新來的或者臨時工或者人少，2天的早飯都沒有帶位服務，客人落座後也不會詢問喝茶還是咖啡或者其他，特別不滿意的是收桌很慢，很多桌子吃完沒有及時收拾給後來者的感覺很臟很亂，即使收拾完桌面殘羹剩飯但餐巾紙和餐具沒有及時補充桌面擦的也不乾淨。這點和國際連鎖品牌還是差距很大。希望酒店在這方面要特別注意改善

2.要去明陽古鎮吃晚飯，前台給了建議，不好停車打車比較好。確實是，人特別多。
3.房間裏泡泡浴，提供了浴缸大的塑料袋，可以乾淨衞生的泡澡條件。
4.捲筒紙提供了兩種，無印花薄的和有印花厚的，不同使用習慣都能滿足。
5.房間裏配置都是按照3個人配置的。

每次入住酒店都要收取按金，但是這按金管理水平實在太讓人不放心，如果不是我主動發現了，這錢可能就沒有了。
耽誤了我2個多小時，衹是和我説一句抱歉，説明沒有任何的反思機制，所以即使其他地方再好也衹能是給出0分的評價了。

    這次找酒店，特別電話問了酒店，游泳池開放的，才下了入住2天訂房，泳池也大，並有汗蒸房，化粧房，洗澡等等。我住的房間往窗外看近處有水有橋有別墅羣，不遠處有山，山腳下一條彎道，夜晚車燈閃閃連連更增加美感。特別提高我感覺的是酒店提供的早攴，豐富多樣，服務員熱情，就是忘了拍些照。
   這次出行選對了餘姚，風景多，人文多。酒店有打卡點：陽明書房，陽明學説，知行合一的出處吧！
   選擇了伯瑞特酒店，我還想去。以後帶小孩一起去。

服務非常不錯，因為到了以後安排的房間沒有收拾好，前台人員很智慧的直接升級房型以表歉意。
房間在市區酒店來説算中大的範圍，空間佈局很合理，浴缸放在床邊讓我想起某些度假酒店。
早餐品類也算是齊全，對這個級別的酒店來説雖然沒有特色之處，也沒啥好挑剔的。
價格上的話真心認為非常實惠，重點在於國慶期間的漲價幅度非常良心，這點可圈可點。

一定要説個缺點的話，可能生意太好了，地庫車流規劃不夠合理，雖有工作人員指引但還是堵車。

服務：一般，要＋個枕頭，送來兩個枕頭套，我説上面有灰，服務嘮嘮叨叨的，你套上給我枕頭，拿回去擦擦不就好了

設施：房間大，晾衣繩位置比較合理挺好的。
早餐：非常不錯，要樑弄大糕，當地特色。還有糯米飯、黃魚麪。咖啡不好喝，建議換好一點的咖啡豆，如果考慮成本寧可東西少一點。
建議：雖然電話機之類的貼了，已消毒，有沒有真的消毒其實不知道不太放心，我帶娃出門還是自己濕巾擦一遍的，不如放個消毒濕巾。
整體：不錯，有潛力，比起國內一些酒店品牌已經中上了。
離河姆渡比較遠，開車50分鐘。

msg:酒店總體來説性價比一般，我們入住的是套房，明顯上一個住客可能是結婚的新人，移門上的喜字都沒有清理乾淨，床腳還有幾個小氣球，兩個衞生間都有異味，應該是下水道沒有做好防臭。
優勢是房間確實很大，窗幾乎都是落地，視野開闊，但是因為這個空調感覺有點打不起來，開到最低還不是很涼快。
酒店沒有告知minibar的使用，導致後來我在查閲訂單時發現是房費中包含了minibar的首輪享用，而此時我們已經退房了。晚上送了甜點，早餐品類豐富，還有特色的黃魚麪，很大一條，很不錯。
雖然我們是路過中餘姚隨便住了一晚，但是總體來説還是有點期待的，據説是本市最大的酒店，各方面的服務還是有改善的地方。

房間衞生打掃還可以更好，有發現遺留的頭髮😂

國慶節這個價位入住五星級酒店，性價比超高！已約定下次還要帶家人再去體驗一下。

msg:親子出行，伯瑞特酒店確實不錯！酒店外觀高大氣派，內部裝修也是很有特色，酒店設施很新，應該是三年內的新酒店，酒店位置距離火車站不遠，地理位置好，去陽明古鎮打車10元就到，也方便！酒店的親子房間，很適合家庭出遊，一家4口帶倆娃，睡的一點也不擠！晚上還有夜宵贈送！酒店親子活動也不少！最推薦的就是酒店裡的恆温游泳池，對小朋友很友好！有0.5的淺池，還有深池！水質標準！大堂服務態度周到熱情，門僮做到主動開車門，幫拿行李！酒店大堂的前台蔣玉玲更是工作認真負責，看到我們帶了兩個小朋友，還幫申請了2份早餐🥣！酒店的早餐品種齊全，還有黃魚麪，可惜我們早上到的晚，告知賣光了，期待下次品嚐

房間乾淨寬敞，衹是特有的大酒店中央空調燥熱感，入睡不好不好。
早餐品種不少，味道很貧乏。黃魚麪總感覺魚不新鮮，不敢吃完。
電梯間碰到的老阿姨很有禮貌，好評！

到了房間，孩子歡呼雀躍，帳篷，小床，粉紅拖鞋，漂亮漱口杯，安徒生童話，樂高積木桌，滿足了她的所有喜好！
尤其，第二天孩子略有不適，前台和客房服務員林意善解人意的幫忙和囑託，讓人感到暖心！
來去匆匆，但是早餐還是必須有它的一筆！營業時間長，品種豐富，還有小朋友們的玩樂區，點贊👍
總之，是一次令人欣喜的入住體驗，給原本平平無奇的行程增色不少！

當地應該算是除太平洋以外最高等級的酒店了，當然裝修要比太平洋新很多畢竟才開業沒幾年。服務也不錯了有送歡迎水果盤子，攜程上的價格比較下來也比某豬便宜一點，下次去餘姚還是會選擇他家。
