msg:Room: The room is quite good, clean and tidy without any odor. Our room is very far from the hotel lobby (hot spring pool). I don't know if the more expensive the room, the closer it is.
Environment: There is nothing special in the resort. You can only stay in the room except for swimming. The outer area is ten miles in radius. You have to drive more than ten kilometers to the city to buy a pack of cigarettes.
Dining: Go to the city to eat. Although it is more than ten kilometers away, the food in the restaurant here is really unpalatable.
Service: I didn't ask for any service. The attitude of the waiter at the front desk was quite good.
Hygiene: There are many beetles in the water, both alive and dead. It feels acceptable to have such a long swimming lane in the mountains, but I guess people with mysophobia don't dare to go into the water.
Suggestions for later comers: 1. The first floor is directly connected to the swimming lane and you can go directly into the water. You have to take a detour on the second floor. It is best to book a room near the lobby. Please consult the customer service for details;
2. Don't look at other additional items when booking a room online. They are all fake. You have everything when you book a room;
3. Don't go to the buffet breakfast. It's unpalatable. Compressed biscuits are better than it.

msg:The hotel environment and service are very good. The nearly 3-kilometer road after passing the hotel sign from the highway is beautifully built. The first impression is very good, but it also means that the surrounding takeaway service is close to zero, so friends who want to order takeaway should be mentally prepared. However, the hotel's restaurant products are OK, and the 24-hour vending machine also sells instant noodles, beer, snacks, drinks, etc. What needs to be praised is that the welcome fruit sent by the hotel is excellent!
The only drawback is that the reception capacity during the May Day holiday is slightly insufficient, and the buffet breakfast meals are almost sold out in seconds. Children's play facilities are also poorly maintained.
The experience should be better during non-holidays.

There are no other facilities around, and takeout is not available. If you bring children, you have to bring your own snacks.

Hygiene: The water in the swimming pool is not clean, it feels a bit dirty,
Environment: It's okay. It was raining heavily when I went there,
Service: It may take a long time to deliver things, and there are not many hangers,
There are not many varieties of breakfast,

However, if you want a quiet environment for your vacation, this is not the place for you. Because the sound insulation effect of the doors and windows of the room is very poor, the sound of adults talking, children playing and water running in the corridor is really noisy from morning to night; the WiFi signal is poor; in addition, the house prices during the Spring Festival are multiples of daily prices, so we I stayed for two nights, but the quality and variety of the breakfast and the 98 yuan buffet dinner were not cost-effective at all. I will not come back.

msg:The location is in a relatively suburban area. It is a real estate-style villa for sale and rental. It is really a first-class place for a quiet vacation! But there are few surrounding facilities.
The Venice Waterway swimming pool is large and long. Unfortunately, the weather is too cold and there is no way to get into the water. I believe it is really good to travel in summer. The hotel's hot springs are too thin, with only three or four pools. Fortunately, there is a private hot spring outside the room to enjoy. The hot spring is a real hot spring, and your skin will be smooth after soaking in it.
The most unexpected thing about the hotel facilities is that the hotel does not have a do not disturb button. The staff woke me up at 9:30 in the morning to run the room. It is really a mistake not to have this button!
It’s okay not to eat breakfast at the hotel

It was an accidental choice on the way, but I will come back again later. Again, because I haven’t experienced the charm of summer swimming lanes, I think summer will be more fun.

I soaked in the public hot spring pool, and soaked again in the hot spring pool in the yard the next day. The hot spring water was quite good.
The surrounding air is very good, the breakfast is rich, and the special noodles are recommended. I ate a bowl of noodles, a bowl of noodle soup, and four eggs.
It is a very suitable place for leisure. You can read a book in the sun and take advantage of the evening breeze to soak in the hot springs. It is a satisfying place to rest.

The weather is a bit cold now, so I only took a bath in the hot spring. According to the hotel's instructions, I filled half of the pool of scalding hot spring water first, and then added more scalding water when it cooled down at night. In this way, I had a pure pool of real hot spring, and my skin was smooth after soaking. Slippery and very comfortable. Unfortunately, there is no swimming lane to play in. I can only covet the clear and translucent swimming lane and wait for the weather to get hot.

Hygiene: The hygiene is very clean, and the pool is also cleaned well. The room is overall tidy. The coffee table in the room had some water stains.

Environment: The environment is good. The view is not bad either. The privacy of the outdoor pool is average. Because the buildings are built facing the swimming lanes. The only thing is that the soundproofing of the room is slightly poor. Because there is only one wall between the outdoor pool and the room, the sounds of playing in the outdoor pool next door and upstairs and in the swimming lane in front of the door can be heard clearly in the room even if the door is closed. It affects rest especially in the morning.
Also, why are there people streaming live in the swimming lane outside the room so early in the morning? Very noisy.

Service: The service may not be able to keep up with the reception of bus tour groups. In addition, the guest room cleaners habitually park the linen cart in front of the downstairs door, which is somewhat unsightly and affects travel.

Hot spring tickets: The hot spring is very small, but fortunately there are not too many people. In addition, in the evening I found that I would put some hot spring water from the previous day and clean the pool, so the hygiene was better maintained.

Because the weather is cooler, it is basically impossible to swim in the swimming lanes. But the scenery is still good, very exciting

設施：酒店有個超長泳道，酒店的人説住一樓的套房可以直接跳下去泳道的，我們住的是二樓的房間，要走樓梯下去再過去泳道。房間有私家温泉池，2池水夠我們泡的了，也還有露天公共温泉♨。
另外逛了酒店一圈，它也有個小童樂園，帶小朋友過來的也可以玩上一天啦！

服務：酒店服務人員好貼心啊，也很有禮貌，很耐心給你指導方向，介紹當地美食😋。

這次旅行體驗感不錯，值得推薦的一家酒店，下次我來要住一樓的那個房間🤟🏻🤠

msg:1.環境：一般，沒啥讓人眼前一亮的風景，有一條大河幾座山在酒店一個角落，很多地方都在建設。
2.服務：嚴重缺人手，不專業，服務跟不上，兩個人入住一間房，衹辦一張房卡，衹送一個蕎麥枕，後面回去前台強烈要求補充房卡、枕頭才給補。
3.餐飲：一般，沒啥吃的，前台告知09:30早餐就結束了，其他酒店一般都是10:00，晚餐等了一個小時才陸續上菜，出品也很少。
4.房間：在二樓，行李全靠人力走台階搬上搬下，面積很小，陽台看不到外面風景，晚上18:00多入住，房間還沒搞出來，BB床連小孩的床墊、床單、被子、枕頭都沒有，衞生間有黑色小飛蟲，有味道，配套的洗浴用品和快捷酒店的差不多。
5.温泉：三個泡池+長的和游泳池一樣的温泉，泡池水很臟，坐下去沒一分鐘就溜了，游泳池衞生相比較稍微好一丟丟，但是在游泳池泡温泉，完全不出汗，有點泡了個寂寞，温泉旁邊的淋浴房沒有熱水，泡完全身癢，沒地方洗澡，衹能濕答答走回房間再洗。
6.優點：室外游泳的地方比較大，威尼斯風格，有些房間可以直通泳池，夏天游泳應該會比較舒服。

總之踩雷。
