One wish is left open, namely that the construction in the park finds an end, so one can enjoy an undisturbed walk around  the garden, without being stopped by green fences, blocking the way because of construction area (that never seemed to change much over the last two years anyway....)

msg:Went with 6 kids between 5 and 12, and they loved it, the outside pool and beach area playground and the Indoor Playground. All the other things they offered we did not try, pool and Indoor Playground was enough. 
I personally thought for that price, the outside pool sunchairs and chairs could be more and cleaner and not old and therefore broken. The cleanliness overall of the Hotel was ok. The service was overall good and fast, but not really friendly, neither unfriendly. The Indoor Playground for 50 yuan was worth the money, the kids could spend hours in there, whereas I thought it was small and boring! 
Overall, I would book again for a few days with the kids! 
I would avoid the weekend though, toooooo many people!

The location is perfect and it's easy to move around. The shopping mall is not far. If you don't have a car you can easily use a Didi and it'll take you wherever you wish to go.
The room was spacious and very clean.

The only downside is that we didn't have a lot of food options during breakfast, as we're vegans. Most food items had meat, sea food or eggs. 

Hopefully I'll find more food options without meat, seafood or eggs, as I'll be coming back in the near future.

It is completely possible for parents to take care of their children easily. I highly recommend it.

Service: More satisfying than the facilities is the service. My customer service manager Bob communicated with the number of children one day in advance and took the initiative to upgrade the room type. Because I brought two children, I also took the initiative to arrange breakfast for 4 people. In the evening, a robot was used to send a small doll to each of the two children, and the children were very happy. Before leaving the hotel, the check-out time was postponed.

First of all, I would like to thank the butler Bob for his thoughtful service. A good hotel cannot be separated from an exclusive butler, especially this kind of parent-child hotel with a large area and many types of services.

Facilities: The facilities are great, five-star standard, the hot water is large, the room is reasonably arranged, Bob helped upgrade the lake view king room with a terrace, a large area, and new facilities. The gym, children's playground, swimming pool, etc. are all very complete, it should be more fun in summer!

Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, there is a bathtub, the bathtub is also cleaned very clean, and the dry and wet are separated.

Environment: Located in Sheshan Resort, the surrounding area is not far from various attractions. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and water, and the environment is great!

Service: The service staff will take the initiative to say hello, and all services are good!

msg:More suitable for young children.
The hotel is big, but it is big in the number of guest rooms, not in the rich facilities.
For example, the West Wing room we booked is really far away from the main building and facilities. It takes a long time to eat, play with sand, and play in the water.
The paddling pool is divided into indoor and outdoor. The outdoor pool looks more fun and has a slide, but the temperature in May is not warm enough to use it. The indoor pool has a small pool of 50cm and a large pool of 100cm/160cm, but most of the kids are in the small pool. It seems a bit insufficient.
There are only two restaurants, the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant. The afternoon tea next to the lobby doesn't look good, and sandwiches cost 50 yuan.

msg:The hotel is located in Sheshan, with beautiful scenery nearby and many attractions to visit. It is very close to Happy Valley, which is loved by children. We booked a king-size bed room and a twin-bed room for a May Day trip with the elderly and children. The rooms are large, clean, tidy and well-lit. I am very satisfied with the parent-child hotel I have stayed in. I like the bed in the room because it is very large. There is also a chaise longue that can be used as a baby bed. It is extremely friendly to families with two children. The hotel has complete facilities. The bed fence and extra bed service I requested were delivered quickly. The hotel's buffet breakfast is rich and complete, and both children and the elderly like it. There is a children's playground in the hotel. Our two children can play for a whole morning, and they also clamor to play after dinner. The beach pool in the hotel was not used because of the rain. This stay is for three days and two nights. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will consider coming to this hotel to spend a happy vacation in summer!

The only drawback is that the room is not soundproof. I don't know why there was a sound of speakers playing music outside in the early morning of the two days I stayed. The music was so loud at 2 a.m. on the first day that it woke me up üòì It is recommended to put earplugs in the room as a backup

The room includes tickets to Yuehu Lake, but they didn't give it to me when I checked in, but they kept selling me a buffet dinner. Later I went downstairs to get it, but when I asked if there was parking at Yuehu Park, I was told I didn't know. There is still a big gap in soft power compared to international five-star hotels.

I have been out for a few days. To be honest, I am a little tired of taking care of the kids. . This hotel allows you to put the kids in the playground and rest by yourself [cover your face][cover your face]
I really like this environment and service! ! It is really safe to bring your kids here! The playground is a cute pet park, and there is also a swimming pool in summer! !

Reasonable price, value for money enjoyment The price of this buffet restaurant is very reasonable and value for money. Although the price is slightly higher than that of ordinary restaurants, considering the comprehensive quality of the food variety, taste, environment and service here, it is completely worth the money. The journey does not exceed 1.5 hours. The baby is only 20 months old. The safety seat can be kept honest for half an hour at most, and then it will be naughty, which is not suitable for long distances. 2. The hotel is clean and hygienic, and the hotels under the hotel group are more secure. Catering can be taken out.

The hotel service staff Bob and Betty were very polite and greeted the guests when they saw them. After all, it is owned by Marriott. As my baby grows older, he likes to play more and more. I have taken him to some parent-child hotels. But in front of Sheshan Maoyu Tribute Portfolio Hotel, they are all just so-so. There are really many recreational projects here. Bring your children to play for a weekend. We booked a luxury king-size bed room facing the mountain. I like the super large balcony very much. Sitting on the balcony, in front of you is the green mountain forest of Sheshan. The air is fresh. Check-in and get free tickets for multiple parent-child entertainment facilities. My baby and I are also a †Ü§. Play enough. The Starry Sky Experience Hall uses balls to give children a vivid enlightenment lesson on the starry sky and universe. The scene is spectacular. Not to mention the baby, even I am fascinated by it. The cute pet ranch is a parent-child ranch where mothers can feed small animals. Our baby had a lot of fun here. The calf, pony, alpaca, emu, etc. can be gently stroked when feeding. The animals are also very nice and well-behaved. The basket of carrots given upon entry must be fed directly.

From the golden restaurant, the refreshing aroma drifts to every corner. Precious tender meat, just right. I stayed here more than ten years ago when it was still called Sheshan Amy. At that time, the impression was that the room was big enough + the buffet was rich enough. This time, I struggled between Oriental Beauty Valley and Sheshan Maoyu, and still chose Sheshan Maoyu, which has a larger area. Location-The geographical location is good. It takes an hour to drive from the city. Next to it are Yuehu Park, Sheshan Observatory, Happy Valley, etc. There are many entertainment options even if you are not in the hotel. Of course, it is better to come in summer. Room-It is large in area, the bathroom area is also large, and it has a balcony. The window faces Happy Valley, and you can also watch people playing roller coasters. On weekdays, as a parent-child hotel, the occupancy rate is very high. These days, it is fully booked every day. Platinum card welcome fruit sent one banana, one apple, one pear, and one orange.
Dining-The only drawback of this hotel is that there is no executive lounge. As compensation, happy hour is open to platinum cardholders from 5 to 7 pm, but it is different from Marriott's happy hour on weekdays. There are only cold drinks, 2 dishes, one rice, one noodle, a little sandwich, a little fruit, and a little more. In comparison, the breakfast variety is very rich! The food counter

It stretches all the way from the entrance to the innermost part, and even wontons are used as noodles. Parent-child activities are a major feature of the hotel. There are only a handful of hotels in Shanghai that have private beaches. The quality of the sand is still very high, but we went there on a rainy day and it was greatly discounted. The wet sand feels much worse when children dig it up, and there is no feeling of sand flowing in the hands. +Swimming

The pool is contracted to a third party, and non-hotel guests are charged. The beach and swimming pool are free for hotel guests, and non-hotel guests can also play for a fee. Many people living nearby will come. On the other side of the ‚àû District Hotel is the Happy Farm. Non-staying guests have to pay an entrance fee of 30. There are quite a lot of animals, including sheep, rabbits, piglets, ducks, and peacocks. You can feed them and take the pigs and sheep for a walk. There is a children's playground [Squirrel Kingdom] indoors. It costs 50 yuan/day for guests of the hotel, and 80 yuan for non-staying guests. It is subcontracted to a third party, and there is unlimited entry and exit. The area with ocean balls and white sand is very large. There is also an amusement room indoors. The tokens are quite expensive, 50 yuan for 15 tokens, 2 tokens for a basketball machine, and several claw machines. The Guo Hotel has a Chinese restaurant, a Western restaurant, and a lobby bar. The Western restaurant has a buffet for breakfast and dinner. The dinner is mainly a Southeast Asian style buffet. It costs 278 per person on site. There are many food choices, especially the teppanyaki, which is freshly made. There is a children's menu for a la carte at noon. The Chinese restaurant mainly serves Huaiyang cuisine, and there are not many dishes to choose from. By the way, you have to eat well.

msg:I have wanted to come to this hotel for a long time, but I have never been able to find the time. I also looked at many hotels in Sheshan online, and after much selection, I chose this one. Sheshan Maoyu Hotel is a good family hotel with not too many people. Maybe it‚Äôs because we just celebrated the Spring Festival. We went to the wrong place at the wrong time. It turns out that we made the right choice. The hotel is not a high-rise building and is in the shape of a corridor. I like the light fragrance in the lobby. It is not as strong and pungent as other hotels. No, the hotel is located at the foot of Sheshan (the only mountain in Shanghai). Next to it are Happy Valley and Maya Water Park. You can come here to play in Maya Water Park in summer. You can drive to Yuehu Park (Rabbit Lake Park) in five or six minutes after checking in at this hotel. Wowo play facilities). We took advantage of the holidays to come to the hotel with our children. The service from Bob and Betty was very good. The butler Bob took us to the room and introduced the room facilities and hotel facilities in detail. (It is not a five-star hotel. The services and facilities are very good) The hotel has a swimming pool, a squirrel playground for children, a beach, a cute pet ranch (where you can experience animals up close and feed them food), stargazing to introduce children to constellations, and more. To look up at the stars, you need to make an appoin**ent in advance. We made an appoin**ent at four o'clock. The children learned a lot about the starry sky. The stars were directly projected onto the screen, as if they were in the starry sky. This was more shocking than what the children saw in books. many. There is a petting gang in the hotel (where you can interact with kittens and puppies). If your child likes kittens and puppies, you can bring him here to play. The beach is always the favorite of children. We also brought sand digging tools, but unfortunately it was raining‚òîÔ∏è so we didn‚Äôt go. I will check out the almanac next time I go out. Fortunately, there is Squirrel Kingdom, which is a playground for childrenüé†. Children can play to their heart's content, and adults can also relax and check their phones... Our room is a lake view room with a view of Yuehu Park and the beach. It is a good place to play with children on weekends. Seeing that there is an outdoor swimming pool outside, I will definitely come again in the summer.

msg:A good choice for family trips in Shanghai
The former Le Meridien is a five-star hotel with complete facilities. The rooms all have balconies, which is very friendly to those who like ventilation.
The family has the Squirrel Kingdom amusement facilities and the small beach downstairs, which is very good.
The sanitation is also clean.
The mattress is soft, which is very comfortable for those who like soft mattresses.
In April, the green trees are sprouting, the outdoor air is excellent, and the indoor fragrance is also good.
The breakfast is neither good nor bad, basically everything, and it is relatively delicious compared to the wontons.
Service: Guests booked by Ctrip are received by the exclusive butler Bob, who sends tips in advance, reserves the room in advance, and gives the children a surprise gift from the robot. The children's check-in ceremony is very good. Although there was a traffic jam on Friday after get off work, the great service made the overall experience much better.
Not leaving Shanghai for family, hiking, amusement parks, and golf nearby.
Satisfy the choice of the whole family, will come again~

msg:I bought a package and booked a deluxe king room for two nights. I arrived in the afternoon on the first day. The hotel said that the room type was oversold and I upgraded to a so-called camping room that was not found on Ctrip. The room was replaced by a tent. There are more camping products, but when I checked in, I was told that the room was fully booked for the second night and I had to change to a deluxe king room. When I went to the front desk to inquire the next day (it was a different person), I was told that if I continued to stay, I would be charged a 350 fee difference, and a room was available! Either use your precious travel time to pack your luggage and change rooms, or the price, this is one of the tricks! I got up early to pack my luggage and moved into the so-called double bed room. When I finished washing and went to bed at night, I found that it was two single beds pushed together. One side was far away from the fixed bedside table and could not be reached at all! There is a gap in the middle of the bed, making it uncomfortable for the baby to sleep in! The key is that when I checked in, I mentioned that I had a baby and was given a room at the end of the corridor. What a shabby hotel service and routine, I will never go there again! The hotel manager didn't have a reasonable solution. If he said he wanted to complain, just cooperate with the complaint. OK, you wait.

Every dish can make people feel the unique Western style. The service is also very attentive, and the waiters are warm and friendly, making people feel cordial. Western Restaurant The environment of this Western restaurant is really good, the atmosphere is warm and romantic, the music is soft and comfortable, and the service is considerate and considerate.

Exquisite and delicious, especially the steak and pasta, with excellent taste and endless aftertaste. I will recommend it to my friends!
. Dining in this western restaurant is a pleasure, from the environment to the dishes to the service, everything is impeccable. Every dish is carefully prepared with fresh and delicious ingredients, especially the seafood platter and grilled chicken wings, which are delicious. The service here is also very attentive and makes people feel friendly. Their coffee is good, it tastes very pure and fragrant
Paired with the pure milky aroma, it soothes my taste buds during my busy work. I really like this wonderful taste. Mellow and delicious. It‚Äôs really affordable and delicious, and great value for money. From now on, the repurchase will be yours. Suitable for all tastes, American coffee has a rich and varied taste that makes people intoxicated. Its bitterness, sourness and sweetness are intertwined, presenting a balanced taste. Paired with a piece of delicious croissant, it can bring out the mellow aroma of coffee, allowing people to enjoy a pleasant and good time. Talking about other things, Sheshan Maoyu Hotel, which is known as the ceiling of Shanghai‚Äôs family hotels, costs 1,399 per night for a regular king-bed room including breakfast for two large and one small children (the price difference for one child over 1.2 meters will be 99 yuan). Huihui Parking Entrance: We arrived at noon, and the underground parking spaces were not tight yet. Most of the people who had checked out had almost left, and the people who checked in were still arriving one after another. Parking is also available near the main entrance of the above-ground lobby. It was already half past twelve when we arrived, so we went directly to the hotel restaurant for lunch. The Squirrel Kingdom Children's Park is a relatively good experience. There are not many people inside, and the older babies may have gone swimming. Our little one-month-old baby played in the sand and played on the ocean ball slide, which was quite good. It was so exciting that I ****ed 240 of my tits in one go after playing for almost an hour. However, you should be aware that the sand room in the indoor park contains very small plastic particles. It is possible for a baby to stick it in his mouth, ears, and stuff it into his nostrils, so you still have to keep an eye on it. The outdoor beach is quite clean, and since Maomao was born soon, we didn't play for too long. At one and a half years old, he is still a bit young, and he is not very good at playing yet. By the time he reaches two years old, he will probably be addicted to digging in the sand and be unable to extricate himself. The room is quite big for three people, but there is a bit of a smell when you first enter. I told the hotel that they will install a fence. The hand washing area is divided into three parts. The shower room and bathtub sink are in one room, and the toilet is in one room. After asking about clothes and hats, we brought our own disposable bath bags to bathe our two babies. The hotel housekeepers Bob and Betty provided good service.

msg:I am going to Sheshan this time. It is very convenient to book this hotel. It takes about 5 minutes to drive from Sheshan. You can park for free and it is self-driving friendly. The family came to check in together. It was a bit late when we arrived. The original room types were far apart and it was inconvenient. After learning about the situation, the housekeeper Jerry enthusiastically arranged two adjacent rooms. The view of the lake view room is really amazingüëç You can see the hotel's beachüèñÔ∏èman-made lakeüí¶ and the view is very good. The whole room feels very spacious, and the balcony has a wide view. After looking at the hotel, there is also a large children's playground, swimming pool, and cute pet paradise. It is very suitable for friends from around Shanghai to drive over and walk their children for the weekend. I only stayed for 1 night this time, which was a bit hasty. This hotel feels suitable for staying at least 2 nights. It‚Äôs great to bring the children at home to enjoy the activitiesüëå

They also gave us a late check-out, and also gave us tickets to feed small animals at the family farm of our companions, which was not too considerate.
There are many families coming to stay, so it is highly recommended.

When we checked in at the hotel, Bob personally greeted us and accompanied us. After all, this is a hotel that focuses on families and the environment is very suitable for family travel. Every waiter greeted us with a smile, which felt great! The room is large and well laid out. We also brought our own camping inflatable bed, which is more than spacious. In addition, I would like to praise the service that is responsive to requests, because our two children asked the hotel to twin beds to make a larger bed in advance. Unexpectedly, the children also wanted to sleep on the sofa when they arrived, so they added quilts and latex pillows. Bathrobes, toothpaste, bathtub bags, etc. are all satisfied, thank you very much! The hotel's beach is also very nice. In the evening, I also watched other guests set off fireworks. I wish everyone a happy New Year! All in all, I am very satisfied and will come again next time.

The name is quite nice, and Bob's service is great. Checking out is also more convenient. You can just hand over your room card and leave. Parking is also free. I will consider it next time.

From the moment you park your car, the staff will proactively greet you, place your luggage, and send it directly to your room. When checking in, they will proactively introduce the hotel's facilities and parent-child programs in detail.

The butler Bob‚Äôs service was very professional, handsome and elegant. He understood our needs in advance and upgraded the room before we arrived. Fenced in and also allows free late check out!

The hotel is very large and parking is very convenient. You can park directly in the underground parking garage under the lobby or on the ground outside the lobby. 4. There are all kinds of food and entertainment nearby. You can eat at the hotel, or go to Impression City, Kaiyuan Mediterranean, and University City (the store is closed now during the winter vacation); for entertainment, you can find Happy Valley, Yuehu Park, Sheshan, and Guangfulin , Chenshan Botanical Garden, etc., you can stay a few more nights and visit in depth!

I chose this cost-effective family hotel that happened to have a pre-sale package, which was very cost-effective. In order to avoid the rush hour, I chose to travel on Sunday. We stayed here for three days. The butler Jerry's service was very good and he responded to our requests. He also upgraded us to a lake view room. The view was amazing. We could see the Catholic Church, Sheshan Mountain, and Maya Water Park. The aunties at the hotel were also very enthusiastic. I didn't expect to stay here. I didn‚Äôt have to leave the hotel for three days, so staying in the hotel was enough to play. The children also played with cats and dogs for the first time. Although they cried while being chased by the dogs, it wasn‚Äôt too cold to swim for two days in a row. This was the case in other places before. It was so cold to swim in the five-star hotel that I was scared to tears. The children loved it. The great thing about the hotel is that you can pack breakfast. Because the children slept late and couldn't get up, they packed everything for us for three days in a row. They grow delicious food, and the children eat well every day. It is also very convenient to order takeout. This is really one of the best family hotels in Shanghai. It should be more fun in summer. There is a mosquito in the room but the child was bitten. A few bags, I will bring mosquito repellent spray next time I come here

If you are not driving by yourself, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to Happy Valley and over 30 minutes to Sheshan. It is also very convenient to ask the hotel VIP service station to call a taxi on your behalf. The hotel facilities are okay. It would be better if the toilet is updated and the sound insulation effect of the door is better. We stayed for two nights. On the first night, the guests who lived across the corridor came in and out frequently at night. The sound of the door closing was very noisy, making it difficult to sleep. On the second night, there was no one in the room opposite, so it was quiet and I had a good sleep. There is a beach and green space behind the hotel, which is good for a walk.

Butler Bob will send you a WeChat message in advance to ask what time you will check in. Do you need to add a playpen for your baby? On the same day, we were specially upgraded to a lake view room close to the elevator, which was very thoughtful and considerate.
If you have any questions during your stay, you can contact him via WeChat and he will follow up in time. When you take a bath at night, he will send you a disposable bathtub cover and drinks.
The room is spacious and has a balcony, which is suitable for traveling with babies. In the afternoon, you can go to the Squirrel Kingdom, Cute Pet Paradise, and heated swimming pool.
Outdoors, you can dig in the sand, swim in the lake, and slide on the slide. It is very comfortable to go for a walk when the weather is nice.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Bob for taking care of us and allowing our three families to have a pleasant vacation.

Conveniently, the bathroom door has a unique design. The curved door that can be opened on both sides has many benefits. The door is easy to pull and the bathtub and shower are clean and sparkling. The cloakroom is great, you can stand in it, and it also has a ceiling light in the cloakroom. At night, the baby will not be disturbed even if he secretly hides in there and checks his cell phone while he is sleeping, hahaha. The bed was so big that I couldn't touch the baby at one time.

msg:When it first opened in 2006, it was still called Emmy. 17 years have passed, and this time there are too many things worth complaining about. Maybe expectations were too high. After booking the room the first night, I found out on Ctrip that there was noise from renovations and construction at the hotel. As a result, I called the hotel at 11:08 pm to confirm the situation and kept calling until 11:30. No one answered the call at the switchboard, and all calls were left to leave messages. Finally, I contacted the Ctrip platform. Even the Ctrip platform had no way to contact the hotel.
The next day we took the car to the hotel door. The staff at the concierge desk outside the lobby have been playing with their mobile phones without even raising their heads to look at you. The security guard at the door put his hands behind his back and watched me struggling to move the suitcase down. No one cares about you either. I dragged my 28-inch suitcase to the lobby. At the concierge, a foreman in a suit and two bellboys were talking and laughing while looking at the computer. Laughing and chatting. Four people work in a class. No one took the luggage.
Walk up to the front desk. Maybe it was a little girl intern, and there were no extra greetings, not even a greeting of welcome to xx hotel. Until I took the initiative to say hello to her. Arrange the room according to my reservation. There is no introduction to the room. I saw that the 2nd floor was arranged for me. Then I asked to move to the third floor. The little girl said there was no room, so I said I could wait. After that, she immediately moved me to the third floor. I don't quite understand what this reply means.
Maybe it's because of the garbage classification in the room, but the trash can and garbage bag look particularly low. The room has not been renovated for more than ten years. There may be some repairs, but overall it is well maintained, but the signs of time are also visible. Especially the shower room. There is moss on the shower head. The whole hotel feels that the staff training in the housekeeping depar**ent is the best. I stayed in the hotel for a day and met the lady from the housekeeping depar**ent twice. They will take the initiative to greet you with a smile on their faces. They may get the lowest wages, but they really work here sincerely. Instead, I met someone in a suit or the concierge at the front desk at the hotel. He will never take the initiative to greet you, and will pretend not to notice you when he sees you. I don't even have a smile when I pass by you. This is obviously a training problem. How could Marriott be like this?
Wandering around the hotel the next morning. I encountered engineering maintenance personnel from outside, dragging a car and setting up a ladder, and they were not wearing work clothes. Not even a name badge. The voices could be heard in the corridor.
Went to the fitness center for a bit. It took about an hour from entering to leaving. The little girl at the reception desk has been chatting with the older sister for more than an hour. When I go in, I just confirm with you whether you are a guest, and I don‚Äôt take you to visit or introduce you. I was still chatting with my eldest sister until I left.
On the morning of check-out, I walked around the hotel again. The bellman and doorman rolled up their sleeves and put their hands behind their backs. They won't greet you when they see you in the lobby or even when you leave. Either playing on the phone or chatting. I even sang "Miss You Night" to my colleagues at the concierge desk.
I went to a Chinese restaurant at noon and wanted to book a private room for the night. The girl who greeted me looked like an intern and didn't know anything when I asked. Later, she introduced a middle-aged male manager in a suit without introducing much. After looking at a private room, he said something to me angrily when he was leaving. "Private rooms must be booked in advance. You can't come directly. Let me tell you!" Why do hotel managers of a brand like Marriott have such a communication level? well!
When I was leaving, I saw an old doorman in a tuxedo chatting with the security guard and saying that the hotel car was also sold. There are only buses and coasters and so on. Completely ignoring me who was holding my luggage, the bellman at the door continued to play with his phone, his eyes dull.
Spent a day in the hotel. Came back specifically to take a look this time. The biggest feeling is that there are so many people, either chatting or playing with their mobile phones. No one really wants to work here. Except for the colleagues in the housekeeping depar**ent, I feel more friendly.
I miss Le M√©ridien Shanghai Shimao Sheshan in 2006!

I found that there are business meetings and romantic weddings held here, and the landscape is also very well done! There is also a butler Bob who contacted us in advance and took the initiative to provide considerate and barrier-free check-in throughout the entire process! The hotel room is very large, and children's bathrobes, slippers, small toothbrushes, bed surrounds, and disposable bath bags are all provided. The whole hotel facilities have a strong family a**osphere. The beach is the favorite place for children. You can also drive, play volleyball, jump on the trampoline, and go down slides. It‚Äôs so rich! Going to the artificial lake, there is also a bridge over the water. In the past, there were swings, seesaws, etc., as well as a hillside and a dome theater, as well as a cute pet paradise with a lot of animals! There are still many projects that I didn‚Äôt have time to play at all, such as an indoor heated swimming pool, basketball machine, claw machine, carousel, space sand, etc.! There is also an indoor playground, so you really don‚Äôt have to go out at all for two whole nights! It's very close to Sculpture Moon Lake Park, Maya Water World, Sheshan Mountain, Chenshan Botanical Garden, and Guangfulin. It's so convenient! The evening buffet cost 398 for two people, which is a great deal, and the breakfast is also very rich. All in all, I am satisfied and highly recommended!

The housekeeper Bob was very considerate, led us to check in, and promptly sent information about the hotel's parent-child programs. The children were also given a small squirrel doll, which they loved very much. During your stay, you will proactively ask if you need help and what your needs are, making you feel at home.
It‚Äôs a very large hotel, and the children had a lot of fun playing there. Hahaha, the beach is cleaner and safer than digging in the sand in ordinary parks. It‚Äôs more reassuring. Before checking out, the children even pointed to the big glass and said they wanted to dig in the sand.
The bed in the room is large, with an independent balcony and bathtub. The breakfast is also good. Except for cold meats such as smoked salmon and cold cuts of beef, there is everything else, including ravioli, noodles, egg rolls, and various small cakes. Whole grain bread.
Cute Pet Ranch and Squirrel Kingdom are places where children can unleash their energy. Unfortunately, the time was too short and there was no time to pet the cat or dog. Check back again during the winter vacation!

I went swimming on the first day. Outdoor swimming has been closed since October 7. The indoor swimming pool is 1 meter deep, which is very suitable for children. Children said that the Squirrel Kingdom is a bit childish and may be more suitable for babies; the next day in the Cute Pet Paradise, it was good to take the children to feed the small animals. We went there in the morning and the animals were very energetic and fed them very enthusiastically; the lawn next door to the Cute Pets There is an activity to look up at the stars at the top, one large and one small 198, it lasts about an hour, and the explanation is quite good. In the afternoon, I went to Pet Playground, which is where cats and dogs work. The dogs are tied to low stakes outside. They are all cute puppies. You can buy ham sausages to feed them. The cats are cute, but there are some It was obviously not in good condition, the smell was quite strong, the room was very sunny, and I became hot and sweaty after staying there for a while. There was also a gallery of stalls. We bought beautiful marshmallows and the children were very happy.

Room: I live on the second floor of the east wing. I can see the river next to the trees and it's very quiet. You can see the entertainment facilities of Happy Valley in the distance. I like the design of the bathroom very much. It can isolate the noise and wash up without disturbing the sleeping children. There is also a round table in the house. I didn‚Äôt choose hotel meals before, so I ordered takeout from Nanjing Food Stalls. It‚Äôs very convenient to have a table.
The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The reviews for dinner were average, so I didn't choose.

The hotel has a good location. There are Happy Valley, Maya Water Park, Chenshan Botanical Garden, and Guangfulin nearby. It is very convenient to go everywhere. I will choose to stay here next time I go to other places in Songjiang.

Finally, I would like to specially mention the great service provided by the hotel butler Bob in the lobby. He helped us upgrade our room to the east wing so that it would be closer to the amu*****t facilities. If you have any questions, contact us via WeChat and we will immediately help provide you with the services you need. Finally, they took the initiative to ask us if we needed to delay the check-out time. Everything was very considerate and enthusiastic. Thank you very much.

The pasta in the western restaurant is super delicious. There are many things to do in the hotel, most of which are suitable for young children. The natural scenery is great and it's a great place to play with kids. The service provided by the housekeepers Bob and Betty is also very good. The children's playground is quite large. Guests can stay at the hotel for 25 guests at a time. The squirrels in the small pasture are very cute.
There are two swimming pools, both indoor and outdoor. It would be better if the weather is hotter.

It really deserves its name - not only are the rooms with balconies very comfortable, but they also have a beach, a swimming pool, a children's playground, and a cute pet ranch. The kids will never miss it~Butler Bob The service was considerate. We sent various warm reminders via WeChat one day in advance, which allowed us to learn more about the hotel's WiFi, dining, and entertainment facilities. On the day of check-in, Bob was waiting at the front desk in person and helped deliver luggage to the room. He was also positive during the stay. To communicate on WeChat, you must give a big thumbs up~ The hotel breakfast is also very rich, and there are many choices for children~ The only regret is that the weather is getting cooler and the outdoor swimming pool has been closed. It will be added next summer~

He is polite, polite and very approachable. I miss you. As expected, he solved a lot of our troublesome problems. Thank you very much for his service! The hotel facilities are top-notch among family hotels. It has its own lake and beach. You can paddle board, paddle, and play in the sand in the hotel. All the parent-child entertainment facilities I can think of are available. The most surprising thing is the "looking up" I think the "Starry Sky" science and education film on the starry sky is more down-to-earth than the dome film at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, and is more popular and understandable by children. The explanations of the instructors are also very easy to understand, and are very popular with children.

The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools, gym, children's playground, and small animal paradise. It is worth mentioning that it has its own artificial lake and beach. Children can spend half a day just digging in the sand. The star-gazing 3D surround audio-visual project next to the hotel allows adults and children to immerse themselves in the knowledge of constellations and the universe.
The hotel is nearby Maya Water Park, Happy Valley, Sheshan, Yuehu Park, etc. It is not far from Songjiang Wanda, Songjiang Impression City, and Guangfulin. There are so many things to enjoy.
I stayed here for two nights and I still have a lot to say. I will come back if I have the opportunity~

The hotel is generally very suitable for parents and children to walk with their children and for couples to relax. Whether it is the beach, outdoor swimming pool or squirrel kingdom, it can liberate parents and allow children to discharge their energy while also allowing parents to have a good rest.
The location of the hotel is also very good, very close to Sheshan, Happy Valley, Maya, etc.
I will choose Maoyu next time. It would be better to arrange around 2 or 3 days to explore the surrounding areas. I hope they can offer some two- or three-night packages.

There are also many recreational activities at night, so you are not afraid that children will have nothing to play with. The only regret may be that the two restaurants are so-so. The Chinese restaurant is expensive and the dishes are mediocre. Only the roast duck can be eaten. There are many dishes in the cafeteria, but most of them taste mediocre. The crayfish tastes good and is fresh enough. All you can eat beer and drink. It is more cost-effective to buy from Dianping or look for coupons from the foreman manager.

msg:I chose this place to travel with two children during the summer vacation. One-day package + one-day stay, the children will be given a small squirrel doll when they check in~
The geographical location of Sheshan Maoyu is really good. The center of Sheshan scenic spot is also very winding. Be sure to locate it and follow the navigation. It is also very close to various scenic spots, with hand-painted maps.
Although the facilities in the room are a bit outdated, it is still clean and does not affect the use. The wet and dry are separated. The room is very large ~ the bed is also very soft and comfortable.
For breakfast, there are a complete range of products, at a normal level. It is worth mentioning that there are muffins, freshly made, super suitable for babies~
Play facilities The hotel has an artificial beach, an outdoor swimming pool, looking up at the starry sky, a cute pet world, and the squirrel kingdom, some of which require a fee. Our package includes looking up at the starry sky and the squirrel kingdom. The children like it so much that they don‚Äôt want to go home
Although there were many people during the stay, it seemed that the room was full, but the overall service was pretty good. The waiters would greet us warmly when they saw it. Betty and Bob also helped us a lot. The overall feeling is pretty good~ I will come again next time~

msg:Very bad. I waited for a room at 12 o'clock and waited until 14 o'clock. I kept urging him to come. I was informed that there was a baby who wanted to take a nap. I was also given a room facing the Maya Water Park. Maya played music and music all afternoon. The microphone was very loud, and the baby was woken up twice during his nap. The experience of the starry sky was extremely poor. At night, the outdoor temperature was only about 30 degrees, and the air conditioner inside only turned on 28 degrees. There were so many people, the air was bad, and there were mosquitoes. , I was bitten several times. I went to the front desk to report it. The front desk looked at me with a dead fish face and said: This is a third party and there is nothing we can do about it... It‚Äôs really funny. Your hotel is a family hotel and has contracted out everything. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a third party, but how well do you manage the third party? My baby's neck was bitten by some poisonous insect while sleeping at night and it swelled up a lot. It was really scary. I will never go there again. Of the three family hotels in Sheshan, you are the worst. Toiletries were missing from the room. You sent them back for me, but Still missing water and milk...

msg:1. Check in at 21 o'clock in the evening and go to bed at 12:30 in the middle of the night. There are mosquitoes in the room. I think it is a natural disaster.
2. Dial the room service number and find that it is unavailable. I call the front desk number instead. Mosquito incense is delivered around 12:45 and I continue to sleep.
3. At 1 o'clock, the mosquitoes continued to bite, and I found that the liquid electric mosquito coil that was delivered was broken, and the electric mosquito coil was cold after the light was on for half an hour.
4. Call and complain, the "well-trained" manager on duty will
4.1 I was asked if I had opened the doors and windows for a long time during the day. I said that I checked in at 21 o'clock and it was impossible to open the windows in the middle of the night.
4.2 I was asked in turn, "Is there one mosquito in the room or many mosquitoes? If there is only one mosquito, it is just an accident and not a hotel management problem." With my average IQ, I can only answer that I don't know whether the few mosquito bags on my body are one mosquito. There were still quite a few bitten.
4.3 I thought that "electric mosquito coils don't need to generate heat because they are electronic." Until I used my junior high school physics knowledge to prove that electric mosquito coils must generate heat to work.
5. The manager on duty finally admitted the problem and proposed a solution: changing rooms and ensuring that someone would check whether there were mosquitoes in the room. The time at that time was 1:30 in the morning.
6. No apology was given throughout the entire process.

I booked on Ctrip, and there was a Ctrip housekeeper. I called the store one day in advance and asked about the arrival time. Because the rooms were full, we thought we would have to wait, but everything was sorted out, and the crib was ready when we checked in. , the luggage has also arrived, hahaha, very good!

msg:First of all, I would like to praise Ctrip's housekeeper Bob. We checked in immediately with his enthusiastic assistance after we arrived at the store at two o'clock. Those who are not Ctrip can only wait until three o'clock. At the same time, Bob has already informed the location and charges of all hotel facilities at the first time of check-in, and the personal experience is very good. It took only five minutes to check in, and then Bob arranged for the hotel staff to send our luggage all the way to the room and introduce the corresponding facilities again. In short, although the Ctrip butler experience is the first time, it is definitely super five-star. This is also the reason why I always choose Ctrip when booking hotels

Location Traffic:
Blessed with goodness. There are Happy Valley, Mayan Water Park, Observatory, Earthquake Station, the largest Catholic Church in the Far East, and Sheshan National Forest Park within two kilometers of the hotel. In other words, if you want to play crazy, you can go to Maya and Happy Valley, and if you want to increase your knowledge, you can go to the planetarium. The planetarium here is particularly distinctive. The entire history of the Shanghai Observatory and the manuscripts drawn by early astronomers, and various celestial phenomena photographed are displayed in great detail. It is very attentive and worth seeing.


parking:
The underground garage is full during the summer vacation, so you need to find a parking space on the ground. There are plenty of charging stations. Visually estimate at least ten or so.

Room facilities:
King bed room with lake view, you can see the scenery when you open the door. 2 meters big bed, three people sleep without pressure. The pillow is very comfortable, and it belongs to the kind of pillow with a strong sense of sinking that I highly recommend. The three of them built a quilt, which was in stark contrast to summer. The only slight shortcoming is that the air conditioner can't adjust the temperature freely but it's cool enough. As the sun goes down, making a cup of black tea and sitting on the balcony watching the sunset seems to be retired.


breakfast:
Standard five-star hotel breakfast. The overall style is a bit more Chinese; noodles, wonton stew, fried rice, and fried noodles are standard configurations. I like Western style, beans, bacon, sausages, fried eggs, and nearly a dozen kinds of bread, butter and jam. Coffee is standard, black tea is standard, fruit is standard, and Chinese stir-fry is standard. Note that there are few people before 8:30, and there will always be people in good seats after 8:30. The early bird gets the food first.

Room view:
Invincible lake view, needless to say. Make a pot of tea, chat with friends and watch the summer sunset.


swimming pool:
There is a large outdoor swimming pool with an irregular shape and a depth of about 1.6 meters; a children's paddling pool is 0.5 meters deep. The large swimming pool is visually 15x40 meters square. One indoor swimming pool, 10x25 visually. The swimming pool with blue sky and white clouds feels similar to Sanya.


Gym:
Not big, three or four treadmills, a few elliptical machines, and a rowing machine. There are also strength machines with basic configuration, and some equipment is Life Fitness.

Parent-child market:
The place where the old man bleeds, when the children see it, they want this and that. Anyway, it's about having fun. The management here is pretty good at doing business. You can't get around here if you want to go to the beach.

Cost performance:
The price of the 900 lake view room is cost-effective. But those who pay special attention to natural scenery may be slightly disappointed. However, it is highly recommended to bring your baby here to parent-child and go crazy and complete the summer science popularization task. In addition, the beach swimming pool with blue sky and white clouds, except that there is no sea, you can pretend that you are in Sanya.

The hotel room is big and clean, and the view is very nice~
There is a parent-child playground in the hotel, and the children had a great time~
In the evening, I ordered a table of dishes at the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor.

The hotel has a lot of projects, including indoor and outdoor swimming pools on the beach, a squirrel paradise, and a small farm. The daily schedule is full, and the baby is very happy. On the last day, I played the starry sky experience hall, which is also super good. It is really suitable for adults to learn. Astronomical knowledge, the environment is also very good, the room is not hot at all! It was almost 12 o'clock after watching the Starry Sky Pavilion, and the butler Bob also enthusiastically asked us if we needed a late check-out, and he helped us to delay the check-out until the afternoon!
I will go again, this is really the best choice for walking around the baby in summer

msg:In a blink of an eye, my baby is about to enter the senior class today and will enter elementary school next year, so I decided to take my baby out for more trips this year.
Because the baby is severely motion sick, I finally chose the Sheshan Maoyuzhixuan Hotel, which is located very close to the subway station. Another reason for choosing this hotel is that the hotel contains many playgrounds for children, such as the Squirrel Kingdom, Stargazing, and Ranch , indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and beaches where you can dig sand.
The experience was very good this time. The butler Bob asked someone to wait for us at the entrance of the hotel in advance. When we arrived in the lobby, Bob was already waiting in the lobby to help us check in. He also told us what we need to pay attention to, as well as the restaurant and children's playground The location is very considerate. The hotel is very clean, and the service staff are also very enthusiastic. This time, my daughter and we had a very good experience. The baby said: "The bed is very soft and the bathtub is big. I will come again next time."

msg:[Checkin time] May Day family trip, I was given a room immediately after arriving at the hotel on 4/30, and the other room was not checked in until after 15 o'clock. It may be because there are many people on holidays and it is a bit chaotic, but the attitude of the housekeeper is still very good.
[Room equipment] The front desk said that the room was upgraded. I originally booked a superior double room, but said it was upgraded. The room is spacious and the facilities are complete. But I checked the Internet, and the superior king and deluxe king I don't know where the difference is between the beds? Because the balcony of the room we lived in is also close to the hotel. It is not close to the sea at all, and we can‚Äôt see the scenery. The bed in the double bed room is two beds joined together, and it will be very uncomfortable to sleep on the joint. The cloakroom and bathroom in the room are very spacious, very friendly for families traveling with a lot of things
The child is one year old and asked for a crib. The crib cannot be lowered, it is very difficult to use, and it is iron
[Hotel restaurant] The Chinese restaurant cannot order dishes in advance. The per capita price is about 300. The price/performance ratio is not high, but the taste is still very authentic. The breakfast at the hotel is 198 yuan, but it must be 138 yuan one day earlier. We bought it at 198 yuan on the first day in the hotel. The information conveyed by the front desk service staff is very vague and unclear. It may be a newcomer, and the training mechanism is yet to come. improve. The dinner buffet is 380+ per person, with rich dishes and white wine, recommended
There are too many people at breakfast, there is no seat at all when I go late, and the coffee machine is always broken!
[Parent-child package] There are not many animals in the small pasture, so-so. Children like the ocean ball in Squirrel Paradise very much. There are not many people playing in the outdoor swimming pool. Maybe there will be more people when the weather is hot.
[Comprehensive evaluation] It is recommended to take children to play, it is relatively easy. However, the process of ordering a room was a bit confusing. I remember that it was around 1700 a day when I booked, but the fee was charged at 1853 yuan. The negotiation was not clear, and I was given a preview record. Anyway, staying in a hotel for so long, this is the first time I have encountered a premium charge

Service: Ctrip butler Bob contacted me via WeChat one day in advance. He took good care of all aspects. Bob was also very enthusiastic when checking in. He took the initiative to say hello and meet my needs. The staff in each hotel were very warm and thoughtful!


Environment: The environment is really nothing to say. If you want to go on vacation, you must not miss it. The outdoor environment is refreshing. We stayed in a lake view room, which is very beautiful, with a clear view, and every detail is in place.

Facilities: The first choice for parent-child hotels. It takes one hour and 20 minutes to arrive from Suzhou. As soon as my daughter arrives at the hotel, I go to the hotel's private beach to dig sand. Although it is not particularly big, the beach is very soft, and it will not hurt when you step on it, and it is relatively clean. Bring a sand digging tool and a sprinkler gun to play for a long time. The outdoor swimming pool will be open at the end of the month, and there are swings over there, which can be reached from the gym all the way across. The children's paradise is relatively large and hygienic. There were not many people playing that day, so we can enter and exit unlimited times. 50 yuan for one big and one small. The indoor swimming pool is also very large. We went there at night, so there were no people there. The changing room was well-equipped in every way. We changed our clothes and went downstairs, which was very convenient~
Dinner set meal for two (buffet or Chinese set meal): The set meal includes a Chinese meal, on the fifth floor, Huaiyang cuisine, very refreshing, the key staff said, if there is not enough, you can refill it, the first time I heard that you can refill it for free, give You like it, but these quantities are enough for our family of three! Awesome!
I will definitely choose to live here next time I travel to Shanghai!

After breakfast on day 2, I went to the Squirrel Kingdom, the hotel‚Äôs large children‚Äôs playground, and in the afternoon, I went to the Moon Lake Sculpture Park across the river from the hotel. The normal ticket for the park is 100 per person, half-ticket for children over 70cm, and the parking lot üÖø10 yuan per hour . The hotel package we stayed in included 2 tickets, so we made up a child ticket. The park circles around Moon Lake.

The park is relatively large If you can‚Äôt move at any time, you can call the browsing car for 15/person.
Generally speaking, the hotel is very good. Children like robots ü§ñ, so the hotel uses robots to give children a doll. The hotel environment is great, very close to Moon Lake Sculpture Park and Happy Valley. We parked in Yuehu Park for 2 and a half hours, and the parking fee was 25.

He left a very good impression on the hotel. The little squirrel dolls given to the children couldn't put it down.

msg:The children at home said they were going to climb mountains on weekends, so they chose this hotel. It is close to Sheshan, and there are many attractions nearby. Thanks to Bob for his service, he is very thoughtful. Added WeChat, and the questions are answered in almost seconds, thank you. The hotel environment is good, the rooms are also very clean, the small beach, outdoor water park, and indoor small amusement park are simply good places to go for a stroll. In the evening, we also made an appoin**ent to "look up at the starry sky", which is very distinctive. However, there are too few chairs near the beach and outdoor small slides. Parents like us with younger children generally need to sit and sit near the play. This kind of "vacation-style" baby walk, first of all, you have to relax a little bit. It's okay to stand against the big sun belt, but it's too much to "stand" against the sun for 1-2 hours. The overall experience is good, and the neighborhood is not far from Impression City. If you don‚Äôt want to eat in the hotel, it‚Äôs good to order takeaway or go shopping.

msg:The most failed experience, I never give any bad review to any hotel, this is the only time, the hotel is quite big, the environment looks good, but I don‚Äôt know if there are not enough staff inside, it feels very dusty, and even though it is a central air conditioner, it was still a little cold at night when we went, and the warm air could not be adjusted. The most disappointing thing for me is that the baby has a clear nose and coughs. All the activities my friends play have to be charged, and the fee is fine. It is not worth it. There are few things to play and are very old. The experience is really bad. The zoo is actually a cow, a horse, and a few sleeping peacocks.

When I entered the hotel that day, from the welcome, the front desk, the room service, the restaurant, and even the cleaning lady, the staff at the swimming pool were very friendly and enthusiastic.

Returning to parent-child activities, the hotel pool is less crowded and clean. The beach and outdoor swings are suitable for children, including the trails and paths on the lake. Children also like to walk. The outdoor pool should be even better when it opens in summer. Overall, I am quite satisfied! Worth a second brush~

The hotel is still more suitable for parents and children. There is a beach to dig sand, and an indoor amu*****t park. Although it is not big, it is enough for children to play for half a day. There is also a cute pet ranch, which is a bit small, and there are not many animals. It costs 38 yuan per person. There is a stargazing experience hall, which should be for watching dome movies. It is only available at night. I didn‚Äôt go in to watch it. I just went to see it at night. It happened that the curator was there, and I adjusted the telescope to see the bright Venus. The night sky is still good. The indoor swimming pool is also a must, but when we went into the water in the evening, the water was still a little cold. After swimming, we quickly carried the two children back to the room to take a bath, and the little ones were a little shivering.
The package I bought includes a buffet dinner, which is relatively average, and the breakfast is good. The hotel butler Peter was very enthusiastic, introduced the hotel facilities, and gave away tickets to the Squirrel Kingdom. Since the weather was very good for the two days on the weekend, it was still very comfortable in general~ It's a pity that I rushed back because I had something to do at noon. After that, I can stay for a few more days if I have the opportunity, and I can also visit the surrounding attractions.

The package purchased includes breakfast and accommodation, tickets to Squirrel Paradise, take-away afternoon tea, and tickets to Chenshan Botanical Garden. Chenshan didn't go there afterwards, feeling that he could have a lot of fun staying in the hotel. Ctrip's information is a bit lagging, and you can check in at 3 pm. The squirrel paradise is quite large, with slides, ocean balls, trampolines, sand digging, and indoor children's playgrounds. You can enter and exit unlimited times with the bracelet on the day. Swimming and fitness, squirrel paradise, and outdoor beaches are all in one area, which is very convenient. The richness of the breakfast is not as rich as the Kerry City I have been to before, but I think it is enough. The soup noodles and small wontons are very suitable for the Chinese stomach. The breakfast view is just outside the hotel beach, and there are small hills in the distance. The view is good. The afternoon tea is huge, and the takeaway packaging is also very delicate. It can be beautifully arranged. Special thanks to the hotel's Ctrip housekeeper, Bob, who prepared a small gift of a squirrel doll for the child, and it was delivered by a robot. The little girl was very happy.

msg:I have wanted to come to this hotel for a long time, but the price after the spring is prohibitive. I took advantage of the activity 1099 to start a group purchase for a Friday stay. Fortunately, there are not many people and I can book it the next day.
The overall feeling is that the hotel is very big, so big that I once suspected that I went wrong.
Another feeling is that everything costs money. Tickets to Squirrel Kingdom are included, and there is no package that costs +50, but there is a huge Jigao rabbit nest next door to this hotel. The afternoon ticket price of 59 is simply a dimensionality reduction blow. Cute Pet Little Paradise, single person 38, raises carrot-eating horses, sheep, cows, camels, pigs, squirrels, rabbits, peacocks, and a corgi locked in a cage. Except for rabbits, other animals look very dirty And thin, the quality of life can be imagined.
I didn't notice that the package I bought was a package for children under 1.2 meters, so I was stopped when I was eating breakfast and charged a difference of 99 yuan per person. My daughter used the 99 to buy 3 small round pancakes. The breakfast buffet that my husband was looking forward to can be summed up in four words: lackluster.
Only the small wontons and egg tarts are ok, the rest are really nothing good. If it wasn't for the set meal, it would cost 600 to eat this breakfast? I dare not think, just my daughter's 99, the three of us go out to eat, it is much better than here. And 99 here, you can't even buy a glass of freshly squeezed juice.
I originally thought about having a buffet in the hotel at night. I checked the reviews and considered the 600 yuan dish. I can't eat it anywhere. After switching to Ele.me, I have been praising myself for my wit. After all, I only spent 200 yuan, I don't know how much better than the food in the hotel. As witty as I am!
There are 5 coins in the game hall, 19 yuan, yes, more expensive than Tom Bear.
The last picture is the evaluation given by my 6-year-old daughter, simple two words: not good. If it's summer and she can sit on the beach and dig some sand, I guess she can give at least 3 stars. But according to the accommodation standard of 3,000 yuan, I think it would be good to go directly to Sanya to dig. If you have punched the card here, it counts, and you probably won't come again.

Facilities: There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and the outdoor ones are open according to the season. There is a squirrel kingdom for children to play, whether it is big or small. There is a game room and a cute pet paradise. In fact, even walking around the hotel is enough.

Hygiene: Just look at the cockroach in the picture, you can feel it intuitively. Just for this, I can‚Äôt say how clean and tidy your corner is. Spring is here, hurry up and deal with it!

Environment: Located in Sheshan, you can see trees from the balcony, the view is really wide, and it is good to have a look. You can't look down, it's all under construction. But fortunately there is no noise.

Service: Very polite, very good.

I recommend it. The price is not too high now. The hotel is relatively clean, and the hotel facilities that haven't been renovated for a few years are also well protected. I'm very satisfied. During the stay, I also thank the front desk manager Jerry for sending the hotel information on WeChat. The information is very detailed. The front desk staff simply greeted the guests. Come again when you have time.

msg:I came to live in Songjiang again after three years of spring outing. The last time I lived in the deep pit, I couldn‚Äôt go out to play at all, and I couldn‚Äôt get a Didi. The transportation and location of this hotel are much more convenient. There are several buses available from Sheshan Station. If it is convenient, you can directly take a taxi online, because the distance from the gate to the lobby of this hotel is quite far.
The hotel itself is a huge park, let‚Äôs grow it green. After leaving the hotel gate, turn left to Yuehu Park, and turn right to Sheshan. It‚Äôs not far away and you can walk there. However, considering that the park and mountain climbing require physical exertion, you can also take a taxi for 3 minutes to the park entrance/at the foot of Sheshan.
This hotel focuses on family and children, and it has a super-large indoor amu*****t park, but now that school starts, there are few people on weekdays, and no one cares about the amu*****t park. As an adult, I also climbed up to play. There is also a big beach that comes with the hotel. I dug a bit and it is very soft sand, so comfortable! It is smoother and softer than natural sand. Children will definitely like it. I want to play with it. Then there is a cute pet paradise, buy a hotel ticket, go in and visit it, it smells so bad, go in and escape. In addition, there is an outdoor swimming pool, which must be fun when it is open in hot weather.
Speaking of the room, because there are few guests who directly upgrade me to two levels in a row, the room size is really huge, not cramped at all and very comfortable. There is also a balcony where you can go out, and there are facilities for drying clothes outside the balcony, which is down-to-earth. The bathroom has three separate designs, and the huge cloakroom can hang all the clothes out. There are enough sockets, which is really good. There are even two sockets next to the washstand. This is the first time I saw this design. It is so thoughtful, so that I can preheat the curling iron at the same time when I can dry my hair.
Finally, there are a few problems. The breakfast is really so-so and unpalatable, and the cleanliness in the room is completely unsightly. There are a lot of dust in several corners, and there are even two cigarette butts in the crevice and corner of the toilet. First, I saw it when I entered the room the next day, and I didn't say I wanted to see if it was swept away when I came back the next day. The cigarette butts were still in that corner after I came back the next day. I don't know how my aunt cleans it. It doesn't make sense to think that I will leave on the third day and complain. I have never encountered this problem in any hotel, especially in Shanghai where the fines for smoking in indoor places are so severe that the hotel does not have a smoke alarm to allow him to smoke two cigarettes smoothly.

One day in advance, someone will contact you about the room and ask what requirements you have for the room
Early in the morning, Bob told me via WeChat that the room was ready and ready to check in at any time. If you arrive at the hotel and have luggage, you can ask him to help you get the room
On the last day, we also helped to delay check-out, which is very user-friendly for us with our baby
The room is quite big. I ordered a double bed and wanted to put it together myself, which is bigger than a double bed. I asked the hotel for a fence before. When I got to the room, the fence had already been installed, and the two beds had already been put together for us. Well, you don‚Äôt need to do it yourself, great praise!
The room on the third floor is quite close to the hotel lobby after the upgrade. The bathroom is large, with showers and bathtubs. There is also a cloakroom inside. I like this design. Compared with the closets in other hotels, this one is more humane. You can hang a lot of clothes, but it would be perfect if the cloakroom can be separated from the bathroom
We are three big and one small, the room is enough to live, and there are discounts if you go early! For breakfast, the restaurant is quite big, and there are quite a lot of things. The taste is relatively average. There is absolutely no problem if you are full. If you want to pursue delicious food, you may not meet the requirements. Anyway, I think Western-style bread and cakes are better than Chinese-style.
For dinner, if you don‚Äôt want to eat at the hotel, you can go out to eat by yourself. There are quite a lot of choices within 5 kilometers. If you can‚Äôt, takeaway is also very convenient.

msg:First of all, the environment of the hotel is good. There is a large area of grass and lake outside. It is also refreshing to take children for a walk. The parent-child facilities are also very rich, which is enough for our 17-month-old baby: there is a Squirrel Kingdom Children's Paradise indoors, a mini video game hall (suitable for young children with a small carousel and electronic rocking horse) and a 0.5m Deep indoor baby pool; outdoors, there are recreational facilities, beach sandpit, outdoor swimming pool (open in summer) and small ranch (additional charge). But for now, I think the water temperature of the indoor children's pool is still a bit low. I suggest that the hotel can heat it up.
	
The room is very spacious, everyone with a baby knows that no matter how simple you go out, you have to bring a lot of things, and the place is spread out and it is more comfortable to look at. There are also corresponding facilities, such as the bed fence (moving), but there are only two pieces, and children cannot lean on it vigorously (understandable, after all, it is not at home). If you go, you should also be optimistic about your children. The hotel also provides disposable bath bags, which can be used by children who like to take baths.
	
The hotel's services also meet basic needs. For example, if there are vacancies, you can check in in advance. The service staff are kind and courteous and will respond in a timely manner. The staff who installed the bed fence also reminded us that there may be mosquitoes in the room because the hotel has a lot of green lakes. Mosquito coils, in fact, I didn‚Äôt think of this layer until March, thank you for reminding me. The hotel is also equipped with a butler Jerry. After adding WeChat, you can find him if you have any questions, such as driving out halfway. The overall service can be said to be very user-friendly.

The front desk of the hotel was extremely inefficient this time, and only one service window was opened when checking in. Two staff members receive a guest at the same time, and it takes a long time. (Until I checked in later, these two people have not yet completed the check-in procedures for this guest), and they have reached new heights by touching fish.
The old people who lined up behind stood and waited for a long time, and the staff didn't even lift their eyelids. I noticed a staff member in the corner, stepped forward to ask if it was possible to check in, but was rejected, returned and continued to wait.
The line gradually got longer, and after a long time, a male staff member appeared and opened another window. Unexpectedly, the man stretched out his arm, bent his index finger down and hooked a few times, and said to us in a commanding tone: "Come on, come here a few!"
There are not many hotels I stayed in for business trips, and I met all kinds of hotel staff, but this man didn't even have the most basic courtesy.
I immediately asked him to be more polite and asked whether he had undergone systematic training. He pretended not to hear a word, nor did he show any signs of feeling that there was something wrong with him, and he never looked you in the eye, and then left the scene gracefully.
But he was also the first one to stand up and open the service window after he found out that the queue was getting longer, that must be confirmed.
In addition to its unique geographical advantages, this hotel has almost no service to speak of (of course there are also polite staff, such as the aunts in the cleaning depar**ent).
Although I spent money, I never thought of myself as an "uncle". I have always treated the staff in the service industry with a mediocre mentality. I can give 5 stars but never 3 stars, and I will not deliberately find fault.
But service is the foundation of business, and mutual respect between people, understanding from heart to heart is a kind of courtesy.

The butler Bob has a strong sense of active service, welcomes you in advance, and informs the service content and facilities in the hotel in detail. The waiters Erica and Dwight will take the initiative to serve the guests and take the luggage. The balcony, bathroom, and comfort of bedding in the room can also meet my expectations. In addition, breakfast ends at 11:00 on weekends, which is also very user-friendly and very rich. It must be praised. The unique location of the hotel is excellent, and it is also very close to the water park. In summer, I will bring my children and family to stay again. I also hope that the service will be as good as ever!

msg:It was a pleasant family trip. I booked two rooms in a relatively remote place in Sheshan. The butlers bob, jerry, and Quentin are very good and caring! The hotel provides a lot of activities suitable for children, including outdoor sand slides, a cute pet ranch, a children's playground, and a heated swimming pool. Check-in is included in the room rate, and every place can let the baby relax for half a day. Looking forward to continuing to check in next timeüòä

msg:1. The self-service hot pot dinner bought as a set meal, the self-service hot pot for two people worth more than 600 yuan, is very worthless. It is the same grade as the self-service hot pot that is 50 per person outside. There are no photos, the dishes are small, there are few seafood, and the hot pot base is unpalatable.
2. There is no minibar in the room, only a few bottles of water, no beverages or snacks, the refrigerator is empty, and there is no welcome fruit. (According to the guy who sent us to the room, the type of room we booked does not have a minibar. The grade is too low? A room worth more than 2,000 yuan doesn‚Äôt even have a bottle of drink???) As a result, we arrived at the room around 4:00 p.m., and we couldn‚Äôt find snacks when we were hungry. Dinner started at 5:30 p.m. , just a few cold snacks and two glasses of drinks, there is no snack that the baby can eat.
3. The room is quite big, and the bed is quite comfortable. There is a disposable bathtub bag for bathing in the bathtub, so I give it one star. but! ! ! ! ! I took off the gold bracelet and put it next to me when I was in the bath, and then I was busy with other things, so I forgot this bracelet. I forgot to take it away when I checked out, so... lost it! ! The cleaning claimed that he hadn't seen it, and the hotel replied no, and asked to help to see if it fell into the gap, etc., and there was no further comment, okay, the bracelet is worthless, more than 1,000 yuan, whoever found it wished him a happy new year.
4. The Squirrel Paradise is quite big, but the facilities are old. On the trampoline, the steel pipes beside the bed are leaking, which poses a safety hazard.
5. The child sleeps until midnight and feels a little fever. There is no thermometer at the front desk, claiming that the parent-child hotel is still a higher-end parent-child hotel, and there is no corresponding basic medical service for children? ? ?

I went for the score of 4.9, I was cheated, and I will never go again

I noticed that Mao Yuzhen had a beach and a children's playground, so I made a decisive reservation! The housekeeper took the initiative to contact us one day before departure, and he also helped us upgrade the room. The view just happened to be able to see the complete fireworks show. Thanks to Bob and Jerry for their thoughtful arrangements! After arriving at the store, the children received the welcome gift and the doll was very happy, holding it every day~
The most satisfying thing in the hotel: beach, children's playground, heated swimming pool (distinguish between adults and children). Children can play by themselves, adults don't care haha, it's very worry-free. It is recommended that you bring your own swimsuit and other supplies. You can rent a life buoy for ¬•59/hour on site. You can play in the outdoor swimming pool in summer~
The hotel's Chinese restaurant is delicious, and the roast duck is amazing!
There are Chenshan Botanical Garden, Sculpture Park, and a children's amu*****t park nearby. You can visit Sam on the way home hahaha, it's really amazing!

Secondly, the environment of the hotel is very beautiful. It is a place where people can relax their mind and body and mind. I like it very much.
The guest room is also very nice. I really like the big cloakroom. It's very convenient to take a shower and change clothes
The children's playground is also very attractive to children. My baby had a great time playing. There is also an interesting cute pet paradise. Although it is not big, it also raises many small animals, which is very interesting
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast and dinner. The breakfast is not rich, and the taste is relatively average. I didn‚Äôt take pictures of the breakfast. The dinner ingredients are fresh, but the taste is a little unsatisfactory. First, the hot dish shrimp is salty, and then the cold dish, a vegetable is slightly spicy, and children cannot eat it. The hot dishes mapo tofu and fried meat are spicy, and children cannot eat it. , that grass head is too oily to swallow. The best of these dishes is mapo tofu, which tastes just right and goes well with rice.
Originally, there was a self-service option for the package ticket, but in fact there is no choice, only Chinese food, so I hope that Ctrip and the hotel will not fool the guests in this regard

The food for feeding is 30 yuan a piece (carrots and potato vines, you can bring your own if you have conditions). It smelled a bit when I first went in, but I got used to it after a long time.
When it wasn't raining, she took the child to dig the sand she was thinking about. The wind in winter is still quite cold and I played for half an hour. It was too cold, so I had to move indoors. The hotel's squirrel kingdom is surprisingly big, suitable for preschool children, everyone can play. There are also special places to sit and drink fruit, which is pretty good.
I like the buffet in the morning the most. It's rich and delicious. Bob, Dwight, and David in the hotel provide warm service. The two kids mean to stay here next time!

The ticket to the Squirrel Kingdom is given to this person to change the bracelet after entering. You can enjoy it all day long. For play. The children had a great time playing sand digging, and almost didn't want to go in to play in the Squirrel Kingdom. After going to the Squirrel Kingdom, they were reluctant to leave. But they have to close the venue for cleaning at noon, and the children are reluctant to part with it. I didn't go to the one that feeds the small animals. The circle of friends I went with was not very cost-effective. The buffet breakfast was varied and enjoyable. Not far from Songjiang Vientiane City, I took a taxi to have dinner once, and I was in my early 20s one way. It's very comfortable to eat and shop in the past and come back

msg:Conscientious evaluation: I like staying in hotels very much, and I have stayed in a lot of large and small cheap and expensive hotels. I heard from friends that Maoyu Parent-child is doing a good job, so I stocked up when I saw Ctrip‚Äôs 799 event , there is no need to increase the price if you come on non-weekends. The housekeeper will call one day in advance (I didn‚Äôt receive it and I didn‚Äôt call again). When I arrived at the hotel that day, a staff member didn‚Äôt take the initiative to say hello at the door. He saw us and left silently without opening the door to pick up our luggage. Awareness, not enthusiasm! Only one person checks the health code inside, because it is not a weekend, there are not many people, the room has been upgraded, the lake view room is not bad, the sense of space of Mao Yu is still good, there is a bathtub and a cloakroom, and a strawberry cake is given for the baby's birthday. It's still relatively small, but it's enough to eat without wasting it. The front desk took the initiative to send 2 tickets to the Little Squirrel Paradise, one per day. The baby was having a good time, and it basically belonged to the rhythm of booking the room. The butler Jerry had a good attitude and took the initiative to help carry the luggage, and sent it to the room, and even sent a doll for the baby's birthday, and even arranged for a robot to bring things up. The kid is also considered a novelty , A lot of drinks and 8 bottles of mineral water were sent to the room. It‚Äôs good not to be stingy. The outdoor swimming pool is full of dirt. I didn‚Äôt go to the indoor swimming pool. It‚Äôs a pity. The willingness is not high. Parents and children are not as good as Zhejiang Parent-child Paradise. To be honest, Senbo is worth 799, but it is not worth the money. It is good to take a vacation once in a while. The breakfast is open until 10 o'clock, but there is no fresh food. The squeezed juice and coffee are not good. It‚Äôs almost 10 o‚Äôclock and no one will remind you whether you need to add a meal. In addition, I think Mao Yu‚Äôs praise is a bit watery and linked to performance. If the customer really thinks it‚Äôs good, they will naturally give a 5-star praise instead of Let the staff come to ask for good reviews. If you want a good reputation, you can work harder in every detail. In addition, I think there are too few staff members. When I walk around the guest room, I rarely see staff members. The service needs to be improved. Enthusiasm and initiative are very important. come on!

On the same day, when I went to the hotel, Peter waited at the door and took me to check in. The overall hotel environment is on the edge of Sheshan Mountain, with a long view. There are mountains, close to the water, the rooms are spacious and airy. What is surprising is the service. Nowadays, high-end hotels use more emotional services, but very few really serve them with heart. Maoyu has done it again to thank Peter for his service, and thank you again for your family-like service with love and heart! I also express my gratitude to the manager of the concierge depar**ent, Jerry. The whole hotel makes people feel that the first time they are on vacation, they are the first choice for relaxing parents and children.

Facilities: Compared with three years ago, some hardware has been upgraded, and the outdoor swimming pool and paddling pool are well maintained.
Hygiene: The rooms are cleaned very carefully.
Environment: Sheshan, the environment has nothing to say.
Service: Thanks to the housekeeper Bob, as well as Jason and Jerry, and every employee I met (the aunt who cleaned the room greeted us warmly every time), this experience is super!

msg:The parent-child hotels in Shanghai live one by one. Sheshan Mao Yuzheng Hotel is the best choice for weekends. The parent-child facilities in the hotel are enough for a 2-day and 1-night trip without leaving the hotel. Children's area/indoor swimming pool/squirrel kingdom slide ocean ball/happy ranch.
In terms of catering, whether it is dinner buffet or breakfast, in general, there should be something there, but there is nothing to say about the in-store service.
The room depends on the check-in situation on the day, and will try to meet the upgrade service. Since it was early at 1 pm that day, the Squirrel Kingdom admission ticket was presented at CI, which can be played unlimited times on that day, and the experience is particularly good.
The whole hotel has the illusion of being in a cruise ship, especially some decorations. The rooms are very spacious, with floor-to-ceiling windows and large balconies. Although the sound insulation of the corridors is a bit poor, Maoyu's windows are soft and comfortable. After a night's sleep, I feel tired. Nothing.
All in all, a very worthwhile place to walk the baby on weekends.

Maoyu's service has a proper sense of security from the moment you enter the door. The room is cleaned first, and the luggage is stored first. When the Huaiyang standard Chinese restaurant is still unfinished, the room card and luggage have been delivered to hand, and the service of the lobby manager Bob can be described as It is still good, with a strong sense of proportion, and the professionalism of the old staff is fully displayed. The room is spacious, the scenery is seductive, the decoration is new and there is no peculiar smell. In addition to the double bed configuration, there is also a beautiful sofa, which is enough for a family of three to have an independent rest space. The hotel has complete facilities and the surrounding play areas are densely populated. I am dazzled and choose to have a phobia attack. It is not enough to play for three days. The buffet in the hotel exceeds the average standard in Shanghai, making the whole family's weight loss plan willing to soak in soup, and want to support the wall to get in. The good times are in various scenic spots in Songjiang. As a Shanghainese, I feel that it is a loss not to live here before, so the epidemic situation is also good, and people can see the beauty around them. I look forward to visiting the Maoyu Hotel with friends next time! (btw, it would be better if there was no security guard at the entrance to check the QR code, and the shouting was not so like catching a thief, they will be gone after the epidemic, right?)

Environment: The environment is elegant. The swimming pool is also very clean. It is divided into 3 deep swimming pools. In addition, there is an indoor swimming pool. Children like it very much. swim.
Squirrel Paradise: My daughter doesn't want to come out after entering. The scale is still very large. It is very clean. The air conditioner is also on
Summary: Consider playing.

msg:It is worthy of being known as the best parent-child hotel in the Yangtze River Delta. Less than a month later, I clocked in again and booked a children's room. The children's room can choose a variety of themes. The enthusiastic front desk Dwight and Tina originally wanted to give us One Piece, but I know that children must like Cars. Sure enough, love can't do it! [Leisurely] The room has slides, house tents, small wooden horses and beads, and car sheets and pillows! It's the room in the little boy's heart! As a parent-child hotel, the details are really full marks. For example, a child's toilet seat is placed on the toilet, a bed surround is provided, and a small refrigerator is emptied to store children's things (this really understands families with children!) If you look closely, you will find that the corners of the room are all round. , The sharp corners in the hotel lobby are also covered with anti-collision corners. It is definitely a hotel that has raised children. [Goodbye]
  This time, the children's favorite is the beach. Haven't liked it that much before. There used to be small cars, naughty bags and so on here, but now they have been removed, but they are clean and pure.
You can buy sand toys in the hotel, and I bought a shovel for 30 yuan, and I couldn't put it down.
  There is a squirrel kingdom under the hotel. It used to be charged, but now it is free and unlimited. There are ocean balls, slides, trampolines, and everything in it. It is a children's paradise!
  In addition to the beach, there are also large lawns, which are very suitable for children to run! There is also a lawn in front of the church, but it has to pass through a construction site, so I didn't go there this time.
You can feed and walk small animals, and I will go there several times before. I remember there were little white rabbits, goats, little pigs, a few big white geese, and a donkey. I don't know why, but the children recently lost interest in animals and refused to go to the farm, so they didn't go this time.
The pool is also great for kids. Anyway, it really shows that "this hotel is a family-friendly hotel" everywhere
  Remodeled! This breakfast really raised more than a notch! The variety is very rich, and the service David and Kaley are also very enthusiastic. Rarely do children eat breakfast so well! praise! It just ended too early [covers face] It ended at ten o'clock. As soon as we arrive, let us quickly get some more to close the stall [covers face]
  Basically everyone in the hotel is fine. Bob and Peter in the lobby will take the initiative to help guests
  Quentin, the concierge, sees every little kid who sends a pinwheel. I gave one when I arrived, and another when I left. The little walnut liked it very much.

A famous parent-child hotel, I bring my little friends here to check in every year. There are two indoor amusement parks and an outdoor slide to meet the needs of babies. There is an outdoor swimming pool with facilities such as slides, water spray mushroom umbrellas, and there is also a baby-specific swimming pool indoors, which is only 50 cm deep, so that babies can play in the water. Plus a clean beach, you can dig sand and pile it**. I saw many children playing with water and sand.
„ÄêSuitable for couples„Äë
The scenery is beautiful with mountains (Sheshan) and water (Yuehu Lake), and the beach is a feature. I have stepped on the fine and soft sand on countless quiet nights, heard the cicadas chirping in my ears, and looked up at the stars, which is full of mood!
„ÄêSuitable for girlfriends„Äë
It is very photogenic to have a beach, so I also recommend girlfriends to go with you, bring beautiful üëô, ask the hotel to borrow a volleyball, and you can play beach volleyball, take beautiful photos in all directions without dead angles, and enjoy the beauty.
The hotel service is also very good, the room is very design-oriented, the breakfast is rich, Bob and Dwight are thoughtful and enthusiastic, how can one time be enough? I will continue to check in next time.

msg:Service: Bob, the hotel Ctrip commissioner, is very professional. He gave us parking guidance in advance and arranged luggage pickup and drop-off service. At check-in, Allen from the concierge led us through the check-in process, helped us with our luggage, and brought us to the room, without us having to worry about it.


Environment: Not to mention the environment, there are lakes, water, mountains, beaches and vegetation, just like a five-star resort.


Hygiene: Auntie Zhang who cleans the guest room is very kind and courteous. The room is cleaned in a timely and clean manner. What impressed us most is that she even helped us to neatly stack the scattered clothes on the sofa. We were shocked and moved when we swim back to our guest room.

Swimming pool: In hot summer, we only go swimming at sunset, and it is very romantic to watch the moon while swimming. The only suggestion is that there is a small elephant at the bottom of the swimming pool slide, and the moss should be wiped clean. Otherwise, it's a bit reluctant to enter that pool...

msg:The outdoor swimming pool is the best choice for children to play in the water. There are shallow water areas, 1.4-meter areas, and 1.6-meter areas, which are suitable for different needs. You can also rent a variety of inflatable animal-shaped toys to play in the water and shoot the concave shape
The environment is good, there is a beach area where children can dig sand as much as they want, it is hot
Indoor pool is also good
The hotel room is nice and comfortable. It's just that the west wing has to walk a long corridor, and it's a bit tiring to go up and down a few times.
Dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor, the food tastes good, the price is small

The day before the trip, there is a special person to contact by phone, and WeChat is added to facilitate check-in communication. We were greeted by Bob from the concierge. He contacted us at noon that day and informed us that there was a vacant room to go, and he carefully registered the license plate number to arrive at the hotel unimpeded. After contacting us on WeChat, we did the check-in registration and delivered it to the room. The whole process of butler-style service was smooth and silky. During the check-in period, the WeChat contact also responded quickly. On the morning of the check-out day, I took the initiative to ask if I wanted to extend the room. Five-star praise!
The response speed of the room service is also very fast, and all the necessary items are delivered quickly. There is also a robot meal delivery service that children like, and the meal price is also very close to the people. The Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor can enjoy dinner while watching the sunset. The sunset in Shanghai is so beautiful recently
The outdoor swimming pool is divided into two sections, and the water depth is suitable for children of all ages
There is also an indoor children's playground, which can be entered without restriction for one day, and those who are tired of playing indoors can dig sand outdoors. The days of entertaining yourself always go by so quickly! Looking forward to seeing you next time

However, it is still the management team of Marriott. The housekeepers Bob and Dwight will contact me in advance. Now this season is full of customers. Room facilities: the rooms are very large, More than 50 square meters, very clean, with shower and bathtub. The toilet is separated from wet and dry, and there is also a special changing room. The balcony is also huge with chairs and a small table. The bed in the double room is very large, about 2 meters. The 2 beds in the standard room are also 1.2 meters. It is absolutely possible to live in a family. Location and transportation: If you use public transportation, it is estimated that it will take a few minutes to take a taxi at the foot of Sheshan Mountain on Metro Line 9. There is free parking by car.
On the whole, Sheshan Mao Yuzhen is still a very good hotel, suitable for vacation, the service is very good, the staff Erica answers questions in a soft voice, which reflects the professionalism of the international wine management, and there is a chance to stay again.

The facilities and hygiene are worse than expected (a mask that did not belong to us was found in the room later). The outdoor swimming pool is very beautiful. It is said that it is an external contract. At present, it is only available to hotel guests. It would not be very good if non-epidemic outsiders can also use it. The family members of the indoor swimming pool came up after 5 minutes, saying that the water was really dirty... this is really not right! In addition, the food in the restaurant feels sorry for the price, the hygiene condition is terrible, the placemats are mottled and dirty, and the dining experience is not good! Not at all what a five-star hotel should look like.
The quality of the hotel staff is still very good. The front desk and lobby are very enthusiastic, and they will actually help to deal with problems. This is a plus for this hotel. In general, the external environment is very beautiful, the service is OK, but there are hidden dangers in hygiene. Will not choose again in the future.

Maoyu is really suitable for taking children on vacation. There are beaches and swimming pools, soaking in the swimming pool during the day and digging sand in the sun, and the squirrel kingdom can play wildly. It is really the first choice for parent-child travel!
I booked two nights this time. Ctrip's butler Bob added WeChat in advance to arrange check-in. After arriving at the store, the journey went smoothly. Dwight and Bob were super attentive and helped to confirm the temporary luggage storage in the room, because the rooms are full these days and the cleaning is slow. After more than an hour, I even gave the child a small cake, which was really good. During the waiting period, take the children to dig the sand for a while and then pass by.
The room has also been upgraded to a room closer to the restaurant and swimming pool, so satisfied!

The room has a good view [strong] and a small balcony. The light is good, there are mosquito screens on the balcony, the bed is soft, and the lighting is soft. The background music is very nice. The hotel mainly focuses on parent-child travel. There are many places for children to play. There are swimming pools both indoors and outdoors. I prefer outdoor swimming. However, the overall consumption level is quite high, marshmallows and ice cream are both 30 yuan, but you cannot dine in. Next time you can check in again when you can dine in.

The overall environment of the hotel is very good, and the service of Bob and Dwight is also very good! The outdoor swimming pool is open in this weather, and there are still many parent-child projects in the hotel. Crossing the lake is a small animal paradise. You can ride horses, bed rabbits, and feed alpacas. The price is not particularly expensive. In addition, the scale of the indoor playground is not small, plus the heated swimming pool, the small beach digging sand, eating, drinking and playing in the hotel, and taking pictures is quite comfortable. The facilities in the room are also very good. The room is large, with a balcony and a wide field of vision. The room service staff Honey and Era have been cleaning all the time, and they will nod and say hello when they see the guests. In terms of hotel catering, the Chinese restaurant has good scenery and taste, but the price is relatively expensive, but the waiter David is very nice! It's a very pleasant holiday, and I will come to check in if I have the opportunity.

Peter, the waiter in the lobby, is also very polite. Children like to dig sand, but the water is still a little cold in this weather. There are also sandy beaches and slides. The beach is close to the hotel, there are still some debris in the sand, and the side by the water is better. If only there were reclining chairs.
Ordinary room space is quite large, and the crib is also good, suitable for babies under 85 cm. There are freshly cooked porridge and noodles for breakfast and dinner, even babies can eat it.
For the swimming pool, there is a special partition for children to play, and the hotel is also very green. Consider taking your baby to play again in summer.

The room is large and well-planned, with a panoramic balcony, a comfortable queen-size bed, and a chaise longue.

Strategic location and convenient transportation. Starting from the urban area, we will soon see Zhao Alley via Huqingping Highway and Jiasong Highway, and we can reach the hotel in about an hour and a half. If you want to transfer to the subway, I checked it out. You can transfer to Line 9 at Yanggao Gao Road Station and get off at Sheshan Station after 19. You can take a taxi or take Songjiang No. 92 and get off at Dongziyuan Greeting Station, then walk 520 meters to the hotel. By the way, here is a reminder that there are two types of parking garages: ground garages and underground garages. Remember to scan the code for free parking. Rooms and recreational facilities The hotel focuses on parent-child cards, and there are several limited children's themed rooms every day. Before we travel, the hotel specially asked the hotel Amy to inquire about the child's gender and arrange a room. I must like it, it is very caring. Ctrip housekeepers Mr. Lu and Peter will take the initiative to take us to the room. During this period, the lobby manager Dwight helps me deal with various problems. Many hotels are entertainment projects, and the grass is miniature. In addition to these, there are rocking carts. , doll machine, and children's playground. Suitable for children of different ages to play. The hotel also has a large beach, but the weather is cold and unpopular now. It must be a children's paradise in summer. You can dig sand in it to your heart's content. This is indeed a child's paradise. In addition to these, other facilities are complete, it is an ideal place for business, tourism, vacation, and wedding banquets. Dining The hotel has its own lobby bar, western restaurant, Chinese restaurant, and dazzling bar. Of course, there are also many delicious food, farmhouse restaurants and barbecues nearby.

The sentence "Never leave Shanghai if it is not necessary" disrupted various play plans, and returned to Shanghai before the liberation one night, and can only play in Shanghai~
One of the two most grass-growing hotels in Songjiang this year. I stayed at the Guangfulin Hilton Hotel last time. This time I booked the Shanghai Sheshan Maoyu Zhenpin Hotel. I have to say that the location is really excellent. The next door is the month. Lake, Sheshan Resort, Happy Valley, Maya are also nearby, very suitable for visiting Sheshan.

The hotel‚Äôs "escape from the world" is very good, and it is also very comfortable for non-parents like us to travel. Come to the small balcony in the morning to breathe in the fresh air, and the city people can really get a moment of tranquilityüçÉ
The hotel has 5 floors, with its own free underground parking lot. We took a good turn on the G floor. Leisure and entertainment (beach, gym, happy farm, various banquet halls) are on this floor, and the L floor is the lobby and cafeteria, etc. Public area.
The hotel has more than 300 guest rooms and suites, all facilities are in line with Marriott‚Äôs five-star standard üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

What we are most satisfied with is the service. Although we have stayed in many butler-service hotels before, his family really achieves the "unification of words and deeds". The special requirements we put forward in advance are all thoughtfully done and checked- Reconfirmed when in.

The hotel has its own back garden and large beachüèñÔ∏è and a special children‚Äôs pool
In summer, you can go to the beach again
We walked around in the back garden, and the drizzle also had a unique style
In addition, there is a 700-square-meter squirrel kingdom üêøÔ∏è kids can go and play!

It is extremely comfortable from check-in to check-out. It is a good choice to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The first choice for family hotels in Shanghai. There are Sofitel Hotel and Shenkeng Hotel nearby. This hotel is estimated to be very good in hot weather. Many of them are outdoor projects, especially outdoor children‚Äôs paddling pools. We basically live there every year. . Both indoor and outdoor swimming pools have adult pools and children's pools. The beach is the highlight. Everyone is rushing to the beach! The beach is also relatively large, and children like it more. It‚Äôs okay to dig and dig sand, to spread the joy. If you forget to bring tools, it‚Äôs okay. Some hotels sell them. Adults watching children can relieve the pressure. It is estimated that you can play for a day if you change the method. The children‚Äôs playground is also very popular. Need to buy game currency, but it's not expensive. There is a small singing machine, but I didn't play it, I don't know how it is.
„ÄêHotel environment„Äë
The biggest advantage of Sheshan Maoyu Hotel is its large area, more green plants, and evergreen all year round. Even if you don‚Äôt play on the beach or in the water, you can take a stroll on the lawn of the hotel at dusk. The trees are shaded against the sparkling lake. cozy. The room is relatively spacious, with more than 50 square meters, but the decoration style is relatively simple, more elegant, and it will be perfect if it can be improved. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with a lot of dishes, and the restaurant service willie and kaley are good. Despite the epidemic, there are still many residents. The restaurant is very lively during breakfast. Those who have breakfast will miss the peak period at 9 o'clock. Check out is also fast. Peter will come to the room to get my luggage. Butler Bob and Dwight gave a thumbs up for their service. A nice hotel.

msg:Come to Yumao again, this time there are not many people, as always, it is suitable for a relaxing holiday. This time, Dwight received us. He was very enthusiastic. He was promoted to the room. The butler Bob will send us to the room. Thank you.
In terms of environment, the surrounding area is green and lush, and you can see many small animals from time to time outside. It is very comfortable and the room is very clean. This time there is an additional air purifier.
For children, Happy Farm, children‚Äôs playground, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, I feel like staying for a week will not be boring. It would be great if the TV in the room was connected to the Internet.
In terms of diet, I called Dingding to deliver food this time. The children were so happy that they said that Dingding‚Äôs food was delicious.
In terms of services, they are all very good.
Looking forward to coming again next time.

Of course, it‚Äôs also very good in summer. There is also an outdoor swimming pool and small animals to play.
The hotel swimming pool is very large, but the deep water is too deep and the diving is too shallow. I personally feel that the water depth is about 1.5 meters.
Squirrel Kingdom can play for 50 yuan for one day and it is also cheap
The key point is that the minibar can be described as stubbornly.

The price of 1600 a night, check-in has to wait, there is no view outside the window.
The hotel is mainly for parents and children, and the children‚Äôs playground charges an extra 50 a day, and the facilities are particularly basic, not as good as those in the mall.
Provide a mini toothpaste for two large and one small two days (pictured)
Hotel breakfast is average, omelette staff service is super poor. "Please fry me a bitter egg", she pointed to the cold one on the table, and I again said that I wanted to get hot, "Aren't there two on the table!!" Continue to lower her head to play with the phone, and eat the cold bitter egg. There is a fishy smell.
Dinner at the western restaurant, 350 per capita, no one changed the plate when the plate was full.
In the past ten years, I have almost praised it. No matter what I eat or the hotel, I am in a good mood for traveling, but this is really not recommended, the price is very low, and the uncle of the farm is very friendly ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Originally, I only planned to give the hotel a request for room layout with the mood of giving it a try, but I didn't expect to get feedback right away. When we checked in on the same day, Mr. Tang, the hotel lobby manager, specially sent us upstairs. The moment we walked in, I was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel not only upgraded us to a lake-view room, but also gave us red wine and cakes, which made us feel very warm. The outdoor environment of the hotel is also good, with beaches, lakes, large lawns, and farms, quiet and comfortable, and the buffet breakfast is also rich in content. This stay added a romantic touch to my wedding anniversary.
There is also the hotel customer service Ada, who carefully asked us if we have any other needs when we checked in and after joining the company, which made people feel at home.
Thanks again to all the staff of Maoyu! I believe I will come again.

Add money to upgrade to a garden view room when you check in. Picture 1 is the scenery outside the room. The room is well-equipped with mosquito repellent supplies.

Dinner and breakfast are buffets in the restaurant on the first floor, and the overall feeling is average. There were many people on National Day, and the hotel hired temporary workers for emergency response. The service obviously couldn‚Äôt keep up, especially for breakfast. There were so many people. The noodle stalls were too late to make to order. They could only be cooked in a big pot. The toppings were suspected to be leftovers from the previous day. The food is really unbearable, but the old godmother is reliable.
The hotel has a beach swimming pool for children and a squirrel kingdom. If you see many families with children, it should be suitable for children.
There are plenty of parking spaces in the hotel.

I originally booked a room in the West Wing. Considering that the outdoor play area is far away from the West Wing, the receptionist was very considerate to help me upgrade the room and live in the middle section. The day I went was the last day the outdoor swimming pool was open. I quickly took my two kids to play in the water in the afternoon. The indoor swimming pool was not particularly crowded. The indoor swimming pool was basically empty the next morning. The swimming ring was forgotten in the room. The staff thoughtfully lent us one directly next to it, saving the time to get it back to the room. In the afternoon, I went to the squirrel park in the hotel to play and beat. After returning home, the children had a perfect two days. They were so happy and didn‚Äôt want to go home anymore.

msg:Personal check-in experience during November: 1. The surrounding environment is very good, located between Sheshan and Happy Valley, there are many surrounding attractions, and the road at the hotel exit turntable is uneven. 2. There are too many service personnel in the hotel, but there is no tea bar in the waiting hall. 3. The decoration of the hotel bedroom is too simple, and the desk and wooden chair are too simple. The bathroom is okay, and the toiletries can be upgraded. The floor of the bedroom is best to be cleaned. 4. The bed is very comfortable. Both pillows are down. There is too much gas and it is uncomfortable to sleep. You can change to a hard pillow. 5. Chinese restaurant dinner is very delicious, but the price of ordinary dishes is too unreasonable. The buffet is so-so, not cost-effective. The breakfast was good and hearty.

msg:The room was upgraded to a parent-child room. The room was not as big as expected. The children liked the tent very much, but the tent was so dirty. The baby wanted to sleep in it at night, so he cleaned it himself and put on his own bath towels. , Don‚Äôt just decorate, after all, it‚Äôs for children to play, clean is the first thing!

   The hotel's restaurant consumption is not cheap, in addition to the normal high-priced ordering, a 10% service charge and 6% tax are also charged. It is convenient to eat at the hotel, and you can also order your own takeaway, but the surrounding takeaways feel awful. We ordered a few of them and they tasted very thunderous.

   Squirrel Kingdom Playground and Happy Farm are both very small-scale. There are not many other things in the hotel. There is a swimming pool and a beach, which may be more suitable for children to play. It is a bit young for our five or six years old. Of course Children still like the beach and playing in the water. They just spend this price on these two. The price/performance ratio is really low. Compared with other options, there are better.

The air conditioner in the room 2 has a smell when it blows on, and the whole third floor is very smelly. 3Such an expensive price, only two small beds but still very clean, at least better than Beijing Gehua New Century Hotel.

Moreover, the flow of people is still very small, unlike other people who have to queue up, and the environment is better than before Ai. By the way, if you have stayed at Le M√©ridien but haven't, you should pay attention to those who only choose now. Breakfast is now in the Huiju Hall, not the dazzling hall anymore. 3The Chinese restaurant has a good environment and delicious food. 4 The room is wide and can accommodate a lot of things. 5The scenery is particularly good, there is also a balcony, the scenery is beautiful, it is good to watch the moon, it is very beautiful and enjoyable. 6There are children's playground and artificial beach, suitable for bringing children. 7 The lobby bar is very quiet and suitable for business trips. Afternoon tea is also provided. 8The front desk service is very enthusiastic, and it's about to catch up with Pudong Shangri-La. 9 The garden is beautiful with mole crickets, and I can hear their singing during the two days of staying. Finally, the summary: overall is good, it is normal to have one or two loopholes occasionally, and this hotel is still very good.

Staying for 2 nights from Sunday to Monday, the price is too high, I can understand it during the summer vacation weekend.
Arrived at 12:30 noon, the front desk was busy checking out, waiting until 1 o‚Äôclock in the lobby, you can check in, store your luggage, check in with your room card, you need to wait until 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, and the waiter brought bottled water and a map while waiting, telling you that you can Go to those places first, it's more intimate. There is no need to line up at 3 o'clock, you can directly ask the waiter to get the room card.
For the reserved superior twin room, the front desk agreed to give a room facing the lake, but it turned out to be facing the parking lot, so I didn‚Äôt change it. The room is big enough, but the single bed is 1.2 meters, which is slightly smaller and does not provide toothbrushes. After calling the room service request, it was delivered after making 2 calls and waiting for nearly an hour. The sanitary condition of the room is shown in the picture. When I went to bed at night, I found the mask left by the guest in front of the gap between the bed and the bedside table. It can be seen that the cleaning was not meticulous. I don't know if this mask was left by the previous wave of guests.
The hotel has lakes, beaches, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, which are more suitable for parents and children. Children have a good time. It is normal that there are many people during summer vacation.
Breakfast is from 6.30 to 10.30. In the western restaurant, it arrives at 9 o'clock. There are a lot of people. Some areas of the lobby are also used. After entering, I found a lot of staff to help and service, and the leader can clean the tableware. It is very timely.
As a five-star hotel, the room cleaning is very poor, and the service response speed is too slow, which should not be.

msg:The parent-child hotel really deserves its name.
Very friendly to children. First, there is a robot delivering goods, which completely attracts the children's attention. You can send water, toothbrushes, and various things. There is also Xiao Mao in the room, turn on the lights, open and close the curtains, listen to the story...and you can play for a long time. There is a place for digging sand outside, the outdoor swimming pool, the shallowest is 0.3 meters, to 0.5 meters, 0.6 meters, 1.4 meters, 1.6 meters, suitable for all ages. The indoor swimming pool is 1 meter and the deep water is 1.6 meters, which is also safe for children.
Seeing that we had brought the children, the handsome guy at the front desk dared to upgrade the suite for free. The scenery is invincible. Facing Sheshan Mountain and Moon Lake Park, the balcony is very large, which is very nice. In the evening, you can watch the sunset, and I have a lot of fun. After checking out, you can also go swimming.
The only fly in the oin**ent is that the breakfast is not rich enough, but there are too many advantages, and I will come next time!

msg:When the typhoon came, I was terrified and thought that I couldn‚Äôt go back, but I went home smoothly. The overall environment of the hotel is very good. It has a separate beach and outdoor swimming pool. If you go further, you can go to Happy Micro Farm. There are sheep, pigs, white geese, etc. It is very suitable for bringing children. Unfortunately, we Only on the first day I played the outdoor part. The other two days I played in the indoor swimming pool and playground. The hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast and dinner were rich in variety. At dinner time, there was a crayfish Chinese restaurant. The price was slightly more expensive on the fifth floor. Generally, a family of three would order a staple food. The meat and a vegetarian are enough. Marriott members can discount. The room is large but there is still a smell of smoke when entering the room. I open the balcony door and blow it. I will mind the service staff. The staff is quite enthusiastic. The general is very good. I will choose here in the future

msg:The most reserved time for the hotel stay, Mr. Tang, the service staff who checked in first, was very attentive, watching me take my children alone, upgraded the room type, and arranged it on the east side of the hotel (the west side is close to the Maya water park and will always play dance music) I bought children‚Äôs toiletries, tickets for the sculpture park, and the Squirrel Kingdom Paradise bracelet.
I went to the hotel pool in the afternoon. The biggest reason for coming here every year is that the hotel has a complete set of facilities for children, and guests will be given bath towels at the entrance of the pool. The outdoor swimming pool will be equipped with a drink bar, and it is really pleasant to go to the beach to blow the evening breeze after swimming.
Dinner in the evening is in the Chinese restaurant upstairs, and it is really beautiful to enjoy the sunset near the window (sunset is at Sheshan)
The next day I met the cleaning aunt, who asked me enthusiastically and repeatedly if I had enough toiletries, and then I needed to give you more drinking water in the hot weather.
Breakfast was served the next day. Breakfast was very rich, both Chinese and Western, and the children‚Äôs tableware was also very complete. The waiter took the initiative to ask if he needed coffee or tea. After breakfast, I went to the animal park. It is a good choice to take children to learn about animals and plants.
This hotel is really the best choice for parent-child hotels. The play route is Zoo‚ÜíSheshan (Sculpture Park)‚ÜíSwimming‚ÜíBeach‚ÜíDinner to watch the sunset. The itinerary was full for two days of stay. Looking forward to meeting again

If there are too many mosquitoes on the farm, mosquito repellent can be done. The hotel has a small beach and the children start playing when they arrive at the hotel. The sand, the sand is very fine, so it‚Äôs best to bring your own tools. We bought a set of 100 yuan from the hotel. I went to the hotel‚Äôs indoor swimming pool at night and it was a little bit cold after the water. I‚Äôll think about it later. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is quite plentiful, and children between 1.2 and 1.4 are charged half price of 99 yuan. The hotel is generally good for parents and children, but the bath water is too small, the washing is uncomfortable, and the bed is soft!

I saw the outdoor swimming pool, sand digging with the children, and a small pet park. The breakfast is very rich. I have stayed in many very good hotels and I always try the buffet breakfast every time. The breakfast buffet in this hotel is one of the few that I think is rich in variety and tastes good. The waiter will take the initiative to ask if you need black tea or coffee. There are also intimate child seats and dinner plates for children. Thanks to Ctrip and the hotel. Fortunately, I was fortunate to be upgraded to a lake-view room. Usually do not comment, because this stay is very satisfied. A little suggestion, only the toilet has tissues, but not in the room. The minibar is empty, although the takeaway is very convenient. But sometimes it's not convenient when you want to drink something in the middle of the night, haha~ a worthwhile trip!

Secondly, there are also disadvantages, mainly in terms of service. The girl at the front desk may be busy, children **** and cry and need to check in early. The front desk left my phone and I promised to notify me as soon as there is a room available. We have been waiting , The children fell asleep tired, wait until three o'clock, and then ask the front desk, told that there was a room very early, since you promised to call, you should give a reply, we silly wait for a long time, still waiting for the call. In addition, when we go down the mountain, we must inform us to check in the hotel room. We got the room card at 3:30 in the afternoon. We were hungry and hungry to eat. We reported the wrong room number. The female staff in charge of the vehicle said that our room number was wrong and hard. If we want to remember that the room card housing is in the room, we really can‚Äôt remember, she wouldn‚Äôt let us go out, and we couldn‚Äôt show our room card. We were really clumsy and inflexible at all. We were hungry and angry. .
The children‚Äôs paradise is also the Kingdom of Sum. If the child gets tired on the first day, he will go to eat in the room and play in the Kingdom of Sum. Then he will be tired and sleep. On that day, I didn‚Äôt have much to play in the Kingdom. I went there the next day and I was not allowed to enter, saying that it was only available on the day.
Overall, although a five-star hotel this time, the service is very dissatisfied

The waiters are positive and enthusiastic, and very caring. The Happy Farm at the back is very suitable for children. The animals are so cute. It is recommended to wear long pants and some mosquitoes. It is also recommended that the hotel provide more places for the Happy Farm to develop and provide animals with a more free living environment.

Service: responsive, extra bed, add water, add slippers, all very fast. If you meet in the corridor, you will also greet you. I don't feel that my level has dropped due to the crowds.
Facilities: The hotel is very big and big... It feels like a 10-minute walk from the West Hall to the restaurant... But we checked in early and the front desk took the initiative to say that there is only a far away room, so there was nothing to say. The room facilities are clean and not very depreciated. There is also the smart home control "Xiao Mao", which the baby likes very much. You can park.
Baby walking: There is a Squirrel Kingdom Children‚Äôs Park in the ba*****t, and it‚Äôs 50 yuan per day for in-store customers until 8:30 in the evening. In addition, there are outdoor beaches and outdoor swimming pools, as well as the cute pet paradise at the far west. Feeding animals is 30 yuan.
Catering: I spent three days and two nights in the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants. There are too many people for breakfast...The dishes are up to date, but the cups are gone. For the dinner buffet, crayfish are also available this season. The price of 278 is reasonable. Recommend processed fried seafood, not bad. Chinese food is on the 5th floor. It tastes good, and the amount is suitable for four or five people. There may be a wedding banquet on that day and fireworks in the evening, which is a pleasant surprise. There are also many restaurants nearby.

msg:The expectation may be too high, so the stay experience is poor.
1. The design is not reasonable enough: the arrangement of the most corner room, the gym or restaurant, etc., will span the entire day of the hotel, at least ten minutes, which is a bit inconvenient.
2. The room facilities are old and poorly maintained. There was a serious problem with the water in the shower room. It was all hair when I checked in. It was too disgusting (see picture); the toilet was also splashed when flushing; the bathtub was broken and exposed directly, and there was no anti-slip mat in the bathroom, because the bathroom water leaked , Almost fell several times, there is a serious safety hazard. The spare parts are few and poor, basically two people wash it once and they are gone, so I don't bother to ask for it again.
3. The gym said it was a third-party contractor, because the distance to the room was very long and the air conditioning was extremely low. After the exercise, I wanted to borrow a towel and bring it back to the room. I simply refused to say that it was the third room, which had nothing to do with the hotel. Gives a very bad impression.
4. The outside of the room is under construction, so naturally there is no view at all. The balcony is even more horrible. The chairs that have not been maintained for many years are all smudges (see picture).
5. Breakfast is also very general, especially the choice of beverages is very small, most of which are carbonated drinks.
6. There are only two bottles of drinking water in the room. As a resort hotel, at least four bottles should be kept, and the water level is also very poor.
PS: Originally I was going to give one star, but Samsung was all because I pulled things down in the room when I left, and the front desk took the initiative to call and then went back to get it. This is worthy of praiseüëç
