Cleanliness of the hotel was mostly good. The bedding and bathroom were very clean. However, the surfaces in the room were visibly dusty so dust likely circulated the room from the AC and so I got a little sick during my stay. Ended up not using the AC on the second night. 

Overall, I would stay here again due to the location and other positives. I would just ask staff to make sure the room surfaces are not dusty.

I like they allow us to check-in early in the morning and check-out late in the afternoon which was very convenient for my schedule. Also the location is very convenient just in front of the shopping mall. 
This was second time for me to stay here and I will come back again if I have a chance!

The curtains are electric, and the TV can also be projected on the phone (a pleasant surprise), which is very convenient for watching TV series. There are also hotel robots for ordering takeout. The two parrots 🦜 at the door of the hotel are very cute hahaha. The most worth mentioning is the breakfast buffet, which is really delicious. We usually like to sleep in and don’t want to get up early for breakfast, but this breakfast made us get up two days earlier. Fortunately, we just need to come before ten o'clock. White porridge with salted duck eggs and fermented bean curd is so appetizing!

The room is quite cozy and very comfortable to live in.
Breakfast is very rich.
The only thing I have to complain about is the TV remote control, which is very difficult to adjust and is available in all three rooms. The equipment needs to be updated. This is very unfriendly to the elderly.

msg:For this trip, I was 7 months pregnant and booked the Mandarin. I only considered the hotel with the advantage of Lujin. My friend chose this hotel first on December 25th and informed me via text message that the room she had booked for the night faced the road. I didn’t sleep well all night because of the sound of car horns. I recommend it. I adjusted (selected a more expensive room type that day). When checking in, I first raised my needs and hoped that the hotel could help and not arrange the room facing the road as much as possible. However, the arrogant employee who checked in did not make any sound. What I said seemed to be like Didn't hear anything! There was no response, so I thought it should be arranged for me (after all, I am also a special group of people), but a colleague next to me heard a voice: Miss, I checked your number. You have also stayed in our hotel before, and I would like to ask if you can. Can you give us a review? Shall I give you a late check-out tomorrow? --Because my first request was not responded to, I refused at the time. I said there was no need to delay check-out, thank you! (The person who checked me in at that time even glanced at her colleague. I don’t know what she wanted to convey?...)
Entering the room: 1. The smell of cigarette smoke was very strong. I should have been given a smoking room. 2. There were chestnut shells from previous residents on the carpet. 3. In the end, it was still facing the road and the horn was very noisy.

Thinking: When the customer checked in, you did not meet my needs and did not have any reception service experience. Will I let the customer evaluate it when I visit the store next time? What operation and logic is this?
Shouldn't evaluation be about improving the hotel's services and meeting customer needs? Instead, does it become an evaluation done to complete the task? Ultimately what do you want to embody? Is the traffic click rate and ranking high?

The check-in experience this time was so bad. The service at the nearby Kaison K Hotel in Yiwu is better. I would rather take a taxi to that hotel!

Breakfast is an extra gift. Since we booked only two standard rooms, we asked the front desk to give us an extra breakfast because we had a friend who came to talk about something. The breakfast was unexpectedly rich, really Very heartwarming. The hotel environment is very good, the room is neat and hygienic, the style is grand, and the bathroom has a lot of space. The transportation is very convenient, you can go to Intime Depar**ent Store just downstairs, whether you are on a business trip or a family trip, it is a very good choice. The service is definitely comparable to that of a five-star hotel. This price➕breakfast for 3 people➕high-quality service, 99 points are given, and the other 1 point is an encouragement point, which will be added the next time you come.

Very good experience, share here.

When you meet foreign friends in the elevator, you can even chat with them. The bathroom is also clean. The overall feeling is very comfortable. The service staff is naturally different in a five-star hotel. Taking my mother to play here is also a joy for everyone!

I immediately received a call from the hotel staff to ask who is staying and what room type I like. After I checked in, I found that the room had a luggage rack in advance and opened it The quality of the air conditioner and the facilities and items used in the guest room are very good. The service attitude of the room aunt is good. When cleaning, I found that the customer had washed the clothes and took the initiative to add a clothes rail, and thoughtfully reminded me to pay attention to sun protection when I went out. It was a very good check-in experience

The decoration of the hotel can be seen to have cost a lot of money, but the sound insulation of the room is very poor, the gaps in the curtains are very large, and the front desk seems to be in arrears of salary. I don't know if they can't laugh or forget to laugh.

I was too sleepy and wanted to sleep. I wanted to stay for half a day. It's not like I didn't have a deposit.

They called the guest room like crazy and asked for money 100 times. They even knocked on my door and bothered me. I was too sleepy to use my phone to pay. They said they would pay me on the phone.

I slept badly these two days. The day before, the cleaning lady knocked on my door and bothered me. I was so mad.

msg:#Lot# is located opposite the bustling heart of Yiwu, next to Intime Depar**ent Store, not far from the park, very lively, very convenient for eating and shopping.
#房间# Light luxury decoration style, floor-to-ceiling windows can see the opposite street view, the overall is quite comfortable.
#服务# Overall, I feel that the service enthusiasm of the auntie in the guest room is higher than that of the front desk. Aunt Huang in the room depar**ent on the 7th floor is very considerate. She responds to requests in a timely manner. She also thoughtfully prepared extra mini bars, mineral water and garbage bags for us. Hotel service personnel still pay great attention to safety. When you go out without a room card and come back to the elevator, please ask the cleaning lady to check the floor. The aunt first asks the name and room number, and then swipe the card after going to the front desk to confirm. I like the point of being responsible for the safety of customers👍
#设计# There is a gym on the top floor with basic running equipment, which is quite quiet. The breakfast buffet has a wide range of categories, and the dishes are replenished quickly. The room I stayed in was facing the heart of Yiwu, and I thought the sound insulation would be bad because it was close to the road, but I didn't expect it to be quite quiet, and there is no disturbance at all without opening the windows.

It's terrible. I have stayed in this hotel for at least 100 nights. There are at least 80 orders from him on Ctrip. I have never encountered such a front desk. Last month, I waited for a bottle opener for two hours at check-in. If you don't have it, just tell me and I can go out to buy it. I waited for another hour at the front desk and got it from the bar next door. I gave up. Isn't this intentional? They made me wait until one or two in the morning. It's so funny. What a rubbish hotel front desk. It's the same front desk again this time. I said I wanted to call my roommate, but he refused to let me. He forced me to call. I said if my friend's phone is not muted, can I ask you to call? I said I booked the room on my phone, and my friend's name and ID card were reported to you, but it didn't work? It's really funny. What a **. You really think you won't comment, right? If you don't want to do it, you can quit. It's really inexplicable. I was so angry early in the morning. In addition, objectively speaking, don't stay at this hotel. The hotel is old, not clean, and the air conditioner can't adjust the temperature. The room is small. Since you have such a great attitude, I will show you my face. Let your hotel know who I am talking about. I don't believe that my Ctrip account can't comment. If your hotel doesn't believe it, go and check the surveillance. You can also check the surveillance I mentioned last month.

The price is reasonable, the environment is comfortable, and the mattress is Jin Keer. That is, the boss has to recognize the old and let the young people update the IT system. Otherwise, it's a pity that it has a good foundation.

I like most of their bathrooms are big-name bathrooms, Hansgrohe showers, the hot water is very fast, the water is very comfortable to hit the body, and the bedside is also equipped with a jewelry box, like mine It’s the most suitable way to put things randomly. The room is equipped with four bottles of water, so you don’t have to worry about running out of water when you are on a business trip. There is no charge for the delivery notification service after drinking, and the efficiency is very high. Although the TV cannot be projected, there are also Many shows are suitable for audiences of different ages~ The location of the hotel is really nothing to say. I have stayed in so many hotels in Yiwu, and this hotel is the most suitable for me. It is very close to the railway station and the airport, and is close to the newly built Jinyi light rail. It only takes a few minutes to walk from the station. There is a heart of Yiwu on the opposite side, which has a lot of food. There is also an Intime Depar**ent Store diagonally opposite. It is very convenient to solve the problem of girls forgetting to bring anything on a business trip. The hotel is clean and tidy. , In addition, the hotel's free breakfast is too rich, both Chinese and Western food, the price is too high, there are many handmade special snacks in Yiwu, it can be said to have everything, let's talk about the hotel service, see me when you check in to pull a big one Luggage, the security guard at the door is very quick to come forward, and the check-in at the front desk is also fast. Although it is understandable that the epidemic procedures are more troublesome, the front desk is also more user-friendly. I upgraded the room according to your needs, and I washed my clothes when I continued my stay. , when I came back, the room attendant helped me prepare a clothes pole, which was very touching. When I checked out, the lobby manager also consulted about my stay experience. In short, it was a very good stay experience. I recommend staying, and I will come again next time.

If there is an epidemic, actively guide the operation correctly, and you have to drive the guests away. Go that way, aggressive. The service of the lady at the front desk is okay.

The waiter said that others are special! Thought to isolate the hotel! It's not impossible to pack or it needs to be charged! In the end, at my repeated request, the staff delivered milk, juice, and fruit.
4. Ask the guest room if you want tinctures and cotton swabs, and say no! Sent a glass of alcohol and nursing cotton swabs! There are medical cotton swabs all over the stairs! Got the care pack cotton swabs!
5. All the needs are just to disinfect the wound after taking a bath, to eat only a small amount of liquid fruit for meals, and to eat less and more meals!

At the night of check-in, the front desk has been informed that there is a problem with the air conditioner. I just asked the maintenance master to check it. The result of the inspection is that the central air conditioner is 21 degrees on the left and 30 degrees on the right. Let me wait until the air in the room is balanced.
The hardware facilities are really very general, but the service is OK

Let's put it this way in the room. Compared with a brand-level five-star hotel, there is everything in the room. From accessories, to mini bars, to umbrellas, bathrobes, shopping bags and more. The most amazing thing is the breakfast, which is great! It can be said that it can kill many international five-star hotels in seconds! There are not many varieties, but the taste is very good! Relative to this level of hotel, the ceiling is already!
To make a request, see the picture, it is the only shortcoming, the bath towel is too old, it is recommended to deal with it, there have been a lot of thread.

The experience is very poor, the air conditioner is almost a display, regardless of the air-conditioning and heating, it is not very effective, the room's sound insulation is deviated, and the other rooms outside can often hear the door opening.

Advantages: great location, complete toiletries, shopping around, good meals, tasteful decoration, good service from the front desk lady!!!

Breakfast is also given for two people. Breakfast is also delicious, rich in variety, and even seafood. The decoration of the hotel is very beautiful, very graceful and luxurious. The service is also very good. I dropped a can of facial cleanser and sent it back to me for free.
There are also many shortcomings, the lobby is too small and not grand at all. At night, the electricity was cut off and the air-conditioning was forced to turn off. I don’t know if it was the zf order or under the guise of righteousness. The foreign stations on the TV are all scrambled. It should be that the authorization expires and will not be updated.
Overall it is good, recommended!

msg:First of all, because of the epidemic, the hotel directly stopped the elevator leading to the ba*****t. This actually does not match the 5-star rating. Is there any consideration for the luggage of those who come to the hotel to stay? You have to pull the suitcase up and down. The second point, for us, the hotel equipment, because it is relatively old, the equipment is old enough! However, there is no exhaust system in the bathroom, so a 17-year-old hotel can't do it... The air conditioner can't get cold air at all. I don't know if this is controlled by the central control system. But it also depends on the weather. When it's hot, it's still warm... The third point, the size of the hotel room, doesn't match the price of 400 at all... The fourth point, the service problem: the car has been registered and driven out, and before being deducted 75 yuan, I will find the hotel The customer service responded to the problem. He said that I should find a security guard. However, I didn't see the insurance policy at the exit. After paying, a staff member who did not know what he was responsible for came out. He even asked me to drive back to get the money... This attitude is really useless~ In today's society, is there no Internet? Later, it was the Ctrip member I found to deal with it, and it was said that I added WeChat and returned it to me! The above is only my personal opinion, it is a service industry in itself, please match the 5-star mark appropriately.

Two times out of three stays, the shower head in the bathroom was broken, the water flow was small, and there was no hot water. Before 2 o'clock, the cleaning lady came and knocked on my door with the same tone as the warning. I have stayed in so many hotels under Marriott Hyatt. To tell the truth, compared with the five-star business hotel under the group, Puri Mandarin does not have any five-star shadow. If it is not for the location, it can be regarded as the criterion.

By the way, the breakfast is also very rich, which can satisfy people of different tastes. Our family likes it very much. I will choose here next time.

房間大小，面積合適，30來個平方，剛好，感覺還挺温暖的。
電視可看的節目比較多。
早餐，還是比較豐富的，中西餐都有，西式冷餐的火腿，味道特別棒，手動點贊！
地下停車庫車位多，前台登記一次，就可以在入住的幾天自由出入，很方便。

不知道怎麼評到五星級，設施啥的感覺一般，最搞笑的是一刷卡進去發現房間裏面有行李，趕緊出來到前台換房間，額外補了下早餐沒追究了，要是裏面有人真是當場社死啊。。。第二天更搞笑，一個大姐在大廳吵架好像是丟了金項鍊，來了一堆保安，説不讓拍視頻髮網上，過了一個小時下樓居然都還沒結束。
最後説下地理位置，位置對着義烏之心和銀泰，但想要去夜市，小商品市場，篁城服裝批發市場都有兩三公里的尷尬路程，開車過去停車簡直受罪，建議朋友們還是直接入住逛的商場附近的酒店，然後直接走過去最方便。

1）位置一流，市中心，尤其是在義烏之心商場旁邊，很棒。 唯一遺憾的是 節假日 人民路很堵車，湊熱鬧人多
2）酒店設計很用心，硬件不錯。也很大方，冰箱裏飲料隨便喝。床鋪，沙化等也很乾凈
3）服務 應該是很不錯的，尤其是前台
4）早餐也要贊一個

唯一缺點就是城市中心比較繁華，10點前 有點吵。
