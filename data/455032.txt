I contacted the hotel and told them that I needed an extra bed because I had a child. They even upgraded me to a suite for free. I stayed at the Lotus Hotel the night before. Although there were many holiday activities at the Lotus Hotel, the room facilities at the Lotus Hotel were really poor. In comparison, the Mongolian Hotel was much better. The only regret was that I overslept in the morning and didn't experience the hotel's supposedly better Mongolian breakfast.

It is worth recommending to friends from other places. The breakfast is also good and rich in variety. It's perfect for going to the airport. The young man who greeted me at the door helped me carry my luggage to the car. This small gesture is indeed worthy of consideration by other hotels. All in all, I was extremely satisfied with my stay at this hotel during this business trip. It was great.

msg:I am very glad that I chose Inner Mongolia Hotel during the National Day. I was very happy during the entire trip. Inner Mongolia Hotel is luxurious and has rich ethnic characteristics. Let me give you a few details about my feelings for the reference of friends who want to come to Hohhot:
1. For breakfast, I am very grateful to the front desk manager Yang Yueüëçüëçüëç for enthusiastically giving us breakfast for our older children for two mornings, which made the trip more comfortable. The breakfast was rich and varied and of good quality. Both Western and Chinese food were available. The family's favorites were the haggis soup and mutton siu mai. Most of the stores serve authentic haggis, soft and tender, rich in flavour, and the siomai skin and thin fillings are all very delicious. Steamed buns, a breakfast staple, come in various shapes. Children are happy and love to eat vegetables. They are rich in steamed corn and sweet potatoes. Be sure to try them. They are very different and delicious. I like the corn and sweet potatoes here because of the natural ripeness of the food. I actually want to stay here to retire. Food that grows naturally is so rare. It‚Äôs such a taste enjoyment.
2. Thank you very much to the lady at the front desk who enthusiastically upgraded us to a suite when she saw that we had two children. There is an extra bed in the living room. It is convenient and comfortable for a family of four. The room is spacious, bright, clean and tidy with ethnic characteristics. The bedding is also very comfortable for the children. It's so luxurious. It's so comfortable. The service staff was timely and enthusiastic. Children's supplies, slippers and toothpaste, children's toothpaste, rich welcome fruits, mineral water, plenty of kettles, tea sets, etc. are very good in nature every night. Make tea, watch TV and relax for a while. Our stay was very comfortable.
3Ôºé Our favorite place to play is the swimming poolüëçüëçüëçMy little daughter has just learned to swim and she really wants to go swimming with the whole family. Before we go there, I called and asked about the water temperature, which is about 26.8 or 27. I was worried that the water would be too cold for my children to swim. In fact, it is very comfortable. My daughter asked me where it is at 28 degrees at home. Why do I feel cold here? Why is it not cold here at 26.8? I don‚Äôt know, but the water temperature is not a problem at all. I haven‚Äôt been in the water in a few years and I am afraid that the water will be cold. This time I went into the water with me every time and there was no problem. The water temperature is comfortable and the swimming pool is spacious and there are not many people around us. I stayed for 5 days and swam for four days in the afternoon. My daughter couldn‚Äôt swim enough every time and wanted to swim for a while. When she came out of the shower, the water temperature was hot enough and the flow was sufficient. I love this part of swimming this trip because my 5-year-old daughter has become more proficient in breaststroke swimming. The old mother is very happy. On the second floor, you can experience miniature grassland culture with your children. On the 18th floor, you can bring your children to wear ethnic costumes and experience Mongolian afternoon milk tea and make handmade jewelry with your children. There is also a gym on the third floor. The whole family went to the gym once to check in for my daughter‚Äôs dance. My son and father were jogging and playing table tennis. The staff were enthusiastic and took the initiative to bring us water. The gym was very useful. In Hohhot in October, I still like to go to Dazhao Temple in Xiangshawan, Chilechuan. I regret not coming earlier. Maybe the grass is not that green, but Hohhot in autumn has the beauty of autumn, with haystacks, galloping camels, sheep and cattle, cowboys and shepherds on horseback, and my mood is open and my heart is full of joy. Next year, I will go on an in-depth trip to Inner Mongolia with my whole family.

The room feels a bit small...but it does have the cultural characteristics of Inner Mongolia...and it deserves to be called "China's first grassland culture themed hotel"! The entire hotel lobby and the decoration on each floor are full of prairie culture and "yuan" elements.
Originally, I stayed at Inner Mongolia Hotel to dine in the restaurant, so I ate at Inner Mongolia Hotel! But unfortunately...it didn't work out. . . Qianyuan Yimeng Restaurant and Yi'eryan Palace Halal Restaurant both have private rooms suitable for 8-10 people, and individual guests cannot order a la carte. The "Taste of Inner Mongolia" on the first floor accepts individual guests, but there are very few dishes!
The unexpected surprise of staying at the Inner Mongolia Hotel this time is that the executive lounge on the 18th floor of the hotel actually provides free try-on photos of ethnic costumesüì∑Miss Wang in the executive lounge is very nice! Very enthusiastic‚ù§ Patiently and carefully introduced the characteristics of ethnic costumes and how to wear them. He was also very enthusiastic in helping me fasten the few buckles that I couldn‚Äôt quite get! Later I looked at her name tag - Wang Peiyao! Thank you very much Miss Wang for your warm and generous service! This time I had an unexpectedly interesting experience staying at the Inner Mongolia Hotel! Very happy!
On the third day of our stay, a lady brought us a fruit plate and dried nuts. She specifically said that the dried nuts were produced in Inner Mongolia for guests to try. This lady claimed to be a waiter, but the colorful cheongsam she wore (not the black one at the front desk) felt... Leaders or managers, who were in a hurry and did not pay attention to the name tag, would like to express their gratitude to this warm and beautiful lady!

msg:Service: Excellent! Please ask the hotel to add chicken legs to the cleaning staff who cleaned our room on the morning of the 27thüçó. I have stayed in so many hotels at home and abroad, but the housekeeping staff of only two hotels took the initiative to help me clean the tea stains on my tea cup. One was the W Hotel in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the other was the Inner Mongolia Hotel! It‚Äôs really surprising and amazing that the hotel has such excellent service awareness! The service response is also quite fast.

Environment: The decoration is very ethnic and reveals the Inner Mongolian style everywhere. It is a beautiful visual enjoyment for foreign tourists like us. After I left the hotel, I saw a comment saying that there was a yurt behind the hotel. I remember one year I went to Sanya to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival and stayed at the Poly Rosewood Hotel. The hotel held a children‚Äôs rice dumpling-making activity, and gathered the children‚Äôs guests to participate in making rice dumplings with the chef. The experience is very good. It would be very exciting if the hotel could regularly hold some small activities with Mongolian characteristics in the yurt area that guests can participate in together, and try to open up a parent-child section.

Room: I booked a deluxe suite and a parent-child suite. After checking in, I found that the newly renovated parent-child suite was really good. I wanted to change it, but the enthusiastic customer service auntie helped us check that there were only two sets, and the other set was also a continuation live. If more sets of parent-child guest rooms can be renovated, it will surely be more suitable for family travel groups.

Facilities: This section hopes that the hotel can be upgraded and remodeled. The air conditioner in the room is set at 10 degrees, but it is 25 or 26 degrees for a few days, and it is very hot at night. You have to open the windows to feel comfortable, but because the hotel is on the side of the road, the ambient noise is very loud It's big and the lights are very bright. If you open the window and the light shines into the room, it will also affect your sleep.

Facilities: Other reviews also mentioned that the bathroom does not have an exhaust system and the smell is difficult to dissipate. It is true.

Surprise: The floor we live in has a Mongolian free server rental service. The customer service lady said that this service has only been launched for more than ten days, and we are fortunate to be able to participate. Thank you hotel for providing such an opportunity for foreign tourists to experience the ethnic customs.

Summary: The lady at the front desk sincerely asked about the experience of staying in the hotel and told her that the hotel opened in 2002, so the facilities are a bit old. Judging from the current decoration, it should have been a very glorious landmark in the past. It would really be a pity if we were eliminated by the times. I hope to have a better experience when I come here next time, Inner Mongolia Hotel, come on!

Because I was going to the grassland, I set off very early in the morning, so I didn‚Äôt have time to have a solid breakfast. The waiter in the restaurant specially gave me several lunch boxes. I later found out that the meals I took were actually more than what I ate in the restaurant.
If you are tired and don't want to go out, you can go to the executive lounge on the 18th floor to taste the Mongolian culture. The waiter there, Xiao Li, is enthusiastic and professional.
I would also like to thank Sister Wei, the floor attendant, for her detailed answers to my questions.

msg:I chose Inner Mongolia Hotel because I was attracted by its sense of history. As soon as I entered the lobby, I saw the majestic sculpture of Genghis Khan. The hotel has a sense of history and is well maintained, but the room size is too small, similar to a budget hotel.
As for the service, the receptionist at the front desk was arrogant, saying that I could not live above the 4th floor for the room I snatched at a low price in the middle of the night. I would like to express my gratitude to the sister in charge of room service (Room 915, the room management who solved the problem that the door lock could not be opened). Her smiling service and thoughtfulness make me think that this can match this historical and cultural hotel.

The next morning at 5 o'clock in the morning, there was a natural gas project on the road outside, and everyone woke up. We were in traffic very early in the morning, and we stood at the entrance of the lobby and waited for an online car-hailing car for five minutes. Later, we asked about the work in a row in the lobby. Only when the staff knew that the front door was closed, they had to go through the back door. This kind of service awareness in the front hall is really not in place. No one cares about the guests pulling their luggage, and no one reminds the guests that the front door is closed and the road cannot be reached by taxi (delaying the trip).
You may not see the high-ranking management. The reason why I wrote so much nonsense is to remind that products with cultural history should be matched with suitable saddles. Inaction...is a mixed bag.

Bad comment to the room service that night: the room was very cold, the outdoor temperature was 8 degrees that day, there was no heating equipment in the room, and there was no spare quilt. I called the guest room to ask for two extra quilts, but the waiter knocked on the door empty-handed and told the hotel guests Man didn't even have an extra quilt, and then gave me a hand warmer. I was so angry that I continued to call and complain to the manager on duty at the front desk, and then another quilt was delivered (didn‚Äôt it be said before that there were no quilts when it was full?) Fortunately, I finally changed the room the next day, but your hotel does not have heating and air conditioning. Not having any heating was a huge problem.

In addition, the guard at the parking lot has a very arrogant attitude and condescends to question guests. At 9 o'clock in the morning on July 25, we went to the parking lot to rent a car. The corner of the parking lot cooperated with China Car Rental. There was no charge originally, but when the car came out, we were asked to pay 30 yuan. When I told me that the car was rented from China, parking was free. He actually asked us, how can you prove that this car is from China Rental? I said I could provide car rental information, but he arrogantly said he didn't know and asked us to report it to the front desk. After I parked my car and went to the front desk to report, the front desk employee told me that I didn‚Äôt need to report. I just needed to tell him that it was possible to rent a car in China and that this had been done for several years. It was impossible for the parking lot employees not to know that this security guard was obviously there. Taking advantage of guests is a bad habit of employees of state-owned enterprises. When I showed up, I told him that we were hotel guests. Even if we were not renting a car from China, as a service staff, he should not be so unprofessional. He could ask me to produce relevant certificates, but he could not interrogate the guests condescendingly. He actually said with an arrogant attitude that he was serving the entire hotel, not me personally. Am I not a hotel guest if I rent a Shenzhou car? How could there be such rude staff? Why would the hotel hire such a person with such poor quality? It must be the style of state-owned enterprises in Inner Mongolia. He should have nepotism. In short, one rat droppings spoiled the whole pot of porridge.

The internal facilities are outdated and backward, the room smells of smoke, the bathroom is stinky, and the weather is freezing. The hotel can't even turn on the heater. The service concept is like an old state-owned guest house from the last century. It really disgraces Hohhot and even Inner Mongolia, and directly makes people lose their favorable impression of Hohhot! The entire hotel is occupied by people on business trips. Individual travelers must not book, it‚Äôs a sinkhole!

It was too big, and it was more authentic and delicious than other online celebrities. NS. The service is very good, the free Mongolian clothes are gorgeous and the photos are beautiful. The intern sister in the lobby is very professional, and she helped to pack the special products that I bought for free. She was more careful than the airport taxi.

I came to Hohhot for the first time, I chose the Inner Mongolia Hotel
A very wise choice, from the uncle in the parking lot, to the two boys at the front desk and the intern girl on the 18th floor (evaluating the girl in the picture), it really makes people feel friendly and professional, answer all questions, skilled and patient .
The room is not particularly big, but the strong grassland wind, with all the facilities. Looking out the window is the Inner Mongolia Library. It is not far from the Natural History Museum, the Old Street, and the Zhaojun Museum. It is especially convenient for eating around, and the Erdun Shabu-shabu is good. It's not expensive to eat, it's very recommended.
When I come to Hohhot, I will choose the Inner Mongolia Hotel

But after all, it is an old hotel, and the equipment needs to be updated. In the shower, when using the small shower nozzle to hot water, the big nozzle above the head will drip cold water, which is the case after changing several rooms. The shower curtain can't block the water, it flows everywhere on the bathroom floor, and it is easy to slip when wearing disposable slippers; in addition, the room lights are dim.

The details, goods, services and bed comfort created by the Inner Mongolia Hotel fully meet the standards of a 5-star hotel.

Although the standard room is smaller than other 5-star hotels, the hotel is full of ethnic characteristics in Inner Mongolia. For friends who go to Inner Mongolia for the first time, or friends who want to take pictures, the value is much greater than that of staying in other 5-star hotels.

What is particularly touching is the very good hotel service. The concierge, Mr. Mao Wenlong, is sunny and positive. His smile and etiquette are very pleasant. From the moment we arrived to help carry the luggage to the room and warmly introduce the surrounding customs, and when we left, we helped to carry the luggage again and delivered it. The travel guide to Inner Mongolia is so sweet!

My first reaction was to open the window and found that the window handle had been removed. I needed to I asked the waiter to open it; then the bathroom started to smell bad. I slept until midnight and the smell of the sewer became stronger and stronger. I spent the whole night in the mixed smell of cigarette smoke and sewer. The hygienic conditions of the breakfast were poor. Several plates were taken in a row with stains on them. In a five-star restaurant, the coffee machine was not turned on, but there was an iron pot next to it that said it was coffee. I poured a cup of it, which was made from three-in-one instant coffee. When we checked in, we were forced to pay a deposit. We had already paid the deposit, but they did not refund it after we checked in. We called to inquire before the deposit was refunded.

msg:The room is okay, a little small, the office area is not big, and you need to stand in the bathtub when taking a shower. The room service is good, the front desk service is good, the restaurant waiters are good (there is an uncle with a better attitude), and the guy at the door takes the initiative to take the luggage and entertain you in the car, which is very good. However, there are three flaws in the fly in the oin**ent (it can also be said to be a failure): one is that the dinner buffet is said to be 168 per person, half price for children, but in the end it is 168 + 118 = 286, and it is not clear why the half price is 118 instead of 84 in the end. , and there is a mysterious signed document that I have no impression of and does not look like my own signature! The second is that the executive lounge is not open, so the extra one hundred and ten yuan to book an executive room is meaningless! The third is to continue to use the buffet in the afternoon on the day of check-out, but was told that only those who have not returned the room can pay 168 per person. After check-out, they need more than 200 per person. It's like a feeling of who you love when you leave the room! I have always wondered, if the restaurant or the so-called financial system is so rigid, will your boss praise you for your personality, or do you say that you are too lazy to earn money, or do you think that whether you earn money or not has nothing to do with you?

The room is very small, and it is very inconvenient to take a shower. You have to stand in a small bathtub to wash, which is extremely inconvenient.
