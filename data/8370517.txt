It is extremely far. We arrived and after paying their high prices we had a room without views. 

We had chosen a room called panoramic room viee and we got a view to a wall. 

I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you can call and be sure what room will be given. 

There are no elevators neither. You have to transport your stuff upstairs.

Coming from Shangrila, which I highly recommend, the hotel picked us up and brought us 2 1/2 hours to the hotel, which sits at 10,000 feet above sea level.    The very staff led us on 3 sightseeing events, including rafting & walking on a glass platform.   We elected to have a dinner not at the restaurant but in one of the few BBQ stands nearby while overlooking the mountain range.   The room in Building 8 was huge, clean, and equipped with a large bathtub.    The following day we took the tour bus up to the peak at 14,000 feet - again accompanied by super friendly hotel staff.  Although the breakfast was just adequate and the beds squeaked on every turn, this hotel is worthy of the higher price & 6 stars!!!

We arrived by car and had to pick up the tickets to the National Park, that was very well arranged and the reception of the Park was informed about our arrival. We arrived at the hotel after an hour of drive through stunning landscape. We were greeted in the most welcoming way by hotel staff and walked to our room which had a huge balcony facing breathtaking view over the mountains. The hotel has great architecture blending into natural surroundings and someone is making great effort in keeping it that way, modern appliances are all painted red brick so they don’t stick out of the whole impression. We had a dinner at the restaurant which was delicious and staff was very welcoming. The number of attraction is quite long but we would strongly recommend to get ready and take an individual hikes. The staff of the hotel was extremely helpful and responsive to our every need. It was definitely a trip worth a drive from Lijiang.

msg:First of all, Balagezong is worth going to. It has snow-capped mountains, cliffs, and canyons all in one place... much more fun than Lijiang.
However, because the location is remote and transportation is not very convenient, it is wise to choose to stay there for one night. The guy who checked in was very enthusiastic and explained everything clearly, and the rest of the tour was clearly and properly arranged!
However, I don't quite understand why this hotel is five stars? My expectations were a bit high, but the gap in actual check-in was too big. The design concept of the hotel itself is rather crude and unreasonable. The so-called mountain view room is actually not the place you imagine lying down and looking at the mountain view. When you open the window, what you see is actually a public corridor... This design with no privacy is really stupid.
The price of the hotel's own restaurant is very high, which is understandable since you are in a scenic spot, but the fried food is not very delicious, and there is no other choice when staying here. Alas... in short, everyone should lower their expectations. .

In this place, the stories are more attractive than the reality, and it is inevitable that you will feel disappointed after arriving. The place is remote and it is difficult to connect with traffic. It is understandable that scenic spots and hotel operations have to overcome many difficulties. However, these difficulties and hidden costs will also be reflected in the hotel's hardware and services.
In general, the facilities are old, the hygiene is poor, the catering is sloppy, and the service lacks enthusiasm.
As for the scenery, for me, who has been to Xinjiang and Tibet, it belongs to the category of "Don't look at the mountains when you return from Mount Tai, and don't look at the mountains when you return from the Five Mountains." This place should be under the Five Mountains.

msg:I have stayed in hotels in various scenic spots across the country. The Cliff Snow Hotel in Balagezong is the most satisfactory. The reasons are as follows.

1. Special car transfer: The hotel arranged for a boy to pick us up in Shangri-La city. If you take a taxi back and forth, it will cost you 500 yuan.
2. The hotel has complete facilities: floor heating, air conditioning, humidifier, and bathtub. The only drawback is that the bedding needs to be upgraded, such as pillows and so on.
3. The hotel has a good environment. You can see the snow-capped mountains from the balcony, and you can take photos of the Golden Dome in the morning.
4. The service is pretty good. The butler will help with simple itinerary planning. In addition to bus pick-up and drop-off at scenic spots, he will also arrange car pick-up and drop-off at the hotel.
5. The price-performance ratio is good. Our twin room costs 1,080 yuan, including tickets, injections, and transfers. If you come alone *tickets, accommodation, etc., it will be more than this price.
6. The supporting Chinese restaurant and breakfast are quite sincere, not as good as a five-star hotel, but much better than an ordinary hotel.

He helped us with our luggage. When we got to the Napa Sea Observation Deck, he even let us get off the train and take photos, chatting and introducing us all the way. Very good! The housekeeper also helped us plan our itinerary, and helped us contact the master in advance when we were in a hurry~ The master who sent us to the fork in the road was also very nice. The time we met was extended, and the master also waited with us. He was very patient! Like, like, like!
The hotel environment is very good. I saw the starry sky from the observation deck on the third floor last night and saw the sun shining on Jinshan Mountain in the morning. It was perfect. The portions of the complimentary breakfast are scary. All in all a very satisfying experience!

After driving to the hotel, the butler will arrange the tour itinerary. The Echo Gallery will be picked up by a commercial vehicle, the pagoda will follow the bus, and the Grand Canyon will be self-driving on the return trip.
Get a ticket for an attraction, you can choose the Whispering Gallery zipline or Grand Canyon rafting. I chose rafting.

Special praise to Sonam, who took us to Shambhala Pagoda. The driving skills are excellent, and he introduced us to the local customs and culture, which was very interesting. When we go to a place where we can take pictures or have a good view, we will ask if we want to take pictures. This service is great!

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, it should be the best hotel in Balagezong. The terrain is the highest and the view is wide. It is closest to the Echo Gallery, Ropeway and Sky Mirror. Butler-style service and thoughtful travel arrangements. In the morning, on the balcony of the room, he took us to the natural pagoda after watching the golden mountain in the sun. I was only given an hour, so I didn’t have much fun. In the afternoon, we arranged to go all the way down the mountain. The driver named Suonan explained the whole process to us and took us to rafting. The service was very good. The shortcomings of the hotel are that the decoration of the room is a bit old, the floor heating is not very warm after being turned on all night, and the water in the shower is not large. The hotel's pick-up and drop-off service was not very clear, so I thought we could only go from the entrance of the scenic spot to the hotel and back. It turns out that you can also pick up and drop off at the ancient city, the airport and the high-speed rail station. Friends who want to visit Balagezong later should note that you can call in advance to reserve a pick-up and drop-off from Shangri-La City, which can save a lot of charter fees.

As for the view, you may need to book a suite with a view, and the view from other rooms is limited. A room at this price is worth it because it comes with scenic spot tickets, otherwise it is really not worth staying. I chose this hotel in the scenic spot because I thought I could drive myself into the scenic spot. The entire mountain road has eighteen turns, which is exciting, beautiful and spectacular.

This scenic area should be the only place in Shangri-La that combines food, accommodation and transportation. It is especially recommended to stay here for one night, so that the whole trip will be very convenient. Leisurely, the hotel is located in Bala Village. If you stay for one night, you can get free tickets for two people, plus two tickets to the pagoda for 70 yuan/person. The price/performance ratio is still very high, and you can also feel the exotic style of the ******* hotel. When you check in at the hotel entrance, there will be a welcome ceremony by the hotel. The hotel is equipped with a butler. This time, I would like to emphasize that the butler Yinuo is very responsible. After understanding the tourist's itinerary, he will help the tourist plan a tour route.

The hotel facilities themselves are about average for affordable chains, but the room has a bathtub and the view is actually worth the price. Moreover, the hotel is in a scenic spot, and buses provide free pick-up and drop-off to all scenic spots. Basically, if you stay in this hotel, you don’t need to pay extra for wherever you go. (The additional included scenic spot tickets are 2✖️170 plus the Buddhist Pagoda Mountain ticket is 2✖️75, plus a rafting ticket of 100, which is a very good deal)
After talking about the hotel facilities, let’s talk about the travel experience.
Going deep into the ******* areas in the mountains is actually where you most want to experience the humanities and customs. If you pay attention, you will find that the hotel conveys their national stories, culture, their religious beliefs, and their kindness and enthusiasm through various details. I believe that after entering this secret realm, you will definitely feel the baptism of spirit and inner peace.
Special thanks to Xiao Yang. The small girl must help the guests carry their luggage upstairs.
Special thanks to Suonan for helping us drive the car down the mountain. He was full of enthusiasm and thoughtful service along the way. I fell in love with him even more after learning his story. I wish the people of Bala eternal well-being, Tashi Delek.

2. Dry meals are relatively simple and can be understood in the mountains, but it would be inappropriate if the ingredients go bad. Are we still short of corn in Yunnan? See the picture.

Rent a car to go to Balagezong, the scenery on the 214 national road is superb. Staying at Miracle Cliff Hotel, the housekeeper is warm and thoughtful. Scenic tour arrangements are very good. Next time you come back, you must visit the pagoda on foot. It is very shocking!

msg:Balagezong is a relatively new scenic spot in Shangri-La, but the scenery is really amazing! Alpine canyons, big rivers and snow-capped mountains, dense jungles, and ziplines flying over kilometer canyons. The hotel is located on the top of the Grand Canyon, really on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the huge Shangri-La Grand Canyon, the feeling of overlooking the Lingyun is really amazing. The hotel's service is quite comprehensive. There will be a shuttle bus to arrange your itinerary for the day. The butler is responsible for all your itinerary during your stay. Our butler is Yinuo, who is very thoughtful and has a great attitude. Upgraded the balcony view room, the room is super big with a huge terrace, great view. We immediately decided to stay for another day as a rest point during the journey.

Unexpectedly, there is such a five-star hotel (room, view) in Bala Village, which is 3,000 meters above sea level in Balagezong Shenshan. It is complete, and there are children's slides and tents in the living room. Looking out from the bedroom, you will see the towering holy mountain and the ancient Laba village on the opposite side, just like being in a fairyland!
What is moving is the enthusiastic and simple ******* compatriots. The young man is very enthusiastic and helps us move our heavy luggage to the room. , the Bala Village located in the embrace of the sacred mountain and the touching stories about the Bala village; there is also the peaceful, quiet and yearning sacred mountain...

msg:There are 3 hotels in the scenic spot, all of which are managed by the scenic spot itself, 2 hotels (cliff) are in Bala Village, and 1 hotel (ice and snow) is opposite Bala Village;
The one in Bala Village is better equipped, so you can take a stroll;
The hardware facilities are much better than the one opposite Bala Village. The windows are large and transparent, and the room has much better lighting and is not cold (Picture 7)

Service: The locals are simple and enthusiastic;
Catering: Breakfast is really hard to say;
Other restaurants in the scenic area are as follows:
1. There is a restaurant in the hotel in Bala Village, which has enough food, but the taste is really hard to describe;
2. There is a coffee shop in the village, which is very expensive (58/cup), unbearable, and the quality is not good;
3. There is a barbecue and butter tea shop under the coffee shop, so-so;
That's all for eating, no more...
Room: Maintenance needs to be strengthened, the door lock is broken and cannot be locked, the airtightness of the room needs to be improved, and the lighting needs to be improved (*******-style tube building), so there will be bugs (as shown in Figure 3), and there are 2 beetles, I killed them and threw them away Haha, you must have a good attitude.
TV: This is really broken...Tencent Video collapsed when it was opened, and I was almost driven crazy. It is strongly recommended that the hotel replace it with a Xiaomi box. This is really difficult to use...
Scenery: There is no snow, it feels normal, maybe we have seen too much all the way, from Nujiang~Zhiziluo~Bingzhongluo~Feilai Temple all the way, a little aesthetically tired, winter should be better;
Traffic: full of scissors bends, drive carefully, 1 hour from Shangri-La to the gate of the scenic spot, 30 minutes from the gate of the scenic spot to the hotel, and 40 minutes from the hotel to the top of the mountain.

If you go to the scenic spot, it is recommended to live in a scenic hotel, including 2 tickets and a single zipline, it is still very cost-effective, and it is not so hard;

Learn about the experience of Sina Dingzhu (the founder of Balagezong), this is a place with a story, you can take a look.

msg:The last stop in Shangri-La, I stayed in the hotel for two consecutive nights and had a very relaxed time to visit various attractions in Balagezong. Everything is beautiful and pure. I am moved by the story of Balagezong and feel awe. I had a lot of fun and satisfaction based on the tour itinerary customized by the butler, and everyone I met was warm and friendly.
The negative review was based on the final drop-off plan from the hotel to the airport, and the time arrangement was very problematic. The flight steward arranged for departure at 10:30 at 8 o'clock. When we set off, we chatted with the driver and learned that it would take at least two hours to get to the airport. Moreover, the driver was only informed that we would take him to Shangri-La and did not know that the destination was the airport. As we all know, check-in closes forty minutes before flight departure, and the boarding gate closes fifteen minutes before departure. The driver drove fast to overtake all the way to catch the flight, and the road was icy and rocky. It felt like he was leaving his life here. Finally, I ran all the way down to the terminal at 9:50, only five minutes before the check-in deadline, and the door closed at 10:11.
The worst experience of this trip was all along this route. Even if the schedule was scheduled half an hour in advance, the driver and I could leisurely get to the airport all the way without fear. When I think about it, the problem lies in the butler's customized time management. Countless tourists come to Balagezong every year. I must not be the only one who has purchased the airport pick-up and drop-off service. The butler should be very experienced in time management, so I think the problem lies in The housekeeper is lazy and undisciplined in his work. A negative review hopes to attract the attention of the hotel and prevent this kind of joke on the safety of drivers and guests from happening again.
In addition, before getting off the bus, I specifically asked the driver’s name. Mr. Lausanne helped me catch my flight and listened to my complaints all the way but comforted me all the way. Thank you very much. I hope the hotel will take this matter seriously and reward the driver, arrange the itinerary reasonably and not put all the time pressure on me. Give it to the driver, after all, safety comes first.

I originally thought that a room with a price of almost 1,000 would be a surprise, but I was really surprised by the cleanliness. I found footprints on the sheets and changed them again, but I still saw stains. I finally thought about it and put down a disposable mattress myself without bothering at night. The hardware facilities are similar to those of a fast hotel. The room rate is probably more expensive because it includes scenic spot tickets and a one-day tour. The snow mountain tour is still worth it.

msg:First, let’s talk about the so-called butler’s problem in this hotel: After arriving at the hotel and checking in, the butler started to introduce the itinerary. It was very unreasonable and incoherent, and inconsistent with the facts. As we all know, the core of this scenic spot is the pagoda. The butler soon said that that day The bus did not go to the pagoda, so we were asked to go the next day. When we said we would go directly to the next scenic spot the next day, we changed our words and said it was available. In fact, the purpose of the butler is to make you spend a few hundred yuan to a few dollars. Charter a bus for 1,000 yuan, so you can go anywhere. Otherwise, you can’t go to 2 of the 3 scenic spots. In fact, there is a bus at the entrance of the scenic spot. Just ask at the ticket office. Take the same route and visit the same scenic spots. This is the core of the scenic spot. There are only three scenic spots: Shambhala Pagoda, Echo Wall, and Shangri-La Grand Canyon.
  Secondly, there is a restaurant 5 meters from the hotel door, where you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner (lunch and dinner are at your own expense). However, this so-called butler seems to have a conflict of interest and contradiction with the restaurant. He actually deceived us and said that the restaurant only served There was no lunch or dinner for breakfast, and I didn’t pay for it at my own expense. I kept fooling myself into walking a few minutes away to eat at a coffee shop in Bala Village, and told them the name of the hotel and gave them butter tea. In fact, it was just to get a kickback. The taste of this restaurant is different from The price is very good in the mountainous area.
  Finally, let’s talk about the facilities and services. The service is really poor. The interior of the room is only 2-3 diamonds at best. The price/performance ratio is too low. One night at a normal price is actually enough. As for the facilities, let’s see There is nothing there, just a normal hotel or guest house.

msg:One of the most impressive places in the trip to Yunnan is as profound as seeing the Rizhao Jinshan of Meili Snow Mountain in Feilai Temple. It feels so good! Driving to the hotel in the canyon, it was the afternoon of the New Year’s Eve, there were few people along the way, a misty and swift stream was on the right, and towering cliffs were on the left. The afternoon sun was very good, which did not surprise me. The scenery, but it just feels very warm and relaxing, very good. There are many detours to reach the hotel, so it is no problem to drive slowly. I thought it was one room, but it turned out to be a suite on the second floor of a hidden house with a very good view. I had dinner at the hotel at my own expense, watched the Spring Festival Gala in the living room, opened the window in the bedroom at night, looked at the dark mountain outside, and the sporadic lights of several nearby houses. The sky is full of stars, and there are shooting stars, the wind blowing is cool but not icy, and the indoor floor heating is very warm. There is no peculiar smell in the air, no smell of smoke, no smells in the city, it is very clean. Moments like this make me sleepy.
    The next day, after eating the breakfast provided by the hotel, the bus took our tourists to the Shambhala Stupa, which is 4,200 meters above sea level. After returning, I went to take the cableway that was delivered. Then I drove back to Shangri-La by myself after one o'clock in the afternoon. That afternoon, in the Balagezong Scenic Area, there was no one on the road, but I didn’t feel scared at all. Instead, I was very happy, comfortable and warm. The air is so good, the water quality is so good, it feels so good, I really like it here. In this uninhabited and not desolate mountain, there are canyons, streams, and the roads are pretty good (except for the road that was just entering the scenic spot). There is sunshine, yaks, and occasional cars and local ******* people pass by. Stop when you see a place with a good view, take a look at the view, eat something and take a break. You don't have to think about work and life, no one disturbs you, and you don't want other freedom. What a wonderful memory!

In fact, the scenic area is managed by a company founded by Mr. Sina Dingzhu, a passer-by, and it is very reasonable and orderly. The biggest advantage of living in the scenic area is that you can stagger the flow of people and really integrate into this small village outside the world. After waking up in the morning, the sun shines on Jinshan, and you walk along the path to the experience hall, butter tea, Internet celebrity cafes, and Baita to pray for blessings...Enjoy the slow Life. There is also a beautiful starry sky at night. If you are interested, you can go to the pagoda to appreciate the wonders of nature's creations.

msg:Very satisfied. The hotel is located in the Balagezong Scenic Spot. Because of the off-season self-driving car, you can drive into the scenic spot. You can drive up with the hotel order car at the entrance of the scenic spot. The mountain road from the scenic spot to the hotel is comparable to Yilubo. People drove slowly without a car, and the lights were gone along the way. The hotel is very clean and equipped with floor heating, which is really comfortable for the plateau hotel floor heating. The hotel is in the village of Bala, the scenery is very good, and the lady at the front desk will also help you plan your itinerary.

msg:I came to Balagezong once at the end of last year. At that time, I was very impressed by the beauty of the scenic spot and the meticulous service. Because the one-day trip was a little rushed, I couldn't experience it in depth, so I came again this year. Here, and booked two nights of accommodation, so that you can have another in-depth and intimate contact with the Balagezong Scenic Spot.

This time, I booked a double bed room with a panoramic view of the snow mountain worship. When I was brought to the room by the hotel staff on the day of check-in, I was stunned when I opened the door. Well, it's a very spacious space for one person, and even two people are very comfortable.
The hotel is located in Bala Village, a thousand-year-old village. It is a complex of small buildings. The room I stayed in was located at the top of the entire complex. The natural police officer is also very good. To the magnificent scenery of Balagezong, although the sunrise and sunset cannot be seen, the majestic mountains are enough to make people move.

Next, I want to focus on the service of the hotel, which is also what I am most satisfied with. At first glance, the price of nearly 2,500 yuan for two nights cannot be described as cheap, but the additional attributes included are real money:
First of all, there is no need to say much about the tickets for the scenic spot. If you buy it separately, it will cost more than 100 yuan;
Secondly, the round-trip transfer is definitely worth the return fare. It takes two hours to travel from Shangri-La to Balagezong. As long as you are in Shangri-La, you can pick up the hotel door, and you can also send it to any designated place after checking out. It is very convenient for tourists with luggage. Let’s not talk about self-driving tours. If you take a car by yourself, you can only buy a through ticket for the scenic spot, which costs more than 200 yuan;
Then, this package also includes the play items in the scenic area and the through trains in the scenic area. The drifting of the Shangri-La Grand Canyon and the zipline of the Echo Wall will add up to two or three hundred. In addition, there are also unconventional routes to and from the Shambhala Pagoda. Pick-up, this is not included in the itinerary of the one-day tour, and needs to be charged separately. To put it simply, after staying in a hotel in the scenic spot, all the scenic spots can be played at will, so the cost-effectiveness will definitely rise;
In addition, the hotel also provides one-on-one itinerary planning services. I would like to thank my exclusive butler, brother Yongzhong, for helping me plan the activities for the whole day, saving my own brains. If the weather is not good, There are also plans for planB. At the same time, when going to various scenic spots, they have also coordinated the pick-up and drop-off vehicles. Unlike tourists on day trips, hotel guests are picked up by exclusive business vehicles. Even if there is only one tourist, they will be sent to the corresponding scenic spots. The experience is absolutely impeccable.
In the end, the hotel also provides a door-to-door nucleic acid service, which is also for tourists' travel considerations. It was originally at the entrance of the scenic spot, but in the end, it was changed to come to the door of the hotel front desk to do the nucleic acid, which is definitely too convenient, because from the hotel to the scenic spot The gate is nearly an hour away.
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel staff. They can help with luggage during check-in and check-out. It is definitely a physical job to carry my 50 to 60 kilograms of luggage. Without their help, it is really hard to go up and down the stairs by myself. it's more difficult

If I want to rate the hotel, then I can give 99 points. The lesser 1 point should be the hotel's breakfast. There are indeed fewer choices. It would be better if the quantity and variety can be enriched. But I am also very considerate and understandable. After all, as a hotel in the deep mountains, it is not easy to have such excellent hardware facilities and software services. What else can you be picky about?

msg:I met a lot of warm people in Bala Village. Some of the hotel staff are aboriginal people, their education level is not high, they have simple smiles, and they communicate with the pure hearts of outsiders. Everyone is doing their best to be themselves. I am really grateful for the housekeeper's caring, two lovely battery car drivers, who carry us to experience the romance of the mountains and the wind, and the three major guardians of driving an airship, because I received information that Xiamen might be closed temporarily. Suddenly decided to leave and go back to Xiamen, the bus driver who was holding a suitcase of ours (never seen such a big and heavy one) and smilingly waiting for us at the entrance of the village with a license plate of 80588, knocked on my door when he was leaving Window, saying that we will meet again, I burst into tears and moved, and Bala's eyes added a lot of reluctance to leave. Here you can really find a small piece of pure spiritual land that belongs to you, and you will never forget it. This trip felt the most beautiful fusion of heaven, earth and people. (Looking forward to meeting Bala Village again)

Service: The customer service contacted in advance the day before the trip to confirm the situation. The overall itinerary was arranged by a butler, so I am very relieved~ Butler: Yan Aiping Wangdui is very good! Thanks for the arrangement!

 Be sure to go to the stupa on the top of the mountain! The view is super! Although the Daba Mountain road is steep, it is worth it to climb to the top! And it's very empty! Really really going! This is the most worthwhile!

One-person ticket for 1000-meter high-altitude thrilling zipline or 1000-meter canyon leisure rafting: be sure to experience the zipline! Rafting is actually rafting in the river in the canyon, but it is also very comfortable~

Just to play freely, the driver who will be sent back to Shangri-La will be urged at every point from the time we eat, and will keep us hurrying up, because the three adult Grand Canyon has already gone very fast, because it is too dry to sit and drift. We wanted to rest for five minutes, and the driver immediately came over to urge us to get on the car and go back to Shangri-La. The car drove very quickly and often braked on the way. All three of us got motion sickness because we wanted to go again in winter.

msg:On this trip to Shangri-La, we stayed in three hotels in total, and the Cliff Miracle Hotel in Balagezong should be the one with the best hardware conditions. Especially after learning about the history of Balagezong Scenic Spot and the deeds of general manager Sina Dingzhu, I feel even more respectful and feel that it is really not easy for the hotel hardware to achieve such conditions. The whole Balagezong has been electrified for less than 15 years. We drove all the way to the Cliff Miracle Hotel, and built a spectacular hotel group at an altitude of more than 2,800 meters. It is really amazing. The Little Yellow Duck Family Suite we booked has a large area, a large bed, and a terrace with a view of the scenery. Even the bathroom is very spacious, with a large bathtub by the window, which made our jaw drop in the plateau, not to mention the separation of wet and dry in the toilet, shower and basin. The little yellow duck element children like it very much. The wide and big bed is covered with a little yellow duck blanket and a little yellow duck doll. The carpet is a pair of little yellow duck checkers. A small tent, spread out and placed on the carpet, children like to play in it. The mattress is not only large, but also very comfortable, and the mattress is firm enough. I was lying on one side, and the child turned and jumped beside me. The result of a mattress that is too soft is that the husband or child rolls over and moves, and when I lie down, the bed shakes and makes me dizzy and nauseous.
After we checked in, the hotel gave us a piece of fruit. The restaurant provides a free buffet breakfast. The tableware is very new, and the shape of the bowl is also very unique. There are not too many dishes in the breakfast, but there are staple food, fried vegetables, milk, eggs, co**** grains, etc., as well as butter tea. Only rice noodles are cooked now, and a spoonful of spicy minced pork is standard, which is just enough to eat, and a bowl of warm belly.
The disadvantage of hardware is that the stairs leading to the second floor of the restaurant are too steep, and the stairs are too narrow. It is really difficult to go upstairs with a plate. There are many lights in the bathroom of the room with corresponding switches, but the sensor at the door seems to have no effect. One problem caused by the spacious bathroom is that the shelf for placing clean towels is installed in the middle of the shower room and the bathtub, but it is inconvenient to take towels from both sides, and there is no convenient place to put clean clothes in the bathroom.
The general manager Sina Dingzhu said in a letter to the guests that the service staff here are all my old folks, they are not very educated, but they will serve warmly. Looking at the service of the cliff miracle, it is true, every staff member is very enthusiastic, and especially sincere and simple. After checking in at the store, a young and handsome housekeeper Tashi introduced us to the tourist attractions and helped to formulate a tourist route in Balagezong.
We feel the same about hotels as we feel about scenic spots. The foundation is very good, but there is still room for improvement in details.
Another advantage of staying in this hotel is that you can drive to various scenic spots in the scenic area. Of course, your driving skills must be able to pass the customs (to deal with more than 50 hairpin turns).

It is all a big uphill + hairpin bend, which is really not something that ordinary drivers can handle. It is recommended to contact the hotel in advance, it is more reliable to take a scenic car or a car sent by the hotel to pick up.
The hotel room is very clean, with floor heating and air conditioning, and the bathroom is huge, too. I didn't feel it when I checked in at night. When I opened the curtains the next morning, the clouds and mist outside were so beautiful. For breakfast, it is quite rich, and the service of a ******* sister is very beautiful.
Service is also a plus. When we checked in on the first day, it was a bit unpleasant, but when we arrived at the front desk, the housekeeper in charge of reception managed to defuse our anger very well. In addition, he gave each guest a one-to-one plan and suggested the itinerary for the next day, and finally arranged for a car to send us to the park gate to meet with our chartered driver. All in all, it's very thoughtful.
If you go to Balagezong, it is really recommended to stay one night on the mountain, which saves time and has a different accommodation experience.

Early in the morning, the hotel sent a car to the ancient city of Dukezong to pick us up. The driver, Mr. Li of the Bai nationality, warmly greeted him. The Buick commercial vehicle was clean and tidy, with superb driving skills, and it drove steadily and quickly. The Ctrip package is very favorable. The suite room rate of more than 2,000 yuan in the peak season includes round-trip transfer and scenic spot tickets for 2 people, as well as zipline and rafting in the Grand Canyon for 1 person. After arriving, the housekeeper Zhaxi provided service, warm and thoughtful, the little brother at the front desk and the beautiful Dolma assigned us 4 rooms on the second floor of the building. The view was excellent, the white clouds were lingering, and the sacred mountain was right in front of us. Balagezong was deeply shocked and moved speechlessly.
       The Whispering Gallery, Shambhala Pagoda, Grand Canyon, and every attraction arranged by the hotel are worth visiting. The family of three left the best memories here! Balagezong, the miracle of the snow mountain cliff, we will miss you. ❤️

msg:The beauty of Balagezong is a bit different. Although it is located on a plateau, the mountain has some aura in the south of the Yangtze River, especially the clouds and mists that can be seen at any time in the rainy season, which has a feeling of Huangshan.
The hotel is located on the mountain, the scenery is very good, the room is very large, the architectural style is in line with the local characteristics, the room meets the standard of high-star hotels, the suite is very large, and the scenery outside the window is really amazing.
Driving in by yourself is much better than driving in a scenic spot. Staying in the scenic spot for one night is much better than simply walking around and watching the flowers in a scenic car tour. The scenery of this scenic spot can be more appreciated when it is far away from the crowd.

It is commendable that although there are only two restaurants in the scenic spot, But the price is good and the taste is good. There is also a milk tea shop, 18 cups, which is a conscientious price in such a deep mountain scenic spot, and I buy it several times a day.

It rained in the middle of the night on the first day, and the next morning I saw the fairytale scenery. I was in the clouds and mist, and it felt very strange. Playing in the Echo Wall and the glass plank road, it suddenly became clear, suddenly enlightened, and the landscape was very spectacular. It is strongly recommended to choose the ropeway for the play items provided by the hotel. I was scared at first. After sitting on it, I found it was safe and it was really exciting and fun! Even my 60-year-old parents sat and praised the ropeway, which became the most memorable experience of their entire journey. It is recommended to stay for two nights and savor the beauty of Balagezong

It is touching that a man has gone through hardships to build roads and lead his hometown to become rich. The manor is very well done. The butlers are very attentive and the service is first-class. In order to accompany us well, the newcomer Zhuo Ma Lamu has repeatedly responded to fears by taking pictures of us on the glass path and recommending local specialties. The breakfast is very good, with scientific collocation, and many local specialties. When I came back, the driver Larong thoughtfully drove the car up the mountain and accompanied me to worship Tara. He was very attentive and at home on the way. The most shocking thing is the Shambhala Stupa. I have been there, and I feel that I have no regrets in this life.

In fact, it is understandable that it is a resort hotel in a large scenic spot, which can be picked up from the mountain by the hotel, and the service is very good.
There is an exclusive butler to help introduce the itinerary and arrangements. In addition, because we arrived very late, the restaurant also waited for us specially, which was very touching and delicious.
The rooms are large and the facilities are actually quite good, but some rooms may be new and have some flavor. In addition, it was estimated to be overloaded on National Day, and the power was out for a while.
The breakfast tastes good, and the choices are okay, mainly because their restaurant tastes good and the price is very high.
There are more for fun. We chose the pagoda. If you stay for a long time, you can play the ropeway and rafting again. It is suitable for bringing a baby.
Generally speaking, although it is a later artificial scenic spot, it is quite beautiful and the service environment is good. recommend

msg:Very good value hotel, I strongly recommend that if you come to Shangri-La, go to Balagezong Scenic Area and stay at this hotel. First check in the hotel to send tickets to the scenic area, and you can also drive into the scenic area by yourself. If you don't drive by yourself, I heard that you can pick up and drop off at your door. The service is very good and there is a dedicated butler service. Since the scenic area is very large, self-driving will be very cool. The roads in the scenic area are very well repaired. Although it is a mountain road, the road can be taken by buses, and cars and off-road vehicles are no problem. The scenic spot is very good, I won't introduce it. You can watch the travel notes and videos about Balagezong. Shangri-La has to promote this scenic spot, which is much better than Pudacuo. The hotel’s breakfast is average, but the service is very good. We ordered a suite. There is a fireplace in the living room. There is also an arrangement for us to add firewood to burn it. The surrounding stove is good at night. The advantage of staying here is that there is plenty of time to play in the scenic area. The hotel also has a two-night package, which is not expensive, but I think it is enough to play in the scenic area for one day, and I will come next time.

msg:In the end of the Tang dynasty, Sina Duoji, a native of Batang, Sichuan, led his tribe to migrate to the depths of the mountains and establish Bala Village. Ba means Batang; La means migration in *******. Everything here is anim, multiplying and transforming into human form. A linden tree at the foot of the mountain occupies the entire cliff, and even more miraculously, he stretched out a hand. There is a mountain at an altitude of 4,200 meters. Its natural form is the same as a pagoda. It should be the same as the Buddha said, "There is a pagoda on the horizon." No relationship. Before 2007, there were no roads and no electricity. If someone got sick, they would mobilize the whole village to carry, carry, and carry, and walk the horse-and-horse post road for five days, five nights and a half-meter to seek medical treatment in the county. There is no such point on the map. It only exists in the language of Shangri-La people to scare the children: "If you cry again, I will throw you to Bala Village!" In 1964, a child named Sina Dingzhu was born in Bala Village. When he was hitting iron at the age of ten, a piece of iron smashed into his left eye. Abba tied his waist with a twine to seek medical advice, but his eyes had missed the treatment time when he arrived at the hospital five days later. God took away one eye of Sina Dingzhu, but let him see the road and the car with the other eye. After adulthood, Sina Dingzhu was quite talented in business, and accumulated wealth in about 20 years. When his assets reached 40 million, he announced an amazing decision: build a road and drive the road to Bala Village. How could this heavenly road be managed by 40 million dollars? The road designer retreated, he insisted; he insisted on changing from a multi-millionaire to a billionaire. It took ten years. In 2008, the road was finally completed and Bala Village appeared on the map; together with the Gezong Snow Mountain, the Bala Gezong Scenic Area was created. Touched by the story of Sinar Dingzhu, the first stop of Shangri-La was in Balagezong. After two days, I felt the staff's admiration for his chairman. Most of them were from Bala Village and students who graduated from Shangri-La Tourism School. They were all attentively serving tourists. The steward of Yongzhong second management arranged the itinerary and car for us, so that we were able to play foolishly in the super-large scenic spot. The best part is that when I got off the car at the pagoda parking lot this morning, there was still half a stupa covered by clouds and fog, but when you walked to the middle of the meadow, the clouds and mists completely dissipated. , The big raindrops fell down. You know, the weather in the deep mountains is useless to look at the APP, only local people can guess. So, if you don't have a high-rebellious friend, come to Balagezong, support Sina Dingzhu's obsession, and feel the beauty of Shambhala's secret realm.

Not long after booking the room, I received a call from the hotel and arranged a transfer. It takes about two hours from the ancient city of Dukezong to the scenic spot. The hotel is responsible for the round trip transfer. From this we can see that the scenic spot and the hotel are full of sincerity. ! I booked the hotel and included the tickets for the scenic spot. We came all the way to the hotel located on the mountainside of the scenic spot. The scenery along the way was beautiful and shocking. When we got off the bus, Xiaohai, the butler, sent us a white Hada, and then led us to check in. We stayed for two nights. , Xiaohai helped us arrange the itinerary for the next two days. We don’t need to worry about it at all. I like Xiaohai! The hotel is located in Bala Village. The staff in the restaurant or the halal restaurant outside the snack bar are very nice. The breakfast in the restaurant, because only free breakfast for two people a night, we had to pay to buy breakfast for the children. The restaurant staff said that we would give us more breakfast at that time, and then we can eat with the children, so there is no need to buy extra , Very considerate, the hotel breakfast is Jiugongge breakfast, very hearty, the rice noodles are delicious. great! The hotel guests specialize in a car to visit various attractions. In the morning we went to Shambhala Stupa. We were lucky to see the whole view of the pagoda. In the afternoon, we went to Shambhala Grand Canyon rafting, echoing wall glass plank road, and the guided tour guide Namu was fun. Humorous, he accompanies us all the way, very nice. The details of the hotel are also done very well. We drank two bottles of mineral water that day, and the next day we found that the staff had provided two more bottles in addition to the mineral water. Thanks to the two drivers who picked us up to the hotel and drove us back to the ancient city. They didn't have time to ask for their names and thank you. The four-hour drive back and forth was also very hard. The general branch, in a word, living in Balagezong Yangxin Manor is great value!

msg:Balagezong is my friend and I travel plan B, I didn't expect to bring surprises directly overtake the rest of Yunnan, really glad I didn't miss this niche tourist attraction. Although the price seemed high, the people who really experienced it knew how much better it was, including two tickets for me and my friend, a pick-up from Shangri-La and a zipline or rafting (which we chose) for 120 yuan. Because we only live for one night and came up later in the day, it is not convenient to go to any attraction, we are worried that long time will not be enough. Thank you very much for the guide Yongzhongci's little brother and arranged it for us clearly. The next day, in order to get to the tower too late to eat breakfast, Yongzhongci guide younger brother also for me drink my friend pack two to take us to eat in the car. Then go to the echo wall and wait for the trip. Because of the time, we can't go with the big group. He also arranged another very good little brother for us alone. He took us down the mountain, and then sent us directly back to Shangri-La. The communication and play along the road are really enjoyable. It's worth mentioning that the bus is so comfortable that it completely changes my opinion of the tour bus, and simply sitting on the bus and walking around the hairpin will definitely make you feel thrilled and worth it (and you will feel safe and comfortable). Yongzhongcili, Tashidler. Balagzong, Tashidler. We remember the summer wind, and also remember the joy of being awkward and serious when you took us to do the Sutra. After that, we will come again many times, with friends, and family ❤️

msg:If so, I want to score six points. The service is warm and thoughtful, and the 5-star room, except for the limited breakfast in the mountains, is understandable. Going into the mountains, the experience of being surrounded by sacred mountains must be one time. The experience of planting grass in a certain airplane magazine two years ago was a worthwhile experience. There is nothing to say about the price, because it includes the tickets for the whole family, and upgraded the suite from the parent-child room, which is more worthwhile than staying outside the scenic spot. It is also a good experience for children to watch the sky full of stars on the roof terrace at night. The high reaction I was worried about in advance was completely overwhelming.

msg:Super awesome, very amazing, the most impressive place in the whole journey. An ancient village castle on a cliff in a canyon. It is the most consistent with my impression of Shangri-La Xanadu. The stunning winding road, 52 hairpin bends, can send you straight to the top of the mountain behind your head. The hotel service is very good, not only can pick up and drop off the ancient city from the airport, but also take you around the canyon almost for free. This experience was great and unique. Thank you butler Yongzhong for his attentive service and his singing is great. The story of Balagezong’s road construction is also touching.

msg:I just want to say that the price doesn't seem to be low, but the price/performance ratio is extremely high. Compared with the hotel at the entrance of the scenic spot, there are more car pick-ups and delivery (the ancient city of Shangri-La or the airport, all the drivers and masters are very nice, have enthusiastic driving skills and good 👍), scenic spot tickets, Shambhala stupa fare, exclusive butler service (this I have to say that the butler Xiaohai’s service is attentive and considerate, with special car pick-up and drop-off of luggage, reasonable arrangement of scenic spots tour planning), as well as zipline or rafting tickets. The key is that there is an invincible view outside the room, which is really worth it 👏👏👏

msg:#此心安处是我家#

The unexpected surprise of Shangri-La's trip came to the mysterious Shambhala secret realm. The hotel is built on the old site of Bala Village, which not only retains the original style, but also integrates modern civilization.

When driving into Balagezong from National Highway 214, I started to marvel all the way. The founder’s ten years of building roads in his hometown add to the mystery of this scenic spot.

When I grew up, I thought that my hometown is a place I can’t go back to. I came here to find out that this peace of mind is my home~

The story here is more worth experiencing than any hardware, service, and catering~

msg:This is a place with a story-Balagezong
Everyone has heard this story: A blacksmith’s son suffered an eye injury when he was a child. Because there was no road in Balagezong, he went out after walking the mountain road for five days, which delayed his son’s condition and his eyes were not healed. Therefore, the eldest son made up his mind to repair the road in his hometown. He went out at the age of 13, and returned to give back to his hometown after he achieved a career. This person is called Sina Dingzhu.

Before, I always thought that Sina Dingzhu was just like the story of Huang Dafa's repairing the canal in Guizhou, the Yu Gong repaired it to benefit everyone. But I didn't expect Sinar Dingzhu to be the boss of this Balagezong scenic spot. He is kind, because he spent several hundred million to repair more than 30 to 40 kilometers of roads, benefiting the entire Balagezong people. He is very far-sighted. Before, the young and middle-aged people of Balagezong had to leave home to work, but he created ecological scenic spots so that everyone can find employment. Now many employees are his villagers. We came all the way, the driver admired and told us how great his boss is. It is really not easy for everyone to admire him. He is also particularly not eager for quick success. There are minerals in Balagezong. He does not agree with mining. He just turns the whole scenic spot into a tourist spot, which can also benefit all generations. After knowing so many stories, this place has become more cultural.

Although it was raining all the time when we came today, it was a bit noisy on the first floor. Everyone likes to live in a quiet room upstairs. Many places have not been there. But along the way, the butler Yongzhong Cili and the driver were very kind. We traveled to such a place, and the butler took the trouble to light up the fire for us and explained. I really appreciate it. The simplicity, piety, and enthusiasm of the people here are really comforting. It made me fall in love with Yunnan even more. When I returned to the hotel to see Gang Rinpoche, I was deeply moved. At the same time, I am also reflecting on myself, why do I care about so many things in many cases and learn from them.

Although I haven't visited many places, I hope that I will have the opportunity to take a look again in the future. I also hope that the business in this place will get better and better, so that good people and bosses can make a lot of money, and I hope everyone here will get better and better.

The scenic spots and hotels may have some imperfections, but when you see the scenery in the canyon, when you understand the story behind this sky road, you will fall in love with everything here, including its imperfections. The staff here are very good. After seeing the skilled driver and the humorous butler, I think the Kangba guy is really handsome, hahaha, commend the wooden butler by name, the guy is very responsible and help us solve all kinds of troubles , I was really touched, and the driver who picked us up was really enthusiastic. There were old people and children in our car, and they were all taken care of very well. A brief and rude summary of the scenic spot and this trip is a worthwhile trip at a glance.

Although the distance is a bit far away, I felt that everything was worth it. The Gesang people are very humorous and interesting. All the way to the pagoda, these guide words are very interesting. xixi There is a driver reception throughout the whole journey.

msg:First of all, it is recommended to live in the scenic area, the hotel has a pick-up service, and the journey takes about two hours. 1⃣️Balagezong Yangxin Bingquan Hotel 2⃣️Balagezong Yangxin Qibla Hotel (I stayed at this hotel, more recommended.)
Secondly, there will be a butler in the hotel, who will praise Namu by name! A boy younger than me, but very experienced, helped me carry my luggage back and forth, and made plans and everything was perfect. In fact, the warm and honest impression of *******s can be seen from Namu and other housekeepers.
🌟Balagezong-Shambhala Stupa: The place where people with strong Buddhist beliefs love to go, the natural stupa, the mountain is 4000+ above sea level, and it takes about forty minutes to go up by the hotel bus. I feel nothing. But my mother and aunt are motion sick~
🌟Balagezong-Grand Canyon: The wooden plank road is not far away, but it’s a bit hot, and you can go rafting. If you book a hotel, you will be sent a rafting or ropeway ticket (choose one)
🌟Balagezong——Echo Wall: I went in the afternoon, it was a bit hot! The glass path did not go over, only to the ropeway. The ropeway is so cool! Don't be afraid, my mother dare to sit!
🌟There is also a museum with a small prayer wheel, you can go in and visit bye bye.
Having said that, staying in a hotel in the scenic spot is really worth it! The fee includes butler service, breakfast🥣, airport pick-up service, tickets to various attractions🎫, etc. Isn't it worth it! There is still a chance to see Galaxy in the evening.
The scenery is really beautiful, admiring the wonderful workmanship of nature.
Finally, you must Baidu Mr. Sina Dingzhu before you go. It's so great, how can you not admire a person who makes contributions to his hometown. I ran into him on the last day and took a photo with him. He was very enthusiastic and did not put on airs at all. The ******* people in Bala Village admire him.

The standard of the restaurant’s dishes is also very high. Butler Namu, meal shuttle, etc. will promptly remind and give very good suggestions. There are old people who are also accompanied to play, hardworking and friendly, which can be called the representative of the new generation of ******* young people. With such employees, Balagezong The scenic spot will definitely become more and more prosperous. At the same time, I would like to pay tribute to the road builder and guide Sina Dingzhu!

msg:The best experience of this trip to Yunnan was in Balagezong. Because June is the rainy season, I did not choose to go to Meili Snow Mountain. Confirmed with the hotel before booking, booking with Ctrip can include round-trip shuttle service. We are about 2 hours drive from Songzan Linka. The scenery along the way is great, first arrive at the ticket office of the scenic spot, exchange tickets according to the order, and then pass the ticket gate and then have a hotel car to pick us up the mountain. The little brother who stayed at the front desk was very enthusiastic, and because he only stayed for one night, there would be some activities to give up. We went to the glass path that day, the Shambhala Pagoda the next morning, and then went to rafting. I will definitely stay for two nights next time, slow down to experience the scenery here, one day is still too rush. The whole arrangement is very considerate and the connection is very good, so you don't have to worry about it at all.
The scenery and the story behind the scenic spot are quite shocking and moving. In fact, none of the photos show the beauty of Balagezong. It is really a place that you have to come to feel in person.

酒店肯定不能和五星級酒店相提並論，3-4星吧。但這都不重要，依然是巴拉村最好的酒店了。送兩人門票，摺合下來，酒店還是性價比很高的，還給升級了套房，很大，晚上很安靜，早上不出門就可以看到日照金山。
總體評價“可”

巴拉格宗景區是香格里拉的祕境，落差超過2000米的立體景觀帶來視覺沖擊，清澈溪流，蜿蜒棧道，髮卡彎山路移“車”換景，古老村落，獵獵經幡，裊裊桑煙，聖潔雪山，自由雲朵，深邃星空……
第2次入住懸崖神蹟酒店，推薦選擇機場到酒店全程接送機，據説香格里拉市區其他地方也可以選擇接送機，無縫對接，極大提高了時效和舒適度。懸崖神蹟酒店建在巴拉村原址，和村子渾然一體，有咖啡店，奶茶店，書社，音樂吧，餐廳等配套設施。客房面向峽谷和雪山，接近360度大氣磅礴的美景令人震撼，不親臨無法用語言描述。歡迎禮有藏式風情，因為是第2次來，還特意上網查瞭如何有禮貌的接哈達，藏族小夥子和姑娘禮貌，親切，妥帖，讓人倍感温馨。第2天去4250米佛塔，有些高反，管家還讓廚房特別準備了紅糖薑湯荷包蛋，去過香格里拉N多其他景區，這裏算是服務屆天花板了，是顧客服務，更是他們對別人的真誠善良具化到每件事。

msg:巴拉格宗，香格里拉最後的祕境，神仙居住的地方。懸崖神蹟是雲南之行最滿意最推薦的酒店，如果時間允許，真想再多住幾天。房間很大很寬敞，雖然酒店建在懸崖之上，但配備的設施非常完善，雖然費用看起來小貴，但真的性價比無敵，包含了接送費用、住宿費用、早餐，以及景區幾乎全部費用，甚至可以説，訂了酒店住宿，景區幾乎隨便玩。並且有一對一管家幫忙規劃行程，管家一諾非常負責，人也很好很幽默，幫我們制定好景區遊覽路線以及專車接送。起初還擔心景區裏沒有外賣和美食，到了才明白根本無需外賣，無論餐廳、油茶店、咖啡館，各個菜品都不會踩雷，工作人員都熱情滿滿，讓我們深深感受到藏族人民的淳樸與友善，且日常生活用品幾乎應有盡有，看得出酒店工作人員對酒店、對顧客都是像對家、對家人般的用心。晚餐用畢大家還在餐廳門口舉行了篝火晚會，一起跳舞，真的很開心。再來香格里拉，一定會來巴拉格宗，再來巴拉格宗，一定仍然會選擇懸崖神蹟！

另附朋友巴拉格宗遊後感：
巴拉格宗，是我旅途中最難忘、最深刻的一個地方，它給我講了個“愚公移山”的故事。
斯那定珠——用自己的力量在地圖上畫上了自己的故鄉。小時候的一個偶然機會，讓他從香格里拉最深處，一個無人知曉的祕境裏，用5天時間走入“另一個世界”——那個我們熟知的、可能已經厭倦了的世界。斯那定珠第一次看到了電燈、汽車……琳琅滿目的新鮮事物映入眼簾。斯那定珠那一晚如何也無法入睡，跟阿爸説，長大了以後要修路，要走出去…13歲，此後在上海摸爬滾打20年…小有積蓄的他本可以過上安穩幸福的生活，但他不忘初心，決定用手頭的三四千萬開始為家鄉鋪路。有好幾次資金全部用完了，他便出售不動資產：售賣房子、車子、五金店、羊肉火鍋店等等。當然最難的不是資金問題，也不是在陡峭的山上如何修路的問題，而是他同村民説修路的提議時，有很多人不支持甚至反對此事，這讓他難以理解，因為村裡如果有人病了，需要村裡強壯的康巴漢子輪換抬擔架走上5天的山路去縣裡看病，5天時間…病了的人，會如何呢？ 
斯那定珠花了10年時間，在陡峭的山體上修建了52道髮卡彎，在地圖上補缺了從前無人知曉的香格里拉中最神祕的巴拉格宗——他的家鄉。
都説香格里拉是最接近天堂的地方，那麼巴拉格宗可能更加接近天堂，青山綠水，最自然的環境、最淳樸的人。
我諮詢了那裡的工作人員，工作人員跟我講，其實斯那定珠非常焦慮。之前並沒有想開設景點，衹是想給村民提供方便。現在開設景點確實能帶來收益，讓村民的收入成倍上漲，可是知曉這個地方的人終歸是少之又少，導致入不敷出。就算如此，斯那定珠還是不忘用自己的積蓄給村民添置汽車、房子……
我在致旅客的一封信上看到了這樣一句話：這裏的工作人員都是我的親人，都是這個村子裏的村民，他們雖然學歷不高，但內心是淳樸善良和熱情真誠的，期待他們的服務會讓您記住香格里拉有一個叫巴拉格宗的地方………
這些的這些都讓我感動不已，讓我永生難忘。也許這就是旅途的意義吧。

酒店對面的餐廳，光看單價覺偏高（原純粹以為山裡東西貴）但份量是真的實在，基本都是滿盤的，紅燒肉就是純肉，沒有土豆紅蘿蔔啥的充數！人多的話，強烈推薦炒菜，我們8個人，6個菜吃不完！味道也非常好！（火鍋吃怕了）

最為人詬病的一點就是景點多分散，且都是一次性的，景點參觀有時效性。碰到下雨沒有按照管家規劃的路線就不太可能給你第二次機會遊玩參觀。我們碰到下雨一下午沒去巴拉格村就沒時間給我們去了，説是安排了車送走了要。遊玩時間衹能憑管家安排，這點不太爽。

設施在山區真的算不錯，洗澡水很舒服。
房型還給了升級套房，景觀很好，剛剛可以看見山谷。
套餐包含香格里拉市區接送（兩個小時車程），門票，免費漂流或高空索道一次，玻璃棧道。
漂流的水很漂亮也很涼快..景觀也美。
工作人員都很友好，還有專門的電瓶車可以到景點。
很適合住一晚，其實算下來比跟團遊划算。
貌似裏面一共有三家酒店，兩個比較高檔，一個比較普通在山腳。
希望我的點評能幫助大家。

msg:結論先行：非常超值的體驗，套票和酒店住宿加起來的價格在旺季很值得！服務衞生和景色都很好，衹有設施稍微弱一點。

交通：上去酒店比較艱難，停車方便。但如果你讀了酒店裡麪關於該景點的建設背景介紹相信你會有不同的理解。（賣個關子）


服務：巨好！包括村口小賣部的人都會對你笑臉相迎。完虐希爾頓好吧。


環境：出門即是景。房間內部裝潢為藏式，深色木頭為主。

設施：淋浴間部分有漏水情況，會漏到隔壁廁所。且空調排水直接排到洗漱間地板，容易滑倒，建議加個延長管道。

plus：早餐可以。有肉有菜，營養均衡，還有藏式糌粑可以吃。

msg:酒店位置很不錯，在景區裏面，自駕遊可以開車進來，沒車也能讓管家聯繫接送…疫情人少，免費升級了小黃鴨親子房，帶一個大露台，可以看到對面格宗雪山，有幸看到了日照金山，建議天氣預報寫晴天少雲的情況下一定要定這裏，很大概率看到日照金山，太美了…景區最美得還是佛塔。75元每個人的額外接送費，很值，當然定這個房間也送了……再者就是玻璃棧道和大峽谷，峽谷建議走上去，漂流下來…定的酒店套餐送了一個漂流，又買了一位，120元一張，兩位工作人員划槳帶我們一路下來，很安全的

msg:去巴拉格宗住不住一晚，那是完全不同的感受。管家一諾終點表揚，安排的明明白白。山上景色秀麗，住在酒店可以吃過早飯就進山遊玩，比絕大多數的自駕行以及團隊客人都要早。第一波看到佛塔的客人都是住店客人。其實房費包含了門票以及高空滑索或者峽谷漂流，這讓性價比飆升。

很值得來不要因為山路就望而卻步。
索道一點兒也不難受，失重感幾乎為零，可以試着突破自己。
房間內部很乾凈，帶着一次性的四件套也沒用上，空調加濕器和電暖氣應有盡有。

       作為此次出行前唯一預訂好的酒店，我們對巴拉格宗尤為期待！當我們延着麗江省道一個轉彎前往巴拉格宗景區，突然眼前一亮！高聳的峭壁，一條蜿蜒清澈的溪流，彷佛把我們帶入了世外桃源，駛入景區的路程很長，這條小溪一直伴隨着我們，時左時右，一時間竟忘了我們還沒在景區內。經過無數個彎，我們也很緊張，畢竟從未開過山路，最終好不容易開到了酒店，衹有一句話：不虛此行！
        酒店位於巴拉宗格的巴拉村，管家扎西熱情的迎了上來，給我們帶了哈達，還特意為我們升級了房間。房間視野無敵好，窗外就是雪山，令人心曠神怡。下午扎西還帶我們參觀了卓瑪拉康和迴音壁，一路上詳細和生動地介紹了巴拉村以及藏族的歷史和文化！
          讓我們尤為驚喜的是，第二天早上拉開窗簾，一道陽光灑在了雪山上，日照金山的壯觀景色！此行的另外一個收穫便是晚上天空閃亮的星星，讓我們覺得與星星的距離是那麼得近。想要來巴拉格宗體驗的遊客一定要來此住上1-2晚！

如果要來巴拉格宗，強烈推薦要在這裏住一晚，欣賞一次巴拉村的星空，在晴好的夜晚，可以看見銀河，無法用言語形容的浪漫和真實，早上拉開窗簾即可望見神山日出。
而且住在酒店可以在第二天一早就安排去香巴拉佛塔，比起住景區門口不僅節約時間，更重要的是減少海拔落差巨大造成的不適。

酒店就在景區的中心位置，坐着旅遊大巴就可以到酒店門口，非常友好。
景區遊玩全程都有特別熱情貼心的旅行管家幫忙介紹和接送，會根據你的時間幫你設計好行程，關鍵是服務真的好好，路上遇到所有的景區工作人員都會跟你熱情問好打招呼，心情特別好。
遇到了景區多年不遇的大雪，酒店的小院子就很美。
唯一説缺點的話房間裏面的床單被單等等略微顯舊了，硬件上略顯不足，但是其他真的都很棒，瑕不掩瑜。

車剛到酒店。管家格桑小哥哥就獻上了潔白的哈達。然後帶着辦入住還免費升級了房型。幫我搬行李。還介紹了酒店周邊的吃的。下午的行程也都是格桑小哥哥帶着去玩去參觀。不得不説酒店的附加福利還是很多。免了門票還送了漂流/滑索二選一的體驗券。房間裏還有經幡可以體驗下掛經幡的感覺。一路上格桑小哥哥給我講了超多藏族這邊的風土人情。重點表揚下管家格桑小哥哥！！加雞腿！！回去的路上酒店也安排了司機師傅送我到後面的酒店。還帶我看了他們村裡之前的人馬驛道。希望這麼好的景區和酒店能夠被更多人知道。

msg:非常難忘的巴拉格宗之旅，強烈推薦
香格里拉大峽谷深處的千年古村-巴拉村，雲霧中時隱時現的神山格宗雪山，神奇的香巴拉佛塔，幽深水清的香格里拉大峽谷，懸崖上修成的天路及52個髮卡彎，深山中的杜鵑花和藏獼猴，一切都讓人沉浸其中驚艷不已。更令人動容淚流的是，瞭解並非常幸運地見到了把這一切美好帶給世人，令人肅然起敬的人物~斯那定珠先生。酒店的服務非常棒，淳樸的村民友好熱情。特別謝謝我們的管家小海。年輕幽默的那木管家有着與年齡不符的老練成熟和智慧，一路的講解和同行妙趣橫生。盛夏夜晚峻嶺之顛習習涼風中漫天繁星閃爍是深留記憶中的美好。希望再去小住幾日，再次感受那世外桃源般的寧靜與祥和。

景區內的酒店包含景區門票還送了一張漂流的券，在此也要謝謝酒店管家那木弟弟，講解的非常仔細到位，有問必答，還風趣幽默，點贊👍 還帶我們一起玩了兩個半天，感覺服務很到位超值的。
這次時間比較緊衹住了一個晚上，有機會會再來嘗試在山區裏進行徒步。
另外值得説一下：景區內山路都是髮卡路，感覺自己開車會比較緊張，入住酒店後是坐的酒店安排的大巴車進行的遊玩，感覺很貼心。

酒店設施很好！很新！開窗即景，地暖很舒服，我們的套房太寬敞了，兩間卧室，中間有一個很長的衣櫥作分隔，兩個獨立衞浴，乾濕分離，實在太奢華了🤩🤪而且餐廳做的食物很美味！苦瓜炒蛋讓我們念念不忘到今天👍👍👍感謝管家格桑，服務很貼心。
最感人的是巴拉格宗的“天路”，和斯那定珠的傳奇人生。我一定會再來，帶孩子一起來。

去巴拉格宗強烈推薦在雪山朝拜或者雪山冰泉莊園住一晚，酒店+門票+導遊+接送一價全包，省心省力體驗好，超值！
