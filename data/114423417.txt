The housekeeper Xiao Shi added WeChat as soon as possible, and the battery car picked us up. I checked in and checked out in the room, which was very convenient. I didn't have to wait in the lobby. I also took a hot spring bath in the evening, which was quiet and comfortable. I can take my children to experience it again during the summer vacation.

It feels like they are really attentive. By the way, the hot spring is good. The procedures are not as troublesome as other hot spring hotels. It is very simple. The villa has 4 floors, 3 floors above ground and 1 floor underground. The best thing is that there is an elevator.

msg:The hotel is very good in terms of environment, hygiene, service, etc. After booking the room, the housekeeper added WeChat to inform us of some precautions and inquire about our needs. Because there was noise in the surrounding area, we specially upgraded the three-room room we booked to a four-room room so as not to affect our rest. Usually, all the reservations are super luxurious five-star hotels in various tourist cities. The following points are what I think are the outstanding services of Xianjuyuan: 1. After checking in, a service group specifically for our family was established. As of the time of leaving the store, there were 25 service staff in the store, and any questions were responded to in a timely manner. 2. On the day of check-in, three or four well-dressed and uniform beautiful waiters were waiting early at the door of the hotel, giving people the first impression of enthusiasm and professionalism. 3. The morning greetings of the group every day are very warm. On the second day of check-in, our breakfast time was late. The housekeeper was worried that we would not be able to catch up during the closing time and sent WeChat greetings. 4. When we left the hotel, the heads of relevant depar**ents lined up to see us off and gave us small gifts. In addition, the bedding and pillows are very comfortable. I have problems with my cervical spine. Other hotels must change to buckwheat pillows. I sleep very comfortably with the pillows of Xianjuyuan. The breakfast is also delicious and tastes very authentic. In short, if there are any travel arrangements in Lintong, Xianjuyuan will definitely be my first choice. Thanks to Wang Xiaoke and other service staff in the service team for letting us spend a perfect holiday. nice

Andy, the guest service manager, contacted us in advance to introduce the room, asked about our needs after check-in, and helped us make arrangements in advance. The service of Miss COCO at the front desk was very professional, enthusiastic and attentive, and there was a dedicated service team to provide us with services. No matter what needs we had, they could be handled in the first time. Traveling in the park is convenient, and there will be a shuttle bus to pick you up at any time.

I am very grateful to Xiao Li from the guest service depar**ent for her enthusiastic service. She patiently answered all the inquiries. Later, the guest service manager contacted us to ask what time we would arrive at the store and if we had any special needs. She was waiting at the door long ago when we arrived. After we checked in, the lady at the front desk added WeChat to provide us with one-to-one service. If we had any needs, we could send messages in the group at any time and they would respond. The service was really considerate. The battery car pick-up to other areas was also very timely. I originally chose this place temporarily this time. It really touched me so much. I recommend it again. I will come again next time if I need it [grin]

It's so beautiful, so clean, and so stylish. The next is the meticulous service, which can be called first-class service and decoration. The breakfast buffet is rich and varied. We are also tourists who love to travel. We have been to many cities across the country and stayed in many five-star hotels. To be honest, this hotel is a particularly good hotel in terms of hotel facilities, decoration, and service. This stay has given us eternal memories of studying abroad in the 2024 Spring Festival! In the future, we will choose your Lintong Xianjuyuan to stay, and we will continue to pay attention to your hotel! Once again, thank all the service staff of your Xianjuyuan hotel for their warm service, and especially thank Wang Chao for his personal arrangements from beginning to end, until check-in to check-out. Thank you! [Rose][Rose][Rose][Rose][Rose]

msg:It was a great stay. The most profound feeling was that the hotel's housekeeper team had a very high comprehensive quality. A service WeChat group was set up for each guest staying in the hotel, creating a very comfortable and friendly environment for the guests, so that the guests could feel what it was like to be at home.
The hotel's location is really a highlight. It takes 5 minutes by taxi from Huaqing Palace to 1.5 kilometers away. The transportation to the west line of Xi'an, such as Terracotta Warriors, Huaqing Palace, and Song of Everlasting Regret, is very convenient.
The hotel room is very spacious, exquisitely decorated and comfortable. The room facilities are very complete, including high-quality bedding, and every detail reflects the hotel's care and concern for the guests.
In addition, the hotel's security facilities also impressed me. The hotel's security measures are very strict, which made me feel very safe during my stay.
In short, whether in terms of service, facilities, environment or location, I feel that it is worth the money. Highly recommended!

There is no problem for 10 people to stay. There are also many snacks in the room. What can be improved is the pillow, which is a bit too soft and thick. It is recommended to change a thick pillow to a solid thin pillow. In addition, the room is prone to damp smell, and it is recommended to ventilate it in the off-season. The overall room hard decoration is in place. It is hoped that a separate hot spring area will be added in the villa area to make it more beautiful. You can get coupons to play the carousel in the Aegean Sea next door, and you can also take your children to ride the train for free.

Each building has basically 4 floors. The first floor below is the entertainment, fitness, SPA, theater space, and 1-3 are four guest rooms, equipped with a bathroom for 1-2 people. There is really nothing that can be said about the butler service, service and environment! The service can be said to be super five-star, super VIP service, especially from breakfast to dinner, afternoon tea, and hot springs, no one was left behind. The butler spoiled me everywhere, and I was a bit reluctant to leave! Happy time is always short. Before leaving, the butler also gave us a beautiful tea set. I really loved it! I will choose this place again for my next family gathering!

It's actually better than the photos, very spacious, bright, clean and tidy. The guest service manager COCO kept an eye on us before arriving at the store. When we were almost there, she said she would be waiting for us at the door.
There is a shuttle bus with the concierge when you arrive at the store, and he is always at your call during your stay. Bringing afternoon tea☕️dinner is also very nice, and the hot spring♨️is also a different experience...
The housekeeper had prepared everything needed, and the temperature in the room was just right. It was obvious that the staff had put a lot of thought into it.
All in all, I sincerely praise the perfect experience from the pre-trip service manager to check-in😘
By the way, I left on the first day of the new year with the blessings of the staff. I felt like I was being pampered by my family, full of love❤️ I will definitely stay here again when I come to Xi'an again!
