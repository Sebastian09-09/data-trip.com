msg:it was good for having a relaxing time and getting out of the city but not too far from it. very accessible now as it is only about 1 km from the subway station, too bad it is a very lean season so the hotel was really quite, no breakfast buffet offered at the time I stayed but I had a wonderful brunch at Royal Restaurant, the Chinese dim-sum buffet resto at the hotel, delicious food and had a good offer too at only 99 rmb. although the hotel is niw a bit old as it used to be Sofitel Sheshan, I bet this place is busy during summer since there is a big pool outside and beautiful garden too. Thanks for the friend staff Sue and Bill.

I personally thought it was ok, pool not deep enough for them to swim, but great depth for them to play and had a slight! Indoor Playground much too expensive, but the Service and look after the kids and choice to play were excellent! All in all I only can say, Happy kids, Happy parents! I plan to stay there again, just for the kids.

msg:The facilities are nice enough. The pools are pretty much the biggest selling point along with how nice the rooms are. We stayed in a luxury room with a balcony on the second floor not overlooking the pool so it was nice and quiet and we had a place to dry our swimwear quickly.

Go into it expecting a 3-star experience and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The price point is about 4-star with a good deal/sale.

Overall we did have a pleasant time! My biggest complaints were that there are only 3 restaurants and they charge 10x the price for a coke. There is only one vending machine with reasonable prices on a few snacks, sodas, and beers. The outdoor pools are also quite dirty. 

Basically bring your own food (they have good mini-fridges and Eleme apparently delivers out there) and take advantage of the nice bath tubs after a swim. Me and my infant son sure did!

Breakfast buffet is also really good, but a bit pricey.

msg:Good things first: First of all my daughter is 7 years old and was happy. This is important to me. The hotel offers a lot of activities and has a nice facility for little kids. Outdoor pool, kids club, and other activities but of course everything to be paid extra.

I understand that it‚Äôs high season now. But still from a service, food and cleanliness standard the hotel is far away to be called a 5 star hotel. Considering Sofitel as a top premium brand for Accor then this hotel must be a big embarrassment for the quality manager of the hotel. We booked the Millesime club room. People had not much clue on upscale service - for example which glass to use for which drinks, they spoke very little English (I.e. couldn‚Äôt tell the guest where the egg station is or asked what do you need - to come across as impolite). The products used are the cheapest that you can find (cold cuts, cheeses, wines). There is no innovation when it comes to the food offered for breakfast- the same items on both days. The service was okay or even good on the locations where the hotel can make extra money. This is in the restaurant for booking the dinner buffet and in the kids club playground. But people lack big time training in the areas that is included in the price such as the gym, the lounge or the reception. The changing areas in the gymnasium was properly the worst I have ever seen. I wanted to go for an early swim and workout around 7.30 am and expected that it was cleaned by then. But to my surprise the floor was full of sand, there is a lot of water damages, it stinks in there. I even found a cigarette on the floor! Honestly it was disgusting. The hotel has a nice outdoor swimming pool but does not offer slippers in the room. Instead they offered some socks to walk in the pool? A bit surprising. My overall judgment is that the owner of the hotel is trying to make money without investment in people, their training, hygiene with its proper use on chemicals, as well as some quality products. The picture shows the coffee cup they gave me to drink the soda water in the club lounge üòä

Breakfast buffet (including Western style) was great. One minor criticism was that there was no tea or coffee in the room, though there was a kettle! Perhaps that was a mistake? I would certainly stay again!

The Indoor swimming pool is out of service and the AC in the room is not working. It‚Äôs very hard to get a cup of coffee even after a kind waitress walks up to you and offers and then disappears. I usually wait until after checkout to write my reviews but this short stay at Sofitel Sheshan is a big disappointment for its poor standard. Service are kind and speak English and although the hotel is a little distant, it‚Äôs a nice area to get away from the hustle of the city life.

The indoor playground is also great and our 3 kids (ages 5, 7, 9) though a little old and dingy. The breakfast was good. Our room was spacious, and they gave us a free extra bed.

The bad: most of the staff were friendly, but a few were not very helpful. They at first told us we had to pay extra to swim in the pool even though we were paying hotel guests (thankfully a manager came and fixed that situation). The carpet in our room was old and stained and the room smelled like old, damp carpet. They gave us an air purifier to help with the smell. Also, our room on the sixth floor was quite hot and never cooled off very much, even with the air conditioner on high. I don't know if lower floors were cooler. The locker room is also quite old and dated and doesn't even have a spinner to spin the water off your swimsuit.

I was laying on bed for 2 days, throwing up and sweating. The room was quite dirty and needs renovation. At least my wife and son could enjoyed the outdoor swimming pool. Lucky it was only me who got sick. I guess it was the sushi or the meat (chicken or beef) because these are the only two things my wife and son didn‚Äôt try and I did. As it is understandable I don‚Äôt recommend to stay in this hotel. Very bad experience.

The tickets for Dreamland are included in the pre-booked package, and the children played there for a while, which is similar to most children's parks in shopping malls outside.
Perhaps due to the small number of guests, breakfast on the first day was not a buffet, but a la carte meal. On the second day, there is some self-service and some ordering. The buffet breakfast I usually eat always feels a bit worse.

Buffet dinner for 2 adults and 1 child: This is the key point. I bought a buffet and room package. The price of the buffet hotel is 328 per person during the Chinese New Year. First, the entrance attendant requires children to pay half price for children's tickets. According to the purchase instructions, children under 1.5 meters are counted as adult tickets. We If the child is less than 1.5 meters tall, he asked me to pay half the price. Children refer to children under 1.2 meters tall. Children under 1.2 meters tall are free. Even if I give birth to two children less than 1.2 meters tall, you still have to let me in, right? I think the buffet for 2 adults and 1 child includes half-price for children. There is no problem in paying half-price if they are taller than 1.5 meters. I almost went around and didn't pay half-price to get in. Besides, the buffet, in addition to beef and mutton rolls with synthetic meat, is just vegetarian dishes and a few flour balls. I asked for the sales of a Jiugongge seafood platter. Children were not counted and were charged half the price. In the platter for 2 people, 1 hairy crab was cut in half, 4 octopus tentacles, 4 swallow dumplings, and 2 abalones. There are 4 tripes, 4 squid slices, about 6 tendons, and 2 prawns. The 328 buffet has no sashimi and nothing else. It only has beef, mutton and a pre-made seafood platter. It is not as good as the hot pot buffet bullfrog on the market for less than 100. You can eat unlimited hand-cut beef and mutton as you like. If you want to take your kids to play later, you can buy a tour package and go out to the buffet for dinner.
Children's breakfast buffet: Breakfast is a little better than dinner...

It came with a lot of entertainment activities, but I couldn't enjoy it, which put the original swimming plan on hold. The variety and style of breakfast are also good. I will come again next time.

msg:The hotel's hardware facilities are indeed old, but the lobby manager's service is indeed excellent.
The hotel is located in the Sheshan Resort, not far from the surrounding tourist attractions, ancient towns and amu*****t parks. It was called Sofitel when I was here last time. For a hotel that has been open for nearly 15 years, the maintenance of the facilities can only be said to be so-so. The quality of some supplies has also plummeted, such as slippers, which are directly comparable to the standards of Home Inn and Hanting. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are as thin as a cicada. Not only are they poor in comfort, there are raised areas in the bathroom and it is easy to fall. This kind of The cost cannot be saved!
The hotel is positioned as a parent-child hotel, with horse riding, archery and skiing also quite unique, but there are still gaps in the facilities. For example, there is no guide map, and all children's activities have to be asked verbally, which creates a poor experience. I purchased an entertainment package, but many external activities were not self-operated and were not connected to the hotel's system. It took a lot of time to check the information.
Finally, I am very grateful to the two managers on duty on Saturday and Sunday. They proactively handled problems encountered, were enthusiastic, and provided professional service. Five-star praise!

msg:It looks like a great hotel from the photos, but the reality is very different from that. In general aspects, it is abandoned, poorly maintained and dirty. The most frequent spaces such as the outdoor pool are not enjoyed for all the above reasons.

I did archery, and although it was fun, it is designed for children, so it is very small.

As for the food, I do not recommend it at all, the cleaning conditions are very poor, the menu is very limited, and the Buffet looks like it is from a hotel that is a fifth of what this one costs. In my case, the food my partner ordered was spoiled, and it made her sick.

When I went, there was staff who spoke Spanish, so I give it a positive point there.

The room is the best part of the hotel, it is the only reason why I do not put the entire score at 1, since the balcony is nice, the room is spacious, but the bed sheets were dirty and had an old smell.

Taking all this into account, there are many better options in Songjiang to spend the weekend. It is a hotel that is too expensive for what it offers.

The facilities are a bit old, but it can still be seen that they were quite luxurious when they were first built. The outdoor swimming pool is super comfortable. My child was too young and refused to go into the water so he sat on the beach digging in the sand. The adults could finally lie down and bask in the sun. The breakfast could be improved. For a hotel that focuses on families, there is nothing for children to eat. It is recommended to add some healthy food such as grilled corn, steamed purple sweet potato, etc. We will come back when the children are older and can play with water.

Parking is easy and free.

The waiters in the lobby bar are very nice.

The breakfast buffet was also pretty good.

Nice indoor swimming pool

Bad service review: I booked a double bed room when I checked in. When I got to the room, I was given a twin bed room. The front desk confirmed that I was given the wrong room, and then specifically told me to change it to the same floor because the room I was given was very close to the back and there was a carpet in the corridor. It was very inconvenient. I had to change rooms to a room on a different floor that was far away from the elevator. The card-sending aunt does not provide the service of helping to change rooms. A far cry from the service a hotel should have!
Bad review of the facilities: I barely managed to sleep in the room. The big bed has two single mattresses with a big gap in the middle. If you sleep on both sides, roll to the middle. If you sleep in the middle, you will fall into the gap again. It is very uncomfortable and dizzy. of a night. If the bed is not good, what will happen no matter how good the environment is?

Because it is by the pool, you can enter the water play area by opening the balcony door. I imagined it would be a great scene in summer. Now, although the weather is too cold and it is difficult to go into the water, the children still have fun with a water gun!

Another thing to praise is that the pressure of the bath water is very strong and the shower is very comfortable!

The service of this waiter and the outdoor swimming pool must be praised!
But the guest room is really hard to describe, the facilities are old, the glass is broken, the carpet is stained, the balcony has cigarette ashes from previous guests, not to mention the overhead shower in the bathroom, it will spray everywhere .
There are not many choices for breakfast and the lighting is very dim.
But the service of the restaurant waiters and lobby waiters is very good.

msg:This is my second time to play here after the epidemic. I originally wanted to catch up with the little tail of summer and take my two children to play in the water again. Unexpectedly, the weather was not good. It rained for two days. I had no choice but to drink in the outdoor swimming pool and say 88, 3 The 2-day itinerary has been changed to an indoor tour.
On the afternoon of the first day, I went to the hotel to get my room card and took my baby to the children's paradise for two hours to fully discharge my energy. Then I went to Wang Ting Hotel for dinner. The service in the restaurant was very good. After dinner, my baby strongly requested to go to the children's paradise. Played until the end of business at 8 o'clock.
The kids got up early the next day, had breakfast first, and then rested for a while before moving to the indoor swimming pool. The water temperature in the indoor swimming pool was still a bit cold, and the doll pool was not too hot. After playing for a while, we went up to experience it. I paid NT$99 for a buffet in a Chinese restaurant. I can only say that the price/performance ratio is good. It‚Äôs convenient to bring a baby. After lunch, I went to hang the baby. I knew I couldn‚Äôt hang it up, but I still had to give it a try. Then I went to the beach to dig sand. After digging the sand, I took the baby to take a nap. After the nap, I thought if the rain would stop, I could go to the outdoor pool to play, but it still didn't work. Finally, I went to ride a 4-person bicycle. After 20 minutes, I couldn't ride anymore, so I continued indoors. In the swimming pool, after swimming, I had to take out dinner for dinner. I would like to thank Master Li from the concierge for helping me get takeout because I had a child. In the evening, I went to the lobby bar and ordered cakeüç∞ and drank watermelon juice. It was wonderful. The day is over.
On the third day, it finally stopped raining, so we had to check out. We took the kids to have breakfast, then went to the outdoor swimming pool to discharge some electricity. After playing and taking a shower, we took the kids home.
All in all, the itinerary was full for three days and two nights. It was a much better experience than the first time after the epidemic. I will come again in the future.

Last year, I took my baby to another popular parent-child hotel in Sheshan. This year I wanted to change the experience, so I took a fancy to Sheshan Hanyue Pavilion, the Sofitel in my impression.
The hotel lobby is very grand. The hotel has been around for a long time, so the room facilities are relatively old, but the advantage is that the area is large, which is very friendly to families with parents and children who bring a lot of "luggage". It is even more ideal if there is a shelter for the toilet point in the room.
The best thing about the hotel is the outdoor swimming pool and the beach, which are especially popular with children. There are two types of water slides, and the beach is next to the swimming pool. Children enjoy digging and swimming in the sand. Although the outdoor swimming pool is next to the beach, the water in the pool is very clean, because the staff In addition to disposing of the poolside sand after the pool is closed every day, you can also see them cleaning up in the morning, and you can also see them cleaning up in time during use. This is a good management! Try the pool room next time.
In addition, the hotel check-in is free to upgrade the room type. The hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast has a variety of varieties. You can drink Heineken canned beer and bottled red wine at the buffet dinner. The dessert cakes in the buffet are praised by family members.

On the north side of the building are the main two beach swimming pools, on the east side there is a baby pool with a small slide seesaw and an indoor pool (not big), and on the west side there is a swimming pool with a large slide. To go to the beach pool, you need to register your room number, rent beach socks for free and return them, and provide free bath towels. The inflatable boat charges 100 yuan for half an hour. The room is spacious and well-designed. Although the decoration is a bit old, it does not affect the use. All rooms have balconies, and you can see the swimming pool facing north or south. There are facilities for drying clothes on the walls of the open-air balconies. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and a bowl of red noodle soup is recommended. The museum is outsourced, and you have to pay extra to go in. There are fewer people playing horseback riding, archery and skiing.

The first reply was: The takeaway table photographed by the rider is not this hotel. We bought the Qi Wang in the middle bag. Open your eyes and look at the address of the takeaway orders of other guests below. There is no wrong delivery at all. This is the first time to shirk responsibility.
The second time, after retrieving the surveillance, the text message sent to me is as shown in Figure 1. It means that it is impossible to confirm whether the takeaway driver has been to the hotel, and shirk responsibility again, putting all the responsibility on the takeaway driver for delivering to the wrong place. The takeaway guy worked very hard that night. He heard that our takeaway was lost and returned to the hotel to find the takeaway he delivered to us. However, the hotel just shirked responsibility, had no responsibility, no service, and no subsequent remedial measures. It kept saying that it would call the police. Let the police solve everything, then where is the service of your hotel? We come here for leisure and entertainment, not to be bullied.
It is recommended that guests go down and get it immediately after ordering takeaway, and don't have any hope for the hotel's surveillance and service.

msg:The ceiling of the outdoor swimming pool in Shanghai in summer, when you check in on Friday, there are not many people, the hotel front desk upgrades to a pool view room for free. The room directly looks at the swimming pool downstairs, and you can see that the swimming pool is very large. The room generally has a sense of age, but it can be seen that the hotel is well maintained. What is the normal use of the faucet? The hardware is a bit lacking, but the software is perfect. The service is friendly and the food is delicious and varied. The most important thing is the perfect score for the swimming pool. The pools are huge and many, and the water quality is very good. Some pools have few people, and one person can enjoy a pool. There are not enough fried buns for breakfast. I kept CDs, but I didn't eat them. They looked delicious. Hash browns taste good.

It's just that there is a mobile phone shelf missing in the bathroom, which is a bit inconvenient

When I came to live before, there were a lot of kids during the summer holidays. This time, it‚Äôs probably not yet the peak of the summer holidays. Check-in was very fast. As soon as you entered the room, the kids couldn‚Äôt wait to change their clothes and play in the pool. It‚Äôs like a private room .
Later, it moved to the beach, where all the little friends gathered, and it was very lively, digging sand and playing water slides, until it was almost six o'clock to pack up the stalls and go back to the room, and continue to play by the pool.
When I got back to the room, I found that the hotel sent afternoon tea snacks and fruits, which was great~ There were bathrobes and toiletries for my little friend in the room, which was very considerate~ Unfortunately, it was raining the next day, so I had to sleep until I woke up naturally before going to the restaurant. Had a breakfast, the little friend who always had a bird's stomach for breakfast ate a lot, and said that he would come again next time

The water is clear and coconut green. You can spend a Sanya-style holiday without leaving Shanghai. There is a special children's pool with slides inside , seesaw and other recreational facilities.
The quality of the guests is also very high. The children are very polite and warm. The baby soon played with other children, digging sand, swimming and fighting in water. It was a joy.
The room supplies are well prepared, including children's small-sized bathrobes and slippers, and children's toiletries. The pool view room can see the beach swimming pool, which is very Sanya haha.
During the stay, I had dinner at the Japanese restaurant Blue. The sizzling lamb chops were tender and juicy, which was impressive. The buffet in the morning is quite rich, and there is a children's paradise, where there are many children watching cartoons sitting in rows, and finally they can liberate their parents to have a good breakfast.

Facilities: Not very new, but well maintained, with a grand lobby and elegant rooms.
Hygiene: in good condition
Environment: Birds and flowers around the hotel
Service: more thoughtful

There is also a wedding banquet hall next to the white sand beach, and the flowers inside are also beautiful, suitable for sisters who love to take pictures to make concave shapes.
The buffet is also very good. We reserved a seat for eight people in advance. There is a quiet location similar to a wine cellar. The lobby manager Dove is also very good. He is very enthusiastic towards children and adults, and the dishes are also very rich!
The only downside is that you have to queue up for check-in. Although many five-star hotels also need to queue up, I suggest that it can be improved so that the experience will be better

My favorite is the hotel's outdoor beach. The sand is fine and clean. The children were so happy after digging the sand for two days. The adults just lay on the beach chairs to relax and chat. This is what the holiday really looks like! In the afternoon when it was more sunny, I went to swim in the indoor swimming pool, which is next to the beach.
The orientation of the room is very good, drinking tea on the balcony is full of natural greenery. Playing with a wet swimsuit, it was already dry the next day. There are also children's bathrobes in the room, which are so cute and convenient for swimming.
The buffet breakfast has a lot of delicious items, and freshly baked waffles have become my favorite. Although there are a lot of people during the holidays and it is close to the time period, the overall meals are replenished quickly, and the restaurant area is also very orderly.
Sheshan and other scenic spots around the hotel are quite close. During the holidays, there are many people swiping their mobile phones. I continued to stay in the hotel and finally gave the children a bath.
In general, parent-child travel is highly recommended! Opened up a new world of vacation and rest.

But it still does not affect our stay mood and remarkable points. The overall operation of the hotel is in good condition. During the peak period of May Day, the breakfast is set to staggered peak hours. The service awareness and cleaning speed between meals have been greatly improved. There is no queue during peak hours. This is not easy, especially when I feel that the hotel may be reduced. In the case of lower operating costs, the service has been improved. The second is that the hotel has set up a lot of recreational facilities. In addition to the proud beach üèñÔ∏è, it has also added facilities such as horse farms, art galleries, archery üèπ, etc., so that guests do not have to go out specially to join the crowds of festivals.

msg:Beach, sun, swimming pool, the best match for vacation! The price of 1,000+ in Shanghai during the May Day holiday is really very cost-effective. Relatively speaking, the population density is not very high.
Environment: The environment is good. I booked a pool view room. Standing on the balcony, I can see the beach pool and greenery
Facilities: The hotel facilities are a bit old, but it doesn't affect the use. I personally prefer whether the children are having fun. It's just that the sound insulation is a bit poor. It's quite loud when people walk by in the corridor at night
Service: The service is still relatively good, because the staff responded positively to several requests

The Ctrip package includes skiing experience, archery experience, and tickets for the indoor playground, one big and one small, which is still very cost-effective.
The breakfast is relatively good. Reservations are divided into time slots. The package includes two breakfasts, one big and one small. Children under 150cm, this is still very user-friendly.
Although the hotel is relatively old, the overall maintenance is good. The sound insulation is a bit poor and it can't be helped.

The environment is more European-style, with beaches and swimming pools. It is estimated that there will be many people in hot weather. There is a children's parent-child amu*****t park on the 1st floor, which is suitable for strolling with children, and the children have a super happy timeüòÅ. For the three of us, we booked a double bed room and can get an extra bed for free.

msg:Environment: The environment of the hotel is very good, with greenery, outdoor swimming pool, beach, and racecourse. The parent-child activity areas do not interfere with each other. The design is quite careful. When the weather is good, the feeling of vacation is very strong. It's a pity that I heard that there will be more people during summer vacation. Dumplings, if there are few people, for the environment and parent-child activities, I will consider a second brush.

Facilities: The bathroom facilities in the room are actually very good, and the spare parts are all LAVIN, which smells good. But the hotel is indeed very old. From the leaking hot and cold water switches in the basin, the unresponsive switches in the room, and the rumbling air conditioner, they all have a strong sense of age. Even with careful maintenance Really too old. The special indoor swimming pool locker room is not as good as the general gym locker room, especially the shower area is a mess, it is worse than the general gym, and it is older. The locker in the locker room will not be opened. It is completely different from the general five-star hotel. Hotels or parent-child hotels cannot be compared. It is recommended to change into a swimsuit and bring a bathrobe in the room. This dressing room is a mess. I heard that the room may be upgraded at the end of the year, but the swimming pool changing room is not included in the upgrade.

Hygiene: Hygiene is acceptable, but there are many large and small moths in the room, so it took more than half an hour to practice catching moths with one hand... I don't know if it has something to do with the hotel's older age...

Service: The overall service is average, and the concierge at the door is very proactive. The front desk was more patient, because the check-in time was very late, and there was no queue, but the front desk told me that they could not help to make an appoin**ent for the breakfast at the required time because of the large number of people. In addition, when you checked in, you didn't introduce the area and content of the hotel's parent-child activities, and you didn't give a map introduction. You have to dig out the comments yourself and then ask the hotel staff. If there is a racecourse activity, the staff will give you a contact number for you to contact...and 3 A hotel staff pointed to 3 different roads to the racecourse... I don't know if it is a rented venue... It's too hard to find... A hotel that focuses on parent-child, this is very unreasonable, there is a feeling that a good hand has been beaten... By the way, I was told that dialing "0" in the room can transfer to the service hotline, but it is difficult to get through the phone... I don't know if I made a mistake.

The paintings on the sofa wall are gone, only two screws are left on the wall.
In addition, the bathroom has always been smelly, and it was uncomfortable all night.
The fabric panel on the bed board has been covered with pomade...
There are also unidentified disgusting objects on the walls of the bathroom and shower room...
Reluctantly, all the luggage was unpacked, and the family members also persuaded me not to change rooms...
It's terrible to spend money to live, it's ridiculous to think about it!

msg:The hotel recently launched a special room, which is quite value-for-money. It is very close to the hotel to go to the Outlets and Sam. It is really old-fashioned to enter the hotel. The quality of the hotel environment and service is still good, but it will be even better in summer. The swimming pool is still very big. Audrey gave us careful explanations from check-in, and helped us upgrade the room. He was really enthusiastic and pleasantly surprised. He took us to the room later and the room was quite comfortable. I asked Audrey to show us around the children's room, and I thought it would be a great room to book in the future, and it would be nice to book a villa with friends and family in the future. I took a look at the hotel and it's good that the hotel is basically 10 minutes away from the nearby attractions by car. A hotel with high cost performance is worth living in.

msg:First of all, when I brought my baby to celebrate New Year's Day, I thought it would be good to play in the indoor swimming pool and take a rest in the room. As a result, on the day of arrival, we were informed that the indoor swimming pool was closed due to the staff masks. . . . . disappoin**ent.
Secondly, I paid an adult fee (193 yuan) for breakfast because my son's height is over 160cm, but there are very few things to eat. It's only 8:30, and there are a lot of empty dishes and basins, and there are not many options, and they are not rich. Too shabby for a prestigious parent-child resort hotel. The two employees at the breakfast booth were also indifferent, and I don't know if it was because they were not feeling well.
When we checked in, the sister at the front desk was very gentle and offered to upgrade us to a suite. I am very grateful. But when I walked to the door of the room, I found that it was the end room on the far side that I didn't want to live in, because it was an upgraded room, and it was a little far to go out, so I accepted it. As it turned out, I didn't sleep well at night, and I don't know if it was a psychological effect.
The room is really big, with a large hall and bathroom, and a powder room. There is a bathtub and shower in the bathroom, but the bathtub does not have a hand shower, and the location of the faucet is very unreasonable. When the water is turned on, the water will spill all over the floor, so I gave up taking a bath. It is a pity that there is a TV set opposite the bathtub. There are two toilets, the toilet next to the shower room leaks, and the water in the shower room will flow to the toilet room along the middle partition, causing us to almost fall when we go to the toilet at night.
There is a balcony in the living room and the bedroom, but unfortunately the room faces north, there is no sunlight, and the whole room is shady.
It should be that the hotel is relatively old, and the equipment is not very new. Although there are TVs in the bedroom and hall, the TV in the bedroom has snowflakes and is not clear, and the remote control is not sensitive. It is better to borrow batteries from the waiter.
You have to drive when you go out, otherwise the neighborhood is very desolate. Although the hotel is next to Sheshan Park and Happy Valley, but because there is no plan for outdoor activities, the choice of this hotel is a bit of a failure. Apart from the activities in the hotel, there is no entertainment.
I don't know why, on New Year's Day, there were very few people in the hotel. From entering and leaving the lobby to the breakfast restaurant at night, I didn't see many people. The lobby of the hotel in Nuoda felt empty. In addition, although I bought a ticket for the Paradise Restaurant, the Paradise Restaurant was not open. . . . .
In short, I have been hearing about the landmark hotel from my friends, and I probably won't try it again.

The service is really bad. Maybe there are not enough people during the epidemic. The restaurant has to wait for 40 minutes to eat and has to be reminded twice before the first dish is served. The key is that there are not many tables of guests.

msg:Because the epidemic has not been out of Shanghai for a long time, we took a family of 4 out for vacation during the event of the Sofitel Sheshan Hotel. We chose the package for 3 days and 2 nights including two breakfasts, which is very cost-effective. The weather is not beautiful, it rained heavily in the past few days, the beach swimming pool, jungle walks, and horseback riding are all unplayable. Fortunately, the hotel is very big and has a big children's paradise, throwing a 5-year-old baby into it can also free your hands. The hotel is worthy of being a five-star hotel. One person, one code is tested very strictly. You have to scan the code for 48 hours to enter the restaurant. For those of us with babies, it is quite reassuring. The service attitude is very good. Since my two children are allergic, the superior room I lived in on the first day was not suitable for me. Ms. Chen in the lobby helped us upgrade the parent-child suite the next day after understanding our situation. This room is 5 years old. My baby especially likes the slides and swings inside. The special amenities are all very lovely. In short, it is also a good place for suburban tourism.

Room standard interstellar configuration, a bit outdated, carpet a bit dirty. Pillow is too soft and uncomfortable, others are ok.

I came to the swimming pool, not during the summer vacation. Although the temperature is 35 degrees, there are not many people, and the children are very happy.

But the facilities need to be maintained, there are too many mosquitoes in the outdoor swimming pool, biting several bags, many abandoned facilities, the caramel and the tower behind it are too old... When I checked in, there was no doorman at the gate, and the lights in the lobby were not turned on. Having stayed in so many five-star hotels, this one is the only one‚Ä¶

P.S The buffet is good, it is very enjoyable to eat, of course, less people is also an advantage

msg:The hardware is relatively good. But the service, is really not complaining. 1 The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is the lowest among all the parent-child hotels I have stayed in. The outdoor temperature was 26-29 degrees during the two days we went, and the water was almost normal temperature. On the first day, a lot of people raised their opinions, and it was a little higher, but it was still cold the next day. 2 I stayed for two days in a row. On the first night, I went back to the room to demagnetize my room card. I called the front desk and asked me to go to the front desk to change the card... I brought a "golden ten thousand taels" urgently needed The baby who changed the diaper really couldn't cooperate and asked for the room card to be sent over. There was no apology at all. 3 I had already thought about it. Before checking out the next day, I wanted to go to the hotel to have dinner before leaving. I asked two waiters in the lobby, and they both said that there was nothing to eat. After 5:30, I ordered takeaway by myself, and then Go to the bathroom, pass by the western restaurant, and find that there is actually something to eat... 4 The menu of the western restaurant is the same as the menu of the park, but the price of the park is a lot higher, no wonder the menu is not generous, put it on the table, 5 art museum It said it was delivered, and when I arrived at the door, I was asked to go to the front desk to get the ticket, so why didn't I give it to me when I checked in... 6 When I left, the parking lot asked me to go to the lobby to get a parking ticket... Then why did I go to the check-out Why don't you give it to me? In short, it can make people feel bad from time to time.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the conclusion first. It is very suitable for children to play in the water and sand. Next time I will come to play in the wrong peak. The poolside room is recommended, and the store upgrade can be considered.
After reading all kinds of bad reviews on the Internet, I came here after doing a good job of psychological construction. Many people say that the lakeside room has a musty smell. People like me who are a little allergic to the respiratory tract are very worried about this. But in fact, the room I stayed in must not have it. When I upgraded at the front desk, the front desk The manager also told me that he had never encountered a musty room.
In general, I am quite satisfied that the hotel facilities are relatively old. This is known in advance, so I don't have much hope. But in fact, the beach and swimming pool are really suitable for children to play. The swimming pool at the entrance of the poolside room is very convenient. Even if you are not swimming, you can play with water for your baby or lie on the deck chair, and it is also very happy to take the wind and cool. Feels like a child.
I think going off-peak must be able to improve satisfaction. After all, if there are many people, the privacy of the poolside room will definitely not be good, and the first floor will definitely be damp if everyone walks in and out, but if there are few people This is no longer the case.
In general, the service is quite satisfactory, especially a manager at the front desk, and the breakfast is quite surprising, I mean the type and taste of the dishes. The service enthusiasm of the restaurant staff still needs to be improved, especially the service of the fried egg stall and the noodle stall has lowered the overall level. But overall, it doesn't hide the flaws.
Overall it was a pleasant trip.

msg:Due to the epidemic in Shanghai, I couldn't take my children to play in the summer vacation. I thought about finding a parent-child hotel in Shanghai for the children to let them fly. Opened it and found it, and found the Oriental Sofitel. Mainly attracted by the water amusement projects in the hotel, I decided to book a clubhouse room before the school started.
    When I came to the hotel to register, I was amazed by the long queue. All of them were parents and children. Sure enough, everyone brought their children to play in the water.
    At the time of registration, the front desk informed that the room booked not only includes two breakfasts, but also a buffet afternoon tea and light meal before dinner. Amazed. A family of three, enjoy a beautiful afternoon tea time before moving in, then change into swimsuitsü©± and start to play in the water. This season, you don't have to worry about the outdoor water temperature. It feels like soaking in a hot spring, which is warm but not hot.
    When it came to dinner, I originally planned to eat with my family at the hotel's Wang Ting Restaurant. I thought that there was a light meal before the meal, so I came to find out. I didn't expect that the three cold and three hot meals at the front desk were rich and delicious. The three hot dishes that have been discussed have become non-repetitive dishes that can be changed after eating. In addition to the three cold dishes, there are various snacks and fruits. After we paused for the buffet, we finally gave up the idea of dinner... The light food here is definitely a five-star praise!
    After the night, although the water park is much quieter, it is an excellent time to take pictures. You can bring your relatives and let them swim in the empty pool. The pictures you take at this time will definitely amaze you. relatives!
    For the buffet breakfast on the second day, the hotel arranges the reservation more reasonably, it will not feel crowded, the dishes are richer, and the dining environment is good. After eating breakfast and lunch, of course, you still have to go into the water again, and make an appoin**ent for a delayed check-out time with the day before yesterday, and you can release yourself in the water again!
    In general, I am very satisfied with this experience. The service of the hotel is first-class, I am satisfied with playing, eating happily, and sleeping peacefully. The only regret is that the hotel has been open for too long, and some facilities are slightly outdated. While eating and sleeping soundly, these flaws can be completely ignored.
    Finally, I would like to remind everyone that if you have the opportunity, you must try to book a poolside room, and you must experience the thrill of getting out of bed and jumping directly into the water...

msg:The Sofitel Hotel is very close to my home. I have always wanted to experience it. I finally can play in the water with confidence when my baby is about to go to kindergarten. When the epidemic broke out, I couldn‚Äôt go to Sanya, so I just went to Sofitel for two days. Because there is a tenant upstairs who has a close connection, we have to be locked in the building for two days. We can only cancel the order in mid-July and temporarily book a deluxe room without breakfast (thanks to Ctrip butler here). Miss Yan took the trouble to arrange for the trea**ent). When I arrived at the front desk that day, I directly asked for extra money to upgrade. The handsome guy at the front desk said that the poolside room was full and recommended that I upgrade to the club room. The floor is high and the view is good. The most important thing is that it comes with breakfast, afternoon tea, light dinner, and unlimited soft drink. There was also an extra bed in the room.
     When you take your baby out to play, you must be prepared in advance. I bought a swimming ring, water gun and sand tools. The baby's skin is very white, and the long-sleeved swimsuit, sunshade, swimming cap, sunscreen, and sunscreen are all set. Fortunately, he did not get sunburned. After three days and two nights, the baby is very happy! ! üòú
     The breakfast at the hotel in the morning is very rich. The little brothers and sisters of the hotel racecourse
Very enthusiastic, the little pony Xiaohua is very cute and obedient, my baby even sang to Xiaohua on horseback üòÇ (of course, this is a chargeable item) The outdoor swimming pool is very large, suitable for accompany the baby to play in the water and explore üòéChildren's pool seesaw and slide The slides are also nice. The indoor swimming pool is glass-topped or very dry, so there is no need to go, but the service attitude of the girl at the front desk of the swimming pool locker room is very good. The afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge just give us a rest in the middle, and tea and meal services are available. After checking out on the third day, I also took my baby to the children's playground on the basement floor for two hours (also charged). Except for the baby who is not used to sleeping in the hotel bed for a while at night, in fact, the time is very happy and excited, like a happy bunny üê∞
     Because my dad is busy with work, I took my parents with me this time, and I have a lot of things for my children. I call a seven-seater business car directly to and fro. The concierge in the hotel lobby can do it. I will take care of the luggage up and down. Don't worry about me, like it! It is necessary to spend money when you go out to play, and the most important thing is to have fun, so I am very satisfied with this three-day hotel tour. Next time I will take my baby to the hotel to play with water, I hope you can book what you want. Room Type ï ·µî·¥•·µî  î

msg:It‚Äôs a pity that after so many years of business travel, this is the first time I gave a bad review to the Sofitel Sheshan. We have reviewed countless hotels across the country and are generally very understanding and considerate of hoteliers in the current epidemic. This July and August alone. There are no less than 30 hotels with outdoor swimming pools in 16 provinces across the country. (All have booking records from Ctrip and various hotel members.) The front desk of this Sofitel is extremely disappointing. I wanted to issue an invoice, and she asked me to scan the QR code. , I said, I know your invoicing software is not that. When you enter your name and tax number, other tax refund columns will not pop up. Even if it pops up, the company update address will not be updated in time. I hope you can help me type it on the computer according to what I gave you ( This was proved later) She actually said: 1. According to our hotel's regulations, invoices are issued by guests themselves by scanning the QR code. 2. Who is responsible if there is an error on the invoice? 3. It cannot be typed on our computer. Yes, this is not a theory that we are responsible for refusing to shirk, but the tone and attitude are very rude. This set of deception is so funny to us professional travelers and long-term hotel guests, but in the blink of an eye, if you think about it, you don‚Äôt really want to stay in the hotel. Or the elderly people who don‚Äôt know how to issue invoices on mobile phones were really fooled by her, so I left this review. There was no heavy passenger flow next to me at the time. Later, my colleague who was sitting next to her was able to issue the invoice in less than two minutes. The name of the front desk who made the complaint is "Olina Shi Shi (I won't write her full name). As for the check-in in the afternoon, it was delayed until after four o'clock, and you didn't ask the front desk or call. It's because I have three provinces in this summer vacation. Among the ten family-friendly swimming pool hotels, this one has the most chaotic check-in SOP management. I hope to improve it, especially the correct service attitude. Well, this paragraph has more words than my Ctrip reviews in a year [crying])

msg:During the epidemic, it is impossible to leave Shanghai. Sofitel Sheshan, known as a small Sanya, has become the first choice for bringing children in the summer vacation. The beach, swimming pool and sun vacation are fascinating.
Check-in experience: It takes an hour or two to wait for the check-in procedure on weekends online, and the room has to wait until about 3:00. The truth is that it is more than 10:00 on Sunday, and the check-in starts at 11:00, and the check-in process is completed quickly. After dinner at the Japanese restaurant, 1 Got a room in no time. The attitude of the staff is very good.
Hardware facilities: The history of the hotel is a bit long, and the facilities are a bit outdated. Compared with the new ones, I have prepared in my heart. Although some facilities are old in reality, in general, it is within the acceptable range, and it is still an old brand. five-star hotel.
Amu*****t: I come here to play in the water. The children have a great time playing, and the adults are also happy and exhausted.
Catering: There are Japanese restaurants, Wang Ting restaurants and hotel buffets. After eating, Japanese restaurants are more suitable for the price and taste, and it is also very convenient to order takeaways.
Suggestion: There are some broken bricks under the pool, which may cause scratches.
Overall evaluation: still worth coming, good experience

msg:[Parent-child hotel] It is really suitable for bringing children to play in the water. The school will start in September. I can't leave Shanghai because of the summer vacation, so I temporarily chose the Sofitel Sheshan Hotel~ I read a lot of online reviews before, there are good and bad, However, as a relatively old-fashioned resort hotel in Shanghai, it is still a good choice~
I like the beach üèñÔ∏èSwimming pool~ I heard that the sand was shipped from Sanya, it is very fine and soft, the children are super happy~

Environment: The overall style is relatively simple in European style. The lobby is still spacious, but it is a little dark. The area is relatively large. The rooms and restaurants are relatively spacious and acceptable. When I checked in, I upgraded the suite, which was recommended by the front desk, and the final experience was good. Although the decoration facilities are relatively old, I really slept in a lot of better hotels. Sofitel's bed is really comfortable and good for sleep .
The bathroom and toilet in the room also looked relatively clean. The shower water felt super comfortable, and the water was very delicate.
Service: Sofitel is now scanning the QR code to place an order on the WeChat public platform. It is very convenient to place an order on what you need, and the service is still good.
FOOD:
Breakfast: The suite includes a buffet breakfast. The breakfast is really large in scale, with many styles, and it is dazzling, but the taste is average, so there is still room for improvement. It is more important to reduce some of the more popular breakfasts and make them taste better. .
LunchÔΩúDinner: I chose the Japanese restaurant in the hotel on the first day. The taste is very good. The price is similar to the price of the Japanese food store outside. On the second day, I ate the Japanese food set meal, which is not bad. I can also get a 10% discount. Personally Very recommended, mainly with children, the Japanese food store has fewer people, and the dining environment is better.
Dinner: The next night, I ordered the Wangting Hotel next to it, and I ordered a set meal plus a few dishes. Really, the amount of dishes is very large, and the taste is surprisingly good. The craftsmanship of the old Shanghai hotel is really good~ I thought it was relatively good when I first arrived at the restaurant. The old environment is average, the floor is a lot of sunken, no hope hahahaha, I didn't expect to underestimate it, the taste is very good~
I didn't leave the hotel for three days and two nights. I still recommend it to friends who don't want to run far in summer~
Hotel Children's Paradise: After 10 minutes of going, the child came out, there is nothing to play, it is very old, the toys are very dirty, it is not recommended, you have to buy tickets, I feel that this is not in place, since the fee is charged, the quality should be guaranteed , the children said it was not fun when they went there, it was very dark, and they came out without any toys üòÇüòÇ The tickets were wasted üòÖ
Beach poolüèñÔ∏èThere are registered to borrow blankets and sand-proof socks at the intersection, which is very convenient. It is more convenient to bring various equipment for your baby~
Horse Farm: My husband and I went there. The children can participate in the activities when they are older. It is good to see many children taking horse lessons. We experienced it, and it was not bad~
Overall it is a good parent-child hotel, a rare swimming pool with a beach in Shanghai, and a poolside room, which is still very good.

This package includes buffet breakfast, buffet dinner, and afternoon on the executive floor. Tea.
üëâLet's talk about the environment of the hotel first. Sofitel is already an old Internet celebrity hotel. The facilities in the store are well maintained. The children's activity area, the hotel's catering, and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are still designed. It's quite convenient, especially the outdoor swimming pool is very large. Children have a lot of fun in the water, they won't be next to each other, and everyone is very comfortable to play and play.
üëâLet's talk about the hotel's catering, because we booked the executive floor including the afternoon tea on the executive floor, but because the children went to the outdoor swimming in the afternoon, they missed the afternoon tea time on the executive floor, and then the service staff on the executive floor packed it for us I ordered a snack and delivered it to the room. The hotel thought about it very thoughtfully. The two babies must have been a little hungry after swimming very much. They can eat the snack at the hotel, which is still very satisfied.
Let's talk about the hotel's dinner and breakfast. We all ate it on the first floor of the hotel, which is the cafeteria VIE. We didn't eat on the administrative floor, because we felt that the choices downstairs were larger, and then the children could choose There is also more room. After all, we have two children with us. The food in the cafeteria is quite rich, such as beef ribs, spaghetti, roast duck, beer and red and white wine can be drunk freely, and the children's favorite ice cream is also available. , After eating, you can go to the activity room to watch TV. I think my two babies are also very happy to eat and play. Breakfast is a bit more crowded than dinner. 8:30-9:30 is the peak time for dining. After 9:30, you may have to wait for a table. The food selection is also what you want to eat. It is best to increase it a bit. Small wontons, large wontons, and others are very satisfied.

I ordered takeout and wanted to ask where I can eat. There was a male lobby manager who was very cool. He told me that I couldn‚Äôt eat in the lobby. I wanted to eat in the room. How can I eat if you don‚Äôt give me a room? Takeout can only be delivered. When we got to the hotel entrance, we could only run out to get takeout in the sun and sit in the car to eat.
The room is old, there are stains on the sofa, and the bath towels are old and have burrs. I won‚Äôt even mention it. Because I never leave reviews, I didn‚Äôt even think of taking pictures.
Here comes the key point. I checked out of the room the next day. When I got home at night, I had a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãred rash all over my body. It was so itchy that I couldn't sleep in the middle of the night. I'm not allergic. This has never happened to me before. It's the first time in my life. , I have stayed in hotels no matter how bad they are before, and I have never had this kind of experience. It is really amazing.
Won't come again...

Whether it is the front desk or the foyer, all the service staff are very good, and they are helping tourists with luggage üß≥. In such a hot day, the weather is 40 degrees, and the service is still amiable. Walking through the hall is the swimming pool. The environment is beautiful and the water quality is clear. Whether it is children or adults, they all have a great time! The beach is also clean, and there are service staff constantly checking the water quality. We have such a close guard by our side, and we can rest assured. Afternoon tea was enjoyed in the executive lounge. I don't know why, but the snacks that day were very delicious, and the dinner was also great. Lamb chops, salmon, etc., were all fresh.

There is everything, and people are not tired. I've been in a lot of hotels, but I still love Sofitel's beach. I booked a poolside room this year, and I think it's really wise. The epidemic can't go out, and there are obviously many more people than in previous years. You can go into the water from the poolside room and the balcony outside. The privacy is also very good, and you don't need to crowd people to eat dumplings. The child was so happy that he soaked in water except for sleeping and eating. The first floor is also very close to the restaurant, which is very convenient.

The hotel is very convenient to the beach, the swimming pool is big enough, much better than tropical storms, and it is super suitable for children. I sent a circle of friends, and many friends came to ask me what hotel it was. Originally booked for three days and two nights, the children did not have enough time, so they continued for another night. Last but not least, the sunset is so beautiful!

Although there are many people checking in, but after the formalities are completed, you can go directly to the beach to dig sand, wait for the room to be cleaned, and then check in, which does not affect the play time at all. The poolside room can swim when you go out. Children are really happy to play, especially our 3-4 year olds who can't keep up with their physical strength. When playing, you can rest on the deck chairs on the terrace, so that it will not be too sunburned.

Environment: The hotel has an artificial beach, and the swimming pool surrounds the hotel. Guests who live on the first floor can choose a pool room. We chose the clubhouse room this time. Since there were a lot of people staying in the hotel in the afternoon, the front desk informed us to go directly to the clubhouse floor to check in without waiting in line, which made me feel a lot more comfortable.
Breakfast: The breakfast is really good, the variety is complete and the taste is good.

I have been here once before, and I have a deep memory of the hotel's super large swimming pool. This time I brought a super large unicorn to soak in the water. The experience is absolutely fantastic! (I have brought unicorns to many hotels before, but they were refused to go into the water because they were too big, woohoo~) In addition to playing in the water, the hotel also has an indoor ski field and an outdoor horse riding field for entertainment. The first day of check-in happened to be the child's birthday, and the hotel also prepared a birthday cake, which tasted great! If you stay in the club house, you can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour in the evening at the executive lounge on the same floor. There are few people and good service. It is very nice during the epidemic! I have visited all three restaurants in the hotel and they are all good. The buffet restaurant in the evening is currently only a la carte, but the taste and portion of the food are very good. Blue Japanese restaurant sashimi is very fresh, and the set menu is also very good. Although Wang Ting Restaurant is Cantonese cuisine, the portion is frighteningly large. Friends who want to go, please order in moderation [Âë≤ Ya] The experience of four days and three nights is generally very good. Too big [naughty] [naughty]

If you like quiet, you can have rooms on both sides away from the beach. The service is very good. I ordered a bath towel several times and they were delivered quickly, as well as desserts and small toys. Thank you! Lastly, it would be better if the room rate included a buffet dinner.

Takeaway sushi was delivered to the door of the hotel, just go down and get it. I went to swim at 2 o'clock. The outdoor swimming pool was very dry in the afternoon and could not stand the heat. I switched to the indoor swimming pool to play until dinner and went upstairs. The second room was obtained before 3 o'clock, which was smooth for the peak weekend. In the evening, we can actually go shopping at Sam and Ole. The car is very close. We took the baby roller skating and skateboard to kill time in the hotel park. Before 8 am the next day, the girls went downstairs and started taking pictures, haha, there is no beach and swimming pool, it is very filming, and it is not hot.

msg:It was the first time I stayed at the Sofitel Sheshan, and I felt very good. The room is clean and the facilities are easy to use. If you meet the cleaning aunt in the aisle, she will take the initiative to say hello, and her attitude towards children is very kind. Dinner is a buffet at VIE restaurant. There are quite a lot of types. There is spaghetti that children like to eat. It is estimated that the water consumption during the day is too much. The children ate a whole plate, and they have to eat spaghetti for breakfast the next day, haha‚Ä¶.This time Mainly to take children to play in the water, the hotel's facilities did not let us down. The swimming pool is very large, not too crowded, and the water is quite clean, which is very suitable for parent-child activities. Because of the epidemic in Shanghai, I haven't gone out for several months. I chose this hotel this time without leaving Shanghai. It also satisfied the children's happiness and was very happy. It's a good choice for a second brush.

msg:There are few comments, one is relatively lazy, and the other is that the hotel is basically decent. But this short-term vacation experience is really bad, I really have to express it so that more friends don‚Äôt step on the thunder.
Due to the epidemic in Shanghai, it was inconvenient to travel to the province this year, so I could only choose a city tour. I chose a lot of hotels, and finally I chose Sofitel's poolside room. Probably this choice was the biggest mistake:
1. The hygiene is extremely poor: the hotel is relatively old, and I am prepared for this, but the old hotel does not mean that the hygiene should be poor. It is estimated that the curtains have not been washed for a long time. The paper towel has not been clean yet, so it can only be used. The washbasin in the bathroom has water stains on the ground, it has not been wiped clean, and there is garbage in the yard. I can't imagine that this is what a hotel with a 3K price should look like;
2. Poor service: it takes 20 minutes to get a towel in the telephone room, and it is unimaginable that the phone is contacted three times;
3. The sound insulation of the room is poor. Don't want to sleep in in the morning. From 7 o'clock in the corridor, there are noises and footsteps coming in and out. It feels like it is in the city center;
4. The most important thing to complain about is this poolside yard. The price of a poolside room is twice that of a pool view room, but the price/performance ratio is absolutely tasteless. First of all, the swimming pool is very shallow, and the basic water depth is 90cm. The child cannot swim. In addition, the courtyard by the pool has no sense of privacy. Everyone can come. When the door is opened, there are people sitting outside who are swimming and resting. That's what Sofitel is all about!

Because of the masks, it is more difficult for Shanghai people to take their children out to play, so the local parent-child hotels are more popular on the basis of their popularity. Fortunately, many children-themed suites have been booked in advance, which are very suitable for families of two large and two small. Whether in the room or in the outdoor pool, the kids had a lot of fun. The food is also good. Sofitel will be a great choice for taking children to play in the hotel during the summer vacation.
The only thing I feel a little lacking is the TV in the suite. It is hard to imagine that in such a hotel, in such a big room, there is only such a small old TV. I hope the hotel can upgrade it.

msg:A must go place for kids in summer. You can soak in water all the time. After checking in at 3 o'clock, I first soaked in the poolside room pool at the entrance, and after dinner, I soaked in the outdoor swimming pool. The water was still hot at 9 o'clock in the evening in the weather of 40 degrees. When you get up at 7:00 in the morning, you can dig a little sand, eat breakfast and go to the indoor swimming pool at 9:30. The outdoor swimming pool and the poolside room open to the water are the highlights. It's good to make reservations for breakfast dine-in to avoid too many people. The furniture in the room is a bit old but nothing wrong with it. As long as the kids are happy.

msg:How can I put it, overall I am disappointed. It doesn't feel like a five-star hotel at all, except for the outdoor swimming pool which is the highlight. Let's talk about hygiene first. The room hygiene is very poor. There are flying insects on the sofa and melon seed shells on the carpet. The service is not five-star. The front desk phone is always the most difficult to call. It takes at least a minute for someone to answer. Sometimes no one answers the answer. I have never encountered this in any five-star hotel. The service staff of the hotel are basically... It feels like an internship, with no training at all. Let alone five stars, three stars are better than this, let alone smiling service. Don't even think about it in Sofitel, no service staff will smile. The facilities are even worse. There is no air conditioning in the corridor Y on the sixth floor where I live. The air conditioning in the room stopped cooling at around one o'clock. The family went to a sauna in the middle of the night. After struggling with it, the air conditioning became better after three o'clock. The hotel refunded 700 yuan. . Then the shower cannot be kept at a constant temperature. There are only two options: boiling water and cold water. It is either scalding to death or cold water. It is hard to imagine that this is a bathroom in a five-star hotel. You can only go to the swimming pool to take a bath. The water pressure is also very unstable and the water is very, very small. I am curious. Are the room equipment not checked before check-in? The only good thing is that the outdoor swimming pool is very big and the children have a lot of fun. I don't understand what the management of the Sofitel is like. The service staff are very formal and have no service. It is completely different from other resort hotels I have been to. There is not much choice for food. Finally, I spent several thousand to go to the swimming pool for a round.

msg:Thinking that there would be less people in the middle of the week, I booked this package from Ctrip and took my kids to stay in a hotel and play at Eiffel Park. There are really few people, the environment is average, and the service industry is average. In short, it feels like it is not as good as the other time. Maybe in the future, the most I can do is take my baby to swim. It felt really good when I went there for the first time, friendly service staff, clean environment...I have to complain, the room facilities are old, even if it is old, I can't even turn on the heater in winter, the air conditioner is loud and does not heat, and it blows loudly. In the middle of the night, besides the noise, there was no warm air... What impressed me the most was that there were no lights on in the dim corridor of such a big hotel, which subverted my perception of star-rated hotels. When I checked out, I only received a response from the hotel front desk. One sentence? And then it was over... I remember the last time I booked a parent-child room, the swing was missing a screw, and my child fell off at that time. Later, I only received a word of sorry from the hotel, but no additional concern, and I didn't think about it anymore. , otherwise, according to industry regulations, the room fee would have to be waived before making a claim. The supporting facilities and services are really not up to par...

Five or six swimming pools are carefully laid out and intertwined. There is also a children's pool specially designed for children. The two beaches are large and clean. The hotel also carefully prepared free beach socks to prevent children from being scalded or scratched. The hotel also has a standard indoor heated swimming pool. If you are afraid of the sun, you can play indoors. It would be even better if the hotel room could be refurbished!

There are many poor places: 1) In this epidemic, there is only a buffet breakfast and no dinner. The breakfast food is not fresh, the place where the wontons are packed can smell sour wonton skins, the coffee machine is broken, the waiters in the restaurant are obviously lack of manpower, and they can't arrange it. , There is dust in several places. I heard the quarrel between the house cleaning aunts and said that they don't want to do it anymore. Too many rooms can't be done. The staff is not enough, and the staff is very irritable. 3) The towels are not available. 4) Mosaic fell off the bottom of the swimming pool, scratching the foot of the child next door 5) Earplugs are required to sleep at night, but the housekeeping depar**ent said no.
How to say that, I really come every year, and the experience is different each time. This time I can understand the cause of the epidemic. Although there are so many unsatisfactory places, the children are very happy, and I think they are still very satisfied. The room could be renovated, it's too old. Hope the management can see the feedback from the guests.

I booked Sofitel Sheshan with my best friend and took the children to play for three days. The hotel service is good, the swimming pool is very clean, and the disinfection time is set every day, so the children can play with peace of mind. The children are very happy, the beach and the swimming pool can be regarded as enjoying the same trea**ent in Sanya. The children played in the water and I had a drink and chat with my girlfriend on the beach. It was a very pleasant three days. When I checked out, the children did not play. Enough noise to play for a few more days [laughs through tears] The restaurant is very good, the food tastes good, the overall feeling is very good this time, a very pleasant vacation, will definitely come again, Sophia is a good choice for taking a baby, The facilities next to it are also very good. It takes ten minutes to drive to Smurfs Paradise, Shenkeng Paradise, and Maya Water Park for five minutes. There is also a Helin Park. The scenery is very good. Overall, it is very convenient to play. hehe] [hehe]

After playing until more than two o'clock, I came to the fifth floor for a buffet afternoon tea, with sandwiches and small cakes, etc. The point is that you can dine in! It's finally time to dine in! After replenishing energy, go back to the room and change into long socks to go to the children's playground on the ba*****t level, which has ocean balls, trampolines, climbing tunnels and a large two-story slide. The staff is very responsible and will tell you where the children are when you can't find them. Going to the Chinese restaurant to eat until six o'clock is still a pleasant dine-in. After dinner, go to the children's playground and continue to play until the park closes at 8 o'clock. The buffet breakfast the next morning, the staff said that it was the first day of dine-in breakfast since the unblocking, and we were caught up. It was crowded, but fortunately the place was big enough that it wasn't crowded. After breakfast, I still played with my baby in the water. I ate pasta in a western restaurant at noon. The children said that it tasted good. After that, I continued to play in the water, but the sun was too big and I wanted to go to the indoor swimming pool, but unfortunately it was not open, which was a small regret. Finally, the room is full, with two bathrooms, suitable for families.

During the peak summer vacation and the epidemic situation, it is more troublesome, and the check in time is about 20 minutes acceptable. The children went crazy when they saw the swimming pool outside the window. They immediately changed their clothes and jumped into the water. The circular swimming pool exclusive to the poolside room is very beautiful and the water is very clean. There are always employees salvaging it. Later, I went to the main swimming pool. There are beaches and slides. There will be more people but they can have fun. There is also a children's paddling pool with some seesaws or something. I rented an inflatable boat for half an hour for 100 yuan. Adults can also sit , the children are very happy to climb up and down. It was really cool to play all the way back to the room until 5 o'clock. The next day's breakfast was not available for dining in, so we moved the table to the pool, and the children jumped into the water early in the morning, playing and eating for a while. The poolside room is a perfect two-day vacation except for the mosquitoes, which are terrible.

Weekend rooms are not only expensive, but also unreservable, only one for Friday night. The hotel's account manager, Sue, helped me book a poolside room again. It was a pleasant surprise for the children to stay for two nights. I was so happy, and also provided the two children with free children's paradise coupons. They were like mice falling into Same as in the rice jar. üòÇ The first night was the Big Mouth Monkey Room. The room and bathroom were very large. The children happily rushed in and played on the swings and slides, although they were reluctant to sit on the swings. The swimming pool can really be in the water in minutes. The beach is only open until 7 pm and is not allowed to enter the water, and other outdoor swimming pools have no time limit. Due to the epidemic, breakfast could not be eaten in, and the service staff delivered it to the room. The variety can only be said to be poor. Looking forward to having a good breakfast in the restaurant when I go back next month. Before leaving, I didn't expect Sue to come to the guest room to say hello, and buy gifts for the children out of her own pocket. This girl is enthusiastic, generous, and has high emotional intelligence. Her passion and love for her work are beyond words. My old aunt is very moved by young people who treat their work so seriouslyüëçüèª

msg:I plan to go in 2020, but the epidemic has repeated, and I have missed a few times. This time, I heard from a friend that the open-air swimming pool was open for the first time, so I made an itinerary on the spot. The poolside room is convenient for swimming when you go out, and there are few people. Due to the epidemic, indoor swimming pools are not open. All Shanghai can swim in the open air. Only a few hotels are open. It is recommended to take children to relax.

Service is one star level. Who doesn't believe it, try its service. Three girls at the front desk during the epidemic. There are very few questions asked that have a direct polite answer to yours. There is a woman with neat bangs at the front desk. Really dead. Even though her face is dark, I can feel her impatience even if I wear a mask. Ask her how the hotel occupancy rate is. A: You can see it yourself, Ctrip. Ask her if the poolside room is available now. A: Can't move in. in maintenance. If it is repaired and opened to the outside world, it cannot be upgraded. please. I ask you am I going to upgrade my room? Then the most unbearable thing is that you take your baby on vacation. The hotel was not busy at all. Can't take the initiative to inform the next play situation? Takeaway meal situation? Or where is the location of the swimming pool? please. Not a word except to give you the room card. One star is not as good as . I have stayed in many hotels around the world. Sofitel is not too bad either. Is this your front desk? The price of 650 may be worthy of hardware facilities. The room and pool are ok. But sorry for this service. One star is not as good as . Everyone, don't look for the front desk with bangs. Don't ask other rooms to say that you can't upgrade before you speak. On my son's birthday. Really regret this one. I didn't even know that the hotel had a children's paradise until I checked out the public comments. Free will not go again. Four stars are for hotel hardware facilities. As for service. Because of those front desks. Especially the girl who checked me in with bangs. I give you a negative one star. Oh, right . Also this hotel is the only one. The guest calls a car with luggage. He doesn't help with luggage to the car. And I have a girl with a baby. Impressed . Will never go again. This service is not as good as one star.

Because the epidemic has affected very few guests, the service staff from the front desk to the hotel waiters are indifferent and lack courtesy. Not a five-star service attitude at all. it is a pity. I think it may be related to the lack of supervision from hotel managers during the epidemic period.

The staff inside were not familiar with the hotel environment. I had to think about everything I asked. Either they said it wrong or they didn‚Äôt know what was inside the hotel. It's okay. I booked a parent-child room and the kids liked it. The parent-child room is really expensive. Even if it's expensive, at least the service can keep up. The buffet is expensive and I'm not full. I don't know what to eat. The cleaners were there when I checked out. I came over to clean the room. As soon as I entered the room, I said that you guys are really messing around. I thought we made a mess in the room, and I was very rude. If we have many children, why don‚Äôt we let them mess around? I booked a parent-child room worth RMB 3,000 just to let my children have fun. I came here with great expectations. The result was a mess and the experience was extremely poor. I will not come back again in the future.

Before I could turn around and leave, the next person who checked in in advance could do it. . . If you see a child, you will not take the initiative to provide the child's slippers. If you don't want them, you will not take the initiative to provide them. The hotel rooms are dusty and the hygiene is so-so. I called customer service in the evening and asked for two bottles of water. I called twice and they still hadn't been delivered until I went to bed at 10 o'clock. In so-called parent-child hotels, everything except the swimming pool has an additional charge. A swimming ring in the swimming pool costs 100 yuan. In the past, swimming rings were provided free of charge in such parent-child hotels, and they would also be equipped with playground slides and other places where children can play. Really the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

msg:This is a hotel that I really want to write a review for, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to open Ctrip to see if I could write a review as soon as I left. First of all, the hotel is really old. It has not been renovated since 2009. The floor in the room is all black and creaks when you walk on it. The design of the wet and dry separation in the bathroom is also quite strange. Most importantly, the room's The door is not soundproof at all! It‚Äôs over! Complete! There is no soundproofing, so people walking by the door can hear clearly what they are saying, and conversations are not a problem.
Secondly, starting with check-in, I arrived at the hotel at two or three in the afternoon. I was really shocked as soon as I entered the lobby. There was a long queue for check-in, and even though every window was open for check-in? ! Even though all windows were open for check-in, I still had to wait in line for nearly 20 minutes, and the gentleman who checked me in was really unprofessional and didn't say anything to me from beginning to end. For example, I booked a club room with dinner included. They didn't tell me the location of the restaurant, what time the dinner would start, whether I could enjoy the executive lounge for free, etc. They just used the POS machine to swipe money and gave me the room card and that was the end? ? ?
Since having a baby, I have stayed in many parent-child hotels in Magic City with my baby. I have never seen guests staying at the hotel have to pay to play in the children's playground. It is also stipulated that they must wear socks. If you don't have socks, you have to buy them for 10 yuan each. For couples, only one adult and one adult can enter. If you add an extra adult, you have to pay 100 yuan. Is this a family hotel? Are you really crazy about money?
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the restaurant. Originally, I don‚Äôt have much hope for hotel buffets, but you have to have the basics. For breakfast, you don‚Äôt even have freshly fried poached eggs, let alone one-sided and two-sided. Where is the noodle cook from? I can‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs saying at all‚Ä¶
Alas, to sum up, I don‚Äôt recommend it. Don‚Äôt step on the bad news. I will never go there again.

msg:Can not go out of Shanghai, can only find a Shanghai hotel to play. Winter is the low season for Sofitel as the outdoor pool is closed. The indoor swimming pool feels cold and there are few people. After taking the children to play for half an hour, they left. It was too cold, and I was afraid of catching a cold. The children's pool was almost cold.
The breakfast is really bad. If it is included in the room rate, it is okay to eat. In addition, we recommend that you do not add breakfast. I have a child who is 15 years old, so ‚ûï 193 to buy another one, then the cost performance is very low . There are few varieties, and they are all cheap. Nothing special either. The standard of breakfast is not as good as that of four-star hotels in other places. Hope the breakfast can be improved.

msg:Sorry for the late review. It was the first time I stayed at Sofitel Oriental Sheshan, and the overall feeling was quite good. The check-in procedure is fast, the hotel lobby is stylish, the hardware and software facilities are complete, and the breakfast is quite satisfactory. The highlights of the hotel are the outdoor indoor swimming pool and the beach, as well as horse riding and art galleries. Although the outdoor swimming pool is not open in winter, the temperature of the indoor swimming pool is acceptable, and the children have a great time playing in the pool and the beach. Special thanks to Miss Shi Qian at the front desk of the hotel. She was very considerate when she saw that our party still had a baby. She upgraded us to an executive room and a south-facing room, allowing our family to experience the warmth of home. Because I only stayed for a day and didn't have a good time, the child was still reluctant to leave, and I hope to stay in this hotel next time. It is indeed a good place to stay and relax.

Check-in is also a long queue, with a two-year-old child in line for an hour and a half... Check-in at 4:30.

It's almost the same... Disposable slippers and toiletries are as thin as paper. The only advantage is that the pool view outside the window is also pleasing to the eye...
The breakfast is amazing because there are many people staying in it. The breakfast buffet was changed to a stall to sell things... Then the breakfast was changed to the banquet hall. The staff didn't inform the sign... Only after going downstairs to the restaurant in the morning The indoor-outdoor shuttle jacket didn't bring cold to sneeze... My favorite thing about staying in a hotel is to eat breakfast... This is good except for being cold and messy... It's the same as a farmhouse, and it's nothing but this meal for kids and breakfast. It costs 193 yuan/person to eat two hundred hairs and eat a loneliness. Homemade sandwiches and coffee are full...all the way the corridor is cold and swish...
The only advantage is the location and service. After all, everyone is on vacation during the Chinese New Year. They are still working overtime...

msg:If I come back again in the future, I will definitely have nowhere else to go. There is no service at all in this hotel. First of all, I don‚Äôt know why I have to wait until 11 o‚Äôclock to check in. There are only two people at the front desk. I know it is the peak season and it is full at the same time. People in Shanghai couldn‚Äôt go anywhere just after the lockdown was lifted, and they had to queue up several times to check in! The breakfast cost 98 per serving. I don‚Äôt know where I bought the frozen steamed buns, but they were heated. I had to go get the breakfast myself, and no one gave it to me. . . It's still a five-star restaurant anyway, even if you can't dine in at the buffet, you won't be fooled like this! Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs only ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù, the outdoor swimming pool. The water couldn‚Äôt be any dirtier. I wonder if no one has cleaned it? Floating objects, dirty leaves, branches, etc. can be seen everywhere. . . . What's even more incomprehensible is that for such a swimming pool hotel, there is no green cover next to the swimming pool, and there is still exposed land! ! ! How can the swimming pool be clean? All in all, it is a hotel that is extremely confusing!

However, the waiter at the lobby front desk ignored every question and replied and still didn't understand. It felt like being away from people thousands of miles away. The room was old. The tables are dusty and the hygiene is poor. The waiters in the cafeteria are back to the five-star level. They are enthusiastic, thoughtful and answer all questions. They also take the initiative to serve us. We feel at home. The Chris**as party is lively and the desserts are unique. The children like it very much. My son's playground is big and the facilities are great. It is fully equipped and has good service. It is an ideal place for children to play. The external environment of the hotel is like a tropical island. It is probably a great place to bring children in the summer. I look forward to the arrival of summer.

The people are nice, the service is good, and the efficiency is very high. This time the booking was upgraded to a suite. The lounge area and bedroom are very private. The balcony faces the indoor swimming pool and outdoor swimming pool. It is very comfortable. The only minor problem is the hotel room.

The gate is Sichen Highway, it is very convenient for us to get in and out sooner or later

üçÉEnvironment: Sure enough, it is known as Little Sanya. The hotel is almost surrounded by swimming pools and beaches. It is especially suitable for parent-child vacations. There are also villas in the backyard. The overall decoration style and greenery were built at that time.

üßπHygiene: During the peak of the November holiday, although there was a queue for registration, the room was cleaned quickly and the room was cleaned in a timely manner. The aunt didn‚Äôt forget to bring a freshly disinfected cup. Although the room looks good for years, it is maintained. The sanitation is acceptable and the bedding is up to standard. I did not find the bad conditions mentioned in the comments. The point is that the children‚Äôs playground is very hygienic. The swimming pool is well cleaned although the equipment is long.

üîîService: From registration to room service, no problems were found. During holidays, extra beds are available for free. The water delivery is very fast and breakfast is not chaotic.

msg:I went to the National Day holiday and booked a room one week in advance. I thought it would be crowded, but I didn't expect it to be unexpectedly smooth and the whole journey was tight. Super detailed running account:
1. The weather helps, there are 30+ in October, you can play in the outdoor swimming pool, which is also the biggest highlight here, otherwise there will be a lot of less fun.
2. Depart from home at 10 o'clock on the first day, have a light meal near 11 o'clock in Sheshan subway station, take a taxi to check in at 12 o'clock, after all, the hotel is expensive to eat, 2 large and 1 small, and a free extra bed, as shown in the picture. An adult sleeps well, avoiding the embarrassment of three people squeezing a bed at night.
3. After check-in, I gave the room card, you can play the facilities, and you will call to inform you when the room is ready. I urged it around 2 o'clock, and it was almost 2 o'clock that I could move in. In the afternoon, I mainly played on the beach and outdoor swimming pool. Towels here can be collected for free. Remember to prepare sand dredging tools in advance. It is recommended to bring a small folding stool to sun in the afternoon. Parasols and beach chairs are provided free of charge. Be sure to find a cool place.
4. The outdoor swimming pool is very large. You can change clothes and take a bath in the locker room on the first floor. Shower gel is often not available there, so it is best to bring it by yourself. The water quality of the outdoor swimming pool is clear. The indoor pool is not constant temperature, so I didn't go.
5. When the baby was swimming, she ordered milk tea takeaway, and made an appoin**ent with dinner for takeaway. So eating is very convenient. Return to the room more than 5 pm to rest. The room is spacious and there is a balcony where you can watch the sunset. There is no toilet for children, there is a bathtub, and the soundproofing is also good. Not as broken as in the legend
6. Eat a good meal in the evening and go for a drive, digging for a while.
7. The room booked on the National Day did not include the buffet breakfast, which saved the meal time. I booked a breakfast takeaway in advance. After eating, I started playing on the beach and outdoor swimming pool at 9 o'clock. Then I took time to leave the room.
At 8 or 12 o'clock, go to the parent-child restaurant on the first floor to eat and play in the children's playground. The commented set meal 2 large and 1 small 128 yuan is the most cost-effective. The food in the parent-child restaurant can't be flattered.
9. The baby reluctantly left until 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
I just visited Maoyu some time ago and both of them are very good. Weather help is the most important. This outdoor swimming pool is big and the beach is big. Maoyu has new facilities, free farms, cheaper charges for children‚Äôs playgrounds, and a constant temperature swimming pool.

The two rooms we stayed in were very good, quiet and comfortable. There are many grapefruit trees and pomegranate trees in the hotel. The environment is full. If it is not enough, it is a five-star resort hotel. It would be better if the catering, especially the breakfast, could be richer and more varied.

I have never encountered this situation in a five-star hotel. When I take a shower and turn on the faucet, yellow sewage comes out. I was simply stunned. The lowest room rate on Ctrip that night was 1,566 yuan. Yes, it was not a 166-yuan express hotel.
I called the front desk, but no one came to fix it for a long time. In fact, no one did anything when they came. That night I got a big red rash on my inner thigh (pictured) and I was a little angry. The hotel and the duty manager were very perfunctory and wanted to get over it hastily. . .
AccorHotels, I haven‚Äôt stayed here much before except for business trips. But this time: 1. In response to this incident, I felt that the hotel was really inappropriate. 2. The attitude and handling after the incident were too perfunctory. 3. When I called, I mentioned that I had a rash and whether there was any oin**ent, but the hotel said there was no oin**ent. I need to ask Ele.me to buy some oin**ent myself. Unheard of!!
Please choose this hotel carefully. The water quality is unclear and the service is extremely poor. . . AccorHotels and Sofitel are so disappointing.

The lady at the front desk, Lin Changhong, had very good service and was very patient. She gave us a room upgrade, which increased the pleasure of traveling when we checked in, thank you!
The buffet dinner variety is okay, the quality is good, the seafood includes crabs, shrimps, sashimi, and everything is recommended!
Breakfast, because we stayed for two nights, there were not many people for breakfast on Saturday, and the breakfast experience was very good. There are a lot of people on Sunday morning, and you have to line up. It feels like traveling on a holiday, and it‚Äôs not bad üòÑ
Although the room facilities are not new, they are not too old, relatively normal and acceptable. Children in the room have slippers, toothbrushes and toothpaste, no special reminder.
There is also a children‚Äôs playground. It costs more than 100 yuan to enter. I hope the hotel can be improved. It‚Äôs fine if the hotel is free for guests.

msg:A very disappointing stay. I deeply understand that due to the epidemic, it is impossible to go abroad or even go out of Shanghai, which has led to serious involution in vacation tourism, and the quality of hotels seriously does not match the high prices. Apart from the beach pool, there isn't much to praise. At this price, to be honest, if it weren‚Äôt for school starting soon and I couldn‚Äôt leave Shanghai, wouldn‚Äôt the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya be so good?

Let‚Äôs talk about it in detail below

objective part
There is a time requirement for check-in, which cannot be earlier than 11 o'clock. It seems that the person checking in will work at 11 o'clock. Personally I have almost never experienced this at a second hotel. I think it's OK if you go early and have to wait for a room, but you won't be allowed to check in. . .
The front desk phone never got through. I dialed nearly 10 times in one day and always got a busy signal.
I called to ask for a child's toothbrush and asked me to go to the concierge downstairs to get it.
Add a crib, call room service, ask yourself to call the front desk, but the front desk will never get through, and finally let the child sleep on the sofa.
The water pipe made a loud whining sound when taking a shower. Since I was ready to go to bed after washing, I was too lazy to say anything.
The lockers in the indoor swimming pool are extremely unreasonable. They are outside the locker room. After swimming, you can only walk through the locker room with your wet body, go outside to get a change of clothes, and then go back into the locker room to shower and change clothes. What an eye-opener.
The bottom of the swimming pool is covered with moss, and there are many dark flocs floating in the water.
A lot of mosaics fell off the bottom of the outdoor swimming pool. It must have been out of maintenance for a long time. I don‚Äôt know how hotels maintain their swimming pools in winter.
Pool lifeguard looks at his phone while working. After swimming for more than an hour, I found that the lifeguard was often looking at his mobile phone.
No one was handling the luggage left by the concierge when we picked it up. In the end we couldn't wait any longer and had to pick it up ourselves.
During the epidemic, I saw a mother walking around in the lobby with a child with an ice baby sticker on her head, and no staff realized what this meant. The temperature checks at the door are useless.

The subjective part
The facilities are old (the door looks dirty, the paint touch-up effect cannot be seen directly, the chairs in the room have broken leather, the water gun in the outdoor swimming pool is broken, and the upward button on one side of the elevator on the second floor cannot be pressed. It can be seen everywhere in the corridor and elevator (Severe damage)) Here are a few pictures for reference.
Compared with five-star hotels in other groups, the waiters generally lacked enthusiasm (no warm greetings and no smiling management), and the doorman did not help with the suitcases. There is no hardware or software. It feels like this hotel only has the beach and swimming pool.
Breakfast is quite simple, with only a few varieties. The children think they can only eat sausages, and the adults just have a bowl of porridge and leave. The whole breakfast can be finished within 10 minutes. For this kind of breakfast, the extra charge is not ambiguous at all. Two children under 1.2 meters tall have to be charged for one more child. Although the regulations are strictly enforced, it is not worth it.

In conclusion, I rarely stay in the AccorHotels. In the past, there were more Marriott and Intercontinental hotels. As for the Sofitel, it is indeed the first time and probably the last time. It completely refreshes the lower limit of the perception of five-star.

I think people order them on other platforms and get dinner for that night. We have so much to give away at a low price, let‚Äôs not say, I advise you to order more discounts as early as possible! This Sofitel Sheshan may have been built for a long time, and there was a musty smell when entering the room, which should be the reason for entering the swimming pool! The room service is particularly poor. Although it is a parent-child hotel, but forgot to bring the children's toilet, the hotel does not have this kind of thing? There is a bathtub in the room. I wanted to give the kids a bath after swimming. I ran into the room attendant on the way back to the room. I asked if we could call us before sending it to us, which means that I would walk around and get wet and wait for them to come. I haha... Let‚Äôs talk about the buffet on the first floor. I have breakfast early in the morning and there is a waiter at the door. A family in front of us will be there first. Maybe because of the strict control of the epidemic, we can only wait for one family to register and disinfect before taking it in. , This link is particularly bad. When it is our turn to go in, we will arrange to wait at a table that has not been cleaned up. The fire will be big. I have not eaten breakfast in the morning. I have already eaten it and the tableware is dirty. Children can only use a big iron fork. During the meal, the waiter will come over and over again to take away the only big iron fork. We have to stop it over and over again. This breakfast is too tiring! The overall facilities are old, service awareness is weak, parent-child mode is not like parent-child mode, will not come again!

msg:At the tail end of summer vacation, come and visit the famous and old "Family Resort Hotel"
The overall experience was astonishing
If you check in before 5pm, there will be almost no queue in the lobby.
After checking in, I took my kids to the beach excitedly.
Some banana boats and pontoon boats can be rented, but there are no clear signs where to rent them. It is also unclear where water guns are sold. It feels like management and guidance are slightly lacking.
The outdoor swimming pool is actually not big, but as long as they can play in the water, the children will be happy
My child wanted to take a bath in the evening, so I prepared a bath bag. When I was in the bathtub, I found that the hair left by the previous guest had not been cleaned up in the bathtub and shower room. I was quite upset. After taking a shower, we felt that the room was very hot. After we reported for repairs, we were told that the air conditioner in the room was broken and we were asked to change rooms.
After changing rooms, the hair dryer in the new room was broken and broken, and the nozzle could not be installed. It was already 90 o'clock in the evening and I didn't bother to complain.
Due to the bad experience at night, the front desk upgraded our breakfast to the executive lounge.
The noodles served in the executive lounge are actually cooked in advance with a ladle of hot soup. I have stayed in so many hotels and I have never had such noodles.
The child asked for a bowl of small wontons. The small wontons were freshly cooked, but the wonton wrappers given to the child were still raw! ! ! ! ! !
You called the waiter and asked for the head chef, but then no one ignored you. A chef came later and said that because the guy who opened the stall was new, he didn't have a good grasp of the heat, so he couldn't give any explanation.
Since I had a trip to Happy Valley later, I didn‚Äôt want to waste any more time. The manager on duty that day added me on WeChat and said he would understand and help me deal with it. The response was that he would give me a free room upgrade next time I go to stay.
It‚Äôs hard to imagine such a service experience for 1,700 yuan a night.

msg:I originally planned to go to Sanya, but I couldn't go anywhere because of the epidemic. In order to satisfy the children's desire to dig sand and skin water, I chose Songjiang Sofitel. After playing for three days, I felt that the effect was similar to that of Sanya. I checked in on Wednesday. I arrived at 3pm. It was the turn of one or two people in line. Check-in was quick. When I arrived at the room, I changed my swimsuit and rushed to the beach swimming pool. There are two outdoor swimming pools, one is a doll pool with a slide. , Water spray, our family is courageous, very suitable for this kind of fun, play with the water gun, when he plays, let him go to the beach. There are deck chairs on the beach. Everyone consciously occupies one for each house. Plus in the middle of the week, there are deck chairs to put things to rest. You can get two large bath towels by registering your room number on the shore. You should pay them back when you leave. It was dropped, but when I entered the room, there was air-conditioning. It was too cold. I could only put it back in the room. The aunt would also take it away the next day. The room has a balcony to cool off swimsuits, which is also very convenient. Stayed for two nights and three days, almost all of them were playing in the water. There was a drizzle as long as they did not go ashore without thunder. Fortunately, luck was good. The whole process was cloudy with occasional drizzle. The beach swimming pool is quite long, and there is another one after the bridge. There is a high slide. Unfortunately, my family dare not. There is also a large inflatable boat. It seems to be 100 yuan for 30 minutes. The breakfast buffet has everything that should be there, and there is a line up at 9 o'clock. For dinner, I ordered sliced skin duck, beef cubes, nine belly fish, a seasonal vegetable, and a fried rice one night at the Wang Ting Restaurant inside the hotel. Except for a little expensive, there was nothing wrong with it. The next day I had wine next to the subway station. I had a barbecue in the mall, which is a 10-minute drive away from the hotel. It is also very convenient to not eat in the hotel. If you order a takeout, go to the entrance pavilion to get it. The only pity is that it is already at the end of August. The weather is cold and I can no longer play in the water.

msg:In Ctrip, I booked a special package for a poolside room. 2388 includes a buffet breakfast for two and a buffet dinner for two. The price/performance ratio is very high. The hotel is a model of a parent-child hotel. The supporting facilities and environmental design are very popular with children. It has a Southeast Asian style and holiday style. Choosing a poolside room is mainly for the convenience of children's swimming. The swimming pool goes out from the balcony, and you can swim all the way to the large outdoor public swimming area.
I am also very grateful to Cathy of Ctrip. I am very attentive to our customers' follow-up care, and will know whether our check-in process is smooth, and what else we need to help. Very caring, very nice, very meticulous, so that the unpleasantness that was caused by a small episode in the check-in due to the large number of guests can be relieved in an instant! I also contacted the staff of the hotel, Daniel, to provide us with warm and comfortable service.
In the future, Ctrip will be the first choice to arrange itineraries, and Sofitel will definitely be chosen again as the destination for family travel

After looking for a location for a long time, I was told to queue up for check-in at 11 o'clock in the lobby, so we went to play Play at the playground, and have lunch by the way. The lunch in the amu*****t park is more of a Western meal. There are not many people. Except that the wonton noodles are not tasty, everything else is good. The children are 6 years old. No. It‚Äôs pretty fast. I played slides and beaches. There are not many buffets. Just eat and drink. The hotel‚Äôs cathy is very good and helps us solve many small problems. Many comments on the first floor of the room said it was humid, at least I didn‚Äôt come across it, I lived in 8112, decorated in Mediterranean style, a bit away from the beach, but quiet at night

msg:I live in Shanghai, I am looking for a hotel nearby. The following requirements can be met. First: away from the city, second: indoor and outdoor swimming pools; third: good service and convenient dining. At a macro level, this Sofitel meets the requirements. As an old-fashioned group, the service and supporting facilities will not be too bad. After check-in, the impressions are also better; although there are many guests, at least the arrangements are in order; the outdoor swimming pool and small beach are good. It makes people feel as good as in Sanya or Southeast Asia; the only thing to spit is that the water quality of the indoor swimming pool is poor, and some of the side areas are also growing mildew, so we really don‚Äôt let it go, so we all play in the outdoor swimming pool. . For dining, you can try a few restaurants, or drive outside to find a restaurant. In the breakfast bar of the hotel, the hardware of the coffee machine and the level of the chef's omelette can reflect one of the indicators of the hotel standard. This hotel is OK, the styles and types are qualified, and the taste is also acceptable. Overall it is worth a visit and enjoy the leisure life.

The suites booked after arriving at the hotel are generally very good, with free extra beds. , But the mattress of the extra bed is not very comfortable and a bit hard. The breakfast really had a lot of people as the comments said, the category was average, and there were long queues for omelettes. The child did not play in the water or sand when he was older. The indoor swimming pool is good. It will not be hot for swimming at night, and it will still be hot if you go during the day. There is a Sheshan Bay Plaza in the surrounding area, which is very convenient for eating and everything, and the taste is also very good.

Sofitel is the best one, and it is worthy of being a small Sanya in Shanghai. The swimming pool and beach loungers surrounding the hotel are the biggest highlights, making people feel like they have traveled to Sanya. The room facilities are also attentive, with children's slippers and children's toothbrushes. The waiter found that a corner of the bed sheet was wet when he delivered the slippers, so he took the initiative to change it, and wrote a note to remind him. In short, a perfect vacation experience, highly recommended.

What I was most dissatisfied with was the food and beverage. There were not many varieties of breakfast, and the taste was really unpleasant. I can't compliment the dinner either. The only good thing is that the cleaning lady is very dedicated. The overall feeling is that it is not worth the price at all!

msg:A very, very bad experience. Because of the epidemic, there is no place to go. Because of your swimming pool during the summer vacation, the price has gone up. Forget it, but the price is high due to the number of people, the service quality has plummeted. I checked in at the hotel at 2 o'clock and it took nearly 40 minutes to check in. Then I continued to wait for more than an hour before getting the room. During this period, no one came to inquire after 15:00, so I had to rely on myself to urge me. I finally checked into an executive room that was said to be an upgrade. The facilities were very old and the toilet was blocked. I stayed there for two days and it was blocked for two days. I really felt like I was at rock bottom. I called room service and the first thing I said was that I would help. You can forward the complaint, and before the problem is reported, can I send you a cake? What is this operation? There was dust under the bed in the room, there was no tea bag when I wanted to drink tea, and I didn‚Äôt even refill the shower gel for two days in a row. Is it worthy of your five-star title? I complained to Ctrip, and Ctrip said they would contact the hotel to give feedback. Your business is really good. I checked out for more than a day without any contact. I am speechless. I will never go to this kind of hotel again!

Having stayed for the third time, the baby loves the pool. It can be soaked all day, relatively relaxed and easy for parents to take beautiful pictures.
Summer stays are still very busy, but the front desk staff has hardly heard of the constant handling.
The buffet at night is much praised, one more barbecue than last year. The staff grilled at the edge of the pool and took it into the restaurant for guests to choose from. I ate three chicken wings, it was too delicious, and there were many other kinds of drinking water. Worth staying, come back next year.

The front desk took the initiative to say that they had upgraded the club room, but I didn't know what the difference was from the original deluxe double room. When I walked in, I saw a painting of a man and a woman hugging each other hanging on the wall. My daughter, who is in first grade, asked me more than once during the three days she stayed at the hotel what I drew. Children's Paradise charges a daily fee. Each room with a room card can only purchase one ticket at a preferential price, and the ticket is valid for the same day. The discounted ticket price is 80 yuan for one large and one small, the original price is 120 yuan. The children's paradise is honestly not that good, and the price/performance ratio is not high compared with the ones in shopping malls. I read the reviews before checking in and there was no mention of charges. I guess the reviews were based on reviews. The closet light in the room was broken and couldn't be turned off. I had to ask the maintenance man to turn it off the next day for fear of waking the children. The most outrageous thing was that the room service rang at around 9am the next morning to ask if she wanted to clean. She only rang once and she opened the door before I could even get to the door. The children were still sleeping and I was still dressed. I also felt very embarrassed. As a Shanghainese, I am sorry to have stayed in such a five-star hotel in Shanghai.

After entering, my 7-year-old niece saw the painting on the wall and asked what it was. I know that the so-called club room is just some pornographic pictures hanging on the wall; there is no WIFI in the room. After asking, I was told that there is no WiFi on the entire floor. The solution is to use the one upstairs or downstairs... The bathroom facilities are old and the water in the shower is very hot. It's small, and the water temperature is hot and cold; even if the room price doesn't include breakfast, even the children's paradise charges guests a hefty price! This is the hotel‚Äôs facilities and parent-child signature! Why isn't the price for the children's playground clearly stated on the booking page? There are no slippers for changing in the swimming pool changing room, so you can only go barefoot the whole time... Five-star resort hotel... haha... I won't come back, there will be no next time!

He directly upgraded the room to a poolside room and the other to a suite on the 4th floor. Personally, I prefer the poolside room on the first floor. It's so convenient. It feels like a small Sanya if you just shoot. But the breakfast is really like everyone's online reviews, the variety is not rich enough, and there is no small wonton. The last thing is to say that it does not affect the good mood at all. For girls, taking pictures in the swimming pool is more important than what they eat. Thanks again to the little brother at the front desk!

msg:I booked the poolside room in advance. I wanted to arrive early, and I would take the kids to the Smurf Paradise after the luggage was left. Unexpectedly, there will be a room available at 11:30. The poolside room is still very good, connected to the poolside area pool, so not many people use the pool. I read the reviews before and said it was old, maybe I didn't have high expectations before moving in, but after moving in, I thought it was OK. Next time I come, I will choose to stay in a poolside room. After all, it is the swimming pool. Just remember to lock the balcony door when you go out and sleep.
The hotel has self-financed skiing and self-financed horseback riding. The riding experience is particularly great. I experienced it with my children and interacted with each other. These two halls have contact numbers and WeChat, so you can make a reservation in advance. The hotel also has a parent-child restaurant, which may charge a fee, so the area is still not small, and you can take your children to eat here.
The hotel also has a swimming pool and sand. The hotel control in this area should be fine, because when you enter, a service staff will ask you the room number. If you just check out, you won't be able to enter after three o'clock that day.
The breakfast buffet is less optional. The dinner buffet is ok, with red and white wine. I wanted to take my kids to experience the other two a la carte restaurants, but the distance was a little far away and I didn't go. Lollipops and ice creams are also sold in the lobby area.
For service, I took the child with my suitcase and bag alone. When I got off the bus, the service staff would help to take it down. When I left, the service staff was nearby and did not help to pick up the car. Although I can also carry it, I bring it with you. My child, if you can help me, I am very grateful.
The overall check-in experience is very good, but the poolside room is strongly recommended. Little Sanya can't talk about it, but at least it feels like a holiday.

msg:From the hotel where my daughter can walk, I have to check in every year. I looked at it from the preferred resort hotel to the tasteless facilities. It was too old except for the good maintenance of the outdoor swimming pool. I remembered that it has not been overhauled. This stay on the clothesline is a broken phone and The network is also bad. I used the mobile phone to call the switchboard. The result is only to repair the clothesline. After the room service restaurant switchboard is basically unavailable, it is either no one or busy. There are only glasses and coffee cups in the room... ... As a five-star hotel, I can only say that the service is almost non-existent although it feels worse every year

msg:Take the child for the second time, and it will take one hour by car to arrive. The check-in procedure was completed quickly and the room was upgraded. I was very happy. The main thing that attracted me to this hotel was the swimming pool, so as soon as I checked in, I took my children to the swimming pool, first to the indoor swimming pool. There are not many people in the indoor swimming pool, and I saw a swimming coach teaching children to swim. The indoor swimming pool must wear a swimming cap, otherwise it will not be launched. So I spent 50 yuan on a swimming cap at the registration office. No swimming cap is required for outdoor swimming pools.
      The dinner buffet starts at 5:30 in the evening. I bought an adult‚Äôs buffet dinner in the hotel‚Äôs shopping mall, and I was engaged in an event called "Xunwei Japan". It was 218 yuan per person, and 1.2 to 1.5 meters for children were half price based on the original price, which was 164 yuan. The dinner varieties are rich, Japanese and Chinese. There are sashimi, and there are many kinds of sushi. I ate a lot of crab feet and sushi. Salmon did not dare to eat, it is better to be cautious during the epidemic stage. The ice cream tasted good and delicious. I took two balls.
      After eating breakfast the next morning, (the breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, the variety is also rich), pick up the car from the parking lot and take the children to the nearby Guangfulin Cultural Site to visit. I want to remind you that you must first go to the front desk to get the parking ticket, otherwise you will be a little troublesome when you go out of the gate.

The waiter in the cafeteria saw me coming for a meal with a child and took me to a convenient location. I left the iPad in the room when I checked out and contacted me immediately. thank you very much!
The only downside is that the poolside room may be on the first floor plus the recent rainy season, the room is a bit damp. There was a large pool of mildew on the inside of the bathroom basin, because I had no time to communicate with the cleaning lady when I was playing with my children alone. Hope housekeeping can improve after seeing the comments.
In addition, the resort hotel family swims every day, and there are a lot of clothes to dry. I hope to add a wooden drying rack on the balcony, which many Sanya resort hotels have.

In summer, we recommend the Smurfs Paradise (full indoor air-conditioning) and the Guangfulin Museum, which are all within half an hour's drive from the hotel.

The hotel has indoor swimming pools, outdoor artificial beaches and paddling pools. The hotel provides a lot of inflatable boats for rent, the cost is 100 yuan / half an hour. The buffet in the morning is average, it is recommended to go to eat early, there are a lot of people after 9 o'clock. There are also several outsourced restaurants on the first floor, among which the Japanese Blue Restaurant and B1's indoor skiing are more distinctive.

It is not the ordinary coffee that is not a buffet. My father said that the concentration is different. Check out at 12 o‚Äôclock. It‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs a little bit late. Luggage can be left in the lobby for people to watch. Now, you can continue swimming outdoors until 3 pm, which is really goodüëç

One point is for food and beverage. The buffet in the evening cost 328 per person. It was really the worst buffet I have ever eaten. There was no good food at all. What‚Äôs more, the disgusting thing about this hotel is that the food was never served. The salmon chef deliberately cut the fish at the slowest speed. , so that everyone can‚Äôt get it at all, and they only give one or two slices to each person. If you are not sincere, don‚Äôt do a buffet. There are very few varieties in the evening, and the food is not delicious.
The breakfast the next morning was exactly the same. One time, the noodles were gone and no longer provided. Another time, the toppings were gone and they were not replenished. Another time, the porridge was gone, and the other time, the sauce was gone. This was the first time I had experienced so many hotel breakfasts. I've seen all sorts of out-of-stock items, and I feel like I'll ask you to come early tomorrow because they're out of stock. The hotel just saves money if it can, and doesn't give it if it can't.
Sheshan is originally located in a relatively remote location, and most of the food and entertainment are in the hotel. Therefore, the food and drinks are so unpalatable that I feel it is a negative score overall. I will not visit again, and I will not recommend it to my friends.

No complaints as long as you can get off work normally. Everything else is handled in accordance with hotel regulations. Very tough attitude. The people in the breakfast restaurant felt the same way. It's up to you to ask others. this is not OK. That outsourcing. Things that are clearly one's own rights are made to look like they are being given away.
Nothing to say about the beach and swimming pool. The child is very happy. Of course it's not possible to borrow floats from the indoor swimming pool at night.
The breakfast was really bad. real. Unpalatable. The quality is very poor. There is nothing to eat. We still paid 150 real money per person, three people paid 600. Really. Speechless. I really can‚Äôt stop talking about that bacon. It's all processed meat. You can make it taste better. Cold and hard. The staff is either adding coffee machines or replacing them. It just feels very old.
If there's a sale, go for it. Go for anything below 800. Don't go if it's more than that. Will vomit blood

1. The hotel‚Äôs signature beach swimming pool is not as big as it looks in the pictures. On the first day of check-in, a child scratched his foot there and it bled all over the place. Another child scratched his foot the next day. It was so hurt that we didn‚Äôt dare to take the baby to the swimming pool on the third day. I really don't know how the hotel management does this.
2. The service is poor. The phone number at the front desk is always unreachable. I haven‚Äôt tried it late at night or early in the morning. Almost all the waiters I met on the road turned a blind eye with expressionless expressions. During breakfast, I asked the chef (not the waiter) where the soy sauce was, but they ignored me. I bought something and sent it to the concierge by express delivery, but I couldn't find it all afternoon.
3. The temperature in the hotel is too low, and the air conditioning in many places is very strong, especially in the breakfast area. I am worried that children wearing summer clothes will catch cold. It feels like the temperature there is set to match the waiters. They are all wearing suits and uniforms.
4. The breakfast is poor, there are not many items, and there are always long lines in many places, such as omelettes and toast. There are quite a few coffee machines, so there‚Äôs basically no need to queue.
5. The good thing is that everything is delivered very quickly, and the uncle at the pool desk is cheerful and friendly.

Except for the riverside room that can step into the swimming pool, there is almost no satisfactory place. The dirty carpets in the public areas point to unknown places. Signs, extra beds and quilts randomly displayed in the corridor, the musty smell in the room, the wardrobe light that flashes all night, the bathroom that ticks all night, the buffet restaurant where the food items shrink on weekends, and you have to carry the plate wherever you go. It can only be made by calling the chef to show up from the kitchen. There are no towels in the swimming area. We can only rely on room towels weighing more than a pound. There is no place to cool down. There is nothing in the minibar except two bottles of Chunyue. The small refrigerator is not refrigerated. I find it hard to believe it. This is a resort hotel that costs nearly 3,000 yuan per night. In fact, when I saw the hotel offering Pure Joy, I knew that the standard of the hotel was not high. After all, I didn't expect it to be so hard to describe. What's going on with you friends who have given me first-rate reviews?

msg:It's completely like there is something wrong with my facilities, the damage to my furniture is my fault, and it's your fault that you didn't raise the issue when you moved in. You didn't call for maintenance when you moved in, but it was completely irrelevant when you mentioned it afterward. I checked in on August 22nd and checked out at around 7 a.m. the next day. I was in a hurry because I had something to do. I ironed my clothes at night. I found that there was nothing wrong near the wardrobe, so I put them next to the kettle to iron them. Since it was not smooth, I put the kettle on. I put the iron on the table, and then immediately picked it up and put it on the ironing board to iron it. It was my operation problem that caused a white mark on the table, but within a few seconds, there was only a white mark. Marks, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to this matter, because you put the kettle on the table and said that if it is burned for a long time, there will be marks, and the table itself is also cracked and the paint is peeling off. The manager on duty called me the next day after check-out and told me to pay compensation. He said that there was a mark on the room and the room could no longer be occupied by guests. I said that if the table top is cracked and the paint is peeling off, guests could be accommodated, but if there was a mark on it, it would not be possible. Then he said no. , the claim must be settled, and then the loss will be determined. Later, I called again and said it was not easy. I asked my colleagues in the engineering depar**ent to paint the paint. The minimum compensation was 300 yuan. They were very lenient. They did not ask you to pay for the cabinet. You just put the kettle on it and used it, so you were not worried about the temperature being too high. Gao Well, just say two different things, you have to pay, and then tell me directly that you paid with Ctrip QuickPass, and I will deduct the money directly. I really want to ask, your room costs more than 1,600 yuan per night. The drain in the bathtub is broken. How dirty is the balcony floor? The carpet in the room is full of dust. The tabletop is cracked and peeling. If you choose you, you will get service. Then I raised various questions on the phone. Their attitude was that if you didn't raise it when you lived in the house, we wouldn't admit it if you raise it now. They also told me on the phone, why don't you report it to the engineering depar**ent? If there is a problem, we will come back and repair it. I want to ask you to repair it after I take a shower at night. There are also all kinds of quibbles, saying that the room was cleaned well and it was checked by the housekeeping manager. There will be no problems. Then I want to ask about the broken drain and the carpet. Damn it, do I have to pay for it? There is also an epidemic check at the door that is ineffective. The entrance next to the door can directly enter the hotel without any safety settings. There is also the basis for the 300 yuan. One coat of paint costs 300 yuan. Your five-star labor is more expensive.

Two waiters in a row pointed to the wrong room location, and I had to go around twice to find the room. In the room The signal is poor and the wifi is useless; except for a small beach, there is no other highlight, not recommended! ! !

msg:Very bad. One of the worst five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. The hygiene is very poor. There are fingernails on the floor. The bathroom and bathtub are so dirty. I didn‚Äôt even go in all night. Before going to bed, I asked if there were any mosquito coils. They said they would automatically light them up. I was bitten ten times in the middle of the night. I asked for several packages of mosquito coils at around 2 o'clock and waited at the door for more than ten minutes before they were delivered. In short, one word: poor. Bad facilities, dirty hygiene, and poor service.

msg:The service is very rubbish, the smell in the lobby is terrible and no one is there to answer the questions. This is all a small matter. After waiting in line for half an hour to check in, I was told that I could not enter the store at the appointed time, which was delayed for more than 2 hours. As a result, it was almost dark when we checked into the resort hotel, so we couldn't do anything at all. Not only that, the quilt and pillows in the room were also very damp. I think this is a room standard for 200 yuan a night. I feel deeply deceived. I will try my best to discourage my friends from going to this hotel again.

msg:The worst experience in a domestic five-star hotel. The hotel service attitude was indifferent and perfunctory. I felt that asking them was an intrusion. I rang the cleaning bell before dinner. When I returned to the hotel at 9 o'clock, it was not cleaned. When I asked the reason, I was told that it was because it had been cleaned in the morning. I waited at the door for more than ten minutes with my room card invalid. I asked her why she came so late. She was told that she was new and she didn‚Äôt know the situation. What made me sick the most was that the doorman was indifferent when he saw the luggage of Chinese people. After arriving at Laowai, my subjective initiative was completely different. It turns out that luggage can be sent to the room, but I always thought that this five-star hotel did not have this service. Breakfast and parent-child facilities are very ordinary and have no highlights.

msg:I have been staying here since the trial opening, and the service has gotten worse every time. I went to the Western restaurant for lunch at noon, and I went there a little faster. There were not many people eating, and the service staff left the utensils everywhere. When I took the bowl, I forgot the spoon. I asked for it several times and only brought it back. One, we are obviously two people sitting and dining, and the two-room buffet dinner is marked as 4 large and 2 small. When we two adults went to dine, we told the front desk and the foreman that there were two adults and two children under 120 who were not there yet. Come, they all said it was marked, but when we went back, the adults didn't take anything to eat because they were not hungry. Two children were eating. A service staff came over and said directly what do you mean? If the adults don't eat, the children have to pay for it. Yes, the tone is very unpleasant. The sentiment is that we directly let the children come and eat. Is this the etiquette taught in five-star hotels? We communicated with colored glasses without asking clearly. The children fell asleep after checking out the next day. The air conditioner was very cold while waiting for the bus. I asked the staff to borrow a towel to cover the children. They actually said that you had already checked out and we couldn't keep watching. This answer made me stunned on the spot. Is this a five-star hotel? Ordinary hotel staff will come over to ask if they need help when they see children wearing skirts and talking under the air conditioner. I just want to ask the hotel management how you train your employees.

msg:I used to come to Sofitel every summer vacation, but my stay this time was really disappointing. First of all, it is understandable that the hotel is old, after all, it has been there for so many years, but you have to clean it up, it is not a B&B! ! There was a bunch of hair in the bathroom as soon as I entered the room, and the floor was not cleaned. There were fewer and fewer breakfast items, and there was nothing new at all. When I checked out, the front desk didn't know if it was an intern or something. After working on it for a long time, I couldn't help but ask. After a while, he said he didn't know how to cancel the pre-authorization. I said, shouldn't you pull the consumption list first? A waiter next to me said why don‚Äôt you take orders for customers? It was already summer vacation and it was a weekend, and there were so many people that we even had an intern at the front desk. He was so drunk! My husband said it was too bad and damaged the Sofitel‚Äôs brand, so why should a room like this be charged 3,588 a night? ? Won‚Äôt come again anyway!

msg:I really can‚Äôt compliment the hotel service. I asked twice how to get to the hotel swimming pool. They always asked me to go to the lobby for consultation. Are you not a staff member of this hotel? Don‚Äôt even know the most basic facility routes? Secondly, the hotel's breakfast is really mediocre and tastes bad. The TV playing in the restaurant is still flashing snowflakes. As an old five-star hotel, the catering standard is really poor. Finally, the bathroom in the room is old, hot and cold water alternates suddenly and is difficult to adjust; the pillows are too high, making it impossible to sleep well. Although I will not come back to Sofitel again in the future, I still hope that the hotel can improve.

msg:It‚Äôs as good as ever. I often bring my kids here. I love the beach and pool service here. Compared to before the name change, I feel more caring. I used to order a takeaway to buy some sunscreen, snacks, etc., and they couldn‚Äôt be delivered to the lobby. It's very convenient. The little brother who welcomes guests, the uncle who stores luggage, the check-in staff at the front desk, and the aunts who clean the room are all very nice. They will take the initiative to help and will come again

msg:During the peak season of summer vacation, I booked a superior room in advance and checked in on Saturday, which also included buffet dinner and buffet breakfast for two. The price/performance ratio is not bad.
As soon as you enter the hotel, there is a bright and bright lobby with sofa seats for resting. There is also free tea at the door. When you arrive at the hotel around 10:30, there are very few people who don‚Äôt need to queue up. Although you can‚Äôt check in early, it‚Äôs understandable during peak hours, and the front desk My sister was very enthusiastic. When she learned that we were going to Maya, she also reminded many people that it might not be possible to park late, so she decisively called a car to go there.
After playing Maya well, I happened to go back to the hotel to have a buffet dinner. The children are taller than me, so I added some money. The dinner variety is quite complete, and everything that should be there is available. The buffet breakfast on the second day is very rich, and you can save money after lunch.
The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and beach, and the staff distributes swimming shoe covers, which is very considerate. There is also a doll pool. I regret that I went to Maya on the first day, so I might as well spend a day in the hotel's swimming pool.
The hotel room is quite big, and the bathroom is also spacious, but the air conditioner is a bit loud. The double bed would be better, and it's a bit cramped for one big and one small to fall asleep. I am very satisfied with the accommodation experience this time, and I highly recommend visiting during the summer vacation. Because I went to Maya on the first day, I haven't experienced the hotel facilities well yet. The staff are very enthusiastic about the service. I plan to come here once a year and treat it as a vacation.

msg:The front desk is very good. We checked in early and upgraded us to a lake view room based on the reservation rate. Five stars for the front desk!
It is very suitable for taking children to play in the water during the summer vacation, and the facilities and services are in place. There is a TV room in the cafeteria. When the parents pick up the food, the children can temporarily store it, haha!
There is a suggestion, the TV in the room is too old! It's all ‚ùÑÔ∏è open, you can't watch it at all! As a parent-child hotel, not to mention putting on children's TV programs, at least the TV can be clearer.
