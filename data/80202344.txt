msg:The experience at Luna Hotel was absolutely amazing! From the moment I arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure a seamless check-in process and provided valuable local insights and recommendations. The ambiance of the hotel is top-notch, offering a tranquil and cozy atmosphere reminiscent of a hidden paradise. What's more, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they use Bvlgari amenities, adding a touch of luxury to the stay. Overall, the attention to detail and exceptional service at Jiurang Hotel exceeded my expectations, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable stay in Yangshuo.

msg:When we travel on vacation, we make selecting the right hotel our utmost priority. Even though we stayed at the Jora for one night because our transportation arrangement got canceled and we needed a place to stay an extra night, my beloved and me sort of regretted not stay at the Jora Hotel for our entire 3 nights in Yangshuo; our stay there was absolutely perfect in every aspect! The hospitality, cleanliness, the facilities, and breakfast has us desperately wanting to go back to Yangshuo just so we can spend a few more nights there. 
Thank you so much!

msg:I have been looking forward to this staycation for a long time! The location is relatively remote, and it takes about 40 minutes by taxi from Yangshuo Station. After arriving, I started to enjoy the service. The housekeeper and staff are very enthusiastic and will reply to any needs in seconds~ The environment is great, the small courtyard is lush and green, and it is comfortable to look at the mountains on the balcony or the top floor. Then I especially like the Guilin rice noodles for breakfast. The way of eating it first dry mixed and then adding chicken soup is just what I want. As soon as it was served, I smelled the smell of the brine and knew it must be delicious. The beef brisket noodles are also good! I don’t think you have to go anywhere to check in here. For example, the commercial West Street across the river is actually quite boring. It’s great to stay here for two days. Finally, thank you very much to the housekeeper Xiaotang for his meticulous care!

Service: I must say that the service is really good, and the one-to-one service of the housekeeper system meets all needs. My father wanted to go fishing very early, and he would help prepare feed and equipment, and the fisherman was very happy!
Environment: The environment is great! It is very suitable for taking pictures, and the free travel photography service can be taken in the hotel. I especially recommend the moon-watching terrace on the top floor, which is very suitable for watching the sunset.
Facilities: The facilities in the room are very complete, even including facial masks! This is really thoughtful! Drinks and snacks at the bar are free.
Hygiene: The sanitation is very clean. Although there are many insects on the mountainside, the mosquito-proof facilities are also complete.

msg:Compared with the hotel I chose for two nights, it is worth recommending.
Small and well designed, it can basically achieve a view at every step, and every flower arrangement is real.

Although the view from the balcony of this hotel is not the best.
But what is important to me is that the room quality is satisfactory. The shower is the same as the Hansgrohe one at home, the bedding is very comfortable, the toiletries are Bulgari, and the hair dryer is definitely Dyson...
Others are very basic, with unlimited drinking water, free drinks and snacks in the refrigerator, and someone will reply to you when you add a butler 24 hours a day.

If you have high requirements for accommodation, choose this one and you won’t step on thunder.
It’s just that the cocktails in the small bar are 98 per cup, which is still quite expensive.

The hotel uses top-notch hardware, which I will not elaborate on one by one. The sanitation is very clean, the environment is really good, and the service is considerate.
1. The hotel is private and quiet, without the noise of other hotels, which is very suitable for vacation.
2. The hotel staff is serious and considerate. The service starts from booking the hotel. After arriving at the hotel, every staff member of the hotel greeted us with a friendly smile and gave detailed recommendations for travel guides. It is really worry-free that I don’t have to make a guide myself.
3. The hotel has its own restaurant. In addition to breakfast, you can also order Chinese food and dinner. The price is affordable and the taste is also very good.
4. The hotel also has some rich entertainment facilities. You can have afternoon tea, and there are small bars, swimming pools, fishing and so on in the evening. The elderly and children will not feel bored without leaving the hotel.
By the way, there is one more thing I almost forgot. The hotel is just opposite West Street. It is very convenient and interesting to take a ferry there. It has been too long since I have seriously reviewed it. I want to say too much, all from the heart!

If you drive here, there is a special hotel parking lot at the door. The housekeeper will contact us in advance to meet us at the door. When we get off the car, we will help with the luggage and send it directly to the room. You need to swipe your card to enter the hotel. This is very private and ensures the safety of the guests. The hotel facilities are very complete. It can be said that there is everything you need, including restaurants, bars, book bars, outdoor swimming pools, and outdoor camping. Tea sets are provided so that you can come and make tea, chat, and be in a daze. A lot of Hanfu and ethnic costumes are also provided for taking pictures, and you can even go fishing, etc. The most surprising thing is the many small details in the room. The mini bar and welcome fruits are very rich, and the Bulgari toiletries are also very tasteful. The room is thoughtfully prepared with facial masks and even small bags for women's products. In general, this price is really worth the money. If I have the opportunity to come to Yangshuo again, I will definitely choose to stay here!

Entering the hotel was like entering a paradise. The rooms are equipped with Bulgari toiletries/Dyson hair dryers, which are top-notch configurations. Xiao 9 recommended many delicious and fun attractions. I will recommend it to my family and friends, and I will definitely come again next time I come to Yangshuo!

You can see the mountain view and Li River from the window, and you can see the rolling mountains while lying on the bed! And away from the downtown and the hustle and bustle, I had a good sleep! I have to give a thumbs up to Jiurang's Guilin rice noodles! The hotel's meals are also authentic and delicious, and the beer fish is great. It is only across the river from West Street, and you can walk to West Street by ferry across the river. After a day of sightseeing, you can still feel the warmth and comfort of home brought by the hotel's butler service when you return to the hotel. Great!

He answered my questions very patiently and helped me solve them. The housekeeper Xiaotang provided very good service. All my needs after arriving at the store were met. The service of the staff in all positions of the hotel was very good, and there was a car to pick me up at the ferry.
❤️The key point is that the room is very comfortable, and it is very user-friendly from the layout to the hardware facilities to the daily necessities. The bed is like magic, and I fell asleep as soon as I lay down. There is a beautiful afternoon tea, snacks, drinks, milk, Bulgari toiletries, and clothes drying racks. There are masks, although I didn't use them, and there are sanitary napkins, although I didn't use them. There are fruits and knives, makeup mirrors, shoe horns, umbrellas, and hairspray can be rented for free. Can you imagine? It has everything you can think of, and the details are touching.
❤️The breakfast is also delicious. As soon as you eat it, you can tell that the ingredients are very fresh and very good. The rice noodles are great! It's rare to have such delicious rice noodles in the hotel.
❤️Finally, let me talk about the environment. Although the hotel is in the village, the scenery is not very bad. We stayed in the Lanyue Mountain View King Room. From the balcony, we can see the mountains in the distance, and from the top of the sixth floor, we can see the Li River. Maybe it is not as good as those hotels that sell scenery, but I like quietness and seclusion. Sometimes I can hear birds singing. It is not noisy like those crowded hotels. Here I can completely empty my mind. In addition, the hotel has some small corners with a sense of design, which I also explored. 😄
Thanks to Jiurang for the hospitality, we had an unforgettable trip to Guilin. 🌹🌹

The hotel is in a village, surrounded by mountains and trees. It is very quiet and you can hear the chickens and dogs. The hotel is also very design-oriented and full of aesthetic a**osphere. Flowers can be seen everywhere, including in the rooms. It is said that they were planted by the aunts in the hotel. The quality of the room supplies is undoubtedly the best among the hotels I have stayed in. Although luxury hotels are not cost-effective, Jiurang has put a lot of effort in the details.

Throughout the check-in process, from Xiao Tang who checked in at the front desk to Xiao Jing when checking out, every staff member I met was very attentive and enthusiastic, and I could feel their sincere love for their work.

Finally, I would like to praise the breakfast. First of all, breakfast time is 7:30-11:00, which is especially friendly for people who want to sleep in. In addition, the taste, serving time, and presentation are all worthy of praise.

The hotel's butler service is very online and the response speed is very fast. As soon as we got off the bus, there were three concierges who helped us open the door and pick up our luggage. When we went to the front desk, the hotel saw that there were not many of us and upgraded us to a room type for free (very nice). The supplies in the room are all made from Bvlgari. Remember to ask the housekeeper to give you an extra set to take away when you leave the hotel, hahaha.

The road into the hotel is a bit mundane, but fortunately, you can go to the pier down the slope and take a bamboo raft directly to Yangshuo West Street in 3 minutes.

The catering is something we didn't expect. If I were to rate it based on taste and price, I would give it 9 points. Jiuliang’s beer fish is a must-try. The exquisite presentation does not affect the fusion of beer and pot gas.

Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Jiahao, who is very serious about his work and took the trouble to introduce us to various collection points and check-in points in the surrounding area! I will definitely come again with my family and children during the summer vacation!

The next day I immediately moved to Jiurang across the West Street. This is really the best choice for tourists who like quiet, and it is the best choice among the bustle. It's quiet, but you can overlook West Street and the Li River from the hotel's viewing platform. The most commendable thing must be Jiurang's service. The butler welcomed us in and saw us off, chatted with the elderly, recommended where to eat and play, went fishing in the hotel, and went for a walk along the Li River. It was all very pleasant. The hotel has restaurants and bars that can satisfy all your needs without leaving home. We are all very satisfied, and if we have enough time, we would like to come and stay for a week to deeply experience the local customs and customs of Yangshuo.

Every staff member is very warm and friendly. Even the little parrot in the hotel seems to be warmly welcoming our family. The Bulgari that uses room supplies is probably the only one in Guangxi. Will the service be poor in a hotel that can provide top luxury supplies? ? Of course not. I leisurely spent a few days in Yangshuo. With the recommendation of the butler, I ate very well every meal without stepping into any trap.

msg:I chose to travel to Yangshuo during the off-season, and the Jiuliang Hotel left a deep impression on me! Located across the West Street, the location is very high, and you can see the beautiful sunset, which makes you feel happy. And I also experienced a unique mode of transportation. I went to the pier on the Li River and took a ferry to the other side. The other side is the center of the county. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to West Street, which is quite special. The hotel staff's service is also very good. No matter what position they are in, they are very warm and friendly. My family members like it very much. The breakfast meals are particularly delicious, especially Guilin rice noodles. We didn't order oil tea, but the housekeeper actually gave us a bowl to try. We experienced the taste of "Chinese coffee", which was really good.

But here it was sunny every day, so I urgently needed some ice cream for breakfast. I asked the young lady for ice and she gave me a big bucket of ice, American-style frozen happiness. Following the trend, the kid next door ordered an Ultraman chiffon cake. It was crazy cute, really delicious, and very soft, not inferior to the ones sold outside.

At that time, the Hyatt name was indeed in line with international quality, but there were not many HYATT logos inside, making it more like a high-end B&B. It is also very pleasant to look up at the mountains, read books, drink tea and enjoy music in the clouds and rain. It's not far from my impression, but the road up the mountain is in a state of disrepair. I was a little confused when I first arrived. When I saw the gate and the waiting butler, it was clear what was going on.

The short distance from Longtoushan Pier to the hotel actually takes nearly an hour by taxi. We contacted the hotel customer service and provided us with a very convenient plan for arriving at the hotel. We paid a lot for our 2-day stay. Travel advice and contact information!
Room: We originally booked 1F and they upgraded us to a high floor. The facilities in the room are very good, and there are also yoga mats. It’s great, and we don’t have to stop exercising when traveling!
Meals: Breakfast is a la carte + buffet style. Guilin rice noodles are a signature feature. Panini-like sandwiches are delicious😋. I tried the oil tea, which has a bit of ginger flavor. It should be good to drink in cold weather! The bartending is good, it is said to be the best in Yangshuo. I originally wanted to try dinner, and I really wanted to try the Camellia Chicken after seeing the menu, but the schedule changed and I didn't try it.
Fireworks were set off at 10pm🎆, which made up for the regret that fireworks could not be set off in Shanghai during the Spring Festival. Overall, I was very satisfied with my two-day stay!

If we wanted to get out, we could only take the ferry not far from the hotel. The staff took the trouble to shuttle us back and forth between the ferry and the hotel every day. Compared to the hotel located on West Street, staying here is quieter and not far away.
When you check in, hotel employees will greet you at the door, help you with your luggage, and give you a general introduction to the hotel. When we were leaving, the housekeeper calculated the time and came to the door of the room to help us get our luggage. In the end, he waited with us at the door for half an hour for the car, which was very considerate.
The hotel breakfast is semi-buffet and semi-a la carte. My favorite breakfast rice noodles! If you want to have dinner at the hotel, you need to contact the butler for the menu in advance.
When walking in the hotel, the employees will take the initiative to say hello and say hello. When we set out to play, we met an employee and asked if we wanted to bring some water, and they took the initiative to help us get two bottles of water. The overall service awareness of the hotel staff is very strong!
In the evening, the hotel will have a fire on the grass, roast sweet potatoes, and show movies. Because it was the Chinese New Year, you could still see the fireworks set off by the hotel at 10 o'clock every day.
If I have a chance to come to Yangshuo next time, I will choose to come here again!

Compared with the Banyan Tree where I stayed before, the area and things to do are smaller, but the room scenery and the distance to the scenic spot are closer. It’s just that we don’t recommend coming back during the Spring Festival. Yangshuo can’t handle so many tourists and vehicles, and it’s basically impossible to go anywhere every day.

Unlike some hotels that are quiet in the bustle, Jiurang is in a village in the absolute sense, but it is not isolated from the city, and the transportation is very convenient. This allowed us to enjoy rare silence after staying in the hotel all day. This kind of tranquility can also be enjoyed on the balcony. When night falls, the lights in the distance and the looming mountains are both a landscape painting and a breath of life. You can stay in a daze for a long time.

Not to mention the facilities within the hotel. The lobby, tea room, restaurant, and book bar are all there, and they have a great sense of design, and the service level is always online. My wife said that the most delicious Guilin rice noodles are eaten in Jiurang. Just dress up and take photos, matching the hotel background. It's really winter, otherwise you can still swim.

We are not afraid of everyone’s jokes, we can enjoy the distant view in the hotel, and we sleep until we wake up naturally, so we don’t have much interest in the attractions that actually sell tickets. The hotel's excellent experience made us feel that every minute we spent in the hotel was worth it.

After three days in Yangshuo, one day and one night in Jiurang was the most relaxing and comfortable. Thank you Jiurang, this trip is well worth it.

There were not many people staying that day and it was very quiet. It felt like a Japanese resort at night. The design and decoration are very well done, the materials used have a high-end feel, and the details and finishing are well done by hand. Check-in type is Yunyin Lanyue Balcony King Room, 70 square meters, walk-in wardrobe, quality bathtub with bath salts, toiletries from Bulgari and Dyson hairdryer. Breakfast was included in the hotel room price, and I had Guilin rice noodles, tea, tofu juice. We also included five hotel travel photos for intensive editing, and gave us afternoon tea and ladies’ sparkling wine.

msg:I rarely write reviews, but this one is worth writing. Came here for SLH and it certainly didn't disappoint. I have stayed in many, many hotels, and I have always stayed at Marriott Titanium, IHG Diamond. I have to say that this hotel has the urge to be a golfer, and Hyatt's hotels are of better quality. The location of the hotel is very quiet, halfway up the mountain. It is small in size, with only more than 30 rooms. But it is rare that in this off-season, the staff are fully staffed and the service is very good. The housekeeper added WeChat communication needs in advance, helped us arrange our itinerary, and upgraded the room. The room is very comfortable and well designed, and breakfast is a la carte. Our stay was very comfortable. We originally planned to stay only one night and go to Liuzhou to eat snail noodles the next day. However, the feeling that exceeded our expectations made us decide to stay one more night and directly canceled the trip to Liuzhou. Moreover, the housekeeper specially arranged two nights Experience two different rooms. Generally speaking, the software and hardware are very good. It is a great experience to come here in the off-season and the price/performance ratio is also very high. I will come here again on my next vacation.

It is like a secret garden. It has successfully cultivated my son's interest in fishing. He catches fish quickly. The fish was healthy and clean, and the beer fish was processed at noon. It was the most authentic meal I had in Yangshuo for several days. The chef didn't know where he was from, so he couldn't thank him in person. The room has been upgraded to a parent-child view room. You can see the mountains from the balcony, which is so beautiful! I can’t say enough good things about the entire service. I’m grateful to have met such a good hotel in Yangshuo, and it left me with wonderful memories! Will bring friends here again

msg:A treasure hotel that makes people happy - Yangshuo Jiureang Luxury Hotel
I came to Guilin with my children and the elderly during the National Day holiday. Due to schedule issues, I could only stay in Yangshuo for one night. My friends unanimously recommended Jiurang, and it did not disappoint. 👍
[Location] It is located at the highest residential point in Yangshuo, only 1 kilometer away from the Li River and 2 kilometers away from the Longji Mountain Tunnel. The signs are clear and easy to find.
[Public Facilities and Environment] The decoration is very high-end, and the quality shows in the details! Jiurang is far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, hidden in a corner of the village, but as soon as you enter the gate, you will be amazed! Such a spacious venue and high-quality decoration are eye-catching! The flat stone paths, marble swimming pools, and rockeries and bamboos everywhere make you feel calm all of a sudden. From the reception hall to the guest rooms, they are all decorated with stone, and the flowers in the elevator room are changed every day and are so beautiful! There is a cafe (bar) where guests can chat and drink, and the environment is first-class! Although the restaurant is not big, it blends in with the beautiful scenery. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Li River while enjoying the delicious food. How wonderful! The most commendable thing is that Jiu Yang not only has its own parking lot 🅿️ but also has charging piles! Let guests who come by tram have no worries about charging!
[Room Facilities and Hygiene] Fully electronically controlled bedside console, reading lounge area, balcony tea seat, electric curtains, minibar (all snacks and drinks are free - I think even five-star hotels can't do this), super comfortable bedding ( I really want to take the pillow home!) Bathtub with aromatherapy bath salts, Bvlgari toiletries (smells great!) illy capsule coffee pot, etc... The hygiene is definitely worthy of praise👍Check the bedding when you enter the door Is there any hair on the ground? It’s really spotless. The towels and water cups have been disinfected and there is no odor, which makes me, who is a mysophobic person, feel at ease😁
[Service] This should be emphatically praised! All reception and service staff are well-trained, polite and professional, and are basically responsive to all requests! From every check-in and transportation tips provided by Xiaojiu butler when checking in, to the first cup of osmanthus tea given by the reception center service staff, every service staff encountered was enthusiastic and proactive. When seeing guests taking the initiative to say hello, they would take the initiative to ask if If you need help with your luggage, if you need a drink, and if you have extra expenses, you will be prompted proactively. Make people feel at home! If the child does not bring a swimsuit, it can be sold at the front desk; afternoon tea can be delivered to the room; in addition, free sparkling wine, travel photography service and turndown service are also provided! Super considerate! One more thing to say is that the food in the restaurant tastes great! The old people from the north were all full of praise👍Because I arrived late in the afternoon, I didn’t order until 3 o’clock. The chef added extra dishes, including boneless fish, mango shrimp balls, snails, garden vegetables and beef fried rice, all of which were eaten. 😁Breakfast is from 7 to 11 o'clock, very user-friendly! Guilin rice noodles, wontons and sandwiches are all super delicious, and the watermelon juice and cucumber juice are all freshly squeezed!
You can stay here for a whole day without getting bored! Have a wonderful time, stay in Jiurang, and feel the wonderful experience of physical and mental balance! Next time I go to Guilin, I will choose Jiuliang!

The hotel design is also high-end and elegant. Room supplies Dyson and Bvlgari toiletries. There are flowers everywhere! Not only does a private butler work one-on-one, the waiter also helps to hold the child when the child is running around. The service is comparable to Haidilao hahaha!

msg:It's different from what you imagined, and it's different from what you imagined. The hotel is surrounded by a primitive village in Yangshuo. The entrance and exit of the hotel is a mountain path without street lights. The mountains can be seen in the distance. It is far away from the busy attractions and Internet celebrity check-in places. The environment is extremely quiet. The only SLH member hotel in Guangxi also vividly demonstrates its "smallness" and "exquisiteness". The tableware is small, the meals are mini, and the portions are small, but the taste is still good; the hotel area is small, and the room is not big at 60 square meters. There is no spa or gym in the resort hotel, but the housekeeper provides meticulous service. , response speed, as well as various details of the hotel and supplies in the room, all can show its "small but luxurious and exquisite": 4 kinds of pillows can be chosen, Sealy's mattress, illy's capsule coffee machine, Baoge Liming green bath products, Dyson hair dryer, various free and delicious snacks in the minibar, and even my favorite if...I love the roses that bloom every day in the elevator. The overall style of the hotel is minimalist, quiet and far away from the busy city. You can get up early to make a cup of coffee, look at the mountains of Yangshuo from the balcony, smell the grass in the air, and the pace will slow down... very suitable for vacation. Thanks to the housekeepers for their attentive service and responsiveness to requests. Thanks to classmate Xiao Yang in the restaurant for giving free pastries to our children. In addition, Miss Li, the hotel’s travel photographer, also provided excellent service, punctual and efficient. In the end, I still hope that the hotel will get better and better, keep the standard up, and further improve the surrounding environment. It is best to have a SPA.

The hotel was at that time, and the housekeeper drove us to pick us up the next day, and the luggage was delivered directly to the room. When we entered the room, we were shocked by the scenery and high-end facilities of the hotel. What caught our eyes was the beautiful Yangshuo landscape, and the room included Baoge Lai laundry care, boss audio, automatic curtains, coffee machine, Dyson hair dryer, including drinks, mineral water, snacks, snacks, etc., each one can be seen that the hotel has carefully prepared and selected for us, and we immediately sat down to enjoy the cheesecake for afternoon tea. I made coffee with my own coffee machine. The room was filled with the aroma of coffee and was acid-free. The bath towels and bathrobes were clean and had the smell of sunshine. I experienced the hotel’s special dinner that day, oil tea chicken soup, and the beer fish was so delicious! The buffet breakfast on the first day was even more surprising. I recommend Guilin rice noodles, beef noodles, fresh meat wontons, white porridge, and porridge. The porridge is all fragrant, and the accompanying side dishes are all reduced in salt. They were so delicious that I didn’t eat them for lunch. ,Ha ha
There is also a mini bar, tea room, and mountain view from the balcony of the room that are very suitable for checking in and taking pictures, which is very photogenic!
Beautiful mountain scenery, as if I am in the mountains and rivers, stunning, comfortable, delicious, high-end facilities and considerate and high-quality services. I will choose Jiuliang next time I come to Yangshuo!

Different from the "coldness" of big-name hotels, it is also a hotel with "warmth". From managers to employees, every guest will be treated as a friend without any sense of distance. . It is particularly worth mentioning that Yangshuo is crowded with people everywhere during the National Day. The hotel will recommend some of its own "secret places" to hotel guests, including an ancient village, a section of the Li River, and a golden mountain. If you want to stay away from the hustle and bustle and not be disturbed, you can’t go wrong choosing this place!

As soon as you enter the lobby, the butler serves you warm jasmine tea. It has a faint scent of jasmine and is so delicious! During the stay, we were always responsive to all requests. Jiu Yang’s service was great, and there was even a turndown service at night! There are also welcome fruits, which are fully furnished! They are all big-name products, including Bvlgari toiletries, Dyson hair dryers, BOSE speakers, and Sealy bedding. It’s so comfortable to have a baby-like sleep! I really like the big bathtub. It’s really great that the hotel also provides travel photos. I will definitely bring my family to stay here next time I have a chance~

Location: Yangshuo is originally a small town. If you want peace and quiet, you can only live in a village. The location of this hotel is not very good, but it is comfortable and comfortable. The school opening sign is also very clear. Go to West Street and cross the ferry. It's also very convenient. The hotel will also drive to the pier, which is no problem at all.
Service: Great. If you have any questions, just send a message to the housekeeper. The reply is very timely. Also, they provide buckwheat pillows at home. When I woke up, I thought I was at home, and the hotel service details are very good. Only Feel it slowly after checking in
Facilities: The hotel is not big, but it is very fun. You can fish, feed fish, drink tea, take photos, etc. Children can play on the lawn. By the way, there are two parrots at the door, which makes people feel energetic when they enter.
Catering: A la carte system, this is my favorite mode. Many of their breakfasts are homemade, and the taste is back to nature. Especially the rice noodles are so delicious. They are all made with their own special brine and chicken soup. This should be Is this the best rice noodle in Guilin?

When you take your child to a restaurant to dine, the staff will take the initiative to take your child to the fish pond to feed the fish while waiting for the meal, and stay with them, which is a very considerate service. The food tastes good, light and restores the original taste of the ingredients. It is a very healthy cooking method and is very suitable for families with children to enjoy together. We also experienced fishing🎣 in the hotel. The fish we caught🐟 were directly handed over to the kitchen for processing. We had a very delicious fish soup for lunch, which the children loved very much. All in all, this is a great accommodation experience. Although it is not focused on families, it is really suitable for bringing children. Both adults and children will like it💕

As soon as we arrived at the door, the butler was waiting at the door, helping us with our luggage and welcoming us into the store. To be honest, the first It doesn't feel very luxurious at first glance, it feels a bit like a high-end homestay. But after entering, it suddenly became clear, the paradise, one step at a time, one step at a time, I deeply felt the low-key luxury, and the pictures were shared bit by bit without sorting.
Service: The air conditioner is very good, the door needs to swipe the room card to enter, it is very safe, Yangshuo has been surprisingly hot recently, when you check in at the door, there will be fresh osmanthus mineral water, which is quite delicate, the butler will show you around the hotel and explain the precautions for staying in the hotel Including places to eat etc.
Hygiene: After entering the room, I feel the small exquisite room, Bulgari full set, Dyson hair dryer, lily coffee machine, minibar to enjoy... The room is clean and comfortable, and the things used are of high quality. I feel that luxury is everywhere, and I pay special attention to it. Friends with details can really open this hotel.
Yangshuo is too hot and there are many people. When we go out to play and return to the hotel, it is as comfortable and warm as returning home. Every night when we come back, there will be oat milk on the bedside, and the room will be taken care of in a good night mode. very comfortable
Facilities: There is a swimming pool, a restaurant and a bar. We gave us cocktails for the ladies at night. The bar is very air-conditioned and the music is great! It is very comfortable to have a drink🥃 and relax. The design of the restaurant without main lights is very good, and the food is delicious. We decisively ordered two meals in a row, and the price is acceptable. The breakfast variety is quite rich. Except for the bread, salad, and freshly squeezed juice, the rest are ordered. It is very careful and delicious. We stayed for two nights and deeply felt the quality and luxury of the hotel. The hotel also has introductions and some small experiences Activities, such as the hand-ground coffee experience, the waiters will say hello when they meet, the butler can help you buy tickets when you go to the scenic spot, and all the services you want are available here. These actions have made us feel the warmth of home in the hot Yangshuo, and we will do it next time. Will definitely stay at JORA! ps: Their desserts are top-notch delicacies that must be tasted.

The scenery is like the Peach Blossom Spring written by Mr. Tao Yuanming, with winding paths leading to secluded areas, accompanied by villages and beautiful landscapes. If you have any needs during your stay at the hotel, you can contact the housekeeper Xiao 9 and provide a series of travel consultations, giving you a good stay experience. When you come to Guilin, this restaurant in Yangshuo is really good.

msg:Why do you want to go to Guilin?
Since we were young, we have read about Guilin’s beautiful scenery in books, appreciated the green mountains and green waters on RMB, and heard bursts of Liu Sanjie’s singing in countless programs...
It seemed like a dream all the time. There was no hustle and bustle there, just mountains and hills, the winding Lijiang River, and those people who could clearly feel their joy and joy even if you couldn't understand them. Happy songs.
Guilin, dream, we finally meet!

The young lady who picked us up drove us to our destination. It turned out that we knew for the first time that Guilin’s landscape is the best in the world, Yangshuo’s landscape is the best in Guilin, and the essence of Guilin’s landscape is in Yangshuo. Just like Guilin is like a natural treasure hidden in China, far away from the hustle and bustle, our destination is like a natural treasure hidden in Guilin, not in the busy city, but hidden in the mountains.

Since you come to Guilin, you are walking back to nature. Since you are coming to Guilin, you are walking into dreams and heading towards a place where the soul can be quiet. After twists and turns, we walked into a forest trail, and from here we officially started looking for Jiu soil. Bamboo groves on both sides, old adobe houses, chickens, dogs, children in twos and threes, and mothers-in-law walking on the road with farm tools. Wow, where are we? Is it Mr. Wu Liu’s paradise?

Walking to the seemingly roadless mountainside, this place is called Aotoujia Village of Dongling Community. Climbing up a slope - it suddenly becomes enlightened! Jiurang has arrived.

When you open the door and come in, you will find a completely different world in sharp contrast with the natural primitive style outside. On the water of the lotus pond, there are black tiles and white walls, the green mountains in the distance serve as a painting screen, and the white clouds in the sky serve as the background. Ha, we in the north can only collect a small stone, a leaf, and moss to make a bonsai to decorate our cement house. But in front of us, it's just the other way around. There are mountains, trees, water, clouds, and sky everywhere, and scenery everywhere, every step of the way. Instead, this building has become an embellishment in this natural landscape. For us people from the north - too luxurious.

After checking into the room, I opened the window and looked out the window. I really didn’t need calligraphy and paintings to decorate it. The clouds and mountains outside the window were the best paintings. When I woke up at 6 o’clock and sat on the balcony, I saw the new scenery after the rain. The mountains were behind the clouds and the rain turned into clouds. It was so misty that for a moment I didn’t know what night or day it was, I was in the dream world. The windows of the restaurant have also become picture frames. When you look over, there is a vertical version of a picture of green mountains and green bamboos. Outside the window of the bar is no exception, there is a picture of listening to frogs in a lotus pond.

If we must come to Guilin once, then this time we will come to the destination of Guilin. During the day, we went to see mountains and rivers, and then came back to Jiurang. Haha, we were still in the mountains and rivers. I don’t dare to stay in Guilin for a long time. After a long time, I will be reluctant to leave. Goodbye Guilin, goodbye Jiurang, and look forward to seeing you again.

It is very close to West Street and Shili Gallery. It is very convenient to visit during the day; come back in the afternoon You can also take your children to swim in the hotel. At night, we found a lot of surprises here. There is a big brother snail trying to climb the wall, and Mr. frog 🐸 at the foot of the jade rabbit. We also caught a super big grasshopper 🦗, which is full of harvest. You can't go out on rainy days. There is a pond behind the hotel where you can take your children fishing🎣. The children are super satisfied~
It is very quiet here, it feels like a paradise in the secluded city, escaped from the high-rise buildings, and enjoys the landscape, vegetation, flowers and birds, fish and insects here...

There's so much to say,

1) You can choose pillows when you check in. We chose buckwheat pillows and latex pillows. The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and I fell asleep in seconds for two days.

2) Washing is from Bulgari

3) You can rent ethnic costumes to take pictures in the hotel, or you can ask the traveler to take photos at your door and get 5 photos. The remaining 20 sheets.

4) The scenery in the evening is very beautiful, and the best view is at the restaurant.

5) The location is very close to West Street, but you need to cross the river. Usually, you can rent a battery car from the hotel, and return it before 10:00 pm for 50 a day. Or the hotel will send it to the pier, and it will take you 5 minutes to walk across the river to West Street.

In short, it is still very recommended, the king of cost performance.

After I brought it into the hotel, I realized that there was something wrong with it. It was really a scene every step! When checking in in the lobby, sweet-scented osmanthus mineral water is served to relieve the heat in an instant. The housekeeper explains the various facilities and precautions of the hotel. The room is satisfactory. The toiletries are a full set of Bulgari, Dyson hair dryer, imported coffee machine, welcome fruit, afternoon And in the evening, imported chocolate, mineral water, and oat milk are delivered to the room, and all kinds of drinks and snacks in the minibar are free. The breakfast is semi-buffet, not many varieties, the staple food needs to be ordered (unlimited), bread, fruit, various beverages, coffee, self-service Guilin rice noodles is great, I ate two servings by myself, Chinese food beer fish, snail stuffed recommend! Have a drink at the hotel bar in the evening, all kinds of cocktails and whiskey are delicious. It really deserves to be the No. 1 [strong] hotel in Yangshuo. Every waiter in the hotel greets each other warmly. If there is any problem, they can reply to WeChat at any time. In short, Jiuyang is a low-key luxury, the first choice for vacation !

msg:Choose Jiuyang,

The hotel is the only hotel in Yangshuo that has joined the luxury boutique resort hotel alliance. Both the hotel hardware and the service software are impeccable. Here is a list for everyone to make it easier for future tourists to choose:
1. Service. If there were more stars, I would give more than 5 stars.
The staff here don't care when they see you in need
What kind of job (she) was, the first reaction at that time was to give
Customers solve problems. Meeting guests in the hotel, every staff member
The staff will greet you with a friendly smile and feel very warm. (It reflects that the hotel training is in place, and the care for employees is also very good. Let the employees treat the hotel guests as family members)
2. The location of the hotel environment belongs to a mountainside village, with different scenery. In addition, it can be seen that the hotel has spent a lot of thought on the external layout and settings in a limited location.
3. The soft decoration of the room, the spare parts of the water bar and the bathroom, the configuration is perfect, the only defect is that the room is a little small, but it is enough to live in; (mainly expect the size of the room)
4. In a place full of pits in Guilin, it is necessary to come here to show care

msg:I must give it good reviews. I really didn’t expect that our first visit to Yangshuo would give us such a good experience in the hotel! To be honest, I was halfway up the mountain before reaching the hotel. It was a bit out of the way. I thought it was a very old-fashioned place, but when I walked to the door of the hotel, it was a different world. When I entered the hotel, I could say that it was a very high-end and elegant hotel!
A butler greeted me at the door and explained carefully what facilities the hotel had. All the facilities in the hotel were quite high-end and attentive. The location of the hotel is not too biased, and it is convenient to go anywhere. The hotel also cooperates with the rental of electric bicycles, so it is very convenient to go wherever you can ride electric bicycles. I came to Guilin to see the scenery, but in fact the scenery in the hotel is like an attraction. It is enough to visit for a while. The hotel also has a platform to take in the beautiful scenery here.
Moreover, the food and drinks were very good, everything in the room was available, and the butler service was also very good. As long as I contacted him, he would reply anytime and anywhere, and any requests would be solved. I was really satisfied. The hotel took us to the high-speed rail station at 7:40 in the morning. After looking for a hotel for a long time, it really paid off. I will stay here again next time I have a chance!

msg:The first evaluation, because satisfied!
No gift no gift 🤣🤣🤣
1. The hotel is on the mountainside, it is really remote, I had a bad feeling at first. After all, the price is expensive, so of course I hope that all aspects are satisfied, but it takes about five minutes to drive up the mountain with the car, which is inconvenient! As a result, the hotel has a perfect solution: the special service here, as long as the customer travels, the hotel can send it to the pier opposite the West Street, which is convenient for sightseeing, very good 👍🏼
2. There is nothing to say about the hotel environment. The mountain view in the distance, the hotel is clean and beautiful, the lotus pond, the spacious rooms, the elegant restaurant, all the supporting facilities are very satisfactory! Five-star (please see the actual picture)
3. Since it is relatively remote, what should I do if I suddenly feel hungry? Takeaway is also inconvenient! Unexpectedly, the hotel has such a delicious semi-buffet breakfast. You can order it casually. It tastes great and is suitable for all ages. The dinner is also good. We are all full. It is indeed of the standard of a Western restaurant in Guangzhou. I am satisfied!
4. The most important reason for us to decide to stay here next time——the service is too careful! Any request is unconditionally satisfied and obedient, bathtub bag, good night milk, unlimited refills of coconut water, welcome snacks...every detail is impeccable, plus a full set of supplies from Bulgari, the L'Occitane I brought here is instantly inferior 😅😅 😅
In the morning, my niece's feet were a little itchy, and the bag was a little itchy. The attentive waiter in the restaurant noticed it and offered to bring cooling oil and soothing oin**ent. She is so attentive! ! Thank you for your meticulous care.
To be honest, I have stayed in a lot of five-star hotels, but this is the hotel I am most satisfied with because of the service, environment, and catering. Even the simplest toothpaste, paper towels, and slippers are all of high quality, and the details are in place. Like it! !

I finally found my Xinliu Hotel. The rolling mountains can be seen outside the window, which is very open! At the same time, the "quality" is also reflected in detail, which is really rare in Guilin!
    The hotel is not far from West Street. It can be said that it is quiet and convenient. The most worth mentioning is the mountain view at night and the dotted lights of West Street. It is really charming!
    The hotel's services also hit me in all aspects. First of all, the recommended activities and coaches are very good! The Geely coach recommended by the hotel, took us to explore caves and paddle boards, pick up and drop off the whole afternoon, and also took pictures and videos throughout the whole process. The children and I had a great time playing together🥳Moreover, if you want to go around, the hotel will try its best It is very convenient to arrange a car pick-up and drop-off! Also, the food in the hotel is also very popular with me. The kids are quite picky eaters, but the fried rice with beef and cabbage is also a big mouthful for us to eat! What's more, the hotel has arranged travel photography @旅拍, the photographer is very professional, and with the beautiful scenery of the hotel, Zhang Zhang produced pictures~
    In short, the only regret is that this holiday, I should have discovered this hotel earlier, so that for me, a hotel lover, there is no need to change it! Thank you Jiuyang, thank you Xiaojiu!

The room hygiene, facilities, and breakfast are all OK, but you have to be careful if you live on the first floor. There are geckos and centipedes in and out, and the children are a little scared.

The hotel has a good a**osphere and a sense of luxury. Meals are a bit expensive, but the taste is good, so you don't have to go to West Street to eat. You can also rent a small electric donkey by the river, which is convenient to go anywhere. If you don't understand, you can consult Xiaoguan. Special praise to the hotel manager and all the waiters. Everyone is very enthusiastic. If you have any questions or need help, you will do your best. In short, it is a good hotel worth experiencing leisure life!

From check-in to check-out, the butler arranged very well. Before check-in, the butler will call to contact us with the details of the check-in. The butler will greet us at the door, and the luggage will be delivered directly to the room without going down to the lobby. I am amazed by the welcome reception in the room! The room is enough to see the view through the window, the equipment is completely luxurious, the high-quality butler service, and the warmth is just right. I will definitely choose Jiuyang again on my next trip!

The staff are very caring and provide a lot of help. They are really considerate!

Breakfast is an a la carte system, and the quality of the dishes is also well controlled. Bvlgari toiletries were provided in the room, and oa**eal milk was given at turndown, etc., which all left a good impression. Moreover, the public spaces of the hotel are very designed and tasteful!
Compared with Yangshuo's overall tourism service industry, these aspects are outstanding and extremely luxurious. Overall, it is a hotel that treats customers with care, is not kitsch and does not follow the Internet celebrity style. It can be described as "unconventional and independent". In short, I love it very much. Staying at Jiu Yang Hotel requires slow experience and is worth enjoying quietly.
I have a suggestion. The red hearts of 9 love u in various places in the hotel do not match the overall style (including the staff’s work clothes). The boss can consider improving it.

They are mountain bikes, which are very easy to ride. When a small tire blows out during the ride, the hotel specially sends the driver to the car repair point, change the tire, and continue to complete the day's cycling itinerary , the experience is excellent.
On the day of check-in, we were picked up by a 7-seater business car, which was very comfortable, and in order for us to catch up with the rafting schedule of the day, the housekeeper took us directly to the rafting point and sent our luggage back to the hotel. The service was super good.
All the drinks and snacks in the minibar can be eaten for free~ Finally, take the high-speed rail and drink slowly

Before coming here, I was worried about opening the blind box because the reviews on Xiaohongshu were not very good.

We stayed in a family room with a 2-meter large bed and a 1.35-meter small bed. It felt like it was no problem to accommodate 4 people. The room also had a large sofa. Although the space in the room was not very large, it was enough and there was a balcony. Bathroom with separate wet and dry areas

Every friend in the hotel is very nice. From the housekeeper to the restaurant service staff to the cleaning lady, they are really responsive! Special praise to the butler and bartender

You can spend as much as you like at the minibar in the room. Breakfast is also a free-for-all. You can drink as much as you want and eat as much as you want.

The hotel is small but beautiful, suitable for travelers who want to lie in the room and enjoy some alone time or escape from the city!

Hotel facilities: tea room, bar mix, small library, lobby seating area, restaurant, swimming pool, picnic area, observation deck*2

Hygiene: very good

Environment: There is a very photogenic viewing platform

The exception is almost perfect and is the pinnacle of hotels in recent years. What is worth mentioning here is the restaurant and service. The restaurant in the small village is like being in Shanghai. Breakfast and dinner are great. After all, it is a small hotel in terms of service. In the restaurant, lobby or There are a group of friends in the car coming and going, but they are like family. The most touching moment was when the children's wet shoes were dried on the hotel balcony. The guest room aunt knew that we were leaving the next day and was afraid that the shoes would not dry, so she took the initiative to dry them for us. I stayed here for three days and I still feel unsatisfied. It is better than other SLHs in China that I have stayed at before. I hope to see you next time. In addition, I hope to be equipped with some children's bathrobes, bathing and other children's products.

msg:There are not many good hotels in Yangshuo, and this one is one of them. How to define a "good hotel", I personally think it means warm service, cleanliness and comfortable accommodation. These points can basically give 5 stars. The service, in particular, makes up for any other minor deficiencies.
When we checked in, we regretted booking Jiuyang, because the room was not as big as expected, and there was no gym. These two points must be satisfied when we live in a hotel outside. However, from the caring service of the butler Nannan before check-in, to the overall a**osphere of the hotel after check-in (humanistic a**osphere, architectural a**osphere, fragrance a**osphere), we are very satisfied and like it very much. I like the hotel's afternoon tea the most. The snacks are sweet but not greasy. You can taste the good butter and milk. We also like the breakfast in the restaurant. Rougamo, rice noodles, and millet porridge are must-orders every day.
The only thing I feel a little regretful is that I didn't finish reading the book by Mu Xin in the room before I left because I brought the half-read book with me, so I used the hotel's welcome letter as a bookmark. I like both the book and the letter. I hope I can finish reading it next time I go and take the letter with me as a souvenir.

msg:The hotel is small in size, the public area is small, and there are 35 rooms in total. Personally, I feel that there is still a gap in the positioning of high-end luxury hotels. The main reason is that the external environment is too bad. The hotel is located in the middle of the mountain, the road up the mountain is narrow, and the surrounding houses are scattered. The family room we live in has a good view, but there is a residential house under construction in front of the hotel. The volume is not small. The landscape is blocked, you can only look to the left and right, and you can't see everything at a glance. The picture was not taken because it affects the beauty too much. The hotel's interior design and landscape creation are relatively exquisite, but there are problems with management, and dead frogs were found in the swimming pool. The service and meals are the hotel's characteristics. The hotel butler's service is very good. We will ask in advance about turning down the bed, and take the initiative to contact the pick-up before check-in. In terms of meals, the set meal includes a chef's dinner. The menu says it has 9 dishes. These 9 dishes probably include 4 small dishes of appetizers, and there are only two main courses (one fish, one duck). Add a plate of stewed beef, a bowl of soup, dessert and a small portion of fruit. 2 adults and 1 4-year-old child have just eaten enough. Personally, I don’t think it is rich, because the two main courses have chili, and the child I couldn’t eat it, so I ate stewed beef and a small bowl (it’s really a small bowl, which is about half the size of a family’s usual rice bowl) rice. The dessert was really a mouthful, and so was the good night dessert delivered to the room every night. One bite, although it is very delicate, it is unavoidable to feel that it is unrealistic. Dinner does not include drinks, I ordered two glasses of orange juice, 68 cups), breakfast is semi-self-service, drinks, pastries, fruits are all self-service, lackluster, order food The taste is very good. There are local rice noodles and oil tea. Generally speaking, the two-day stay is not bad, because the bedding is well used and the location is quiet, but the price/performance ratio is really not high, and I feel like I live in a high-end B&B.

First of all, in terms of the details of the room's software and hardware, the provision of outdoor slippers is very convenient, indoor and outdoor. The leisure area is also a very sophisticated choice; secondly, in the restaurant, the chef's products are very online. Although it is a set menu, every dish is carefully produced, but the quantity is slightly less. Maybe the hotel adheres to the principle of being full for dinner, Regarding service quality, the restaurant management staff must have service staff with professional backgrounds and have very professional considerations for the selection of wine categories, so this is also a plus point. Finally, I would like to mention some shortcomings. It is a pity that there is no gym. Furthermore, I hope that the breakfast time can be extended to 10:30 during the peak tourist season so that the peak time can be offset. Another point is that guests can be booked at a controlled time during dinner time. This I believe everyone can understand that we will not feel rushed and cramped during the peak hour of 7:30. Overall, I highly recommend your stay here.

msg:Checking in was full of surprises, not to mention the service. Every hotel we could think of had it. Even the pick-up and drop-off fruit basket showed the hotel's care. The hotel's breakfast and dinner also surprised us. They were great value for money and tasted as good as Michelin. What is particularly worth mentioning is the hotel terrace. The big moon at night is so artistic, and coupled with the 360-degree beautiful scenery, it is simply a masterpiece.

Internet celebrities check in, take pictures, and take casual photos without worrying about the problem of poor results. The afternoon tea and desserts provided by the store are very delicious and beautiful, so I can’t bear to eat them!
At this price, you don’t have to worry about service and hygiene issues. The bedding and toiletries are fine, and they are very comfortable to use.

We stayed for three days, and the more we stayed, the more we liked it, especially the air-conditioning system, which is silent and has soft wind. With the green mountains and green mountains outside the window, it is worldly and peaceful! The hotel staff are very friendly and always respond proactively and promptly to our needs, making us feel at home. What impressed us most was the hotel's food, which was very exquisite. It can be seen that the hotel's management and training are doing a good job!

msg:I was almost confused when I was outside. I thought I had entered a bad B&B by mistake. When I entered, I found that there was something special. SLH is a well-deserved brand. There are many little frogs in this season. The kids said, from now on, we will call it Frog Hotel.

The food at his house is so delicious that the two kids actually licked their plates at night. The breakfast and dinner were a little slow. For the first time, I felt like I was still not full after finishing the meal. However, the meals at the course by course were like this even if I didn’t stay at his house. It’s a good choice to have two meals here. It’s much better than Banyan Tree.

Butler Nan Nan's service is excellent and considerate.

msg:Excellent butler service: Contact us the day before check-in to see if airport pick-up is required and arrival time, precautions for check-in, and introduction to the local climate. On the day of check-in, it was drizzling in winter. After passing through the corridor and entering the lobby, a butler immediately offered hot towels with both hands, as well as welcome hot tea with local specialty Luo Han Guo and Osmanthus. Quick check-in, shown to the room and introduced to the various facilities.
When I meet the cleaning ladies, I greet them politely and with full sincerity! The room equipment is even more first-class, including Parma shampoo, Dyson hair dryer, coffee machine and coffee capsules, and a minibar full of snacks and drinks (the key is free).
The floral arrangements in the hotel are also very thoughtful. It is said that they were personally created by a master of ikebana who has lived in Japan for many years. There are floral arrangements everywhere!
The delicious food in the restaurant is not to be missed, especially the Guilin rice noodle presentation is unmatched by other restaurants. In the afternoon, there is free handmade pizza (you can add enough ingredients by yourself)
 What's even more surprising is that it's my family's birthday on the day of check-in, so I got a surprise when I opened the door and entered the room! It is said that the hotel is a Gold🔑 member hotel, and it is worthy of being Gold🔑!
The hotel is only a few minutes away from the Li River. From the upper floor of the hotel, you can see the panoramic view of Yangshuo and the river. Opening the automatic curtains in the morning is like sleeping in a painting!

Step by step when you enter the hotel, you can see the scenery, revealing the ultimate intention of the designer. The butler introduced the hotel as a small boutique hotel that has joined the Golden Key Alliance. I was once again surprised to choose this hotel. The floral arrangement in the lobby is also unique. After enjoying the breakfast at the hotel, the Guilin rice noodles are worth trying. The tableware is very exquisite. I will choose this one next time.

msg:It’s a newly opened hotel, and it’s obvious that a lot of thought has been put into it. It gives me the feeling that there are not so many bells and whistles, and it is down-to-earth about quality and service. There are also flowers arranged on the sink in the room, which is very petty bourgeoisie. Located on the mountainside, the location is very quiet. It is perfect for couples who like to go out and enjoy quiet without being disturbed...

msg:I came to Yangshuo for a weekend break and was recommended by a friend to Jiurang. It’s a completely different experience from Sugar House and Banyan Tree.
It was raining lightly when we arrived in Yangshuo. As soon as we exited the station, we saw the housekeeper waiting for us at the exit. After getting on the bus, we thoughtfully prepared welcome snacks. The handmade cranberry cookies were really delicious😋.
After check-in, there are welcome fruits, and the room is equipped with Italian niche Lochburn aromatherapy, Madeleine rose. It is raining outside, and there is a faint and fragrant fragrance when you enter. Why not say that this store is very good!
The hotel uses Parma water for washing, a Dyson hair dryer, and slippers for indoor and outdoor use.
What I like most is the view outside the balcony. When I open my eyes in the morning and at night, I see the landscape of Yangshuo. From a certain distance, it looks more like a landscape painting with an open scroll. Listening to the patter of rain, drinking a cup of tea, and being in a daze for an afternoon are not enough~
When it rains, I lie down in the hotel and have dinner at the hotel's Shishan Restaurant. The new creative dishes are recommended, including wasabi tuna, mango shrimp, and asparagus beef. They are all very delicious!
The overall environment is very simple but very a**ospheric! According to the staff, all the floral arrangements in the hotel are created by florists from Aman Tokyo. The more you look at them, the more interesting they become!

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival vacation, I accidentally discovered this newly opened hotel.
With the mentality of giving it a try, I was full of surprises and highly recommended after staying here.
1-Service: After getting off the high-speed rail station, the butler was already waiting at the door in advance. There were welcome refreshments on the car, and the butler focused on driving and didn't talk much on the way. It took about 40 minutes to arrive.
Check-in was also very fast. The room is on the 5th floor, and you can see the poetic landscape of Yangshuo directly from the window.
2-Overall environment: Unlike other bustling Internet celebrity hotels, the hotel is very quiet. It is said that there are only 35 guest rooms, and the intention is to give guests a comfortable "secluded" vacation experience. If you are busy every day in the city, you can really slow down in Jiuliang😎. Even if you only have a few days, it is great.
3-Guest room: Small things make a big difference. The details of the guest room arrangement are not only reflected in the fresh drinking fruits and toiletries (parma toiletries + Dyson), but also in some unexpected places, such as slippers for inner and outer wear. , cotton and linen texture, soft, comfortable and breathable.

3-Meals: Breakfast and afternoon tea are both at the hotel. Breakfast is more like a set meal. After you choose it from the menu, the chef will make it fresh. I have a Chinese stomach, so I ordered Guilin rice noodles, and my friend had sandwiches 🥪 and pancakes and fruits, which were all pretty good!
Afternoon tea is also available for everyone. The combination of salty and sweet flavors is just right~
4-Other details:
The hotel has a landmark building, which is the moon sculpture. The moon on the lobby lawn echoes with the moon on the rooftop, which reminds me of Somerset Maugham's "The Moon and Sixpence". There are sixpences all over the ground. We should look up and look at the moon. 🌛
During the short vacation, you can be free and easy, without looking at your phone, or replying to WeChat or emails📧. Jiurang is also a place to relax yourself~~

msg:I stayed in three hotels in Yangshuo this time. The first one is Jiurang. Located in Mid-Levels Col, it opened less than a month ago. From the overall design, room layout and facilities, catering, service attitude, and attention to details, it feels small, exquisite, warm, and emotional, pursuing the beauty of things while also having the comfort of home. But I initially chose Jiu Yang after reading 10 reviews, most of which praised the food. When I came, I started with the afternoon tea provided, followed by breakfast and dinner. Sure enough, it achieved a good balance in the pursuit of exquisiteness/deliciousness. (I asked Chef Zhi who served at Park Hyatt Changbai Mountain). The use of tableware and careful presentation are another highlight. I'm afraid there is no other hotel in Yangshuo that can match this... There are some minor shortcomings as it is newly opened, and some technical details and staff training are in progress. But during the casual conversation, I felt that the store owner’s goal is to strive for high standards of service. I wish Jiuliang will become more and more beautiful and better! Thanks to the smiling and attentive staff for bringing us comfort and warmth... During the upcoming National Day, Jiurang, a small city with only 35 rooms, will be busy...

Let me talk about my feelings: the price is similar to that of Banyan Tree and the sugar house, but this facility is very new and the service is super attentive. I will still come again when I come to Yangshuo This home lives. Don't like staying in old hotels, poor air-conditioning and poor service. The air-conditioning, bedding, dishes, mini bar, and toiletries in Jiuyang are all great. Of course, the most praiseworthy thing is the service of the staff, which allows tourists to relax in unfamiliar places.

msg:Let me write a review from the bottom of my heart. One is Guangzhou Jumeirah. At that time, I said that the hotel’s breakfast was prepared so well. The management of the hotel was absolutely attentive. A hotel that pursues the ultimate in dishes and utensils. It took three months to prepare an afternoon handmade tea stand. The same style in Aman, Tokyo. It is the first time I have seen such a heart in so many luxury hotels in China. From the housekeeper to pick up the luggage, the natural and clean feeling, the fruit and nut ritual on the car is really attentive, and the luggage is directly connected to the room when the hotel arrives. This connection is really praised and enters the lobby fragrance music , An instant immersion, the housekeeper introduced that it is specially made by the same manufacturer of Aman in Shanghai. The floral art is called ikebana, which is specially made by the Aman florist in Tokyo. The floral art is rotated according to each season, corresponding to the seasonal expressions. Each work has a name, with the ultimate intent. When you arrive in the room, there is a free mini-bar with a meticulous card description that introduces the salty, sweet, bitter, spicy and food characteristics of each snack and drink. Each one is carefully selected, and I have the urge to taste it. There is always one I like, by the way Now, I like a coconut water in the refrigerator. The room is washed and protected with Parma water, and the small soaps are deliberately placed on a custom-made tray separately. I feel too much of the hotel’s intentions.....

The butler is very considerate. After check-in, they will be delivered directly to the guest room. They asked about the turn-down time and snack delivery time. The breakfast quality is very good. You can eat everything from local rice noodles to steamed buns, pancakes and fruits. In the afternoon, I also ate the free New Chilan ice cream provided by the hotel. There was no limit! For dinner, I ordered the smoked and vinegar blood duck recommended by the chef. It was mixed with the smell of smoke, which was much better than what I had eaten in Guilin! It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive in many aspects, ingenuity and quality, the design is very good and quiet, and the lighting and music at night are very good.

酒店的環境很清凈雅緻，有手沖有茶室有酒吧有書房，房間也很舒服。而且遇到的每一位工作人員都特別熱情周到，從門口接待我們辦理入住並全面介紹酒店各處的小吳，到給小朋友一個大盆裝魚食的小姐姐，到雨天在後花園偶遇送給我們新奇小竹筍的阿姨，再到餐廳每天照顧我們用餐的服務人員，每個人都特別好。
所以我們基本就在酒店吃吃喝喝四處走走了…懶懶散散～

我在攜程購買的酒店套餐，酒店給升級了房間，帶有一個景觀陽台，可以直接看到遠處的羣山。房間寬敞明亮，設施齊全，配有戴森吹風機和Bose藍牙音箱，還有寶格麗備品。房間配有晾衣桿，帶娃出行的家庭絕對剛需。

酒店的早餐和晚餐菜單雖算不上種類豐富，但勝在品質都不錯。尤其是早餐的千禧聖女果，跟我在家買到的完全不一樣，非常甜，我家娃非常喜歡，一定要讓我回去給她買這種😂。

服務人員熱情周到，態度友善，能夠及時滿足各種需求。到達時會幫忙送行李到房間，前台的小哥哥會手把手教我女兒怎麼釣魚，還在退房時送了我們伴手禮，並貼心的讓我們帶點前台的咖啡糖路上吃。離店時小哥哥會幫我們把行李送到車上放好，並鞠躬目送我們離開。

總而言之，這次入住體驗非常棒，已經給周圍好幾個朋友安利過了。

msg:1.管家會提前一天打電話聯繫，加上微信，入住期間有任何需要都可以找小管家，從設施到服務都無可挑剔。強烈推薦在酒店用午/晚餐，每一道菜都好吃的令人驚訝，而且所有菜品都是現點現做的，不添加雞精味精。非常適合帶着長者和小孩來度假，非常感謝管家們貼心的照顧，下次一定會再來的!
2.跟家人來陽朔度假選擇了玖壤是此行最正確的選擇，酒店離西街很近，酒店有免費接駁車可以送到擺渡船碼頭，坐個小船3分鐘就能到了，還有美美的旅拍，服裝都是免費的哦。服務特別好，點一萬個贊，環境很幽靜，聽説有好多明星入住，行程匆忙衹住了1天，下次還會來！

公區完美，大堂、電梯停都放置了鮮花，花瓣上還有露水，鮮花的香氣瀰漫在走廊和過道上！
服務完美，全程管家式服務讓人賓至如歸，從訂餐到洗衣、從遊玩諮詢到枕頭選擇，響應及時，讓人感覺親切卻不過度！
食物完美，餐廳食物保持了食物的原生味道，烹飪水平讓我一個如此挑剔的人都覺得可圈可點，絕對超過陽朔縣城絕大部分的餐廳！
附贈服務完美，店內跟拍的衣物質感不錯，看得出來也是用心選過，其他額外服務沒有體驗，下次再體驗！
整體酒店感覺得到誠意滿滿、細節滿滿、總能發現新的亮點，是我目前住過最讚的酒店！
ps:感謝小楊的熱情服務，在晚上和我們聊天～

設計感十足 衞生好 度假感很強 雖然受限於空間 但整體體驗已經很完美   審美也在線 

驚喜是餐飲 早餐是a la carte 中餐選擇比較多 且都挺好吃 大大超出預期 比街上的必吃榜的甚至好吃 尤其推薦桂林米線 油茶 有特色 美中不足西式部分一般 麪包不太好吃 咖啡衹能從壺裡倒 但其實樓下的bar有機器

位置來説 這家酒店有點冷門 但其實出行很方便 開車打車都友好 比如 去西街 酒店可以送到碼頭 坐個1分鐘的小擺渡船就到了 去其他地點也是過去打個車就很方便

服務人員很細心周到 且有一份來自熱愛的温暖 

整體非常滿意哈

晚餐人均200多，略貴，但食物質量不錯。點了田螺釀肉、油茶雞、芋頭排骨，都很好吃。

早餐的種類比較少，自助+點餐的模式，點餐就米線還行。自助部分的選擇非常少，而且拿完基本也就不補了。麪包可頌和飛機上發的密封麪包的味道差不多，一吃就不是新鮮的。

最大的吐槽點來自早餐的咖啡，竟然是用保温瓶裝的速溶咖啡。。。現在連普通酒店基本也會放個鮮蘑咖啡機，而這家是單晚2-3千的精品民宿。無奈衹能早餐後去咖啡吧點一杯，先是找不到人，説員工都在忙。等了半個多小時，總算來了一個當時辦理入住時候的小姑娘做了一杯咖啡，味道也就瑞幸水平吧，結果買單一杯56元。。。。

酒店的硬傷在於周邊風景不及十里畫廊的美，但也見鄉村房子炊煙繚繞，很接地氣，讓人放鬆。管家開車五分鐘就能到碼頭，可直接坐渡船抵達熱鬧的西街，非常方便。

房間配置舒適，早餐的米粉很贊，在離店時管家還貼心送上伴手禮，事無鉅細衹要提出要求管家都會盡力滿足，簡直是服務屆天花板，真心祝願玖壤生意興隆！推薦大家入住👏

msg:從糖舍酒店住倆天后過來了，有很大落差，周邊環境非常差，就是一個村莊，泳池邊的一個池塘現在説在養睡蓮，感官就是一個泥塘，服務確實不錯，管家服務，早餐也是和糖舍沒辦法比，早餐單上的茶是特威茶，我發現是川寧，問到服務員説早餐單沒來得急換，是不是過份了啊，水果拼盤裡衹有西瓜哈密瓜和幾個藍莓，西瓜都快壞了那種，熟過了，説是西瓜季節不對，承認季節不對，為什麼主打還是西瓜，不能調換其他水果，真實評價

我們入住的那天，酒店工作人員非常熱情地歡迎我們，併為我們升級了房型，給了我們一個非常寬敞和舒適的客房。房間內的設施也很齊全，特別是床鋪非常柔軟舒適，讓我們有一個舒適的休息環境。我們也可以從房間的陽台上欣賞到美麗的陽朔風景。

作為SLH會員酒店，陽朔玖壤酒店的服務非常出色。每一個工作人員都非常友好和專業，並且願意為我們提供幫助和建議。尤其是管家楠楠，她的服務真的讓我們感到温暖和舒適。她非常周到地為我們安排了所有的需求，並幫助我們解決了任何問題。

酒店贈送的下午茶和早茶也很棒。下午茶提供了各種精美的甜點和茶，而早茶則包括各種當地特色的美食和茶飲。我們真的很享受這些美食和飲品，讓我們有一個非常美妙的用餐體驗。

總的來説，陽朔玖壤酒店提供了非常出色的住宿體驗，特別是對於新婚夫妻。我們真的很享受在這裏的時間，並會極力推薦這家酒店給任何人。再次感謝管家楠楠和酒店所有工作人員的服務和熱情款待。

門臉不起眼，但是進去別有洞天，設計感很強，尤其燈光氛圍營造很有質感。
最讓我印象深刻的是酒店半自助早餐不錯，作為房間數體量並不很大的酒店來説，品種豐富，味道品控也很好。
酒店所有工作人員都非常親切友好，還帶我們去頂樓打卡，陽朔整個縣城都一覽無遺美不勝收。

msg:這趟旅程起初是很折騰的，好在是個美好的結局。本是百忙中抽空做了前期攻略帶家人到三亞遊玩，自己也透透氣，但因為疫情受限，朋友推薦來了陽朔，畢竟是被評為SLH的酒店，並且還是金鑰匙聯盟酒店，服務很不錯，ok，決定是它了！

第一觸動我的還是酒店滿不錯的服務，比如接機。幫提拉行李、車內準備好味道不錯的曲奇、mini保温杯備好的紅糖薑茶，大寒天暖暖的熱飲和陽朔山景絕配了，十分愜意（雖然熱飲有點點燙嘴，但完全不影響我被感動啊！）。除此外，酒店其他服務也都極其暖心，細微周到，並且是那種十分淳樸自然的體貼，無距離感那種。

第二我想提的是被酒店“望月台”治癒了的心情，無邊的陽朔山景和觸手可及的大月球（酒店前台的小妹妹告訴我酒店的最佳觀景點）。酒店散落了兩個大月亮，近距離感受很靜謐神奇，繁複嘈雜的心境瞬間能被凈化。Ps：月球合影很不錯

第三提一嘴酒店的餐廳，我們定的房間含早，早餐吃了本地的桂林米粉，從桂林米粉的擺盤都能看出他們服務匠心，像上了一個套餐，味道也不錯，但是我最喜歡的是他們的山葯汁，太可了，大讚，山葯汁大概是調了牛奶和芝士？？喝着很醇香順滑~因為早餐不錯，晚餐也在酒店用了，嚐了下玉米汁也很不錯，菜品調性和味道媲美米其林，不誇張誇大，來了可以試試！
最後一點我覺得很幸運的是，我在酒店提前過了聖誕節，因為聖誕節當天公司忙着加班趕項目。當時去還是聖誕前，酒店已經佈置好聖誕氛圍了，很高級的聖誕節佈景，是我剛進酒店大堂的驚喜。（這評價是逾期很久，今天才抽出空來寫寫，因為覺得是很不錯的去處，和大家分享下吧！）

最最最後忘了説：酒店那衹小鸚鵡巨黏人，完全不認生

晚上在餐廳用餐的擺盤很漂亮，口感很好，原汁原味，很獨特。據説主廚跟上海米其林經常交流學習的哦，在陽朔能嚐到這樣的餐點非常驚喜，下次再來希望還有更多的驚喜哦。

msg:十一陽朔行最滿意的酒店！剛開不久點評很少還有點忐忑，停好車第一眼酒店看上去有點小還略擔心，但是裏面五臟俱全曲徑通幽。賓至如歸的感覺！服務特別好，彷彿你在想什麼酒店服務員都能感受到。小細節也做得很好，充足的飲料和小零食隨便吃，舒適的拖鞋，貼心的耳塞瑜伽墊，毛巾也很柔軟，洗浴是帕爾瑪之水，晚上還有晚安甜品泡芙。下午茶和早餐味道都很好，很愜意。稍有遺憾一是前面正在修的建築有點格格不入影響美感，二是太匆忙沒能多住幾天。
