msg:Very new hotel, booked for a concert in Jinan. Someone guided us as soon as we entered the lobby. The service attitude was very good. The lobby environment was a**ospheric and smelled good.
There were fruits for check-in and the room type was upgraded. The room was prepared in advance. The hotel breakfast is highly recommended. It is worth investing in. There are rich varieties and there are special people to introduce and guide.
The room supplies are very good, Bulgari toiletries, and the pillows are also comfortable. I asked for a buckwheat pillow and slept very well. I bought two specially to take back.
If I have the opportunity to come to Jinan in the future, I will stay here again.

msg:Came to see JJ's concert and stayed at the Junting Hotel near the Olympic Sports Center
Environment: The hotel is located in the core of Jinan CBD, close to all the famous attractions and places in Jinan, but there is a renovation nearby, so there is a little noise from time to time, but this problem should not occur in the future
Sanitation: The room is hygienic, the bedding is clean and comfortable, but the dust in some small corners such as the bedside light switch is not wiped, but it is harmless
Facilities: The room is equipped with a smart toilet, shower, bathtub, etc., which is easy to use and clean
Service: The hotel service is very good and there is nothing to complain about. After watching the concert, I came back very late and ordered a midnight snack. The staff will also help to deliver it. They will greet and serve with a smile when they see me. I don’t feel strange. The experience is very good
I will come again next time

Looking down from the room, I don't know which floor it is on, I saw an outdoor restaurant on the platform with a very beautiful view. It must be very pleasant to have a small meal in this place under the sunset. The big brother of the hotel is also very enthusiastic in service. There is also a free minibar in the room, and the overall feeling is good.

Xiaolongxi suggested that gloves could be provided. The location is relatively remote and there are few guests staying in the hotel. Local taxi drivers don't know the location. Hope to promote it more, it is worth recommending.

I thought the facilities and sanitation would be very good for a newly opened hotel, but I was very disappointed. I called the room service with the room phone but no one answered. In the end, I had to call the hotel front desk reservation number from Ctrip.

msg:I came to Jinan on a business trip and chose this hotel. The restaurant on the first floor gives a very good look and feel, with an elegant style and a very good service attitude. What makes me feel more comfortable and special is the bathrobe, which is a skin-friendly design, very soft, and simple in appearance. Because I have to get up early the next day, I also have the habit of drinking coffee on weekdays. I found that there is a special coffee machine in the room, which is really convenient, and I don’t have to go out for a special trip. The windows of the room are also panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows, and the white curtains are intertwined with the sunlight, which is very dreamy. Because the floor is relatively high (the front desk lady specially arranged it, thank you!), you can have a panoramic view, and the view is also very good! ! Considering the nature of my accommodation, the front desk staff also specially recommended the executive floor for me. After understanding it, the executive floor has many courtesies and is very cost-effective. This time I went out a little beyond the budget, and I plan to book a room next time I bring my family to Jinan. In short, the experience of my first stay was very good, and I plan to stay here next time I come to Jinan on a business trip.

The buffet is amazing, the dishes are rich, the service of the waiters is also great, very considerate, the ingredients are fresh, and the crayfish is great [strong][strong] In short, it is recommended and praised! ! !

The buffet looks good, so I went straight to eat after completing the formalities. There were not many people eating there, probably because it just opened. The environment is really good, the decoration is grand, and there are really many types of dishes, such as shark fin, foie gras, caviar, salmon, tomahawk steak, etc. I can’t see them all, haha. The best thing is that there is also “all-you-can-eat”. This is the first time I’ve heard of this buffet in a hotel. I feel like I got a bargain…

It is really suitable to choose this place for Jolin Tsai's concert!) Very worthwhile! I will come again next time if I get the concert ticket!

Food: I have to say that this buffet is really good, caviar, salmon, fresh and delicious, and my favorite Tomahawk steak...
Room: Speaking of this, I have to thank the beautiful lady at the front desk (sorry I forgot her name). The view is super good, and she gave me fruit. There is also a small refrigerator with rich content and free of charge. It's thoughtful.

msg:❗️There is an overnight construction site near the hotel and the hotel air conditioning is not available recently. It is very noisy! It is very hot! It is very stuffy! The facilities are very imperfect! Lightning protection! ! ! !
Environment: The hotel is located in the center of Jinan CBD Financial and Trade Zone. The location is good. It is close to the Olympic Sports Center Metro Station and MixC. It can meet basic shopping trips. The hotel parking lot is quite large and it is very convenient to drive. But‼ ️‼ ️‼ ️The hotel facilities are too imperfect! ! ! Business travel is OK, but vacation travel is not recommended! ! ! !
Facilities: First of all, the biggest problem is that the hotel air conditioning cannot be used! ! When the average maximum temperature in Jinan is 27 degrees, the hotel air conditioning cannot be cooled. It only blows hot air. The hotel’s solution is just to put a small fan in the room and no other response is made. It is very hot and dry to sleep at night. It is not good to rest at all.
Secondly, there is a construction site next to the hotel. It is the kind that is under construction all night. It is very noisy! ! ! Attached video to experience it yourself...
There is also an abnormal sound from the refrigerator in the hotel mini bar, and the room service phone cannot be reached at 10:30 pm.
Service: The reception attitude and quality of the hotel front desk are very good! The executive floor was upgraded for free and breakfast was given. The male waiter of the hotel breakfast was very enthusiastic.
However, there is no welcome in front of the hotel! When we checked in, we found the luggage cart ourselves because we had a lot of luggage. We pushed it to the lobby front desk and found a welcome staff for us. This is very bad! This kind of low-level problem should not happen.
There are big problems with the hotel parking lot! Every time you go out, you need to scan the code at the front desk, but there seems to be a problem recently. You can't get the coupon. You can only pay by yourself. The security guard will not contact the hotel. You can only stop the car and find the front desk to call the security guard. It's very troublesome! !
‼ ️In short, the most important thing is the living environment, not the blessing of any famous brand washing and care. The living environment of Jinan Junting Hotel is not even as good as the chain express hotel! There are many problems and loopholes, and various facilities are extremely imperfect! These most basic problems cannot be solved. Others are all in vain! 
🆘In short, it is very, very recommended not to choose this hotel in the past year! Very noisy! Very stuffy! All kinds of facilities are very imperfect! ! ! Advise everyone to avoid mines‼ ️

作為很多酒店的高鑽會員以及攜程的黑鑽會員我認為連續一週都能在基礎事情上出現問題的情況，衹有可能出現在相應的管理層不作為不擔當不管事兒，管理出現嚴重的問題的情況之下才會發生的。是否要對管理層進行進一步的培訓和考核或者更換相應崗位的管理者是我認為目前貴酒店總經理必須且緊急需要考慮的問題了，比較目前的狀況已經糟糕的火燒眉毛了。總之，對差的表示非常不滿，表示嗤之以鼻。

值得誇讚的部分也有，行政酒廊經理ada和行政酒廊員工liz小姐姐表現不錯服務特別特別好；在很多時候遇見問題正式反饋去前廳部門和相應的職責歸屬的管理部門的都無果的時候，去找她們，她們反而均會有迴應並且積極的幫助我推進處理以及解決問題。讓人覺得全酒店的日常運作都要依靠此二位員工來開展了。還有禮賓部的高啟林入住的一禮拜幫我跑上跑下送外賣送快遞非常積極，也比較滿意。

如果再有機會回來也是因為表現好的幾位員工，而不是整體，也不是其他。

msg:環境：新開業的酒店，內部裝潢、房間設施都很棒，周邊飯店、小超市比較多，外賣也很方便。

設施：設施很完善，因為我長期健身，對酒店的健身室非常滿意，設備雖然談不上多，但都是很專業的品牌，而且非常新。建設室後面有淋浴區，還有一個碩大的泳池，因本人不會游泳，所以沒辦法做過多評價。

服務：服務非常非常好，因為我是自駕到濟南，從停車場到前台的工作人員，全程非常熱情的進行接待，有求必應、有問必答，好客山東，名不虛傳！對了，停車多講兩句，入口很好找且對酒店入住客人是免費的，車庫有自助洗車店，沒有體驗過就不評價了，出停車場確實給我繞暈了，可能是新建的原因，指示牌有時不太準確，出口會顯示收費金額，但和保安説下是住店客人也就放行了，這裏建議可以在入住時就可以登記車牌號碼，避免一些不必要的麻煩。

衞生：衞生沒太多好説的，我不是酒店測評官，自己覺得乾淨就可以了，沒發現什麼讓我接受不了的問題，挺滿意的。

其他：熱水壺和咖啡機櫃子裏的插座...是沒辦法插進去使用的，設計工施工問題，衹能拿出來使用；毛巾和浴巾可能因為太新了，是真的回掉毛；淋浴熱水管因為水質原因會堵塞，導致水流很小，如果把水流開大，衹能單出冷水，這個確實給我造成了不變。

總結：五星好評我肯定會給的，從性價比的角度我個人覺得非常值得，也希望酒店可以多多收集住客意見，及時改善不足之處，酒店剛開業，出現一些問題很正常，加油咯，下次我還會再去的！
