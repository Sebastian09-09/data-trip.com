msg:Staff are amazing especially Miya, Levi and Iris at the front desk. They were so supportive and friendly when assisting us. Amazing location around a 5 min walk from SeaWorld. Good restaurants in the area , and lovely pop up food trucks near the gallery which neighbors the hotel. Do not order food in the lobby- the nachos and deep fried calamari was not good, however the restaurant on the 1st floor where breakfast is eaten - is amazing ! The beef noodles are a MUST! Make sure you visit the sky bar and have a drink, there are some spectacular views from up there. We will definitely book her again and thoroughly enjoyed the facilities including the gym and spa.

msg:On behalf of my manager, I would like to thank Aileen, a staff of your hotel. As a secretary, I am also very grateful to Aileen for her assistance in my work. My boss is a regular guest of the hotel, but this was the first time I booked a room in Nanhai Wing on Ctrip and I was not really clear about the difference between Nanhai Wing and Wanghai Wing. 
On the day my manager checked in, the hotel was very full, Aileen knew that my manager was only stayed in the Wanghai Wing, so she tried her best to coordinate the room for me and adjusted the room type for me at a best price. The check-in process went very smoothly and my manager was satisfied with his stay at your hotel.
We will definitely recommend your hotel to other clients and choose your hotel in the future.

Aileen went above and beyond to ensure our comfort throughout our stay. She recommended the Executive Lounge, which turned out to be a fantastic highlight—definitely a must-try!

The room exceeded our expectations in comfort and cleanliness, making our two-night stay extremely pleasant. The breakfast selection was superb, offering a wide variety of delicious options to start our days on the right note.

Located at the heart of Shekou Seaworld, the hotel offers easy access to nearby attractions, making it an ideal spot for travelers looking to explore the area.

We are already looking forward to our next visit to this wonderful hotel. A big thank you to Aileen and the entire staff for making our stay memorable. We’ll definitely be back!

msg:When booking be careful about the “double structure” of the hotel, which is not well explained neither on C Trip app nor at the hotel….basically if you are looking for a more business, busy environment stay at the main structure (newer building); but if you’re looking for something more quiet, cozy and relaxing then stay at the “old building”, which is mainly equipped with suits. Beside this little tricky part….we had a wonderful stay (at the old building)! The service is a bit below our expectations but considering the relatively low price for such a good location and overall very good structure, there is nothing we can complain about . We had a very relaxing and pleasant stay and surely will be back. Great hotel also for a stay-cation.

The room was absolutely beautiful, but the only thing that ruined it was that the lights under the bedside table and bathroom sink wouldn't turn off, so was difficult to sleep. I assume this was because something was wrong with the room itself.

However, if that was fixed I would absolutely stay again!

There was a lounge area, a bedroom, a separate toilet and a huge bathroom with a bath and separate shower. The bath had a tv above it. It had all the amenities a Hilton should have. The gardens were beautifully looked after. The proximity to  Seaworld Sheko made for a smorgasbord of choice for lunch and dinner. The staff of course we amazinly attentive and helpful.The whole experience was extremely relaxing and enjoyable.

Of course I wouldn’t smell anything wrong after staying at the room for long enough. But this experience is still not very pleasant and I won’t expect such a thing to happen at Hilton, which will make me rethink if I book again. 
Besides, the toilet in the public area smells horrible too.

This has to be one is the best hotel I've stayed so far in China, would recommend it!

A quick review to Hilton hotel in sea world.
We’ll know hotel next to sea world museum. I spent a night there thanks to my company. 
I was in a standard room. It was pretty big, clean and the bath top was just wonderful.
The bed was king size, enough for me 😄
If you take a standard room you have to go by a tiny car but except that it was great.
Hope I will go again.

I booked the king deluxe rooms but they do not represent their names. I wouldn't stay here again unless rooms are improved.

The room was a little outdated, with a couple of things broken, not something one expects of a five star hotel. 

The staff were really pleasant, we were taken care of by Annie who did her best to rectify our situation, who was restricted in her help by hotel policies. 

I ordered the breakfast on one day, but they send the wrong food, which once we told Annie she sorted out, but it still added a delay to our day. Do not get the breakfast, it is really expensive for below average food, go to Salt n Talk which is around 5 mins walk away and have great food at a better price. 

Overall, if this was a four star hotel then I would be very happy with my stay, but for a Hilton I felt it lacking and left me feeling slightly disappointed yes.

Telephone in the room was out of order. The lifts were confusing, had to change at least two lift every time to get to the swimming pool or gym.

The room was clean and spacious. I was in another building a few steps from the main building which I was disappointed to find out (at first) but it genuinely wasn’t an issue.

msg:The room I stayed in for the first part of my trip was beautiful. However, the AC was broken. It was 31 degrees in my room the first night and I couldn't sleep. With COVID, they couldn't get someone into my room until the next morning so the first night was very uncomfortable. They ended up only fixing one AC (in the living room), so for the remainder of my stay, the AC in the bedroom did not work. It wasn't too hot but it wasn't too comfortable. I would stay here again but absolutely make sure that both AC's are working before staying a room they assign. The customer service of this hotel was unmatched. Everyone was very attentive and welcoming at all times. I gave the facilities 1 star because, while the rooms were the same price as they always are, none of the facilities (gym, pool, dining area, etc) were open for use.

Windows cannot be opened, not even a little bit for a little fresh air! Changed the room in the middle of the night where the air con was not broken and it was better but also there it got down to about 24 degree. Breakfast very over priced and definitely not worth the money. The croissants did not taste fresh, nothing special. Next time we would stay somewhere else.

msg:We spent the Dragon Boat Festival weekend at the Hilton. The room - corner view executive suite - was big and spacious. The decor is more business friendly than family friendly but the amenities inside the room were very clean and comfortable. The breakfast that was included was great with lots of variety but a little bit hectic at times due to the large stream of people. We enjoyed the executive lounge access and the self serve alcohol, but the food dishes were not replenished very quickly or often during the busy dinner time. The rooftop bar has a great view of the surroundings; we wish it was refurbished to include regular daily events (ex ladies’ night or live band performances) because we think the hotel, and the popularity of its free flow package, could benefit largely from this in a lively expat area.

The hotel would not accept I had already paid on Trip.com and made me pay again. They took a large deposit for the room and the female was making me feel as though I was not trusted. In check out I demanded my money refunding and told them I would not be paying twice. They sat us waiting for 30 minutes to talk to Trip.com and we ended up leaving still having paid twice. Eventually, the second payment was refunded to my wechat. The room was lovely, stunning breakfast and the facilities really impressive. It was a shame that they cannot get the front desk up to the same 
standard. We will not stay again.

msg:I went on a vacation with my mom for Mother's Day. The hotel is very close to Shenzhen Bay and the subway station. It is very convenient to get in and out. The room is very comfortable and clean. The scenery is very beautiful. There are many delicious food in Sea World and the night view is also beautiful. The fountain show is unexpectedly beautiful. If you book this hotel, you must go and see it.
Usually I just stay overnight in a hotel, so there are always things I'm not used to. This hotel really doesn't feel uncomfortable at all, and I don't even want to go out. It's a good place to relax and have a rest. The bathtub in the room is very good, but the soaking pool in the outdoor swimming pool is... It’s even more enjoyable. You can also get a massage. The health room is also very good. The most important thing is that all kinds of equipment and items are sufficient.
It's a pity that we didn't catch up with the opening of the outdoor swimming pool this time. I think I will stay again soon to experience the outdoor swimming pool. The hotel price is not high and it is very cost-effective. I will go there at least once a year to relax. It is a really nice hotel. good hotel
By the way, I would like to post a scenic spot that I think is good, Shekou Value Factory, which is only two stops away from the Sea World Station. It is very convenient. It just happens to be undergoing development and the road is a bit difficult. It will be better if it develops in a year or two.

msg:The hotel is located near Shekou Port and is close to Shenzhen Bay Port, making it convenient to travel between Hong Kong and Macau. The hotel is adjacent to the Shenzhen Sea World business district, providing a variety of options for leisure, entertainment, shopping and dining. In your spare time, you can walk to the nearby Sea World Culture and Art Center, where there are many exhibitions to cultivate your sentiments. There are also many coffee shops and Western restaurants to choose from in the nearby Nuwa Coastal Park. The seaside trail can lead all the way to Shenzhen Bay Park, which is a good place for picnics and leisure when the weather is fine.
The hotel is divided into two parts, Wanghai Wing and Nanhai Wing. The two buildings are close to each other, but there are also shuttle buses for pick-up. Wanghai Wing is relatively new, with higher floors, a gym, an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor swimming pool. Nanhai Wing was formerly the Nanhai Hotel of China Merchants, facing the Shenzhen Bay Yacht Club. Nanhai Wing has a gym, a yoga room, a standard outdoor swimming pool, as well as a basketball court, tennis court, rock climbing venue and a children's playground. The Nanhai Wing Seaview Suite is extremely spacious. In addition to a large double bed, there is also a sofa bed and two balconies, where you can enjoy the stunning scenery of Shenzhen Bay. Sitting on a bench in the afternoon to watch the sunset is also a good choice. The hotel has many highly rated Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants, and bars, so you can have a variety of dining options without leaving home. The hotel's front desk and room service are also very professional and thoughtful, which deserves praise.
Overall, it is very suitable for staycation, leisure travel, parent-child travel, etc.

I booked the hotel on Ctrip, with children and the elderly, and the hotel also helped to arrange a quiet room. The room has a superb sea view, and also specially helped to prepare children's bathrobes, slippers, and toothbrushes. There is Wi-Fi, free parking, a free large swimming pool at normal temperature, a small hot spring pool, a gym, a yoga room, and a children's building block toy room next to the swimming pool, all with sea views. The overall experience is very good, the bedding is very comfortable, and the hygiene is clean. It is very convenient to travel with children. I will choose here again next time.

My child got up late, so I called the front desk to ask for an extension and they were very enthusiastic to extend it for me (it should be OK if you register as a member).
I especially recommend the Chaoshan restaurant special package in the Nanhai Wing. It is not expensive and the food is pretty good. There is a shuttle bus service between the two buildings, which is very convenient when it rains heavily. The decoration is very exquisite.
The toiletries in the room are all Crabtree & Green, which is good. It’s a pity that I didn’t experience the swimming pool and SPA this time. Overall, it’s very good.

It takes no more than 10 minutes to walk to the Sea World, and you can go to the park by the sea in the morning for a walk. The outdoor swimming pool is 2 meters deep, not crowded and very comfortable. The staff service is very good. The elderly left their mobile phone in the room, and the room service found it in time and helped to deliver it. The only drawback is that the breakfast variety is average and the replenishment is not timely.

msg:Shekou staycation, checked in at Nanhai Wing, booked a mountain view suite but the weather was not very good. Most of the operating points are in the Seaview Wing, so Aileen recommended us to stay in the executive room here, and chose a sea view room with not much sea view [tears burst into laughter], and also recommended the Chinese restaurant and reserved a table for us. The view from the room is okay, but when I went to the executive lounge at night, it was probably because of the holiday, there were really a lot of people 👩👩👧👦👩👧👦👨👨👦👦 so the happy hour during the holiday is not particularly recommended, but the cost performance is high because it includes breakfast and dinner. I had breakfast on the first floor, and saw Aileen serving dishes again, she is everywhere. The overall stay was OK, next time I will avoid the peak period, I hope to have a better service experience.

Environment: The greening of the entire hotel is superb. Walking on the road is like walking in a garden, and the mood is unconsciously relaxed.

Service: Any needs in the room are met. During our stay, we booked a tour of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge at the Shekou Cruise Home Port. The hotel shuttle bus was responsible for pick-up and drop-off. The return vehicle type: Mercedes-Benz business car, thumbs up!

Dining: Due to our itinerary, we only used the hotel's breakfast. The feeling is that the variety is very rich and the dining time is also very long. I remember it starts from 6:30 in the morning to 11 o'clock. There is a reminder card in the room to remind you to eat at off-peak times.

Next time I come to Shenzhen, I will choose Shekou Hilton Nanhai Hotel!

msg:I came to Shenzhen once on a business trip 20 years ago. This time, I decided to take my family to revisit the old place. It took 2 days to find several hotels online for comparison. Finally, my wife decided to choose the sea view room of this hotel. The room is big enough (60+), the room type is good enough (facing the bay, double balcony, super large bed + sofa bed), there is a large lawn and garden outside (quiet in the bustling city), there is a swimming pool indoors (the children have a lot of fun), and the hotel hardware conditions are very complete. After checking in, I felt the high-standard service of a 5-star hotel. Special toiletries were prepared for the children. The local temperature was relatively high, and a lot of bottled water was prepared for us (paying attention to details). We replenished enough water for our 3-day tour in Shenzhen. The room service was very timely and warm (see photos). Since we were in Guangdong, we followed the local customs and went to have morning tea every day, so we didn’t order the hotel’s buffet. On the last day, we had to catch a flight at noon, so we decided to order a buffet breakfast (2 adults and one child). The front desk staff gave us a discount and waived the children’s meal fee (very generous). The breakfast variety was very rich and the taste was first-class (five ⭐️). A perfect trip, a perfect stay!

msg:Nanhai Wing is the earliest site of Nanhai Hotel. For many years, it has been the memory of old Shenzhen people and the symbol of Shenzhen service. The appearance of the hotel is still the original white pearl shell with a little vicissitudes, but the interior decoration is luxurious and steady. It has always been a holiday leisure place for me, an old Shenzhen person. The hotel is in a unique location, with mountains behind and the sea in front, and the scenery is pleasant. But for me, a sports enthusiast, I like the hotel's gym most because it is well-equipped and high-end, and it is also a gathering place for many fitness enthusiasts. If the weather is good, the famous Shenzhen Bay Greenway is 20 meters south of the gate, or you can visit the Sea World Culture and Art Center next door, or check in at the Sea World Fountain, Minghua Ship, Fisher Girl, German, French and Italian Restaurant, etc. 200 meters away. In short, it’s best to take a break when you are tired from work!

I always go to bed early and get up early and miss breakfast. Miss Miki at the front desk specifically reminded me that the meal time on weekends is delayed to 11:00, which can be considered brunch, nice. I also gave a double breakfast for the next day. Thank you. It's a pity that I left too early.
The service can respond quickly to questions such as needing to replenish water, change rooms, and re-swipe cards.

Facilities: Suite, big enough. Double sinks, great.
Crabtree toiletries, good.
The decoration is probably a bit like the log style? Warm and exquisite. Neat straight lines, sliding doors divide the space, bright and simple.

Environment: Next to the bustling Sea World, convenient for shopping,
and adjacent to Nuwa Seaside Park, take a walk and ride a bicycle in the evening to enjoy the breeze
There is a small garden under the room, and the balcony overlooks the sea, the view is great~

However, the interior of the room is still very well maintained and cleaned. I like the design of their bathroom. In terms of service, the attitude is very good, but the internal management process needs to be optimized. It feels that the internal personnel information link is not smooth enough.

msg:Having stayed in the Wanghai Wing, I wanted to experience the suites in the Nanhai Wing. I really liked it. I stayed in the suites on the 10th floor without balconies and in the suites on other floors with balconies. They were both very nice and each had its own merits. The suite is Japanese-style and very large. It is more comfortable and reasonable in design than the 60-square-meter suites in many hotels I have stayed in. The bedroom and living room each have a balcony. Sitting on the balcony blowing the sea breeze and watching the sea view is really relaxing and healing.

The service is as good as ever, very considerate and enthusiastic, and it is very fast to change rooms, order food or deliver water. My family stayed in another room on the same floor as us, and we were very satisfied. The breakfast here has the same variety and taste as Wanghaiyi, but the scale is slightly smaller and the environment is very good. However, I personally prefer to have breakfast at Wanghaiyi. I have to give a separate thumbs up to the garden on the South China Sea Wing, and I really like the appearance of this building, which is very historical.

When I came to Shenzhen before, I always stayed at Futian, but this time I wanted to relax in the noisy surroundings. After staying for a few days, I felt that the facilities and surroundings of this hotel were perfect for me. I decided to continue my stay and come back in the future. Shenzhen will also come here.

msg:I booked a hotel with Ctrip for two days. On the last day, I was not informed by Ctrip to check out at 12 o'clock. Otherwise, I would have to pay an extra half day's room charge, which is not much money. I came back to bed at 5 or 6 yesterday and was woken up by a phone call at 1:30 to learn the news. I feel uncomfortable and my mood has gone all day long. I can only say that it is a bit interesting. What environment and facilities are really out of my mind? I didn’t want to comment too much. I want environment, no environment, facilities, no facilities. I haven’t changed my quilt for three days. I burned a roll of the used bathrobe. The kettle is extremely old and a bottle of mineral water is left on the bedside without being opened. I take it away every day and I don’t know how to replace it. It’s a very interesting hotel.

I thought that the sea view in the Ocean Wing would be the Japanese style of the Nanhai Wing. In the end, it was more attractive than the wooden floor of the Nanhai Wing. I like the Japanese and elegant feel. The room was upgraded. It is very large, comfortable and clean. Thank you to the hotel staff for the arrangement during check-in! During check-out, Manager Lin was very friendly and helped arrange a late check-out. He also cared about my satisfaction with the room👍🏿My family was very satisfied with the entire stay experience! Except for the MUJI Hotel in Futian, this hotel has become my first choice when traveling to Shenzhen. The facilities near the hotel are very convenient, there are fewer people than Futian, and the environment is more comfortable. I will stay here again!

As soon as I arrived in Shenzhen on the fifth day of the first ***** month, I received a personal phone call from manager Aileen. They had super detailed communication and care. I originally booked a suite and a king bed. After understanding our needs, manager Aileen upgraded both rooms to a 100-square-meter suite for free, with a study room, living room, cloakroom, and kitchen. The overall design encompasses the feeling of a hotel and home. It is very warm and hotel-style. New Chinese style, simple and high-end, the overall experience is very good!

The floor is not high but it is quiet. The next day I continued my stay with Ctrip and couldn't book a room. I thought I couldn't stay. She also arranged and adjusted the room for me very quickly. This time, I was assigned a room in the Wanghai Wing. It felt very different. It was newer and more modern. I really liked that I could get a room with a bay view even though the room was fully booked. I am basically very satisfied with all the details followed up.

The only exception was the two guys who received me from the front desk. The service The attitude is super good. He looks like a boy from a Korean idol group. He is tall and handsome and has a sweet smile. There is also a guy who looks like a Hong Kong star... His appearance has improved... The surrounding environment of the hotel, the food, drink and scenery are all great. It's very good. It's quiet and there are supporting businesses. When I checked out today, I was in a hurry to catch a flight. It turned out that my friend's warehouse key in Huizhou was in my suitcase. Because I was anxious, I asked the girl at the front desk to help me mail it to me. There is a management system here. The one with short hair was fierce and strong, and he treated me politely and harshly. I was also very strong at this time. At this time, the little girl named Wang Yan helped me deal with it very enthusiastically and politely... everything was quite satisfactory, originally A very happy trip. It ended successfully. The management turned out to be really off-putting. Everything else was great, including the doormen at the door. They all enthusiastically helped us carry our luggage. Generally speaking, I like it.

msg:The price of this hotel has doubled during the Spring Festival. It is built on the seaside and has a sea view outside the window. However, due to the location and orientation of the hotel, there are not many rooms with really good views. It is definitely not as good as the Nanhai next to it. hotel.
      Near the hotel is Sea World, where the famous Minghua Ship is docked. Don’t worry about eating, there are many choices. The subway station is also close. Walking along the seaside plank road next to the hotel, taking photos in Nuwa Coastal Park, and many young people exploring coffee in the coffee shop next to the Sea World Cultural Center, chatting and dazing instead of rushing to the attractions is another way to play.
      I booked a room three weeks in advance, a deluxe ocean view room. Due to the large number of people traveling with me, I had Ctrip hotel housekeepers communicate and make notes with the hotel in advance. When I arrived at the hotel at around 3pm on the day of check-in, the room I was given by the hotel still had a poor view. . What I originally expected when I opened the door, wow, what a beautiful scene, did not appear. Instead, I spent more than an hour communicating on the phone, changing floors, my ears were sweating, and there were still only the same number of double-bed rooms. In the last room I stayed in, I could see the wall on the left and the house on the right, with only a small sea view in front of me. It is recommended that the hotel adjust this type of room and exclude it from the deluxe sea view room. It simply does not match the price of two thousand one night.
      Perhaps business was so good that I received a check-out reminder call before twelve o'clock the next day, and my request for a late check-out was rejected outright.
      It is understandable that the reception during the Spring Festival is stressful, but the overall experience of staying at the hotel this time was not very good. If you can avoid the crowds next time, it’s better to avoid the crowds. Sea view rooms usually cost around 1,000 yuan, and the buffets also have group purchase prices. Isn’t it great?

Environment: Next to it is the commercial center Sea World, and 1.2 kilometers away is Shekou Old Street. There are all kinds of delicious food, Shunde cuisine, handicap, seafood market, etc. The house price is more than 100,000 yuan, so life is extremely convenient.

View: Room 614, Wanghai Wing, can see the complete sunrise. I didn’t plan to watch the sunrise at first, but I opened the curtains and saw a touch of red rising in the distance, Lucky Year of the Dragon. The sea view is even more panoramic. The various camera positions downstairs are super filming.

Meals: The breakfast is first-class, five-star standard, rich, and it doesn’t end until 11 o’clock, so it turns into brunch.

Service: Very five-star. The doorman takes the initiative to pick up and deliver luggage. In short, every waiter is very proactive.

Health: Not bad, very five-star Hilton. Except for the scent in the lobby which is really pungent, everything else is 100 points. I don’t know if this is Hilton’s standard fragrance. Needs to be improved a bit!

The only bad thing was that the lady at the front desk of the swimming pool did not smile and was not very patient. The view was very good. , you can see the musical fountain on the cruise ship. I also had a buffet here at noon today, but there were not too many varieties. It’s not bad for this price.

msg:My stay at this hotel was amazing! There are so many impressive features that gave me great memories of my stay.
First of all, the hotel gym is amazing. When I was working out there, I could enjoy the stunning ocean view while working out, which was amazing! The experience made me feel like I was in a resort.
Moreover, it happened to be Chris**as during my stay, and the hotel created a strong Chris**as a**osphere, which made me feel as if I was abroad. The hotel's decorations, lights and music put me in a strong festive a**osphere.
Regarding the price, I think the price/performance ratio here is super high. My room had floor-to-ceiling windows with stunning ocean views, and the price was very reasonable. What a great value for money!
The hotel also has a heated swimming pool, so I can enjoy the swimming pool at any time. This was a very big highlight for me.
Additionally, I also tried the hotel's afternoon tea, which was exquisite and affordable. Here, I feel the exquisite petty bourgeoisie a**osphere, as if I can enjoy such an experience without going abroad.

I was very satisfied with my stay this time and was even upgraded to a room 😭, thank you Tina! Overall, the hotel's ocean view gym, strong Chris**as a**osphere, cost-effective rooms, heated swimming pool and exquisite afternoon tea all made it a perfect business trip for me. You must stay at Hilton every time!

I come here several times a month~ Every time I stay at Xiangjiajia, the hotel staff are very kind. They even know what tea to drink for afternoon tea, because I like to finish my work and relax every time. My friends had afternoon tea in the lobby on the 2nd floor. The open-air location outside the lobby can directly see the sea and Hong Kong 🇭🇰. The room is very clean and comfortable. I usually book a sea-view room, so when I open the curtains, I face the sea. It happens to be opposite the hotel. Sea World is very convenient for eating. You can just walk across the street. There is also a buffet on the first floor of the hotel. The dishes are very large and very fresh. There is also an open-air bar on the 16th floor of the hotel rooftop. It is really not too comfortable to have a drink or two in the summer. ~You can overlook the night view of the entire Nanshan District🌃

I was not disappointed this time either, although there was a hiccup in the middle. , the sister at the front desk solved it for me quickly. The hotel gave me a birthday decoration. It was super nice with pictures, red wine, fruits, good quality, good sound insulation, the bed was quite comfortable, the shower water temperature was enough, the water power was enough, the room was The rooms are pretty good, with small cloakrooms, toilets, and bathrooms all separated into separate rooms. However, nearby residents often yell in the corridor to communicate with their friends in the next room, which is not very nice and is a problem for individual residents. Breakfast is a plus point in my opinion! The styles are adequate and the quality is good. Even my picky girlfriend said it was delicious, especially the side dishes! The waiter was very patient and took the initiative to ask my needs. For me who wakes up with sleepiness... even my temper is gone... haha, of course there are some minor problems. After all, this is a ten-year-old hotel, and some hardware such as the light button Aging, the toilet makeup mirror is a bit loose, a bit dazzling, the TV does not project the screen, is not smart enough, etc. These are all minor problems. However, the lobby manager told me that these are being updated step by step. It seems that several floors have been updated. I will check it out next time. Gotta experience it. Overall, I rate it 90 points. Oh, by the way, when I left, the lobby manager knew that it was my girlfriend’s birthday and gave me a fruit platter for takeout, as well as 2 finger blind boxes as gifts, although they were not valuable things. Things are light but feelings are heavy. I hope the hotel can do better and better

msg:I left Shenzhen today. Before leaving, I carefully sorted out the details of my hotel stay.
The first thing is to confirm the needs of choosing a hotel: clean, safe, view, gym
I am very happy that Hilton is satisfied!
On the first day, because there were 2 complimentary cocktails in the room, one person drank them all, which caused insomnia in the early morning and made it difficult to go to work during the day.
I learned my lesson the next day. I didn’t drink alcohol before going to bed, didn’t look at my phone, and just slept until dawn. It was super fulfilling~
Figure 1: Hall exterior + lobby. The waiters in the lobby are very nice and will take the initiative to help carry luggage.
Picture 2: In the living room corridor, I met the cleaning lady in the guest room in the morning, and she greeted me with a smile every time.
Picture 3: The twin room with sea view and city view on the 15th floor has a good view, but the room is a bit old and a bit unventilated. The shampoo + shower gel has a fresh plant scent.
Picture 4: The gym on the 3rd floor, my favorite gym, is opposite the sea and has a great view! When I went to exercise in the morning, the sea was sparkling outside the window.
Picture 5: The swimming pool on the third floor has good water quality and a good view, but I didn’t bring a swimsuit and the experience was 0
Picture 6: The breakfast room, taken on the second floor, is quite impressive.
Picture 7: Breakfast is quite satisfactory, 180 per person, not worth it. After all, I have been fasting for the past few days, and I will give up breakfast when I stay in a hotel later.
Picture 8: Partial display of the breakfast room. I ate several Danish breads on the first day. They were really delicious!
Figure 9: Rooftop bar. 2 cocktails are provided in the room. It is suitable for couples to have a drink and relax in the sea breeze. It is quite comfortable.
Figure 10: In the office area of ​​the lobby, many foreigners are working. After looking at several computer screens, I feel that they are all programmers...

  I would like to especially praise Miss Aileen at the front desk. She had a very good attitude and gave me great attention and help. She took the initiative to upgrade me to a sea view room with a large balcony, making my vacation unforgettable. Her care made me feel warm and welcome.

 The Wi-Fi in the hotel room is very fast and is truly international internet. Few other hotels in ************** can provide such an excellent network experience. This is very important to me as a tourist.

 Breakfast was one of the highlights of my stay at the hotel, it was delicious. Especially the beef noodles, they are simply out of this world! The bedding is comfortable and allows me to get a good sleep every night. The sea view outside the bathroom window made me feel more relaxed and enjoy the beautiful view of the sea while taking a bath.

  I heard the afternoon tea at the hotel was also really good, although I wasn't able to try it due to time constraints. But I will definitely schedule time to try it next time. The only regret is that the food selection in the executive lounge is a bit monotonous, wish more meal or pasta options could be provided which would make it even better.

  Although the sound insulation may not be very good and you may hear the sounds of roadside artists singing before 22:00 in the evening, but for me, it is also a unique fun and enjoyment.

  Overall, Hilton Shenzhen Nanhai is an excellent hotel with great value for money. There are many good attractions around. I will definitely choose to stay here again next time I come to Shenzhen. Thank you to the hotel team and Miss Aileen for providing me with such an unforgettable stay.

I have stayed there almost 30 times so far, not including staying for several nights. The location is not to mention close to Sea World shopping and entertainment, and the hotel is within easy reach and has a beautiful environment. Facing the sea, the scenery is pleasant and it is the best choice for parents and children. However, I have to complain about my stay this time because a wine merchant has contracted the entire hotel. The wine merchant is really rich. On the night of check-in, there were workers one after another decorating and setting up exhibitions. There was no air conditioning in the lobby. You have to know that today's temperature is 35 degrees and it is a little dusty. During the exhibition, all the rooms in the main building are contracted. Other guests can only go to another building to check in. All the amu*****t facilities in the main building, the swimming pool and the gym are not available. They have to get it on the 11th, so it seems. It is strongly recommended not to come here during this time
Another thing to mention is that the service in the restaurant is still good, although there are some minor flaws. The attitude of the individual service staff is okay, but they are not experienced enough. The person who promised to reply forgot about it when I asked him again. What is worthy of praise is the sausage here. The noodle chef and the waffle maker are both enthusiastic and crafty. The rice rolls and soy milk are great, but I have to complain that the food variety has really declined. In the past, there were fried pork knuckle dumplings that were delicious and a variety of rich fruits. Sushi Wait, they are all gone. If you want to cancel the above food items, it is recommended to replace other items. You cannot only reduce but not increase. Several items are gone. I told several waiters to replenish them. After waiting for 30 minutes, I went three times and found that they have not been replenished. I looked. I saw a few managers in suits walking around, wondering if they felt lonely. I found out that after I reported the problem to a female manager, she immediately solved the problem for me. Finally, I want to complain about the coffee. Beans. Really. very common 
The child went to the yoga room on the third floor and patted the yoga ball. The service staff banned it. I don’t know why? ￼

The sea view in the room really made me reluctant to leave. I set the alarm clock and opened the curtains on time to watch the sunrise. It was so comfortable to just stare at the sea in a daze.

msg:A very good resort hotel with standard Hilton quality. You can see the facilities and surrounding facilities just by looking at the picture. It is close to Sea World Commercial Plaza and Sea World Art and Culture Center. It is just downstairs from the marina, seaside park and walking trails. Note that the hotel is divided into two buildings, the Wanghai Wing and the Nanhai Wing. Be careful when taking a taxi or ordering takeout. There are several indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and the gym has unparalleled views.
By the way, Iris at the front desk provided good service and thoughtfully provided a discount for children's breakfast. There is a small drawback. When I checked out this time, the hotel was building large-scale exhibition facilities, with various construction and transportation. Holding such an exhibition during the peak tourist season is a double-edged sword. It will have a negative impact on the brand image, so I won’t post the photos. .
Overall, it’s as good as the rating, five stars!

msg:The house price in Xiaoqian is ridiculously bad
The musty smell in the room was super strong and the quilt was very damp (except for the weather in the south, a high-end hotel shouldn't be this heavy)
There are only the most common and cheapest tea bags (same configuration as Hanting) and a very ugly plastic kettle. According to other reviews, the cup drawer is empty and there are no extra glasses.
It is recommended that the hotel distinguishes the new building and the old building on the details page. Foreigners only know when they arrive. It is very troublesome to explain clearly to the driver.
It is recommended that you book a room in the sea wing of the new building so you can see the sea. The price is not much different.

The view from the room is super beautiful, facing the sea and yachts. The swimming pool was painted twice. I wanted to extend my stay but unfortunately there was no room available. The waiters are warm and courteous, responsive to all requests, and carefully explain the facilities when checking in. The breakfast was very rich, and there were many people during the National Day, but the arrangements were very good, there was a dedicated person to take care of the seats, and the food supply was very timely. The location is very good, next to the Sea World Art Center, and opposite the Sea World and restaurant street. If you want to go to Vientiane City, you can also take the subway, which is really not too convenient. Will open it again next time

When I arrived at the hotel, I was upgraded to a sea-facing suite, where I could also watch the sunrise. When we arrived at Shekou Pier, we called the store and someone came to pick us up and took us to the pier when we left. We stayed in the south wing. The hotel facilities are very good and clean. Baby cots are provided free of charge. There are lockers in the ba*****t, so it is very convenient to order takeout. The view of the hotel is very good. Because my daughter is still young, we mainly go to the swimming pool in Wanghailou. We haven’t had the chance to go to the deep pool in the south wing yet. We can try it next time. Went to see the indoor pool. The view was beautiful and there was a massage pool. The location of the hotel is only ten minutes away from Sea World, which is very convenient. The hotel has many breakfast options, both Chinese and Western, and the juices are all freshly squeezed. The overall hotel experience this time is very good. Ms. Lin's service is very good. Everyone in the hotel has a very good attitude. If you have any questions, they will help you immediately. Even the guy who cleans the room has a nice smile. If I have another chance, I will come again.

msg:The hotel environment is cost-effective and the concierge service is good, but the restaurant management is chaotic! The black coffee in the breakfast room is brewed with boiling water. On a hot day, the scalding water is served to the table. There is no warning to be careful, and you will get bubbles in your mouth after taking a sip! I have never had such hot water in so many restaurants. The restaurant manager Lin Na came over and explained that everyone's taste is different. The boiling water was said to be slightly hotter, and she did not apologize at all. Later, another manager came over to check the water temperature and admitted that the coffee machine was not tempered.
A good hotel is suffering from poor restaurant service. It is recommended to strengthen the management of catering services. If the service of individual waiters is not up to the position, they should be retrained.

The outdoor one is more fun, but a bit hot. There is an adult pool here in Nanhai. Lunch and dinner on the first floor of Nanhai are okay, but not as good as breakfast. It only takes three minutes to walk to Sea World. The scenery outside the window is also beautiful. All in all, there are no obvious shortcomings, and the price/performance ratio is very high. I highly recommend it. The housekeeper Tingting was also very enthusiastic and upgraded the room and added breakfast.

On the day of check-in, as soon as I entered the lobby, I heard a young lady playing Jay Chou's song, and my mood instantly improved! After learning that I was traveling with children and staying for 3 nights, the duty manager Tingting took the initiative to upgrade me to a high-rise room with a better view and comfort. During this period, they also took the initiative to remind us about parking, swimming pool, breakfast and other service matters. The service was very considerate!
Parking is free for hotel guests, just scan the code every time you go out, and the overall experience is satisfactory!

In a busy first-tier city, Hilton Shekou really wins with its surrounding environment and facilities, making people feel more comfortable. The room is large and very quiet. You can hardly hear the usual noise from hotels in the city center. Special mention is made of Hilton's consistently moderate prices for various dining options, which are suitable for family consumption. The service was attentive. Thanks to Aileen at the front desk for the considerate room renewal service. The elderly man was very satisfied. As for an area that needs to be improved, as a long-time fan of the hotel, I would like to recommend that electric flush toilets be deployed as soon as possible to keep pace with the times.

The first impression is that this hotel is really grand, much like the resort hotels in Sanya. In Shenzhen, which is the most innovative in the country, it is not easy to see such a hotel👍. Both the hotel rooms and the restaurant feature sea views. What’s even more valuable is that the hotel staff made us feel at home. Manager Xiaoqiu from the front office was patient, enthusiastic and professional from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. He heard that our family It was our first time to come to Shenzhen. He arranged a very beautiful sea view room for us.

Due to the problem of order splitting in the past few days, extending the stay and updating the room card are very fast and convenient. The butler Tina Tingting is patient and meticulous, and the service is great ~

The hotel environment is also good, there is an outdoor swimming pool, the room is quiet, and the breakfast is rich. The Hilton brand is as good as ever. I will choose it next time and it is worth recommending to everyone.

After learning about the customer's preferences, she arranged a room with a particularly good view, and asked the customer about the itinerary the next day. In the end, there were items left in the room and they were followed up in time, including the bill. Although I didn't check in, I already felt that the hotel's service is generally in place. Next time I make a reservation, I will come back and contact Xiaolin again.

The view is very good, the suite experience is very good, and the service is very warm and considerate. The housekeeper Aileen helped us in advance and made proper arrangements according to our needs. The arrangement made this trip very smooth, and the afternoon tea in the package is also very rich. It is recommended for business trips, vacations and leisure.

msg:It is worth dedicating my first review to this hotel. The three-day and two-night trip was full of surprises. The check-in time is so fast, and the beautiful housekeeper Aileen Lam is very careful to arrange and leave a WeChat contact. If you need anything during these three days, please feel free to contact us and follow up. The room is big, clean and has a terrace with an open view. There is a double bed and a sofa bed in the room, enough for a family of four. The hotel has 3 swimming pools, two outdoor and one indoor, all of which can satisfy children. The biggest surprise is the breakfast buffet in the morning, with high quality and many choices. The hotel is a ten-minute walk to Sea World. There are so many different restaurants, it's dazzling! Aileen even took the initiative to extend the check-out time to 3 o'clock. After checking out for us, she also called a car and saw us off, which was really considerate. The hotel's hardware equipment and heart-warming service brought our family a very good experience! Will definitely come again~~~~

msg:The room is the best I have lived in recently. The bathrooms are separated from each other, so there are many people and you are not afraid of crowding. This trip to the Greater Bay Area is the hotel that my family is most satisfied with. The customer service [Tina Tingting] contacted me in advance to confirm the housing needs, and arranged a very comfortable room type and orientation for me. She was very considerate and answered all questions. The service staff of other hotels are very friendly and enthusiastic. The hotel also arranges a shuttle bus to Shekou Port, which is free. The most important thing is that the front desk helps with luggage. For us with large and small bags, the service is really great!
Only the breakfast buffet was a little embarrassing, other dishes were good, but the coffee tasted very bad. The machine was exactly the same as our company's, not a good coffee machine. In fact, you can ask the guests what they want to drink after they are seated, and the bar will deliver it to you, the experience will be better.

msg:This time I stayed at the Shekou Hilton Nanhai Hotel, a room in the Nanhai Wing. Compared with the business style of the main building, the Nanhai Wing has a warm Japanese style. And there are also supporting breakfast (mainly Chinese), gym, swimming pool and outdoor tennis and basketball court!
Oliver Zhang Wen at the front desk still provided excellent and thoughtful service in such a busy festival, and helped to upgrade the sea view room. What was even more surprising was that we didn't know it was a sea view suite until we got to the room. Although I know that the Hilton Diamond card does not necessarily give trea**ent when booking with Ctrip. Thank you for your homely service!
The reservation includes cocktails for two at the Eden Rooftop Sunset Bar on the 16F of the main building. One glass is worth 88. Free delivery is really cost-effective!
Hilton Shekou has become one of my favorite hotels in Shenzhen

When Manager Xiaoqiu saw that we were bringing our children, he provided children's products and small gifts. He also provided a lot of help when we continued our stay. He was also very friendly. He was really very friendly. Thank her. The scenery of the hotel is nothing to play. There will be piano performances in the lobby lounge at about 4:30 noon. The outdoor pool and indoor pool are both ok. The bubbles party d is so exaggerated. The children are so happy that they giggle. Come here next time will continue to choose here

        The morning buffet is rich in variety and fresh, and the most important nutrition is online. It is very convenient to choose the ingredients and mix by yourself. The combination of Chinese and Western meets the taste buds of people all over the world! 😋
       It is very happy to take my daughter to swim outdoors in the afternoon. The artificial bubble game in the children's pool attracts all the dolls. The large swimming pool near the sea is very beautiful against the backdrop of the sea, blue sky and coconut trees. There is also an indoor heated swimming pool and gymnasium on the third floor. Open for free!
        Great experience, I will continue to choose Hilton next time I need it! 🫶🤝

The room price is more than 1,000, the hardware facilities in the room are old, peeled everywhere, there are bugs in the bedding, hairy contact the hotel, call the front desk without apology, the reply is "then I will change it for you", but other The sea view room is full now, you need to wait, or change to a city view room, I booked a sea view room, not only did you not provide a clean room, but you also downgraded me to change the room? ,, As a result, a manager surnamed Lin from the front office depar**ent came forward and did not feel sorry for this matter. The only solution is to change your room. Send some broken fruit. I'm missing your fruit? ? ? ?
Keeping the room clean is a service that any hotel must and should provide. Not only can this hotel fail to provide even the most basic guarantee, but the front office manager (surname Lin) is so embarrassed to ask us to write a good review? Said to send a buffet next time? And l suite? May I ask if the good reviews of your international hotel groups are all obtained through this false way? This check-in check-up was extremely poor, who will do it next time? ? After getting my clear rejection, I changed my mind and said that if I need it next time, please contact her to make a reservation. She will help us arrange a suite at a very low price. And give breakfast, I don't understand what kind of black box operation is this or does your front office manager have this right? But the overall standard of this hotel is extremely poor, I won't do it again.

What I want to express is that the praise should be the evaluation from the heart of the guests, rather than false positive reviews through illegal means such as asking for money and giving things to the guests.
This hotel, whether it is from the manager to the staff, really has a huge problem! ! If you have this kind of spare time, please improve the overall level of the hotel~

msg:The hardware facilities are complete, the room is tidy, the bedding is clean, and the area is large. It's the first time I drove to Shenzhen from Beijing, and I don't know much about the local area, so I probably won't book this hotel again. The front desk told me that there was only one room on the 2nd floor left for the room type I booked, but I checked Ctrip and it showed that there were still such room types available for booking. What happened to the only room left? The front desk upgraded the apar**ent suite, except for the large area. The hotel is divided into two buildings. Only after staying in the room did I realize that there is no shadow of the sea on the south wing😔.

I can't imagine that the Nanhai Wing is so well maintained. The room is clean and comfortable, and the view outside the window is excellent
Nanhai Wing is the first five-star hotel in Shenzhen. It looks like a Mayan pyramid. It is very unique. Now it is operated by Hilton. It has an excellent location. While looking at the bustling cityscape and the sea view of Shenzhen Bay, sitting by the window is wonderful Enjoy it, a few minutes walk is the sea world, the a**osphere is very good, there are many foreign restaurants, there are all kinds of food, drink and entertainment, lively and bustling, and a little further is the Shekou Old Street, with high-quality and cheap food, unique small shops can be explored slowly , When you come back, you will find a quiet garden and a comfortable hut. Close the door and everything will be quiet. It is bustling and quiet at the same time. When you come to Shenzhen, you must come to Nanhai Hilton. It is a unique experience.

msg:, The hotel is near the subway station Sea World Station / Shekou Ferry Terminal, very convenient! 👍🏻

The hotel is divided into two buildings, the main building and the south wing, connected by golf carts, it only takes 2-3 minutes to travel, and the hotel facilities are very complete
👙 Two outdoor / one indoor swimming pools
🛝Outdoor playground
🎮Two small indoor game rooms
👍🏻Two large fitness rooms

Because it was raining heavily on the day I checked in, I only played in the indoor pool! Playing Lego, drawing, and small toys in the game room on the left.. Then go out and play!

✨My reservation is the cheapest "Nanhai Wing King Bed Standard Room", but the hotel upgrades me to "Nanhai Wing Linshan Suite", so how big are the rooms🤭

msg:First time giving a bad review (smelly room, poor service), hope it has a positive meaning, both for the hotel and other guests. I booked two standard double rooms in the Nanhai Wing for traveling with two elderly people. When I checked in, I found that one had a serious odor. I immediately contacted the customer service to ask for a room change (for the convenience of taking care of me, I hope the two rooms are arranged closer together). The customer service attitude was very good and I agreed to change rooms , but there was no reply for a long time. After several reminders, the first reply said that there is no room on the same floor. There is only one big bed room, which is on the opposite side of the room. Is it okay? I took a look. On the other side of the hotel, you have to walk through three long corridors. The room is larger and has no balcony. The mountain is about ten meters away from the window. There is a construction site on one side. The downstairs is the parking space and the driveway (the room is on the fourth floor) , then refused. It has been more than an hour. We are sitting on the balcony, and the old man is sitting on the sofa in another room. We are afraid of messing up the room. After opening the door for an hour to ventilate the smelly room, it is slightly better, but there is still an obvious smell. The telephone in the smelly room It is broken, you have to go to the bathroom to answer the call, and you have to go to another room to call the front desk. If you call the front desk, you can't solve the problem, and you have to wait for the customer service to call back. The customer service often calls the smelly room. Basically, you just wait without urging state. Later, I asked the room on the same floor that was being cleaned to be cleaned and checked in. I could wait for a while, and I went to see it. At first, I said yes, but after a few minutes, I said no. That room had engineering problems, so I couldn’t give it. It said that there was another room next to it. You can stay, just near the original room. There was a damp smell after entering, but a few minutes after opening the door for ventilation, the damp smell faded, so I decided to move in. After check-in, the customer service said that they would send a dehumidifier (there is a small dehumidifier in other rooms) to the room to remove moisture. In addition, as an apology, they sent two fruits. So far, more than two hours have passed, although I feel that the service is procrastinated and unprofessional, but it is finally done. I packed my luggage in the room and cleaned it. Before the customer service was delivered, I went around the surrounding sea world. After dinner, I returned to the hotel at around 9 o'clock in the evening. The fruit was delivered, and there was a large dehumidifier, which made obvious noise, and the humidity showed 66%. The room still smelled of damp, and the nose and throat felt irritated. Turn on the humidity to more than 80%, toss around 12 o'clock, the nasal cavity feels swollen, and the head is aching. I accidentally found that the irritation in the air was relieved after turning off the central air conditioner and dehumidifier and closing the bathroom door. I just slept like this overnight. The decisive factor that prompted me to make a bad review was that when I woke up at around 7 am to go to the bathroom, I opened the bathroom door and the stench filled the whole bathroom, and it lasted for a long time. We could only open the balcony door for ventilation (this hotel design Strange thing: There is no independent ventilation system in the bathroom, the ventilation and air-conditioning system in the whole room is automatically shut down when the balcony door is opened), the customer service called around 9:30 to check the situation, I said you can smell it yourself, even after more than 2 hours of ventilation, He hypocritically said to change the room for us to rest. I said that I don’t believe that the hotel doesn’t know about this situation, not to mention that we are going to go out and check out in the afternoon. Is it meaningful to change the room to rest at this time? Why did you go early? ! In addition, when we checked in, the front desk said that we would be upgraded to a room with a balcony. After learning about it, we realized that the room we booked originally had a balcony. The picture is the floor of the bathroom in the room.

Whether it is business or vacation, its location and landscape are undoubtedly the first choice for travel, and you can experience the unique culture of Shekou leisurely : The super-large outdoor swimming pool, who can resist the temptation to swim in the hot summer; the invincible sea view not far away is an excellent place for walking; if you like to run, put on running shoes and walk along the hotel path, Along the runway of Zhanqiao Park by the sea, you can see countless scenery along the way. I can't help but stop and take pictures of the scenery. Xiaofan at the front desk has a warm service attitude, because I was in a hurry at the time, and I was able to drive me in time Electric tickets, the overall check-in experience is really good. It may be because the passage at the entrance of the hotel is relatively narrow, and the waiting area is not enough; it would be great if the entrance can be strengthened to guide the reasonable diversion of people and vehicles. On the one hand, it can eliminate potential safety hazards; on the other hand On the one hand, the cars at the back don’t have to wait too long, and I hope that improvements can be made in the future.

It feels that there are fewer people queuing up than the main building. The sea view of the main building is good. I like the layout of the rooms in the South China Sea Wing. The bay windows and terraces of the suites are great. The location of the hotel is very good, the sea world is diagonally opposite, and it is very convenient to eat. It is also very close to the Shekou Cruise Terminal. The hotel has a shuttle bus directly to the hotel. The driver’s route takes a few traffic lights less than taking a taxi. Hotel staff are generally very enthusiastic, courteous and well-trained.

msg:I have absolute affection for Nanjiu, because it was there when I was a child, and I always wanted to live there once if I had the opportunity. This time, it was the first stop when I came back to Shekou, but I couldn’t check in because I arrived at 8 o’clock in the morning and there was no vacant room. After the renovation, the inside has no longer the appearance I remembered from my childhood, but the appearance is still so friendly. I was still unable to check in after wandering outside until noon. At this time, a very kind lady at the front desk learned that I had been unable to check in when I arrived early in the morning, so she upgraded me to a room so that I could enter the room to rest as soon as possible. I was very tired at the time, but I was immediately warmed up. This is the quality that hotel staff should have. People-oriented, I am very grateful to her. The room was very nice, I sat on the balcony and ordered lunch in the restaurant to enjoy the view. The environment of the hotel is very beautiful, and it is very comfortable to stroll around in the yard. Nanjiu should be the memory of many people in Shekou in the early years. I hope it will get better and better.

Before booking the hotel, I called to ask if there was a parking lot. The staff said that I was about to drive there, but said that it was full and asked me to park in the back of the hotel. I didn’t want to help me with my luggage. The poor service made me not believe this The level of the hilton, it is very inconvenient to order takeaway and take two elevators to get it from the ba*****t downstairs.


Second room poor
I booked a bay view room and gave me a room looking at a pair of rotten buildings. I can hardly see the bay view. The bedside chairs in the room are all peeled off, the carpet is dirty, the buttons are painted, and the cabinets are also painted. The windows are dirty Dirty distributors and a bunch of rotten buildings can't believe that this is what a 5-star hotel can have.

Third poor sanitation
I took the elevator to the lobby on the 2nd floor and there was a damp and musty smell, a bit like the smell of the bathroom, it was very disgusting.

Before coming here, the lobby manager of the hotel contacted me on Weibo to post the location and set the room type. The service is very considerate. Because there is a balcony and the room is large enough, with a wide view, waking up in the morning to listen to the birds singing, a great experience.
The afternoon tea experience for two provided with the package is also good.
When the hotel heard that I wanted an extra bed, they even came to help me open the sofa and change it to a bed, which saved me a lot of money.
There are Sea World and Nanhai Yiku nearby. There are various dishes from various countries, and there are many choices. After dinner and in the morning, take a walk along the coast to heal yourself.
This is one of the hotels with the best scenery and the best service in the urban area, and it is very suitable for a vacation mode of sneaking in.

There is only this sea view hotel within a hundred miles, where you can eat, drink and have fun. The last few times I was on a business trip. This time I stayed here for a rest. I had a good rest. Every time I met with Annie, the butler, she is worthy of recognition. She is attentive and professional, and I often come back to recommend and support her.

Before I checked in, I received a greeting call from the front desk manager Phoebe Xiaoxiong to help arrange the room, which was very considerate. The front desk is full of beauties and handsome guys, and the service is very good. The hotel room has a beautiful view, and it is really rare to be so close to the sea in Shekou, where every inch of land is precious. But the hotel has been open for some years, and the facilities and equipment are a bit outdated. The hotel should be renovated, otherwise such a good hotel would be a fly in the oin**ent. The hotel service is also very good, it is worth everyone to choose~~~

This is the worst Hilton hotel I have ever experienced since I stayed in the hotel for a long time. Give 100 bad reviews! ! !
1) The toiletries are extremely poor, the scalp and skin are allergic after washing, the smell is a strong chemical smell, 100 times worse than that of Vienna Hotel and Orange Hotel, so angry that I want to curse.
2) The tea leaves are broken tea bags, 0.25 yuan a bag, not tea bags, which are several grades worse than the whole season hotel. Drinking diarrhea, this is a five-star hotel, so heartless, providing such poor supplies.
3) The toothbrush lost hair, which made my mouth full of hair, and I was almost spit into my stomach.
4) The toothpaste is also very bad. I don’t know what brand it is, but it’s just bad.

Every time I come to Shekou, I will choose Hilton. Because I am familiar with it and it is convenient for me to be close to the pier. I go out early every day and return late every day. I just need to sleep and. But... this stay makes me feel different about this hotel same cognition.
Ms. Annie, the housekeeper, had already contacted me before I arrived at this hotel. Because of the epidemic, Ms. Annie carefully interpreted Shenzhen's policies. After confirming that I can check in and telling me to check in, I can take us to do nucleic acid. In this era of rampant epidemic, this warm reminder and help has already surprised me.
After arriving at the store, the driver and I took a little over 3 minutes to check in. For us who travel long distances, we feel that the speed is really fast (manual thumbs up 👍)
Then Annie took us to do the nucleic acid test and reminded us of the time for the next nucleic acid test.
I certainly believe that this is the service concept and purpose that a five-star hotel should have, and I also believe that Ms. Annie is doing her own job well. But as a hotel professional and a hotel controller, this kind of service attitude and meticulous patience It is indeed worthy of my praise and encouragement. There is no perfect hotel, but there can be flawless service.. To Shekou Hilton

Asked to change the room, the waiter also said that the musty smell is really big after coming. Second: I accidentally saw a door open next to the wardrobe. I opened it and looked at the strong and weak electrical boxes in the whole room. I really don't understand how this design was designed. Even if there is no place to put it, it should be locked anyway. Are there children safe? Third: I was ready to go to bed at night. As soon as the quilt was lifted, God, with such a long hair, I collapsed, because I was very tired all day, and I didn’t want to toss any more, so I slept reluctantly all night. I have to give a bad review for this experience, and I have to tell everyone around me that such a hotel cannot be visited.

The housekeeper Annie contacted in advance to arrange the check-in on the day of check-in, upgraded the room type, and prepared gifts for the children, so that the children could stay together. Happy to be in the store. During the stay in the hotel, if you need to contact the housekeeper Annie, she will solve it as soon as possible. The hotel also has nucleic acid testing from 3:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, which is very convenient. The housekeeper Annie will notify you in time, so you are not afraid to take the baby to play and miss the nucleic acid test. Personally, the variety and quality of the hotel's breakfast are better than those of the two parent-child hotels in InterContinental. The breakfast yogurt is of the same brand as the Ritz-Carlton's, and children with strawberry and ice cream flavors like it very much. The hotel has outdoor parent-child entertainment facilities, opposite to Sea World, and next to Nuwa Binhai Park, which is very suitable for family travel.

It is very convenient to walk to eat, drink and play. I have lived in Shenzhen for 15 years, and I often come to Shekou.

The room is very warm, the cloakroom is designed with scheming, the mattress is moderately firm and soft, and the rooms can provide buckwheat and latex pillows.
Too bad the toilet is not smart.

In the early morning, the beauty of the sunrise over the sea can bring a good mood for the day.
The Roujiamo and the almond croissants produced every day for breakfast at the hotel are very good!

It was a bit late on the day of check-in. I booked the main building, and was sent to the south building. I was confused. Fortunately, with the help of Freya Wang at the front desk, I successfully regained my good mood, thank you!

The hotel butler said that he would upgrade me to a suite for free. I was thinking about it at first, but the butler ran and took photos and videos of the two rooms for me. After comparing, I agree to upgrade. It's hard work and nice little housekeeper~ This suite is really very suitable for arranging marriage proposals! ! The small living room of the room has a small balcony with sea view (we get up early the next morning to watch the sunrise), and there are multiple sliding doors, which can give the girlfriend a sense of mystery and surprise, and friends and relatives can also hide it for surprises. Thanks to the two friends for setting up the venue together! !

msg:To commemorate the first anniversary, I chose the Hilton Nanhai Hotel again.

The predecessor of the hotel was the famous Nanhai Hotel in Shenzhen. The childhood memories of Shenzhen people are now under Hilton.

On September 17, I arrived at the front desk at about 2:00 pm. I encountered a large number of people checking in, and I waited in line for a while. When I checked in, I learned that I needed to wait for a room. I didn’t expect it to be so popular during the epidemic.

Annie Chen at the front desk helped to upgrade the room and presented soft drink coupons in the lobby bar, so that we could wait in the lobby bar and not have nowhere to go.

The room size is relatively large, the air conditioning is powerful, and the bathing facilities meet the Hilton standard, but room 1205 may be overused, and the soap box on the showerhead in the shower has been broken and cannot be replaced in time.

At 9:00 am on Sunday, 9.18, the hotel began to hear the sound of renovations. I called the front desk to respond that the 11th floor was in the maintenance room. This time was really bad.

The breakfast is rich, there are some Cantonese snacks, there are outdoor seats, if the weather is not hot, you can enjoy the sea view breakfast.

The parking lot is free for guests, and there are many parking spaces, which is great.

Walking to the Sea World and the Art Center are within 100 meters, so it is very convenient to eat, drink and play.

When I check in, I fill in the form to choose, and there are nucleic acid testing points. I do not need to travel far to do nucleic acid in the hotel. Arrangements, special times, make the guests feel at ease. The sea view of the room is also very beautiful. At a glance, the sea view treats the body and mind. If there is no epidemic, if you live in this hotel, you can walk on the seaside plank road, which is really beautiful.

        The shortcomings are as follows, and I hope the hotel can do better: 1. The room hygiene is slightly inaccurate, such as the wash basin wall is a little stained and not cleaned; 2. The breakfast cafeteria has a long queue and disorder, and it is the first time to eat in a five-star hotel Breakfast is such a large food stall and waiting in line, and there are people in the middle who say that they can't go in and get two eggs and come out... It's a bit unbearable! 3. During the stay, I called the service center twice to ask for some supplies, but no one answered; 4. A family of four and two rooms are divided into different floors, and the room cards cannot be exchanged on different floors. To exchange supplies, they must go to the lobby on the second floor to meet. A bit inconvenient for the elderly. If the cause of the epidemic is so understandable for the time being, it is recommended to be more humane from the perspective of service, so that one card can be used to swipe the floor where the relatives who live with you are located!
        In general, under the epidemic, you can't travel far during the holidays, and the east is congested with traffic. This is a good choice for vacation⛱️ experience.

msg:Hilton Shenzhen Shekou Nanhai Hotel exceeded our expectations! The first is the hotel service. The housekeeper Xiao Chen contacted us one day in advance to let us know how to get to the hotel and let us know that the little housekeeper will greet us and go through the formalities when we arrive at the hotel, which makes us very reassured. Sure enough, when we arrived at the hotel, Xiao Chen personally greeted us and helped us check in. The hotel waiter served us professionally, and then led us all the way to the elevator and guest room, and introduced catering and other services. We brought the children and got a small hotel gift from Xiao Chen. Make us feel warm. The architectural style of the hotel is very gorgeous, clean and comfortable, we like it very much. The buffet breakfast and dinner are very rich and the seafood is very fresh, a little pricey but great. I think the Hilton Nanhai Hotel in Shekou is better than other Hiltons we have stayed in!

The two seaside rooms that my classmates and I booked were not next to each other. They were far away, which was inconvenient. I called to express my dissatisfaction, and the hotel immediately allocated two adjacent rooms.
Spacious, comfortable, suitable for punch-in, afternoon tea is also very romantic and beautiful, if there are less snacks in afternoon tea, it would be better with a fruit plate, too many desserts to eat, girls prefer fruit

msg:Because the swimming pool, breakfast, and parking lot are in the main building, I paid more for a suite in the main building. The area, facilities and landscape are better than those in the south wing. The biggest advantage is the considerate service. From the beginning of the check-in to the check-out, there is a special person to connect with you. There are also different small gifts for boys, girls and girls. After the afternoon tea appoin**ent is late, I communicated with the lobby bar manager and offered other gifts. The pastries and drinks were very smooth, and later they also took the initiative to pack freshly baked snacks for delivery. I hope that the indoor swimming pool and gym can be reopened as soon as possible. The outdoor swimming pool is more friendly to children. It will be better to open up some recreational items for children in the future~

msg:Going to the most beautiful sea view in Shenzhen city, as a Shenzhen native, the more purpose is to observe Shenzhen from different angles, and at the same time to see the specific quality of the hotel. The hotel is divided into two parts, the old and the new. In terms of scenery, the main building has a better view, but in terms of a**osphere and comfort, the South Wing Hotel is more warm and comfortable, because I have had afternoon tea many times and felt it. In terms of transportation, you can reach the sea world within 200 meters. Needless to say, this convenience can be treated positively. There is no unpleasant aspect. Although it was arranged to have tea in the executive lounge while waiting, it still exposed management problems to a certain extent. In terms of facilities, the desks and chairs are slightly outdated. The elevator in the main building is not clearly marked, and I took the wrong seat several times. The scenery should be relatively open, and there is a big gap with the deep blue water of Yantian, but the urban areas are all shallow seas, and this is the only way. Comprehensive cost performance, I personally think that the price is a bit high, and then 1500 may be relatively suitable during this period!

Different from the high-rise CBD distribution center in Shekou, Futian District, this long-standing foreigner living distribution center has deposited many time-honored bars, western restaurants, coffee houses, and bakeries. Many old trees, old streets, old villas, old docks, old streets The city here is both retro and foreign, and the air is filled with leisure and laziness.
The predecessor of Hilton Shekou was Nanhai Hotel, the first batch of foreign guests reception hotels. The quality and standard are there, you know
This time I chose the main building that was added later instead of the south wing
The hotel is just next to Sea World, Sea Art Center, and Prince Bay Pier. It is very convenient to walk for 5-10 minutes. The sea view can be regarded as one of the selling points.

Service: The housekeeper Annie contacted me the day before check-in and learned that it was a birthday with my best friend. She arranged birthday arrangements, room upgrades, early check-in and a glass of red wine for me. It was really thoughtful and it was really a home away from home experience. Thank you. This is the third time I have arranged for my best friend to celebrate her birthday at the hotel. Only this hotel gave me red wine, which really surprised me a bit. Chong this point will recommend friends for birthday 🎂

Dining: There are many restaurants with online appearance and connotation around the hotel

Facilities: The lobby bar on the 1st floor and the sunset bar on the 16th floor can properly enjoy the sea view and the sea breeze. There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools to enjoy.

If you have to make comments, it is that the production of breakfast needs to be improved

2. The front desk and welcome service are very good. The hard-working little brother even went to help me push two big boxes upstairs at night. The cleaning staff on the side of the guest room is also very good.
3. The breakfast is simple but the taste is ok
4. The buffet dinner category is mostly concentrated on desserts and seafood, plus a service fee of 468. In-house guests get a 25% discount and receive 360. There are several methods such as crabs and oysters. There are several methods, but I think there is a problem with the welcome service for dinner. The one who was in charge of the payment and the one who was in charge of leading the way I told the two of you to hang the house account and lead the way to the table also took the initiative to ask my room number. I thought it would be fine, but when I was leaving, the one who received the payment called me again. Live me ask how do I pay? ? I can only tell her again that I want to hang up the room account and tell her the room number. It's like I want to eat Bawang meal, which is very uncomfortable ?
5. It took more than 40 minutes for the food delivery service to arrive. I think it's a little slow, but it's understandable. It's quite late after all.
On the whole, I am satisfied. If you leave out dinner, it is really uncomfortable. It is a very good Hilton.

msg:I often stay in star hotels and this 5 star hotel disappointed me. Checked in during the May 1st holiday, waited in line for 30 minutes, and asked me to wait 1 hour after registration for the front sea view room I booked. I agreed. It's good to wait another 15 minutes, but it's not good to go again. I decided to stand at the front desk and not leave. This hotel is obviously not enough to handle so many guests. In the end, I can only change a room. Fortunately, it still has a sea view, otherwise I will complain. .
The outdoor swimming pool is right next to the breakfast room. It is not large, there is no privacy, and it is crowded. The indoor swimming pool can only be so small that it can only soak in water, which is very disappointing. In addition, the hygiene is not good enough. There is nothing to play in the children's playground on the 3rd floor. I am super disappointed. If it is not for the blessing of Nuwa Beach and Sea World, this hotel is really unsatisfactory.

The scenery is good, the facilities are perfect, it is very comfortable to take a walk by the sea, and it is very convenient to walk to the sea world to eat.
On May 1st, two couples were married on different lawns. It was so beautiful.
Recommended bay view room, quiet, good view

msg:The service ability of the hotel is low. Suddenly, there are so many people that it is impossible to deal with the May Day. The check-in waiter maliciously controls the room. It is almost three o'clock and the check-in does not give the room. It is simply unreasonable. Although it was finally resolved through complaints, it brought a bad experience and mood. It was almost three o'clock in the afternoon, and the check-in queue was almost queuing outside the hotel. The check-in process was slow, and the waiters were talking a lot of nonsense, and none of the actual check-in needs could be met. Booking a room through Ctrip obviously has the right to extend the stay for 2 points, but I don't give it. It is said that it will not be given on May 1, and then I can give it again after a complaint. In short, the store is bullying customers. not on. Today, it takes more than ten minutes to check in, and it takes swiping cards and signing. To be honest, I haven’t seen a five-star hotel with such backward equipment for a long time.

msg:During the holiday, I stayed at Hilton for two consecutive nights, and upgraded to a sea view room the next day. The view was very good. The biggest impression of the hotel to me is that it is clean and comfortable, and the service is good. Although there are a lot of people during the holiday and the check-in is relatively slow, it is not chaotic during the busy schedule. The buffet breakfast is not bad, there are not many varieties, and the taste is not bad. The children like the hotel very much, and have the opportunity to stay again next time.

msg:This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, not as good as some chain brands.
Hygienic environment:
I lived in a room in the main building, and I specially considered that it would be newer than the South Sea Wing. As a result, the floor where I live and the floor where my colleagues live have the same problem. As soon as I get out of the elevator, there is a strong smell of dryness and damp, which is so serious that it almost smells like urine. It feels extremely uncomfortable. Do you usually not clean or maintain the carpet?

The scale in the bathroom basin and bathroom is very thick, and it can be seen that there is no attention to maintenance at all. I have lived in a hotel opened in 2017 or 18 before, and it is not like this.

Mottled white stains can be clearly seen on the sofa in the room, and the desk top is also bulging due to damp.

other:
1/ The doorbell in the room is very loud, every time I sleep, I can be woken up by the super loud doorbell ringing from above my head!
2/ Sound insulation is poor
3/ The breakfast is unpalatable
4/There are so many weddings on weekdays or weekends, sometimes there are two or three weddings a day, and the nucleic acid in the hotel in the afternoon can only be lined up with the wedding party! Every time it takes a long time.

In addition, because we are a company group booking, we will go through the group booking process in the early stage. As a result, the efficiency of stamping is extremely slow. Most of the 20th chapters have been opened, and an internal stamp was stamped from the National Day to the end of October. It was also extremely slow to issue tickets when leaving the store. I have already explained that they will be issued in advance and I will catch the plane the next day. As a result, when I got to the front desk, I was told that it was not open. I left the billing information indicating that I would pick it up half an hour later, but I went to the front desk half an hour later, and it still didn't open! ! !

From before check in to check out all I can say is enough!

msg:The rooms are all wood-colored as a whole, and the overall holiday style is full. This style reminds me that it is somewhat similar to edition. But I have never punched in the edition, but it is estimated that the materials of the edition should be better. Because the burrs of the wooden furniture in the Hilton room are more obvious, and the sofa pillows have a lot of pilling. However, the advantage of the log color is that although it has been renovated for many years, it does not look old.
As for the floor height problem and the balcony tile problem mentioned by the forum, there are indeed cases where the floor height is low, and it may be more obvious if the height is taller. However, it is recommended to book a sea view room. The open sea view should alleviate some floor height problems. As for the balcony tiles, I quite like this combination, it feels like some old elements are retained.

msg:I have stayed at this Hilton before, and the experience was very good. I chose it for the second time. I didn't expect the second stay to be so unpleasant.
   The first is to check in. It was Valentine's Day. I booked a big bed room three or four days in advance. Luna in the front office arranged a double bed room for me, and there was no sea view. The entrance was the construction site (picture 1), I asked I changed rooms, and told the hotel that I had stayed in the same room type as the previous order, and changed the room for me. The result was a basically unchanged twin room. I called the front desk patiently and explained that I needed a double room, and The last time I was similar, a staff member at the front desk told me to wait a moment, but I heard another staff member on the phone say: if she wants a big bed, she will tell her no. Basically, I understand the work attitude of the front office staff. It is not the reason why you fool customers that the big bed room is sold on Valentine's Day.
   I changed rooms three times and finally made a big bed for me. It turned out to be facing the city. I was completely speechless and didn’t agree. The concierge took me to the front desk of the executive floor. I arranged a big bed with sea view downstairs for me, and told me emphatically: Although you are on the executive floor, you do not have any executive courtesy. I laughed in my heart. I only wanted to live in the king-size room I ordered, and I never asked for the executive floor. Where did this come from being arrogant and unreasonable?
Finally got into the big bed, an hour has passed since check in, I don't want to toss any more. This room is the elevator entrance and the Unicom room. It is very noisy in the middle of the night. The next door speaks clearly, and someone repeatedly unlocks the Unicom door.
   After returning to the room after dinner on the first night, the manager on duty that day called the guest room, understood the situation, apologized, sent fruit and white wine, and helped us change to a suite the next day, and continued to follow up, she showed the South China Sea The service level that Hilton should have, thank her for her handling and follow-up, so that the two-day stay was not so bad. ps: All the sockets in the bedroom of the suite are broken. After more than ten minutes of repairing in the middle of the night, I finally took out the socket... and it was helpless.
Check out to help carry luggage to the car, very meticulous, generally can only comment like this, maybe there is a chance to go.

Later, I probably made a complaint. The housekeeper and manager dealt with it in time. An unpleasant incident happened in the parking lot. The security attitude of the parking lot was very bad. It didn’t look like a five-star hotel at all. The security attitude of a normal community should not be so bad, let alone Is it five stars?! The experience of the whole family was very bad, but because the manager and the housekeeper actively helped to deal with the problem, so forget it~ But, the experience is really bad, the buffet tastes good, and the rest is fine~ The room is so small~ I don’t recommend it,

msg:Just after the New Year’s Eve from the "Hotel in the Scenic Area" (OCT InterContinental Hotel), I came to the "Hotel in the Construction Site" (Nanhai Hotel) for New Year's Day. There is no comparison, and it really does not hurt... There are four construction sites around the hotel, and there are construction disputes. Time grabs progress, even holidays, 24 hours of uninterrupted piling and knocking, so that the beauty is blocked by the voice...

The overall decoration of the hotel is very good. It is divided into two parts. One is a new building with beautiful scenery but uncomfortable under direct sunlight; the other is an old building with a good layout but mostly blocked by the yacht club building. The rooms are not arranged properly. , It will make people feel regretful...

The elevators in the hotel are a bit rounded, unfamiliar and time-consuming; the room is a bit rusty and mottled (see the photo taken), and the water cups are placed in pockets. It is too uncomfortable to drink water; toothbrushes can be provided for children, but they cannot be provided Children’s toothpaste; Simmons mattresses are very uncomfortable to sleep (compared to the previous one); at night, the outdoor children’s playground facilities are not only damaged, but also lack the necessary lighting, causing the child to be hit by a pole when playing, causing a big bag...

The good places are: the open-air bar on the top floor at night, the Shekou scenery is the most spectacular; the buffet restaurant in the morning is rich in variety and very delicious; the front desk staff of the South China Sea Wing actively and conscientiously provide services to customers in the evening, obviously more attention than the people on the other side Concentrated; there are free indoor children's sports halls, children's facilities and swimming pools...

Check in here on New Year's Day 2022

When it comes time to come, the Master will also; when it comes time to go, the Master will follow.

The sheets must have been dirty and disgusting because they were not changed in time. This shows that the hotel management is not very concerned about hygiene management. Over time, the cleaning staff will also think that this is... Hotel standard! I made a birthday request for room decoration in advance and am a germaphobe. After waiting for 2 hours, it was just a perfunctory welcome ceremony with two pieces of cloth folded on the sheets and a few flower petals. Compared to other five-star and luxury hotels, there was no fruit and no electronic files. The blessing cards and simple exquisite decorations can be balloons or pendants. What I waited for 2 hours was an ordinary cleaning with a strong smell of disinfectant. I expected no surprises in the 1700 sea view room. Only one person wanted me to return. house desire. After experiencing the Perennial Hotel, when I saw your Hilton, I was really in awe!
The birthday card is not printed as an electronic greeting card. It can be seen that it is a temporary handwriting. It is recommended to change it to an electronic greeting card. The cost is not high. On the contrary, guests will feel that the hotel pays attention to this matter and the sense of ceremony will be enhanced. There are no drinks in the minibar. They need to be downloaded through the guest room TV. It seems very inconvenient to place an order, and customers may not necessarily purchase it, but we must provide customers with diverse choices and convenience, rather than placing orders through a complicated system!
The staff in the hotel lobby did not give people a very warm attitude. The staff did not say hello the whole time they passed by. I criticized but also praised the uncle at the concierge. He has the warm attitude that a hotel person should have. Really regard this job as your own profession, make customers feel enthusiastic and gain their recognition and respect at the same time! Before and after checking into the hotel, I did not see the butler once. I suggest that when guests celebrate special holidays in the future, you can go to the guests in person to say happy holidays, and humbly ask the guests if they are dissatisfied with the hotel and have some suggestions. I will be very happy to accept this blessing and feel that the hotel takes it seriously. I was bitten on the lawn during afternoon tea while waiting for check-in. I told the housekeeper and there was no question whether I was feeling unwell or if I could get one. Insect repellent water, the details show that the hotel attaches great importance to the service attitude of guests!
It is recommended that hotel management pay more attention to details. After all, hotels of the same level have better diversified choices. Guests pay more attention to the hotel's hygienic environment and some details. Pay a small cost to let guests experience that the hotel is really doing things with care. , wouldn’t it be better to gain more repeat customers!
Secondly, when the engineering depar**ent entered the room to repair the balcony light, they did not change disposable shoe covers and came in naturally wearing leather shoes. This shows that the hotel does not have strict requirements for training and pays attention to the guest's mysophobia problem!
The Xiaohongshutan store boasts a lot of things, and the accommodation is mediocre. The sea view suite costs 1,700, and the sanitary service is not as enthusiastic as the DoubleTree Hotel under the same brand. If you are traveling for business, it is suitable to stay. If you are on vacation to see the sea, I really don’t recommend it. Extremely low cost performance!

The hotel environment is still a bit worse than that of Marriott's store in Shenzhen. There is no fruit in the hotel room, which is equivalent to double the room rate. In the deposit, the minibar was empty, not even a bottle of water, the breakfast was not satisfactory, and the deposit refund was very slow, I didn’t like this shop very much.

msg:These three points are the service manager who gave me late check-out, Jackson Wang from the concierge depar**ent, and the concierge colleagues who helped me send sunglasses to my family. ...From the time I called the hotel, I was upset. Check in a room of 1788 and let a child's breakfast be given. The front desk has no permission to say no. I called the switchboard and transferred to the reservation depar**ent and said it was busy. Let me call you later. Of course, I asked the reservation depar**ent to call me. I came to book a room. I have already made two calls. Why should I call me a third time? …The room is pretending to be B, and the finished room is sealed, indicating that it has been cleaned according to the standard and that no one has ever entered. As soon as I entered, the floor was scratched, the balcony lights were not bright, the small refrigerator was super slow, the ice was always at room temperature all afternoon, the wires and towels leaking from the TV were the dirtiest I have ever stayed in. Is this still a ready-made standard room for sale? Call to ask if there is any welcome fruit, and call back to say no. That is, guests are not welcome to spend 1788 in the hotel. There really are you. Soon after I moved in, I knocked on the door and said to kill the floor drain. There was something wrong with it. The engineering depar**ent repaired the lights, and I said that I would never check it here. What breaks the standard? …………The house is not inspected or repaired. They even sell it, and the guests in the suite don't even have a welcome fruit. I don’t want to add a child’s breakfast. Do you still have a business attitude? A room with afternoon tea, let the afternoon tea be delivered to the room, and say no, it is really so disturbing. It is not good to send children breakfast, there is no welcome fruit (I am not welcome), and afternoon tea cannot be delivered to the room. I really admire you.

I accidentally fixed the South China Sea Wing-color guest room and found it is a very sensual hotel. The exterior looks like a building with a period of time, but there is no trace of renovation inside. Everything is reasonable and natural. The rooms are in log style, simple yet elegant. The room is fully equipped, so that I was awakened by the alarm clock at one o'clock in the morning. It took a long time to find the alarm clock and stop the ringing. After a while, the alarm went off again...Finally, the power was unplugged directly. I have to say that the alarm clock sounds very loud. Special and pleasant to the ear, it is a sincere product, but it rang when it shouldn't be annoying...
        Get up the next day and you can see the Shenzhen Bay Bridge from the balcony. Going downstairs to swim, I found that the hotel’s sports facilities are more complete. The swimming pool is two meters deep and very professional.
       During the National Day, do not "add blockage", stay in place and discover a different Shenzhen😎

There are also Chinese restaurants where you can get a discount when you stay in the restaurant. You didn’t tell us when you checked in on the first day.

msg:The location of the hotel is awesome. It is not only quiet and not easily disturbed, but also only one step away from the bustling commercial district. In such a convenient and clean location, I can't find a second one in Shenzhen.
The south wing of the hotel has been around for a few years. Although the hardware conditions are not the best in five-star hotels, it is clean and hygienic, and the mattresses are very comfortable.
The most commendable thing is that every staff member is very friendly and responds positively and promptly to any needs. Such a service attitude cannot be achieved by spending money on renovations, it is very rare.
The only regret is the children’s club. There is a larger outdoor playground for children in the south wing (this is also rare in a five-star hotel in Shenzhen), but the summer day is too hot and too dry to stay. The indoor children's playground is very perfunctory, with only one large empty room. Most of the children looked at the door, then turned and left. Hope it can be improved in the future.

msg:A five-star hotel with the worst management in recent years. I wanted to go to the swimming pool on the first floor. I called the service desk and told me that there were two pairs of rubber slippers in the closet. After looking for a big round, I asked them to send ordinary cotton slippers. After waiting for a full 30 minutes, they did not send them again. When I went to the call, another waiter told me that there were some rooms with rubber slippers. After ten minutes, the waiter finally brought slippers up. After asking him, he told me that there were rubber slippers but they had been cancelled. The three waiters gave me three different answers. At this time, it was almost an hour wasted to go downstairs just to have rubber slippers. When we took the swimming goggles and swimming caps to the swimming pool on the first floor, we discovered that a bunch of people went in without the swimming caps. The lifeguards didn’t care. They put on the swimming goggles and put on the floating hair under the water. What was outrageous was a large yellowish unwashed dirt on the pool wall near the sea, so I hurried up. As a regular customer of Ctrip for so many years, it seems to be the first time to comment. No matter the hardware and software experience is too bad, the hotel is indeed close to the sea world.

When the front desk checked in, it was a man who told us that the room booked was on the 11th floor. It was not an invincible sea view room like we looked at the picture when we booked on Ctrip. The sea view can only be seen from the balcony. There is no sea view in the room... asked if we need to change to a room with half sea view and half city view on the 7th floor, but this floor is relatively low, and we have begun to be a little disappointed. The attitude of the waiter was really not very good. He asked him which direction the sea view room was facing, and could he see the sunrise or sunset? He didn’t know at all, and couldn’t answer... so he wondered if he was a newcomer (his age is really not like a newcomer), really not, just "never a guest asks such a question" , Too unprofessional. Finally, we spent money to upgrade the executive suite on the 9th floor. Enjoyed afternoon tea in the lounge, the lounge’s diet is a bit simple, but they all suit the taste. Most of the sea view and part of the city view can be seen from the balcony of the room. The night view is good, and you can see the sunrise when you wake up the next morning. The breakfast is very rich and delicious! Had a great time for two days! The handsome waiter who helped us carry the luggage to the room was very nice and carefully introduced the location of the breakfast lounge in the room on the floor. Auntie Cleaning is going to give it a big praise! When we returned to the room, she was doing sanitation. She reminded us to try to open the door with the room card to make sure that we didn't go to the wrong room. After confirmation, she also thoughtfully provided bath towels, tea set, mineral water, etc. according to our requirements. When we checked out, the front desk was a beautiful waiter with a very good attitude, patience and professionalism. He also answered some of our confusions when we checked in, and told us that the view of the room next door would be better as we estimated after checking in, but At that time, the room type was full. After completing the formalities, the little beauty also carefully instructed us to write a review on Ctrip to earn points to chase the deposit...Haha, I am still happy when I leave the hotel.

The area is still quite large, with gardens, corridors and a small swimming pool in the middle. It's next to the sea, but you can't go to the sea. Hong Kong is across the sea (see Figure 2).
The interior decoration of the two buildings is still high-end, and the waiter's service is also in place. I forgot to take pictures of the interior rooms. For me, a person who does not pay attention to food but pays attention to living, the rooms did not disappoint me.
Within a ten-minute walk of the hotel, there is a commercial city called Sea World (see Figure 4), which is mainly a variety of specialty restaurants, which should be the highlight of that area.

When I first arrived at the hotel, I originally booked the sea view suite in the south wing, which was newly renovated, but the intern at the front desk said that their remaining room in the south wing had a bad view and suggested that I change the room in the main building to a better and newer environment. I think it's okay too! However, the manager at the front desk said that because the guest room was too full the day before yesterday, the room card would be prepared for me after the sanitation was done. As a hotelier, I can understand and say yes. As a result, I went to the front desk to pick up the card at night. The service at the front desk was terribly poor and asked me to queue up. I was already checking in. Why did I just pick up the card and wait so long because there were friends waiting at the time. Too long. What surprised me even more after entering the room was that the new performance of the so-called new room was that even the buttons were recessed as shown in the picture. I spent the money to live in Andaz to live in a room like this is really speechless.

It perfectly interprets facing the sea, spring blossoms, and a ray of tranquility in the bustling downtown. It is highly recommended. The drawback is that smoking in the room was fined 800 yuan. , But this is also to pay for my lack of consciousness and learn a lesson

The lobby of the main building of the hotel is very tall, so you can only see half of the sea when you book a room with a curved view. The breakfast is good. The combination of Chinese and Western varieties is diverse. The waiter will close at any time. The buffet at noon and evening is discounted at the hotel. I tried it well. The crayfish marinated in the evening is very delicious.

msg:During the Dragon Boat Festival, I couldn't go out and wanted to relax. I decided to stay in a seaside hotel. I first booked Kaisa Marriott. Later I considered that there was nothing but the hotel. I cancelled it and rebooked Hilton. After hesitating for a long time in the South Wing and the main building, after reading the evaluation, I finally chose the South Wing Nanhai Set and Linhai Set. The Nanhai suite is really big, with three balconies. The biggest advantage is that the sofa can be pulled out to make a bed, but the facilities are old and the most unbearable is that it is too damp, and the sheets feel wet. The lobby manager called to find out the situation and changed both rooms to the main building. The room in the main building is indeed small and has a sea view that is not as good as the south wing. But first of all, the room is not humid, and it is very convenient to have breakfast, swim, and the executive lounge. No need to take a car. I feel that the best sea views of the main building are in public places, the swimming pool on the third floor, the executive lounge on the 15th floor, and the bar on the 16th floor is the most beautiful view. You can also bring children. The last thing I want to say is that the hotel’s service is the best. Whether it is the manager or any employee, it can be seen that they are sincerely willing to provide the best service to the guests. This is the soul of the hotel.

msg:這次首先訂了兩晚南海翼的山景房，但伴侶希望看海景，前台姐姐很好幫我們升級了看到海的套房，太貼心了。房間素雅乾淨，感覺是日式家居裝潢，讓人放鬆。早上叫了in-room早餐，奄列很棒！

嚐了中菜館隨軒，太值了。套餐超值再點了燒肉。粥和燒肉都很驚豔，服務員非常勤勉貼心（只是套餐菜單的單品有點重覆(?) 兩個餃都是蝦肉餡，甜品豬豬糕三件太多了）

回房後，清潔很到位，一早拾得妥妥。但因為酒店背山臨海，可能不知甚麼時候走進來一隻百足蟲…也是理解的，畢竟是大自然中的酒店。跟前台反映了一下，想轉到離山遠一點的望海翼，幾分鐘內便安排得到，而且是景觀開揚的好房間！ 再試了自助早餐，很多人，但Refill很快，不俗。

下次會試下潮洲菜！

msg:在深圳南海希爾頓酒店的兩晚體驗讓我們難忘。預訂的山景套房，不僅房間寬敞舒適，窗外的山景也格外寧靜，讓人感到身心舒暢。酒店大堂的設計高級且氣派，從進門的那一刻起就給人留下了深刻的印象。此外，酒店提供的免費停車服務也為我們的出行帶來了極大的便利，省去了尋找停車位的煩惱。整體來説，深圳南海希爾頓酒店的服務和設施都達到了高標準，是一次非常愉快的住宿體驗。

我定的南海翼，開始沒搞明白，南海翼是83年建的，前幾年裝修翻新了，明顯感覺建築已經很過時了，體驗感不好。
再説服務，簡直了，根本沒人理，衹有幾個估計是實習生的還比較勤快。
這個酒店性價比極低，和福田希爾頓，喜來登差得太遠。
這個價格，這個服務，不如住雅格獅丹公寓吧，一半的價格，反正都沒有服務。

msg:深圳最好的住宿體驗，有必要點評一下。
選擇原因: 搜了很多酒店，最終選擇了希爾頓南海翼家庭公寓，主要原因是我們家裡四個大人過來住，想住在一塊又不互相干擾，有足夠的互動空間。家人15年前來過深圳，印象也不深了，想讓他們體會一下深圳的獨特風景和人文，蛇口希爾頓應該是中國最早的五星級酒店了，位置得天獨厚，風景最佳。沒想到客房的客廳就有60+，這套公寓雙套房設計，另有一間海景書房，套間含各自衣帽間和衞生間，還有個客衞。你如果想用廚具客房服務會配齊。另外一大亮點就是有個超大露台，可以辦party那種，有100多平。長者説住起來就和家裡一樣，很成功的選擇。
服務: 迎賓、前台服務態度很好，有求必應，需求都是馬上解決，很温馨。
停車: 免費停車，車庫獨立電梯，車庫很大，車位也寬敞。
總之體驗超級好，下次類似需求一定還會住這家酒店和這個房型。其他圖片應該程序裏都有，我衹是選了兩張在大露台上拍的照片供參考。

2.前台服務人員服務態度（好像叫Tina）很好，我們入住晚了很熱情幫我們重新安排下午茶。
再説缺點:
1.早餐挺差，服務人員也比較懶散，引導入座，收拾盤子之類都不太熱情
2.步行可到達海上世界，吃的玩的很多

入住第一天，指示check in位置不清楚，員工服務態一般，好多時都要客人去詢問，不時提醒客人给予酒店好評，我覺得如果係好服務，客人一定會给予好評！
不過值得我稱讚是酒店食物，不過員工之態度一定要改善！

一進入酒店，我立刻被它的奢華感所震撼。大堂寬敞明亮，裝飾著精心挑選的家具和藝術品，營造出一種優雅和舒適的氛圍。入住的客房更是令人驚艷，寬敞明亮，充滿了現代感。床鋪看起來非常舒適，我很快就沉浸在了柔軟的床墊和舒適的被褥中。房間內還配備了一台大屏幕電視和一間寬敞的浴室，浴室內有一個大浴缸，讓我在舒適的環境中放鬆身心。

除了舒適的客房，酒店的設施和服務也非常出色。他們有一個豪華的游泳池區，見到不少住客都會去游水。另外酒店還提供多個餐廳和酒吧，供應各種美食和飲品，今次我就冇緣去嘗試。

整體而言，這家五星級酒店給我留下了深刻的印象。無論是它的奢華設施、舒適的客房還是壯麗的海景，都讓我感到非常滿意。如果你正在尋找一個放鬆身心、享受豪華體驗的地方，這家酒店絕對是你的不二之選。我期待著再次入住這家美妙的五星級海景酒店。

服務：由辦理入住一刻已經感受到前台的熱情款待￼，還自動詢問我們是否需要延遲退房￼。退房時因為行李較多，行李員還細心把我們的行李搬到車上放好。
環境：大堂設計獨特，還有足夠的座椅給客人休息。
房間：我們訂的是海景房間，景觀開陽，房間寬敞，需要的設備一應俱全。
早餐：很大的餐廳，環境舒適闊落，我們去的時候比較晚，人流較少，可以輕鬆享受早餐￼、選擇算多，不過味道一般。唯一的缺點是煎蛋的員工態度不是很友好￼！

整體來說是一次滿意的住宿體驗！

msg:一家三口，孩子十歲，原本預訂的是南海翼標準雙床房，辦理入住的時候前台主動給我們升級了花園套房，是一個大床房加一個客廳，客廳的沙發也可以睡。每次來住最喜歡南海翼這邊，有陽台，推開窗户可以呼吸新鮮空氣的房型，樓下的滿園葱鬱盡收眼底。雖然在城市之中，卻能感受到度假的愜意。雖然是老酒店，但是一推開門沒有潮濕和黴味，更沒有衞生間的異味。孩子不舒服正好在退房的時間睡著了，打電話前台很爽快的答應了延遲一個半小時退房，這一點很人性化，下次還會再來入住。

唯一有點不足的是頂樓封窗的陽台導致房間剛進去有一點點黴味兒，然後窗户的隔音性差了一點，晚上能聽到下面婚禮的主持，早上能聽到樓下打籃球

我們是兩個家庭帶小朋友一起去，以下說一說失望的原因。
1）酒店比較舊，除了窗外風景不錯以外。
2）我們是為了酒店的設施適合小朋友去￼才訂的，預訂時在TRIP.com是看到有室內遊樂場+室外遊樂場，但去到時室內遊樂場已改為其他用途，跟網上圖片不附。另外是泳池衛生不太理想，當天有別的小朋友在那邊吐了，也有其他小朋友在沖水那邊尿尿，有小朋友把用過的大毛巾掉進了水池，也沒人阻止，當然知道酒店員工也未必都能看到，但同一天發生太多事情所以影響了對酒店的印象。
3）衛生問題，第一次看到酒店大堂的洗手間是那麼￼髒的，一地的水都沒人處理，不是一個洗手間，去了兩個都是如此，連小朋友都大叫說為什麼會那麼髒。不知道是不是當天婚禮還有一些商業活動￼人流多所影響，但這也不是星級酒店該出現的問題。

當然有好的也要￼￼稱讚
1）早餐還可以，選擇算多的。
2）登記入住時去錯邊，但前台員工很好，很親切，我忘記她名字了，她是有幫酒店加分的，跟我們說路線那些都很清楚，謝謝她。
3）附近吃的玩的東西都挺多，地點方便。
4）風景是不錯的

小9人上車的我還沒來得及考慮如何處理，小管家已經迅速幫我把2間主樓客房都升級為套房，與原本定的南海翼的套房安排在了一起，便於我們和長者互相照顧。真的
萬分感謝~酒店的設施，服務，環境等，都匹配五星級
標準，我們是三胎家庭，卧室有嬰兒，客廳沙發床需要
睡倆兄弟，酒店每天都會配備更多的浴巾和水~酒店外
出1公里就是個休閑娛樂餐飲集一體的小商圈，非常適合帶長者入住。這次我們忘了帶通行證，臨近海關，走一次hk也是十分方便的。

大家知道在酒店結婚肯定是要進進出出房間很多次的，我知道酒店是出於安全考慮但是真的太不方便了，我是新娘我肯定不能一直守着手機接電話確認的，每位家人或者伴娘伴郎進入房間都打給我確認，真的暈死！！！我覺得需要進入房間的人直接能報出我電話或者生日身份證號後四位就能進房間就行了……
最後還是房間打掃的問題，婚禮結束之前我們續住了一晚我知道房間很亂留下了很多垃圾，所以才需要打掃房間，但是並沒有打掃乾淨！垃圾還是依舊留在地上🙂
對了！還有房間隔音問題，樓下海邊唱歌的聲音真的聽得清清楚楚還唱到很晚！都絕了！

第二天退房 電話告知 讓幫忙給好評 升級的樓層200多費用 退回。 後面一直為退回 電話催促幾次 又明確表明 會馬上退回。   直到20號 未退回 才電話溝通 説沒講過要退升級費用的事情
一個酒店 幾百塊錢 出爾反爾  為了人家的好評 騙來騙去。 建議攜程 不要再上這種垃圾酒店

提個小建議:行政酒廊個別服務人員（穿膠鞋的大姐）專業素養有待提高，第一次看到一個五星酒店，員工碰客人手臂讓人家讓開的。第一該員工手裡沒東西，第二等待幾秒，都沒有耐心嗎？非常沒有禮貌，自我意識太強了，服務人員基本的麻煩、謝謝、請都不會説。
行李員小夥子點贊，幫客人拿行李箱，連放置方向都會從客人方便的角度放置，非常細心！
