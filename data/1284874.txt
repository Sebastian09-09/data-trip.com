msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at Shangri-La Hotel, Sanya for two nights, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Phoebe for arranging an upgraded room for me, as well as allowing for a late check-out. These small gestures truly made my stay all the more enjoyable.

The upgraded room was spacious, elegantly furnished, and offered breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. The attention to detail in the room's design and amenities was evident, ensuring a comfortable and luxurious stay.

The hotel's staff were also exceptional, always friendly and attentive, going above and beyond to meet my needs. From the moment I checked in until the time of my departure, I felt genuinely welcomed and well-cared for.

In addition to the excellent accommodation, the hotel offered a wide range of amenities and facilities. The swimming pool was a refreshing oasis, and the on-site restaurants provided delicious culinary delights.

Overall, my stay at Shangri-La Hotel, Sanya was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of Phoebe's thoughtful arrangements, the luxurious accommodations, and the outstanding service left a lasting impression. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a memorable and delightful stay in Sanya. Thank you, Shangri-La Hotel, for an unforgettable experience!

All the high prices but non of the expected services you'd expect of a Shangri-La. 
It's very Chinese orientated, which let's be honest is fair enough, but I've stayed at far lesser hotels in Sanya with much better understanding of us "laowais".  It also seems to firmly go after the family market (which again is fine) but if you are sans children then maybe not the best option.

msg:This hotel is bad. Probably the worst Shangri-la I have stayed in the world. As a golden circle member this place does not live up to the branding as per expectation. It’s my first time traveling alone to Sanya with a 1.5 year old toddler, and as a form of familiarity I chose to stay in Shangri-la given their usual high standards in service, quality and experience. Within China, I’ve stayed in Shangri-La Shanghai, and the service was immaculate. 

When I checked in at 3pm, the room was not ready I had to wait for another half an hour. How is it not ready when check in time is at 3pm? I had a long flight and a toddler in hand with two huge luggage and a hand carrier yet no one offered any help, as “they were busy”. The counter was in total mess and the staff look very lost. After waiting for 30 minutes I finally gotten my special theme room, I was excited and couldnt wait to see my toddler’s expression when she sees the monkey toys. She was indeed very happy, but not long after, the toilet in the room emitted a foul smell! Ive booked their theme room as it was a special celebration for my toddler. I was told there is only one such room. They suggested to change us to another room or we risk hanging out with even more pungent smell with my toddler for at least an hour while the plumber fix it. They explained that the hotel is old and this foul smell is inevitable. Travelling with a toddler it was extremely inconvenient to be changing rooms and moving up and down. It was a  bummer because the whole idea of going to Shangri la Sanya was to let my kid enjoy the theme room with her favourite character. Imagine having to pay for a specific theme room and ending up with a poorer version. And I was so helpless with a toddler. Anyway I had to switch rooms, repacked my luggage, lugged them and my kid again. This new room had a poorer view it was slightly blocked, one floor lower, and not the same theme that I booked for so my kid didnt really enjoy. And Guess what, the toilet also emitted a foul smell after an hour. This time I had given up.

So we went for the hotel train ride for kids, the staff told me it was not available “as they said there is an excursion and guests are not allowed to use the train until very much later in the day”. If you travel with kids you’ll know they have sleep schedule and how to be using your services later in the day? So I pretty much wasted my day here in shangri la waiting to check in, changing rooms, walking to the train and never get to take it and going back to my room. The staff could at least informed us when we check in that the train was not available but they didnt.

The next day, had breakfast, I left my table to get a drink for my toddler, the waiter cleared all my food without even asking if I was done. Mine you, those food I took, I had to carry my kid all around the restaurant to bring them to the table, only to get them cleared out!! They should totally give me a discount on my room rates.

Then I arranged for airport transfer, they charge exorbitantly compared to other hotels, informed them to prepare a child seat a day before, they said ok, and yet they blatantly left that out. It was 4.30am in the morning there was no child seat and I had to carry my toddler the whole 3 hours journey in this ~USD400 airport transfer. The hotel wasnt even apologetic about it and the driver just rush me into the car and drove off. Not even caring for the safety of me and my baby!! I was tired and scared at the same time. I used to have very good things to say about Shang, but this one, I highly will never recommend this place to anyone going to Sanya. I hope if the right management sees this, to improve on your hotel standards.

msg:I wouldn’t stay here again. It’s not worth it. In my 5+ years of living in China and using Trip.com, this is the first time I’ve ever written a poor review.

I should start by saying that the staff are incredibly courteous, just mostly incompetent. Out of the staff, there was only Vito, who was kind and prompt with check-in and follow up. Everyone else who works there of course has a very difficult job, and while they had a few mistakes here and there, I understand that 端午节 can be a very busy time of year. In those cases, the manager Brian was very kind to try and help resolve them. However, overall the hotel has policies in place that are just unacceptable.

Firstly, after checking in I was told that there would be a music festival happening right next to the hotel. So for 2 days, I had to listen to nonstop EDM through the afternoon and night. It was so bad that my room would literally vibrate with the music until midnight. If I had been warned of this ahead of time, I would have chosen another place. But instead they chose the sneaky route and did not say anything until I had already paid the deposit and was in the room. So shady.

Secondly, Trip.com lists this place as having an “exclusive beach area” but there was nothing of the sort. There IS a path to the beach, but on the way there you will come across a sign that says it is in no way linked to Shangri-La. There are a small amount of beach chairs out there, but again, they say this isn’t their property so I was worried the whole time that I was intruding. In addition, it’s still quite a bit of a walk, so remember to bring all your own things (water, towel, snacks, etc) because getting back to the property will take some time. Also, the area does not permit swimming. That is of course something they cannot control, but if you are hoping to swim in the ocean, this will disappoint you.

Thirdly, breakfast was a mess. I am fully aware that things are different over a holiday, but they couldn’t fit everyone in the restaurant so they had to set up an additional “breakfast area” that had about half the choices—and then shove you away in this little crowded ballroom. I learned the second day that there was a patio option with no wait, and I actually had wanted to sit outside anyway, but no one told me this was available. Even then, I had to ask for my own cutlery (they gave me a children’s set), they did not wipe down the tables, and no one paid any attention to me until I finally showed some frustration.  

Fourth, the place is very much geared towards families. This place has the most “children-friendly” resources out of every Sanya hotel I’ve stayed in, and if you are a parent this is of course great. However, if you are looking for a quiet retreat, I recommend you look somewhere far far away. For my entire stay, I had to deal with screaming kids and their louder-screaming parents (two families got in a screaming match at the pool, and no one did anything except stare). It is definitely something to be aware of when planning your stay.

Honestly, I wanted to spend as little time at the property as possible. It was just too frustrating, too loud, too disorganized, and a waste of my money. This place is taking advantage of the name “Shangri-La” to overcharge you.

Also the crowd checking in and staying here is very good and well mannered. About the kids activity section is very large and elaborate, it's such that kids want to stay indoors and enjoy the acitivites.
Also the safety and security is very goods and we feel protected. And after an all enjoying day, being tired at the resort, a lazy relaxing afternoon or evening at the pools is very pleasant and then comes the all so warm bed. It's just so cozy & relaxing that you just fall asleep after taking a leap on it. Me and my family had a very good time on our vacation. Thanks to the while team of Trip.com & Shangrila Sanya.

Nina - you were amazing, thank you!

There are lots of activities here to do. The swimming pool is just beautiful, and there is a decent amount of shade. The grounds are fantastic, green and well manicured with a great running track around the perimeter. The paths lead you down to the beach. 

The only negative is the mini petting zoo. The guinea pigs looked pretty deshevelled and were low on water, and keeping birds in such a small cage seems unnecessary. 

Other than that, a truly first rate experience.

The bad: the breakfast area is a combat zone, too crowded and much much too loud. A quiet zone for couples is urgently needed!
You are not allowed to swim in the ocean due to the strong currents. The lifeguard won't bother you, though, as long as you stay in the surf area, which we did and appreciated, as in other places aggressive lifeguards, or worse, Bao'an, tell you in brusque tones to get the f**k out of the water :))
All in all: a great stay, would definitely recommend and book again

There is an Asian party at 5pm which my kids had a lot of fun attending (there was an inflatable soap slide which kept them entertained for a while). 
Our room view was nice yet I stayed at another hotel in the area and found the rooms cleaner and much nicer.
The food is nice but very pricey and there is not a lot to do around. There was a good court area 5 minutes away by taxi (20 minutes walk) where we went to find some more (and less expensive) dinner options (Pizza Hut, Korean BBQ, KFC)… 
Overall I would recommend the Shangri-La for the pools and the food. The rooms in other hotels nearby are cleaner and nicer.
Nina the hotel manager was amazing and made sure we had a fantastic stay, had everything we needed, booked a driver for us at the end to take us to our new hotel and even helped us book a day trek at the Yanoda Rainforest park (40 minutes away by car). There you can do different super fun activities (waterfall trekking, zip line, glass bridge, obstacles in the waterfalls area and a breath taking cliff swing). The whole day was costly (I got a package for ¥599 per person and same price for children) yet it was TOTALLY worth it.

Their service is exceptional, Nina helped us in every way possible, going over and above to make sure that we had a wonderful time. I cannot say enough about her caring and kindness.

Room was spacious, clean and very well serviced. Close to duty free shopping and Atlantis. Food ok but restaurant area very crowded. Covid testing excellent and super convenient. 
Also loved the fact you could go swimming in the evening until 10pm (great when it is so hot outside in the day). 

Must improve on queuing. Breakfast queues were 50 plus people long at 8:30am every day. Went past the lobby a few times and similar length queues there for checking in and out.  Staff said that was due to the hotel at nearly full occupancy?!

msg:This trip we stayed at 2 different hotels. Which helped with writing a review as I can easily compare. I liked the Shangrila for its warm open family feel. Felt very casual and friendly. Great for families with little kids. The kids area was enjoyed. Can drop off the little ones and do other things with the big ones. The kids pool was fun. They all enjoyed the slides. The other pools were clean and bright. The beach was clean. Did not notice a life guard at the beach, but also noticed people were careful not to enter too far into the ocean. Housekeeping was great. Did a great job restocking. Especially water for me as usually I run out of water. The breakfast buffet was huge. But the food was not that great. We only liked the dumplings. The rest of the options was so so. The coffee for me was weak. The dinning room was crowded and loud. On our last day we discovered we could have breakfast at the restaurant near the pool. That was much better. Small and quiet. A decent small selection of food. We were all happy. I also liked the hotel had a little convenient store we could purchase snacks at. And the hotel had no problems with us ordering take out. The open family feel also can be a negative as it was always loud in the lobby and often at night we could hear kids running down the hall yelling.

A special thanks to Andre for all his help and the many extra little conveniences he organized. Everything is easy and convenient here and it’s a truly worry-free vacation. The rooms are very spacious, well equipped and have an amazing view. Breakfast was delightful and never disappoints. The whole property is very clean and extremely well maintained. We love the pool landscape and the kids activities and also the restaurants are great. There is always enough space at the pool for everyone and generally the place has a casual and relaxed atmosphere to it. This time it was borderline too-busy, but we are also happy for the hotel to have the business after what probably has been a longer dry-spell. We will for sure be back!

It is a very green hotel area, gardens well kept, amazing view from the Horizon rooms. The room size is nice, good amenities, but the cleaningness could improve. The first room I was, had mold in the bathroom and some dust in the bedroom, and furniture was worn out with stains, rug with holes, not what you expect from a Shangrila room. The room that I got changed to, was mucb better cleaned and kept. The Horizon club amenities were great, food and room service too. Pool is nice, some shadows during the day and the water jet "jacuzzi" were great!
Special mention to Neal from front office, he was fantastic to help with anything and everything, including a breakfast bag ready for my 4am checkout!

msg:Just got back from Shangri-La Sanya and it was a very happy vacation. We had a suit room which came with a bunch of surprises such as complimentary airport pick-up/drop-off, a photo shoot and free lounge use. The use of the lounge made a big difference during our stay because thanks to its beautiful happy hour in the afternoon we didn’t have to pay for any extra food (booze included!) The food is definitely satisfactory at this hotel; lots of options (lots of Western), lots of free stuff, and even the paid stuff is reasonably priced (had lunch once at the hotel restaurant; very delicious) Another nice touch was that when you enter the breakfast hall, a waiter accompanies you to a table and puts a “reserved” sigh on it for you. I hate hunting for tables at hotels so this made breakfast with little kids much easier. The room was very comfortable; had a nice coffee machine, beach bags, hats and sun screens! The kids clubs: ohh these were nice.. There were many options, like a huge soft play, two big play rooms with stuff for almost all age of children, back-to-back activities from origami to cooking class, from pool games to wall climbing. In the evening, kids went to sleep right away😊  and the pool; big big kids pool, with shades, suitable for all ages. To conclude; kids had  a blast. And last but not least; a big thanks to Alan who made sure that we had everything we needed for the perfect holiday. There are only two things that I didn’t love about the hotel (which is probably not a hotel, but a Sanya thing) the pools were shallow (1.10) and there were no chez-longs and umbrellas on the beach. All in all; we will definitely vacationing at this hotel again in the future.

msg:This is a wonderful hotel for family vacation. The quality of service is amazing. We stayed in a Horizon Club room on 7th floor of the ocean wing. The Horizon Club service offers may extras worth the higher price. The Horizon Club Lounge provides an incredible breakfast buffet and is very quiet. One morning we thought we would try the larger buffet in the main building only to find a 15 minute wait just to get seated so we went back to Horizon Club buffet to have another great breakfast. The Horizon Club lounge also has a happy hour from 4:30 to 6:00 pm which is a big buffet of hot and cold food. The lounge is open all the time for refreshments. They picked up our luggage at the front entrance and delivered to our room very quickly. Upon checking out we could process this at the ocean wing Horizon Club service desk so no need to go to big crowded main desk. We had a wonderful service man named Wang who took all our luggage from our room and waited the few minutes while we checked out and then drove us in an electric vehicle to the front area where a Didi car was booked to send us to our next destination. The pool areas in this hotel are great for relaxing fun with family. Each day we floated up to the pool bar to get a fresh coconut. The Shanghai-La empowers every employee to provide friendly service. When you leave this hotel to go to more typical hotel in China you really miss the attention to friendly service the Shangri-La provides.

msg:The housekeeper Jolie upgraded our room type and provided us with considerate housekeeper service. We must stay in the exclusive pavilion. Three meals a day are almost all-inclusive. The service is also great. There are so many activities that we didn't participate in them all after staying for two days. After staying in Shangri-La, we went to St. Regis. The gap is huge. I feel so bored and miss Shangri-La! From the moment I stepped into the hotel lobby, I was deeply attracted by the warm and elegant a**osphere here. The spacious and bright space, exquisite decoration and warm and thoughtful service all make people feel comfortable and happy. The staff is professional and attentive, providing us with considerate check-in services and introducing the hotel's facilities in detail, making us full of expectations for the upcoming journey. The room I stayed in was even more pleasant. The room is spacious and bright, the decoration is luxurious and tasteful, and every detail reveals a high-quality life experience. The bed is soft and comfortable, allowing me to have a sweet dream every night. The room is fully equipped, from high-speed Internet to comfortable sofas, to considerate service guides, which makes me feel very considerate. In terms of catering, Sanya Shangri-La Hotel also shows its excellent quality. The hotel's restaurant offers a variety of food options, whether it is Chinese or Western cuisine, it is mouth-watering. The ingredients are fresh and the cooking skills are superb, and every dish is memorable. The environment of the restaurant is also very elegant, suitable for enjoying food and spending a good time with family or friends. In addition, the hotel also provides a wealth of entertainment and leisure facilities, so that we can fully relax during our vacation. The swimming pool is crystal clear and the water quality is excellent. We swim and play there, enjoying the sun and sea breeze. The gym is fully equipped to meet the needs of tourists to keep fit during their trip. Throughout the stay, the service team of Shangri-La Hotel has always maintained a warm and thoughtful service attitude, making us feel the warmth of home. Their professionalism and meticulous service make us feel at ease and comfortable during our trip. Sanya Shangri-La Hotel is a hotel with excellent quality and thoughtful service. Whether it is the elegant environment, comfortable accommodation, delicious dining or rich entertainment facilities, it makes people feel very satisfied. If you are planning to go to Sanya for vacation, I strongly recommend you to choose this hotel. I believe you will leave good memories here like me.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel, Sanya, is my first time staying here. I was pleasantly surprised and surprised. I was very satisfied. Here are my real feelings:
1. The housekeeper contacted us two days in advance. Our housekeeper is called Luke. He took the initiative to help us arrange travel photography, sofa beds and other matters in advance. I often asked him about some itineraries. He was still replying at 11 o'clock in the evening. We arrived at night without any waiting. The housekeeper has a strong sense of responsibility.
2. It rained heavily when we went to Fenjiezhou Island. The housekeeper prepared two large pots of ginger tea for us in advance. It was really warm after the wet chicken was anxious for an afternoon. We were trapped in Fenjiezhou for the whole afternoon and had no place to sit. We thought it would be nice to stay in the hotel. The housekeeper also helped us plan various ways to come back. Haha, I feel that this time is already providing emotional value.
3. The service attitude is very good, especially the restaurant has a shaved ** and tall staff. Seeing that we have many children and the set meal is not enough, he responded flexibly and took the initiative to send us more meals and drinks. I was embarrassed and he kept saying it was okay.
4. Even the cleaning lady saw that we didn’t eat the minibus in the refrigerator, and said that we could eat it and she would make up for it. Seeing that we have a baby, they also sent a brand new kettle, a large piece of soap and a lot of purified water. I have stayed in so many hotels and I really feel at home.
Nearby attractions are as follows: Water World, Wuzhizhou Island, Houhai Village, and the City That Never Sleeps.
Nearby food: Linwang Night Market, Houhai Night Market, 68 Food City, Duty Free Shop Phase II, Longhai Style Town, the distance is not very far, it is very convenient to drive by yourself, and it is very close to the duty-free shop.
About the room:
It has a heavy feeling. Although the decoration is not so fashionable, it is very comfortable and clean. It is of quality, and all the king-size bed rooms can accommodate 1.5-meter sofa beds. We stayed in three adults and two children! The combination of a king-size bed + a 1.5-meter sofa bed has exceeded the configuration of the parent-child room, and the sofa bed is much more comfortable than the folding spring bed that we add in other hotels. This is also the reason why I chose this place after comparing many surrounding hotels.
About breakfast:
Breakfast is based on age of 12 years and above. My 9-year-old son who is over 1.2 meters tall is considered a children's meal. Many hotels have two adults and two children, and the younger one cannot be more than 1.2 or 6 years old. Shangri-La is still very practical.
There are not too many breakfast varieties, and there is also a children's area, which is so cute. I went to the children's area to get small dumplings to eat haha.
About entertainment projects:
Whether to play for two days or not, everyone who traveled to take photos was very happy because it was very professional and the environment was very beautiful. My parents and mother-in-law were very happy. Not to mention the children. In addition, the beach in Haitang Bay is very flat, which is very suitable for walking, taking pictures and digging sand.

This place really made our family of three have a lot of fun! From the day before arriving at the hotel, the housekeeper Dora contacted me and asked me about various room requirements, children's toiletries, children's toilet mats, etc. She also gave me an activity list for booking activities. When we arrived at the hotel, she took us to the room, which was really thoughtful! The hotel service reflects various details in place. The breakfast is very rich, a combination of Chinese and Western, with freshly ground coffee, bread and cake, Hainan noodles, etc., and there is also a children's meal pick-up area~ In terms of play, there are small trains, swimming pools, various activities, and the beach is close, with fine sand and clean water. In short, both adults and children are satisfied with the fun. The only regret is that there are not enough swimming circles for children, so if you can't catch up, you won't get one~ But the flaws do not outweigh the merits, it's pretty good~

The hardware, software facilities and conditions of Shangri-La Hotel are first-class. I actually booked Sheraton last year, but the service of Sheraton was too poor, so I decisively chose Shangri-La Hotel where I stayed during the National Day. It's great and worth the money!

The hotel facilities are the Southeast Asian style I like. The large lawn and lush plants, as well as rows of coconut trees, are very comfortable. I took a walk in the hotel in the morning and evening, blowing the sea breeze, and walked a few steps to the beach. The beach is fine and soft, which is very suitable for children to dig sand and play.
The hotel service is also very satisfactory. The waiter delivered our luggage to the room as soon as possible, and sent drinks and fruits. The room is spacious and clean, and it feels great to face the sea on the balcony.
The parent-child activities in the hotel are also quite rich. The children are very happy every day. They actively participate in activities to collect stamps to exchange gifts. At night, they play in the children's water park and don't want to go back to the room.
We stayed in the Deluxe Pavilion, so the meals were very rich. Breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour basically met the three meals a day. Tea, coffee and drinks can be drunk all day. When the children are hungry, they go to replenish energy and then continue to play.
Finally, it is important to especially thank the lifeguard He Wosheng for his patient guidance and teaching me to swim. This is the biggest gain of the Sanya trip.

msg:This is my Nth time to Haitang Bay. I was lucky to stay at Shangri-La and met the housekeeper MAKA. Before coming, I was worried that Shangri-La Hotel had been here for a long time and would not be satisfactory. Shangri-La's service is the best among all the hotels in Haitang Bay I have stayed in. MAKA communicated with the arrival time one day in advance, arranged to upgrade the room, prepared Children's Day gifts for the children, and also gave admission to the playground. He updated all the hotel's facilities and activities in detail. He answered all questions. The little friend felt uncomfortable in the middle of the night, and he was busy until the early morning. Fortunately, I booked 4 days this time and did not move to other places. I will recommend this place to my friends around me.

msg:The Deluxe Room with Sea View King Bed is very comfortable, and there is a sofa bed which is suitable for two adults and two children or three adults and two children. The room is very convenient to the children's swimming and playing areas. The beach is right next to it. We play in the water, sand and swimming every morning and evening, and there is a bubble party. It is very happy. It is too sunny at noon. The hotel also arranges various children's courses, which are not delayed. It is just that I have to make an appoin**ent one day in advance every time, and some projects have not been experienced in time. It just happens that the courses are not repeated every day, which is a bit regrettable.
The hotel has a rich buffet in the morning and evening, with both Chinese and Western hot and cold dishes. In particular, there is a children's dining area in the lobby for breakfast, which is particularly considerate and suitable for children who stay in the hotel to play in the water every day. In the evening, the Deluxe Room has a special buffet to meet the energy replenishment of the day.
Our butler MAKA, Mr. Li Zizheng, is warm and thoughtful. The juice and fresh mango that children like to drink will be delivered in time. If there are problems with the play, they can also provide free upgrade services.

msg:The room is nice. Thanks to the butler Ben for picking a room close to the sea and swimming pool. The butler added WeChat in advance. He greeted us as soon as we arrived at the lobby, accompanied us throughout the whole process, and sent us to the room. We stayed here for four nights. The butler can be said to be on call and thoughtful service. Thank him very much. There was a small episode in the middle of the trip and it was quickly resolved. I like the response speed of the five-star hotel. Because the child is relatively small, he needs small items of this and that. Butler Ben also sent it over immediately, which is very considerate. There are many varieties of breakfast, and a 22-month-old baby can eat well. The hotel has a shuttle bus from Building 1 to Building 3. The VIP Pavilion has fewer varieties of breakfast, and I go to Building 3 for dinner every day. The VIP Pavilion dinner can be full, but it can't be said to be good. I take my children to participate in various activities in the hotel every day, and the time is full. The children are very happy and the adults are also tired. I have recommended it to my friends. Overall, butler Ben gave me extra points for Shangri-La. Thanks to the butler's service.

msg:We stayed in Shangri-La Deluxe Seaview King Room on 5.4 for two nights. We were given a seaview room on the best floor, the 7th floor. We booked the room on Ctrip. We heard that there was a butler service. I waited and waited until 9 o'clock the night before yesterday. Why didn't the butler add me? So I called the hotel to tell my doubts, and soon a butler added me. His name was honey. He asked me about my check-in time and needs, sent me a lot of precautions and various activities in the park, and helped me arrange travel photography. The key is to praise this butler honey for full service💯. Not only did he answer every question, but he also took the initiative to care about our stay experience. I casually said that the weather was too hot today, and he immediately sent us a freshly made Qingbuliang to relieve the heat. I was shocked when three bowls were delivered to the room. This is too good. There is also a welcome fruit every day. The mango is big and sweet, and I can't stop eating it.

I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 in the afternoon. I handed my luggage to the doorman and took the shuttle bus directly to the Deluxe Pavilion to check in without queuing in the lobby. After getting the room card, the luggage was put in the room in a while.

After the rain, we went out for a walk. The hotel is so big and beautiful, the greening is very good, and the activities are also very colorful. I feel that staying for two nights is not enough. My son likes off-road karts the most. He can play twice a day and drive 6 laps. Then it’s a swimming pool. There are two slides in the children’s water area, easy mode and hard mode. We played in the easy area for two days. Later, we went to the main swimming pool to swim. The water depth of 1.1 meters is very friendly to children. The towels next to the swimming pool are available at any time, all hot, very convenient.

We also went to the game room in the hotel twice, spending 150 yuan and buying 80 coins. My son played the somatosensory Ultraman fighting monsters 6 times and couldn’t stop at all.

Finally, let’s talk about the food in the luxury pavilion. There is really nothing delicious about the afternoon tea. The daily happy hour is a simple dinner. We don’t have high requirements for what to eat. It’s completely fine to treat it as dinner. I even think it’s very delicious [snickering R] There was also oden last night, and the spicy meatballs were so delicious! Although there are not many varieties, there are staple food, hot dishes, meat, vegetables, desserts, soup, fruit and drinks. What else do you need a bicycle for? The only bad thing is that it ends too early. It closes at 6:30. If you go late, you can't eat it. Breakfast is also eaten here. It is much richer than dinner, and the quality is very good. You can believe that there is steak to eat early in the morning. There are more than a dozen kinds of freshly squeezed juices. Although the place is not big, there are few people, it is not crowded at all, and you don't have to fight for things. The breakfast experience is really great.

In short, Shangri-La Luxury Pavilion must be one of my must-choices next time I come to Sanya!

The staff in blue clothes are very enthusiastic, and the staff in white clothes are relatively indifferent. It is very suitable for children to play. The beach activities at night are also good, and the go-karts are fun👍🏻

I had the honor of having an unforgettable journey at Shangri-La Hotel, Sanya. This experience gave me a deeper understanding and love for the Shangri-La brand. The hotel is strategically located in Haitang Bay, with a beautiful sea view. Standing in front of the window, you can overlook the rippling sea. Every morning and evening, you can also enjoy the charming sunrise and sunset, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. The check-in experience is even better. From the moment I entered the lobby, I was impressed by the warm service of the hotel staff. They were smiling, polite and thoughtful, and provided us with thoughtful check-in instructions and introductions. The rooms are spacious and bright, and the layout is both comfortable and luxurious. Every detail shows high-quality standards. The bed is soft and comfortable, allowing people to sleep well all night. In terms of dining, the restaurant of Shangri-La Hotel is also commendable.

Booked a Deluxe Sea View Room. You can't expect too much from the sea view. After all, the floor is there. The room is indeed relatively old, especially the bathroom, but it is still very comfortable to live in, and the bed is very solid! 

The small train can go to the viewing platform, and the baby likes it very much! There are piglets and alpacas in the cute pet park, which the baby likes to see, but it's a little hot! There is no problem with eating fullness at the Deluxe Happy Hour, and there are indeed not many varieties of afternoon tea! There are fewer people at the Deluxe Breakfast, and the variety is not much but enough to eat. The baby especially likes omlet! Even if you don't go to Xiangzhen Garden for a buffet dinner, it's also good to go in to listen to the live concert and play karts, but you must pay attention to mosquito prevention! 

The service is very good, the butler Hedy is very enthusiastic, and the replies are also very timely!

For people like us who are so lazy, I feel that we need to stay for at least four nights! My daughter was reluctant to leave the little rabbit in the cute pet park and insisted that I buy one to take home😂

msg:During the May Day trip to Sanya, I chose to stay at Shangri-La Hotel for the first two nights. Because the flight was delayed that day, it was already past 11pm when I arrived at the hotel. The front desk lady who checked in helped me contact the housekeeper MAKA to add WeChat, and the check-in was very fast. But we booked a view room, which was relatively small. At that time, I communicated with the housekeeper MAKA on WeChat and felt that the room was not very satisfactory. Although it was very late, MAKA responded very quickly and helped us upgrade the room for free. The speed of solving the problem was very fast, and the service attitude was very good. The biggest feeling of staying at Shangri-La Hotel for two days was that every service staff I met in the hotel greeted me with a smile, and any problems were handled very quickly! I will choose Shangri-La Hotel again next time!

msg:In a city where the hotel industry is very competitive, Shangri-La has undoubtedly grasped the winning code! How should I put it? This is my first time staying at Shangri-La. Among the countless hotels in Haitang Bay, price, brand and gimmicks are undoubtedly the obvious intuitive feelings, but Shangri-La has won in the invisible butler-style service that cannot be seen before booking! I believe that when you come to Shangri-La, you hope that your children can have fun and you can live without worries. Then you have made the right choice! The person who contacted me was the lobby manager Bruce Liu. It is no exaggeration to say that it was the first time I met him, but he was like an old friend. His attentiveness was not exaggerated or artificial, but it made you feel just right! (The following is a real experience)
1. He called me one day in advance and asked about my schedule. He added me on WeChat. There were many people checking in at the lobby at 1 o'clock, but he recognized me from a distance and told me that my room had been cleaned and I could check in directly. I believe many friends have had the experience of waiting for the room to come out after checking in. This was my first experience (I am not a nb member) and he took me to the room
2. As usual, he sent me any hotel experience and time, but the bonus was that he would remind me again in each time period, such as going to play this, going to eat, etc.
3. He took the initiative to ask about my flight schedule and offered to postpone my flight time
4. We met again in the lobby after leaving and said goodbye to each other like old friends
Overall, Shangri-La's hardware and facilities are not bad, which is also a big reason why I chose Shangri-La, but the real butler-style service was my surprise and the most bonus reason for me to come back
Keep it up! Bruce

There is no waiter to make coffee. There was no introduction of any entertainment information when checking in, nor was there any information about discounts for duty-free shops that can be booked in advance. I had to take my luggage into the room by myself, and the facial recognition was not passed once because it was not the same person. I had to queue for at least half an hour for breakfast, and there was no sashimi for dinner. There were many children's entertainment projects that required payment, and the adventure park ticket cost 150 yuan. The mineral water provided was ice dew, and there were no cotton slippers. The bathroom smelled musty, and the decoration was very old. The only good thing was that there were more swimming pools, and there were two water slides that children liked. Children had their own food pick-up area, and they could also see the Atlantis fireworks show.

This time I originally booked a one-night sea view and two-night deluxe pavilion, but later I was delayed until very late to check in. I troubled the housekeeper Hedy to help upgrade the room to a 3-night deluxe pavilion. She also responded quickly and professionally to any questions. I am very satisfied!

The travel photo is not given according to the room, but according to the family. I booked two rooms and can only enjoy one travel photo and there are only five free photos. The extra photos are charged at 60 each. There are also some hidden costs for other activities.
We stayed for three nights, and the drinks in the refrigerator are still only free for the first time. I am particularly curious, if I book a room for three days, how will you deal with it.
Of course, it is very close to Atlantis, which is convenient for taking children to play.

The disposable items for the other child were also replenished very quickly. The sea view was very nice and positive, and the Deluxe Room was the closest to the beach. It was just across the lawn downstairs. It was about 200 meters away.
The housekeeper Dora was very considerate. She would respond immediately to any needs or questions she wanted to ask. For example, she would send iodine and band-aids to the children if they had rubbed their feet. The convenience of the Deluxe Room was that there were drinks, coffee and milk available all day, and a glass of milk could be given to the children every night.
The hotel had a lot of activities. The children played archery, ropes and go-karts at night, and could ride a small train every day. The handicraft activities were a bit perfunctory. Making candles was just about choosing a model. There were fire shows and iron flower shows every night, as well as passing levels to collect stamps and exchange gifts.
The hotel's swimming pool and two-color rotating slide can be played with children, which is more friendly. The little ones can also be held by adults to slide.
If one day is not enough to play here, you can stay for a few more days. I stayed for three consecutive nights and was lucky enough to encounter the 6th anniversary celebration of Atlantis next door, just below Building 1, with drones and fireworks shows.

After all, the floor here is not high, and the sea view is not the main feature. During the stay, the butler service and parent-child activities related services were very good. The butler Luke basically responded and handled it in seconds 24 hours a day, which was very good. The room supplies were also updated in a timely manner, and he helped me fold all the messy clothes when cleaning. .
It is worth mentioning that there are children's activities from morning to night, and there is a children's swimming pool. My son likes it very much. To be honest, I feel that the overall experience is better than the previous Club med.

When we wanted to make an appoin**ent for a specific time, we found that the king room was fully booked. We called to ask if the twin rooms could be put together and add fences, so we booked a twin room.
There were really a lot of people at the hotel. We had to queue for a while to check in. When it was our turn, we were told that we could change to a theme king room. We agreed thinking that we could check in without waiting. As a result, we were surprised to find that it was a jungle theme room with two beds, one big and one small. There was a small tent on the small bed, as well as a coconut tree and a little monkey. The baby liked it very much and said that he wanted to live in a room with a small tent and a monkey. The room was on the first floor. The balcony door opened to a small courtyard. There was a small slide outside. The bathroom was also very large. It was considerately equipped with a small stool for the baby to wash his hands. It was also equipped with a small towel for the baby to wash his hands. There was a little thing on the first night of the stay, but the hotel staff lemon contacted and handled it in time. The breakfast and happy hour in the evening provided by the Horizon Club are enough for adults. We had breakfast in the Horizon Club on the first day and in the lobby restaurant on the second day. The breakfast was richer. The baby likes to go to the beach to dig sand. It takes a short walk across the lawn to the beach. There is also a set of sand digging tools in the room. The swimming pool has a small pool suitable for babies. The slides are also large and small and suitable for all ages. We also participated in the bubble party, and the baby had a lot of fun. The hotel also has a small train. Just queue up and sit on the time. The baby also likes it. When we checked out on the last day, the flight was delayed. We contacted lemon to help us book a bus to the airport. The check-out time was also extended. A small gift was given to the baby. There are many activities suitable for children. The arrangement feels good and the baby also likes it.

Everything prepared for children here is so comprehensive and thoughtful. As a middle-aged and elderly couple, we all lament that our children have grown up. There really was no such good vacation choice 20 years ago! Thank you dora for taking care of you for the past two days! Stay, you keep improving and stay ahead!

Back to the hotel. March was sandwiched between two festivals and May 1st. I thought there would be fewer people, but I miscalculated. The occupancy rate was quite high. There were queues for breakfast and the executive lounge. In terms of children's facilities, there were a lot of people queuing for the go-karts at night, as well as the trains. You need to queue in advance. But the children's activities we booked were okay and easier to book. There were few people on the ropeway shooting side, which was suitable for a stroll after breakfast. There were many people in the swimming pool, especially the small pool with the slide. There were more children, but they could play and there was no queue for the slide. There were very few people on the indoor big slide. If you want to be quiet and not sunbathe, you can go there.

The hotel is indeed criticized by people. It is a few years old. There is no sense of design on the exterior of the entire building, and the floor in the room has long lost its luster. However, the sofa bed in the room is still a plus. We stayed with three adults and one child, saving a huge amount of money. There is a shuttle bus between the lobby and the Luxury Pavilion, which is very convenient.

The hotel is positioned for family. There are enough things for children to play here, and they are also very happy. It is a good place for children to take their children out. Booking the Luxury Pavilion can cover all three meals, making eating worry-free and troublesome.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel is a very cost-effective family hotel. This trip to Sanya brought us many unexpected surprises.
There are a lot of parent-child courses, most of which are free, which is enough for children to have fun for three days. We stayed for two days, but we didn’t experience many of them, which was a bit regretful. I highly recommend the little princess dress-up. The painting done by the young lady is super beautiful. With the princess dress and crown, she really looks like a beautiful little princess. The garden party in the evening was even more rich in content, with various activities, dancing by the ladies, and wonderful blacksmithing performances. It was no less than what we saw in Chongli.
The breakfast is really the best and most unique I have ever had in a hotel. It is more than one level higher than the breakfast at many big-name hotels such as Four Seasons and Marriott. The uncles who make shortbread are very quick and Very welcoming, with a lot of specialties cooked to order, the chefs are very skilled, and there is almost no need to queue.
Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to the butler Lim for his service. He was very considerate. He added WeChat a day in advance and helped us make appoin**ents for various activities we wanted to do. During our stay, we responded to various questions in a timely manner. We will choose this hotel next time.

To put it bluntly, it was much more fun than the hotel next door. There is a large glass tank and water park next door. The overall environment is not as good as here. This is the Resort!! The room is also super big and has a sofa bed. It’s 1.2 meters long, and the queen bed is 2 meters long. It can accommodate two or three children! ! The butler George's service was very considerate. He also specially prepared a birthday cake for my family's birthday. Thank you very much! Will come again next time!

msg:A very surprising stop during the trip. Because we were with our children, we contacted Ctrip in advance to ask the housekeeper to send diapers. I have to say that Ctrip's customer service is super awesome. It's just that I was too tired to take care of the baby, so I delayed the review until now.

Service: The housekeeper Ben is very good and can understand the mood of taking care of a baby. The stroller I requested in advance was also there, and the stroller also had a mosquito net. He promptly helped to confirm in advance whether the stroller could lie flat. There was also a footstool. I arranged a large room at the end of the fourth floor, which I liked very much. I could see the children's water park downstairs.
I told Ben in advance that I would come here, and I checked in when I came. I saw so many people queuing in the lobby, and I thought it was really good.

Environment: Overall, I can feel that Shangri-La is well maintained. I woke up at five o'clock in the morning and saw many employees busy. The baby also likes the activities, and there are no mosquitoes. It is the happiest stop for the baby.

The only downside is:
1 The beach is still a little damp, and there is still a bit of musty smell when I wake up in the middle of the night
2 We have two adults and two children, so we asked for a sofa bed to make the bed. The sofa bed is a bit hard. If the bed-making service can add a layer of memory foam, it will be much better.
3 The executive lounge of the Deluxe Club is not friendly to strollers. There are only stairs. If you want barrier-free travel, you can only go around from the outside
4 The welcome fruit arrived late, there is no toilet seat for children, and the air conditioning is still a little insufficient. I feel hot

Overall, Shangri-La is the best stop of this trip. The children also had a lot of fun. I will choose Shangri-La next time

Special mention goes to Phoebe at the front desk who impressed us with her enthusiasm and professionalism. She not only checked us in quickly, but also introduced the hotel's facilities and activities in detail, giving us a deeper understanding of everything here.
 
The rooms are spacious and bright, elegantly and comfortably furnished, and every detail demonstrates the quality of Shangri-La. Standing in front of the window, you can also enjoy the beautiful sea view, which makes people feel happy.
 
The hotel's catering is also amazing. Whether it is a sumptuous buffet or exquisite a la carte dishes, our taste buds are greatly satisfied.
 
In addition, the hotel also has complete leisure facilities. The children have a lot of fun in the children's playground, while we adults can enjoy leisurely time by the swimming pool. Thank you Shangri-La Hotel Sanya, especially Phoebe, for making our vacation such a wonderful experience. We will definitely come back next time!

During our stay at the hotel, she was able to respond immediately to all our accommodation, dining, entertainment and other needs. And arrangements are made to truly implement the responsibilities of a personal butler in every place. What I love most about staying at Shangri-La is the morning buffet. It has a large area, many varieties, abundant hot food, high level of cooking, fast replenishment, and good service. Even if the baby doesn't leave the hotel, the pet area, play area, and beach and water play area are all enough to keep him entertained for several days. Five-star hotels need this kind of home away from home experience. I will come again next time.

I communicated before check-in that I need a crib surround. As soon as I entered the door, I saw that it had been installed. The room is Chinese and Western. Combined with the old money style, the scenery outside the window is unobstructed, the coconut trees are fragrant during the day, and the lights are bright at night. The facilities are all available, and the breakfast buffet fully considers parent-child families. There is a special area for baby food, and there are waiters who will guide you to your seat when you enter the door. They are enthusiastic and attentive. For dinner, we tasted many hand-made meals by the chef at the Southeast Asian Style Xi Restaurant. The delicious stone pot eggs and tofu are still fresh in our memory. During the stay, the baby played in the hotel's amusement park, cute pet paradise, outdoor trampoline, and beach. There is also a small train that every baby can't refuse. Shangri-La is worthy of being a leader among five-star parent-child hotels.

The facilities for family and children were complete, the service attitude was first-class, the environment was as superior as ever, and the holiday a**osphere was full. The four days flew by in the blink of an eye. Everyone unanimously decided to stay here again next time they come to Sanya. Shangri-La.
Accommodation: Highly recommend the Horizon Club, with a large bed + a 1.5m sofa bed. It feels like a family of 3-4. Even if the children are older, there is no pressure. You can directly see the sea from the balcony, and the scenery is first-class. We stayed in the Horizon Club Ocean View Room this time. The Horizon Club is in Building 1. The Happy Hour in the Horizon Club VIP Lounge is particularly recommended, including afternoon tea from 14:00-15:30 and happy hour from 16:30-18:00. You can enjoy exquisite snacks, various dishes and drinks for free, basically everything from vegetable salads, cheese, dessert cakes, fruits, juices, drinks, refreshments and other snacks; there are also staple foods such as porridge, rice, noodles, etc., 4 -6 hot dishes including meat and vegetables, 2-3 fried items, French fries, lotus root, shrimp cakes, etc.; there will also be 4-5 kinds of wine. The time is also more suitable. I feel that staying at the Horizon Club during this happy hour can completely replace dinner.
Play: Children's swimming pool + large constant-temperature swimming pool. The children's pool has many slides and bubble baths in the afternoon. The constant-temperature swimming pool is super large and not crowded. The exclusive beach is within walking distance, there are few people, and it is a good experience to play. In addition, there are various activities such as go-karts, cute pet parks, bonfire parties, indoor playgrounds, game arcades, small trains, etc. There are so many activities. I haven’t tried a few in my two visits, and I haven’t tried various trusteeships and courses yet. Yes, but the content is really rich
Service: Shangri-La is worthy of being a long-established hotel. The service has always been excellent. This time, I would like to express my special thanks to the account manager: Phoebe. She helped us pay attention to the itinerary before check-in, provided various assistance with check-in, and provided personal service.

The room is very far from the lobby and needs to be picked up by the hotel's electric car. Walking past the children's swimming pool, there was a smell of urine. The difference between switching from Yalong Bay Marriott to Shangri-La is really huge. When I came to Haitang Bay before, I always stayed at the Westin, which is totally incomparable! I will never choose this Shangri-La again.

The most outrageous thing is the seafood buffet in the garden at night. I wanted to take the elderly and children to experience the open-air seafood buffet on the beach, but I was told that a company had reserved the venue for team building and could not go to the open-air venue. Forget it, I went indoors. It turned out that the seafood in the so-called seafood buffet was some frozen shrimp. 3 shellfish and octopus and cuttlefish. Just these so-called seafood. 3 adults spent 1104 and had nothing to eat. It is completely different from the menu content shown on Dianping. There is nothing to eat for three adults. The categories are very single. These dishes are not even as rich and exquisite as some of our local buffet dishes that are over 100 years old. I am very surprised! This star-rated hotel uses these quality meals to fool guests. In addition, there is an unpleasant aromatic smell in the hotel, especially in the elevator.
After staying for 2 days, the overall experience was very poor.

The a**osphere on the beach includes interpretation shows, singing and dancing, and fire shows. The elderly watched it with gusto. The beach movie was shown in "Chang'an Thirty Thousand Miles", and the a**osphere of watching it again is completely different from the movie theater. The cute pet garden is very clean. It is worth choosing to stay here next time you come to Sanya.

msg:I strongly recommend this low-key and convenient old Shangri-La Hotel. This is the only Shangri-La Hotel in Sanya. When I first chose Xiangjia, it was so that my children could eat well. After all, I had the impression that the food at Shangri-La Hotel was very good among five-star hotels. Customer service George's service is also very good. We added WeChat one day in advance because we checked in too late and I am sensitive to noise. The next day, with George's coordination and the hotel's support, although the room was full, we still changed it to another room. quiet room. The decoration of the room is in Southeast Asian style and matches the environment of Sanya very well. It looks casual and peaceful. Breakfast is the time when there are the most children. Although there are many people, the hotel reception is very orderly. At other times, because the hotel covers a large area, it is not noisy. The beach is also beautiful and there are not many people, so it is suitable to relax and relax. The garden party in the evening is more a**ospheric, and there is also an outdoor movie. There are no mosquitoes in this season, and the weather is comfortable. It is a very pleasant holiday. It is very close to duty-free shops and Atlantis. We went to both places twice. Later, our children had a fever and they helped coordinate a late check-out. Traffic jams are easy in peak seasons. Customer service George also specially reminded the departure time, which was very That's very thoughtful, thank you! I hope to encounter such customer service and service next time I stay!

We originally only wanted to stay for one night, but we stayed for three nights in a row. For our convenience, they upgraded the room type for the next night. , very considerate~ We have stayed in Shangri-La in many cities over the years, and every time we feel familiar and warm like home. The room service is very good, but the door card cannot be opened, and the handsome waiter will help me to renew the card at the front desk, which is great! Someone will help transport your luggage when you arrive and when you leave, which saves a lot of effort. Customer service manager Yu also answered all questions, thank you very much! Looking forward to coming to Sanya Shangri-La next time!

Check-in at the hotel was very fast, and it was a butler-style service. Vera’s WeChat account was added, so any questions could be answered directly. It is very convenient to ask and will proactively remind and ask.
The breakfast is very rich, and there is a special place for children to get their meals.
The swimming pool and large lawn are very fun, but it's a pity that my son had a cold and didn't go into the water.
The scenery is beautiful, and the sea can be seen from the room in the distance.
The only flaw is that the soundproofing of the door is average. If children pass by outside the door, they will hear it.
Overall it's great, I'll come again if I have the chance.

msg:Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay at Shangri-La.

The day before leaving, the butler Ben added WeChat and sent the activity schedule. I applied for extra bed rails and step stools, which were arranged when I checked in. There were greetings every day and a baby gift was given when leaving the store. And it was my husband's birthday and I gave him a birthday cake.

I stayed in the Haitang Suite. You can see part of the sea from the fifth floor, and the scenery is beautiful. An extra bed can be added to the living room. The living room and bedroom each have a bathroom. It's relatively clean. I'm used to wiping the areas within reach with alcohol wipes, and I didn't find any particularly dirty corners. Rooms are cleaned morning and evening. Four straw hats, a plate of dessert cakes, and a plate of fruit were given as a gift upon check-in. The small refrigerator in the Haitang set is provided free of charge.

I eat more breakfast in the lobby building, which is very rich, but I personally think the taste is average. Breakfast in the Horizon Club is also provided, but the variety there is less. The set meal also comes with happy hour, which can be understood as a relatively simple dinner, enough to feed the baby.

Summarize some things that children over two years old can play. The internal environment of the hotel is really good. There are two large lawns where you can ride horses, run wildly, and play bubble games in the afternoon. There are three large swimming pools, two of which are heated. I saw that there were still people playing there after 8 o'clock in the evening. Although it is the peak season, except for the large number of people eating breakfast, the flow of people in the swimming pool is still okay. The little train kid in the hotel also likes to ride on it, so he can sit on it without any restrictions. There is also a big bubble trampoline, which the children like very much. In the cute pet paradise, you can simply feed small animals. You can drive two go-karts in the evening garden party package.

I had a lot of fun and it was a basically bug-free trip.

msg:🙈🙈I feel ashamed to say that over the years I have been to Mauritius and Atlantis in Dubai to see the Big Green Sea, but I have never set foot in Hainan Province, and I feel like I have been to such beautiful places. . However, this time, at the request of my child, it was my first time to accompany her to Hainan. This was my first time staying in Sanya, so I chose Shangri-La. Mainly because my wife and children had been here several times before and wanted to experience the difference of Shangri-La. First of all, I want to recommend it to everyone, because it is unexpected. . The weather in Hainan has been unpredictable in the past 7 days, which gave me a cold and a fever. Fortunately, I brought anti-fever medicine. Shangri-La has a heated swimming pool, which some other hotels do not. . Let’s not belittle others here.

❤❤ What I must mention is Shangri-La’s butler service. The beauty who received us is called Wan Yuan (I don’t know if it’s her stage name [laughing]). The service is great and very considerate. Not to mention the daily attentive service, just Just talking about my discomfort, she helped me prepare ginger tea and I was very touched. I also asked her if I could choose her service next time I come back🤭🤭

🏊♀️🏊♀️🏊♀️The hotel's children's paddling pool is okay, suitable for children under 10 years old. There is a dedicated area for adults to swim. Then the hotel has a variety of activities for children to check in, drive electric go-karts, do crafts, etc., but they need to be reserved in advance. It is best to call the hotel to make an appoin**ent before checking in, or talk to the housekeeper. For helicopters, the price ranges from 400 to 1,000 per person, mainly depending on the kilometers.

The shopping mall has a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. It goes from the hotel on the hour and picks you up from the duty-free shop at half time. There are coasters and large sedans.

❤❤All in all, my first experience in the store was very good, five-star recommendation. Of course, the first thing is the butler service; secondly, although it is a long-established hotel, the living facilities and entertainment facilities are OK. Finally, the location is moderate, not far from the duty-free shop and 68th Street. In the middle area, it is convenient for eating and shopping, and you can also take a taxi. Just 10 yuan.

The hotel is strategically located in the center of Haitang Bay. Next to it are gourmet shopping and entertainment, Haitang 68 Global Food Street, and Jiachuanyueliuxiang, which I can’t forget. Atlantis Sanya Water World is within walking distance and is delivered to the Duty Free City Hotel. The hotel is very beautiful. It covers a large area and has a huge green space. The lawns and woods make people forget to leave. Standing in the woods facing the sea is a scene of spring flowers. Walking on the beach of the hotel is simply not too dramatic. The hotel's service is professional, warm and high-end. It arrived before I even arrived at the hotel. I received a call from the housekeeper manager Phoebe one day in advance. She added her WeChat message and asked me when I would arrive and what I needed. She also upgraded me. After checking the room type, he told me that I could check in at any time, guided me to the hotel, checked in, and any other needs during my stay in the hotel, so that I could spend every day of my stay in the hotel carefree and happily. The breakfast is very rich, which I must praise. It is so attentive that there is a children's meal specially prepared for children. This is the first time I have seen it, and I was surprised. What also surprised me was that the hotel has its own indoor parking garage, which is rare among hotels on Hainan Island. The hotel rooms are large, clean and beautiful, with complete facilities and easy to use. You can feel the hotel's care in every part of the hotel. There is a paradise for entertainment under my balcony. From now on, when I go to Hainan, I will go to Haitang Bay Shangri-La Hotel for vacation.

There will be performances and go-karts in the garden. It was a very enjoyable time. The only regret was that the "Princess Diaries" was fully booked and the children didn't get to play it. Maybe it’s because there are more children during the peak season, and I hope the hotel can increase the number of places during the peak season. Overall, everything is very good. I will choose to stay there next time.

Every day I sit in the hotel that my daughter likes to visit the hotel for a week. There are scenery everywhere. The large lawn opposite the room is very beautiful. It is definitely a good place for taking pictures. The hotel breakfast is very abundant and has a lot of meals. There is always a feeling of endless shopping. There is a special child area for breakfast. It is very thoughtful and meticulous. The hotel has a variety of children's entertainment facilities. There are many choices for indoor and outdoor, and the daughter did not play enough. The hotel is very close to the hotel next time. Go out from the room for 3 minutes. The hotel is leased with a housing card, which is particularly good
The buffet of the family parties of the Xiangyu Park Club is also good (the housekeeper Lina helps us with a good place) sitting in the beach to eat food, listening to beautiful singing, watching the fire show performance, our family is happy.
In the end, I would like to thank our housekeeper LINA beauty. Although there are some episodes in it, because of your help, our family travel can be perfectly described. Before staying, LINA contacted me and asked me some needs. I asked if I could take care of it earlier, children's carts, guardrails, toilet pads in children, etc. I should help solve them. On the first night of staying in, the children upstairs were noisy late at night, and the daughter who was hurt could not sleep. LINA contacted the manager on duty in time to help coordinate the day, and provided us with several new room options the next day. In the case of going out, help us get our luggage to a new room. Thanks to Linelina for dealing with the ability and efficiency of things, I will take my daughter to Shangri -La, Haitang Bay next time, a great parent -child hotel, fun Delicious, Jingmei Beauty!

The only small suggestion is that I hope the hair dryer in the room can be improved. It is not very convenient to use when fixed in a drawer, and the wind is not strong. It is not very friendly to women with long and thick hair. Blowing hair feels like pulling on an elastic cord for half an hour. ,Ha ha. It is recommended to prepare some powerful hair dryers for room service, which guests can use by phone. All in all, the overall value for money is very high! recommend!

msg:Since 2010, I have been coming to Sanya two or three times almost every year, and each time I have stayed in at least two five-star resort hotels for more than three nights. So now I have basically stayed in all the relatively big-name hotels in Sanya, but it happens that this This is my first time staying at Shangri-La, and it is also my first time to come to Sanya during the coldest time. I chose Shangri-La mainly because of my two children. I have heard about Shangri-La’s various meticulous services for children. Seeing it is better than seeing it. I regret not taking advantage of it. I came here several times when I was a child. Everything here is really designed for children, especially the three constant-temperature swimming pools, which are so deep that they are very child-friendly. The indoor playground, various outdoor projects, and swimming pool facilities are all in Sanya during the Great Cold Season. The temperature during the day is about 28°C, but it does feel cold to the body, and it is even colder when entering the water. Even so, it cannot stop the children from yearning for water. The breakfast is also the richest I have ever had in so many hotels, especially for children. In the dining area, there is absolutely no restaurant better than his. The most important thing is that even during the peak dining period, you will not be kept waiting for too long. This is due to Shangri-La's management team. The service is in place and the response speed is very fast. This must be praised. Although I chose Xi Restaurant for my child’s birthday during this trip to Shangri-La, I was unhappy because of the slow service. However, it also made me realize that Shangri-La’s service is in place. This must be praised. Manager Chen, the person in charge of catering services I rushed over to apologize in various ways as soon as possible, and finally waived the order, and took special care of me when dining in the next few days. With this kind of service awareness, what reason do I have not to turn my unhappiness into appreciation? This is the service a five-star hotel should have! With a leader like Manager Chen, the entire team will be great! Another thing that must be praised is Shangri-La's butler service, which is absolutely necessary for high-quality service. Our butler GaGa this time was particularly nice. First of all, I rarely write reviews. I saw on the Internet those hotel service staff who are mentioned by name as soon as they come up. The first impression of the review is that it is a forced hotel behavior. I hereby solemnly declare that this is definitely a personal behavior and I spontaneously praise the hotel service staff! From the time I placed the order and quickly contacted me to confirm the itinerary and needs, to the check-in that tried to meet the previous needs, to the various services, and the timely communication and handling of any problems, and finally to the check-out, I did not feel any discomfort. It also made me recognize the hotel very much! To sum it up in the words of our two children: I will stay at Shangri-La next time!

msg:This time I went to Sanya and I was very glad that I finally chose Shangri-La to stay. The baby had a great time.

Service: The service is very attentive. Before departure, the butler team provides WeChat service and helps to book many popular parent-child activities in advance. I would like to thank you very much for staying here, vera. The replies were very prompt during the 5 days, helping with luggage, making restaurant reservations, etc. Thank you for your hard work.

Hygiene: The cleaning lady is also very good. She paid attention to the time before going out. When we came back, the room was completely new and very comfortable.

Restaurant: This time I tried two restaurants in Shangri-La, the Western restaurant Kontic and the Southeast Asian restaurant Xi. The taste and service are very good. I have to mention here the drink "Sawadika" at Xi Restaurant. I didn't know what it was, but I just thought it tasted so good that I couldn't help but drink two glasses in a row.

Next time I have a chance to go to Sanya, I will probably choose Shangri-La. 😀

Every waiter we encountered was warm and courteous, making our 4 days a pleasant one. The swimming pool is heated, so there is no pressure in the water in winter. The hotel has all-day child care, and you can drop off your baby from 9 to 6 for only RMB 480 a day. Hahaha, it is the most affordable child care service in the nearby hotels. Unexpectedly, the travel photography is also very impressive. Although it is photoshopped, it is really beautiful and the package is not expensive. All in all, Sanya is a great place and I look forward to visiting again next time!

It's just a few minutes' walk from the beach. There aren't as many people as the tourist attractions, and there's a lot for children to play! And it’s very clean, so you can have a lot of fun playing with it! There is also duty-free shop pick-up and drop-off, which runs every half an hour, which is very convenient!
The complimentary photos will not waste time and will produce good results. If you like it, you can choose two more at your own expense!

There is a door on the wall between this room and the next room, and the sound insulation of this door is very poor. I thought it was just this one room, so I reported it to your staff. The staff gave me The answer was "We are a Star Hotel, and this door is to meet the needs of travelers, and most of them are like this." First of all, I couldn't accept it from my heart. I didn't want to open this door on the wall in the middle of the night, and I really didn't need it. , why did you arrange such a room for me? At around nine o'clock, the neighbor next door tried several times to open the door. No one who wants to go on vacation should encounter this kind of strange encounter!

Hygiene: Hygiene conditions are in line with expectations, and no major problems are found overall. The water in the swimming pool is disinfected regularly and looks very clean, which is worthy of praise.

msg:We stayed in 2 room types, the Premier Ocean View and the Horizon Club. The Horizon Club is facing the sea, and the Premier is side-facing. We can see the sea on one side, and we can see the mangroves and Yate buildings in the front and back. Haitang Bay Hotel is quite far from the beach. A higher floor might be better, but a lower one is blocked by coconut trees in front. The hotel service is good, and staff will come to inquire. The swimming pool and gym are very good, but the hotel is still a bit old. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to Haitang 68, but the things in Haitang 68 are quite expensive. A pack of 8 pieces of coconut sugar sells for 48 yuan. On the first night of my stay, I encountered the hotel's Chris**as lighting ceremony. The staff wore Chris**as costumes, there were various ceremonies, and the band was very lively. I heard there would be fireworks at 20:30, but we missed it both nights until we saw the Atlantis fireworks and drone show at 7:00. The hotel's executive lounge has good snacks, fruits, and drinks. The honor and administration are in the same building. There is a front desk downstairs where you can make room cards, issue invoices, call shuttles, etc. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with a variety of meals in the four corners of the breakfast room. The hotel has a Western restaurant, Southeast Asian restaurant, Shang Palace and chi spa. I also encountered a private wedding during my stay, which felt relatively average.

Because the hotel is very large and the environment is beautiful. You can watch the waves on the Bund and listen to the rising and falling of the tide. Listen to the sounds, look at the beautiful scenery of nature, the mountains and rivers blend together, and spend your days listening to the wind and watching the sea in a leisurely and leisurely way.
I chose Hong Kong Lira because my favorite thing is the hotel's service. The hotel front desk staff: Hedy (Ms. Huang) is warm and polite. She always asks us carefully if we need more help and answers our questions one by one. Thank you Hedy for your attentiveness. With care and love, you feel like home at Shangri-La Hotel!
The hotel's Chinese chef, Mr. Yang (Yang Chengyang), was equally enthusiastic and courteous when picking up the food for breakfast. He introduced the food to us with a smile on his face, and we enjoyed the joyful food every moment.
In addition, Crystal (Ms. Zhu) was also a very polite and attentive staff member I met at breakfast that day.
Thank you to every staff member for your hard work, thank you! If I have the opportunity to come to Sanya again, my best choice is still the Shangri-La Hotel.

msg:Let’s write down the bad feelings first in chronological order:
1. When you enter the room, the free mineral water is ice dew, which personally feels like it lowers the quality of Shangri-La;
2. The day before check-in, I received a call from a Shanghai phone number saying it was from Shangri-La, and asked me if I could tell me my mobile phone number so that the hotel housekeeper could add me and help me. It turned out that the messages the housekeeper sent me were all basic entertainment information in the hotel, which didn’t seem to be very helpful. When we arrived, he said he didn’t know I was taking care of the kids. I was wondering why you didn’t ask me first if I had brought them. My child, do you need a bed bumper or something like that? The various entertainment projects were introduced at the beginning, which made me think there is a commission? I think it is necessary to strengthen training on this point;
3. The hotel has many entertainment projects, but it was not informed in advance that some activities can only be played twice a day (karting) or there are only 10 free rounds per day (shooting). As a result, I didn’t know about it for the first two days, and then I went to go karting. The on-site staff said that each room can only be played twice a day. The problem is that the staff who made my reservation said there is no limit to the number of times I can play. I just need to wait in line after playing once. I don’t know how the hotel’s service communicates.
good aspect:
1. The hotel's entertainment options are indeed rich. I originally brought my children on vacation. The children were too young (less than 5 years old) and did not leave the hotel for several days. Playing in the hotel was enough;
2. The water temperature of the outdoor constant-temperature swimming pool is not bad. The staff measured it at 28°C, and the outdoor temperature was only 22°C. It is quite comfortable to be in the water;
3. The staff are quite good, they will take the initiative to provide help, and they will actively solve the problem when asking for help.

The best thing is the birthday cake and birthday card prepared by the housekeeper Eisy for the children. She also gave them hairpins and shell necklaces made by herself. The children were very happy (they couldn't finish the big cake)
The Horizon Club sea view room booked also comes with Horizon Club benefits. In addition to breakfast, there is also afternoon tea and happy hour. There are not many types of bread in the afternoon tea, but the taste is very good, and the happy hour taste is also good. It can definitely be used as dinner!
We recommend Shangri-La’s seafood porridge and beef porridge, both for breakfast and happy hour. Children also like it.
Although their hardware is a bit old, everything else is very good and very cost-effective. The service of Eisy, the butler, is even better👍 I will choose this place for my kids in the future.

msg:I temporarily booked a Horizon Club sea view room for my child's birthday, and the hotel helped upgrade it to a jungle parent-child room. The room is very comfortable, clean and tidy, and the bathroom is very comfortable to take a shower.
In the future, when booking Shangri-La, you must book a hotel with a Horizon Club. All food and drink issues for the whole family will be left to the Horizon Club.
There are many parent-child activities, including slides in the heated swimming pool, lawn go-karts, animal parks, shooting, and archery, and the children have a lot to gain. Participated in adventure park activities and made water fountains and rockets. The children said that they must stay a few more days next time.

Hedy added WeChat a day in advance to contact us if we have any special requests. I received the text message as soon as we got off the plane. The room was ready and upgraded. The room had a small garden. When the child had a fever, we were given plain porridge and an hour's delay in check-out. It immediately made me feel at ease.

Environment: The environment is very good, with a large lawn, a children's play area, a go-kart park, a children's playground, and a small zoo! There aren’t many people in the off-season and it’s relatively quiet!
(The children's paradise is a bit small. Some are free for young children, and some are suitable for those over 5 years old. They charge 150 yuan a day...slightly expensive...because after all, children mainly want to swim and beach, and the park will not last long... I guess I could only play for half an hour at most, so I finally chose to leave)

Service: The staff is very enthusiastic! The little housekeeper Vera is very conscientious! The little monkey mascot in the lobby is also very responsible. He coaxed my daughter to play for a long time and she almost fainted😆

Meal: Because the breakfast experience at Shangri-La in Guangzhou was very good, I chose to experience it here, but there is still a slight gap and can be slightly improved!

Overall, the experience is good. Although there is no special feature, for a hotel of the same price, Shangri-La is still relatively cost-effective, and it can be said to be higher than hotels of the same price! Very recommended! I will continue to consider staying here next time!

The breakfast is exquisite and delicious, and I feel very good while admiring the unparalleled sea view. Thanks to Ben, the butler, for his considerate service during our stay. Every day he enthusiastically introduced various parent-child activities in the hotel and asked about our needs. He was very attentive and helped us solve many things! The child sprained his foot in the middle, and the front office manager sent medicine promptly and provided considerate service. While swimming, I witnessed an old man losing his footing in the water. The lifeguard jumped into the water in time to save the man, causing water to enter his mobile phone. I hope the hotel can help repair it. The dedication and attentiveness of the hotel staff gave us a good experience. In terms of facilities, I hope the hotel can add outdoor climbing activities and reduce some children's charging items, which would be perfect! The overall evaluation is very suitable for family vacation.

msg:This is the 7th day of my trip in Sanya with my child. We stayed in 3 hotels in total. Shangri-La was the last one. We have to fly back tomorrow. At 12 o'clock in the evening, my child suddenly suffered from acute mumps. He kept complaining of pain and his face was swollen. I was very old, because I had to fly the next day, and I didn’t dare to delay. I asked the hotel where to go to see a pediatrician. It was probably about this time that the hotel learned about the child’s illness. I went to the hospital to see a doctor in the middle of the night. After the round trip and the doctor’s visit, it was almost midnight when I got back to the hotel. It was 5 o'clock, and because it was an administrative building, the guy at the door immediately arranged a shuttle bus to take us back to the room. Seeing that a child was uncomfortable, he asked us if we needed to drive slower. Our housekeeper Nada asked early the next morning. Regarding our child's condition, do we need some light food? The child's face was swollen and he could not open his mouth. I said that the child might not be able to make time for breakfast and was still sleeping. Nata specially prepared noodles, porridge and vegetables for the child and sent them to the hotel room. Our The flight was at 6 pm, and Nata had already arranged a delayed check-out for us until 2 pm. After the child got sick, he took the initiative to ask us if we wanted to delay the check-out for another 2 hours. From the moment we entered the hotel, Nata introduced us to the hotel and gave us We provided a lot of help, and the children had a great time playing in the hotel for two days. As the hotel environment in Sanya Haitang Bay is similar, improving the residents' experience depends on details. Once again, we would like to thank the hotel and our housekeeper Nada!

msg:I took my mother and daughter to Sanya for a few days. I read a lot of guides and reviews before choosing a hotel, and finally chose Shangri-La after comprehensive consideration. Facts have proved that the choice was right. Two days before check-in, the housekeeper contacted us in advance to ask about the approximate check-in time and any other needs, because bringing children requires bed guards, dehumidifiers, and children's toiletries. Everything was ready when we checked in, and the dehumidifier was turned on in advance. After arriving at the hotel, check-in was very fast. We were given a children's activity reservation introduction form. Because the Horizon Club we booked was an executive package, we were also given a form for afternoon tea and happy hour time included in the executive package. (Some children's activities need to be reserved one day in advance, so please be aware of your own schedule.) The rooms are in an island resort style. Although the hotel has been open for a long time, it can be seen that it is maintained with care, the hygiene is also very good, and the attitude of each room attendant They are all very nice and friendly. The breakfast the next day was also good, with a full range of varieties. There is also a special dining area for children, which is highly suitable for children to choose their own food. There is also a cute monkey to greet you at the door, which your baby likes very much. It's only a few minutes' walk from the beach. The sea breeze is strong, but the scenery is really nice. It's great to step on the water and play in the sand. The road approaching the beach is lined with trees and lawns. Those who like taking pictures will like it. At noon, I took advantage of the good temperature to go to the water children's activity area. There are water slides for children to play in and several swimming pools. I would like to express my special thanks to the hotel staff and housekeeper Jolie. We went to the hospital the next night because our baby was coughing. When the staff received the call, they immediately arranged for a battery car to pick us up. It was already past five o'clock when we drove back from the hospital. On the evening of November 29th, The staff on duty confirmed our room number with us in the lobby. After seeing us struggling all night, they offered to delay our check-out until three o'clock. They also packed breakfast for us in the room the next day. It was so heart-warming. The next day the housekeeper arranged for a battery car to take us directly to the ba*****t to put our luggage before leaving. The service of the hotel is really nothing to say. The customer service staff, the electric car guy who wore glasses on the late shift that night, and the late shift staff in the lobby are really grateful. The baby said that there are many activities and there is not enough time to play, so he will come again next time. Next time I go to Sanya, I will definitely visit Shangri-La. Thanks again🌹🌹🌹🥰

During our stay, whether it was room arrangement or coordination of requests, everything was resolved very well. Shangri-La is a very cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay. The hotel facilities are well maintained and suitable for vacation. The park is a good way to pass the time while strolling around. It has a temperature-controlled swimming pool, a children's pool, a small train, and a go-kart. The hotel's Horizon Club room is very close to the sea. You can hear the sound of the waves from the room. The Horizon Club executive benefits also include afternoon tea and happy hour. You don't have to leave the hotel and you can have three meals a day. Will stay again if I have the chance

The overall service attitude of the hotel is very good, and the facilities are well maintained. There are many parent-child programs that are impossible to play. Some are free, some are paid, and some require reservations. The restaurant has a children's dining area, and the drinks in the children's dining area are specially provided at room temperature, which is a perfect detail💯. The hotel has beautiful scenery, high green coverage, and the large lawn is well maintained. The two-color slide in the water park is something you will definitely not regret after playing. If you don’t go to Atlantis, young babies will have a lot of fun playing this slide. The swimming pool lifeguards are very serious and responsible. There are many entertainment items in the children's playground, and the staff's precautions are explained in detail. The staff in the entire hotel are very enthusiastic. It can be seen that they are busy and tired, but everyone works hard and is very efficient. Especially for breakfast, it is easiest to queue up, but the hotel has maximized efficiency in seating, collecting meals, cleaning, etc. The waiters are very discerning and will immediately provide children's tableware when they see children. People who work hard are the cutest. The participation of housekeepers in the service may be the current hotel management model, which has indeed improved the satisfaction rate. Thank you to the housekeeper Linda for her service. The hotel has access to the beach, but the beach is a public area and is not managed by hotel personnel. It is purely wild and has no lifeguards. The beach motorcycle is even more wild. It is forced to sell and induces children to get on the car. It drives very fast. After playing for a few times, the child is afraid that he will not want to play. There is also a mandatory fee, 180 for 20 minutes. After playing for 5 minutes, he will give him half the price. Refuse. The QR code used to pay was personal. He also said that the money would be given to the hotel and that no discounts could be given. There was no evidence or invoice. I said that I wanted to argue with the hotel, but I changed my story and said that it belonged to the Sheraton and that the beach was public. He is free. Public beaches are unmanaged and the safety of entertainment facilities is low, so everyone can make their own judgment.
Shangri-La is a quality hotel I will choose next time🏨.

There are not many children's activities during the day, which is more suitable for our children. There are not many people in the hotel as a whole, and it looks very clean haha. However, we only used the afternoon tea and happy hour once, and we were really disappointed that there was nothing. However, in terms of price, the price-performance ratio is still very good, recommended

The hotel covers a large area, has many swimming pools, a large lawn, a forest park, a children's water park, a children's indoor park and a wealth of parent-child activities. Free activities like archery and zip lining, as well as a mini zoo. The LooHoo jungle-themed room we stayed in was in the Horizon Club (Ocean Building). It had a small courtyard, and it was only a few dozen meters away from the courtyard to the children's pool, which was very convenient. My children like the children's swimming pool and the bubble show the most. They go swimming every day after breakfast. When they are tired from swimming, they go back to take a bath and have lunch. They rest for a while and then play in the water in the afternoon. All the needs of preschool children can be met in the hotel without leaving home. The buffet is in Building 3. There is a special children's meal area where children can see and choose their favorite food. Before checking into the hotel, Damei, the housekeeper, added me on WeChat. If I have any questions, I can communicate with the housekeeper. When we checked in, Damei received our family and helped call the luggage cart to deliver the luggage to the room. She also sent fruit to the room every day and sent it to My hotel provided maps and children's activities, and responded to my requests for help. I gave my children Loohoo dolls, a small backpack, a small photo album, and a family shell necklace. I also gave my children a ticket to an adventure park because the flight we took on the day of check-out was relatively small. We stayed late and even helped delay check-out until 2pm, which was very nice. Building 1, where we live, is quite some distance from Building 3, where the lobby is located. There is a special battery car which is very convenient. You can also take a battery car in Building 3 to the mini zoo behind Building 5, which is only a two-step walk away. The shooting range zip line and helipad are very convenient. There is a small road to the beach, and you can only walk to the beach and the sea viewing platform by yourself. However, you can pass by the sea viewing platform when the small train travels around (you cannot get off the train halfway). I stayed at Xiangjia for 3 nights to familiarize myself with the terrain. If I stay here next time, I can have more fun. I have read netizens' reviews of Shangri-La before, and I have experienced all the good reviews. I have not encountered any negative reviews. The service we experienced was quite good. The butler Damei, the front desk, and the waiters we met on various occasions were all warm and polite. The package purchased for hotel travel photography is not cheap and the shooting results are good.

He introduced the hotel very warmly, the service was attentive and enthusiastic, and he led us all the way back to the room. The downstairs of the Deluxe Pavilion is right next to the water park and beach. It is very convenient. Children can participate in bubble parties. The service experience is good and the sanitary facilities and equipment are good. I will stay for a few more days next time.

msg:For the Horizon Club, which costs 1,000 yuan, afternoon tea only includes meal bags, biscuits, and apples and bananas.
I changed two rooms in the Horizon Club, both of which had a disgusting stench. I have stayed in beach hotels many times, and this was the first time I encountered it. It smelled like an elderly person. Water seeps from the floor of the bedroom at night, making it easy for children to slip when walking.
The hotel guest service basically does not see any feedback from customers except for providing refreshing drinks. Including me canceling the room for the second night because of the musty smell, they still turned a deaf ear.
A few hours after checking out, the hotel guest manager called me and threatened me morally to prevent me from writing a negative review.
Real review, won’t stay here again!

msg:Before check-in, the housekeeper Hedy contacted us by phone and added WeChat to inquire about our needs in detail. On the day of check-in, we arrived a little late because we just came from Atlantis. Hedy helped us arrange the room in advance and made reservations for the children's activities for the next day.
Compared with the excitement of Atlantis, Shangri-La has a proper family vacation style. Southeast Asian style gardens, leisurely and quiet luxury pavilion breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour, you can have three meals a day without leaving home.
The hotel's parent-child activities are quite rich, and it's really fun from morning to night. The hotel also has custody services, which is really good at freeing up parents' hands.
We stayed in a Horizon Club ocean view king bed room, and Hedy helped me arrange the highest floor. There is a sofa bed in the room, which is enough for us, two adults and two children. The lobby in Building 1 is relatively far away, but the shuttle bus responds in a timely manner and is always on call.
The hotel's service 🉑️, the housekeeper Hedy would take care of us from time to time, and any questions we raised were satisfactorily resolved. When we were participating in a parent-child activity, our children's clothes were left behind at LooHoo Paradise. Hedy helped us communicate with the hotel and sent them to our room. Before leaving, the hotel also gave two children departure gifts. It is worthy of being one of the hotels in Haitang Bay that focuses on families with children.
Some of the entertainment items in the hotel are outsourced to third parties. The charges are clearly marked and the service is good. However, in a star-rated hotel, you can't pay the room bill even though you pay a deposit. This still feels weird.
Overall, Shangri-La is very suitable for a slow-paced vacation, which is exactly what we needed after our trip to Yate. Thank you to Shangri-La and the butler Hedy for the good experience! ! !

The floor and location of the room are particularly good. You can see the lawn and the sea from the balcony, and it only takes a few minutes to walk to the seaside viewing platform. The baby especially liked the hotel swimming pool and played happily for a long time. Specialty trains are also popular. Went to the Xiangzhen Garden Party family party in the evening. The fire show and lawn go-karts were both highly recommended. There is also a children's playground and animal feeding. In short, there are many activities and it is worth staying for a few more days~

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, in the middle of Haitang Bay, with Atlantis on the left and JW Marriott on the right. The beach is carefully lit up at night (this is in the hotel on the long Haitang Bay beach) Not very common), but Haitang Bay has strong winds and high waves, so it is not suitable for going into the sea at all. The beach is very good and flat, suitable for walking and aerial photography. The staff at Shangri-La are as good as ever. Nada communicated throughout the process and helped reserve projects. Children can play in the children's playground for a whole day, and go-karts can be driven for an hour when there are few people. The executive lounge (called the Horizon Club in Shangri-La) is OK, and the breakfast and dinner are good, but there are few types of afternoon tea. The breakfast area in the main building is large, but most of them are with children, so it is quite noisy and chaotic. The hotel facilities are a bit old, and some areas have been neglected. We came from St. Regis Yalong Bay, so the hardware gap is relatively large, which is much worse than expected, but the service makes up for the hardware gap. During the National Day holiday, wages are tripled, so it’s understandable that hotel prices double.

So this time when I went to Sanya to take care of my baby, I decisively chose Shangri-La. I booked the Horizon Club Ocean View, and I can see the hotel swimming pool, lawn, and sea from the window sill. A housekeeper will contact you 2 days before moving in to ask if you have any special needs, etc.
There are many types of breakfast, and there is a separate children's area. Children's meals are served in small bowls, which is very considerate. After breakfast, you can also take a small train to visit the park. Children are playing so much that they don’t want to get out of the car 😂😂
There will also be lawn go-karts at the Xiangzhen Garden Party. Maybe the baby is too young to feel it, so he stopped sitting after one ride. My brothers who went with me queued up several times. In the evening there was a bonfire performance, bamboo pole dancing, free makeup on Halloween, and a little crazy on stage, hahaha, it was so interesting, Wall Crack recommends it,

msg:Except for the breakfast, everything else about this hotel is very good. The service is very good and warm. There are so many activities that it’s impossible to free your hands haha. Stay at least three nights, otherwise you won't have time to play at all. There’s nothing to say about the price, it’s so cost-effective.
Breakfast: The quality and taste are not good and need to be improved. The advantage is that there is a special children's eating area, with special children's tables and chairs and a low dining area, equipped with cartoons, and many of them are not missing condiments and are suitable for babies. Yes, but the quality of the bread is too low. It should be bought from outside and the quality is very poor. Generally speaking, none of the breakfast items taste good. It’s okay to eat until you’re full without asking.
Room: Booked a premium sea view king bed room, the actual view is as shown in the picture. Equipped with a large balcony, it is very convenient to dry clothes. The sound insulation is not good, and the sound of talking and closing the door in the corridor in the morning is loud. The toilet and shower are very cheap, and smoking is allowed in the corridor. The butler added WeChat in advance, and it was very convenient to answer all my questions. My butler Eisy's service was great and attentive.
Children's activities: There are many activities and a wide variety of courses. There are several swimming pools, all of which are large. There are children's pool slides and special swimsuit changing rooms with a very good environment. There are almost no people in the indoor children's playground and it is very clean. You must wear socks to enter. Long-sleeved and long pants are required for children over 5 years old to play on the slides. There is a children's toilet inside, which is very clean and convenient. Shooting and archery on the lawn are available once a day in each room, and archery is only available to those aged 7 and above. There are also food and princess styling, a pool bubble party at 5:30 every day, and go-kart and bonfire performances after 6 p.m., all free.
Beach: This hotel does not have a private beach, it is a public beach. It is best to bring your own sand digging tools. You can rent them for free in the indoor children's park, but the tools are not very good.
Transportation: **Taking a taxi is very convenient. It costs just over 10 yuan to eat and browse near the duty-free shop. It is also very convenient to order takeout. You can pick it up at the hotel takeout counter.

msg:The family's children were born at the beginning of the epidemic, and because of their weak allergies and allergies, they have not traveled long distances in more than three years. The whole family is very much looking forward to this trip. Many of my friends had chosen Haitang Bay Shangri-La when they came to Sanya before. The reviews were very good, so they directly booked five nights this time. Facts have proved that this decision was very correct. It’s been a long time since I’ve written a long review, but this treasure hotel really deserves to be praised:
Service: This is what I think is the best point. It focuses on love. As a business traveler, I often stay in hotels. I visited Sanya many times before giving birth to my baby, but this time I was still amazed by the service of this hotel. I called many times to ask about various details before coming. Both the front desk and the reservation depar**ent were very enthusiastic and patient. The day before check-in, the reservation depar**ent called to inquire about the check-in time, and arranged for a specialist to inform the hotel of various activities via WeChat. When I checked in the next day, I met the beautiful and friendly commissioner Gaga. The little beauty introduced the hotel's facilities and activities in detail. My parents felt very warm and the fatigue of the trip was gone. Gaga helped make reservations for children's activities, and also thoughtfully sent information about the restaurant. She came on time every morning to know how satisfied we were with the stay. Words are not enough to express our gratitude for the thoughtful care. The staff in the hotel rooms, lobby, restaurant, and fitness center are also very friendly and kind. The management of the old and high-quality hotel is indeed excellent. In contrast, when I called a high-rise hotel before, the reply was cold, so the room price is not always directly proportional to the service.
Facilities: Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the facilities are very well maintained and there is no such thing as mold. The swimming pool officially opens at ten o'clock in the morning. Before opening, you can see the staff cleaning it very seriously. Children feel safe swimming in it. The hotel's two large lawns are pleasing to the eye and great for taking photos.
Catering: The hotel has three restaurants, a Chinese restaurant, a Southeast Asian restaurant and a Western restaurant. Dianping has set meals, which are very affordable for a family, and the set meals are all freshly made, not pre-made dishes. I have tried them in several restaurants and they taste great. Great, the little dregs at home turn into dry rice in seconds. The breakfast is rich in variety. Although there are many people during peak hours, it does not feel noisy. The door service staff will arrange the seats. The hotel is also very close to Haitang 68 Food Court, which is convenient for dining.
Parent-child: The hotel has rich parent-child programs, with various activities every day. The slide in the children's pool is very unique. There are children's toilet seats and small stools in the room, and the parent-child room also has a tent that children love.
Beach: Although the beach at Haitang Bay is not as convenient as Yalong Bay for getting into the sea, it does not affect taking photos and allowing children to ride the waves and dig in the sand.
All in all, I am very satisfied, no flaws! The kid said he wanted to stay for another 100 days!

I would like to ask the leaders of Sanya Shangri-La, are you all ***? First of all, when I entered the room, it smelled musty. The air conditioner blew out the smell of mice. The towels were dirty and there was no place to sit. What was even worse was that there were so many bugs on the bed when I slept at night that I couldn't sleep all night. I slept, and someone came to check out early in the morning before 12 o'clock. I had a lot of luggage and no one came to pick it up for a long time. The concierge's capacity was seriously insufficient, and there were only a few women to help with the luggage. What's even more ridiculous is that because In special circumstances, I asked the etiquette depar**ent to get food, but in the end I had to sign a liability exemption agreement. I would like to say that it is understandable that the hotel has regulations, but in special circumstances: regulations are dead and people are alive! In short, if you can avoid this hotel, avoid it and don’t stay there!

The next day when we were out shopping at the duty-free shop, it was raining heavily. The housekeeper sent a car for Master Wang to take us back to the hotel from the duty-free shop. He also arranged for warm-up brown sugar ginger tea. The management and staff of the hotel are of good quality. The rooms are clean and sanitary. Luggage delivery, check-in and check-out are convenient and fast. The afternoon tea is great. It embodies the culture and service concept of an old hotel. All in all, we had a great stay, and I highly recommend staying here.

The housekeeper did not apologize immediately or find a solution, but asked us not to keep the balcony door open. Aren't we afraid of mosquitoes? With the door open, if there is no moisture in the room, how come there is a dehumidifier? Why are there no dehumidifiers in other rooms? Do you know how long it takes for a dehumidifier to be filled with water from empty to full? For six hours, you will remember it once you get up in the middle of the night and change it. There was poor communication between various depar**ents of the hotel. I checked out for a day and a night. The reservation depar**ent never reviewed the check-out, which resulted in the security deposit not being refunded. I contacted the housekeeper but there was no reply. I contacted the front desk, and the front desk said that it was checked out, so I contacted the reservation depar**ent. The reservation depar**ent also needs to contact other colleagues. How many colleagues do you have to contact? Then the computers in the same depar**ent are not connected to the Internet, and the information is not shared.

Eat: The breakfast is extremely rich, and my son exclaimed, "It's so awesome that things like chicken popcorn can also appear in breakfast." The Western restaurant is a little expensive, but the steaks, pasta, and lobster are really good. I highly recommend trying it. Accommodation: We booked a room with a large bed and a sofa bed, which was very suitable for our family of four. Nada, the housekeeper, escorted us and provided enough bath towels and mineral water in the room. We swam and went to the beach several times a day without worrying about running out of bath towels. Service: I forgot to order a cake for our wedding anniversary. Miss Nada asked the bakery to help us make one for us in 3 hours. It was just in time for the anniversary. There was really no regrets. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay here.

When I first checked in, the lady at the front desk was not very enthusiastic, and the shuttle bus was not obvious. Later, the housekeeper Jolie was added, and the service was warm and thoughtful. She gave us welcome fruits and helped us with late check-out. Special thanks to Jolie, I will see her next time I come.
Shangri-La seems to focus on leisure, and the floors are not as high as Atlantis, so there are not too many children. The slides in the water park and the go-karts on the beach are very fun, and children especially like them. The jungle-themed room we stayed in was on the first floor. It had a small garden and direct access to the swimming pool. There were no mosquitoes, which was great. The room also has a very large sofa bed, which is very comfortable to sleep on. Overall very satisfied, super unexpected.

This time we were greeted by Miss Li. She received us at the front desk and checked in directly without waiting for the room. We introduced hotel information, helped arrange rooms, and praised the service. The hotel's swimming pool is good, both for adults and children, and there is also a river swimming pool, which can pass through several bridge holes. Children like it. The buffet dinner was delicious, but I didn’t make it to breakfast the next day, but I tried it early in the morning. I saw rabbits and peacocks in the cute pet paradise, and shot guns and arrows🏹. The equestrian experience is also very good. The master also patiently guided the children. After riding horses so many times, it was the first time to ride a horse independently! The harvest was pretty good. We also introduced the horse mother and baby horse. They were super patient. Finally, they sent us back to visit the hotel😁A thumbs up to the racecourse guy👍🏻.

Stayed in the Horizon Club for two nights. The children have access to the swimming pool downstairs, which is very convenient. When the children are older, they also like to go to the gym.

The most grateful thing is that our housekeeper Vera guided us and gave us small gifts from the first day we checked in, which was very considerate. On the day of check-out, I accidentally lost my wallet. After I left Shangri-La, I remembered that it contained my ID card, credit card, etc. After several unsuccessful attempts to contact the front desk, I contacted Vera via WeChat with the intention of giving it a try. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, she helped me search for my leather bag by the hot pool, in the gym, and in the room. I finally found it. I was so touched. Vera really takes responsibility to the extreme.
My husband said that Shangri-La is Shangri-La, and the quality of its employees represents the style of Shangri-La! Come again during the Chinese New Year!

msg:Shangri-La is the best value for money during National Day.
Rooms: If you often stay in luxury hotels, the rooms are indeed a bit old, especially the shower room in the bathroom only has a small shower. The tiles are also yellow and give a dirty look. Personally, I feel that shampoo, body wash, and toothbrushes are relatively cheap. The hotel bathroom could use some upgrades. The nice thing is that the sofa can be pulled out and used as a bed, so our six-year-old child can sleep alone at night.
Breakfast: It is no exaggeration to say that this hotel has the deepest impression of all the hotels I have stayed in. It has real ingredients, a wide variety, and is particularly delicious. I can eat one breakfast and not be hungry all day. The restocking is quick and you won’t see an almost empty plate with no dishes. It's really a**ospheric. Now staying at Sofitel Lee Man, the breakfast will make you cry.
Swimming pool: The two large slides in the water park are very interesting. Adults can play too. There is also a swimming pool with a depth of 1.1 meters, which is very friendly to children. A six-year-old child can just reach the ground and is not afraid to practice swimming on his own. The swimming pool will also be covered, so you can swim under the shade during the day without being exposed to the sun.
The hotel has many parent-child activities. I participated in the activities on the Mid-Autumn Festival night and received prizes. After staying at Shangri-La, I felt that it was grand. The housekeeper Gaga is kind-hearted and added WeChat before checking in. When we arrived at the store, we were given a parent-child guide to guide us into the room. Although we forgot to send fruit during our stay, we reported it to Gaga and gave her a small gift. It's really a**ospheric. The room Gaga left me had a great view. Thank you very much to her.
Don't believe the bad reviews online, feel it in person and it's not that bad. Shangri-La is for down-to-earth people.

I chose Xiaoxiang out of habit. After making a reservation, I called and met the caring Nancy. 🌹After simple communication, everything was already arranged when we arrived at the hotel. The young lady thoughtfully helped us with upgrades, anniversary decorations, etc., and took us back to the room during the entire check-in process. The child said it was very warm like a sister taking us home. This is our first time to experience Haitang Bay Xiaoxiang. The hardware level is as good as ever, and it has more of a romantic island style. Watching the sunrise, feeding the rabbits, and feeling the long-lost slow life, parent-child activities, and festival activities are all very rich. I can’t go out for a few days. No problem, I will stay a few more days next time⛱❤️️🌊

msg:I finally selected this hotel among the top ones in the list of parent-child hotels. It is cost-effective and has many parent-child activities (but we hardly participated in them). It can take half a day just to play in the children's pool. The two large rotating slides are also fun for adults. The water in the children's swimming pool is a bit dirty, with fallen leaves, dead dragonflies, and debris, but it does not affect the children's enjoyment. The Coral Building where I live has a musty and damp smell in the corridor, but the room is fine. The dehumidifier requires two boxes of water a day. The room facilities look like an old hotel, but the maintenance is good. Except for the dirty carpet, everything else is good. There are children's bathrobes, but there are no cotton mops. It was delivered quickly after calling. The breakfast is very rich, with many kinds, and there are also baby food. It rained when we arrived at the store, so the Xiangzhen garden party included in the package was cancelled, and we didn't get to play go-karts or anything else. The travel photography provided is okay. Anyway, it’s a modeled shooting. A bit of a drawback is that when selecting the film, you have to add a 100 yuan retouching fee. The package comes with negatives. The film selector assumes that you want to retouch the film for the first time, so he directly quotes 100 yuan, which is more. 60 a piece, but in the end I insisted on taking the negative and saved 100 by showing off my beautiful pictures. A deposit is still required to stay in a hotel guaranteed by Ctrip, but it will be credited soon after you check out. Children's supplies are universal, and there is a lot of mineral water in the room.

msg:After comparing many hotels, I am very satisfied with my choice of Shangri-La this time. I will contact and add WeChat one day before arrival to make arrangements in advance. I arrived late and there was no queue for check-in. Thank you to the butler Nicole for making notes in advance. We ourselves booked a Horizon Club twin room. Before arriving, I found that the double room seemed to have a sofa bed, which made it more comfortable for a family of three to sleep. When I came here, I changed to a double room. Overall, I was satisfied👍
The Horizon Club is on Building 1, which is the closest to the swimming pool. You will pass by the swimming pool and the train when you walk there. There are two options for breakfast in the Horizon Club. Children like it more lively. The breakfast in the main building is super rich, and the Happy Hour in the Horizon Club is for children. You can just eat and continue swimming~
nichole also sends itinerary information at any time to help children sign up for activities, but the helpless child likes to swim and play in the water 😂
Great hotel, but we just caught up with the typhoon weather, so we didn’t get to see many outdoor scenery, which is a bit regretful ~

msg:It can be said that this is a perfect travel experience: my family Duoduo is almost 6 years old and has never traveled before, so I took a few days off on the eve of the National Day and made a hotel guide in Sanya in advance for a family trip. Shangri-La Hotel. I received a call from hotel receptionist Nada 2 days in advance. WeChat sent a rich list of activities for the week, and someone from the leisure and activity center called to confirm the items that needed to be reserved in advance. I was already looking forward to it even before I arrived at the hotel.
    When I checked into the hotel, I received a cute little backpack. Duoduo was very happy to carry it every day when going out. The room we stayed in was large and square, with a direct view of the sea. The room had a complete set of children's living supplies and was well thought out, and the refrigerator was fully stocked with drinks.
    There are many activities every day. We stayed for 2 days and had limited time. We participated in a small train experience, a little princess diary, a travel photo shoot, children's pizza making, go-kart racing, family parties, etc. Unfortunately, it rained during the period, so we did not participate in some activities. or canceled, but overall it has exceeded expectations. I asked what was the best thing about Duoduo Hotel, and she said (like) swimming and Princess Diary. She would swim even if it rained. There was also a child whose father took a swimming video of Duoduo underwater and sent it to us. The experience was great. There will be very good memory material in the future.
    Generally, hotels only include breakfast, but Shangri-La also offers afternoon tea and happy hour (dinner), which means breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all included. Breakfast and dinner are relatively rich.
    There is a beach behind the hotel. The waves in Haitang Bay are relatively big. It is super fun to rush to the sea and run back and forth.
    Overall, the hotel's service is very good. Every day, Nada will ask if there is anyone who needs help or provide some precautions in a timely manner. It feels very considerate. Thank you. Communication with every hotel staff member was smooth and they all had smiles on their faces. The hotel's hardware facilities are very luxurious and there is nothing to fault. Shangri-La's focus on family-friendly hotels has been well proven. Various family-friendly activities are not the same, and you can stay there for several days without leaving the hotel. Anyway, when we checked out after staying for 2 days, Duoduo wanted to stay without leaving.

It is recommended to stay in a Horizon Club room, which is close to the seaside and has a sea view outside the window. It also has lounge benefits. It is enough to take the children to have dinner in the evening.

I also left my documents and cards at the hotel during this trip. I only found out after the hotel contacted me. Thanks to the responsible manager Tian and the room staff, I was very satisfied with my stay.

The hotel's breakfast and the happy hour in the lounge have a relatively rich menu, but the taste is similar. It is recommended to add some special dishes. In addition, the service attitude of some restaurant staff can be improved.
The room equipment is slightly old, but it is well maintained. The key is that the double room can add a large sofa bed for free. It is very friendly to me who is traveling with two children on a family trip. I must give it a thumbs up. The cleanliness of the room can only be said to be at a basic level. There were a few times where things were left out, and our clothes were always pushed together regardless of adults or children. This needs to be improved.
The children's pool is great, the lounge chairs are not all occupied, and free swimming rings for adults and babies are provided. The adult pool is a bit shallow, and it would be better if a deeper pool was added.
There are quite a lot of activities for children, but the children's park is a bit monotonous. However, the children mainly went to play in the water and did not encounter any problems.
If I stay in Haitang Bay in the future, I will most likely choose your hotel again.

msg:This is my first time visiting the Shangri-La Hotel in Haitang Bay. Their Southeast Asian style is pretty good. It’s much more distinctive than the one in Lujiazui, Shanghai. When I checked in, the room was temporarily upgraded to have a sea view. I was pleasantly surprised by Jolie (Zhang Qin), the housekeeper who handled the hotel from check-in to check-out. They were very attentive to us, answering all our questions and responding to our requests. I would definitely like it and like it. The afternoon tea at the pool included in the stay package we purchased was very rich. The lady Ada took the trouble to pack it for us and send it to the poolside. Like it. Finally, I would like to recommend their Xiang Zhen (ZHEN). ) Party with rich ingredients and rich programs, worth experiencing. The sand on the shore is relatively soft and you can go into the water and ride waves. The children were entertained and taken care of during their stay. The adults were experienced and respected. All in all, it was an unforgettable trip and I look forward to meeting again in the future.

msg:After two years, I came to Hainan again. This time I chose Sanya as my destination, mainly because my children could play on the beach and swimming pool. I chose Shangri-La Hotel with my friends. There is nothing to say about the service. There are many types of activities, both charged and free. , Nada, who is in charge of the reception, is kind and kind. He tries his best to satisfy all kinds of problems in the accommodation. I hope that the hotel can better separate the water sports from swimming and playing in the future. However, the service and safety are supervised by personnel throughout the process. Every worker The attitude of the staff is very good, the experience is very good, the children had a great time playing in the water, and I will go there next time if I have the opportunity.

The hotel is very beautiful. Although the whole hotel is very large, it is very convenient. There are abundant parent-child programs and facilities. The service staff are very friendly and polite. I would like to praise mainly: Linda, my room assistant, and the room maid in Room 05, Level 6, Horizon Club, let me feel Arrived at home.

First of all, the customer service specialist will call me one day in advance to ask about the arrival time and any special requirements
I booked the room type of the Horizon Club. After checking in at the main building, there will be a shuttle bus to send it over (in fact, it takes only 5 minutes to walk). Because I arrived earlier, I can have a simple afternoon tea in the VIP room of the Horizon Club. Room card, after the room is packed, just get the room card on the first floor of the Horizon Club. Breakfast, afternoon tea, and happy hour can be settled here all day without leaving the hotel.
Linda will send me messages every day to tell me the time and content of various activities in the hotel, and can also help me contact various depar**ents to make appoin**ents for parent-child programs and restaurants. All in all.
The children and the elderly haven't had enough fun here for two days, and they will definitely come again next time they come to Sanya.

On the wedding anniversary, I helped to decorate the room and sent a cake. The Horizon Club I booked this time is far from the main building, but there is a shuttle bus, and it takes only 5 minutes to walk. Afraid that there are too many people in the main building, breakfast is always eaten at the Horizon Club. There are not as many types as the main building, but the advantage is that there are fewer people. You don't need to make an appoin**ent. In fact, the dishes are enough. Afternoon tea in the afternoon can also be a good solution to children's problems of swimming and playing, hungry and anxious to eat. Talking about the environment, the greening of the hotel is very good, the large area of ​​grass is very clean, the overall hotel is very quiet, and the water park can meet the requirements of children of all ages, which is very suitable for the slow pace of vacation. In particular, you can order takeaway, and it can be delivered to your door without leaving the hotel. The hotel's own beach is also very clean, and small crabs can be found at night. The Horizon Club also provides a beach bag, which contains 🈶️ two hats, one for boys and one for girls, suitable for the elderly and children! In addition, you have to watch the sunrise, the angle is very good! In short, it is recommended to stay!

msg:This time I took my children to Sanya for fun. I booked hotels on Ctrip for a long time. I think Shangri-La Hotel should be a good brand as a five-star hotel, and Ctrip also gave him a high rating, so we are full of him. I lost trust and expectation, but I never thought that reality taught me a lesson:
1. Poor sanitation. On the first day of staying in the hotel, because I believed in the hotel, I didn't pull the quilt to check the hygiene of the sheets and other items. As a result, there were 3 bloodstains on the sheets, which we didn't find out in time because they were covered by the quilt. We got back to the hotel room and went to bed because we were late playing, and slept the whole night on the sheets with blood on them (the kids and I didn't have any wounds) and didn't realize it until we woke up the next morning (pictures). At that time, the most worrying thing was that the virus carried by the blood stains would be contagious. This problem was also expressed in the process of reporting it to the hotel. The hotel said no, let us rest assured. As a result, the rash started on my body the next day, and the child also started to develop a rash. Extremely itchy, on the back, on the neck, on the arms, on the stomach, underarms, on the legs, on the butt, everywhere (with pictures).
2. Hotel check-in is too slow. We checked in at the hotel lobby at 12:00 noon. The waiter said we had to wait until 15:30. We couldn't wait any longer and urged us many times, saying that the room was under construction, and finally gave us the room card when it was close to 16:00.
Let us tell you from our personal experience, and hope that everyone can learn from it. In the future, don’t be superstitious about the star rating and brand of the hotel. Be sure to check it yourself, especially the items that touch the skin, to prevent the virus from being infected and the body from being damaged. Especially those who bring children to live, must check, remember to remember! ! ! Once you get sick, the only one who suffers is yourself! ! !

Service: We stayed in 3 hotels in Sanya. Only Shangri-La’s housekeeper sent us to the room and helped us carry our luggage. At night, the sofa bed opened up and turned into a 1.5-meter bed. The children were very happy.

Location: Close to Atlantis, you can also take your children to see the fish next door, and it is also close to the duty-free shop

msg:Because of the epidemic, the last time I brought my baby to Sanya was in 2019. I have stayed in Atlantis, Yanheng Crowne Plaza, and Marriott before. This time I weighed between Ritz-Carlton and Shangri-La for a long time and finally booked the latter and had a perfect vacation. In particular, I would like to thank the customer service specialist Ben, who connected with WeChat from the day before the departure, and gave various warm reminders. Throughout the holiday, he thought of what we wanted and responded to every request. It can be said that without Ben, a warm man, we would not have a perfect holiday. In addition, the Shangri-La Hotel is full of the exquisiteness of old-school hotels, with beautiful landscape design and even a helicopter in the hotel! The details are also quite attentive. For example, the soap provided has two sizes, which is convenient for washing hands and bathing suits. As long as you go for breakfast before nine o'clock, you basically don't need to queue up. One day we went at nine thirty and only had a short queue. The hotel has a very beautiful lawn, cute little rabbits, guinea pigs, free trains, archery, shooting and a variety of children's activities. The swimming pool also has awnings so that it is not exposed to the hot sun all the time. If you come to Sanya, Shangri-La is definitely a good choice. It is also very convenient to go to the nearby Atlantis Water World and Aquarium, and at the same time you don't have to endure the noise and crowds of Atlantis.

I was a little worried~ Although the hotel I stayed in is not new, it is still well maintained. The rooms, bathrooms and balconies are very spacious~ Walking to the beach in the Horizon Club is really good Very close! The housekeeper, Nancy, is really considerate and considerate. She arranged a floor for a room with a very good view. If I had any needs, I would help in a timely manner. Before I left, she offered to delay my check-out so that the children could play longer. Although I was in a hurry to go to the next door It's useless to play in Atlantis, but the service is greatly reduced when you get to the next door~ In addition, the Horizon Club is really strong. I have made many friends in the past few days. It is an independent building away from the beach pool They are very close, and you can check in downstairs to avoid the rush hour at the entrance. The happy hour of the Horizon Club is really the most varied in the executive lounge I have seen, and it can be eaten as a light meal~ The breakfast at the PS hotel is very rich, and it is also There is a children's dining area, which is great!

Sanya Shangri-La can definitely be called a parent-child hotel ceiling panel: 1. Parent-child activities are rich and colorful: shooting, archery, zipline, go-kart, trampoline, children's indoor playground, open-air movies and various forms of hand-made activities. 2. Meticulous service: Every staff member you meet in the hotel will greet you warmly. The housekeeper Nichole is especially responsible and will help you solve any problems immediately. You can drink water by the pool at any time, there are hot towels available, and there are a lot of mosquito lamps in the hotel. I didn’t get bitten during my stay, but I was bitten within three hours of staying in another hotel. 3. There are three swimming pools, the water is very clean, and there is a changing room next to it, equipped with shower gel. 4. The green design of the hotel is beautiful, and it is very pleasant to walk in the hotel. 5. The beach is very quiet, the sand is very fine, and you can see the glass sea. 6. The network is very, very fast. The child needs to use the computer to participate in the competition on the last day, and the Internet speed is rattling. In short, this is definitely the first choice for parent-child hotels

msg:For the five-day and four-night itinerary, I chose Shangri-La Resort Hotel for my first trip to Sanya, because it was an evening flight that arrived at the hotel after 9:00 pm that day, and the staff would take the initiative to help with the luggage. The person who received us was Vera, who saw us bringing the baby Give the welcome gift that is ready now! After adding WeChat, they sent us all the hotel-related information, almost answering every question! Later, we added welcome fruits and some local snacks. The fruits in Hainan are really delicious! When I learned that we were going to the duty-free shop, I immediately sent a hotel cooperation coupon, which can be said to be a discount! Really good! In addition, we only brought mosquito repellent stickers when we set off. We were afraid of being bitten when we went to the Coconut Dream Corridor, so we asked the hotel if they sold mosquito repellent water. Vera also immediately arranged for us to send a few bottles of toilet water! Thank you so much! She also informed us of many precautions in advance! The service is really great! It is also very happy to live here! The rest of the hotel staff are also very enthusiastic! Oh, right! I most want to say that the hotel's buffet breakfast is really great! What keeps us from sleeping late on vacation is probably looking forward to the daily breakfast. We usually go to eat after 8 o’clock without queuing up. If you want to have brunch together, you can arrive a little later, but you need to queue up to enter the venue, so you don’t have to worry about the lack of food. Refills are fast! Chinese food, western food, mid-point western point, steak, Hainan noodles, steamed pork ribs rice with chicken feet, etc. are all available! There is also a special children's area, anyway we are quite satisfied with the breakfast! Next, let’s talk about the room. We booked the honor sea view double bed room. The room is relatively spacious. The room provides bathrobes and slippers for a family of three, as well as flip flops. The bathroom supplies are also very complete. The big bed is really big, and there is also a sofa bed that can be pulled out for children to sleep alone. The room also has a balcony. Outside the balcony is the big lawn downstairs of the hotel. There are bonfire parties and some family amu*****t projects. In the distance is The sea, the scenery can be said to be very seductive! On the fourth night, we chose to order takeaway in the room and sit on the balcony to enjoy the pink sunset. It can be said that we are so happy that we don’t want to go home! Hahaha... The reason for choosing Shangri-La is that there are water sports for children in the hotel, a private beach, etc., but after arriving, I found that there are actually many children's activities, which can be said to be not enough! Because of the limited number of people, some projects need to be reserved in advance, and the rest of the projects can be queued up according to the time, and the whole family can participate together. It is really suitable to bring the elderly and children, and it is also OK to go purely for a hotel vacation! Oh, by the way, it costs a lot to drink water when traveling, but in addition to about 6 bottles of water in the room every day in the hotel, there will be mineral water by the swimming pool in the gym, all of which are free, which can be said to be quite considerate ! Give a big thumbs up! The environment and greenery in the hotel are also really good. You can see the staff maintaining it every day. There is also a small forest inside. If you have time, you can go for a walk! If parents with babies want to free their hands and take care of their babies directly, they can go to a spa to relax! In the evening, meeting friends by the pool for a drink, listening to music and enjoying the sunset is simply beautiful! Alright~ I am very satisfied with Shangri-La this vacation! I hope the hotel will continue to be maintained, and I will choose this hotel again next time! Thank you for your service! Give you a thumbs up!
Tips: The hotel has a free shuttle bus to the Duty Free City, leaving on the hour! I would like to give you a suggestion, it is best to rent a car near the airport, and it is convenient and affordable to drive to the surrounding attractions by yourself! And most importantly, remember to wear sunscreen! Don't be afraid of tanning, but be afraid of sunburn!

Happy hour afternoon tea is not a problem. There is wine and meat. There is a queue, and there are much fewer breakfast people than the one in Building 3.
The housekeeper, nada, contacted us and added WeChat to ask us what our needs were, and we met them all. When we checked in, he drove us around in a small car and introduced the whole hotel. Afterwards, we would follow up the needs every day and gave the children dolls, schoolbags and shells. Necklace and 2 times of fruit, the children have gained a lot, give nada a thumbs up! nada arranged the top floor 1719, the ice machine is at the door, and the swimming pool is just a little walk to the first floor. The basic room originally booked for the next 2 days was also extended to the original room.
The hotel environment is okay. The main swimming pool is not very big, but it is very bright. The small swimming pool next to it closes at 7 o'clock. I haven't played in 3 days. The children's water slide area is too old. It needs to be renovated, and climbing the stairs is too much The feet are hot, and the plastic floor is worn out and too sticky, and you have to run on it, so the baby doesn't want to play after playing a few times.
Some children's projects need to be reserved in advance. The first one participated in the magic. It was a real surprise for an hour. The children had a great time. The karts in Xiangzhen Garden are fun, and there is more a**osphere at night.
The hotel park is very suitable for vacation, and I will bring my family to play next time.

msg:During the one-week trip to Sanya, starting from entering this hotel in the second half of the trip, it was a trip that added to the congestion. It turned out that the lack of service and poor service in the bad reviews really did not wrong your family at all. It's a pity that I still took my friends with me. You need a disposable wooden comb from morning to night. The worst house has a corridor door. When the corridor door is closed, you have to ask someone to open the door. The sound insulation of the house is terrible. The outside is a playground. The music was played late, and there was a water leak inside, who would believe it! The room at 1500 yuan a night leaked water. If you ask me why I didn’t ask the front desk to deal with it, because the wooden comb and the door opening incident made me no longer want to contact the front desk. If I hadn’t paid for the house for three days first, I wouldn’t want to live for a day. And this house was upgraded for me, because when I checked in, because of your dereliction of duty, the two of us couldn't live together. It seems that the upgrade and coordination for me is to arrange the most end of the same floor and find a leaky house Add to my troubles, the sea in Sanya makes people miss, and Shangri-La's service is hard to describe

The service was very meticulous. The beach water in the hotel area is very clean and there are few people, and there are various sea recreation projects. The room inside the hotel is very comfortable. There is a sofa that can be turned into a bed, which is suitable for families with children. You must book a room with breakfast when you stay here. The hotel has a very rich breakfast, and it doesn't close until 10:30. The hotel's supporting facilities are extremely suitable for parent-child family trips, and the organized activities and children's playground facilities are very complete. In addition, there is a Haitang Bay 68 food court about one kilometer next to the hotel. The restaurants in it are very comprehensive and affordable.

The housekeeper Nada contacted me one day in advance, and said that there were children, so I prepared a fence in advance. This fence is really helpful I am very busy, don't worry about the children, adults can rest assured to sleep. The sofa bed can also be opened, so the family of three should not sleep too comfortably.
The hotel lobby is open and a bit hot, but the decoration and the surrounding coconut trees are very distinctive. After entering the room, the building is very cool. The hotel's parent-child program is really suitable for children. This time I experienced the small train and go-kart. The water park twice a day is very fun. The indoor big park depends on whether the package is included. If it is not included, you can only play pictures. This little playground and toy area. The hotel's breakfast is also great, especially seafood porridge and egg burritos. It is enough for beach children to dig sand and tread water, the sand is very soft and fine. After checking out, I found that something was left behind, and the housekeeper Nada was also very enthusiastic to help find it👍🏻

It’s good to take the children to walk on the sea water after breakfast every day. The service staff will greet you friendly when they meet on the road. The breakfast buffet has small portions of food for children, which is very considerate. It’s a bit stingy to pay extra for the naughty castle. Other Yalong Bay hotels I’ve stayed at are free to play. Overall, it’s good and worth staying in

The room I arranged was comfortable and spacious, with a sweeping view of the sea view. The children were so happy. The hotel is very close to the beach and the sand is soft. We go to the beach to play almost every day. It is recommended to go around 5 pm, when the beach is already cool and comfortable. After 7 o'clock in the evening, the children almost soak in the swimming pool and refuse to come out 😄 The hotel's breakfast is quite rich, and there are complementary foods for babies after half a year old, which are delicious.

msg:Room: We stayed in 3 hotels in Sanya this time, and Shangri-La is the most cost-effective one! If you are traveling as a family, book a double bed room, which includes a 1.5 sofa bed. The sofa bed can sleep two people no problem! The Horizon Club is really great. In Building 1, there is an independent dining space. There are battery cars in the hotel to pick up and drop off at any time. Especially the afternoon tea and happy hour are amazing! All three meals a day will be provided in the hotel! Living in Haitang Bay is mainly to bring children to the hotel, because there are so many activities inside that you can’t even stay for two nights! Next time I come to Sanya, I will continue to book here.

Service: The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. The housekeeper added WeChat one day in advance to send the parent-child activity list. When we arrived at the hotel, she would wait for us at the hotel in advance to help us check in and explain the parent-child activities! Because several activities were full, the housekeeper Jennie also gave us an adventure park. It was so considerate. The activities were arranged properly!
There is another bright spot: it is the hotel's own car to go to the duty-free shop, so it doesn't stop halfway and goes straight to the duty-free shop!

Environment: Horizon Club Ocean View Double Room has a very beautiful view and a large lawn, where some parent-child activities will be organized. The water world, swimming pool, etc. are all very convenient to enter and exit from the hotel.

Breakfast: The breakfast tastes better! If you want more variety, go to the lobby to eat, but there are too many people and it is not quiet, and you may queue up during peak hours. If you want to be quiet, you can eat directly on the first floor of the Horizon Club. There are few types of dishes but relatively delicate dishes.

msg:On the afternoon of June 28th, in the swimming pool of Shangri-La Resort, Haitang Bay, Sanya, an 8-year-old child was playing on a water slide. The child did not know the danger of the retrograde water slide, but the two retrograde workers did not stop it in time and effectively, but blew a whistle next to it. The child didn't know what was going on. The first time the retrograde was not stopped, the second time the retrograde was continued and the upper half of the water slide was still unstopped, resulting in the fall of two permanent incisors. The follow-up would be long and expensive. dental trea**ent costs. The hotel only agrees to assist in the reimbursement process of commercial insurance, but commercial insurance can only be used for basic medical reimbursement, and the hospital said that the trea**ent and restoration of dental crowns will last until the age of 18, and the cost of dental crown restoration is as high as 100,000, which is not covered by commercial insurance. It is equivalent to that Haitang Bay Shangri-La Hotel does not bear any expenses. What we have to face is the long road to medical trea**ent in the next 10 years and medical expenses of up to hundreds of thousands. The expensive expenses make our family with two children and only one source of income from a part-time job even worse. . During the communication process, we did not speak harshly when the child was present, but Shangri-La Resort, Haitang Bay, Sanya avoided the important, with a frivolous attitude, and implied that they were not afraid of complaints. Even if we complained to 12315, we would only deal with it according to the conditions issued by the hotel. We require the hotel to compensate all the trea**ent costs in one lump sum.

msg:This time, I came to Sanya just before the summer vacation. I took my children and old mother with me. After looking at a few hotels, I chose Shangri-La, which has always had a good reputation. Facts have proved that there is no wrong choice haha.
The room is a premium sea view room, a 2-meter big bed and a sofa bed are enough for us to take care of the elderly and children. One day before arriving at the store, the hotel called and asked the housekeeper Fannie to add WeChat. She was very attentive. They also gave us a three-day breakfast for adults, which is very good.
It’s a bit embarrassing to have to trouble Fannie every day for the past few nights. The key is that Fannie is considerate and considerate. The hotel will ask politely every day, and the parent-child activities will be notified in advance before making an appoin**ent for us. They will also ask if the toiletries and drinks in the room need to be replenished every day. Made our family feel very kind, especially thanks to her!
Here is a warm thing in particular. The day before, because the old mother accidentally cut a small foot, she passed the front desk and asked for a Band-Aid. Unexpectedly, the hotel staff called the room at night to ask if there was any injury. After explaining the situation, they sent iodophor and band Aid. This thing is really touching.
The hardware is also quite clean. There are more clothes hangers and mosquito repellent in the room, and the decoration is also very new. Let me say here that the cleaning lady is very amiable, and she will ask politely when cleaning any place.
To sum up, the four-day and three-night stay was great. It can be seen that Shangri-La has been adhering to the hotel's service philosophy and is constantly improving. It pays great attention to the customer's personal experience. Children play with care, even if the swimming pool is a rotating water slide. There is also a staff member for each, which is in place.
I hope that next time I have the opportunity to come to Sanya, I will choose Shangri-La again.

msg:I have lived in Shangri-La in several cities, but the hotel in Sanya still feels better. The old five-star hotel occupies a really large area! The big lawn is really nice. The environment is not top-notch in Haitang Bay, but Shangri-La's top-notch service is there, especially the butler Refat's service is very considerate and meticulous. After check-in, we were sent all the way to the guest room, added Wechat communication, sent a fruit plate and red wine, and sent messages many times during the two days of check-in to ask if there is any need for help and service, which is great! There is no off-season in Sanya now. Breakfast needs to be lined up, but the time is 3-5 minutes. The hotel met my expectations!

Listening to the sea breeze, you don’t want to go out when you hide in the room. There are many parent-child activity parks here, you can bring your children with you next time. The executive courtesy of the Horizon Club can almost cover three meals a day, and the taste is also very good. There are many kinds, and it is very pleasant to drink some wine in the garden in the evening. Shangri-La's travel photographers are patient and skilled.

Tell me, I like Hainan so much, I don't want to go back...

I live in a parent-child room. There is a small yard on the first floor with a slide inside. The baby is very happy~ Although the decoration style is a bit old, the hardware facilities are still good. The bath water is very large and comfortable~ The sofa bed is big, but there is no guardrail. If the baby is small, it is not bad to lay a pillow to block it~
The service of the hotel itself is also very good ~ there will be a staff member after check-in
Home service, Lucy will tell me every day what activities are going on today ~ what catering information is available ~ will also remind the next two to bring umbrellas in time ~ if we have any needs, just send her a message ~ save calling the front desk, suitable for social fear ~Other service staff I met were also very enthusiastic~
The breakfast is also very rich and varied. We brought the elderly with us and expressed our satisfaction~ We will choose Shangri-La again when we come to Hainan next year~

Encountered countless times. I gave it full marks last time. I was very disappointed this time. Shangri-La's reception of Linda was so unprofessional. She didn't understand anything and didn't reply to messages. The food is not as sumptuous as last time, maybe there are fewer people this time as a sign of understanding. The playground is suitable for older children~

msg:I spent three days of pleasant time in Sanya Shangri-La with the elderly and children. Thanks to Stella for the warm and thoughtful service, and detailed introduction of hotel facilities and services. The children's water park is my daughter's favorite. There are spiral water slides for adults and children. You can play, and the activities in the indoor playground are also very rich. This time I stayed in the Horizon Club King Room, the bedding is comfortable, the equipment is from L’Occitane, and the happy hour in the lounge provided is of good quality, which can completely solve the dinner. Breakfast can be served in the lounge or at the cooking stage restaurant in the main building. The dishes there are delicious Richer. Among the hotels in Haitang Bay, Shangri-La is a low-key existence, but it is old and strong, and the service is online. It is especially suitable for staying with the elderly and children. The experience exceeds expectations. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Shangri-La!

The room was clean and new, and the cleaning was very careful. The environment of the hotel is super beautiful. Children have played on the big slide many times. The service and installation guarantee are in place. The water slide is in charge of a special person, and the slide in the children's playground is also checked by someone to see if each child slides down safely. There are so many children's activities to choose from. If I live next time, I will choose Shangri-La

msg:The first two times I came to Sanya, I lived in Yalong Bay, and this time I lived in Haitang Bay for the first time. I don't know if it's a common problem of Begonia Hotel. The Shangri-La and Grand Hyatt I stayed in didn't work for breakfast.
Highlights: The children's swimming pool is good, the children have been playing for a day, and they are tanned into chocolate. Some areas are covered with sunshades, so as not to be exposed to the sun without blind spots.
For lawn karts, one room can be driven for five minutes. Children also like it very much.
Disadvantages: There are too many disadvantages. Say it one by one.
1 It is mainly a parent-child hotel, but the indoor playground requires a fee. It is said that the playground is actually a few big slides, and it costs 150 yuan. There are also free to play, a very small room, only suitable for young babies.
2 There are few types of breakfast, and the taste is not good.
3 Smell from the toilet sewer. The toilet door was closed all morning and then opened again, the smell was really strong.
4 beds have sound. There will be a sound when the movement is slightly louder. Doubt the bed was broken.
Summary: The above questions were not fed back to the hotel during the stay, because I thought I only booked for two nights, so I just passed it. My current feeling is that fortunately, I only booked two nights, so I only lost two nights. As an old five-star hotel, the actual service and facilities are only in the four-star range, not a five-star luxury hotel, and will not stay again, and will be on the demining list of my relatives and friends.
Post two photos of highlights.

But the best thing is the butler service. Our butler GAGA has arranged for us clearly and responsively from the day before check-in. It is really different from the feeling of staying in other hotels without butler service before. Really special thanks to GAGA, one hundred likes!

I booked a Horizon Club sea view room. To be honest, I couldn’t see the sea at all. The butler told me that maybe the trees were growing. It's too high. The other side of the key tree is the swimming pool and not the sea. If that's the case, I might as well book a garden room that's a few hundred cheaper. It's really speechless. The room is very old and not good at first glance. It's too old. I checked out the next day. Why can you see the sea in sea view rooms booked in other hotels? It is not recommended for anyone other than children to play.

        First, the room and bathroom are very large. The 2-meter bed is enough for our family to sleep in. There is also a sofa bed. The small tent on the sofa bed is the favorite of the children. Two babies are fighting to sleep! There are also sand digging toys in the room.
        Second, the hotel doll interaction, the small train in the park, the children's pool, the children's playground and various courses are also favorites of babies, especially the swimming pool, the water is very clean, and there is a service point next to it, which is convenient for getting bath towels, so you don't have to worry about your baby catching a cold!
        Third, the hotel has a rich breakfast, and there is also a special children's self-service area. Children can watch cartoons while eating, and adults can have breakfast with peace of mind.
        Parent-child hotels focus on details, including children's toilet seats, footstools, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Thanks to Bruce Liu for the 2 shark schoolbags, the baby likes it very much, and has been carrying it when going out to play these days.
        Thanks again to Butler Liu for helping to send back the low-protein food left in the hotel refrigerator 🙏🙏🙏

I regretted booking a garden view room. The room is small and low. It feels like staying in a guest house. I can’t change rooms when there are business meetings between two big companies. ． , can only make do with two nights

Fortunately, the guest relations director, refat, is very considerate. During the stay, he provided one-on-one service and cared about my needs. He gave the service five stars.

"Xi" restaurant is not bad👍

Personal experience The hotel is suitable for family trips, not for those who want to stay in a quiet hotel

msg:In the second half of March, the room was full. Fortunately, it was booked in advance. In fact, there are not many children, but there are many company meetings. Recommend the Horizon Club room to solve half of the meals. Catering Thai food is okay and tastes good, Chinese food is average, and the price/performance ratio of barbecue buffet is average.
The fun is not bad, there are two big water slides, the swimming pool is very clean, the deepest is 1 meter, it is not friendly to adults 😄, the electronic floating children love to play (98 yuan/15 minutes), the popsicles on the side are very good Eat, pure fruit, 35, 40 sticks.
The large lawn is well maintained, and there are various activities, such as go-karts, Frisbee, bubble shows, etc. are free. There is also an activity center for adults and older kids with balance beams, rock climbing, zip lining, archery, shooting and more.
The room is indeed quite old, the so-called old cadre style, but compared with the five-star hotels in Yalong Bay, it is not that much worse, at least there are electric curtains 😄
The overall cost performance is very high.

A bit of complaint: The indoor slide is charged separately, so no one is playing it😄

msg:I came to Haikou on a business trip, and went to Sanya to lie down for two days. Unfortunately, the hotels I used to stay in before were all full, and I wanted to live in Haitang Bay, so I paid attention to Shangri-La. I read the profile online and thought it was okay. Holding Try it out and book an evening.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is near the Haitang Duty Free Shop. It is very convenient to drive by car. The parking lot is quite large, and there are places on the ground and underground. It is recommended to park underground. In this weather, it is quite a pain to park above.

Rumu Chunfeng's service is my first impression. The lady at the front desk, Hedy, is very reliable. Although the room booked from the platform, the service is also careful and thoughtful. The introduction of the hotel, the location of various facilities, meals and activities are very detailed. , the feeling is still very good!

The hotel is large, with complete facilities, and the room is very clean. You can see the sea view from the room, which is quite pleasant. On the first day, the swimming pool was under the room, and music was playing, which felt very good. There have been a lot of meetings recently, and the hotel is basically in the state of inspection. Originally planned to stay for one day, an extra night was added. But it's a pity that the room on the second day was not as good as the first day, which was a bit embarrassing. I wasn't in the store when I changed rooms the next day. Hedy helped coordinate very well, the luggage was transferred, and the laundry was also delivered to the new room, so you don't have to worry about it at all. I really like this!

During this period, there was a small episode. There was a meeting on the second night, and many participants arrived at the store late, and the voices in the elevator room and the corridor were loud and noisy. The guests at the opposite door opened the door and yelled twice, and this happened one after another. Later, I contacted Hedy, hoping to help coordinate the meeting. It turned out that the effect was much better. Someone should start to remind me in the elevator, and the problem was solved.

The quality of the bedding and equipment is good, and I slept very well. Although the schedule is very tight and tiring, Shangri-La is still a very good choice for taking a break from the busy schedule to relax. Gym, swimming pool, food quality are very good. There is also a gift certificate for cdf activities, which is very good!

There are plans to go to Sanya in a while, Shangri-La is still a resort hotel that can be considered, and I am very satisfied overall.

Environment: The overall environment of the hotel feels very good, the garden landscaping is beautiful, and the entertainment facilities are very safe. There is a children's pool and two adult pools.

Service: Special thanks to Ms. NINA LI, the housekeeper at the front desk of the hotel. She is very enthusiastic and solves the problem very quickly. She will communicate with me about my needs before check-in. She is very patient. Like it.

It was indeed like a responsible "housekeeper" so that I had no worries during the check-in period, and I was able to make delays according to my special circumstances. A lot of help with check out.

Breakfast is served in the Horizon Club. There are few people and the environment is good. The food is exquisite and worthy of the five-star standard.
I have been to the beach a few times, the wind and waves are a bit too big for going into the sea, but the photos are still very good.

Service: The waiters will greet and say hello when they see it, which makes people feel friendly and not overly attentive.
Facilities: The hotel focuses on the Southeast Asian style of Thailand. Although the facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained and show traces of time.

Environment: A typical resort with a happy a**osphere everywhere. The hotel focuses on parent-child style. Children can always find their favorite items here, or they can spend a whole day in the water amusement park without doing anything.

msg:The worst thing about our National Day trip was staying here. It cost three times the price during the National Day. The service was ice dew, not even Nongfu Spring, and the service was basically non-existent. The most exaggerated garden party was where the children wanted to interact with the doll characters. The waiter came up and directly said, "Maybe there is no interaction or communication on the other side of the dinner. I will not stay again. I spent the money of a five-star hotel and enjoyed the service that is not as good as that of a fast hotel. My travel mood fell to the bottom." It also delayed my later schedule. In the first half of the night, I was busy closing the door to drive away mosquitoes, and in the second half of the night, I was busy opening the door to disperse the smell. I didn't sleep all night. Wouldn't stay again.

On the contrary, I quite like it. The service is also very good. The children's playground is very fun, and the Bubble Kids at night also had a great time. The experience is full. The small train is also free, the only fly in the oin**ent is that the swimming pool slides are under maintenance, so I didn't get to play. And I was not bitten by mosquitoes at all in Shangri-La, this is really good! Thanks to Rachel for her help, her patience and enthusiasm made my trip extra smooth!

msg:Facilities: Although it is old, it is not old, and it is well maintained. The swimming pool is the favorite of my three children, and the temperature is very good. The little train also has to ride three or four times a day, which is quite addictive!
Hygiene: The room is quite clean, there is no dust under the bed, and the room attendant in 5519 works very quickly.
Environment: The environment is quite good. The a**osphere is very good.
Service: I would like to praise Ms. GaGa from the guest relations depar**ent. I learned that we are two people with three children, and they have been waiting for us at the door. Seeing us holding the sleeping child, we actively coordinated the room to check in in advance. We went into the room to arrange a series of matters, and learned that the two children were drinking milk powder and mineral water were delivered by a dozen. This was the beginning of my good impression of Shangri-La. The mood is good, and it is very good to see the scenery of Shangri-La.
Family sofa bed: We have very high requirements for room types when we live in a hotel for two or three years. The expandable family sofa bed is a great help. This is one of the reasons for choosing Shangri-La in the first place.

msg:I returned home with reluctance. Although the journey was exhausting, I still had to write a thumbs up for this hotel and the spring-like service. Objectively speaking, the hotel is not big, and the hardware is not new, but in terms of the price-performance ratio for parents and children and the humanistic care of the service, the experience is very good. Before we checked in, the butler, Xiao Lin, a handsome guy, took the initiative to contact us in advance. Every time I needed to send him a WeChat message, I found that his message had already arrived. He was really considerate, including luggage pick-up and drop-off. Because we are four seniors and one small, there are two 70-year-olds and a boy who just turned 3 years old. Because of the delay due to the waiting time during peak hours, Manager Xiaolin and Xiaoyu apologized repeatedly and specially upgraded us to a suite. They presented very warm parent-child gifts, fresh welcome fruits, and even straw hats of various styles were prepared for us in the room. Because children like to sweat in the middle of the night, they asked the hotel to send a separate quilt cover, and the attitude of the hotel is very good. Saturday is the child’s birthday again. After Xiao Lin knew about it, we specially customized the hotel’s birthday cake. We went out that day and waited until we came back at 8:30 in the evening. The cake was very fresh and full of fruits. It’s not greasy at all. . The hotel's breakfast also has a children's exclusive area for children, and the amu*****t park is also very good, and there will be no separate charges. In short, the parent-child experience at Sanya Shangri-La Hotel this time is more worthwhile, and it is strongly Amway (ღ˘⌣˘ღ)

msg:Compared with the sea in Yalong Bay, Haitang Bay is very windy and turbulent. The waves follow one after another, and the sea breeze is also very strong. It is more suitable for playing rides here.

Room facilities:
The room is not too big, with a sofa 🛏, 🛁, and a balcony. The hot water comes out quickly, and it is very convenient to take a bath and add hot water. The overall facilities are in good condition without feeling old.
The hotel has 5 buildings, and the housing distribution is relatively scattered. Loohoo Paradise is in an independent building.

Landscape facilities:
🌿There are two lawns, and the place where the house just came out is a huge lawn, which is very suitable for taking pictures. There is a small lawn near the seaside. When I went there, the big lawn was under maintenance, and the activities were changed to the small lawn.
🏊🏻The swimming pool is very large, and the layout is also very distinctive, with arch bridges, infinity pools, and jacuzzi pools.
👶🏻Children's play pool, there are two large slides, the amu*****t facility in the middle is a smaller baby, the water is very shallow, if the temperature is not high and there is wind, it will be a bit cold. There will be bubble baths at event time.
🏖️There is a piece of beach built by the hotel itself, and the area is quite large. Maybe because of the off-season on the tenth day of March, no one was playing inside.

Serve:
Before check-in, the housekeeper will communicate with you, and after check-in, you will be reminded of the inquiry methods and reservation methods for various items. There seem to be many kinds of items to play, but most of them are very simple activities, such as rock climbing 🧗‍♀️, horse riding 🐴, little engineers (making models together), magic theater (teaching children a few simple magic tricks), etc.
🎈When calling the service desk at night, there will be cases where the call is not answered, which has not been encountered in other hotels.

breakfast:
It is very rich and can be regarded as the upper-middle level. There are many places, and I have not encountered a situation where there is no place for two days. There is an area for younger children, where the food is all in super small portions, and there are baby tables and cartoons.

The breakfast and buffet at Cooking Stage are great, and dinner at the steakhouse is good too. The water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool can be used happily even in winter, which is the favorite of children. The beautiful beach is a must-see every day. Fortunately, the weather was good for six days, and it was a very enjoyable vacation. I go to the gym every day to exercise for a while, and I also borrowed the yoga mat to do a beautiful standing wheel on the beach, fulfilling a small wish. It is particularly worth mentioning that there is butler service this time. The beautiful butler Gaga has followed up the service every day since check-in. She is very considerate, communicates in a timely manner, and even gave us small gifts and various small surprises. A perfect holiday with a great experience.

msg:It was the first time I went to Haitang Bay, and I chose Shangri-La. From a personal point of view, I am very satisfied with the parent-child attributes, high cost performance, value for money, and efficient service. I stayed at 4D3N.
I stayed in March, because I had the choice of bringing 2 adults and 1 child, 3 adults + 1 toddler, and the room type was rather awkward. After choosing and choosing, I think that every room in Shangri-La is equipped with a sofa bed is the most suitable for me. This kind of occupancy needs. The room decoration of the Horizon Club is not luxurious, but it is well maintained. The hot water is very hot, the sea view on the upper floor, and the garden downstairs. For non-professional hotel players, they are already very satisfied!
The hotel focuses on parent-child activities, and almost all of them are free, ranging from small trains and mushroom ponds for young children, to ziplines and horseback riding for older children. And every evening there will be parent-child games suitable for young children.
The hotel's breakfast and executive meals are not bad. They can't be said to be exquisite, but the choices are very rich. It won't be annoying to eat for 2 to 3 days. Of course, there are many people who eat breakfast.
At the end, I would like to praise Shangri-La's butler service. Phoebe Yu is my reception butler this time. I called early on the day of check-in to confirm the arrival time. During the few days in the hotel, information and targeted services were provided in many ways. It gives me the feeling that it is professional → able to grasp information points and understand the core demands of customers. Efficient → As long as you say something, even if the occupancy rate is still high, it will be implemented quickly. Flexible → Provided assistance for our check-in and late check-out when the room status allowed. With such a butler (team), I still have great confidence in Shangri-La!
In short, satisfied, recommended

I took the initiative to send the shuttle bus schedule to and from the duty-free shop, and recommended places to eat in and around the hotel. The hotel is worthy of being a parent-child hotel. There is a play area for babies, and there is also a baby area for breakfast. Unfortunately, we don't have children, but I still took a sweet potato mash from there and found out that it is baby sweet potato food! There is no smell, it’s really a baby😂 Immediately Amway has a girlfriend with a child🤭 It’s a sense of accomplishment to grab the snacks in the baby area these two days😁

The day before the check-in, the housekeeper Louis XIII added WeChat to inform us of various event information and hotel overview in advance, which is convenient for planning the itinerary in advance. Because we reserved a helicopter in the afternoon, the housekeeper also specially helped to prepare the room in advance, and the location of the room is also excellent, especially good. There are also service staff at the front desk, guest room, restaurant, and concierge. After staying for 2 days, they helped to solve all kinds of problems, big and small. Thank you very much. The beach in Haitang Bay is very windy and waves, and it is impossible to get into the sea, but it is also a different experience for children, and digging sand is still very fun. There are also swimming pools in the hotel and children's water slides, bubble shows, small trains, go-karts, etc., and played a lot. The dining in the Horizon Club is also very good. I have experienced it in various time periods. In addition, the Xi restaurant on the first floor is a bit expensive, but the taste is really good. If you want to make any comments, it would be better to have a place where you can rush your feet immediately at the entrance and exit of the beach! Overall, a very good stay experience, next time you come to Haitang Bay, you should still choose the Horizon Club of Shangri-La.

She was considerate and thoughtful from the time we checked in at the store to the follow-up of various service details. Considering that guests come and go every day, it is not easy to follow up and meet the needs of guests in a personalized way. Staying in the Horizon Club, you can enjoy the buffet in two restaurants, each with its own characteristics, which you can like. The swimming pool is also heated. Even in early March, it is suitable for entering the water. The toiletries in the room are L'Occitane suits, which are elegant and fresh. Although Shangri-La Hotel is not an upstart hotel, the exterior and interior decoration style is relatively classic, and my family and I also like the unique aroma wafting in the Shangri-La space.

msg:very good! The housekeeper Wendy is very nice! The hotel has a lot of activities. I rented a car for a week. I didn’t have time to go out a few days ago. I just played in the hotel for a few days. Hahaha, I have everything my child likes. I didn’t go to the water world next door. I went to the next door to see the aquarium The museum took a photo. The water slide in the hotel is enough for children to play without queuing up. There are few people on the private beach. Just look at the photos. My colleagues thought I went abroad to play... Shooting in the park, zipline, Helicopters 🚁 are all very good~ I don’t have time to make helicopters... save it for next time!

msg:Shangri-La will never let me down, the hotel adheres to the consistent style of Shangri-La, even the fragrance is the same. The rooms in the Horizon Club are big enough, and the sea view is far away from the sea, which is better than nothing. The hotel has a lot of swimming pools, which is particularly resort-like. The children's center is also very good, and it is free during the Chinese New Year. There is a bonfire at night, and there are people singing over the self-service barbecue, so I feel very relaxed. The hotel's public beach is very clean, and the hotel has its own sea-viewing platform with a particularly nice view. The breakfast and happy hour in the Horizon Club are of good quality, but there are too few types, and there are many people during the Chinese New Year, but they are not particularly noisy. The little sister Hedy at the front desk added WeChat and sent me service information every day. Finally, she gave us a gift before leaving . In short, Sanya Shangri-La is a hotel that I would like to come back to again.

There are private beaches, swimming pools, children's water play, water world and aquarium within walking distance. It is also very convenient to eat at 68 Food City within two kilometers.

It’s good to choose Shangri-La with children. The staff are very enthusiastic. I would like to thank Ms. Vera from the guest relations depar**ent of the hotel. Before we left, we added WeChat to ask about our needs. We met, and the young lady also helped to upgrade the sea view room for free. During the few days of stay, there were various cares and help. Here I sincerely thank her❤️, next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Shangri-La💯

The second reason, which is the most important reason, is that the service is so... good! ! Especially the housekeeper GAGA saw that we were regular customers and brought children with him, so he upgraded us to a sea view room for free, and specially asked the housekeeping depar**ent to decorate the room very warmly. Everyone I know voted for GAGA😁😁😁Because of GAGA, I already have a deep relationship with Shangri-La. GAGA is like my family in Sanya. Thank you for letting me feel more warmth and touch during the beautiful journey🥹🥹🥹

The service was very slow. I arrived at 8:30 that night and said that the bed would be made, but no one contacted me at 11:00. Only after I contacted again did someone come to make the bed. The room was not cleaned until the afternoon of the next day. I called and said that it would be cleaned after 4 pm. If necessary, it could be cleaned earlier. I was speechless. .
The children's swimming pool is good, bath towels are free to use, the changing room is close, 98 yuan for ten minutes of water boating, our second child's own swimming ring saves a lot of money.
The breakfast is very rich and delicious
The dinner buffet is not worth the price, and the a la carte is also good. The Hainanese chicken rice is very good. Everything is good except expensive, all three days will be settled in the Chinese restaurant downstairs

msg:Bring your baby to Sanya for a vacation and stay in Shangri-La for 2 days and Yanlord for 2 days. The price of Yanlord is high, the sea view is invincible and there are many activities, but Shangri-La, as an old-fashioned parent-child hotel, is also worth the money. Because I have two children and I am old, so the room type is not very easy to choose. The price of the family room is high in the peak season, but the big bed room in Shangri-La is very good. It is still very large with a sofa bed of 1.5*2 meters. The extra beds that Heng spends money on are all big, which is very suitable for families with 2 children. The Horizon Club room has executive benefits, and it is also the building closest to the sea, but the sea view here is mediocre, and it is not close enough even if there are trees blocking it. It is incomparable with Yanlord's invincible sea view. The executive lounge is also relatively small, and there is basically nothing for afternoon tea. , Breakfast and happy hour in the evening can be full. On the last day, I went to the main restaurant for breakfast and found that there are many types, but there are also many people. Children's activities are more suitable for younger children. The cooking skills for the second day have not been fixed, so there is no experience, but the outdoor activity area here is very good. There are zipline shooting, etc., which can be experienced every day, and there is also a small zoo. There is an indoor playground although there are devil slides but the space is not very large. The most commendable thing is that the swimming pools here are all at a constant temperature, so our main activities are swimming in the swimming pool and digging sand by the sea (it’s a pity that there are no sand digging tools here. Although there are many outdoor swimming pools in Yanlord later, they are not except for children’s pools. Constant temperature, almost no one when it is cold). The garden landscape is very good, the big lawn is very nice, very quiet, and there are also battery cars for transportation at any time, the overall feeling is worth recommending. In addition, the housekeeper GAGA added WeChat the day before check-in, the whole service is very good, thank you!

msg:Bring the elderly and children to play, because Sanya has become so popular in an instant, you may have to queue up for check-in. The suite booked for the elderly was delayed by an hour due to the late check-out of the previous guests, but the butler GAGA is very responsible and has been actively communicating, and gave the Horizon Club trea**ent to another double bed room, so that the family can share it every afternoon Afternoon tea was nice. Shangri-La's food is really good and rich, very suitable for the elderly and children to stay. Because I stayed for 5 days, the housekeeper GAGA has always cared about it. The recommended Fenghuangling has a beautiful view with few tourists. The cable car can overlook the panoramic view of Sanya. The elderly like it very much. The housekeeper was also worried that the children and the elderly would not have enough drinking water, so he simply brought a box of water, added another fruit plate, and gave three small gifts to the children before leaving. It feels very sweet. The Ocean Building, Building 1, where I live is close to the sea and slightly far from the lobby. Breakfast can be downstairs or go to the main building. The breakfast in the main building is richer. There are many tourists recently, and there is basically no queue before 8 o'clock, and you may need to queue after 8 o'clock. The hotel swimming pool is relatively shallow, with facilities such as large slides, which children like very much. Walking to the beach, digging sand and picking shells can also play for a while. The environment is very comfortable, and I feel good even if I stay out of the hotel and inhale oxygen. Close to Atlantis, 1.4 kilometers away, there is 68 Haitang Food City, many choices, door-to-door pick-up.

There is also a large outdoor heated swimming pool, 1.1 meters deep. There is also a great children's playground, which has 3 sets of large slides, and the devil's slide. The children are crazy and slide over and over again. (Free before 2.5). The hotel also has an oversized lawn that is also great. There is a children's inflatable fort on the lawn. Unfortunately, there is a time limit and it doesn't work every time. The overall environment is still great. Especially in the season when the weather is cold and not suitable for going into the water, it is definitely the first choice if you want to take your children to play in the water.

msg:Advantages: 1. There are many activities for children to play, and all outdoor swimming pools are constant temperature, so swimming in winter is not afraid. Swimming boosters can be rented at the swimming pool, 98 yuan/15 minutes. Children's video game city, small train, small zoo, climbing wall, moon car, carts, etc. are available. There are a lot of parent-child activities every day, but you need to make an appoin**ent two days in advance, otherwise you won't be able to arrange them.
As a parent-child hotel, I will still give a 5-star rating, because the children really like it and have fun.
2. The breakfast is rich and satisfying for picky people.
3. The hotel is green and the beach is very good. It is beautiful to take any photo.
4. The butler service is very good. LOUIS XIII Yang is very caring. He will greet you every day and provide you with various kinds of help in time.
Disadvantages: 1. The hotel lobby is stingy and not deep enough. A few chairs are pressed, which is the so-called lobby bar, which lowers the overall level of the hotel. Drinking at night is completely intimidating.
2. The room decoration facilities are also very general, but there are beach bags and sun hats for guests, which is very considerate. The hair dryer is stuck inside the cabinet, and you have to press a small button to get the air out. For women with long hair, it is very unfriendly to dry their hair. If you want to pull it up and blow it from the top of your head, you can't even pull it up. It is completely against the power of the wire.

Outdoor children's constant temperature water park, two-color spiral water slide! The swimming pool is really nice! The temperature is constant, the weather is cooler, but the water temperature is very good! Children especially like it! !
Very caring, parent-child hotel, many details are very warm! The room is spacious, new bathrobes are prepared every day, and a lot of mineral water is given, which is very detailed.
I went to the front desk and told us to give us a better view, and we were given room 3633. The view is so good!
It's New Year's Eve! The fireworks are very beautiful! The room is just the best place to watch the fireworks! The scenery during the day is also not good!
Children's favorite is the little train, unlimited rides every day! There is also a beach, the sand is soft and clean! so comfortable
Pool service 👍! You don’t need to bring anything, it feels like you don’t need to bring luggage, just lie down and play! The housekeeper, LOUIS XIII Yang, responded in a timely manner, and the service is also very good

There are many parent-child programs, and the breakfast is rich, in line with the quality of this price hotel. The seafood hot pot buffet is recommended for dinner. The housekeeper, Nina, is very considerate and helped to coordinate the intimate details in the process. It was a very pleasant journey. There is another choice in Sanya, and I will come again next time.

msg:Service: Attentive service, I called before check-in to find out what I needed, I praised the housekeeper, Nina Li, for being warm and courteous, the service was especially excellent, after check-out, I was still concerned about our itinerary, I have a small problem, that is, I forgot to provide the room when I checked-in Paper towels, I waited for a long time and made two phone calls to deliver them, and I can do better~

Facilities: An old-fashioned hotel, the facilities are a bit serious.

Environment: The environment is tropical rainforest. There are a lot of artificial beaches with coconut trees, rockery scenery and large grasslands in the park. It is very suitable to take children to visit the hotel. The weather in January is 24.5 degrees, and the water in the normal temperature swimming pool is slightly cold, but the constant temperature swimming pool is a plus, it is very warm in the water. The swimming pool is divided into a children's play area and an adult swimming area. The temperature of the water is also very suitable. It is very comfortable to provide heated bath towels. It is the feeling that the pool service staff is not very familiar with the business. I asked two people if they provided swimming rings and they said no. Later I only know that I can borrow it after asking tourists, but it has already been borrowed, and we have not been able to use it, hoping to improve it.
The breakfast is very rich. I haven’t eaten enough Hainan noodles for three days 😄
During the three days we stayed here, there seemed to be some activities. The lawn was full of lights and voices on the lawn for three nights, and it stopped around eight o'clock. It would disturb tourists who want to rest and be quiet. In addition, the children's play area is charged, and the small train cannot be used for free. There are many free activities for children, some need to be reserved one day in advance, we did not participate. There is no private beach, no beach chairs, and the tidal flat area is not large. It is not suitable for those who want to empty the beach.
Generally speaking, it is suitable for those who do not want to go out with children and want to browse the hotel, and the hotel can basically meet the needs of taking children to have fun.

msg:Changed from Mandarin Oriental to Shangri-La for two nights
Really very surprising!
I feel that I must write a review and share it with those in need (because I also read a bunch of reviews before finally choosing here)
1. The butler *Phoebe Xiaoyu* contacted me in advance and sent a special car pick-up service to pick us up from MO, an hour's drive away.
2. When the car arrived, the butler was waiting for us at the entrance of the lobby, and prepared a small shark schoolbag for the children, which my baby liked very much.
3. The hotel's parent-child facilities and activities are rich and colorful. There are heated swimming pools for adults and children, indoor amu*****t parks, and small zoos... One thing to say, this place is not suitable for couples, because there are babies everywhere, and it is a paradise for children. The hotel also has a variety of hosting projects to liberate parents!
4. The Horizon Club has its own happy hour, which can be eaten for dinner. Because the experience is so good, I renewed a suite on the second night, and the housekeeper gave me a bunch of surprises... That’s right, draw a key point#假房住上丽拉是重要的Better administrative services in the Horizon Club will double the experience#
Summary: A parent-child hotel with almost full marks, remember, the Horizon Club started!

However, the ticket was canceled due to the Hainan epidemic, which is a pity. So this time when we decided to come, we contacted Nina in advance, and she was still very enthusiastic, thank you for the acquaintance. Shangri-La is indeed very suitable for living with children. Children’s facilities are complete. Before check-in, the butler in the room has arranged for us children’s toothbrushes, slippers, bathrobes, and welcome fruits in advance. You don’t need to contact the service after checking in like other hotels Center, very considerate, 100 points satisfied. There is a special children's dining area for breakfast, a children's water park with constant temperature, a small train, a children's playground, a small zoo in the park, a bonfire show at night, and it is very close to the beach. The staying experience is great, and I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity.

First of all, in the season of January, it is rare to have a huge outdoor heated swimming pool suitable for all ages; the free afternoon tea and happy hour buffet are really a small surprise; there are three restaurants for breakfast, which is very convenient , especially the main restaurant, which is very rich, with a variety of varieties and good taste; compared with many hotels of the same level in Haitang Bay, it is slightly short near the beach. Shangri-La has built a long sea-viewing platform on the beach, equipped with deckchairs and The hammock is very thoughtful; the hotel's garden-like environment is worthy of praise; the service is thoughtful, considerate and efficient! In short, it is definitely a head presence in Haitang Bay!

msg:With one old and one young,
1. The hotel is very big, with more than 10,000 steps around the circle, it is too close to the sea, just go out. The battery car is on call. The room type is seriously recommended to start with the Horizon Club. In Building 1, the room faces the sea, with L'Occitane bath, all-day drinks, steak and lobster balls for dinner. . . There are no different dishes every day, there are few people, the drinks are plentiful, and the room refills are mentioned.
2. Parent-child hotels are the best choice. Children’s projects start from morning to night, small trains depart on time, swimming pools are heated, ziplines, shooting, archery, and shaved ice. . . .
3. In terms of service, Ms. Gaga is simply the ceiling, which is also the luck of our trip. The welcome gift and the farewell gift are both patient, warm and meticulous. The rest of the waiters have to work hard. I hope that Gaga's benchmark service will be the standard of the entire hotel. I have to criticize the few young people in the Children's Paradise. They have no love and no sense of risk. The zip line is still risky. They have a poor attitude towards the children and there is no explanation or protection. They are busy talking about love, fishing, etc. get off work.
4. If you want a quiet, comfortable and slow-paced vacation, bring the elderly and children here. Couples who like the hustle and bustle come to Atlantis.

1. Full personal butler service. Our personal butler is Li Moruo. He started to make various arrangements before checking in. He was very considerate throughout the whole process and really felt at home. Thank you very much for the customized birthday cake for the children.
2. Qiu Caixia, the cleaning aunt, is very attentive and careful. She did all the cleaning during the four days of stay, and it was very comfortable to live in. Thank you for decorating the room for the children.
3. The hotel is very a**ospheric, there are many parent-child activities, and there are many facilities for children to play. The key is that there is no charge. The swimming pools are all heated swimming pools, swimming and playing in the water rain or shine.
4. The hotel's breakfast is very rich. There are also several kinds of seafood, which is an unexpected surprise.
In short, among the hotels of the same level, this one feels the best!

The large lawn is especially suitable for children to run, and there is also an indoor activity venue. Although it costs 150/day, it is full of sincerity and is suitable for children over 5-7 years old to play. The Horizon Club is very convenient to check in. There is a restaurant on the first floor, and there are not many people there. This time I took my baby alone, so I didn’t panic. Southeast Asian restaurants serve a very high level of food. My baby likes to eat baby corn, and the kitchen even helped me make an extra serving The housekeeper, Nina, was very considerate to send us off, and she would take the initiative to ask for any needs.

A few suggestions:
1⃣️Breakfast ends at 10:30 😂Other hotels are open until 11:00. It's a bit difficult for people on vacation to wake up early.
2⃣️The water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is really low. I naturally know that the temperature in Sanya is low in cloudy days these days. You can also adjust the water temperature, especially in the children's pool. It is not recommended to play in this kind of weather.
3⃣️At night, the fire-fighting facility in the middle of the top of the room is always on with 2 green lights, and I don't know what it is. My husband said he was taking a sneak shot 😅 and asked me to point the flashlight of my mobile phone at him, but the green light turned off when I pointed it at him, and it really didn’t turn on when I observed it in the next few nights. I really didn’t feel it Sleep well. It is recommended that the hotel check itself to avoid disputes!

msg:I stayed at the company's annual meeting last year. I want to choose a hotel with a swimming pool to stay again for this private trip. The experience is very good. When I checked in, I was received by Bruce LIU. He was very thoughtful and professional in arranging some of my cumbersome details. Erica, the housekeeper, gave me a refreshment and refreshment. The professionalism of the two must be praised by hand👍. The swimming pool is amazing. It is open until 20 o'clock in the evening. You can swim around after visiting the duty-free shops🏊‍♀️... Super satisfied, I will stay here next time I come to Sanya.

The day before the check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Yang called and added WeChat, asked about the check-in needs in advance, and gave a room on a high floor. When you arrive at the hotel, from the doorman to the front desk, you are all warm and friendly. Check-in is very fast, and your luggage will be sent directly to your room. Although the hotel is a bit old, it is well maintained and the rooms feel new. Breakfast and Horizon Club happy hour are delicious. The big slide is very fun. The shuttle bus in the hotel is also very frequent. There is almost no need to wait. It will not reduce the operation because of fewer guests. From living to playing, it is full of details, very Carefully! I have stayed in all the hotels in Haitang Bay. Although the garden and design of this hotel are not outstanding, the service standard is very high. On the day of check-out, the housekeeper took the initiative to delay the check-out and gave a small toiletry set. Although it was not worth the money, I thought it was very thoughtful. If you have any questions, you can directly ask the housekeeper, and they can respond and solve them in time. I feel at home and will come again.

msg:I stayed at the Sheraton for 2 days, and booked a 3-day Sheraton for the second half. Since I started university, I always go out for a walk every year, and I have also stayed in some luxury hotels in some countries. The housekeeper and the little brother with the online name "Qingting" that Shangri-La met this time is really amazing. Contact me one day in advance, help me check in before 12 o'clock on the day of check-in, send us into the room, send fruit, candy and chocolate, free breakfast for 9-year-old children, help me book various children's activities, send All kinds of small gifts, and offered to help me check out until 4 pm (evening flight). The child ordered atropine eye drops and needed to be refrigerated. One day before departure, he contacted the guest room to ask if he could provide a bottle of quick-frozen mineral water the next day. After no results, he contacted the butler brother. He only said, no problem, leave it to me. The next day, they not only gave me two bottles of quick-frozen mineral water, but also took the initiative to give me two boxes of L'Occitane travel kits, saying that they can be used when going out. I also stayed in Shangri-La a few years ago, but this time I just wanted to be such a butler brother, so I won’t choose other hotels in the future.

msg:It was the first time in my life to travel alone to Sanya, and I had to set off under the severe epidemic situation. I didn't expect to like and be so happy. I chose Shangri-La Hotel for four days and three nights. The front desk service attitude is very good. During the registration process There is a more caring intern, Ms. Liang Lijun. We all speak Cantonese, and we hit it off very well. I didn’t expect her to be the same age as my son. I couldn’t believe that I could be her mother, and she even I can’t believe I’m so old 🤣🤣 It’s really fate🙏 So we chatted very happily 🥳 She took the room and asked her colleagues to bring fruit to me😄😄 I really feel like I’m going out to meet a noble person

On the second night, I asked my colleagues to deliver fruit and red wine🍷Unfortunately, my drinking capacity is very poor, and I got drunk after just one glass😵‍💫, but I got drunk with a happy mood

On the third day, I went out for dinner and came back. When I returned to the room, I saw a lot of gifts from the hotel 🎁. I was very surprised and touched. Although this itinerary is not lonely, thank you for your care and love for me. I will do it again next time I will choose Shangri-La Hotel, because everyone is very warm and welcoming 🥰🥰🥰 Your service makes me feel at home🥰🥰🥰

msg:I have been to Hainan so many times, and I have stayed in several hotels. This time, the cost performance and experience of the stay are overwhelming. Before arriving at the store, Xiao Yang, the housekeeper, asked him whether he needed to prepare anything in advance, and whether there were any elderly or children. As soon as I entered the store, I received beautiful gifts and desserts from Xiao Yang for the children (I smoked, and I just got off the plane without a lighter, so I wanted to ask if Xiao Yang Hotel could provide it, but I didn’t expect Xiao Yang to buy it from outside and deliver it to the room, Really touched), I would like to sincerely thank Xiao Yang for helping our family solve many problems. Secondly, the hotel's children's entertainment facilities also meet all the requirements of children's play. From the swimming pool to the slides, there are security guards watching the whole process. It feels like a beach ******, and the children are very happy (there are many projects in the hotel, because I haven't been able to experience the relationship of time, and I will try it again next time). Again, the hotel's beach water is very clean, few people, the beach is just behind the hotel, a minute's walk. Finally, the afternoon tea provided by the hotel (there are many dishes, it is completely a buffet) and breakfast (divided into 5 areas, different dishes in different areas) can meet the general cost of the store. Summary: I am really moved by writing so much. This time I traveled to Sanya, and I was really excited by some hotels. At the same time, I was also moved by this hotel. There are good and bad. I will designate it next time I come to Sanya Haitang Bay. Shangri-La Resort.

Whether it is the hardware condition or the hotel staff, it is satisfying and comfortable. During the epidemic, there is also a door-to-door nucleic acid service, which is located in the aisle of the conference hall next to the hotel lobby. Compared with the hot weather next door, it is much better to drive guests out of the lobby to do nucleic acid. Tony Xiao Wang, the housekeeper who stayed this time, is also very considerate, answering any questions and responding to any requests. I really don't want to recommend any more, otherwise it will be uncomfortable if there are too many people.

I chose Shangri-La because I didn’t want to spend any more time on hotel selection. I felt that the old-fashioned Shangri-La should be reliable and worry-free. The choice is very correct. Sanya Shangri-La is the last stop of my November holiday, but it is the hotel with the most perfect and impeccable experience throughout the holiday and far beyond expectations. From the beginning of the reservation, the housekeeper vera added WeChat to the hotel's event information and internal detailed introduction and how to play. I gave it to me. Every staff member I met on the way was in very good condition. It made people feel very good, relaxed and happy. The room was very clean and spotless. On the way back to the room, I met Ms. Qiu Caixia who was doing cleaning work. She treated her work well. Meticulous, good attitude, I really meet my needs everywhere, I am very satisfied and very moved. There are toothbrushes and a set of special toiletries for children in the room, as well as special dressing gowns and slippers for children. The details are so well done. Families with children don't have to worry, because there are many preparations for children in the hotel. of playing. The gifted travel photography experience is also very good, because the experience is very good, the weather is good and the scenery is beautiful and I took a lot of photos that day. The photographer, Mr. Yang Yong, was very patient when taking photos, and the people are also very good, not to mention photography skills. Very professional and very good, helped me to freeze the photos with one by one, and left a very good memory for my trip to Sanya. After I came back, my friends said that the photos were too beautiful and asked me where the photos were taken. I really strongly recommend it. Shangri-La's beautiful and handsome men must experience the travel photography service here, which is very worthwhile. I also have to say that the hotel breakfast is delicious and rich in variety. It is very convenient and interesting to have a children's countertop specially prepared for children. The afternoon tea given is also delicious. There are many choices. Shangri-La is really full of sincerity and meticulousness. The excellent service to the guests is really worth it. This is what a vacation in Sanya should look like. It is because of this that I remember their names. I really strongly recommend

Shangri-La is the best hotel in my opinion. The whole hotel is a resort style, with its own beach. At night, I went to the beach to listen to the sound of the waves. During the day, the children were in the water playground and the children's playground had a lot of fun.
JW Marriott is a little more expensive than Shangri-La, but no matter the room size, location, and service are a lot worse, and since the sea view room is obliquely looking at the sea, and the sea cannot be walked over, and there is no feeling of vacation, just look at tomorrow's children Paradise, I am quite disappointed so far!
So I recommend everyone to stay in Shangri-La, don't be deceived by some hotel reviews

It is also very close to the seaside. Our order was only renewed for one day and the next day. On the first day of our stay, the housekeeper gave us welcome fruits and we will send them back after our stay. Well, Fannie kindly asked about the check-in experience. During the stay, the housekeeper posted the latest itinerary, catering information, and nucleic acid time every day. Now in the off-season, there are not many people, and the experience is superb.

The overall condition of the hotel is still online, and the room facilities, swimming pools, playgrounds, etc. are all very good. Maybe due to the epidemic and too few guests, some items will be reduced than usual, such as breakfast, and there will be fewer choices in the next few days.

Fannie at the front desk will update the service hours of each restaurant every day, and the service response is also very positive.

Friends said that the photography was very good... The breakfast and afternoon tea were very rich~ Coinciding with the wedding anniversary, the hotel also sent a small cake 🎂 The service is really nice~

He freed his hands to take pictures in the lobby during the whole process. Then vera, as our housekeeper, provided us with hotel services for three days and two nights. From the hotel layout to the time of various play facilities to the duty-free shop shuttle bus and discount coupon information, help us spend a perfect three-day holiday in the hotel, and give vera a thumbs up for its professional service and careful tips

msg:It took a few days to calm down and write a review. It’s really because the experience of escaping from Sanya was too annoying. Let’s talk about the hotel.
The old chain hotels used to travel abroad, and they would choose the third hotel in the Sanya trip. They also have projects that are more suitable for children to play. I chose the two big and one small, and I chose the honorable sea view king room. There is also a sofa bed that can be opened to make the bed. This is also convenient for children to sleep without three people cramming a bed. The hotel's large slide is very attractive to children. The large swimming pool also has some paid items that can increase the interest of children. The night market of the hotel a few days a week is also very special. The clear restaurant has a large variety of meals and a complete range of meals. The breakfast in the children's area can be considered very rich. I also experienced a seafood buffet dinner in the hotel. A chef also came out to help me introduce the special drunk chicken, which is really very enthusiastic. Incidentally The ice cream egg waffles every night is a must-eat for children every day! In the afternoon, there will be many free items for children on the big lawn, such as Frisbee, driving a car, etc. My children and I had a good time. After the silence in Sanya, the hotel also opened a challenge park and a small train for free for children. Finally, let's focus on the service of the hotel. It's really very good! When I checked into the hotel, I took the initiative to add my Wechat housekeeper Hedy Huang to update the information as soon as possible every day to me, Phoebe Yu, who served in the lobby of the Horizon Club in the room assigned after being stranded, and Liu, who has been helping guests contact the return trip for the last few days. Managers, including Aunt Qiu who cleaned the room, and an aunt from Northeast China, forgot to ask what their surname was. It really reflects the professionalism of a hotel person in this extraordinary period. It can basically be regarded as responding to requests and helping solve problems from the perspective of customers. Let us be in this kind of situation. In a very helpless situation, there is a trace of support and comfort, and there are many hotel staff who have not left their names, which really makes me feel that I will choose Shangri-La when I stay in the hotel in the future! btw This time, the only lady in the lobby who wears glasses, the attitude she expressed after meeting us at the airport and being sent back to the hotel was a bit speechless. I was waiting for her to come out to communicate a solution, but she felt like she was holding a quarrel when she came out of the office. I didn't ask any questions and started shouting loudly that I didn't receive official instructions... It's very frustrating
Overall, Shangri-La will be my first choice in the future. Thank you very much to every hotel staff who are sticking to their posts during this difficult time.

Since you need to make an appoin**ent, can you make it clear? Can you play for two minutes? If there are too many words, I understand that I won’t play anymore. If there’s no one, I’ll just play around for two or three minutes. I’m not allowed to set up a bonfire and line up. I’ll wait for the result and the car will be left there. The breakfast is good.

msg:This is the sixth time to stay in Shangri-La, Sanya. Every time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay in Shangri-La. This time, the children are on their summer vacation. Taking advantage of the national tourism boom, they once again came to Sanya Shangri-La for a vacation.
First of all, I want to focus on the key points. Special thanks to Manager Wang Ning, Lemon. Knowing that we brought children here, we helped arrange the children's decoration in advance, and there are many hidden surprises! Children are very happy! From pre-booking communication, to check-in, various assistance during check-in, to help with check-out procedures, Lemon has provided us with a lot of help throughout the process! Let's feel like we're back home! A lot of details that we didn't expect, Lemon has thought for us! Super sweet! The hotel has such excellent staff, which really greatly enhances the intimacy of the guests to the hotel and the recognition and loyalty of the Shangri-La brand!
Every time you come to Shangri-La, Sanya, you will feel different changes. This time, the hotel has also added many new features and highlights! The Southeast Asian-style night market has a unique style, and the Lu'an Club also has very colorful activities! Go-karts, hand-painted kites, bonfire parties, etc., children have a lot of fun, super happy!
I personally think that Sanya Shangri-La is definitely the benchmark for parent-child hotels! This is not only reflected in the hardware of the hotel, but also in many details, such as the canopy of the swimming pool, which is super friendly to adults and children who are afraid of tanning! A rare shade of shade under the bright sun! For example, safety and hygiene are the primary considerations for bringing children. Shangri-La Hotel's high standard of hygiene and thoughtful safety measures are even more reassuring! Shangri-La's swimming pool cleanliness standard is the highest among many Sanya hotels I have stayed in, and the swimming pool water is kept extremely clean! The staff cleans carefully every day, it's not a problem at all! The lifeguards in the hotel swimming pool and the staff on duty on the big slide are very conscientious! The spirit of Shangri-La Hotel staff is very positive and sunny, making guests feel like spring breeze and feel at home! Interpretation of Shangri-La's hospitality!
The two super lawns of the hotel are also amazing, and the photos are very good! Horizon Club products and services are still very online! Shangri-La's dining standards are always top-notch!
During the entire six-night itinerary, staying in Shangri-La felt very familiar and comfortable! It feels like time flies so fast, the journey is over! In conclusion, Sanya Shangri-La's clean and tidy environment, warm and thoughtful service, and colorful parent-child activities have made a super perfect journey together!
At the end, I would like to thank Manager Wang Ning again, and look forward to the next meeting in Sanya Shangri-La!

1. The environment is excellent. The entire hotel covers a large area and has all kinds of facilities. Some people feel that the decoration of the facilities is outdated, but the decoration of the wooden island is similar to the Thai style, and it feels like coming to Pattaya. I still like it!
2. Be sure to choose Horizon Club, because it is an executive room, the geographical environment is closest to the sea, and you can open the window to see the sea! And the Horizon Club has fruit benefits, and the daily afternoon tea and happy hour (equivalent to a simple dinner) go straight for a swim! All-you-can-eat drinks! Breakfast is in the Horizon Club, no need to queue in the lobby!
3. The service attitude is really good, every waiter will respond to your requests and questions.
4. There are still many facilities for parent-child play, such as go-karting, swimming (two pools, with water slides) and water bubbles. No need to crowd people at Atlantis.
5. Go to the duty-free shop near! It is recommended to go after dinner, the tour group has gone back, and there are many fewer people. There are many people opening the door in the morning. First get coupons to buy expensive ones, and use points to buy cosmetics.
6. It is recommended that Ctrip rent a car for a self-driving tour, pick up the car at the station, and the price is fair! It's convenient to go anywhere!

After staying for four nights, all problems were solved quickly, very ok, the room arranged for check-in was on the first floor, with a The oversized garden, which opens the door to the children's playground and swimming pool, is quite satisfactory except for the common problem that the room is a little dark and the sound insulation is not very good. The hotel's children's program is also relatively rich. Although there is no giant playground of Kaiyuan Group, some are still charging items, but it's okay. The pool bubble party in the evening is very fun. The beach in Haitang Bay 🏖️ is not allowed to swim in the sea, but you can catch small crabs at night. There is a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. It is a 5-minute drive. If you go to play, you can walk there, and the location is quite good.

Advantages: 1. There are two large slides in the children's pool, which children like very much, and the bubble party is also more popular with children
2. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good, which can meet the needs of all kinds of people
3. Although the Adventure Park is not as big as expected, the slides are indeed big enough
4. Although the room decoration is relatively old, the maintenance is not bad, especially the various designs in the room are very popular in my heart, I think it is very easy to use, and it is more in line with my usage habits
5. The overall green environment of the hotel is very good, there is a big lawn
Disadvantages: 1. The little sisters and brothers who stayed in the service this time are all just graduated from the hotel and are unfamiliar with the hotel. There are also many interns in the restaurant. Originally, our room fee included breakfast and dinner, and we only needed to pay for the children. Half price is enough, but I still made a mistake when I checked out. I waited for them to check the list at the front desk for half an hour before I figured it out. It's really a bit of a deduction.
2. It takes a long way to go to the beach, the beach there is indeed not as good as that of Yalong Bay.
3. There are too many charging items

Under such special circumstances, every employee of the hotel treated the guests staying at the hotel as family members, and tried their best to help each tourist to find a way, and to treat each guest as a family member. The tourists are all sent off properly, which is really very touching!
Not to mention the hotel's environment and meals. As a parent-child hotel, children come here every summer to play~
If Shangri-La was regarded as a hotel before, after this incident, Shangri-La is my home in Sanya!
Special thanks to Manager Robin, who really tried his best to think about the way to leave the island like family, and escorted us well! Robin has worked so hard~ I would also like to thank Louis, Kyo, Fu Yuyan, Li Xinyan, and the Xiang family who I don't remember the name of! Looking forward to the early recovery of Hainan Island, we will meet again soon!

msg:During the peak season, the check-in was very slow. After waiting for an hour, it didn't come out. The order remarked to ask for the sofa bed and didn't come out. However, the little brother in charge at the front desk was very nice. Although I was very dissatisfied with the room, I couldn't coordinate because the room was full. Take us to the room, also sent fruit plate, etc. to apologize. Shangri-La's service is still worthy of praise. The children are very satisfied with the swimming pool. The hotel can go directly to the beach. There are also various washing places along the way, and the details are full.
The room facilities are average, but the sound insulation effect is very good. Although it is facing the swimming pool and lawn, the balcony door is closed, and the noise can not be heard. The only time I was a little uncomfortable was that there was a night of dragging things upstairs. It was a bit noisy and continued to drag. For a long time, I don't know if I am fighting the bed. Overall, I am quite satisfied with Shangri-La. It is very close to Atlantis and walks to the water world. The key hotels have electric carpools, which can be delivered to the hotel parking gate, and it only takes 5-6 minutes to walk. There are also some seafood stalls nearby, with pick-up and drop-off services.

Facilities: The facilities of this old-fashioned hotel are not particularly new, but they are not damaged, and the sense of use is still very good. The room size of Shangri-La is slightly smaller than that of Sheraton, and the bathroom and balcony are smaller, but the layout is reasonable and it is very comfortable to use. .
Service: The overall service is in place, much better than the next door. Implementing butler service, butler Lucy answers all questions and answers all kinds of questions online, saving us a lot of time. The concierge is also very nice. Whether it is check-in or check-out, there are people who help to pick up and drop off the luggage, and they are friendly and comfortable. The concierge will deliver the luggage to the room after check-in. There is no feeling of being neglected or neglected at any time or anywhere. There are many parent-child activities. The housekeeper Lucy will introduce to the guests what activities are there and how to participate. The guests can arrange the time reasonably according to the posters, so that the children's holidays can be enriched and happy. There are two rotating slides in the water park. Children are very enjoyable to play. For children who dare not play, adults can accompany them to slide. The old mother, who is afraid of heights and water, risked her death to slide three times in order not to make her children regret. Choked to death by water... The anti-skid pads in the water park need to be updated, some are curled up, and they are easy to be overturned.
Dining: The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes great, and there is a children's optional area, which is very convenient. When queuing in the morning, there is a staff to guide you, so you don't have to grab a seat yourself, someone will lead you in when there is an empty seat, and the waiting time is not long.

msg:The first time I stayed at Shangri-La, I read the reviews before I came here and said that the hotel's outdated service was average, but I was unexpectedly satisfied. When I checked in, I added the housekeeper, Estelle, and sent various activities and introductions to the hotel. The service is considerate and satisfied. Booked the Horizon Club King Room, the sofa bed is very large, free of charge. Many are suitable for families. There is also a free happy hour with hot food to eat for dinner. Soft drinks are available throughout the day. Horizon Club and above are recommended. In addition, there is a nucleic acid point in the hotel parking lot, 15 yuan for a single tube. Very convenient. The swimming pool is also very good, the heated swimming pool, the children have a good time. Will come again next time.

Fortunately, Mr. Li Zihao from the hotel promptly followed up on the various needs of our group and met them in a refined manner, allowing me to experience the high-level service of Shangri-La as always. The epidemic has brought great impact and changes to all walks of life, especially the hotel industry. I hope the hotel will not forget its original intention and look after each other with the first-class service of every employee.

In the afternoon, you will never receive a call from the service center. The child took a bite of the bread for breakfast and said he took it and ate it while walking. The attitude is also very bad. I am disappointed in general. The holiday is half cheaper than this, but it is obviously better.

After staying one night, we immediately extended our stay for two more nights. A vacation should be like this: huge swimming pool, wide lawn, close to the beach, children's club, although we are older children, it does not hinder their interest in experiencing activities, the hotel also arranges night markets and bonfires in the evening. The breakfast dishes are rich, and when the crowd is crowded during the morning rush hour, the seats are arranged in an orderly manner, and it can be seen that the management is in place. Chi Spa is promoting a group purchase of 2 people on a comment. It is very cost-effective for a massage trea**ent of 580 yuan per person per hour. Remember that this is a spa in a 5* hotel, and it usually charges at least 1,000 massage per person. During the stay, I am very grateful to the help of sister Skye at the front desk. The family members said that they must stay here again when they come to Sanya next time.

msg:It's hard to describe the feeling that the peak season has to wait in line for the guest room until more than three o'clock, thanks to staying at the ocean aquarium until nearly two o'clock; the long queue for breakfast is eight or nine minutes, the environment is noisy, and the quality and variety of the dishes are all similar hotels in this trip. The worst can feel the operating pressure of hotels in reducing costs to cope with the epidemic. The chef who made the breakfast has a very bad attitude. There is a big gap with the service quality of the Mei Hotel Group, and the room service staff are very polite and take the initiative to greet each other with a smile. Although the decoration of the hotel is slightly rough, it is more retro and nostalgic, and the wood materials in Southeast Asia bring a warm and comfortable holiday feeling. The elegant design of the hotel's landscaped swimming pool is a major feature. There are many parent-child projects, and there are various activities in the evening, although they are just going through the motions and are not involved, but at least there are. The assigned garden view room is directly opposite a large vacant parking lot, and in the corner, you can see the Mayan standard building of the water world. At night, the pool party will be more noisy. After the response, I changed the room at noon the next day, although the operation had to be booked by myself. There is a large platform by the sea, and the beach is also cleaner than some hotels around. The overall experience is not bad, but the quality of service needs to be improved.

The Horizon Club Sea View Room has the highest sea view on the 7th floor, but it cannot be compared with the high-rise floors of other hotels. The Horizon Club afternoon tea products are a little less, but the happy hour at night is far better than that of Atlantis. The wine provided during the happy hour is also good, which can be used as a Simple dinner buffet. In the evening, there is also a food street with live singing, which feels good. Disadvantages, lack of luxury, advantages, high cost performance, basically do not need to go out with children, and manage two meals a day.

Rich, the afternoon happy hour presented by Horizon Club can be eaten as dinner, and the service level of the waiters is also more professional. However, the hotel facilities have some sense of age because of the time problem. Because the occupancy rate in the summer is relatively high, I feel that the hotel's reception capacity is somewhat inadequate. The main problem is that the check-in time is too long and the battery car is difficult to wait, but overall it is still a relatively satisfactory check-in experience.

msg:Because of the summer vacation, there were a lot of guests staying in the hotel, and the whole hotel was full. As soon as we entered the hotel, no one would take care of us, and no one would take the initiative to help us with our luggage. I finally found a check-in agent and asked if Horizon Club can do it here. The little girl hesitated and said to check it out. After confirming it, she told me to do it in another building. She found another girl to take us downstairs to take a battery car over there. This girl named Wendy is still very enthusiastic. The weather is so hot, and some guests are temperamental. No, she was very patient. When we arrived at Building 1 and ready to check in, we were told that the room was not ready. We arrived after 3:00 pm. It was clearly written by the hotel that we checked in after 3:00 pm. We didn't ask for it. I checked in early, but had to wait for the room. The first wait was more than an hour. It was really hot during the process. Finally, I finally got to the room. As a result, I went up and saw that the cleaning was still mopping the floor. I had a bottle of iced mineral water, but when I was about to drink it later, I found out that it had been drunk by someone else. The so-called sea view room is actually very general, because the overall building is not high, there is no sea view, just look at the swimming pool, the facilities are indeed a bit old, but the maintenance is OK, but the cost performance of the Horizon Club is not high, the service is also average, on duty on the day of check-in The manager, Bruce Liu, came to the door to express his thanks, which is very considerate. We can understand how difficult it is for them to work under the scorching sun and full capacity. The hotel has more rooms and more guests staying in the Atlantis Hotel. It means that the hotel management is in place. The most important thing is that once you enter the hotel lobby, the people in the concierge are all right. Did not help with luggage, immediately felt that the service was poor. The travel photography of the hotel is still good. It is the best service among the three hotels we have stayed in this trip. The photographer is very responsible, and they are all selected for you after retouching. We ate breakfast at the buffet in Building 3. It is still very rich, and there is an exclusive dining area for children, which prepares a lot of thoughtful meals for children, so Shangri-La Hotel is indeed the first choice for parent-child family travel, which should be commended. The swimming pool is also very good and very big. There is a special children's play area and a rotating slide. It is very good. Big friends can also play. Finally, I would like to commend the duty manager Bruce Liu, who has always been very considerate and thoughtful in service. It can be regarded as saving a little face for Shangri-La Hotel, and it can also be regarded as a successful end to our trip to Sanya. One last little suggestion. Horizon Club rooms are equivalent to executive rooms in other hotels. I think each room can be equipped with a capsule coffee machine. Seriously, other hotels in Sanya have the same price.

The weather was basically fine. The aunt Qiu Caixia who cleaned the room was also very enthusiastic. She gave a lot of water every day, and the cleaning was also timely~ The set room package provides shooting, children's playground, karting children like it very much ~ the swimming pool is also very comfortable, go swimming every day, the children's pool has a children's slide or something, it is very suitable for a six-year-old baby~ You can bring two sets of swimsuits, otherwise it is not enough to change , Haha, very satisfied, next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will stay at Shangri-La again~

It is very suitable for young children. Other hotels are biased towards older children. Young children recommend this hotel very much. My 3-year-old daughter had a great time and loved the small three-color slide.
Restaurant: The price is generally high, the breakfast taste is average, and it is recommended to eat out. The night market at night is quite special and beautiful scenery, but the price is not close to the people.

Service: The hardware is very good, but it is a pity that the management preferential trea**ent has been improved. Especially the check-in time is too long. Generally, many guests complain after waiting for a long time.

There are too many surprises, a comfortable and clean living environment, a rich and varied breakfast, and a variety of children's programs. It is simply a children's paradise! Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Deng, who is very enthusiastic, patient, and responsive! The child needs to print the homework, she not only prints it immediately but also delivers it to the guest room as soon as she finds out! When the family was having a meal during happy hour, they called and said that it was grandma's birthday, and the hotel wanted to send a birthday cake to the restaurant, which was so sweet! The old man was very moved, delicious cake, strong affection! Thank you for the various humanized management services of the hotel, for cultivating such excellent staff, and we will continue to support you in the future! Order for you 👍

msg:I have come to Sanya several times and stayed at Shangri-La for the first time. The three-day and two-night stay left my child unsatisfied. No matter the hotel environment or the facilities for children to play, they are all first-class, especially the caring service of the hotel, which is worth mentioning. During the check-in time, someone immediately called to inquire about what time we could arrive at the store and what kind of services we needed before arriving at the store. There was also a one-to-one butler who served us intimately. Our butler was Hedy Huang, who added WeChat and asked every day if he had any Things that can help us, if I have any questions, she will reply in seconds without any delay, and she has a good attitude. She is a five-star service staff that I highly recommend. I look forward to coming again next time, enjoying the beautiful scenery and delicious food. relax!

I go to Hainan every birthday, and this year is no exception.
After staying for 8 days, the family did not disappoint. On the first day, there was a birthday present, and there were surprises every day. I rented a car and walked half the island, and the butler service was very considerate.
The customer service housekeeper Louis is a handsome guy, professional and friendly, very good! When I went back, I politely left gifts for our brothers and sisters 🎁

In fact, the entire hotel in Sanya has rejected many interns during the epidemic. Now the sudden peak season can't react suddenly, let us give the hotel a little tolerance

In addition, I am at the Renaissance Hotel now. I think back now, I still miss Shangri-La very much. There is no comparison and no harm.
I'll stay back if I have a chance

Now that I am back here, I still feel so cordial, and the service is even better than before. Well, although the facilities are a bit outdated compared to the newly opened hotels in recent years, it also feels a lot more mature. The room facilities are very convenient to use, which is obviously more considerate than those newly opened Internet celebrity hotels. Special thanks to the butler Nina Li for her considerate service. The children have been talking about living here in the future

The performance interacts with me. Even in the hottest afternoon, it will not be delayed and will be boring. The children have done handicrafts, and have also experienced shooting and archery. Although it is a charged item, the price is still very reasonable. They are all patient and friendly. Special thanks to Rachel, the lobby manager, who tried his best to help us coordinate the room, gave small gifts to the children, arranged them properly, and was careful and responsible. The whole stay was very comfortable and safe, and Shangri-La will definitely be the first choice when going to Haitang Bay in the future.

msg:Afraid of stepping on thunder, I booked for one night. Fortunately, I only booked for one night. Among the five-star hotels of the same level, Shangri-La has the worst hardware, software, and service experience. The room is small, the balcony is small, and the towels are very old (Although it is not used, but the sense is very poor), all facilities are basically up to the standard of Samsung. Dinner is an a la carte hot pot set meal in the cafeteria. On Saturday night, there were only 5 or 6 tables of guests in the cafeteria, and there were too many waiters, but there was no service at all. I don’t know what the waiters are busy with. The music in the restaurant is deafening. The food served was not very good, and the people who ate it were very frustrated. The Kids Club is only the size of a palm and has no facilities. The LooHoo Adventure Club charges 150 yuan for a child, and there are only three slides. There are not many facilities. The swimming slides are dilapidated. The so-called constant temperature swimming pool feels like cold water. There is no scenery, and some trees are planted casually, but many of the lawns in the middle are withered and yellow. The overall feeling is to provide guests with cheap and economical methods, but the charges are all in line with the five-star standard, and there is no sense of service at all. I just finished staying in Yanheng and Kaaba. When I arrived in Shangri-La, I felt exhausted all day. I couldn't stay any longer, so I checked out early the next day. If you plan to take children on vacation, think carefully. The only good thing is that the sanitation is very clean, the floor of the room and the bathroom are relatively clean.

msg:There are quite a lot of parent-child activities, but the hotel occupancy rate is too low and there are not many children, so basically no one plays these parent-child activities. The decoration is relatively old, but the hygiene is good and the facilities and equipment are relatively old. The L'Occitane for toiletries is good. Good check-out, and the guest relations manager called to ask. Although a butler was assigned to me, I don’t know if I was facing too many guests or why. The message response delay rate was too high. The sense of distance is also strong. I hope it can be improved. Otherwise, it is better not to be a housekeeper. Diaphragm

Although the buffet dinner I was thinking of was canceled, but I exchanged the same amount of a la carte Chinese food, you can also choose Western food, the dishes are large, and the taste still maintains the five-star standard. There are not many guests staying in the hotel, but there is still a quick response to call if there is a need. Special thanks to my housekeeper Nina, who gave me travel advice, told me the weather in advance, and helped us upgrade our room, as well as welcome fruits. Finally, I also prepared gifts for the children when I left the store, which is so heartwarming! Already looking forward to the next trip

🍃Environment: There is a heated swimming pool, a large lawn, and a sand pit for digging sand.

🔔Service: The service is very good, the housekeeper will ask you what you need every day.

The breakfast is very rich, there are many more optional breakfasts than other five-stars.
It is very baby-friendly, and each room has the toiletries that the baby needs. The waiter in the breakfast room will also take the initiative to help clean the baby chair.

The most surprising thing is that there is a daily afternoon tea under the luxury loft, there are many delicious food and wine.
If other friends go, I will also recommend Shangri-La. Will go again next time.

🍃Environment: A garden-style hotel, the floors are not high, and the sea view is generally better than the flowers and trees. The pool and gym are nice with plenty of clean towels and changing rooms.

🔔Service: The room service is nothing to say, and made a great honeymoon arrangement. The butler's WeChat reply is also very timely. The restaurant is too slow.
There is a free happy hour, and the desserts inside are delicious.

The biggest disadvantage is that the facilities in the room are a bit old, the hair dryer is broken 😂😂😂 The temperature of the air conditioner is deceiving. There are only two gears: off and crazy cooling. It really can't stand it in rainy days 😥

Fruits And red wine~ Every morning I wake up to the stars and the sea, the spring flowers are blooming🌸, standing on the balcony of the room, you can enjoy the beautiful sea view and the scenery of the hotel. Activities in the hotel are all picked up by small battery cars. The concierge brother and the lady at the front desk have a good attitude and must be praised. The environment of the hotel seems to be in a tropical rain forest, with a large green lawn, an outdoor swimming pool, and a small zoo. It is very fun to play when you are out of the house 😁.

msg:This stay in Sanya Shangri-La was a good experience:
1. The housekeeper Lemon is very enthusiastic and attentive. He contacted us in advance to help us upgrade and decorate the room. The children are very happy. The housekeeper also greeted us at the hotel lobby ahead of time and prepared small gifts for the children🎁, the family is very happy. When I finally left, the plane took off late because of traffic problems, and I also helped to delay the check-out until later. The service was very thoughtful.
2. The hotel occupies a large area and has complete facilities, like a large garden. I heard that the children's facilities are the best among the nearby hotels. It is a little regret that some of them are not open due to the epidemic. I really like a large lawn in the hotel, it looks very comfortable!
3. In terms of catering, due to the epidemic, only part of it was opened. It is a pity that there is no buffet by the pool. I heard that it is good. The breakfast is also good, and the kitchen will listen to the opinions of the guests and adjust the menu varieties. I heard that the breakfast will be very rich during the non-epidemic period.
4. In terms of room, we have been upgraded to a sea-view room this time, with a sofa bed. Our family of four is just right. The room is big enough and we live comfortably. On the first night, we found that there was a strange noise on the balcony. I was very scared. I contacted the housekeeper later and found out that it was the gecko's cry. The next day, an anti-gecko sticker was added to the room, and there was no sound from the back. This is the first time I know that a gecko can still bark, and my knowledge has really increased.
5. In terms of transportation, Shangri-La has a good location next to Atlantis. It is also close to the duty-free shop. The hotel can pick up and drop off for free. There is also a food court nearby, which is basically within 10 yuan. Nearby there is Haitang Bay Square during the day where nucleic acid can be done, and at night, it can be done at 301 Hospital.
6. On the whole, Shangri-La, who has lived in many places, is worth recommending in all aspects of Sanya, whether it is housekeeper, facilities, location, and meals. A small regret is that the epidemic cannot experience everything. There is a chance to come again!

msg:Shangri-La is as good as always, because Yan Ling, the manager of the hotel with children, upgraded us to the Sanya Shangri-La Horizon Club room type, which is very good. The room also sent a sun hat and a beach bag for travel. See the sunrise and sunset! 👍The hotel staff is very polite and considerate. As soon as I went there, I asked if I needed to open the sofa bed for children to play, because with children, I mainly participated in various children's swimming pool activities and parent-child activities organized by the hotel in the hotel. The children had a good time. The restaurant There are also many varieties of food, but I didn't take pictures of the food. The fresh food from Jiangnan is also very delicious. The children especially like Hainanese chicken rice!
The heated swimming pool set up in the hotel is the most satisfying for me to choose Shangri-La this time. After making a call, only the water temperature in Shangri-La can reach 29 or 30 degrees. It is great to sleep under the awning at noon🥳🥳, children swim at night No problem until ten o'clock! The travel photography of the hotel is also good, friends who have time can try it!
I really want to thank the sunny and handsome Manager Yan for taking care of us throughout the whole process. When we first went there, we called back to remind us of the buffet time and the schedule of the tour. We were very enthusiastic when we met in the middle, and he was also very gentle with children. Incredible! 👏👏👍
Made an appoin**ent, we will come again next time🥳🥳🥳

The most surprising thing is that Xiao Deng actually prepared pictures of the children in the room. The bed surround is prepared in advance, which is too intimate.

msg:Every year I come to Sanya to stay for half a month. This time I also stayed at Sofitel Leeman for three nights. I can't stand it. I have to move even without the free suite upgrade, the service is very poor) I stayed in Xiangxiang for 7 days and 6 nights, I really don't feel very good. The service staff are very enthusiastic, especially the service of the housekeeper Phoebe, which allowed me to stay in the original 2-day package on the first day of my stay, and then add another 2 days (basically I have stayed in all the hotels in Haitang Bay). Yes, I personally think that Shanger and Yanlord do not step on the thunder, the parent-child service is very good in these two hotels, and Shanger is more cost-effective)
I belong to the kind of old hotel that is more than 4 to 5 years old and generally don't think about it. I also recommended my friends to stay in March. The hotel's parent-child room is very cute, and the fruits I stayed in made me feel worth the price. I have lived in all styles. My daughter likes the big yellow duck the most. The children's playground and water play area are also very good. The overall external environment is very comfortable, but I still like the big lawn in the middle. I wake up in the morning and listen to the birds singing and look at the big grass. I feel very leisurely (so I gave up Yanlord this year, I still prefer grass to the beach 😀) The cafeteria also has special tables and chairs for children, so I love the little ones too (Manager Chen of the restaurant is also very good, every time They all greeted warmly), I like the meat bun for breakfast the most, it’s delicious, but it’s a pity that I only ate it for three days, and then I changed to the egg cake 🤪, there is a special lady who sings at the buffet at night, and my daughter likes it very much. I met the one who had a birthday. Guests will also come over to sing Happy Birthday to you😍 By the way, Aunt Qiu who cleans the housekeeping depar**ent is also very serious. In fact, I am a very entangled person. I have to trouble myself several times every time I clean it. Auntie is very patient. The two dolls are super enthusiastic about the children, and my daughter likes it very much😊
The whole point of caring service is that the whole family contacted Phoebe temporarily for diarrhea and stomach cold on the second day of our visit, and asked the kitchen to cook ginger brown sugar water for us in the middle of the night for several days (thanks to the chef in the kitchen 😄)
Will come again next year 😜😜😜

The oversized heated main swimming pool and children's pool, oversized lawns, where children can have fun, and various club activities, managed semi-custodial, can completely let parents let go.
Thanks to the staff Xiaopan and vicky, who carefully helped us take care of everything we needed from the beginning of check-in, which made our itinerary more perfect, thank you very much.
The hotel's breakfast is really super rich, and the replenishment is very timely. There are three coffee machines. I like this very much. Finally, I don't have to wait in a long line. This time I stayed in Shangri-La for too short time. I will definitely stay a few more times next time I come. sky.

I like the hotel so much! Live every time I come. The outdoor swimming pool is constant temperature, very large, with small bridges and flowing water, exquisite and beautiful! There are very few people on the beach.
We took a walk by the sea to Atlantis, and there were hardly anyone on the way (picture 1). There were too many people there, the building was too high, the density of the pool was not as big as ours, and the VIP pool was vacant and not everyone could go. I would recommend Shangri-La to all my friends! This is what a vacation feels like!
The hotel breakfast was great! There are many varieties. Dinner buffet too! Eat until you can't walk... Wine can also be opened for free, but unfortunately we can't finish it.
Many hotel pools are not heated. No matter how cold it is in winter, you can stay in a hotel all the time. correct. Now the world is cold and cold!

🍖Meals: Let’s talk about the meals in particular. I lived in EDITION, MGM, and Grand Hyatt before. I feel that Shangri-La’s restaurants are still the best. I can’t say that other people’s homes are bad, but Shangri-La’s breakfast and dinner buffets are really suitable for children. People eat, especially pancakes and fruits, the taste is also very suitable for northerners 😝 Catch up with the cold weather these days, the dregs vinegar hot pot is also just right.
In particular, I would like to praise the restaurant manager. Due to the lack of communication, I encountered some small problems and solved them in time. The attitude is very good and they are handled quickly!

🚗 Transportation: The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, next to Atlantis and not far from the duty-free shop. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, which is very convenient for shopping. It is recommended to drive or take a taxi. It may be inconvenient to take public transportation, because the hotel lobby is still some distance from the bus station.

🧹Sanitation: Very clean, the deluxe pavilion we stayed in, there was a scent of fragrance as soon as we entered the building, the room was cleaned very carefully, and the bathroom was basically spotless.

🍃Environment: The environment is the most satisfactory place for us to live this time. The hotel facilities are relatively new, the surrounding is quiet and fresh, and it is close to the beach, but it is not as noisy as Sanya Bay. It is really suitable for vacation.
🔔Service: The hotel staff are very professional and have a good attitude. You can ask the butler to reserve a battery car when you shuttle in the hotel. The massage of Chi Spa I also experienced this time can be said that the service is basically over the vast majority of massage shops outside.

For the first two days, we stayed in Yalong Bay, because our lover likes to eat seafood. We didn't go anywhere. Compared with food, in fact, Yalong Bay and Sanya Bay will eat more! But Hailong Bay is more suitable for vacation here! In the end, I chose Shangri-La, surprise!

🚗 Transportation: When you come to a resort city, you either charter a car or rent a car. It is convenient for you to go anywhere. The hotel will also call a car for you. Didi Business goes to the airport at around 230, and the hotel calls at 200

🧹Hygiene: The normalized Shangri-La model is very good, with no obvious dead ends

🍃Environment: You can't go abroad, but the sea view here is actually ok, the resort area, the software environment is up to standard

🔔Service: Horizon Club benefits, from courtesy car to check-in, everything is convenient and welcoming! There is an executive corridor trea**ent, and afternoon tea is also very rich!
A better experience, which adds a lot to the itinerary! I especially like the straw bag and hat in the room, although it is useless😁 I would like to make a small suggestion. Compared with St. Regis, the butler service is less, such as the confirmation call before check-in, the care during check-in, and the return visit after check-in , I didn't even hear it! Secondly, because I bought cherries and wanted an empty fruit plate, it took an hour from calling to delivery! Others are very good!

Maybe because the occupancy rate is too high in peak season
Check in a little late
But the hotel's timely communication and arrangements are worthy of recognition
It would be nice if we could arrange a more suitable waiting place while waiting for check-in.
Overall, it is quite good
It's the first experience to queue up for breakfast every day
Off-peak season should be better

The only problem is that the sound insulation is too bad. The lawn activities outside are very loud, and it ends very late, and the room can hear it very clearly. You can even hear the person next door snoring...
Facilities: All are heated swimming pools, which is better than other hotels and is very comfortable in winter. The large lawn and the hotel's indoor playground are also very suitable for children to play. The hotel breakfast is really good, the variety and the quality of the meals are second to the ordinary five-star. The service is also very warm and responsive.
Beach: There is no hotel exclusive beach, the beach going out from the hotel is like a wild beach.
A hotel with obvious advantages and disadvantages, it is very close to Atlantis, and there are many activities suitable for babies. Overall, I am quite satisfied.

msg:Before checking in, I read some bad reviews and I was a little nervous. After checking in, the overall feeling is OK. The room is big enough, although a bit old, but acceptable. I stayed for 2 nights with 2 children, 4 years old and 2 2 days old, so basically it is mainly based on the needs of children. We did not leave the hotel for 2 days. Although there are not many activities, 2 days are enough to play. The interactive part on the lawn in the afternoon is the children's favorite, and I look forward to it every day. In the afternoon, we played kite flying on the lawn, playing football and other outdoor activities. The hotel has a clean environment with a lot of greenery. There is also an indoor park. When we went there, it rained and we spent most of the day inside. , the swimming pool is also suitable for children. The heated swimming pool and the water depth of 1.1 meters are suitable for parents to bring their children or children to play by themselves, but it may become boring after a long stay. When I checked in, I introduced the housekeeper Vicky to me. You can contact her for any questions, especially timely and convenient. The breakfast is also very rich, although there is a queue, it is arranged quickly. Don't ask too much, it's still ok.

Shangri-La's facilities are a bit old, but it is very suitable for children to play. The two meals in the executive room are also very cost-effective.
To say that I am not satisfied, the level of the waiters is somewhat uneven. Some are particularly thoughtful and have life in their eyes. Some are very wooden. The girls who are in charge of karting on the small lawn are especially good.
Another is that the Horizon Club has no concierge service at all, and you have to carry your own luggage in and out. Even if there is a small tram to pick up and drop off, it is only responsible for driving. Only a little brother helped us with our luggage.
The flaws do not hide the good, in general, eat well, live well, and play well. Hope the waiter's training will be more in place.

When I turned to the 7th floor, I could see the sea and a large area of grass. The breakfast was very rich. There are many, but you need to queue up. The lady at the entrance of the restaurant is very strict. Seeing that the children in the front line may be too high, they are asked to pay half the price. The hotel has a lot of facilities for children to play, and you can take the children to play for a few days. The decoration of the room is a bit old, and the facilities are relatively old. The room service is very friendly, and I took the initiative to add supplies for the two children. When I checked in, I encountered the situation that the bathroom and shower facilities were not easy to use. The hotel Maxzhao also apologized and solved it in time.

The front desk gave a side cover, which is super large and very beautiful. I spent 5 nights of comfortable vacation. .

The key point is to say that the afternoon tea that comes with Horizon Club can be eaten as a full dinner. It really amazes me, and the breakfast variety is very, very rich, and I eat very full every day😆.

The two swimming pools in the hotel are very close, and the design is very human. There are different children's entertainment programs every day, and there are activities on the large lawn at night. Children have no time to play every day😆, and there is no time to dig sand.

The exclusive butler Robert has a very thoughtful service and a five-star praise!

msg:I brought a family on vacation, and I usually don't bother to write reviews, but this time I felt it was necessary to write.
🍃Environment: Super large outdoor heated swimming pool, super large activity lawn, and a small zoo, super rich parent-child activities, it is definitely a fighter in parent-child hotels, much better than family hotels like Hixton, most projects There is no extra charge. The quality of the buffet needs to be improved...

🚗 Transportation: There are not many underground seats in the parking lot. If there is no parking lot, you must park in the parking lot at the entrance. It is a little far from the Horizon Club where we live, but the luggage cart in the park can take you to the building where you live at any time without passing through the lobby. My mother-in-law and wife were fascinated by the warm and courteous brother, the service was very good and fast, and he was handsome.

🔔Service: Here's a reminder for the guests who are preparing to go there. We checked in at 2.30 and we didn't get the room until 5:00. It was really crowded, but the hotel manager was very good at upgrading our room, and the Ctrip manager also Helped us coordinate with the hotel, presented a fruit plate, etc. I want to give Ctrip a compliment here. When I encountered a problem, I quickly solved it. It seems that I have to find Ctrip to book a room!

🧹Sanitation: Very good, I thought the hotel was not particularly new, and the beach would bring a lot of sand up, but I didn't expect the room to be very clean and the room service was 666.

In conclusion, if the child is under 10 years old, it is highly recommended. It is definitely a fighter in a parent-child hotel, especially if ours is a girl, and a certain Lantis who is too intense can't play. If this trip has 10 points, I think Shangri-La Contributed at least 9 points, very recommended.

After all, playing with children is mainly to consider how to make them happy! Shangri-La is the first choice. The most important reason is the heated swimming pool. This ensures that no matter what the weather is, children can play in the water. In fact, Shangri-La's children's water slides are too friendly to children. Have a good time! I have stayed in Shangri-La before, and the management of the hotel is as always, even better! Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Deng, who is not only kind-hearted, but also super attentive. Knowing that I am bringing two children, I also prepared a parting doll for them. This unexpected little surprise made the children very happy. Thanks again Xiao Deng

There are so many varieties for breakfast, you are sure to find your favorite. The jungle-themed room was especially lovely, and the children spent two unforgettable days in the company of monkey dolls and tents. There are also many Loohoo tribal projects, as well as a game city and an adventure park. There is always one suitable for your own children.

2. The parent-child hotel was agreed, but when I called customer service, I didn’t tell the child that I needed to make an appoin**ent in advance, but only when I arrived at the hotel, I told the hotel that I couldn’t delay it anymore. I was very angry. When we arrive at the hotel after twelve o'clock, their activities start at nine o'clock. We need to pay the full cost of the day to participate, which is very unreasonable.

The hotel didn't remind me that the Minibar can be used free of charge on the first day when I checked in. I only found out when the guest next to me asked the front desk when I checked out. This can be regarded as an obvious evidence of bullying the guest. Check-in experience: I booked a jungle room on the first floor, which felt more pitted. The room was on the ground floor, and it was very humid. I didn't look closely when I booked it. After staying for five days, such a damp quilt will not be changed. I will not let me check out early! It feels extremely bad. The queue for breakfast was huge. A chaotic comparison, the only good thing is that the food is still plentiful.

msg:The parent-child themed room type has the advantage of providing supplies and toys for the little baby, such as the baby toilet seat, tents indoors and outdoors, and slides and sand digging tools in the small courtyard. The children's water park is also very popular with children, but the grid on the side of the pool is not flat, and it is easy to scratch the feet. The disadvantage is that although there are many parent-child activities, basically all activities are charged, including ocean ball slides and the like, 150 yuan per person. Most of these activities are free in other Sanya hotels of the same price. The breakfast buffet was crowded and had to wait for a table. In addition, restaurant prices are high.

It is located in the middle of the Haitang Bay coastal road, near the CDFG, and there is a lot of food. The most important thing is that there is a children's paradise in the hotel where you can put your children to play for a day. The adults went out to play by themselves, haha, got off the car and came to the lobby front desk to check in. The receptionist Xiaoli Gao, the handsome little brother, carefully arranged a very comfortable room for our party. When checking in, he told us everything about the hotel. The information around is very enthusiastic and even gave small gifts to the children. It can be said to be very considerate. After entering the room, we were so happy to see the scenery in the room. After staying in Shangri-La, Sanya for a few days, every day we passed by the front desk, we would see Xiao Li It's great that the children are happy to say hello to Xiaoli! ! !

Ask all questions, and the attitude is friendly and patient. It helps to get to know the hotel quickly. The children’s favorite is the bubble show, although this time in Sanya It was cold, and I played in the heated swimming pool for several hours. The only downside is that the room lights are dim, and everything else is very good.

1. Living in the Horizon Club, the room size is moderate, and fruit turndown service is welcome. There is a self-service ice cube machine in the ice cube corridor;
2. The breakfast 13pro was placed on the table, and it took half an hour to remember that the waiter handed it over to the front desk to keep it well 👍;
3. The child has diarrhea, and the cleaning aunt found out that she immediately made ginger brown sugar water, and was very moved;
4. There are many projects for children to play. I can play all day without being disturbed when I lie by the pool and read books;
5. The happy hour starts at 4:30 in the Horizon Club is very rich in food, and there are several good choices of drinks. We basically don’t have dinner after eating;
6. The housekeeper Wanfeng is a fellow from Chongqing. It is estimated that she is still in the internship stage, and she is still a very good little sister. I hope you enter this industry with enthusiasm. Only with love and enthusiasm from the heart can you go further.

Unfortunately, I did not remember the name. The guys in the entire concierge team are excellent. Praise Yang Runfeng. In contrast, Shangri-La is far better than the other Xijiaguo where we live.

I especially like the style of Shangri-La’s use of logs, wood carvings, and rattan chairs. I feel that every piece of furniture, every background wall, details of the wardrobe, even the wooden racks for storing luggage, are all carefully thought out, compared to those of the hotel. White minimalist style is not cheap hotel. I prefer this Southeast Asian tropical vacation style, and I admire all the details spent on the materials. The hotel ranges from the front desk, the concierge, the executive lounge, the breakfast room, to the aunts who are engaged in hygiene. Everyone I contacted is proactive and enthusiastic, and Shangri-La is indeed my first choice for traveling.

Although the room is not very big, the furniture is reasonably arranged and it feels very airy. There is no need to exaggerate the greening of the hotel. All five-star hotels with private beaches are actually quite green. The breakfast is also very rich. Because there is no comparison, there is no harm. I stayed at the Coral Hotel the night before, and the breakfast in Shangri-La was much richer than the Coral Hotel.

She would give a detailed introduction to the activities suitable for the baby, and give a comprehensive introduction to the hotel's entertainment activities and dining locations. If there are any problems, we will actively coordinate and solve them.
Because I arrived at the store late and did not catch up with the operation time of the small train, the baby was quite noisy. During this period, Louis Yang knew the ins and outs of the situation, so he drove the battery car to take the baby to the hotel for sightseeing, which was so heartwarming.

After all, it has been open for a long time, and there is a gap between Yanlord and Edison nearby. Although the service staff are very enthusiastic, they are not able to make up for the hardware. The gap is over.
This time, the heating equipment of all the swimming pools were not turned on, which is a pity as a major selling point of the hotel.
It can be seen that the hotel has thought of many ways to retain guests and increase profitability, including the cocktail party at Dragonfly Bar in the evening, but the price of 198 is only 2 glasses of wine, and the variety of dinner is also very monotonous, that is, barbecue and western pies are worth eating. The value for money and the dining experience are very average.

The hotel is especially worth mentioning that the air-conditioning is very powerful, and the indoor and outdoor are both ice and fire. Finally, I praised the hotel staff, the overall service is in place, and it is the feel of a veteran five-star hotel.

msg:The stay in Shangri-La was very enjoyable. It was a very good experience. I received the hotel from the entrance of the hotel. When checking in, André front office manager carefully guided the process and went to the room. The concierge Yang Junwei provided excellent one-stop service and introduced the hotel room. Facilities and entertainment of the hotel, and Xiao Yang gave us a heartfelt greeting and reminded us to have breakfast. Before we set off, we would also provide us with the time to take the bus, so that we could miss the time of the bus and care about greetings at any time. Next time we will stay at Shangri-La Hotel.

This time, I will experience the Shangri-La Hotel in Sanya, the Horizon Club room. Before check-in, please call to inquire what time to arrive at the hotel? What are the needs? When I arrived at the hotel, I upgraded to a sea-view room. The handsome butler Robert took us to see if the room was satisfactory, and introduced the hotel and our room package in detail. There will be greetings and inquiries every day during the stay. The work is very serious and responsible, and I praise the service of the hotel. Staying at this hotel is the right choice. The handsome butler at the duty-free shop called a car to contact the hotel and picked him up and down. The overall transportation, sanitation, environment, and service are all very good. Will visit again.

msg:Only stayed for one night, there was a little surprise in the accident. The veteran hotel, although it is not amazing at first glance, it is a unique style to taste slowly. There is no noise, the gardens, swimming pools, small water world, and cute mascots that children like, quietly and beautifully. The viewing platform by the sea is really nice, and it is very pleasant to lie down and watch the sea. The VIP Pavilion I lived in this time is the building closest to the sea, with a balcony facing the sea. Even if I don’t go to the sea in the morning, I can see the sun slowly rising when I open the curtains. Of course, what I like most is the professional and considerate hotel service staff. Especially Doris Zhuang, who carefully arranged and took care of her, and a pleasant little gift, always accompanied him from arrival to departure. There are also the service staff who come across, the little brothers who drive the battery car, and the young ladies who intimately serve tea in the restaurant. Every smile and every communication conveys sincerity and caring to customers. Sure enough, the essence of the hotel is not only in the hardware, it is the hotel people who make people linger.

msg:🚗 Transportation: Very convenient The hotel is very large, and there will be cars coming and running around for a few minutes. I have used a lot of cars these days, and the service is very good.
🍃Environment: The 7-year decoration still looks very luxurious. A lot of wood is used indoors, which is very nice. Outdoors there are parent-child swimming pools, expeditions, a large number of lawns in the zoo, etc.
🔔Service: Nothing to say. When I entered the door, I felt that the sheets were very damp. The waiter immediately took out the dry bedding and replaced it with a dehumidifier. The check-out is just downstairs, without going to the lobby.
Disadvantages. The room is very humid, probably because it rains and so on these days, but compared to other hotels, Shangri-La is more humid. In addition, the hotel set includes two dinners. The service lady always said that there is only one dinner, which made me very popular. Later, after the manager on duty confirmed it in the evening, I called back and said yes, two dinners. Ugh. In addition, two buffet barbecue seafood or something. It didn't open because of few guests. A set meal for me, a Southeast Asian restaurant. Of course, these two are very good, the taste is very good, the taste of Southeast Asian food is better than the taste of my taste in Southeast Asia. But I ordered two buffets. .
Summary: Except for dampness, everything else is good. You can stay for two days, parent-child one day, and duty-free shop one day. Just right. Or Atlantis is here two days a day, because it's next door.

You can enjoy the hotel’s facilities at leisure throughout the day and enjoy all-day meals and drinks. And butler service, isn't it much better than the noisy 2500 nights of pseudo-five-star and Atlantis like Mangrove? ! So if you come to Sanya Haitang Bay, you must choose Shangri-La!
Next, we will talk about services. The hotel provides a battery car to pick up and drop off guests. The beauty housekeeper Annie will accompany us from check-in to the room. She also introduced us in detail the various services provided by the hotel during our stay, etc., and also specifically told us that there are guests in the room. We have prepared a woven handbag and two straw hats for men and women, all of which can be taken away! Toiletries are still the two sets of L’Occitane nationally unified standards, as well as nice-colored flip flops. When I checked out, the housekeeper Annie helped me make a late check-out and gave me a coconut. Come here to give a small gift!
Finally, the food, see the picture, Shangri-La’s food is not good! The richness of the afternoon tea in the executive lounge is completely dinner!
Finally, everyone must remember that when staying in Shangri-La, you must choose the Horizon Club Executive Room! Although it is a bit more expensive, it is definitely worth it!

Although the hotel has a certain age, the interior decoration and maintenance are very good and clean. The suite we stayed in has an extra bed for free; the landscaping is done well, and walking along the winding path to the seaside is like wandering in the tropics In the garden; the beach is clean, the slope is gentle, and there is a very shallow section, which allows children to splash in the sea, which feels a lot better than the beaches of other hotels in Haitang Bay. Secondly, the service of the staff makes people feel like a spring breeze and feel more cordial. Special thanks to the villa housekeeper Peter Zhang Jie, who provided a lot of help from check-in to check-out, reserved a connecting room for our two families, and helped us find the swimming goggles left in the swimming pool. Thanks to Wang Xue from the Executive Building of the Horizon Pavilion for paying attention to the guests' stay experience and improving the breakfast and happy hour dining experience in the Executive Building in a timely manner. The meals produced by the executive are both rich and local. Looking forward to the next time we meet at Shangri-La!

msg:You can always believe that Shangri-La 👌🏻 Although not the latest and most luxurious hotel in Haitang Bay, Shangri-La feels that it is very comfortable and the service is in place. Butler Clarence is very meticulous, from providing food and beverage information to making appoin**ents for VIP services in duty-free shops.

The Horizon Club suites are very cost-effective, with welcome fruit desserts, free minibar, and airport pick-up service. Afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge of the Horizon Club is very good, with all kinds of hot and cold desserts and drinks.

In terms of environment, the hotel is a two-minute walk from the beach, and the swimming pool inside the hotel is clean and large enough.

In terms of diet, the breakfast is very rich, in addition to the regular dishes, there are also optional raw porridge and so on. Dessert is considered the best I have eaten in the hotel buffet recently. Butter cake and cupcake are rare and soft and delicious. Although the dinner buffet is cheap, the ingredients are very limited. The only drinks available are orange juice and coffee, which is not recommended.

In terms of service, overall it's pretty good. The butler Clarence and the lady at the front desk of the Horizon Club have very good service. But the housekeeping staff delivered the wrong things over and over again, and there were not enough staff at the cafeteria during dinner time.

msg:A wall from Atlantis, I booked this place after playing in Water World. I just arrived at the entrance of the lobby because we caught up with a company team building. The concierge at the door did not care about us. We went in by ourselves, and the front desk was still checking in for the team. With a long team, I feel unhappy at once. At this time, a girl, He Zhenzhen, took us to the Horizon Club to check in. She also told the front desk to upgrade the room. Knowing that I was unhappy when I first came in, she gave us afternoon tea with the front desk. The afternoon tea was very rich. We ate it directly for dinner. After returning to the room, the welcome fruit was already on the table. At that time, I decided to extend my stay. I will live here for the next three days. After adding WeChat, He Zhenzhen looked at my circle of friends and found that we had just got married and came out for our honeymoon. The next day he gave us honeymoon cakes and handwritten greeting cards. What moved me the most was that on the day we left the store, she prepared two mosquito repellent bracelets in addition to the bathroom kits she gave to our hotel. She also deliberately downloaded the one we got married from my circle of friends. The photos, as well as the photos from playing cards these days, were printed out and put in a photo frame and sent to us, and I suddenly felt that she was very careful. Through the past few days of getting along, He Zhenzhen, through her intentions, has made me change my view of the entire hotel little by little. I wish her a bright future. And sincerely recommend this hotel, the hotel environment is very good, very quiet, the swimming pool in the park is very big, all kinds of waiters will greet each other kindly, the whole a**osphere is very good, let's just say so much.

When we got off the bus, someone at the front desk helped us pick up the luggage, guided us to the front desk to check in, and warmly reminded us of the benefits we can enjoy. Later, each guest will be assigned a housekeeper to lead us to the room.
Very happy to meet beautiful young lady Amy, gentle and considerate.
After swimming and returning to the room, I found a cake➕a bottle of red wine on the table. This kind of surprise, joy, and satisfaction are beyond words. Later I learned that it was Amy’s honeymoon surprise for us,
After we checked out, we gave some souvenirs. Although the gifts are light, they are all about the affection ~ to make our journey more complete.
Thanks Amy...suggest to promote amy to supervisor, hahahahahaha
Shangri-La is the best hotel I have ever stayed in, satisfied~

msg:The Mid-Autumn Festival chose Sanya Shangri-La for a holiday, and the overall experience of Shangri-La’s humanities is still in place. The facilities are first-rate, it is very convenient to have a shuttle bus for half an hour to the duty-free shop🚌
On the day of check-in, there is only one front desk because it is late to the store. Check-in experience is not good and I will say at the end. Horizon Cassie was added the next day. The little girl was very careful. The answers to some questions were in place. The voucher scan code for the duty-free shop and the reply to the enquiry afterwards were very fast. Finally, I checked out and gave it away. My L’Occitane suit, I really did not expect such a surprise at the end. Thank you Cassie for leaving a good impression on my holiday
There was also a duty manager who helped me deal with the follow-up because my check-in was not smooth, because Wang Rongsui, the aunt of the cleaning depar**ent on my birthday, also gave me a big surprise. I made a birthday cake. I was very happy and left a note. Customer relations Amy and my colleagues personally sent me cakes and gifts. It’s really good for Surprise’s birthday arrangements. Thank you all.
I also want to thank the little brother who drives the battery car in the hotel on 9/21 for taking us to the back of the forest park and calling the front desk of the hotel. He also came to pick him up. Although I don't know your name, the explanation is in place.
9/22 Forest Park The little brother who serves archery in such a hot day also helped me pick up arrows without fatigue and impatientness.
The things in Xi restaurant are delicious 😋
In the end, the little brother of the concierge who checked out to help put on the car, sincere eyes are to get any and affirmation from customers

The following is a little bit unsatisfactory. The front desk Zhang X Zhuang on the day of check-in on 9/20 was probably very unprofessional. Asked how he got to the room and told us to go down the stairs. We checked in and brought this luggage. He asked us to walk up the stairs and asked. After the elevator, I didn’t say to help us call the car in the park, so we waited downstairs for a long time before we ran up to look for him. Regarding the hotel introduction and the voucher and reservation issues, he said that because I was on the phone, he didn’t say anything. It makes me feel that the distance from the five-star is far away. I also plan to check out today, but the card cannot be opened due to the delayed time. I saw the door was cleaned and asked to open the door. A middle-aged woman said to ask their supervisor in the afternoon of 9/22. She said they opened the door more often. I need to write a report. Okay. I will run downstairs in order not to add to the trouble. But I don’t know why I have swiped my room card or continue to be unable to open the door, so I asked the cleaning supervisor at the door and she still did. Very indifferent and told me that I could not open it, and then opened the door by myself and entered the staff room. Do I have any grudges against you. Any auntie cleaning lady who sees a guest in the corridor can take the initiative to greet him enthusiastically? Your cleaning supervisor has this attitude?
Originally I wanted to give the hotel a five-star praise, but unfortunately a cleaning supervisor at the front desk gave a low evaluation score. This kind of staff hopes that the hotel will train well not to destroy the good image of the hotel
If you come to Sanya next time, you should still choose Shangri-La. I hope that people like the front desk and cleaning supervisor who I encountered this time will lower the average score of the hotel.

msg:*Hotel facilities:
    I did a lot of homework before I came, and learned from friends who have stayed in the hotel that the hotel has been in business for some years, and it may look a bit dated. But after staying in, I just want to say that there is no old feeling at all! The first feeling of entering the room is the elegant fragrance, which makes people feel soothing and happy. A close look at every corner is also a glaring eye that can withstand Virgo's obsessive-compulsive disorder. The toilets, beddings and balconies are all clean and tidy. (The green from the balcony is really soothing)
    Outdoor facilities (especially children’s amu*****t facilities) are really thoughtful. The children’s play pool is where adults can also play together (to be honest, adults are happier), and shore shading is comfortable (suitable for lying down) Swipe your phone), because the package you bought includes an adventure park (if not included, the charge is 150 yuan per time). Children climb up and down to enjoy the discharge, and adults join the vertical slide to stimulate fun and release pressure.
    Europe~The hotel also has a large area of green lawns (you can play golf but you need to bring your own equipment, take pictures, not to mention the sunny days), its own viewing platform, special sandpit area, themed activity camp (this We chose to host the project at our own expense. The children’s feedback is that they are too happy to want to play next time. Of course, adults spend money to buy this day’s two-person world is even more happy and priceless) and so on.
*hotel service:
    Before we checked in, we stayed in Yate, which is separated by a wall, for two nights. The comparison between the two is obvious and Shangri-La is better in detail. We live in Building One, which is relatively far away from the lobby and dining spots (but very close to the children’s pool). We have to cross a long corridor every time we travel. During this period, we will inevitably encounter hotel staff in various positions, whether it is engineering maintenance. The staff of the cleaning and cleaning will send us a smile and say hello, small details reflect the big pattern, warm and comfortable.
    Butler service (our housekeeper Annie Tan, real-name praise) as long as there is a need to respond as soon as possible, it will also greet her every day if there is anything she can help. Appointing restaurants, calling shuttle buses, etc., can be described as very considerate.
*Hotel food:
    Our set meal includes breakfast and a coconut chicken hot pot dinner. Of course, there are other well-reviewed restaurants in the hotel (steak, Southeast Asian cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine, etc.) to choose from.
    Let’s talk about breakfast first. The breakfast buffet is roughly what you should have, but the seafood porridge and pickled powder are really delicious! Two bowls at a time are wiped out in minutes, so delicious! The coconut chicken hot pot is quite satisfactory. What bad thoughts can the hot pot have? We just want to fill our stomachs.
    Then there are two other restaurants in the hotel, Kandy (lunch) and Xi (dinner). The restaurants in the hotel all include service fees and the price must be higher than outside (don’t use this as a normal operation, you can order takeaways by yourself), Kandy, we just ate some outdoors after swimming. I ordered Margherita pizza and fried chicken, which are freshly grilled and fried. To be honest, they are surprisingly delicious. (Lunch is a little discount on some dishes~) Xi restaurant specializes in Southeast Asian dishes. We ordered shrimp cakes, assorted vegetables, grilled manta ray, Tom Yum Goong soup, Vietnamese pho, and a tomato meat sauce in the children’s menu. The noodles, there is no dish with thunder, the only minor flaw is that the grilled devil fish is a bit too spicy for us. We have a plan for the consumption of this meal, so the price is accepted. It is very considerate to buy a voucher under the guidance of the staff at the checkout.

*Overall summary:
    The experience of staying in this time is really good. Our family outing is also on the 10th anniversary. The special small decorations and small gifts of the hotel make us pleasantly surprised and warm. The photos that can be put are limited, but the details need to be calmly experienced, and I look forward to meeting again next year.

It is especially worth mentioning that Qiu Caixia, who is responsible for the cleaning of the guest rooms (I specially remembered her name brand!!), actively asked our needs, and intimately helped us to change to a double bed and a sofa bed, so that we would be two big two.

The front desk upgraded to a sea-view room, and also received gifts for the children. During the stay, all the staff were very enthusiastic. The hotel breakfast is also very exquisite. This is the hotel that you will definitely choose next time you visit. Finally, give special praise to Annie, refill!

msg:Known as a star-rated parent-child hotel, it is really speechless, the bathtub faucet is broken, and the extra bed is a sofa bed is also broken. Picture 5, the breakfast is very shabby, let me add some cuttlefish to the porridge and it gave me less than one-third of the weight for a night There is no shadow of cuttlefish in the porridge. Because there are few people, the variety of meals is very small. The children’s dining area is filled with biscuits, and there are almost no other fresh ingredients. After the response to the hotel, I gave me a letter of insincereness. I said I would send afternoon tea. I have already arrived at the MGM Hotel. I will definitely not drive back forty minutes to have afternoon tea. (Speaking of afternoon tea, it’s really not like afternoon tea. Sushi without shrimp and fish is made of sea**** rice, plus some soft drinks and bad-tasting wing roots. There are really very few pastries.) During the period, I asked for paintbrushes for the children. We draw, because there is only a half-cut pencil tip in the room, but the room service 3027 immediately asked me to find it, but I need a good comment from Ctrip. I really want to give it to this hotel although I don’t like this way of receiving good reviews. The facilities are very poor. The slides in the children's play area need to be paid 150 per person to play. In short, they are all charged internally. Is it crazy to have no money to make money? The room rate for this night is 1100 yuan. I stayed at Yanlord Crown 1688 for one night. The price difference is not much but the difference is too big. The services and facilities are not at the same level, although the listing is the same. The lawn on the roadside to the beach was not trimmed, it was messy, and we had to walk a long wooden plank road. After we walked down, there was no shower area where the sand was cleaned. This requires us to walk back with two babies, and the sand will be awkward. Both the Edison and Crown in Haitang Bay. There is a big difference. In short, the star and price are equal, and the services and facilities are not equal to this star and price! Bad review bad review! It is recommended not to stay at Shangri-La Hotel! It is understandable that there are few people in the epidemic, but when you live in Crown and MGM, do you really bear the star title? Should be downgraded, right?

The hotel is generally good! There are also archery, VR and other items, the charges are reasonable. After the child came back, he would never forget the children's tribe. Will stay in the future.

Internal environment: The room was unsatisfactory, with a damp smell. The first two-story garden-view room was full of trees and the quilt was a little wet. Then it was changed to the sixth floor of the Ocean Building. The light was better and the feeling of dampness improved. But the exchange process is still very time-consuming. The ocean building is very close to the swimming pool and the beach, which is very convenient.
Breakfast: Not bad.

There is a free shuttle bus every half an hour, so you can start shopping or exciting trips at any time. Now Haitang Bay is well developed than Long Bay and Dadonghai, and the beaches are also very beautiful and delicate! The service in the hotel is excellent, there are many intimate details, the fruits are delivered, the overall decoration style of the hotel is elegant, and the breakfast is also very rich. Very lucky to meet the manager Yan Ling André, he is very meticulous and patient, and provides us with very good service and help. Very perfect journey, sincerely recommend! The hotel is very large and has many entertainment facilities, which can meet the needs of the whole family, especially the children. Our room is very close to the swimming pool, and we always hear the laughter of children and family members! The hotel has a road leading directly to the beach, wake up early to watch the sunrise, absolutely!

There is no problem eating a branch for breakfast. Our two big and two little ones used the sofa as a bed just to sleep under it without any problem. It is more suitable for children. Whether it is a swimming pool or a children’s water park or a children’s adventure park, children can enjoy the hotel for two full days. Because there are three children's clubs, there is no need to worry about the age span. From the three-year-old brother to the 8-year-old sister, they all have a lot of fun. I went to the Jiangnan Xian Restaurant once and it was too expensive. Maybe I was too poor... So compared to the surrounding 68 Global Food City, a meal of two large and two small 400 is quite affordable. Because the hotel is too big to walk a few hundred meters from the beach, and the wind and waves are too big, in fact, children's experience of the beach is far less than that of Yalong Bay. But when the tide is low, blockbuster movies are easy to come out.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings: 1- Check in is a long queue, the efficiency is very low, the queue is an hour, and then told us to upgrade us to a house with a garden on the first floor, but when we entered, it was a connected room, and a door was locked next to it. , The other person can hear clearly; but the child was too tired and did not change the room; 2- After discussing the late check-out, I was told that it was OK, but after 12 o’clock, I left the door and came back to get the box card. , I need to find the front desk to activate and only give permission to open the door once, because I was told that it is a great blessing to give a full room today, and I feel less human; 3- The lobby club activities cost 400 yuan a day; although it is said that you can host several Hours, but 400 a day is a bit too much; 4- The service desk phone has never been able to get through; the aunt who cleaned up did not come to clean up at 12 noon, and felt that there might be a serious shortage of manpower in the peak season. Or put manpower on more charging items. Children want to eat popsicles. In addition to the 58 Haagen-Dazs, the lobby has no choice but to go to the surrounding 68 Food City. Finally, the family concluded that if the money is in place to choose the best room type and all meals are taken to the hotel, the experience will be very good. For us, the happiest thing is the child, and the others don't seem to be so completely satisfactory. But if the child is happy, the adult is happy. This is a kind of contradiction, isn’t it?

msg:I bought Ctrip’s two-day prestigious ocean view room package, and the butler amy contacted me before I checked in. I made some requests. Amy prepared a shell necklace for the child. She was very kind and thanked her for chatting with the child. When Shangri-La walked in, it was decorated by the hooh tribe. The large dolls interacted with the children in various ways at the door. It was obvious that the interaction was serious. The children were very happy. It was too difficult for the staff to wear a headgear on a hot day. I didn't register for hooh summer camp this time. In fact, I saw the activities of the summer camp later, but I was thankful that I didn't participate. The staff were very serious, but it was very tiring to see the children. It is recommended that if you hesitate to apply for summer camp, you can book the basic room type first and then decide there. After all, the hotel’s adventure park is enough for children, and the summer vacation is also free for hotel guests. We live in the Honorable Seaview Room, on the seventh floor of Building 3. The sea view is invincible, and the field of vision is particularly wide. It is estimated that the deluxe sea view rooms are on the third and fourth floors, and the scenery will be somewhat obstructed.
Talk about the obvious advantages: We are from Yalong Bay, and Shangri-La has a stronger sense of service. Seeing customers, they are basically answering hellos patiently. The breakfast is very rich, and the supplement is fast. Children aged 6-12 will also charge 99. You can purchase it for 89 yuan in advance on the WeChat mall. The children's adventure park is very big and the waiter is very attentive, and the child cried cordially and comforted. Going to Haitang Bay 68 is enough for dinner, and it's very convenient to order takeout.
Disadvantages: There is no introduction about the children's activities in the hotel. It is all on your own. For example, if there is a bubble row in the children's pool, you missed it, and the room was too slow. We checked in and waited until after four o'clock to get the room. The room you want Well, no one noticed, all on their own. The sanitation of the guest rooms seems to be pretty good, but cockroaches are found in the rooms on the seventh floor every day. I don’t know how the lower floors are.
Overall, it is a more attentive hotel, with strong parent-child features, and the price/performance ratio is much better than that of Atlantis.

Although the swimming pool is 1.1 meters deep, the water park is small but has two slides that are very suitable for children. The room is also very good and there is enough water. I don't need to buy water by myself! It is recommended to go to the beach at low tide in the afternoon. A mirror-like beach is beautiful to take pictures! There are also parks and large lawns in the park, as well as sand for children to play! More suitable for family trips, breakfast is also very good and there is a children's area! The only thing that makes me think it’s not perfect is that the front desk check-in is slow and others are good. I plan to come here again during winter vacation

It took us to drive more than an hour to four hotels, wasting time to take a taxi 150 from the airport. 2The hotel environment is good, there is a scooter that can pick up and drop off the room, and there is a beach not far away.It is beautiful. The breakfast is super rich, especially the children’s favorite juice bread area, there are also many tropical fruits. 3. On the last day of the morning, I also helped to pack a simple meal and bring it to the car. Swimming rings, bath towels and sand digging tools are available. You don’t need to bring your own. It’s very good. My son also made a small train. The room type we booked is very good. A large bed with a foldable sofa bed. Two children live on a sofa bed. The price is super cost-effective. high

Our exclusive housekeeper, Lemon, contacted us by phone and WeChat one day in advance, and immediately arranged for us to check in when we arrived at the hotel. There was no delay at all. After learning that the children were hungry because they were not used to eating airplane meals on the plane, they immediately notified the kitchen to prepare children's meals for the children, and they delivered them to the room very efficiently. It was packed on a special children's meal tray and was very delicious. The small hamburgers and French fries, the children had a great time, because we booked a suite, the hotel also sent a fruit plate from Oita, a delicious dessert platter and a bottle of red wine, in addition to the rich buffet breakfast , and additionally enjoy the buffet afternoon tea. The service of the butler is very considerate, and he asks us about our stay experience from time to time. There is not only a large green park with beautiful scenery, but also a beautiful beach. Parents can entrust their children to the club, and the dedicated staff will take the children to play for a day , my kids had a great time here. To be honest, if I come to Sanya for vacation next time, I will choose Shangri-La Hotel as the first choice. The service quality is helpful, and I also like the service of the butler lemon!

The staff was warm and thoughtful, Julie from the Guest Relations Depar**ent took the initiative to contact and help arrange early check-in, extra bed, late check-out, etc. The room faces the sea and has a good view. Picture 3 is taken from the room. In addition, the staff at the Cantiki Steak and Seafood Buffet Restaurant were also very friendly and instructed me to place an order at ** for a more favorable price.
The biggest advantage is that the rooms are very clean, and the swimming pool is also very clean, which is very commendable in high season. The room has plenty of drinking water, welcome desserts and fruits, minibar drinks and bath supplies are of good quality. There was even a bottle of champagne!
The water slides are so much fun that the kids can't stop thinking about it.
It is recommended to improve the dishes of the Chinese restaurant, although it is not bad, but it is not amazing. When we checked in, in order to be afraid of queuing, we went to the counter of Building No. 1 dedicated to Horizon Club. Who knows, it was very far away, and the doorman helped us push the box for a long time. It would be nice to have a motorized counter in the lobby for Horizon Club guests.

msg:This is our second stay in Shangri-La
Although the voice of Atlantis next door is very loud
But under various comprehensive considerations
We still love the choice 6 years ago
For parent-child travel
Choose a hotel with complete facilities
Can directly determine the quality of the holiday

Facilities: Including large and small swimming pools, indoor and outdoor playgrounds
This is what attracts us the most
Although the indoor park is small
But every project is fun
Especially vertical slides
But remember to wear long clothes and trousers for your child
Otherwise, don't let de
This is the hotel to protect the children
My husband is not obedient
Play the blue slide without wearing long sleeves
As a result, my arm got various bruises
The outdoor park will have a bubble bath at five o'clock
Children play crazy
The big swimming pool now has an electric floating board
No other shortcomings except expensive
98 yuan for 15 minutes
I have to play for a while every day
Every swimming pool has a security guard staring at it
They are still responsible
Basically I can free my hands
Let the kids play
The premise is that you have to wear float suits and swim laps for them
In addition, the room facilities are a bit weird
There is a lamp on the table
My eldest daughter can only take pictures of her with a flashlight while doing homework
Room sound insulation is very bad
We were bothered by the mother next door to train our son to sleep for two nights

Dining: Our room only presents breakfast for 2 adults
My eldest daughter is 7 years old, so I have to pay half price, which is 98 yuan, to eat
To be honest, what can't we eat for 98 yuan breakfast in Da Changsha?
Helpless she likes it
So I went to eat every day
Kang Tiqi’s buffet is still so expensive and unpalatable
Also makes me very speechless
We didn’t eat the delivered Polong after one bite
But the crayfish is ok
Wins in freshness
The waiter in this restaurant is still so snobbish
Also drunk
The fresh Jiangnan next door is Huaiyang cuisine
The taste can fade out of the bird
We wouldn't eat it if it wasn't for a gift
The nearby takeaway is ok
Improved from 6 years ago
In addition to 68 seafood street, there is also a grounded seafood plaza
You can also take a walk to eat at night

Service: I am most dissatisfied with the sanitary service of the room
I didn't take the initiative to do it
Call me every time
Sometimes the call will not come in time
Hygiene quality is even more unflattering
This really needs to be strengthened

Although imperfect
Overall it is worthy of recognition
Mainly the children have fun
They all said they want to live here for half a year
Also asked to come on holiday every year

Our room has an invincible view
Every time you open the door is a visual enjoyment
Sooner or later, you can go for a walk on the beach
Very good catch
PS: You should pay attention to the guerrilla photographers on the beach
I found one
200 yuan for more than 100 photos
After taking a hundred photos, it was too much, so we retreated.
He promised to take some sunset photos and silhouettes for us at night
result! He deleted me at night!
My husband said that when I was about 35 years old, I was so gullible about others, it was too short of socialist beatings.

There is not much vegetation on the road, and it’s a pity that there are no deck chairs on the beach. Except for afternoon tea, the Horizon Club has no snacks at other times, so I asked the waiter to bring out some biscuits and nuts. The front desk supervisor is still very efficient in solving problems, but unfortunately I found the wrong person to report the problem before and missed some activities. I accidentally found that Dragonfly Bar has a barbecue set and a resident singing. Unfortunately, I have already had dinner.

Later, I continued to live for another day, which was also very troublesome. The deposit was refunded and the deposit was collected again. Many simple steps became very prosperous.
Besides, the cleaning was done at 4:00 pm every day, and the cleaning aunt asked for a good review. I originally wanted to take a nap when I went back to my room, but she kept nagging me to give me a good review, and she woke me up. I finally got rid of it.

msg:The hotel facilities are relatively old. The Horizon Club that I stayed in was contacted by the butler one day in advance to understand the needs. It is really inconvenient that there is only one wash basin in the room. The toilet is still open and there is no door. Whether it is a family trip or a friend trip Slightly embarrassing. . . The hair dryer should be spit out, it's not easy to use it, and the hand can't be used, it can be blown by pressing it all the time. It is really fast and hotel style. .
The meal in the executive lounge is still very good. Maintained the consistent level of Shangri-La. . The children’s playground is also good. Wear socks, long trousers and long sleeves. Be cautious about safety hazards. Activities are also very rich. Overall it's pretty good. There are not too many people. It will not be very noisy.
The children's paddling pool closes at 7 o'clock in the evening. I haven't played for two days.

msg:The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, next to the Grand Hyatt Hotel that I have stayed in before. It has its own beach, which is also very clean. The breakfast at the hotel is good, with freshly squeezed orange juice, rich fruits, and snacks for children. The room was very clean, with children's bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, etc. Thank you Qiu Caixia and Chen Xiaojuan for providing us with a comfortable living environment. The butler Phoebe has strong professional qualities. From check-in to check-out, he provides every aspect of the service without any detail. When encountering unpleasant things, he also handles all problems in a timely manner. I give full marks to the service of this butler. Suggestions: 1 The hotel should build a step from the viewing platform to the beach. From the viewing platform to the beach, there is a very steep slope, which is a bit dangerous for children, and the beach is especially hot at noon. Keep going. 2. It is recommended that the hotel's infrastructure be inspected and replaced. The bed of 5709 creaks when I sleep, and I dare not turn over at night. In short, taking children to Shangri-La for a holiday is still a good choice.

In fact, I still think this age group recommends and recommends it! Although the slides in the adventure park are still not available, only older children over 5 years old can do it, but it is very friendly that the Horizon Club is too convenient to travel and eat. The children’s pool and sand pool have a large canopy to shade, and there is a baby downstairs. Breakfast and afternoon tea, 2 minutes walk to the sand pool and children's pool, 5 minutes to the beach! Thanks to the staff, Xiao Chen, for all the convenient and caring services, and prepared a lot of small gifts and fruit snacks for the baby, small bathrobes and children's bed surroundings, don't take your baby too easily! The Horizon Club administrative trea**ent is really rich. Although it is a platinum or top member of the other 3 hotel groups, I want to say that the administrative dishes here are the best, and the waiters are also very enthusiastic! In the children's pool, children's playground, seaside beach, main pool, and large lawn, there are all the laughter and laughter of the children. It is a very satisfying experience!

msg:I am very happy to choose the Shangri-La Hotel in Sanya for the first family outing after the epidemic. Due to the strict management of children’s kindergartens, they did not leave Shanghai during the Spring Festival and Qingming Dragon Boat Festival, and they all played in the city. This time, taking advantage of the island’s tax-free heat, stayed at Shangri-La Hotel. The Shangri-La Hotel in Haitang District is located between the Marriott and Atlantis Hotel. Diagonally opposite is Fengtang Road, where all kinds of delicious fruits can be eaten, and the location is good. Our stay this time was mainly for a hotel tour. The elderly and children enjoyed the swimming pool and the beach. It was very comfortable to be able to walk the beach at sunset at night. I would like to thank Li Zihao for recommending a suitable half-day trip to Wuzhizhou Island. As the Maldives of China, the water is indeed clear. Thanks again. Satisfactory breakfast in the hotel, a small train tour around the hotel, and swimming can satisfy the family’s leisure vacation. I will visit again next time. I met a lot of children from Shanghai at the hotel. We were very happy together.

On the first day when we arrived at the place where we were still unfamiliar, Li Zihao from the concierge took the initiative to take us to the hotel, remembering that it rained heavily one day, we just said that we were going to rush back to the room in the rain, but unexpectedly he drove to pick us up and sent us to the room floor under. The attendant in the swimming pool will also take the initiative to deliver dry towels to prevent the baby from catching a cold. The young ladies in the children's playground are also very enthusiastic and caring for the children. The waiters at the dinner buffet are responsive. The hotel also comes with many amu*****t projects, so you won’t be boring to spend a day in the hotel. There are a lot of supporting food, drink and entertainment in the surrounding area. After a few days of vacation, we all lingered, and the children were reluctant to leave, hoping to come again next time.

Activities also make children’s holidays full of laughter.
      We stayed in a luxury pavilion. The restaurant downstairs was very clean and comfortable. Whether it was breakfast or afternoon tea, it was rich and delicious.
       Coming to Sanya and living in Shangri-La are my best choice.

Asked for parent-child spares at the front desk, brought a child toilet ring, the bathroom has a stretch rope for a swimsuit, the balcony has a place for ironing clothes, the minibar has free orange beer, the children's playground has a large slide, suitable for the older children, there is a playground for the younger children, There are sometimes bubble parties in the pool and bonfire shows on Saturday night, but there are plenty of activities anyway, and you can choose to attend them if you are interested. Praise the service here, there is a shuttle battery car, almost always go, the little brothers are very hard, and they have to carry luggage, and they have to drive constantly, and they are particularly patient. I can't remember the name. I only remember one named Li Zihao. In addition, the waiter in the restaurant is also very good. There is a sister named Liu Frost. The recreation depar**ent should be the depar**ent of organizing activities. I saw two little brothers in long-sleeved clown clothes, ballooning, and sent my son a "baby sword". Look at them on a hot day. It's really hard to sweat, and the bonfire performance at night, Gui, Xiaoli, Ah Li, William, Several people are very hard-working, and also can mobilize the a**osphere, although son qian, neither dancing nor participating in the game, but brother william sent him a small gift, the little guy is still very happy. In short, the hotel is still great, recommended!

The service is really rubbish. Although it is Golden Week, there are not many people in the hotel, but the service I couldn't keep up at all, the room was not allowed to check in, it said that it was not cleaned, it would be fine for a while, just stood in the lobby and waited, and finally checked in and said to help deliver the luggage, but it didn't deliver after an hour, and the phone urged It took several times to deliver, the cleaning was not clean, the sofa was still wet, the large bath towel was not prepared, and I could only wipe it with a small towel after taking a shower. I checked out the next day and went to his house to check in. Shangri-La is here The ID card has not been returned, and it has been waiting for a long time. I have stayed in this hotel for so many years, it is really the worst experience! Oh, the complaint is useless, no one cares, this kind of hotel should close down sooner!

He has strong communication skills and strong execution ability. If there is a need, he can quickly help solve it. The service attitude is very good. I give the housekeeper Xiaolin a 5-star praise.

Things to improve:
1. The drain pipe of the washbasin in the women's bathroom in the Chinese restaurant is always blocked. I have been eating in the Chinese restaurant for two or three days in a row and it has not been resolved. It is not even as good as a food stall. I am really disappointed.
2. The speed and order of serving dishes in the Chinese restaurant is also unreasonable. The steamed Hele Crab was steamed for 50 minutes and still could not be served. The 4 waiters responded to us 4 times to remind us, ha ha. After eating one dish, another dish was served. The cafeteria in my unit was comfortable, so we had to go to the restaurant of the Atlantis Hotel instead.
3. Regarding the smoking situation in the hotel, it is clearly marked as a non-smoking hotel and non-smoking area, but there are still many guests smoking in the public area of the hotel. The most silent thing is that the staff will not stop anyone, and will not guide guests to go outside the hotel lobby Smoking in the smoking area, I really dislike such a management team, it is no longer the old Shangri-La, very disappointed.

1. I didn’t get the room until around 4:30 p.m., and I didn’t make any compensation. Ctrip also offered to invite afternoon tea, and Shangri-La didn’t make any compensation except for being sorry. May I ask if I paid the room fee in full, will I get the room when I am not registered?
2. The bathroom has a peculiar smell, which is really difficult
3. There are several swimming pools, only one place has towels, and there is no drinking water supply, are you afraid that customers will be poor?
4. Invoicing, for the sake of environmental protection, I said that scanning is fine, but the other party replied that it is not possible, and can only be mailed. What is the concept, mailing is more convenient than scanning? Simply ignore the needs of customers!

msg:三亞海棠灣之行選擇了香格里拉酒店，酒店管家Dora 提前一天聯繫我並幫我們安排提前入住，一進酒店Dora 就絡小朋友戴上了歡迎項鍊，帶領我們去前台辦完入住手續後還把我們送到房間沿路為我們介紹酒店的設施和活動，房間內部設施也比較新，因為是親子酒店，酒店準備了很多小朋友的活動，寶貝也是參加的特別開心，入住期間遇到的各種問題，Dora 都盡全力為我們解決，離開前一晚Dora還送了一份珍貴又貼心的禮物，寶貝説下次還想來！
在這裏還要特別感謝酒店工作人員韋日川先生，他用熱情周到的服務贏得了我們全家的認可！

綜合就是體現了老牌五星的標準服務！孩子玩的節目也很多…

設施：老店的好處就是應有盡有。

衞生：每天都會有人來打掃，並且是按照您的要求來的！帶孩子最關心的衞生問題也完全放心，廁所浴室乾乾淨淨。

環境：之前還擔心什麼被蟲咬和蚊蟲多，來了之後發現，衹要晚上不開窗，完全沒有看見蚊蟲。

每日豪華閣貴賓廊歡樂時光-暢享精緻小食、各式菜品及酒水:品種不多，但是下午茶足矣，玩累了餓了墊墊肚子也是夠了。

msg:住了3晚，一間叢林主題一間雙床房。
看了網上的評論，本來一直擔心這家酒店服務不行。但是我們這次遇到的酒店管家MAKA直接提升了我們入住的幸福感。
因為爸媽年紀大，媽媽腿最近又痛，和MAKA溝通希望兩個房間能夠挨着近一點。結果驚喜的是MAKA給我們安排了兩個直接相連的房間，升級了更好的房型。真的非常感謝！串門真的變得太方便了！拜託他安排的事情，MAKA真是沒個拉下的。小夥子長得也帥，工作也認真負責，非他工作時間都讓我們有事隨時找他！我們都其實不太好意思一直麻煩人家。
再來説説酒店，整體還是挺滿意的。小火車，騎馬，卡丁車，大草坪，海灘這些，我女兒都很喜歡。不過這個酒店適合5歲以上一點的。想約酒店的熱氣球，因為天氣原因説取消了。
主泳池水很乾凈，人也不多。
還贈送了旅拍，本來完全覺得可有可無的，結果拍出了很多好美的照片！早知道拍出來這麼美，應該再去海灘拍的。我手機自己拍的真是沒有一張是好看的。拍照這件事情，真的是一旦拍出來很美，就感覺整個出遊有了很美好的回憶。
覺得需要提升的是酒店的餐飲。第一天抵達，下大雨。直接在酒店裡麪吃的自助餐，不太想吃第二次了。
後面又吃了一次中餐廳，也是一般般。

整體的體驗已經很對得起放房價了，性價比還是挺高的。推薦推薦！再次感謝管家MAKA

管家Luke，把活動給我們介紹，很用心，還把我的兩個房間給升級了，排在隔壁，一大家人來玩，而且臨海特別容易出片，留下太多美景，值得下次再來。店還有豐富的休閑設施，泳池清澈見底，是炎炎夏日裏消暑的好去處。健身房設備齊全，小童的各種項目都超級滿意，泡泡排隊玩的根本不肯走，魔術課堂也很有意思、射箭滑索小火車都很棒，沙灘的各種活動真的讓人家眼花繚亂!
真的要給無限好評，酒店值得推薦，我明年還要來!

msg:總體印象：酒店房間確實比較老了（佈局裝修感覺），地形也很繞。酒店環境超級棒，去沙灘也比較近，活動豐富。
缺點：前台辦理入住超級慢，不知道在磨蹭什麼，早飯在哪吃、有哪些活動、房間怎麼走都沒跟我説！！不知道時間浪費在哪裡。 還有一小半工作人員精神狀態就是：要死的疲倦打工人，面無表情呆滯。。大部分還是很正常和熱情的。
優點：泳池很大，（收費的玩具有點多，價格偏貴），小童泳池滑梯什麼花樣也挺多的，大草坪拍照非常出片，早餐廳好吃！
親子玩的話項目超級多，管家可以直接預約，一天天玩的根本出不了酒店。

香格里拉雖然時間久但是並不會覺得舊很多的是經典。

親子活動很多。 酒店綠化很美。服務很好。不愧是香格里拉。

非常放鬆的一次旅行。

這次入住體驗非常完美，吃得好，住得好，玩得好。
Mister陳在我們入住前就詳細詢問我們的具體要求，入住後又時刻保持待命，響應快，還為我們解決了一些個人要求。
入住當天是我太太的生日，他們還給我太太準備了生日佈景、禮物和蛋糕。
房間打掃很及時，每次出門回來都很整齊。
酒店設施完善，沙灘躺了半天，泳池玩了半天，還有小火車遊園，有鴕鳥和小白馬可以玩，讓我的五一出行更完美

餐飲方面，酒店的餐廳提供了多樣化的美食選擇。無論是中式菜餚、西式料理還是海鮮大餐，都讓人垂涎欲滴。尤其是那些新鮮的海鮮，口感鮮美，讓人回味無窮。

此外，酒店還擁有豐富的休閑設施，如寬敞的泳池、設備齊全的健身房、舒緩身心的SPA中心等。這些設施讓我在度假期間能夠盡情放鬆，享受身心的愉悦。

總的來説，三亞香格里拉酒店以其五星級的奢華體驗、美麗的海景、專業的服務和豐富的休閑設施，成為了我這次度假之旅的完美選擇。我會毫不猶豫地推薦這家酒店給身邊的親朋好友，讓他們也能體驗到這裏的非凡魅力！

再説房間問題，因為房型降檔不給退差價，並逼迫我簽自願降檔 不退差價。
親子酒店就是噱頭，所謂的泳池滑梯，沒有趣味性，看人氣就知道，那片區域的人氣都沒有普通泳池高；萌寵樂園自己花錢買食物，就雞 豬和羊，沒必要跑到三亞去喂，
實名投訴值班經理吳達城，**一樣對我們大吼大叫，感覺像**更別説服務。
整體感覺酒店就是店大欺客，和我平時住的香格里拉差別很大。香格里拉會員不能享受會員權益也不能積分，但SPA卻有可以用積分兑換。
總結一句，但凡要酒店提供服務的統統找理由拒絕。
攜程整個過程中很不錯，都幫忙解決了
第一次差評，上圖純粹證明真實入住

⭐位置：酒店的環境非常好，坐落於海棠灣也很適合度假，距離免税店衹有2公里，酒店全天提供接送巴士🚌。吃飯去隔壁的環球68美食街也很方便，
⭐建議：酒店的動物園收費項目太多服務跟不上，作為酒店的外包公司，酒店應該也要抓他們的服務和檢查他們的產品是否符合香格里拉的標準，這樣才能讓酒店的配套更佳完善。劉經理再百忙之中回覆微信速度也很快，為人非常和善，這可能是我住過這麼多酒店碰到最好的酒店人。
