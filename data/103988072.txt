Many claimed that the location is far but hey, it's an oasis on its own - privacy,  excellent amenities and walking distance (20mins) to Tianya Haijiao !
Didi is readily available to go places and very affordable. I waited max 3 mins to go Sanya Romance Park and Nanshan Guanyin. I think,  both around 45mins drive. From Sanya railway station,  I think same too. 
Phoenix Airport is just nearby.  Location is perfect for me. 
Hotel is new and all are new and gives a luxury feeling to guests.  The moment you entered the hotel,  you are greeted with awesome sea view.  
One intern Sanjita (from Nepal) was onsite and she tried her best to make overseas guests at home.  Good job !
Oh..  there's no convenience store or shopping area nearby so please be prepared.

From the beginning Becky from the front office has accommodated every single requests, from transportation to anything we needed while we were staying there! The staff are just amazing! They always go over and beyond their duties to make sure we had a pleasant stay and we did indeed! Special thanks to Jeff to help us for all deliveries we ordered to the hotel and Kevin who came all the way to the airport to drop off our tablet which we forgot to pack in rush.

msg:I would like to start with disadvantages: 1. The pool was closed to renovation the whole time I stayed (9 days). As a compensation they gave me 100 RMB voucher for restaurant. So basically just one sandwich. 
2. They forbid swimming in the sea. I choose this hotel exactly for the private beach. But why do I need beach if I cannot swim there. The baywatcher always yelled at me even if I went to the sea to the level of my hips. It was very disappointing.
Now to the advantages: 1. The hotel gave me english-speaking manager Sanjita, very nice girl who helped me with any issues I had.  I am very thankful to her. 
2. The location is perfect for me, very far away from noisy and crowded places. The next bus stop is a beautiful park "At the world's end". Note that there are plenty of activities! So you can go back there regularly. 
3. Cool breakfast with anything you can imagine. 
4. The hotel provided me two gifts: one is a round trip to Duty Free Mall (NOTE: the prices are not duty free! There is a plenty of shops, but the prices are average or higher than in any other Mall). And the second one is a "free photoshoot", and yes, it is free if you choose only 5 photos. BUT! They retouch ALL of your photos. And suggest you to keep only 5 for free. Otherwise it's 80 RMB per photo. 
5. The Meituan delivery is automated, you don't need to search for your delivery guy - they send you a code for the delivery locker and you pick up your delivery any time. 
6. Very clean, very lovely room and inner territory. Very friendly stuff.

I came to Sanya with my bestie and wanted to go to Tianya Haijiao and Nanshan, so I chose the Hyatt Hotel to stay. We took a taxi to the hotel, and the doorman helped to open the car door and take the luggage. We checked in at the front desk, and the lady smiled and handled the formalities for us. Since our room is about 100 or 200 away from the lobby, and the weather is hot, there is an electric car to take us to the room, which is worth a thumbs upüëç. After arriving in the room, you can see the sea in the distance as soon as you enter the door. The whole person was instantly attracted by the beautiful scenery in front of him, and couldn't help taking a selfieüòÖ; the room was cleaned very clean, and it was very safe to stay; after checking in, the housekeeper Momo also took the initiative to ask if the room was arranged satisfactorily, and the room was very satisfactory; the overall service level of this hotel is OK, and everyone is quite polite; the hotel is in a relatively advantageous location, only a few kilometers away from Tianya Haijiao, and it takes only a few minutes to get there by taxi. In addition, the hotel also gave us free fruits. My girlfriends kept nagging for fruits. When we returned to the room, we saw fruits on the table. At this time, our foodie desire was really satisfied. Hahaha~ The beach near the hotel is also very beautiful. The photos are super good. It really shocked me. Because the flight took off late, the front desk also helped me to delay the check-out time, which was very good~ Finally, I am very grateful to the hotel staff for their enthusiasm, which made our trip unforgettable~

msg:Overall, I am quite satisfied, but the service awareness really needs to be improved.
The most abundant thing in Sanya is hotels. There are good hotels everywhere. I don't have to rush to stay in your hotel. It is really the worst service Hyatt I have ever stayed in.
The check-in was not smooth. I brought a lot of things with my children and the weather was hot. I couldn't find the order and said that there was no order. After a long time, someone came to find it immediately. Then, if the order was not found, this person was particularly condescending and said that your package does not include breakfast, and you need to pay separately. ? ? ? ? ? If you are not familiar with the business, don't come. What's wrong with the package? Why do you have so many packages when you look down on the package?
Okay, after these were resolved, I wanted to bring two more bottles of water back to the room, and the front desk immediately fell in face. It really changed in a second. God, the room rate is not cheap, what's wrong with giving two more bottles of water for two yuan? !
In addition to the attitude, other facilities are still very good. The hotel is also newly opened in the past two years and is well maintained. The swimming pool is quite large, and the children like it very much. It is also close to the beach.
But because of the attitude, I really won't choose it again

We just stayed here... It was so comfortable! When we checked in, we happened to be received by the Internet celebrity Nancy! She is beautiful and kind! She took good care of us these days! 
Facilities: The decoration is stylish and generous, with complete facilities, lobby bar, restaurant, gym, massage center, chess and card room, karaoke, and of course the most eye-catching and beautiful swimming pool! This swimming pool area is the most simple and a**ospheric swimming pool I have ever been to. The most important thing is that the design takes into account all ages and various needs. People who like swimming can swim freely, and children and the elderly can also have a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãshallow water to play in the water. There are lounge chairs around a circle, white lounge chairs in the shallow water area, lounge chairs with parasols on the shore, and dining tables and chairs, each with what they need! There are also vending machines selling drinks, beer, ice cream, etc., as well as power banks, and various swimming rings can be rented... 
Hygiene: Everywhere is very clean, and the cleaning aunts and uncles who tidy up the garden are very conscientious! 
Environment: Love it! The design of the whole hotel is very beautiful, and the environment is beautiful. It is very refreshing to have two drinks in the lobby bar after dinner!
Service: Special thanks to Nancy for her butler-like service throughout the whole process, which made us feel like we were back home. If you have any needs, just send a message on WeChat and she will reply and provide help in time! Also thanks to Sugar, Xiao Jia, and other staff whose names we don‚Äôt know in the restaurant (we think we can consider renaming the cafe as a restaurant to avoid misunderstandings). We had dinner here every day for four days, and the service was just right and comfortable! And Jia Jia and the Nepalese lady in the lobby bar! And the lady who cleaned the room! And the Harbin lady in the massage center! In short, I will come back next time!

msg:I have recommended it to friends who are going to Sanya. After staying in the hotel for so many days, the one night at Hyatt was the happiest! Generally speaking, Hyatt is very new and clean, and the service quality is also very good.

First of all, the hotel's swimming pool is very clean. There are few people in the off-season. I feel that I have not seen a few guests in the hotel for a day. The number of service staff is much greater than that of guests, and their attitudes are very good. The supporting facilities of the swimming pool are also very complete. I swam happily for an afternoon. I went back to the room to change clothes and continued to lie on the beach lounge chair to watch the sunset.

The sand on the beach is relatively fine and soft, which is a little worse than that of Mandarin, but I personally prefer the beach here because there are few people and the area is larger, but there are some green creepers that block part of the beach.

The travel photography sent by the hotel is also very good. It is the Earl travel photography. The guy is patient and aesthetic. The snacks in the cafe are also good, and the service attitude is very good.

Finally, I would like to thank Miss Nancy at the front desk for helping us upgrade to a sea view room in Building 6. She was very considerate from check-in to check-out, and sent us check-in precautions and weather forecasts. Thank you, she gave me a better impression of Hyatt~

I will stay at Hyatt again when I come to Sanya next time, and I will recommend it to my friends

msg:Highly recommended. A very cost-effective hotel. The housekeeper, Nancy, is very considerate. She greets and forecasts the weather every day. 10,000 thumbs up!! The beach of the hotel is average. I didn't stay there for too long, but I really loved this swimming pool. When it's not too hot, I can lie down all night! There is also this sea view balcony. It's so chill to wake up early and see the sea.

msg:The new hotel was renovated in 2023. The environment and hardware are quite satisfactory. Although the outside of the hotel is quite shabby along the roadside, the moment you step into the hotel, you instantly capture the hearts of the guests. It is unique and very impressive. It has the potential to go overseas. the illusion.

I booked two rooms. Since there are four adults and one child, and I have elderly people and children with me, I requested to be closer. Business is so good that the hotel has tried its best to arrange it. There are about 6 rooms separated by a distance. One room has a double bed and the other has a double bed. bed.

The hotel is committed to being a family hotel and a dog-friendly hotel. Personally, I think the positioning is quite broad. The interior design of the room is very American, but the 43-square-meter twin room is a bit small and easily hits the marble on the side. The 53-square-meter double room has just the right space. If you are bringing children, it is highly recommended to book a room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã53 square meters. The hotel also provides anti-collision *****s.

The reason why the hotel is relatively new is that the parent-child camp smells a little like paint. The design is in a log-style and has a lot of activities, both indoors and outdoors.

The quality of the hotel's breakfast is surprising. Although there are not many choices, the taste is good. There is even an area dedicated to local noodles, and the steamed ones are well received!

The hotel is in line with international services. When I checked in, I was contacted by the hotel housekeeper Nicole, who was very enthusiastic and could tell me if I had any needs. The staff repeatedly called to confirm the needs before checking in. The service was really a perfect score of 100.

When I checked in, I met Sanjita by chance. She was so kind as to give us a hotel tour, which allowed me to explore better. Thank you for the warm greeting.

The hotel has a shuttle bus and an independent beach (shares the same beach as Tianya Haijiao, there are no guards, so you need to pay attention to safety). During your stay in the hotel, the swimming pool and taking photos on the beach are also very nice.

The price is very reasonable now, and the swimming pool was under maintenance during my stay, so I gave me a meal voucher to make up for it.

All in all, it is difficult to find such a high-quality and cost-effective hotel in Sanya. The only drawback is that it is close to Phoenix Airport and there is often the sound of planes landing at night.

msg:Check-in experience is very NICEÔøº

Hyatt was just opened in 2013. The facilities are very new. It is very close to the Phoenix Island Airport ‚úàÔ∏è and the transportation is very convenient. On the day of check-in, due to the shortage of rooms, I had to wait for a while. Becky thoughtfully helped to upgrade the sea view room type. It was okay while I was waiting in the VIP Club. The lounge eunice is also really nice. Becky took care of me throughout my stay and I felt the hospitality.

The room is very spacious, especially the large balcony. It has a large outdoor swimming pool area and beach üèñÔ∏è. Since it is very close to Phoenix Island Airport, you can lie on the beach or swim while watching the ultra-low-altitude speed at close range‚úàÔ∏è

About 1 km from the hotel is the West Island Pier ‚õµÔ∏è which leads directly to the West Island. About 2 kilometers away is the ends of the earth. It can be the first choice for newlyweds or wedding honeymooners. Wedding photos should be very photogenic.

If you have enough time, you can go to the Nanhai Guanyin Scenic Area or the Big and Small Cave Sky. The 108m Guanyin statue is very spectacular and the scenic area is also very large, but be sure to note that ticket sales stop around 5:00.

All in all, a hotel with cracked wallsüè®

msg:Overall, I was satisfied with this stay.
Service: The housekeeper called me the day before check-in and added WeChat. Nancy's service was considerate. She arranged an upgraded room type and informed us of nearby attractions and hotel services. Jason at the front desk was very professional and nice. Sanjita at the lobby was very enthusiastic and took us around the hotel.
Facilities: ÔøºThe hotel's swimming pool is not small, the water is very clean, and the lobby design is very good, with a holiday feeling. Our room balcony is large and the view is beautiful, and the bathtub faces the sea view. ÔøºThe hotel's green plants are not as dense as other hotels I have stayed in, which is actually a good thing for me. I don't have to worry about geckos and big bugs when I sit on the balcony to enjoy the scenery. It's just that the decoration in the room is not durable. It's a newly opened hotel, and some plugs have loosened, and it feels that the maintenance is not in place.
Scenery: The upgraded room is on the eighth floor, with a perfect sea view and facing Tianli Bay directly. Tianli Bay, where the hotel is located, should be part of Sanya Bay. The beach and sea view of the hotel are very commendable, because the waves are not urgent, and you can go into the sea to play simply. The waves are slower than those in Haitang Bay, and it feels like Yalong Bay. Moreover, this is the hotel's private beach, so there are no tourists at all, only a few hotel guests, and it is very comfortable to play, and there is no garbage on the beach. There are also some reefs, which are very interesting to take pictures.
Breakfast: The hotel's breakfast variety is average, not as rich as the hotels of the same price I have visited, but the Hainan Yi noodles at the noodle stall are still delicious. The chef at the egg stall is more professional.
Entertainment: The hotel's swimming pool itself is fun enough, and it provides activities such as renting swimming rings and kayaks, but it's a pity that the swimming rings are not free. The hotel also has a family activity center with billiards and other things, TVs can be projected, and the mini bar is free.
Finally, let's talk about noise, which was my biggest concern before checking in, and I found it acceptable after checking in. We lived on the eighth floor, which was relatively high. After checking in and closing the door at night, I always felt someone pushing a cart outside. Later I realized that it was actually the sound of an airplane. The airplane probably disappeared after 12:00 in the evening. I don‚Äôt know if it was because I slept too deeply or there was no sound at all in the morning. I was not affected at all. I didn‚Äôt realize that there was a plane landing until about 10:00. Generally speaking, it didn‚Äôt disturb my rest, and I didn‚Äôt feel annoyed when I heard it occasionally. ÔøºIf you are outside the hotel, the sound of the airplane is more obvious, but in fact, I regard it as a scenery during the day. It is still very beautiful when the airplane flies over the roof. üòÇ.
Overall, I didn‚Äôt step on thunder. If you want to stay at the price of the package, it is still very suitable. I recommend everyone to choose a deluxe sea view room. The sea view is worth it.

4. In fact, the sound of the plane taking off and landing was completely ignored by our family of three, and it was not as exaggerated as the legend said. (It was not as loud as the sound of a large truck passing by)

It would be better if children were provided with sand digging tools.

msg:Very good experience! I did a lot of homework on this trip to Sanya. After some research, I chose this Hyatt, which opened last year. It turned out to be a great choiceüëç

A few days before check-in, Sharpay, a hotel staff, contacted in advance to understand the accommodation needs. The service was enthusiastic. During the stay, they also helped to arrange and answer questions. Finally, the hotel also provided free extra beds. Thank you very much!

The overall cost performance of the villa is very high, with rich fruit drinks, and it comes with a large and small swimming pool. The large swimming pool is ten meters long and one meter deep, which is enough for children to learn to swim. The baby has learned breaststroke these daysüòÑThe living room is large, and the activity space for a large family is very comfortable. Both bedrooms have their own bathroom and bathtub, complete facilities, and a lot of children's hygiene products. There are many breakfast options, and the complimentary VIP Club is also beyond expectations. The evening light meal is rich in ingredients, and vegetables, meats and desserts are all available. It is enough for friends who like Western food as a main meal. I hope it can be maintained!

The location of the hotel is also very good, ten minutes away from the airport by car. If the plane is delayed, you don‚Äôt have to wait at the airport. You can wait for the latest flight news in the hotel executive lounge. Although there is noise when planes fly over the hotel, it is not very frequent and can hardly be heard in the villa room. The hotel also provides earplugs. Light sleepers can wear earplugs and can not hear any sound at all and can sleep deeply.

The hotel also has a lot of children's activities, but it is more suitable for kindergarten children. The eldest child in the third grade at home will feel a little childishüòÜ

The family was very satisfied with the overall stay. It is 200% recommended. The child also said that he would stay here next timeüëç

I originally booked for two nights. I really liked it, so I extended it for another two nights. I stayed for a total of four nights. I have locked this hotel in Sanya!
Teddy, the face of the hotel lobby and the crown prince of the hotel, is really very gentle and endearing! My little one is so lucky to be able to play with Fa Zui!
There are pet-specific rooms, pet-specific cribs, toys, water cups, rice bowls, dog kennels, etc.
There are litter bags and trash cans everywhere in the hotel, which is really convenient!
It has a large area with all kinds of beautiful flowers and plants, as well as coconut groves. It's like a garden. It's beautiful. You can even go down to the beach. It's a paradise for dogs!
You can also eat breakfast with your dog and sit outside to eat, which is really considerate!
The room is very clean and tidy, and the sound insulation effect is also very good.
The bath water is also very strong, making it a pleasure to take a bath.
The hotel's swimming pool is large and has many shallow water areas, which is especially suitable for children to play in the water. The swimming pool is also beautiful. There is a big whale next to it!
I personally think the Hainanese noodles (soup noodles) for breakfast are super delicious. I once ate three bowls of them in the morning...
Enjoy daily soft drinks from the minibar: There are four drinks from Coconut Tree every day, especially Hainan specialties~all delicious.
I was given tickets to the West Island as a gift, but I was too lazy to go.
Save this regret for next time!
I will definitely stay at Hyatt Regency Tianliwan next time! !

In addition to the butler service, the catering service is also a level higher than when it first opened, and the quality has also kept up. I can recommend it with confidence.

msg:A very pleasant stay~
I booked the hotel temporarily due to flight delays. When I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the enthusiastic Kira Li Tingting. Knowing that I had booked a trip to West Island, she recommended a lot to me and upgraded the room. I tried the swimming pool and the cafe, which were both good. The hotel itself is close to the airport, and the sound of planes taking off and landing is obvious, but it did not affect my sleep at night. I slept very comfortably. The package also included travel photography, and I also selected the photos I liked. Recommend it, recommend it

When I arrived at the room, the mini bar was empty, and I called the front desk to replenish it.
It has its own independent beach, but the quality of the beach is very average, with co**** sand and yellow water.
Pet friendly.

What's even more outrageous is that the cleaning staff knocked on my door at 9:30 in the morning to clean the room. I really don't understand what's going on. It's very close to Tianya Haijiao, the scenery is OK, but the hygiene standards can be improved.

Well, I originally thought that a hotel without an amusement park might not be very parent-child friendly, but I didn‚Äôt expect that I told the housekeeper Nancy that I was bringing children before check-in, and she added services throughout the whole process.
Before check-in, I told her that there were children, and she reserved a room in advance and checked in very early;
Prepared children‚Äôs toothbrushes, bath towels and slippers for the children, and they were all 2 sets, and also thoughtfully made a secondary bed guard
There are also activities for children. Although there are many people on holidays, we were still added to the online appoin**ent even though it was full

The hotel has many parent-child activities, basically covering indoor and outdoor, the swimming pool is also very friendly to children, and there is a special area on the beach with chairs and parasols, which is convenient for children to play all day. It‚Äôs good, better than expected, and the children said they will come again next time

Before I came, the hotel's Xiao Leng added me on WeChat to ask about room preferences, etc. The overall feeling was the same as last time. The employees I met were all proactive in offering help. The lifeguards at the swimming pool watched the children playing in the water more seriously than we parents. The room was often replenished with soft drinks, and if anything was missing, they would call us and deliver it to us very promptly. I saw some people complaining about the hotel's beach. In fact, I have to praise this beach because it is not a bare beach. It is really suitable to bring children here to pick up shells and catch small sand crabs.

Breakfast was normal, but the portion and taste of their dinner set surprised me. I feel like I can just lie down in the hotel the whole time next time I come.

I arrived at around four o'clock. When I checked in, I was told that the room had not been cleaned yet. The front desk sent me a message before they were able to find a room.
Then I wanted to relax and take a bath in the middle of the night. After draining the water, I just lay down and found that the water leak was gone and the bathtub was leaking! !
Here comes the point! I called customer service twice and was told to send someone over to check, but no one came for 30 minutes. The first time I went downstairs to question, the front desk told me that someone was on the way and had already arrived at the door. Then I ran upstairs again. There was no one, so I went downstairs for the second time to question him, and he was told that he really hadn't come, and that he was urging me. I got mad, and there was a service person at the front desk who was a little unhappy and said that he would serve alone that night. Laughing dizzy! For such a big five-star hotel, there is only one service staff at night, right?
Then the service staff came just now and found that the bathtub was indeed broken. Hahahahahahaha, it made me laugh angrily.
In the middle of the night, the manager came and explained for a long time, only saying that he would send me to the airport the next day.
There is really no way to leave a negative review without conscience, the service is a mess!

The hotel doorman took the initiative to help with the luggage. We upgraded the room for free at the hotel. It was clean and tidy, with latex pillows to choose from. There were many things to play in the hotel, including table tennis, table tennis, various chess games, mahjong for 3 hours a day, KTV for 1 hour a day, and Beach volleyball beach soccer. It's next to the West Island Pier and it's convenient to take a taxi.
shortcoming:
The biggest problem is that the aircraft is very noisy, which greatly affects your rest.
Secondly, there are few breakfast categories, and there are few executive courtesy meals and lack of staple foods and soups.
There is only one restaurant in the hotel and it only provides set meals. There are few food options around, making it inconvenient to eat.
Overall, if you don't consider the noisy plane, the price-performance ratio is still very high, but I won't choose to stay here again.

It's a pity that we didn't see the hotel's welcoming ambassador, because it was a weekend when we went there, and it is said that dogs have a weekend off [naughty] The hotel is very close to the airport, which is very convenient sometimes.

First, we checked into the hotel. The concierge gave us a warm welcome, carried our luggage, greeted us and took us to the front desk to check in. I'm glad that the room was upgraded and it met the children's needs.
The hotel is very big, and the seating area outside the lobby bar is really big, and you can see the swimming pool and the sea. I feel so happy beyond words.
The hotel üè® is very big and the greenery üíê is very nice. When I came to my room, I liked it very much. The room is large and bright, with new facilities and equipment.

The room is equipped with a lot of things for guests, including coffee, fruit, and iced drinks in the refrigeratorü•§. The service attitude of the waiters is very good, and the requested items are delivered in time. Thumbs up üëç.
You can see the plane from the balcony‚úàÔ∏è, this feeling is still very magical, friends who like it can come and experience it (there is no noise in the room I live inü•∞)
I left the charger in the room when I checked out, so I contacted you promptly and sent it back by express deliveryüòÄ.
You can go for a walk on the beach. When the weather is nice, the sunset will shine on the seaüåä
After all, it is a big brand hotel. The overall price/performance ratio is very high. It is good. I will come back next time.
Thank you for the service when you checked inüëç
I hope the hotel will get better and better and the business will be boomingüßß

msg:This is my first time staying at this hotel. The hotel is very good and I recommend it to everyone in need.
Facilities: The hotel is very new and has an excellent viewing location. It feels like you have a bay all to yourself. The room we stayed in was large, clean and comfortable. Welcome fruits and knives and forks were already placed on the table in the roomüç¥. This kind of service made me feel very considerate. There is a bathroom with separate wet and dry areas in the room. What makes me most happy is that there is a large bathtub to meet the needs of my children. Please call me for two more bottles of mineral water. The butler's service is also very kind. The bedding is clean, the bed is big, and there may be more places to stay, so there will naturally be contrast. Thumbs up for this üëç. The balcony of the room is very large, and it is also a pleasant enjoyment to sit on the sofa on the balcony and have a cup of coffee (there is a coffee machine in the room).
Hygiene: The room is generally clean and refreshing. All necessary supplies are complete. I went to the entertainment center on the first floor. There are pool tablesüé±, table tennis tablesüèì...etc., which are all very good.
Environment: The hotel is not far from the airport, but there was no sound of planes flying over the room I stayed in, which was pretty good. I can also take pictures of passing airplanes on the lawn outside the lobby bar, which gives a great visual sense. Walking out from the first floor is the seasideüèùÔ∏è. If the weather is good, you can see the beautiful sunsetüåÑ. (But in a tropical place like Sanya, you must pay attention to sun protection and mosquitoes. Hehe, my own advice)
Service: From the doorman helping me with my luggage, to checking in at the front desk, and meeting the room attendant on the floor, everyone was very warm and said hello. The hotel has good leaders, and the employees' services are all professional.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is high, the afternoon tea in the lobby bar is also very good, and the breakfast is quite satisfactory. Anyway, it‚Äôs best if both adults and children are happy. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Sanya. Then change the room type and experience the beautiful scenery from another angle! ü••üèñÔ∏èüèä

Noise: We live in Building 5. When the doors and windows of the room are closed, the noise is heard every few minutes throughout the night until 3 a.m. and continues at 6 a.m. You can imagine the scene to see if you can fall asleep.

Bedding: We have been in Sanya many times, staying at the Ritz-Carlton/Sun Bay Park Hyatt/Atlantis/MGM/Shangri-La/Sheraton/Hilton/Conian, etc. The bed of Hyatt Tianli Bay The quality is the worst, not because of the aesthetics, but because of the comfort, especially the pillows, which are the last. My wife and I feel extremely uncomfortable in our shoulders and necks when we wake up in the morning. It‚Äôs so bad.

Breakfast service: As a five-star hotel and it has passed the Spring Festival, there is still a queue at the breakfast door to call the number. There is still a queue at the door at 9:30, which really surprised me. After careful inspection, it was found that the restaurant's cleaning service could not keep up. No one was clearing the tables that came out. Only the waiter at the door who was directing the queue asked ho****ly if anyone wanted to sit outside.

Restaurant facilities: The front end of the chair was wet, and the waiter did not check and handle it. See the picture for details.

Breakfast variety and quality: Needless to say, just look at the pictures of the food on the meal trays. They are basically empty. This five-star rating is acceptable...

Summary: The service in the guest rooms and restaurants is far from five-star. The hygiene of the guest rooms and restaurants is not up to standard, and the sleep quality is poor. You need to choose carefully.

The overall environment of the hotel is very good. There are many entertainment projects even if you don't leave the hotel. You can go directly to the beach through the swimming pool and lawn. There are few people and it is quiet. There are beach chairs everywhere to rest on.
Overall, it was a very good experience and very cost-effective. I will book again if I have the opportunity.

I didn‚Äôt check the prices on other platforms, but when I asked, they said they were all at the same price. It was better to book in advance, so I just booked it. It was decided. As a result, I was notified that I had been upgraded to a double room after I arrived. Because I had a child, it was very inconvenient. I didn‚Äôt want to change rooms in the first place, and I talked a lot of nonsense about the extra bed. After I arrived, I was still upgraded. We were sent to the same type of double bed room on the 7th floor, which was arranged in advance, in Building 6. We couldn't see anything. It was the most remote building and it was said to be upgraded. The room also had a strong smell because there were a lot of things with children. I didn't change rooms back and forth, I just opened the balcony door, but the air conditioner couldn't be turned on. The next day, I accidentally caught their ** live broadcast. It was in our building 6. The same room was a garden view room, for sale 699, a sea view room for three nights is 2099, and it is the current price. I am really speechless. The most important thing is that I am speechless for spending such a high price. The hotel facilities are very good, but the service of the staff Just forget about this type of so-called upgrade. Also, the prices are too inconsistent. Let‚Äôs compare. Currently, it‚Äôs the cheapest.

Warm and thoughtful. I am very satisfied with this stay in every aspect.

He is really thoughtful and dedicated when he can remember the customer's check-in time and ask about their experience. Special thanks to Sharpay for your care. The hotel environment is very beautiful. The whole family was very satisfied with their stay and had a great time. It's a very nice new hotel. It is very suitable for parent-child travel, and there are also many parent-child activities in Yuequ Camp. The hotel swimming pool is large and clear. There is also an exclusive private beach. The beach under the sunset is very beautiful. The beach under the sunset is really beautiful. If I have the chance next time, I will definitely come back to experience it. It is a hotel I want to stay in again. It is suggested that the hotel restaurant can develop more food items and the breakfast can be richer and more choices, so that staying in the hotel can solve the problem of three meals a day, because there are really no shopping malls around where to go and eat. All in all, I am very satisfied with this experience and will come again next time‚ù§Ô∏è

The hotel provided two breakfasts and one full meal, which was very high-end and elegant. It also provided a complimentary Earl Travel Photography. The boy took so good pictures that I added ten more pictures. Special thanks go to Jeff Wang Jing, our housekeeper. He is a local guy from Hainan. He is always available and will pick you up by car just a few steps away. I feel like I am about to become a socialite. Hahahahaha. He made an appoin**ent for us before leaving.

However, the plane will pass over the hotel when it lands, which is a little noisy. The sliding doors of the hotel balcony are made of super thick double-layer glass and have good sound insulation. It is not too noisy when the plane flies over. Overall, I am satisfied!

Since the previous customer service staff ended their internship, I would like to thank the new service manager Sharpay for his enthusiastic service. Maintain Hyatt's standards and enthusiasm for guests, help follow up on room arrangements and introduce relevant information. They also pay very considerate attention to your needs and respond to messages in a timely manner which is very reassuring. The hotel cafe has a small variety of food. It is recommended to increase the variety or have a buffet dinner option. The hotel is also very cost-effective. If there are no other itinerary arrangements, I will not change to other hotels midway. It is very suitable for a treasure hotel to take a vacation. Sanya Tropical Hotel has a hotter climate. Summer is here, and it is also recommended that the hotel provide toilet water, some sprays for mosquito bites, etc., which should be used later. I hope the hotel will get better and better...

The swimming pool was also very clean and towels were plentiful. The cafe has a consumption limit of 300, so it is no problem for two people to have a meal. I would like to express my real-name praise to the chubby lady who helped with ordering at noon on the 26th and the chef who worked hard on cooking. They gave me a bowl of extremely light and delicious mushroom lettuce!
I will consider this hotel next time I come. It is very close to the airport, so there is no time to worry. There is a little noise from the planes flying over, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if the quality of sleep is good!

It‚Äôs clean and ok because it‚Äôs a new hotel, but there was a Xiang beside the parking lot! ! When I came to Hyatt from Westin Wanning, I had two service attitudes and methods. The management can only be said to be a newcomer, very lazy and inefficient. There is no service at all. I didn‚Äôt know the way around and met 5 employees. After asking, three of them didn't know the way and one pointed in the wrong direction. Only a cleaning lady took me to the right place. The doorman guided me down to the basement, and I found that there was no way to get to the hotel's accommodation, so I had to drive up and find a place. The waiters and chefs in the restaurant spend more time chatting with each other than serving. When asked to get the baby high chair, they would not think of getting the dinner plate. The hotel's facilities are new. There is a bit of formaldehyde smell on the first floor, but why is the bathroom made of transparent glass and facing the frosted bathroom? Do people in standard rooms have to be honest? There is a protrusion in the balcony door design, and I accidentally bumped it twice. It is a strange designüò¢üò¢üò¢. There are many activities for children. The one star for service is for children's activities. It is the first time I have written so many things. It is not a five-star experience. I just went to a five-star attraction.

During this period, I went to Yalong Bay for a few days and the experience was average, so I changed my itinerary and returned to the Hyatt I had longed for. The most intuitive feeling of the newly opened hotel is that it is spacious, clean and comfortable. The green plants in the hotel are much lusher than those in the previous pictures posted in the comment area. There is no children's playground here, but it is the most family-friendly place. The wide and clean beach and swimming pool are enough for a family to play together. There is also a professional children‚Äôs activity center, Beiye Planet, which has various indoor and outdoor parent-child activities. You can participate for free by making an appoin**ent in advance at the hotel. If you want to go shopping in Haitang Bay alone, you can also choose paid full-service activities to leave your children with peace of mind. To the planet Kaiye. The only restaurant in the hotel is in the cafe. Yellow croaker with sour plum sauce, baked Wenchang chicken with beetroot leaves, seafood rice and steak, etc. are all delicious and the portions are sufficient. Abalone is also a specialty, which is far superior to the surrounding Internet celebrity restaurants. The restaurant is freshly baked every day. The bread and various exquisite desserts in the lobby bar are also highly recommended. The baking level is very high and the ingredients are naturally flavorless. This is a pet-friendly hotel. The guests with dogs are of good quality. The hotel is cleaned in a timely manner. The rooms are clean every day and the glass is shiny. I met many sincere and kind staff here, and I would like to especially praise Sharpay Wu Haili from the guest service depar**ent. Before checking in, she called to inquire about her needs and actively added WeChat. She prepared children's supplies in advance and arranged a room with a great view. It was even a pleasant surprise that the room we arranged to stay in twice was the one next door. Sharpay shared the weather every day and made every reservation for the SPA. She knew that her children liked the hotel‚Äôs welcome dog, Fuzhi, and specifically informed Fuzhi‚Äôs working hours. Our children have to do it every day. I went to the lobby to "encounter" Fa Zui, and even went for a walk with Fa Zui on the beach to think about Wang Sheng. Fa Cai was once a stray dog ‚Äã‚Äãuntil he was adopted by the general manager of Hyatt and miraculously turned into a hotel star. It is very well-behaved, quiet and does not bark. It understands bilingual commands in Chinese and English. It can even catch crabs. It is so good. We didn't leave the hotel for several days, and the family just enjoyed the slow time. Although it is not perfect, the hotel is very close to the airport and you can often hear planes flying over. Watching and counting planes is also a fun thing for children. We worked overtime until the last day to say goodbye to us. Anyone who has raised small animals will understand this feeling. Each flower attracts each eye, and the Hyatt Regency Tianli Bay, which has its own bay, is the hotel we will choose for our next vacation in Sanya.

There is also the same reef Cyndi Wang took photos on at the beachü™®, and there are also pink dolphins which are really girly. The decoration of the hotel is not luxurious, the overall feeling is more casual, and I was quite satisfied with my stay. Thanks to the dedicated butler Sharpay for arranging the room and paying attention during the stay. He was very considerate and asked about the stay experience. He was very responsible and attentive in his work. The hotel rooms also provide coffee machines with coffee capsules. Breakfast is buffet style, and lunch and dinner focus on Cantonese and Hainanese dishes. The entertainment center also provides free KTV that requires reservation in advance, as well as billiards and chess and card rooms. It is also very suitable for staying in the hotel every day and not going out for fun. The hotel's value for money is also very suitable. I will come back to experience it if I have the opportunity next time I travel ~

msg:Three years after the epidemic, I came to Sanya for a family trip. I looked online for a long time and made a choice. Finally, I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tianliwan. I'm really glad I chose this place. When the weather is nice, the private beach, the beautiful glass sea, and the coconut trees under the sunset. You can't help but feel the beauty of nature gathered here! Definitely the number one bay in Sanya in my mind!
Because it was a family trip, the hotel specially arranged adjacent rooms for easy care. Close to restaurants, pools, beaches. Traveling is very convenient. It is very comfortable to play in the swimming pool, and the staff will also take the initiative to provide dry bath towels when passing by.
There will also be staff who will take the initiative to say hello, and when leaving the store, there will also be guys who will help carry your luggage to the car. Enjoy the high quality of hotel services.
       The hotel's facilities are also complete, including gym, SPA, entertainment center, KTV, etc. The view from the guesthouse is very good. Although it is on the 6th floor of the main building, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful sea. The food is also good, very good An experience. Finally, I would like to thank the butler Xiao Lu for his exclusive service. I will definitely recommend it!

There are deck chairs and pink dolphins that are very eye-catching. The hotel is surrounded by Tianya Haijiao, West Island and Tianya Town, where you can go and check in. By the way, the drinks in the hotel room are also very delicious. The room is located in several buildings. If you live far away, you can also arrange a battery car to pick up and drop off.

Tianli Bay, where the hotel is located, is in the Sanya Bay area, next to the West Island Tourism Service Center, and the hotel gave away ferry tickets. West Island has a very lively a**osphere. Residents have separate ferries and docks, and the consumption is not too high. There are old fishermen‚Äôs houses from a hundred years ago preserved with coral reef walls, which is very interesting. We also took our children to visit the Women‚Äôs Militia Memorial Hall to receive red education.
Back to the hotel, all aspects of management are in place. The beach is particularly good, with some rocks. I like it very much. The swimming pool is also very large. There is a shallow children's play area. The children had a lot of fun?

Hygiene: Hygiene is also good
Environment: Because it is a new hotel, the trees have not grown well, and the resort environment is not as good as a mature hotel.
Service: The service can be improved further
1.Butler service. The butler Xiaoyou will contact you in advance to arrange a room, and the butler service is good.
2. Room service. Generally speaking, the tent in the room was blown, and three waiters came back and forth but failed to provide a solution. At around 9 o'clock in the evening, they told me that it could not be repaired. No corresponding solution was given, resulting in a somewhat poor experience. Note: Two latex pillows and one buckwheat pillow are required, but latex pillows are placed in both rooms.
Catering: There are not many types of breakfast, but it is slightly different every day, which is acceptable

It has a gym, a spa, a children's paradise, a swimming pool, an entertainment center, chess and cards, table tennis, and a KTV. Children spend more time sleeping, so they can play in the hotel. The room is more convenient for sleeping, and the private beach at the wine shop has pink beach chairs and dolphins. The hotel room facilities are also very complete and everything is very convenient. If you have children, you can ask for a bed surround for safety and peace of mind. Breakfast is also very rich. I like the croissants very much. They are delicious.
The main purpose of staying here is to be comfortable, but unfortunately I only stayed for two nights. You must book early during the peak season.
In addition, it is very close to the West Island boarding boat, and it only takes 13 minutes to walk with the baby stroller. It's also very close to Tianya Haijiao, about 20 minutes' walk or a few minutes' taxi ride. However, the outside of the hotel is relatively deserted, so it is not convenient to eat outside. However, many seafood restaurants include pick-up and drop-off for five kilometers, so there is no problem at all.
Finally, I would like to thank Becky at the front desk for being very considerate.

It might be because there were more people during the Chinese New Year, and because we didn‚Äôt book a twin room, the hotel had full quilts and no extras were provided. They could only provide emergency sheets, which is understandable. . The only thing I am satisfied with is Sharpay Xiao Wu‚Äôs service quality, which is the highlight of my stay experience at Sanya Tianliwan Hotel and the place where I feel warm. Not only does she have a solid hotel expertise, Xiao Wu‚Äôs communication skills are particularly outstanding. She can quickly Understand customer needs and provide appropriate suggestions and solutions. This efficient service method not only saves customers' time, but also significantly improves customer satisfaction.
In general, Sharpay's timely remedies and solutions make up for the hotel's other service deficiencies. At the same time, because of her, we will trust Tianliwan Hyatt again next time our family travels. We look forward to the new hotel getting better and better next time. Come again.

msg:For the last stop of this trip to Sanya, we chose the Hyatt Regency Tianliwan Sanya. The priority is to be close to the airport. The return trip is more convenient. Of course, being close will also be affected by flights. If you have a very light sleep quality, it may not be suitable. The room is The sound insulation is pretty good. I am also very grateful to Sharpay Wu Haili from the guest service depar**ent for calling in advance to confirm the arrival time and needs, and sharing information about the hotel and surrounding attractions. Since I was not satisfied with the room arranged before check-in, I actively coordinated the change and the process was relatively fast. I am very grateful to Sharpay for his coordination and attention during the stay and arranging the airport drop-off. I am very satisfied with the service. In addition, I was quite satisfied with my stay in the room. The hotel also has a dedicated beach. The sand is not very fine, but it does not affect the overall experience. The rocks on the beach are also very unique, and it is also the same shooting spot of Cyndi Wang. I will stay here again for a few days if I have the chance next time. The overall experience is very good and I recommend it to suitable tourists.

Not only does she possess professional hotel management knowledge, but her serious attitude towards work and passionate care for guests demonstrate her excellent qualities as a hotel employee. Her presence made my stay smoother and more pleasant, and she actively handled and coordinated the needs of the customer group. Sharpay Xiao Wu's service spirit is worthy of praise. Her professionalism, enthusiasm and thoughtfulness have won the hotel a good reputation. I believe that with employees like Sharpay, there will be more and more hotels.
In addition, the hotel's environment is also very beautiful, and the newly opened hotel facilities are very new, which is worth recommending.

The hotel environment is okay, the sound insulation is very good, and you can't hear the roar of airplanes in the room. The facilities of the new hotel are very complete. There are three charging sockets at the bedside, which is very convenient. The staff's service is very average, and it feels like they are on duty without training.
The swimming pool is clean. There are no water toys provided by the hotel. You have to rent them from a swimsuit store.
There are very, very few types of afternoon tea in the executive lounge (one kind of cake and two kinds of biscuits). Breakfast is eaten in the restaurant on the first floor. There is almost no one to finish the dishes. There are very few types but the taste is okay (boiled rice noodles can be added with sour bamboo shoots) Choose, snail fans‚Äô heads are ecstatic).
Opposite the hotel is West Island. The beach is harsh but the rocks are beautiful and the sea breeze is very comfortable.
Overall, it's okay. The advantage is that it's close to the airport. I'll probably stay at this hotel as the first hotel after landing on my next trip.

The breakfast in the restaurant tastes good, with more Western-style ones. It is recommended to add more special dishes. It is also recommended to increase the variety of dishes in the lounge.
There is a problem with the hotel's circulation design. It is definitely the fault of the designer. The check-in suite is in Building 5, the elevator is in the middle, and the room is near the lobby and swimming pool. You still need to walk to the elevator, get off the elevator and then walk back to the lobby. The whole A waste of leg energy. Otherwise, you have to take the stairs from the 5th floor, which is not friendly to babies in strollers, but it is fine for older babies. My older baby takes the stairs every time he goes to the swimming pool. But the higher the floor, the better the view and the better the scenery, there is no way to have both. There are few things to play in the children's playground.
But the most satisfying thing is that there are not many people, it is very quiet, full of vacation feeling, and the beach is not bad. There are fewer people than Long Bay and less wind and waves than Haitang Bay.
Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay.

Generally speaking, this place is suitable for lazy people who like to hang out in hotels. The breakfast was also delicious, overall there were no shortcomings. To put it bluntly, shopping is a little far away and you need to take a taxi to the city. It takes about 20 minutes to drive to the city center. The surrounding Tianya Haijiao and the West Island opposite the hotel are all worth checking out. It is very exciting üëç Recommended...

If there was no room available on the 4th, I would stay for another three days. First, I feel that the entire hotel is very relaxing for me. It is very relaxing to sit on the balcony and walk in the park. Because it is a new hotel, the entire hotel including the rooms is clean and bright. The feeling of not being able to find a single fault is really great. The second point is that there are too many activities in Yuequ Camp. My daughter is confused whether to go to Yuequ Camp or to the beach every day. Third, the beach is so close, which is very important to me as a child. The beach is beautiful, and there are different beauties at different times. Finally, I would like to praise the concierge Aze. He is the only one among the five hotels who called me in advance to communicate my needs and implemented them. As soon as my daughter entered the room, she said, "Mom, you must give me a good review, because the children's toothbrushes, children's slippers, and cribs are all ready." It‚Äôs really great.

After checking in, he also helped book a hotel package; the hotel is located very close to Tianya Haijiao, and the ferry terminal to the West Island is on the east side. It's very close. It's more convenient to go to the Nanshan tourist area than the city. The most important thing is that it's close to the Phoenix Airport. You don't have to worry about traffic jams when you go to take a flight. You can basically get there in 15 minutes. The overall environment of the hotel is very good. The lobby is large and you can look out. From the swimming pool, you can see the sea from a distance. I live on the top floor of Building 2. The sea view is very good because it is very close to the airport and the aircraft channel passes just above the hotel. Those who like to watch airplanes can enjoy it. When the take-off and landing density is high, it takes a few minutes. A plane flew overhead. All rooms in the hotel face the sea, and the other side is an open corridor with mountain views. Therefore, the noise of the plane is indeed quite obvious, and it won't affect your rest after getting used to it. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry. During the nationwide cold wave, it was also a bit cold in Sanya. I went for a swim in the swimming pool in the afternoon, and the water temperature was still a bit cold. There is a coconut garden on the south side of the swimming pool, and across it is the sea beach. The sand is relatively fine. There have been strong winds and waves these days, and the scenery is beautiful. Wedding photos are taken here every day. You can see the West Island directly across the sea (you can take a ferry to visit the island). Except for the lack of buffet lunch and dinner, the hotel is very satisfactory in other aspects. Thank you again to the housekeeper Xiao Leng. Attentive service. Will stay here again next time.

msg:Stayed for 2 nights at Hyatt Regency Sanya Tianliwan. First of all, I would like to thank my dedicated customer service butler Sharpay Haili for calling in advance and adding WeChat to promptly introduce the hotel's business hours and surrounding attractions. She also thoughtfully informed the guests of the benefits they enjoyed to avoid missing out on some benefits that they did not enjoy. Sharpay is also very considerate in sharing the daily weather conditions, asking about experiences, and solving any needs in a timely manner. The communication is smooth and the response is quick.
The mini bar in the room offers free drinks and is replenished every afternoon. The hotel has a beautiful environment. Although it is close to the airport, it is quite convenient to travel. It is close to Tianya Haijiao and Xidao. If you are in need of these two stops, you can consider making a reservation. The price/performance ratio is very high and the service is very good. See you next time, you can ask Sharpay butler to take care of your needs during the entire stay. See you next time!

msg:This time I went to Sanya and stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tianli Bay. I was very satisfied with my best friend‚Äôs birthday. After communicating in advance, we prepared roses and cakes. The hotel is very close to several attractions. The West Island Tianya Haijiao and Tianya Town are not the city center, but they are independent. It is very quiet to enjoy a beach here. We should focus on the strong Amway housekeeper Wang Jing. He is very considerate and warm before arriving. During the stay, all reasonable needs are met in a timely manner. When leaving, he proactively asks if there is any help. Thank you very much. This hotel is very cost-effective and highly recommended.

The bathroom is very large, which is very convenient for taking children to wash up. The floor material is not slippery, which is great. The hotel is very close to the beach and there are rocks suitable for taking pictures. The overall a**osphere of the hotel is very quiet, and the attitude of the waiters is quite good. The parent-child activities are very rich, the teachers are very attentive, and the children have a lot of fun. Hotel meals are also available. Personally, I feel that the standard of Chinese food is higher than that of Western food. Before checking in, concierge Xiao Ming contacted us to inquire about various needs, and the service was very considerate. Thank you so much.

The hotel's exclusive beach can be played, unlike public beaches, which avoids excessive crowds and affects the experience. You can take your children to dig in the sand, collect shells, and catch crabs on the beach. It is very suitable for bringing children to play. The hotel also has a swimming pool. When the weather is warmer, you can take your children to swim. The children will have a great time. The hotel room is quite large, the facilities are relatively new, and the bed is very comfortable.

The room was cleaned every day and free pick-up and drop-off service was provided within the hotel.

msg:I stayed at Tianli Hyatt Hotel for a total of 2 nights and had a great experience. It takes about 10 minutes to get there by taxi from Sanya Airport. You can usually see planes landing from the hotel, so it is especially suitable for friends who are in transit. The location of the hotel is very close to several scenic spots, including Tianya Haijiao, the pier to the West Island, the Big and Small Cave Sky, etc.
The design of the hotel's lobby is quite satisfactory, with a symmetrical front and back design. You can directly see the sea from the entrance of the lobby. The overall basic color is coffee brown, giving people a comfortable feeling.
Originally, I was given a garden view room on the ground floor of Building 6, with a small garden. Later, I was upgraded to a deluxe sea view room in Building 1 on the 10th floor. The sea view is also very good, and there is not a small room. The balcony, sitting on the sofa on the balcony and looking at the beautiful sea view, the whole feeling is very comfortable.
The overall layout of the room is very comfortable, and the hygiene standards are also very good. What particularly surprised me was that the water flow in the bathtub was very strong, and the water level in the bathtub rose at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. This was the first time I had stayed in a hotel with a bathtub, and it was the first time I felt that the water in the bathtub could be drained so quickly!
The hotel's private beach is not crowded and relatively clean. There are also pink dolphins. Children are the happiest.
In short, Hyatt Regency Tianliwan Sanya is a good hotel worth recommending, both in terms of accommodation environment and service quality. It was a wonderful vacation trip. Finally, I would like to thank the butler Xiao Lu for his attentive serviceüëçüëçüëç

There are very few people in the new hotel, the tram charging is convenient, the Sharpay butler service is of high quality, and the store also helps buy cigarettes. Overall, it should be the most comfortable place to stay. However, the shortcomings are also obvious. Tianli Bay Beach is definitely not as good as Yalong Bay. There are basically no water sports in Yalong Bay. It is not very suitable for parents and children. It is a relatively quiet small beach, suitable for couples. It should be well maintained and the sand and gravel should be screened. , the reef combination beach is also quite distinctive.

The design of the hotel's lobby is quite satisfactory, with symmetrical hall-style design from front to back and modern resort-style wood. The overall base color is coffee brown, giving people a comfortable feeling. I stayed in the deluxe sea view room in Building 3. It was very spacious and bright, and the sea view was also very good. All rooms have large balconies, and the higher the floor, the clearer the coastline. It is basically a standard square layout, the living room is relatively long, and there is a refrigerator in the minibar stocked with Hainan specialty drinks, all of which are free to drink. The entire living room feels not oppressive but not very open either.
The bathroom is relatively large. Although it is not a smart toilet, the water pressure is very high and the hot water responds quickly. The small decorative chandelier on the washbasin is well designed and basically does not bump into each other. What satisfies me the most is the hotel's private beach, which is very clean and spacious and can be used for a romantic date at any time.
In short, Hyatt Regency Tianliwan Sanya is a good hotel worth recommending, both in terms of accommodation environment and service quality. It was a wonderful vacation trip. Finally, I would like to thank the butler Xiao Lu for his attentive serviceüëçüëçüëç

msg:I'm so lucky to have chosen Hyatt Regency Sanya Tianliwan for this honeymoon trip!
The location is excellent, not far from the airport. It is very convenient to go to several scenic spots (Guanyin in the South China Sea, Big and Small Cave Sky, Tianya Haijiao, and West Island). The hotel has a private beach, which can be reached by walking in 3 minutes from the elevator. The sunset is infinitely beautiful, especially for filming. ...Open the balcony in the early morning and the oncoming sea breeze is very comfortable and you can enjoy a relaxing time.
The hotel design is in a low-key and luxurious style. I like it very much and it feels very comfortable visually.
When checking in and checking out, the concierge opens and closes the car door and picks up the luggage in a timely manner. The front desk staff are very professional. It can be seen that the training is in place and the service is warm and thoughtful. It was a bit late on the day of check-in, but I still felt at home!
The guest rooms are clean, tidy and meticulously cleaned. Employees will take the initiative to say hello to guests when they meet them in the corridor. The sea view room is worth experiencing. Looking at the blue sea and blue sky on the balcony is so comfortable!
The catering staff are very polite, the catering is cost-effective, the ingredients are fresh and taste good.
The hotel swimming pool is super big and very beautiful! Have a drink, take a leisurely dip and enjoy your vacation.
This hotel is worth experiencing and spent an unforgettable time here. Thank you: Room Butler Xiao Lu for your one-stop service, I will be my first choice when coming to Sanya in the future!

Including room decoration and a delicious small cake. Thank you so much! The hotel's large environment and small environment are in line with the needs of a resort hotel. The room was large and very comfortable. The only bad thing is that the hotel breakfast doesn't change much every day. After staying for 4 days, 80% of the items have not changed. In the end, I really got tired of eating it, although the taste is generally good.

msg:Overall: The hotel is newly opened. I bought a set meal and came here to check it out. The overall environment is very new, clean and comfortable. The swimming pool and surrounding areas are also very clean. There is a beach directly in front of the hotel. Although it is a public beachüèñÔ∏è, due to the large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel and the surrounding area, it is like the hotel's private beach. The sand is as fine as Yalong Bay. There are few people and the environment is good.
Room: The room size is acceptable, with large balconies and new facilities. Standard twin beds, each single bed is slightly smaller.
Breakfast: A combination of Chinese and Western, with partially updated categories every day, such as bread, porridge, meat and eggs, fruits, drinks, etc. The items are diverse and rich.
Service: Employees in all depar**ents of the entire hotel are attentive and enthusiastic. In particular, the front desk customer service Xiao Gu took the initiative to add WeChat before leaving, providing 24-hour micro-butler service, and actively asking questions every day to help solve needs. Thank you very much.
Activities: "Yuequ Camp" children's activity center is the highlight. Very suitable for family travel. Hosting services are available (for a fee), and there are many activities in the morning and afternoon every day (free for hotel guests). We can participate in 2-3 classes almost every day. Special thanks to Teacher Yema, Teacher Sisi, Teacher Xiaoyou, Teacher Diudiu, and so on, every teacher, etc., taught the children to do handicrafts, played games with the children, and had water fights. The children gained a lot and had a lot of fun.
Surprise: This package includes Regency Club privileges. I originally thought that it would only provide afternoon tea (tea + drinks) every day, but I didn't expect that it also provides hot food and various drinks for 2 hours from 5:30 to 7:30 in the afternoon, which is equivalent to a small and simple buffet dinner. Very good, great value for money.
Disadvantages: The hotel is close to the airport and on the waterway. There is obvious noise when it is quiet at night. However, the hotel has enhanced soundproofing and earplugs are also provided. For those of us who fall asleep and fall asleep, deep sleep has no effect.
In short, the flaws do not hide the virtues. I hope the hotel will continue to include more cost-effective activities in promotional packages. Will recommend to friends.

Since it is a four-day and three-night package, there are many free experience projects. From room arrangement, anniversary decoration, to full project reservation consultation, they are all very helpful and follow-up. Patience and great help. Compared with simply consulting the front desk, this kind of communication is very rare for a five-star hotel. I would also like to thank Xiaoyu Butler!
Naturally, there is no choice in terms of hotel hardware. As a newly built hotel, the facilities are very new and the decoration is also great. There is no obvious odor when bringing children in. The hotel swimming pool, restaurants, including the karaoke room are all very well equipped. Although I stayed there for three It's late, but because I visited the scenic spot two days ago, I didn't experience it one by one until the last day. It felt very good. Moreover, the private beach and coconut palm grass are very beautiful and very exciting! Although the hotel is not located near a small town, it is very close to the airport, Tianya Haijiao, and West Island (the package comes with ferry tickets, which is great), which is very convenient!
Finally, the hotel also has free parent-child activities, Yuequ Camp. There are many experience classes for children every day, and teachers also take pictures. The experience and quality of the courses are very high. It is not just for fun. The teachers are very professional and serious. Bring the kids. In this cookie baking experience, you can also receive ready-made cookies! Of course, there are also some paid hosting services, but I didn‚Äôt try them this time. I will come again if I have the opportunity!

The design and decoration are fashionable and have a sense of space. The front desk staff were friendly and courteous. This was our first time as a family of three. We booked a sea view room and were upgraded to a larger room for free. We were also given welcome fruits. There is a double sofa on the terrace where you can sit and enjoy the scenery, the swimming pool and the garden. The swimming pool is large and sunny, with many beach chairs. You can enjoy the broad blue sky while swimming. Sometimes it is also fun to watch the planes going up and down without feeling noisy at all. The next day I went to West Island. This hotel is very close to West Island Pier. I took a taxi on the way there and it was very convenient on foot on the way back. Strolling on the way back to the hotel, you can look back and admire the beautiful light-effect buildings on the West Island Pier. At night, the Hyatt Regency Hotel complex looks large-scale and gives you a comfortable and safe feeling. There are some small shops, restaurants and farmhouse restaurants on the road. The hotel also has a gym and entertainment room. The entertainment room is very large and has many facilities including billiards, table tennis, various chess games, mahjong room, and KTV room. It's a pity that we don't have enough time to play! The hotel's breakfast buffet is worth it. It has a wide variety of styles and is meticulously prepared. Especially the Western-style snacks, which are freshly baked in a large oven in a dedicated area. I like the crispy colorful croissants and saltwater buns that are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Youli's attentive service The waffles with fruit and cream provided by the young chef are super deliciousüòã! One thing worth mentioning is that the reservation only included breakfast for two people. I needed to add one more person. After breakfast, I returned to the room and remembered that I had not paid. When I checked out, I quickly asked the front desk to assist me in making up the payment. After leaving for half a day, I discovered that my husband had already paid for breakfast in the restaurant! I looked at the payment history on my mobile phone and found that the hotel staff had automatically refunded me the extra breakfast fee. They were so attentive. A hotel worth returning to!

However, I couldn't make an appoin**ent or get a taxi at 4:30 in the morning. I couldn't get a luxury car. Maybe it was because the location was too far. The service in this hotel is very poor. I bought a two-night package. It may be because there are no calendar rooms and only head and tail rooms can be allocated. Moreover, the building I live in is a bit far away from the main building. I have to take a shuttle bus and my luggage is not sent to the room. There is often no one to answer the phone at the front desk.
I booked a sea view room on the penultimate floor, but there was only a small sea view. The hotel is on the sunken 3rd floor. The first floor is above ground and there are trees downstairs. There were a lot of mosquitoes and they were very poisonous. I was bitten 10 times in the eye in one night. I was also bitten and swollen, so I couldn‚Äôt put on makeup and there were scars!
The sound insulation is not good. The hotel is on the airline network. The plane is very close to the ground and the roar is loud. The room is also soundproof and you can usually hear coughing downstairs.
The gardens and beaches are very average. There are rocks in the gardens like the beach in the community. The beach is small and there are no beach chairs. There is little food in the lounge and the breakfast is average.
This hotel is only suitable for people who are catching a flight. The prerequisite is to book a car in advance. The breakfast is not good. It's really unpalatable. There are a lot of children queuing up and squeezing around. It's really unappetizing. It looks so disgusting.
There is also the front desk. I want to inquire about some other matters. The attitude is really hard to describe. This hotel's good impression has been ruined by the front desk.

The only drawback is that the sound of airplanes in the room is still quite obvious when sleeping at night. The air conditioner in some rooms did not work during my stay and I called for maintenance. This is still relatively rare in new hotels. Fortunately, the maintenance services are very timely.
In addition, the cooperation between various depar**ents, including catering, guest rooms, and concierge is a bit lacking, and guests need to ask themselves.

msg:üëÄThe newly opened hotels in Sanya Bayüè®The quality of Hyatt is generally not bad, and the hotel with exclusive access to the bayüåäis very privateüëç
üìçThe location is about 6km from the airport. It only takes 15-20 minutes to take a taxi. I was worried about the noise of the plane at first‚úàÔ∏èBut after staying for so many nights, I could hardly hear the sound of planes outside. I stayed here for three nights and it was a great experienceüéâ
When checking in, the housekeeper Cassie Xiaotong added my WeChat account. If you have any needs during check-in, you can contact her. At first, I thought it was a marketing account advertising, but her message was really responded to in seconds!
Room facilities: The room is very new and the layout is relatively separate. The bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry. The floor tiles are also made of wood-looking tiles. There is also a large balcony and clothes drying rack. There is no need to worry about having no place to dry clothes!
Breakfastü•£üç≥: There are not many varieties, but they are made with special care. Each breadü•Ø is produced by a professional bakery, and there are chefs baking it on site.
For dinner, we also launched a 2‚É£Ô∏èlarge 1‚É£Ô∏èsmall discount set menu, which only costs 3‚É£Ô∏è3‚É£Ô∏è8‚É£Ô∏èüí∞, which is completely within Hyatt‚Äôs standards.
Although I was assigned a room in Building 6, which is closest to the beach, it is far away from the lobby. There is a car that can pick you up at any time, which is also more convenient.

Service: The service is very good. The hotel will call you the day before check-in to ask if you have children or pets and whether the room needs special decoration.
As soon as I checked in, I was upgraded to a room type by the front desk.
There will be a dedicated and very professional staff member (Nana) who adds WeChat to ask if you need help every day, such as replenishing the mini bar, etc.
On the day of check-out, I was proactively asked if I needed help with late check-out. During my stay, as long as I called the hotel and needed service, a tall, thin guy wearing glasses would appear at the door carrying equipment.
Hardware: The overall facilities of the hotel are very new. The sofas and pillows are all new and clean. The room is reasonably arranged and has a large balcony. There are also sofas and pillows on the balcony. It is very comfortable to lie on it and bask in the sun in the afternoon.
It is also worth mentioning that the entertainment area equipped in the hotel has a table tennis table with table tennis rackets and table tennis balls! There is also chess, backgammon, and KTV. We played for a long time and the experience was really great.
There are many seats on the beach, which is also suitable for sunbathing~
The pool is also very clean. The breakfast is very rich and rich. The waffles and croissants are all freshly baked. I show off five braised eggs every day. There will be waiters at the coffee table to help make them in real time.
All in all, great value for money, definitely next time!

The hotel breakfast doesn't have many varieties but the taste is okay. Another point is that it is very close to the airport, and planes fly over from time to time. The noise is a bit loud, so be careful if you are sensitive to sound.

When I came back to check in, I was assigned to a building far away and needed to take the shuttle bus. I don't know which link went wrong. The upgrade doesn't matter. The main thing is that the front desk said it and then changed its mind. It's really speechless, but I'm too lazy to tell the front desk, and I won't stay again. I tried very hard to see the sea view. So I'll just stay in a regular room, which can be hundreds cheaper. The entire management of the hotel feels very chaotic. There are no trash cans or paper rolls in the room. The staff must have found new ones. They don't know anything when asked. The lobby bar put the sold snacks in the cabinet and waited for me to buy them. When I bought them, they said they were sold. The restaurant also told me that they were out of stock several times after I ordered. Later, the housekeeper asked me to give a five-star review on WeChat. As a Ctrip Gold Diamond member, I really can't ****. The only praise for the concierge who didn't carry the luggage and the shuttle bus pick-up guys was very good.

Next, let‚Äôs talk about the facilities and equipment of the hotel. The swimming pool is very large. When you lie on the lounge chair, you can see the paintings of various airlines.

The hotel also has its own plastic track, which is really suitable for running enthusiasts. Running on the beach and enjoying the beautiful scenery of the sea and sky is really amazing. I don‚Äôt want to go to the gym at all.
The area around the hotel is relatively remote, but there are two scenic spots nearby that you can visit. One is West Island and the other is Tianya Haijiao. West Island feels more like Xiao Gulangyu to me, but the cultural construction is not as rich as Gulangyu. I think it can be visited once, but There is nothing special. If you go to the West Island for a day trip, it is recommended not to arrange too much time. If the time you go is not the peak period, it is recommended to take a morning or an afternoon to go shopping casually.

The hotel occupies a large area and is very a**ospheric.
There really aren't many people, so it's more suitable for customers who don't want to stay in a family hotel and like quiet.
I booked two VIP rooms and helped upgrade the room type to the highest floor.
The room is very large and bright. Not to mention the balcony, you can see the sea from the bed! And the view from the front is super beautiful
The swimming pools in the public areas of the hotel are also concentrated and the environment is good.
I wish the breakfast variety could be richer
My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt get to see the sunset and fortune. I hope I can see it next time.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Tingting for contacting me in advance, patiently answering various questions and helping to coordinate the room. Thank you for your hard work~ a hundred times better than the housekeeper we had at a five-star hotel in Yalong Bay two days ago.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider Hyatt.

msg:I have explored hotels countless times, but I have never remembered a hotel or a trip because of one hotel staff member. However, Miss Sharpay Wu Haili at the hotel front desk actually broke my "stereotype" impression of Hyatt. She deserves to be remembered. live.
I have stayed at Park Hyatt, Grand Hyatt, Andaz, Shanghai Maoyue, and various Hyatts under the Hyatt family, but only the Tianliwan Hyatt has refreshed my exploration of the Hyatt Group's favorability and made me I have proven to my friends that I made a wise decision to choose Hyatt as my first choice in Sanya, a city where all kinds of hotels are blooming. I still can‚Äôt help but mention the contribution of hotel FO Miss Wu Haili, who received the gift the day before the trip. Her pre-emptive care was not just about confirming the room type and night. She also politely asked if there was anything I needed help with during the itinerary. On the day of check-in, the hotel was nearly full, and she tried her best to help me make the most of the room type. upgrade and reserved it in advance (I didn‚Äôt hold out hope at first, because I knew that this was a relatively difficult move for the Hyatt series), and it doesn‚Äôt stop there. You can fully feel Sharpay‚Äôs support before, during, and after sales. The guests are treated with a certain degree of care and warmth. Because of a hotel staff, I remember a hotel, a hotel group, and a city. I can't even imagine it myself, hahahahaha
It can be seen that at the moment when the hotel industry is so involved, especially in Sanya where sea views are not scarce, simply relying on decoration and matching scenery is obviously half the result with half the effort and lacks some meaning. It is probably the service that can break out and stand out from the crowd. Obviously, Sanya Hyatt Tianliwan handed over a standard answer sheet.

The supporting facilities are very good. Not to mention the service, which is very fast and efficient, especially Comrade Ozawa at the concierge depar**ent. , Comrade Ozawa provided one-on-one service through WeChat phone calls during the entire 5-night stay. It was truly a VIP experience. The hotel is close to the airport, Tianya Haijiao and West Island and other scenic spots, making travel very convenient. The breakfast is very good, especially the bread and rice noodles, which are very delicious. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose this hotel. I will recommend it to my relatives and friends when I go back. What a great hotel!

The quilts all have a smell, and the texture is not cotton. They are not as good as the four-piece set at the Express Hotel. The key point is that there is no soundproofing at all. Because it is close to the airport, I heard the sound of planes taking off all night. Someone checked in next door after 12 o'clock and I could hear it clearly. Finally, I fell asleep wearing Apple noise-canceling headphones. I give the hotel's service five points. The facilities are okay, but I can't breathe at all and I have a headache all night in the room.

Disadvantages: Let me tell you more! Hope this helps close the hole
Environment: The courtyard room is okay, but it has a fatal flaw. It is indeed on the landing channel of the plane. If you stay in the hotel for a long time, it is really unfriendly and very annoying to the elderly and children! ! !
Service: I couldn‚Äôt stand it after staying for a few days and negotiated with the hotel to cancel the remaining few days. There was no difficulty in communicating with the staff. I also thank Ctrip for the communication. However, the disadvantage is that I booked the order for three days and wanted to cancel it for two days. You have to place a new order for the next day, and you cannot directly return it for two days. Moreover, it is not a package reservation, and the price of the same-day reservation is much higher. Although Ctrip has also given some subsidies, it still does not feel very good.

Before departure, I added the hotel's WeChat account (Liu Shifen, thank you so much, I'm really satisfiedüëçüèª) and asked about our approximate arrival time. The policy is to check in at 3:00 pm, but we arrived after 12:00, the room was prepared in advance, and we were upgraded to a sea view room for free, and we checked in quickly. Good reviews! The scenery of the hotel is super beautiful, you can watch the sunrise and sunset from the balcony. The water at the beach is very clear, and you can pick up a lot of shells. The water in the swimming pool is also super clear and clean. It may be a bit cold in the morning, but after noon, it is very suitable for swimming after the sun shines. Breakfast was very good, dinner might be a little slow, but it's OK to order. The hotel has a free bus that can go directly to the duty-free shop, twice a day. There is a pier next to the hotel, and you can take a boat directly to the West Island. We encountered a small situation before departure on the last day, and the hotel helped us solve it very promptly. It was not the hotel's problem, but they still gave us a free airport transfer. I will choose this place next time I come to Sanya~

msg:Facilities: When I booked the hotel, I chose Hyatt because this hotel was newly opened in 2023. When I arrived, I found that the facilities were very new and the decoration style was very modern. I like the courtyard room very much. There is a small courtyard where you can sit and look at the scenery and have afternoon tea. It is very comfortable. The water in the swimming pool is a bit deep, which is a bit scary for people who want to play in the water. When I entered the water, I screamed and almost called the lifeguard by the pool.
Hygiene: The hygiene condition is very good. Even if you touch the clothes hangers placed outside, there is no dust at all. Although it is a newly opened hotel, there is basically no smell in the room.
Environment: The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the beach. There are coconut trees along the way and the scenery is very good. There are beach chairs on the beach where you can sit and watch the sunset. The hotel's breakfast is delicious, but there will be a lot of latecomers looking for a seat. I particularly like the freshly baked bread, very sweet. The menu changes every day. It's a pity that the grilled mushrooms were particularly delicious one day and then not available anymore.
Service: The hotel's service is very good. Special thanks to the hotel concierge Xiao Ming. He added WeChat the day before check-in. Any questions he had were answered promptly. I wanted to have an afternoon tea set in the room, and it was arranged after I told him. The waiters in the lobby are also very friendly and will proactively ask if you need anything. The water and drinks in the room's drink cabinet are replenished every day.

The hotel is on the landing channel of the airport, so you can observe the planes up close. There is noise outdoors, but indoor noise can basically be ignored.

Service: Butler service is very good and all employees are very enthusiastic. In particular, the housekeeper Xiaofei took the initiative to ask me if I needed anything, which moved me very much.

This stay experience was very good! I will choose here again next time!

These details need to be improved.

The price of coconuts at the pool bar is also very good. The shallow water area is large and suitable for children to play. The signs in the hotel are not particularly obvious. For example, a guest staying in Building 5 came out of the stairs to find Yuequ Camp. After searching for a long time, there were no obvious signs, and he found the room at the rear right. not so obvious. I found out after walking around a lot and meeting the hotel staff.

The concierge service at check-in, good night desserts and a large plate of welcome fruits are all available. In terms of adding WeChat Butler service separately, you can strengthen the training instead of following the process. Breakfast is standard and the colorful croissants are delicious.

Until I was recommended this new hotel that will only open in 2023, I wanted to take my father to experience it!
The villa has 200 square meters of rooms, clean facilities and new facilities, two bedrooms, an independent swimming pool and a kitchen. Because my father loves to cook, it also meets his need to show off his cooking.
We only booked it for two days at first, but ended up extending it for two more nights because my father said that the meaning of traveling is not to rush around and rush to schedule, but to stay in one place and enjoy the quiet time. Hyatt Regency Tianli Bay just satisfied us. .
The hotel is not far from the airport, and you can occasionally see planes flying over it, especially at sunset, which is a unique sight!
In addition, surrounding attractions are also easily accessible, such as Nanhai Guanyin, Tianya Haijiao, etc.
Finally, I would like to thank the customer service girl Xiaoyu for her enthusiasm and patience. We originally booked a suite, but they upgraded the room type for us. We were very happy with our stay and will come back again.

It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt get this yourself, but at the very least you should ask me if I have this need. The second thing is that the hotel should be equipped with some basic daily necessities.

The hotel location itself is not in the urban area, and we had to ask a ** to pay the rider 20 yuan for errands. This location is out of the way, so we should be equipped with some basic necessities. The hotel room should also be equipped with some toilet water and alcohol spray. In short, it‚Äôs okay if the hotel doesn‚Äôt have smart devices. At least the service should keep up! There is indeed a gap between the service and the five-star hotel! And I said before that I wanted a high-rise floor, but they still gave me the lowest floor, 501. When I went to the room, they moved me to 802. They contacted me in advance. I told me my needs the day before, but they still didn‚Äôt help me get it. I only changed it when I arrived! In addition, the elevator in the hotel in Building 3 is amazing! The smell is extremely strong, as unpleasant as a dead animal! There are not many types of breakfast in the hotel, and there are still few types of food in each area. It is recommended to add some varieties!

The room has no decoration smell, is very spacious and clean, and the balcony is very large. The double sofa on the balcony can be wider. I personally don‚Äôt think the sound of airplanes has much impact, especially at night. You can watch the sunset on the beach, which is very beautiful, but it is partially blocked by the coast. If you want to watch it directly, you have to go to the next door Tianya Haijiao. The restaurant is delicious. I like the pineapple fried rice and the Hainan noodles for breakfast every day. It is very convenient to order takeout. The food and tools for catching fish are all very good. Convenient, there is a takeaway cabinet, it is also convenient to take ~
Attractions: There are Tianya Haijiao on one side and Xidao on the other side next to each other, very close, you can get there in a moment by taxi; Xidao has very good water quality and is also very beautiful, but you can't wait to watch the sunset if you stay in the hotel and have to catch the boat to ** Island, Tianya Haijiao is right to watch the sunset and the evening glow, and it is super romantic to take a walk. It is not only the Sanya Bay Coconut Dream Corridor that has the most beautiful sunset, nor is it the kind of "big stone boring" scenic spot. If you have time to stay in the hotel, you must go to the next door to see it; the duty-free shop shuttle bus passes by the hotel twice a day, which is convenient and requires reservation; it is very convenient to take a taxi on any online platform.
Software: The service is not bad. Eden from the hotel concierge contacted me in advance. The younger brother of the concierge was also very enthusiastic. Every time he helped to open the car door, he would ask if I had any luggage. It was very good, thank you. The front desk sister I met on the day I arrived at the hotel upgraded me to a sea view room with a very beautiful sea view. Thank you very much. The hotel package gave me two tickets to West Island, which was very worthwhile and beautiful. I also got 300 meal coupons for dining in the restaurant. I had a delicious meal, which was not bad. There was also a BBQ in the evening. Originally, the food items and quantity were limited. It happened to be open that day. Thank you to the responsible brother for upgrading to unlimited and letting us take it ourselves. It was very comfortable to have a drink by the pool. We also needed to take medicine. Thank you to the brothers and sisters in the lobby for helping us pour hot water~ The room was cleaned for us every day, and it was very comfortable to live in. Thank you to the housekeeping staff~

Hotel environment: Beautiful, Southeast Asian-style gardens, the outdoor swimming pool is very grand, and the leisure area surrounds the swimming area. Guests who like swimming will be ecstatic. I heard from internal staff that the hotel will develop a commercial town (not yet open), which can be connected Tianya Haijiao Resort makes it more convenient for guests to visit this area!
If you like travel photography, be sure not to miss the boulder landscape at the seaside, the photos are very beautiful!

There were no toys to play with... Apart from the courses, it was quite good, but the child asked to change hotels and leave on the same day üòÇ I bought it specially for the executive lounge. The service was really good, but the meals were pitiful! Moreover, we have to go to the cafe for breakfast. Only light meals are available in the evening.

Environment: The hotel is very close to the beach and the West Island. It has a large swimming pool, but the water in the swimming pool is too cold. I went to take pictures of the sunrise early in the morning and walked to the beach in a few steps. The hotel is cost-effective very high.
Service: The service attitude of Kira at the hotel's front desk is super good. The drinks in the lobby bar are delicious and the service is also very good.
The disadvantage is that the way to find the elevator in the underground garage is too complicated, but this cannot be improved. In addition, there are too many people in the Grand Club. I hope the hotel can alleviate this.

Not to mention the facilities and environment, they are perfect; you can watch the sunset from 5:30 to 6:00 pm, with pink dolphins. If you want to buy floral shirts, you can also buy them on the first floor of the hotel. The price is too affordable! Overall I like it very much! Will come again next time! pin

msg:On vacation in Sanya, considering the convenient distance for the return trip, I moved from Haitang Bay to the vicinity of Sanya Bay. I chose to stay at the newly opened Hyatt Tianli Bay.
I received a call from Nancy at the front desk one night in advance to confirm the check-in information. Because I checked out in Haitang Bay in the morning and planned to visit Nanshan attractions, I communicated the room type and location in advance and stored it at the hotel on a first-come, first-served basis.
During the trip, I received a call from the hotel that the room was ready and the luggage had been delivered to the room. This was very considerate and informed me of the latest progress in real time. Nancy also informed various messages very considerately and answered all questions; by the way, guest Xuan's evening appetizers are pretty good, and they are good enough to eat if you don't go for a high price. Since we plan to go out to eat seafood, we can only try a small amount.
After all, the hotel is newly built, very clean overall, the swimming pool is also very clean, and the service is considerate. I am basically quite satisfied with it. It is also close to the airport (the only thing I want to say is that it is close to the airport, which means there are more planes passing by overhead)
All in all, the stay experience was quite satisfactory. You can consider staying here next time you go to Sanya. The transportation is quite convenient.

I'm too lazy to bother, so I just want to make a living, so I just open the door to ventilate it. As a result, the air conditioner would automatically turn off when the door was opened to disperse the odor. Mosquitoes also entered the room and I was completely awake from 2 to 5 o'clock at night. My child's wrists, ankles, and face were bitten and swollen. Totally in a bad mood. It's all because I was careless at the time. This must have been the case when it first opened in 2023.

The hotel has a good location, complete facilities, beautiful environment, swimming pool, private beach, beautiful scenery and few people. This is the most cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. The hotel restaurant has good food, exquisite food, rich varieties, and reasonable room layout. It feels like home. I like it very much. Especially it is clean and tidy. For someone who is a bit germaphobic, I can rest assured to use it. The front desk staff is quite satisfactory, but the manager Rosine is really beautiful and I like her ~ she smiles so cute ~ everyone in the guest service center The young beauties greet each other warmly and give blessings when they receive the call. It is really warm~~ The three beauties in the VIP Club also provide very good service~ Although there is the sound of airplanes, I personally think that airplanes during the day are also a special scenery. The rooms are soundproofed. The work is very good. The sound outside the room can be completely ignored when the doors and windows are closed, and it will not affect the rest. The photos taken have a unique scenery~~
Finally, I would like to praise the hotel's guest service team Anya, Rosine, Sharpay and other beauties. With them, the hotel's fortune will last forever and its business will be more prosperous. Next time we vacation in Sanya, we will make this place our destination!

Advantages: All the service staff are very good and very enthusiastic, especially Tristan. His smile is very warm and healing, and his politeness makes people feel particularly refreshing. He will take the initiative to introduce the hotel's facilities and equipment, and nearby popular tourist spots, which is very heart-warming. I reminded you of the weather forecast for the day and answered all your questions patiently. These small details made me very unforgettable. Thank you very much Tristan for taking care of me.
There is a very cute welcome dog in the hotel. He is very well-behaved and cute. After learning about its story, we understand why every service staff in the hotel can be so heart-warming. What is particularly funny is that Fortune even has a weekend off. I‚Äôm so enviousüòÜThe swimming pool is so big and it‚Äôs so cool to swim in it
Disadvantages: The hotel may be located in the tropics, with too much vegetation. There are many various small bugs. You can also see them by the swimming pool, which is a bit scary. I hope this can be improved. There are too few varieties for breakfast. I feel like there is nothing to eat. There are very few dining tables and the replenishment speed is very slow. The dining tables are a lot empty. Once they are replenished, they are taken away quickly. It gives the impression of a vegetable market. The feeling of grabbing food.
Speaking of the vegetable market, I have to mention the lounge. It is very disappointing. It is crowded with people, and I have to wait for a seat. This is something I can‚Äôt imagine. I will not decide whether to get the lounge benefits if I extend my stay. This is an issue that the hotel needs to focus on improving. The lounge should be a place where you can enjoy better services and higher-quality meals and drinks. How could it be like a buffet restaurant, which is not what a star-rated hotel should have at all? Standard, there is no quiet environment, no high-quality service, because the staff was collecting plates the whole time, but I still need to praise the lady in the lounge. She is very busy running before and after, but she also does not forget to see the enthusiasm of the guests. Say hello, which is very good.
Overall, the hotel has areas that need improvement, but there are also areas that are very good. I will come here again.

This time I stayed in a VIP room. From the room, I could directly see the swimming pool and the beach.
It only takes three to five minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach, and there is a coconut tree promenade where you can walk and take photos.
The recreation room and gym can be entered at any time by swiping your card, and the facilities are relatively complete.
We stayed at the swimming pool until ten o'clock in the evening and were accompanied by multiple safety officers, and we saw that they would use test kits to test the water quality from time to time, which was quite responsible.
The overall experience is very good, and I will most likely stay here again next time.

msg:As the newest hotel in Sanya, I am very satisfied with everything about the environment and service! Very good value for money! The balcony is huge and the view is beautiful! Especially Sharpay, the lady at the front desk, is very enthusiastic and considerate. You can contact her directly if you have any needs. The free travel photos are also very beautiful! ! I didn't have any expectations for free shipping, but the swimming pool and grassland of this hotel are really outstanding. The lighting of the swimming pool at night is very beautiful, especially the blue bricks with the ripples on the water. The whole thing is sparkling and romantic. ü•∞The breakfast is also delicious if you have a small one. The cake would be even better... As for the noise because it is close to the airport, there is some noise, but it doesn't have much impact on me because I am tired from playing during the day and I just lie down and fall asleep.

They also upgraded me to a sea view room, with a great view of the sea! The coffee in the hotel can be ordered or eaten as a set meal. It is very cost-effective.

msg:I stayed in Building 2. The hotel is relatively new. It is located on the edge of the West Island. The service needs more training and proactive greetings. However, the greening is still relatively new and needs time to settle. The soundproofing of the room is relatively good, but it is far from the airport. It's too close. You can still hear the sound of planes on the waterway. The location of this hotel is not very good and it is inconvenient to go anywhere. I personally think it can only be used as a transit stay. The sanitary environment is average. We have two rooms and one room has a sink. It was difficult to get water out of the sewer. There were bugs flying out of the washbasin in one room. I thought it was a minor matter, but when I woke up the next day, I found them on the bed, which frightened the children and elders. We told the front desk when we checked out, and they also took photos. It was said that a manager would contact us, but he never did. The least courtesy was not given to our guests, and the breakfast variety was quite limited.

Environment: The scenery is very good, the beach is huge, and it‚Äôs the only one there. Plus, after the National Day, the entire beach is ours, and the pink dolphins are very eye-catching.
Room: Very large. Open the window and you can see the unparalleled sea view, which makes people feel relaxed and happy.
Catering: Whether it is the executive floor on the 6th floor or the 1st floor, the taste is really good, because my home is made in a restaurant, and the dishes on the 1st floor taste really great. I just hope that the variety of dishes can be more abundant! The two ladies in the administration hall on the 6th floor are very beautiful and have very good attitudes.
Hotel Activities: I had a general understanding of this fun camp at the beginning. The children were very happy to experience it. They participated in several courses they wanted to learn and liked it very much. The teachers were also very patient and friendly. They looked forward to the activities of the next day every day.
Service: The service is really excellent. It is very attentive and considerate. The follow-up service provided by Belinda who contacted the hotel was also very timely. I am very satisfied. It feels like customer care comes first!
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs image dog‚ÄîFashu. My kid has been waiting for it for a day and is very good at catching crabsü¶Ä

msg:The facilities of the newly opened hotel are just good, just good, just good! I booked in advance and got an upgrade to a room with an unparalleled sea view. It was really refreshing when I opened the balcony door. Thank you to the housekeeper Yuri. He called me and added WeChat the day before check-in to confirm that there were charging stations in the parking lot. He also took the trouble to answer many questions. My child was happy. I had a lot of fun playing in Fun Camp. The swimming pool has a half-meter children's pool and a super large 1.5m pool. However, the big whale that attracts children is just a small slide on land. It is a little disappointing that it is not in the pool ~ From the End of the World The scenic spot is very close. The scenic spot does not charge tickets now. It is also very good to go for a walk in the park. The only drawback of the hotel is that it is right on the airport route. The plane is really close. You can clearly count how many windows there are. The door is the village. It‚Äôs not a safe place to eat in a farmhouse. There is no supermarket and you have to drive about ten minutes to Luneng. However, the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant is also very good. The breakfast is rich. You can order a set meal for lunch and dinner. It costs more than 300 for a set for three adults and one child. It was enough to eat. The hotel package I booked also came with 300 meal coupons. You can also order a la carte ~ The beach is really a private beach, with a pier on one side and a reef on the other. There were very few people. My child picked up a lot of shells and even caught them. The little crab had a great time, but parents should pay attention to safety. There is really no one on the beach~ This time I was short of time and didn‚Äôt go to Xidao or Tianya Town. I can stay here next time

My initial reservation with Hyatt was made after careful consideration. It's 15 minutes away from the airport. I left the Phoenix Airport at 6 o'clock and was already lying on the Hyatt's big bed at 6:30.

Before check-in, the hotel housekeeper will contact you in advance to arrange a room, so there is a lot of check-in.

Dinner: The set meal comes with a 300 unlimited coupon, which is surprisingly delicious. Chicken and pineapple fried rice. This time I went to the fried rice ceiling in Sanya and ate 3 big bowls. I will post more about the food at Hyatt.

Breakfast: I have eaten a lot of breakfast when I went out to play. Hyatt's breakfast tastes are hard to choose, and the desserts are currently unsurpassed.

Check-in experience: The balcony of the sea view room faces the West Island, and the view is very good.
There is a 1.5m deep swimming pool downstairs from the room. There is also a place to buy swimsuits/sandals on the first floor of the hotel, and the price is slightly higher than outside.
There is a surprise in the shower.

I'm so sleepy, I'll try to improve it tomorrow.

msg:Overall, it‚Äôs great. I have a few suggestions:
1. In the men's and women's locker rooms on the first floor, there are lack of stools and towels, and the floor is very slippery. Children fell down.
2. Although the straight-line distance to the West Island pier is short, since the hotel entrance is on the west side, it is too far to walk to the pier, the bus station is not close, and the awkward distance is too close to take a taxi. It is recommended that the hotel can arrange a special car to pick up and drop off, the cost is not high But the experience is upgraded
3. It is recommended that the water height in the deep water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe swimming pool should be 5-10cm lower. The current water height is not friendly to adults aged 160-170 cm. If children swim to the deep water area, adults will not be able to pass because the water is too deep, which poses a safety risk.
4. The whale slide has no water spray during the day, so you can‚Äôt play it.
5. The toilet door and bathroom door handles are not easy to open and the toilet glass has very strange patterns. These patterns are only found in fast hotels and affect the sense of luxury.
6. There are many centipede-shaped insects around the swimming pool. Children are very scared and are really not sure whether they will bite.
7. There should be a wave pool in Beiye Planet. The children‚Äôs toys there are very artistic but few are practical and fun.
Above, I wish the hotel will get better and better.

It is a residential area with many supermarkets and fruit shops. It only costs less than 20 yuan to take a taxi there. You can go shopping there. Liye The Dream Corridor is not too far away either.

msg:This is my first trip to Sanya. After choosing a hotel for a long time, I finally chose this one. Personally, I prefer newer hotels, but this one meets all my needs. I went to the front desk for an upgrade and the room will be much larger. The balcony of the room looks out. The swimming pool and the sea are just 100 meters away from the beach. There are not many people on the beach, so it is too friendly for people with social fears to take photos. The three days and two nights we stayed here happened to be my birthday. The hotel arranged a birthday cake which was really nice. I would like to thank my butler Nana for thoughtfully arranging our itinerary. To be honest, the hotel's gym is a bit biased. I seriously doubted that I went in the wrong direction for the first time. The signage could be more obvious. Another drawback is that the room has a bathtub but no bathtub cover. I think it can be improved. Of course, these are small things and will not affect my impression of this hotel at all. The price/performance ratio is very good and I will recommend it to my friends!

He contacted me in advance and confirmed my arrival time and needs. He also helped me upgrade the room. I also had free soft drinks in the refrigerator. During our stay, he always cared about whether we had anything else. Needed, provided a great stay experience ~

Landscape and facilities: To be honest, the sea view of the hotel exceeded my expectations. The swimming pool is open until 10 o'clock in the evening, and there are fountains and whale slidesüê≥üõù. It has a childlike feel~ There is also a quiet and charming beachüèñÔ∏è.

In the morning and evening when it‚Äôs not so hot, it‚Äôs very pleasant to sit on the balcony and enjoy the wind and the scenery~

Transportation: We rented a car to travel. The hotel is very close to the airport and it is very convenient to drive. We can get there in about 15 minutes. Parking is available on the ground and underground, as well as tram charging stations. There are a lot of parking spaces, but the underground garage to the room is a little roundabout. You can get familiar with it by walking twice.

Restaurant: The cafe on the first floor is very large. It is said to be a cafe, but it is actually a restaurant. There are many varieties of breakfast, both Chinese and Western, and there is also a very cute area specially for children. Interlude: If there are guests who have to catch a flight, they can also help pack coffeeüëç~ When I checked in, the hotel gave me a RMB 300 dining voucher, and there was no consumption threshold. Although the selection of dishes is limited, the taste is pretty good~

Finally, I would like to talk about the sound of ‚úàÔ∏è. After all, it is relatively close to the airport and you can see the planes taking off and landing from above the hotel. However, I think many hotels in Sanya Bay should have this problem... (The hotel room has earplugs, which is considerate. )

The hotel is very close to the airport, within 20 minutes by taxi, which is very convenient. You can hear the sound of planes taking off and landing in the room, but it does not affect your sleep. It is a very special experience to see planes taking off and landing in the hotel yard.
The check-in process was super fast. From the lobby to the coffee shop to the swimming pool, every staff member was excellent and professional, making people feel very safe.
It takes about 80 meters to walk from the lobby to the room. There are corridors between each building that you can pass through, and you can also take the shuttle bus at the door, which is convenient for travel.
The room is large and very clean. In addition to mineral water, the minibar also has jelly and coconut juice, as well as capsule coffee and tea bags.
The outdoor swimming pool is excellent. No matter how tired you are, you have to go for a swim every day.
You can go to the beach from the hotel, it's quiet and quiet.
I would like to praise the hotel's breakfast, which is rich in freshly squeezed juices, fruit cuts, Chinese, Western and Asian flavors, and local delicacies. Every type of bread made in the hotel's own bakery is very delicious, btw the chef who makes the omelets is superb!
Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Hyatt Regency Tianliwan!

msg:I go to Sanya every year and have stayed at Clubmed, Tianyu and Haitang Bay before. This year I heard that Hyatt opened a store in Sanya, so I quickly checked in. First of all, the environment: it is very good, the swimming pool is clean, catering: there is no buffet at noon, but most people who come to Sanya may have done it outside at noon, so it is enough. The breakfast is good and the dinner is a little simple, but fortunately the price is not expensive, 210 per person Children are half price. Facilities: It is difficult to make a reservation for Karaoke, but I went there on the 11th and understood that the gym can be used. Service: This is below the standard. The room smelled strange when I checked in at 14:00. At 17:30, I changed the room and officially checked in with the help of busy staff. Secondly, the attitude of the doorman is really bad. If a luxury car clears the way, his attitude must be attentive and you can completely ignore the comment. But if you take a taxi, stroll or rent an electric car to enter, his eyes will be wide open and his attitude will be bad. One day I rented an electric car to enter the door. Just give it a try. If you bring your family or girlfriend and want to experience high-end services, you can avoid it. It will definitely disappoint you. The overall environment is okay, and so is the hygiene. There is no sun protection in the swimming pool, but no one can go there during the day and at night. The service is really not as good as other hotels in Sanya with the same price. It loses the reputation of Hyatt and is a bit disappointing.

The installation was complete, and there were welcome fruits. There were 24-hour security personnel at the beach.

The quality is not inferior to the big brand hotels in Yalong Bay. Before checking in, Jack, the concierge staff, contacted me to inquire. Accommodation preferences, indeed helped us choose a satisfactory floor and reserved beds and quilts for us during the holiday when we were nervous about extra beds. The service can't be said enough. The best thing about the hotel is the swimming pool and the rooms. The wide sun overlooks the entire swimming pool, and you can also see the blue sea in the distance.

Secondly, I would like to praise the entire hotel service team, including the service staff in the reception, front desk, restaurant, lobby bar, swimming pool, children's playground and other areas. Everyone has a smile and provides cordial service. I stayed at Platinum and Rosewood a few days ago during this Sanya vacation. To be honest, Hyatt's service team made me feel even better, and I highly praise them.
The breakfast is very rich. Surprisingly, it is different every day. The details are well done.
I would like to commend the staff of the children's paradise for arranging a whole day of activities for children. All are very interesting and the staff are very responsible and take good care of each child. Our baby never wanted to return and said he must return it in the future. To come.
As someone who travels more than 100 times a year and stays in hotels almost most of the time, Hyatt Regency Sanya is indeed worth recommending to everyone.

p.s. In addition, because it is close to the airport, there will be planes passing by. Guests who are particularly sensitive to sound should consider this at their own discretion.

Considering the distance from the airport, I chose the Hyatt for the last night. I have to say that it is a bit worse than the hotel in Haitang Bay. The service does not have a dedicated butler and the overall facilities are a bit sloppy. Some places are not well maintained. The beach chairs on the beach are rickety and broken. The most unbearable thing about no one repairing it is the roar overhead every five minutes.

1. It is not recommended especially for light sleepers. The plane leaves every few minutes at night and is very loud. You will be woken up as soon as you fall asleep or you will not be able to sleep at all. The hotel is close to the roadside and you can hear the sound of vehicles clearly.
2. I booked the hotel more than 10 days in advance, but the hotel swimming pool was under maintenance. There was no prompt when booking, and someone only informed me one day before check-in. This is very unfriendly to people who just want to play in the swimming pool. I saw many ladies on Xiaohongshu. Had to check out temporarily and rebook the hotel
3. There is a beach in the hotel, but it is a wild sea. The sand is very co**** and you cannot go into the water. You can play in the water.
4. Breakfast is average and not delicious.
5. The environment and hygiene are okay

Thanks to Ivy for upgrading the garden view twin bed to a deluxe garden view room. The room is indeed big.
The welcome fruit was a pear, which was not big but quite delicious.
There is a private beach, but the sand is slightly co****r. The seaside scenery is good.
There is a children's area with different children's activities every day, both indoors and outdoors. If you need to participate, just make a reservation. For our children, they would complain about being tired when going out to visit attractions. Going to the children's area activities every day and playing in the water would make them happier.
There is no shade in the swimming area during the day, so it is quite sunny. But I don't swim, so it doesn't matter.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, with not many categories, but the taste is quite satisfactory. Freshly made muffins are delicious üòã.
Tell me what needs to be improved
The minibar has capsule coffee. When I wanted to use it, I found that the cup was not cleaned.
If you need to call the front desk, the response is not fast. But the front desk will call back when they see it. may be too busy
It's close to the airport and there are bound to be some noises as countless planes fly over every day. Therefore, tourists who are concerned about noise should consider the noise issue more in the first few days of travel. Traveling is very tiring and sleep is very important. You can experience it in the last two days of the trip. After all, being close to the airport has both disadvantages and advantages.
The staff are very enthusiastic and overall very satisfied. Will come again next time.

I have asked countless times why my luggage is so different from other hotels.
As a result, the luggage was taken away and the pick-up car still didn't come, so they were asked to wait at the elevator entrance.
Check-out is extremely slow. It is the only hotel that requires a deposit. I don‚Äôt know if the refund of the deposit will be slower.
When you check out, you need your room card to exit the parking lot and then come back to pay for the parking fee.

msg:After comparing many hotels, I finally chose Hyatt Regency Tianliwan as my last hotel after leaving Sanya. Overall, I was not disappointed.
advantage:
1. The hotel is located between Tianya Haijiao and Xidao Pier, 1 km from Xidao Pier, 2 kilometers from Tianya Haijiao, 7 kilometers from Sanya Airport, and a 20-minute taxi ride from Nanshan Tourist Area. For travelers visiting Nanshan and traveling in and out of Sanya, the hotel's location is a good choice.
2. The hotel should have just opened this year. The overall hardware is relatively new, there are fewer guests, and it is quieter during the day.
3. The hotel has a room steward who consults guests on their needs the day before check-in. The customer experience is high. I would like to thank Ivy for equipping me with an air purifier when I was sick.
shortcoming:
1. The hotel is close to the airport and you will hear the sound of airplanes. The hotel provides earplugs for guests. Because the late flights from Sanya basically ended in the early morning, I personally was not affected after closing the doors and windows.
2. The decoration of the hotel still smells a bit. The housekeeper prepared an air purifier for us in advance, which really improved it.
3. The hotel breakfast needs to be improved, there is a little variety
suggestion:
The hotel is very close to Tianya Haijiao, Xidao Pier and the airport. If a shuttle bus is provided for guests, the customer experience should be better.

The breakfast is very rich, both Western and Chinese.

The price is the most conscientious among the five-star hotels in Sanya.

For me, the best feature of the hotel is that you can bring your furry children to stay with the owner, which is very convenient! The ladies at the front desk were very friendly to my dog, thank you very much üôè
The swimming pool outside is beautiful and the water is very clean. The hotel has its own very quiet beach, which is very quiet and not crowded. There are almost no people. I like it very much.
Ordered room service twice, the price is very reasonable and delicious! The hotel's restaurant also offers inexpensive set meals every day, which is great!
Next time we come to Sanya, we will definitely bring our furry children to stay here!

You can indeed watch various flights flying low, but the noise is not obvious when the door is closed. The waves are loud even on days when it rains less. My sleep quality is very poor, but it is okay these days.
The sea water is not as good as Haitang Bay, and the sand is not very fine, so you can pick up some small shells, and if you are careful, you will also find many small crabs.
The shortcomings are also obvious. There is no takeout, and you can only order from McDonald's, so you basically rely on the hotel restaurant for three meals. Fortunately, the taste is pretty good. The sauerkraut and beef fried rice is really delicious.
This trip encountered a typhoon and heavy rain. Unfortunately, West Island is right next door and I didn‚Äôt go there for a second visit. Therefore, I especially commend Mila for her careful guidance and arrangements. After getting familiar with the environment smoothly, I feel like I‚Äôm having a lying-down holiday~

The best thing is the beach attached to the hotel. It feels like an uninhabited island. It is so quiet and beautiful that I am intoxicated. Except that there are many rocks, it is not suitable for swimming. In addition, the sun is too hot and the water is so hot that it burns your feet...
This resort is really cost-effective. The only annoying problem is that the sound of planes taking off and landing is a bit loud. Even thick double-layer glass can't block it. Those who are sensitive to sound may need to wear earplugs.
Also, thank you to the housekeeper Angela, who is very enthusiastic and patient!
Finally, I hope that the hotel management can be more flexible and provide a slight discount to the Lone Ranger or exchange the double coupon for other rights.

Service: Like Miss Ivy with her real name, she is very enthusiastic and the service is very good! ! We also upgraded the room type for free!

Disadvantages: There are relatively few breakfast categories and no choice. The standard of ordinary three- and four-star business hotels still needs to be improved compared to five-star hotels. In addition, Sanya focuses on family hotels, but there are not many facilities for children. The new hotel seems to be still being improved.

The breakfast is very rich. The hotel is very close to West Island and Tianya Haijiao, which is very convenient. We only stayed for one day and only experienced the swimming pool. The children had a lot of fun playing in the swimming pool. The whole family said that they did not have enough stay and would choose this place again next time we come~
The barbecue in the ps set meal was a bit lacking, so it couldn‚Äôt be used as a dinner after a hungry meal, so I ordered something else ~ but a delicious green coconut only cost 18.8, which was great!

msg:Hyatt never disappointsüíó
On the last night, I made a blind reservation at the Hyatt, which is close to the airport, and I didn't expect it to be full of surprises.
Because check-in took too long and we had children with us, Miss Cassie at the front desk used her patience to appease the guests and at the same time assigned us rooms. After we were finally upgraded to this room, we were very satisfied. Both the hardware and the view were impeccable. New hotels inevitably have smells, so air purifiers are also arranged. Alex also gave us small desserts and juice to satisfy the guests' needs to the greatest extent.
Because I only stayed for one day, I didn‚Äôt have time to experience it fully. The entertainment room can meet most needs, and you can also play mahjong. It is highly recommended for family travel! The responsiveness and professionalism of the service staff need to be improved. Some staff are not very skilled yet, which is understandable.
The breakfast does not seem to have many types at present, but the taste is good. There is no time to participate in children's activities. All in all, there is definitely room for improvement. Although I only stayed for one night, I have regrets, but the overall experience is great, and I will do it again. Reserve! I will also recommend it to all my friendsüíó

They are very friendly to the children and the activity design is also very interesting. Younger children like it very much and can play for a whole day. The breakfast was great, rich and the bread was delicious.
The shortcomings are also very obvious. There are hidden dangers in the room. The child fell between the twin beds and had a cut of nearly a centimeter on his ear from the edge of the bed. The blood soaked the sheets all over, which was scary for adults. After that, the staff quickly went to the room to stop the bleeding and disinfect it. Fortunately, the child recovered quickly, so he didn't go to the hospital for stitches. He just couldn't touch the water again for a few days. Also, airplanes are very loud! huge! No wonder there are earplugs in the room. I really can‚Äôt sleep without wearing them. And there are a lot of those little black mosquitoes, which bite the most in Sanya. I don‚Äôt know why there are them in the room. Even lighting mosquito coils and turning on the air conditioner doesn‚Äôt help. People who are sensitive to mosquitoes should be careful. The beach is a bit rough, a bit like the Yalong Bay Marriott. The waves are smaller than Yalong Bay and not as good as Sanya Bay.

In addition, the schedule was tight this time and I didn't have time to experience the other facilities of the hotel. I will consider this place next time I visit nearby.

msg:I will never come back to a resort hotel with no temperature. Here are a few examples:

- While having breakfast, there was a girl at the next table who finished her meal but didn‚Äôt finish the coffee in her coffee cup and wanted a takeaway cup. Then I was clearly rejected by the waiter, saying that our rules here are not to take any outside food, and he repeated it twice coldly and forcefully. Compared to the hotel in Yalong Bay where I stayed before, the waiter would proactively ask whether he wanted a takeaway cup or a coffee cup, because he knew that many guests would take coffee to the beach.

- I took the elderly man for a walk on the beach and in the hotel after breakfast. The weather got hotter and the elderly man felt uncomfortable and wanted to drink water. We passed by the breakfast restaurant and wanted to ask for another glass of water, but he was clearly refused. I explained the objective situation and just asked for a glass of water, but the other party still said no in a cold voice. I asked if I could buy a glass of juice, but the other party said that the meal would only open at 12 o'clock, so I couldn't buy it now. I'm so... speechless... Am I here for vacation or begging?

- I stayed for two nights. All swimming pools in the hotel were under maintenance and swimming was not allowed. The construction was very noisy during the day. Did the hotel provide a 100 yuan meal voucher in the hotel's compensation plan? I stayed in this resort hotel for a lonely time...

- It's very close to the airport and the planes are really loud.

msg:This is the hotel with the worst service I have ever stayed in. Traveling with a baby is always the most tiring. Since we arrived early, we booked only one of the 3 rooms. The other two were not good. The hotel told us that we need to wait. , we kept waiting. During this time, I kept asking and contacting the housekeeper. The housekeeper told me that they were waiting. We waited until 3 o'clock and still couldn't check in. I contacted the housekeeper again, and the housekeeper ignored me for a while. There was no other way, so I went to the front desk to look for it. Then the manager showed up and offered to help me solve the problem. I wanted to ask if I wouldn't be able to check in all night if I didn't look for it. The sun was over 30 degrees outside and we were all very hot. I got angry and the manager said that the room type I booked was too small and there were no rooms available, so he had to change it for me. Why do you have to wait until I come to you to solve the problem? Let us stay in the hotel for 4 or 5 hours and you won't solve it for me? what service is this

Fortunately, it was solved later. After entering the room, there were mud spots on the bathtub and stains on the toilet. The welcome fruit was not delivered until check-out. The breakfast waiter didn't seem to have woken up. After waiting for a long time, there was no baby chair or tableware. No one asked if he wanted coffee, nothing! Centipede-like reptiles can be found everywhere in the hotel, including their corpses in the swimming pool! In addition, the Beiye Hotel in this hotel is the worst in Sanya. There are no children's swings, slides and other facilities. Some teachers are always rude and open late and close early! Personally, I don‚Äôt think families with children need to spend one night just to be close to the airport! I have never reviewed a hotel on Ctrip. I just want to protect families with children~

Especially the lady Ivy at the front desk
Very enthusiastic
They often ask us if we need help.
It really feels like going home
	
The room type arranged this time is a sea view room in the VIP Room
Facing the swimming pool, the view is very good
Every day when I wake up and open the curtains, I see the blue sea.
	
The swimming pool is very large and the filtration system is open 24 hours a day.
The water quality is very good. It‚Äôs chilly even if you pat it casually.
And there is actually a free chess and card room and game room. Who knows?
	
The hotel is very large and there are not many people. Friends who don't like noisy can go there.
Enjoy a large beach to yourself üèùÔ∏è It‚Äôs also great for taking photos
The hotel is between West Island Pier and Tianya Haijiao
Traveling is relatively convenient
	
If you are traveling as a family, the hotel will also provide parent-child activities.
The hotel also adopted a stray dog
Sometimes he has to work at the concierge desk,
But now the young lady says that he often comes late and leaves early
Meeting him depends on your lucküçÄHahahaÔøº
It‚Äôs truly a pet-friendly hotel~
	
In short, I still highly recommend Hyatt Tianliwan~
Suitable for young people to come and lie down and relax when they are tired from worküëå
Even if you don‚Äôt go to any scenic spots, you can still have fun in the hotelüéâ
	
Finally, I would like to mention the lemongrass Wenchang chicken in the cafe which is really delicious.

msg:The original plan was to focus on Clear Water Bay, but due to lack of time, we only arranged one night at Tianli. The two-night Club Club package was not available. Unexpectedly, it was the most satisfying. The children wanted to go back to the Hyatt where they could watch the planes. Thank you Ivy The service was attentive and attentive. Considering arriving late and having children with us, they upgraded our room and allowed us to see a beautiful night view from the balcony.
Advantages: This is a resort hotel with its own bay, and cannot be simply used as a transitional hotel! The new hotel rooms and swimming pools are very clean, especially the swimming pool, the water is really clean! It‚Äôs super safe to bring children! The swimming pool is relatively large, and the shallow water area is also that big. It is very suitable for young children to play in the water. The weather is good and it is very interesting. I'm also satisfied with the beach. It's not as bad as the reviews said. There are rocks, blue sky, white clouds and sea. It's a great movie! The key is that there are pink dolphins! There is no guide, and with the pink beach chairs and umbrellas, I am worried that it will soon become a place for internet celebrities to check in... The catering is at Hyatt's usual level, the breakfast is great, there are fresh juices, and Hyatt's products must be high-quality.
Disadvantages that must be mentioned: the swimming pool shading can be optimized, the trees have not grown up yet, and the artistic conception is not good enough, the lawn is still being maintained, the room style is relatively simple, it depends on personal preference!
Thank you again Ivy for your thoughtful greetings. I will definitely come back and stay a few more days if I have the chance!

msg:During this trip to Sanya, I stayed in three hotels, Atlantis, Capella, and Hyatt Tianli Bay. Hyatt was the last stop of my trip to Sanya, and I accidentally browsed it on Ctrip. Since it's close to the airport and it's newly opened, I thought it wouldn't be too bad, so I made the decision.
I didn't have high expectations, but Hyatt still brought me some surprises. First of all, the front desk Ivy Liu Xiafei contacted me one day in advance and added me on WeChat, saying that she would be fully responsible for my service during my stay. Her attitude was sincere and gentle. In fact, she responded to my requests and answered all my questions.
Secondly, when I checked in at the hotel, I really felt that the hotel staff's service was warm, kind and thoughtful. In particular, there is a handsome young man at the front desk, who is good-looking and gentle, and speaks in a nice tone. Unfortunately, I was so immersed in my little brother's beauty that I forgot to ask him his name. üòÇ
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the room. It‚Äôs not big, but it‚Äôs clean and tidy. There are free drinks in the minibar every day, and the sea view is pretty good. There are few people on the beach and it is clean. There are some rocks on the shore, which is a different style compared to the beach in Haitang Bay. In addition, the hotel has a beautiful swimming pool, a chess and card room, a karaoke room, and a billiards room with complete entertainment functions. As the last stop of your trip, you won‚Äôt feel bored even if you stay there for two or three days. Being close to the airport is really a big advantage. You don‚Äôt have to get up early to catch a flight. As for the noise problem, it varies from person to person. I can sleep with my head on the pillow, so I didn‚Äôt feel any discomfort.

I personally recommend adding more categories for breakfast, but overall it‚Äôs pretty good.
All in all, this hotel has just opened and needs to be improved. Although I have regrets after only staying for one night, the overall experience is still very good. I will stay again and give it to my family and friends!

The hotel facilities are very new, and there are not many people. The swimming pool is super beautiful, and children in the shallow water area love it. The breakfast is not very varied but of good quality. The sound of airplanes at night is similar to the sound of large cars passing by the Fifth Ring Road in Beijing, so I can fall asleep. The child was given a cake for his birthday, and his parents even made the most of it by singing in the KTV provided by the hotel.
All in all, it is a very good transitional hotel. It is recommended to rest here for one night after getting off the plane before moving to Haitang Bay.

The hotel is very close to several scenic spots such as West Island, so it is suitable for visiting scenic spots. These advantages must be praised! Considering the price and service, this price is still worthy of five points! Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings and shortcomings. I don‚Äôt know if the hotel is a five-star hotel. Some aspects feel that it does not meet the five-star standard. First, in terms of food, there are very few breakfast categories, which are a little more than those of express hotels like All Seasons. Second, there is little content in parent-child activities. Third, the hotel has a lot of beach loungers, but Tin Lai Bay beach is not. The sand is relatively co**** and there are broken glass! Another suggestion is that when guests make a reservation for a child guardrail, it is best to ask them how many pieces they want. My family didn't know when they made the reservation, so they only installed one piece. As a result, the child fell off the end of the bed at night. Fortunately, nothing happened!

Although the rooms at the Hilton are a bit worse, the service is not bad. It is said that the Hyatt is still owned by the Grand Hyatt, but the service is really the same as the Grand Hyatt. Much worse, the service cannot keep up with the five-star rating. The main contrast is particularly obvious.
Breakfast is also very average. There is a smell when you enter, just like the rag smell that is used to collect food. The kind you can usually smell in small restaurants. Maybe you are sensitive to smells.

When we arrived at the hotel, the service was also very good. A car was always available to take us to the building we were staying in. There were more people in the swimming pool in the evening, but it was still OK and we could swim. There was a guy who greeted us at the front desk who was really nice and enthusiastic about driving us. It was raining heavily when we drove back, so he immediately opened an umbrella and went to the parking lot to pick up my husband back to the lobby.

The lawn wedding in this hotel was really beautiful, the lawn was new and the sea was behind it. We also had a dinner later. I wonder if there is a buffet. This wedding dinner was served per person, so I felt it would be more comfortable to eat at a buffet.

The overall experience is very good and the hotel facilities are also very new. I will continue to book next time I come hereüôå

The hotel's breakfast is also rich in variety, making your stay very safe and secure.

There is also a private beach in the hotel. You don‚Äôt have to go to other crowded beaches to watch the sunset quietly. The breakfast is also very good and the swimming pool It was also very clean because the earliest flight back was on the last day. Sharpay even asked the front desk staff to prepare breakfast for us to eat on the way. A small suggestion is that the bathroom door in the room is too heavy and it is difficult for girls to pull it open, but the overall experience is still Very satisfied! ! ! Highly recommended

Service: The person who received me was Priya. She contacted me by phone the day before I checked in to confirm my arrival time and requirements, so that I could arrange my travel plan more calmly. During the check-in process, I sent her a WeChat message directly if I had any questions, and received a satisfactory reply. It made my stay experience very pleasant.

This hotel is newly opened, so I think I can stop thinking about it. Next time I go to Sanya, I will make this hotel my first stop. At the same time, I want to sign up for Hyatt membership.

1. The overall room facilities are relatively new. The only imperfection is that the door handles of the bathroom and toilet are too slippery and cannot be opened if your hands are even slightly wet.
2. The breakfast categories are of high quality, but there are too few categories.
3. There are rich parent-child activities and the teachers at Yuequ Camp are patient.

Cassie added WeChat in advance to inquire about the needs; left the hotel One kilometer away on both sides are Tianya Haijiao Scenic Area and West Island Pier. The disadvantage is that the breakfast is too simple, there are not many hot dishes, and you need to ask the staff to help you get coffee. There is no self-service coffee machine. In addition, there are no other businesses outside the hotel, making it inconvenient to eat.

Hyatt Tinliwan, this hotel is very new, very close to the airport, you can watch the planes fly by while swimming. When I checked in, I met the little butler, Ivy, who was kind and kind. Seeing that we had two babies, she applied for a lot of generous trea**ent for us, and carefully guided the various services of the hotel. The hotel also has an exclusive fun camp for children, so you won't worry about your baby being bored at all. The breakfast is great, although there are not many types, it is exquisite, and the pastry chef's craftsmanship is superb. The room is big with a great view. Recommended and recommended, friends who are lucky enough to see it can find the lvy little beauty for butler service. Finally, I would like to add that this hotel also has 20 room types specially designed for dogs, so you can take your furry children out together

However, when I went to the Chinese restaurant to dine on the last day, the experience was greatly reduced. From the time we entered to sitting down, we found the seat by ourselves. Not to mention that after sitting for two minutes, no one came to ask. When ordering food, we had to order twice. Finally, a waiter came over with a menu. After ordering, the waiter asked if we needed tableware for children. I answered that we needed to wait for a while. The food was served, but the baby still had no tableware and could not eat. We called the bar again. One of the waiters responded, but no one came over. Since they were far apart, we couldn't directly talk to each other. Several waiters were chatting and laughing, and no one had the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcoming over to serve us. We shamelessly called out again before someone came to stay. I have eaten in so many hotels and restaurants. I have never encountered such a poor service awareness in a star-rated restaurant. I have never been so eager to comment on the quality of a hotel. If you want to stay in a hotel, there is no problem, but you should be cautious when going to eat.

1. Although the minibar is free, it only provides three bottles of drinks, which is not good enough.
2. The room was upgraded by the front desk. The service is okay, but there is a door between the room and another room. The sound insulation is not good enough. The voices of children and parents next door can be heard. The overall feeling is not good. I stayed at the Haitang Bay Edition the next day, and there was a door to the room next door, but I didn‚Äôt hear the sound from next door. Although it wasn‚Äôt as good as the Edition, the soundproofing should at least be better!
3. The worst experience, when I stayed in a five-star hotel, the first time I encountered it, at 11 o'clock at noon, I asked room service for tableware, but they said that the food delivery depar**ent was not at work yet, and we had to go to the restaurant to get it ourselves, and there was no one in your hotel. , is it difficult to ask you to send someone to the room on the phone?

It can only be said that in Sanya Bay, this is the only hotel you can choose. It is a relatively good brand hotel with relatively new facilities, but if you can't live in it, you won't stay.

Sanitation: The sanitation is good, newly opened, and the facilities are very new.

Environment: The outdoor swimming pool is very, very large, and children will really like it.

Regency Club Executive Courtesy: Can be richer


Joy Camp Hyatt players enrich children's activities: the staff are very attentive


Enjoy daily minibar soft drinks: can be enriched

Overall very satisfied, very cost-effective. Although Tianli Bay is not as good as Sunny Bay, it is not comparable. Sunny Bay is the ceiling, and the prices are also turbulent.
So parent-child travel is still highly recommended.
Business office is also good

The survey result given by the manager the next day was that it was left by the child of the previous guest. I don‚Äôt know why it was not on the note two days ago, but it was placed on the bedside on the third day, which made people feel uncomfortable.

The doorman opened the door and carried the luggage.
When checking in, the welcoming lady gave us a welcome drink. I had a drink on a hot day, which was very refreshing.
Nacy, the housekeeper at the front desk, took the initiative to upgrade the room, which is about 10 square meters larger than the original room type, with a good view, so happy :) I also added WeChat, if you need anything, please contact me directly and make arrangements immediately. Let me as a guest feel at ease. Five-star praise!
The lady who cleans the room is also very considerate. She knows that I like to sleep late, so she waits until after 12 noon every day, and uses the lunch break to help me clean. Like it!
2. The hotel is new, the upgraded room is big and comfortable!
The room has welcome fruit, coffee machine, clothes rack and other unexpected surprises.
3. The food in the hotel cafe is good. The breakfast variety is small but refined, and the taste is delicious. I met the chef today and chatted with him. There will be some variety changes every day, and the dishes will not be the same every day.
The dinner tasted great. I ate a set meal and added 2 dishes later, which were all very appetizing. Hyatt's dishes are still outstanding in the industry!
4. The minibar in the room is replenished every day. There are local coconut milk in Hainan, chrysanthemum honey tea and other varieties. This is very a**ospheric, and few hotels can do it!
5. There are not many guests in the hotel and it is very quiet. The supporting entertainment facilities have been experienced. Pay special attention to it. The problem of short opening hours of the swimming pool that was most reported by Ctrip guest reviews has also been resolved. Now the opening hours of the swimming pool are from 9:00 to 22:00.
In short, I am very satisfied with the staying experience of Hyatt Tianliwan and hope to keep it! Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here again :)

Sharpay Wu Haili at the front desk is great! As soon as we get up early in the morning, we are concerned about whether we need any services! Need a promotion and a raise! Ha ha! With her, we feel that our hotel is particularly warm.

The hotel swimming pool is deep and big enough, and the shallow water area is also very large, so the children had a great time playing.
The children's paradise "Yuequyuan" has rich programs and a large area. The older brothers and sisters inside are also very nice, and they can be placed there for children to have fun.
Although only one restaurant is currently open, the prices are very reasonable and the dishes are very good.
The door cabinets in the hotel room are generally handmade, and the drawers are a bit stuck when they are pulled out. The toilet does not have a flushing function, which is a bit disappointing.
The sandy quality of the beach is average, but the surrounding area is not lively and quiet.

msg:I stayed at Hyatt Regency Tianliwan in the commemoration of living in the new and not the old. This is also the first time I stayed in a Hyatt-type hotel. I was full of surprises after staying here, which made me have a good impression of the Hyatt brand.
Private beaches, swimming pools, garden trails, and children's areas are all available. Although the room is not very big, it is small and fine, and the hygiene is also in place.
The price of the hotel restaurant is relatively reasonable, and the products are excellent, which meets my expectations for the catering benchmark of Hyatt hotels.
The breakfast bread is excellent, and the freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices exceed expectations.
The overall service of the hotel is excellent, and all the staff can provide warm service. We praised Kira by name. We were deeply impressed by her meticulousness and enthusiasm, and she also handled emergencies quickly and in place.
a fly in the oin**ent:
1. It may be that the hotel has not been fully completed. The hotel has only one restaurant, which is relatively small for a resort hotel.
2. There are not many dishes to choose from in the hotel restaurant, and there are cases where the dishes are sold out. It is recommended to increase the menu selection and develop a seasonal menu.
3. There are few choices of hot dishes for breakfast. The egg stalls are not open when you check in. The noodle stalls have no local characteristics and the products are mediocre. If there are too few choices of hot dishes, guests who have stayed for a long time will lose their freshness.
4. The hotel is near the extension line of the airport runway, and there are often planes taking off and landing, which is good news for us airplane lovers, but it may not be friendly to guests who are sensitive to noise. From the perspective of the guest rooms in Building 1, it is recommended that the hotel strengthen the sound insulation on the corridor side.
In short, this stay exceeded expectations, and I look forward to experiencing the full Tianli Bay after the hotel is fully opened.

Ivy and her friends are very enthusiastic, whether it's the front desk or other staff, the cleaning lady Luyu or the pool security guard. The layout of the room is comfortable, especially in the sanitary area. When the shower and the bathtub are together, the entire bathing area is opened up, which is much more scientific than the design where the bathtub is arranged in an inexplicable position alone. The swimming pool is so eye-catching, the children are playing like crazy, but the shade is not enough. In addition, it is recommended to add a few more large swimming rings (that is, the dolphins and alpacas). The beach is very large, which is equal to the private enjoyment of the hotel. You can pick up shells and dig crabs. The breakfast was great! Because the itinerary was only for one night, the hotel coupons I stocked up before were useless, which is a pity.

The oversized outdoor swimming pool is open from nine in the morning to ten in the evening.

The service of the hotel is also very considerate. Nicole is very enthusiastic and understands our stay experience and provides better service. The room concierge is also very professional. From the moment you get off the car, there are dedicated personnel to help customers with their luggage.

The hotel is also a pet-friendly hotel, and friends who love pets can also go for a walk~ The hotel staff are very caring, and the hotel also adopted a stray dog, which is the cute little one in the picture~ It works in the lobby, everyone You can see it when you go there.

shortcoming: 
The hotel seems to be still in trial operation, and some areas are still under construction. There is currently only one restaurant, so you can't experience more kinds of food.

Noise: Since the hotel is close to the airport, there will be the sound of planes taking off and landing. People who are sensitive to noise need to consider more, but it is within my acceptable range~

You can only walk on the beach, and there are a few beach chairs~




Overall it is worth recommending~

My only requirement for the hotel is that it should be clean and tidy, giving people a comfortable feeling, instead of having to think about whether it is clean when sitting, standing or lying down. Of course, it would be even better if the staff were hospitable and attentive.

We all know that hotels by the sea are the easiest to get wet, and the wet and sticky feeling everywhere is the most difficult for me to accept. Many old-fashioned hotels in Sanya have a good environment and location. The disadvantage is that the facilities are old and the sanitation is not in place. After reading a lot of reviews of other 5-star hotels on Ctrip, there is still a nest of mice. . Really scared off. .

There is one thing to say. Ctrip still understands customers. After several days of searching, we finally chose this Hyatt Hotel Tianliwan, which just opened in 2023, because it appeared in the list of "guess you like it", and its overall score is 4.9, which is higher than most most hotels. I booked 2 nights first, felt very good, and renewed for another night.

Advantages: The living environment is comfortable and beautiful, the room is clean and in place, there are parent-child activities, children can take care of them, there are various handicrafts, and parents can also participate together. The staff are very enthusiastic, especially Sharpay at the front desk and the manager in the lobby. They communicate with the children carefully and enthusiastically. The swimming pool is great, the bath towels are clean, and the breakfast options are also good‚ù§Ô∏è

Disadvantages: It is relatively close to the airport, and there are planes flying overhead from time to time. It is not suitable for friends who have high requirements for sleeping environment. The beach in front of the hotel is not delicate enough.

The hotel is in Tianya District, 5 to 35 minutes drive from the attractions, depending on where you want to go. For me, I like the area around Yemeng Corridor very much, it takes about 20 minutes by car, and it only costs about 20 yuan by car. The sand on the Coconut Dream Corridor is fine and smooth, there are no reefs, there are many small crabs ü¶ÄÔ∏è and hermit crabs, the coastline is long, and the sunset is beautiful, especially suitable for children to run and play.

When it comes to choosing a hotel, everyone has different priorities, and hotels also have disadvantages and advantages. It‚Äôs best to choose the one that suits you‚ù§Ô∏è

Figure 1 and Figure 2 are the Coconut Dream Corridor. Everything else is a hotel facility.

He is very enthusiastic and considerate. I commend him by name. During the stay, he actively introduced information about the hotel and surrounding attractions, paid attention to needs, and worked really responsibly. The hotel is clean and the facilities are new. There is also a private sea area, which is beautiful for walking and taking photos, and the environment is beautiful. The hotel also comes with tickets to the West Island when booking a room, which is also worth visiting. West Island is also very close to the hotel, as is Tianya Haijiao. Traveling is quite convenient. There is also Tianya Town nearby, where you can also have a cup of coffee and stroll around, which is very pleasant. I will stay at this pet-friendly hotel again next time. There is no cleaning fee. It is highly recommended.

msg:It is highly recommended for families to stay in this hotel!
1. The service is good. Special thanks to Milla at the front desk! On the night of check-in, I took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, and the driver complained all the way, why spend so much money not staying in other good hotels. He has been driving in Sanya for more than ten years, and he knows very well that this is an unknown hotel. But the price I booked was more than 1,000, and I could live in what he called a top-notch hotel. It was almost eleven o'clock when we arrived at the hotel reception. The exhaustion of the journey, coupled with the chat in the car, made me hopeless about the hotel I chose this time after looking at the pictures. But when I checked in, Milla was very patient and comforted me, which made me feel very warm. And I am very confident that this hotel will not let me down. Sure enough, I originally planned to stay for two days, but then directly extended the room for two days, leaving all the Sanya itinerary here.
The other waiters in the hotel are also good and responsive, whether it is children's toiletries or a smile when meeting, it makes people feel very comfortable.
2. Facilities and sanitation. The hotel started trial operation in January this year, although some facilities are not perfect enough. However, it does not affect the areas that have been opened for use. The overall facilities are very new, and there will be no damp musty smell. With the same price, compared to other well-known hotels in Sanya, this hotel is strongly recommended. No matter how good the later maintenance is, those hotels opened in 2018 and 2019 will have a lot of wear and tear on their facilities. (On the third day of this trip, I originally planned to change hotels, so I went to see it with my luggage. There is indeed a gap with the Hyatt that opened this year!)
3. There are parent-child activities throughout the day in the hotel. For post-90s parents who come out to walk their babies, rest assured, the children will never be bored. Even if the child does not like this kind of curriculum activities, the child can still go swimming in the morning and evening when they are not in the sun. Although the hotel's private beach is not as white as Haitang Bay, it is fine. However, sandy beaches with reefs are another kind of beauty.
4. The hotel is near the airport, and there are planes flying by at any time. It's a little noisy, but the hotel provides earplugs, and if the child likes airplanes, this is a plus.
5. The last point is a little shortcoming. The sewer in the bathroom occasionally smells a little bit.

When I was outside the room during the day, there was indeed a sound, but it was not affected at all when I slept at night. At the same time, the hotel service is very online, and every service staff encountered will take the initiative to say hello. The room decoration style and color matching are also very brilliant, the room is spacious and the layout is reasonable. The breakfast may be during the trial operation period, and the variety is slightly less, but they are all very delicious. It is a truly pet-friendly hotel. Dogs can stay in pet rooms. There are courtyards, and dogs are also very happy. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and Tianliwan Hyatt will become the first choice for coming to Sanya in the future.

The hotel is very new, and you can smell a strong smell of wood when you enter the door. The decoration style of the entire room is a style that young people like. There is a coffee machine in the room, equipped with various flavors of espresso liquid, which can be cooked by yourself, and there are several representative drinks in Hainan for drinking in the refrigerator. It is a surprise that TV programs can receive many overseas channels, but it is a pity that there is no screencasting function.
Although the hotel is located in the outskirts of the city, there is a bus stop at the door, and there are several buses. The routes from Nanshan Scenic Area to Dadonghai Scenic Area are all available, and you can even walk to the ends of the earth, only one kilometer away. The distance from the airport is also very convenient, and it takes only 15 yuan to get there by Didi.
It's a pity that there is still a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel that has not been put into use and is still under construction. Tianli Bay is a part of Sanya Bay, and the scenery is indeed relatively ordinary. The beach slope is relatively large, the sand is rough, the waves are large, and the color of the sea is not blue. The photos are relatively ordinary, compared with Yalong Bay, Haitang Bay, Lingshui, and Wenchang. The local sea is incomparable.

msg:About 10 minutes drive from the airport. Perfect if you have an early flight the next day. It is also very close to Tianya Town, so it is very pleasant to have a cup of coffee there.

Environment: The hotel is very large and is still in trial operation. It seems that it has not been fully built, and there are buildings that are still under construction next to it. Because it was newly opened this year, the overall facilities are relatively new.

Hygiene: Everywhere, cleaning staff can be seen everywhere. The only downside is that the hotel's private beach has relatively co**** sand, and the garbage was not cleaned up in time. There are cigarette butts, plastic paper and other garbage in the sand. After the sun sets, there are no lights, and you usually have to leave until 8:00 pm, because it is really dark and it is hard to see if there is any dirt on the ground. I'm afraid my feet will be scratched by broken glass. The outdoor swimming pool is relatively clean.

Service: The overall service is very good, and any staff you meet in the hotel will greet you warmly. Especially the butler who received this reception: Nicole at the front desk. I added WeChat one day in advance to communicate, and I can respond to all kinds of needs one by one.

Catering: Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, the taste is not bad, especially the freshly made waffles are recommended. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is also quite satisfactory. Compared with the ingredients in restaurants outside, it is fresher and healthier. Children are more at ease eating.

Generally speaking, except that the maintenance of the private beach is not perfect and because it is too close to the airport, you can hear the sound of planes taking off and landing every once in a while, everything else is perfect. Now staying for two nights is really cost-effective. If you have a deep sleep and are not easy to be woken up, then it is still recommended to stay at this Hyatt for the last few nights in Sanya.

The beach is also very close, with few people and beautiful scenery. The only downside is that the house is very new, just add more activated carbon and air purifiers, more ventilation and deodorization.

The efficiency may be a little slow, but it is understandable when it just opened. The breakfast buffet is very good. I came here just for the breakfast ü§£Ms. Nacy asked us in advance if we needed to decorate it, because my husband and I came here on the anniversary, and she thoughtfully arranged the room for us. I sent a cake and fruit plate, very üëçüèª. When we finally checked out, we were scheduled to go to the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop at 4 pm, so we were delayed for two hours to check out until 2 pm.

msg:The environment and facilities of the hotel are very good in all aspects. Part of the landscape in the hotel is still under construction. The swimming pool is also very suitable for children. There are staff by the swimming pool, so I feel at ease. The service attitude in the lobby is average, and the desserts and the like are also average and expensive. In short, there is no amazing feeling~ Besides, it is the first time I have met you when you check in. It is strange and difficult to understand, leaving a bad impression; I booked it It is a deluxe sea view double bed room (picture 2) because I used to look at the layout of the room and the real scene evaluation before booking. When I checked in, because I booked a 43-square-meter room, my brother said to help me upgrade it (52 Flat, as shown in Figure 1) The location is very remote, although the sea view is okay, there is no shelter, but the price on the app is less than what I booked, so I strongly request to change the room; because we went out for a while after check-in, It took about 2 hours to come back. All the room types I booked were fully occupied, so I had to upgrade my room and live in a suite. .

msg:Management is disorganized and price does not match the service.
First, check in to store your luggage when you check in. After depositing, I went out for a walk and came back. The clothes that were originally on the suitcase were dragged on the ground. There were staff around, and no one helped to pick up the clothes and put them away again.
Secondly, it seems that the communication between the housekeeper and the hotel service is not perfect. One is that the housekeeper did not understand the hotel's latest policy and gave wrong information, but his attitude was very good, so I just wanted to forget it. As a result, on this basis, I was repeatedly confirmed to provide breakfast package service because I had to catch a flight in the early morning, but I was actually left out, causing me to catch the flight hungry. My room included breakfast, and after I asked the front desk and gave the chat history with the housekeeper about booking breakfast, the front desk did not have any remedial measures. They just said "I didn't see my reservation"... and the subsequent compensation was the following. I went to upgrade my room for the first time. To be honest, I will never stay at Hyatt next time. Having stayed in five-star hotels so many times, I feel that the service in this one is completely ineffective and superficial.

There is nothing to say about the environmental sanitation, they are all new, because they only opened in May this year, and they are very good. The service is also super good. There are waiters and security guards everywhere. It is very reassuring. There are people who can help you anytime and anywhere, but it is not very comfortable to serve. The hotel has its own beach, super convenient! There is also an outdoor swimming pool, which is cleaned and disinfected every day, and there are two or three security guards. Even if you are playing on the beach, there are security guards wandering around, which makes you feel safe. One more praise: the hygienic details of the room, the direction of the shower head will be uniformly arranged to the side every day, so that you will not be inadvertently or when you spray before taking a bath, you will be soaked in cold water immediately; the soft drinks in the minibar are filled every day . The disadvantages are: there is no indoor children's playground, and I see planes flying by frequently, but I think it's okay, the sound insulation gene of glass does not affect my sleep. But it is a "welfare" for children who love airplanes haha.

Beach: I went to the beach at night to catch the sea. The sand is relatively fine, and the waves are so big that I dare not approach it. And some of them haven't been built yet.

msg:The hotels in Sanya are generally old and outdated. I have chosen it for a long time. I chose Maotai Resort before because it is new. Then I went to West Island, and thought that it was just next to the pier in West Island when I came back. It was very convenient, it was also very close to the airport, and there was a beach, so I booked this new Hyatt.
A group of four, three and three small, asked for three rooms. The receptionist Xiao Wu at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room type. He has a good attitude and is a butler-style service with a quick response.
The advantage is that it is very new, and the service is relatively good. You don't have to worry about the old hotel's wall peeling off, old TV, and yellowing of the bedding.
The environment is good, but it's hot, and it's very close to the beach, but it's too hot to go during the day.
It is very close to Tianya Haijiao. If it is not too hot, you can walk. You can also go to Tianya Town to check in. It costs about 15 yuan to take a taxi.
There are quite a lot of parent-child activities, but the three of my family don't like it very much. I still like hotels with more entertainment facilities. Because on the first day of the pool party, I really met adults with low quality. I read it on the Internet before, and this time I really met. It was originally a children's party, and adults should cooperate. As a result, when both parties were playing water polo, the male parent went in and bullied the children. I can't stand it, my eyes and ears are flooded, and I don't know whether it's an adult or a child playing. The quality is too poor, and big men bully children. I hope that the teachers of each activity can remind such parents.
Another disadvantage is that it is not an Internet TV. For children, it is a disadvantage. There is nothing to shop around, eat and buy, and dinner is settled at the hotel, and the food is not too much, and the price-performance ratio of the set meal is not high.
The swimming pool is either too shallow or too deep. Feedback to the manager should be equipped with swimming rings, because the guests really can‚Äôt carry the swimming rings so far and fly over to play, and the small floating blocks provided by the hotel are not safe and not suitable. Smaller dolls.
Then there was our room, after staying for one night, there was no hot water, and the next two nights were spent in improvisation. Fortunately, Sanya is hot in summer, and warm water can solve the problem. In addition, in the room where the old man lives, the sound of the plane is a bit loud, so we still have to choose a location.
This time I asked for a new one, so the overall is good, I gave it five points, some shortcomings can be improved, some are really not the hotel's problem, and the dog couldn't be taken for a walk, it's a pity.
Hope it gets better and better.

The housekeeper, Nacy, contacted me one day in advance, asked about the needs in detail, and upgraded the sea view room with a good view. During the stay, we provided welcome fruit and afternoon tea~Drinks from the minibar~
The staff are very enthusiastic;
The room is very new and spacious, with a reasonable layout;
There are parent-child activities every day, the swimming pool is very large and clean, and there is also a special children's pool;
The variety of breakfast is okay, freshly baked bread, freshly squeezed juice; lunch and dinner can also be settled in the restaurant, the newly opened hotel serves a little slower, but the taste is good.

msg:Because the flight was cancelled, I stayed for another night. There was no twin room due to the temporary extra booking. I once again praised Wu Haili at the front desk. She helped me upgrade the room and arranged an extra quilt. It was very considerate! Solution, the restaurant's new set menu is very cost-effective, with reasonable collocation and delicious taste. In short, Hyatt Tinliwan is a hotel that you don't want to leave after staying here!

msg:Let's talk about the hardware of the hotel first. The hotel facilities are very new, and the swimming pool is currently available until ten o'clock in the evening. The only thing I want to complain about is the hair dryer and paper towels in the room. The hair dryer really surprised me. Although the brand is Philips, it looks like an all-black hair dryer in the 1980s. As for the facial tissue, as long as you wipe it with a paper towel after washing your hands, it must stick to your hands like shredded cotton wool. These two things really don't match the five-star standard.
    Next, let's talk about the service. It can be said that it is the hotel with the best service that I have encountered in more than ten years of travel. Especially my housekeeper Nacy and the aunt who cleans the room! One day before the trip, the housekeeper contacted me by phone in advance to discuss specific matters and added WeChat. After learning that I was bringing children with me, he took the initiative to upgrade the room for me. After I checked in, I have been actively contacting and asking about my needs. The cleaning aunt is also very kind. She hurriedly set off in the morning, and the clothes and slippers were thrown on the sofa in the room. The aunt will help to fold the clothes and put them neatly, and put away the shoes and slippers. Sometimes when I pass by and see my aunt asking for something, she will greet her with a smile on her face. The overall service of the hotel is very good and meets the standards of a five-star hotel, but the housekeeper and aunt are really super five-star. The feeling they give me is: not simply happy to serve you, but happy to be needed by you.
     Then there is the meal, the hotel's breakfast is not particularly rich. But the basic types are also available, and I think it is enough to eat. Especially the pastry bread is definitely above the standard. I have no choice but to have a Chinese stomach, and I still mainly eat Chinese food in the morning, so I can only have a small taste. The Chinese beef porridge, meat sauce noodles and Cantonese-style siu mai impressed me deeply. The dinner and afternoon tea in the set meal are also delicious.
     Finally, let's talk about the location of the hotel. The location of the hotel is relatively biased and not very convenient for travel. Although you can take a taxi, waiting on the side of the road on a hot day is actually suffering. So unless you spend every day in the hotel, it is recommended to rent a car. The road conditions in Sanya are not bad, and there are not too many cars. And the parking fee is relatively cheap, usually only three or five yuan a time. And hotel parking is free.
      Last but not least, thanks again to my butler Nacy! Nice to meet you!

This is the hotel I stayed at on the last day of this trip, but it was the most pleasant surprise. First, the hotel is very new, clean and tidy. Second, the service is very good Cassie, the lady at the front desk, immediately upgraded the sea view room. The room is very big and the scenery outside is very good. She also added WeChat immediately so that we can contact us at any time if we have any needs. The swimming pool is very good. I stayed at the Yalong Bay Marriott the day before, and the swimming pool water Visible to the naked eye, but here, it is very clear, and the swimming pool is huge. The only disadvantage is that it is close to the airport, and the frequency of planes is very high, but the sound insulation effect of the windows is very good, and I have not been affected anyway.

Facilities: Now basically all facilities have been repaired, the swimming pool is large and clean, and it is also very close to the hotel's private beach.
Service: The service of the waiters is also very good. They will greet the guests proactively and are very enthusiastic. Ms. Nacy is very polite and enthusiastic. She added WeChat in advance to confirm the information, and also helped to upgrade the room and apply for breakfast. Like her!
The hotel's parent-child activities are also very good. There are different activity schedules every day, which is very suitable for families with children.
The only fly in the oin**ent is probably because it is too close to the airport, so you can hear the sound of planes taking off and landing, but it is harmless.

msg:This 1 point is for the hard work and enthusiasm of the front desk and service staff. Hyatt is a large group with a very accurate positioning. It is close to the airport and there is a lot of noise, but there are no worries about the source of tourists. Therefore, the design, decoration, and management of this hotel are very simple. The guest wants to leave quickly after staying one night. There are many mosquitoes in the lobby and many flies in the restaurant; the entire hotel is designed like a dormitory for college students; the vast coastline, the left front side of the hotel is actually a muddy artificial farm; there are basically no hot dishes for breakfast, which is a three-star standard. I live in Sanya and the only hotel that was cheated. Such a hotel is actually the charge of a five-star hotel.

I hope that there will be some 8-12 age group in the future. The beach is not allowed to go into the sea. It is suitable for sightseeing and vacation. There are not many people and it is relatively quiet. I hope to stay again next summer. In addition, if there is a washing machine and drying rack, it will be a big plus.

Thanks to Nacy from the hotel for taking the initiative to contact and arrange the room one day in advance. It happened to be my husband's birthday, and I even sent a birthday cake and room decoration! Although some areas of the hotel are still under construction, it does not affect the experience of staying. All the service staff I encountered were very polite and enthusiastic, especially the various activities of the Children's Club "Yue Fun Camp" won the favor of children , full of sincerity and fun! Thank you, teachers, too! The children said that they will choose to live here again when they come to Sanya next year! highly recommended!

msg:After a few days of trip to Sanya, I was lucky to choose the Hyatt Hotel, because I mainly brought my parents and children to Sanya, thinking that Sanya Bay is close to the airport, and there are many attractions suitable for the elderly, so I decided to choose it Hyatt, now that I think about it, I‚Äôm really glad that Sharpay, the housekeeper at the front desk, called me the day before to confirm the check-in time and check-in personnel. Knowing that there are elderly people, he helped us arrange two neighbors for easy care. Knowing that there are children, it was very early I have prepared children's supplies. It's so considerate~ The hotel's check-in time is 3 o'clock, because it's the morning plane, and I arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock. From the moment I got off the bus, the little brother at the door was very considerate to help open the door and pick up the luggage. The housekeeper and the young lady at the front desk also helped us arrange the room in advance. The room is simply amazing. It is a proper sea view room. The elderly and children are super happy. During the four days and three nights of staying in the hotel, every time I saw the staff, I would be happy. Friendly greetings, I‚Äôm in a good mood all day, the room environment is also the light and luxurious style I like. In the afternoon, my little brother will deliver fruit, and the young lady who cleans the room is also very heartwarming. The private room opposite the hotel The beach is also super big, including the hotel's breakfast, which is great, clean and hygienic, and tastes great. Children like it very much. This is a hotel that pays great attention to details. Every link makes people feel warm. I will still do it next time I come to Sanya Preferred hotel. In addition, although it is not far from the airport, there is no noise at all when sleeping. In short, the experience this time is very good.

The beach is a wild beach, with reefs, big waves, relatively few people, the sunset is very beautiful, and many people rush to the sea at low tide at night.
The only thing is food and drink. There are fewer choices for breakfast and the taste is average. The freshly made desserts are more delicious. The afternoon tea in the lobby bar is eaten outside. It feels slow and the taste is very average. For dinner, I ate the restaurant's fried noodles, which tasted okay.
Miss Yuri, the housekeeper, is very considerate and responds quickly to every request. Because the flight was late, a late check-out was also given.

Hyatt's service is as good as ever. Thanks to Sharpay at the front desk for upgrading to a sea view room and for delaying check-out. I went to Huizhou last month, and was disgusted by the poor service and standard of the hotel there. The hotels and sea in Sanya are much better than Huizhou.

The hotel has its own swimming pool, which is relatively clean. It is about 100 meters away from the sea. In the past, there was a large reef. There were jumping fish and crabs on the reef, which is suitable for catching crabs.

But there are also many shortcomings. The facilities are very single, basically only swimming pools and beaches, and the others have not yet been built. Since it has just opened, the room will smell of formaldehyde. The sound insulation effect of the door is very average. In the morning, you can clearly hear the voices of other people in the corridor. The location is relatively remote, there are not many things to eat nearby, and shopping is not very convenient.

The hotel does not occupy a large area, and the landscaping is still very beautiful, but the plants are still a little smaller, and they will look better after a few years after they have just been planted. The hotel's swimming pool is heated. I didn't understand that there were people in the swimming pool early in the morning and at night. I didn't understand it until I stepped in it. It was very good for children and not afraid of catching cold. It is that the swimming pool facilities and equipment are still being perfected, there is no swimming ring provided, and it will take time to operate, after all, it has just opened.
Like Miranda Sirong at the front desk, she helped us make an appoin**ent for KTV singing at a fixed time on the last night, which put a successful end to this trip.
The lack of hardware facilities will gradually improve with the operation time, I believe that Tianliwan Hyatt will get better and better.

It is recommended that you go to the swimming pool after 5:00 pm, otherwise you will get dizzy. Those with children can participate in the hotel's fun camp, and there are many activities every day. If you want to eat, the hotel dinner set is good, there are many restaurants in Tianya Town nearby (15 minutes by taxi), and there is a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. In short, the hotel has provided everything that the hotel can provide, and I feel Hyatt's intentions!

The breakfast is rich, the environment is elegant and not crowded, the service is orderly, rice noodles and noodles have different contents every day, and the baked muffins are excellent. The cheerful and outgoing instructors of Joy Camp are very popular among children! In terms of hardware, the room has ample space and the facilities are very new. It is also directly upgraded to a sea view room. It is not a sea view in the corner, but a comprehensive sea view! The exclusive beach is quiet and the water is clean. 100 meters next door is the West Island Pier, which is also very close to the airport. But the surrounding environment is relatively remote. Overall, this stay is super cost-effective!

It feels much more convenient than other places in Sanya Bay where you need to cross the road to get to the public beach. There are few people on the beach, and there are plenty of beach chairs and water taps. The location is very convenient to go to the West Island Pier. There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is okay.

It is really close to the airport. If you catch a plane back and forth, staying for one night is really worth it! Milla and Sharpay at the front desk helped to upgrade the sea view room on the ninth floor. You can watch the sea while lying on the bed. There is also a large balcony where you can dry clothes or lie on the sofa in a daze. The bathtub also has a sea view. The room is really super satisfying! The key point is to praise the welcome fruit and send a plate of nectarines. The peaches are really delicious! ! We showed off in two days! It‚Äôs even more delicious than the Mandarin peaches we live behind!
At present, the spa and children's paradise are not open, and the beach lacks entertainment facilities. Others are really great! ! ! Although it is newly opened, there is nothing to say about the service. The unknown little brother who took the initiative to help with the luggage looked weak and couldn't take care of himself, but he walked away quickly with my two suitcases. Praise hahaha

Service: The service is nothing to say, it can be worth ten stars. Every staff member I met was warm, polite, and considerate. They patiently solved problems in the middle, and they were very considerate of customers. In particular, Si Rong at the front desk would like to call and praise her. She contacted and added WeChat the day before our departure. Then we asked about our needs and arranged rooms for us, and upgraded us to a super sea view room (the kind where you can see the sea while lying on the bed). Although the air conditioner in one room went on strike when we first checked in, we changed to another room, which resulted in two rooms for our family. One is in the east and the other is in the west, separated by a whole corridor, but it does not affect the satisfaction with the room.
The afternoon tea included in the package is generous, and the breakfast variety is also rich and delicious, and the waiters in the restaurant are also very good. The reef beach by the sea is very nice to take pictures. If it is not perfect, the swimming pool is a bit sunny during the day, and it is only open until 7:30 at night. It is said that there are not enough staff in the swimming pool. It would be better if it can be opened for more time! All in all, the stay was very comfortable, and I felt that it was not enough after staying for three days. I usually seldom write reviews. I wrote so many words this time without knowing it. I will come to Hyatt again when I have the opportunity.

msg:I stayed for one day, but the experience was great, the location is very close to the airport, and travel is convenient. Sharpay at the front desk of the hotel helped to upgrade the sea view room in advance. Knowing that it was my birthday, they specially prepared a birthday decoration and cakeüç∞. The hotel's supporting facilities are great, swimming pool, gym, KTV, mahjong room, everything is available, and the best thing is that there is a private beach, where you can catch small crabs in the sea. The best thing is that the hotel's afternoon tea and breakfast are all five-star. None of them are thunderous. The price/performance ratio is really high. I will choose this hotel next time I bring my family to Sanya. Although the hotel is still under construction and optimization, it will definitely become an internet celebrity hotel in the future. I look forward to your next stayüåà

The hotel is very new, not all areas are open, and the gym equipment is also quite good. The West Island Pier is nearby , You can see the West Island directly opposite the room, which is very worth going, the vacation is great, and the breakfast is also very good.

The room was upgraded to a sea view bed, and the check-out was also delayed when I left the hotel. Every waiter had a good attitude and was polite. The room facilities are complete and functional. The only downside is that there are too few dishes in the restaurant, and there are no more than ten varieties of dishes that can be ordered, which is a bit regrettable.

msg:The last stop before leaving Sanya was Hyatt at Tianli Bay. I have lived in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay before. Sanya Bay is very close to the airport. It takes about ten minutes by car. Of course, the plane basically flies by. This Hyatt has opened for trial operation not long ago. The hotel I stayed in before was relatively old, so I specially wanted to choose a new one. The service staff is still very enthusiastic, and the advantages and disadvantages of the hotel are also obvious. The facilities of the new hotel are great. The rooms and public areas are clean and tidy. The air conditioner is effective and cool. Unlike some hotels where the air conditioner is turned on, it is still very hot. The equipment in the room is also very good. You can see the sea from the door, the sandy beach with reefs and the ends of the earth. The same style, very good production, and related service needs can be responded in a timely manner. The disadvantage is that the lounge, children's paradise and other areas are not open yet, there are not many things to play, the greenery has not fully grown, there is a slight smell of new furniture, and the sound of airplanes can be heard when sleeping (but it does not affect my sleep). For the time being, only A restaurant (tried lunch, the taste of the dishes is still good). If all the supporting facilities can be done well, the experience should be good, and I hope to try it next time.
Facilities: Some areas of the trial operation are not open, with new equipment and new decoration
Hygiene: clean
Environment: comfortable and cool
Service: Enthusiastic, timely response

There are also check-in fruits and soft drinks in the mini bar.
The breakfast options are limited, and the freshly baked croissants are great. The hotel is very close to the airport, about 20 minutes by taxi, but at the same time, there are unavoidable sounds of planes taking off and landing, and there are occasional noises at night.
There are fewer people on the hotel's beach and swimming pool, and they are not very crowded. Facing the sea is a nice experience

In addition, the hotel's breakfast is also very rich and exquisite, and tastes very good. There are different dishes every day. Even if you don't go until ten o'clock, all the dishes are available, and the replenishment is very timely. The hotel's private beach has deck chairs, which are free to use. There are children's life jackets and floating boards next to the pool that can be used free of charge. There are also towels and ashtrays on the deck chairs. The details are very good. The purchased package comes with two West Island tickets. The hotel is very close to the West Island Pier, and it only takes about 10 minutes to walk. Overall, this stay was very good, and I will choose this hotel next time I go to Sanyaüëç

msg:advantage:
1. The internal and external facilities are very new, the outdoor swimming pool is beautiful and clean, there are people to help pick up the boxes when you get off the car, and the facade is in place.
2. It should be the only high-end hotel with a private beach in the Sanya Bay area. If you want to visit a few check-in attractions (Haitang Bay is too far), and want to stay in a luxury hotel, you can choose it. Tianya Haijiao and West Island are very close.
3. The breakfast in the cafe is rich and delicious, especially the croissant. The dinner with executive benefits is also good. If you want to stay at this hotel, it is recommended to choose a room in the Grand Club, so you don‚Äôt have to look for dinner everywhere.

shortcoming:
1. It‚Äôs so close to the airport! The plane flew overhead at night. Maybe it was because I was not used to it on the first day and had insomnia. My mother took sleeping pills. I got used to it in the next few days, but I would wake up inexplicably once every two or three o'clock (I usually sleep well). In short, if you are concerned about the noise, you should think carefully and don't believe the comments that you can't hear it if you close the glass.
2. The room is very small and has design problems. The TV cabinet cannot fit in. The aisle leading to the balcony is narrow. The distance between the twin beds is very small. The layout is cramped. Only the bathroom is large, but there is no curtain with the room!
3. There is a very pungent smell in the elevator, similar to dirty clothes that have been fermenting for several months... I can't understand why the elevator that looks new and clean has such a smell, and it has not improved for several days.
4. When we were given a 300 yuan cafeteria meal voucher, the waiter did not remind us that there was a set menu available. When we ordered the pineapple fried rice, he did not remind us that it would be too much for two of us to finish... This meal is enough for at least six people... Is it a question of service attitude? Different people have different opinions.

PS There is no need to go to West Island if you are not doing marine sports. There is only a small beach in Hong Kong. Other attractions are huge pits. My mother was amused by the century-old sea study room.

I originally booked four nights, but due to the cancellation of the flight, there was no way to cancel the stay of the last two nights. In terms of hotel hardware, there is nothing to say about the new hotel that has just opened. In terms of service, I felt the welcoming smile, meticulous and patient service from the moment I entered the door. I entered and exited many times, and the weather was very hot. Every time I greeted, assisted in opening and closing the car door, and took luggage. Ms. Nicole Ji Ting at the front desk is also very enthusiastic. She patiently helped to upgrade the sea view room. She took the initiative to send a message to introduce the hotel's various supporting facilities, the surrounding dining spots, and actively and carefully asked if the room needs to be cleaned, whether it is necessary to delay check-out, etc. After the store, I continued to care and greet. There was also a waitress who offered to provide her own nursing products when she learned that my wife was uncomfortable during her menstrual period. She was answering the phone at the time and didn't have time to ask her name. In addition, every time you enter the restaurant to eat, the waiter will take the initiative to guide you to a seat, which is very polite. This is the first time I write a review so seriously, the main reason is that the hotel environment is really great, all the services are really great, and the experience is really great. Because of you, this trip to Sanya is worthwhile!

Hygiene: The room and bedding are very clean, as are the public areas such as the lobby, restaurant, and swimming pool.

Environment: Open the curtains to face the sea, the hotel's unique beach looks good no matter what you take!

Service: Praise the housekeeper Nicole, who asked for information and prepared children's supplies the day before check-in, and cared about the check-in experience throughout the process.

Finally, I recommend friends who go to West Island to stay in this hotel, it's super close and easy to live in!

msg:Let me talk about the hardware first: the hotel is newly opened, and its style is more business-like. It is close to the airport, and there are planes flying overhead from time to time, but the room is very soundproof. There is nothing to say about the hardware facilities, but parents and children are weaker at this stage. Fortunately, children are satisfied with swimming pools and beaches.

Catering: Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it is more delicate, especially the dessert, which tastes at the standard of a five-star hotel. The buffet is not open yet. There is a seafood restaurant nearby that is not bad.

The focus is on the service: the housekeeper, Nacy, called and added WeChat in advance, and upgraded us to a superb sea view room. She would contact me every day. She was considerate and thoughtful. It can be said that she responded to every request, which made us very touched. The next time I come here, I will also find the housekeeper nacy.

msg:I generally don't write negative reviews. The biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is on the beach. However, the sand on the beach is very rough and the sea water is not very clear. The new hotel rooms still have a smell. The sound insulation of the rooms is poor and it affects your rest. The hotel staff will recommend wearing earplugs to sleep. In addition, Ctrip did not mark that this hotel is on an airplane route. There are planes passing by 24 hours a day. Flights leave every 3-5 minutes during peak hours and 15-30 minutes in the early morning. The noise pollution is serious. Of course, if you want to watch or take pictures of planes, this is the best place. Location, you don‚Äôt need to book a high-level room to book a room, just an ordinary room, but the room size is larger and other basic configurations are the same. There are still many hotels in Sanya with the same price and level to choose from. If the price is around 500 per night, breakfast is included. This hotel is optional and objectively rated as the Hyatt Hotel‚Äôs lowest cost-effective hotel!
I hope the platform can note this hotel on the flight website! ! !

The sea view direction where we stayed had great views.
The service is just lacking somewhere. As soon as you sit down during breakfast, a waiter tells you with a straight face that the place is busy and asks you to move to another table.
The facilities are very new and have many highlights, but they are a bit dull. For example, the swimming pool has only a huge outdoor one and no indoor swimming pool. With the current temperature, it is quite cool to swim outdoors unless the sun is shining brightly.

In addition, the hotel is very close to popular areas such as West Island, Tianya Haijiao, and the airport, and the transportation is very convenient!

msg:It's a perfect itinerary, although it's only two days, but the whole journey is very comfortable.
First of all, milla contacted me two days before the trip to confirm the purpose of the trip and was very nice to help and pay attention to whether the room type could be upgraded.
The airport is very close to the hotel, and it takes more than 10 minutes by taxi. On the day we arrived at the store, milla was not there, so we were received by Tristan. The handsome guy was not only handsome, but also very nice and carefully made various arrangements for us. The communication was very pleasant and comfortable, and he also treated us well. After the game, I gave good suggestions and gave people a feeling of spring breeze.
The sea view room that was upgraded for us has a good view. From the balcony, we can see the line of sea and sky, and the color is very beautiful. The elevator hall and rooms of the hotel are all made of Li nationality brocade as the waistline. The sense of fashion combined with ethnic style is very characteristic.
However, there was a small problem with our room, and Tristan kept apologizing. The next day, he helped us change to a room with a better location. In order to match our departure time, we delayed our check-out and gave us afternoon tea.
There is also a good breakfast, exquisite pastry, and a beautiful restaurant environment; there are few guests in the recreation center, where there are mahjong machines, table tennis, billiards, etc., and there is also a ktv. It is good to make an appoin**ent with the management staff in advance for the ktv to play when the time comes. The sound effect is not bad, the two of us sang very high.
The swimming pool is currently open until 7 pm. The lifeguard said that it is because the lighting is not up to standard, and it needs to wait for further verification to pass. Those who like night swimming will feel a little regretful. Swimming at night to watch the stars and watching the planes fly by from far to near should be a very pleasant thing. I look forward to the next time.
The beach is quite stormy. We stepped on the water by the water, and the staff also kindly reminded us not to go in, for fear of safety. There are sofas and small wooden canopies on the beach. It is also very good to sunbathe and listen to the sound of the waves here.
Regarding the noise of the plane, it is generally within the acceptable range, and the hotel has earplugs, so you can't hear anything with itüôâ
In addition, the West Island and Tianya Haijiao I went to personally think are very beautiful. The key point is that they are very close to the hotel, which is very convenient. It is very wise to choose Hyatt Regency Tianliwan if you don‚Äôt want to be tired and comfortable for a 2-3 day trip.

After landing in Sanya, we rented a car and went to the hotel. As expected, it was very close to the airport, and it took only 10 minutes to drive there. The lady at the front desk, Sharpay, was very nice, and she gave us a surprise when she helped us check in: the room type was upgraded for free and when I entered the room, it really lived up to its reputation, the sea view is so beautiful! The view is very good!
The hotel's breakfast is also great, but the air conditioner is a bit fierce, and you have to wear a long sleeve for breakfast.
The hotel has its own beach, which should not be fully developed yet. It is equipped with a faucet for flushing the sand. Taking pictures on the beach has the illusion of a private room.
Free mini bar consumption once a day, as well as fruits for check-in. In short, the service is great, and I will choose to stay here next time I come to Sanya!

1. The housekeeper, Sharpay, was very enthusiastic. He communicated with me about the check-in in advance, and helped me upgrade to an invincible sea view room, facing the sea, and made honeymoon arrangements; also, drinks from the minibar are free! After drinking, I contacted the housekeeper directly and arranged immediately. Although the drinks are not worth much, the service is very comfortable. I like it.
2. The newly opened hotel has very new facilities, and the room decoration is in line with the aesthetics of young people. It is very comfortable to live in, so that the feeling of going to Westin is very big. . . What's especially important is that Hyatt's air conditioner is very powerful, and it can blow you cold. Compared with those old hotels in hot summer, this is definitely an advantage!
3. The scenery of the hotel is very good, it is also close to the sea, there is an independent beach, there are relatively few people, and there is no feeling of eating dumplings.

The reason given was that the street lights were not installed, and it has been on for several months? The set afternoon tea is very average, it is better not to do it. As a Hyatt-type room facility, many can be saved. Is this cost-saving? Breakfast until 10:30, business hotels are fine, but resort hotels can‚Äôt be justified. Sanya Bay‚Äôs more than 1,000 yuan can‚Äôt go on. Don‚Äôt you pay enough attention to details? No one delivered the suitcase to the room. Is the luggage cart at the door a decoration?

msg:The hotel is located between the West Island and Tianya Haijiao Scenic Area. It was newly opened this year, and it is a trial operation. It will officially open in about July. It is really an experience feedback after staying for two days:
1. Surrounding environment: The surrounding environment is relatively desolate and not very prosperous, but ** takeaway is still covered in it. The takeaway is no problem, but the delivery time is a little longer. It is located in front of the West Island Wharf and the Tianya Haijiao Scenic Area. It takes less than 10 minutes to take a taxi from the hotel to the two places, which is quite convenient. It's about 15 minutes by taxi from Phoenix Airport, very close, suitable for returning to catch a flight!
2. Hotel environment: Newly opened hotel, clean and tidy, the hotel itself is not high, the highest is 10 floors. There is a swimming pool, the deepest is 1.5 meters, and the connected children's pool is 0.5 meters. The hotel is about 5 minutes away from the beach to enjoy the exclusive sea view, away from the crowds.
3. Service: The service is good. The front desk contacted and added WeChat one day in advance, and answered questions truthfully and seriously. Upgraded the room to have a better view. Calling room service feedback is also very timely.
4. Disadvantages: In the trial operation, there are no facilities for children, and there is no place for children to discharge their discharges. Only the swimming pool can play. The breakfast is not very rich and there are relatively few choices. It is difficult to make an appoin**ent with KTV, and there are no other entertainment activities. The hotel itself does not have a convenience store, so it is inconvenient to purchase.
In view of the trial operation, we look forward to improving more service facilities in the future, improving the surrounding environment and serving customers better.

Service: The attitude of the hotel service staff is very good, just right, very comfortable. In particular, I would like to thank Borg for helping to upgrade the sea view room for the honeymoon, which is great. The sun is just right, and it is super blue, not losing to the sea in Thailand.
Catering: There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is very fresh and tastes good. Especially the croissants, freshly baked, are so delicious, I really want to take them away.
Facilities: The newly opened hotel is very comfortable to live in, the layout is reasonable, and the cleaning is very clean. You can also play for a while in the entertainment center, but remember to make an appoin**ent for ktv!

Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt go to West Island this time, and we didn‚Äôt expect that the current Tianya Haijiao is quite well built. Weaknesses of the hotel: The bathroom door handle really needs to be changed, even if you have a little strength, you can't open it! The door of the room cannot be closed automatically, which poses a safety hazard. Newly renovated, it still has a bit of a smell... The flaws are not hidden, especially when I go now, the price of Ctrip is really good, and the price/performance ratio is very highüëçüëç

Those who are sensitive to smells in the newly opened hotel will still smell some smells when they first check in, but they get used to it quickly. The hotel is very close to the airport, and the sound of planes taking off and landing is very influential. You can still hear the sound of the plane in the early morning, so there are earplugs for the spare parts... It's not bad for washing and care, but it's too small, and the hair volume is too much. One bottle of shampoo is definitely not enough. The minibar does not provide carbonated drinks, but some local soft drinks in Hainan. The couple dinner included in the package is not recommended. The taste is very average. It is recommended not to buy a package with dinner. The hotel breakfast is still good, star standard. From the hotel to the duty-free shop, you can arrange a free duty-free shop bus. There are quite a lot of mosquitoes on the bus. I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel for those who want to stay in the hotel for vacation. If you only have a daily outing for sightseeing, it‚Äôs still recommended. After all, the price/performance ratio is OK, and it‚Äôs very close to the airport. There is an old Hejia Houanfen near the hotel. It is highly recommended. I ate the dross vinegar hot pot.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: First, the waiter is very enthusiastic. It can be seen that he has undergone strict training. Before I checked in, the housekeeper Sharpay contacted me. I added WeChat and sent Sanya‚Äôs travel information and weather conditions. Follow-up and the housekeeper in various aspects The communication is very timely and efficient. Every waiter in the hotel has a warm smile and takes the initiative to say hello. Tianya Haijiao is close to scenic spots. It takes about ten minutes by car to the airport and you can walk to Tianya Haijiao. It is suitable for people who fly in the morning and evening flights and old people who like to visit scenic spots. Well, it is clean and quiet. One side is blocked and the other side is the Tianya Haijiao scenic spot, so the hotel's beach is basically owned by the hotel. There are many shells, and salamanders and crabs can be seen in the reef.
Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages: First, any publicity at present does not indicate that it is currently in trial operation, and the swimming pool is closed at 7 pm. It is not a small blow to the children who come back from dinner and are thinking about swimming. The weather in Sanya in May , It‚Äôs only morning and evening to get into the water. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is open from 9:00 to 17:00, which perfectly avoids the best swimming time. It was not informed of this when booking. All publicity is based on the new hotel as a gimmick, and there is no mention of it at all. Trial operation, all the shortcomings are justified by the trial operation, which is really disappointing. Although the hotel sent two copies of Qingbuliang as compensation afterwards, this is really something I am particularly dissatisfied with. The second is that the infrastructure is not perfect. Many places in the hotel have not been repaired. There is no light on the road to the beach at night. I am alone. Halfway there, I dared not go forward. Later, when I came back, I met two tourists and walked to the beach together. Many places have not yet planted green plants, and the saplings are still piled on the ground. There are no activities at night. For those who like to be lively It is particularly boring for people with children. Third, it is very noisy because it is close to the airport. You can hear the sound of planes taking off and landing when all the windows are closed. Sanya Airport has a large passenger flow, which is once every few minutes on average. No wonder the room is given Equipped with 3m earplugs; the fourth is that the details are not in place. Although the waiter is very enthusiastic, the replenishment of bath liquid and paper towels is not timely, and there is no replacement after cleaning. The bath salt is not given the next day. I called the front desk and said that I need a bath Salt, but the toothbrush and body wash were delivered. The paper towels have not been replaced. They ran out the next day, and I didn‚Äôt bother to call to ask for them. A few days ago, when I stayed at the hotel in Yalong Bay, the waiters would weigh in when they cleaned it. New ones, if they are almost used up, a new box of tissues will be placed next to the tissue box; Fifth, there are not many varieties of breakfast, which may be due to the lack of people. The quality of breakfast is okay, but compared with other hotels, the variety is still very good The sixth is that the bed in the twin room is relatively small. When a family of three travels, I usually like to live in two 1.35-meter twin rooms, but the hotel's visual inspection bed is only 1.1-1.2 meters, and it is quite crowded for a family of three; A Hyatt, surrounded by private houses, not a hotel belt, the surrounding facilities are not as complete as Yalong Bay Haitang Bay, and there are fewer options for takeaway.
I still use a group purchase activity price on a certain platform. In fact, this price is in the off-season in May, and there are many hotels in Yalong Bay to choose from. If I knew in advance that it was a trial operation and there were so many imperfections, I would definitely not choose it with my baby. Here it is. All in all, there is one thing to say, this hotel should be good in the future. After all, the beach is not bad, and it is far from the airport and the ends of the earth. It is a good choice for young couples, business people, and the elderly. I still believe in the quality of Hyatt, but this time the stay was really not pleasant, mainly because the previous publicity did not mention the soft opening at all, and did not clearly inform the time of various activities, I felt that I was deceived by the adverti*****t. Now that it has opened, even if there are not many people, there should be some. If it is a trial operation, when booking and publicizing, it should be clear about the time of trial operation, the specific use time and opening time of hotel facilities and activities. I also hope that the hotel can do better in terms of details!

Thanks to Sharpay, the front desk service butler, for his considerate service, upgraded our room, and prepared toiletries for the children. The room is big and comfortable to live in, and the room aunt is also very patient to clean the room for us. My husband and I are very satisfied, and my husband said that he will stay here again next time! The hotel is very close to the West Island scenic spot we went to, and it is convenient to drive there. We had a great time. The next day we went to a distant scenic spot, and applied for a room extension for us. The service is always great! Everyone can rush! !

The hotel facilities are new, the rooms are very large, and the scenery is invincible. You can see the sea from the bed. You can also see the Taurus on the opposite West Island. The hotel gave you a ferry ticket to the West Island. I didn‚Äôt plan to travel on a business trip, but I still took the time to go up there. It‚Äôs a very beautiful island.
The breakfast is also very good, a very happy trip.

msg:First of all, Nacy's service is really great, very meticulous and thoughtful, and the boy at the front desk when leaving the store is also very good.
But the hotel called me the day before check-in and said that it would upgrade me to a sea view room. After check-in, the scenery outside the window is as shown in the picture. . . Since we agreed to upgrade in advance, we should be sincere. Otherwise, it is better not to mention it. I don‚Äôt know what the manager means by asking the front desk to give such a room. Other people‚Äôs upgrades are not like this, and there is no garden view in the comments. Such.
Go to the balcony to enjoy the scenery. There is a construction site outside. I was woken up by the sound of construction after 8 o'clock in the morning. Why not call it a room with a view of the construction site? Where is the sea? I have never stayed in a hotel with such a bad environment and scenery. It takes about 500 meters to walk from the front desk to the room. The experience is extremely poor and I am extremely speechless.
Be careful when you want to stay.

Since it may be a newly opened hotel, some facilities and equipment are not yet perfect. It's a pity that the children's swimming pool is not open. In fact, the variety of breakfast can be more. The room is very clean, but the paper was not replenished in time, and the phone in the room was broken, so I couldn't call the front desk. But overall it is quite satisfactory.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. It is close to the airport, the hotel is new, the interior decoration and soft furnishings are quite high-grade, and the standing items are user-friendly, close to the needs of tourists
2. The ceiling level of service (my wife said on the side: don‚Äôt the hotel services in Sanya all have ceilings), yes, we have been to Sanya for six consecutive years, and we have been to many five-star and above hotels. The service is compared to our inland cities It‚Äôs indeed a ceiling, but I think Hyatt‚Äôs service is considered a ceiling compared to Sanya hotels. The housekeeper Nacy added my WeChat the day before we checked in, and then thoughtfully upgraded us for free after checking the room status the next day Room type, and also asked whether room ceremony arrangement is required. Since we arrived at the hotel early when we checked in the next day, after learning that the room hadn't been furnished, we volunteered that we didn't need to decorate it, but Nacy still took the initiative to send red wine to apologize.
3. Tianli Bay is far away from the West Island. The beach is somewhat different from Yalong Bay and Sanya Bay. There are some reefs exposed on the beach, which has a primitive beauty.
4. The food in the hotel is very good. The afternoon tea provided is exquisite and there are many types. The breakfast is relatively rich, especially the quality of the fruit is very good, which is better than the quality I bought in the market. It can be seen that the purchasers are attentive.
Let's talk about the shortcomings:
1. Because the hotel is only open, some children's facilities and external infrastructure are still under construction.
2. The swimming pool is not too big, and the distance measured by the watch should be about 40 meters long, and you need to go around half of the garden after getting out of the guest room (have you read Feng Shui, so you don‚Äôt lose money)

Overall, Hyatt is quite good and can be used as the first stop of travel or as a hotel before the return trip

There are a lot of shells on the beach, and the children like it very much. Ms. Nicole at the front desk thoughtfully prepared air purifiers and children's products. When the weather changed when she was not in the room, she even called to help to collect the clothes from the balcony. She was considerate everywhere. In any corner of the hotel, the staff will greet you warmly. Part of the environmental project in the square outside the hotel has not yet been completed, and I hope to come back to experience better service after all the work is completed!

Environment: The environment of the newly opened hotel is OK. It is very close to the airport. I thought it would be noisy at night, but I actually think it is acceptable. The hotel also provided earplugs.
Hygiene: There is no problem in terms of hygiene, and the cleaning is also timely.
Facilities: Because it is a newly opened hotel, there are a lot of them that have not yet been opened and experienced. There are chess and card rooms, KTV, and children are very happy to sing. The swimming pool is also open, and there is also a beach. There are many small crabs and shells on the beach. Children like it very much.

msg:For more than ten years, I have been to Sanya countless times, and this time it was an unexpected surprise.
I thought the hotel was in trial operation, and some facilities were not perfect, so I was a little nervous, but after reading the detailed analysis of high-level members in the evaluation, I felt that it was within my acceptance range, so I chose Tiantian for the sake of clean environment and clean rooms. Laguna Hyatt.
I‚Äôm really happy to stay for three consecutive days, because I‚Äôve basically stayed in five-star and luxury hotels in various bays of Sanya (except the very old ones, I don‚Äôt want to try them), so I know very well that I can maintain The room is so clean and the staff is still warm and attentive, which is very rare.
Especially before I checked in, I added Nicole at the front desk of the hotel on WeChat. He greeted us carefully every day and understood our needs. In addition to quickly solving our needs, he would also take the initiative to serve more details. Sanya hotels during holidays are very good. Rare.
I deliberately chose a bay that is different from the previous ones. I just wanted to try something new. The beach and the reef are combined, but the sea is very clear and layered. There are some small shells on the beach. The swimming pool is very clean and there is no strong smell of disinfectant. It is very close to the West Island.
The room is spacious and bright, the balcony faces the sea view, and the hotel's dog fudge is very cute.
Thank you Hyatt's manager and nicole, knowing that our return flight time is late, and delayed us until 18:00.
I will come again next time and will introduce it to relatives and friends. After all, in resort cities, five-star hotels strive not only for room decoration, but more importantly, to make guests feel like a spring breeze, warm and attentive, so that the whole vacation will be perfect and comfortable.
The photos are all the sea without filter, which can be used as a reference for donkeys.

The room is super big and the staff are very good and enthusiastic in all aspects. I booked the wrong room that day. The manager on duty, Manager Li, was super enthusiastic and gave us a new room. I made a reservation and extended the check-out time, which was very good. While walking in the park, a waiter driving a battery car passed by and asked us where we were going. He asked us to take us there and introduced the park to us. We went to the beach in the evening. The waiter saw us on patrol and took the initiative to call us with a flashlight. He was very considerate. The hotel is very big and there are corridors connecting every place, so we don‚Äôt have to be exposed to the sun. The drinks in the hotel room water bar are all free, but unfortunately we didn‚Äôt know, hahaha, we didn‚Äôt drink them. The hotel is newly opened and the hardware in all aspects needs to be improved. It is recommended that the hotel lobby get some fragrance to make it more upscale.

msg:The hotel is newly opened this year, the rooms are very new, close to the seaside, and the scenery is beautiful. We checked into the hotel in the evening. The concierge service at the front desk was very friendly. The hotel arranged for us to be in the building next to the main building. We could open the balcony and see the sea directly. Although it was not far from the main building, there was a hotel car to pick us up every time we went to the front desk. Especially the front desk concierge Jeff Wang Jing can remember the room number of each guest and recommend delicious and affordable restaurants nearby for every meal. The wonderful vacation starts from the first day in Sanya.

The only small suggestion I have is Can you open a door in the direction of the restaurant in Building 5? Otherwise, it will be really hot when walking in the sun. Anyway, I will choose to stay in Sanya next time. It is a very good hotel.

The room still smells, planes are whizzing by, the five-star hotel has only one restaurant (cafe), the lobby is very small, the greening in the park has not yet taken shape, there is only one swimming pool, there are no parent-child water play facilities such as water slides, and the beach is not allowed to go into the water. The quality of swimming, lunch and dinner is only mediocre. Everyone is here for vacation. Has Hyatt degenerated into this?

It is very quiet and very comfortable.
Service: The guest room is cleaned very cleanly and meticulously. Shoes are neatly arranged, nightgowns are folded, cosmetics are neatly arranged, and towels are placed. It's so meticulous, praise. The mini bar will also be fully replenished, with a lot of mineral water, 2 bottles in the bathroom, 2 bottles at the bedside, 2 bottles in the refrigerator, and 2 bottles at the bar.

He added me very enthusiastically, helped me upgrade the room type, and sent me hotel dishes and so on. But the soundproofing of the hotel is so bad! ! ! I had read reviews before and many people said that the soundproofing was poor. I came here after seeing the hotel's reply that they had taken measures to correct it. But it didn't feel like it had been corrected at all. A plane flew over once every ten minutes, and the sound was as loud as if I was sitting on the engine. The breakfast at the hotel was sp**** in variety, but the service staff did not take the initiative to change the bone plates, not even once. They just put the finished ones next to them (it seems to be a management problem, because the breakfast service staff were not idle and seemed quite busy. )

This kind of hotel with geographical advantages is not too bad. 2 The hotel is brand new, and the new decoration can give people a sense of pleasure. 3 The food and beverages are very good. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it is very delicate. Both lunch and dinner are very good, especially the char siu. 4. The service is really good. I feel that I have never encountered such a friendly service after 20 years. The housekeeper, Joanna, is very responsible. She has arranged everything properly from before departure to departure, and she can feel that she really wants to do things well.
The main disadvantage is that the landscape has not been completed, and some places cannot be visited. Once this is done it won't be a problem.

msg:The hotel was newly opened in 23 years. I made a reservation with the mentality of trying it out. The result was very pleasant. I got the most satisfactory service experience in the history of staying in the hotel. Let me talk about the service first.
 1 Butler service Immediately after the order was placed, the butler called and communicated with the store to ask if there were any special needs. Did you bring any children? He was very considerate and learned that I was sensitive to smells. When the room had no smell, he told me that I would put an air purifier in the room and Open the balcony door for ventilation
 With this pleasant conversation, I added the housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat. Her name is Nicole. She is a very smart and considerate lady who answers every question and takes the initiative to greet me. Not only did she send me meal time guides, but when she found out that my spouse had a stomachache, she asked me what I needed. Which helped and said the restaurant can make brown sugar ginger tea very warm girl
2. The restaurant serves breakfast. The leading coffee is freshly ground fruit. The staff at the stall are freshly cut and replenished in a timely manner. The variety is relatively rich. The pastry chef is holding a baking tray and asks us at each table: the hot bread is freshly baked. Would you like to have a piece? I love it die this place
  The lunch waiter took us to sit by the window. I said that this place is air-conditioned, why don‚Äôt we sit inside? The waiter said that the scenery here is good and you can see the sea. Then he brought a cashmere shawl to my mother. What kind of fairy service is this? The family package sent by the hotel did not cost an extra penny
  In the evening of the next day, we went back to the hotel and made an appoin**ent with the butler for a free set meal (we like beef, shrimp and cold dishes). The lady in the restaurant already knew us and asked how we were doing. It was another day of loving the restaurant.
3 Swimming pool My daughter and I were sitting on the balcony watching the sea. My daughter saw that the swimming pool was clean and beautiful, and there were two lifeguards on patrol. She wanted to go swimming. She learned it for a few days when she was a child, but she was too timid to learn it. I think she must It came back after getting wet and stayed for two hours
  I saw that as soon as she arrived at the swimming pool, the lifeguard helped her spread a large light yellow bath towel on the sun lounger under the parasol, and took mineral water. The two talked with each other, and then brought her a floating board, and then took the trouble to guide her and encourage her to invite her back then. If my coach teaches her like this, she will be able to learn to swim~
4The front desk provides lemonade in the lobby of the hotel. The water glass feels very clean. It‚Äôs so hot after coming back from the outside. My little brother handed me a glass. Why are you so considerate? There is also a large plate of Korla pears arranged next to it, which goes well together
The girl who looked like a supervisor at the check-out front desk sincerely asked me if I had any suggestions and sent us outside the gate (the doorman who helped us with our luggage at check-in had already put the luggage in the car again) and asked when she saw us with the car Do you want to bring some mineral water to drink on the road, so I felt emotional again and wished I could go back and stay for a few more days haha
  I stayed in this hotel for three days. This hotel has the best service I have ever stayed in. It has gathered all the advantages of the hotel I have stayed in before. The service staff are friendly and professional. When I write this comfortably, an old word suddenly pops up in my mind: feel at home, I used to think it was an adjective, but now I think it is an adverbial
Let‚Äôs talk about the sanitation that hotel owners pay attention to. It‚Äôs a newly opened hotel, so everything feels new and clean. I believe the follow-up maintenance work will be done well.
Walk through the swimming pool for about 300 meters and you will come to the beach. This sea has not been developed yet, and there are no tourists on the beach. It is an exclusive beach. You can walk on the beach and wait for the sunset. You can also sit and watch the waves crashing against the rocks. It is not recommended to go to the sea and be careful.
Of course, the hotel also has its shortcomings, just like there is no perfect house when buying a house. The planes will often pass by the sky, and the noise is quite obvious. The room is equipped with earplugs, which I didn‚Äôt use.
The hotel is close to West Island and comes with tickets

The location of the hotel is very good, and it is very convenient to take a taxi *^O^* The taxi driver said that he had never heard of it and asked if it was a new hotel, hahaha, but don't worry about the accurate navigation location - because it is still in trial operation, some facilities are not open yet , I believe that in a few months, the name of the hotel will be famous~ There are occasional noises before midnight when it is close to the airport, but it will not affect much if you sleep late for travel and play.
The front desk service, concierge, cleaning, restaurant service staff, and chefs are all very good. They will patiently communicate and answer any questions. Because it is a family trip, there are elderly people, and the hotel is also very caring.
Stayed in a twin room, you can see the outdoor swimming pool, went to play with the constant temperature, three security guards hahaha, full sense of security! The room facilities are all new, and the small sofa on the balcony is also very comfortable. The point is that they are all very new! ! Our family is very satisfied (*¬ØÔ∏∂¬Ø*)
The complimentary afternoon tea and family dinner taste very good üëçThe old lady always praised
Summary: worth it! It's worth it! I will come to play next time~

msg:Bringing a baby under two years old and mother to Sanya to watch the sea, people of all ages are airsick, so make an appoin**ent in advance to leave the hotel near the airport for a two-day rest before going to Yalong Bay, Tianli Bay Hyatt, they will officially open in June, we 3 When I went at the end of the month, it was still a trial operation. I booked their garden twin room for two nights on Ctrip. Let me talk about my actual housing experience:
1. Front desk: Half an hour after I booked the hotel, Nancy at the front desk called and asked me about my departure and landing time, added my WeChat, and asked me again about my request for a room. My child is two years old. It‚Äôs the first time I come to Sanya to see the sea. I hope to upgrade to a sea view double bed. Nancy immediately sent me photos of the sea view double bed and double bed, and suggested that I have a bigger room with a double bed, which is suitable for children, because I am with the elderly and children, Nancy upgraded me for free with an extra bed of 1.3. I sleep in a big bed with my child, and my mother sleeps in an extra bed. They are next to each other, and the child is not afraid of jumping on it. , I am really grateful to Nancy. During the stay, no matter how late it is, as long as I send her a WeChat message, she can reply immediately. When she is on vacation, she can also help us arrange things. It really makes us Feel at home. On the last day, we delayed check-out until two o'clock, and we didn't check out until the child woke up from a nap. This kind of service is really humane.
2. Room service: On a hot day, the aunt of the room depar**ent brought an extra bed with a flushed face and helped us tidy it up. The child suddenly vomited at night, and the vomit spread from the balcony to the toilet, and the sink was everywhere. I called the front desk and arranged for an aunt named Wu to come over and clean it inside and out, and even disinfected it. From the beginning to the end, the attitude was very good. Before leaving, my mother kept saying thank you to her, and the aunt was also very polite, saying that it should be done, and the favorability of Hyatt instantly increased. Because I had to make milk powder for my child, I didn‚Äôt dare to use the kettle in the room. The housekeeping depar**ent came over and replaced it with a new one for me. This is the first time I‚Äôve encountered such a humane and thoughtful solution. I‚Äôm also very moved. At least the kettle used to make milk for children can be used with confidence.
3. Restaurant: The child can‚Äôt eat a lot of things, and he didn‚Äôt say to eat seafood as soon as he got off the plane. One is afraid of stale diarrhea, and the other is afraid of acclimatization, so he chooses to eat at the hotel. The whole price is very reasonable and the dishes are also very good. Delicious, stone pot beef, pineapple fried rice, very distinctive. On the second night, we continued to choose to have dinner at the hotel. The service of Xiao Song, the deputy manager of the restaurant, was really great. Knowing that the child is two years old and does not take medicine, he offered to help us change the steamed fish on the menu into fish fillets in unsalted chicken soup. The fresh sea fish of the day was the most popular, and the chef asked the chef to stew a salt-free coconut chicken maw for the child. He brought us a bowl of warm water and said that we can rinse it off for the children. In this regard, it is the first time that I have a waiter who is so considerate of parents with children. Taking the children out can make the elderly and children eat well. The food is better than anything else, so I must thank Xiao Song. The next morning, I steamed an egg custard for the child (the hotel does not provide steamed eggs for breakfast). My mother said that the service is impeccable, and at the same time Thanks to the chef for serving the guests so patiently.
This is basically a team of young people, the communication and exchanges are much smoother than those of the old five-star hotels, and they can give you instant feedback.
The disadvantage is that it is close to the airport, and the hotel is just on the landing route, so it is a bit noisy, but the hotel is equipped with earplugs, which will be much better after twelve o'clock, but for a family with a baby like us, it's okay to fall asleep when tired I can't hear you anymore. On the contrary, the child was excited for a long time when he looked up during the day and saw a big plane flying overhead. The hotel has a private beach, but the sand is a bit rough. When we checked in, the beach was still grinding the sand. I heard they said that it needs to be finer. It‚Äôs good to walk around the beach and play with the sand, but the waves are a bit big. Taking pictures on the big reef is also very nice.
There are a few more points worthy of praise:
1. The hotel is more than 900 meters away from the pier to West Island, which is very close. I had a big suitcase that day, two adults and one child. It was too hot and tossing to walk there at noon. The distance was too close and I couldn‚Äôt get a taxi. Help from the front desk We arranged for their colleague's car to take us to the West Island pier. I am also very grateful.
2. The hotel's swimming pool is divided into reasonable divisions. There is a special children's pool. It is shallow and safe for children to play in the water. Two lifeguards are always watching by the side. If there is anything wrong, they will come over immediately. This is also very good.
3. It was getting dark in the evening, and we were about to go to the beach, but the security guards kindly persuaded us to leave. We were afraid of the big waves and it was not safe in the dark. The security guards kept us on the main road before watching us leave.
I am a person who pays great attention to details, but I am really satisfied with my stay at Hyatt this time. The whole hotel gives people an extremely comfortable feeling, which makes my journey much easier. Thank you to all the people in the hotel. I figured it out, during my stay, I should have disturbed at least ten staff members, thank you again, come to Sanya, don't worry about landing, Hyatt is the first choice.

msg:I think the location of the hotel is very good. It is suitable for friends who come to Hainan for the first time and visit the scenic spots. It is very close to Nanshan, Tianya Haijiao, and West Island. The airport is also nearby. It can be the first or last stop. Tianya Town next to it is also special beautiful
Facilities: Hotel Facilities The hotel's newly opened facilities are not complete, but they are just enough. The bathroom floor is the kind of imitation wood floor, so it feels almost bad, but I just think it should be better

Service: I think the breakfast is delicious, although not much, and the bread is better than Edison's
Basically, I haven‚Äôt written such a detailed review, because Ms. Kira at the front desk has asked for more since I booked the room. We have to get home the next day, so we delayed the time deliberately, which is convenient for us
In fact, everyone here is very good.
At the same time, I also hope that the hotel may be better in the future with complete facilities, and I look forward to it

msg:It took me a long time to find a hotel that suits my needs. The newly opened service attitude is very good, considerate and polite no matter where I go to the hotel. Since I arrived very late, the young lady upgraded my room and sent me breakfast and took me upstairs. They sent me the route of the nearby scenic spot. The service is nothing to say. The room is super big and very comfortable. The floor-to-ceiling windows and the endless sea view suddenly make me feel good. I will choose this place when I go to Sanya. After all, the newly opened surrounding facilities are not very complete, but there are advantages and disadvantages. At least It‚Äôs a very comfortable stay now. I hope the hotel can keep it. It‚Äôs very close to Tianya Haijiao. It only takes 20 minutes to drive to Guanyin on the Sea. It‚Äôs also very close to the airport, so it‚Äôs very convenient. If you want a quiet and comfortable vacation, breakfast is definitely the first choice. The variety is not too much, I hope to improve, but the service staff in the restaurant are really super polite. Now many five-star and above hotels in Sanya don‚Äôt have this patience.

msg:The price/performance ratio is very high during the off-season, and all the facilities and services you should have are basically there. The breakfast variety is of normal quality, the housekeeping service is standard, and the front desk service is normal. The hotel only has one all-day dining restaurant with very few dishes. There are no restaurants around. If you don't order takeout, you won't know what to eat if you stay for more than two days, and the waiting time for food will be a bit long. Parent-child activities are suitable for children over 3 years old. Children aged 2-3 years old don‚Äôt know where to go when the sun is very bright, so they can only wait in the room until the sun goes down before going to the swimming pool or beach. The sound of the plane is really loud. Closing the balcony door is a little better. It doesn't matter if you sleep late or wake up early.

msg:Thanks to the service butler Millla, who is beautiful and kind, and the service is superb. All kinds of care during the stay, and any problems can be solved in time. There is also welcome fruit in the room. Because the arrival time was relatively late, the handsome guy Tristan who checked in gave us a free upgrade of the room type. The service is super considerate. Ms. Nicole at the front desk was also very enthusiastic to help deliver the luggage and take us to the room. The breakfast is also very rich and very good

Hygiene: clean and tidy
Environment: So-so, the beach is not yet finished, the greenery is not in place, there is no sense of experience, the night view is not bad
Service: The concierge staff at the front desk are very enthusiastic. This is a plus point. I did not experience breakfast due to the change of the plane.

Before I checked in, I received the care of Miss Cassie at the front desk. She was very gentle and considerate and upgraded me to a sea view room. On the last day, I went to Tianya Haijiao, which is very close to here. Come again next time.

msg:I can only say that this experience is passable. The scenery outside is good. The takeaway counter is very convenient. You can reserve a private beach. It is also passable. There are not many types of breakfast. The dog is very cute. The price cannot be said to be very expensive (Atlanti). The room may not look much better than here in a seven-star hotel.) Disadvantages: The location is a bit remote and you have to walk a long way to take the bus. The delivery person has to walk a long way. Do you need tableware for fruit delivery? There is also a lobby where you can consider adding a Corgi, Shiba Inu or Samoyed. In short, it is so many times better than Shanghai Hampton Hilton Hongqiao Airport.

msg:I have traveled to Sanya N times. I have lived in many five-star hotels in Sanya, and they all feel that way, such as: Yanlord Crown, Edison... I always hope to find a beautiful environment, quiet, comfortable room and board, even if I don‚Äôt do anything, I will let myself be in a daze A place to feel healing and comfortable. After reading the good reviews of the hotel guests on Ctrip, I checked into this hotel that only opened in January 2023 with the attitude of giving it a try. Although the hotel is brand new, it does not have the usual odors of formaldehyde and decoration materials left shortly after the renovation is completed. It is no exaggeration to say: there is really no smell at all. Because of my rhinitis, I am particularly sensitive to smells, and I didn't have any reactions such as runny nose at all during the two days I stayed. The decoration of the whole hotel is simple and stylish, but very grand, the decoration materials and quality are very good, and small details such as connecting seams are well done. Chatted with the general manager of the hotel for a while and learned that the dog in the photo was originally a stray dog, but the general manager loves dogs. He took it back to the hotel and cleaned it up and left it in the hotel. It has become a favorite of both hotel guests and employees "Town shop dog". During the two nights I stayed, I saw the staff taking their dogs to the beach to play. What a happy dog! Therefore, the hotel is very pet-friendly. There are more than 20 rooms with small yards, which are convenient for guests with pets. Mr. Xiaofu at the front desk received us very politely, attentively, politely and very nice. What I have to mention is the hotel's catering, which is the most satisfying hotel for me to live in. The breakfast was very delicate and delicious. After I was full, I couldn't bear the temptation of food and stuffed a lot more. It was really a journey to gain weight! The complimentary afternoon tea is simply not too good! All kinds of pastries and snacks are still so delicate and delicious! The family dinner as a gift gave me too many surprises. I thought that the gifts would not be very good, but we were so full of praise that we almost jumped out of the wall after eating. Let's talk about the swimming pool, as shown in the photo, it is beautiful! The night view is even more beautiful! The deepest part is 1.5 meters. Shallow and deep areas are clearly visible at a glance. It may be that none of the guests who checked in that day liked swimming, but I was the only one who went for a swim after eating afternoon tea. I am the only one in the whole swimming pool, and it is reserved! This feeling is so good! I like this hotel very much. I am in a hurry this time. I hope to bring my beloved dog to go again and run on the hotel's exclusive beach.
This is the first time to write a review with so many words. There were almost no reviews before.

msg:Miss Ivy was very considerate. She helped to upgrade the room type when the one I booked was no longer available. She also arranged a suitable room according to personal needs. If your store's funds are not so tight, you may consider adding a disposable bathtub bag in the bathroom. Although the staff can disinfect the bathtub, it is considered a public facility after all, and it would be better to have a bath bag. In addition, the way the restaurant prepares the Yangzhi Manlu is a bit strange. It contains something that is hard to chew and seems not very palatable.

The hotel is very new, the swimming pool is good, the breakfast variety is not many but the quality is better, the friend who stayed at the dinner said it was also very good, the noise from the plane My friend said that it is acceptable. Nacy's service is very good, the room type has been upgraded, and the private beach is also very popular. I also met Feng Xiaogang and his party at the hotel. I hope the hotel facilities will be improved as soon as possible.

msg:The itinerary on a whim, the hotel booked temporarily, just because there are few people here, and I want to be quiet, but I didn't expect it to be the biggest highlight of this itinerary. After the reservation was successful, the girl Sirong at the front desk added me on WeChat and asked about my needs. Regarding my question about the smell of the room, she personally went to the room to check and sent me feedback and took a video of the room. When checking in, Meimei at the front desk was very enthusiastic. She brought water, donuts for my son, and printed homework for my son. Every time you go out and return to the hotel, the guy at the concierge will open the car door for you and say "Welcome back". This feeling is as warm as coming home. When the child was swimming, although he could swim and his father was beside him, the lifeguards still kept an eye on the child seriously. Dad went home early, and only my child and I continued to stay in the hotel. Due to stomach discomfort, the child vomited all over the quilt late at night. The waiter who came to change the quilt cover did not complain, and brought the manager on duty. After asking about the child's situation, he told I don't want to be afraid to trouble them. If the child is going to the hospital, I must tell them to accompany me. I am so touched. Early the next morning, we received a greeting from Si Rong, who extended our check-out until 3 o'clock. When we checked out, all the staff there were concerned about whether the child was better. At this time, the child vomited again. A handsome guy wearing glasses took us to a place in the lobby bar where we could take a rest. It was not too dirty and helped me to throw away my hands. The vomit that I wiped the child in, and gave me some advice. The child's condition should be stable. When we left, many of their staff came out to see us off and said "welcome again". Yes, I will come again. When I come next time, all the facilities should be repaired. Children will have more fun. Compared with other mature bays, this place is slightly more remote, but the water is bluer, there are fewer people, and there is no hustle and bustle. Although I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya that are famous for their service, it is the first time that this hotel has full service online. The real thing is that the service is not limited to the appearance, but that he can handle it well when an accident occurs. Well, as far as I'm concerned, they've done a really, really good job. This is why I will stay again in the future and recommend it to my friends. The team here are really great, thank you.

msg:The hotel is very new, although many facilities are not yet perfect, but everyone's work is very meticulous and enthusiastic Also, Maxim's thoughtful service and proper arrangements added many surprises to our experience. We have our own house in Sanya, so that we can go to the airport the next day so that we can bring our children to live here in advance. Although the location of the hotel is near the flight route, there will inevitably be noise. The service attitude of the hotel has completely offset these problems, so we can't help thinking about it all the time. We have stayed in hotels in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay during the Chinese New Year, because we come to Sanya every winter and are no strangers to all hotels. Now that we have children, we pay more attention to hotels. Hygiene and service. I am a graduate student in Switzerland and majoring in hotel management. Whether it is a professional or a guest, I personally think that the Hyatt in Sanya Bay is the hotel that gives me the best experience in staying. Although Atlantis is also good, but the baby is here After sleeping there for two nights, I developed rashes and itching, including the mangroves in Haitang Bay. There is no cleanliness here, so we don‚Äôt want our children to play in the pool for fear of causing trouble to othersüòÖ

From home to hotel is actually a very easy process of gaps, but Hyatt‚Äôs service made us miss it very much after returning to Shanghai. I hope to stick to it and we will definitely go back to experience it in the coming year.

Miss all the staff in the hotel Cheers! I wish everyone success in work and a happy life

The front desk service butler, Sharpay Wu Haili, contacted me one day in advance, asked about personal needs, arrival time, etc., added WeChat, sent some Sanya strategy, and sent the weather forecast on the same day. I also reminded me to do sun protection, and helped me find sand digging tools, so that the old aunt also experienced rejuvenation, very thoughtful. After arriving at the hotel, I learned that I directly helped to upgrade to a high floor. The room is not very big, the bathroom is spacious and easy to use, and there is a cloakroom (partition). The room still smells a little bit, but there is a high-power air purifier in the room. It seems to be from blueair, with a capsule coffee machine, and a daily free minibar. I booked a two-day package at the hotel, including daily breakfast for two (exquisite, attentive, and delicious), and a free afternoon tea (picture 8). A family set meal (Picture 5/6), in particular, the standard of the restaurant is very high, if you don‚Äôt stay, it is recommended to taste it, recommend coconut chicken soup, stone pot beef and white-cut chicken. Staying for two days, I feel the hotel's intentions. No matter the front desk, the doorman, or the restaurant, I can feel that the arrangements are made by the elite team management staff. As long as there is a slight need during the formalities and in the restaurant coffee bar, etc., just take a look around, and the first time There will be a response. I hope the hotel can maintain its standard after it officially opens, and I will come to stay again if I have the opportunity. Thank you for your hard work and thoughtful service. It feels good.

‚úçÔ∏èService: First of all, the staff here are very warm and friendly, especially our housekeeper Kira Li Tingting‚ù§Ô∏è, who started to pay attention to our arrival time before we checked in, and even upgraded our house. Because the Lantern Festival just happened to be in this hotel, she also asked the kitchen to prepare glutinous rice balls üòã and put them in the room, so that we could have a sweet supper after playing, and my heart was very warm. We are also very comfortable chatting together, a very hearty friend. There is also a handsome guy named Robin, who told us about places to eat, drink and have fun in Haikou. Of course, there are many staff members whose names we can't remember and whose names they all made the check-in staff feel very kind.
‚úçÔ∏è‚ÄãEnvironment: Because it is still in the trial operation period, some facilities have not yet been perfected, which is understandable. I heard that there is a huge children's playground. After the official opening, I will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity to experience it.
‚úçÔ∏è‚ÄãHygiene: The hygiene of the public areas is very clean.
‚úçÔ∏è‚ÄãSafety: Haha, I have to mention this too. This hotel has a big swimming pool üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Because there are few people staying and the weather is a little cold, there are not many people swimming. Sometimes my baby is alone, but in The lifeguards here, no matter how many people there are, will keep their eyes on the people in the swimming pool to ensure safety, which is very reassuring. Here to say thank you to them, thank you for your hard work. There is also the staff who can see the security patrol at any time, which makes people feel very at ease. üëç
‚úçÔ∏è‚ÄãLocation: The hotel is very close to Sanya Airport, the plane ‚úàÔ∏è flies overhead (it will be a bit noisy, but I think it‚Äôs okay), and the West Island is right next to it, you can walk there.
üëâ‚ÄãOur family of three liked this stay very much, mainly because I like clean, new and relatively quiet places, so newly renovated and newly opened must be the main factors for selection. The only thing that I can't change is the layout design of the room. I can't help it. I don't like this layout very much. But I heard that there is a pet room hereüêï‚Äçü¶∫üêà, friends who can‚Äôt do without bear children, you can choose here with bear children. The puppy in the picture is the mascot of the hotel üòú Its origin I hope that those of you who like this hotel can explore it by yourself.

3. The beach of the hotel is also very good, not the thinnest one, but it can also be played.
4. You can see the planes when you look up, one after a while, which is quite interesting.
Let's talk about the shortcomings;
1. The hotel's standard sea view room, but you can't see the sea at all.
2. There is no barrier-free passage in the underground parking lot, so you have to carry the box down the steps.
3. There is still a little smell in the room, but it will be fine after opening the balcony door, which is within the acceptable range.

msg:I was very lucky to choose the Hyatt Regency Tianliwan. I didn‚Äôt notice that it was a newly opened hotel when I booked it. I just wanted to find the one closest to Tianya Haijiao, but I encountered a warm reception from the moment I arrived at the hotel entrance. The staff felt very warm in an instant. Special thanks to Robin Huang Xianjia from the concierge depar**ent. The young guy is not only enthusiastic, but also has excellent service! To be honest, because of his enthusiasm and sincerity, I have doubled my favor for the hotel. For this trip to Hainan, I only booked one day at this hotel because I wanted to go to the ends of the earth. The rest are five-star hotels, but in terms of service, Xiao Huang is the best hotel staff I have come into contact with these days. Not only serving us as a concierge, but also taking care of the introduction of various attractions, the purchase of the best tickets, letting us eat cheap seafood without stepping on the trap, going to the most affordable food court for locals, and helping us compare the various prices on Dianping. , in short, let us spend the least money to eat and play the most worthwhile places. When we left the hotel, Xiao Huang has been caring and helping us. I kept disturbing him when I was unclear, and he took the trouble to help us. In fact, I know that it is not his obligation to leave the hotel, but he is still enthusiastic and wants to thank Xiao Huang from the bottom of his heart, serving him all the way like a friend. It is really lucky to have such a staff member in the new hotel, and we are even more lucky to meet Xiao Huang. I would also like to thank Lara Wang Wang Wenjiao and Sharpay Wu Wu Haili for their excellent service and helping us solve the hotel problems in a timely manner. I hope this group of enthusiastic young people can work smoothly, and I hope that more friends can meet this sincere and enthusiastic concierge Huang Xianjia, Robin, and the service-conscious and enthusiastic staff of the hotel [happy]

It should be in the trial operation stage. Many facilities have not yet opened and some areas are still under construction. However, these deficiencies are made up for by the service attitude. Sanya exploded this year, no matter where it went, it was not satisfactory. Perhaps because there are few open rooms, this Hyatt can still maintain a five-star service standard, and Sharpay, who is in charge of us, has always been able to respond to questions in a timely manner. It can be regarded as a surprise of this trip to Sanya.

During the stay, he not only introduced the hotel facilities, but also introduced the route of the scenic spots. Sanya stayed for 6 days. The original plan was to stay in "Tianliwan Hyatt" for 3 nights before changing to another hotel. Because Manager Fu was very considerate, the whole family stayed in the hotel for another 3 nights and stayed in Hyatt for all 6 nights. During the stay, Manager Fu was responsive throughout the whole process. During our trip to Sanya, Manager Fu provided suggestions on travel, dining and entertainment for me and my family.
The hotel includes breakfast, which is very delicious. I also tried the set menu for lunch and dinner, which were very delicious. During the stay, I often ask the hotel to deliver Chinese food to the room, which is very convenient. The western cooking methods on the menu are healthier.
The hotel accommodation is very convenient and private. Except for the sound of birdsong, everything is quiet. The public swimming pool is very clean and the children had a great time. Five minutes walk to the beach.

The hotel also implements butler service. The day before the check-in, the butler will contact you by phone to understand the guests' requirements and reserve the room. Our little butler is Nico, who is very proactive and has thoughtful and meticulous service, adding a full sense of wonderful experience to the trip!

There is a capsule coffee machine in the room, and a German Karcher for hygiene, which is very clean. There are many planes but the sound is acceptable. Swimming is not allowed on the beach for the time being, and you can only play in the water next to it.

It was the first time I came to Sanya, and I felt the enthusiasm and care of nacy during my stay. I was responsive and answered every question, which made me feel the quality of Hyatt. As a service ambassador, nacy contacted me in advance, and specially arranged the room for me. There is also a follow-up after the store, asking about the demand! Must like! I had a very happy stay. The sea view of the room is beautiful, it can be said to be the best sea view. The bed is very soft, and you don't want to get up when you sink in. The hotel environment is good. The design is exquisite and the breakfast is delicious.

The hotel's service is great, and the restaurant (breakfast and dinner) has good products at an acceptable price. The dinner boy knows how to arrange the plates, and he doesn't know how to arrange the three dishes horizontally (some places have taboos). Like it. There are free k-rooms, which need to be reserved in advance. The balcony of the room faces the sea, with the sea breeze blowing, lying on the sofa bed is really comfortable! The air conditioner in the room and the balcony door are automatically sensed. When the door is opened, the air conditioner is turned off. This needs to be paid attention to. No wonder we kept pressing the air conditioner and there was no response. We only found out after asking. All in all, this trip is very satisfying!

The hotel is very new and very comfortable. Although the beach is not comparable to the beach and sea water at the hotel where we live in Haitang Bay, the view from the expensive sea view room is very satisfying. The only inconvenience is that the balcony door is not easy to close, and often cannot be closed tightly at one time, resulting in the air conditioner in the room not being activated, and only realizing it when it feels hot. All in all, thank you Nicole for giving us a great experience.

The air conditioner was turned off early at 10 o'clock when leaving the store. I don't know if the air conditioner is broken or on purpose. I wish customers would come later and leave earlier? The overall chain-to-price ratio is lower than that of peers at the same price

msg:I stayed at this hotel while waiting for the plane, I came here after reading the reviews
There are a few issues that I hope the hotel will pay attention to
1. Do not follow the idea of selling express hotels when arranging rooms. There are not many people staying in the hotel, but the rooms on the far side are arranged. Don‚Äôt have this kind of thinking. Because the vast majority of people who come to Sanya to live in this kind of place are tourists.
2 The beach is too cheap, so I have to make up for it myself
3 The swimming pool has no theme. Seeing two couples with their children in the bare swimming pool, they must be very speechless. There is no good beach, at least you can walk your baby and play in the water.
4 The decoration should be cheated, and many details are far from the level, which should not be the case in a brand new hotel.
5. The service is also a problem. The front desk is very polite, but if there are few people, you should take the caring route and be more mechanical.
I suggest that the boss find professional people in management, operation and sales. There are many places that need to be rectified. The peak season is coming soon. Don't let avoidable problems become negative reviews.
