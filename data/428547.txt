msg:There is no understanding about privacy in this hotel. If you need to inform guests about you will check fire alarm - you can inform them at the check in . No need to send housekeeper to give me the paper when I already in the room and maybe I'm sleeping or having *ex with my wife. Even if you need to give me this paper - you can put it under the door. No need to knock like a crazy and ringing. So I need to stop what I'm doing and go open the door just to stop this crazy lady from breaking in. Also not cool , that after shower I need to wipe the floor with towel cause there is no rubber at the shower's door. Will attach the photos. Also why only 3 portions of coffee? We are a couple. So or you left 2 or 4. Why 3? Like we drink coffee together and than only one of us? From other point, guy at the reception understood my complain, apologize and offered us a bottle of wine. It's nice , but next time we will go to Jumeirah ü§∑üèª

I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude for the exceptional hospitality and service that you provided during my recent stay at your hotel. Especially from GSM team like Nikki, Betty etc. They leave us a memorable impression from the moment I arrived until the moment I departed, I was treated with the utmost care and attention, and all of them went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was both comfortable and enjoyable.

The facilities at your hotel were truly outstanding, and I was impressed by the attention to detail and the level of luxury that was evident throughout. My theme room was beautifully appointed and provided all the amenities that I needed for a comfortable stay. My little kid Leyton is loving it that is his birthday trip. The restaurant Chef Jiang also give us a unforgettable memory that we can truly enjoy the local Cantonese food however.

But what truly set my stay apart was the exceptional service that I received from your staff. Everyone that I encountered was friendly, professional, and genuinely committed to ensuring that I had the best possible experience. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone went out of their way to make me feel welcome and to ensure that my needs were met.


Once again, I would like to thank you for providing our family an exceptional experience during my stay at your hotel. Your commitment to excellence and attention to detail are truly remarkable, and I look forward to returning to your hotel in the near future.

Sincerely,

Truman CHEANG

The hotel is very easy for English speakers. It's also attached to a very upscale mall that has dining options. The hotel itself is not walking distance to historic sites and the area immediately around it is busy with e-bikes, but there is a subway station exit/entrance right in the mall attached to the hotel.

msg:Overall a great experience. The only issue was that since it was a summer holiday weekend, the hotel was fully booked and our room wasn't ready when we arrived (which was after the check-in time 3 pm). This felt a bit unusual in a 5-star hotel. However, the issue was handled very well in the end - we received a small courtesy gift and late check-out as compensation, as well as apologies from the front desk manager. The breakfast was also a bit crowded in the weekend, and had to queue for a bit - however can't fault the service here either. The staff did their best to make it as fast and smooth as possible. Would just recommend picking another time to stay at this hotel, and maybe not a weekend during the high season.

Really recommend trying out the spa - amazing experience! Location is also perfect, right above the Taikoo Hui mall. Food was great, service level excellent. However there is no iPad, mobile app or similar system to order room service and make requests, like many similar hotels do. 

What felt a bit strange in the otherwise serene 5-star hotel atmosphere was the number of people taking photos and videos all around the hotel (maybe some kind of social media personalities or models?). Some of them were taking photos for hours in the hallways, changing to a different set of clothes and taking more photos. Sometimes it was a bit inconvenient trying to stay out of their way in the lobby and elevator halls. Not sure if that's a common occurrence here, or only something that happens on summer weekends...

Other than that, really enjoyed our stay - will definitely come back again, but during the low season next time.

msg:For a hotel, being cool is generally the antonym of being classy or Chinese (e.g., Hard Rock Hotel). Meanwhile, being stylish is typically incompatible with being relaxing and comfortable (e.g., YOTEL). The more extreme a hotel goes on one of these aspects, the more intolerable it would be on the opposite aspect. Magically, this general claim does not apply to MO Guangzhou. MO Guangzhou is an extremely cool while classy hotel; it is truly stylish but still overwhelmingly relaxing and comfortable. I would abstain from describing the physical environment of MO Guangzhou further - I am afraid that my words cannot even depict 1% of how exciting and refreshing this piece of architectural art is. Therefore, I would leave the pictures to do the description job. But what I can confidently say is that the design of this MO hotel, from the lobby to the room, is astonishing and inherits the MO tradition to pay great attention to arts and even the most minor details. Perhaps if we imagine the most tranquil garden in the Old Summer Palace (before being burned down) and modernize it a bit, we may be able to imagine how special MO Guangzhou is like.

Beyond its architecture, the people are another huge asset of MO Guangzhou. Just like MO Macau, the ladies and gentlemen at MO Guangzhou are super warm, friendly, and professional - really, which hotel brand can compete with MO in this regard? MO Guangzhou convinces me further that MO hotels are where the best hotel professionals would go to. There are several ladies and gentlemen that I am particularly grateful to. Thank you so much, Natalie! Thanks for your really warm welcoming, guiding me around this beautiful hotel, and introducing each room facility to me (and, of course, telling me where I can buy the fan!). It is my pleasure to meet you. Your beyond-professional hospitality is the best reminder to me that MO is the best hotel brand on earth! Also, thanks, Susanna and Stin! I am really honored to meet you two at the end of the stay, and I truly enjoy the conservation with you two. You two made the check-out no longer dry or standardized. Instead, it is more like a farewell by two old friends when I am about to leave their home. Thanks for inviting me back to MO Guangzhou for my special day, Stin! I would love to, given how amazing you guys are. Additionally, I cannot be more grateful to the entire concierge team. I long heard that MO people uphold the tradition to exhaust whatever means possible to help their guests with whatever they want. You guys prove that this rumor is not an incorrect one! I have never encountered a concierge team that would rush around to help me to check where I can do a body check at midnight! You guys are so committed. Respect!

MO Guangzhou has made me even more addicted to the MO brand!

But! The welcome fruit is actually five tangerines? ? ?
Taikoo Hui is downstairs, which is extremely convenient!
I went downstairs at night to buy various fruits such as Yike berries and honey pomelo.
The gym is also good. In addition to water and coffee, there are also fruits. I decisively finished a Korla pear and made up for it a little bit.

The room is clean and hygienic, needless to say. One point I want to mention is that the room service is good and fast, which is what I want to emphasize, because many hotels will have delayed room service during holidays, but we didn't this time. We ordered several times and the items were delivered very promptly, and the staff were also warm and friendly. Thumbs up. 
The breakfast is semi-self-service, and I think the taste is quite satisfactory. But compared with other breakfasts in hotels of the same price, I think the selection is inferior.

msg:Having stayed at Mandarin Oriental all over the world, I am still a little disappointed with the service at Mandarin Oriental in Guangzhou. I arrived late on the evening of the 16th, and the front desk staff was a young man. His reception was very cold, which surprised me. Later, when I was paying the deposit, it took me three attempts to use Alipay. What he showed was not concern but still indifference or even disdain or impatience. But I didn't say anything because probably no one wanted to work the night shift.
The hardware equipment in the room is still OK, but due to the location, there is no view outside the window. There are few choices for breakfast. The swimming pool also only has a small, slender outdoor pool.
The only point is for the cat nest at the door. Treating stray cats kindly reflects the hotel's humanistic care. But training and standards need to be strengthened to reach the same level as Mandarin Oriental elsewhere in the world.
Overall: 3/5
Will not be returning.

msg:I was torn between Mandarin Oriental and Rosewood for a long time, and finally chose Mandarin Oriental. After checking in, I can only say that the quality of the hotel really depends on the beholder, and the wise have their own opinions! Maybe there are too many excellent hotels now, and everyone is paying attention to service. We just stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Haitang Bay, Sanya, and we were really taken care of by the butler-style service! So the gap is huge! First of all, the service attitude of the front desk staff when checking in was disappointing! There was no introduction to all aspects of the hotel. Instead, they only highlighted to me that the suite I booked could only include meals for two people, and if the children wanted to eat, they would be charged! I said that no matter whether we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Dubai or the Grand Hyatt where we just stayed, we all received executive benefits, and there were no fees for the children. The front desk told them that this was the rule and gave me a package price. Okay, then we will follow the rules! Secondly, the breakfast did not make it clear at all that we can dine on the 4th floor or the 24th floor, and the fees are different. We only found out after asking on the last day of our stay. The room faces the street and is very noisy! If you like quiet, don't choose this hotel! When I checked in, I applied for a higher floor because my mother and I were light sleepers and were afraid of the noise. However, the front desk told me that the highest floor was only on the 12th floor. The sound of the garbage truck was very loud after 12 o'clock in the evening and early in the morning. You will be woken up by the sound of bustling vehicles on the street! One morning during my stay, while I was sleeping, there was the sound of gongs and drums playing outside. Finally, I really don't like the room type. It's like a runway room. You have to walk a long way from one room to another. Traces of old age can still be seen in all aspects of the hotel. For example, the wardrobe door at the entrance will be opened due to the opening and closing of the room door. The smart toilet has no seat heating. The bedroom A button fell off the curtain. The bedroom is not as well protected from light as other hotels. The windows are very large. In the morning, light penetrates through the curtains into the room, and the room is also very bright. Stayed here for four nights, my mother and I both had insomnia for four nights! When I came back, my family asked me if it was a feng shui problem. Poor feng shui would affect my sleep. By the way, I also want to complain about the hotel‚Äôs bowl of white porridge, which costs 112! One day, my mother didn‚Äôt want to go out because she didn‚Äôt have a rest at night, so she ordered a bowl of white porridge in the room. When I saw the price, I really didn‚Äôt expect it, haha! It‚Äôs not that we can‚Äôt afford it, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs really not cost-effective! Well, food in Dubai is not that expensive! The whole hotel gave me the feeling that it was a little stingy! ! For me, apart from being very close to Taikoo Hui, there is nothing else attractive about it. I will not stay here again next time!

Who knew that when I went to the other hotel and compared it with mo, the difference in all aspects was too big, so I switched back to mo. The front desk guy prepared the room in advance after learning about it, which was heartwarming. In addition to the service, the hotel's location is also impeccable, and it is super convenient to eat and shop around, and there are many kinds. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will definitely choose this place first, and I look forward to trying different mo in various places in the futureüòú

As a long-established hotel, I have always felt that MO's service awareness is very good. I am a lazy person and don't particularly like to write reviews, but for this trip, I feel it is necessary to review it. , although the exterior of the hotel is not particularly outstanding, probably because the floor is relatively low, the service attitude is really excellent. Every staff member is very polite and greets you very sincerely. Sincerity from the heart, not that A cold, fake politeness. The young man at the concierge was very enthusiastic and would take the initiative to open the door and pick up the luggage. I would like to give special praise to Tom Wu. Because I drove the taxi too far, he specifically asked the driver where he parked and helped me carry my big suitcase. It was delivered to the car. I have stayed in so many hotels and I feel that the a**osphere of Mandarin is really great. Good reviews! By the way, I finally got up this morning and enjoyed the hotel's breakfast. Breakfast is on the 4th floor. It's semi-self-service. The environment is good. There is a menu and you can order food. The taste is not bad, five stars. level. If I have the chance to stay again next time, I hope I can arrange a room with a better view hahaha

The hotel is old, but the room design style is in line with modern aesthetic standards. The wiring service feedback is very fast, which is very satisfactory. It is recommended that breakfast could be better. Time is tight this time, so I will come back to experience the hotel's spa program later. In addition, I stayed with a puppy during this trip, and I could tell that the hotel was very considerate and friendly to the puppy. During my stay, I warmly sent a cake. The cake looked great and was of very high quality. After the puppy was born, it digested very well. . There are also food and nests for stray cats and dogs downstairs.

The queue for breakfast was very long every day during the three days of my stay.

There is a slide bed with bunk beds in the living room. The bedroom has a sofa. The bedroom is facing the TV. There is a bar on the back. The bedroom is connected to the dressing room with a long Long gaming table.
.
Then there is the bathroom. The bathroom is also divided into two sides. On one side is the washbasin and toilet with separate dry and wet areas. On the opposite side is the shower room with a bathtub. In the middle is the corridor and the road leading to the door. Just go around in a circleüòÇ.

msg:Surprisingly, among the three hotels where I stayed in Guangzhou for six days this time, the Mandarin Oriental was the most cost-effective and the best overall experience.
The scent of Mandarin Oriental's exclusive fragrance lingers as soon as you enter the door. The fragrance of their home fragrance, hand washing soap, shower gel, shampoo, and bath salts are all very comfortable. The decoration is also very stylish, no worse than the Rosewood. It is hard to imagine that this is a hotel that has been open for more than ten years.
1Ô∏è‚É£Room
I booked a superior room. The dressing room has a spacious place for storing luggage. The wet and dry separation is very good. The toilet and bathtub are on both sides. Dyson hair dryer.
2Ô∏è‚É£Gym
The gym is quite large and well-equipped, with shower areas, changing rooms, restrooms, baths, dry steam rooms, and wet steam rooms. I use Dyson for hair drying. When there are staff members in the locker room, they will bring this introduction. The last time I encountered such considerate service was at the InterContinental in Zhengzhou. Fruit, hibiscus tea, lemonade, and a coffee machine are placed right at the entrance of the gym. The details are perfect. The aerobic area faces the naked-eye 3D screen of Renfeng Plaza, although most of the time it is advertising. While exercising and admiring the busy Zhujiang New Town, I felt better. There is a yoga room with yoga bricks, yoga mats, muscle-relaxing maces...
3Ô∏è‚É£Breakfast
Although the variety is not as rich as Rosewood and Ritz-Carlton, it is better because of its fine preparation and the overall taste is quite good. Semi-buffet style breakfast, can you believe that the soups including kway teow, wonton noodles, beef brisket noodles and soups all have different soup bases, and they all taste good. The dandan noodles are average, the sauce is good but the texture of the noodles is not strong enough. My favorite is their French toast. It‚Äôs crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It has a melt-in-your-mouth texture without being too moist. It‚Äôs really amazing. I ate the whole plate two days in a row just for this bite. Stayed again. The meat floss bread in the baking area is the most delicious in the breakfast buffet I have ever had. There is no greasy salad dressing. The strawberry donuts are also delicious. The pastry ones are average and not crispy. I doubt it is the same as the one downstairs. It comes from a bakery of Mandarin Bakery. Fried noodles and fried rice are not delicious. The steamed ones feel like they are all made by themselves, and the taste is different from the frozen products outside. Dry steamed, steamed dumplings and shrimp dumplings are okay. Even if they are steamed, the skin of the shrimp dumplings is still elastic. The buns are average, with no fillings. What‚Äôs very funny is the glutinous rice chicken. My friend said, ‚ÄúAs soon as I taste the unpalatable glutinous rice chicken, I know it‚Äôs not a half-finished product.‚Äù The service was as attentive as ever. When we went there on the first day, we asked if there was cucumber juice. We were told no. We didn‚Äôt have enough ingredients and we couldn‚Äôt freshly squeeze it. We asked if we could have spinach juice. I said yes, and they gave me two cups of freshly squeezed juice. Spinach juice, my friend ordered two glasses of apple juice. This is not the most amazing thing. The most amazing thing is that when we came back the next day, I asked for two cups of spinach juice as soon as I sat down. The waitress said that it was already being squeezed, and then brought us two cups of spinach juice. I need two glasses of apple juice, but my friend didn‚Äôt ask for apple juice that day. It seems that he has remembered it, which is absolutely amazing.
In summary, the decoration is stylish, the breakfast is delicious, the gym is also very good, the service is attentive and thoughtful, there is nothing wrong except that the room has no view, and the location is excellent, next to Taikoo Hui, and less than two kilometers away from Tianhuan Zhengjia Teem City. Compared with Grandview Marriott and Guangdong Sheraton, it is better in every aspect, except for the Croissant, which they both do better. This is a hotel I will stay at again.

üëçAdvantages:
1. Seamlessly connected to Taikoo Hui, it‚Äôs so convenient to order grandma‚Äôs handicraftsüòÇ
2. The room layout is in the form of a suite, and the entry-level shoe-changing stool is super detailed.
3. The vanity mirror and bathtub in the bathroom are both bonus points. Toiletries still need to be improved.
4. The service staff are gentle and very professional after several communications.
5. Pet-friendly. For families with multiple pets, it‚Äôs hard not to add points when you see the grandparents and their dogs moving in, as well as the cat litter and cat food at the door.
‚ùåDisadvantages:
1. Breakfast is what I feel most dissatisfied with this time. I will definitely not choose breakfast next time. Not to mention that the dining environment is small and the semi-buffet format has no options. I don‚Äôt want to eat it the next day. Lou ate. üòÇThe freshly cooked food tastes terribleüò∞This is in Guangzhou, the delicious city, so it‚Äôs better not to make breakfast like this. Strongly recommend rectification.

2. There is a problem with the elevator settings. During the stay, it often happens that many people need to share an elevator, but other elevators are still empty. It is recommended to adjust it. Otherwise, the experience will be very poor.

Personally, I think Mandarin‚Äôs service is slightly lacking. It only takes ten minutes to call the front desk. No one came. Later, I dialed the button for the manager on duty and it was faster. In the gym locker room, there were attendants walking in and out to arrange towels while I was blowing my hair. The experience was not very good, so I didn‚Äôt want to go to the gym the next night. , the sound insulation effect of Mandarin is very poor, but the hotel helped me replace it in time. The ordinary tone of the people next door can basically be heard clearly in the toilet. But basically, if there is a need, the hotel will try its best to satisfy it, and various facilities are relatively complete. Especially the hair dryer is equipped with curling accessories, which is very convenient. The shoe-changing stool, entrance tray, and tea set at the bar when you enter all reflect a sense of sophistication. Taking a bath in the bathtub is great. The alkaline cakes you can buy at the Mandarin Cake Shop downstairs are very crispy and fragrant. I recommend them!

1. Before traveling, we informed that we had a baby, and the hotel had prepared bed surrounds, bottle warmers, disinfection machines, and bathtubs in advance.
2. We thoughtfully arranged for our elders to be on the same floor as us and upgrade their room type.
3. The bed is very comfortable, not too soft (Conrad is soft for lower back pain), and the baby actually slept for 16 hours a day. The dry and wet areas are separated by sliding doors. The sound insulation is very good. When the door is closed, the sound of washing and going to the toilet cannot be heard in the bedroom (this is very friendly to parents who put their babies to bed).
4. The bathtub is also quite big, and the baby enjoys swimming in it.
5. The service is cordial and courteous. They will greet each other in a friendly manner, and any casual requests will be remembered. The macarons and chocolates given are super delicious!
6. The swimming pool is open from 6 to 10 o'clock, with a constant temperature of 28 degrees. Although it is outdoors, the room looks very good, but I regret that I don't have time to swim.
7. The various designs of the room are quite interesting, and the beautiful details of the space are amplified through mirrors. The disadvantage is that the control of the lights cannot be separated. It is a little troublesome to turn off and on the lights in the whole house with one click.

Help, Catherine, Stin, Allison, Dennis and Oliver were all very helpful in coordinating and decorating the room. On the day we checked in, the room was beautifully decorated, and the drinks were placed on an ice bucket to help us chill them. I was really shocked. From check-in to check-out, there was always someone who recognized us and wished us a happy anniversary. It was really like going home and full of joy. Mandarin Oriental is indeed the ceiling of Guangzhou's service. I will choose to come back next time.

msg:It‚Äôs hard to comment. First of all, the experience at Jiang Restaurant was very, very bad: 1. It took a long time from arriving to serving the dishes. I sat down at 7 o‚Äôclock, had the appetizers at almost 8 o‚Äôclock, and had the main dishes until 8:30. The foie gras dish was really good. It tasted so bad that I was shocked. It was so tight that I felt like vomiting after just one piece. The abalone rice was also unpalatable. I was in a bad mood and asked someone to pay. I had to ask for payment twice before someone came. The waiter even poured hot tea water into my hand. Now, does it really deserve the reputation of a good restaurant? It‚Äôs not as good as Chef Hui‚Äôs other one-star restaurant; 2. Secondly, the lobby is very small and is sandwiched in the corner of Taikoo Hui. There is no decent front hall and almost all are narrow corridors and mirrors. It‚Äôs hard to go downstairs and wait for the bus to arrive. I don't know where to sit, there are a few single chairs scattered at the end of each corridor. I also bought chocolates in your dessert shop and consumed them in the main restaurant. When there is no room to sit in the lobby, you can‚Äôt sit at the empty table in the dessert shop! When my fellow travelers came to Guangzhou, the first thing I thought of was Wenhua. I had seen it on other platforms before and thought that the a**osphere might be warm and the decoration might be unique. This experience was really off-putting! Affects your mood throughout the day and night! If you listen to your travel companions, it might be better to stay at Rosewood.

msg:The management of a dignified five-star hotel is so chaotic. Before checking out, I discovered that three coats were missing and asked the front desk to check if I had any coats when I entered the hotel. Otherwise, I had lost them at the airport. The hotel checked the surveillance system and told me that there were no coats. When I arrived at the airport, the airport police checked the surveillance for me and said that I had been holding my clothes in my hand when I got into the car. After I got in a friend's car and went straight to the hotel, the clothes must have been left at the hotel. I called the hotel again and asked the hotel to help check. Later, the hotel replied that the clothes were left on a stool in the lobby when I checked in three days ago and they had put them away. The clothes were missing for three days and they didn't take the initiative to find the owner. They didn't tell us that we found the clothes missing and asked them. They actually said they didn't have the clothes. In order to catch the flight, the two children risked catching a cold and returned to a city that was ten degrees cooler than Guangzhou without jackets. It's really outrageous that this kind of thing happened in a five-star hotel, and the lost and found area is useless. I would choose to stay at the Mandarin Oriental every time I came to Guangzhou before, but the experience this time was really bad, including the fact that there was no water glass during breakfast. The waiter asked me to wait but never brought it to me. The table was dirty and no one came to wipe it. Really disappointed.

My friend and I were embarrassed and a little angry! Totally offended!
What is the reason that allows him to speak like this to the customers staying in the hotel? !
Is the concierge amazing? The customer stands at the door for a few seconds to take a photo and is then driven away? You can't talk properly anymore, can you?

Is it helpful for the front office manager to apologize? The person involved didn‚Äôt even say sorry!

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied with it. Whether it is the decoration or the interior of the hotel, it is the most distinctive one I have ever visited. The transition from wooden floors to stone tiles gives people the feeling of walking into a courtyard and into a home. The flower arrangement is also the best. They change according to the seasons. The only drawback is that the control buttons in the guest room are too scattered and need to be searched for by customers, and they are not very sensitive. When I woke up in the morning and wanted to take a shower, I found that the window screen could not be lowered. I had to go to the door and click the main switch twice. I don‚Äôt know. Is it a problem with our room (2016)? The overall service environment is very good. The only two things I can say are that I came back from outside in the middle of the night and saw no one downstairs. I thought the lobby was closed and I had to find another one. At the entrance, I also asked for water to be delivered to the guest room. It was inconvenient at that time, so I called the front desk and told the front desk that it was placed in the locker without knocking. However, the staff who came still knocked on the door. When I opened the door, I found that it was an older man. Staff, maybe he doesn‚Äôt know how to use the locker. The design of the locker is good, but it‚Äôs a bit wasteful if you don‚Äôt know how to use it. The hotel is good ü•π They also upgraded the room type. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The stray cats are also very cute. I hope this small shortcoming can be corrected next time I stay.

msg:Changes experienced during this stay at Mandarin Oriental:

Overall evaluation: Service, environment, supplies, catering, and transportation still meet the five-star standard. However, the reduction in revenue and expenditure is very obvious, mainly reflected in the quality of personnel services and supplies. I don‚Äôt know when the early quality of MO Guangzhou‚Äôs opening will be restored.

Major changes:
Spa dining coupons are no longer calculated based on the daily quota of 300/350/500, but are only calculated once for the entire stay, which has a greater impact on long-term guests. This calculation method is the same for Ctrip and official website bookings. It is not mentioned on the booking page, but is informed by the front desk when checking in. The change was never mentioned or notified in advance.
The Executive Lounge is temporarily closed due to renovations and the resumption time is unknown. (replacement of front desk caliber, elevator sign tearing, and functional area)
The rest area on the first floor is available for rent. The bakery was re-located and a cigar shop was added.

Supplies changes:
The quality of slippers has declined and is equivalent to that of a quasi-five-star or four-star business chain hotel. Figure 1
Shower gel and other bathing products are no longer provided in disposable packages and need to be shared with the previous guest in discounted packages. Disposable packaging will no longer be provided for guests to take away. If you take away the discounted packaging, you will be charged. Figure II
The common wireless network in the room frequently has signal but no connection, which can only be solved by reconnecting to the wireless network, and each time you need to reconnect to the wireless network with your last name and room number.
The variety of bulk chocolate in the bakery has been reduced.
The types of wine in the in-room bar have been changed, and Mandarin's own special blends have been added. Figure 3 and Figure 4
The quality of breakfast ingredients has been reduced across the board (coffee has been replaced with Yunnan beans, sausages have been replaced with starch sausage, yogurt and butter varieties have been replaced by homemade ones, etc.)

Lobby and depar**ent services:
Some children ignore greetings when they meet face to face, and need the guests to raise their hands to say hello before they respond. This is not the first time this has happened. This defect has appeared in scenes such as opening the door and encountering each other in the corridor on the guest room floor.
The waiter at the flower shop on the first floor was not paying enough attention. The customer walked behind and found him looking at his mobile phone. To avoid embarrassment, I walked away for a few steps before speaking. The waiter was caught off guard.
Because chocolate products no longer provide product descriptions, bakery staff may not be able to fully remember the ingredients contained in chocolate, and they may feel unfamiliar when asking about allergic ingredients.
When dining at Jiang Restaurant, there are no tables laid out before the meal. It was found that the attention of the waiters was still insufficient, and sometimes they failed to proactively serve the details of dining services and customers' sudden detailed needs, and had to call before they could come to provide services. The management can still maintain high-quality service, which is good.
When checking out, an error occurred in the calculation of pending charges.

Room service:
In the following situation, after the guest's written reminder, the hotel immediately took the initiative to provide various services that the guest noticed at the time and did not pay attention to. Fortunately, a similar situation did not happen again.
A large number of services are missing: data cables and charging cables are no longer bundled and sorted; drinking water is not replenished every day; guests only see the welcome letter on the second day after check-in; when checking in, it was discovered that the welcome fruit platter was not provided and the variety of fruit platters was reduced. . Figure 5
The bedside socket part has no power.
When there were guests, the turndown service attendant did not proactively mention doing the turndown service when entering the room; when there were guests, the waiter only performed basic cleaning and left without performing the turndown service. When I returned to the room on the second night of my stay, I found that there was no turndown service at all. I confirmed that the hotel did not provide a full turndown service. Figure 6

Given that Mandarin Oriental‚Äôs work in collecting customer feedback and return visits has always been excellent and has not deteriorated, I believe MO members can see this message. I am still willing to give a five-star review, and I am not willing to lower the proportion of my willingness to stay, but I look forward to the hotel returning to its original service quality as soon as possible. Thank you.

Although it has a history of ten years, the facilities are not too old. The room is very clean, the mini bar is complete, two large bottles of Andes water are free to drink, with Oulon body care, and the aluminum tube body lotion is very high-quality, but the only feeling is that the room The lights are relatively dim and not very bright when fully turned on.

Before going to bed, I tried a glass of Horizon in The Loft Bar on the second floor. I drank the best cocktail I have ever tasted. The Chinese style is like drinking tea, with a small piece of the hotel‚Äôs homemade hawthorn cake (the word homemade is very popular with me. A hotel that really appreciates the small details and attentiveness)

Then I got a semi-buffet lunch in the middle of the night (I called to make a last-minute reservation, thank you to the concierge who answered the phone for helping me make an appoin**ent for lunch at 2 a.m.). The price was less than 300, and there were several cakes of the same style in Wenhua Cake Shop that cost 400+. There are also oversized scallops, prawns, mussels, and snails. The main dish was sea bass, which was juicy and tasted very good.

After dinner, I made an impromptu trip to experience the spa opposite the Western restaurant. I knew that MO Spa was very famous. I used the 300 points in the Ctrip package to deduct 500 yuan to get an essential oil spa for half the body, shoulders, neck and head. The technician's technique and strength All very satisfied.

The hotel design incorporates oriental aesthetics, from the green plants and vases in the room to the fan in the hotel lobby. The scent of the hotel is very good. It is the first time to become a member. I also gave a gift and the service was very thoughtful. I was on a business trip and booked for two nights. The check-in experience was very good. The customer's demands would be satisfied. The receptionist at the front desk concierge was very nice. The experience of check-in details is not important. I will continue to support Mandarin Oriental hotels in other cities.

msg:I love the MO brand from the very beginning üòç This time when I came to Guangzhou to find a girlfriend, I chose MO in Guangzhou. It was a super satisfying stay experience! Like it üëç
Facilities: New Chinese-style rooms, but it doesn‚Äôt make people feel very old. I really like the color of the wood. Although the hotel has been open for 10 years, it is well maintained. Mr. Ji Yutang‚Äôs design of the hotel is also worth tormenting! ÔøºIt is particularly worth mentioning the large bathtub in the room! super big! It's really comfortable to take a bath in it! The hotel also thoughtfully prepared bath salts! Toiletries are also Oulong's "Pomelo Love" style! Very fragrant grapefruit taste! In the big cabinet at the entrance to the roomüóÑÔ∏è, there are two pairs of slippers, one big and one small, for men and women, very considerateü•∞ There are also free coffee capsules and tea bags, which can meet everyone's different needs. The drinking water in the room also uses spring water from the Andes Mountains, which is known as the top ten springs in the world. The glass bottle reflects the hotel's sustainable development concept. Toiletries, etc. are all made of wood, which can be recycled ‚ôªÔ∏è There is no trash can Garbage bags, MO has really worked hard on sustainable development. The shower and toilet are separated and do not affect each other. The room is very spacious, and the washstand is also very spacious. I especially like this kind of washstand, which is super convenient for placing toiletry bags and cosmetic bags, etc.! There are mirrors everywhere! It is very suitable for girlfriends to take pictures!
Environment: The location is superb. Downstairs is TaiKoo Hui, a shopping mall full of luxury goods. It is very convenient to go shopping and eat. The hotel can also be directly connected to TaiKoo Hui. There is Metro Line 3 on the B2 floor, so it is very convenient to go out and play! The room has large floor-to-ceiling windows with a very wide view! Although the hotel doesn't have any scenery, the hotel's focus is to find a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle, creating a sense of tranquility between the noisy TaiKoo Hui and Wenheyou, which is very comfortable.
Hygiene: There are aunts cleaning the lobby at any time üßπ very clean. There are no hygienic corners in the room, and the bathtub is spotless. The hotel responds to the concept of sustainable development. Generally, the bedding is changed every other day, but there is also a leaf card next to the bed that needs to be changed. Put the card on the bed and the room aunt will come to replace it for you, which is very convenient. The details are in place!
Service: MO's service is impeccable! In the remarks, I wrote that I came to Guangzhou for the first time, and I also came to find a girlfriend, so the hotel arranged the rooms! A welcome card is also prepared! Really sweet! Haniel at the front desk was so patient! The people are also handsome üëÄ stay in a good mood! Also Nikki Betty Chelsea Joy Stin Allison for great reception! Meet all kinds of personalized services! Very considerate ‚ù§Ô∏èOliver also asked very carefully when checking out and storing luggage! The service of the concierge buddies is also super nice! The service of MO makes up for the fact that the hotel has no scenery! Really love the service of live MO! The welcome fruit peach in the room is also very sweet, I love to eat itüçΩÔ∏èThe cat litter for stray cats at the entrance of the hotel is also very considerate, which shows that MO is a pet-friendly hotel and is very inclusive! When checking out, guests will also be asked about their sleep quality, room facilities, and issues that need improvement. The service is really top-notch.

The entire hotel has perfect facilities and equipment, including a gym, swimming pool, spa, etc. This time, the time is too short to experience them all. It also leaves a lot of suspense for the next stay. I hope to experience the five-star spa next time. And a restaurant with two Michelin stars! The hotel also provides various activities and services such as weddings, banquets, laundry services, etc. to meet the various needs of guests! The details are really well done, it makes me feel like I'm at home! Feel respected! Anyway! I highly recommend everyone to come to Guangzhou to stay at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Guangzhou! The quality and service are top-notch, and I will choose MO next time!

Location: Next to TaiKoo Hui, there is still a passageway to the hotel, I was shocked by the shiny Dior when passing by, and there is a Rolex at the exit on the other side, which is very high-end and a**ospheric. There are many shopping malls nearby, and there are many delicious things on Tianhe South Road not far away. Although it is a bit far from the Pearl River, it is very tiring to shop here for a whole day!
Facilities: Introduced by the ladies at the front desk Mona and Stin, Guangzhou Wenhua has been in its tenth year this year. The design is timeless, traditional and elegant, and has a unique charm. I couldn‚Äôt help but take a few more photos in the room.
Service: Wenhua's service is really good. Nikki, Joy, Chelsea, and Betty from the guest relations depar**ent are super enthusiastic and patiently answer our questions. They store our luggage for us when we check out. Feel free to go out and play. I am also very grateful to the aunts who helped us turn down the bed. The folded quilt corners and the laid floor towels all feel the care of this hotel.
This time, as a new fan fan, I come to experience Guangzhou Wenhua, and I plan to live in other Wenhua next time, to feel their respective charms!

msg:The Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Guangzhou, designed by the international design master Mr. Ji Yutang, is well-known in the industry. The modern and simple design combined with oriental charm gives people an aesthetic sense. It has been 10 years since the hotel was completed, but the facilities in the rooms are all high-end configurations: Simmons mattress, founded in the United States in 1870, is one of the top ten famous brands in the world, and the intelligent toilet (TOTO) is a high-end product born in Japan in 1917 Products, French Atelier Cologne series of bath products exude a light refreshing fragrance after use, and the British Dyson hair dryer, which has won the "Red Dot Design Award", has a noiseless negative ion hair care and hair dryer that gives people a sense of comfort. Washbasins, faucets and other bathroom appliances are the top century-old British brand Lefroy Brooks, whose products are famous for their fashion, high quality and retro style. The smart control switch in the room, the warm lighting, the paintings on the wall, especially appreciate the elegant art flower arrangements placed everywhere. The accommodation environment is pleasing to the eye and the heart.
      The first Michelin two-star restaurant "Jiang" in Guangzhou is located on the third floor of the hotel. (Guangzhou has not had a Michelin three-star restaurant so far). Huang Jinghui, who has won the Chinese celebrity chef five-star medal and was selected as the world's 100 "best chefs" in 2022 The chef cooks, he makes Cantonese cuisine exquisitely, and only after tasting can he feel the delicacy and delicacy. It is very necessary to experience all kinds of delicacies.
      Staying at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel this time, I feel the humanized service of a luxury hotel. Front desk staff Jack Ho kindly checked us in and answered our questions with a smile. Betty Chen enthusiastically and patiently introduced the hotel's layout and room facilities. Due to some doubts about the cleanliness of the room, Will, the duty manager of the front office depar**ent, explained the doubts and misunderstandings, and let us know more about the hotel. The high-quality service highlights the image of a high-end hotel.
      Mandarin Oriental, Guangzhou has repeatedly won the five-star rating from Forbes Travel Guide, the only luxury hotel in the world. This stay left a very good impression, a feeling of being at home. This is a luxury hotel with taste, connotation and cultural heritage.

Everyone was very hospitable and even gave me a few extra bottles of water during the turndown service. The location is also super convenient, just beside Taikoo Hui, you can eat whatever you want at night.
Because it was my first time staying in MO in Guangzhou, the lady at the front desk gave me a fridge magnet, so cute and happy.

This hotel in Guangzhou can be seen from the property management of Swire Group in terms of its geographical location and hardware and soft decoration. Very attentive, the basic room area is very comfortable, the layout is also very reasonable, the hotel staff is also very enthusiastic, whether it is the concierge brother or the front desk lady, I feel very enthusiastic!

Fortunately, the staff had an excellent service attitude and immediately upgraded my room and gave me a dessert. Thank you Courtney, she has a very nice personality, is talkative and professional

The takeaway can't be delivered upstairs, so I have to go downstairs to pick it up, but the place where the takeaway is stored is quite rudimentary, I hope I can see the correction when I go again

The furniture in the room can be seen that the materials are exquisite, the design is winding and secluded, and a lot of mirrors are used to achieve a more transparent and bright effect. The two sinks of the sink have different shapes. I was very surprised. I stayed in three hotels during my stay in Guangzhou. Mandarin Oriental It is the only one with a restrained temperament. You need to calm down and sit in the room to taste it silently.

The breakfast is a semi-buffet style, which is relatively rich. The distance between the tables is relatively narrow, which makes the restaurant a little bustling in comparison. The outdoor environment is good, and there is a feeling of having breakfast in an oasis in a noisy city. Order The single French toast tastes good, you can try it

It is very worth mentioning that there is a custom-made cat nest at the entrance of the hotel, which is embroidered with resident cats. I was lucky enough to see cats appearing during my stay. The hotel staff, from the cleaning lady to the doorman, all love cats and cats. Human touch can go further

msg:I specially booked a guest room at the Oriental Club, wanting to experience the private environment and services of Mandarin Oriental, but the lounge was actually borrowed by Montblanc for Feng Tang‚Äôs solo exhibition...
Then the lounge moved to a small room with no windows on the second floor
Afternoon tea and happy hour have been moved to a corner of the restaurant on the 4th floor, and breakfast is only available in the restaurant on the 4th floor. There is still a long queue, and I don‚Äôt feel the "administrative courtesy" at all.
Tell the waiter, there is no apology at all, and tell me that there is a queue every Sunday... Get rid of it, people could have breakfast in the lounge, okay?

The original location of the lounge is still very good, but it takes up the best view on the first floor
Throughout the whole process, except for the lady in the executive lounge who has a very good service attitude, the others have no sense of service at all...

The hotel is being renovated everywhere, and the lobby bar is gone
The swimming pool is also closed due to activities
For the dressing room and steam room, the paper on the room says that the decoration was completed on March 20th, and the one downstairs says on April 10th

In the middle, because Taikoo Hui was too noisy for an event, I changed the room. It turned out that there was less beer in the minibar, and there was less food in the snack area. No one checked after cleaning? At this level, it is not impossible to say that it is impossible to change one customer for one.


Another slot is the hotel's parking
The hotel's parking lot is not allowed to park...excuse me...the attitude is still very bad
The doorman guided us to stop at Taikoo Hui, plus detours and queuing, it took us half an hour
The funniest thing is that the hotel does not provide parking tickets for TaiKoo Hui for other guests I met in the lobby...excuse me? ? No parking for free, and let the guests pay to park in the mall parking lot?
Fortunately, the room I booked included the parking fee (question mark face), but I was questioned for a long time when I registered at the front desk, as if I was here to cheat the parking ticket (again question mark face)

The room is still very big, and the various facilities are well maintained, but the level of service and management is really hard to describe. Am I expecting too much? ?

msg:I took my family with me to travel to Guangzhou, and I chose the Mandarin Oriental Hotel after thousands of choices. Sure enough, I was not disappointed. I was worried that the hotel facilities would be very old and not well maintained after opening for so long. The hotel has a sense of design, with modern and oriental classic charm. Understated luxury. On the first day, I stayed in the executive room of the Oriental Club. Check-in is on the 24th floor, and there are free refreshments for rest. The girl with glasses who checked in was very good with a smile on her face. Although the process is a bit slow, due to the high occupancy rate, we need three rooms together, so it is a bit troublesome, and it takes a little time to understand. The afternoon tea is exquisite and delicious. There is also happyhour in the evening, but I didn't enjoy it because I went out to play. The next day's breakfast in the executive room can be enjoyed on the 24th floor, with few people and quiet. I met a girl wearing glasses again, and the service was still very good. The praise has her part. After a few days, I went downstairs to have breakfast. There are many people on weekends and I have to queue up, but hot food can still be ordered. The meals are not too many, but they are not bad, and hot food can also be ordered a la carte. But the environment is still different from the 24th floor. Recommend Dick's Egg and Beef Brisket Noodles, they are delicious. The room is cleaned very clean every day. It's been a long time since I met a five-star hotel that keeps turning down the bed. Like it! The bathtub is large and the bath is very comfortable! The hotel is also very convenient to travel. Below is Taikoo Hui, the best place to buy luxury goods. There are also many places to eat around. Opposite is Guangzhou Wenheyou and Bingsheng. It is recommended to wait for me to deliver seafood stalls to your door. It's also convenient to travel. If it's nearby, you can choose to take the subway downstairs, because it's too congested to take a taxi. But avoid the morning and evening peak hours, otherwise there will be a lot of people on the subway. I am very satisfied with the hotel overall. The only thing I can complain about is that I met a tall and thin man wearing glasses at the front desk on the 24th floor. Also, the lobby of the hotel is not grand enough, and there is no large sofa for many people to rest for a while, which may be the reason why it was built earlier, which can be made up for in other ways. In addition, due to the weather, it is impossible to enjoy the outdoor swimming pool. It would be better if there is an indoor one. In the end, I still want to say that I am convinced by Mandarin's service, and I will choose Mandarin Oriental Hotel again when I go to Guangzhou in the future.

I asked if there was breakfast at 10 o'clock the next day, but I was told that I had to ask. I asked but there was no reply. I had to call a second time to get a reply. Then, I gave 6 as a gift when I checked out. About three macarons were still damaged. To be honest, compared with Four Seasons in Guangzhou, there is still a certain distance. Very bad feeling after staying in so many hotels.

The service of the staff was also very good, and they could do anything I needed Satisfied in time, although there are not many types of breakfast, but there are basic ones, the taste is okay, and the room is well cleaned. I stayed for three nights and felt very good!

3. I booked a parent-child room type that children like. The slide-style bunk beds are suitable for two people. I heard that the suite is bigger and has more fun gadgets. If you have the opportunity, you have to experience it.
The swimming pool is outdoor, small, and the water is cool during the Spring Festival.
Overall, it was a good stay experience, friendly to family and business stays.

msg:The impression of Mandarin Oriental Hotel has always been good. After all, it is an old-fashioned luxury hotel with online reputation and standards. Therefore, Mandarin Oriental was the first choice for Guangzhou staycation this time, but the result was very disappointing.

Location
The location of the hotel is on the upper floor of Taikoo Hui. The transportation and shopping are very convenient. The entrance of the hotel and the shopping mall is a bit hidden, and there is no staff to guide the reception at the entrance, so the experience is discounted.

Serve
Checkin is fast and efficient. The front desk will briefly introduce the room type and room service, but the service staff is generally not very enthusiastic. They will not take the initiative to help with luggage or press the elevator, and there is no welcoming service staff.
breakfast
There are not many types, Chinese and Western styles each account for half, some hot dishes need to be ordered separately first, the taste and service are not bad

room facilities
The decoration is a bit older than the newly opened hotel. The bed is still very comfortable to sleep on, the bathtub is big enough, and the toiletries are Oulong's grapefruit series. Make complaints about 1. The TV in the guest room is a second-hand TV that I don‚Äôt know where it was recycled.

other details
1. The welcome fruit in the room is three dried oranges. To be honest, I think the quality is far from the guarantee fruit sold on some community group buying platforms. It is an international luxury hotel that focuses on "luxury" quality and service. To provide this level of fruit, how can this bring a good experience to users.
2. It is understandable that the mini bar charge is higher than outside, but it is a bit too much to charge 48+15% for a can of Coke. I have never seen such an outrageous charge in other luxury hotels.

In addition, to complain, due to the impact of the epidemic, swimming pools and other equipment have been closed, and the experience has been greatly reduced, but the hotel has no intention of compensating consumers.

msg:The beautiful National Day starts from the staycation at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. When checking in, I gave the hotel's own aromatherapy, which increased my goodwill.
       Mandarin Oriental is the first hotel that can capture me just by the room design. Many people feel that MO does not occupy the beautiful scenery on both sides of the Canton Tower and the Pearl River, but for me, it does not even need a beautiful scenery, it is enough by itself. Excellent, even if it is not beside the Canton Tower, it will not shake its excellence. The design of the guest room is extremely elegant and luxurious, and it is completely beautiful. Large pieces are produced in minutes, and the space of the room is used very reasonably. I deeply feel that the use of logs for the design of the guest room is so beautiful.
Some people say that you like Mandarin Oriental as much as you like the details. There are too many details that impress me. For example, the appearance of the Guangzhou travel album surprised me. For example, after I finished my breakfast, I found that the hotel tidied up the room for me without touching my things, obviously I was going to check out at that time, etc., and so on, every detail was so touching and so fitting. My heart is like a bosom friend waiting for me to come.
       The journey was hard, and I was so tired that I didn't want to come out after entering the room, but when I saw the SPA, I was instantly moved. The Selina technology in the spa is extremely excellent. I felt obvious results in just 10 minutes. The shoulders, neck and back of the heavy backpack were relieved a lot. After experiencing the SPA of Mandarin Oriental, I found that the excellent spa is really not very good. The same, the effect is very obvious, will make people fall in love with the SPA, essential oils, lighting, music are perfect, also equipped with a fascia gun, well-equipped. Thank you very much Mabel from the spa, I brought my little penguin to the spa, she praised my penguin for being cute, I am very happy, her service is very comfortable, and we had a good chat, as a first-time guest to MO, I feel that the service of the hotel may be the kind of service that makes me feel at home and treat others like myself when I need it, and makes me think about life quietly when I don't need it. , maybe only came a few times, but I can feel the feeling of coming home because of the familiarity with the hotel and the hotel staff, but when our chat resonated, I felt that the trip to MO alone was sublimated, The warmth that flows between people is very precious, and I am gradually understanding why Mandarin Oriental is unique among many hotels.
       Even though MO has been in Guangzhou for almost ten years, its facilities are excellent, even with smart devices to adjust the lights and curtains in the room. Even in the room alone, I feel very comfortable and fulfilling.
The variety of breakfast is very rich, among which the beef brisket noodles amazes me very much. The noodles used are Zhusheng noodles, which is the No.1 in my heart among Guangzhou noodles. It is thin and elastic, with a very unique taste, and the soup is very mellow. , Very satisfied, I feel like I don't need to eat lunch.
       The lady at the front desk, Shin (please forgive me for spelling mistakes) patiently answered my questions when I checked out, thank you very much.
       Mandarin Oriental, Guangzhou has now become the No.1 hotel in Guangzhou in my heart. It is a place where I have been reluctant to leave soon after I left. I want to go there countless times and go home countless times. Thank you very much MO, thank you for the good fate, and look forward to it. See you next time! May Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou get better and better!

The "Jungle Adventure" parent-child themed room is full of cute animals. All the room cards I got have been made into panda versionüòç

It is said that this is the new animal cartoon image MiniMO the Panda and its animal friends launched by Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.

There are a total of two types of rooms, deluxe rooms and premium suites. When you enter the house, you can find full details, from the tree hole seat at the door, to the goose-child version of panda slippers, nightgown, and even the flowers are in the shape of pandas. The walls are also full of small animals playing in the "forest": lions, monkeys...

In addition to the double bed in the children's area, there are also MiniMO the Panda dolls, which are very addicting. Mushroom dolls, flying chess in the jungle, fairy tale book, bear's palm chair, lion sofa... Even the small backpack when going out is prepared with the version of panda MOMO and his good friends, every adult's inner childhood can not help but got excited.

When night comes, you can sleep warmly in the arms of panda MOMO. The elegant Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental Hotel also evokes the innocence of children in this autumn.

üîçMandarin Oriental, Guangzhou
"Jungle Adventure" Parent-Child Theme Room

‚Äî
The newly launched "Jungle Adventure" parent-child themed room at Mandarin Oriental, Guangzhou, we can't wait to book a room and experience it as soon as it is launched! I call it the "ceiling of the baby-swinging class" in situ!

‚Äî
"Jungle Adventure Parent-child Room" is a parent-child room truly tailored for children, creating a magical forest for children full of imagination. A lot of thoughtful ideas have been designed for efficient family parent-child time.

For example, MO has also designed original IPs for this parent-child room (such as red pandas, lions, turtles, monkeys, etc.), as if living in a forest!

‚Äî
And for mini FANS, what makes them most respected
It's also about some small details that are considered for children

‚òëÔ∏èChildren's exclusive room card, which can be worn on young guests
Above is MO original cartoon little lion/monkey pattern

‚òëÔ∏èChildren's exclusive welcome benefits
As soon as the children entered the room, they were gifted by the room
The paints and brushes are attractive, edible paints made by the hotel for the little guests, and it is safe and harmless even if you get your hands on it

‚òëÔ∏èChildren's bathrobes and slippers
It's the MOMO panda bathrobe, put it on, the little guests seem to be
Like the red panda, it is mini and cute, and it is the most suitable for swimming. The most intimate thing is that the small slippers have different sizes, suitable for children of different ages to choose and use (the most mini slippers I have seen).

‚òëÔ∏èChildren's exclusive shampoo and body wash
It also used the image of the red panda vividly,
There are MOMO pandas on the packaging of children's dental kits!

msg:The biggest feature of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel is that there are many mirrors, and the elements between black and white *****es, in addition to making you feel that the sense of space is greatly increased, it will also make you a little dizzy. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good, and the maintenance of the facilities is also good. The hotel's catering is second to none with desserts. I wanted to buy a box of chocolates to try, but unfortunately forgot. The swimming pool is a bit small, but the water quality is not bad. In the event of a typhoon, the surrounding nucleic acid points were cancelled. The overall stay experience is still very good. The only regret is that the waiting time for check-in is a bit long. "Warmth is in Wenhua", I don't have a deep experience.
Traffic: belongs to relatively congested area

Hygiene: clean and tidy

Environment: high and cold, with a sense of distance, modern and sustainable elements, such as bamboo toothbrush, chewing toothpaste, etc.

Service: Friendly and caring, but not overly enthusiastic.

From the time of check-in (Joy at the front desk for check-in), I could feel that every staff member (such as the concierge and catering staff) really came from the heart Serve me attentively for my stay! The food in the hotel's restaurant is also quite delicious! What impressed me the most was Ella Lu, the room service staff on the 24th floor during my stay, I was very impressed! I will help me put away the small things scattered on the table. Seeing that there is no place to hang my laundry, she took the initiative to bring me a foldable clothes drying rack for me to dry, and put it by the window with sunlight, The fruit in the room, she found out that I don't eat peaches, and asked me carefully what kind of fruit I like to eat, and replaced other fruits accordingly. Through these few things, I really felt that I was taken care of outside! There is another room service staff, apple, who found that I drink a lot of water and prepared a few more bottles of water for me. Although it is a small matter, it reflects that the overall service quality of the hotel is really high. It has been in business for more than 10 years, but it is very well maintained and the rooms are not stained on the first floor. The stay experience this time is very good, thank you for the warm service of the staff, and will choose to stay in Guangzhou in the future!

msg:The room was temporarily booked, but the check-in was very fast, and a box of macarons was sent behind. Not long ago, I celebrated my birthday on the ***** calendar at another hotel of the same level in the same city. Despite the epidemic, some family members came from other places, but the experience during the stay was very unpleasant, leaving very bad memories (it was still during the birthday), although the hardware was very good. Good but bad service, regret choosing that hotel due to personal preference. Wenhua is obviously very professional and caring here.

The room space is not small, there are many mirrors, the lighting atmosphere is good, the curtains have a significant light blocking effect, and the sound insulation in the room is good. Came here a few years ago for family and friends. Now the overall change is not big, the decoration style is still not exaggerated and outdated, and some items are quite new. Use the usual paste toothpaste and toothpaste two kinds. I am not used to using toothpaste granules, like brushing my teeth while eating candy. It feels strange, and the amount is not enough. I need to chew more than one piece at a time, but I heard that it is more environmentally friendly, so I will use it.

The cleaning aunt is kind and considerate. Although I drank a lot of water and tea, my aunt replenished it every time I cleaned or turned the bed down, bookmarked the book by my bed, and put wipes on my tablet. I want to keep a signature pen, and I will be satisfied immediately. In the evening, I couldn't find a place to do nucleic acid. A tall and burly little brother at the entrance of the lobby helped guide the way and informed the deadline. When he left the hotel later, he also helped to carry the luggage while waiting for a ride. The front desk staff who helped with the renewal of the original room and the late check-out were very friendly and dealt with it quickly. When I checked out, there was a lot of luggage that needed to be stored. The lady named chelsea also helped to refrigerate a cake after she was busy.

I didn't eat breakfast because I slept very late every day, but the impression was well received by the people around. I ate a semi-buffet lunch, maybe I went late, and I felt that there were not many kinds of meat, especially not many kinds of meat, and carnivores were not very happy. There are many desserts, and there are many flavors of ice cream. Some of the waiters and sisters are smiling and the service is cordial and in place.

I mainly eat, drink, and go shopping nearby. If you need something small, you can go directly to the nearby convenience store to buy it. The supermarket on the negative second floor of Taikoo Hui downstairs is also easy to browse, and the negative two is also directly connected to the subway. If you don't have a car, it is much more convenient to go straight down.

After checking out, Miss Joy, the guest relations lady, kindly invited me back, chatted a lot about the anecdotes of the trip, and introduced the MO membership system to us very carefully and gave us a MO pen full of memories.

Because the epidemic situation in the summer vacation has been repeated, I contacted the hotel after I made the itinerary and wanted to know some epidemic prevention policies. I contacted several hotels in this Guangdong trip. Wenhua is the one who knows the epidemic policy and has the best attitude. Before departure It reassured us a lot. One day in advance, the staff contacted to confirm the arrival time and room preference requirements. After arriving, we prepared bath supplies for the child, which smelled very good and the child liked it very much.
Although the hotel is not new, the room facilities are very good and the layout is very warm. The location is even better. It is connected to Taikoo Hui and has convenient transportation. There are many choices for eating and shopping. There is a particularly delicious cake, and I found the ice cream I had eaten in Italy. It is a good choice for traveling with children. Because the hotel was well chosen, I just left and the child is already looking forward to coming back to Guangzhou next time.

The hotel has been open for some years, and the hardware maintenance is acceptable. Although I dare not say that the hardware is the best in Mandarin Oriental, the service and design of the hotel are also among the best in M.O. in the mainland. The breakfast of the hotel is on the 4th floor. There are a few types of buffets, but the ordering speed is very fast, and the quality of the products is very high. The beef brisket noodles and shrimp wonton noodles are very good. The special morning tea is also good, and there are many kinds of fruits. A folding fan in Mandarin Oriental No. 1 store can be purchased at the SPA center on the 4th floor. The price is not cheap at 300, but the commemorative significance of the folding fan to M.O. is indeed extraordinary. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the concierge did not serve me when entering and leaving the store. I don't know if I dress like a student and don't live in a hotel...

For example, in Wenhua, you can‚Äôt wrap your eyes around your waist, and I don‚Äôt agree with the idea that living at Wenhua is used to go shopping at Taikoo Hui. The Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental in Ji Yutang&#39;s writings is located in Tianhe, but has the calmness of Liwan. Calm and extraordinary, moving with sparkling gold. Guangzhou in June was so emotional, I couldn&#39;t stop my tears. Fortunately, the Oulong citrus note appeared in time, one pure is also in the cup, and the geranium essential oil is sucking every inch of your skin. You are not a tourist in this city, but an additional hometown. (Thank you very much to all the people I met in Mandarin, Susanna, Kitty, manbo, and the waiter on the 19th floor) Thank you for meeting me.

Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, the quality is very good, and the service of the breakfast restaurant is perfect. There are places where I feel inadequate. The time to check in is too late. I arrived at the store at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, waited for almost 2 hours, and only moved in at 6 o'clock. Although I have arranged to have free coffee in the restaurant, I am really tired. . The lady who checked in at the front desk said that she would send a snack to express her apology. I stayed for two nights, and I didn't send the room in the end. I guess I forgot. In fact, as a guest, it is not good to call the hotel for a snack. In addition, there are too many girls posing in groups in the corridor and in the elevator, and they will encounter them every time they walk out of the room.

msg:The location is very good, but the scenery is average, and the service is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. I originally booked the most basic superior room, but I was upgraded to a cultural suite. Because there was no ground parking space in the hotel that came by car, I was told to park at Taikoo Hui's parking lot at my own expense. I thought it was very unreasonable, so I called the hotel and hoped to check out. After consulting the room manager at the front desk, I was given free parking for this stay because I was not familiar with the policy for the first time. When I checked in, I got a free upgrade. I was really a little resentful, but the two waves of operations directly filled me with goodwill. But even so, I personally still think that at least we should reach a cooperation with shopping malls. In addition to the pitiful parking spaces at the entrance of the hotel, the underground parking lot needs to be paid for by this grade of hotel, which is unreasonable.

This time, the contact training of guest relations asked me about my stay experience and said that I can comment when I have time. The water pressure of the shower is very good and the bedding is comfortable. Members will send a small bottle of aromatherapy sleep aids. Although Oulong is a domestic OEM, the quality is still acceptable. The two Michelin-starred Jiang Restaurant is as good as ever! The overall service attitude is good. In particular, I want to say that the hotel management will reward your good staff when they see trouble. Dinner on the 29th is a young lady who works in a western restaurant and wears glasses. I said that I needed ketchup, he told me to wait a moment, but I took it I went back to my seat and thought about picking it up later. She didn't know where I was sitting, but she still found my seat with ketchup, which surprised me. There is also a suggestion that Taikoo Hui's parking coupons can be sent all the time. There are only a few parking spaces on the ground. Basically, you have to stop at Taikoo Hui every time. If you don‚Äôt have consumption in Taikoo Hui, the daily parking fee is really expensive.

In addition to parking is really inconvenient, others are perfect! The hotel is next to Taikoo Hui shopping mall in Tianhe District.

From the room card to the drinking water, it can be seen that the hotel has a strong sense of environmental protection, and the flower arrangement at the front desk is beautiful. Because I didn't get to taste the famous Jiang Restaurant on the weekend, it can be regarded as a memory to come back next time.

msg:Mandarin Oriental has always been one of the best brands in my mind. As an unqualified M.O fan, it has been staying in many M.Os in the Asia-Pacific region in the past ten years. Due to the epidemic during the Spring Festival this year, there is not much desire to travel abroad, so staycation has become the best choice. I decided to choose Mandarin Oriental despite my family's opinions from InterContinental, Jumeirah, and Rosewood. Moreover, the 1.8k Chinese New Year package price includes 500 dining credits, and I still think it is very good value. When booking, it is good to note that I hope that a double bed and a double bed are similar to the same floor, but I am also mentally prepared. This holiday will definitely be a lot of staycation passengers, so on the day of check-in, I still call the hotel in advance to repeat the appeal and inform the estimated arrival time. As a result, 1445 arrived at the store and was told that the big bed room was ready, but the twin room had not been cleaned and needed to wait for a while. This is normal, so after sending the luggage to the big bed room, I went to hang out. Call 1600 to check if it is OK, and tell me 40 minutes. The adjacent twin room can be fixed, but 1730 called again and told that it was still being cleaned, and that there was a problem during the cleaning process. It took another 40 minutes to wait for spare parts, and then asked if there were other rooms even on different floors. Answer Said if the twin room still has to wait at least 10-15 minutes, as a staycation purpose, waited for nearly three hours to nearly 6 o'clock in the evening and still did not get the room, as the standard of MO, I feel quite unqualified, with a family size Check in is also a little uncomfortable. I called again and hoped that I could immediately give me a room of any type as long as it was ready. As a result, this time the little brother was quite straightforward and gave me a Mandarin room (corner room) on the same floor. He also emphasized that he has given me two upgrades. But to be honest, I really don't care about this, but it's a little less irritating when I get the room. In addition, I would like to express my appreciation to Dan, the new head of Ebony from South Korea. It is said that he has only been here for two weeks. Wenhua, who was in Sanya before, although not fluent in Chinese, communicates smoothly in English. He has a very good sense of service and is also very diligent. Also gave a lot of strategies for Sanya Wenhua. The breakfast the next day also encountered a problem with staycation, that is, there were too many guests with breakfast room types, resulting in long queues. I feel that Guangzhou Wenhua is a little underprepared for the staycation package launched during the Chinese New Year, and the occupancy rate is high, and the package provides an early C/I of 1200 and a Late C/O policy of 1600 for check-out, which makes a huge gap in room circulation, and breakfast is also available. In a similar situation, since the corresponding packages all include breakfast, it is estimated that there will be problems with ebony's staff and even the circulation of tables. This lack of preparation makes Mandarin Oriental's consistently excellent service level a little compromised. I hope the hotel management can sum up the experience. M.O is still my best choice

I took a shower next door for about ten minutes. The lighting system in the room is not user-friendly. Once the main switch is turned off, the whole house will be darkened. When going to the toilet in the middle of the night, you have to find a toilet light. The room is very small, and it is awkward. It is not like the 60 square meters mentioned in the introduction. It is probably related to the design. In many spaces, the aging curtain switch system is not easy to use. Let's talk about the service. The receptionist called Joy zhao at the front desk is not professional. The questions asked are not answered, and the answers are not positive, just like not hearing them. While eating in the restaurant, a woman came to promote membership, 3800 a year, my mother, is Wang Jianlin so short of money? Can you wait for me to finish my meal? It's endless. It's time to make a movie. The restaurant also has a waitress surnamed Huang. Why didn't she give me the list after I paid for it? The signature is not for me to write in block letters. Isn't cursive script Chinese? Dinner is basically our table, very deserted. During breakfast, hot coffee accidentally spilled on my body and got burned.

The concierge's Bryce xie is especially good for developing in the service industry.

Because I live often, the handsome manager on duty will give me a big upgrade without saying a word~ The room is beautiful Ah ~ the room is clean and tidy ~ I feel very relaxed as soon as I enter, and the aura is very right. Opposite is the pure k walk. It is very convenient to play. The kitten at the door was taken care of by the staff. The aura was very smooth during the stay. The bed was moderately soft and hard, and the duvet was fluffy and warm. Had a very happy Valentine's Day~

But the sofa and chairs in the room feel that they have collapsed for a long time, and it is uncomfortable to sit up, but there is no other choice. The price list of the minibar is too hidden. I searched for a long time and didn't find it. I thought it was free at first, but I found it after asking the housekeeping depar**ent, which is not kind.
The service of the hotel is quite satisfactory, and there are some etiquettes, but there is no need to be humane. One day I didn‚Äôt eat because of work. In the middle of the night, my stomach was very uncomfortable and I wanted to drink some soup. When ordering takeout, the takeout can only be delivered to the pick-up place outside the hotel, and the front desk will not deliver it anyway, so I can only endure the discomfort and go outside to get it, and seeing other people buying medicine at the pick-up place is probably not a good idea. Sent upstairs. Now all major hotels have food delivery robots. This kind of detail service is not in place. I don't think I will stay there again in the future. After all, there is a hotel that is in danger of life and does not respond.

The only drawback of the hotel may be the parking problem, but there are not many parking spaces outside the hotel when there are too many people. My boyfriend and I stayed on Monday and there were many parking spaces!
Dessert lovers must try the macarons sold in the lobby! So delicious, help! I bought a box and prepared to eat it slowly, but it was so delicious that I couldn't stop it and finished it! When I left, I bought their croissants and doughnuts, which was really amazing!
Next time I have a chance, I will definitely come and stay for a few more days!

This night view and sunrise view, as well as various exquisite decoration designs, are so beautiful~ Although the breakfast buffet is not as diverse as other restaurants, it is better than small and beautiful. The taste of dandan noodles is amazing and amazing! I'm a fan too!

msg:Because of what happened at Jumeirah yesterday, I was replaced by Mandarin Oriental. The living is very comfortable and the design is not uncomfortable. In general, this price is worth living, and the service and hotel hardware and software are good. There is a small problem that can be equipped with more two-hole sockets or converters, and now the national standard has been unified.

msg:The experience of this hotel is so good, it must be commented:
1. Location, the most prosperous and convenient place in Tianhe District, on the east side of Taikoo Hui; because it is a leisure vacation, there is no special goal, the surrounding delicious and delicious food can be found on the public comment, and basically you will not step on thunder; go south I won‚Äôt elaborate on the Guangdong Provincial Museum, Library, Grand Theatre, etc., Central Plaza, Teemall. Don't want it if the location is good. In addition, what I like is: Tianhe Sports Center, 500 meters away, there is a standard playground, there is a round of 975 running and walkways for national fitness. I go for a lap every morning and have a good sports a**osphere. There are also many people. In my first principle of choosing the location of the hotel, there must be a place where you can run.
2. Cleanliness: Needless to say, cleaning is done once a day, and once in the evening. It will be cleaned up again according to the wishes of the residents; Needless to say, it has many five-star conditions;
3. Service: Too considerate. Regardless of the front desk, restaurant, or room service, you will feel truly happy, sincere and happy to treat you. Different positions in many hotels will be uneven. Those in Guangzhou were too hot. There were a lot of time in the room. One day, two people actually drank 8 bottles of water until the morning. I couldn‚Äôt drink it after running. I went to the front desk to ask for water and delivered it immediately. The customer service clerk explained: Under normal circumstances, there is a charge for exceeding the ration, and nothing else is said. Then at the front desk, the staff who knew about it explained in particular: because the imported water of a brand was changed, it was limited; but it was still on the same day. I replenished 10 bottles of water.
4. Facilities: I forgot to see what year the hotel was built. The facilities are good and very new, and because the room is large, the sofa, dining table, and workbench are all very good. Needless to say, other products, the taste and texture are also liked.
5. The buffet breakfast ordered with the room is very cheap. The restaurant is small in size. There are a few different Chinese and Western dishes. There are few guests. The dining environment is very good. The coffee is especially good and the milk quality is particularly good. We like it very much, especially the Western-style breakfast such as poached eggs.
6. Especially after eating Cantonese food for a few days, eat more salads and change the taste of Western food.

msg:The purpose of staying this time was to be a cripple, so I booked a room at the Oriental Club. The Oriental Club lived up to expectations and succeeded in making me a cripple.

From the beginning of check-in, the staff of the Oriental Club were very patient, registering information, bringing in the room, and introducing the room facilities. They were very attentive. The varieties of afternoon tea and happy hour are not diverse, but the quality is very high. In addition, the drinks are plentiful, the service is meticulous and impeccable.

Every time I live in Mandarin, because the bathtub is big enough! The shower water volume is sufficient, the temperature is stable, the bath and the toilet are separated from dry and wet, the room space utilization is very high, and the layout is also very clever.

My favorite is the intimate design of Wenhua. Many spaces are separated by tall mirrors, which not only retain privacy, but also appear spacious. The dark wood decoration and the soft lighting a**osphere make people relax.

The next day, breakfast was served at Ebony on the fourth floor. The environment was the same as before. To be honest, the service was not as good as the Eastern Club on the 24th floor. The best drink is soy milk, other products are quite satisfactory. I had breakfast at Waldorf Astoria in Bangkok. Every product was amazing. Benedict was actually decorated with black truffles. The breakfast in Guangzhou Wenhua was a bit mediocre.

It is worth mentioning that the companion is unwell in the middle of the night and needs a hot water bottle, but I asked the hotel and did not have this facility. It is recommended to add it in case of emergency. This is also a problem that a hotel of this level of Mandarin Oriental needs to solve for the guests.

All in all, the flaws are not concealed. Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental is indeed my favorite hotel in Guangzhou. Whether it is decoration design or Oriental Club service, it perfectly interprets the meaning of staycation.

msg:1. Maybe the hotel occupancy rate is relatively high, you need to wait a while to get a room, but the entire check-in process is very smooth and not cumbersome. Although it takes about 30 minutes to check in to the room, it does not feel time-consuming, because there are also waiting times. Some drinks are provided in a comfortable environment, the service is also very good, the hotel staff are very polite and soft-spoken. 2. The room is clean and comfortable, with a good view, and very quiet. I slept well all night. 3. The yoyo bartending in the executive lounge is also great and the service is very nice. 4. The semi-buffet breakfast is very rich. 5. Although the swimming pool is narrow, the water quality is good and the length is sufficient. There is also a warm bubble pool. 6. In summary, the overall stay is very satisfactory.

As soon as I entered the room, a stool was placed. This kind of humanization The facilities at a glance bring the feeling of going home, the room facilities are luxurious and low-key, the bedding is very comfortable, the outdoor swimming pool is not big, one step at a time, this hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very characteristic, unlike some hotels with a lot of open files, nothing to eat Yes, his family puts a lot of unique features on the menu to ensure the quality, and the wonton is very good. This hotel is integrated with TaiKoo Hui, so there is no problem shopping and eating. Mandarin Oriental really maintains consistent quality and full service.

msg:Booking through Ctrip, I also called the hotel to inform the flight and the decision to arrange the room early, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the previous guest had not checked out and asked me to wait. I went to the Chinese restaurant on the third floor for dinner. After the meal, I still didn't get the room, and it was 3:20 when I went in. This is an episode! The rooms in the hotel are very large. The rooms of the same star rating should be considered big. The facilities are average, and even I think it is a bit old. The hotel is next to Taikoo Hui. Friends who like to go shopping can choose. The road to the entrance is always blocked, followed by breakfast. , The price of 228 yuan is too little, and there is no way to compare with Chongqing Regent! The price is not high. After seeing many hotels, I chose "Mandarin Oriental" for the "Wenhua" brand, which is incomparable to Hong Kong's Landmark Mandarin. It is not on the same level. "Wenhua" claims to give guests a homely feeling. I am based in Guangzhou. Mandarin Oriental didn't feel it, the front desk service consciousness is poor, and I don't know how to work around. I just say "I'm sorry" and there is no solution. It only feels fake to me! Also, I want to say that the hotel‚Äôs wifi is free and charged. The free signal is very poor, and the charge is 60 yuan/day (compared to the room rate, the network is cheap)

msg:Check in the guest roomüè®
üè°Guest rooms The rooms are very spacious, the partitions are reasonable, and the overall style is relatively retro, which completely combines modern and oriental traditional elements. Although the hotel has been around for a few years, the maintenance is acceptable. The bedding is very soft and there is no pressure to fall asleep. And the hotel is soundproof
Configuration üëâMaybe because it is an old hotel, the equipment is not as complete as the current new hotel. There is a plug at the head of the bed without a usb port. The TV cannot connect to the mobile phone. Currently equipped with electric curtains, minibar, coffee machine, iron, safe, weight scale, etc. The toiletries are atelier cologne (but why is it canned?), and the taste can be so dry that it seems to be improved.
ü§îThe most interesting thing is the entry-level cabinet (this cabinet can be opened inside and outside, and the waiter has a transmission channel when delivering things or helping customers pick up laundry, so they don‚Äôt disturb each other and are not afraid of losing things.)
üìçThe location is very good, just above Taikoo Hui, right in the middle of the city. It‚Äôs this area that often gets stuck in traffic

Hotel Serviceüë©üèª‚Äçüíº
The overall service of the hotel is still available. The call is kind to call the customer's last name, and the room service details are all possible. The room type is also upgraded for free. The turndown service time is customized according to the customer and there is no time limit.
But the details are worth improving
‚ùóÔ∏è Suggestions:
1 | When I checked in, I waited 30 minutes to check in. There was a serious shortage of seats in the lobby and I stood there for half an hour. During the period, no one in the front hall said to send water or anything, and the concierge only gave directions and instructions for the location.
2 | The room requires a turn-down service, but because the Do Not Disturb is turned on, there is no turn-down service. Although there is a sign, respect the guests' do not disturb. In fact, I think I can communicate via text messages or phone calls.

Hotel diningü•ô "Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Guangzhou Yue Boni Western Restaurant"
The breakfast is super five-star praise [strong] The quality, service attitude, and dining environment have nothing to say!
Semi-buffet. In addition to the regular dishes, the buffet part also has some special Cantonese morning tea dishes. The ordering part is amazing, and there is no limit to the number of orders.
‚è∞The meal time is 6.30-10.30

üâëOverall evaluation
The hotel has some years, but the environment and the configuration that a luxury hotel should have. The hotel has more cultural heritage, and the retro-style rooms reflect great details in the details. The geographical location does not even mention the Tianhe business district. Nearby commercial complexes include Taikoo Hui, Zhengjia, and Wanlinghui.
But the service hopes to be improved, no matter how busy a hotel is, the service is to make every guest feel the most direct experience.

msg:It's terrible. There is no parking space in the hotel. You can only park in the open-air parking lot outside the hotel lobby. Taikoo Hui pays for it at your own expense. They also outsource the open-air parking lot to the hotel. The service is particularly poor. It doesn't matter whether you can stay in the hotel or not, if there is no parking space, just I will chase you away! The hotel actually has a parking handler at Taikoo Hui. I heard that it should be handled by separate people. It is a particularly snobbish hotel. Let‚Äôs figure it out for ourselves. At worst, we won‚Äôt stay at their place. There are so many hotels in Guangzhou. Isn‚Äôt the Four Seasons nice? The exterior of the Cultural Oriental Hotel is very poor, there is nothing, and the service is poor. When checking in, the front desk said it would give the children chocolates, but they didn't. The children kept asking me, and finally went to Taikoo Hui to buy them! I don‚Äôt know how to do this, and it‚Äôs still a five-star rating. It‚Äôs terrible, terrible, terrible‚Ä¶ the scenery is terrible, the TV is small, I‚Äôm too lazy to complain.

msg:The result after the experience is very disappointing, and the following comments are made:
To
I‚Äôve checked in since 8pm. I‚Äôm used to exercising every day. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the hotel is expensive. The hotel must have a gym. The gym must be clean and well-equipped. I came to the gym at about 9:10. The hallway of the gym was dark and dark. Fire, a little waiter in the gloom said that because of the epidemic, it closed at 9 o‚Äôclock. Please tell me that the results of Guangzhou‚Äôs high-efficiency anti-epidemic effects are obvious to all. The dine-in meal has been restored last week. Today, the 48-hour nucleic acid from Guangzhou will be lifted Yes, I checked in more than eight o'clock, and there was no service at nine o'clock. Isn't it possible that I am not worried about the epidemic before nine o'clock, and I am worried about the epidemic after nine o'clock. What is the rationale for this! ! It turns out that this is the service beyond your expectations! !
On the day of check-out, I inquired about five-star hotels such as Shangri-La Hotel, Conrad Hotel, W Hotel, etc. The gyms of these several gyms are now open until 11 pm, and even open 24 hours, so your hotel The business hours of the gym‚Äôs epidemic situation are indeed quite special among hotels of the same level.
More disappoin**ent is still to come. Guests who can stay at the Golden Diamond Mandarin Oriental Hotel, which is known as the super five-star hotel, are also very concerned about quality. If you don‚Äôt care about quality and sleep, you can go to a regular hotel. Why spend a lot of money? Come to Mandarin Oriental for ten hours at a higher price. Just follow what the hotel said about epidemic prevention and control. The gym closes in advance and does not provide services for the sake of guests. Why is the shower gel and shampoo in the shower room similar to that of the small hotel? The same, three large bottles are self-filled in bulk, and they are shared. According to the volume of the bottle, it is added at least once every 3 weeks. Fortunately, why I stayed in the hotel after the epidemic, but also used a few weeks ago during the epidemic. Bulk self-filling shower gel shampoo, this does not need epidemic prevention and control? What if the previous guest has already been infected if he touches the skin with the same bottle of shower gel? ? In case of encountering an unscrupulous person pranking and adding dirty things into the bottle, the guests will continue to use the contaminated shower gel shampoo without knowing it? There are many such cases on the Internet. Do you care about the cost every time you use a small bottle?
Why don't you care about the epidemic here? The gym does not have services in advance to close the door for epidemic prevention. Shower shampoos that touch the skin of guests do not need epidemic prevention. This is a double standard! !
Later, I went to the gym and exercised. I was disappointed when I saw the gym facilities. The most basic Smith machine in the gym was not available. There was no gantry frame. There were only two barbell bars on the ground. I couldn't do bench press or pull-ups.
I also experienced the real service of your store, which really exceeded expectations. The Shangri-La Hotel and Hilton Hotel gym have these configurations. The Mandarin Oriental, which is known as the Golden Diamond, does not have it! !
      So disappointed, I don‚Äôt want to stay in again in the future

msg:I have always hoped to experience the Six Diamond Hotel in Guangzhou. My feelings from the day I entered the Mandarin Oriental Hotel: There is no parking space. I asked a staff member if the hotel has other parking spaces. The staff member said: The hotel has its own parking lot downstairs. The location is very convenient (I was not informed of the charge). I went to the front desk and said that I had a car parked downstairs in the hotel. Would you like to register? The front desk said: There is no parking fee for ground parking, but there is a fee for underground parking. You can use it on Ctrip If you book a hotel, you don‚Äôt enjoy free parking. If you become a member, you can enjoy free underground parking when you book a hotel with us, and can you enjoy more discounts? I asked her: Your staff must first inform you that there is a charge for underground parking. Those who enjoy the knowledge. I like to book hotels on Ctrip, you let customers become your members? Ctrip is about to shut down, and you poach corners on Ctrip's platform? The hotel room is not well sealed, the sound insulation is not good, and the next door makes a lot of noise, which seriously affects our rest. The manager on duty that night called me and asked if I wanted to change the room. I said I was in the parking lot downstairs. He asked me when I would arrive at the room. I said I would return to the room in 10 minutes. I didn't dare to go out in the room, waiting for the duty to deal with the problem, and I didn't know when to come to deal with it. I didn't sleep well all night, and I was afraid that someone would knock on the door. (This is typical of pigeons releasing guests). When I registered at the hotel, a staff member told me that I could enjoy a 10% discount when dining in the hotel. We had dinner at the hotel (Jiang) Mi Erxing at noon. The hotel service is very poor. When entering and leaving the room to meet the hotel personnel, the hotel work clothes do not greet us. There is no sense of service, and there may be no training. On October 21, I stayed at Beijing Mandarin Oriental Hotel/Seven Diamond, 4014 yuan/night, and felt that the service was completed differently. Personally, I think Guangzhou Culture Oriental Hotel is the worst in the industry. It is a surprise that such a hotel is rated as six diamonds.

Now, the dust is three feet thick, and the toiletries have become large jars for sharing? ? ? ? ? ? Oh my God! It also discriminates against customers of third-party platforms. It is also a consumption. You must make an official reservation before you can park for free in the underground garage. Ctrip reservations must be paid at your own expense. It is 20 yuan per hour, with no cap! ! Don't believe the security front desk who says there may be parking spaces at the door. The parking spaces are in a mess and don't look like a star-rated hotel at all! If you want to cause monopoly trouble, you have such a thick skin and require traffic from a third party.

msg:The service is very poor and the concierge is a complete show-off. When you check in, you are required to register with the police station online before entering. The Four Seasons and White Swan hotels that I just stayed at before did not have such a requirement. You only need the Guangdong Health Code. During the entire online check-in process, the concierge staff not only did not help me with my luggage or agreed to store my luggage first, but also specifically refused to let me in. This staff member stood next to me and watched me check in online the whole time. Not only was he not helpful in any way, but when I wanted to put my luggage on the chair at the entrance of the lobby, he specifically stopped me from entering with his hand. I was in the summer heat of Guangzhou. Holding my luggage and not letting me sit down. After complaining, the hotel just makes excuses without any real solution. After this happened, I was not allowed to cancel the reservation and stay at another hotel, saying that the room I booked was non-cancellable. I was completely fooled by the poor service. Later, I asked the front office manager to provide compensation and upgrade me to a room type. But it doesn't really solve the problem at all. There was no apology from the staff for the delay. What's funny is that the guests who came in later and spoke Cantonese were not stopped at the gate. The stay experience is not up to par with Four Seasons or Rosewood.

msg:I have stayed in so many 5-star hotels, and you are the first to charge for parking. Why bother? If I can afford to stay in your hotel, will the 100 yuan difference in parking fees be the difference? Can't we just increase the room rate? The hotel decision-maker is disgusting here. The rooms are old and musty, and Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou is in decline.

msg:Why give it one point?
The hotel bluntly stated that you booked it on Ctrip! So the parking fee is at your own expense!
Come and get a membership card from me! Parking fees are free when you book on the official website!
My email address was scammed! I thought I could avoid it this time too! The results tell me that it will be done next time! I said I won‚Äôt register anymore! Pay for parking at your own expense! After leaving the store, I received a message to register as a member! Are you stupid! Isn‚Äôt it stupid! There are so many hotels why choose yours? I‚Äôll book with Ctrip! discount price! More choices! Give away points!
