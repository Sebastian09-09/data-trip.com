msg:The stay at the 4points by Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula was very enjoyable. From Sanya Airport we took the HSR to Shenzhou station and ordered a Didi there to take us to the hotel (~20min). Apparently there is also an Airport shuttle service by the hotel but to my knowledge it isnt free and only goes 2 times a day. Anyways, once there, the check in was quick and convenient. The walk to the room at the east end was quite long (big hotel). The room was quite big, clean and had all necessary equipment, but it is noticeable that everything has come to an age or appeared to be worn out a little. Also the bathroom always smelled a bit „smokey“ and there was also an noticeable smell from the toilet drainage. All in all the room was still satisfying yet it comes at a quite expensive price where you could expect better. The breakfast had many meal choices, but nothing that was over the top. Especially the very limited fruit offer on a tropical island like Hainan was disappointing. For a Trip-5 Star-hotel at this price point it could do better. 
The outside facilities of the hotel were very nice and relatively well maintained. The big pool was a highlight. Also its location directly at the sea with a big beautiful beach is nice. But yet again the downside is you are not allowed to swim in the sea. Yet always someone was trying to sell some surfing courses, jetski ride or other activities. I understand the safety concern, but as an experienced swimmer with lifeguard training it was a bit ridiculous. Still having a long sunset walk at the beach is amazing. For having dinner, there are a few decent choices in the 1km footwalk vicinity. Some restaurant areas can be reached by walking down the beach. My favorite though was the „Corona-Bar“ directly in front of the hotel, which serves semi-authentic Mexican dishes and nice cocktails. It comes at a higher price point, but if you make the correct food choices it is very delicious. 
Check out was also quick and comfortable and to summarize, we had an enjoyable stay. I only think for the price you pay there is still some space for little improvements by the hotel.

Price to stay was reasonable, service and staff overall good. An amazing swimming pool that was virtually empty the whole time.
Spacious rooms and a well equipped gym. 
With a world class golf course minutes away it was a memorable stay.

msg:The hotel is beautifully situated with its own beach. The landscaping and grounds are picturesque as are the ocean views. I have previously stayed in big hotels in Sanya that involve long walks to the facilities and the beach. However, this hotel is really nicely sized. The lagoon pools and infinity pools were great, though I did wonder a bit about the cleanliness levels. I was initially concerned about reviews saying the place looked aged, but in person the rooms seemed fine, spacious and clean. The service was excellent on every level. They did not have a business center but they helped me out with some business needs. The breakfast was diverse and they made sure to keep the buffet filled up despite a large number of diners. All in all, it was a very refreshing and enjoyable stay. Note that taking a train from Sanya Airport to Wanning is not difficult and economical if the timing works well for your flights.

My favourite part was the infinity pool looking over the beach and the ocean, I could spend the whole day in the pool. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel gym was one of the best I've used. Absolutely great breakfast, always fresh and tasty. The hotel restaurant had exceptionally good prices and great quality. The hotel was  extremely clean with staff keeping it clean day and night. The hotel is close to some shops and restaurants that are affordable but the area is not too busy. In my opinion this is the best location and hotel to stay at in Hainan.

One breakfast included in the deal is a joke since I booked for two people! It sounded weird but that was really it. What do we do, we alternate? Make 0 or 2!
Moreover, the hotel refused to fully reimburse remaining nights after we left earlier. Reimbursed only 1 night out of two. Looks like they like number 1 more than 2. Really disappointed, will not go back!

msg:The Sheraton Hotel has first-class service, first-class environment, and first-class hardware conditions. The hotel is located in Hainan, with green trees and red flowers all year round. The entire Shenzhou Peninsula is the only luxury hotel with beautiful beaches. This is the hardware part. The hotel is remarkable in the details of entertaining tourists. The hotel butler started to contact us one day in advance and sent us a lot of travel tips and information about various activities in the hotel. After arriving at the store, the service staff led the butler to register for us and prepared a small gift of a set of sand digging tools. There is a small episode here. The iron tools we brought were temporarily detained by the high-speed rail. We walked through 2 buildings to the room. The scenery was very good. We went downstairs to the swimming pool in the afternoon and found out that our parent-child room was very close to the swimming pool. This small detail of the arrangement was experienced. It was very convenient to participate in activities and walk on the beach in the next two days. The hotel butler will come to register and check the day's activities every morning. The hotel has many parent-child activities. The hotel has designed many projects for children. We have experienced them all. We played in the hotel for 4 days and the schedule was full. This is thanks to the service of the butler. Come again next year

msg:Because I work in the hotel industry, I was very rigorous in choosing hotels. I chartered a car to go to Shimei Bay, Shenzhou Peninsula and other places to make choices. I also looked at many highly rated hotels, but my advice to everyone is to really go and see them in person. I was not very satisfied after reading it, but I still believed in the brand and chose Sheraton. As soon as the Didi car stopped, at the gate of the hotel, the first porter came to open the door to help with the luggage and actively introduced the luggage storage service. When checking in, he took the initiative to introduce the swimming pool and the best route to the beach, because the hotel is downstairs to the beach, so it is more convenient. In the evening, I received a check-in return call from the housekeeper Don and took the initiative to add WeChat. He introduced the surrounding attractions and various facilities and functions of the hotel in detail, and informed the hotel of the breakfast dining time, and gave some details such as when there is no need to queue, and the service was really good. There were many varieties of breakfast in the morning of the next day. The restaurant manager served very well and took the initiative to pour us coffee, etc. Because it rained in the morning, we waited until the rain stopped before going out to play. The housekeeper Don delayed our check-out for free, which was really considerate. My family asked me about my experience of this trip, and I recommended this hotel to them. Overall, I believe the brand is not wrong, the service standards and hygiene standards are guaranteed. I recommend it and it won't be a bad deal

The swimming pool is very fun and suitable for children. It's very photogenic. There are fewer people in the off-season and there is no queue for breakfast. In short, everything is good. Make sure to check it in advance. Come again next time~

Facilities: As a four-star ⭐ hotel under Marriott, Four Points is more cost-effective than the Sheraton next door. The price is only more than half, which is really high. This four-day and three-night trip, I decided to move from Sheraton to Four Points on the last night. Well, my son said it was more comfortable than the Sheraton next door, and the service was okay.
Service: As a gold card member of Marriott and Hilton, the most satisfying thing about staying at the Four Points Wanning this time was the housekeeper Ella, which touched me very much. Five-star praise must be given to her! She contacted us in advance about the itinerary, reminded us of various precautions, asked if we needed help, and knew that I was traveling alone with my baby this time, and gave the children local snacks for free breakfast. I think next time I come to Wanning, I will choose to stay here because of such service.

The hotel swimming pool is very clean, and the beach is just a few minutes away. It is very fine and suitable for bringing children to play.
This stay experience is super good, good reviews☺️☺️

Although the hotel is relatively early, if you need anything, tell the housekeeper Ella. She almost responds to your requests, responds promptly, and is very considerate.

msg:One of the highlights of the hotel is the beach, which is juxtaposed with its two major hotels. The long sealine and open beach take advantage of the right time and place. The super-large infinity swimming pool is the most shocking, not inferior to Cape Dara Resort Pattaya in Thailand. The beach is covered with There are countless soaking pools of different sizes and shapes, which will amaze everyone. This is a paradise for young people to vacation, and the elderly have also painted it with a bright color; the second highlight is the real customer service butler. Special mention should be made to the girl Don. The service started the day before check-in. She accompanied us throughout the check-in process. She also helped us push our luggage and explained the hotel's services in detail. She was considerate and warm-hearted in taking care of our two 80+ year olds. She often asked about our well-being. The warmth of having our children by our side has greatly enhanced our expectations of beautiful things during our trip to Hainan. If there is a next time, we will definitely choose Four Points again, and we will highly recommend Four Points to our relatives and friends! [Rose][Strong][Embrace]

The price of Four Points is very affordable, which is more cost-effective. There are many parent-child projects here, which is very suitable for traveling with children. If couples stay, they can drink at the beach bar and blow the sea breeze. I would like to thank Xiao Tang, the housekeeper, for his warm hospitality and responsiveness. He has caused a lot of trouble for Xiao Tang. Thank you! ! He gave us a birthday cake when he learned that my girlfriend's birthday was coming. 🍰 When I encountered the problem of poor sound insulation, he helped me change the room and upgraded the room type for free! !

Hot water comes out very quickly, 2 seconds.
Hygiene: Very clean, bedding and linens are changed for each guest.
Environment: Near Shenzhou Peninsula in Wanning, taxis basically arrive in seconds to go around, all at the starting price.
Service: I especially praise the guest service butler Tina, who contacted me the day before check-in, synchronized the guide, and answered questions carefully. Seeing that I booked a single breakfast for couples, she took the initiative to help me apply for a double breakfast. Hahaha, I just pulled my lazy partner up to have breakfast together, and the breakfast was very rich.
It was a very satisfying May Day trip.

During the May Day holiday, although the hotel prices were much higher and there were many people, the hotel service was still very good. The hotel swimming pool is very large. Four Points is more suitable for taking children out, because the swimming pool is large enough for children of all ages to play. The swimming pool of the Sheraton next door can also be played here. You can rent an electric two-wheeler or three-wheeler to go to the nearby town 1 km away for dinner, which is not very expensive. I also went to the Chinese restaurant of the Sheraton next door for dinner. Although the price-performance ratio is average, it is not bad. The hotel is directly connected to the beach. There are many things to do on the beach. The sunset bar and the bar are particularly good for taking pictures. Special thanks to the hotel's housekeeper John/Xiao Chen. I added WeChat before checking in to inform him of the hotel information and entertainment information. He was on call during the stay. Two beetles accidentally entered the room at 11 o'clock in the evening, and I was able to contact them normally and came to deal with it in time. I also saw several beetles in the yard the next day. It seems that this beetle is very common here in this season.

I couldn't bear to book the Sheraton next door, so I chose Four Points Sheraton, which was slightly more suitable and relatively more cost-effective. Because the two hotels are together, the beach, swimming pool and related baby-walking facilities are shared, so I think Four Points is enough. Overall, I am satisfied. The room is relatively large, the breakfast is rich in variety, and you can eat outdoors while looking at the coconut trees. The a**osphere is full. The only shortcoming is the foot-washing facilities near the upper swimming pool. Two shower heads in three rooms are broken, and only one of the three wash basins has water. It is not right that this was not repaired before the holiday.

The room didn't have a dehumidifier, so it was a little humid.
We checked in just after 16:00 in the afternoon, and there was still a room that hadn't been cleaned.
We talked to the front desk and asked them to make up a bed guard, but they didn't come to install it until after 9pm, when the children were all asleep.
The room was given fruit, but the oranges were broken.
For such a family-friendly hotel, the room didn't have family slippers and toothbrushes, etc. Later, at around 9pm, the housekeeper said that the front desk could pick them up. Why didn't they give them to us when we checked in? When our children entered the facial recognition, didn't they know that we were bringing children?
It's commendable that the hotel pool and beach are very convenient, and takeout and meals are quite convenient, and it's not troublesome to pick them up by yourself.
We didn't experience many parent-child projects because we were short of time. We participated in the bubble party in the children's pool, and the children were still very happy.
The beach next to the hotel is very good, but there was a lot of plastic garbage when we went there in the morning.

Especially the bath water, I am very satisfied, the temperature is suitable, the water flow is also suitable, and the water pressure does not hurt the body. It is so comfortable to take a bath in the summer. The double bed room is about 1.3 meters long, which is actually very spacious. There is no problem for me and my husband to lie down. I originally wanted to book a big bed, but because it was too temporary, I could only book a twin bed. Overall, I was very satisfied, and the front desk check-in was also very fast. I just don’t understand why the room fee and deposit were paid twice, but fortunately, after communication, only the room fee was collected without the deposit, but when checking out, it was said that the room fee was deducted from the deposit. I don’t understand. The front desk feels that the training is still not in place. The deposit and room fee are not distinguished. I have paid a security deposit of the same value as the room fee to Ctrip when booking the room. So I don’t want to pay the deposit when checking in at the front desk. Finally, I would like to praise the housekeeper Tina, who is very careful. There were leftovers in our room, and she helped us go to the room and find them carefully after leaving the hotel. Thank you very much, the overall experience is good, but the breakfast needs to be improved. The Casa Corona restaurant and bar by the beach is a good place to check in and eat, but the painted floor should be carefully considered by pregnant women, after all, there is formaldehyde.

Because we arrived late, she helped us make an appoin**ent for the children's activities, so that the children could participate in the activities first while the parents checked in. After checking in, we were given small snacks from the South as souvenirs, and there were welcome fruits in the room. The rooms of Four Points are indeed simpler and decorated earlier, but the additional services and activities for children are very rich. There are many places suitable for clocking in on the beach, and the breakfast is rich in variety. At dinner time, the housekeeper Ella will also recommend surrounding food, answer any questions, and respond to any requests. The advantage of a parent-child hotel is that it is very convenient to get children's products, and she will recommend surrounding attractions after leaving the hotel. Overall, the service experience is better than the lack of facilities in the hotel room. Another point is that the travel photographer is very straightforward, without any extra sales promotion, because it was taken before checking out, it was a bit hasty, but I was very satisfied with the original photos that were sent over after the shooting. I wanted to choose some more later, but they were deleted~

msg:The facilities are a little old, but the service is very good. Once you park, they will take the initiative to help you take your luggage to the room. The breakfast variety is good. The swimming pool is shaded by trees, so you don't have to worry about the sun if you go swimming at 4 or 5 in the afternoon. The swimming pool closes at 6 o'clock, so you can go to the beach to play in the water. The sand is very fine and the beach is very flat. The children had a lot of fun and found many hermit crabs.

msg:! I have stayed at many Marriott hotels, but this is my first time staying at Four Points. To be honest, the hotel is a bit beyond my expectations. It is a very cost-effective choice!
The public area is really nice, I like it very much. The lagoon pool by the sea is very beautiful. Unfortunately, it was cloudy during my stay, so I couldn't take pictures of the beautiful scenery. . The garden is well maintained, and the night lights are warm and yellow at night, which is very cozy. CASA CORONA on the beach is worth spending a beautiful night.
The quality of breakfast is also good! There is maple syrup in the bread area, which is a good review!
The room facilities are indeed very old, but it basically does not affect the comfort of the stay. I hope it can be upgraded in the future.
Thank you very much to the housekeeper Ella, who helped to upgrade the sea view room, apply for late check-out, and provided a lot of hotel and entertainment information, which is very considerate. I want to stay here again when I come to Shenzhou Peninsula next time~

This time, I brought my pet to stay again, and Xiao Tang's service was still online. It is one of the few pet-friendly five-star hotels on the Shenzhou Peninsula. The service staff is very accepting of dogs. The pets had fun in the hotel, and we lived comfortably. It was a very good stay experience. I will use it again next time👍👍

msg:Environment: The Sheraton brand is a hotel under the Marriott Group. Next door is the Sheraton Resort Hotel. This time I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton. The hotel is located on the Shenzhou Peninsula. It is only a 20-minute drive from the high-speed rail Shenzhou Station and costs less than 30 yuan. The environment is nothing to say. It is convenient to go anywhere. The hotel is 3 kilometers away from the Shenzhou Peninsula Lighthouse. You can rent an electric car to go there. The scenery is beautiful. Bring your own beach🏖️The outdoor swimming pool, restaurants and bars are all unique
Facilities: There is a shuttle bus between the hotel and Sanya Phoenix Airport. If necessary, you can contact the hotel. After all, the hotel has been open for a long time, and the facilities are not so complete, but everything that should be provided is provided.
Service: Thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Chen for his help with this stay. He upgraded the partial sea view room for free and gave a gift of fruit. 🈶He was always on call and very considerate. The dishes in the breakfast room also met the needs of the public. The taste of the dishes It's okay, I just hope that we can add some delicious dishes with Hainan characteristics. The room service was attentive and very polite. They would greet us when they saw the guests. It was a great stay experience. I originally offered five travel photos and a surfing experience in the hotel pool, but I didn’t use them. I missed them.

Shenzhou Peninsula surfing is very suitable for beginners, and there are not as many people as Riyue Bay, and it is not noisy. Shenzhou Peninsula is still very suitable for eating, staying and playing. If you want to compare the cost-effective choice, choose this one. The hotel has many activities for children, and you can check in for parent-child tours. It is worth recommending. I will come again next time if I have the chance

The whole experience from check-in to check-out was perfect💯. There is a beach right downstairs. Ella, the hotel housekeeper, was also very considerate and nice this time. Because we were traveling with a baby, she thoughtfully arranged bed rails and children's dental equipment. If I had any questions, she responded very quickly. It rained a little in the middle. I was also reminded that I could take the shuttle bus to the Sheraton Indoor Park next door. As expected, I loved taking the shuttle bus even after going to the park. I had a great time. After the rain stopped, I went to the beach again and checked in to the Corona restaurant on the beach. , saw a super beautiful sunset🌄!

For me who have never done any travel guide, this is a surprise. For food, drink, entertainment, transportation and travel in the surrounding area, the housekeeper patiently recommends it like a friend. During this trip to Haikou, Wanning, and Sanya, the Sheraton Fupeng Wanning was the most satisfying place to stay. There are no details. Here comes the key point, here you can see the sea: the sea is right outside the lobby. When the tide goes out in the morning, I even met Dahai Zhe. All the facilities and equipment are new and complete. I took pictures of them online. I was really moved by how beautiful it was. The swimming pool was so clean. I never go into the water. This time I went in because the water was recycled. In short, if I come to Wanning again, I will stay here again...Wanning has been a great trip...

The hotel refused to allow check-out. They asked for a certificate from the hospital and asked to cancel the reservation the next day. I'm sorry. It was our fault. We were too lazy to bother. We arrived at Wanning to check in at nearly 20 o'clock. The reservation was not very friendly to Ctrip, and we couldn't upgrade the room type. Fortunately, the warm-hearted service of the hotel butler Don was pretty good, which soothed my heart. I'm trembling. To be honest, I stayed here because the a**osphere of Sunset Bar and Casa Corona on the beach is pretty good. In terms of hotel facilities, it is indeed a bit old. I originally planned to stay in Wanning for two more days, but I canceled it because of this disappoin**ent. Wanning's activities are moving towards Lingshui. The hotel should further improve its service and have an awareness of repeat customers, rather than motivating service staff to give the hotel good reviews.

The hotel is located in a beautiful place. You can see the sunset, drink good wine, eat good food, and listen to the sound of the waves and lazy Spanish music. It is very healing and relaxing.
When I came to Shenzhou Peninsula, I came across yellow chili sauce on the recommendation of a local. It was paired with Hou'an powder. Wow, it's really delicious.
Thank you very much to the housekeeper Angela (Xiao Tang) for her considerate support. Angela's service is the biggest surprise I received during my stay.
He contacted me enthusiastically before check-in and first provided me with a very detailed set of tips and keywords, such as bus reservations, food recommendations, sightseeing attraction recommendations, etc. Then he shared them quickly after I made my request. It gave me relevant materials and information and saved me time to do guides or searches, which was very nice.
After checking in, I can receive proactive greetings from Angela every day. If there is a need, I will respond promptly and solve the problem. BTW Angela's response speed is really fast. Just after the communication, it takes about 1-2 minutes to get the corresponding reply or further communication.
The hotel's breakfast is generally very good. I order a bowl of Hou'an noodles every morning. It's really delicious.
All in all, thank you Angela for letting me spend a pleasant few days in Shenzhou Peninsula. It was a great trip/vacation for me to relax and have a good rest at Four Points.

You can enjoy the sea breeze, watch the fireworks, and the children play on the swings. It is very leisurely. There is a restaurant next to the hotel. The street is relatively convenient. The hotel butler service is also very considerate. Before check-in, he informed some of the arrangements for eating, drinking and having fun. Although the hotel is not new, the room does not smell any musty smell, so it is still OK.

The most beautiful coastal roads, Internet celebrity lighthouses, sunset bars, and beaches are all so beautiful. It is better than Sanya for a pure vacation. I stayed in a suite at the Four Points Hotel for the first time because I didn’t book it at the Sheraton. It turned out to be more cost-effective. The two hotels share facilities and entertainment. It’s also a short walk from the beach. Of course, if you’re lazy, you can take the shuttle bus between the two hotels. The staff are friendly Very polite and enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Tina (haha, she has the same name as me, fate!) I will come again if I have the opportunity🥰

He also took the initiative to send fruits and Hainan specialties, sent water in the evening, and applied for late check-out. The service is worthy of five stars. Very touched by the good reviews. I like the design of the hotel, the public area is beautiful, and the beach is soft. It's a pity that the wind and waves are very strong and the temperature is low, so you can't tread water. The room is not very big, but it is fully equipped. I especially like the bedding, which is smooth and soft. On the day of check-in, it rained and cooled down, and there were many people in the hotel. I wanted to eat at the Thai restaurant downstairs for dinner, but was told that it would take a long time to serve, so I gave up. Breakfast is really crowded, with queues lasting more than ten minutes during peak hours, and the variety of food is quite complete.
Disadvantages: There are many children and poor sound insulation.

Today's Wanning is relatively pristine, not over-developed, and there aren't too many people. Due to the heavy snow in Beijing, the return trip time was temporarily changed.

Small shortcoming——
1-The hair dryer is a bit old and needs a power supply under the countertop to replace it.
2-Iron machine, feels average. If possible, it is recommended to update it (most tourists who come will bring skirts. Skirts are easy to wrinkle)
3-There are no garbage bags in all rooms, which is an environmental protection standard of the Marriott Group. The hotel can also provide them if needed.
other--
The hotel is very close to the seaside. No matter it is early morning, noon or night, the seaside beach is beautiful. Corona Sunset Bar, very pleasant. It was so pleasant to spend half the night admiring the sea with a glass of wine.
😄Surfing at the beach is also great😎. Although it keeps falling. But challenging new things is also a very brave thing.
Finally, I wish Angela a happy life and all the best.

The sanitation is very clean, the bathroom has a bathtub for taking a bath, the service is very good, fresh fruits and drinks will be delivered, and the housekeeper Angela is very considerate and reminds me of various things. The various parent-child activities in the hotel are also very colorful. If you take your baby to the hotel for a day, the itinerary can be clearly arranged and it will not be boring. In short, I am very satisfied with this trip. I will come back next time if I have the opportunity. It is worth recommending [Happy ]

msg:A butler will add you on WeChat a few days in advance and you can ask for any needs. We will help you book activities.

I feel that if the price is within three to five hundred yuan, I would still make a reservation at the Sheraton next door. All activities in Bigfoot Kingdom must be registered at the front desk of Sheraton Children's Park first. Although the shuttle bus is very convenient, you have to arrive about ten minutes in advance. I think it's still a bit troublesome. After swimming, it’s so convenient to take a shower and go back to the room.

Participated in free activities, including tree climbing, rock climbing, surfing, and paddle board parent-child competitions.

The children enjoyed both tree climbing and rock climbing independently. Surfing is taught half the time, and then the children get on the board to practice a few times, which is very suitable for enlightenment. Let’s explain it to parents and children on paddle boards, and then group them for a pk. I feel like I haven’t experienced enough. The final prize was a carousel, a small train or something like that. Very close to the beach lawn. After the afternoon show, I went to sit down, and then at 18 o'clock there was a bubble party next to it. The kids had a great time. Change clothes in the locker room, and then take the shuttle bus back to Four Points. Of course, you can also walk back directly from the beach, but it was getting late and I wanted to go back, change clothes, and go out to eat. If you have to drive out to eat, you can also walk 1,000 meters. In the commercial street, there are various restaurants to choose from.

There is a beach right outside the hotel, and the sea water is also very blue. The hotel room was also clean and tidy, which allowed us to get enough rest during the trip.

Last time I stayed at the Sheraton next door, the facilities were more advanced, but I prefer the Four Points by Sheraton, which feels more relaxed and more like a vacation. The housekeeper will contact you one-on-one before check-in, and you can make any special requests. The cheapest twin room we stayed in had a bed 1.35 meters wide. The bed could be pushed to the wall and the baby could sleep sideways. The housekeeper also helped provide bed rails, fruits and drinks. In order to give the baby a nap, you can also apply to delay check-out until two o'clock. Thank you very much to my housekeeper Angela Xiaotang. I will come back next time. Four Points by Sheraton is indeed the king of value for money in the Shenzhou Peninsula.

After check-in, she also gave the baby a small gift, a bubble machine and a sand digging tool. The baby was super happy. The room is spacious and bright, with a wide view.

The public area is shared with the Sheraton. There is a 24-hour shuttle bus in the lobby that can go directly to the Sheraton. The indoor and outdoor naughty castles for babies are there. The hotel also has many activities for children. Unfortunately, our child is under four years old and cannot participate. However, the sand, swimming pool, and slides were all so enjoyable that we couldn't move at all. Moreover, it is very close to Lingshui, Sanya, so it is very convenient for parents to check in when traveling. The usual price is beautiful, only a few hundred yuan, which is the best value for money. Already planning to come again next year 😂😂. Thanks again Angela.

The adult surfing instruction is so good that the kids won’t want to leave. All in all, it's great, no matter from the accommodation conditions, the variety of activities, or the butler's service. I will definitely go there again next time. Angela carefully introduced the hotel facilities and activities, and also gave warm reminders about the weather and precautions every day.
The hotel environment is relatively quiet and you can walk to Shenzhou Town for dinner, which is quite convenient. Parking is also very convenient. It is highly recommended. It was a great stay.

msg:It's the off-season, so the price will indeed be much cheaper. It was originally said that it would be the lowest price on Marriott's APP, but in fact Ctrip was cheaper than it, and it also came with a free breakfast. I actually felt a bit pity that I didn’t bring my child here this time. I would have known that I would have skipped class with him.
Because the room was not very tight, I was upgraded to a sea-view suite with two toilets, a walk-in dressing room, a bathtub, a living room, a bedroom and a large balcony. The bed was very comfortable and big, and the whole park was very quiet. I went to bed without completely closing the curtains at night. The refreshing and natural feeling when I woke up the next day was really different.
Before I checked in, the housekeeper Tina added me on WeChat, introduced the entire hotel in great detail, and gave me a map. After checking in, he was very considerate and helped me apply for a small gift, including drinks and snacks. It was really a big deal. I have tried many five-star hotels in Hainan, but this is the first time such a generous one! Thank you! They were always attentive to my needs and made me feel at home.
After I checked in, I was given a piece of fruit, which was too much to finish and I even took it away.
The entire hotel is actually not very large, but although the hotel is small, it is well-equipped with everything you need to play. It is also very close to the Sheraton next door, and the two families can share the large swimming pool there. The swimming pool here is more suitable for children to play. It is relatively shallow and there are several small ones. The swimming pool over there is more suitable for serious swimming, but the deepest one is not very deep, about 1.45 meters, and the shallowest one is 1.25 meters.
There is also a gym here, which is open 24 hours a day and requires a room card. But I feel that there are a little more fixed equipment, and it is a pity that there is no gantry frame and Smith frame.
I want to talk about his breakfast. The Western pastries are relatively average, but the fried rice, fried noodles and vegetables are really good. I feel it is rare to have stir-fried dishes that taste so good. The noodle soup is not particularly outstanding. Compared with my previous Wu Ji Hou An Fen, this one is a bit underwhelming, hahaha~
You can't go down into the sea here because there are undercurrents and it's not very clear due to the season, but it doesn't affect your ability to tread water.

msg:The room was very clean, not humid at all, and the dehumidifier was always on. It rained every day and the breakfast was a little lacking, but the price was really good. The beaches on the Shenzhou Peninsula have moderate waves and are suitable for children to play. Because it was raining, I hardly played around the hotel. When it didn't rain, I went to the beach. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are many sand crab holes. It’s so fun to catch the sea! I would like to thank the housekeeper Angela for giving us fruit drinks. She was very enthusiastic and also gave us sand digging tools for the children. Let's have a great vacation experience. The hotel is generally okay and worthy of the price

msg:Before checking in, I was a little worried after seeing reviews saying that the hotel facilities were relatively old. Who would have thought that after checking in, the room and facilities did not feel old at all, and there was no musty smell in the room like other hotels I stayed in during my trip to Hainan. The elderly and children at home were very satisfied. .
Because it was the rainy season, it rained for two days, so we couldn't participate in outdoor activities, so we took the children to participate in the indoor cookie-making activity, and the children had a lot of fun.
Special mention should be made about the hotel service. Our housekeeper is Angela, a girl with a warm smile, kindness and love. She is responsive to our requests. Knowing that we have two children, she not only helps arrange for the staff to install bed surrounds, but also applies for children. We bought sand digging toys and a check-in gift package, including various other tips and help. Thank you very much to her for making our trip to Wanning extremely enjoyable.

msg:Hainan Wanning Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort Hotel 1
When traveling to Hainan in recent years, I always stayed away from the crowds of Sanya, and this trip to Hainan was no exception. After landing in Sanya, I immediately drove to the beautiful Wanning.
The Shenzhou Peninsula in Wanning is surrounded by the sea on three sides and is an hour and a half drive from Sanya. On this peninsula with an area of ​​only 24 square kilometers, there are only three high-end five-star hotels. This time I chose to stay at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort in Wanning. Staying here can fully enjoy the sun, sea and beach and your own private time [Hotel Location Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort Hotel is adjacent to Wanning Shimei Bay. It only takes ten minutes to drive from Shimei Bay to Shenzhou Peninsula. The hotel is located in Shenzhou Letao Bay on the peninsula is hidden in a tropical garden with coconut breeze and sea charm. The hotel is close to the sea, and the 700-meter-long golden beach is right outside the door.
Coastline, there are nearly 50,000 square meters of golden beach, in the room
You can enjoy the beautiful endless sea view. [Hotel environment
The overall design style of the hotel exudes a strong tropical style, and the lobby design is simple yet elegant. When you first walk into the lobby, you can see the beautiful sea view through the water bar. There is a large tropical rainforest in the hotel. Banana, kapok and other tropical plants decorate the hotel park with lush greenery. There are also autumn dry hammocks in the park, which is very suitable for taking photos and checking in. Finally, thank Yang for the good service of the butler John. The five-star butler responded promptly and was great. I will come again if I have the chance.

Angela, the hotel’s customer service butler, knew that we were taking care of our children and paid special attention to our travel and play. Thank you to the butler for taking care of us~
Wanning is worthy of many lazy vacations. As long as you are not pursuing special forces travel, Wanning Hotel is really a good choice~

The only drawback is that the sunset restaurant and bar are not open during a typhoon, and the lagoon swimming pool is under maintenance and can only go to the Sheraton next door to swim, which is a bit regretful. I will choose this hotel again next time I come to Wanning!

For transportation, you can take a taxi directly at the door to go where you want to go. There is also a small town nearby where you can eat specialties. , the room is quite clean, but it has rained recently, and since it is close to the seaside, the room will be a little damper, and it will be better if the doors and windows are closed. The hotel housekeeper Tina contacted her in advance the day before check-in, and she can ask a series of questions to the housekeeper, who is quite enthusiastic. The only drawback is that there are many people when we go downstairs for breakfast between 9 and 10 in the morning, and there will be a queue. It is recommended to divide the meals.

msg:This hotel is the one with the most beautiful environment during my trip to Hainan, and the one with the highest cost performance.
First of all, the ordinary room I booked accidentally gave me an upgrade to the sea view (I later found out that the special room for Ctrip platinum members can be upgraded for free), and I didn't understand it at the time. I thought it was because the business here in Wanning was not good, but actually I said that I wanted to continue to live, and the service staff said that I couldn't live in the future, and it was already sold out. I also saw that this room type has indeed been sold out on the follow-up platform. So I feel more cost-effective. The room is a suite, a large living room, a large master bedroom, two large balconies, a total of more than 80 square meters. The bathroom is my favorite, with a large sink. The sea view from the balcony is also amazing. Like my youngest son, I really want to stay for a few more days.
The hotel's catering is also good, and it will definitely satisfy our stomachs. It should also be emphasized that the hotel's beach 🏖️ is extremely beautiful, with white and fine sand, and the children left a lot of happy playing videos here.
It is definitely recommended that everyone go to the casa Corona Sunset Restaurant. The a**osphere is right, as if you have come to a Southeast Asian island. I ordered the 368 set meal, except for the Mexican nachos, which cannot be accommodated, everything else is good. I also ordered French fries before the meal (the child was hungry and thought he would hurry up, but it was served after we finished eating), but it was surprisingly delicious, soft and crunchy on the inside and very fragrant on the outside. Got our unanimous praise.
Summary: When you come to Wanning, you must come and experience this hotel, love ❤️

There is a public beach outside, where children play a lot, there are beach motorcycles, etc. There are many small snails in the middle of the mountain and half of the sea. Also because it is public, the sand on the beach is very fine, but it is a bit messy. Walking to the beach washed by the sea is very slow and good.
Children especially like it. Had a great time.

msg:great housing experience
I came to Wanning during the summer vacation in July. I chose Four Points within my budget. I stayed for 3 nights in a row. The overall experience was very good. Let me explain in detail

1. It may be the off-season. The front desk upgraded the room for me, which made us feel very comfortable. The first time I entered the room, I felt very satisfied.
2. Although there are many bad reviews, some details in the room prove that this hotel is not young, but it does not affect my opinion of its good reviews, because everyone will grow old one day, but the location of the Four Points Very good, really a line of sea view! * The price/performance ratio is very good, and the overall quality depends on the budget, Four Points is OK!
3. The facilities in the room are simple, but absolutely sufficient
4. Before check-in, there will be an exclusive butler who will add me on WeChat, allowing me to make reservations for children and parent-child water sports in advance, and broadcast the weather forecast every day. The butler John’s service is very considerate
5. The location, walking downstairs to the beach within 5 minutes is very convenient. The only pity is that the beach is open and there will be some garbage, such as mineral water bottles and cigarette butts
6. The hotel's water facilities are shared with the Sheraton next door, forming a huge one-piece swimming pool, which is great and a dream paradise for children
7. Parent-child and children's water sports are all assembled in the Sheraton lobby. There is a shuttle bus at the entrance of the Four Points, which is very fast and convenient
8. The Thai restaurant downstairs is also delicious, very authentic, and the price is good. If you are not happy to go out to eat, you will not suffer a loss if you choose this restaurant


It is highly recommended that users within the budget can choose here. If I have the opportunity to come to Mannings, I will still choose Four Points with an 80% chance!

msg:Address 🏝️: On the Shenzhou Peninsula, very close to Shenzhou Station, about 30 yuan by taxi, the transportation is very convenient.
Room🏨: The decoration style is more Chinese style, because it has been 10 years, and some facilities are a little bit outdated. I was not very satisfied with the room I arranged for the first time. I told the front desk and immediately arranged another room. The hotel is very big, and it is easy to get lost when walking for the first time. Butler Chen took it twice and it went smoothly.
Breakfast 🍳: The breakfast buffet is in the restaurant next to the front desk. There is a buffet in the morning, and a Thai restaurant at noon and evening. The breakfast is very rich, and it is slightly different every day. There are many kinds of bread, croissants 🥐 and Mrs. Cinnamon Rolls are so delicious. In the fruit section, there are oranges, watermelon, pineapple, mango, lotus mist... There are several kinds of fried food, stir-fried dishes, cold dishes, whole grains, and freshly cooked soup noodles.
Service 💁: The housekeeper Xiao Chen is very responsible and patient. Every time I send a WeChat message, it is almost instant. He will also help to contact the car, remind the weather, and finally send a large bag of Hainan specialties, which are delicious. Give him a thumbs up 👍
Other supporting facilities 🎠: There is a Corona sunset bar on the beach, a Casa Corona western restaurant, and a beach buffet. The environment is super good and the film is super produced. There is also a carousel, the beach and the Sheraton Hotel are shared, other skydiving 🪂 surfing 🏄 beach motorcycles are also available, and there are many swimming pools, which is very suitable for a bad vacation here⛱️

I am very satisfied with the service here. My butler John is so considerate
Introduce interesting places in Wanning to us and book various services of the hotel
He helped us think about everything we didn't expect, very nice
The package also includes paddle boards, surfing experience lessons, and afternoon tea. It feels very fulfilling to be in the hotel. The Corona Bar is very popular. It is definitely a niche place to check in.
The hotel environment is very good. It would be better if the toilet facilities can be separated from wet and dry. The overall experience is very good👍

msg:If you bring the elderly and children to Wanning, you must experience the Sheraton Hotel. It focuses on parent-child, and the environment is good!
The price of the plane ➕ wine booked by Ctrip is very favorable
There are too many things for children, so they can be sent to the hotel in advance. The hotel concierge (the place where the car is picked up at the gate) can help to receive the courier, and can also help to send the courier, which is very convenient
When checking in at the front desk, I will scan the butler’s WeChat. This time my butler is John, who is very responsible. I ask the butler to make appoin**ents for various parent-child activities. The butler will also recommend nearby delicious and fun strategies, and also sent a minibar and a delay Check out, it's really considerate for children taking a nap~
Four Points by Sheraton and Sheraton are two hotels. Sheraton is a little newer, but they are both Marriott hotels. Four Points by Sheraton and Sheraton share children’s activities, beaches, lawns and swimming pools, and there are free shuttle buses between the two hotels, the beach You can also walk over~
Introduce the charging items, the carousel and the small train are 30 per person, and the boating in the reef swimming pool is 68 an hour, the price is very close to the people, and the children are very happy
Both Four Points by Sheraton and Sheraton have bars. The Sunset Bar in Sheraton is more popular on the Internet, and they are all photographed with Kaka. The Sheraton Bar is on the beach, and the price is a little cheaper than Four Points.
Speaking of breakfast, I live in the Four Points by Sheraton. The breakfast is on the second floor. From March to April, the queue starts at 8 o'clock for breakfast. It is recommended that you get up early to eat at 7 o'clock. There are fewer people, and the air in the morning is fresher.
In short, it is a good hotel experience. It is very important to choose the right hotel for the first time to travel with a one-year-old baby and three elderly people.

The price is very affordable! The location of the hotel is very good, and the parking is very convenient! The service of the hotel is very good! It is very similar to some foreign tourist hotels such as Bali before. Before departure, a housekeeper contacted me and added a work WeChat account. You can contact the housekeeper anytime for anything. I really want to thank the housekeeper Tina, the service attitude is very good! People are very nice! Helped me solve many problems. The hotel has its own beach, and the seaside scenery is very good! For the beach, I compared Riyue Bay, Shimei Bay and Shenzhou Peninsula! Four Points by Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula has the finest and most comfortable beach! The hotel environment is great! It is very comfortable to take a walk by the beach after dinner every night! There is an Internet celebrity sunset bar on the beach, it is very pleasant to drink a little wine and enjoy the sea breeze! There are also many places to eat near the hotel, very convenient! The hotel is also very suitable for bringing children! I didn’t bring it this time, I want to bring my baby to experience it next time!

There are also Internet celebrities checking in at Casa Corona. There are quite a lot of people. It is a good choice to take your baby. There are many items. The only downside is that there are too many surfers for children. The children are impatient and have to go to the Sheraton to gather first and then walk to the Four Points swimming pool... It is worth mentioning here that the hotel service is very good, thoughtful and meticulous! I couldn’t get through the customer service calls because of the butler Lion’s help. Thank you very much [强] The room is clean and the bed is very soft and comfortable. This trip was perfect. I am very satisfied with the warm reception and a**osphere of the resort hotel.

It makes people feel very happy. This time I came to Wanning and chose to stay at the Four Points by Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula. It was the most correct decision I made. The price/performance ratio is definitely higher than the Sheraton next door. The only thing that needs to be strengthened is the sound insulation. It is clear that I hope there will be some changes in this aspect next time I come here. Overall, the experience of staying here is good.

The sea view, beach, swimming pool, and environmental services are still as good as ever. It is suitable for parent-child soaking Hotel travel.
The thoughtful service of the butler John is very satisfying. The reply on WeChat is also very fast and patient. If there is any problem, it will be dealt with in the first time. The service is very good, and this time I even gave a welcome drink
After leaving the store, they will send us small gifts, which is really a bit unexpected.
I will come again for the next trip to the seaside. It is considered that the beach hotel in the Shenzhou Peninsula is cost-effective. I have stayed at the Westin, but the price is relatively higher than that of the Sheraton. The distance from the hotel to the beach and the sea is about three minutes. Compared with 21 years, the catering has matured a lot. Generally speaking, it is cost-effective

There are also conversion plugs at the head of the bed. I live here from the Sheraton Sanya Haitang Bay, and there is basically no service. , the room is also very broken. When I arrived at the Four Points by Sheraton Wanning, it was heaven. The price was half that of Sanya. It was so romantic to eat at the beach at night. My parents were very happy.

The hotel customer service Wisten will contact you one day in advance to confirm the check-in status, and then provide customized services during the stay. The hotel's breakfast is also quite rich. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are many choices in the commercial street not far from the peninsula. The beach of the hotel has clear water and white sand, and the coastline is also very long. It is very beautiful to go all the way to the Internet celebrity lighthouse. Although the hotel facilities are slightly outdated, fortunately, they are clean and tidy, and the service response is relatively fast. The fly in the oin**ent, when checking in, the front desk service staff waited for a long time before receiving it. The little brother who delivered the fruit knocked on the door casually, and then drove straight in regardless of whether there was anyone inside. In short, the service is a bit rough, and I hope it can be improved.

msg:Before I came to Wanning, I didn’t do any strategy. I struggled with booking a hotel for a long time. The Four Points by Sheraton is a four-star hotel in Sheraton. At that time, I read many reviews saying that the facilities and equipment were old, so I chose other hotels (the price is the same as Four Points Sheraton is similar), originally we booked for three nights in a row, but when we arrived, we found that the location was far away and the room was too small. Later, we found that the most convenient place was the Sheraton. Food, lodging and scenery are the first choice, so we decided to return it later. For two nights, I booked the Four Points at half the price of the original reservation. When I arrived, I found that it was much better than expected. The room was very large, with complete equipment and facilities, clean and comfortable, and a balcony. The first day of stay Fruits were also given, and the sense of happiness instantly increased. In addition, our exclusive butler, Lion, can give good advice on the hotel and eating and drinking. The service is really good and caring. Breakfast is also provided. Thank you~ In addition, when we returned on the night of the 14th, even the security guy at the door was very nice. He greeted us politely and took the initiative to carry our luggage for us. Thank you for seeing us off.

The breakfast variety is slightly less, but it is no problem to eat well. Breakfast is until 10:30 on weekdays and until 11:00 on weekends, which is still very humane. In short, the price is very high. The winter vacation has passed, and there are really few people. My baby has contracted the entire beach. The beach is not the hotel's private beach, but there are not many people. The beach here is a relatively flat beach in Wanning, suitable for babies to play.

Most of the hotel offers a variety of parent-child games for free. Just book directly with the butler~ I like it so much The bubble bath at sunset, you can watch the beautiful sunset while playing, and the photos are also very good! It is no exaggeration to say that it is the best parent-child hotel in Wanning ~ I had a great time vacationing with my mother and two adults! Ah, and the cinnamon rolls for breakfast are delicious! I ate it for three days in a row! The only fly in the oin**ent is.... It would be better if there is a shuttle bus for the Sheraton on the beaches of Hainan. In the next two days, I will transfer to the Sheraton Haitang Bay. If you don’t drive by yourself, you can either take a cross-city taxi or take a taxi to Wanning High-speed Railway Station-Yalong Bay Station -Take a taxi to Haitang Bay, it's very troublesome....

msg:The location is relatively inward, very quiet, and the room is well soundproofed. At this time, the occupancy rate is not high, so the experience including the swimming pool, dining environment, and beach is considered to be good. The beach is a public area, the sand is very comfortable to walk on, the sunset is beautiful, swings, carousels, lighthouses, and various Internet celebrity photo spots are easy to take pictures. The unexpected harvest is to go to the left along the beach, the exposed coral stones, you can find hermit crabs at your fingertips, and play for a long time. The downside is that the hotel has been around for a long time, the hardware is aging to varying degrees, and the door broke twice. I don't know if it is affected by the occupancy rate, and there are not many breakfast varieties. Finally, I have to thank the housekeeper Tina for her enthusiasm and patience in solving various problems. I hope that when I come next time, I don’t need to do nucleic acid or wear a mask. PS: The booked Four Points by Sheraton should be a Sheraton vacation, which is managed by Sheraton. The Four Points should be under renovation. The guess has not been confirmed. Anyway, eating, drinking and having fun are the same

There is no need to go out to play. A veritable family hotel. The management provided a free upgrade to the sea view room, but the hotel is too big, and it feels far away to walk back to the room. Then because of the project, the check-out exceeded 12 o'clock, and the housekeeper also helped to apply to postpone the check-out until 2 o'clock. There are many experiences to book, and the service is good. It's just that I arrived late at the store on the first day and didn't play successfully. The lack of hardware in the hotel is indeed that there is no place for the shower, and it is showered on the bathtub. And no dinner is provided. have to go out to eat.

After learning that I was with my parents, I also helped to upgrade to a family suite (market price 2350), so lucky! ! ! The room is 105 square meters, and the sea view is superb. I told you in advance that there is renovation in the past few days, but it is not noisy. The service of the hotel is very good. Maybe there are few people in the epidemic. There is no "Hainan Style" in some comments. @安全大哥 understands it very well, and also introduced us to the map and surrounding attractions, thank you. The Marriott Platinum Card chose double breakfast, and the breakfast was very rich. The recent hotel activities are only watching the ball in the lobby bar at night, but the a**osphere in Corona is better. The public facilities of the two Sheratons are shared, but they are closer to the Peninsula Sheraton. It is very suitable for children to come and play, and there are many activities! The two stores have direct shuttle buses. The reference price of beach motorcycles for adults is 200/30 minutes. The nearby restaurants in Singapore have good seafood, good service, and expensive prices. Looking forward to coming back next time!

The room facilities are outdated, the paint on the doors is peeling, the corridors are slippery, and the inside of the cabinet is moldy. The musty smell in the room is so serious that you quit when you enter the room. Their housekeeper (female) and room service staff (male) both said that there is a smell. After changing the room for N times, a full 3 hours of room change records, they barely changed to a small smell s room.
In terms of service, frankly speaking, everyone else is not bad. It could have been rated at least 3 points, but all the fat girls surnamed Han got negative points. Their lobby manager, that fat girl surnamed Han Ya, arrogantly threatened, " Our room has a smell, you can check out." She agreed to give you a solution in 10 minutes, but after 50 minutes, no one was seen, so she had to ask a few interns in the front office to deal with it because of her arrogant attitude. customers are angry.

msg:During the summer vacation, I brought my children to Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula to play and stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel. After booking, Vivi from the hotel called before departure to confirm the relevant matters, and suggested that after entering the island, in addition to the landing inspection within 3 days, you can freely pass through Hainan Island, and also consider the location of the hospital where the nucleic acid is performed. All sent. After check-in also sent welcome fruit. The swimming pool of the hotel is very good, the children are very happy, after staying for 3 days, the children soaked in the pool for 2 and a half days😂 There is an episode in the middle, I was sitting by the pool and was smashed by a coconut baby that fell from the coconut tree The left shoulder is broken. In fact, it is not a big problem, but Vivi is busy arranging a car to take him to the hospital for examination. The hotel is also very responsible, and Vivi is even more thoughtful and considerate. The hotel has a beautiful environment and high cost performance. The panoramic sea view room has beautiful scenery, which is very suitable for parent-child travel and will come again in the future. Finally, thanks to Vivi for making us have a pleasant trip!

There is no separation of dry and wet, you have to stand in the bathtub to wash the bath, and the toiletries are large bottles hanging on the wall. You can share the swimming pool with the Sheraton next door. The advantage is that the environment is really good, the swimming pool is big enough, and the scenery is beautiful enough. There is also a reef beach next to it. When the tide is low, you can take children to the sea and catch many crabs and shells. There is an Internet celebrity bar by the pool where you can taste and punch!

I was also frightened by other people's bad reviews. After I checked in, I found that there was no problem. I can rest assured that I will choose it next time.
The room is big, especially the balcony
The housekeeper Neil is very caring. I stayed for five days and the breakfast is ok. I think it is understandable that if the hotel is full around 10 o'clock in the morning peak, I have to queue for a while and wait for the table to be cleared.
Unlimited mineral water throughout the process is great
It is also very convenient to share all the Sheraton facilities
Children's activities can be arranged without leaving the hotel throughout the day!
Praise!

Compared with the two hotels in Shimei Bay during the summer vacation, the price is half cheaper, but the service is not discounted at all. The family suite we stayed in was large enough and had a good view from the window. Downstairs is the atoll swimming pool, and across the swimming pool is the beach. Sheraton also maintains the beach very well. When you go to the public beach, you will find that there are still many beaches in the Shenzhou Peninsula. Broken shells, but not Sheraton Beach, so don't worry about your feet.

The day before I arrived at Four Points, the caring housekeeper vivi called me to ask about my situation. Knowing that I had children, he specially noted the children's products for me, and then carefully understood my needs and arranged my other activities. . The next morning, he reminded me of breakfast time intimately, which was very heartwarming. Four Points did not disappoint me, the room was very comfortable, although there was no separate shower, but the five-star value was still there, the children had a great time, it was convenient to park and eat, the beach was also good, not many people, it was great! Next time I come to Mannings, I will stay and recommend it. Thanks again to the caring housekeeper vivi.

msg:I have taken my baby to travel destinations many times. The hotel service staff are more patient and ask questions. Compared with before, there is now a hotel butler service, such as surfing, rock climbing, and children's activities. You can make an appoin**ent with the butler. This trip It was raining in the middle of a typhoon, and I thought I would definitely be disappointed. As a result, the hotel arranged a lot of children's activities, including real CS, small chef activities, etc. The customer service vivi also kindly recommended us to check in the mi coffee theme shop, really It is very suitable for traveling with children on rainy days. Generally speaking, the children are very happy, and the parents are relatively relaxed throughout the whole process. The only regret is that they did not play the swimming pool bubbles that the children are longing for, but in general it is still a relatively happy and relaxed vacation .
Old rules, after talking nonsense, say the room:
The room is simply decorated, each room has a balcony, and the room is equipped with a drying rack, which is really considerate.
The breakfast is generally good, with local characteristics, including Western-style breakfast and Chinese-style breakfast such as porridge. In short, you can find a meal that suits your taste.
Finally, there is service. Because Four Points and Sheraton are joint venture hotels, the shuttle battery car is always on call. It is very convenient to participate in activities or take pictures and punch cards in the past. The activity experience is also shared, and the price/performance ratio is not bad.

To sum up, I personally feel that it is a very good experience. Although I have not encountered the cracking of the furniture mentioned in other comments, I will say it. Personally, I think it is because the seaside is very humid, and a little cracking is inevitable. I think it can be tolerated. , but only represent personal opinions, opinions differ.

       The itinerary code registered at the entrance is understandable, the mobile phone is playing, and the face is swiped, and the door is not allowed to enter for a long time. You have to brush your face when you check in. This hotel is the most troublesome for a week around the island. And did not take the initiative to help with luggage🧳.
      Decoration: The decoration of the room is very old, it feels like many years, and there is a door in the room (see picture), which I haven't encountered for many years! There is no shower in the bathroom, you have to take a bath in the bathtub! ! The TV 📺 is very old and cannot be seen at all. Not many TV stations!
      Balcony; balcony sliding door is super heavy and can't be pushed at all! Girls can't go to the balcony at all, they are useless.
      Swimming pool: The swimming pool is only until 6 o'clock in the evening. It is said that after 4 or 5 minutes of walking, I will go to other hotels far away for a swim. I am drunk! ! !

      I didn't go swimming at night, and there was no light in the elevator hall when I returned to the hotel! !

     There is only one breakfast in the double standard room set!
  
The outside environment is shown in the picture. There is no water in the pool, and there are fake flowers in some places!

The beach by the sea is also relatively dirty, and there are a lot of praises and things on the seaside.

   Worst hotel, unsurpassed.

The hotel has rich activities and the children are very happy~ The waiters here are very polite, especially thanks to the room service housekeeper Vivi, who is definitely a benchmark in the service industry! The question is answered almost in seconds, and I am very enthusiastic to provide recommendations. The child is sick these days. She also helps communicate with the restaurant and let me pack porridge back to the guest room (the cafeteria is not allowed to take out). All the children&#39;s entertainment activities, just tell her about her I will make an appoin**ent for you as soon as possible. The activity center will contact you to participate in the past. It is really very relaxing and enjoyable. Because of the child&#39;s health, we stayed for one more night and I want to change to a sea view or seaside room (because the children can&#39;t go out to play Mostly stay in the room) Unfortunately, the room is full. Vivi sister is very enthusiastic to help us upgrade the sea view suite. She said that she wants the children to stay in the room as comfortable and spacious as possible...I am moved again 😭 I must come back next time !

Staying at the Four Points by Sheraton is indeed a good experience, and each hotel has its good and bad. Let me talk about the shortcomings first, that is, parking is very inconvenient. When parking, it is basically robbing a parking space, or relying on luck. The good thing is the service attitude, especially the caring service of the housekeeper is really good. When it comes to this, I have to praise the housekeeper Vivi. She is really caring. She will try her best to satisfy any need, and she will remind you in the morning. You have breakfast and she will remind you of the travel situation, so the overall experience is still good!

     First of all, Xiao Yang, the customer service at the front desk of Four Points Sheraton, is very warm and professional. Because he is driving to Hainan with his 84-year-old mother, he must consider everything in advance. After Xiao Yang from Sheraton understood my situation, he contacted me in advance and gave me a lot of careful and professional guidance. I am very grateful to Xiao Yang for his dedication and enthusiasm for his work.
  Secondly, the location of Four Points by Sheraton is really excellent. 50 meters from the park is the beach. It is not too convenient for an elderly person like me. In addition, there are relatively few people recently. It seems that the whole beach is mine, which is super powerful. Hahaha.
Third, Wanning Seaview is really excellent.
     Finally, I would like to thank Xiao Yang and all the staff of Four Points. I will come to Wanning and Four Points Sheraton in the future.

Check the itinerary code and check the health code when you enter the door. There is also a responsibility letter to sign when you check in. You will not feel troublesome. It is good to be stricter under the epidemic situation, and it is very reassuring.
Sharing facilities with Sheraton, there are many places to take pictures and play, which is very suitable for parent-child travel.
There are many places to eat in the hotel, and you can also go to the Sheraton next door to eat.
The service is very good, there is help with luggage, and there is a shuttle bus to the hospital for guests who want to test nucleic acid. This is good. When checking in, the Wechat of the housekeeper vivi was added, and you can ask any questions.
The hotel facilities are a bit old, the sound insulation is not good, and the voices outside the room can be heard clearly.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I booked the Four Points by Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula, and the room rate of 2,000 per night is really not cheap. When we checked in on the first day, because we waited too long for the room, the hotel even helped us upgrade other room types. The service concept was really in place.

The breakfast buffet in the morning was a little crowded because there were too many people staying during the Spring Festival. All other services and measures are quite good.

The Four Points by Sheraton Hotel and the Sheraton next to it share all the beach and entertainment facilities. They are a few hundred meters away from each other. In fact, it is still a very good choice. The scenery of the hotel on both sides is quite good. Various restaurants, bars and entertainment facilities around the hotel are very suitable for parents and children as well as couples and friends to travel.

There are really not so many people on the beach in Wanning. I went to the Westin and Le Méridien hotels near Shimei Bay this afternoon to see that the beach was crowded with people. Relatively speaking, the environmental facilities of the Sheraton Hotel found a trace of tranquility.

Vivi, the hotel staff, added my WeChat early. Prepared in advance for my entire trip in Wanning. This makes me very moved! Next time I come to Mannings, I will stay at Four Points by Sheraton again!

msg:When I first arrived at Four Points by Sheraton, I thought it was too lively here. The hotel has been around for ten years, and the rooms are a bit outdated, but I am very satisfied with the balcony facing the sea, and each room is also very thoughtful with clothes drying racks.
      The beach in front of the hotel and the surrounding environment gave us a big surprise. The hotel and the Sheraton public facilities next to it have a large private beach swimming pool, surfing, merry-go-round, and swings. My favorite is the sunset bar on the beach in front of the hotel, where drinking beer 🍺 watching the sunset feels great. There are also tent campsites where you can watch a free starry sky theater, so cool!
    I am very satisfied with the hotel butler Neil Yang. After adding our WeChat, he answered our various questions and actively contacted the hotel shuttle and recreation center for us. Thank you.
    But I was very, very dissatisfied with the woman in the recreation center. Originally, the room I booked on Ctrip was a package, and the order clearly stated that it included an adult surfboard experience. As a result, I made an appoin**ent with them through the butler twice, both times. Said to confirm, and finally replied that I did not have this experience, and asked me to confirm with the front desk. After I confirmed with the front desk, I completely missed the time of the experience. Although they called and apologized later, I was still very, very much. I feel unhappy that they are not serious or responsible, shouldn't it be them who confirmed with the front desk?

More importantly, service, service is the soul of the hotel. Thank you very much for the warm greetings from the manager Vivi, who provided warm help from the day before departure, which made me feel at ease to travel with my daughter alone.

🚗 Transportation: Very convenient, you can take a taxi from Shenzhou Station for about 20 minutes

🧹Hygiene: Hygienic details are well done and very environmentally friendly

🍃Environment: I read the comments earlier that the facilities are a bit old, but I don’t think it’s worth the price at all, and it shares the same sea area with the Sheraton next door. All kinds of food and play are in place by the sea, and there is also Corona, an internet celebrity punching card, which is definitely a blockbuster. Great place! value!

🔔Service: Okay, here comes the key point. The service is what made me the most satisfied this time. Sister ViVi, the guest relations manager, made me feel very warm. She took the initiative to contact me before check-in and patiently asked me about my check-in requirements, and the happiest thing was All of them satisfy me! ! ! Bi Xin ♥️ strongly request to add chicken drumsticks to Vivi 🍗 This should be the most satisfying place to stay this time. Now that I am back in smoggy Chengdu, I still think about the sea view room, it is so comfortable.
All in all, a very happy stay experience, I have the opportunity to come back to Mannings!

msg:The hotel's natural environment is very good, and the scenery is excellent. But I arrived at the reception desk of the front office of the hotel on the afternoon of January 9, 2022. A virgin manager wearing glasses received a virgin manager at the front desk, with an indifferent and arrogant attitude, and always kept a straight face during the whole communication process, which made me very uncomfortable. As for the hotel facilities, its architectural design is quite distinctive, and the balcony of the rooms can be described as full of Mediterranean style and strong romanticism. But in a five-star hotel, in winter, the central air conditioner does not heat, which directly caused me to wake up in the early morning with a cold. The central air conditioner controller in the guest room has a heating function, but in fact there is no hot air. I thought Turning on the hot air will raise the room temperature. In fact, the cold air came out, which directly caused me to catch a cold after being woken up. Finally, I hope that the hotel can allow more hotel guests to enjoy quietness, enjoy and feel the beauty and sound of nature in quietness. With these comments, I hope that the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel can do better. This is a hotel with excellent natural environment and infrastructure.

First of all, I fully affirmed the team at the front desk of the hotel. Due to the long waiting time, the service attitude was very friendly and professional. If the room is not full, it will be upgraded to a suite. As pictured, the large balcony is great.

🍃Environment: The external environment is super awesome, and Sheraton shares the seaside, beach, and the famous net red swing, you can check in and take photos of the concave shape, which is very good.
🚗 Transportation: You can walk to the living area, you can eat the old Hou'an noodles shop and Zaobo chicken hot pot.

🧹 Hygiene: Hygiene is also very good, with star hotel standards.
🔔Service: We are strongly dissatisfied with the staff who contacted the staff for follow-up calls. Since I left for the next scenic spot after checking out, I didn't have time to answer the phone, so I would call me again when I agreed, and I will never be contacted again. The sound insulation effect is extremely poor, and the two rooms are not used. I only used one room. Fortunately, no one lived next door to this room, so it was barely quiet. After nightfall, you can hear the next door talking and the sound of the water in the bath, there is no privacy at all.!
The gym facilities are outdated, many equipment will not be replaced if they are broken, and the 24-hour gym is useless.

The hotel is on the Shenzhou Peninsula, with its own private sea area and beach, slightly rounded from the city, but it is very suitable for self-driving friends.
The housekeeper viki carefully helped us arrange various experience activities, free travel filming, children's drama and paddle board experience, and also thoughtfully helped us apply for an extra children's breakfast. There are many kinds of breakfast, and there are special Hainan rice noodles, which are delicious.
It can be said to be the most cost-effective hotel in Mannings. Friends who want to "lie down" must choose this hotel~

msg:1. The coral pool in the hotel is beautiful, but unfortunately it just can't be heated. The water is still too cold this season, the children tremble after swimming for a while.
2. The basic room type is booked on Ctrip, and the front desk will be upgraded to a suite. Although the decoration facilities in the room are a bit old (the room is also equipped with the surround speakers and amplifiers of the awesome Boss about 20 years ago, but it is useless for me. I stayed for 3 nights and I did not turn on the TV once 😛 ), but did not affect the check-in experience. Because the bathroom is large, the toiletries are good, the orientation and bedding are also good, you can see the coral pool and the sea.
3. First booked one night on Ctrip, and then added the hotel's own package. The meals included in the set meal are very good value for money, 2 large and 1 small are enough. And it tastes great. For the first time, the kids ate the fried rice without leaving any grains.
4. The sunset in the hotel is beautiful, and the bar next to it is also very fashionable. Wanning is a place for young people.
5. Finally, there is another feeling. We arrived in Sanya at 1 am. In order to transition, the reservation in Sanya that day is a full season of one night. During the express check-in, the front desk at that time saw me with the children, and immediately handed me the children's toiletries. But after I arrived at Four Points, the next day the cleaning lady cleaned the room and found that there were children, and then prepared children's toiletries and slippers (this is great). But at the time of check-in, the front desk did not consider this issue at all. In fact, I didn't really mind this at the time, because after all I brought it myself. However, I personally think that budget hotels with only one-third of the room rate of Four Points can take into account the needs of guests at the first time. Should 4-star hotels be more like this?

Finally, the overall situation is quite satisfactory. In fact, what attracts customers is not only the new and old facilities, but also the service. I will stay at Four Points by Sheraton in the future. The experience of staying here is very good. Thank you to the hotel staff who can give customers a good stay experience during such a difficult epidemic period.

🧹Hygienic: The sheets and quilts are very clean, all corners of the room are also very comfortable and hygienic, the bathroom and bathroom are separated from dry and wet

🍃Environment: Extra-large swimming pool. It’s not too cold to go swimming at noon this season, because the swimming pool is not the kind of constant temperature. At night, there is a Corona bar on the beach. Drinking a little wine and blowing the sea breeze are particularly pleasant
🚗 Transportation: Basically, we need to go out. We went to Xinglong and ate Nanyang flavor and went to Bali Village. When we came back, we went to Shimei Bay. To be honest, Shimei Bay is not as beautiful as the Shenzhou Peninsula. The sunset here is the most beautiful
Overall evaluation: very suitable for leisure and vacation. Stay in the hotel, because there are no commercial streets around, next time you will bring your children and parents to stay for a few more days

msg:I came here through Xiaohongshu and moved in for 600 yuan. The environment is indeed very good, but there are many places that are very poor, so it is better to live at home. We drove up from Wenchang Wyndham, and came up from the parking lot. We only left a small space for events and we took our luggage. The width is basically 30 cm, which is very inconvenient. You should also consider the feelings of the guests when you host a big event. The check-in started at 2.20. When checking in, the front desk said that the room was still being cleaned and it was necessary to wait 40 minutes at the front desk to check in. But the driving was very hot and I was sweating a lot. I wanted to stay in the shower earlier. So I arranged a connecting room for me (that is, the two rooms have a door and can be locked each other), as shown in the figure, there is no sense of security at all. I found them and asked if they could change the room, and then told me the room would wait for the call. I waited for more than 10 minutes and didn't make a call. After I contacted again, it was more than 3 o'clock before the check-in was completed. The shower in the room has to be standing in the bathtub, which is very tasteless to me. In addition to the concierge to help with the luggage throughout the whole process, the aunt also cleans it very nicely, and the relationship manager is also good. Others are very general. The only remarkable thing is that the outdoor environment is very good. After stepping on the sea at night, there are no street lights in the corridor back, as shown in the picture. The breakfast is only for one person, which is very tasteless. I added another 100 for the breakfast. I think the breakfast tastes very ordinary.

msg:It was a very satisfying trip. I even regretted staying in Sanya for one night. As a Hainanese tourist who has stayed in Haikou for 10 years and stayed in hotels all over the island, this Sheraton is very cost-effective. It is not expensive, but the whole hotel environment is full of atmosphere. I had a lot of fun surfing and paddling every day, and there was also exciting skydiving, which was much more fun than Sanya. The housekeeper Sky who received me was also very enthusiastic. She helped me upgrade to a sea view room for four nights. Thank you very much. I will come here directly for vacation in the future and never go anywhere else. Just can you put some mineral water in the swimming pool for guests to drink? In short, it was a very happy vacation. Friends who are still struggling to decide whether to go to Sanya or Wanning don’t have to go to Sanya, just come here!

During the period, she also recommended some card-in holy places in Wanning. The service is very attentive! I also experienced surfing for the first time in my life on the island, and the evening buffet is also highly recommended~

And the young ladies in the recreation center are so cute that they will take the children to play and they will be warmly received, which is very good. We choose to stay for a few more days later.

I planned to go to the next stop after spending a day in the Shenzhou Peninsula, but I didn't want to go out in the hotel and stayed for another day. There is a Corona Bar in the hotel, a sea swing, an infinity pool, and so on. Just being in the hotel makes me very happy. There are free travel and aerial videos in the hotel. The restaurant clocked in for breakfast and buffet dinner, which is very rich! The service is also super caring. The Miss Long Ye who received us was super gentle and patient. She gave us two guidebooks at the first time. I was super troublesome and troubled her constantly. She was very caring and not too troublesome to help me. One by one, I hope the hotel will see her, her service is really superb!
A perfect day, recommended!

The most important thing is the service. The attitude of the check-in staff is super good, considerate and meticulous. Especially the little girl Long Ye, passionate, professional and meticulous, she is meticulous.
At the Chinese restaurant in the evening, the service staff are also super warm-hearted and professional, and they also help to coax the children. Unfortunately, I forgot my name. I'm sorry.
Check out the luggage moving truck, Yang Gang (the middle character is forgotten) is also very good service, like it!
Finally, the hotel likes it! Service praise! Like the environment!

I was told to go to the Sheraton in front of the car until the car parked and entered the unmanned lobby. It was the check-in that arranged the interns, but I had to tell me where to find the floor. I took the room card and asked me to find it by myself. The impression was too bad, and it was arranged for me on the second floor. Arranged for me to go to the sixth floor. It was not because of these reasons that the appearance was actually satisfactory. The service was really bad and the room was too old and too trendy.

msg:Not happy staying in this hotel.
First of all, the hardware in all aspects can’t keep up. The room is small and the bathroom is smaller. The overall decoration is no different from a better express hotel. It is said that the sea view room has been upgraded, and there is no sea. It is said that the gold card can get 20% off the restaurant. Finally, the waiter said that he didn’t know, no, and no one helped you with your luggage. Several people were watching at the door. The hotel’s swimming pool was also very ordinary. Sheraton did not order the Four Points until it was booked. The negotiation will not be cancelled. The breakfast tastes It's okay, but there are really not many varieties, so I won't live again next time.
No photos were taken at this hotel, they were all from the Sheraton next door!

I have to say that this kind of friendliness has not been experienced in Beijing hotels. As soon as the hotel is out, it is the sea, which is very convenient. You can also play on the small swing and take pictures. Not only that, but also a breakfast, as well as small cakes and red wine! I especially like the balcony in the room. It is very pleasant to have snacks and drinks here at night. I would like to give special praise to Neil, the butler, for his due diligence and answering questions for us. He was very patient. I was very satisfied with this trip to Hainan and experienced full marks!

In fact, I did not choose the wrong one. Absolutely cost-effective, and the breakfast is good. The waiter Li Zhenhong who helped me check in is really at the domestic hotel I have stayed in, and the service is very considerate. Because of the sunset, I couldn't get to the swimming pool, so he opened the door for me. I was stung by sea creatures on the beach and helped me find an online doctor on Meituan. I went to see the lighthouse this morning. I couldn't get back to the hotel at 12 o'clock, and gave me a late check-out. In short, the hotel staff who are very attentive and patient, I am very touched. The hotel's own facilities are okay, there is a gym, there is also a swimming pool, and it shares a beach with the Sheraton next to it. Wanning here left a good impression on me. Thank you Four Points Sheraton for the surprise and fruit. what.

Although the age is a bit long, the basic hygiene is quite good. The hardware facilities are also standard five-star.
Throughout the hotel, you can find a more comfortable location for walking or in a daze. There are also some swings and children's facilities for guests to use.
Marriott Bonvoy members can enjoy discounts on food and beverages, and the service at several restaurants is pretty good.
What's more worthwhile is the hotel's service, which is very caring. Manager Lesley gave me more and more meticulous services when traveling alone.
God is not beautiful, and people feel nostalgic. ❤️❤️❤️

msg:I heard the driver say that Four Points was originally an independent hotel and was acquired and managed by Sheraton and shared the beach with the Sheraton next door. Five-star service, five-star floor area, and outdated facilities. After all, it was renovated early after all. It is not allowed to swim below the sea, but the pool is also very nice by the beach. There are not many beach entertainments. It is suitable for a quiet and leisurely vacation.

🔔Service: Concierge, young lady at the front desk, staff are very good
🚗 Transportation: Wanning check-in places are some distance away from the hotel. It is recommended to drive by car. Taxis are more expensive.
🍃Environment: There is nothing to eat around. There is a simple commercial street by car. It takes two minutes to get there by electric. For guests who like to dine in the hotel, there is a Thai restaurant where you can eat breakfast. The Sheraton next door has a luxury dinner on the beach. Experience to choose food

msg:Two adults and a one-year-old child, this time I booked the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel. Here are a few lessons to sum up. 1. Be sure to choose breakfast for two. Because you can skip breakfast at home, you will definitely eat breakfast when you travel. Breakfast is a buffet. If you buy it separately, it is 100 yuan per person. The breakfast is delicious and rich in variety. 2. Call the hotel in advance to order a baby cot. 3. Parking is free. If you go to Sheraton, there is a free shuttle bus. The shuttle bus is very nice. You will ask you where to take you when you walk on the road. 4. It is best to prepare a sewing kit at the front desk. 5. Thanks to the little brother Neil the most, he contacted us to ask about our needs when he didn't check in, and helped me solve any problems by calling. I carefully prepared fruits for us🍉 and personally took us to the room to help us carry our luggage. Tell us that you can contact him if you have any questions. Every staff member of the hotel is very polite and will greet him on the initiative. The choice of this tour is really the most correct.

msg:Very good experience, because the typhoon does not fly away, the hotel I found temporarily exceeded expectations. It has its own beach and several outdoor swimming pools. The room is on the 6th floor and the balcony can see the sea, except for the surrounding areas. It’s a vacant real estate, there is nothing in it, everything else is pretty good, and the price-performance ratio is relatively high.

msg:The parking lot is free, and you can drive directly to the parking lot when you drive over to drop off your luggage.
This time I came to Sanya and stayed in 3 5-star hotels. There was no doorman to help open the door, and no help with luggage, so I was not motivated enough.
Live on the 4th floor, far from the lobby, but very close to the swimming pool. There was a summer camp for children on the day of check-in. After staying on several floors, the corridor was still very lively at 11 in the evening. There are many hermit crabs and jellyfish on the beach next to the swimming pool, so it’s good to take your kids to play. There will be activities in the swimming pool at 6pm.
Breakfast is so-so, it seems to be 198/person, not worth the price. The restaurant is too far away, and the dinner is called takeaway.
The famous lighthouse is quite far away from the hotel, you can get an overview with a mobile phone zoom in 25 times

Especially the water projects are rich and diverse, the hotel staff is warm and thoughtful, and the work is meticulous. Especially the eldest brother Xu Yuying of the Recreation Depar**ent. After the child participated in the summer camp, he was afraid that I would be bored, so he arranged various interesting activities such as surfing.

The children said this is the most fun beach ; Around you can drop cars, rent cars, and share small motorcycles. The father of the child will ride the motorcycle to the nearby supermarket to buy fruit. I booked for two nights. The hotel housekeeper called to ask about the check-in situation one day in advance. When I learned that there were children, the arrangements were very careful and proper. I prepared the children’s slippers and toiletries, and arranged the room near the elevator. The children’s pool is really convenient to play in the water, and a breakfast is also given as a gift. There is a hotel special car to the high-speed rail station when you leave the store. The hotel driver is also very talkative and introduces local customs. The hotel also gave kids surfing lessons, which they liked very much. There are also travel shooting and paddle board lessons. Thank you very much, the hotel staff’s warm and meticulous service from start to finish, let our family of three have a wonderful time during the parent-child trip. I have made a guide and recommended it to friends and family 😊.

At first, I saw some people's bad reviews and I was a little nervous, but the check-in experience was really much higher than expected. The night before the extra stay, I received a call from Neil, the relationship manager of Four Points Sheraton, asking if I needed anything. I also added WeChat. If I have any questions after staying for two days, I will reply to my WeChat hotel in seconds. The breakfast was delivered within 5 minutes. The hotel facilities are not as old as others say, and the seaside is beautiful and comfortable~ If I come to the Shenzhou Peninsula in the future, I will stay here~

However, during the off-season, the price is very high and it shares the facilities with the Sheraton next door. The main attractions are all in Sheraton. It is very convenient to have a shuttle bus. The soundproofing of the hotel is a bit bad. The hotel provides free mineral water. You can pick it up at the concierge at any time. For dinner, in addition to the Haitian buffet at the hotel’s beach, you can also go to Mr. Pan at the entrance of the resort and take a taxi for 15 yuan. Per capita consumption is 220. The hotel can order takeaway. This is not bad.

msg:Overall, the beaches in Wanning are much better than those in Sanya. You can swim in the sea after leaving the beach in the hotel area, but I don't quite understand why swimming in the sea is forbidden on the beaches in most hotel areas.
The service is good, the breakfast is plentiful, the swimming pool is okay, and you can also use the Sheraton swimming pool next door. There are a lot of food nearby, and the local seafood is still delicious!
The environment of the hotel is good, but the bathroom is a little bit old and very good overall. I recommend this hotel, suitable for couples or a family to spend a holiday. There are not many people on the beach and around the hotel.

It is recommended to ride a motorcycle on the beach at low tide to the lighthouse for half an hour. (The owner of the desert motorcycle also runs the padi dive shop business, fd two dives all-inclusive price 880)
The waiters are amazing. I also encountered the situation that other guests said that the furniture door panel in the room fell down, and it was not a big problem. I am not very demanding.
It takes about 2 hours to rent a car directly from Haikou, which is very convenient. The food and beverages in the hotel are also good, I did not go out to eat. Before eight o'clock, go out for a stroll in the sun, come out to the hotel for dinner, stroll on the beach in the evening and go swimming in the Sheraton.
On the whole, it is a very cost-effective way to live a pig.

msg:This is the first handwritten review and the first negative review since I signed up for Ctrip for so long. The reasons for the negative review are as follows:
1) The door to the terrace of the room cannot be closed, call the front desk and no one will repair it; walk to the front desk to tell them that no one will repair it after more than an hour after eating: call the front desk again and say someone will fix it soon Otherwise, I asked for a room change, and finally came to repair it (picture 3 is the broken balcony door)
2) There is no spray, only the hand-held shower. The holder of the hand-held shower is loose. The shower will fall down when it is placed on it and the shower cannot stand upright. It may happen that the shower will suddenly drop in the middle of the bath and only hold the shower. Situation (the first video is a shower that cannot be hung up)
3) Only the shaver can be plugged in in the bathroom, and the other plug is a furnishing. I asked the front desk that all the rooms are furnishings, so the hair dryer can’t be used in the bathroom. You have to use it in the room (Video 2 is furnishings). Toilet plug used)
4) The soundproofing is messy, people outside the door can hear everything walking and talking clearly, and the movement in the next room upstairs can be heard clearly.
5) There is no air-conditioning in the lobby. Please contact Ctrip for help. The answer is that the air-conditioning is not turned on because of the sea breeze. It is really hot enough to suffocate. However, there are only two or three people who check in and check out.
6) The cabinet door under the TV is broken and cannot be closed (Picture 45)
7) The hotel lobby is being renovated, and the building materials are piled up in the lobby, the sound is very harsh (Figure 6-7)

In addition, the room may be connected to the room

After getting in touch with Ctrip, because we don’t want to change the room too much trouble, the hotel’s compensation is to delay the check-out after 2 o’clock, which is of no use to us, because we left for Lingshui at about 10 in the morning, which was still given by Ctrip. The compensation is satisfactory, but this is also Ctrip's compensation has nothing to do with the hotel, thank you Ctrip.

In summary, this hotel is old and broken. I'm sorry for the Sheraton brand, and I'm sorry for the person who spent money. It can be said to be terrible. Come to Wanning to suggest lightning protection.

I feel at home. Thank you to my handsome butler. Many things have been coordinated for me. It feels very warm when you come in, and it feels like home. The room brought the children, made decorations, and gave the children dolls. Adults and children are really comfortable, the weather is good, the beach has a stage, and there is a music festival

msg:Stayed for 3 nights in June. The reason for my choice was that I fancy the beaches of the Shenzhou Peninsula and the Four Points pools, but did not choose the Sheraton next door, because the Sheraton has only one T-shaped swimming pool. However, I realized that the Four Points pool is more suitable for children. It is open until 19:00, and the Sheraton T Pool is open until 22:00 in the evening. This is not important. The important thing is that the interior decoration of Four Points is basically the same as normal and fast, not as good as the pictures. The most important thing started. From the time I got the room card, I swiped the door many times. The door was difficult to open. It turned out that a screw on the door tongue was loose. Well, I want to try the safety door latch when I enter the door. The safety hook of the door is also missing the lower screw, which loses the function of the safety lock. When I walked into the room, I felt very missing at the floor lamp. It turned out that there was a lack of decorative painting on the wall, or the child found that there were exposed screws on the wall, which was unacceptable. As a parent-child hotel, this is very unsafe, isn’t it? Talked. The language of the TV remote control is attached to the lower left corner of the TV to get it remotely. Okay, maybe I won the lottery. With so many questions, I suspect that I am not staying in a hotel managed by Sheraton. The key point is that the front desk responded casually from the check-in + signed a similar public beach exemption regulation, which was the first time I encountered it. The most disgusting and unacceptable thing is that when taking a shower on the first day of the night, the shower can't be fixed because the fixing screws are also missing. It can be used after repairing, but but! ! On the first night, when I came back from a shower with my daughter outside, I applied shampoo and stopped the water! ~~~ The water has stopped! ~~ It’s impossible for the repairman to come in for repairs. The girl is taking a bath, so she can only let the old public basin catch the water and wash away the foam. The answer from the housekeeping depar**ent is just to change the room. Want to know how much luggage is dragging the child out? ! In short it is too bad, will never stay. Summary: The reception in the lobby is chaotic, and the attitude is so disorderly; the room facilities are old, damaged in many places, and the soundproofing is extremely poor; the breakfast is chaotic, and the butter is a lump, understand, there are bugs in the vegetable salad, and the coffee machine prompts to change the filter It is clean and the water is cut off; the Four Points pool is only open until 19:00, and the pool road is closed at night; the Sheraton pool staff will also tell you to return the used towels, not that they should be used up and placed on the loungers by the pool. It's on the side. Anyway, those who choose Four Points carefully consider it, and so far I haven't gotten an explanation from the hotel! ! !

msg:這次出行選擇了萬寧，我們住的是福朋喜來登，和隔壁的喜來登度假酒店是複合式酒店，除了吃住不一起，其他設施共用，性價比高。兩家酒店的泳池都是室外的，連着海邊，非常適合中午時候過去游泳。不過福朋泳池晚上六點就關了，有點失望，但也可以去旁邊的T型泳池遊玩（晚上十點關）。可以直接走過去大概五分鐘這樣或者去大堂門口坐擺渡車過去也挺方便的。
            酒店客房很多，如果不介意走路的話可以讓前台給你們選後麪的房間。雖然距離前台和餐廳比較遠，但去泳池和海邊真的超級方便，也相對安靜，推薦睡眠淺的人住尾部的房間。最後還是感謝管家小陳John的認真熱情服務，給我們推薦了好多的周邊設施，讓我們不用再費心去做攻略 也解決了不少問題。

設施對比現在新開的唯一少的，就是電視配套啦。
好在酒店環境好，游泳池，海灘，坐在大堂可以吹一天海風發呆。海灘上有三個bar ，下午看日落，晚上喝酒吹海風都很棒。
餐廳一如既往沒啥好吃的，法棍啥的建議不會做，就網購買個能吃的也行。粉煮得也隨意。感覺每次來，餐廳服務都是最糟心的。
這次入住最滿意的是管家服務，don管家服務超級好，全程很貼心，有啥都給處理，下次再來～～

不得不説的是沙灘，隔壁就是日落吧，屬於是比較紅的打卡點，現在淡季人沒有超級多，沙灘很漂亮，傍晚去看夕陽超級漂亮!比較安靜，不住酒店也是開放的。另外就是酒店的雙早,品種豐富。還有管家Ella細心熱情，送了水果還推薦周邊美食，幫忙預約旅拍等，點個贊~

早餐也不錯啊!窗外風景正好，因為福朋喜來登，讓我喜歡上了萬寧~以後過來玩的時候還要住這裏~~

吃食:酒店這邊的餐廳很多，泰餐廳，西餐廳，還有中餐廳，（以我個人的口味，我更喜歡泰餐廳多一些，咖喱雞超級好吃！下次來還吃），然後附近還有阿拉莫納小鎮，吃的椰子還有糟粕醋什麼的應有盡有！附近竟然還開了瑞幸！愛死！

設施：很喜歡健身房啦健身的器械很齊全了環境也很好 通風也很好跑步的時候

衞生:房間的結構非常的簡潔，房間衞生很ok的了景觀也很好沒什麼毛病服務：從禮賓到前台服務都很好小哥哥也會幫你拿行李，前台kelley小姐姐也會很温柔熱情，服務非常好，人美心善服務巨好，有問題都會及時處理和解決!

建議:房間的設施設備確實是比較舊了，還有隔音問題，樓道打掃的聲音在房間聽一清二楚，房間的浴缸已經過時了，建議換成乾濕分離的房間。
（這個五分完全是給Kelley小姐姐的！！！）

每到傍晚時分，酒店沙灘上的日落餐廳便開始無限量供應各種自助海鮮和各地美食，旁邊的日落巴士有出售酒店聯名款的雪糕，拍照打卡必備。潮起潮落，椰樹隨風舞動，夜晚的沙灘上慵懶靜謐，伴着迷人的月色和海浪聲，獨享屬於自己的海島時光 還有很貼心的管家John小陳 服務特別好 在住幫忙解決了不少問題 
酒店外面就是卡薩羅娜拍照美美的。

msg:房間設施：
海邊的房間不潮濕代表除濕做得還可以，床品乾燥。設施尚可。

環境：
福朋旁邊是喜來登，兩家都屬於喜達屋集團所以很多設施公用。喜來登景觀好很多且大堂開闊可以看海，另外泳池標準適合成年人，而福朋的基本都是0.9米的小童池，福朋衹是好在總體性價比高。
晚上喜來登有駐唱歌手在海邊餐廳唱歌，氛圍還不錯。

服務：福朋服務是最好的一項，酒店管家小陳盡心盡力，前台也很有禮貌。酒店設施其實衹能4.7，多出來的0.3是給服務的。希望繼續保持良好的服務。

餐食：
房間二維碼可以點餐，酒店有個泰餐廳有送餐的客房服務。海灘上那個酒吧的餐食性價比不高，於是在旁邊的喜來登吃飯，口味還可以，就是出餐比較慢。

早餐在這個價位裏還是不錯的。

離網紅燈塔就10分鐘，可以坐電瓶車或騎三輪車直接到燈塔下面，燈塔旁邊有個商業美食街，超多好吃的。
管家Angela小唐是個非常能幹有愛心的小姐姐，任何事情都能解決，每天的親子活動也安排妥妥的。因為晚上不小心腳崴了，小唐忙前忙後幫我送葯安排司機送我去萬寧市區的醫院，還幫我給小孩洗澡穿衣服。每天都要問侯我的傷情。真的是我住過服務最好的酒店。
設施：無邊泳池，沙灘
環境：海景漂亮
潮玩小童泳池泡泡趴:每天17:30開始
潮玩小童樹攀體驗:小童攀巖、叢林穿越、沖浪學習

設施：雖然有些年頭但是衞生條件還算是合格的。帶娃的有小童樂園和各種康樂活動可以選擇參加。
衞生：還不錯，房間裏打掃的比較乾淨。
環境：酒店除了房間，其他公共設施沙灘泳池小童樂園等和喜來登是共用的，所以選福朋比較有性價比。
服務：管家Ella是個温柔又漂亮的小妹妹，入住期間很貼心的安排和服務，是此次入住的最大亮點，遇到的各種問題都給妥善解決了。

房間內設施略舊，但很乾凈。
酒店內所有的服務人員都非常有禮貌，特別要點贊管家John在入住前給我們發送酒店具體定位，活動安排表等，到酒店送了歡迎水果，一直温馨關懷，有問題發消息立馬迴應和幫忙解決，飲用水不夠及時給我們申請，房間裏景色也很好 管家John貼心的幫忙申請了延遲退房 非常棒

優勢是確實很方便，出去就是沙灘，看海很方便。管家Angela人很好，回覆及時，前一天就主動給我聯繫發了很多小tips，酒店有配套的小童項目，由於天氣原因衹參加了一個，但小朋友還是很開心。
免費的旅拍也拍的不錯，也不用額外付費，家人很滿意。吃飯需要稍微走點路，蠻適合親子出遊，神州半島還是很適合吃住玩，如果比較性價比的選擇就是選這家，下次有機會多住兩天。

衞生：衞生整體還是可以的
環境：雖然交通不便，酒店出來就是沙灘，沙子細膩水質也不錯，也有各種常見娛樂項目，摩託艇、沖浪、降落傘等等，玩兒的很方便，人流不算擁擠，適合原地擺爛，剛好是過年期間，沙灘上有很多燃放煙花鞭炮留下的垃圾，希望大家愛護環境吧
餐飲：説實話我覺得酒店餐廳一般，沿着鳳凰路向西2km左右到神州半島核心景區有很多大小飯店，飲食不至於不方便，但是個人覺得萬寧景區真是美食荒漠，大家見仁見智吧
服務：有賓客關係管家Ella小姐姐從入住前就開始全程陪伴，比較貼心，每天問候和詢問是否需要幫助，幫忙協調換房間，給小朋友送了挖沙工具和水果，得知有大人着涼還特意送了紅糖薑茶，幾次碰到問題都積極幫忙解決，免除了旅途中很多困擾，非常感謝！

如果能夠增加神州高鐵站到酒店的接駁車就更完美了，可以期待

不過酒店開得比較久了，電視機老舊，像素原始，該換了。房間天花板的煙感報警器關燈後會閃，可以聯繫前台解決。
整體神州半島出行不太方便，如果衹是玩沖浪，非常推薦福朋喜來登，樓下就是沖浪店，沖完直接回房間收拾，其他水上娛樂也很豐富
一般酒店都會靠近沙灘，離餐館比較多的神州小鎮比較遠，需要走路或等比較久的接駁班車，可以自己去租小電車，但春節期間堵車蠻嚴重的

房間的設施雖然一般，但好在面積不小。酒店的泳池、健身房和外部設施是與喜來登共用的。傳説中的科羅娜酒吧和SealineBar就在福朋的沙難上，酒店大堂走出去就是
的確是看日落的絕佳地，我個人喜歡Sealine超過科羅娜。
新手想要體驗沖浪的話，酒店沙灘上就有,人也不會像日月灣那麼多。酒店院子裏就可以租小摩託，步行走出去不到10分鐘就是美食街。
管家Ella 服務也很熱情，樂於提供各種幫助,早餐豐富。性價比不錯，下次還要入住。

酒店位置很好，出門就是海灘，萬寧神州半島的海灘我覺得比亞龍灣、海棠灣、親水灣、香水灣舒服，要是中海能像亞龍灣海灘上多放幾張沙灘椅和太陽傘，那就更完美了。
酒店管家小陳服務也很好。我是自駕的，提前一天加微信，發酒店定位，酒店服務指南；主動幫忙申請延期退房。
硬件雖舊，軟件來湊，總體感覺很好，等今年裝修升級後有機會再體驗！

第二晚，換房換到陰面，真的是一絲陽光曬不到，晚上依舊被對面房間的聲音吵的不能睡，等不及工作人員，自己去敲門打招呼。然後這個房間牆體太單薄，隔壁沖淋、洗澡聽得一清二楚，而且一直到凌晨，奔潰！（就是我換了一個房間，情況更差了：不僅沒陽光，還能聽到隔壁的聲音；同時對面房間的吵聲也沒少）
因此十分不推薦睡眠不好的訂這家，我還把對面房間的視頻發給管家，由於有小孩在視頻中，就不發這裏了
此外，泳池還有小童活動還可以，不介意晚上噪音的可以嘗試一下這家酒店

現在晚上很多人在海灘邊放煙花，酒吧店也挺熱鬧的！

所以我對酒店其他方面並沒有太多奢求。可沒想到酒店卻給了我特別多驚喜。管家Angela在入住前就主動聯繫我，溝通抵達時間。保證了我們很順滑地提前入住。並且她還為我們準備了一大份歡迎禮物，家人都很驚喜。之後晚餐、早餐、退房、離店，每個環節她都會提前發訊息給我提醒，特別貼心。其他員工也都熱情周到，禮賓、餐飲、前台員工都很不錯。特別是客房服務的大姐，按照我們的要求準備床品，並且在知道我家長者需要多喝水後，直接送來了半箱礦泉水，讓我們在降温的日子裏，倍感温暖。

服務：酒店員工都很棒，親切熱情，全程微笑，包括客房部工作人員都會主動問好。管家Jhon也是認真負責，入住和離店均有照顧。每日都會問候提醒。
入住期間還可以報名參加喜來登活動，活動也會受天氣影響取消或者另行安排。福朋與喜來登相連，接駁車2分鐘，步行估計也就8分鐘左右。套餐中有一個小童冬令營，給我的答覆是參加的就我們家一個小朋友所以要取消或者換成別的活動，最後我們沒有參加也沒有選擇別的活動。

喜來登沙灘有個落日酒吧 傍晚的時候很美 拍照的人多 是消失的她取景地 福朋泳池旁邊也有餐廳 菜品不錯 
沿着沙灘走 過了福朋有個最美公路 再往前200米左右能到燈塔 📷 我們借了電瓶車開過去吹着海風很愉快
房間設施：不錯 老酒店算很可以了
位置交通：適合租車🚗
服務：管家john的服務超級好 還沒入住之前就已早早聯繫好 安排房間 到的比較晚John也是一直給我房間保留着到晚上 有需要都可以聯繫 而且不厭其煩 不管早晚回覆都很及時 還送了水果 伴手禮 很貼心 讓我在住期間便捷了許多
早餐：還可以 有很多種選擇 可以挑自己喜歡吃的 自助餐 神舟半島有商業區好吃的也不少🍰度假的好選擇👍🏻

其實在房間裏呆的時間不長，一直在外面玩。孩子參加酒店的親子活動。活動很豐富，孩子超開心，還在活動中交了好朋友。
兩個希爾頓共用沙灘和公共區域，顯得面積好大沙灘大、泳池也好幾個。玩了兩天還常玩常新。
親子活動的教練小哥哥小姐姐也都特別好，每項活動都超級耐心跟小朋友互動，小朋友害怕的時候温柔鼓勵。我沒記住他們的名字，真是非常感謝。
酒店和配套公共活動太豐富了，每個房間配一個管家很有必要。感謝John的熱情服務實時響應，一家人都很盡興。非常感謝。
還有好多適合拍照凹造型的地方，我們根本沒時間全玩完。還有超美的日落。
這個酒店住兩晚不夠玩。下次要住三晚。

酒店有管家服務很貼心，有什麼問題可以隨時諮詢管家很方便，管家Don很有耐心，推薦玩的地方，提前發天氣預報提醒
房間設施偏舊，但是勝在位置好，周圍景點設施不錯，附近也有吃的，超市很齊全，人不算多，比較清爽，總體來説性價比是拉滿的！下次還會再來，再説一下這裏沖浪是真的方便！浪不算大也比較適合新手！

管家John的服務真是非常非常的好，非常感謝他。沒來之前就提問有沒有什麼需求，提前給媽媽安排了硬的床墊，以及暖氣片。也贈送了飲料和零食。他總是會提前發現我們的需要。有問題隨時聯繫，都是以最快的時間去幫忙解決，很暖心。入住的最佳體驗是John給的。真的很貼心，下次有機會還會回來的。

1️⃣入住體驗：神州半島作為我們旅行的最後一站，是臨時決定訂房的，第一次入駐喜來登酒店，管家幫忙升級的房型，剛入住就有送歡迎🍉水果和🥤飲料，每天提醒我們天氣，以及細心告知我們遊玩注意事項；以後來都會選擇直接入住喜來登！
2️⃣酒店位置：酒店的位置特別好，房間都是可以看到海的，而且特別寬敞，酒店後門出來就是海灘；可以直接玩各種水上項目、還有網紅燈塔打卡，很喜歡酒店的落日酒吧氛圍；
3️⃣酒店本身也提供了非常多免費項目，包括游泳池🏊、部分親子項目很適合帶小孩來；
最後還是感謝管家John帶來美好的入住體驗，我們下次再見👋

msg:入住前酒店就聯繫升級到了隔壁喜來登度假酒店，管家John小陳提前聯繫溝通了入住事宜。整體比較滿意，景色很好靠近海邊，配套設施較齊全。酒店內的科羅娜酒吧很安靜，在酒店沙灘上，從客房步行五分鐘的距離。美中不足就是沙灘不夠私密，很多摩託艇教練拉客，影響酒店沙灘海邊體驗度。

msg:第二次來萬寧啦
這次選擇了神州半島喜來登整體感覺很不錯
房間
房間不算很大，設施比較齊全，有點老舊但很乾凈，這次選擇了親子房，在酒店一樓有獨立小院子，直通海邊，對帶小朋友出遊家庭真的很友好!
環境
酒店比較私密，非住宿進不來，前面的沙灘人也不多，看到有人在沖浪多，沙灘上的小酒館也很出片!小童玩樂設施一般，不是很多但夠用了，畢竟他們衹想挖沙子。
餐食
酒店早餐品類還算可以，味道不錯。周邊開車5分鐘就是商業中心，餐廳很多，有一條馬路兩側都是水果批發攤，價格實惠，芒果超好吃。

在萬寧度過了超級chill的兩天，雖然下着小雨，有點點冷，在酒店躺着浪費時間也很快樂，太愛萬寧啦!還要特別表揚我的管家John人真的很熱情 送了挖沙工具跟水果 還全程送房間各種講解 真的很貼心 還有帶小童户外活動的教練小哥 有耐心很歡樂 下次還會再來

最讓我感動的是我同行的小夥伴落地後就不舒服到晚上發燒了，那時候已經23點多了，我這邊協調第二天提前退房後管家立馬微信來找我了，噓寒問暖，還協助我幫忙辦理退房退款手續，還很貼心的問我小夥伴情況，真的很值得了。

就是過去的幾天天氣不好，下次待天氣好時再光顧 呢～
