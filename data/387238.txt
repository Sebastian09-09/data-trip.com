msg:5 star hotel in excellent location. Great service. Polite and helpful staff. Excellent buffet breakfast selection. Very spacious rooms  clean and with full amenities.  We were given a room upgrade upon check in and that was great. I loved the breakfast which had both western and local food. Location is great. Just next road to Nanjing Road, the long pedestrian street line with shops all the way to the Bund. Health centre offers reasonable priced massages, great after loads of walking. Great value, we enjoyed our stay here.

The room is great, the foods are good and the service is impeccable.
The housekeeping lady, Lydia is very helpful, accomodating, proffessional in her work and always smiling.
A great hotel to stay, will definately recommend to my family and friends when they come to Shanghai

msg:Unfortunately my stay here was mediocre at best. At first, the hotel is a bit dated for the price point set. The rooms and the washrooms clearly show their age. Although the rooms are clean, I found a couple of hairs on the linen and my towels. However, these flaws can be justified by the hotels location which is very close to the Bund and the Nanjin Street. I could also see the TV tower from my window after opening it.

Room is spacious and clean although the decor is a bit old-fashioned.

Service is good and professional, very helpful as well

Highly recommend as a city hotel

When you inform time for breakfast you need to have all foods and charge it until the last minute .

msg:The location of this hotel is definitely a plus point. We are just a stone throw away from Nanjing Buxing Road. Love how convenient it is for us. 

There‚Äôs this really good bao shop located near the hotel too. And we missed it so much! 
Direction: Exit from the hotel main entrance, turn right. Follow the walking path. Along the way, you could grab a cuppa but do note that the cafe don‚Äôt accept cash, strictly by e-payment only. You‚Äôll see the yellow signage (the Bao shop!) when you reach a cross junction. Just to be sure, Nanjing Buxing Rd is right across the street. ‚ò∫Ô∏è 

The hotel‚Äôs buffet breakfast spread was great too!

Apart from all of these, the only thing that we were disappointed in was the front desk staffs. They were pretty snobbish and ignorant. The hospitality were not up to par with how great the hotel was. 

Amenities wise, do note that you have to pick it up from the front desk. Toothbrush/toothpaste set, vanity necessities (comb etc) have to be requested.

The hotel was very clean, the rooms were beautiful too. It's an older hotel, so the decor is more traditional and is showing some very minor signs of age. We were very comfortable throughout and made use of the lovely indoor swimming pool too.

The porter was very helpful. However, the check-in staff was not that nice. He shouted back to me once I asked why the hotel needed to charge 1,300 RMB. He angrily responded to me that we have to pay as the deposit. I think he should have a better way of communication as this is the reception of the hotel and he could communicate English. In addition, there was no deposit receipt provided. 

This is very unsatisfied.

The facilities are pretty decent, with an indoor swimming pool and gym. But there is only 1 thing to complain about, as this is a very established hotel, the room might look a bit old and unfortunately my room aircon was quite warm and I can't really feel the aircon on days where the weather is warm. I guess it really depends on the room you get. But overall, I would say it's a nice and luxury hotel and just to note that it will also request a refundable deposit of 500rmb per night.

I put signs for Do not disturb, and they put note under the door what I should if I need some service. It was very kind. I called the housekeeping for new towel, and they speak English and brought what I asked for right away. Compare to the price room was very spacious and I loved it.

I had a massage which was okay but not as good as the one that get locally for half the price. Food was lovely although expensive.

It is very convenient for eating, drinking and shopping. Everything else is unsatisfactory. The hotel's wifi is extremely slow. The cleaning lady seems to be working hard. But the room is not vacuumed every day, so don't turn on the air conditioner. Dust particles everywhere in the room will be ****** into the throat. , it is better to open the window. Moreover, this is a state-owned enterprise, and the security guards have the final say in everything in the hotel lobby, and the security guards feel very good about themselves.

There was a sign on the water saying "add water for 10 yuan a bottle". The first thing I felt was that it was really embarrassing! When checking out, they didn't check clearly and thought we had eaten their snacks. They deducted it from the deposit without asking. We called long distance to ask and were told that they had to verify the situation. Then no one responded to us and waited for us again. I called long-distance to ask and was told that the money would be refunded in two or three days, but there was no news for 4 days. I called again today and was told that the money would be refunded as soon as possible, but they did not give a specific time!

Walk straight out of the hotel on Jiujiang Road for a few hundred meters and you will find the Bund in about fifteen minutes. 2. The hotel lobby is very beautiful, with a circular and empty ceiling design. It feels like an old-fashioned five-star hotel. 3. The hotel room is okay, the bed is relatively comfortable, and the bathroom is well separated from wet and dry. The bathtub is neither big nor small. Some hotel bathtubs are too big and waste water. 4. A plate of pecans, pistachios, and white rabbit toffee was given.
 Disadvantages: 1. Only two bottles of water are free, and each subsequent bottle costs ten yuan. 2. Toothbrushes, combs, and razors do not need to be collected from the front desk or delivered to the room.
Others: There is a queue to eat breakfast. At almost ten o'clock, there are about seven or eight people in front of you. The place where I had breakfast was quite crowded. But there is someone to take the place, so you don't need to find a place by yourself, and it is very orderly.

Hygiene: There is nothing to say about hygiene, it is very clean and hygienic, and the dry and wet bathrooms are very good. There are too few sockets in the hotel, so you have to wait for charging. The facilities are updated too slowly.
Environment: The lobby is very grand
Service: The service staff are very enthusiastic. When they see the doorman approaching from a distance, they quickly open the door. Every staff member they meet greets them warmly. The room service staff are really enthusiastic. They say hello with a smile and take the initiative to ask if they need anything. It's very nice. kind.
The only thing that makes me feel bad is the breakfast. There are too few varieties and less vegetables. I just want boiled vegetables. The fried chicken and potatoes look so rotten that I lose my appetite. The desserts look okay and the fruits are fresh. Rich, I booked a room with breakfast for two people with two children, one older and one younger. It was only 140 yuan more than the room without breakfast. My seven-year-old daughter went to eat at half price of 90 yuan. It's more expensive than adults. It's really unacceptable. I've been to other five-star hotels and I've never charged them. I think this rule can be changed slightly, at least it should not be charged half the original adult price.
The above is a very fair comment, I hope the hotel can take it seriously

msg:It's on Jiujiang Road, 100 meters away from Exit 4 of Nanjing East Road Subway. It‚Äôs so convenient to go shopping at the Bund, Nanjing‚Äôs No. 1 food mall. The main thing is that the hotel room is very large, the bathroom has a bathtub and the wet and dry parts are separated, making the stay very comfortable. Although the hotel is old, it is still well maintained and the hygiene is very goodüëçThe decoration style is the old Shanghai style of reveling in wealth and wealth. It is an old five-star brand with high cost performance. I will definitely come back next time.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings first:
1. The pillow is too high and too soft, and it will sink completely as soon as you sleep on it. It is recommended to change it to a harder one, which has both soft and hard ones, so that guests have a choice.
2. The mattress is also a little soft, and my waist can‚Äôt stand it after sleeping for a long time. I don‚Äôt like it very much.
3. There are too few sockets. There is only one socket at the bedside, and you have to remove the lamp plug to use it.
4. The most criticized thing is breakfast! It's not rich enough and falls short of the 5-star standard, but the quality of the desserts and fruits is very good. The most important thing is that children under 1.4 meters are charged half price. How much is half price? 90.80 yuan! ! ! Yes, right to the corner. This is the first time I have encountered a charge for breakfast for children, and the charge is so high. Children aged 7-8 can eat some food, and the charge is understandable, but how much can they eat? I think charging forty or fifty is acceptable, but charging 90 is too much. Your breakfast is worth 180, don‚Äôt you know? Even if it has a 5-star rating, your breakfast is half worth 180, so why can't you give a discount to the little guests staying? I also make money on the room fee and breakfast fee. This is really like no one else! So I saw a lot of mothers taking their children to eat, and I guess the father was just sitting in his room starving.
Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages: It can be seen from the decoration style. Although the style is relatively old-fashioned, the craftsmanship and materials are very, very good. It was completely beyond my expectation. All kinds of copper materials can be seen everywhere. The room is very large, even the wash basin. Double basin. The location is very, very good. Across the road is the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, and 50 meters away is the Nanjing Road Station of the Line 2 subway. Next to it is Wang Baohe Hotel and Elong Hotel, but the quality is better than the other two. The elevator can also be accessed by swiping a card to go upstairs. The lobby is very grand, with a hemispherical roof. There is also a platform on the 6th floor, which is great in terms of hardware.

The hotel lobby is very grand, especially the Spring Festival photo check-in background is set at the door. Andy, the hotel's enthusiastic service star, helped our family leave a wonderful moment here.
The interior decoration of the room is also very luxurious and chic, with reasonable partitions and very comfortable.
The hotel service staff brought us a plate of Shanghai specialties, which made us feel the strong flavor and human touch in the Year of the Dragon.
I will continue to choose to stay here next time I come!

msg:The hardware and environment are both good. The three stars for the service are due to the concierge, room service, night shift front desk manager Ge, and the front desk lady he arranged for the morning of February 3rd. They were very nice. It was originally Worth five stars.
The two stars deducted are all for Wendy Wang, the front desk clerk who handled the room check-in procedure for me on the afternoon of February 2. She had a cold face throughout the entire process and did not say "please" or "thank you". When I asked to help me arrange a quiet room on a high floor with a better view, this lady Wendy arranged for me a room on the middle floor next to the elevator with a view of the rooftops of a bunch of old buildings without saying a word. , and "considerately" pointed our family of three to the elevator relatively far away from the room twice after I asked! Before that, when she paid the room fee for me, because she paid the room fee and the deposit together, I asked if I should pay them separately, one by credit card and the other by prepayment. She told me very impatiently, "I will refund you then." " Later, when we were "distributing" toothbrushes to us, we asked if there were paper bags to put them in. Because there were a lot of things, she rolled her eyes and said "no". The five-star service with such precious words was so amazing that I I thought that the language part of your hotel's front desk service was an additional paid service divided into sentences and polite expressions. I gained a lot of insights!
Finally, I would like to thank Manager Ge again for understanding the problem and arranging a solution for me as soon as possible. The room the next day was also very good. Thank you and the other front desk lady for your true five-star service!

The room is old, the equipment is old, and the floor corridor also smells. The hair dryer has low wind power. The mini bar in the room is charged (completely opaque, the front desk explained that there is a form, but it is actually a lie, and I don't know where the form is). Around 10 o'clock in the morning, someone will knock on the door to wake you up and ask if you want to wash clothes (it seems to be a caring service, but it is actually a disturbance, or it is forced to make you feel the service, **). Don't sit on the recliner, there are a few white spots on it. The front desk is slow to check out.

The room we stayed in can see the Shanghai three-piece suite. The most important thing is that the location is really not too bad. Convenient, close to Nanjing East Road Station of Metro Line 2, 50 meters walk to the subway station, and very close to the Bund.

msg:Facilities: It is indeed an old hotel, and the facilities are indeed relatively old. There is no USB port, so it is recommended to bring more sockets. There is a very old TV, a small refrigerator and an iron. The water spray from the shower head is not very uniform, but the advantage is that the water volume is large and the temperature is suitable, so bathing is still comfortable. No flaws were found in the sanitation depar**ent, so it was still OK.

Location: Absolutely advantageous. It takes two minutes to walk to Nanjing Road and three minutes to the subway station. It is suitable for families with children to travel. The convenient location really saves a lot of trouble. When I was tired from shopping, I went back in the afternoon to put away my things and take a rest.

Other tips: I didn't order breakfast and wanted to go out for snacks, but then I found that there weren't many breakfast options on Nanjing Road when I left at 8 or 9 o'clock. I tried to add breakfast if possible. In addition, there is a small Lawson's store opposite the hotel, which can be used for supplies, which is very convenient.


Service: When checking in and checking out, the front desk was professional, neither overly enthusiastic nor impolite. There are many foreigners involved, so the front desk's English is good, and it still maintains the hotel's old-fashioned image. In addition, at eight o'clock in the morning, my sister rang the doorbell and wanted to do some cleaning. Although we were all up, it still felt a bit early. If you sleep in, you can put up the do not disturb sign before going to bed.

The price/performance ratio is really high, recommended.

When the curtains are not opened, it is a room without windows. How do you treat a regular customer at the hotel? Tolerate? Fortunately, when I wanted to communicate with my American business partners at three o'clock in the morning, because my computer could not connect to the hotel's WF, the hotel immediately arranged for a man to help me solve the problem.

Here, but the service here is not as good as the first time. The attitude of the male front desk in Shanghai is much worse than that of the female colleagues before. There is also a greeter in the restaurant. My son is four years old and wants to use a billboard to measure his height. That is to measure the child. The height was used, and it was really just a slight adjustment. The man's attitude was very bad when the billboard fell down. Then my husband helped him up. What the hell was he thinking? I planned to complain but was stopped.
Also, the shampoo sucks. I used it three times and my hair was so frizzy. I spent 1,800 on care. I hope there will be improvement. I am very satisfied with the hotel room type and price, but the service and products are really not good.

But when I arrived, I saw it was great. It's just inside Nanjing Road, just across a small road. We are on Nanjing Road. We walk a few hundred meters to the Bund. There are many Internet celebrity restaurants nearby. You can see Nanjing Road from your room window. Moreover, the hotel rooms are all-American. The lobby and rooms are large and luxurious. It beats many new five-star hotels now. Before, The hardware configuration of the old five-star hotel is higher than the current one. I like this hotel so much.

msg:I didn't experience any service during my three-day stay. I felt that every employee was precious. When I arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock on the night of check-in, no one helped me with my luggage. The lobby was so big that I wasn't sure which way to go. I quickly arrived at the service desk. At this time, an employee appeared in the lobby. He walked slowly with his head lowered. I asked him which way was more convenient. He might be a little sleepy and didn't hear what I said. Then I asked again, He said that he would go around the edge and then arrive at the service desk. At this time, there were two groups of people checking in. There were three employees at the front desk. I stood there for a long time and no one said hello, so I asked a male employee in the middle. Asked if you can check in here, he said that only two sides can check in, and then he shook his head with his hands one to the left and one to the right. My feeling is that I can't check in, so just wait. We were a family of four when we checked in. , the normal service staff knew that there were not enough slippers in the room, but did not bring slippers for the children. When I got to the room, I called the front desk and asked for slippers to be delivered. Later, an older male employee came to deliver them, and there was a knock on the door. What a big deal. I opened the door and handed me the slippers without saying a word the whole time. Is this a requirement of the hotel? Should all employees be allowed to speak without talking? I also want to complain about the drinking water in the room and the executive room. There are only two bottles of water. I don‚Äôt know the actual needs of the guests after staying for several days in a row. I have to get them myself every time. In addition, the so-called soft drinks are only provided until 8 pm, and I have to sit in the lobby to drink them. I said Can we take it back to the room to drink? The service staff said no. If we take it back to the room, we will be charged or let us drink the room-charged drinks directly. How many people who are traveling can sit leisurely in your lobby and drink Coke? The toilet in the room is really not worthy of being placed in the bathroom of a five-star hotel. In short, the experience is very bad. I will never stay in this hotel next time I go to Shanghai. In addition, the Wangbaohe Hotel and Shanghai Hotel next to it are the same, so this I don‚Äôt dare to experience the hotel anymore.

What makes me complain the most is that when I checked in, I was told that I had to pay a 500 deposit. To be honest, I didn't understand it very much. I had never seen it before when I went out to play! The front desk explained that the refund would be given to me right after I checked out. However, when I checked out, they said it was no problem and my account would be credited in a moment. I left because I had to rush to the station, but the result was still the same after more than two hours. The account was not received, so I called to inquire, and the explanation given to me was that the guest room aunt had no feedback, so she did not refund it to me! Return it to me immediately... I want to say that it is okay to tell me when you check out. If I don't call, will my checkout be postponed for a day or two? 500 for me is not a lot, but with so many people staying here, it should be quite a lot...

msg:After comparing it to a nearby 4-star hotel, I thought a 5-star hotel would be better, so I paid more and made a reservation, but there wasn't much of a difference. The location is good and the lobby and rooms have a retro feel, but it feels a bit stuffy. The indoor swimming pool is quite large and has a deep section, making it great for swimming practice. The man at the evening reception speaks good English, but is a bit picky.

There are not many styles of breakfast, the taste is not that rich, and the chef's skills are not good. If you want to have a 5-star title, the catering aspect really needs to be strengthened and trained.

msg:When I checked in from April 2nd to 3rd, I didn't expect that the hotel did not have air conditioning. When we went to bed at night, our whole family sweated a lot and was very uncomfortable. The next day, we called the hotel front desk to inquire, and they actually told us that the air conditioning temperature can only be set at 22 degrees because the hotel only provides outdoor circulating air. Even if the room temperature is still very hot according to their settings, we can only open the window to allow some air circulation. But after all, there are children staying in the room. The height of the window is about the same as that of a child. There is always a danger. As a local five-star hotel, why? No air conditioning provided? The hotel's lobby and corridors have adequate air conditioning, but the rooms are extremely hot. Additionally, before we checked in, we asked twice if we could convert to a twin room for an additional fee, but the hotel just refused without giving any reason or solution. As a five-star hotel, it should at least tell guests the reason or provide a solution. Although the service attitude of other staff is very good, I can only say that those who are afraid of heat should not choose this hotel to stay.

msg:Although it is a five-star hotel, the hardware facilities are relatively old. The breakfast buffet has very few varieties and cannot meet the requirements of a four-star hotel. I have stayed at the Wangbaohe Hotel and New World Radisson Hotel next door and the breakfast varieties are better than It's rich. It can only be compared with the Elong Hotel next door, but it is a budget hotel. Most hotels in Linwai can check in around 12 o'clock, but this hotel requires check-in after 14 o'clock, so it is troublesome to check in with children who need to take a nap. There are basically no children at breakfast, and children have to pay half price for the buffet breakfast. , maybe it‚Äôs also a reason. Fortunately, we stayed at the New World Radisson Blu with children during the Spring Festival, otherwise it would have been troublesome to bring children. This time I went to this hotel to experience it, but the overall feeling was very average. I will not stay here next time I bring my children to Shanghai.

It is full of strong fragrance and the fragrance feels a little inconsistent every day (because there are many people in Waiguo) Therefore, the fragrance will change with different people). The hotel service staff are more enthusiastic, but they still have a sense of boundaries. They will definitely respond to you when you need help, and they will definitely not disturb you when you are not looking for them. . The coffee in the cafe next to the hotel is delicious. The hotel elevator is not very good, a bit small, but it is fast. The first time I walked through this corridor of the hotel, I was not exhausted, but I found it very convenient when I found the right location later. The hotel room is very large, within walking distance of the Huangpu River, and has a strategic location. The location and price are really cost-effective. The appliances in the hotel feel like they have a long history and are splendid and full of old money style. However, they are surprisingly comfortable and convenient to use. I like the cloakroom inside the most. It gives people a sense of home warmth. Overall, it is very suitable for taking children out.

msg:I stayed here for three days with my children. The overall environment of the hotel is okay and suitable for business stays. I don‚Äôt recommend staying here with children. Here are some thoughts:
1. The indoor air quality is too poor, especially in the corridors of the guest rooms. The pungent smell is very strong. I don‚Äôt know if it is from the carpet or the wallpaper.
2. The customer service at the front desk is very poor. When I checked in, there was a woman wearing glasses at the front desk who looked like a dog. It was really embarrassing for the hotel to see foreigners wagging their tails and begging for mercy and to see one of our own being a cold-blooded **.
3. The air conditioner is too old. An electric fan is more suitable. I really don‚Äôt understand why the air conditioner system is not updated. How old is it?
4. The breakfast is average, with few varieties, the pasta is not fresh, and does not match the quality of the hotel.
In short, it is recommended not to come if you are bringing children, it is not suitable. If you are on a business trip, it is okay to stay there, and it can be reimbursed. After all, it is not uncomfortable to spend money in vain.

I think it is unreasonable. (Because you need to have more available funds)

I like the old Shanghai decoration style of the hotel. It has a lot of heritage. The most important thing is that it is comfortable to live in and the quality of sleep is particularly good. Breakfast is as rich and delicious as ever. The location is in a prosperous area with convenient transportation. There is a subway station diagonally opposite the hotel, and there is a complete range of shopping, entertainment and dining nearby. I will choose here again if I have the opportunity to go to Shanghai.

That is to say, it is only free if you hold a baby on your hand. This is the first time I have experienced this in so many hotels. Generally, hotels with a height of 1.2 meters or less are free of charge.

We made a special request before checking in and made a note not to stay in a room near the elevator. When we checked in, the two rooms were the first one next to the elevator, and they were both the first and last rooms. In the elevator room, the guy who checked in at the front desk might have to go to work because he was celebrating the Chinese New Year, so he kept a straight face and ignored the whole audience. But when facing foreign friends, his smile was really bright, because he was different from his friends. Floor, we had to go to a friend's room and come down and ask the hotel to help us clean the elevator on the 7th floor. The staff asked us to stand on the first floor and wait until the front desk was free before helping us clean it. When we checked out, we saw a 50-year-old man at the front desk talking to him. Guests are quarreling year after year. Their attitude is really unspeakable. I will not come to Shanghai Hotel again next time. I am really disappointed.

Frankly speaking, the staff, who are mainly locals, cannot provide five-star standardized services. There is still a gap in service with various five-star hotels in other places.

While retaining the old Shanghai flavor, it also keeps pace with the times, achieving a combination of technology and ancient charm. For me, the most practical thing is to store luggage, choose pillows, and breakfast. Other supporting facilities are also very complete, such as gym, swimming pool, and meeting rooms, but I don‚Äôt need them hahahaha. The little brother at the front desk of the hotel gave us a room upgrade for free, which was a surprise! (I didn't take pictures, but I believe you won't be disappointed if you check in).
Breakfast was great! There are a lot of foreigners staying in this hotel too, so there are many kinds of breakfast. The whole space is bright and a**ospheric, with plenty of air conditioning and a strong aroma.
The subway is very convenient, Line 10 and Line 2 are very close. And just next to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, very close to People's Square and the Bund!
In short, I will come again next time!

Friends who were originally booked in other hotels immediately changed to the Shanghai Hotel. Overall, it is still good, especially the location is superior, and the place I want to go is not far from the hotel , and there are a lot of food around. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will book this hotel again.

I guess I didn't see the room charge information when I made the reservation... I know that the room charge is refunded if nothing is used in the room... but when I called the hotel, they said I had to pay it separately... This is ridiculous.
If so, I think you should include an explanation.
I don't think I saw anything like that when I made the reservation.
Originally, I thought it was about 990,000 won for 7 nights, but Tripdacom refunded 990,000 won (¬•599) and the total cost, including what I paid at the hotel, ended up being ¬•754.
Please check carefully and make a reservation.

msg:Objectively speaking, the transportation is convenient.
Hygienic environment and so on - it's expensive, but it's not too bad. Speaking of price, can a hotel with the same price offer worse service?
One is the little girl at the front desk on No. 25. She has a very different attitude towards Indians and compatriots. It can be compared to the airline stewardess blanket incident. It is okay to disdain me, and the ship will always capsize.
Second, the door lock was broken, and no one came to fix it until the third day.
The third is breakfast on the 26th. I ate a white line (I don‚Äôt know what it is), and I didn‚Äôt want to make a big fuss. I just reminded me in a low voice to change a bowl. In fact, I lost my appetite at all. The foreman came over and said that he didn't look through it (I didn't pursue it, she actually checked it a second time), and he knew that he had taken pictures to collect evidence. Take the initiative to promise to send fruit. In the evening, I casually said that the fruit did not come. A middle-aged man at the front desk asked why there was fruit in an interrogative manner.
The fourth is to check out. I sincerely discuss whether it is possible to delay the check-out with children. The above-mentioned man is probably in a bad mood, so he refused very hard, and asked me to see how busy they are because of their business. How can I have time? Delay. I said it is negotiable on Ctrip, but he threw away the golden sentence: Ctrip is Ctrip, and I am me.
The fifth is to apply for the toothbrush when you have to move in. The four of us have two days' worth. We found a plastic bag in the vegetable market and put it in a plastic bag at the request. The girl who rolled her eyes was connected.
Sixth, the room card for the second night needs to be renewed. The guest is too late and too tired to speak. He can‚Äôt open the door when he goes upstairs, and then he goes down to the front desk to ask if I want to continue the stay‚Äî‚ÄîI booked it on the first day Two days please, you can check the records!
The service industry is negotiated and negotiated between people, otherwise, what business do hotels do? Five-star hotels are so awesome, is Gao Qiqiang? Does anyone care? No one cares, so the guests can hide for a while. After all, there are quite a lot of options at this price point.

Breakfast is 158, but the content is not suitable; there is no cover for the bathtub; there is no USB port, and I borrowed the plug to call twice and waited for 40 minutes; the slippers are not changed the next day; the angle of the desk lamp cannot be adjusted; the TV is like a fast hotel; Indians There are many (referring to other reviews, I thought it was nothing); the trash can in the bathroom is hard to describe; there is only one box of paper in the bathroom. The facilities are called retro, and there are too many mirrors, you know

msg:It is one of the most disgusting hotels I have ever stayed in. The attitude at the front desk is extremely arrogant. If you ask more than one question, you will be beaten to death. I regret that I chose this hotel directly without reading the previous reviews. There have always been a lot of comments about poor service attitude, but they have never changed. There is a problem with hotel management. There is no service awareness from top to bottom, and there is no basic human quality. It is still called a Shanghai Grand Hotel, which is simply discrediting Shanghai. Only ( ) can be described. If you want to experience discrimination and indifference in China, choose this hotel to guarantee your satisfaction.

msg:The hotel made me feel unexpectedly satisfied
The location is good. Very close to the subway station, walk to the Bund. Three minutes away from the pedestrian street.
The neighborhood is lively. You can't see the Bund or the Oriental Pearl Tower from the 16th floor, but you can see the tall buildings on the north side of the Bund.
There are many foreign guests staying at the hotel, and the service is professional but not overly enthusiastic. It's quite comfortable
The room is super large and very clean. The bed is 1.3 meters comfortable and you can bring your baby to sleep with you. The hotel provides free cribs and beds, which babies love very much.
Bathtub shower water temperature is just right
Breakfast is good, everything is delicious. Although children have to pay extra, they like to eat it.
Shanghai's booming economy

msg:A very average experience, without the corresponding five-star service of the old brand. There was no bellman to help with luggage when entering, and there was not even a lobby manager to give directions for check-in. When checking in, I asked for toothbrush and toothpaste, but I was given toothpaste. There are not many choices for breakfast and the taste is average. Seriously speaking, there are indeed differences in the trea**ent of Chinese and foreigners. The speed of responding to needs is different, and the degree of smile is also different. In short, it can make you feel obviously unhappy.
The best service is the attitude of the housekeeping staff, gentle and courteous. Although I don‚Äôt know her name, indeed, if it weren‚Äôt for her, I could even give this hotel two stars for service...
There are many hotels of the same level in the surrounding area, so Shanghai Grand Hotel would not be recommended to everyone. After all, what you pay for is facilities and environmental services. The facilities are not outstanding, the environment is average, and the services are not good.
Another: I never expected that the toilet in a five-star hotel is so bad. The lid has no damping, it makes a clanging sound, and the flushing sound is loud...
One more thing: the concierge can rent baby strollers, although we didn't rent one.

I asked her if it was possible to check out later, but she directly told me that I could only check in early and that I had to check out at 12 o'clock. I asked her where I could smoke, and she told me impatiently that smoking was only allowed outside the hotel. As a result, I found that there was an open-air terrace on the sixth floor of the hotel where I could smoke. I didn‚Äôt know why she wanted me to walk ten minutes to smoke outside the hotel. It was even more funny when we went to have breakfast in the morning. My friend and I first sat at a table. After sitting for a minute, we found that the seat next to us was more suitable, so we took our chopsticks and broke a seat. As a result, the waiter immediately walked to the seat where we were sitting. She said who stole her chopsticks. I was very angry after eating breakfast. This is the Shanghai Grand Hotel, a five-star hotel on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. I was also drunk. Hope this helps friends who want to stay!

Haha, but parking costs 15 yuan/hour for hotel guests and 10 yuan/page for printing... Some money can be earned without this.

msg:I stayed for one night and felt good. It wasn't as bad as the reviews. The following is a fair review. I hope it will be useful to everyone. After going to Disney the day before, I mainly want to take my children to explore the city.
First of all, the location of the hotel is really close to the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. It takes a minute to walk. The sightseeing bus stop is 50 meters west of the hotel. It is about three or four minutes walk from the subway station entrance, which is super convenient.
Secondly, the environment and decoration style of the hotel are quite dignified, but they are not too old. According to the reviews, there is no one carrying luggage in the hotel. It was a coincidence. I didn‚Äôt even go there. Later, I found out that the concierge helped other guests to deliver their luggage to the room. Yes, there is only one head concierge, and it may not be convenient to leave the post. I think it is understandable, and the check-in is very fast, and I take the initiative to remind if I need toiletries. Later, I found out in the room that there are regulations on energy conservation and emission reduction in Shanghai , That's why I don't take the initiative to configure toiletries, but if necessary, you can ask the hotel to provide them for free, and the special thing is that you need a comb, which is actually delivered to your door by a robot. It's super loving, and the children like it very much. The room is nice, very big, two meters long A family of three with a king-sized bed can comfortably sleep. In addition, it is very unfriendly to smokers. The entire hotel is non-smoking, which is completely understandable.
There is also breakfast, the service is absolutely fine, but there is still a charge of 90 yuan under 1.4 meters, there are many types of breakfast, enough, the taste is average, I eat a little salty, this may be due to personal reasons.
Generally speaking, the service is absolutely fine. Seeing the 5-star signs hanging at the door and the front desk is a sign of trust. Some places may have to do it because of the high standard of guests received by the hotel, but they are all acceptable, and there is absolutely no need to check in without hypocrisy. The problem will give you a very perfect experience, the above is only a personal opinion

I don't know if the business is not bad, so we didn't feel it. Instead of feeling at home, I felt full of arrogance and irresponsibility. Since I had to take medicine at night, I wanted to go downstairs and ask the waiter for hot water in the lobby restaurant. The waiter in the lobby restaurant made me feel uncomfortable and had an extremely bad attitude. , slamming the guest's water glass, with a look of reluctance. Because of work, we often travel around. We have stayed in various hotels at home and abroad. We have never seen a hotel with such poor service in the lobby restaurant. We promptly complained to the lobby manager. , but the attitude of the lobby manager really surprised us. He kept emphasizing that their waiters were young and inexperienced, and always asked us if we had brought the wrong kettle. It was really funny. You, a lobby manager, are out of control. Instead of first thinking about apologizing to the guests, the first thing I thought about was how to excuse my employees. They also kept asking us what we want, sorry, we don‚Äôt want to do anything, do you think we will use this to take advantage of your hotel? ? ? ? I would like to ask, is this the service consciousness that a five-star hotel should have? Is this the quality that a high-end hotel in the international metropolis of Shanghai should have for guests from all over the world? Even in a fast hotel, I have never seen guests treated like this, and almost all the service staff in the lobby have a very indifferent attitude. In the morning, three doormen chatted at the door without even saying hello. When they saw foreigners coming, they nodded and bowed. Seeing that our compatriots are turning a blind eye, please, it‚Äôs 2023, you are still doing this, do you want to be an Internet celebrity? I will definitely not stay in this hotel again, and I hope you will avoid it!
PS: The only person who served us sincerely was Ms. Zhang Changping, the room attendant on the 8th floor. Her job number is 11715. Thank you for her warm and attentive service! I hope you will reflect on why the room service is so considerate, but the front-end service in the lobby is so disappointing. I booked a room rate of Ôø•1079/night, and I feel that the service of some people is not as good as Ôø•79. I can only haha!

It's very convenient to walk from the hotel to Najin East Road and Nanjing West Road, and if you get tired midway through, it's great to come back to the hotel to rest and resume your trip. I didn't ask for breakfast, but there are plenty of places to eat around. Here are a few places to visit near the hotel.

The staff were warm and attentive, providing an excellent service experience. The hotel has a superior geographical location, convenient transportation and complete surrounding facilities. The breakfast was rich and delicious, which satisfied my taste buds. Overall, I had a very good impression of my stay at Shanghai Grand Hotel and would recommend it to other travelers.

msg:Stayed for two nights and was very satisfied. In the deluxe business double room on the 15th floor, only one side of the corridor is the room, and the middle is the patio. I don't know if this is the reason why it is very quiet. The service staff from the lobby to cleaning are very enthusiastic and respond positively, and they also take the initiative to say hello when they meet in the corridor. It is very convenient for the concierge to store luggage, order takeout, and send express delivery.
The room is comfortable, the bathroom is well designed, and the lighting is bright and soft. Shanghai in March is still very cold, even colder than Beijing, so I am glad that the room has warm air and the temperature is well adjusted. We only stayed for two nights, so we didn't ask to clean the room and change supplies. The lobby manager even called us to confirm.
The location of the hotel is two steps away from Nanjing Road, and you can see Nanjing Road when you look down from the window. Downstairs, there is a small Rosen supermarket, a snack bar for eating cakes and noodles, Italian food, Japanese food, Turkish food, and Lebanese food. You can eat whatever you want, and there are interesting and interesting things to go in any direction. Fuzhou Road is just a few steps away, and you can visit foreign language bookstores.
So glad I booked here.

I wonder if all the waiters in your hotel can speak English. The front desk‚Äôs reply is really good.) The foreigner said, what if it doesn‚Äôt happen? The front desk said that we are such a hotel and there is nothing we can do... said this front desk It's a girl wearing a mask, Actually she was rude, this is the original words of foreigners.
The hotel restaurant service, concierge service, and other staff at the front desk are very professional and friendly, except for this girl wearing a mask. Won't stay here again next time.

msg:The overall a**osphere of the hotel is good, but some supporting services in management are slightly behind. First of all, if the room card is lost, you need to pay 60 yuan. Now many hotels no longer have this fee, and even give the room card to the user as a souvenir. The second is cleaning in the morning. If Do Not Disturb is not turned on, you will knock on the door in the morning to ask. I have never encountered it in the hotels I have stayed in before, and they will not disturb the guests when there are people in the room. In addition, the charged peanuts and potato chips are placed on the table, and there is no reminder that they are charged items. It does not mean that they must be served with welcome fruits like other hotels, but if the items in the room are charged items, it is recommended to have obvious logo, because once a child enters the house, if there is no logo, it is easy to open it and eat it for free

During this process, I saw the "service" of the duty manager in their hotel lobby, which was absolutely amazing, with all kinds of excuses; "Who told you to have two rooms on the same floor? We have completed the cleaning in 20 minutes (20 minutes after my call at 15:30)", I have stayed in many hotels, but only this one is so **, I don't know, where do you get the confidence to deliver the room late, you can't apologize to appease and put out the fire, you are adding fuel to the fire, and you are fanning the flames. With this level, you are still a duty manager in the lobby?

msg:Every time I come to Shanghai, I live in this hotel, but this time I was very angry. Jasmine, who was on duty at the front desk on the night of January 27, had a bad attitude. She asked if the check-out on the executive floor could be delayed until 1 o'clock the next day. She replied that it would depend on the customer situation the next day. I. Breakfast on the morning of the 28th was very unpleasant! Because the coffee machine indicated that coffee beans needed to be replenished, I informed a waitress in the catering depar**ent who was wearing a long black down jacket and had tall hair with hair clips. She replied: Oh! There was no hot water on the self-service counter, and I was afraid of the cold weather, so I brought some black tea in a thermos for my mother. When she saw it, she immediately yelled and asked me if I was picking up black tea! Said that I would tell her next time I picked it up, otherwise I would have finished picking up the black tea! The black tea bucket is very large, and it is impossible to pick it up at one point, and it is the responsibility of the hotel to replenish the self-service counter in time. Her tone was really mocking and sarcastic, and it could be said that she was just expressing her displeasure. The voice was very loud, and the guests at several tables next to her were all looking at her. When I went back to the executive floor, I saw a lady on duty. I told her about the situation and she had a good attitude, saying that she would respond like the manager on duty, but I didn‚Äôt receive any feedback from the hotel until I checked out. It is really ironic to look up and see the top ten hotels in China hanging on the wall of the hotel reception. Room number 617.

The experience was very good and the service quality was high. I thought they were all five-star hotels named after places, so it should be about the same!
First of all, when checking in, what did you experience when checking in? The staff are arrogant and condescending. After getting the room card, we discovered that the two rooms were far apart. We were with children, so it was very inconvenient to pick up things. Completely disregarding the guest's stay experience. I have a bad impression of Shanghai Grand Hotel and will not choose this hotel next time.

msg:If you arrive in Shanghai early in the morning, avoid this hotel! ! This bad review is for the lady at the front desk! We arrived at the hotel no later than 8:30 at around 8:00 a.m. on May 29. Because Xiaobao was a little uncomfortable with two babies, we applied to the front desk to see if we could check in early. The front desk said that we had to check in early. An additional half-day room fee was charged. I said we had to check out early the next morning. I wanted to see if I could apply for an early check-in with the lobby manager. The lady at the front desk refused without even asking the manager, saying that if I want to live now, I have to add an extra fee. Only half a day's room fee will be charged! Otherwise, I will wait until the time is up to check in, and I have not provided any solutions. I am afraid that I am thinking about money and going crazy! ! It's just an operational problem! A look of contempt! ! ! (One said that the staff in the concierge depar**ent are still very helpful, with a good attitude and very patient to help us solve the problem.) The room is very large, the facilities are relatively old but it does not affect the use, and it is quite simple! Everything else is okay, this is my real stay experience!

Facilities are very average, and the sound insulation is poor! The sound of flushing the toilet next door is very clear! There was nothing to eat for breakfast.
The attitude of the front desk, especially the manager on duty, is so arrogant that they can‚Äôt solve any problems. They only know that there is no way, and we can‚Äôt do anything about it. , other yarn effects do not.

Summary: There are tens of thousands of hotels in Shanghai, and there are many hotels on Nanjing East Road. Whether you are on a business trip or traveling, choose another one! ! Don't block yourself.
Since then, the planned reservation of the hotel for nearly a year has been cancelled, because the managers on duty at the front desk have been black all their lives.

msg:During the morning of April 20, 2023, from 10:00 to 10:30, due to the large number of guests checking out during this period, the front desk was busy, but there were only two service staff, the service efficiency was low, a large number of guests were stranded, and no one maintained order during the period, the scene was chaotic and inefficient. The front desk staff treated guests transparently and were indifferent and rude. After waiting in line for more than half an hour, I was finally served. After a long wait, I expressed my needs very clearly and wanted to stay in the room for one more day. As a result, the service staff just swiped my room card and thought that my room card was invalid. If I hadn't returned to the hotel in the early morning of the same day and saw that the front desk was relatively free, I would have wanted to consult other guest room-related matters by the way. I had no idea that after such a long wait in the morning and the indifference and cold violence of the service staff, the service I received in turn was completely invalid. I live here every time I go back to Shanghai. I didn't expect that I would be heartbroken when I entered the country for the first time three years after the epidemic. I can only leave with regret in the future. Please pay attention to other guests to avoid pits.

From the doorman to the front desk, and the eldest sister of room service, they are all very kind and enthusiastic, especially if you call to ask for a late check-out He readily agreed! The room is a bit old and not as big, but the hygiene is very good and the bed is comfortable. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the air conditioner has no cold air, the room is very stuffy, and the windows cannot be opened

The service is warm, and the lady at the front desk is beautiful and has a good attitude. The room is large and the facilities are good. The only downside is that the pillow is too high, making sleeping uncomfortable. In the end, the breakfast buffet is average and there are not many varieties. I hope that there will be more varieties of breakfast in the future.

Overall, I am satisfied with the tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle. Although the decoration in 2009 is different from the simple style that is popular now, it still looks relatively upscale. However, there is one thing that is not satisfactory. The swimming pool is not open during the epidemic period, and there is no reminder on the hotel page, which disappointed the children. Breakfast is not a buffet, it feels that the service is reduced.

The location is very convenient, just 150 meters from Line 2. The service attitude is also good. The decoration is in the style of the Republic of China. The rooms are not big, but the setting is very delicate. Although the style of the Republic of China is a bit old, it is much better than the light decoration of many new hotels now. It has everything you should have, and even has it Walk-in closet! The only uncomfortable thing is that the room is too hot, and I can't sleep with a quilt at night... How about sticking to this price/performance ratio? I'll stay here again next time I'm in Shanghai!

First of all, after the end of Disney, I took a taxi to the Shanghai World Hotel. I called the front desk of the hotel and asked which door to enter? The answer is South Gate! It was already eleven o'clock in the car, and the two children in the car were asleep, and there were two large boxes in the trunk. The driver drove to the south gate to locate the location, but found the door of the hotel. We dragged our luggage to the hotel lobby in the middle of the night!
        I thought the embarrassment just now was just an episode, who would have thought that the experience had just begun. Five-star hotel toilet seat does not slow down! Going to the toilet in the middle of the night is scary! After blowing on the hair dryer for less than two minutes, there was a smell of rubber! It was replaced the next day! The toilet light is the most exaggerated, flickering, don't be afraid if you are timid!

msg:When I was young, I stayed with my dad on business trips a few times. This time my friend went to Shanghai to play, so I chose this one directly (or the Peace Hotel, but the price is not high for friends, if you have feelings)
The entrance is the pedestrian street and the No. 4 Nanjing East Road of Line 2, the traffic is also convenient;
The city hall and the park/square are at the end of the pedestrian street on the left;
Go straight on the right hand side to the Bund and Lujiazui three-piece suit;
This is the second night (Originally scheduled to go to Disney, and later I thought about Halloween, I estimated a bunch of children, so I implemented Plan B, although the service on the first night meant it was shortcomings). The Wendy Wang at the front desk served very well, but the concierge (should be a foreman, It‚Äôs more embarrassing to deal with the problem when wearing formal clothes...
What happened: I forgot to wear masks when I went downstairs. In total, it was troublesome to go upstairs. I was thinking of asking the concierge to "borrow" two masks, but people said no. Under "Question", I told me that a whole family was selling masks. Go out of the lobby, good fellow üò± Continue to tell me that it will be there in 5 minutes... I'll go back to the room to get it

The episode is over. Comprehensive evaluation: The environmental sanitation is still good. Although it has been opened for a long time, those who like this kind of stable style can also take pictures of the gourd, but the service is really not flattering
üöó Transportation: Convenient, subway at the door-Nanjing East Road
üßπHygienic: Yes
üçÉEnvironment: Yes
üîîService: Don't dare to compliment (except for Wendy Wang at the front desk, who is anxious about what the guests are anxious)

msg:I went to this hotel once by chance and was attracted by the elegant old Keller style in the lobby. Before the National Day, I took a look at the double bed with a price of more than 800 and booked it decisively with breakfast included. The result was unexpectedly good. Even on the National Day, there were very, very few people. The swimming pool and gym were almost empty, and the swimming pool was very clean. Not to mention the room. It has been in business for more than 10 years, and everything seems to be new. The furniture is basically not worn out. There is no gray or broken hair in the room, especially the bathtub. The location and time of this environment is definitely a price of conscience. The hairy crabs downstairs are also highly recommended for self-help. Although they will be smaller than the ones you bought in Yangcheng Lake (about 2 taels for females and more than 3 taels for males), they are better than all the crabs. Not bad, very satisfied!

Stayed in a deluxe double bed and courtyard room, the room size is large and the sanitary conditions are good, the bed is comfortable and the bathtub is clean! ! ! The most important thing is that it is super close to the Bund and those big shopping malls! Lots of delicious food nearby! This geographical location is too fragrant for six to seven hundred yuan! Ordinary chain hotels in Shanghai are also four to five hundred na ~ a slight disadvantage is that the check-in speed is very slow and cannot be checked in early, but many epidemic prevention and control procedures have been handled well, which is understandable. There are gyms and swimming pools to try next time.

It is about 200 meters away from Gate 2 of Line 2. There is no breakfast for the room booked this time, so I went out to the convenience store to buy breakfast very close.
The hotel rooms are large and comfortable, clean and tidy, although the style is relatively nostalgic, it is very suitable for returning customers like me. I checked in at 7pm, not during peak hours. It would be better if the lady at the front desk could put on a sweet smile. When I checked in, I didn‚Äôt ask me if I want toiletries. I wonder if there is no such training or it‚Äôs really. Don't remember to ask. The wifi in the room is very slow. Finally, I turned on the hotspot of my mobile phone and gave my daughter's mobile phone to check in and attend class. I hope it can be improved.
The swimming pool is smaller than expected, 1.2-1.8 meters deep, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs understaffed. I used to swim at night. The locker room was not equipped with disinfection slippers. I reluctantly used the slippers used by others to walk from the locker room. The swimming pool, with a water temperature of 29 degrees, is very comfortable.
On the day we left the shop, because we couldn't take a taxi, the bar service waiter helped us to call the roadside in time. Thank you very much!

This time is a family trip and entertaining relatives in the hometown. There are cribs to add (but the hotel says there are 2 in total). After letting the baby sleep in the crib, the old mother enjoys the big bed alone, which is very comfortable and stress-relieving, with mattresses and pillows. It is also a soft one.
What‚Äôs not too satisfying is the catering, the breakfast is very average, and the crayfish buffet in the evening is also average. The breakfast ordered to the room is slightly better, but not outstanding.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is not bad.

The service staff would smile with a fake smile when they set the lines. If they exceeded the set lines, as long as they asked questions, the answer would always be " "No", there are robots in the lobby, there are no robots to deliver takeaways, no children's bathrobes, no bathtub covers, the breakfast buffet is unpalatable like never before, and the most unbearable thing is that my husband went downstairs to get takeaway drinks and was trapped. After spending half an hour in the elevator of a five-star hotel, the door was opened by the staff. I went back to my room by myself. After two days of check-in, there was no explanation, no apology, and no explanation. When I left the hotel, my friend drove to pick me up, and I was greeted by someone at the door. The security guard stopped me and took him around the main road twice. This kind of service is not worthy of his star rating and not worth the price. I will definitely not stay here again.

Fortunately, I later stayed in a business king room, and the toilet had a few more doors, so I no longer smelled the stench.

msg:On a business trip, the post-90s generation said that they don‚Äôt want to come again in the future. Seriously bad review! Ashamed of the name of this hotel.
1. The service is really terrible. There is a 15% service charge for express delivery. There is no microwave oven. This Nima 5-star hotel?
2. The light in the room is dim and yellow, and the large mirror is facing the door. What is the Feng Shui pattern of this Nima? 5 stars?
3. The design of the lighting buttons in the room is confusing, and the learning cost is high. Can you turn on/off the lights you want to control at once, count me as losing?
4. The lowest level of air-conditioning for sleeping at night, the sound is still loud. After the door was opened, the TV was forcibly turned on, the sound was loud and scared to death, and the content played was still old. Not to mention the projection function, not at all! Things that can be achieved by adding a TV box. What does Nima need to do with TV? Isn‚Äôt it good to invest in cash after selling? It also affects the passenger experience.
5. The wifi is extremely rubbish, and the download speed is not 1m/s. This Nima is too much. Even the Internet speed in the third-tier cities is already 10m/s. Is this worthy of a five-star hotel?
6. I booked 2 rooms, first swiped my card to detain the Le 2k deposit. When is the deposit still available? In addition, when checking out, the two rooms are left separately, and the invoicing process cannot be opened together. The invoice for this room cannot be issued until the last room is over.
In short, I didn't think it was worthy of 5 stars, and the comprehensive experience was the service experience 20 years ago. The taste of breakfast was also very ordinary, barely enough. At best, it will give you the feeling of a 2-star hotel. Never meet again!

Since the standard is for babies, there is nothing to say, but later I saw that the children who came in about 1 meter were free. The standard was originally greeted by the restaurant. Man's mood! Besides the dishes, the quality of the dishes is not as good as that of the Express Hotel, even if the quality is poor, more than 80% of the dishes are cold, and the glutinous rice balls, steamed buns, fried eggs, and rice balls are all cold.

msg:The Shanghai Hotel is trying to trick consumers. As soon as we entered the room, we saw a small bag of peanuts and a small bag of potato chips on the table at the door. We thought they were for guests. First, it is not valuable food. Second, there is no obvious charge reminder. We thought it was given to guests. At other hotels we would have received better free food than these. The five-star hotel we stayed in cost 1,390 yuan per night. At checkout, they actually informed us that this bargain was for a fee and charged us 58 yuan. When we checked in, a 500 yuan deposit was deducted. We stayed in 4 hotels on this trip, and only the Shanghai Hotel withheld the deposit. It turned out that they were trying to defraud us of more than 50 yuan.
At that time, the previous customers were arguing with them about this matter, and I was very angry. The two of us jointly requested to see the manager.
After the manager came, he admitted that many guests had made comments about this. We asked for a refund, but later the manager asked us to write a complaint so that he could explain it to the superior and refund the small amount to us.
This incident shows that some people in the hotel are collecting hidden money! I hope Ctrip will follow up. This kind of behavior that deceives customers must stop, and the scandalous behavior of those who charge unreasonable fees must be exposed.

msg:The service attitude is very bad. In what era are they still running a hotel with a superior attitude? Are the good reviews all fake? The accommodation experience is extremely bad. I chose this hotel just to stay for a few hours to catch the first number of the nearby hospital, and I specially chose the five-diamond standard. When I checked in at midnight, my companions did not bring their ID cards. I was already very tired. The attitude of the front desk was very bad and impatient. They asked people to go to the police station to get a certificate. A group of people surrounded us like prisoners. We got emotional. We didn't stay with such a bad attitude. The front desk asked: What should I do? I said that I would not stay. What else can I do. After handing over the room card, the front desk said that this is it, you can leave. There was no mention of non-refundable room fees. We left without leaving the lobby. After a while, I saw that the pre-authorization was not refunded, so I called to ask. I didn't expect everyone to lie together and insisted that the front desk had informed me that the fee was not refundable. I said you take out the surveillance and see that I stood there for less than ten seconds. Am I stupid? If the hotel says that the fee is not refundable, I am so disgusted by you and you still give you money? What qualifications do you have to charge me if I don't stay in the hotel? The duty manager didn't say a single good word on the phone. If you have any complaints, just come back and stay. Is the state-owned enterprise so poor now? Do they want customers to pay and then drive them away? Do the ancient dignitaries look down on the common people? The most annoying thing is that they all help to lie.
I seriously suspect that the good reviews are all fake, and the bad reviews have been deleted. I strongly recommend that the unanimous bad reviews of the service be put on the homepage. There were several people who were angry like me on the same day. They spent money and could only write bad reviews on Dianping.com. The scammers took the money and were still so arrogant. The bad guys are in power! I really want to curse.
