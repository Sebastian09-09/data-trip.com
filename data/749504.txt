msg:The room we rented was unexpectedly spacious. It has 2 big bedrooms, 1 living room, pantry, 2 baths and 3 toilets. Beds are comfortable and they changed towels everyday. They also provide a lot of tissue in the rooms which is a big plus when travelling in China, as tissue seems to be quite a rarity. Although there is a small pantry for usage, but they do not provide any cutleries or plates. We had to request for some at the reception. Overall, it was an excellent and comfortable stay and I will definitely stay here if I visit Beijing again. However, there is one confusion though, although we booked under Bai Fu Yi hotel, but the room is not a hotel it is actually situation adjacent to a service apartment name D Rita apartments. Hence, after check in we couldn't take the lift at the hotel even though we tried to swipe our key card at the elevator. So, we went back to reception and the staff brought us to another building which is connected with the hotel to take the lift there and it is the D Rita apartment lift. It would be nice if the website  clarify this during booking as to set the right expectations. Luckily, the service apartment room turned out to be great and we really enjoyed the stay.

House keeping is to a high standard, having a hot bath after a long day site's seeing is perfect.
The only downside is the kitchen utensils are not provided if you stay there less than one month.
Location is very convenient as it is only 1 km walk to the subway station, I definitely recommend this hotel if you travel light. Keep this in mind, the streets in Beijing for pedestrians is not luggage friendly.

Nearby the hotel was the first Pizzahut store in China and we totally enjoyed having our breakfast and lunch there on some days. The only slight drawback was the proximity to the nearest metro station. As we visited during the winter month and there was no lift facility, we had to lug our luggage up the metro and walked about 20 minutes to get to the hotel. Thereafter, the staff shared with us that there is a bus stop near the hotel and we had been using the bus ever since there to escape from the cold. Overall a pleasant stay and recommended for family.

We got into the lift, making 8 people and the alarm ranch and the lift wouldn‚Äôt go.At 95kg, I was the heaviest person there by a big, big margin. The staff varied in helpfulness. Front desk were not very friendly or efficient. Bar staff were excellent. Location is good for access to embassies, but there is nothing much else in the area. Would not stay here again.

The room was massive, beautifully clean and well furnished. Service and cleanliness were impeccable. We had a small issue with the shower which was attended to quickly. Staff were helpful and courteous. I would happily stay at this hotel again.

We were kindly upgraded which we appreciated and had huge rooms! Buffet breakfast not bad and also had some western options. Location is great walking distance to a metro, food options, decent supermarket diagonally across the road. Would recommend!

Unfortunately house keepers forgot to clean one bath room but they cleaned soon after I feedback with small gift.
Regarding hotel location, it is not very convenient but it is still ok as long as you basically drive or take taxi. There are some convenience stores within 5mins walk.
I want to use this hotel again when I travel to Beijing next time.

msg:After I lost my belongings at the hotel front desk, the front desk did not help me find them! They said they had not found them! But the lost items were actually at the front desk! The staff shirked their responsibilities! The service was extremely poor! The hotel air conditioner could not cool and said it only had natural wind! The hot water was unstable when taking a shower! I do not recommend staying here!
I checked out at the front desk at around 14:15 in the afternoon. The front desk staff said they needed to wait until there were two customers waiting in line at the front desk before they processed the check-in procedures for the previous customer. During my stay at the front desk, I forgot my Bluetooth headset at the front desk. At 16:40, I called the front desk for the first time to ask for help in finding a gray Bluetooth headset. At that time, I provided the front desk staff with three places where I might have lost my belongings: the front desk, the concierge, and the room I stayed in last night. At 16:49 and 16:51, the staff called me back twice, saying that my headset was not found in any of the three places.
Because the Bluetooth headset has a positioning function, I found the hotel again at 17:00 based on the positioning. After using the headset search function, the headset sounded an alarm and found that the headset was at the front desk counter!!! At 17:15, a staff member called again and said: I went to the hotel to look for the earphones, and other customers picked them up at the front desk five minutes ago. First of all, I told the staff the characteristics of my earphones (gray Bluetooth earphones) when I called for the first time, and your staff called me back twice to say that they were not found. May I ask if there are other customers who lost gray earphones at the front desk during this process? You replied to me that the earphones were found five minutes ago, but you don‚Äôt know who they belong to, so you can‚Äôt proceed to the next step. Is this reason valid?
If I hadn‚Äôt returned to the hotel to look for it again, would this earphone have become the private property of your hotel? None of the three calls solved the problem for me. In addition to evading responsibility and shirking that it was the problem of other colleagues, you did not provide me with any help. Is your service worthy of your hotel room rate?
Very bad and infuriating check-in experience! Poor facilities! Poor service! Not recommended for everyone to stay!

msg:The hotel on this trip is really worth commenting on. We, a group of two adults and two children, wanted to find a twin bed with a larger bed. We found on Ctrip that it listed two 1.8 large beds. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk specially asked We were upgraded and given a suite with two bedrooms, a large living room, and three bathrooms. What else can we say about living in such a large suite at this price in Beijing's 3rd Ring Road? The most important thing is to clean it on time every day and treat customers basically. All requests are answered, and takeaways are delivered efficiently by robots. In the end, our late check-out was also a very good service. It was considerate and reassuring for me as an old and young person. In addition, although the location is not far away The subway entrance is very close, but it is very convenient to transfer to the bus. In fact, it is quite close to the Sanlitun Embassy District by taking a taxi.

msg:The first surprise when we came to Beijing was this hotel. They upgraded us to a 2-bedroom suite for free. It was surprisingly big when we opened the door. It was fully equipped with washing machines, ovens, etc. When we were washing clothes, we found that the washing machine could not start. The hotel directly replaced it with a new one the next day. The cleaning lady on the floor also washed and dried the dirty clothes that we had not washed. Moreover, the hotel is within the second ring road, and it is very convenient to go to the core scenic spots such as Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, and Lama Temple. They are basically about 3 kilometers away. I will continue to patronize it when I bring my children here in the future.

msg:I went to Beijing for a 6-day trip with my friends during the Easter holidays. My friend recommended a hotel with an advantageous location - Baifuyi Hotel. Since there were three of us traveling together, we were looking for a hotel that could accommodate three people, so we rented a twin room. A room for four people. Thanks to the cosmic waiter who helped me upgrade on the spot. We stayed in a large room with two bedrooms and two living rooms, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, and three bathrooms. I was very happy when I moved in. I stayed for two nights and kept the room for one night. Then go to Gubei Water Town with your luggage. I stayed for two more nights after coming back from Gubei Water Town. I guess I won‚Äôt be able to upgrade when I come back from Gubei. The waiter was very happy and helped me upgrade back to the same room. As a result, I had enough space to make an appoin**ent with my big class Beijing friends to order takeout at the hotel without having to go out. While waiting for a table to eat, we had time to chat all night, and then we soaked our feet together in the neighborhood. A happy journey starts from this hotel, a perfect trip to Beijing.

Good wine and room goods can be placed at the front desk. Fuyi is really God's gate. What are the 6 security guards on the left and right at the gate? I don't understand what they are used for. Comrades, you can take a look and compare the situation in the lobby. Another crosshair in a state-owned enterprise hotel.

Also, the housekeeping aunt Wang Jing, after knowing that I was not feeling well, she kindly expressed condolences the next day and helped us find packing tape for us on the morning of our check-out.
The only thing that can be improved is the provision of mineral water. There are only four bottles a day, and extra bottles need to be charged. If four more bottles can be provided, it will be impeccable.

It is a bit far from Dongzhimen Metro Station. You can take bus 123 downstairs from the hotel for two stops to the subway entrance.
Special praise to the hotel cleaning lady: My son bought a gold Guanyin pendant at the Big Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an. One day he put it under the pillow and forgot to take it with him. In ordinary hotels, it is difficult to tell if it is lost, but the pendant was still there after we returned to the hotel. There was no movement under the pillow, which shows that the hotel management is standardized and the employees are of high quality. Special thanks. I would like to praise the hotel service and the quality of the cleaning lady.

msg:Stayed at Baifuyi for five nights. We booked two executive rooms for one night and the twin room booked by our tour guide for four nights.
Overall, the hygiene is very good and the service attitude is also very good. But the heating and Wi-Fi are not very good.
Regarding the service attitude, I just checked in and found that one of the rooms had a strong smell of cigarette smoke. It may be that the previous guests smoked in the non-smoking room. The front desk quickly helped change rooms. Later, because the room booked by the tour guide for the next day was different from the one I booked, I needed to change rooms. Before the stipulated check-in time, the front desk was kind enough to help us arrange a room to store our luggage, and then gave us the second room that was cleaned later when we came back from playing.
Regarding the heating, the heating was too hot. It was kept at 25 degrees in the room. Turning off the heating and opening the windows had little effect. I was woken up by the heat every night and felt like I was living in an oven. Or maybe a small blanket instead of a quilt?
Regarding the exhaust fan in the bathroom, I never heard any sound and I don't know if it is turned on. The front desk explained that it was a silent exhaust fan. My idea is that silence is good, but at least there should be an indicator light to let passengers know whether the exhaust fan is on. There is an indicator light on the switch, but it remains off no matter how you press it.
Regarding Wi-Fi, it is super slow, which is inconvenient for people like us who use foreign mobile phones, domestic mobile phones have relatively small data traffic, and rely more on Wi-Fi.

There are also two subway lines in the city, which is also very convenient for travel. The hotel is also close to Sanlitun, Works and Sports, and it takes about twenty minutes to walk. You can get there, it‚Äôs faster if you ride on your own. The hotel's king-bed room is fully equipped, and there are also snacks, drinks and home meals at your own expense. The bathroom is larger, with a bathtub for sitz bath and a shower room for showering. The sink is large, with hot and cold water, and the bathroom is fully equipped. The air conditioning in the room is easy to adjust, the large bed is comfortable, there is a safe and bathrobe in the wardrobe, and there is a laundry service for clothes and shoes. The room is well soundproofed and very quiet without any disturbance. The hotel provides a variety of breakfast foods, including Western and Chinese buffets. All in all, the stay was a good experience.

I was smoking at the gate and saw a female guest checking into the hotel with two big boxes. Your doorman seemed not to see the female guest. Take down the big box alone! You didn‚Äôt even say to help! If it's a male guest, I won't say anything. In short, the doorman (or doorman) standing at the door doesn't see anything that needs help, so it's useless to leave him alone at the door! This bad review!

The soundproofing of the room was extremely poor, and there was a lot of noise next door in the middle of the night, which affected our rest and almost caused us to miss our next trip.
The hotel lost the breakfast order. The waiter in the breakfast room said she couldn't see the breakfast order and refused to let her eat. She also made excuses and couldn't leave to confirm with the front desk. She also refused to call. She looked like I was cheating her of a breakfast. Tell her. The front desk is also unwilling to take the initiative to deal with it.

msg:I have stayed at this hotel many times. The overall feeling is good and the location is good. But this time I checked in, I felt disgusted with the supervisor. The buffet breakfast was outsourced and cost 170 yuan per person. The dishes were extremely ordinary. The dining environment was deserted and depressing. The simplest coffee machine only dispensed a small amount of Americano coffee, and then filled it with half a cup. Boiling water, there is no switch on it, I feel that I must/can only or be forced to drink this cup of extremely diluted coffee, there is no other choice... To be fair, Baifuyi's buffet breakfast is 170 yuan per person, 50 yuan is enough Not qualified. The gym is also outsourced, and is guarded by dedicated personnel, who will determine whether you are qualified to exercise based on the price of the house, especially the gym. Isn‚Äôt it standard for a five-star hotel to provide free fitness facilities? ! Compared with the 24-hour gymnasium in Xudu's five-star hotel where you can enter and exit freely by swiping your card, how can Baifu Yiqing be so inferior? If you are so shameless, you can't do anything.
Traveling by high-speed rail the next day, I stayed at the Beijing Kyoto Xinyuan Hotel, also a five-star hotel near Beijing West Railway Station. The buffet breakfast was 60 yuan per person, with rich dishes and a self-service coffee machine with a variety of choices. It can be seen that the employer also made money for 60 yuan per person, and Consumers are happy to see this and admire the hotel's management of the business in a sound and profitable manner. No wonder
It is very popular and booming... It is strongly recommended that Baifuyi's supervisors go to Kyoto Xinyuan to study hard and ask themselves whether you are serving consumers and making money, or you are just amassing money to the extreme.

Seeing that we have two children, she took the initiative to upgrade our room, giving us a great accommodation experience.
The room is spacious and clean, and the bathroom is well-equipped. You swipe your card in the elevator and the takeout is placed in the takeout cabinet outside. No outsiders will come in, giving you a sense of security. Thanks to the considerate cleaning lady Lu Xianghong. Sister Lu, the room is neatly tidied and clean every time she comes back. Also, we have children who give us two extra bottles of water each time. All the staff are super friendly. Every time I see my baby when I go out, they say hello to them and play with them.

Baifuyi Hotel is located in Dongzhimen. There are many snack bars nearby and the prices are reasonable. We just take a taxi when we go out and it's very convenient to go anywhere. I will stay here next time I go to Beijing with my family.

Service: Poor, very arrogant, arrogant, low efficiency, no service attitude at all. Because I stayed here for the whole 4 nights, there is no way to compare. I don‚Äôt know if all hotels in Beijing are like this. Anyway, this hotel refreshed me. Perception of hotel services;

msg:Judging from this experience, I originally wanted to give it one star, but I gave it one more star for the environment... The facilities, environment, service, and sanitation are really good, (very, very good!) I just don't know what the hotel's senior management thinks. The short comment is 1. The deposit can't be paid in full. If you don't inform in advance, it will destroy your travel plan. 2. There are very few people at the service desk, no matter how busy it is every time, there is no need to wait when you go down.
1. First of all, I will live in 688 for one day on the first day. You asked me to pay a deposit of 1,000, and I have already lived in Bengbu... You should tell me in advance that I will tell me when I have paid online and paid at the place! Disrupt me directly travel budget planning
Second, it is convenient to stay for another 2 days later. The first day was fine, but the next day I went down to get a takeaway and I couldn't clean the elevator and the door. I went to the front desk and waited for a long time and was still busy, so I called another person to come. After 3 seconds, I swiped the elevator for me and told me that he had left beforehand... Then I went upstairs and found that the door was closed and ran down again , the front desk waits for them to be busy. After I was busy, I told me to pay another 688 deposit...why not take it from yesterday when I extended my stay?? And I came to the front desk this morning and asked, "I'll extend my stay for another day, can it be done like this?" Look at her, she said "yes" while she was busy, and she didn't talk to me about refreshing the room card and ignored me...

All in all, it is worth living, but there are really problems with these two points!! I really don't understand why you don't hire more people? The service desk is so long - just stand one or two front desks, there is really no need to hire less to save money ... Higher-ups, please have some snacks (-`„Çß¬¥-anger)

The facade is nice, and the lobby is okay too.

Facilities: The room is very big, I joked with my foreign colleagues that I can dance in the room. However, there is a very strong smell in the room, which should be caused by the underground tunnel. This problem should be difficult to solve.

Service: The front desk is a bit slow. The room card was refunded after 9:00 in the morning, and when it was almost 2:00 noon, they called me to ask if I would like to stay? Four hours in the middle, I don't know why they didn't check the room?

Breakfast: This is the worst place ever. I thought it was a Japanese restaurant and had very high expectations, but the service turned out to be very mediocre. At the same time, I saw reptiles in the fruit, which should be centipedes.
I told several of their waiters that there was no response, and finally one of them came over without apologizing, and just took away a big pot, and brought back another big pot in less than a minute. Seeing such a situation, I couldn't even eat breakfast.

It is impossible to stay in such a hotel for the second time, alas :-(

msg:The security guard went to work without training. When I checked in at the hotel, I asked the guests to find a parking space by themselves. After searching for half an hour, I couldn't find it. I reported this situation to the front desk and upgraded the room type for us. I thought it would be okay, but the result was great. , after the upgrade, there are four bathrooms. The toilets in the four bathrooms are all disposable. I can‚Äôt pump water anymore after the second time... I think it‚Äôs very late, it‚Äôs already 11 or 12 o‚Äôclock. I‚Äôll just give you feedback tomorrow. I didn't bother and endured it until the morning. I called the master to come and repair it in the morning. It was repaired until we checked out of the room and it was still not repaired...
The next morning, the security guard refused to allow takeout to be delivered to the front desk. He also did not make it clear to the delivery person that he had to contact the concierge. That is to say, if he was not allowed to deliver the food, he could only go to the takeout counter. If he called me for delivery, the switchboard would transfer to the front desk, and the front desk would transfer to the concierge. , the concierge said there was no takeout, so I called again and asked where the delivery was. Then the security guard asked the concierge to come out to pick it up. I transferred the call again and asked the concierge to come out to pick it up, so the concierge‚Äôs job should include picking up the takeout. Go to the front desk and put the robot there, but when you call the concierge for the first time, you just pretend to be stupid and say there is no takeout. It is best for the guests to come down and get it themselves. The security and concierge facilities of this hotel are beyond words, and there will be no second time! When I checked out the next day and asked the front desk to tell me that the security guard would be working the next day, he would not go to work unless he was well trained. This was the most unpleasant stay in Beijing. There will be no next time! Bad review, bad review!

msg:Location: The hotel is about 10-15 minutes walk from Dongzhimen Subway Station on Line 2. It is relatively easy to find. There are also one or two business districts in the direction of the subway station, which is generally convenient.
Service: I went on a business trip, and I arrived late, around 9:00 p.m., and there was a little girl at the front desk. The service attitude was very good, and the processing speed was also very fast. However, when I checked out the next morning, it was quite chaotic. The front desk There are obviously two waiters, and there are no other customers except me. One of the waiters directly guides me to another counter, and then I start counting money by myself, but there is an internal employee standing in front of the other waiter, who seems to want her to deal with things , printing materials, etc., I stood and waited for a while, but the other party saw me, but did not respond, did not ask me to wait a while, and did not give any explanation, just kept doing my own things, because I was on a business trip, I was in a hurry to attend a meeting, so after waiting for a while, I took the initiative to ask how long I had to wait, and then the other party communicated with my colleagues, and another waiter came out from the back to check me out. This kind of service feels very bad, I I don't think it is the level of service that a 5-star hotel should have.
Hygiene: The lobby of the hotel is quite grand, with an old-fashioned style. Looking at the lobby alone, you can see that the positioning is on the high side. However, as a hotel opened in 2013, the details and facilities are very average, the rooms feel old, and the carpet is dirty , The sound of the central air conditioner is also relatively loud, this is not the key point, the key point is that there is a hair on the bed sheet! ! I felt nauseous at that time, but because it was late after washing and tidying up, and I was very tired, so I cleaned up a little bit, and slept on the other side of the bed without changing the room. One night, generally speaking, it must not reach the level of a five-star hotel! !

You can look at the towels in his house, they are all black and torn towels used by other hotels as rags, and his house is still used by guests. The worst thing is the front desk service. As a five-star hotel, there is no minimum enthusiasm, service with a smile, an expression like they owe them money, and a lack of basic induction training. If you are used to staying in five-star hotels, this hotel is highly not recommended!

The area is considered large at this price, but it is not too close to the subway station, especially when you have luggage and go shopping for a day on a May Day trip, it is quite painful to walk out of the subway for ten minutes. In addition, the surrounding supporting facilities are not enough (maybe I didn‚Äôt understand the neighborhood, and I basically made a living by taking out for a few days)
The orientation of the check-in is not good, there is no view from the window, and it is very close to the opposite building, and we can basically see each other, so the experience is not good.
The overall facilities of the hotel are quite complete, there is a small refrigerator, and there is a clothesline in the bathroom, but the sink is not very clean, and the water in the shower room is a bit slow. I brought a disposable bathtub cover myself, which is considered a beautiful bath.
Finally, I would like to praise the aunt in the guest room, who helped take away the takeaway garbage in time every day, and made supplies, because a family of three specially gave three copies

Slow down the elevator, takeaways cannot enter the hotel, it can be completely ignored! As a Beijinger, I will choose you Baifuyi when I return to Beijing!

msg:I booked a 4.1-4.6 superior double room on Ctrip. I was very happy to check in. The hotel room was much bigger than I expected, and the front desk was also very good. Seeing that I had a lot of luggage, she let me go up to the room first. She found Someone helped me carry my luggage up. But once you move in, the nigh**are begins! ! !
The first is the hardware of the room. I changed two lights on the first day and two more on the third day. Yes, there are only 6 lights in the whole room, and I changed 4 of them for three days. . . . There is also the wifi in the hotel. I didn‚Äôt connect to it on the first night. They said that the Apple mobile phone is so often that it can‚Äôt connect and it takes a few more tries, but my mobile phone has been tested no less than 30 times and still can‚Äôt connect. . Connected the next day. The hotel's network is so poor, and there are so many people using iPhones, how much patience does the hotel need for each iPhone to enjoy your network? ?
The second is the hotel's software. I reported a bad check-in experience through Ctrip. The lobby manager sent me a fruit plate to express my apology, but the fruit knife was also unwilling to borrow it. I understand that fruit knives are sharp tools and cannot be kept in the room, but you Bring it up to me, I'll cut it up on the spot, can't you take it away? Otherwise, do you want me to eat kiwis and oranges with their skins? ? But it‚Äôs okay if I didn‚Äôt send a knife. After tasting a small bite of the kiwi fruit, my teeth became sore and I threw it away.
I called the front desk on the night of the 5th and said that I would check out on the 6th, because I had to work during the day and would check out in the morning, but I had some food that needed to be refrigerated in the refrigerator, so I wanted to borrow their refrigerator and pick up the luggage from the hotel after work I took it away with me when I arrived, and I communicated with the front desk to put it in the refrigerator for me, but when I checked out the next morning, the front desk refused me! ! ! She said that what she communicated with me last night was that the new employees were not proficient in business. . I check out at 14:00 according to the regulations. I went to pick up my things at 18:00. I just want to borrow your refrigerator for 4 hours, and the things are very few and will not take up much space. There is no problem in changing to another hotel. I I don't know why it's so difficult in Baifuyi. After repeated communication many times early in the morning, I disagree. Maybe it's because I'm leaving soon and don't need to serve any more. I've stayed in the hotel so many times, whether it's a business trip or going out for fun, every time is very pleasant, even if there are occasional communication problems, the hotel can solve them quickly, this is the first time I deeply feel, What is mental and physical exhaustion. .

msg:Service: I arrived at night, and the security guard at the gate was so arrogant that he yelled to move aside. A waiter at the front desk checked in. The subway station is far from the hotel. I was thirsty after walking. I asked him to get a bottle of water, but he said he didn't have it. This is the first time I have stayed in so many hotels that there is no one to drink water at the front desk. You have to have a free glass of water when you eat in the hotel. The hotel sells family rooms for 4 people, but they give two sets of toothbrushes, slippers, two bottles of water, etc. mean. It can be said that there is no service. I am here to consume, not to listen to the shouting of that **** at your door. The service staff should also have their own professional ethics.
Hygiene: After the child and his family checked in for the first day, they had small red bumps and dots on their bodies. Please consider your own health conditions.
There was only one extra point: the cleaning attendant saw that the child was not feeling well, so he brought two extra rolls of toilet paper. He also asked us to find an induction cooker and let us cook some porridge for the child. It is good for the body. At least he had this intention. , and also made people feel the warmth of the people in the capital.
After leaving the hotel, I called to ask about my stay experience. I mentioned that my child had red spots on his body after staying here. I didn‚Äôt ask how his body was now and whether there were any red spots. Instead, I was worried about bad reviews. I first said that he would give me a fruit plate next time I checked in. Do you have a fruit plate? I don‚Äôt know where the good reviews come from.
This is the first time I have given a negative review, please choose carefully!

Disgustingü§¢, after some investigation, the front desk clerk told me that it is for one person only. Did I make my own mistake? The hotel has been told that it does not require any compensation or discounts and it has nothing to do with the cost. It is just recommended to self-examine and correct why such a high-end hotel would have such a situation. I will never choose to stay here again.

msg:The first bad review in my life gave this hotel
A hotel with a very bad experience‚ùå
It is not recommended for everyone to stay ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
First of all, Ctrip is bidding on a five-star hotel. Charge the money of a high-end hotel, but the service is not as good as that of an express hotel

First of all: (Picture 1) We have five or six boxes, and no one from the concierge came to help. Standing alone watching us take it I said can't you help? He said sorry to me that there is no one now, they are going to deliver things to the guests, so can you help me? Stand and watch the whole process.
Secondly: the toilet didn't flush after we got to the room, and we didn't even think about taking pictures because the pictures were so disgusting. We booked two rooms and one living room for four people, but only two bottles of mineral water were given, which were still small bottles. Is this the service of a five-star hotel?
Third: The hotel has a robot to deliver food, but they don‚Äôt pick it up for us. They say we are an apar**ent and don‚Äôt deliver. You don‚Äôt have to go to the takeaway cabinet next to the outdoor security booth in the lobby to pick it up by yourself. When I asked them where the takeaway cabinet was, they casually pointed to the outside and told me the location for a person staying in your hotel for the first time. It wasn't obvious but they were impatient.
Finally: The front desk is so big that only two desks are opened, and three front desks help one guest to go through the formalities. I came down and checked out the room and waited for half an hour. In a hurry. And we will not disclose a lot of information when we check in. When I parked my car, I asked the security guard if parking at the hotel is free. The security guard told us that we need to ask for a parking ticket at the front desk. Isn't this the job of the front desk? At that time, in order not to get out of the car and go to the front desk to ask for a ticket to affect others, we paid the parking fee ourselves.

Write it out for everyone to avoid lightning. The hotel does not need to contact me to ask me to delete the bad review

After arriving, I got a surprise: Xiao Fan and Xiao An, the two children at the front desk, are so caring. I must thank Xiao Fan here... The children are very nice. Seeing that the four of us are adults, we have upgraded to a bigger and more beautiful place for free. The big family room made me happy when I entered the room. It was neat, clean, comfortable and warm... I booked for 4 days in a row, and the stay was very comfortable. I liked it very much. I decided to come to Beijing in the future, and Baifuyi Hotel is the only choice. There is no uniqueness. It's unexpected to have such a cost-effective hotel in the second ring road of Beijing! thank you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I booked two nights in advance on Ctrip and planned to stay three nights on the day I arrived. So when I checked in, the front desk asked me to pay a two-night deposit. I said I would probably stay three days and pay three nights. As a result, the deposit was swiped for 3 nights and the room card was swiped for two nights. On the third day, I found out that I had to swipe the room card for two nights when I couldn't get on the elevator. Then I went to the front desk to swipe the card, but the front desk said that the room price was going to increase. I said why didn't you mention the third day's room rate when you swiped my pre-authorization when checking in? What a üî• person. In the end, I couldn't resist them, so I discounted the price increase and paid it off. But things were very unpleasant and the stay experience was not good. I will not go there again in the future.

It can be seen that the management of this hotel is very generous. Let‚Äôs talk about the room. This is the best B&B I‚Äôve ever stayed in, bar none. It‚Äôs said to be a B&B, but the overall feeling is similar to a hotel, clean and tidy. The hotel service staff are humble and courteous, responsive to requests, and can also help to get express delivery to the room. This room definitely made a big contribution to making this trip to Beijing so happy and comfortable! I rarely write reviews unless it's really better than I imagined.

The hotel lobby is quite grand, the location is 15 minutes walk from the subway, because I am going to the embassy to do business, so this location is very convenient.
But what I'm not satisfied with is that it was about 1:30 p.m. when I checked out, which was a full half-hour delay. I have already complained about the details, so I won't go into details. The front desk staff of the hotel still need to strengthen training, familiarize themselves with the process, and improve the efficiency of check-in and check-out. The service at the front desk is the face of the hotel, and it is the first impression of guests when they check in and the impression after they leave the store.

The room facilities are a little older, and the sanitation environment is not bad.
The service is basically unexperienced, and the takeaway has to go to the express cabinet outside to get it cold. I hope this can be improved.

It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dongzhimen subway station.
There is a takeaway cabinet behind the guard box at the entrance of the parking lot. The takeaway staff are not allowed to enter the hotel, and guests need to go downstairs to pick up the takeaway.
The "pre-authorization" of the apar**ent was used, but it was actually used as a "deposit" for consumption. After many communications when checking out, the front desk also operated the "refund" on the same day to arrive at the account.
There are three elevators in the apar**ent, and the high-rises often have to wait for a long time to get the elevators, and the cleaning staff often push large work carts and ride with the guests, which is rare in star-rated hotels.
I also experienced it during the stay. On the night of check-in, due to the clogged sewer in the shower room, the shower room could not be drained during the shower, so... I also tried not being able to connect to the Internet... the cleaning was not in place, etc., and the hotel gave timely solutions.

msg:The work efficiency of front desk staff needs to be improved. I booked an apar**ent room, which is not on the same side as the hotel. The front desk did not make it clear. I took the room card and changed it several times and said that the room card could not be swiped. I went up and down three times, but the front desk did not remind me. During the period, there was a foreigner who was supposed to have a room renewal issue, and the two staff members worked on it for a long time. The receptionist in the lobby at the back saw me running back and forth and told me that the apar**ent hotel was on the other side. He was very enthusiastic and took me up there just in case the card still couldn't be swiped out. The receptionist was tall and had a lot of facial hair.
On the last day, we took a taxi at the door. My grandparents and I were holding large and small suitcases at the door. When the greeter outside came, he didn‚Äôt help us put our luggage on it. Instead, he was jokingly complaining to his colleagues about the fact that we had just left a suitcase for a foreigner. When someone takes a taxi, they just put them in the car without helping others.
The hotel environment and location are pretty good, and it should be considered a four-star hotel. However, the training of service staff that can be seen from the outside needs to be improved, and their basic English skills need to be trained.

msg:The location of the hotel is good, high-end a**osphere, room size is large enough, the price is not expensive in Beijing, I have to give 5 points, but two points are not very comfortable: 1. Because I feel good after checking in on the first day, I don‚Äôt want to change I booked the hotel for 4 days. I wanted to stay for another 2 days. I told the front desk staff (a male) that I booked it on Ctrip. I have to tell Ctrip that he has no right. Then, contact me I signed up with Ctrip, and Ctrip said that it can operate online by itself. I said that the current extension is more than 100 more expensive than my original reservation, and although it is an extension, it is also two days in advance. Can I use the price of the previous reservation, and then Ctrip will ask He said he had no right to contact the hotel. In the end, he couldn‚Äôt pay the price booked before. I just called the air and asked for loneliness. Whether it‚Äôs a hotel or Ctrip, is this considered a service?
2. The sanitation is really not good. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the facilities are old, but you have to clean the sanitation. Is it because of the extended stay that the sanitation can be cleaned every other day? Besides, basically our room has been tidied up, and it is still the same when we come back later. Do we need to clean it when it is dirty and messy?
3. In view of the hotel's cost performance and hope to get better and better, I still gave 4 points in the above two points.

3. There is a shower gel for the third night, but there are new problems. When I got up in the morning and opened the new toothbrush box, I found that the toothpaste inside had been unpacked. I seriously suspected that the hotel had recycled these disposable products.
4. Generally speaking, except for the relatively large housing area, the rest is not up to the standard of a good hotel. In addition, travel is not very convenient. The subway station is about 10 minutes away from the hotel by bicycle. Most shared bicycles are across the road, and there are fewer cars on the side of the hotel.

The fly in the oin**ent is that there is a delay in check-in. It may be that the front desk and room cleaning did not communicate clearly, and they did not enjoy the early check-in at 10 o'clock. Because of the nearly 20-hour international flight, I was too tired. After urging twice, I waited for almost two hours before checking in. In this regard, a little regret.

I forgot to bring the key card and wait for more than ten minutes to open the door. I was drunk. I just bought a three-day-old Bose earphone that fell in the elevator and slipped into the crevice. , I contacted the hotel to help find it, but it turned out that I couldn‚Äôt find it. Losing one is equivalent to being useless~~ In short, the various experiences are so bad that they explode, just how bad is it?

The hotel can apply for a room upgrade. The booked studio can be upgraded to a one-bedroom room for free. The room is more than 90 square meters and is very large. The only downside is that there is no robot to deliver food, and you have to pick it up at the express cabinet for outside purchases, which is a bit out of line with the development trend. The overall experience is excellent.

Service: I did not book this room, but the front desk upgraded me. The lady at the front desk, Xiao Zhang, has a very good service attitude. She saw that I arrived at the hotel early in the morning, and she upgraded me before the room I reserved was sold out. A room of 160 square meters

msg:3.17 I stayed in a super large twin room for my family, which brought me the worst experience I have ever had!
Let me talk about the disadvantages of this hotel objectively:
1. The environment is very poor
There is a stuffy, damp and old smell that no one has stayed in all year round, and the water pressure is also very strange
2. Poor signal
Under the premise of 5G coverage, I really can't imagine that there are still places in Beijing with 2G, and it takes half a minute to send a 10-character WeChat message
3. There is always noise in the room
I don't know if it's the sound of electric current or what, but there is always a strange sound in the room
4. It‚Äôs an apar**ent not a hotel
I originally thought that the family twin room is different from the apar**ent twin room. It is a hotel and not an apar**ent, but it is actually an apar**ent (the wording has changed now, but it was very confusing before)
5. The hotel service is not in place
There was a conflict after check-in, and I checked out at 12:30 in the morning, but the hotel is still unwilling to refund

Tell me what happened:
I booked two nights on 2.25 for 3.17 and 3.18 [Family Oversized Twin Room] Ctrip credit live to pay at the store, because I was not sure about the journey at the time, so I booked separately in two days.
At about 21:30 on the night of 3.17, after visiting Universal Studios, I took a taxi and came to the hotel to check in. The hotel front desk told us that the [Family Super Twin Studio] is no longer available, but they can help us upgrade to a 160-square-meter [Twin Two-Bedroom Room] „Äë. The hotel gave us a key. I was a little surprised why it was a key instead of a room card, but we still went to the room with our takeaway and luggage. The room was at the end of the corridor.
After entering, we found that the room was completely different from what we had imagined and what was shown in the photos. There was no soft decoration in the room and it looked very empty, and the lighting was dim. Once we entered the room, the hairs stood on end. The two rooms were separated by an empty living room. The three girls were really a little scared to sleep. Then we went downstairs and asked to change back to the room we booked, saying that the room was too spacious and we were afraid at the end of the corridor. The hotel responded that they could not provide the room type we booked but could change us to a [two-bedroom] room in the middle of the corridor.
We compromised, and a male manager in the lobby took us to check in, and was very enthusiastic to help us with various takeaways. Before entering the room, the manager knocked on the door and said room service a few times before opening the door and entering the room. At that moment, my heart skipped a beat. After entering the room, I found that the room had a humid and stuffy smell that no one lived in all year round, but we were embarrassed to check out again due to the enthusiasm of the manager + the takeaway was going to be cold, we checked into this room at about 22:30.
After checking in, when I ate takeaway, I found that the signal in the room was extremely poor and there was always a sound like electric current. My companion and I are planning to bite the bullet and stay for one night first, and then change rooms or hotels the next day. The last straw that broke the camel's back was when my partner went to take a shower at 0:00 and was afraid that she would let us stay in the same room with her, and when she took a shower, she found that the water pressure was too high and the water splashed all over the floor. We found that this room is not ok anywhere. If staying here is a torture to our body and mind, we choose to change hotels.
At 12:30 in the morning, we cleaned up the food on the table and went downstairs with our suitcases to check out and get a refund, but the manager refused us. he thinks:
1. We did not express dissatisfaction at the time of check-in, which means we accepted the room (even though it was not the room type we booked)
2. We should be grateful to Dade for upgrading us from a 40-square-meter twin-bed room to a 160-square-meter two-bedroom
3. We booked credit accommodation through Ctrip, so we should use the Ctrip platform
4. Because it is a credit card, if we don‚Äôt live, we still need to pay
After the communication failed, I chose to call the police. When the police came, they said that the police didn't care about this. We should find consumer rights or cultural tourism and left. (During the period, the manager even accused the three of us of being from Shanghai. He might want to give the police the impression that we are picky and pretentious.)
At this time, I found out that because I booked one night and one night separately, I can cancel the hotel reservation for the second night for free, so I asked the hotel to refund the second night‚Äôs room fee + a deposit of 1,000 yuan, which is on duty tonight The manager does not have authority, we will discuss it later after shelving the dispute.
We left the hotel at 1:30 in the morning, booked a new hotel at the gate and took a taxi. I only have one sentence: as long as this hotel can be used for one night, the three of us girls will not drag our suitcases to change hotels at 1:30 in the morning in a different place after a day of high-intensity play! ! !
At the same time, I contacted Ctrip's artificial customer service and told me about my unpleasant stay experience tonight. The customer service said that she would communicate with the hotel. The answers I got on Saturdays and Sundays were that the managers of the hotel and Ctrip were on weekends off and would reply me after work on Mondays.
The answer I got on Monday was that the hotel was still unwilling to refund, and no one from the hotel came to communicate with me or understand the situation. I don't know what to be proud of.

There is a washing machine in the room for washing clothes, a refrigerator enough for fruit drinks, a drying rack on the balcony, and comfortable beds and bedding. It is a pity that the family twin room is in an apar**ent building. The windows of this room type face the inner court, there is no view, and the light is very ordinary. It's not close to the subway or places to eat, and the main way to get out is to take a taxi. But the overall living is still very comfortable, the gym on the 2nd floor is also very complete, clean and the environment is good, recommended.

The sheets were dirty on the first day of check-in, and they had to change to another five-star hotel on the third day. They were greedy for cheap, especially during the Spring Festival. Remember!

The equipment of the apar**ent is relatively complete: disinfection cupboards, refrigerators, microwave ovens (note that not all rooms have these). If you need tableware, you need to contact the hotel in advance (compared with the Marriott apar**ent hotel you have stayed in before, there are fewer types of pots in the room, and the stove is an open fire. You may need to bring some handy tools to compete during your stay. ). The family is satisfied with the room. The water pressure in the guest shower was insufficient, it would be better if the experience could be improved. The hotel staff are more enthusiastic, and they still insist on working during the Spring Festival. It's hard work!

The family room is in the apar**ent building, and it is relatively safe to swipe the card to the floor. In the entire apar**ent building, there is a confinement center on the first floor, and some long-term tenants will meet them in the elevator. The lights in the corridor are a bit dim. The room we live in is like a single apar**ent. There is a washing machine and a kitchen sink. When we checked in, the front desk said that if we need an induction cooker, we can ask for it, but we don‚Äôt need it when we are traveling. There are many living quarters near the hotel, so it is quiet amidst the noise.
For breakfast, you can order takeaway to the lobby (but takeaway is usually delivered to the courier cabinet next to the parking lot downstairs of the hotel). We go out from the hotel for about 3 minutes. Breakfast on the first floor of Hongmendi Hotel can also be packed and taken away, which is very convenient , there are many choices.
The hotel is also close to Guijie Street, but you still need to take a taxi, the starting price looks like.
I heard that there are nucleic acids near the hotel, but I didn't go there because I was playing outside during the day.

The sound insulation is average, but this is not a problem, but the overall impression of the hotel is that it is stingy and the service attitude is uneven. In the off-season, if you can't upgrade the room after consultation, it's fine, the front desk supervisor is the same The people still look disdainful and don‚Äôt even look at you. They ordered the clothes to be sent for laundry. One of my sweaters was considered to be a coat and I needed to pay extra. First of all, the price difference of 10 yuan is worth a special call to tell me to change the order. , In addition, my sweater is very thin and has no zipper. It is not a jacket at all and I don‚Äôt know why I need to change it. I probably want to earn the extra 10 yuan. When I came back, the cleaning lady accidentally took the power card away. I told the front desk that the power card was taken away, and the front desk told me indifferently to go downstairs to get another one. My own card was taken away, but I was also surprised by the logic that I had to go to the front desk to get it again. , I understand that this is not a high-end hotel, but the few times I encountered it really broke down. When I checked in, the professional and attentive impression that the boy at the front desk had created was ruined bit by bit.

msg:This time I chose Baifuyi for my business trip to Beijing. At the beginning, I just felt that the transportation was very convenient, so I made a reservation for two days to test the waters.
I didn't expect to be so lucky. The original room type was sold out. The lady at the front desk upgraded us to a two-bedroom suite.
(Speaking of the ladies at the front desk, I would like to praise the two ladies Liang Yingying and Han Xiao for their excellent service attitude and kindness ‚ô•Ô∏è)
Definitely the first choice next time you come to Beijing!
The transportation can basically be done for more than ten yuan. It is very convenient to go back to the hotel and go to the high-speed rail station. Recommended
