The room is large and well-equipped, the service is also very good, and the breakfast is rich in variety. In particular, the swimming pool in the fitness center on the 6th floor is very popular with children. The children had a lot of fun. It's just that there happened to be an important guest staying in the hotel this time, and security checks were required in and out, which delayed us a bit. But it's all for everyone's safety, and I understand. Everything else is very good. I will choose InterContinental again next time if I have the chance.

In these four years, I stayed in many top luxury hotels, such as Bulgari, Rosewood, Four Seasons, Aman, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton... InterContinental Hotel is already an ordinary business hotel for me, but four years ago, it still gave me good memories. I am very grateful to the duty manager Lee.L for his warm and polite reception this time. Although I checked in very late, the hotel arranged it properly and it still did not lose the face of a five-star hotel. The breakfast is still so rich and delicious, but I still have to make a suggestion: learn more from Hong Kong hotels. InterContinental Guangzhou Poly Hotel was only opened in 2018, and the maintenance is really not enough, and it looks a little old... Thanks again to the hotel and Lee for the hospitality.

As one of the best hotels in Guangzhou, InterContinental is still ranked first. The hotel decoration is still very business-like, but the river view is a bit hard to describe. But to be honest, the sunset in the lounge is still very beautiful, and of course the products in the lounge are also good. (It's still a day to persuade people to book an executive room.)

msg:During the New Year, I took the elderly and children to visit Guangzhou. I chose Poly InterContinental Hotel. It is worthy of being called a five-star hotel. Both the front desk reception and room service are warm and friendly. The service is in place. As long as you have a need, just talk to the housekeeper and the problem will be solved quickly. Especially the day before check-in, the housekeeper will communicate the needs in advance and make arrangements, which improves the efficiency of check-in. Arrived on New Year's Day and received a warm welcome. I must praise the housekeeper Lee here. He is not only handsome, but also enthusiastic and very professional. Because there are elderly people in their seventies and children in the company, for the convenience of taking care of us, they tried their best to arrange them on the same floor for us. The elderly have been upgraded to suites free of charge, so that the whole family can enjoy a good time together. We were also given welcome gifts during the period, including warm New Year greeting cards and small desserts. The hotel's attentive service made us feel as comfortable, secure and warm as celebrating the New Year at home.
The hotel is very clean, the beds are comfortable and soft, and the breakfast is rich in variety and delicious. The breakfast is buffet. If you particularly like their cakes or coffee, the waiter will help you pack a copy and bring it to your room to taste. This kind of large-scale service attitude makes me happy. The guest's mood became particularly happy. The surrounding environment of the hotel is also very beautiful. At night, you can overlook the night view of the Pearl River from the room, and you can also see the graceful waist of the Canton Tower. It's worth staying here. Next time I go to Guangzhou, I will choose to stay at the Guangzhou Intercontinental International Hotel.

If you call us if you need it, it will be delivered promptly. In addition, the staff who clean the room are so considerate. Our room is very messy, but they help us fold it neatly every day. It feels very good! The only regret is that although the breakfast was good, there was a little change, and I felt a little tired after eating it for several days.

I asked for a heater, but no adapter was given. There was a problem with the phone in the room, and the service desk was always unavailable. The front desk didn't deliver food, so I had to go down and get it myself. There was no robot to deliver food, which was very inconvenient. In short, the stay experience was average, or even poor. The location is far from various attractions, and the only consideration is the relatively cheap price.

msg:Guangzhou Poly InterContinental Hotel: Side note of the Guangzhou Auto Show

The first time I hosted the Guangzhou Auto Show was in 2006. Up to now, I have hosted the Guangzhou International Auto Show the most times in China. Because of this special experience, I am extremely familiar with the hotels around the auto show. If you are closer, you can stay at Westin and Langham Place; if you are further away, you can stay at Shangri-La and InterContinental. Among these four, InterContinental is the latest to open. Despite this, as a Diamond Ambassador, I have stayed there many times. For such an extremely powerful Chinese owner, even if you are a repeat customer many times, it is of no use. They will strictly implement the group's standards and it is impossible to plunder the wool. Because in their perception, they feel: Upgrading you is a sign of affection, and not giving you an upgrade is a duty (so, under normal circumstances, they will never give you extra suite benefits or administrative trea**ent. If you want to upgrade, then Sorry, please obediently take out the exchange coupon or add money).‚Äã‚Äã

The hotel is only a few hundred meters away from Exit D of Wanshengwei Subway Station. It is surrounded by almost all Poly-related buildings, including large shopping malls and resettlement communities (compared to the resettlement buildings in the north, the Pazhou Village is too high-end and regular. ), high-end communities, office buildings (reminiscent of the album cover of Sound Toy, but it is a photo of Shanghai J Center, anyway, I think it is similar), etc., it is super convenient to do anything. There is a pagoda next to it. The so-called pagoda suppresses the river demon. This is what it is talking about, haha. The hotel's high-end rooms have a view of the Pearl River, but the paradox is that when the occupancy rate was extremely low this time, I was not given a corner room and was given a very cramped room. The SPA has also changed its brand. I have never heard of it and dare not go there again.‚Äã‚Äã

The highlights of breakfast are nothing more than seafood porridge, freshly squeezed juice and ice cream. The division of the members' area is not obvious, or even non-existent. The coffee capsules in the breakfast room and guest rooms are both flat, but the former uses Nespresso, and the latter uses Bosch coffee machines and French Lor capsules. When I checked in, I specifically emphasized the need to issue a paper invoice, but the electronic invoice was issued to me in advance the next morning and was sent to my email. I couldn't change it. How could I be so careless? It's so disrespectful. If it's a distinguished guest, a VIP, or a big star, you wouldn't dare do that, right? This was not the case when I checked in before. The software has greatly deteriorated.‚Äã‚Äã

There are quite a lot of foreign executives and employees in hotels (the same goes for Haixinsha Indigo). However, China has long passed the era of foreigners and people who can chant sutras. It should build more cultural confidence and use more local executives and employees. The employees are right. The quality of the welcome fruits and welcome desserts in guest rooms has dropped a lot. They used to have real chocolate every time they came, but now they only have cheap chocolate-coated wafers. Most Poly hotels use bathroom accessories from Japan's Komei. This is different from other InterContinental hotels, such as Poly Holiday in Science City and InterContinental in the exhibition area. In order to celebrate the just-concluded 134th Canton Fair, the hotel room card is designed in the form of a commemorative pattern of the Canton Fair, which is very collectible. Similar to Tianmushan Indigo, it uses environmentally friendly wood.

.
The room is 100 square meters but overall it is not very big <compared to Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Intercontinental>, üöªThe bathroom takes up quite a lot of area. You can see your slim waist from far away, and the river view is quite beautiful.
.
Like the hotel's executive lounge, located on the 39th floor of the hotel. It's open until 11pm, which is the latest administrative hall I've ever encountered. It's especially suitable for coaxing the kids to bed while you can go up to see the night viewüåÉ and have a drink.
.
Things for children to play include: slide beds with bunk bedsüõù, Ludo rugs, tents‚õ∫Ô∏è, and Little Prince projector lamps. The river view bathtub is super bigüõÅ, and two children can swim in it, which is greatüëçüèªIt is recommended to bring your own disposable bathtub cover.
.
There is a room for children opposite the buffet on the second floor of the hotel. There is only a large wave pool and a TV playing cartoons. The other facilities such as drawing boards are useless and cannot be played. It is recommended to modify it.
.
The buffet in the hotel is located on the second floor. Dinner on weekends and holidays is üí∞448/person. It is not cost-effective. It is recommended to come on weekdays. Recently, the theme is hot pot, which is basically based on hot pot ingredients. The sashimi tastes very watery, the ingredients are generally average, not as good as advertised, and the waiter's attitude is very good.
.
If you don‚Äôt live in a parent-child room, the hotel‚Äôs parent-child programs are almost zero üòÇ. But the best thing is that the location is good, close to Wanshengwei subway station. There is a subway museum nearby (I have introduced it before, it requires an appoin**ent, it is highly recommended), and the most beautiful seven-kilometer tram in GuangzhouüöÉ. They are all very classic parent-child activities. Yo. üòò

The variety of afternoon tea is slightly less. But happy hour is great. There is no problem with room hygiene, clean and tidy. The only uncomfortable thing this time was the air conditioning. It's never very cold in the south, especially on New Year's Day when it's muggy. The child was already sick and felt uncomfortable. The air conditioner in the room was very stuffy. The temperature outside in the lobby, walkways, and elevators was more comfortable than in our room. I called customer service and asked engineers to come twice but there was no improvement. The temperature display stayed there unchanged. The engineering staff also came in with a temperature measuring gun to try. Talk about going back to the computer room to adjust. But there is no change. It was too hot to sleep in the second half of the night, and the quilt was all made of thick down quilt. It was already very late with the countdown and I couldn't sleep well. So this trip was a bit regretful.

Booked the same day and checked in two hours later, everything went smoothly. The hotel is next to the Convention and Exhibition Center, and the surrounding transportation is very convenient. There are subway + bus + sightseeing tram Line 1, which is especially convenient for traveling with children. The night before we checked out, we were lucky enough to take the Miniso Disney tram. We could get off at the Exhibition East and Pazhou Bridge South stations, and the hotel was in the middle. The best thing about living here is that there are a lot of delicious food around. Even though there are fewer workers rushing around during holidays, the nearby food street is still very lively at night. If you want to stay in the hotel, there are also many kinds of takeaways. After placing the order, it will be delivered directly to the takeout cabinet next to the elevator on the first floor. Another little surprise during this intercontinental trip is that the hotel assigned us a housekeeper, Claire. If we have any needs, we can send you a message on WeChat. Because there was something wrong with the sink in the room we stayed in, Claire came to the room to check in time and offered to help us. Arrange dinner. After learning that we did not include breakfast, she arranged breakfast for three days of stay. My daughter really liked the handmade biscuits and chocolate beans that the front desk staff gave her when she checked in. She liked the big, soft bed and pillows in the room the most, which were very comfortable, so she and her father slept together until noon the next morning. . Thank you Claire for your considerate service during your stay. See you next time!

The sanitary condition is very good, the facilities are new and complete, and the room layout is reasonable and convenient to use. There is a large shopping mall near the hotel, which is good for eating and shopping. It is convenient to take a taxi without traffic jams. The breakfast buffet is rich and varied, with both Chinese and Western flavors available. The gym is not big but the facilities are pretty good. The water temperature of the swimming pool is a little cooler and you have to grit your teeth to get into the water. The water still feels very clean and the changing rooms are also very hygienic. The service staff were all warm and courteous, making me have a pleasant holiday.

msg:The experience is great, everyone in the hotel is very welcoming and the service is very attentive! Although the Mid-Autumn Festival had already passed when I checked in, I was still heartwarming and received the mooncakes from the hotelü•ÆIt was a pleasant surprise! The only thing that I feel is not very humane is that the charges for children are still different from those in foreign countries. Children nowadays are generally taller. It feels a bit unhumane to use height to determine whether breakfast is charged at full price. It should be based on the child's height. Judging by age! Personally, I think that when children travel together, the expenses incurred should still be paid, but it would be better to have a reasonable judgment standard! I stayed at IHG‚Äôs Locomotive Hotel Khao Yai in Thailand this summer. The fees were charged according to the child‚Äôs age, which felt very thoughtful! But overall it was great, the afternoon tea was also great, the kids loved it! I will choose IHG again in the future.

It was more spacious than the twin room. When I checked in: the toilet light was malfunctioning and the toilet door was malfunctioning. , Fortunately, it was handled in time, and the service attitude was very friendly. They also gave me a small cake. It was the end of the whole day experience. It was not very crowded and still very comfortable. What I like most is that the elevator can only go up by swiping your card to show the floor. It is safe. Safety is pretty high. Some hotels allow you to swipe your card to press the floor, which is not very safe. The shower and shampoo provided are very high-end and fragrant. I also received a mooncake gift box when I checked in, which was very exquisite! The overall experience is pretty good! I'm not a very picky person.

msg:Use Ctrip to book hotels for me! ! ! No one‚Äôs membership is reliable, but you can always trust Ctrip! ! ! The experience of my stay this time was quite poor. The hotel was not very willing to take the initiative to solve the problems that occurred. They worked hard and basically relied on Ctrip to solve and make up for them. They were proactive and considerate.

Order remarks: I would like to arrange a room with a better view, but it has not been arranged. As an ihg elite card member, although the membership system does not reach a certain level for room upgrades, I have stayed in the Pearl River Delta and almost all have been upgraded to at least one level. Last time in Foshan, I was directly upgraded to an executive room. This time, Guangzhou Poly did not upgrade. The reason given was that there was no room. . However, when they paid the price difference to upgrade their house, they had a house again. I arrived after 4pm and asked if I could check out later the next day. No, no, no. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the hotel was tight and impersonal.

When checking in, she didn't take the initiative to tell her where breakfast was served, the opening and closing times, which floor the fitness center was on, the opening and closing times, etc. ~ Ask one by one and answer one by one. If you don't ask, she won't tell. It gives the impression that they are rushing to collect your room fee, arrange a room for you, and ignore the rest~

But U1S1 has a good environment and location. There are shopping malls and restaurants nearby. You can walk along the river near the river. The river view is good. Ihg hardware is guaranteed. The air conditioner is quiet and you can sleep without worries. The service software was down, and the breakfast was not that delicious. It was a bit perfunctory and the taste was average.

Apart from the poor location, there are no other pain points. Booked 3 rooms, all of which are the cheapest room type. This hotel is not parent-child, even if you bring a baby, but for those who don't like children, this is a good choice. The concierge did a great job opening the door for luggage. Check-in efficiency is ok. If you book the cheapest room, it is recommended to ask for twin beds, which are better than double beds. The hardware of the hotel is very good, there is no flaw. It is also equipped with B&O speakers. The swimming pool is a standard 50m pool, and you can swim comfortably. Gym is also ok. The most recommended is the breakfast, which is very good. Thanks to all the staff of the hotel.

The bathing area is large and comfortable The bathtub üõÅ is a nice treat! My brother likes to work at a desk, and behind him is the river view. From time to time, I watch the boats coming and going on the Pearl River, which is very Guangzhou style! The indoor swimming pool on the sixth floor is very large, not many people, and the water quality is also very good. There is also a sauna room and fitness area. Swimming is the best way to relax on vacation! The buffet at Moonlight Restaurant on the 2nd floor is also good. You can cook fresh seafood, steak and lamb chops are also good. My favorite is the dessert area. The blueberry cheesecake is delicious! There are not many people here on weekdays, 5-star enjoyment and the price of the hotel on weekdays is around 1500, the price/performance ratio is very good! Recommended!

msg:The last time I came to Guangzhou was on a business trip in 21 years. It was midnight when I arrived. The lady at the front desk was kind and gave me an upgrade to a suite. So this time I chose InterContinental for my business trip. It was really surprising! I rarely comment this time and I am really speechless! When I checked in at about 5:30 in the afternoon, the guy at the front desk asked me how to pay. I said that I had already paid online and showed him the Ctrip page and bank deduction records. Now I am in a hurry and have to pack up and go out. Can you do it as soon as possible? Or if you swipe my deposit pre-authorization, if you don‚Äôt pay it, you will deduct it directly. He nodded and called to ask, but he couldn‚Äôt find it. He walked away. After waiting for a few minutes, I was anxious and asked another front desk lady next to him, who else? Can you help me take a look? I'm in a hurry and she doesn't even look at me? I reiterate, can you help me take a look? She looked up and said to me, wait a minute. OK, I'll wait. A few minutes later, the guy came over with a smile, as if he had just finished joking with his colleagues? The whole process was really eye-opening. When I returned to the room, I couldn't find the price list in the mini water bar. I called the concierge to ask where the water bar price list was. He said it was on the table. I said I didn't see it. He said if it was a suite, it would be free, and if it was a regular room, it would be charged. I said yes, thank you, and hung up directly! ? It‚Äôs not a big deal but what about being polite? Such poor service in a 2800 hotel! The hand shower in the shower room broke and it sprayed out of control when turned on! It can be seen that the aunt is serious when cleaning! It‚Äôs so frustrating!

The guest attendant changed the room to a parent-child suite for the little prince. The children were very happy when entering the room. I like it, it looks good, but when I lay on the bunk bed to sleep at night, I smelled a strong pungent smell. I endured it and slept another night, but the next night I found that there was something on the child's pajamas and my pajamas. The pungent smell of the bed where I slept the night before.

The dreamy princess purple-toned room makes people feel as if they have fallen into the fairy tale world, and the little girls are even more nostalgic. I believe there will be an additional experience next time! ps: The view of the toilet is top-notch!

msg:Worst experience ever at an Intercontinental stay!

From the reception at the front desk, it was mediocre. I had to change the room first, because the room had a very, very musty smell. It was unbelievable that this was an Intercontinental room. First, I waited for 40 minutes to change the room, and then went to the new room, and found that there were still uncleaned hairs on the quilt! ! ! I can't bear it at all!

So carefully consider moving in!

msg:I have stayed at Intercontinental hotels in several cities and they all felt good, but InterContinental Guangzhou was disappointing. The room facilities were a bit old, the bathroom had a bad smell, the sound insulation was very poor, not to mention the noise from the elevators and corridors. When I was in the bathroom, I suddenly heard loud giggling next to me and thought I misheard it. After a while, I heard the sound of mobile phones and laughter again. It turned out that the residents next to me were using the toilet at the same time. It was scary! Suddenly I didn't dare to speak out. What‚Äôs even more exaggerated is that when I was about to go out for fun, I saw rain in the weather forecast. After searching for a long time, there was no umbrella in the room, so I asked the concierge at the first floor reception desk to borrow an umbrella. The concierge first said there was a room, then said it wasn‚Äôt raining, and then said I had to pay an additional deposit to borrow it, but in the end I found a good old umbrella! This is the first time I have encountered this situation after staying in so many hotels. Guests were reluctant to ask for an umbrella. The cleaning was not good. There were a few stains on the cloakroom floor on the first day. They were still there when I left after staying for four days.

Facilities: There are many small designs in the room, separate toilet, bathtub and shower area, and large floor-to-ceiling windows on the entire surface.
Hygiene: The room is very clean and tidy, with no water stains on coffee cups, wine glasses, mouthwash cups, etc.
Environment: The InterContinental Hotel has high ceilings, the spacious lobby is very grand, and the city view and tower view rooms have beautiful scenery
Service: The service of the brothers and sisters at the front desk is simply perfect. They are quite enthusiastic and sincere. When queuing up, they will take the initiative to come over and ask if there is any help. They bring the children with them and give them a handmade dessert. Love it eat!
Comfort: The mattress is soft, the bed sheets are smooth, and the pillows are of a moderate height. The room is quiet at night, without any noise, and I have a good night's sleep.
Transportation: Take the elevator from the parking lot to the lobby by car, and report the license plate number at the front desk for free.
Diet: If you don‚Äôt dine in the hotel, there are a lot of delicious food, milk tea, and desserts nearby. You can walk there. It‚Äôs so convenient. Take your children to eat and drink everywhere.

The only personal feeling is that the service staff in some areas lack service awareness, flexibility, and communication skills. For example, the pool at the entrance of the swimming pool is very cold. Since only children want to swim, I don‚Äôt want to swim, so I don‚Äôt want to go through the pool , Looking for the service staff to open the small door on the side, but some staff said yes, some said no, and they didn't say why it was not possible, and their attitude was average, and they didn't provide a workaround, only saying that they couldn't enter the swimming pool area , Waiting outside, but children can't go in alone, inconsistent, I hope this aspect can be improved. To add, the pool itself is huge and comfortable to swim in.

The scenery outside the window, although not as close to Xiaomanyao as Conrad in Zhujiang New Town, is better than the view of the river. There are no other tall buildings in front of it.
The cafeteria on the second floor is truly a gourmet hotel. Desserts are so rich that you don't have to eat them for dinner. It is recommended to order 98 or 118 in addition to the lunch and dinner buffet. Let's have a set meal like afternoon tea.
Small suggestions for the next decoration upgrade, one is to change the smart cover. Second, you can learn from Japan Airlines and put the bathtub into the shower. The third is to add a telescopic steel wire for drying small objects in the shower room.

There is a high probability that the hotel is located here because it is close to the Pearl River, and the view of the river view room will be better.
	
The hotel lobby is very spacious. The wooden spherical lobby bar and a lot of artistic sculptures decorate the place with a very design a**osphere. The nautical chart on the background of the foreground is very grand, and it also shows the characteristics of Guangzhou. It was a great experience to be invited to sit in the lobby bar when checking in, and a drink coupon was also given in the lobby bar. Although it was just juice, it tasted really good. The bear in the lobby is so cute that I even have the urge to buy it.
	
The room area is 60„é°, which is very large! As a basic room type, there is a cloakroom, which is really inhumane. I have to say that some details are done very well, two beds are equipped with three bedside tables, and there is no need to turn your head back and forth to put some things. The toilet is separated from the bathroom area and the toilet is equipped with a sink and hand towels and soap. However, this has not reduced the supporting equipment for the sink in the bathroom area, and there are many towels. The most heart-warming thing is that the bathroom has a heating system, so you don‚Äôt feel cold at all when you go to the bathroom with less clothes on at night.
	
Due to time, I didn't experience the gym and swimming pool, but I visited the two facilities on the 6th floor. The gym is small but full of equipment, and the room has a good view. The swimming pool is larger, square, not long but wide, and the light is very good. There are various types of deck chairs on the shore, which are suitable for lying down.
	
The hotel service is very warm and in place, you can see it when you check in. It is also very efficient to make inquiries on the phone and ask for spare parts. The only thing is that I was knocked on the door four or five times the next morning to ask about the check-out time. Although they are not the same person, there will still be a gap if they are constantly asked. I hope the room attendant can share some information in time.

There is a park around the lake opposite the hotel, you can go for a walk, there are quite a lot of plants. It's a pity that the check-in at the hotel is a bit slow, and the children's playground is too small, which is not very friendly to children.
The service of InterContinental membership is good. I called one day in advance to inquire about the arrival time and whether there is any need. It is very warm. The service of Lee at the front desk of the hotel is also very warm. Have a chance to play again!

He was able to reply to my messages in time when he was busy, and he was very considerate to help me arrange it before the second check-in. Once the room is ready, you won't have to worry about waiting for a room. The food in the hotel's executive lounge is very good, but there will be a lot of people during the epidemic, and the experience is not very good. The second time I went there were much fewer people, and the service was normal. The food in the cafeteria was very rich, and ice cream was served for breakfast twice. I bought this product this time because I lived in it once before, and I was attracted by the swimming pool at that time. I have stayed in different Intercontinentals several times, and their swimming pools are really good. Here too, it's big enough to swim freely without having to fight for swimming lanes with parents and children. My mother likes this place because I can go for a walk by the river, which is very easy to stroll around. Overall, very good

Hygiene: I checked it very carefully. First, there was dust on the bar counter when I wiped it with a wet towel. There was short hair like a man's buzz cut under the quilt. I could only pick it up one by one to comfort myself that it was a brush hair. I also used a steam iron to lie down before I dared to sleep for a night.
Facilities: I can't complain. It's a 5-star hotel, but it's an old-fashioned hair dryer! The hair dryer flew out halfway through the hair dryer. All the 1k hotels in Shanghai are Dyson. I'm really screwed. There is no smart toilet! The control buttons in the room are also old-fashioned buttons. I really give up!
Environment: I made a note and called to quiet the room. The door frame was slamming near 1 o'clock in the morning, and there was another noise at 7 o'clock in the morning. The sound insulation is really poor!
Service: I called the housekeeping department to prepare more drinking water. There were people who were unwell, but there was still no one! Here is the toiletries set for everyone to see. Is this the level of Super 8? ?
Finally, this is an executive room with a small waist and river view. Let me show you the picture. I used a magnifying glass to find the small waist. The quality is not worth the price! I will never come here again in this life! ! It's a disgrace to InterContinental!

I asked the hotel housekeeper and said that I charged 408 for an extra bed. Why did the front desk charge 350 more? The WeChat customer service at the front desk said that I called the front desk and said that the extra breakfast fee for two children was very high. 1. There is no extra bed at all, and there is no extra breakfast at all, and the hotel has also checked the records. The extra bed fee is 2.408 yuan, and the breakfast fee of 228 yuan is displayed on Ctrip, which is not the extra money I was deducted. I asked them how the breakfast fee was calculated. Ctrip stated that the breakfast fee was 228 yuan, and she simply gave me 350/2 =175, said to give a discounted price, 175 yuan a piece after discount. That's really embarrassing, in fact, an extra 351.1 yuan was deducted. For simplicity, I said 350. How did you calculate it? Generally, I trust InterContinental, and I have never checked the bank deduction information. I just checked it this time, and it turned out that there were too many deductions. The ridiculous thing is that there were three people in the whole hotel explaining to me, one said the extra bed fee, the other said the breakfast fee, and they played me a recording of my family calling the front desk to ask for extra breakfast. I said it was not my family at all, there was What evidence can prove that it was called from my room? They changed it to say it was a hotel phone crossover, and another said there was an equipment error. I am still a gold card member of IHG, and I have always believed in InterContinental, but InterContinental has such a way of handling it. It is a simple miscalculation. Tell me that I am sorry. The reason is to fool me around and say that it will take one month to refund the 351.1 yuan, so why don't you wait for me to stay in the hotel for one month before charging me for the room? I will never live in InterContinental again, especially Guangzhou Poly InterContinental, it simply deceives consumers!

I sleep very comfortably. I sat at the big birdcage table, the waiter asked me how many people there were, I said seven, she said yes, but two managers came to me at eight or nine o'clock and told me to step aside [cover face] [cover face] One said he was a super VIP I had to sit for three years, and a customer who said that he had stayed for seven days had a reservation. I laughed. When I sat down, there was no sign for reservation, and the waiter also confirmed that I could sit. Why should I ask me to give up my seat? It's just for breakfast. We also brought a child over one year old and two children of five or six years old, and let a table of people make way for the so-called VIP. Are you embarrassed? But it still doesn't affect my five-star praise. I just like Lee's warm service. We will all go there again.

Platinum card, the upgrade is not guaranteed, I asked if I could upgrade to the tower view king bed, and the reply said that this room type is gone, and the tower view twin bed is still available, you can give it to me, and I will place the order. I placed an order at the Ctrip flagship store and informed me of the confirmation number, and I quickly took a taxi. An intern brother received me, and it was very fast. He said that he upgraded the house, gave me breakfast, gave me the key card, and left. I found that I couldn't find the elevator, so I asked the little brother, the little brother gave me two steps, and wrote his name when he said whether it was good or not. I said yes, and he hurried back to work, leaving me to move on. Fumbling where the elevator is... So, it's inconvenient to mention his name here...

When I entered the room, I found that there was no tower view, only a little river view and a large building view. I called the guest center and replied that the tower view room was gone. I said that the app can place an order, and I just promised to give it to me, my brother said to Nope.. I said that I came here because I heard you said that I can provide Tajing. I have no reason to stay here anymore. The little brother said that you have to refund the original channel, please check out with Ctrip.... Next Lou found the manager on duty, opened the tower view room, and said that he went back to investigate why he promised but didn't arrange it, and he didn't hear back later.

The next day's breakfast was very good, with many varieties and good taste.

I won't go into other details one by one, but the overall feeling is that this place is very strange. Everyone feels socially terrified when they come into contact with the guests. I don't know what happened...

In addition, I have to say that this river view is really beautiful, but this experience... I shouldn't live there again...

There can be a special parking area for hotel guests at the entrance, and basically a lot of luxury cars can be gathered to give the hotel a lot of heat for free. After all, the location here is relatively relative to Zhujiang New Town. Poly brand is worth supporting! The hotel team is very good, they are doing things with ulterior motives, the team a**osphere is very good, as small as the cleaning lady, and the Chinese at the front desk for foreign friends is also very good. The security personnel may not have been well trained, and this aspect can be strengthened, including the parking lot and the entrance. It is better to reserve a night shift at the parking entrance of the hotel. After all, there are many drunk people, so pay attention to safety. Overall full marks, this operation team is the one I have seen that can compete with foreign countries.

The service is warm and thoughtful, the staff are enthusiastic and proactive, help with luggage, lead the way, check in and check out quickly, and the room has been upgraded to a river view room.
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the hotel also sends moon cakes and desserts in the evening. In particular, the exclusive housekeeper Lee, who responds to every call, also comes with breakfast for our two rooms. The breakfast is quite rich and the family size is quite satisfactory.

Thank you Chloe for giving us a free upgrade of one of the rooms, so that parents can see the invincible The first-line river view of the beautiful Canton Tower, from the professional reception at the beginning to the five-star service throughout the check-in process, made this journey very beautiful.
Check out at 4 o'clock in the executive lounge is great, you can take a nap before leaving, and you can eat an extra meal of afternoon tea for free. InterContinental's western desserts are very good, stewed soup for dinner, blueberry free for breakfast, and free mineral spring. The water is from Baisui Mountain. I am generally satisfied. The only thing I want to complain about is that I feel that the design of the light switch in the room is not reasonable. I can't turn on the small toilet light when I go to the toilet in the middle of the night. It is too bright.

msg:This month, I visited the hotel for the third time and chose to spend two days in an excellent hotel in the city. It is indeed a travel plan for this year.

Guangzhou Pazhou Intercontinental Hotel, we made a group purchase order on Ctrip. The two rooms 2688 also include administrative trea**ent and double breakfast. I think it is very cost-effective. I paid the money at the front desk to upgrade the river view room. The room is clean and neat, and the interior environment is relatively spacious and full of light. I thought the mattress was a little soft, but otherwise it was fine.

Early to hear that their food products are quite good. The products on the 39th floor of the administration are very satisfactory from afternoon tea to dinner. The dim sum, especially the mid-point products, are really good. Watching the sunset in Guangzhou in the afternoon is also unique.

For breakfast, we got up early, which really surprised me a bit. While staying in many hotels in Guangzhou, their breakfasts are indeed very rich, and the partitions are also reasonable, and the service is polite.

At noon, we also went to the Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor to experience the food of the hotel in all aspects.

There was also a small episode. I actually had the wire of the thermos leaking in the room. I contacted the staff of the service depar**ent by phone and sent a courier for me. very nice.

It will cool down at night. The river view and Baiyun Mountain can be seen.
The executive lounge is good. Afternoon tea and happy hour in the evening can be self-service. There are red wine and white wine and soft drink beer. The snacks are very good, especially the stewed soup. Happy hour is about the same as dinner buffet.
The breakfast is very good, with many varieties and flavors, seafood porridge and western pastries are very good. The swimming pool is 30 meters long, the water is crystal clear, and the skin does not feel tight after swimming, which is very good! Super awesome. Lifeguards are always on line, poolside towels, lounge chairs are comfortable. Indoors are not exposed to the sun, my favorite!
The front desk saw that there were children staying, and the room sent children's toiletries and bathrobes and slippers, which was very considerate. The executive courtesy minibar has soft drink milk beer, delicious tea bags, and can check out late at 4 pm, which is really good. The parking lot is spacious.

I had the chance to stay at the InterContinental Poly Hotel. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt the professional and warm reception of the service staff in all positions of the hotel. Ms. Vicky from the front office is a kind-hearted lady, and she took the trouble to explain to me where to have breakfast and where to swim in the hotel.
The room is also very good, the river view room is very beautiful at night. Standing in the room, you can see Xiaoman waist. Although I couldn't go to the Pearl River at night because of the tight schedule, staying at Poly Intercontinental made up for my regrets and deficiencies.
The hotel's breakfast is really the most complete variety, the highest quality and the best taste I have stayed in so many hotels. A hearty breakfast brings a good mood for the day.
The pillows and bedding in the room are very comfortable. Moderately soft and hard. Especially the toiletries, which are very easy to use. Especially the shampoo, a girl with short hair like me never likes to use conditioner, this shampoo is very soft without conditioner after use. It also smells good. The body wash also rinses well and doesn't feel sticky. I also found the same brand on the Internet.
The fruit delivered by the hotel is of high quality and delicious.
The overall feeling is great, and I will choose Poly Intercontinental next time I come to Guangzhou for business

msg:During the epidemic, you cannot leave Guangzhou. But I wanted to take my family out during the Labor Day holiday, and I went around the Internet and booked the "Guangzhou Poly Intercontinental Hotel", a deluxe river view king bed and a deluxe river view twin bed. Among them, the big-bed room faces the Pearl River and has a wide field of vision. However, on the other side of the section of Keyun Road and Chebei Road, there is only a row of real estate and office buildings under construction. But after all, the price is much lower than that of many hotels in Zhujiang New Town.
       The hotel I bought at that time was an all-inclusive package, including a gift package for children, a welcome drink in the lobby bar, and a buffet for both mornings and evenings. In addition, during the Labor Day holiday, the hotel has set up an inflatable slide and a children's playground in the conference hall on the first floor, and a starry sky camp on the sixth floor. There is a charge for the children's playground and the Starry Sky Camp, but I bought the package, so I covered the sun, and the Starry Camp also covered the drinks, so this package is really worth it.
       The "Intercontinental" of the three rooms in Guangfo has a common problem, that is, the water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is relatively cold, and children have to go to the water after swimming for a while.
       Both breakfast and dinner are served at the "Moonlight" restaurant on the 2nd floor. There are French oyster sashimi for dinner, but the speed of opening oysters is relatively slow, and there are queues. As a comparison, the one in Foshan New Town is better. Based on the holiday cost of 400 yuan per person, I think the dinner is slightly substandard. Seafood stalls, sashimi stalls, and barbecue stalls all have to line up. And the waiter is not too enthusiastic, but there are resident singers to create the a**osphere at night, how good is it. The breakfast was good with smoked salmon. There is no white swan breakfast. According to the Guangfo plan, Benfei only found that the Sofitel of the Louvre Museum in Foshan has it in the same room.

2. Check in. I called and said that I could check in at 12 o'clock, and then said that the room was not cleaned at 1:30, and I had to wait for an hour. Finally, I changed to another room. In addition, I felt that the training was not in place. The people who are connected are basically unfamiliar with the business, and many problems are unknown. I asked if there was a thermostatic kettle, but in the end I didn't answer anyway.
3. A crib. Said to put the crib in another room and waited 3 hours for the crib.
4. The room is average, remember that the deluxe river view room is different from the Guangzhou Tower river view, and the deluxe river view room looks at the other side.
5. There is no price tag in the water bar in the room. Then I called to ask if it was free. I almost finished a bottle. Just said to bring the price tag.
6. It should be that the hotel is really in financial difficulties, and then the World Chinese Insurance Conference is being held, and there are quite a lot of people in the elevator. The hotel is very lively. The staff are also very busy.
7. Buffet breakfast and dinner. No salmon for dinner, then Hunan cuisine theme, 6.30. . The 6 Hunan dishes have all been taken out. I left at 9 o'clock and made up for one or two? The speed of this complement. . Only 6 baby stools are not enough. After eating two crabs, they are gone, and there is no supplement. It is recommended to eat or go as soon as the door opens at 5.30. Two oysters and half a lobster alone are okay, and freshly fried seafood is also okay, but many depend on grabbing, including crayfish.
Breakfast is okay, better than dinner. Dinner is not worth 300 per person. .
The hotel opened in 2018, the traces of use of things are still obvious.
A five-star hotel, anyway, I think it is very general. I always thought that Poly Intercontinental should be in the top five in Guangzhou. In fact, it is just pulling the hips. It is not necessary. It just doesn‚Äôt have the corresponding operational capabilities.

When I got home at 2 o‚Äôclock, I opened my luggage and found the omission. I contacted the front desk of the hotel and told me that the housekeeping did not report the loss. Because I drove home directly after leaving the store, I insisted on leaving it in the room and asked the staff on duty that night to help me the next day. After confirming, I contacted me, but I didn‚Äôt receive any contact calls from the hotel until noon the next day. After I called the customer service again, I was told that I had found it, and I could place an order by myself and let the courier send it. The whole process made me mistakenly think that I was staying in an express hotel. Firstly, the cleaning of the room after check-out was not serious and careless. Secondly, no one contacted me when I had already reported the loss to the hotel and the other party had been found. The Foshan store under the management of the same owner and wine manager is much better than the Guangzhou store. Ctrip rarely writes reviews, but this experience is really bad.

2000 ‚ûï two nights ‚ûï breakfast. Personally, I think the price is very high.
first:
1. The environment is good, the facilities are complete, and the room is very clean and tidy.
2. The service is good. The hotel front desk has been upgraded for the big bed room with river view. It should be more than 40 square meters before, and it will be more than 60 square meters after the upgrade. The room is spacious and bright, the bathtub is near the window.
3. The breakfast is also very nice, and it's good to kill coffee. There are many styles of eating.
4. There are a lot of food nearby, milk tea street and shopping malls are also very popular. Very convenient. It's a pity that I didn't go to the swimming pool gym and the spa on the 6th floor this time. I'll feel it again next time.

The environment is still good, the river view of the room facing the northeast is poor, after all, this direction has not been developed much. The buffet dinner is not cheap, but there are few high-end ingredients. Sashimi, steak, lamb chops, seafood, and drinks are all average. Crayfish has a variety of flavors, and the taste is okay. In addition, the buffet dinner is a bit unsatisfactory. I am glad that the child sleeps in without an additional breakfast fee.

msg:Dragon Boat Festival is inconvenient to travel far, just choose a hotel in the city to relax. Guangzhou Intercontinental is located near the Pazhou Complex, and the location is a little out of the way. The luxurious river view is really average, and the room where it is located is not the office building next door facing the river. The shape of the lobby bar is impressive, and the interior furnishings of the room are on the upper side and are more comfortable. Although the swimming pool on the 6th floor is not high, it is quite spacious. It is rare for the indoor swimming pool to be so luxurious. Children have fun, but I hope that it will be divided and reserved for those who really want to swim. There are two meals in the morning and evening on the 2nd floor, which are quite satisfactory. Two imported oysters are provided for dinner. The raw food is not bad, not too fishy. Foie gras is ok, aged ham is too salty. There are three flavors of crayfish, egg yolk, spicy, spicy, but unfortunately the shrimp is too small and not tasty. There are too many people for breakfast, the bread tart is good, and the ginger ice cream is well received. I gave the Dragon Boat Festival dumplings when I left, thank you üôè Why is it so hard to wait for the elevator? And which one is hard to identify, which is weird

When I walked to the front desk to check in, Catty Chen Xueyun, manager of Catty, saw me dragging my suitcase, and immediately came over to help me pick it up and put it aside , I also gave my baby a tiger doll. The children are very happy. Manager Chen's warm service makes people feel at home~~
It rained for the past two days, and the bouncy castle that the children wanted to play with was not open until the sun came out at noon before leaving. The staff was erecting the castle and preparing to open it. Catty kindly helped us to delay the check-out, satisfying the children who played with the bouncy castle. Wish~~ Really 10,000 likes! ! I really appreciate her! On the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, Catty also gave us a gift box of zongzi, and the festive a**osphere was up up up~~

The service is good, the room environment and catering are also very good, the room is very large, the river view is super comfortable, and you can see the boat on the river when you take a bath~~ Go to the room, the children's toiletries are ready early, the suit is very cute, more than General hotels are attentive~~ The buffet dinner and breakfast are very rich in variety. The seafood for the special dinner is very fresh, there are many types of desserts, and there are ham slices and fried foie gras made on the spot, and there are bands playing~~

This holiday is fun to eat, and the whole family is satisfied~~ Now I can't go out of Guangzhou casually, and it's also good to take a short vacation in the hotel~~

In particular, KYLE Xiaohong, who received me at the front desk, was very considerate to upgrade my IHG member to a river view room. The late check-out was also given to 2 pm according to my special situation. The room service also kindly asked if there is enough drinking water, and then the water for making milk powder for the child will be delivered in time. Baby cots are also provided free of charge. Overall, the service is beyond expectations, and the upgraded river view room is also invincible. The picture is the text I added after the real shot, it's really good! Thank IHG for the service this time, and I will choose to stay again next time.

The check-in process is clear, the front desk is very attentive and polite, and it can flexibly handle customer needs. Knowing that there are children, the customer service asks the customer service to specially send children's supplies. The room is medium in size, but the bed is comfortable, and the large office area is just right for the two children to do their homework. The buffet dinner is the most sumptuous of the five stars I have tried. Maybe during special times, there are not many sashimi, but all kinds of seafood are constantly available. The steamed scallops and abalone vermicelli are delicious, and the hairy crabs on the seat are especially delicious. In addition, there are Spanish ham and foie gras, both taste very good. The swimming pool is not big, and the water temperature is higher in the children's play area. There is a sauna but it is not open that day. Outside the swimming pool is an open-air tent area. It is very comfortable to sit and blow the river breeze at night. There is also a band singing, and the child's father sang along with him. Overall, the environment, traffic, service, and catering are all very good. The only thing that is picky is that there are mosquitoes in the room. You need to find customer service to get electronic mosquito coils.

Packages purchased on a trip
1380 yuan per night, twin river view room, 2 buffet night + 2 buffet breakfast + 1 spa, the price is quite cost-effective, but unfortunately there are too many unsatisfactory things
Because it is really bad, I have no interest in taking pictures at all üì∑
First of all, check in, it is clearly written after 15:00, we arrived at 15:00, just in the third row, the first two counters are doing the check, but after 20 minutes, it was my turn to check in, and the beginning was very smooth Yes, until I can't get the room card, the reason is that the hygiene is done, but the supervisor has not checked so I can't enter the room, and I have to wait about 15 minutes longer! ! ! I happened to be holding my daughter and I asked her where should I hold the baby and wait? She kept repeating with me to enter the room with the key card. I looked at her and asked again, and she reluctantly said okay, you can enter the room, and the supervisor has to check the trouble to open the door...
Then to Bobo Pool üõù
It is good to have children's facilities, but no one is guarded. There is only one wave pool and one slide. The drawing boards next to it are all broken and cannot be played. However, as a five-star hotel, the hygiene is really bad. There are no friends. A pile of bags that were bitten on the daughter's face was not completely eliminated until a week passed! And the process of playing is that only the parents watch their own baby, no staff is present to control... If an accident happens... ü§îü§î
There are too many too many spit, I don't want to say anymore~
The funniest thing is the customer service call. After I finished my complaint, she asked me to give me a rating of no less than 8 points. Where did you get the courage? What about asking me again and again to score no lower than 8? Do you think you deserve it? [angry] [angry]
This is the first time to stay in a five-star hotel that is so bad that it can't get any worse üè®
Avoid the pit next time! !

There are also hotels that cannot deliver takeaways, so why not set up a special takeaway point? Is the takeaway cabinet expensive, or is a table ugly? And what is the food safety issue you said, then we can sign an agreement. Your hotel is afraid of taking the blame, but you have to take corresponding countermeasures. You also need customers to come and get it in person. The takeaway was delivered in advance, but there was no place to put it, so the takeaway brother didn‚Äôt know where to put it.

At about 1 o'clock, the hotel waiter pushed the ham dining cart out. The thinly sliced ham was delivered while cutting, and one serving per table. As a result, when we got to our area, he just ignored us and passed by. I immediately told the waiter that we didn't receive it. The waiter said that it would be delivered in a while, but no one came for a long time. I told the waiter again why it hadn't been delivered yet. The waiter said to the supervisor, and the supervisor went. Take it from the kitchen. As a result, after waiting for a long time, still nothing. I think restaurant service like this is really rubbish. What about five stars. The food served by this kind of service feels like garbage, with poor taste and few types. The variety of cooked food is poor. The previous publicity on Dianping was done by Internet celebrity liars, which is too unreliable. It is not recommended for everyone to live and eat buffet, especially for families.

msg:After I came to live, I saw that the hotel front desk handled more than 1,200 an InterContinental Ambassador membership card. I said that you can buy one get one free if you call the hotel reservation hotline every weekend to book a room. The hotel staff shun the priority and promote the privilege of this card, so I will apply for it. I thought it was an unlimited number of buy-one-get-one-free rolls. I asked at that time, is there no limit on the number of times? Then I have no time limit? The waiter at the front desk told me that there was no, and he didn‚Äôt tell me how many times, but I was very clear. I remembered that I didn‚Äôt know that this room reservation voucher could only be used once, so I went through it directly. When I did the second time, I was told by the hotel that this voucher can only be used once within the one-year validity period! Then I would like to ask if I knew that you can only use this one once, then why should I spend more than 1,000 yuan to open this card? What's the point? The front desk of yours kept saying that his roommate told me at the time that my boyfriend and I were there and asked about the two of us. Only today did I know that it was only available once! I was fooled into applying for a card for some reason! It‚Äôs not a matter of money. You should honestly explain to the teacher that the permissions in this membership card are still used for the number of times, etc., instead of avoiding the importance of it, just introducing the discount and not introducing the rules. Follow-up I found that the more angry thing is in the hotel applet, where the hotel membership price will be more expensive than the Ctrip price! ! It‚Äôs really hateful and the most annoying. I really don‚Äôt understand why you can get me to apply for this card. If you can only use it once on weekends, booking a room is more expensive than booking on Ctrip! I laughed! Then I can just book directly on Ctrip. Why should I buy your hotel‚Äôs membership points? You didn‚Äôt tell us this thing clearly at all! After the transaction, I told me that I should go online to read the membership terms. I have already processed it and the money is paid. After reading the membership terms, can I still refund if I don't agree? You just asked me to look at the terms and conditions. I really regret not having one of the membership cards of a hotel. Don‚Äôt be fooled, don‚Äôt apply for any membership card to redeem the money!

msg:After all, it is a relatively new hotel. The design of the hotel and the overall service of the facilities are still very good. The breakfast is also very rich and the service attitude is ok. But there are still some suggestions. I hope the hotel can do better. First, I registered a hotel package with my baby, but the front desk did not take the initiative to give me a ticket to the Children&#39;s Paradise (a simple place temporarily built in the conference room, if I really want to do it) The parent-child hotel should have a fixed large room, and the guests who stay in the hotel should be able to bring their children there. They have to give the whole day&#39;s tickets. Not to mention it makes people feel petty, and the parent-child hotel&#39;s own equipment is basically the same. Free to play for free, Chimelong family also provides tickets for two days for one night.) Second, there are no children&#39;s bathrobes and slippers in the guest room, and there are no slippers in the swimming area. Wearing disposable slippers is easy to get wet. Third, the answering of the room service call is very slow, and it has not been delivered after a long time. The mobile phone and the hotel phone will not be answered after four or five calls. I understand that there are not enough layoffs. Fourth, the bedside light control and curtain control are not sensitive, the keys are erased and unclear, the duvet provided by the hotel is too hot, the air conditioner is turned on and it is hot, and it is cold without the air conditioner. do better! Shenzhen OCT Intercontinental and Dameisha Intercontinental still have some places to learn from

Before staying at the Park Hyatt Hotel
Stayed for a week. The service is poor. Tomorrow tomorrow, there will be welcome fruit at the Park Hyatt Hotel. I don‚Äôt call him. He won‚Äôt send me the high. It‚Äôs the same as I lacked the fruit. But if you write it, you don‚Äôt send it every time. Call and ask him to deliver the food, or don't write anything and don't deliver any service. The room is continuous, so you can just clean the room as you please. This is real money and silver every day. How do you serve it? ?

Later, I moved to Intercontinental, thinking that the river view here is beautiful. After I came, the room was big and the lobby was also big. Jiang Jing had a small waist and looked good. The service is also good. The food in the restaurant on the fourth floor is delicious, especially the soup
The service is also very good. Basically, I call every day to ask me some suggestions. I often send fruit. There is no fruit on the order. I often send desserts and cakesüßÅ It is really full of love. Sanitation is also good. Anyway, every time I live in Intercontinental, I‚Äôm generous and clean.
Better than Jumeirah than Park Hyatt. Five-star praise. I am a black diamond. My review is absolutely professional! !

Basically, there are service personnel who stand by rules and regulations everywhere, which is much better than the service management of Chengdu Intercontinental. In addition, the breakfast is very good in the five-star hotel in Guangzhou where I have stayed. The types of eggs are very rich, and the noodles are also very good.

During the National Day, the light show on both sides of the Pearl River was not seen. The room has been upgraded to a deluxe river view room. I personally feel that the activity area is not large enough, and the toilet and washing room take up too much area.
The buffet menu is very rich, and there are foreign friends singing and young ladies dancing. There are parent-child dramas and children's amu*****t parks on the first floor, so they need to pay, so I didn't go. Dad took a swim in the pool and had a good experience. It feels more suitable for business people. There are not too many parent-child projects. It is not as good as the experience of Foshan New Town Poly Intercontinental.

The location between the district and Chimelong is a bit far away from the old town. It is suitable for taxi and self-driving friends. It is not in the downtown area but there is also a shopping mall next to it to solve the problem of temporary meals.
