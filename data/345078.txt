msg:A great cozy hotel, with a large beautiful territory. It is equally suitable for a family holiday and for a romantic one. Concerts are organized for fans of parties, and if you want silence, there is also a place to retire. In addition to the standard set, there are beach slippers and a beach bag (you can not take extra pounds with you). There is even a petting zoo on the 1st floor. There is a separate organized space for children. There are many places for walking within walking distance. Of the 2 restaurants for breakfast, I liked Pin Ju Hainan Restaurant the most. The beach bar makes excellent kebabs. The sea is clean and calm. Yalong Bay beach is clean, the waves are rare and not big. We were from May 11, 2024 to May 24, there were no jellyfish or plankton, we swam for days, no one bit)). The service is 5+, the staff knows their business. I would like to express special thanks to Dorothy's manager. A super tactful professional. She helped us a lot in solving various issues, warned us, advised us, and promptly resolved all issues that arose. We have not met such managers for as long as we travel. I would give Dorothy the award: "best manager of the year." Special thanks to Dorothy for your attention. In general, by all criteria (beach holidays, medicine, shopping, entertainment), I liked Hainan more than Phuket, the Philippines and Turkey. The climate is very comfortable, at a temperature of +33-35, we did not die from the heat, apparently due to optimal humidity. We will definitely come back)))

The pools water is very warm and you have to be fast to catch the chairs around the pool. The gym on others side needs an upgrade, equipment ist old, rusty and treadmill make squeaky sounds while using. 
Breakfast is good but need go very early...
As foreigners get the contact from Candy at reservation and she will help you with all requests.

Restaurant and meal options are so rich. All nights you can enjoy shows from talented team. Hotel staffs are so helpful and kind. some of them did their best always to make us satisfied.

We traveled around China and stayed in all 5 stars hotel and this is much wife’s favorite. The view from our room is amazing. It’s garden and Mountain View. We enjoyed the pool and beach. There’s show at night and the breakfast is one of the best. It’s very clean and although the hotel is over 10 years but it still looks new. Friendly staffs and it’s one of the place we would come back again. Glad we pick this hotel.

msg:I booked the hotel for my 3 days holiday.   I would say this was a memorable experience for me at MGM.   It has a great location at Yalong Bay, with just a few minutes walk to the beach.   The outdoor of the hotel looks like a waterworld park, with a lot of swimming & sunbathing places, and even a small water playground for kids.   I enjoyed the surf experience in the hotel.  Room was very clean, and tidy, and up to standard.   We were staying in the lagoon room, with a swimming pool in the front.   The pool water was very clean.   The breakfast buffet includes a wide variety of both Western and Chinese foods.   Staff were super nice and really helpful especially Jelly Shen, who ensured a smooth transition of our room.   She provided the flexibility and arranged different outdoor activities for us since we are not good in mandarin, and also provided sightseeing advices within the area.   In these 3 days, she was more like a friend of us, provided exceptional support for our need.   This was one of our best travel experience we had ever.  I would highly recommended to stay here for those who like water activities or with kids.

Lots of ammenities and beautiful beach. being sanya things are more costly so do prepare for that. the rooms where suberb and a lovely view of the ocean. the bath was over looking the ocean. fantastic food at the hotel with western options. There is also a foodcourt about 500 metres away that had amazing BBQ and was affordable. I would definately recommend it. also a petting area for cute animals that you pay a fee to enter . a fun place to visit

Family room with a tipi for a kid was quite nice. There was no free self-service laundry. The restaurants are overpriced. Surfing on the artificial wave is as well too expensive, prices are not fair (but one can agree to split 1 hour with the partner and not pay double amount of money - it requires lots of negotiations with the staff). 

Overall - quite overpriced, but OK for several nights.

No one could speak English and they were not able to use my card to process the payment suggesting to leave my credit card and pick it up the next day (which sounds crazy). In the end they found the machine to process the paiement. I read that several other people faced the same issue. No one offered help with the luggage or showing the room.
Breakfast in the main restaurant is a mess. It’s extremely overcrowded with kids running around and always some food missing
The breakfast in the small sea view restaurant is perfect. I highly recommend to pay extra and go for that option. Dinners there are great too. Good wine and food, service and view. The manager is doing a very good job 

Harry at the reception speaks English and is always ready to help. One of his colleagues also speaks English and she is also very friendly and helpful.

The hotel itself is ok but mostly suitable for families with kids.

Despite language barriers, Jelly's exceptional service made us feel incredibly comfortable and welcomed, almost like having a friend by our side. The hotel itself is stunning, with easy access to both the pool and the beach. Everything was immaculately clean, and the resort's restaurants offered delicious dining experiences. The only minor hiccup was a slightly delayed check-in, which, after a long commute, was a bit inconvenient. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend MGM - it's one of the best resorts I've stayed in worldwide. Thank you, Jelly, for being our friend away from home.

Although the room was dated and in need of repair and modernisation (golf room), the staff and entertainment made up for this! We met Izzo (entertainment manager) and he explained all about the facilities and entertainment to us in English which was a big help for us. He made our family feel very welcome and the kids loved taking part in the shows and we all loved the foam party on the Thursday night at Wet Republic. It was definitely a highlight of our whole holiday. We spent most nights at the beach bar after the entertainment whilst the kids played and it was just a really nice place. We will definitely be back and would recommend this hotel to anyone. The kids playroom was huge and really fun and the animal room was a fun surprise! Big thanks to Izzo and the team for making the holiday with all the great entertainment.

msg:Just an okay hotel. Absolutely nothing special for a western couple. Restaurants on site pretty average, and mainly to a Chinese taste, which is to be expected. Breakfast was a particular low point, very greasy and oily, western options lacking. It also had a very chaotic vibe and wasn’t a very relaxing breakfast experience. Lot of smoking around the pool area which again being in China is to be expected but I’d expect a 5 star resort to have dedicated areas especially with the amount of children around the pool. Pool itself was warm and clean, with good sun-beds. In house prices for alcoholic drinks were also excellent, but the bar staff often did not seem to know how to make cocktails. This happened in more than one on site bar where I’d receive my beer, but my partners cocktail would take so long to arrive that I would have already finished my drink. Not really much to do on site, most events again are geared towards a Chinese crowd which is to be expected but being a international resort I expected a bit more of a middle ground on this, but instead it’s people in huge inflatable bear suits walking around really killing the 5 star resort vibe. I would not rush back, it was a okay experience but certainly not a 5 star one, just felt like there was not much going on and certainly not a hotel for the western audience, that is if you want a palatable breakfast for your tastes.

Candy (front desk) was amazing during our stay. She was very attentive, professional and helpful. She helped make the stay great! Thank you, Candy! My daughter loved the zip line, surfing, beach, and photography experience. MGM has many opportunities to have fun and keep busy, while offering many places to just relax and chill. The bar staff and breakfast staff were very attentive and added to our lovely experience. The only recommendation I would have for management is to place felt chair leg pads on room chairs. The noise of neighboring guests and upstairs guests scraping wooden furniture along the floor can ruin a very nice moment in one's room. Please consider this small request so that such unnecessary noise can be eliminated. I look forward to visiting MGM again. :)

Restaurant/food: the breakfast and dinner buffet is good, but the general lunch time restaurants and lunch snacks could use an upgrade (very fatty foods that are overly cooked in oil or lacking a bit of flavor).
Facilities: well kept and actually quite a few activities for  the family. Kiddie pool area was also decent. They even have a cocktail bar close to the beach.

msg:Beautiful hotel right on the beach with lovely swimming pools and lounges, the view was beautiful the rooms looked a little old but nice and clean. Air conditioning was an issue and the rooms got quite warm, in summer this would be a big problem. Food was very good in the evenings but during the day ordering, you had to go to the bar, and it was very slow, twice waiting over 45 minutes for a simple meal when there was hardly any customers. Don’t order the nachos it’s just chips with the tiniest amount of topping it’s pointless. Food is a little expensive but that’s to be expected at a nice hotel. Staff rarely speak any English which was not a big problem as long as you know some basic Chinese. Staff though are very friendly with every staff member greeting you when they walk past you. Would stay here again, very much enjoyed the stay.

The Cleaniness of the public Toilets/Washrooms at the pool-area could be better/more often.
Breakfast outside at the pool is very nice!

msg:- location right on the beach is perfect, although we didn’t enjoy the constant flow of sellers forcing you to buy coconuts/clothes/toys for kids/water activities on the beach 
- the hotel is aging and the balconies are somewhat close to each other so you can see people from other rooms and they can see you 
- we would prefer a quieter environment, this hotel specializes in family stays with children so expect a lot of kids and a lot of noise 
- the dinner BBQ by the pool is a must! tons of choices, but be sure to grab a table early, it gets packed
- an enormous cockroach fell from the shower head and flew across the bathroom, although cockroaches are very common in Hainan, it’s just not something you expect in a 5 star hotel...anyway, they changed our room, the new room seemed cockroach free 
- overall, we felt the place is not worth the price, there are other places around with better value for money

msg:Disappointing service. Seems like COVID-19 low occupancy translate into savings plan. What a shame for the few clients here who have booked. Property aging yet still acceptable. Breakfast....don’t go end service coz choice left is limited...no more fresh juice...average quality of bakeries,....2 stars hotel breakfast with lots of choice (when available) but low quality of product and no service at all of restaurant waiters. Service is not personalised at all. No follow up unlike edition or rosewood. No good smell, very humid (corridors, rooms,...). Any request becomes kind of long painful waiting and negotiation process. Not even able to serve a club sandwich in the afternoon. Again cost management at the expense of customer satisfaction. Amenities body lotion very sticky. Again humidity in rooms is literally crazy. No coffee machine in room, no sound system, tv channels choice basically of a 2 stars hotel in shanghai or Beijing. Corridors carpet always dirty. Staff grooming (room service) very poor. We ve been called for special stay extension offer and when we came to 
front desk offer not valid any more...we extended because best beach of Sanya with cristal clear water but absolutely no intention to visit again this place nor any mgm branded hotel.

msg:📍location: The hotel is located perfectly in the middle of Yalong Bay. It has direct beach access with life guard, a beach bar and sunbeds at the beach. The pool is also good, just a bit shallow but very big with many options to play volleyball, basketball or just lounge around (and a pool bar 🍹). 

🛎 service: Honestly the best service we have had in China! Everyone was friendly and helpful. Many members of staff also speak at least a little English. We even had our own butler service (on Wechat). 

🍳 food: We tried the breakfast buffet, pool bar snacks and room service. Everything was delicious! The breakfast was extremely diverse with many Chinese and Western options. We loved the food! 

🛏 room: We had a superior room with sea view. The layout of the room was very spacious with the bathroom behind the bed and even a walk-in closet (every girl‘s dream 😍). 

🤹‍♀️ entertainment: This is something that wasn‘t too important to us but it was still nice to have and I think if you have children, you would love the options. There was some kids entertainment at breakfast everyday (clowns, balloon artists or stilt walkers), which was great to watch and prevented kids from being bored and running around - great idea! Every evening there was a singer/pianist duo who either performed at the pool side BBQ or in the hotel bar. There were many other options, for example go cart, surfing wave, bouncy castle in the sea - there is really something for everyone! 

We loved the hotel so much that we had to extend one night because we didn‘t want to leave 😂 I would 100% recommend! 😁

msg:The facilities are nice but there are some glaring customer service issues. 

Our family of four stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the pool and easy access to the beach. The garden family friendly room with a balconly. We ate the buffet breakfast each morning and bought the "Gourmet Treat" package which offered lunch at the Silk, afternoon tea and buffet dinner + a show next to the pool. The hotel is located in the resort section on Sanya in Yalong Bay. There is a small town nearby with local food and fast food options as well as shopping. 

We will not return to this hotel.
Our major issue is that they offer a shuttle service to the airport. We spent more than 30 minutes filling out a form that was all in chinese to secure our spot. Two days later on the morning we were flying out they told us that they couldn't confirm our reservation and the bus was now full. So we were forced to reserve an earlier shuttle that would get us to the airport several hours too early. We canceled some of our plans because we now had to leave early. Upon arrival, the shuttke bus we were scheduled to use was also full and not one of the staff could explain what happened to our seat reservations. We ended up taking a Didi for ¥100 to the airport to avoid anymore headache with this situation. This experience was very frustrating and made us decide to not come back to this hotel again. 

The Room:
It is huge! It had a kids space with a small tent and Minion themed decor. The shower is large and separate from the toilet and there is a big bath tub. The balcony was a good size and overlooked a small pool and green area. The room was very quiet and met our needs. 

The Breakfast
They made an attempt to offer Western options by providing, premade waffles/pancakes, an omelet station, fried eggs, cereal, cheese, bread/toast, and coffee machines. There are also lots of local options such as a soup station, noodles, steamed buns, sweet sausages, boiled and baked eggs, porridge, and fruit. 

The Gourmet Treat:
The kids really enjoyed the tea time as it includes lots of fancily decorated sweets and they liked to try each one. The lunch at Silk was very good and the service was good. It fed the whole family and included two soups, grouper, fried shrimp, clams, picked and steamed veggies and stir fried mushrooms. Just be careful about ordering anything beyond the set menu as they will charge you for it. We ordered some watermelon juice for the kids and two small glasses cost us $13.50. 

The minor Issues we had.
We were in contact with a hotel representative to make entertainment reservations. She was very helpful at first but then she stopped responding to messages for days at a time and then was very inconsistent with her responses.
The next issue we had was the staff ignoring the do not disturb sign. They walked in while the kids were sleeping and pretty much insisted on making up the room on several other occasions. We don't really need new towels each day and can make our own beds so we kept the sign up but they kept pushing in.

Some of the facilities are damaged or out of order. The floor of the kids' water park is severely distorted and cracked. My kids kept tripping on it and we are not having fun. They advertise an obstacle course out in the ocean but it was closed the whole time we were there. The children's block area is designed for babies. 

My last complaint is at the beach the life guard was overprotective. There is a designated swimming area blocked off by rope and bouys and if you get withing 10 feet of the rope the life guard blows the whistle and uses the megaphone to tell you to get away. This is also annoying when you are trying to relax on the beach. 

We still had a good time but were very disappointed in the service regarding the shuttle bus.

At breakfast they have two restaurants. One is eastern the other one is western. Western restaurant doesn't have stainless steel spoons! I have asked and staff said no stainless steel spoon then I insistently asked they just brought.

Next, they have corn flakes at their western breakfast but there is no enough bowl when I asked staff also said there is no enough bowl and still haven't washed yet. Then I asked for washing, then they also washed and brought one bowl.

Till 4-5 o'clock, housekeeping doesn't clean our room till I ask for urgent cleaning. 

Most of staff cannot speak English enough, luckily I can speak Chinese. 

For this price level, this hotel is overrated.

msg:The beach in this area is gorgeous. However, some of the staff here is very strange. They are really aggressive about paying for stuff. They act like the hotel is having money problems and it’s your responsibility. There was this incident where I jumped in the pool and grabbed a floatie just to soak for a few minutes and this guy comes running u to me screaming unintelligibly. He kept trying to speak in “English” to me although I could not understand him. I speak decent Chinese and kept telling him, ”我会说中文”。 Finally, he tells me it’s 100 yuan for the floatie. He didn’t have any official name badge or anything and all day, I didn’t see anyone else being harassed like this. It was weird. Then, for dinner, it’s hard to eat light. The staff tries to bully you into the 358 yuan buffet, which is awkward when you’re watching your weight to don your bikini body! The decor is outdated too. It’s like. Cheap wanna be luxury hotel.

The only down side I would say is that the The lobby bar service is quite slow and I asked for a mojito , it was not good but the lady understood and did not charge it  since I honestly was unable to drink such a bad cocktail.  I would stay again bcs the amenities of the hotel and the environment was quite good . I also received a free upgrade from a garden view ( probably in floor 2-3 ) to a sea view in floor 8th! That as great thank you !!!!

msg:The stay experience was very good. First of all, the housekeeper Elina added WeChat in advance to inform us of the activity time. She was very considerate. When we arrived, she asked us what we needed. I said that we didn’t have enough water, and she immediately brought us a lot of water... There was also a fruit plate when we checked in, and there were drinks in the minibar every day, which was great!
The housekeeper also reminded us to go to breakfast early. Fortunately, we went early... The key point is that you must go early, otherwise you have to queue up late, which is embarrassing... The breakfast is not bad. There are two restaurants. We ate in both, and I prefer the Hainan flavor one...
For a parent-child hotel, I am really satisfied. The dolls play a lot and there are many activities. Tongmeng Tiandi is the kind of place where children usually play. The cute pet park opposite is highly recommended... But if you want to interact, you have to pay a ticket. If the doll likes animals, it is highly recommended...
My baby likes it very much. He interacts with the little animals side by side when he goes in. The staff is also super nice and introduces them side by side... There are many super cute ones, such as bunnies, meerkats, chinchillas, and marmots. They are so cute, so cute! The kids loved it...
The next day we also went to the poolside to eat a seafood buffet, which tasted good, but if you want to sit by the pool, remember to go early to reserve a seat...
There are also performances from Tuesday to Sunday, you must watch it‼ ️It's really amazing, it's very good to watch, if you don't want to eat the buffet, you can also watch it while swimming, very comfortable!
A very good experience, I will come again.

msg:I took my family to Sanya for a vacation, a total of 6 days and 5 nights. I chose Haitang Bay for the first two nights because the destination attractions are relatively close and more convenient. In the middle, we transferred to another hotel in Yalong Bay because we spent most of the day outside. We stayed in hotels for the last three days and two nights, and it was also the first time we decided to stay at the MGM Resorts.
American style, the staff are very enthusiastic. I really like this atmosphere, it makes people feel very comfortable. The staff I met in the corridor when I left the room greeted me proactively and smiled.
Thank you very much to Tom, the front office butler, for his considerate arrangements. We sent out a lot of information about the hotel's activities and programs in advance, as well as casual dining places near the hotel. The bed sheets in the sea view parent-child suite have cartoon patterns, which are very beautiful and the children like them very much. A small tent basketball hoop was also prepared in the living room, and the Trojan children played excitedly for a long time. The room has an oversized balcony with sea views on one side and mountain views on the other. It is very pleasant to have dinner under the afterglow of sunset.
Finally, I want to say that the snails came out after the rain in Sanya. It is the first time I have seen such a big snail.

1. Super satisfied with the service of customer service Tina Sun Tingting. She added WeChat before checking in. She answered all questions and responded quickly, solving all doubts. This kind of customer service job has to face so many customers every day, and she is so patient, which is really great👍
2. The hotel's hosting service. At first, I was worried that the baby would cry. After half a day of hosting, I found that the child was happier with the professional teacher. There will be many interesting games, and the child has been thinking about it.
3. The hotel's hardware facilities are very good. Every time I don't walk to the elevator, the elevator door will open automatically. There is no need to queue for such a large hotel elevator. The lobby is bright and spacious
4. There are many things for children to play. I stayed for two days and left before I had time to experience many things. The staff are very friendly.
5. For the hotel, I will stay again soon. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this hotel has the best value for money and the best service. I will definitely recommend it to my friends.

There were many parent-child activities. The staff, Sean, was enthusiastic and thoughtful. He would ask if there was anything that needed to be added to the room via WeChat every day. If there was any problem, he would help solve it quickly. The service was very good. The only drawback was that the room facilities were relatively old and the breakfast was not refined enough. The Chinese restaurant tasted good, but the waiters there were rather indifferent. Overall, it was a good experience

There was also a free M show, which was also very suitable for bringing children, which was the feeling I liked. The housekeeper Elina was also very good, patiently answering every question and giving us a piece of fruit. The Earl Travel Photography provided by the hotel was also great. Although it cost more than 2,000 yuan in the end, it was worth it. The guys who made up, took photos and selected the photos were all very nice, especially the one who selected the photos was very quick~ In short, except for the bad weather at this time, everything else was good!

The housekeeper Kimi has been communicating with us since we checked in. The room types we want are basically satisfied. He also introduces various activities of the hotel. When it is time to eat, he reminds us where to eat. Before going to bed, he reminds us to close the doors and windows at night... He is very considerate and reminds us to do things like family. It is so touching.
The room attendants are very polite, the rooms are cleaned cleanly, the public activities are rich and colorful, the water temperature of the swimming pool is suitable, the courtyard is beautifully green, and the beach bathing service is thoughtful. MGM is really good. I will definitely stay again next time and recommend it to my friends.

As long as you carry a bag from another hotel, someone will keep asking you for your room number (this has never happened in other hotels). There is little greenery and little shade during the day. Fawan focuses on family hotels, but there are no family facilities at all. There are no slides. The five-year-old child feels very bored and can only play on the beach. The noisy vegetable market is the same every day. It is not as good as the last one I stayed at, the Seaju Pullman. I wanted to leave on the first day of my stay. of

This time, the service has been further improved. I like Tom Majie, the butler of the front office depar**ent, for his patient, meticulous and thoughtful service.

msg:Booked two months in advance, the room rate dropped, butler Kimi Yang helped upgrade the room type, very satisfied, with a large terrace and swing.
Although the hotel is relatively old, the hygiene and items are well maintained. All items can be felt to be designed and placed from the perspective of the guests. I stayed in 8 five-star hotels on this trip. Although the decoration style of this hotel is slightly conservative and old, the room and butler service experience are the best!
There are children's bathrobes, children's disposable cotton slippers, children's special shampoo and bath products, and the washbasin has a footstool for children and a ready-made absorbent cloth.
The handrails in the bathroom take care of the elderly/disabled people, and there is a place for sitting bathing. The bench for sitting bathing has anti-scratch and anti-kick angles on both the side and the bottom. The designer is very considerate.
The trash can next to the toilet is also placed in the front, where it is very convenient to throw away waste paper, instead of the back.
Disadvantages: Sound insulation seems imperfect, there are few charging sockets at the head of the bed, and the light control panel has a minor fault.
Finally, I would like to praise Kimi Yang. He started to follow up before I checked in, sent me a lot of activity time and maps, helped me upgrade the room type, took the initiative to introduce the night market and food near the hotel, reminded me that parking is free, introduced the breakfast restaurant, and prepared breakfast for us in advance on our last day when we were catching a flight and didn't have time to eat breakfast! Thank you~
By the way, the Corona barbecue on the beach of the hotel tastes really very good! ! The yacht sent to the sea is large and stable, and it is not easy to get seasick.
This trip ended perfectly in mgm.

The housekeeper Jasmine from the front office provided very good service. She could always help to deal with any problems immediately. She reminded us to register the license plate number when we checked in. We could use items in the room for free. She introduced the locations of several restaurants in the hotel and the corresponding special dishes. She reminded us to make reservations at the airport the night before we checked out. It was really considerate. The children wanted children's toiletries bags, and they also sent 2 of them. The mosquito repellent in them was particularly useful. We wanted a little lion, and they also applied for it for us. Thank you so much!
Except for the small train, we didn't play with other matching projects. It's a pity. The swimming pool is too sunny during the day, and the water is still a little cold at night. It's just right to play for an hour or two at three in the afternoon!
The beach is very good, close to the hotel, and the children like the sand digging tools provided. They run to dig for a while every day!
The riverside buffet is a bit bad and tastes bad!

Because it was my baby's birthday, the front desk helped upgrade the golf room to a parent-child room, which has a tent, a wooden horse, a basketball hoop, and most importantly, there is a little lion on the bed, which is so cute!
The housekeeper Elina Fuhuan is beautiful and kind. She responds to any questions in a timely manner and patiently answers them. She is very considerate to help my baby prepare beach toys and send a birthday cake. The baby is so happy.
I also want to thank Brother Fu Shijun. The room is very clean, the service is good and very enthusiastic. As a local, he gave us a lot of suggestions for playing. The beach recommended by the brother is really good. It's the first time I saw the mantis shrimp swimming in the sea.
Although I didn't play the pool bubble show because of the rain, I was still very happy. Yalong Bay is very lively. MGM walks down from the lobby to the beach, with lounge chairs and parasols. There are not many types of food in the restaurant, but I eat full every day. It's a few minutes walk to Baihua Valley Commercial Street, which is also convenient for shopping. The important thing is that the hotel is very family-friendly. The children's toiletries are very exquisite, there is a children's swimming pool, children's bathrobes, etc. It is recommended for those with children to stay here~
(I plan to take my big brother Lion with me when I go out in the future hahahahaha)

Jasmine, the butler of the front office depar**ent who stayed with us this time, was very meticulous. She was online at any time when there were questions, and took the initiative to ask us whether we needed free services such as shuttle buses. It was very worry-free, and also helped us to do a late check-out. The baby took a lunch break and we went to the beach to take beautiful photos. The abundant lounge chairs on the beach were also great. Lynn, who handled the consultation at the front desk, was also very good. She helped to deal with the problem immediately, and gave the baby a cute little lion when checking out. I have already recommended it to friends with babies around me. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose MGM. I hope the service quality will remain consistent.

There were many dishes. It was too hot during the day and I wouldn't be bored in the hotel. The Platinum Travel Photography provided by the hotel took beautiful outdoor photos. Because I brought a child, I didn't go surfing or anything, but it was enough to have fun. I walked across the pool to the beach. I had time to experience the Corona Bar in the evening. The foreign singers sang very well, and the sand was very clean. It was really good to provide children with sand digging tools. You can dig sand for a long time. I also experienced the balcony breakfast on the day before leaving. Hahaha, it felt particularly good, eating while watching the sea view. Remember to book a room with windows on the west side, otherwise it would be very hot early in the morning and I couldn't experience it. Next time I bring my children here, I will stay at MGM.

It was my first time trying surfing and I was very satisfied with myself haha! The room was very clean, odorless and clean! Drinks were free. Tom, the butler in the front office, was very good and always came to ask about my concerns. In short, I didn't want to leave the hotel for a minute.

When eating breakfast, the waiter accidentally got on the child, and was in a trance, without any enthusiasm for work! This morning shift staff cooked porridge, and when the guests came, they had to wait for 10 minutes. What is a person who doesn't want to serve here? ****. . The room cleaning staff looked ugly! Knowing that there are children, they don't know how to put toiletries? Breakfast is too far from the room, and tourist information is not well prepared! The butler service is also not satisfactory, there is no contact in advance, and we took the initiative to add WeChat when we arrived at the store! On the contrary, I stayed in Wyndham a few days ago and had a good experience. The butler service was great! I won't go to MGM next time. It's better for everyone to find a hotel with high cost performance. This place is mediocre!

msg:This is my second visit. I brought my kids here last Spring Festival. MGM is much more beautiful in summer. It is indeed a well-known parent-child hotel with a lot of activities until after 9pm. The hotel has a strong holiday feeling, many swimming pools, and a lot of adult activities. The view of the full sea view room is simply amazing. I have stayed in two pseudo-parent-child hotels, Hilton and Marriott, but MGM is the best choice in terms of room view, holiday feeling and parent-child facilities. The room decoration is indeed a bit old, but there is no sewer blockage or hot water. For the price of less than 2K during the holiday, I am really satisfied.

When I got off the car, someone took the initiative to help me with my luggage. Because the plane arrived early, the room had not been cleaned yet. I added the housekeeper Candy Xiaotang's WeChat.

Xiaotang also took the initiative to introduce hotel information, so that we, who were staying for the first time, could quickly understand the travel information. Thank you very much! I stayed for 5 days and 4 nights, and also had breakfast at the hotel. There were many kinds of breakfasts, and the children liked it very much.

msg:The hotel is still a bit old, relatively new~ But the room type is really suitable for a family of four. The breakfast may be due to the large flow of people. The attitude of the thin lady who received us at the door on the morning of May 4th still needs training. (The breakfast room near the Hainan-style breakfast, next to the game hall passage, can directly enter the outdoor swimming pool) It is a parent-child hotel. There are two staff members at the entrance. Because there are guests in front, they may not have purchased breakfast and need to purchase it. One person can help to purchase it, and one person can help the guests with breakfast coupons to apply for certification entry. Later, the flow was diverted. I thought it was necessary to queue separately, so I led the two children to queue for this. It turned out that she was processing the purchase of breakfast coupons, and then said in a very unfriendly tone to queue up. 🤦Okay, this service👍But the staff by the swimming pool are really responsible. The children were a little far away from me in the swimming pool. The staff kept asking the children where the parents were and where they would watch them carefully. On such a hot day, the attitude is very nice! Well, overall, I am still quite satisfied~ The swimming pool is very suitable for bringing children. It is a normal temperature swimming pool~ I recommend the small animal park. There are many types and you can interact! It is one of the better ones in the cute pet park and is definitely not just doing things to get by.

There are many breakfast restaurants, and there is no waiting in the Niwan restaurant.
Children's entertainment equipment has also increased. Children's favorite Ultraman Super Wings are all available.
I like the full sea view suite room type very much. I stayed in Building 2 last year. This year I stayed in Building 1 and the view was also excellent. The large terrace is great.
The room cleaning staff is also very kind and helped the children fold the towel bunny. Very attentive and glued the mouth and eyes.
Every time I come to Sanya, I have to stay in MGM for a few days. MGM has a lot of room types that can meet the needs of different numbers of people. This is very good.

msg:Let's talk about the room first. It feels a bit like an old-fashioned four-star state-owned enterprise hotel. The interior decoration is relatively old. What is more uncomfortable than the decoration is the layout. The partition behind the head of the bed separates a whole row of washing space, which makes the bedroom space very small and inconvenient to walk. After entering the room, the smoke alarm beeps every ten seconds. Two engineers came to remove the wires to solve the problem.

Let's talk about the service. The most unbearable thing is the service: 1. When the taxi arrived at the hotel, there were large and small luggage, and there was no courtesy guard to help move the luggage. This trip to Sanya was the only hotel that did not have courtesy guards to open the door and move the luggage; 2. According to the order page, check-in is marked at 3:00, but I arrived at the hotel at 3:00 but was told that I needed to wait for 1 hour and 4:00 to check in. At my strong request, I waited for 35 minutes before getting the room card. During this period, the processing staff left twice, and I waited stupidly. I asked the service staff next to me, but they ignored me. The entire hotel staff was very indifferent, as if the customers who were not handled by her had nothing to do with her. 3. During the stay, the housekeeper was useless, did not solve any substantive problems, and only changed the name to send WeChat group messages. 4. The quick check-out is good when leaving the hotel, but I left the hotel at 2:00 and arrived at the next hotel to check in at 3:00. They said that MGM had not checked me out yet, so my identity could not be verified. So I started waiting, and I still hadn't checked out at 7:00 in the evening. It was only resolved after a phone call.

Finally, let's talk about children's activities. This is the only comfort point. There are quite a lot of children's activities, and the park is very large and beautiful.

There are two breakfast restaurants, Hainan style and Chinese and Western combination. The Hainan style is relatively less optional, but there are soy milk and fried dough sticks! There are also Hainan style noodles; the Chinese and Western restaurants are a hodgepodge with a little bit of everything (but no soy milk and fried dough sticks)

The service is really terrible. I learned from other hotels to have a butler, but he didn't reply for a long time. The recommended meal was also wrong. I couldn't use it on site because it said it hadn't expired. I was really speechless. There was no welcome fruit, and I didn't ask if I had a lot of luggage or if I needed a luggage cart, etc. I was just doing my job. Bad review! ! ! There is no service at all! I just came here from Atlantis, and the gap in butler service is really not a little bit

There is no rest area. Check out and wait to go to the airport. There is a small rest area, and the air conditioner doesn't cool. There is no greenery around the swimming pool. It is still quite sunny when swimming during the day. If you don't buy in a group, there are no simple meals in the restaurant in the hotel. It is recommended to buy a meal and accommodation package in advance.

The 10-minute fun surfing experience is very fun, but you need to make an appoin**ent in advance, otherwise you will have to try your luck like me. It is best to go for breakfast before 8:30, otherwise you have to queue up. The photographer of Platinum Travel Photography is very nice, so we spent another 2,000 yuan to buy photo albums in the end. . . The cute pet park gave us a viewing ticket, but you can only watch from the outside, you can't go in and touch the animals, and you have to buy a separate ticket to go in, which feels a bit expensive

The hotel arranged Elina to provide butler service. You can consult at any time if you have any problems encountered in the hotel. She also helped us to check out late. Thank you very much!

Thanks to my beautiful housekeeper Tina for leaving me the only independent pool in the hotel with a small yard. I passed by and looked at other rooms. The scenery is good. It can be said that it is the king of cost-effectiveness of Sanya's pool room. It also gives me a one-hour paddle board experience. I had a lot of fun in the room, which is just right for the hot and humid weather in Sanya now.
During the stay, the housekeeper Tina gave me various warm tips, helped me book breakfast, and met my various needs. Before leaving, she also gave my baby a little lion as a souvenir. Can I give her ten stars, haha.
You must order the poolside breakfast. Two adults and one child didn't finish it. It looks good and delicious. The hotel has added a new activity of releasing fireflies, which is limited to the season. The children are so happy for 99 yuan, a novel experience in life +1.
The hamburger and fries I ordered in the room are also delicious. And Sa Beining is here recently. I met him in the hotel by chance. It's also the same as the star. Come again next time💕

The most noteworthy thing is that on the way to the airport after checking out, I found that my mother's insulin was left in the room. Because Fu Huan was resting, I contacted the hotel. The hotel sent me a picture not long after, but because the express delivery of the medicine could not be sent, I I was in a hurry to board the plane, so I had to contact Fu Huan. Before I took off, with Fu Huan’s help, my insulin was successfully taken away by courier. Thank you very much to her. What a beautiful little sister.

We faced the machine and were sprayed on the face, hoping that we could spray it high into the sky and let the bubbles fall naturally. However, the overall stay experience is good.

Advantages: There are fewer betel nut worms than Sanya Bay
The children's floating arm provided by the hotel is very useful
The VIP fruit of the hotel is richer than that of other hotels
You can see the fireworks show of the neighboring hotel at night
There are clown performances at noon and m shows at night to kill time
Now no little lions are given (only a small brooch is given)
All activities are clearly arranged
There is a free train at 17:30

The beach is very steep (the sand is not as fine as Sanya Bay)
Sanya Bay sand crabs are easier to catch (very stupid) See the video for details
You can pick up more shells in Sanya Bay

Here I want to remind everyone that most of the free projects mentioned by Ctrip are available for guests staying in the hotel every day, including indoor and outdoor play, and then the water projects can be booked on the day, because it is based on the wave conditions of the day to decide which projects can be played. I was going to experience it, but I just saw someone drowning in Qingshui Bay Besides, I see that except for the motorboat, most people fall into the sea in other water activities. I am afraid of death, so I dare not try it.

The hotel housekeeper is very considerate and good, the service is good, and the sanitary environment is good

When the child was on the slide in the children's pool, his feet slipped, causing him to fall down and fall on his head. Moreover, the protective pad at the entrance of the slide had been removed, which was a huge safety hazard! And at the same time, several children fell down, and the safety guard was not around the whole time, allowing the children to crowd up. I have stayed in several hotels, and this hotel has the worst security. And after the child fell on his head, the safety officer just came over and asked a few lukewarm questions without any professional knowledge. It is recommended that families who want to bring children to play must choose carefully! Extremely bad check-in experience, I will never come again!

It's just that the beach in Yalong Bay is really hard to describe. The waves are big recently, and we can't go into the water yet. The scenery is good. The room is also clean,
I hope every child can get a little lion. My daughter was entangled for a long time when she went back. But the little lion is only available in the parent-child room. Ritz has children who can get one.

msg:The environment and service of MGM Hotel are very nice, and the set meal in the Chinese restaurant is also very delicious. I would like to give special thanks to Sean, as the hotel's personal butler this time. He not only applied for free snacks and fruits for me, but also introduced the hotel's features and various food and entertainment in Yalong Bay in a very enthusiastic and detailed manner. I look forward to my next trip to Sanya.

In addition, the hotel also provides a colorful buffet breakfast and various leisure facilities, so that I can relax my body and mind. This is not only a place to rest, but also a spiritual home.

msg:The hotel is great, it is a family hotel. It is the first hotel I stayed in Sanya. The housekeeper Candy contacted me one day in advance and checked into the family room. The fence was installed for me in advance. I had questions and they answered them all. They were very enthusiastic.
The room is on the second floor. I was worried about mosquitoes before, but there was no mosquito after inserting mosquito repellent! The room is not as old as it is said. I think it is OK. The room is large and the things provided are also very complete, including beach bags and children's bathrobes.
The hotel has two breakfast restaurants with many varieties and several swimming pools. There are many parent-child activities every day, but we are relatively young and did not participate. We went to the bubble party and the small train. The children's playground of the hotel is enough for us and we can stay for a long time. It is also very convenient to go to the beach. There are free sand digging tools and many lounge chairs~
The disadvantage is that the hotel staff is not very enthusiastic. I met a cleaning employee who took the initiative to say hello after staying for four days. There are a few shade trees outdoors and it is more sunny. In addition, the hair dryer is a bit lame. Overall, this hotel is still worth staying in.

She also helped me make an appoin**ent for the Flame Lobster meal. When I left the hotel, she gave the two babies MGM Little Lions, which was very considerate.
The room is quite large. It is enough for a family of four. They also added a bed guard for us, so the baby can sleep comfortably.
The children's playground is suitable for babies of different ages. There are indoor and outdoor areas, and children can play all day without getting tired.
The sea view is also good.
The only drawback is the queue for breakfast.
Will come again.

msg:The advantages and disadvantages of this hotel are obvious. The advantages are that there are abundant facilities for parent-child entertainment, there are poolside performances at night, and there are many seats on the beach. You can find a lounge chair to sit and watch the sea at any time. We came to play in the first week of April. Due to the strong wind and waves, none of the sea projects included in the hotel package were played, and we could only exchange them for the hotel's afternoon tea package. If these additional projects cannot be played due to seasonal reasons, then I hope they will not be written in the package. Anyway, if they cannot be played, there is no point in giving them to guests. The disadvantage is that there are too many mistakes and negligence in management, which are simply continuous. On the first day of check-in, we were forced to wait for an hour in the room for our luggage, because the swimsuits and equipment were all in the suitcase. Who would have thought that we would have to wait so long? It is recommended that you do not let them send the luggage, and the guests take it into the room by themselves. I added the butler WeChat and asked about the luggage status. The reply was that they were urging us to arrive soon, but I still waited for a long time. Later, the butler arranged to send fruit to the room to express his condolences. The next day we went out at 10 o'clock and hung a sign outside the door saying "clean immediately". However, when we returned to the room after 1 o'clock to rest, the room was not cleaned. We asked the housekeeper to arrange someone to clean it, so we could not rest and had to go out again to facilitate the staff to clean the room. What's more, on the day we left the hotel, we took the hotel bus. After arriving at the destination, we found that the concierge did not load our three suitcases on the bus. We called to ask, and their first reaction was to blame me for not showing them the luggage ticket. At that time, we and our luggage were at the door of the bus. They asked us to get on the bus. Our luggage tags were all on the luggage. They did not let us show them the luggage ticket stub. Isn't this a standard inspection process? And isn't the luggage on the standard bus guest? Negligence is one aspect, but why is the first reaction to blame the guest when there is a problem? Is this attitude reasonable? Finally, the housekeeper sent a car to deliver our luggage, and we could only wait until the luggage arrived. If you take a plane at the airport, can't you delay the check-in? In short, during the stay, the hotel made continuous mistakes and did not correct them after repeated warnings. This should be a problem at the management level of the hotel. We hope to make improvements to reduce the inconvenience caused to guests, wasted time and unnecessary communication costs.

She is very considerate and meticulous. She will contact me in advance before coming. There are still many tourists checking in that day. We arrived at about 2:30. Although we can only check in at around 3:10, the children can't wait and are 10 minutes later than the check-in time stipulated by the hotel. Nina helped us to check in as quickly as possible;
There are also many activities in the hotel. Nina will also send me the activities in advance. We will arrange to play according to the time; the children don't want to go home after playing!
An unexpected surprise, I met Mr. Sa Beining and his family in the hotel's cute pet park. They are very nice and take care of the children themselves!

msg:I came to MGM again. On the third day of the ***** New Year, I booked two pool rooms and stayed for four consecutive nights. I once again experienced MGM’s perfect service. I was very happy.
✨As soon as she arrived in Sanya, the girl started to have a fever and became sick. She asked the housekeeper Jelly-shen for a thermometer, which was delivered quickly! And they took the initiative to send an extra quilt, which was considerate! During this period, they kept asking me if my child's condition had improved and if I wanted to go to the hospital for a checkup. The child couldn't go to the restaurant for breakfast, so he helped pack some and sent them to the room. Thank you again Jelly☺️☺️
✨The heated swimming pool is very comfortable, and the waiters at the pool are also great! When renting water toys, they will actively help install and return them. Happy (n˘v˘•)¬
✨There are many people staying in the hotel, so there will be some chaos during breakfast, but I always take the initiative to find some quiet or outdoor locations. But to be honest, the breakfast at MGM is of average quality, not as good as the ones I've had at other hotels. But it’s definitely okay to eat enough😊
✨🏖I paid to attend the Valentine’s Day beach reception. The atmosphere was so good. I drank delicious wine and had an exciting disco ride on the beach.
✨In addition to regular meals, there are also simple meals beside the swimming pool every day, but the price is on the high side, and service fees and taxes will be added. I don’t know if it is because of the Spring Festival, but the price of everything has doubled.
✨Afternoon tea...it’s all about the experience
There are many hotels in Yalong Bay, and there is a reason why MGM ranks at the top of the family hotel series. Children’s toiletry bags are something I have never seen in other hotels, including anti-mosquito spray, shampoo, and body wash. You can also take your bags with you inside, which is very convenient! From entering the lobby to checking out, the service was first-class! Parent-child activities make children want to participate every day!

Although the balcony faces the hotel, you can still see a little bit of the sea. The windows are very soundproof. , after closing it, you can basically not hear the sound from outside.
The swimming pool service in the hotel is very good. There are bath towels nearby that you can borrow and you can take them directly back to the room. Mineral water is always available next to it.
I took things away twice at the hotel and found them back at the concierge desk successfully.
The hotel is very close to the beach. The beach is not as rough as it is said. The children had a lot of fun playing on the beach.
There are indoor play areas, and you can also play when the sun is shining.
The kids said they would stay at this hotel next time they go to Sanya.

Overall it's pretty good, except that many of the free things mentioned in the package are actually free in the hotel, except for surfing, cute pet park, go-karts, cable cars, water guns, such as the forest park, and the children's park. Mengtiandi is free, so those with children can consider whether they need a parent-child room, because at least two of the items provided are free.

msg:I booked a pool room for two days at about 1,500 per night. There were many mosquitoes. The hotel upgraded me to a two-bedroom sea view room for free. I have basically stayed in a hotel in Haitang Bay. This time I brought my children to stay in Yalong Bay. It is less windy than Haitang Bay. Compared with the Yanlord Atlantis in Haitang Bay, I think it is at least as good as the hotel. In the same price range, MGM is still very cost-effective, probably because there are many guests, so check-in takes a while, and the concierge takes a while to unload luggage. Generally speaking, it is very good. We give our housekeeper Jelly a big thumbs up. The three-day and two-night stay experience made us feel that MGM is very good because the housekeeper is responsible! You can choose friends with children. Remember to accompany them to win gold coins, exchange them for gifts, and cultivate your children's self-confidence! Everything is good, except for the buffet in the evening. I have stayed in many hotels and eaten in many hotels. I rarely give negative reviews, but I really don’t recommend everyone to eat it. I won’t say anything if it’s too much. It’s really bad. It’s delicious (if you can persuade someone, it’s worth it). If I come back again, I will still choose to stay at MGM for a long time. It’s not just a one or two day experience, it’s the best value for money!

msg:The hardware of MGM Sanya really makes me speechless. I booked two sea view rooms on Ctrip, but one of the rooms had almost no sea view. All I could see was the corridor of the hotel next to it and the roof of the villa. This is not the point. The point is that of the two rooms, the toilet and sink in one are broken, and the balcony door and sink light in the other are broken. As for the facilities on the bar and the drinks delivered, the actual pictures are as follows. If we only look at hardware, I think some express hotels are doing better now. I can understand that the Spring Festival reception is stressful, but this cannot be the reason why the supporting facilities cannot keep up. After all, the room fee is actually paid there. I originally wanted to stay for two days and leave, but the service did match the MGM brand, which was a little comforting. There are three restaurants open for breakfast, one of which is Hainanese specialties and does a good job of Hainan pickled noodles. During the Spring Festival, the garden activities are good. Although the activities are the same every day, the children like it. I hope the hotel can pay attention to customer feedback. After all, there are too many choices for hotels in Sanya now.

Before check-in, he proactively contacted me and informed me on WeChat, and then sent me various check-in, entertainment, food, parent-child activities, marine activities, etc. On the day of check-in, I was worried that the check-in would take too long. Just inform me to make arrangements and go directly to the guest relations counter to save time. As a result, a bigger surprise awaited the children. They upgraded to a better room. When they opened the door, they saw a special birthday decoration for my brother. Although it was simple, the children were pleasantly surprised. Considering the two children, the housekeeper specially gave two little lions. , so festive. In the evening, a birthday cake was delivered to the guest room as a special surprise. Afterwards, Tina informed me of all the meals, entertainment, and contact me one by one to prevent me from wasting my playing time. Sure enough, he listened to his advice and the adults were happy and the children had a great time. Likes are a must, and friends will have to recommend it to Tina in the future. It’s simply So comfortable

msg:The overall experience of staying at the MGM Hotel is quite comfortable. The customer service manager Tingting is very responsible and very kind. She communicates about the stay experience every day. She is very concerned about whether the guests are satisfied with the stay experience and communicates in time to solve the problem. This is a plus point, not too bad. What I am satisfied with is the catering. The staff at breakfast feel sleepy every day. There is no warm and thoughtful service and no proactive service. Perhaps because there are too few staff, the tables and dishes are not set up and removed in time. It is too different from other surrounding hotels.

The heated swimming pool is really children's favorite for playing in the water in winter. The little one stayed for two days and changed to another hotel and didn't want to leave. The decoration of the hotel is not new, but The service is great, especially the housekeeper Tina's meticulous attention to detail, which is a plus! Will stay again!

At 3:30, I was informed that I could check in. I was told that check-out was at 12 o'clock the next day. Your check-in was postponed. Why wasn't check-out postponed? After waiting for an hour to check in, there were only two people checking in at the 6 counters, both with children. Don't you know this! Besides, you are making an interactive clown game. It is really good to interact with the children. The children want to participate, but no one from you has come for a long time to maintain order. An intern can come directly and tell my children to queue up at the back. There are so many people, why are you alone? Let's get in line! You have no problem in maintaining order. You came at the beginning. You came in the middle of the way. There was no explanation and your attitude was very cold. The overall impression was very bad. I will not check in. There were not many people in the restaurant. I waited for half an hour and asked 5 A staff member couldn't tell me how to get to the beachside western restaurant I went to! We're talking about breakfast. Are you willing to accept 188 for one person? There is a restaurant in the first and second areas of Tianyu Hotel! There is only one restaurant in your area. No matter how far you go, let the person in charge of your restaurant take his children and walk with the elders to experience it. If you stay in Building 2 and walk to Building 1, the experience will be very bad!

msg:This hotel is the worst hotel I have visited in Sanya N times, bar none. The child was sick earlier and planned to return one day early. We would not check out after providing the inspection report. We had no choice but to adjust our itinerary and book a room for one day ahead. The so-called deluxe room costs 6,000 yuan a night. After checking in, I found that the house was old and dilapidated, and the downstairs was like a junk yard. I waited for nearly two hours to check in. I went to the front desk to discuss the room and was given a room. I checked in at 3:20. The windows of the house could not be opened, the air conditioning was not effective in cooling, and I couldn't sleep well all night. Make the already uncomfortable children even more uncomfortable. The funny thing is that the manager wanted to provide me with airport drop-off service and free lunch, but I refused. I really felt that that was all we needed. Direct complaint, false advertising, not recommended to stay! ! !

Disadvantages: The cost is several times higher during holidays. The lowest price is more than 4,000 and there are no skin care products arranged every day. The price on weekdays is less than 1,000, which feels very worthless. Fruit is only available for welcome on the first day, not for the following days.

The sand is fine and clean, and there are not many people. It is very suitable for playing in the water and taking pictures. When the temperature drops, go to the constant temperature swimming pool. There are several constant temperature swimming pools in the hotel, so you don't have to worry about too many people. There is also a children's pool. The room is equipped with a small bathrobe, which is very child-friendly. From the lobby there is direct access to the swimming pool and the sea. The sea view is breathtaking. Thank you Sean for your one-on-one and attentive service throughout the entire process. He confirmed the arrival time with me one day in advance and arranged the itinerary. Things that need to be replenished in the room can also be arranged directly via WeChat. The response and implementation speed is very fast. There is also a dragon and lion dance performance on the first day of the first ***** month, and the God of Wealth brings wealth. Guests who came to watch also received chocolate gold coins and 8 yuan red envelopes. And they are all brand new banknotes. It can be seen from the details that the hotel pays great attention to them. Will stay here next time if I have a chance.
Warm winter heated swimming pools: many
New Year Fun and Fun Festival (Garden Party/Cold Fireworks Show/Children’s Fun Ding Dong Winter Camp/Xianglong Auspicious Gifts Beach Party, etc.): Interesting

Jelly contacted me in advance the day before check-in, answered many questions about hotel check-in, and sent a list of parent-child activities, dining notes, etc. in advance, and patiently answered my concerns about bed circumference, room temperature, etc.
When I arrived at the lobby on the day of check-in, they helped me check in quickly, which relieved me from the fatigue of just flying and taking a taxi to the hotel, and I also felt treated like a VIP.
Every day when I checked in, I was asked if there were any items that needed to be replenished in the room, and all the needed items were promptly given, as well as fruits.
On the day of departure, because the child needed to take a bath after playing in the water, he helped with a late check-out and gave the child a little lion doll as a souvenir.
It was very comfortable throughout the stay, allowing the whole family to play and lie down without any distractions.
I will stay at MGM again next time I come. It is really suitable for family travel. I would also like to thank Jelly Shen for her considerate service throughout the whole process.

Because my mom went swimming in the pool and didn't notice the stairs at her feet when she came up. Of course, I think this is a personal issue. Then I called housekeeping. I asked if there was Yunnan Baiyao spray, and the reply was no at that time, but after a while. The manager on duty called. He said that other depar**ents had transferred him a box of Yunnan Baiyao spray and a bucket of ice cubes. Then he asked if he could take me to the hospital. Then I said spray the medicine first and see if it feels better tomorrow morning. After my mother applied ice and spray, she felt much better the next morning, but I also expressed my gratitude to the manager on duty for his quick response and responsible attitude. My mother said that ice application was very effective. Before the ice application, the foot could not move, and he was also in pain. It might have been some internal bleeding at that time. After applying ice, I sprayed Yunnan Baiyao. The pain was gone in the morning of the second day, and then the swelling started to subside a little. The housekeeper Mengmeng is also very serious and responsible. Introduced various details of the hotel to me. We were able to respond to every request. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya. Will also recommend to friends and colleagues. There are also 5 electronic photos given by the Earl Travel Photography. Beautifully photographed.

I just think since we are a tourist city and we are talking about services, can we be more flexible?
What do you think of this sea view?

msg:I took my children on vacation. After choosing for a long time, I finally decided to go to MGM. I really made the right choice. The hotel has its own beach. It is very convenient to go to the beach right away. Because of the parent-child hotel, there are many special projects suitable for children, with rich activities, comprehensive parent-child facilities, and a cute pet paradise. Although it charges a fee, it is very cost-effective and you can enjoy various projects without leaving the hotel. Children love swimming the most. The hotel has two constant-temperature swimming pools. They are large and you can swim at night. The central swimming pool can also be used during the day. The water is very clean and the depth is moderate. The breakfast is rich in variety, with three restaurants to choose from. The Hainanese-style glutinous rice vinegar is delicious, and there are also various kinds of rice noodles that are very unique. The service of the butler Quin cannot be overemphasized. He contacted us in advance before check-in and provided attentive service throughout the entire process. In the end, he also helped us coordinate a late check-out. It was a great check-in experience.

msg:facility:
This is also my second time to come to MGM, having come five or six years ago. There are many more entertainment facilities suitable for children! I don’t have to choose the hardware facilities, but after all, Yalong Bay hotels are all old, and some problems can be accepted. In fact, it can be solved by finding a housekeeper, but we only stayed for 3 days and didn’t ask them to solve it ~ The overall room is a bit biased Chao, this is unavoidable indeed~
The big swimming pools are also under maintenance, but there are still two that can be used, but there are really many people~
Children's paradise, cute pet paradise, small trains and other things, the little friends had so much fun~ It was so exciting~
health:
When someone disturbs the room, the housekeeper will usually ask what time is appropriate and whether the bedding needs to be changed. Every time I come back, the room is disturbed and it is very tidy.
environment:
The environment is really nothing to say! It really feels like facing the sea, with spring flowers blooming, but the next day they started to decorate. As soon as I entered the door, I saw various fenced facilities, which really affected my mood. But they were all playing at the beach, and the front was decorated. Not much impact~
Serve:
For the service, I have to give special praise to my little housekeeper Nina, Wu Qipi from Niwan Seafood Restaurant, and all the brothers and sisters~ They are all really good, but I really can’t remember the names of each little cutie~
1 large 1 small cute pet paradise package:
The ladies in the cute pet paradise are also very cute~very patient with the little friends!
Summarize:
The service is good, the facilities are good, and some facilities are continuously upgraded. It is suitable for families with children to travel. There is no need to leave the hotel at all. All-inclusive in one stop? Hahaha~ My little friend said that he will come again next time~ I think this is the biggest praise~

You still need to buy a ticket to enter. There is a separate fee for feeding the pets. The temperature is constant. There are quite a lot of swimming pools.

This time I brought my children to Sanya for vacation. The facilities of MGM Sanya Hotel are first-class, and Yalong Bay C has clear sea and fine sand. The two children are very happy. The most important thing is that Tina provided full arrangement tips in advance, so that we knew what we were going to do and our itinerary was in order. Tina was attentive enough to arrange the right time for breakfast, sand digging tools for the children, and the duty-free shop shopping process. The hotel hardware is first-class and Tina's service is first-class. At the strong request of the children, I extended my stay for three nights. I am also very grateful to Tina for her warm arrangements and experienced different floors and scenery. Thank you MGM, thank you Tina!

This was great👍 and he helped me communicate in a timely manner if I needed anything during my stay. The hardware of the old MGM hotel is very good, and the sea view and beach are great. The children had a great time! On the last night, the hotel also gave me a set of sample skin care products. I really didn’t expect it. I loved it! This New Year's Eve trip was so perfect!

Service: Everyone is very enthusiastic and the butler is also very considerate. All you need to do to check out is talk to the housekeeper. Just put the room card anywhere (very convenient). If you check in early, you can check in first and store your bags. You can check in at the hotel.
Photography: It’s great that the hotel provides free photography. But my son didn’t cooperate. It’s worth making an appoin**ent if you have photography requirements.
Beach: The beach has hotel amusement equipment (payment required), such as motorboats, banana boats, etc., which are cheaper than Wuzhizhou Island. Discount for hotel guests.
Children's facilities: swimming and children's indoor/outdoor playgrounds are good. There is also custody service (paid separately), and viewing of small animals is free. If you go in and feed them, you need to pay.

All in all, the hotel is worth staying at. We first stayed at the Sheraton in Haitang Bay. My family said it was not as good as this one and we would stay here next time.

msg:This time I stayed at MGM for three nights. It was so hassle-free to take care of children.
First, let’s talk about the hardware of MGM: I booked a parent-child double bed room with a small tent, and my children liked it very much. There are several outdoor swimming pools with constant temperatures and many slides, enough for children to play. The indoor amu*****t park is open until 9 pm and the cute pet amu*****t park is open until 7 pm. We usually play in the children's amu*****t park until closing time after dinner, and then go back to the room to sleep. Overall, as a family hotel I think it's worth it.
Let’s talk about software services: Our butler this time is Sean. Every time I call, he will respond, haha. I said, "There are no more drinks and snacks in the refrigerator," and he said, "Arrange them immediately," and then I had a refrigerator full of supplies. I said "I want to play water sports" and he said "arrange it and the shuttle bus will pick me up soon". I said "I left my iPad in the restaurant" and he said "I have found it. You can go to the front desk to get it." I said "the skin care products in the room are pretty good" and he said "I will arrange a gift box for you right away." I said " Is it okay to check out late?” He said, “Is it okay to check out until 1:30?” Attentive, timely and thoughtful!
Three nights at MGM was not enough, I will come again next time!

The housekeeper Quin was also very considerate and helped us solve many problems. The swimming pool staff are very responsible and prevent outsiders from using it casually. They will ask for names and reservation status. I like their western restaurant the most, the tomahawk steak is so delicious! The 4 of us were very full. There is also the coconut chicken hotpot at Pinju Restaurant, which I order every time I come here. There are two heated swimming pools, which are very considerate on cloudy days; the slides in the children's paddling pool are also very popular. The sea in Yalong Bay is relatively calm, suitable for swimming, and there are many marine activities. Special mention should be made of the hotel's cute pet paradise. The animals are very docile and the service staff are also very nice. They take the trouble to bring out each one to experience. Just staying in a hotel can take up 3 days. Generally speaking, the children are satisfied and so are the adults. We will stay here again next time!

msg:When traveling with children, we have stayed in almost all Yalong Bay hotels. MGM is the best experience among family hotels. It is more suitable for children like me who want to play with adults. Adults can enjoy the sea breeze and drink beer. There are many activities in the hotel. , my child is almost six years old and loves it very much. Activities are arranged every day and night. If you don’t want to spend money, it’s free. The layout of the room is also very reasonable, not cramped, and large enough. The housekeeper also contacted us in advance to ask if a fence was needed, which was very considerate. The bedding is also relatively comfortable. The staff, especially Tina in the front office, are very enthusiastic, serious and responsible, and explain the activities clearly!

msg:The room was clean and tidy, and the service was excellent. We had a one-month-old baby with us, and we needed ice packs to keep our breast milk refrigerated when we went out. We called the front desk, and soon two large bowls of ice cubes were delivered from the kitchen. This happened for three days in a row. The cleaning lady would clean the room every day when we came back from going out. Even when we threw our clothes on the sofa, she folded them neatly and put them there. Fruits were placed on the first day, and when we came back the next day, there was a bunny-shaped towel placed on the big bed, which surprised us. Toiletries and consumables will be replenished in time after we go out, especially mineral water. The hotel also gave us six cans of refrigerated drinks on the first day.
Pinju’s salt-baked chicken set meal is very popular and you can’t get it without making a reservation in advance.
There are three breakfast restaurants, and my favorite is Niwan Seaview Restaurant. The environment is very nice, and you can also sit by the sea and enjoy the sea breeze while having breakfast. Also, the seafood noodles are really delicious, the prawns are especially fresh, and the salmon is also good. The service guy Adam is polite and thoughtful, and the service is in place.
Then there is Haitang Restaurant, which has a full range of dishes, but there are too many people.
The breakfast at Pinju is also good and has a complete range of varieties.
The hotel also has two constant-temperature swimming pools, which are disinfected every day until ten o'clock in the evening. The greening is also good, the lawn is very clean, and the barbecue party in the evening is super lively. You can eat seafood and drink wine while enjoying the sea breeze. In one word: beautiful! If I come to Sanya again next year, I will come here again! See you next time, MGM!

       The hotel's service is also excellent, and the staff are warm and thoughtful, able to provide guests with attentive service. The hotel arranged a service housekeeper Tina for me. She is a warm, thoughtful and beautiful girl. She communicated with us the day before check-in to understand what help we needed. After checking in, they asked us about our experience of staying in the hotel every day, and introduced the hotel's food, accommodation, transportation, and the features and locations of surrounding scenic spots and restaurants. As a colleague, I applaud her service.
        In addition, the MGM Yalong Bay Hotel is also very strategically located, just steps away from Yalong Bay Beach, where you can enjoy the wonderful experience of sun, waves and sand. The M show and parent-child activities are even better.
      Overall, MGM Yalong Bay is a very good luxury hotel. Its facilities, warm service and excellent location make it a hotel worth staying at.

It was a happy and pleasant surprise. Even at night, he responded to messages quickly, helped solve some minor problems, and took the initiative to apply for a late check-out. I would like to express my gratitude~

The service staff all smile and proactively say hello, which makes people feel comfortable. The service in all aspects is very considerate.

Put down your luggage, put on your swimsuit, and blend in with the blue sea and blue sky. After dinner, order a drink and snacks at Corona Bar while the foreign resident band sings. It gives you the illusion of being in a foreign country. It's very interesting.
The breakfast is exquisite and rich, and you will be satisfied with every bit of it.
The "Animal Paradise" on the first floor is really cute. It is recommended for anyone with children to visit it.
Earl Travel Photography left a perfect souvenir of this trip.

I have stayed at several other S and Red hotels in Yalong Bay before, and by comparison, the service at MGM is the best.

But fortunately, the suite can enjoy the semi-buffet breakfast in the seaside restaurant. You can play in the heated swimming pool. Thinking about it this way, the price/performance ratio is still good.
The overall decoration of the hotel is relatively old-fashioned, but the facilities are well maintained and there is everything you need to eat and play. You can really spend a few days there without going out.
It is said that it is a family hotel and it does have a children's playground and a lot of children's facilities.
When it comes to playing on the beach, it has to be Yalong Bay. There are hotel lounge chairs on the beach.
However, there is no convenient bottled water at the hotel beach or by the swimming pool, which is very inconvenient.

After arriving at the hotel, the room was quickly arranged. Because the child was ill in the middle, the butler Fu Huan also arranged to give fruits to the children. We supplemented with vitamin C, and arranged the time for cleaning the guest rooms in advance every day. We tried to complete all the work while we were out playing, and truly responded to our requests and fulfilled our mission. To be honest, I have stayed at the Ritz-Calton, St. Regis and Hilton in Yalong Bay before. For family vacations, I recommend MGM because there are many parent-child activities arranged in the hotel. Compared with other hotels, there are more activities in the hotel, so parents can relax. Home is more suitable for couples to vacation, and MGM is the first choice for bringing children. The hotel is good, the housekeeper is great, everything is just right. The hotel is not stingy and will give everything it can. The consumption is also transparent and there is no ink. MGM gave me a full emotional value for this vacation. I am also grateful to the housekeeper Fu Huan for all his help. Nice trip ~ BTW, the toiletries provided by the hotel taste great. I am going to go back and buy online for my daily use.

msg:I originally booked a double room with a golf view for one night, but was told that there was only a twin room. However, because I had a baby with me, I discussed it with the hotel housekeeper for a long time and upgraded it to a balcony for free for both of us when the room was difficult to find. In the garden parent-child room, I would like to thank the butler Sean for his service. Although I only stayed for one night, the hotel's facilities and parent-child entertainment facilities are still quite rich. Next time I go to Yalong Bay, I will consider staying at the MGM Hotel.

The hotel has a beautiful environment and there is an M show performance in the evening. Guest relations manager Fu Huan contacted me in advance to inquire about my check-in requirements and needs, and helped arrange the room. When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in directly without much waiting. Thank you very much. During the stay, I kept asking for caring and heart-warming reminders, which really made people happy and warm. The hotel room is big, clean, and smells good. I met the room attendant Olivia Wang Ziyin several times during my stay. She was friendly and helped the children set up tents and play areas, etc. I am very grateful. There is also a new cute pet paradise, which is so fun. Adults and children have a lot of fun interacting with small animals in it. I really like this hotel.

The first stop of this trip to Sanya was Yalong Bay. After careful selection, I chose MGM. After all, it is more convenient to be connected to the beach.

First of all, when you check in, the lady at the front desk has a very good service attitude. She is gentle, meticulous and quick. Order one.

However, the check-in room was provided by an intern, and the service attitude was hard to describe. I was really shocked. Is this the service attitude that was so praised in the MGM comment section?

Fortunately, the follow-up butler Jerry helped solve the problem and tried his best to restore the impression of MGM. His service was indeed very attentive➕meticulous.

He also took us around the whole park and introduced the characteristics of each place, such as meals, etc., including some reservation services. He also helped us. Give Jerry a thumbs up.

Let’s talk about the hotel hardware.
It is indeed old, but not old. It can be seen that the hotel is carefully managed and maintained.
The basics such as wet and dry separation/bathtub/small refrigerator are all in place. I booked a swimming pool room on the first floor. The swimming pool will be cleaned regularly every day, but there are inevitably a lot of mosquitoes. I hope this can be added. strengthen

Everything else is quite satisfactory. The private beach is also connected with other hotels. I would like to say that the sand in Yalong Bay is still not as fine as Haitang Bay. I always feel that it is different from when I came here a few years ago.

p.s. I didn’t touch the child facilities in the hotel. After all, I came here with my friends. The hotel is still suitable for families with children...there are so many children...

Breakfast was mediocre and very messy during peak hours. There was no time to clean up. The swimming pool did not feel constant temperature at all and the water quality was terrible. The child's eyelids became red after playing for 2 days and he developed yellow eye feces, which are typical symptoms of conjunctivitis. The steak at the seaside restaurant was medium rare and could not be chewed. I’ve been to Sanya so many times and this is one of those restaurants I won’t go to again. Even the kids think it’s bad. The attitude of the staff at anyway is OK, but it’s a pity that it’s really disappointing overall.

In addition, I would also like to thank the hotel room staff Monica Chenmei for keeping the room clean every day. We would also like to thank the hotel lifeguard for promptly helping the children playing alone in the swimming pool find us. Several restaurants in the hotel are highly recommended. They taste very good, especially the salt-baked chicken, which is so delicious. The hotel actually also provides babysitting services, which can be used for a half-day or a full-day trip, which is a liberating journey. In short, I would like to thank all the staff at the MGM Hotel. Because of your hard work, this stay was a great experience. I have already made an appoin**ent with my friends to take the children here for a walk next time.

As soon as we arrived in the hotel lobby, the housekeeper Xiao Shen was waiting for us, helping us check in, coordinating the room with a good view, and introducing us. The activities during the festival helped us prepare a lot of children's facilities and toys, which was great! The location, activities and scenery of the hotel are all very good👍🏻

The services provided were quite good, and the room arrangement was particularly good. Even though it was a holiday, the hotel service was still able to keep up with it in a timely manner. The cleaning lady and brother are also very prompt. There are staff everywhere in the corridor, ready to provide services. The local dishes in the hotel's Hainan breakfast restaurant are delicious and authentic, and there are not many queues, which is very good. The hotel also has a lot of activities for children, with many entertainment options. There are many children in the swimming pool, but the staff are also very good and feel safe. If you are traveling with your family, I highly recommend MGM. I will come back next time. Thank you again Miss Candy, like 👍

It is very convenient to go up and downstairs, especially for swimming. You can enter the water by opening the window and it is very quiet.
There are not many people on the hotel's beach, so you don't have to worry about crowds when taking photos. There are many types of restaurants and performances, which is suitable for those who enjoy a slow-paced vacation. You can have fun here just eating, sleeping and playing. There are so many items in the package that I don’t even have time to play, but you must go to the entertainment party at 8 o’clock in the evening. There are few people and it is quiet. With the moonlight and waves, you can watch the performances of beautiful and handsome guys up close.
This time I had a butler, Candy Xiao Tang, who was added to my stay. The service was very good and his attitude was enthusiastic. He was very considerate and answered all my questions. He also gave me fruits. Will come next time^_^

The butler Candy's service is very good. She added WeChat one day in advance and sent an introduction to the hotel and activities. After checking in, she will always ask if there is anything she needs. She will also help solve all the questions and requests raised during the period. Thank you very much👍The hotel environment is great. Very photogenic, suitable for friends who want to take photos and check in. There is a special children's swimming pool, which is more suitable for small children to play than the Yate we went to before. At least my son no longer clings to me and doesn't want to go into the water. Breakfast is at the Niwan Seaview Restaurant, which is half a la carte and half buffet. It's not big, but you can sit outside. It's very comfortable to have breakfast while enjoying the sea breeze. The seafood noodles and fried chicken steak are delicious and are freshly made. It's rare that our two children had a good breakfast. Overall, this hotel stay experience was pretty good👍

msg:First of all, MGM has a very good sense of design, and it is the best choice for vacationing with children ⛱️⛱️⛱️, as soon as you enter the hotel lobby, there will be performances and dolls, and the two treasures will run after the big white bear. Secondly, the hardware and software facilities of the hotel are good, and the shampoo and shower gel are not bad. I strongly recommend the terrace room with garden and sea view. It has a really big terrace, and there are some facilities and children’s playthings, mainly for drying clothes. The softness and firmness of the mattress in the room is also quite suitable, and a single bed is specially added for the two children. It is quite comfortable to sleep, and the two children are also very happy! The overall style of the hotel is very special, full of design style, very charming. Take Liang Bao to go snorkeling every day 🤿 to catch small fish, there are many fish schools 5-6 meters down from the beach of the hotel! All the facilities are very friendly to children, including Children’s Paradise, Cute Pet Paradise (meerkat “Dingman” Xiaoke and Lele and Wallaby Meimei), and traveling through the jungle (big bag to play the sky project, Xiaobao can only play when he is under 10 years old) On the ground, Dabao walks around for 20 minutes with a coach following the whole process), Linhai zip line (the two treasures said it was very exciting, but they still want to play, and played twice), swimming pool park (the small speakers are not tired of playing and keep queuing up, children The irresistible swimming pool bubble party 🎉🎉🎉, the children had a great time, and brought a lot of joy to our family in a few days! The service of the hotel butler Candy is great, very caring, and makes people feel good. The hotel There are 3 restaurants for breakfast, but we only ate one. There are many types of breakfast, and the food is very good. The hotel restaurant is also very good. Dross vinegar seafood hot pot, salt-baked coconut chicken, and steamed Dongxingban are all delicious. At night There are more activities (various performances), and there are quite a variety of barbecue buffets at the seaside swimming pool, and the taste is also good! Because we played too much and didn’t pay attention to rest, on the fourth day, Xiaobao and Xiaobao got acute gastroenteritis, and ended up going to the People’s Liberation Army Hainan Hospital to play One day 😭😭😭, I wasted a whole day not being able to play in the hotel. When I came back in the afternoon, Candy kindly sent two bowls of porridge and side dishes to the room. I really felt very considerate. Another recommendation is Bojue Travel Photography. I took pictures at Sunny Bay Park Hyatt last month and it was very good, so I brought my baby to take another set this month, and all the photos were very good, so I kept them all! I will choose Sanya Yalong Bay for my baby next time. MGM!

This is my second time staying at MGM Sanya. The service, environment, facilities, and hygiene are as good as ever! excellent!
This time I mainly stayed at the Westin Wanning, which is a little more niche.
After staying here in Yalong Bay, I compared St. Regis, Hilton, etc., but I still like MGM the best. I love it!
The housekeeper Nina's service is also very cordial and enthusiastic. She considers the hotel guests thoughtfully and recommends activities. This stay was mainly for vacation, so I didn’t go to many tourist attractions. I mainly stayed in the hotel!
I will stay at his house next time, and I don’t plan to change hotels. The experience both times was as good as ever! Although the hotel is very old, it is well maintained and is almost like a new hotel!
Nice! ! !

They are all parents and children with parents and children, and the face recognition system is relatively slow and needs to be improved. Wait time is long. The check-in experience was not very friendly.
The internal facilities of the hotel are relatively old. We booked a room with a swimming pool, and many charging sockets could not be used. We took a mopboard from the customer service. There is only cable TV in the guest room. For children who can’t go out to play in the sun at noon, and refuse to take a nap, it’s really unhappy to watch on-demand video. I hope the hotel needs to be improved.
I would like to praise the hotel's guest room hotline. Our children like to play paddle boards. We made a reservation with the service depar**ent when we first arrived. After playing for a whole day, we were very happy. Secondary, bathrobes and bath towels are available.
It is also suggested that the hotel can set up dryer and washing machine areas in some areas, and now many hotels already have their own self-service. When you come to Hainan to play, children playing in the water will not dry their clothes, but if there is a drying self-service area, it will be very convenient for us. It was raining during this stay, and the clothes could have been dried, but I didn't have time to collect them, so I didn't dry my uncle. The guest room does not provide drying clothes independently. It is very inconvenient to make an appoin**ent for drying and washing. Hope the hotel can improve.
Here, I would like to thank our room steward TOM, who can help solve many problems. Before leaving, he gave our children gifts, thank you.

Before check-in, MGM has a housekeeper who will contact you in advance to arrange the room and other matters. The front office is very responsible and very patient. If you encounter any problems, you can solve them properly as soon as possible. Notify the girl’s birthday that not only the room is arranged in advance, but also the birthday cake is given to the girl.

This time I experienced the hotel’s attentive butler service and comprehensive family facilities that really impressed me. Facilities suitable for babies include a cute pet park, playground, go-karts, children's swimming pools, free sand digging tools on the beach, and many heated swimming pools, all suitable for little ones. The safety facilities are also well thought out. There are at least 2 safety guards beside each swimming pool, and there are also many staff and safety patrols at the beach.
The day before the trip, Minnie, the deputy front office manager, added a friend and asked carefully about her needs before the trip. On the day of check-in, the room was already decorated with bed surrounds, a small tent, slippers suitable for the baby's size, and thoughtful decoration of the room. During my stay, every question I had was answered very quickly. They also helped us coordinate vegetable porridge for my baby during the barbecue. I was very touched. From checking in to booking the hotel shuttle bus, the experience in just a few days made me feel at home, and I was even given a thoughtful gift before leaving. Thank you Minnie. I will definitely come back to MGM next time I travel to Sanya! Looking forward to the next trip.

msg:First, let’s talk about the many advantages:
1. Facilities. Although the decoration of the room is a bit dated, the furniture is of good quality and well maintained. The glass door of the balcony is of good quality and has good sound insulation. The room had no smell.
2. Scenery. The beach is very clean and delicate, which is inseparable from the fact that the staff are often cleaning up garbage. The hotel's lawn and swimming pool are well maintained. There is a check-in point for internet celebrities to take photos and produce videos.
3. Service. The butler service is perfect, especially the guest manager Sean, who has a good image and temperament, is in good spirits, and has a positive service attitude. He informed me of the hotel's map, activities, and hotel rights one day in advance. After I checked in, he informed me of the dining and hotel performances, etc. They also gave me a souvenir when I left the hotel. When they gave me the souvenir, they did not immediately ask for a good review. This must be praised. Unlike some hotels that say that if you give me a good review, you will receive a gift. It gives people the feeling of making a deal. There will be waiters to help with luggage when entering the hotel, and the front desk also provides standard smile service when checking in.
4. Catering. There are many varieties of breakfast, freshly squeezed juices, and many varieties of fruit pastries. The restaurant environment is good, with high floors and wide seat spacing. The minibar is free on the first day, with coffee options including latte and American style, and cola with or without sugar.
It is impossible to be perfect in the service industry. Here are some suggestions:
1. It is recommended to put a pack of tissue paper on the table in the room instead of just in the bathroom;
2. It is recommended to put bath towels and water dispensers next to the swimming pool (of course there may be, but I didn't see them);
3. It would be even better if there is a Bluetooth speaker in the room.
Finally, send me pictures of the hotel.

msg:Before booking the MGM Hotel, my husband and I had checked many Sanya hotel guides, and the children’s activities in some hotels were basically the same. What attracts us about the facilities is the hotel's all-day children's activities. The Children's Dreamland is really large and full of amu*****t facilities. The most special ones are the children's swimming pool and the pet park. The children's swimming pool has a large slide and lifeguards. The water mouth is protected, which is really considerate and reassuring. There are many kinds of small animals in the pet park. It is a popular science for children and the interaction is very interesting. Cats, pet snakes, chinchillas, alpacas, kangaroos, mink, chipmunks, rabbits , Little Pig, etc... These projects can keep children in the hotel for two or three days.
There are also many swimming pools, including adult swimming pools, children's swimming pools, and a swimming pool that can be heated in winter. However, the weather in Sanya is not yet suitable for use. I will come back to experience it during the winter vacation. There is also a party pool on the map, but I have never seen a party.
Let’s talk about service. When we arrived at the hotel, because there were a lot of people queuing at the front desk and my husband had a hard time holding the child while he was asleep, the porter came over to help me pick up my luggage and took me to the front desk to go through the formalities. The front desk manager, a girl named mikolu, took me to a seat where there was no queue, and asked my husband to swipe his ID card and go to the sofa first while holding his sleeping child. They adjusted a room for us that we could check in immediately. We specifically asked about our hotel preferences. After getting the room card, we asked a girl to take our luggage and take us to the room. It was really heartwarming. MGM is really the right choice for your family trip. (Also because we arrived at the hotel earlier, we didn’t expect to be able to check into the room so quickly)
We live in Building 1, and downstairs are the breakfast room, children's play area, and Chinese restaurant, so we can get off the elevator every time we eat!
The room is designed in a resort style, with dim lighting. You can't put makeup on in the bathroom, so you can put it on the window sill. This is acceptable. The bed in the room is large and can be equipped with guardrails. I feel more at ease when sleeping because I don't have to worry about the child falling in the middle of the night. Shortly after checking in, we received baby toiletries as well as bathrobes, slippers, and a step board. I have to say, I forgot to ask this, but the front desk was able to surprise me.
Secondly, it’s about hygiene. I really don’t know why some people in the reviews would have hygiene issues when staying here. Everywhere in our room was clean and tidy, including the balcony. [Namaste] Originally, disposable bedding was provided, but the hotel’s bedding was Really dry and clean, very comfortable to sleep on.
When I left on the last day, the children were reluctant to leave. See you next time at MGM!

There was a lot of mineral water, and I went out to play after the first day. When I came back, I wiped the floor in the room, refilled the drinks, gave us a lot of mineral water, and even folded our clothes! It's so heartwarming. The only drawback may be that it is too busy. I feel that the service staff in various places are very arrogant and irritable. I think others have butler service, but I don't. I don't know about children's activities, so I have to call the front desk one by one to ask. Only the service at the evening buffet was particularly good, especially the cashier girl whose surname was Deng, who also gave the children candied haws! Very good attitude. So the happiest thing for me was going to see the M Show and having the buffet at night, and the waiters all greeted me with smiles. The beach loungers are better and more comfortable than a row of other hotels. The pool is generally a bit small. Children's programs are suitable for younger children. All in all, I was reluctant to leave after staying for two days! In addition to the service, it is highly recommended

msg:Except for the housekeeper, the hotel is useless. I really want to persuade you to leave! !
I placed an order around 10pm on the night before I checked in, but my period came early at 11pm the next day, which made me feel uncomfortable. I wanted to change my ticket and go home that day. I applied to cancel the order around 11pm, but the hotel refused, so I followed the hotel regulations. I checked in at three o'clock in the afternoon. The reserved room was not cleaned, so the front desk opened another room to rest. This was very humane. The room was cleaned around three-thirty. Later, my physical discomfort worsened, and I was the only one with a child, so I called Ctrip customer service and asked for negotiation to cancel the order for the second night. Ctrip customer service replied that the hotel sales manager asked me to show my changed ticket before canceling the order. I asked the hotel to first make a promise to Ctrip customer service to cancel my booking before I could change my booking. So I was asked to wait for news, but there was no reply until I urged me a second time. Ctrip customer service said that they had given me a guarantee that they would cancel, so I dared to change my booking and change my booking. Prove it to the steward! ! !
Make complaints:
1. The hotel facilities are old, the lamps and lanterns in the bathtub are yellow, the shower room is small, there are no paper towels in the room, the bedside socket design is weird, the long plug will fall off when plugged in, the equipment noise can be heard at night, and the sound insulation is not good. I heard the voice of the father next door preaching to the children. I had never been bitten by mosquitoes in other hotels in the previous six nights. I was bitten in this hotel. I was woken up several times by the sound of some small insects when I slept at night.
2. The front desk was okay when I checked in, but there was no one checking out when I checked out. Two front desk service staff and one customer stood in front of me. I saw that the customer in front of me was looking at his mobile phone and didn't say anything, so I said it to a male receptionist. After checking out twice, he ignored me and ran out to get takeout. The suitcase was relatively heavy. Because of my sore and bad waist, I wanted the concierge to help me take me to the parking lot. The concierge refused and said they couldn't go to the parking lot. ! Just don’t allow other hotels to provide me with underground parking lots and help me load my car!
3. Breakfast is hard to explain. When I went to one of the restaurants, the waiter said, why don't you go to another restaurant? We have to queue up here. I also have to queue up when I go to another restaurant! The first time I encountered a hotel where I had to queue up to eat, it was because the restaurant was so small! There isn’t much variety to eat.
4. The first Ctrip customer service said that you are a foreign brand hotel after all, Vocal, what a big statement. You, the sales manager of such a foreign brand hotel, even pocketed my more than 2,000 yuan per night room fee. I told me clearly that I was feeling unwell, but if Ctrip customer service hadn’t helped me later, the sales manager would have lost my job if I was short of several thousand dollars! I was also required to show proof that I had not booked any other competing hotels for my change of booking! You really can't afford it!

msg:The room was comfortable and spacious because they gave us a family style room and they gave me a lot of extras like shampoo and bubble bath etc.

I love that they offer you a variety of dining options in the room to make your stay comfortable. There are even beaches and lifeguards who can tell you when the ideal time of day is for swimming. My only concern is that there is no adult pool as there are so many kids, sometimes you just want some quiet and space to swim especially when you don't have kids, but this one in particular other hotels don't offer adult pools and I never got the chance Swimming as it's always busy, no room to swim in the pool and lots of kids and all kinds of other stuff so swimming doesn't really appeal to me, it's something I'm looking forward to doing

I think the staff here are really nice and attentive. I was so angry with the check-in service, even though I was the one who booked and paid for the hotel, they chose to ignore me, even though I spoke Chinese to them, they only spoke to my Chinese friend, they even added the name of the wifi to him name and added his WeChat to speak only to him. I know it's easier to speak in your native language, it's not a big deal, I totally understand. This strikes me as a bit contemptuous, but I understand that this is not intended to offend me

I love that they offer photographers to capture your special moments, which is very exciting and they have a lot of services at the hotel, especially if you have kids. Overall, I enjoyed staying at this hotel and I will recommend it to many of my friends

Facilities: The room is pretty good, suitable for parents who have children and want to rest. Work in the room and the children swim by themselves. The hotel has many swimming pools, several large and small, and children like the slides in the children's area. Have fun lining up in bubbles. The cute pet paradise is also very good, and the children enjoyed playing there for a long time. The indoor playground is also huge. In short, it is really good to bring children to MGM. Don’t consider it if you are a couple on vacation, there are too many children.

Service: Like Mengmeng in the front office, call in advance and add WeChat. There are messages every morning and evening to remind you of the weather and various matters. I also care about whether there is health service, give her a thumbs up 👍 She is more attentive than another hotel housekeeper!

The hotel actually provides half-day child care for free, which is so considerate. However, the swimming pool is relatively simple, with a depth of 1.2.

Seeing the small tent and the wooden horse, I was delighted. The butler, Sean, was very nice. He patiently and enthusiastically answered my questions one by one. The hotel also has a lot of things to do. The most delicious thing is to get up in the morning and have breakfast, throw the baby in the trusteeship, and then go to take beautiful photos. The price of a fruit supermarket is quite conscientious. I bought a mango for 15 and a coconut for 20. When we checked out, the housekeeper even helped us to delay the delay until 1:30 because she was resting and couldn’t come to see us off. She even prepared a gift for us. Don't be too considerate👍🏻It's a pity that I only stayed for one night this time, and I will definitely stay a few more nights next time

There are complete facilities for children to play in the hotel, and there are multiple swimming pools. We booked a suite, so there is a separate swimming pool specially opened for suites. , less crowded, clean, the swimming pool is connected to the beach and the sea, which is also the exclusive beach of the hotel, so it is very clean 👍 The parent-child suite we live in is really amazing, with one bedroom, two living rooms, two bathrooms and a cloakroom. Open the floor-to-ceiling windows and you will find a huge balcony , the family is sitting on the balcony eating barbecue and enjoying the beautiful sea view, don't be too cozy! The housekeeper Barton is warm and considerate. He added WeChat the day before the trip and introduced the hotel's food, drink, accommodation and various parent-child activities in detail. When we arrived at the hotel earlier in the day, he arranged for us to go to the children's playground first. After the room was cleaned Notify us that we can check in as soon as possible and send the room card to me, and help us refill multiple bottles of drinks for free every day🥤, great! During the stay in the hotel, if you have any questions, you will come to Barton, and he will respond and deal with them as soon as possible. The experience of staying in the hotel is really great, and the children don’t want to leave after playing. Next time you come to Sanya, you must choose MGM!

msg:The facilities of MGM Resorts are very complete. When entering the lobby, the architectural design of the lobby is very artistic. There is an activity reservation counter exclusively for children in the lobby, where you can receive hotel activities, and you can also consult if you have any questions. In addition, I should mention that the hotel facilities have special children's swimming pools and children's water parks. They are all new and look newly renovated. There are security guards on duty in each swimming pool area. This is a sense of security for us. . Children's swimming pool, children's water park, cute pet park, children's dream world and children's heart park are undoubtedly the children's favorite places, and the most important thing is that these are free to play. In addition to children's activities, adults can relax in the SPA and relieve the fatigue of a long day of travel, as well as yoga, ziplines, go-karts and other activities. When running in the morning, there are many small animals (squirrels, birds, etc.) on the trails of the hotel, which is very comfortable. There are several specialty restaurants in the hotel, the poolside buffet restaurant (there will be a MGM show in the evening), Pinju Restaurant (Hainan specialties), Jinhui Restaurant (Cantonese cuisine), Niwan Seaview Restaurant (seafood restaurant with sea view) , the food is good, the service is also very good, warm and considerate. Let's talk about the hotel's services. When we went through the formalities at the front desk, the front desk staff enthusiastically handled it for us, introduced how to get the activity list and package, and carefully reminded the specific location of some facilities. In the corridor back to the room, the room attendant also greeted me warmly. In the past few days of our stay, the hotel's warm and considerate service has made us feel good about the hotel. On the second day, due to some unhappiness, the lobby manager Xiao Lu solved it for me in time, allowing my family to eliminate the dissatisfaction caused by this small accident. The high efficiency and professionalism of the hotel are worthy of recognition. Before checking in, I was still a little apprehensive when I saw the bad reviews on the Internet, but after checking in, I found that the experience was really great. There is no perfect hotel, no perfect service, but there must be continuous and progressive management. In addition, the hotel also has a special bus that can be sent to some hotels in Haitang Bay for free! ! The porter at the gate helped us make an appoin**ent for the bus. Before departure, the MGM bus was waiting in the lobby, which was really heartwarming. In general, we are very satisfied with the MGM Hotel this time, with complete facilities, thoughtful and considerate service (especially the care and greetings during Xiaolu's period), and various children's activities, which made us spend a very pleasant summer vacation.

msg:During this trip to Sanya, I booked three hotels in Sanya Bay, Yalong Bay, and Haitang Bay. I wanted to experience more. MGM was the second hotel I stayed in. I saw a lot of bad reviews before booking, and I was a little worried, but I was very satisfied after checking in. I want to make MGM a good name!

Facilities: It can be seen that it is an old hotel. It should be considered quite luxurious many years ago. This time I stayed in a full sea view room. The location is very good. The room maintenance is not very old. The double-sided table and dry and wet separation are very convenient. Each room is equipped with an Hermes orange beach bag, which really won my heart.

Environment: The lobby is very cool, and the check-in process is a little slow. Fortunately, the room was cleaned when checking in. I was lucky to check in directly without waiting for the room. I came from Sanya Bay. This is indeed a parent-child hotel. There are too many children. The hotel is very close to the beach. You can feel that the hotel environment is very atmospheric when you go to the beach from the lobby. The swimming pool is not small, and there is surfing. The children are very excited. There are many types of breakfast, and different dishes are changed every day. We went there around 8 o'clock without queuing. The service staff led us to the table and cleared the table in time. There is also a children's dining area that is particularly cute.

Service: Finally, let's talk about the service. In fact, the most important thing about staying in a hotel is the service. Sean, the butler of MGM, called one day in advance to confirm the check-in time and needs and added WeChat. He first sent the hotel introduction and activities. After checking in, Sean introduced the dinner location and sent welcome fruits. Since two adults and one child felt that the big bed was a bit crowded, Sean coordinated to add a bed for us. Thank you very much! On the second day, he would take the initiative to ask us what we needed to add to the room and the cleaning time. On the third day, he reminded us of the check-out fee and helped to delay the check-out. As long as there is a need, Sean can respond and meet it in time. In the end, he also sent a little lion, which made our MGM trip very successful. Thank you butler Sean! ! !

This time, I give full marks to the MGM stay experience because of the service of butler Sean. I will come again in the future!

msg:This is the second time I’ve stayed here with my kids, and it’s worse every time.
1. Two big ones and two small ones. The pool room on the first floor booked is close to 5,000 yuan per night. The total for 5 nights is more than 24,000 yuan. The original room includes 2 breakfasts and an extra bed. The extra bed is 1,500 yuan including one. Breakfast for one person, excluding breakfast, is 1,300 yuan for a bed, and breakfast for one person is also added, so the room has three breakfasts. Children as young as 4 years old do not need to buy breakfast separately; as a result, going to eat every morning is like checking for spies. You have to tell the staff for a long time every morning. Since you have entered the faces and added breakfast, please ask your system or personnel to record the situation of each room! The family went to eat separately, and they forced the family to make up for the breakfast without checking it. The hotel did not manage it well. The guest had bought breakfast before, so he insisted on making the guest buy again. After checking, the breakfast fee was refunded, and the result was that the next day , it was still like this on the third day. This level of management is really speechless! ! !
2. The euphemistic name of having a butler service turns out to be just a formality. I send messages without replying. I just call the hotel front desk for everything. What’s the point of having a butler like this? It was said that the housekeeper was busy. I stayed for 5 days. I passed by the front lobby every day and observed that there were very few people in the morning and afternoon. There were just a little more people from 12 o'clock to 3.30 pm every day. I was busy taking a rest. To sum up in one word, lazy! ! There are some items included in the room rate that no hotel staff has introduced, and they also provide butler service. It’s really funny!

I didn't feel good at the time, so it was very considerate to go to Hilton for service. I was a little nervous about booking MGM this time, but I liked this room type with three beds (one is 2 meters, the other is 1.5 meters + 1.5 meters that can be pulled out), two bathrooms, and three washstands. Two bathrooms are convenient for parents and children to live together. After check-in, the proactive and considerate service of the housekeeper Nina made my stay at MGM very good. Sometimes I need to contact the housekeeper for service at a very late hour, and they will solve it as soon as possible. Thank you. Even the more picky old people think it is very good. Let me regain my confidence in MGM. Parent-child activities have given my baby a different experience (fireflies) and warm service. I will choose this place again when I come to Yalong Bay in the future.

After checking in, the butler Jerry called to greet the check-in situation and added WeChat, introduced various services of the hotel, presented the room fruit plate and a little lion, and thanked the butler for his service!
The hotel has a variety of parent-child activities every day, and the hot show highlights the theme of MGM American style. It feels very comfortable to watch the show by the pool. The hotel's own beach is also good, but I feel that this year's beach is not so delicate and slightly rough. The hotel welcome service is very timely, the room service is also very considerate, and the cleaning is timely.
The most important thing is that it is very convenient to eat in the three restaurants of the hotel. I really like the Hainan noodles and dross vinegar powder in the Hainan restaurant. The buffet dishes in the morning are okay. Each dish ordered for dinner needs to be charged with 10% service charge and 2% tax. It’s a bit more expensive, but it’s convenient to eat alone. Of course, you can also choose to order takeaway. The feeling of children staying in a hotel is still very good.

Fortunately, after communicating with the service depar**ent and the housekeeper Nina, I changed the two double beds with a balcony, and I feel much better. Of course, I don’t have too much hope for the service. As a diamond card user of a certain meal, if I leave a hotel where I can enjoy various exclusive rights and go to a hotel without members and have never stayed in a hotel, I will be disappointed if I have expectations. After changing rooms, I had a great time staying for two days. The a**osphere created by the hotel as a whole was very pleasant. It can definitely make up for the long opening time, and there is nothing to say about the hardware equipment, breakfast and bedding, and it is very comfortable to sleep and eat. The air conditioner and shower comfort are very good.
The most important thing is that the children, wife and family were happy, played the hotel's water sports, and finally left Sanya happily. In addition, Nina's call before check-in, daily greetings and reminders during check-in, and check-out care. The implementation of the three hundred percent shows that the hotel's implementation of service quality requirements is still good. Finally, put a few photos of the trip, come and stay again if you have a chance.

I stayed for two days and really enjoyed myself, the swimming pool is just outside the door. Although the decoration of the hotel is not very new, but the housekeeper Bella is responsive, and the hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. I read the comments before saying that the breakfast was not good, so I was mentally prepared, but the actual breakfast was also very rich, and my family thought it was more than the one at the MGM next door. The fly in the oin**ent is that the service of the waiters in the hotel's Chinese restaurant needs to be improved. I ate there for breakfast and had Chinese food once. The waiters were unprofessional, a little impatient, and forgot to improve. I will consider staying next time I have the opportunity

The sea view room has a balcony, and the view is good! But the sanitation is average. There are blurred stains on the glass and the mirror. I can’t see people clearly. When I first came in, there was a spicy smell. Later, the cleaning brought the air purifier, but it didn’t disperse much.

Service: When you enter the lobby and check in, there are many people with children. It is quite noisy! The front desk staff are not so enthusiastic about five-star hotels. This time I stayed in 3 hotels in Sanya, and this is the hotel with the most average service. I can’t say that the service is not good, I can only say that it is basic at this price It means no service. It’s not as good as some platforms say. After checking in, let’s add the butler’s WeChat account. After adding it, I didn’t say anything. I have to take the initiative to ask about parent-child activities. In the end, it’s all in the cloud In the fog, I don't know what to participate in, and the answers are not so professional. Fortunately, I only stayed for one night.

Environment: The infrastructure is okay but the activities are not fun! Children over 6 years old will feel childish. Especially Children's Dream World, a small place. Parent-child activities are also very low and boring. There is no place for entertainment except the swimming pool! I don’t know why many platforms say that MGM is the ceiling of the family hotel in Yalong Bay. It’s a bit exaggerated. There is nothing else except going to the swimming pool to play in the water. There is not even a water world.

Breakfast: The variety is rich but the taste is very average.

All in all, a hotel with very low cost performance

msg:I have been to Yalong Bay several times, and this is the first time I stayed at MGM. Because I brought children, I wanted to dig sand and catch crabs by the sea. It was too hot at noon and there was a children's playground indoors. I saw that there were many parent-child activities introduced by MGM. The hotel is also close to Tianyu. The beach of Tianyu has always been Yalong Bay. Best sandy beach.
       Taking the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I booked a hotel one week in advance. Although the reviews said that the hotels on Yalong Bay are basically old, after lowering my psychological expectations, I think MGM’s rooms are better than expected. I booked the hotel one week in advance and checked in. At that time, the hotel automatically upgraded from a deluxe sea view room to a supreme sea view room. When I arrived at the hotel at 3:00 p.m., I could check in without waiting after the check-in procedure. I also gave you fruits when I checked in. The butler Sean was also very nice, and he answered every question and dealt with it It was very timely. I didn't see the little lion doll when I checked in. The child was very disappointed. I reported it to Sean and immediately applied for one. The child received it immediately and was very happy.
      There are also a lot of parent-child activities in the hotel, such as children's playground, bubble pool, you can play all day in the hotel. The bojue follow-up photo given by the hotel. After the appoin**ent is made, I will contact you in advance. The photographer is very good at motivating the children. My children usually don’t like to take pictures. This time, I was happy to cooperate with the photographer to take a lot of beautiful photos. The parent-child series was taken, and the video was taken The teacher captured the photos very well, and I can’t see the wallet... The hotel only gave 5 photos, 15 seconds of short video, which is not enough.
       The Yalong Bay government backfilled the sand last year. The beach is not as fine as it used to be. You can still see the original white sand near the hotel. The backfill is yellow sand with more broken shells, which is not as good as the original sand. The hotel's private beach is relatively steep. Fortunately, it is not far from Tianyu. The beach of Tianyu is relatively flat, especially after low tide reveals a large area of ​​fine and flat sand, which is especially suitable for digging sand castles. The hotel provides free sand digging tools at the beach, so there is no need to bring your own.
        The swimming pool is divided into the main swimming pool, the bubble party pool, and the children's water park (the children's water park is under maintenance recently, so there is no need to play, there is also a children's park in Tianyu, if you really want to play, just go and rub it cheekily). There are water gun fights and bubble parties in the bubble party swimming pool. The coach is very good at driving the a**osphere. The baby likes the water gun fight the most. There are also gold coins to collect, which can be exchanged for gifts at Children's Dream World (indoor children's playground). There are performances by the pool every night, which is very lively. The sound insulation effect of the room is good, and the room is basically not affected by the bustle outside.
        The location of MGM is quite good. On the first day of my stay, I ate the salt-baked chicken set meal at Pinju Hainan Restaurant. Every dish in the set meal was very suitable for my taste. MGM's breakfast is really average, but it's very convenient to eat around. There is a courier cabinet in front of the lobby. The swim rings will arrive on the same day when you order them on the same day. It is very convenient to order pizza for delivery.
       If you bring children (young age), if you want to live in Yalong Bay, MGM is still a good choice.

msg:I have been to Hainan many times, and the itinerary for this May Day trip is very simple: hotel leisure tour!

First comment on the four restaurants in MGM:
Jinhui Chinese Restaurant: Mainly Cantonese cuisine. Personally, I think the environment, service and dishes are all very good. The price is about the same as the reviews. If you want to eat enough, it should be at least 280 yuan per person.
Pinju Hainan Restaurant: mainly Hainanese dishes, with some Sichuan dishes, the portions are relatively large, and the price is high
Niwan: The location is the best, right next to the beach, I went to have two breakfasts, mainly western food, from the breakfast point of view, the quality should be good
Poolside barbecue buffet: I didn't finish the meal. I wanted to eat at 7:30 on the first night at the hotel. The waiter kindly reminded me that there were not many dishes. I suggest you come back tomorrow night. There are mixed reviews on this restaurant, and the environment by the pool is really average, so I'm not interested in trying it again.

There are many entertainment activities in the hotel, and many swimming pools are not deep. Children with a height of 1.4m do not need to wear swimming rings. There is a beach in the backyard of the hotel. At night, I took my children to dig crabs. Some people took their children to dig crabs. We hired one for 200 yuan and half an hour. We taught the children how to find crab holes and helped three children each dig a crab. Children happy [candy]

MGM will arrange butlers in advance and track services. Like the butler Tina.

In short, the experience of staying in the hotel for two nights is still very good, eating, drinking and having fun can be solved in the hotel.

Friendly reminder: The sundry store opposite Pinju Hainan Restaurant in Building 1 is a rip off. I bought a pair of beach pants for 398 yuan. The brand is Gailang. I checked it online for about 60 yuan. For shopping, you can go to the nearby Baihuagu Commercial Center and walk about 600 meters.

The parent-child activities are fully arranged. Every day, the beach, swimming pool and room are three o'clock and one line. The children have a good time and hardly need to leave the hotel. I ate salt-baked chicken at Pinju Restaurant, and it tasted great.
In addition, I would like to thank the housekeeper Jelly for her meticulous care and care, and gave us welcome fruits and little lions.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose MGM.

The hotel lobby passes a swimming pool leading directly to the sea. There are various water sports to choose from.

Not to mention the breakfast, which is extremely rich, with a variety of options for adults and children, all of which can be taken care of. The hotel also has a lot of entertainment for adults and children. It is not a problem to play here for three days and three nights. Last but not least, I want to mention Fu Huan, the housekeeper. I will contact you in advance before you check in and give you various activities and precautions for the hotel. She will also care about the itinerary and needs from time to time every day. She is really considerate. I will return to you next time. will find Fu Huan

I was given a seaside room on the 9th floor, close to the mangroves. It is the supreme room type package. It was originally called exclusive, but the name was changed after the price was reduced. In fact, the room type is one type. Ctrip's customer service is okay. After I checked in, I contacted the hotel. In the end, both of our rooms were extended to check out at 2 o'clock, just to go to the airport. The old lady stayed for two nights and changed 3 rooms.
I am satisfied that the water drinks in the hotel can be called to the front desk to ask them to increase, and the room can also be cleaned on the same day. The bathrobes and towels in the toilet can be delivered in time, but the ladies’ slippers in the room are one-footed. I called the guest room and still didn’t give them to me. They gave me slippers to wear in the city.
The children's activities in the hotel were not well-prepared. In the end, it was said that the little lion that could be exchanged for the hotel's image ambassador was communicated many times before I borrowed it from the customer service for us to exchange.
6.1 During the Children's Day check-in period, there were no extra gifts for the children, so I was not happy. Or the mother bought it for the baby herself.

The housekeeper CC calls one day in advance, and arranges the parent-child room (the parent-child room is on the second floor, if you need to see the sea view, you can choose other room types) in advance, so the check-in process is relatively smooth! There are small interactions in some areas of the lobby, and the children are also very happy. It's just that the children's pool slide area has recently been under construction in some areas 🚧 The pull lines are not allowed to play. It's a little regrettable that the time is not right. The sea blue of Yalong Bay during the day is so beautiful, without a filter, it has the visual sense of Madai, but the sand is a little harsh. For dinner, I ordered coconut chicken hot pot in the hotel, it was delicious! Finally, let’s talk about the slide, everyone must rush, it’s fun and cool! In short, this time the parent-child fun is okay, and the food is okay. I am tired of bringing the baby alone, so I don’t go out and spend most of the time in the hotel. I am very happy.

msg:I brought the whole family to Yalong Bay and booked MGM. This hotel is owned by my colleague Amway. Several colleagues have been there. There are many parent-child facilities. There are different parent-child activities in each time period. The children’s favorite is bubble party and swimming in the pool , There are still many shaded areas in the swimming pool during the day. The children's toiletries in the room are complete, and all kinds of drinks are also provided. The service of the butler Xiaoshen Jelly is very good. He will ask for any help every day, and will follow up in time if there are any problems. Solution, a fruit plate was given on the day of check-in. The only complaint about the hotel is that there is no freezer. I bought 3 servings of ice cream and it turned into soup. But next time I come to Yalong Bay, I will consider booking here.

msg:A very satisfying vacation. Although there are many guests in the hotel, it still focuses on parent-child, but it treats every guest very seriously, and is equipped with a private butler. It is full of small details. There are clown parent-child interactions every day. Bring a beach, and there are many sand toys for children for free. The swimming pool is very clean. The lifeguards are very patient and enthusiastic. They guide people who can't swim. The hotel has a rich breakfast and there are three restaurants to choose from. The poolside buffet for dinner is also available. There were performances and singing, the a**osphere was full, and I also experienced the hotel's airport sea view zipline and banana boat. During the stay, because the gift items received were different from those given by the hotel, I would like to thank Ctrip customer service Mumu for solving problems. Actively fight for passengers and solve the problem satisfactorily without leaving any regrets.

Due to the needs of the flight itinerary, I asked the butler to communicate with him. The hotel butler was very responsible and gave free late check-out until 14:00, which greatly solved the needs of children for taking a nap. There are plenty of children's activities in the hotel, including children's swimming pool, children's playground, and various performances. Children like it very much, and they will not feel bored during their stay. Staying in the sea view suite has a beautiful view and a wide view. Next time I come back, I will choose MGM again!

The breakfast is very rich, and you can basically eat popular snacks, and it is also convenient to eat in the nearby Baihua Valley. The activities are also very rich, and the children have a lot of fun. Fuhuan's service is very good, and they upgraded our room for free. Stayed for two days, the experience was great👍 I lived in Atlantis on the third day. To be honest, if it wasn't for the water world and the aquarium, the interior of the other rooms was comparable to MGM. The mini bar is not as rich as MGM. There is one more children's step stool in the bathroom than in MGM. Hahahaha I hope MGM will copy the homework.

Although I was a little worried about the good reviews before I checked in, as far as I know, the experience from check-in to check-out is super good, and the children say they want to play here all the time. The children's facilities are relatively complete. The children like the paradise very much, and caught up with the May Day special activities. The children did a lot of handicrafts.
In terms of food, they have a buffet for breakfast. There are many types. I make Chongqing noodles by myself. I order takeaway at noon and night, which is super delicious.
In terms of service, I am very grateful to the butler, Fu Huan, for his considerate service throughout the whole process from check-in to check-out. Answers to questions in a timely manner.
Not to mention taking pictures, the hotel sells tickets very much, and those who like water sports can also sign up at the hotel. I feel that the price is quite cheap, but it is not suitable for me to bring my baby this time.
In short, MGM is still the first choice when you come to play next time...

Ms. Tina, the VIP manager, added WeChat early and introduced the hotel's facilities, catering and activities in detail, not only recommending the hotel's catering, but also recommending the Baihuagu restaurant. The room was as clean and tidy as ever, and the children's supplies were prepared before check-in. There are not many tourists on the hotel's own beach, and it is very clean. It may be because of the impact of the epidemic a few years ago, the restaurant and bar on the beach only serve drinks and no food. The activities for children are still very rich, there are different projects at different times of the day, and the facilities are also updated. The food at the poolside restaurant is still rich and delicious, but the M show doesn't have much new content. Hope to have a new experience next time. All in all, for hotels on the coast of Yalong Bay, MGM is recommended first 👍🏻

msg:During the May Day holiday, the parent-child room with garden view is booked. This is where I remind everyone to avoid pits. The day before the check-in, the housekeeper called and communicated about the check-in situation and preferences. He said that he wanted to leave a WeChat account and add a WeChat account so that we could get in touch. The phone hung up, and there was nothing else to do. I didn’t add WeChat when I left the store. Of course, this was not the case. important. Let’s talk about the room. The so-called parent-child room is actually a beggar’s room. If you put a small tent, a small rocking chair, and a few children’s books in the room, it is considered a parent-child room. That is to say, putting things like tents in any room can become a parent-child room. I made a reservation one month in advance, including telling the housekeeper that I wanted a higher floor, but I got a 2nd floor. Anyway, the parent-child tent can be moved to any room at will. You can put a tent in a room on a high floor and turn it into a parent-child room. . The room facilities are OK, but there are too few hangers. The drinks and food in the refrigerator are said to be free for the first round, but when cleaning the next day, the auntie in the room still replenished them.
The hotel is okay earlier, I don't pay much attention to it, and I can accept it. In order to guide staggered peak dining, two discounts are provided for guests who dine before 8:00, one is a 150 yuan consumption coupon (I didn’t give it to me, and I didn’t ask for it) and the other is 75 yuan per person for breakfast for children above 1.2 meters ( I use this).
The swimming pool is quite big, but the fly in the oin**ent is the lack of a swimming pool for children to play in. The swimming pool in the children's area is just a few fountains, lacking water slides, water buckets, and water guns. The massage jets in all the pools are not open.
The bubble party on the day of check-in was well organized with a lucky draw and free snacks. Of course, this is not the norm, only special holidays will be organized.
The concierge made an appoin**ent for a bus to the duty-free shop one day in advance. It departs at 9:20 and waits 10 minutes in advance. This shuttle bus is not from the hotel, but from the duty-free shop. It stops at hotels near Yalong Bay and picks up customers one by one. The driver who got on the bus didn't say anything about the time and arrangement of the return journey, and felt that he would go straight there, regardless of the return. After shopping, I took a taxi back to the hotel by myself.
If the room is not cleaned well when you check in, the front desk will provide you with a self-service afternoon tea snack voucher to eat some snacks and fruits and drink drinks.

The hotel is very clean, the lobby is bright, and the staff can always be seen polishing and cleaning the floor around 11 o'clock in the evening; the details of the room are also in place.
      On the second day of my stay, I had already made up the bedding and supplemented the mineral water when I came back from the trip (it is said that there is a lot of mineral water prepared! There are seven or eight bottles of it🤭) and the Fanta Sprite Coke in the small refrigerator can be enjoyed at will.
       The amount of fruit in the room is too much! I can't finish eating at one time, and I feel the sincerity of the hotel👍
        The a**osphere of the hotel is very good. In the evening, there are singers singing, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the singing, eating seafood, drinking wine... It's very pleasant ☺️ The area for children to play has increased, and the activities are rich and colorful, full of energy!
⛹️The gym is very convenient to use, with complete equipment, mineral water and ice towels, very considerate!
Service: The most worth mentioning is the butler service. This time and last time, the butler "Yuhang" has been communicating on WeChat. The problem is solved in a timely manner, the suggestion is very pertinent, and the experience is very good👍 I will definitely come to the United States again next time High plum 😊

The whole hotel is small and full of people, noisy. The air conditioner is not cool, and there are no outdoor entertainment facilities except for a few shallow swimming pools.

MGM really gave me a good travel experience. From the moment I entered the hotel, there were waiters who helped open the door, took luggage, and checked in. The check-in process is also very fast, and the precautions and activities and consultation methods are all introduced. It is really the best place to bring children, constant temperature swimming pool, invincible beach! The hotel is really big, very playable, and took a lot of photos for the children. A journey worth remembering. A little opinion, the sound insulation of the hotel is a little bit poor, but it is understandable. After all, in a parent-child hotel, children are full of vitality, so it is inevitable that they will be a little bit noisy, but it is actually acceptable.

In particular, the housekeeper Mengmeng was very considerate and promptly helped us deliver our luggage and send guests to our door. I took the trouble to apply for a pass so that the car could be driven directly to the entrance of the villa. It was a very pleasant and enjoyable journey!

msg:My friend changed the plan temporarily and took my mother to travel. So I chose Yalong Bay, which I have never been to before, and wanted to enjoy the clean water and fine sand.
Because the hotel's ranking is relatively high, I chose MGM and booked for three nights.

Service: It feels very humanized, and the overall customer experience is very good. Tina, the hotel housekeeper, came to contact me one day in advance, and helped arrange room upgrades, asked about the itinerary, and sent a hotel map. If you have any questions during your stay, you can ask Tina for help at any time. Every day, you will ask when the next day is suitable for cleaning. Because the new room type does not have a balcony light, the housekeeper immediately arranged for a floor lamp, which is very considerate.
When checking in, the luggage in advance was taken over by the concierge, and it was sent to the room after the registration number, which was quite convenient.
The room cleaning is really a big praise. It is very clean every day. It may be that we don’t drink much water, but we still add water for us every day. On the last day, it was quite spectacular and placed in a pyramid shape, which shocked me. Quickly brought two bottles to drink on the road, 😄. On the last day, I also made a cute bunny for me. It was so cute that I almost wanted to take it home.
Every service staff has a very good attitude. I didn't bring my takeaway mobile phone, so I asked a young lady in the lobby to help me. She was very enthusiastic and helped me scan the QR code with a smile. It felt very good.
However, there are quite a lot of people at this time, so it took a while to check in.

Environment: backed by mountains, facing the sea. There is Dongrong Food Street within walking distance for eating nearby, and Baihua Valley is 5 minutes away by car, Yalong Bay is there for diving, and it takes about 15 minutes to take a taxi to Baifu Island for snorkeling. It is more convenient than expected. However, some one-day tours do not pick up parts of Yalong Bay, so everyone should take a look at them in advance.

Facilities: There are many guests, but the rooms are quiet. There are many swimming pools, and there are also heated swimming pools. The hotel has its own beach and lounge chairs. Because the weather is cold, there are towels and ginger tea. In the room, there are children's bathrobes and slippers (both plastic and disposable), umbrellas, and a straw basket bag that is convenient for carrying to the beach for residents. Although the bathroom equipment is relatively old because the hotel has been around for a long time, it is still very useful and clean. There is a special take-out cabinet for ordering take-out, so you don't have to go out to find food. There are also performances at the seaside bar at night, so you can listen to them without spending money. There are many places suitable for taking pictures in the hotel, just discover them.

Others: This time I booked a hotel with a free face cream, Bojue travel photography, but unfortunately there are no children, otherwise I can experience more, if I have the opportunity to come to Yalong Bay next time, I will still choose this place.

It is not a one-stop service to receive room cards for such a large hotel. The front desk asked me to ask the bus station next to me, but the bus station said he couldn't see the status and asked me to ask the front desk. Is this the hospitality of a five-star hotel? During my stay for a few days, I called the front desk before sending someone to clean it. I put up the cleaning sign, but when I came back after I left, it was still in an untidy state. The hotel network is poor. There is only one network for the entire hotel. Although the coverage is excellent, it is often disconnected or cannot be connected. The TV equipment is still the same as the previous cable TV, and it is impossible to watch TV online. The food was okay. The breakfast was very rich and felt like lunch. Breakfast lasted until 11 o'clock, so you could have an early lunch. The service attitude in the restaurant was very good, and they even asked if they had any comments after finishing the meal.

In 2023, when the baby is three years old, he will pay more attention to parent-child activities and hotel convenience. I am not worried about the convenience at all. I have always had confidence in MGM for so many years. The luxury sea view suite I booked this time is great for three people! Although the check-in time is after three o'clock, but the restaurant is given a rest, you can have a simple meal and so on. The room attendant Lindy and Mr. Huang who check in after 3 o'clock are very polite and responsive... What I didn't expect was that all the room staff I met on the 9th floor would meet and say hello! Very kind... I also gave the child a cake and a little lion for his birthday. I was really touched. This trip is not only unforgettable for the child, but also for me. There are endless parent-child activities to participate in every day. Go to the front desk to sign the agreement and you can participate on time. The children like it so much that they are reluctant to sleep...We haven't left the hotel for five days...all are satisfied. By the way, takeaway is also super convenient! There is a takeaway cabinet downstairs! The hotel is not perfect, but it doesn't affect me and I will continue to choose it. I like MGM, the staff and services of MGM. Again, the location is great!

The hotel butler link Xiaowei communicated with me about my room preference in advance via WeChat. Although I had made a note when I placed the order, the butler reconfirmed with me and met my needs. The room is in a relatively quiet location, on the 9th floor of the hotel (up to 9 floor) to arrange a location with a relatively good sea view. I was also upgraded to a room with a better sea view the next day, but it was not changed due to personal reasons. Although the room was not changed, the housekeeper Xiaowei also gave me a fruit plate and a go-kart experience.
The hotel's breakfast is until 11 o'clock, which is very friendly to people like our family who sleep until they wake up naturally. No pressure to get up early for breakfast 😊
There are several children's swimming pools in the hotel with constant temperature. We went there in the last week of February, and we can go into the water even if the weather is slightly cool.
The hotel also has a lot of play activities for children (parents are required to accompany them all the way), and there is also a children's playground (on the first floor of Building 1). Parents can take care of them all day if they don't want to be accompanied, but this time I didn't experience it, the only regret.
The hotel's private beach is also great, the sea is green and clean, and the beach is also clean. Many parents take their babies to play with the sand on the beach. There are free sand digging tools, which are very friendly.
Not much to say, no picture, no truth, above picture~

msg:Before coming to Sanya Bay, I did a lot of research online. I compared the hotel reviews with the environment and facilities. Because I was traveling with my children, I finally chose MGM and Tianyu. I originally planned to book a 4-day package ticket directly at Tianyu, but I couldn’t make an appointment. , I temporarily booked two nights at MGM and two nights at Tianyu. I checked into the MGM hotel first and had a great experience. After two nights, I went to Tianyu. People started to feel irritated when I entered. The room I booked at the same price was more expensive than the MGM one. What about the package? It’s 90 It's a big hotel in the era, with yellow wood everywhere, old decoration, and the children's play equipment is also very shabby. The floor is covered with dirty foam mats. It's rubbish. I regretted it at the time. I stayed in the MGM for many consecutive years. Well, it costs nearly 2,000 yuan a night to come to Tianyu. In this environment, the lobby manager’s service is also very poor! I don’t know what those people who went to Tianyu were thinking. I just said that I was deceived by a **********. At night, the tables at the seaside restaurant are just like dining in the countryside, and they even put plastic bags on them... I really can’t live here and think of a way. I turned it down and gave up a lot of effort, and then returned to the MGM Hotel. As a result, I couldn't book the parent-child garden room where I stayed before that day. I booked a golf room for three nights. I accidentally added Xiao Wei Link, Wei Yuhang butler, and service. It was great. I paid 300 per night at the front desk to upgrade to a garden parent-child room, but it was unsuccessful. I was told that there were no more available for that day. The housekeeper Xiao Wei helped me upgrade for free and quickly changed it to the garden parent-child room I originally stayed in. It was a real savings. I paid 900 yuan and got free fruit. Any request was quickly restored and helped. My child wanted to surf for 280 yuan an hour. I contacted Xiao Wei and gave me a free trial coupon, which saved me another 280 yuan. In the past three days, I In the evening, I took a walk to the gardens and swimming pool of the Sheraton Mangrove Garden next door. The quality is not comparable to that of the MGM. You will know if you see it for yourself. Next time you go to a hotel in Yalong Bay, just stay at the MGM. It has at least one star for the same price. , there are many free parent-child programs, the environment is very good, the beach sand is very white and fine, the water is very clear, I am definitely not a drag, I rarely write reviews, I have attached the WeChat ID of the butler Wei Yuhang. If you want to book a room, just add the contact to get a discount. The discount is cheaper than Ctrip. The hotel garden and the beach are beautiful when you take photos. The breakfast is also delicious~

msg:I only stayed at MGM Resorts for one day, but it left a perfect impression on me. The butler Emi is really considerate and considerate. He contacted me before arriving at the hotel and helped me reserve the same room on two floors in advance. I chose one of the two, and sent a lot of relevant information about the hotel after I arrived. Of course, the housekeepers of these other hotels are the same, but when the house is so tight on Sunday, they still help me apply for check-out until two o'clock, and send it to me when I leave. Give me a small gift, it's extremely warm! Let's talk about other things after the key points are finished.
Facilities: Although it is not a newly renovated hotel, the facilities are not aging, nor do they feel outdated.
Hygiene: There are many people on weekends, and there are many people who order takeaway, but the garbage can be cleaned up in time, so there is no need to talk about other daily routines.
Environment: The environment should be its most advantageous place. Not only is the green coverage rate high, but the landscape design is also very unique. There are also many props and scenes suitable for punching in and taking pictures. Many of them come here to make blockbuster movies.
Service: The service is definitely great, the butlers are so caring, the staff in other places are the same, busy but not chaotic, well-organized, and they all greet each other with a smile, and there are small performances to welcome guests. By the way, the swimming pool also prepares brown sugar ginger tea for swimmers, isn't it very considerate!

Breakfast: very rich, rich, I actually had a lunch for breakfast, and then it seems that I haven't eaten the whole thing
Rhythmic Joyful Experience: Unfortunately, due to my own time, I was unable to participate, and I will definitely participate next time
Summary: Very good hotel, suitable for people who travel alone, and will not feel bored, because the activities arranged by the hotel are not only suitable for parents and children, but also a person can live a fulfilling life! I will come to MGM again!

The hotel facilities are very complete, including beach bags, beach slippers, cloth slippers, bathrobes of different sizes, and supplies are also good. There are also fruits and free drinks in the refrigerator every day. The hotel also has a lot of recreational facilities, karts, water sports, surfing, and various swimming pools. Even when the room is full, we can try our best to maintain an excellent service state. There is a butler, Sean, who can consult at any time, and Robin, who is so handsome The little brother with a high attitude and a very warm heart, solves my various problems... the first choice for one drag two!

I spent half a day in the children’s playground. There are also a variety of breakfasts, especially the butler. Fuhuan has a hearty personality and is easy to communicate with. The sea view room I booked said I wanted some parent-child elements, and added tents and toys. My daughter is very satisfied hahahaha. I feel that Yalong Bay is more suitable for living with children than Haitang Bay.

MGM is more fashionable and foreign, with relatively new facilities, and there will be a Nami Rabbit exhibition on the same day. The rooms are also bright and spacious. We live in a parent-child room in the balcony garden, where we can see the sea. Children's shower gel, shampoo, laundry detergent and mosquito repellent are provided, and the bed can also be fenced. The fine sand and fine waves on the beach are also relatively small, the water temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is very good, and there are bubble parties every day. No appoin**ent or registration is required. The surfing experience is suitable for adults. The breakfast is average, the chicken feet in black bean sauce is good, and you can also have breakfast outdoors. The child digs sand, surfs and swims every day. Although he gets tanned a lot, he is very happy.

There was no turn-down service on the second day, or they came to clean up after calling. What’s even more funny is that every other day God, the garbage is still in front of the room. In addition, many items also require additional payment, even going to the children's area the next day has to pay additionally. Overall, the perception is not good, it is better to go to Atlantis.

msg:This year, I came to the famous MGM Resort Hotel in Hainan again during the Chinese New Year. After the first liberalization after the epidemic, whether in terms of facilities, sanitation and environmental services, the company is still first-class. Neither comparable nor comparable hotels of the same type. MGM always insists on doing the best, and there are new surprises and new projects every year. The elderly and children are very happy to play. I wish the hotel presented a thoughtful little lion doll on the first day, and the children were very happy. The housekeeper, Jerry, is patient and thoughtful, responsive to every request, considerate in service, courteous in hospitality, and high in quality, which fully reflects the management and training of MGM's senior staff. Walking in the hotel park, no matter what kind of problems you encounter, as long as you ask the MGM employees in uniform, "the problem ends with me" to make the guests feel at home. Although the weather is getting colder, the hotel's outdoor heated swimming pools also allow children to find their fun, and there are professionals taking care of each swimming pool. The water temperature will be warmer at noon. The outdoor poolside barbecue is a gluttonous feast. It is not only clean and hygienic, but also has performances by entertainers. At the same time, there are new projects such as lantern viewing, zipline jungle adventure and so on this year. It is the best choice for parents and children to play weekend vacation. Fresh fruit can be delivered to the room every day, with a variety of categories and fresh quality. In the lobby of MGM, whether you meet the general manager or employees, they will guide you warmly and thoughtfully. Children's favorite is the dessert in the chocolate house on the first floor. The desserts in the chocolate house are very good. There are rose lollipops and round chocolates. And coconut lollipops. This year's holiday is really unyielding, and I hope that next year's MGM will give us more surprises.

The sea in Yalong Bay is blue and calm, which is very suitable for taking children to play, and the photos are super beautiful. Sanya Bay is too rough, Haitang Bay has big waves, and Haitang Bay has better dining and entertainment facilities than Long Bay. Although the hotel is a few years old, the experience of staying at MGM was really good, clean and comfortable. The butler Sean added WeChat when he checked in. I also helped the children print materials and connect to the Internet, thank you very much (*^_^*) There is no extra consumption, the beach toys in the hotel are also free, there are several heated swimming pools, there is also a water park, and there are meal coupons for group purchases, Several restaurants in the hotel are delicious, super cost-effective, highly recommend MGM, the best hotel in Yalong Bay, the best choice for children

The online reviews say that the check-in process is very slow, and I have a deep understanding. I waited for several hours for the two rooms before checking in. Fortunately, the front desk thoughtfully arranged for us to go to the dressing room to change out the heavy cotton clothes, and took us to the waiting area for afternoon tea.
For breakfast, you can go to Begonia, Pinju and the restaurant next to the swimming pool. The variety is rich and delicious.
For lunch, we chose Pinju Restaurant. In the evening, there is a poolside buffet with performances.
It is worthy of recognition that Ms. Lu Miko, the manager of the lobby, has properly handled the unsatisfactory feelings and problems in the hotel. She was very moved without complaints at night.
At the end of leaving the hotel, the butler gave me a small gift, a perfect vacation.

He is also very responsible and conscientious, and the activities are properly arranged! Great attitude! There are performances at the dinner buffet, and the performances can also be watched near the swimming pool, but the buffet variety is relatively small and relatively average. It is recommended to walk out to eat. There is Baihuagu Commercial Street and Haidilao within a 10-minute walk! But the night show was really good. The staff near the pool are very responsible!

msg:As I expected, the parent-child hotel is also the MGM of the pet-friendly hotel. The holidays are naturally extremely busy, and there are luggage carts piled up at the door. I asked the luggage clerk from the luggage cart to help unload the luggage~~
Fortunately, the receptionist at the front desk is warm and happy to arrange a room with a good view, but they have to wait for cleaning, and then they say they will give us a free afternoon tea. It is really embarrassing for us to go to get afternoon tea when we are happy. It should not be called afternoon tea. Top Too much is food to satisfy one's hunger, so why not have a little more? I really don’t think there is anything to eat, a few pieces of cake, a few oranges, a few yolk buns, and water ~ drop in price ~
By the way, the buffet dinner by the pool is also average, but you have to wait in line to get the ingredients that are passable. After the person in front of you has taken ten steaks or ten skewers of squid, you may continue to wait for him to grill. Since it is the main BBQ, it should be more It would be better if there are more people and more grills~ Another example is dross seafood, no crabs, only shrimps and snails, and the shrimps that have not been queued are gone; the child wants to eat chicken wings, but he has not been queued several times , In the end, it can only be considered full, not good. The performance is quite special, the singer is the only one that attracts me, other programs can be considered lively, but the elderly and children should like it.
When I checked in, no one reminded me that some items needed to be reserved. What items did I book for the room type package? As a result, we didn’t make an appoin**ent for the surfing experience we wanted to play the most. We had to wait for a vacancy on the spot. We waited for 1 hour and 15 minutes~~

Just when I was depressed, the butler Sean contacted me and solved the problem quickly and efficiently, and recorded all the feedback in the book. To be honest, my five-star service is for the butler service. Although I did not enjoy the butler service when I entered the store, but Sean's professionalism is also enough to make our experience perfect on the day we leave the store: admit shortcomings, face them positively, never complain, respond to requests, and take the initiative to provide more services... This is the quality of talents that a five-star hotel should be equipped with, thank you very much.
Of course, MGM still has its good side: as far as the row of old hotels in Yalong Bay is concerned, it is clean, tidy and not old; the hotel is not particularly large, and the rooms are near the beach and the lobby, so it is not far away no matter where you go; it is especially suitable Parent-child, there are many activities for children to play, and they are not boring throughout the day; especially the temperature of the heated swimming pool is slightly higher than other hotels, so very young children are not afraid of the cold; the location is also very close to Baihuagu Commercial Street, so it is easy to go out for food It's very convenient; there are quite a lot of internet celebrities, and it's very suitable for those who like to take pictures and check in. These layouts can be harmoniously integrated with the hotel facilities.

Fun surfing experience for two: Be sure to make an appoin**ent in advance, otherwise you have to wait for other people's space to arrange it for you, it is difficult to wait.

Also, you must be optimistic about booking a room. If you want to change a room at the hotel, you can only upgrade and add money! If you want to downgrade and change the room, don't even think about the hotel's refund! I am a Ctrip platinum customer. I downgraded the room and asked for a refund of the price difference. The hotel and Ctrip are pushing each other. I have used it for more than ten years and spend a lot of money every year. Ctrip customers are very disappointed! !

It’s really worry-free 👍It’s very convenient to get to the beach. When the weather is fine, it’s too much. 👍Just staying in Yalong Bay for one night is really not enough, there are still many things I haven’t experienced~ Next time I will come to Yalong Bay and stay at MGM again ✌️

After checking in, I found that there was no hair dryer. The waiter for the fence for the children delivered it immediately, especially Brother Xiaoguan at the concierge was so kind, reminding us that there is a The free car to Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest, and many small problems were also solved for us. The downside is that the table on the balcony is not good-looking. A five-star hotel is not bad for the money. I hope the details of the hotel will get better and better.

The atmosphere of the hotel is very good, there are many recreational facilities for children, and the beach is very beautiful. The fly in the ointment is that the swimming pools are small and irregular, not suitable for adults. In addition, the process of welcoming guests is relatively simple, and it seems not so enthusiastic. It is estimated that the peak season of the Spring Festival cannot be taken care of.

On the first day of check-in, there was a super considerate butler reception, guiding various children's play items and activities in the hotel, which made our stay in the pure hotel very fulfilling. The housekeeper is considerate and can help children print papers, haha 😄
It’s the peak occupancy period recently. I thought there would be a long queue for breakfast after 9 o’clock, but the hotel has several restaurants for breakfast, each with its own characteristics. The diversion during peak hours is done very well!
The hotel provides hot towels and brown sugar ginger tea by the pool, so parents don't have to worry about their children catching cold after swimming. Very attentive service.
The service in the room is timely, and the needs can be met within 10 minutes.
It's still very good, the kids said they will stay here again next time hahahaha 😄

After learning that you will arrive early, pay attention to the room status in advance. The room is ready at noon. In this peak season, it is not easy to do this. When you arrive at the store, you will show up in the lobby on time and wait for me to help you check in. And escorted to the room, arranged a quiet room with a large balcony, very considerate! Responsiveness during check-in, all arrangements are made as far as possible, and at the end of the check-out, they will be thoughtfully delivered, and small gifts are given, both for children and adults. The cute little lion children are now hugging each other, which is a symbol of MGM. Experience it here The incomparable warmth, thank you, these things must be mentioned, I brought it up on my own initiative, he is the most careful, sunny and dedicated housekeeper since the hotel I stayed in recently, here I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart! Then let’s talk about entertainment. The hotel has a beach, and the lights are turned on at night. There is a landscape seat next to it. Children dig sand here, and adults eat dinner with the sea breeze. It’s so cozy. On the other side is a lawn where you can listen to live band Playing and singing, enjoying the leisure time, and there are many photo spots to check in, and the shots are very big! There are 3 constant temperature pools in the swimming pool, all of which are extremely friendly to children. Two of them have a water depth of 1.2m, and one has a mushroom pool and a slide. Children have fun playing in the pool, and the constant temperature pool is a must when the weather is cold! It is open until 10 o'clock in the evening. It is very relaxed not to eat dumplings, and it is not cold to swim at night. The surfing experience is also very interesting. In addition, going out to sea to ride a motorboat and sit on a double sofa on the sea is super exciting. Going at noon, it will not be cold or wet. Yalong Bay is good for this. I must experience it. My only day in Yalong Bay was given to MGM. In addition, children's entertainment activities are also fully arranged, and they only stayed for one day but they were very fulfilling. It was very interesting to play real flying chess! I like it very much, full of memories!

The characteristic of MGM GRAND is that it occupies an excellent location, with the golf course in front and the beach coast of Yalong Bay in the back. The garden design in the backyard of the hotel is classic. It is simply a small scenic spot with multiple large swimming pools and two heated swimming pools. , the elderly and children can swim in winter is simply too convenient.

The seafood on the pedestrian street is super delicious~
If you are not used to eating, you can still eat KFC Haidilao... 🥺

❗️❗️ Recommended hotel breakfast

To be honest~ MGM's breakfast is the best hotel breakfast I have eaten in Sanya these days
Especially the noodle, Auntie will add several shrimps and sixty-year-old armor when cooked
Hee hee must try...

1. Elina Fu Huan, the account manager of MGM, is very responsible. From check-in to schedule, she introduces details and patience. Praise!

2. MGM has a better overall sense of class than other five-star hotels. It is not recommended to live in a one-bedroom suite. The extra small bed is a bit confusing. The next day, I added money and upgraded to a two-room suite, which was much more comfortable.

3. At the end of December, the daytime temperature is 25 degrees, and the outdoor swimming pool and the sea are very cold. It takes courage to enter the water. The children's heated swimming pool provided by the suite is very good. You can swim in the day and night. It is recommended for children to play in the water.

4. There are two restaurants for breakfast, which can be exchanged, which is not bad. In the evening, the outdoor self-service barbecue is a bit special, and there are also performances.

Sunshine, sand, and a happy itinerary. The epidemic has been suffocating for several years, so it is worth the price.

The Yalong Bay area is the most selective bay for family trips. There are many hotels with good beaches and clean waters. The Yalong Bay Hotel was established early, and the facilities will have a sense of age. However, from the facilities to the experience of the MGM Hotel, it really makes me want to stay indefinitely hotel~
The first pet-friendly hotel in Sanya
Yalong Bay's most "playable" and trendy fashion brand
Sanya hot mom trendy dad walking baby travel check-in place
These are my understanding of the MGM hotel
The hotel is located in Yalong Bay, the "No. 1 Bay in the World". Beautiful landscaping design means that the phone memory is completely insufficient
It’s all here, how can I be worthy of the high-priced air tickets and rooms if I don’t take more photos~
The hotel has specially set up a photo check-in point, exquisite tents, cool locomotives, seaside hammocks, Nami rabbits, Corona buses, everywhere you go are surprises
And if you want to eat well, be full and delicious, his restaurant can really satisfy you. At noon, we went to Pinju Restaurant to eat the salt-baked chicken set meal. 2-3 people can’t finish it. The dinner selection is very good. Cozy Niwan Restaurant, with good service and delicious taste ~ In short, a hotel I like very much. As soon as the epidemic situation is unblocked, I will rush to their house. It is really lively, and I will bring friends to this hotel next time ~

Check-in was pretty quick, but I already heard complaints from the ordinary rooms next to me. I had to clean it up on the first day. The guest room was just carelessly cleaned. There was no difference except that the garbage was taken out. On the second day, no one cleaned the room after being reminded three times. In the evening, I went directly to the front desk to complain and was told that no one was cleaning the room at the moment. They all went home and had a fever, but I couldn't understand. , when the staff service cannot keep up, why should all the rooms be filled with guests? It seems that there are no vacancies at present. I went to the front desk to complain on the third day and was told that I could only make up some things but there was still no one to clean. There was insufficient staff to provide service. If you can't keep up, just don't receive so many people. I can't understand that a long-established hotel is ruining its brand so much. People who never give negative reviews can't help but want to complain, or you can tell them in advance. There is no warning, so I recommend it in the future. Choose carefully

msg:1. Service: No housekeeper added me, but the housekeeper was added after I checked in. The fun surfing provided in the package is gone without prior notice. After checking in, I learned that I can only choose to replace it among the two items stipulated by it. The amount is less than fun surfing. I don’t want to play the main replacement item, so I just Can be wasted. There is a saying that the service attitude of the grassroots staff outside is quite good. Other services are average.
2. Hygiene: On the first floor, children playing with trains and changing clothes, and the amu*****t park smells musty, and the sanitation is not in place.
3. Facilities: Many projects are found in local shopping malls or on the street. There is no special feature, and the price/performance ratio is very low. Especially in June and July, you can only stay in the hotel, and there is no shade for playing outside. Neither of the two kids wanted to go out, as they didn't think it was fun, but they really liked the B&B in Tianya Town where they stayed on the last day, and they had a great time.

There are professionals who put make-up on the children, watch performances, distribute gifts, make Chris**as trees, hand-dye clothes, make Santa Claus, paint tents, make small dinosaurs, and have professional activities in the swimming pool. Coach, Coach Zhou taught the children freestyle in a short period of time. Thank you very much, Coach Zhou. I will learn from you next time I come here. The hotel has a hot pool, so you can swim even if the temperature has cooled down. The children stayed in the pool for 4 days. , 5 hours at a time. Stay in this hotel once and for all. You don’t have to spend money on other children’s activities, and you don’t have time to play at the beach. Recommended for parents who don’t know how to make arrangements when taking their children out to save worry and money. There is no cost to play, only accommodation fee, and you can order takeout for meals.

This is the second time to stay at MGM, and the experience is even better:) We were received by the butler Link on the day we arrived at the hotel. The arrangement was orderly and seamless, and he helped us upgrade the room so that we could see the sea while lying on the bed.

The hotel's service is great, and every time there is a need, whether it is Link or other staff, they can help solve it efficiently.

MGM should have the most entertainment activities among the hotels in Yalong Bay. It is not the same from morning to night. My favorite is the band singing from 8:00 to 12:00 every night, which can be heard in the room, blowing the sea breeze and listening to songs , very comfortable.

Looking forward to seeing you next year!

Among all the resort hotels, MGM not only retains the consistent style of the resort hotel, but also upgrades it according to the preferences of young people. The sea view room is beautiful and elegant, and there is no noise at all. The service of MGM is really warm and good. When we checked in, the butler Jerry warmly received us. When we were waiting for the room, I had a meal somewhere else at noon and was very uncomfortable with vomiting and diarrhea. Jerry came to find me as soon as possible and helped me store my luggage and took us to have afternoon tea and rest. I was very touched.
The hotel has a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. The only bad thing is that the shuttle bus is very rare. There are only three trips on the way there and two trips on the way back. I missed the appointment time on the day, but Jerry still answered me immediately and successfully booked the shuttle bus for the next morning.
The hotel may not be completely satisfactory, but the butler Jerry's service is really good. When I left the next day, I warmly sent him off and gave him a small gift. If I bring children in the future, I will choose MGM.

Facilities: The hotel has a complete range of entertainment projects, which is very suitable for parent-child travel. The swimming pool is heated and looks very beautiful.
Hygiene: There is no problem with hygiene, but there was a puddle of water on the floor when I changed rooms on the second night. It was very slippery and I fell directly. You may need to pay attention to the problem of slippery floors. I took a shower outside the bathroom and it was very slippery.
MGM has a very good business, so it will be very slow to wait for the cleaning to be completed. If you come to check in around 15:00, you will basically have to wait until around 17:00. If you need to check in at MGM during the peak season, it is recommended not to check in at 15:00. You can go out and play before coming back, or go to the hotel to complete the formalities and store your luggage and go out to play. It may be better to check in during the off-peak hours.

Introduce various activities in the hotel, and if you encounter any problems, you can reply in time on WeChat. At the same time, I recommended several seafood restaurants with very good taste in the surrounding area, and the price is also very affordable, more than 200 yuan for a table of seafood.

The beach and swimming pool of the hotel are excellent, and there are resident singers on the lawn at night, blowing the sea breeze, very pleasant!

msg:Staying at MGM for four consecutive years, the experience is as good as ever. My baby likes the Supreme Sea View Room very much. I booked this room type this time. The hardware and software of the hotel are very good. Whether it is the reception in the lobby or the boys by the pool, they are very enthusiastic. Especially the housekeeper Jane and the concierge depar**ent gave the children a little lion and a fruit plate. The children liked it very much. The cleaning ladies and aunts also worked hard. Very satisfied with the staying experience, I will continue to choose MGM next time I come to Sanya.

msg:Every time I come to Sanya, I always stay at MGM. The hotel's circulation planning is very reasonable. No matter where you want to go, you will not be too tired to start from the room. The landscape planning is also very elegant, and there are scenery along the way...
It has always been a pleasant choice for us
This time, I came here again with my husband and children.
As soon as I landed, I received a call from the butler link. In recent years, major hotels and homestays in China have launched butler services, and MGM has also launched this service with the times.
Speaking of which, I really want to complain about the bureaucracy in the back office of MGM Sanya
I originally planned to book a three-day parent-child package and a three-day poolside package. Later, I thought that the poolside was a bit small with two children. I wanted to cancel the order ten minutes after placing the order and re-order the three-day parent-child package, but the hotel disagreed and said yes. I really hope that I will continue to stay, let me set the parent-child package first, and then agree to give me a refund! Just such a trivial matter, Ctrip helped me communicate for three days, and the butler link helped me communicate for a day before agreeing to give me a refund. Then, the most disgusting thing happened to me! After I refunded the order, I went to the parent-child package and found that they adjusted the price in seconds, increasing by 600 yuan! Simply speechless!
Including ordering food, if you place the wrong order, and the difference is 100 yuan, the hotel will keep calling you, and the room will be called after the phone is called, so that you can quickly make up the money!
When the back office is doing something, have you ever thought about how much pressure your brothers and sisters in the front office will be under? I really want to find the theory and theory of the people who do these things directly. I apologize, I have been actively helping us coordinate various things, help us get express delivery, hope we will not affect the mood of the journey because of these things...
Originally, we were ready to live in MGM again, because of the housekeeper link, we decided to book another day before returning.
The front desk depar**ent of the service industry is more important than everything else. Now the competition in the hotel industry is so fierce, I hope that MGM, which has added a butler service, can truly hear the voice of customers, and it will get better and better.

msg:The hotel was a little angry at first for not keeping a room. Later, the housekeeper moona helped us coordinate it. Because we had to clean up, he also sent afternoon tea in the lobby bar. The room is very big and comfortable. I also used the swimming pool pulp to punch in, but it feels like it was cleaned in a hurry and not particularly clean.
In addition, I experienced the poolside buffet to watch the m show, and the restaurant manager on duty on November 10 was also very good. On the second day, watch the sunrise on the private beach and experience the Earl's Travel Shoot. The hotel has a lot of activities and can stay for two days. The housekeeper, moona, cared about us all the way, and even gave me a souvenir before leaving. The breakfast is very rich, and there are few choices for buffet and Pinyue

The service is very good. I will confirm the information with you one day in advance and help me to upgrade my room. The housekeeper Link is very considerate. I will reply as soon as I need anything. It is very nice and even gave me a little lion🦁️
The room is very big, and you can look at the sea view. Building 2 can also see the sunrise. It's not too great. The bed is also very comfortable.
The beach is very clean, not to mention the sea, perfect
There are many entertainment items in the hotel. I learned fun surfing. There is a singing performance in the center of the swimming pool under the background of the sunset, which is very romantic.
Breakfast is also very rich and tastes good
I was lucky enough to meet the sunset, so happy
Overall, the experience was very good, and I was successfully moved. I will come again next time

Both the Fun surfing double experience and the Bojue travel project are very satisfied~ Although the surfing experience is 10 minutes, the coach is very professional, and I can stand up the second time✌️And there is director Jane Huang to help with reception and follow-up throughout the check-in. Great attitude! The little girl who helped check-in, the concierge and the security guard at the door also had a good attitude, and took the initiative to help open the door and take luggage. I especially like the environment of the hotel. It has an environment similar to that of a foreign resort hotel. The design of the special public space is my favorite style. I will come again next time. Moreover, I am also very satisfied with this travel shoot. I am so lucky that the customer service of the travel shoot helped to make an appoin**ent with the director of the tour shop, 100 points!

Environment: The scene is rich and the swimming pool is very clean
Service: The most important thing is the service, which is super super, especially the housekeeper sister Ada, who contacted us early on the day of check-in to ask about our needs, and learned that we were on a honeymoon trip, and immediately coordinated with the room colleagues to arrange the room for us, and gave us a welcome gift Fruit, and specially upgraded our honeymoon breakfast for us. While tasting exquisite food, we can enjoy the endless sea view. The unique service and scenery on the second floor of Niwan Restaurant are very pleasant. Under the caring service of Miss Ada, the two-day hotel experience was full of surprises and romance. When we finally left the store, Miss Ada also prepared a small surprise gift for us, which was very happy. Special thanks to our housekeeper, Ada, for giving us a perfect stay experience, very warm and looking forward to seeing you again next time~
Breakfast: Niwan honeymoon breakfast, the most beautiful breakfast in this trip, like it!

The most unexpected thing was that when we returned to the room after dinner, there was still a big cake in the refrigerator! It was a birthday celebration for our little friend who was staying, and a small gift was given when we left the hotel. Makes people feel more intimate. All this is carefully arranged by the hotel butler Jane. As soon as we entered the hotel lobby, the butler Jane has been waiting for a long time, and introduced the arrangement along the way.
MGM deserves to be ranked C in Yalong Bay, with blue waves, soft and delicate nearly white sandy beaches, and colorful swimming pools in resort hotels. The meals are all in the hotel, the lobster and seafood feast is about to fall, and it is Halloween 🎃, the hotel also has many activities. Most of the activities sent by the hotel have not had time to participate, which gave me a reason to go again next time, haha.

Facilities: The room area is spacious and the layout is super reasonable with a balcony with sea view. The bathroom and bath tub are all independent, and the two sinks are also very suitable for couples. The hotel's bathrobes and disposable slippers are specially prepared for children. There are plenty of TV shows with live streaming and free movies on demand. There is a regular shuttle bus to and from the duty-free shop every day, door-to-door pickup. There are a lot of outdoor games, and several outdoor swimming pools have a constant temperature and suitable water temperature. The artificial surfing pool is a super exciting experience.
Service: The hotel's service is super good. They helped arrange the honeymoon room and sent chocolates and fruits. There is also a free nucleic acid test at a fixed time in the hotel. Every night, I will take the initiative to ask if I need to add towels, which is very considerate. Breakfast is served until 10:30. I personally like the hotel's prawn seafood noodles and seafood wontons in clear soup. It is very suitable for travelers who sleep in late. The drinks in the free minibar are filled every day, and the mineral water is Nongfu Spring.
Ctrip hotel package travel photography: The Earl travel photography in the hotel is very professional, and the retouching technology is also first-class.

msg:Okay, thank you very much, the stay experience this time is really good. I come to Sanya every year. In terms of stay experience and customer experience, in addition to 3 o'clock in the middle of the night, I can arrange someone to help me repair the luggage Conrad (unfortunately). changed cards). This MGM stay experience can be said to be the best since Sanya vacation in recent years. Because of the epidemic, Haitang Bay was not chosen this year, which now seems to be the most sensible choice. Thanks to Jane and Ada for the arrangement, the two children had a very happy birthday, thanks to the service of the hotel staff. Although it may be just your SOP process, but you can feel the intention. In addition, I would like to thank the eldest sister who cleans the room. She has a very good attitude every day. Although I don't know your names. Still want to express my gratitude

There is also butler service, special thanks to Jane and Ada, who answer questions and respond in a timely manner. There are also many activities in the hotel, such as fun surfing and pleasure party. Compared with the Sheraton and Marriott next to it, the service and room are one level higher, recommended.

msg:I must complain about MGM's bizarre cheating of customers!! I compared the prices of the rooms I booked. After comparing for a few days, MGM's price of deluxe sea view is more expensive than garden view, and garden view is more expensive than golf. I booked a garden view room with meals for 2099. Before checking in, I found on the website that the price of the hotel's garden view was reduced by 300. I called Ctrip to cancel the order and re-book. Ctrip agreed and told me to communicate with MGM to make an order first to ensure that I would stay, and then cancel the order. I immediately opened the website to book a room, and I was shocked to find that the price of the garden view room had increased. The outrageous thing was that it increased to a price far higher than one-third of the deluxe sea view room. I informed Ctrip's customer service of the situation. Ctrip's customer service had seen the price when communicating with me at that time, and was also confused by this bizarre price operation. Later, Ctrip gave a good solution. This is a later story. The second thing is that when I arrived at the hotel, I was arranged a golf room. I said that the garden view room I booked at that time was more expensive than the golf room and should be better than the golf room. The service staff told me that the garden view room was on the lower floor and the view of the golf course was better... For my holiday mood, I was too lazy to argue with them... I think customers are not **...

1. Breakfast is divided into two restaurants, one is Chinese and Western food, and there is a chocolate fountain that children like. One is Pinjuge, more local Hainanese restaurants, I personally prefer :)
2. A banquet hall was changed into a large indoor playground for children, freeing hands.
3. The pool room I booked is really good. You can swim when you wake up in the morning, and there are a lot of cool times in a day, so you are not afraid of the sun.
4. The minibar in the hotel is free, and there is enough soft drink mineral water
5. Daily activities for children are also very rich
6. There will be performances in the swimming pool at 7:15 in the evening, acrobatic dance music, very high
7. Yalong Bay is very suitable for taking your baby into the sea. The baby is only 4 years old. Many water sports cannot be played. You can only take a glass bottom boat to see the corals, which is not bad.
8. It is recommended to bring a baby to stay

msg:Very good hotel, the decoration is a little old, but the room is spacious and comfortable, the meals are rich, and the activities are rich. The beach is right next to the swimming pool, which is suitable for traveling with children and the whole family. When checking in, a housekeeper will be arranged to add WeChat, and if you encounter problems, you can respond and deal with them in time. Service is ok.
A few suggestions: 1. Children's club activities require parents to accompany them, even if it is a simple handicraft class, even if the child is 12 years old, children are not allowed to participate independently, which shows that the hotel does not dare to take responsibility. But dumping a baby has become a parent's dream. To participate in activities, children can only sacrifice the adult's time to accompany them all the way. How do the interest classes in the society do it? Early delivery and late pick up are more humane.
2. There is no one to guide the guest to the room after checking in, and there is no one to guide the fork in the road. This is the first time that I have encountered such a situation when I have stayed in a hotel in Sanya for many times. I often see lost customers lose their temper, and I also dragged a large bag and a small bag to ask around to find the maze-like elevator 🛗 How inconvenient for an older person. It may be the hotel's reason that guests can't manage to come.
There is no perfect hotel, only the right mood!

MGM has been regarded as an old brand in the high-end series of Sanya, and it is also constantly optimizing the room service management. Every time the room service staff sees children with children, they will show their magical charm to the children! This time, Xiao Ning and Zhou Hongyan from the service depar**ent tidy up the room for us. They will clean the room every day, and will fill in the drinks and items. My favorite is the daily magic session. Even adults can't bear to destroy it when they see it👍👍My children don't want to leave, I look forward to coming to MGM next time~

Pay for pain. Check-in day is Wednesday, the supreme sea view twin room, price 2899, enjoy the following:

1. As soon as I entered the hotel, there was no one to guide me to check in. I went to the check-in area on the left side of the lobby. After queuing for ten minutes, I was told that the counter on the right side could also check in. During these ten minutes, there were only scattered guests on the right side. The front desk Most are standing, idle! Seeing that the queue on the left is so long, there is no word! The attitude when handling is also relatively poor, there is no hotel style.

2, the hygiene is super poor! Whether it is the room, restaurant, or park, the room is very smelly, the facilities are very old, there is a lot of dust, and the curtains are a black smell of mopping the floor! The balcony has no privacy at all, and you can climb over to each room casually. If you don't draw the curtains, you can see the room at a glance. The buffet breakfast has very few varieties. At 10 o'clock in the morning, there are only a few pieces of fruit left, let alone others. health. . Bad bad bad bad! ! No appetite to see! Totally sorry for the price! The food and table counters had rubbish that the waiters couldn't see. After communicating with the waiter, I cleaned up some, and stood again, when I couldn't see it, I was speechless.

3. There is a lot of garbage by the swimming pool in the park passage. Although it seems that there are a lot of things to play, walking by the pool is just smelling the smell of oil smoke. The swimming pool is too dirty to get down. Anyway, this is the worst and most unpleasant time to stay in the tour!

4. The small trains and other mini games in the park will be charged separately! I never thought that even the children's playground is very small. For three-year-old children, many entertainment facilities also have potential safety hazards.

msg:As a Ctrip Diamond member, I rarely comment, because I am lazy. I have to say MGM didn't let me down, from the beach to the room service (special thanks to the housekeepers Grace, Sean, Jane for always solving problems and listening to feedback during the stay). The location of the MGM beach is good. It is basically a C position. The sand is fine and will not prick your feet. There are also many swimming pools and a children's entertainment area, which is a good place for parents and children to relax. In terms of eating, I strongly recommend the lobster set and breakfast at Niwan Restaurant. They are all authentic Western food, suitable for Xijing and young couples. It is very comfortable to watch the sea and eat delicious food. The BBQ buffet in the poolside restaurant is suitable for those who like to liven up the barbeque while watching the show. The breakfast at Haitang Restaurant is more traditional, and it is better to have more choices. MGM is a hotel that I will stay in again when I come to Yalong Bay next time. However, it is recommended that you live in a sea view room, although it is more expensive, but the view is good and not noisy. Rooms near the pool in the central part of the hotel are expected to be noisy at night.

Shangri-La stayed for two days, Atlantis for 4 days, MGM for 2 days, and three Each hotel has its own advantages and disadvantages, but the biggest feeling this time is that everyone&#39;s services are constantly improving. Blessing, only the high-end is put on the price, but the service is completely ignored. Now it is affected by many aspects, and everyone gradually pays attention to the service, which reflects more humanization. This is the foundation of the hotel industry, and it is the retention of customers. Thanks to Link and Emma, especially Link&#39;s caring service, the original complaint about the hotel&#39;s time-stamped hardware finally became tolerant, looking forward to the next trip to Sanya, but in the end I couldn&#39;t help but complain about the shower handle in the bathroom. , I don’t know if it’s just like this in my room, or if it’s like this in all rooms. The water outlet knob on the top is cylindrical and has no leverage point. If there is foam in the hand, it can’t be twisted at all, and it’s still tight. It’s really anti-human. design

The sand on the beach is delicate, and there are many parent-child projects in the hotel, which are very popular with children. The entertainment items in the poolside restaurant at night are also pretty good. It is indeed a hotel owned by Macau&#39;s entertainment group. As a Ctrip customer, the room type is generally upgraded. Before arriving at the store, a customer service specialist will contact the customer service specialist on WeChat. If you have any questions during your stay, you can contact the customer service specialist on WeChat. Thank you Link for your patient reception, and the feedback issues are resolved in a timely manner. When leaving the store, Ada also specially prepared a small gift to send us away. The experience is simply not good. In particular, I would like to talk about the hotel&#39;s travel photography - Bojue travel photography. I have often seen the commercials of this travel film on TV before, but this time I have the mentality of giving it a try. I want to see how such a large-scale travel filming company is different from other travel filming companies. To be honest, I have been in Sanya too many times and have come into contact with a lot of travel photography. Only this time, I felt that travel photography can be extraordinary. Thank you photographer Wu Xianwen, the photos are very beautiful. We all feel that this is the feeling of taking a couple photo as a wedding photo. The post-production was also handled very well, unlike other hotel travel shoots, where simple color matching and highlighting were done. Earl really has a simple preliminary stage, and he has to deal with face shape and so on. Worth the price!

MGM's swimming pool can be said to be very good!

Because it was launched at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, the water in the pool was very warm, I thought it was a hot spring, and it was not cold at all.
Thank you very much to the front desk and the housekeeper Ada, who gave us a very good room with a view of the sea. When I left the hotel, I also gave a little lion toy, which is super cute~
I highly recommend MGM to play in Sanya. I can swim in the sea and find the feeling of my childhood~

🚗 Transportation: The hotel is located in the center of Yalong Bay, and all along the route are hotels. Taking a taxi to the nearby Baihuagu Commercial Street for food is just a starting price, and it takes less than 15 minutes to go to Yalong Bay Forest Park.

🍃Environment: There is nothing to say about the environment. Picture 1 is the view of the whole garden from the lobby. Picture 2 is through the swimming pool to reach the beach by the sea. Picture 3 is the view of the sea view room. Picture 5 and 6 are the night view of the hotel. Golf courses, kart halls, surfing experience areas, children's swimming pools, children's playgrounds, lobby bars, etc. are not photographed, and there are performances to watch. This hotel should be suitable for all ages.

🔔Service: Before check-in, customer service Jerry contacted and sent the hotel map and the opening schedule of various event venues in advance; when we checked in, Miss May warmly received us and upgraded our room; at first, because of the platform display and the hotel background It was shown that there was a discrepancy, so we couldn't have breakfast. Later, Emma and Grace handled it efficiently: when checking out, Miss Ada also prepared a souvenir, which I liked~☺️ (By the way, praise Ctrip's customer service! Post the picture below Brunch at Four Cafeterias!)

🧹Hygiene: The room attendant is very professional and cute, and asked me if I wanted to put a small animal on the bed with a towel 😜

By the way, I work in the media, so I didn't expect too much from the travel shoot in the package, but the finished product should not be too beautiful! The photographer Fang Daiqiang is very friendly, and he praises his skills 🤣 It makes people feel relaxed. The photos are very natural, just post an original picture, hard work!

To sum up, although it is the first time to stay at MGM, I will definitely choose it when I come to Sanya next time! Why is the late night tirade boastful, because every service staff was friendly and added a little warmth to our journey, they deserve it!

The swimming pool of the hotel is very large, and it is very pleasant to watch and play while swimming every night.
Although Sanya is very hot, I eat and drink in the hotel every day, but I think this is the meaning of vacation. In the fast-paced life, I steal a few days in this hotel. Just in a daze, just watching the sea, just watching the ebb and flow of the tide, the sunrise and sunset. This trip to Sanya is worthwhile.

The service is good, the butler's attitude is good, the service in the lobby is also good, very considerate, especially thanks to Ada and sean, after adding WeChat, the questions were answered in a timely manner, without any impatience, and a small gift was given when I left, I am really satisfied!

The hotel will give you a small cake for the birthday during the stay, which is very considerate, thank you. The hotel has set up some internet celebrity check-in points, which are quite impressive. The hotel is directly connected to the beach. At night, the beach has people on duty, which is very safe. In the evening, there are foreign club performances at the pool bar, and you can watch the show while eating barbecue. There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is not bad. It is a pleasant experience to stay, and I will consider staying if I have the opportunity.

It is a few minutes' walk to Yalong Bay with blue sand and white sand (the surrounding hotels and beaches are under maintenance). Although the facilities are a bit older, the service level is online. There are many activities suitable for children. Children have a good time every day. We have added the WeChat account of the customer relations depar**ent, and they can reply in time if you have any questions. The first night was very late. Grace quickly helped me solve the problems I encountered. Before leaving, Ada sent me a thoughtful gift. My parents were very satisfied with their stay, thank you very much.

As soon as I get off the bus, the bellman will open the door to pick up the luggage and check in. There will be a butler and a butler in the lobby. The lady at the front desk who helped introduce the hotel to check-in is very cute. She has short hair. She and the housekeeper introduced the room to me, and the questions I want to ask have not been opened. Both of them will tell me to answer and take me to the room. Thanks to Emma butler's service is very attentive! I am really happy to come to MGM Sanya. The hotel is completely pet-friendly. Seeing the puppies is really cute! It's very cute! There is a curly short-haired female manager in the lobby. The service is also very good. I was in a hurry to go to the toilet. She helped me to look at the luggage. The service felt like home. When I went back to the lobby and saw her next to my luggage, it was really heartwarming! There is also a service staff who should also be praised! I came back from outside with my friends late one day. There was a beautiful lady in the lobby. She should be the manager on duty. When I come to Sanya in the future, I will only choose MGM! !

The greenery of the hotel is also acceptable
The hotel also provides a lot of activities, suitable for parents and children, not suitable for people like me who want to seek a peaceful vacation haha
On the night of the 6th, there will be a performance similar to that in Las Vegas
It's good to lie by the pool and watch the show
The breakfast is a bit chaotic. Although the food is rich, the quality is not very high. The dining environment is quite noisy. There is no seat at the entrance, and people sit randomly. No one is required to wear a mask at the food pick-up area to ensure food hygiene. The tableware is all plastic. The coffee is not good. There are a lot of old people and children running around with loud noises. It is like a big farmers market. The dining experience is very bad. After a simple bite, I quickly left
The hotel's cooperation with travel photography is a highlight, and the photographer's aesthetics is still a bit of a level
Finally, I would like to thank Ada and Levin for their meticulous and thoughtful service.

msg:best ever! This is the best hotel experience in so many cities across the country!

[Beautiful environment] I didn't see the pictures before I came here, but I was really surprised when I came here - there are many types of swimming pools, garden groups, children's entertainment facilities that are not available in business hotels... Almost one scene at a time, all have special jobs Staff follow up. The design structure is reasonable and comfortable, full of symmetrical beauty; outside the swimming pool is a private beach, and the sand feels soft and clean. A very complete and livable environment, everyone is a master of film production!

[Thoughtful service] Name and praise Sam, Emma, and a young lady at the front desk with a ho**** voice! Not only did they give us room upgrades and gifts, but what made us happier was that they took care of the subtle emotions and devoted themselves to giving us a perfect travel experience. The ladies and sisters in the room service are also very meticulous, and the rooms are clean and tidy every day when they come back to them. ~

[Convenient transportation] There is a special car shuttle ~ about half an hour from the airport, you can quickly wash away the fatigue of the journey. In Sanya, which is constantly sweating when exposed to the air in summer, sitting in the car and chatting with the enthusiastic master is really pleasant.

Every time I always care about choosing a hotel in a city. Although it is a 15-year-old hotel, all kinds of facilities are not outdated, and the intentions of the operators and employees can be observed in it; the employees are very warm and considerate; there will be stilt walkers, big lions, balloon uncles for breakfast, and there is a small train in the park , There is also a lot of love on the 520 beach, and employees passing by will say hello... MGM is my next choice when I come to Sanya.

msg:In the past, Sanya had to choose a parent-child hotel in Yalong Bay every year. This is the third MGM. This time, I took the elderly and children to book a two-bedroom. After communicating with the front desk, I upgraded the two-bedroom, one-bedroom suite. The little brother at the front desk is still very good. Considering the epidemic situation, I was afraid of crowds, so I didn't go to the nearby commercial area for dinner. I chose the hotel's breakfast, lunch and dinner set. The lunch was the best. Because Yalong Bay had a temporary diagnosis track, the hotel kindly sent the lunch to the room. The whole attitude is very friendly. Ctrip customers have their own butlers, and the services of Link and Jane are very considerate. When I checked out, I also gave a souvenir little lion. The Bojue Brigade shooting provided by the hotel is good, but the cost of post-production photos is not cheap, and it is a little expensive. The room attendants are also very enthusiastic. Overall, I chose MGM again without stepping on the thunder, the hygiene is OK, and the food is not bad. I hope that the epidemic will end soon, and you can bring your babies on vacation every year.

The Niwan breakfast by the sea was great, and the sense of luxury was full. Miss YiLia also helped us to take pictures for us. I loved it. When it comes to taking pictures, the hotel’s travel photography is even more excellent. Bojue travel photography is well-deserved. Our friends and his party of four are very satisfied. Zhang Fan, the film selector of Bojue travel photography, has a good service attitude and is very patient in helping We filter high-quality photos, and the photographers are also excellent, taking the trouble to take all kinds of shots. Just look at the pictures, I really like it

My evaluation of MGM is the sense of belonging like a big brother
Excellent location, convenient parking, facing the sea, c-bit surf
First-class hygiene, our family aunt Chen Xiuli is beautiful, gentle, diligent and meticulous in her work, and she will not let a hair off the ground.
The playground is also a brand new kawaii modern. Although there are not many activities, it is very popular. Many children are playing with emotions, and they are hard to part when they check out.
The breakfast is rich and varied, my favorite coffee machine is really love
I especially recommend the suite of 1841. The large balcony makes me addicted to myself. I eat well and live well. I think MGM is the king of hotel and vacation in my heart.
You will know when you go there. It is recommended to stay up for three nights. Only when you are settled can you calm down and hear the sea before you can feel the meaning of vacation~
The whole family fell in love with Sanya, Yalong Bay, and MGM Hotel~ There will be a period in the future

On the last day of walking, I found that I also gave a baby gift. It was so sweet. We went out to play and helped us dry our clothes, which made us feel embarrassed. Ctrip ordered MGM and also sent Bojue Brigade to take a parent-child follow-up photo. The follow-up brother provided attentive service throughout the whole process, and it was so worth it to get the photos in the afternoon.

🔔Service: If you arrive at the hotel after 5:00 p.m., there will be a concierge who will open the door and help you with your luggage when you get off the bus. The check-in is very fast, and the service of Xiao Zhao at the front desk is very good, which makes people very comfortable!
🚗 Transportation: It is a few minutes drive from Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park, and Bohou Village Night Market is also about ten minutes away, which is very convenient!
🍃Environment: Very close to the beach, the beach is much more lively than Haitang Bay, but the sand is really fine! In the evening, the family walks to the beach, listening to the waves and stepping on the white sand can make people forget all their troubles. There are many outdoor swimming pools in the hotel, which should be two or three constant temperature and large enough. There is a heated children's pool, and there are bubble parties every day, which children especially like.
Single kart or banana boat at sea (choose 1 out of 2) My son played kart, and he had a good time for ten minutes
The breakfast is very rich, there are many kinds of fruits, and the western restaurant is very large, but if you go to have breakfast around nine o'clock, you may have to queue.

1: The location is good. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the commercial streets such as Baihua Valley and Yalong Bay Square. The hotel can directly access the beach.
2: The overall decoration is still a bit old, but it is clean. The price is usually more than 1,000, and the price is low when the peak is more than 2,000.
3: The service is really average. First of all, there are often several cleaning cars in the corridor of the room. The service staff will not say hello when they see the guests, and even the cleaning cars will not speak when they block the road;
4: When I checked in, I knew it was a Ctrip reservation, and I specifically said to let the customer service of the hotel Ctrip team scan the code. After I added it, I saw that the hotel learns to surf with a 10-minute experience ticket. Wechat asked the customer service and said that the room is not included. The problem is When I booked a room, there was no package included. I asked if I could pay for it. They said that it was only for an hour, and my child couldn't play for so long. As a result, I went to the front desk myself, and they gave me the experience without saying anything.
5: Because it is a parent-child hotel, there are really many children, and the hotel's sound insulation is very poor. After 10 o'clock in the evening, there are little friends running and playing in the corridor.
6: There are three restaurants for breakfast that are very general
Overall, the experience of staying in is average, and the service is not five-star

It is located on the seaside. There are several seafood market restaurants not far away. This time Baoma's express delivery is really flying. Swimsuits, takeaways, baby's milk, diapers, sunscreen spray, life buoys, sand dredging tools , I have my own sun protection clothes, haha. The hotel receptionist can receive the goods, which is very convenient. Finally, I will give my opinion. It is used in an old hotel, and the TV is too bad. There was water, but luckily he didn't come out ￼￼, there is no plug at the desk, it's a little inconvenient, everything else is good, my mother said that I don't have any problem if I stay a few more days

msg:a lot of people
more than you think
there are many everywhere
I had high expectations because it is a large and luxurious hotel, but I think the disappoin**ent was bigger because the expectations were high.
Too many people in the breakfast room
There was nothing particularly delicious. I feel like it's enough to eat.
However, the staff are very friendly. The restaurant on the second floor was clean and delicious. I went there twice.
I had to wait two hours for the nucleic acid test because there were so many people.
Still, it wasn't bad to get paid and go.
It's a bit far from the shopping mall, so I think it's about 12-3 won by Didi.
I think I'll think about it next time

The Baihua Valley is on the right hand when you go out, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. There are performances in the evening, with singers singing at the beach bar. Don't be too cool to drink a beer with the sea breeze. Grace and Jane's service is very good, they are responsive to their requests, they respond very quickly on WeChat, help with car reservations and tax-free related issues, and they are very friendly. By the way, there is also the waiter, Zhang Yuxiang, the eldest sister from the Northeast, who folded the puppy with a towel for the doll. When the doll came back, she was very happy to see it. The chocolate at the Chocolate House is so delicious. The children liked it very much and stayed for two more days, only two days less in Haitang Bay.

🍃Environment: There is a constant temperature swimming pool, and the children's swimming pool is also constant temperature; children like it when there are bubbles; the beach is delicate and clean, and there are many entertainment items
🔔Service: I have waited for a long time to book a suite for check-in. This time I happened to have a cleaned room, so I went directly to the room to rest. It is understandable that the cleaning speed of the room in peak seasons cannot keep up with the speed of changing rooms. Other hotels are similar. this situation
The children's activities are rich but the games are a bit sloppy, and it will be over in a few minutes. The children's club is newly renovated.
The hotel has many scenes suitable for taking pictures
 Ctrip has a dedicated butler who can answer questions at any time. Jerry is very patient and nice.

This time I mainly bring children to play, so it is the most comfortable and especially suitable for children to play. The utilization rate is very high throughout the day. It's really worth it to arrange various children's activities in the bubble party. Special thanks to the hotel lobby manager for visiting and caring several times because the child is allergic to urticaria. And the service staff, Ms. Zhou Hongyan from Henan, who cleans the room every day is so warm and cares about whether we are comfortable or not Butler Grace, everyone is here, feel free to ask her if you have any problems, services, etc., can be easily dealt with, saving you a lot of small troubles. Thank you again. There is also a fat boy waiter whose name I can't remember. It seems to be English lee? Helped us move things back and forth when we changed rooms, because we didn't pack well, there were a lot of things, thank him... Breakfast here is also good. There are two restaurants of Hainanese and Western food. Anyway, happy trip to MGM Sanya, see you next year

Advantages: Children are really friendly. Children can play from 10:00 am to 9:00 pm. I chose the parent-child room, which has a tent, and can also cover the beds of Minions and Snow White. The children like it very much. The service staff was really attentive and learned that children like pink. After that, all the tableware was pink, even the ice cream.
Beach: Walk-in beach seaside, very convenient
Restaurant: Several restaurants are very convenient, the taste is average
Serve:
The service attitude is very good. Although there were some misunderstandings in the hotel, Kelly, the customer service, quickly solved the problem after learning about it. I like the response speed and ability to solve the problem, so that I have no regrets in the hotel, only expectations.
shortcoming:
The facilities are outdated. The hot water in the room has a washbasin, and the hot water needs to be put together on both sides before it can be released. The socket is in poor contact, the tiles are broken, and the bathtub has obvious stains. Fortunately, it is not used.
PS: Ctrip's service response is getting better and better!

Stayed at MGM in the five-star Yalong Bay,
The lion statue in his house is definitely no stranger to it~

💚Hotel advantages:
✨It’s very close to the sea, but the sea is not clear, there are marine projects to play
✨There is also a heated outdoor swimming pool, simulated surfing🏄, indoor spa and gym are all available, there is absolutely no problem in the hotel for a day
✨The hotel has a place to take pictures and check in. Outdoors, there are pink sports cars, small riding stables, and hammocks. I feel dreaming of returning to California~
✨High performance-price ratio, the hotels near Yalong Bay are actually not expensive, and they are also big hotels, you can get more than 300 per capita😌
✨A free bus to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop can be reserved~

Nearby attractions:
✨Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park 2.9km
✨Night market snack street 500m
✨Yalong Bay Central Square 1.1km

💚Recommendations to eat nearby:
🔥Little Dolphin Chain Seafood Restaurant (1km from the hotel)
It's super cheap and super recommended. I can't finish it at 80 per capita. There are a lot of dishes. It's delicious and five-star recommendation.

🔥Yanjiang Hainan Chicken Hotel (700m away from the hotel)
Certified time-honored brand, trustworthy, and delicious 😌 But I think it’s very expensive. It costs 200 per person if I want to eat well, but the difference between the real dishes and the pictures is a bit unbearable.

🔥Meng Meng Da Coconut Chicken (2.9km from the hotel)
Need to take a taxi to pass, recommended by a friend, come to Hainan must eat authentic coconut chicken.

Children are happier than adults. The children’s playground is big and there are plenty of activities. The bubble activity every afternoon is not to be missed. The beach is very clean and you can't stop playing.

The constant temperature pool may be the hotel with the highest water temperature, and it can be used in colder temperatures, as long as it does not rain. You can watch the evening M show and various acrobatics performances in the constant temperature pool.

This trip to Sanya was the best hotel🏨 experience. I stayed in three hotels. Although they are not the most expensive, they are indeed the most considerate and thoughtful! Needless to say, there are parent-child activities on the eve of Chris**as Eve, which is the highlight of this hotel! The most important thing is that because the room rate was downgraded, Ctrip customer service Baobao took the initiative to check out the difference in check-out fee, and the hotel even upgraded the balcony family room for free! As soon as the baby enters the room, Spongebob becomes happy! Although there is no so-called butler from check-in to check-out, every courtesy boy is a butler and is busy with everything! When we were leaving, Brother Jerry had to run to get gifts for us! 🥳The experience is really 100%! The m show buffet is really delicious compared to other buffets in the same period, especially the barbecue fat guy Jue Juezi! 👍I regret booking a room in other hotels for Chris**as Eve in advance. It’s not wrong to book MGM for any holiday, especially for parents and children! Lots of activities and beautiful scenery! Especially the travel photography that comes with the hotel package! Must shoot! The photographer’s original camera has no photos! Every photo is the internet celebrity photo you want!

msg:My friend recommended to come to MGM. His family has a lot of marine activities, which are more suitable for parents and children. The package on Ctrip we bought at that time included travel photography and fun surfing. What I didn't expect was that surfing was quite exciting. I fell a few times and made me feel dizzy. Travel shooting, I thought it was meaningless, after all, it's free. It turned out so good: The photographer who made the video made it quite a**ospheric. The photographer who took the photos was very good at taking pictures, taking us all with long legs, blue sky and white clouds, green grass, sea waves, long legs, no matter how bad it is. At night in the lobby bar, there are two foreigners, a man and a woman singing, but there are basically no guests.

🍃Environment: The beach from MGM to Ritz should be the most high-quality beach in Yalong Bay. There are more than 600 rooms in the entire hotel, and the public areas and spaces are larger than other hotels.

Room facilities: The mattress and pillows are soft, and the quilt is very light and thin. Personally feel very comfortable. There is plenty of mineral water in the room, and soft drinks in the refrigerator are also free. It is worth mentioning that each room is equipped with children’s slippers, children’s bath towels: children’s toiletries, etc., which are particularly friendly to travelers travelling with children.

🧹Hygiene: overall satisfaction.

🚗 Transportation: Located in the center of Yalong Bay Hotel Resort, the transportation is very convenient. The hotel’s on-site parking lot is also free for guests staying, as long as you go to the concierge to register your license plate.

In short, now the room rates of Sanya MGM Resort Hotel are particularly close to the people, don't hesitate to go for it?

The room has a great view of the sea. You can watch the sea from the balcony and the single sofa. All the items in the room are everything you need. The mineral water you have prepared is enough. The cola sprite coconut in the minibar is also free to drink. The hotel also specially prepared beach bags. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is perfect, with Hainanese and Chinese and Western flavors. The restaurant is optional. We have chosen Hainanese flavors for two consecutive days. They are delicious and there are many choices. Thank you Heidi for the welcome fruit prepared for us. Also, Su Liuyun and Huang Wencheng from the housekeeping depar**ent cleaned the room very carefully for us. I was moved! Later, Yalong Bay will choose MGM.

msg:Let me talk about it in the order of the picture. The first time I encountered cleaning at 12 o’clock in the morning, the noise of the vacuum cleaner could obviously be transmitted to the room with closed windows and doors on the fifth floor; the first time I encountered a hotel in the Mainland that can bring pets. For international high-star hotels, you should write clearly "Pets are allowed" on the booking page, and fully fulfill the obligation to inform, instead of writing a sentence in the "hotel policy". After all, according to national conditions, I have personally seen guests using children's baths. Pets are wrapped in robes, dogs are rolling on the balcony sofa chairs, and after work by the pool staff, guests put dogs in the pool to swim. It is more common to take beach towels for dogs. After all, your hotel does not have a special pet room, so it is no wonder that When many children sneezed suddenly, and according to my observation, there are no “dog pots” in the hotel. If I knew in advance that you were a pet hotel, I would definitely not choose to bring children in; see Figure 23 for the hotel restaurant. Four or five, I met the sliced duck, fried duck bones with ginger and green onion like leftovers, the first time I met the steamed meat patties in the shape of diced meat, and the shrimp was steamed with water. After experiencing your restaurant once , I have to trouble the Hilton next door to pick you up and take a look at the piece of duck produced by Tuqirenjia, known as Yalong Bay before; Picture 8 is the hotel’s 10th anniversary celebration. Since you are going to have a celebration, you should "live with the people", especially these. For the guests you met randomly, it is a pity that your proprietor’s state-owned enterprise organization got sick and drove the guests to a fixed area penalty station. No seats or tea were provided. The one-star service is given to the room attendant. It is true that the professional level of the Northeast sister is online, and the missing four-star is given to your management. Finally, in Figure 9, in the entire Yalong Bay, no matter which hotel’s beach chair area, there will be various vendors selling coconuts to sell houses or promote water projects. I don’t understand the others, but coconuts, I advise you not to buy them. This kind of perforated coconuts It is probably filled with saccharine or flavor, including the coconut slices that have been brushed with something. You can't buy a coconut and chop it immediately. After a few minutes, you can see if the sliced surface will be this kind of permanent white.

msg:I did a lot of guides and inquiries about the hotel before I traveled, and finally decided to book MGM. When I placed the order, I read all the reviews of this room type. Some of the bad reviews, I was quite worried about encountering them, but the actual staying experience was still very good Although the room is old, there is no smell and the sanitation is done well. When it arrives, someone helps to take the luggage and borrows a cart from the concierge. The staff will greet enthusiastically when they go out, and they will respond quickly to problems. My son and I were dreaming about nine o'clock in the morning of the third day of check-in. The guest room was cleaned by pressing the doorbell two or three times and knocking on the door to ask if we want to clean. , Woke us up, because my son slept very late at night, so he basically went to bed in the morning, so he was very angry at the time, and then he complained to the hotel butler, it’s not a problem, and I didn’t expect to get any response. Yes, in the afternoon, the guest depar**ent sent a large plate of fruits to express our hearts. The room cleaning gave us a little lion doll. We also used towels to stack the dolls for us. It feels like a little problem is treated very seriously. The detailed service is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, so the overall check-in is very satisfied. On the day of check-out, the butler also applied for me to delay check-out until 2 pm. The whole six-day and five-night itinerary ended perfectly. I would like to thank the butler grace for cleaning the room. Your caring service, thank you!

msg:MGM Hotel has serious safety hazards! The hotel is fully responsible for third-degree burns, but it has been half a month since the accident happened, so he evaded responsibility. As a parent-child hotel, there should be such a major safety hazard!
Cause: On November 24, 2021, he was burned by a Harley locomotive at the back garden of the MGM Sanya Hotel! The hotel acknowledges full responsibility. This locomotive is exclusively used for hotel guests to take pictures. The staff in charge of the locomotive left their posts temporarily and did not place any sign indicating that the locomotive has just opened and cannot be used. The most hateful thing is to consult other staff Ask if you can take a picture, get a positive answer before approaching the locomotive! As a result, it causes third-degree burns!

After flying back to Jinan the next day, he will not be responsible for a series of trea**ents. I asked to sign full responsibility for life and sign a legally valid certificate, but the hotel ignored it!
The subsequent ion beam and other expenses are not a small number, but as a large group, I did not expect to evade responsibility like this!
I have been calling Sanya 12345 and the Administration of Industry and Commerce to complain about complaints~waiting for the result!
Although I, as an ordinary person, cannot compete with large groups, I will definitely expose MGM through various channels! Use reasonable and legal means to protect your rights to the end!
Because as a parent-child hotel, I really can't imagine that if a child burns like this, the consequences are unimaginable!

msg:Satisfaction points: 1. MGM’s online customer service on WeChat, truly "service is by your side", with a response to calls; 2. Toiletries are particularly complete. Few are equipped with children’s toothbrushes and mosquito repellent, other basic models Of course there are, and this aspect is pleasantly surprised and satisfied. 3. In terms of breakfast, in terms of the two restaurants, comprehensive catering content, a variety of porridges and side dishes, and Chinese noodles such as fried dumplings, fried dumplings, and pancakes have also appeared. Unfortunately, the fried dough sticks are not enough to make them hard. Western-style waffles with 4 flavors of large-grained jams are also fresh and delicious. Hainan-style meals such as various rice noodles, rice noodles, dregs vinegar, and even tofu brains are made fresh every day. After doing my best, I am generally satisfied.
Dissatisfaction points: 1. I live in MGM for the first time. I don’t know if there is a pick-up service before. There is no airport pick-up service on National Day. Compared with the May Day Tianyu, I feel that this aspect is not advanced enough and safe and professional or full-service. , If you consider from the perspective of the epidemic, why is there a vehicle service to duty-free shops! ? 2. The cleaning quality of the room sanitation attendants is uneven. From No. 1 to No. 6, I feel that there are two sanitation attendants, one of whom is asking to do things and strives to do more. Before the end, it is better to ask again what needs to be taken care of. The quality of service and mentality of her, the other belongs to let her just do what she does, and then say that the cleaning is complete. In the middle of the day, we only want to change the bathrobe, so it is not necessary to clean all the places every day. There were particularly obvious omissions or defects when I first checked in, but the customer service sent a fruit plate to apologize. Therefore, the hotel needs to strengthen the management and training of the concept of customer service staff, especially when the problem is discovered just after check-in, it is particularly easy to leave a bad impression. 2. Because of my personal preference, I have to say, why are there no mangoes in the hotel, no mangoes in any form, no breakfast or buffet? 3. Other dissatisfaction can be regarded as small suggestions for hotel improvement, so I won't repeat them, and I think it has little effect.

msg:I originally traveled with a friend. The epidemic was not accessible. I chose MGM under the suggestion of my friend. Compared with many star-rated hotels of the same type, it is indeed very cost-effective! Originally, I only booked for one night and haven't decided which hotel of the same type to stay in for the last two nights. Later, I compared this hotel with the highest price-quality ratio, and I was too lazy to bother, so I chose the same hotel! We were received by Lynne when we checked in. Although we had placed three separate orders for three nights, the first two nights with a pool room and the next night with a sea view room, Lynne also upgraded us to a luxurious supreme sea view room with a super positive view. It feels great to see the sea by opening the window! The hotel’s pool room has a sunny side and a back side. It is recommended to choose a sunny side. We have no special remarks. Therefore, the pool room basically cannot get water on the back side, because the sun will disappear after a while. But the hotel’s public swimming pools are very large and there are many, so basically we just play in the public swimming pools, so the price-performance ratio of the pool room is not so high for us! On the first night, Lynne also prepared bath salts for us to ask about it, so it was really comfortable! Drinks in the minibar are free of charge. Knowing that I like to drink coconut milk, I have a few more bottles of coconut milk for contacting me alone, which is really considerate! For breakfast, we were upgraded to a seafood restaurant to experience a different dining environment, next to the sea! The staying experience is really very good! Will recommend to friends! Thank you Lynne for your considerate care and service! It's great.

The overall environment of the hotel is very comfortable, which is what I really want during this trip. When I checked out today, I still had two beautiful little sisters, Titi and Heidi, and the service was still very good. Next time I come to Sanya, I will come to MGM, and I will also recommend my friends to come!

msg:🚗 Transportation: About 40 minutes from the airport, there are Ole Shopping District and Liupan Village around you can go shopping and eat and buy fruits. You can get there within 10 minutes by car.
🧹Hygienic: The sanitary meat in the room is still very good. Sheets, quilts, etc. are fine. The elevator in the room is also very careful. Paper towels, disinfectant, and trash cans are placed
🍃Environment: The layout of the hotel is good. It is close to the seaside of Yalong Bay. Walk around the swimming pool on the left. Below is the beach. There are a lot of mushroom lounge chairs to bask in the sun. There are also various marine activities to play and beach volleyball to satisfy all kinds of people. I need not to be boring. Look out. The various swimming pools in the hotel. The water quality is also very clear. The steps on the beach are all pictures. The scenery in the hotel is beautiful and the weather is beautiful.
🔔Service: When I checked in, Xue Jing served me and the attitude was very good. I booked the Supreme Ocean View Room and took the initiative to upgrade me to a selected Supreme Ocean View Room. The view from the balcony in the room is the same as the picture. The real view is good. The wide sea view is used to sleeping on a hard mattress. The first day I was a little uncomfortable, I asked Xue Jing to help me add a harder mattress. The hotel happened to have a palm cushion and the service was very good on the second day.
The only pity is that the breakfast is not good. There are few varieties. My favorite salmon has no freshly squeezed juice. Except for watermelon, no other fruits are not sweet. Look at the picture of the pineapple. The color is not sweet and not like Hainan. It looks frozen. The breakfast price of 244 yuan for too long should not be just this level. The fried noodles are uneven and tasteless. Many things are not very tasty. I hope to improve
There are also all kinds of cute lifebuoys in the swimming pool. You shouldn’t ask customers to spend money on renting them. They should be able to borrow for free. Five-star hotels should have services. In fact, these things are not expensive.
Overall I feel good and will come to live in the future

The public play area is the most abundant in Yalong Bay. Several hotels around have visited it. There is only a small swimming pool. There are so many MGM swimming pools that you want to play one by one. High film production rate. The experience of staying in is very good. If you are in Yalong Bay, it will definitely be MGM next time.

msg:The hotel is located in Yalong Bay. I feel that it is in the center of Yalong Bay. There are many places to eat at Baihuagu Commercial Plaza next to it. MGM is a very cost-effective hotel. We stayed for two nights on our honeymoon and the balcony faces the sea. It's the side that you must have the middle one next time. It seems that the middle one is gone or something is forgotten. I noticed that there are many facilities for children to play in the hotel and will give priority to this hotel if there is a chance to have a baby. Walking down the hotel is the swimming pool, beach, sea. The lack of the hotel, the opening time is long, the facilities are a bit old, the overall living experience is still very good, very recommended. The water quality in Yalong Bay is very good, and the sand is relatively fine. However, everyone should pay more attention to it when playing. I accidentally scratched some when playing in the sea.

msg:Spent two nights in a pool bed room.
When placing the order, I noted the swimming pool that I wanted to be private, and as a result, I arranged an exclusive swimming pool.
The feeling of living out of a villa~

After check-in, Grace gave a welcome chocolate dessert and fruit plate very intimately.
The flaming chocolate is super cute and solid, and it was a bit wasteful to check out.

The National Day food set recommended by Grace is very cost-effective, and the poolside BBQ in the evening is worth eating~ the ancient salt-baked chicken is also good, and there is also a set of Haagen-Dazs afternoon tea.

10.4 I watched the beach party performance at night, it was wonderful.
Many awards were opened, but unfortunately none of them were drawn.

I had a great time surfing, and I also played sea castles and sea couches, karting and VR movies.
It's a pity that the weather has been rainy after staying in, so come back next time when the weather is good~

msg:The service is completely different from the price! First of all, when I made a reservation, for some reason, the hotel said that they could upgrade the room type for me for free. Although it was through Ctrip, I confirmed it with the hotel twice. At the time of check-in, I was informed that the upgraded room type did not have a twin room. Add a small simple bed to the bed room, or you can only use the original room type, there is no other choice, I don't agree, after the front desk communicated with the manager, there is a twin room. . .
Secondly, the service staff's service awareness is extremely poor. It suddenly rained that day, and many children played in the children's swimming pool. Bath towels were not provided in the children's swimming pool. Because it was raining and windy, the children came out of the swimming pool and it was cold. Some parents wanted the staff to contact the big swimming pool. Some bath towels were sent there to keep the children warm, but the staff at the big swimming pool had been inconvenient to send them when it was raining, and they refused because they were wet. It is only a few steps away. If you really think about the customers, will you think of a way? Can't get an umbrella?
Third, the hotel said that it is parent-child, but the small train actually charges? Still so expensive? Is the children's play area closed? The children's toothbrush is not provided, so you need to call to request it? If you can't afford parent-child, don't say your parent-child, learn from Yanlord Crown about parent-child, don't make yourself nondescript.
Fourth, there is no free swimming ring in the swimming pool, you can only buy it if you need it. The charging treasures in the pool bar are all broken, and the public area only provides charging treasures at the concierge at the gate.
Fifth, the service awareness and service attitude of all service personnel are extremely poor.
Sixth, the breakfast variety is too small.
The only satisfaction is that the beach quality of the hotel is not bad

Booking a honeymoon room feels like a daily business trip to participate in a forum. The decoration is very old-fashioned (you can feel it by looking at the cabinet behind the takeaway photos I sent ). The entertainment area and leisure area are not well planned, and it is not good to hear the noise outside in the room in the evening. The most annoying thing is that the service is too messy. I booked a room on Ctrip. When I arrived at the scene, I said that the front desk couldn't find it. We applied for an appoin**ent for a wake-up call service, and did not receive any reminders at all early the next morning. Hey, in short, it was the worst experience in Sanya. There is no feeling of vacation.

There is no face-to-face contact with the hospital. My girlfriend pushed me when the car-hailing arrived at the hospital. It was raining heavily and we both got wet, including my injured foot. We waited in line at the hospital for nearly 40 minutes to bandage the wound. Because I was preparing for pregnancy, I did not follow the doctor's instructions to inject tetanus. When we returned to the hotel, the manager on duty briefly greeted us if we needed a light meal. I said no. She left.) By 9:30 the next morning, I did not receive any kind of condolences from the hotel, so I called 12315 to complain, and the hotel called me at about 10 o'clock to ask if I needed breakfast. Breakfast at ten o'clock? If I didn't make a complaint call, maybe I wouldn't even have this fake call? At 11:00 noon, I booked a car from the hotel to the airport and arrived at the airport. I was told by the airport that I could not board the plane because the wound did not heal and it was relatively large. Then the hotel arranged a vehicle to pick us up at the hotel. After that, the hotel leaders did so-called condolences without giving me any promises or results. I'm sick of this hotel now! On the way to the airport at noon today, the hotel told me to give me a room voucher, so I want to ask you, do you think I still believe in MGM? What's the point of making something fake? How much is it that you have not compensated me for the minimum medical expenses? Because of you and my honeymoon trip, because of you and me, the whole itinerary is disrupted, because of you and I can't go home normally, because of you and I have to delay a lot of work! I need your attitude, the attitude to handle things! From the beginning to the end, I didn't say a bad word, do you think we are easy to bully? If there is no result at 9:30 tomorrow morning, it will be handed over to the police, and I will continue to complain!

The attitude of some front desk staff still needs to be paid attention to. If you really can’t feel your own expression, put a mirror in front of the counter, which will help to improve; 2. The price of the buffet does not match the ingredients. The crabs are not fat, the crayfish are not very fresh, the tuna is thawed, and there is a lot of water in the fish... But if the price of the buffet includes the M show, then I will not say it, I hope the hotel can increase the variety of ingredients and improve the quality of the ingredients in the future Well, at least it is as rich and as good as breakfast; 3. The quality of the things sold in the hotel store is average, and the price is expensive. Isn't it better to sell some hotel cultural and creative products in such a good place?

msg:I went on vacation by myself, and I chose the hotel for a long time. Fortunately, I chose MGM. Because of the off-season, I upgraded the selected Supreme Ocean View Room for free. Thanks Grace for the answer. The reply was quick-solved many problems, great! When you get off the bus, there will be a welcoming staff to help with luggage, and a staff member to help open the door when you get on the bus.
🚗 Transportation: 1. The hotel is about 1 km away from Baihuagu Commercial Street, and it takes only ten minutes to walk. There are McDonald's, Starbucks, Hey Tea and so on. 2. It is not far from the forest park, about 4-5 kilometers, and a taxi is also very fast. 3. The hotel has a shuttle bus to Haitang Bay Duty Free City every day, just make an appoin**ent in advance-there is also a 5% discount that also requires advance appoin**ent.
🧹Hygienic: Yalong Bay was developed early. It doesn’t matter if the room decoration is old. It is very clean. It is also equipped with a safety bag. It is cleaned every day. The staff is also very serious. I am a bit clean, but I don’t see bad places. Very at ease.
🍃Environment: Yalong Bay is facing C. There are several swimming pools in the hotel. They are all equipped with deck chairs. There are also deck chairs on the beach. It is very comfortable to lie down without going into the water. The green coverage rate is also high. After going out to sea, look back. Gao Mei is the most conspicuous.
🔔Service: Grace is really good~ I like it, and I also gave a piece of fruit. The overall service is very satisfactory. The staff will greet you every time you go out. The experience is very good. There will be a band singing in the hotel every afternoon at tea time, and you can hear it on the balcony upstairs. There are also performances on the pool stage in the evening-there are also many parent-child activities. You can order takeaways, but takeaways cannot enter the interior of the hotel. They will be placed on the glass table in the lobby due to security issues and can be taken downstairs.

It’s a pity that I didn’t experience land surfing and sea castles. Because of the big waves, the sea castles were not opened, but when I was about to leave, I saw it started to build. Hahahaha, I can only experience it next time~

Not only did you answer questions during the period, but also took great care of us, helping us pack afternoon tea to the room, as well as gifts, very kind and friendly! Several hotels were booked on Ctrip during this trip, and the staff did not give up to help us contact us with order issues day and night.
MGM is still very good, and the off-season price is also very suitable. I will definitely stay at MGM Resort Sanya next time~

The children exchanged 40 coins from the activities for the stationery box. They were very happy. The butler service is also in place, and the response is timely, and even laundry detergent is provided. Compared with room prices, it's a great value. Although there are a lot of guests, children like to lively. There is only one point: the seafood ingredients for the dinner buffet still need to be strengthened.

The breakfast is rich and user-friendly, and the meal time is the longest: 8 to 11 in the morning. It's too comfortable for people like us who sleep late.
There is a Baihua Night Market about 1km to the right of the hotel, which is very convenient for eating.
The only drawback is the TV, not digital TV, which has fewer movies, unclear, and feels older.

msg:The hotel service is very good, the hotel has a guest relations depar**ent Jane, Xiao Huang, Grace and other staff are very attentive and friendly. They also sent flowers and cakes specially for my mother's birthday. Before leaving, he also gave the baby lion, the mascot of MGM. The hotel has been open for more than ten years, the rooms look really old, but the service is good, there are beautiful fountains in the park outside, and the swimming pools are very beautiful. Every waiter is very polite. Even the intern girl who cleans the room in the housekeeping depar**ent is also very enthusiastic and has a sense of service. We are twins, so the hotel gave two baby cots. The baby liked it very much and the bedding was very comfortable. I was very satisfied with this stay, and I will choose MGM for future trips.
The only failure was the 5 travel shots he sent, and his attitude was really bad. We have a room with 2 large and 2 small. I asked if it is possible to have 2 photos of the baby and 3 photos of 4 people. Of course, if you take a good photo, you will definitely buy the photo. That person said no! Either 5 for 2 babies or 5 for 4 people! ! And you can't change scenes, and you can't shoot the lawn if you choose the beach! Those who choose the lawn can't shoot the swimming pool! What's ridiculous is that I chose a family portrait of 4 people. After taking 2 photos, the baby didn't cooperate with the photo. My husband and I took a few photos! At this time, he agreed? The photos taken are not good and I can’t choose them. I propose to take a few more photos of the baby and I will buy them separately. The photographer also said that he could not shoot alone. This is a photo shoot. What is to be paid for 699 and send me 100 photos! Is there any difference between taking pictures of two babies and taking pictures of me and my husband? I heard the photographer scold my husband "SJB" while taking pictures! If I told my husband at that time, I would probably enter the game now.
Since it is the 5 photos taken by the hotel, please supervise the staff of the hotel, don’t you train them? Don't let this villain affect the image of the hotel, OK? Since there are so many regulations, why don't you write them clearly on the Ctrip reservation page in advance? If the information is unclear, you have to be angry when you take pictures!
Such a perfect hotel service must be the result of the hotel concept to the training of various depar**ents. All the staff work so hard to create a beautiful accommodation experience for the guests. It is really a flaw in the beauty of it, sorry!

The children have a lot of fun, but it rained when they first came, which is a pity!

msg:Room facilities:
The room is still big, and the balcony is also big. Although I haven't opened the balcony to sit, there are bumper stickers everywhere. There are tents and mini basketball stands in the room. The wooden horse is for children to play. There are toilet seats for children in the bathroom. A sink, the sink design is very low, the mineral water is also sufficient, there are children’s toiletries, shower gel shampoo, beach bags, beach slippers suitable for the whole family, and the intentions of the parent-child hotel are everywhere.

breakfast:
Eat breakfast before 8 o’clock, there is a discount for older children, I was told that I paid the next day, because the next day I said I had to pay 149, I said why I served 75 yesterday, the waiter said that because yesterday was before 8 o’clock, it turns out Yes, there are many varieties, all kinds of freshly squeezed juices
There are six or seven kinds of fruits in the fruit area, and the quality is very good.
The noodles are good. Every morning, both children have to eat a bowl of noodles. Hainan’s noodles are either noodles or instant noodles.
There are many kinds of meat and it is very complete, but the breakfast pizza has nothing but the taste is average
Deep-fried steamed buns are delicious, and the slices of fried steamed buns are a bit spicy. I think it tastes better. It’s not changed every day, right?
wifi:
Wi-Fi in the lobby

bed:
The beds in the standard room cannot be combined, but the 1.2-bed family can also sleep comfortably, but they can’t sleep together.
Room view:
The balcony didn’t dare to get too hot, face the hotel garden
Location traffic:
There are 2 taxis parked at the entrance of the hotel all year round. You can also call your own taxi. It's very convenient to go anywhere.
The hotel has arranged a lot of parent-child activities and children can have fun without going out. Next time, I will consider staying here with high cost performance

msg:Due to flight delays, I temporarily booked this hotel for one night transition, but I did not expect it to be the best hotel to stay in Sanya this time. The indoor facilities are a bit old, but the outdoor facilities are still very good; the service is especially good, and I encountered it in the corridor The cleaning staff would take the initiative to say hello. The lady who asked for 2 bottles of mineral water for cleaning also generously gave several bottles. After check-in, I added the customer service WeChat account to answer all questions. This is a few blocks away from other hotels. The only downside is that the outdoor swimming pool is too sun-dried. If you can consider some shading facilities, there should be more tourists.

msg:Because I like the seaside but I can’t go abroad because of the epidemic, I take my baby to the Sanya hotel every year. I stayed at Atlantis and Mid-Levels Intercontinental last year. I wanted to stay in Yalong Bay. I tried a lot of reviews. I chose the MGM Hotel service desk. The check-in was very fast and I said that the room on the 3rd floor has been cleaned, do you need to move in, otherwise you have to wait for the room on the 2nd floor but it is still cleaning and there is no difference, so I decisively accepted the room on the 3rd floor with my parents and baby. The sea-view two-bedroom room is disappointed after entering the door with so much anticipation! The imaginary sea view did not appear. I was half a football field away from the sea view. [Piaozui] I went around the room twice and felt that this sea view room was too perfunctory, so I called the front desk and asked if this room type is like this. If there are high-floor rooms to choose from, I just want to ask if the guests don’t respond. The so-called sea-view room that is close to three thousand and one nights can be considered as pitted into it.
In addition to this unpleasant experience when checking in, the overall service attitude of the hotel is good, responsive
The original intention of choosing this hotel was to see that there are many children's projects to choose from. The result is actually charging everywhere. This is really a bit disappointing. The hotel train ride is 58 yuan. The InterContinental Hotel in Mid-Levels before staying at this time feels free if It would be better if the hotel provides some free parent-child projects. In addition, the air-conditioning in the room is very weak. You have to wait a long time to cool down. The breakfast restaurant is also a bit old. I should not choose this one next time.

Although it is not as good as Haitang Bay in terms of hardware, the hotel's environmental facilities and recreational projects are indeed very rich. There are also many food courts outside the hotel that have free shuttles to and from the hotel. Those who are not used to the hotel can also go to see nearby haha. The hotel service is also in place. Special thanks to the two aunts Pu Yanhong and Dong Fulan who cleaned the room for us. Knowing that we were on our honeymoon, they also put on such a beautiful scene on the bed for two consecutive days. Thank you very much. I hope the hotel can Our gratitude brings these two dedicated aunts.

The Haitang breakfast restaurant has a wide variety of dishes, and the taste is great. The restaurant manager Zhang Yong is very enthusiastic and guided carefully. He also asked about the dining experience in the middle. It is a pleasant surprise that I feel that I am concerned about it! The swimming pool is clean and tidy. The tanned brothers don’t hesitate to smile, take the initiative to greet and greet them, and the lifeguards are very serious and responsible for patrolling, making me feel safe in the pool.

It is very pleasant to have breakfast and enjoy the sea view. MGM is in the middle of Yalong Bay, and the beach is quite good.
Disadvantages: The room arranged by the hotel for us is in the farthest position, and the sea view is a bit biased. The quality of the toilet is relatively poor, the cushion is crooked, and it is a bit offensive.

It is in the middle of Yalong Bay, with a great view. It is two hotels away from Baihua Valley, and it can be reached on foot. This time I booked the Supreme Sea View Suite, two bedrooms and one living room, 270 degree sea view. Guests of the Invincible Sea View Suite can go to the Niwan Restaurant on the beach for breakfast, without queuing, ordering products and salmon. Special thanks to Mi Li for her warmth and friendliness. She cleaned the room and helped the baby stack several kinds of small animals with towels. My old man also likes her. I chatted with the housekeeper for a while and introduced the hotel and surrounding environment, friendly and friendly. As a veteran hotel, the age is a bit longer, the facilities are relatively old, and the children's water playing area is a bit potholes affecting the experience. Overall satisfaction.

我們住的時間比較長，酒店特意安排了“管家”加微信，真的無論什麼事情給kimi發個微信馬上解決！免去了我打總機電話📞等待⌛️的時間。😘

設施：🏝️酒店設施配套齊全🏨不出酒店吃喝玩樂全解決，真正的度假感！
而且…來過很多次三亞 遊走過很多酒店的我，這是有孩子後第一次來三亞！感覺“美高梅”特別適合小朋友們！有表演、有萌寵樂園！就連早餐都有小童區域，都是孩子們比較喜歡的類型。🤓

衞生：🧹房間整潔、乾淨、舒適，房間有抽濕機不會感覺潮濕。我們帶孩子去海邊玩回房間後，房間已經打掃好了不説，還把我的睡衣跟寶爸的褲衩子都給疊好了！我瞬間覺得太不好意思😬
重點⚠️住過這麼多酒店夜裡我都會留夜燈，但在這裏…我完全不需要！就特別舒服的感覺。

還沒入住就有管家就聯繫我 開始預約第二天的很多活動。沒想到半日託管活動很豐富 兩位小姐姐也超級耐心。不僅會顧及到小朋友的情緒 還有他們活動期間的狀態 是不是熱了 是不是需要喝水等等。
管家服務也是很到位 一開始以為衹是入住前按照慣例的詢問 沒想到後面兩天也是有求必應。點贊。
酒店送的鉑爵旅拍也是驚喜連連 短短大概20分鐘也沒有佔據我們太多時間結果成品幾乎沒有廢片。後麪價格合理 不出意外全部拿下。
美高梅雖然房間設計看得出比較陳舊 但勝在衞生很乾凈 服務好活動多。本次出遊 很滿意。

房間面積不算很大，但是不覺得侷促，很多評論説設施老舊，其實倒是還好，風格屬於典型的美式酒店裝修風格，電視雖然不大但是都去了三亞，誰又會天天在房間裏看電視呢？燒水壺確實該更新了。咖啡機擺放的位置在上面一層的玻璃架上，有點不合理。咖啡膠囊建議以後有個小盒子來擺放，現在就是感覺有點隨意了。
帶我們入住的是賓客關係專員Candy小唐，服務超級貼心，從入住到任何的需求都是直接聯繫她。退房的時候也是在大堂親自送我們。
我們備註的是蜜月旅行，所以特意給擺了玫瑰花，還有花瓣浴，用了陽台早餐升級劵，超級豐盛，而且拍照無敵！酒店的room service有點小貴，不過牛肉麪超級好吃！霓灣西餐廳的食材有帶提升，味道還不錯，服務也好。
總之下回來還會住這個酒店，而且下次再來應該就是帶着孩子來了，這家酒店的親子項目很多！

很好的入住體驗！這回入住酒店安排的管家Tina，真是太好了☺️熱情服務，遇到任何事情直接找管家，真是太方便了！

msg:在mgm四大一小一共住了四晚，總的來説還是挺滿意的，但是還有些細節是需要改進的。前廳部的jasmin有應必答，很負責。
先説優點吧：
- 泳池毛巾無限量供應
-沙灘很乾凈
- 房間衞生搞得不錯
-無限量供應礦泉水
-非常熱鬧，大廳總是有外國演員的表演
-非常適合親子，萌寵樂園很好玩，樂高樂園也很好玩
-三個早餐廳各有優點，套房餐廳的海鮮麪，海南餐廳的抱羅粉，大餐廳的米粉各有特色。
不太滿意的地方：
-房間沒有提前製冷，導致我們進入房間的第一體感很差，開了空調之後發現空調半天不製冷是壞的，又聯繫管家換房
-換號房間之後房間也得重新開空調，大概折騰了一個小時才安頓下來。安頓下來之後發現馬桶蓋也是壞的。。。有點破防
-結果第二天晚上新房間卧室的空調又壞了
所以我覺得很需要改進的一點：房客入住之前請一定一定提前製冷並且檢查一下房間的設施是不是都是好的！

但是總的來説管家的反應速度工作人員的反應速度以及技術人員的反應速度都還是很快的。和管家説完問題之後基本上十分鐘之內就會有工作人員過來解決。所以我覺得美高梅的服務還是不錯的。另外我媽媽不小心把手機落在泳池廁所裏面了，我打電話過去被一個叫做林立豐的救生員撿到了，還給了我。非常謝謝！
如果你問我美高梅怎麼樣？那麼我還是會説：盡情沖吧！

我們預訂了花園親子房，房間親子設施貼心到家，有小帳篷、搖搖馬、小藍框、小浴袍、小馬桶、小童洗漱用品一應俱全，真的太適合帶孩子入住了！

酒店有很大的室外泳池和專屬沙灘，帶孩子玩足夠了，而且還分大人和孩子的戲水區和沖浪區，可以滿足不同的需求。沙灘的沙子顆粒有些大，但很乾凈，海水很清澈，特別適合拍照。泳池有毛巾和手臂浮力器，可以隨借隨用，不用帶了，沙灘有小孩子挖沙子的鏟子等工具，自己按需取用就行，特別方便。

管家Kimi小楊特別熱心，服務非常棒。在我們入住前就聯繫了我們，給我們發了很多酒店的親自活動介紹，住店期間也是有求必應，考慮的非常周到，最後幫忙延時退房是一大早發訊息給Kimi，上班後第一時間就幫忙搞定然後告知了我們，真的特別給力。我們因為走的匆忙，把孩子的一條小褲子落在了酒店房間，第三天的時候才想起來，立即發訊息給Kimi，Kimi熱心的回覆並幫忙找到了這條褲子，還幫忙快遞到家，暖心服務，大大的贊。

酒店的早餐挺豐富的，最喜歡小麪和砂鍋粥，連着吃了兩天，有各種小寶寶可以吃的食物，麥片、麪包、蛋撻、意麪等，總之種類齊全就是了。最重要的是早餐供餐到11點，睡懶覺也不耽誤起來吃早飯哦。

酒店還有室內的小童遊樂區，萌寵樂園，這些要單獨花錢，預訂酒店有贈送的就可以免費。酒店各種親子活動很多，但我們就想游泳，所以基本沒參加，就衹參加了贈送的螢火蟲放飛活動，雖然螢火蟲還沒飛到天上就被小朋友一擁而上捉起來了，但第一次見到螢火蟲的小傢伙還是興奮了好幾天呢。

酒店裡夜市很近，一千多米，走着就能到，那邊有些吃飯的館子，晚上可以去逛逛。

整體體驗很不錯，下次再來還會選擇入住的。

海上香蕉船（雙人）:挺刺激的，適合想玩水上運動但膽子不大的人，哈哈～
Fun動沖浪雙人體驗:這個沒約到，一定要提前一天在沖浪池那裡預約。

去年也來三亞玩了，住的是隔壁的喜來登，總的來説美高梅比喜來登好很多，無論是環境還是服務方面，親子設施安排得很細緻，有嬰兒泳圈浮臂和洗漱用品還有小台階，房間在亞龍灣相對來説算新的了。配備孩子用的恆温泳池這點對親子游很友善。早餐很棒，味道基本都還可以，尤其主食方面，有面餛飩抄手還有各種特色粥，尤其海鮮粥非常好吃，爸媽第一天一人喝了兩碗哈哈。酒店內的水果店也很便宜，一個椰子9元比外面還便宜。另外尤其感謝服務專員Tina，入住期間一直問候是否住得舒適，有問題也是及時解決回覆快，下次入住還會選擇美高梅！
要説有什麼不足的話，我個人認為1號樓離地下車庫實在是有點遠，出去一趟要走好多路哦，如果能電梯直接下到車庫就好了，畢竟來三亞玩租車的人也是很多的。其他已經和Tina説過了。

優點:
1.沙灘是真漂亮，浪很小，可以親近大海；酒店自己的海灘，有人打理很乾凈，躺椅、遮陽傘、挖沙工具、吧枱應有盡有。（比比才知道，海棠灣公共沙灘是真的臟亂，一切設施毫無）
2.室外自帶多個恆温泳池，設計個性美觀。
3.娛樂項目齊全，大人小孩的都有，做到不出酒店也能暢玩愉快。
4.團購池畔自助晚餐價格優惠，餐食不錯，觀看錶演位置佳。
5.鉑爵旅拍出片效果很贊，不過視頻略顯敷衍。
不足:
1.可能客流量大房間緊張，入住等待時間較長。
2.海灘沙子太粗硌腳，沙灘回來沖洗點就一個，兩個龍頭，感覺少了，水量再大點更好。
小貼士（酒店有兩個朝向，面朝酒店內部泳池的風景應該好點；沙灘上有賣金椰的小販，非常好喝，小小的水分特足）

msg:房間內燈光很昏暗，辦公一會眼睛都疼，全海景房的風景沒有天域的好看，酒店商業化很嚴重，房間沒有洗衣機，也沒有公用洗衣房，洗衣服按件收費；買的套餐裡帶了沙灘燒烤套餐，結果因為是套餐所以不讓坐在上面比較寬鬆的椅子上，給我們趕到了下面小椅子上，套餐對比下來其實燒烤套餐不算送的也是花了錢，讓人心裏很不舒服
還有當時因為航班延誤想改一下入住時間，同時定了天域和美高梅兩個酒店，美高梅一直寫上不下了，就是不給改日期，被迫在三亞多呆了兩天，最後兩天果斷又搬回天域了
最後奉勸大家購買套餐的時候一定慎重！！！有些套餐還有所謂的第三方，溝通其他非常費勁！！！

前廳部管家Tom服務也很好，有問題都會幫忙解答，還提前先發了酒店項目和地圖～
酒店的早餐有兩家餐廳，都非常好吃並且種類很多，西式中式都有

msg:第五次來海南了 每次定不同的酒店不同房型 這次五一假期定了美高梅 管家服務 管家Sean小肖有問必答 響應很快 服務周到 酒店整體也還是滿意的  
餐廳有兩個 一箇中西自助 一個海南特色 比較喜歡海南特色 但需要早去 不然排隊 
酒店活動很多 特色M秀還挺熱鬧 五一期間還有抽獎 一等獎是海景房
萌寵樂園有些蛇、蜥蜴爬寵可以玩 但比較小 兩大一下300多不太值 
泳池旁邊有共享水槍 還有水上推進器還挺好玩 單租略貴 後來才發現可以買那種玩幾天的優惠套餐 然後就是槽點了 比如充電插孔設計有點問題 插頭老掉 比如泳池房水深寫的1.15 但其實有1.3 對小朋友略不友好 而且不規則那種 比如全海景房 第一次給了個一間中間一堵牆遮擋的房型 後來溝通換了房間  比如小火車 一大一小58  要是兩大一小就是58*2  
整體還不錯 下次再來再找管家Sean給我推薦其他房型試試

設施：大人寶寶一起睡覺的話，單人床有點擠。建議電吹風升個級，總體感覺都還不錯。泳池很棒，休息躺椅很多，小童泳池有遮陽棚，孩子很喜歡。
衞生：乾淨整潔，沒有怪味，住的三樓也很乾燥，點個贊。
服務：前廳部jasmine管家服務到位，早早就對接我，贈了兩衹小獅子，一盒Havana護膚品。早餐有兩個餐廳可選，建議海南風格餐廳，能嚐到本地糟粕醋、抱羅粉、椰子粉等等，味道很好很划算。
螢火蟲觀賞科普與互動體驗:真的不必參加，螢火蟲都不會飛的，很雞肋。
小童Fun動沖浪:這個8歲以下沒法參加，需要注意一下。

設施：酒店設施很齊全，很適合度假。遊玩設施豐富，泳池，沖浪機，小動物園，滑索和酒店自帶的沙灘，極大的豐富了在酒店的時光。酒店的4個餐廳各有特色，泳池邊的海鮮自助燒烤，兩個人400多的價格可以説很划算了。

服務：服務在所有我住過的酒店裡都可以排的上非常靠前的位置，從Sean到每個服務員和清潔人員都非常友善，所有人看到你都會給你熱情打招呼，並且會詢問是否需要幫助。這種服務態度能給我們帶來很大的情緒價值！

缺點：玩樂項目較以前沒多大變化，親子項目少且主持缺乏控場能力，也可以説沒規劃好，比如我們參加的螢火蟲捕捉，現場一片混亂，全是大人在搶着捉，很多小孩被擠開哭成一片[裂開]，主持人衹是口頭提醒家長不要去搶，沒有實際措施阻止。其實很簡單，用圍欄把家長攔在外面,讓小朋友進圍欄去捉就好。游泳池一如既往的暴曬[破涕為笑]。還有童夢天地要求家長和小朋友進場穿上地板襪，可是現場不止一個工作人員卻穿着臟兮兮的襪子進去，這個確實[皺眉]

酒店設施配很全，小孩子的活動也安排的比較滿，晚上有演出，離海邊也很近，整體感覺還是不錯的，房間裏面的床墊子有點兒問題，很軟，還總是響，一動就響…還有就是小童項目螢火蟲項目很雞肋，準備的很有儀式感，一人發個網，大家都以為是要捕捉，結果到了草地抖在地上大家滿地的撿，哈哈哈哈哈😂體驗感很差，還被咬了一身包。

管家Tom馬傑很熱情有問必答，每次響應都很迅速。有問題和他説他就馬上給解決。
酒店離沙灘很近，酒店環境超級漂亮，拍照打卡很出片，穿過泳池區域就到了沙灘，亞龍灣的沙子有點硌腳。。
給安全意識很強的保潔阿姨點個贊，有次回來恰巧阿姨開着門在打掃，我直接進去，阿姨立刻讓我刷一下房卡確認我是房主才讓進的。
早餐兩天都在特色餐廳吃的，不用排隊，味道很好，最喜歡牛肉細麪，孩子很喜歡那個自助台，可以自己拿到喜歡的吃的。有寶寶圍兜，很棒。

來之前看到很多説他家服務態度不好，我還有點兒擔心，於是諮詢了身邊住過他家的朋友，都讓我選擇美高梅，果然沒有選錯…

💁♂️關於服務
每次出行都是大包小包一大堆行李，到達酒店行李小哥為我們開了車門，帶我到前台辦理入住手續，很快辦完入住手續，比想象的效率更高👍
幸運的是結識了酒店前廳王星經理，王經理送我們到房間，一路上給我們詳細介紹了酒店的設施及娛樂活動，入住期間對我們更是無微不至關懷
，加了微信以後訂房直接找王經理👩💼

🏠關於房間
屋內裝修沒有我想的那麼老化
入住前打電話要求佈置，好貼心的在浴缸內放滿了玫瑰花瓣兒，床上也摺疊小動物
室內拖鞋、沙灘拖鞋浴袍也備了大人和小孩子的，房間還配放了愛馬仕橙沙灘包

🏊關於泳池
美高梅的泳池並不是特別出片，因為瓷磚顏色太深，但是這裡有小朋友喜歡的遊樂池和玩不完的活動項目
每天晚上在泳池中心都有M秀表演
泳池邊上還有沖浪🏄

🍴關於餐廳
早餐有兩個餐廳可選擇
海南風味和西式兩個餐廳
個人比較推薦海邊-霓灣餐廳，環境沒得説，非常出片

總結一下，整體優點還是很多，設施細節服務都很不錯👍

設施：來這裏主要還是看中設施齊全，沙灘、各種各樣海上活動、泳池、Fun動沖浪、臨海沖天滑梯、泡泡秀、小火車、滑索、萌寵樂園、童夢天地、表演、還有一張紙的小童活動，簡直太豐富了，是小朋友們的天堂 ，完全可以一直泡在酒店。
當然酒店附近配套設施也應有盡有，步行就可以。

衞生：酒店雖然開業時間較久，但整體保養還是不錯的，大堂很乾凈明亮，一眼便可看到一望無際的大海🌊

服務：前台辦理入住小姐姐效率很快，唯一不足是辦完手續需要等待房間打掃，我的管家是Star美女，幫我們把行李寄存後帶我們前往休息區休息，房間打掃好後第一時間把房卡給我們送到休息室帶我們去房間，入住期間也是無微不至關心，感覺是24小時一直在線，每次發訊息都是秒回覆，非常熱情，感謝Star的照顧。

帶孩子喜歡人氣熱賣的可入👍

講講缺點吧，房間所有插頭都鬆了，吹頭髮手機充電不好用，生意太好，入住時間拖的有點久，但處理態度很好。那個陽台，簡直奪命陽台，我住了三亞一半的高端酒店，第一次遇到這些有陽台又不算陽台的裝修。你説不讓人出去吧，它是大落地玻璃門，能出去，可進深才四十釐米，玻璃圍欄高一米二三左右，抽根煙都害怕掉下去…
酒店最忌諱的是異味，結果一樓全是廚房的油煙味，説明廚房吸煙不好，樓道換氣不好。
最後説説早餐，飯不錯，就是環境衞生真的太差了，自己看照片吧。
最後感謝kimi小楊的專業熱情服務，幫忙不少，謝謝啦

msg:入住後管家Candy小唐就聯繫了我，預訂的親子房，給了我們一個帶超大陽台的房間，有漂亮的海景。房間有寶寶的洗漱用品，酒店有很多泳池，出門是海灘，酒店入住率很高，比較熱鬧。很開心的入住體驗。
