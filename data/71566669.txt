msg:Overall: great stay, room as advertised, hotel clean and comfortable, great breakfast, near the beach, 20 mins by car from Yalong Bay Railway Station. Hotel's English name on Didi app is Xinghua Taofang Holiday Inn (see picture).

Pros: our room (5th floor, facing the bay) was as advertised and spacious; had a nice view of the little artificial lake and a bit of the sea. Didn't try the bathtub but the shower temperature/pressure was fantastic. The hotel staff were really polite and helpful. Nice swimming pool and gym though they're not huge. Breakfast was included in our room fare and it was well worth it! Lots of choices, both from Asian and Western cuisine.

Cons: not much really, but for a room that has a fridge and little electric stove, it would have been nice to have some plates and cutlery provided. That said, they let us borrow a knife and plate from the hotel's restaurant which was nice. Personally I would not keep caged animals either (there was a bird in a small cage in the lobby).

Their breakfast too is amazing so many choices but it can get crowded so you might have to wait a bit before you get seated. The dinner there is what I couldn‚Äôt believe why don‚Äôt they have many options that was a disappointment because you are forced to eat outside everyday. We had the Mountain View it was really nice.

Our view said mountain, but it was on the second floor overlooking some construction they had going on for their driveway. Hopefully it‚Äôll be finished up before you get there. Haha.

msg:It is a nice hotel with beautiful view and territory. Good clean rooms and tasty breakfast with many options. There are basically 2 key disadvantages of this hotel. 1) no beach territory with sun beds from the hotel. 2) no warm pool. Actually guests can use facilities of the nearby hotel Hualuxe and that hotel made water of small kids pool slightly warmer but it was not warm enough, moreover it was suitable only for kids. Also they have sauna which could be used in the cold weather like was in December but the staff asked us to leave sauna and not to use it because we are from a Holiday inn hotel. So I don‚Äôt understand why we could not use it. It‚Äôs a shame for such luxury hotel to be so stingy not to warm water in the pool and not to let people use sauna.

I only got the breakfast buffet and dinner was a bowl of beef noodles and a small fruit plate. I ended up eating out or ordering in for dinner every evening. Breakfast buffet was ok though! Got a free room upgrade and ended up in a beautiful 80 m2 suite with a kitchenette and 2 bedrooms. Room was clean, tastefully furnished, bed was very comfortable, room service ladies were super nice and changed the sheets and pillow cases every day. 
Hotel is a 5 min walk to the beach! The only problem I had with the hotel was getting my damage deposit back which took over two hours of phone calls and chatting with Trip.com customer service and calling hotel staff who didn‚Äôt speak English except for John who ended up being the one helping me get my deposit back. Make sure you get your deposit before you leave or even better if you‚Äôre booking with Trip.com don‚Äôt choose the ‚Äúpay at hotel‚Äù option because you end up paying a deposit and go for the ‚Äúprepay online‚Äù option instead.

Breakfast was very good and definitely OK also for western tourists. Our ‚ÄúDeluxe Mountain-view Double Room‚Äù had an integrated small kitchen-block. Our room was close to the hotels main entrance - where it was busy and a bit noisy after 07:00 AM bec. of busses. The lake is beautiful, especially from the hotels infinity pool perspective. Next to the lake and our hotel there is currently a second hotel under construction. The hotel has a fitness-studio without sauna. Staff was friendly and helpful. All in all I can highly recommend this hotel.

The location is good - just 5 minutes from the beach by feet, there is also a shuttle bus to the beach and back every 20-30 minutes.
There is a small pool in the hotel, but who needs it when the hotel is so close to the best beach in Sanya? üòÜ
The only thing that was not very good is the hotel restaurant. The breakfast buffet variety is poor. There was no dinner buffet due to the epidemic situation and we could eat dinner a la carte, but there was only local Chinese food in the menu. Overall, the food was okay. The main thing that we didn‚Äôt like is that there was no background music playing in the restaurant - it was very quiet and we could always hear other people eating...
If you come to Yalong Bay to enjoy the sea - Shama hotel is one of the best options for this price! I hope that since the hotel is new, all the little flaws will be improved in the future üí™üèª

The hotel is clean, staff are trying to help but unfortunately they are understaffed, not very well trained.  As an English speaker family, we had a hard time to communicate with staff front desk or restaurant, most of be time using phone to translate as it seems most staff can't speak English.  The pool was ok but very small.  The breakfast was very limited and really not near the standards of a nice hotel.  We had to go eat outside which is wasn't very convenient.  I think they are so many other hotels around the area that provides better service.  Paying just a bit more is worthed if you want to enjoy the vacation or stay.   I honestly would not recommend this place to another person and never come back there again.
I had to change the room because of the construction noise.

At that time, I saw the reviews of Xinghua Suite Holiday Hotel, which had a good rating and a good price, so I booked two suites. The hotel service was very enthusiastic and upgraded the room type. The housekeeper Dongzhi Vivi was also arranged. When I came to the room, the welcome fruit on the first day was ready, and there were iced drinks in the refrigerator for daily drinking. The room is bigger than I thought, the layout is also reasonable and comfortable, the sanitary environment is good, there is a kitchen, cloakroom, living room sofa, big bed bedroom, and a separate small bedroom. The balcony is also very large. It is enough for my husband and wife to live with my children and my mother in an upgraded suite. There is no need to book two rooms. The small bedroom is also very private. So I contacted the housekeeper Dongzhi Vivi hoping to refund one room. Dongzhi Vivi made a very considerate arrangement, which finally saved me several days of room fees. The hotel not only has its own swimming pool and children's playground, but also can go to Huayu Hotel to share the cloud infinity pool and a large sun park. It is also convenient for the hotel to go to the beach. It's just across Huayu Hotel. The hotel's sheets and quilts were very dry (I stayed in a hotel on a lower floor before, and the sheets and quilts were very damp). The cleaning staff was also very considerate and helped boil water, leaving a message to remind you to drink more water in hot weather. In short, the hotel is cost-effective and the service is very good.

It is not far from the airport, the price-performance ratio is very high, it is a pure parent-child paradise, the breakfast is good, and the children are happy. This time, I was lucky enough to meet Xiaoxue, who upgraded us to a suite for free, and also gave us toys, bath sets, and fruit gifts. Every detail was perfect, so happy. I am even more determined to stay here when I come to Sanya.
When booking a room, remember to find Xiaoxue! She is super nice!

There are so many activities, very rich. Going to the beach for a few minutes, the beach has the hotel's own lounge chairs and sand digging tools for free trial. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely bring other friends and children to visit again!

The hotel's breakfast is also very good, with many styles, and the children and the elderly like it very much. I also stayed at the Yingbin Hotel on this trip, which is far worse than here. The hotel waiters are very enthusiastic. The service of the beautiful Xiazhi is even more considerate, and a little episode was solved happily. Every day, they care about the accommodation experience of the passengers, making the passengers feel very warm. In short, the hotel, from the doorman to the bar to the breakfast and the beautiful Xiazhi customer service during the stay, really gives people a feeling of being at home. I will definitely stay here next time. Recommend it to everyone, it's really good! ! !

The fact that the hotel is located a little away from the main street was a plus for us: there were few people on the beach and an additional opportunity to walk before and after lunch. The beach is nearby, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãextraordinary beauty. The hotel territory is combined with the territory of the neighboring Hualux hotel, where many activities are offered for small children and there are several swimming pools with views. We had a huge three-room suite on the 2nd floor, but even it had breathtaking views of the sea and mountains. The furniture and equipment are new and in excellent condition. Room cleaning 10/10. There is a possibility of free laundry on the ground floor. Breakfast has a huge selection of delicious dishes. Special thanks to the guide Tatyana. Speaks Russian very well. A wonderful and friendly person, always ready to help with any issue. All hotel staff were very polite and willing to solve the problem. We were fascinated. It is from such moments that the overall impression of the country and its people is formed. We would love to come back here again!

The bathroom is also very spacious. It is convenient to go up and down the stairs and take-out is convenient. There are many types of breakfast downstairs. There is a small naughty baby downstairs, who is 172 years old. The restaurant downstairs is a few steps away from the swimming pool. There are 1.4 meters for adults and shallow pools for children. There is a large playground a few steps away. The ventilation on both sides is very cool. Children can play in it for half a day. There is a super large swimming pool upstairs in the Sun City Amusement Park. You can see the sea view. It is beautiful. It takes about 7 or 8 minutes to get to the beach. It is across the road and through the coconut grove. The water quality is very good. Let me say that the hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello when they meet, and will take the initiative to ask about needs. They are polite. The hotel is equipped with two staff members at the beach. Sand dredging tools and swimming rings are free to use. They are also very enthusiastic. The overall feeling is good. The key is that there is no one on the beach during off-peak hours. The experience is good

It is very suitable for a family to come and play. Unfortunately, there are two of us. The room I booked is a suite. It is very large and it feels like it is no problem for 4 people to stay. The air conditioner is on as soon as you enter the room, which is very comfortable.

Facilities: The swimming pool of Holiday Inn is not very big, but you can go to the cloud pool of Huayu next door to play, and there are bath towels and sunscreens that can be used for free. The photos are very good, mainly the heated swimming pool, which is so lovely. You can see the sunset at night, which is very beautiful
Service: The hotel's housekeeper Xiazhi's service is very good. She is a little beauty. She greets you every day and wishes you a successful career. She gave welcome fruit and a small cake. I thought it was only given to children, but I didn't expect that she also gave me one. The cake is not worth much, but it is hard to say üâê. The hotel training should be in place, and the service is very good. It is really a caring housekeeper.
Daily mini bar drinks: The hotel gives away alcoholic beverages and mineral water every day. There is enough water to drink, and there is free coffee and tea, which you can make yourself.
Service: The hotel gave me a travel photo shoot, which I thought was a trick, but it really happened. The photographer will also ask you where you want to shoot, and you can shoot there. Make an appoin**ent in advance and choose the photos yourself. The overall service is good, and the stay is very relaxing and comfortable. The hotel has developed and is a newly opened store, and it will make a name for itself in Yalong Bay.

There are beach chairs of the hotel on the beach, but the swimming rings of the beach swimming pool need to be rented. Sand digging tools can be borrowed.

msg:I checked into the hotel for one night on the evening of May 3rd and accompanied my child to the Cloud Pool. There was no strict management on whether guests in the pool wore swimming caps. Children were not allowed to go into the 1.2m pool alone, so I accompanied them to swim for half an hour. The travel photography service informed me that the schedule on May 4th was full, and I had to wait until May 5th to have a schedule. (Do I have to wait a day and a night in the same place after checking out at noon on the 4th to enjoy the travel photography service?) I asked the front desk, and they said it was an outsourced business and they couldn't control it. I was in a hurry to schedule and didn't care about it, so I simply turned it down and didn't shoot. After dinner, I went back to the room to dry clothes and my calves were bitten by fleas. The TV remote control in the room didn't work well. I told the front desk that no staff came to repair it for an hour, and someone came after urging. I woke up in the morning of May 4th, and my left eye was red, swollen and itchy, with purulent secretions. I woke up in the morning of May 5th, and my eyes were covered with a lot of purulent secretions, my vision was blurred, and I couldn't see the time on the clock clearly. It was relieved after rinsing with clean water. Both eyes were severely red and swollen. This is my actual experience of staying in this hotel. As for the room hygiene, swimming pool water quality, service efficiency and service level, everyone can judge for themselves!

It is very friendly to a family with two children when the beds are put together. Because it is a suite, there is also a small sofa and a coffee table in one room. After the baby falls asleep at night, I can pack my luggage here, have supper, and hang clothes out of this room. It is very convenient. In fact, it is really not recommended to change hotels in Sanya. It is too troublesome to pack luggage. It is equipped with butler service. Although the previous butler was a bit inadequate, it is really responsive after changing to Xiazhi Butler. Although the hotel is not luxurious, it has everything. Breakfast is the same every day except for the variety (really not changed at all, the Danish rolls for 4 days are the same, as far as I know, there are many kinds of Danish rolls), but it also has everything it should have. It is not far from the Huayu next door from the holiday. There are 3 swimming pools and a large semi-indoor park. It will provide anti-slip toys, but when we went there, the car did not say that it was repaired. Due to time constraints, we have not experienced hotel activities and the indoor moon park. Children only need to swim and play in the water. Except that you have to call or ask the housekeeper for everything, it is generally very cost-effective.

msg:This is my second time staying at this hotel. This time I stayed in a sea view suite. There is a large balcony with a great view. All facilities and equipment are very complete and new! Free soft drinks are provided every day. There is also an indoor playground suitable for young babies. You can also use the large indoor playground next door for free. There are also free lounge chairs on the beach. The breakfast is rich. The hotel housekeeper (Xiazhi) responded promptly. Because I took an early flight this time, I was also arranged to check in early. It is a good choice for Yalong Bay. A small suggestion, it would be better if the swimming pool could provide children's swimming rings.

The room is clean and tidy, and you can see the sea from the balcony. It is not far from places to eat and go shopping. If you need to rent a car to go to the city, the housekeeper Xiaoyu is attentive and thoughtful. She will ask if there is anything you need every day. I am very satisfied! The most satisfactory thing is the travel photography provided by the hotel. Mulan travel photography is unexpectedly good!

msg:Before the trip, I was always worried about the hotel's environment. I looked at many hotels and finally decided to stay here because it is relatively new. After staying here for four days, the experience was really perfect.

A girl named Orange üçä, who is the experience ambassador of this hotel, added me on WeChat before flying to Sanya and called me to ask if I needed anything in the room in advance. During these 4 days, the service was very, very thoughtful. She would send me WeChat every day to ask me what I needed in the room and whether I needed to clean it. If I encountered any problems, I would contact her for help. Almost all of them were replied in seconds, and the efficiency was also very high. There was really nothing to complain about. Unlike some other places, the so-called private butlers, who are warm and thoughtful, reveal indifference and arrogance. Orange üçä girl makes people feel close when she speaks, perhaps because of her personal charm or because she takes her work seriously from the heart. In short, üçä is good.

The hotel is very good overall, the decoration style is very comfortable, the price is reasonable, and there are some minor flaws in the hygiene, but there is nothing to complain about. It is impossible for a hotel to be spotless. The room was a bit damp, but there was a new and very useful high-power dehumidifier, and the smell was basically completely acceptable after two or three hours.

There were free drinks in the refrigerator every day, and the refrigerator was extremely clean, without a trace of odor. This was indeed the first time I saw this.

As long as you don't hold the mentality of eating a luxurious buffet for breakfast, you will basically not be disappointed, and the food tasted at least very fresh.

I also want to say that after staying for four days and meeting many hotel staff, I really didn't meet a person with a problem with their attitude. They were just a little bit quiet, but from their expressions, it can be seen that they all took their work seriously, and they really deserved praise.

This hotel feels that except for the location and some entertainment facilities that are not as luxurious as those on the coast, if you just stay there, there is really nothing to complain about.

msg:I just checked out today, and I'm going to give a review. Overall, this hotel is really worth the price, and it's super cost-effective. I'll talk about the pros and cons in detail:
Pros:
1. The service attitude is very good, and we upgraded the room for free. The housekeeper also contacted me and added me on WeChat.
2. The hotel is new, clean and hygienic, and there are no problems such as mold and insects as mentioned on the Internet.
3. The price is cheap, which is very cheap in this area. A few hundred yuan a night is really friendly.
4. The room has an induction cooker, a range hood, and a refrigerator. There are three bottles of free drinks in the refrigerator, welcome fruits on the first day, and a balcony for drying clothes.
5. The supporting facilities are not bad. There is a small infinity pool and a children's pool downstairs. There are free swimming rings and bath towels next to the pool. A few steps away, there is a water children's playground shared with Huayu and a large indoor children's playground. It's really big. There is also a large cloud swimming pool on the third floor of Huayu, which is free to use. The children have a lot of fun.
6. It is not on the beach but not far from the sea (to be honest, those who want a first-line sea view don‚Äôt need to consider it, and the first-line sea view is not at this price). You can reach the beach by crossing the road through Huayu. The sea water is beautiful and green, and the sand is also OK and not painful. There are hotel-exclusive beach chairs on the beach. You can enjoy it by showing your room card. There are also free sand digging toys next to the beach chairs.
7. A 298 yuan hot pot set for two was given (of course not every room is given, I happened to buy it in a group at that time), which was very good. The ingredients were rich, including beef, seafood, meatballs, vegetables, fruits, coconut rice, etc. The hot pot was a choice between zaobai vinegar and coconut chicken pot. We wanted to eat zaobai vinegar but the children couldn‚Äôt eat spicy food, so the waiter was very considerate and changed it to a yuanyang pot. In the end, the family of three didn‚Äôt finish it. I feel like I made a lot of money.
Minor shortcomings:
1. There is no chair for eating and working in the room, so you can only stand to eat if you order takeout.
2. The wifi is too bad and can‚Äôt connect to the Internet. You can only use your own data to go online. It is recommended to improve it.
PS. I have recommended it to my friends and am encouraging them to stay here next time.

The characteristics of this hotel are that the rooms are spacious, clean and sanitary, and there are free fruits and drinks, which are much better than a well-known hotel in Haitang Bay. The breakfast is particularly rich, and everything you should have is available. The environment is even more beautiful and unique, with multiple swimming pools suitable for adults and children to swimüèä, and many activities at the beach. The housekeeper Xiao Lu's service is as good as always. She even remembers our past needs and preferences, and arranges the room we like in time. At the same time, she responds to our requests, so that we have a good time again. Thank you! May the hotel business prosper! All 5 points, a must!

msg:During the short holiday, the three little ones came to the hotel to play for two days. On the first day, they went straight to the Crescent Club to make Qingtuan. In the afternoon, they went to the Sun Park to make handmade drift bottles, participated in the water gun battle and bubble party, and had a full experience of activities. In the evening, we had the dregs vinegar & coconut chicken hot pot set meal given by the Hi Bowl Restaurant. The taste was great and the portion was large.
In the evening, I told the housekeeper Vivi that the next day was my parents' wedding anniversary, and the housekeeper immediately arranged for the bakery to make a cake and send it over. Later, because there were ten people passing through, the housekeeper sent another one üç∞, which was really thoughtful. The children played in the Sun Park and the small amusement park on the g floor of Xinghua for almost the whole day, and they couldn't be dragged away.
On the third day, we went to the beach early in the morning. It was a bit difficult to find the way, but it was actually relatively close. There were also hotel lounge chairs and sand digging tools on the beach.
At the end of the three-day and two-night trip, the children and old friends were very satisfied. The housekeeper Vivi responded to every request and considered us very much. I look forward to staying here next time!

I booked a two-night package which included a full meal. The overall feeling of the hotel is more like an apar**ent, a little far from the sea. Fortunately, the price is not high. The swimming pool is relatively small and suitable for children. There are many rooms, and it seems that many people are staying. However, the scenery of many rooms and corridors is very good, but it is blocked. I don't understand this design. The hardware is insufficient, but the software service is OK.

It is absolutely worry-free ~ Children We love the cloud pool so much~ The bubble party is fun, paper airplanes are very popular with boys, and the cooking class is a bit simple, but not bad~ The free hot pot set is very large, definitely enough for two adults and two snacks. It also comes with a lot of seafood, but it is sour and spicy. I hope to introduce a non-spicy taste. There are also many takeaways nearby. The travel photography was average. The guy who took the photo had a cold expression throughout the whole process. He had no auxiliary shooting equipment and the shooting was done in groups. There was a gap between it and other hotels.

The hotel is very new, the room is large enough, and there is a refrigerator and kitchen that I like; it is very close to the sea; it can share the public facilities of Hualuxe next door; and the price is very advantageous compared to those well-known old hotels. Send welcome fruits and drinks. It‚Äôs really my favorite hotel on this trip!
Service: Butler Xiaoyu's service was very attentive. Not only did he upgrade us to a double-bedroom with sea view, but he also arranged a cake for my mother. On the first day I checked in, I noticed a peculiar smell coming from the air conditioner, and the hotel promptly arranged for staff to come and fix it. The next day, housekeeper Xiaoyu also added an additional air purifier. In fact, the weather in Sanya these days is very comfortable if you don't turn on the air conditioner and open the sliding door to let in the natural breeze.
Hygiene: Very clean. I am a bit of a germaphobe and will bring my own disposable supplies, but I didn't find any unclean corners in the room.
Travel photography: The Mulan travel photography provided by the hotel was mainly for my mother to record. People her age like that. The tone, composition, action guidance and post-production are all at Sanya average level. One particularly good thing is that they won't push you to buy more, which is rare in Sanya where sales are everywhere, and even if you want to add more, it only costs 50 yuan each, which is very cost-effective.
Overall, it‚Äôs really rare to find such a cost-effective hotel in Yalong Bay!

However, Mulan Travel's photo retouching was a mess. I originally took the photo after seeing good reviews. However, some photos were not repaired and I asked for changes. The after-sales service only responded one day after the sale. After paying the money, they ignored it. Finally, it took a long time to repair and nothing was done. The first picture is the second picture before the repair. After the repair, I no longer believe in travel photography, which seriously affected my impression of the hotel.

msg:Before checking in, I searched for hotels in Yalong Bay for a long time. Because I needed to stay for a week, I finally settled on a two-bedroom suite at the Xinghua Holiday Hotel owned by InterContinental.
~The overall layout of the room is consistent with the pictures promoted on the official website. Both bedrooms are equipped with independent bathrooms. There is an outdoor balcony connected to the living room and master bedroom. The overall area is more than 120 square meters, making it very comfortable for a family of three to travel.
~Every day, the housekeeping staff will clean and replace the sheets and bathroom supplies on time. The floor of the entire house will be wet mopped, and the water and drinks in the refrigerator will be replenished. Five-star rating for cleaning.
~ On the day of check-in, the housekeeper immediately added me on WeChat. Every day, the housekeeper Doris would ask about the housing situation and any special needs. She was very considerate and warm. During this period, I also helped arrange a coconut chicken hot pot set meal for the restaurant, which tasted very good.
~Finally, let me talk about the breakfast. The variety is very complete, the ingredients are fresh, and the taste is good. The most popular item every day is the freshly made pancakes. The only drawback is that there are too many people at breakfast and sometimes you have to wait for a table. In the next few days, we went to eat before 9 o'clock, and the crowds were relatively small.
~I would like to focus on the 10 photos taken by Mulan Family Travel that were included when booking the hotel. I didn‚Äôt have high expectations at first, so I took a set of photos myself first, and when I was waiting for the photos, I actually selected 12 more photos (additional fee) . The director of photography, "Shangguan", has high photography skills, fast efficiency, and is very good at interacting with customers. It only took half an hour to complete the shooting, so that I made an appoin**ent for another family shoot the next day. In the end, I was reluctant to delete every photo. I discussed with the beautiful customer service and bought all 40 photos at a package price. The overall cost-effectiveness is very high, and the brand of Mulan Travel Photography is trustworthy. Guests staying in Xinghua and Hualuxe in the future can choose with confidence.
~As a Ctrip Golden Diamond user, this is the first time I have written so many reviews. This trip was very satisfactory. I hope Ctrip can continue to carefully select high-quality travel plans for all of us~

1‚É£Ô∏èWhen checking in, if there is a room available, the front desk staff will help upgrade the sea view room type. Thank you to the front desk guy.
2‚É£Ô∏èThe suite comes with its own refrigerator and induction cooker, which is very friendly to families with children. The independent enclosed bathroom is also very convenient for parents to use together. The balcony of the sea view room is very large, which also makes it convenient for me to be lazy and not have to take care of the baby, so I can enjoy the pure moment on the balcony üòÇ
3‚É£Ô∏èSuite Holidays and the newly opened Hualuxe Hotel in 2023 are in the same park, both belonging to the Intercontinental. The shared outdoor cloud swimming pool, playground, parent-child restaurant, especially the playground has a soft rubber surface and is very safe. The Yunduo Swimming Pool is also a special feature. The water surface is divided into high, medium and low areas, which is suitable for babies of different ages and heights. There are also many details in the hotel that focus on babies themselves, making it a proper parent-child resort hotel.
4‚É£Ô∏èThe suite package booked comes with breakfast for three adults, and breakfast is available until 11 a.m.. Many hotels only include two.
 The staff at the breakfast restaurant are greeted at the door. The fat guy wearing glasses is very nice. During my five-day stay, I saw the guy being enthusiastic and polite to help everyone every day.
5‚É£Ô∏èThe hotel is within walking distance to the beach
6‚É£Ô∏èHotel cooperation for travel photography is also very good, you can choose according to your needs

Based on the overall stay experience, the suite vacation is very cost-effective. Thanks again to the housekeeper Miss Xia Zhi and the hotel staff

The children's playground in the hotel is super huge, and there is also a bubble pool and slide specially prepared for little ones. Although we are traveling with the elderly this time, we still have fun watching the children play. Although this hotel It's not right next to the beach, but the hotel's exclusive rest chairs are also provided on the beach. The staff are also very attentive. When every guest comes, they sweep the chairs with a small broom and move them to a suitable position under the umbrella for guests to rest. It's very considerate! We are three elderly people this time. We booked a three-person suite with a view of the sea. My uncle, father, and uncle can live together. We are very happy to chat and drink tea together.

This time I took my parents and children to travel. Because we landed in the middle of the night, I originally thought about booking a cheaper hotel. After actually checking in, I found that it was better than I imagined. My parents kept praising it. It is really cost-effective. After booking the hotel The hotel housekeeper will contact you (Xiaozhi) and the service is very good. I will continue to bring my parents here next time. Not only the children also think it is very good. I have a baby to hold when I sleep at night. I hope it will continue. I am very satisfied.

There is a clothes drying rack on the balcony suitable for washing and drying. Shower sanitary ware are all from Gaoyi. The large bottle of hand, hair, and body wash is both environmentally friendly and exquisite.
The breakfast was rich and delicious, and the hot pot dinner included in the set meal was also delicious and three people were full.
Special thanks to Xia Zhi for your care and assistance throughout the whole process, especially for contacting me before checking in and asking carefully about my requirements. After learning that my family had a birthday, they arranged a great room layout and an awesome cake, which made my family very happy.

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities and is quite new. The room is a sea view suite, which is really large in size, with a large bed and a small bed in the room. The hotel swimming pool is convenient. When adults are tired in the evening, they can take their children to the children's playground to discharge their energy. This is the right way to start a vacation!

Service: The service of the cute butler Xia Zhi is very considerate. She arranged the room and arranged parent-child supplies in advance. She responded quickly to everything she asked for. I am really happy! It added a lot of points to this trip

The butler Xia Zhi contacted us one day in advance to inquire about our needs and arrange the room and necessary items. The butler service was very good. Attentive and all-inclusive, the week-long service made us feel very attentive, proactive and very comfortable. The concierge at the door was very timely when we checked in, and the room service and cleaning were also very meticulous.
The breakfast is very good. The hotel room is an 80-square-meter suite with one bedroom, one living room, one kitchen, one bathroom, and a large balcony. Everything the baby needs can be borrowed. The large refrigerator and kitchen solve the problem of eating for the baby. The welcome fruits and the fruit and vegetable gift packs in the set meal are very thoughtful.
The public resources of the hotel and Hualuxe next door. The children's playground, swimming pool and gym are basically used by the Hualuxe Hotel. Children's activities are also operated by a professional team. The hotel is very new in Yalong Bay, very clean and safe.

Environment: I think it's very quiet and the scenery is beautiful. I sit on the terrace every morning and enjoy the scenery while having breakfast. It's also very close to the beach, less than ten minutes' walk. The hotel also has a battery car that can take you to the beach.
Service: The housekeeper is really responsible. My housekeeper is Xia Zhi. In addition to contacting us before check-in, she also asks us on WeChat every day how we are resting. Any questions and needs are dealt with in a timely manner. She is a very enthusiastic and cheerful little girl. In addition, check-in and check-out are very fast, and I don‚Äôt have to wait in the lobby.

In addition, Xinghua Suite guests can also share HUALUXE's facilities, such as Sun Paradise, Crescent Club, and Cloud Swimming Pool, and can also participate in activities, which is really nice. It's only a five- to six-minute walk from the beach. There's a Baihua Valley shopping mall nearby, which is also very convenient for eating.
Xinghua has its own small swimming pool, including a foot washing and disinfection pool, a children's pool and an adult pool. Although it is not big, it is close and convenient for swimming. The lifeguard Leo is very responsible. One afternoon, my 3-year-old child was in the children's pool (30cm). When I was playing in the deep water, someone accidentally rolled over the lifebuoy, I immediately jumped in and rescued the child. My reaction was so fast that I didn‚Äôt even react. A family member who was playing with me in the water didn‚Äôt even react. It was really amazing. thank him!
However, we also encountered some minor problems, such as the toilet paper towels not being replenished in time, but they were resolved quickly with quick response. I will consider staying here again next time!

msg:First of all, I would like to state that the customer service lady has a very good attitude and handles the matter quickly. Some of the feedback that follows are questions and some are suggestions.
1. I have already paid a deposit of more than 400 yuan on Ctrip, but the front desk refused to recognize it and said that the money is not as high as yours, so I have to pay another 1,500 yuan deposit. First of all, the deposit is not given to you. You are on the Ctrip platform. The deposit is originally held by a third party. If you don‚Äôt recognize Ctrip‚Äôs deposit, why are you doing Ctrip. How do guests feel when they are asked to pay two deposits?
2. The air conditioner in the master bedroom was broken, and it was not repaired. It could not cool down after running it for several hours, so I finally changed rooms, but you must fix the facilities.
3. While taking a nap, my aunt wanted to come in to clean the room, but she said no. But when you come in to change water or something, you still need permission. You can come in as soon as you say it. This is a big problem. I almost fell asleep and was woken up. Where is the main privacy protection?
4. Isn't there a glass partition in the toilet? The space for going to the toilet is really small, and the glass is not obvious, and I hit my head. This is the first room type, and the sea view room is okay.
5. At the beginning, the hair dryer in this room type is really not good. It is long and has to be pressed all the time, and the wind is not strong.

I would like to praise vivi Winter Solstice for its good service. After booking the hotel, the customer service contacted me in advance and added me on WeChat. It was very convenient to communicate with me if I had anything to do.

The children were very happy! My brother was a little acclimated and vomited twice. The housekeeper Xin Yi was very considerate. After arranging the cleaning, he asked the restaurant to send porridge to him. It was so heartwarming!

The parent-child hotel has all the child-related services in place. Because it is the same hotel as the HUALUXE Hotel next to it, you can share the children's playground and swimming pool. You can have fun for five days without leaving home, especially on rainy days, the children don't have to stay indoors. In the room, it was simply not too pleasant.

It is a new hotel and the price/performance ratio is definitely No. 1 in Yalong Bay.

A fat girl served us throughout the whole process, mixing water for us and explaining how to eat it. We would like to thank the girl for her considerate service! The barbecue ordered for dinner (tasted well) was delivered to the room by the restaurant staff, and the cake was also given as a gift (a six-inch birthday cake, it looked like it was made by the hotel itself. It tasted very good and was not greasy) and was paired with the hotel's complimentary drinks (2 Coconut juice, coke, beer for one person), it was a real enjoyment.

Hotel front desk reception: Thanks to HUALUXE Ambassador Rosie. I didn‚Äôt like the room I originally booked. Then I got to know HUALUXE Ambassador Rosie. After telling her that I didn‚Äôt like this room type, the lady decisively upgraded her to an open-plan room for free. Wow. , thank you so much, the room I changed is so beautiful, I love it so much. I stayed at the Mangrove Hotel in Yalong Bay in 2020. In addition to the large environment, the Mangrove Hotel is much worse than the Holiday Inn in terms of service. I would also like to thank Miss Jasmine at the front desk and other young brothers and sisters. Whenever they meet the guests, they always smile and say hello. Dear friends, think about that feeling. The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, and with this greeting, My heart is drunk. Hygiene: Thanks to the aunt who cleans the house on the ninth floor. As soon as I entered the hotel room on the first day, I saw a gift of washed fruit. It felt like home! The room is kept spotless every day. I am very particular about hygiene and very picky. I feel comfortable when I enter the room every day. Knowing that we love to drink water, I give you a few more bottles of water every day. Thank you, thank you! In terms of environment: the overall environment is quiet and elegant, especially when walking in the hotel at night, it allows people to calm down and think about life and imagine the future! The man who was guarding the swimming pool was very nice. He gave us various reminders and even provided us with water guns to play with. The children had a great time! It's not far from the beach, just a five- to six-minute walk. There are many treasures on the beach. It's not far from Baihua Valley. A taxi only costs 7 yuan and it only takes more than 20 minutes to walk. We took a taxi and walked back. The scenery along the way was beautiful. There weren't many cars, so it was very pleasant to walk and take a walk! I like Sanya because of the beautiful sea and the warm and hospitable Sanya people. I love you! Next time I go there for the third time, I will also visit the Holiday Inn!

In addition to the big bed, there was also a small room in the room. The bed, a fruit plate was given on the first night, and the drinks in the refrigerator were replenished every day. This was very good. There were ropes in the bathroom for drying clothes, and a balcony for blowing the air. The scenery was facing the deserted hotel and mountains behind, but there was no sea view. Viewing the mountains is also very eye-friendly. There are racks on the balcony to dry clothes, as well as a laundry room and a children's playground ocean ball. There is no mold in the room. The breakfast is both Western and Chinese. However, on the first day I checked in, I found small bugs on the bed. Fortunately, there will be no more in the next few days. The hotel has a shuttle bus to Yalong Bay Beach. It is convenient to walk and is only 2 streets away. The hair dryer needs to be manually pressed and pressed all the time, which is inconvenient. The mini hair dryer is better than this one, and the socket is more difficult. It takes a lot of effort to plug it in. There are two waiters at the hotel entrance who will help open the door and carry the luggage into the car. This is good.

Book a superior room and get a free upgrade to a suite: Speaking of room upgrades, I was lucky enough to have Alia accommodate me. After seeing our honeymoon trip, we arranged a free upgrade to the suite. 80 square meters, open kitchen, refrigerator, pots and pans are all equipped. They also sent us to the room and introduced us to the surrounding areas and delicious food along the way. Introduce the placement and use of items in the room. Thank you so much to my butlerüòò
Free drinks in the minibar on the first day: There are a lot of drinks in the refrigerator, and they are free. I told the housekeeper Alia that the coconut juice is delicious. When I came back from going out, I saw a few bottles refilled for me, which was so heart-warming. Because of this excellent service, I stayed a few more nights and didn‚Äôt want to change hotels! Thank you Alia for such a good stay experience. I will definitely choose a suite holiday when visiting Sanya in the future!

When staying in a parent-child suite, there is a small tent, a wooden horse, a toy bucket, a frog doll and a sand bucket, so the children can have fun in the room. It shares the swimming pool and children's playground with Hualuxe next door. There are many parent-child activities. Children can also have water fights at the bubble party in the swimming pool in the evening. The housekeeper Alia was very nice. She was very enthusiastic in communicating in advance and arranging the check-in. On the night of check-in, she also gave us a delicious cake made by the hotel. The hotel's Hi Bowl restaurant offers a variety of set meals with excellent value for money.
The only regret is that the hotel is not close to the sea and it is a bit far to go to the sea, otherwise it would be perfect.

This one is the one I am most satisfied with. I thought that a hotel with a higher price would be better, but I didn‚Äôt expect that the hotel would be better. The Holiday Inn Hua Suites is a treasure hotel. When the boy at the front desk saw his child, he helped him upgrade his room. The housekeeper Si Ting (Xinyi Tia) was very considerate and heart-warming. She gave the baby a decent gift when they first met and also introduced her. The hotel's environment and services in all aspects, I will stay in this hotel next time I go to Sanya

The room is clean, and you can borrow toys such as building blocks, tents, rocking horses, booster stools, small toilets, and children's toiletries. The children love the frog dolls and sand digging tools provided.
It shares a children's club with the neighboring Hualuxe Resort Hotel. There are many activities for children, and there are small kitchen activities every day to cook delicious food. Sunland is very big, but its shortcoming is that some areas have not been repaired and rock climbing is not possible. The children's water slide is also being overhauled.
The Yunduo swimming pool is super beautiful, and there is also a circular heated swimming pool that is especially suitable for children. Because it rained all day due to a typhoon, the bubble show was held as usual after the rain stopped at around 5 o'clock. The children were very happy. Swimming armbands are available for free loan. The hotel's own small swimming pool is also very exquisite, and the lifeguards next to it are very enthusiastic. The disadvantage is that there are a lot of mosquitoes, so you need to spray mosquito repellent in advance.
Fruit cake was also delivered the next day, which was especially fresh and delicious.
The breakfast is quite rich, with both Chinese and Western options, and is very friendly until 11 o'clock.
Hi Bowl Restaurant is very affordable, with BBQ for 118 for two people, dregs and vinegar hotpot for 268 for two people, and Haikou Yi Noodle Soup for 28. You can go here if you don‚Äôt know what to eat, and the taste is pretty good.

We were supposed to check in after 3 o'clock, but we saw that we Priority will be given to the first available room. Because it was a little noisy facing the road on the first night, after reporting the situation, the housekeeper Aliya helped us change to a lake view room. The view was great and quiet. They also gave us free travel photography. Thank you so much! During our stay, we were always greeted with warm regards and we were very serious and proactive in our work. We cooked our own meals, and the kitchen lent us tableware and pots. This seems to be the only hotel in this area that can do that. All the staff are very friendly and greet people anytime and anywhere. Because there are too many things to move into the room, the handsome guy Zijin has been helping to move them, and there is also the handsome guy who cleaned the room at noon on the 18th (I forgot to see his work ID, I don‚Äôt know) What‚Äôs his name?) When he saw that we had a baby, he gave us sand digging toys and potato chips. The baby was very happy!
The hotel is also very close to the beach. It only takes a few minutes to get there. There are also free beach buggies. Basically, you can sit and go. You can also go to the beach (it feels more beautiful there) by walking out from the Huayuxe gate next door. Baihuagu Commercial Street is about 10 minutes away.
The most important point is that it is very suitable for families with children. Huayi has a large indoor children's paradise, which is not afraid of heavy rains and typhoons. There is also a children's bubble bath. There is also a children's paradise here. Because it is a group, it is entertainment The facilities are shared between the two hotels. I feel like it would be very relaxing even if I bring my baby alone. We will choose this hotel next time we come to Sanya

Environment: The environment is beautiful and quiet, and the mountain view from the room is also beautiful
Service: Rosie, the Hualuxe Ambassador, will answer any questions in a timely manner. The service is very considerate. She contacted me in advance. Knowing that we are two adults and two children, we arranged a room with a king bed + a queen bed. The stay was very comfortable and we were upgraded to a mountain. The view room is beautiful and quiet, especially suitable for family members who sleep lightly.
Facilities: The hotel is very new. In Yalong Bay, the experience is much better than those old hotels.
Hygiene: Hygienic conditions are very good, not damp at all
Seasonal welcome fruits: Welcome fruits are prepared when you check in, which is a good feeling
Enjoy daily minibar drinks: replenished every day, very timely
When coming to Yalong Bay, Holiday Inn is your first choice.

We encountered a small situation, and Miss Doris patiently helped us deal with it, and then she was very concerned about the situation. I was really touched. Because of Sister Jingjing, my experience of suite holidays has been enhanced.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. The rooms are large and there are separate children‚Äôs rooms and beds. If you bring children, you will definitely have a great stay.
The breakfast lady surprised me because I came from Marriott in Sanya. After all, there was a gap in star rating and price. I didn‚Äôt have high hopes, but I didn‚Äôt expect the variety and quality to be as good as Marriott...! Skimmed milk is so friendly to someone like me who is lactose intolerant...!
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the problem
One is that the location is remote. It is recommended to rent a car and live here. It will be much more convenient.
Another is that a large area has not yet been constructed, and we hope it will be completed as soon as possible.
Also, I read that it says it will open in 2021, but it was actually bought by Intercontinental from the previous owner. Most of the decorations are old, but they are well maintained...!
Overall it's great, and it's even better with Miss Doris...!

I was worried that the actual hotel in Sanya would not match the pictures, but I didn‚Äôt expect Xinghua to be so good. The room was very clean, the hotel has a beautiful infinity pool, and the breakfast was so rich. I haven‚Äôt had it yet. Before we arrived in Sanya, the housekeeper called us when we would arrive and asked us if we had any customary requirements. They were very considerate. Especially the housekeeper Zhang Lili knew that my parents and I were here. In addition to the two buffets in the package, they also gave me free meals. I got an extra one and two extras after staying for two nights. It was really considerate. Although the sudden power outage due to municipal maintenance had nothing to do with the hotel, the hotel upgraded our mountain view suite to a sea view suite. It was really nice. It was a wonderful experience. My parents were very happy and said they would bring their sisters to stay here again next time! By the way, the hotel is very close to the beach. If you don‚Äôt want to walk, there is a shuttle bus to take you there, which is very convenient. It is also very convenient around the hotel and you can order takeout and call a taxi very quickly!

Fortunately, the hotel environment is beautiful and the room is comfortable. The balcony of the suite faces the mountain and has good light. It is also very convenient to walk to the beach, and it is also close to Baihua Valley for eating. It is good to take a walk to consume some energy.
The brunch buffet was great and I loved it, lots of variety. The swimming pool is not big but clean. The gym facilities are a little lacking and there are not enough mirrors. I hope this can be improved.
The attitude of the waiters was very good. In short, it was a small blessing for me to be on the road.
Doris Jingjing's customer service is very good and considerate. Thank you for her thoughtfulness.

Ctrip can also apply for a late check-out at 2:00, because the children have to take a lunch break, and please ask the front desk to apply for a late check-out until 2:30.

msg:Arrived at Sanya Xinghua Suites Holiday Hotel after 5 o'clock, and waited for a while to check in due to system problems. My little brother upgraded us to a big suite for free, happy! This hotel is very new, it has only been open for more than a year, and it was acquired by the InterContinental Group. It is very similar to the InterContinental Haikou Huacai Hotel where we stayed the night before. Although the service is not as good as that, it is not far from the beach. It takes a few minutes to walk. We don‚Äôt need to drive. Living too close to the sea, the basic four-digit number near the sea, the room is not that good. Had dinner at the hotel, there is a set meal, which is not bad, rest at the hotel at night, play in the parent-child playground, if you bring your baby, you must book a hotel with a children's playground. There are some courses to play in, the room is 80 square meters, two rooms, one 1.8 beds, and the other small room, the children like it too much, one person sleeps 1.2 beds, half mountain, half lake and half sea view outside the window, it is still necessary to bring two children Book two beds that are comfortable and not crowded. The hotel has children's tents and wooden horses that can be borrowed free of charge. The waiter delivered them quickly. The two children ran around the room without looking at them, freeing themselves, which is great! Booked for three nights in a row. Overall good! Clean and hygienic, comfortable!

msg:A hotel that my family likes very much. We stayed for four nights in total. When choosing a hotel, I almost wrote down the names of the surrounding hotel groups. There are three main points for choosing a suite holiday.

First: suites, hotels for family outings, the area is not less than 60 square meters, and it will be comfortable to live in. In addition to two 1.5-meter beds in the living room, the family room also has a single room, which is suitable for the elderly with average sleep quality, or junior high school students. This trip to the Holiday Inn just met my family's needs for this trip, and I brought the elderly and the new junior boy.

Second: The new hotels just opened last year. Most of the luxury hotels in Yalong Bay have a sense of age. If you take your family to visit Sanya for the second time, you need to change the environment so that you can have a fresh experience.

Third: There is a laundry room. We choose this season to come to Sanya from the north.
I really can't wait to change 2 clothes a day. The free laundry is very good. The laundry room is basically empty during breakfast time and after 6 pm. You can go there during these two times.

We stayed for four nights and extended our stay for one day. Dined in the restaurant three times, the dross vinegar hot pot is delicious, and you can get a 30 yuan coupon, 238 for three people to eat a meal is a good deal. The breakfast is rich in variety. My favorite is to cook a bowl of hot Baoluo powder every morning. My mother likes all kinds of pickled fruits and salads, and my child likes the combination of Chinese and Western. By the way, the eggs for breakfast are from Sundel, the quality is very good.

Talking about other feelings, Holiday Inn is a very warm company, from check-in to restaurants and service personnel. It can be said that wherever you go, you are greeted with a smiling face. For tourists, this is very important. We are renting a car and traveling by car, and it is very convenient to park underground. Already recommended friends to come and live here.

They are very responsible. There are also many children's playgrounds, suitable for families with children. It's a 7-8 minute walk from the beach can be reached. Although the hotel is not the best in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYalong Bay, it is definitely the highest price-value ratio. The service is very good. This time I stayed in 4 hotels in Sanya. Xinghua's service is the best, and the hotel's meals are also very generous. The 268 hot pot set meal for two people is enough for a family, two snacks, and the buffet breakfast can Serving from 7:00 to 11:00, it is as warm as home. The next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at your house [Âº∫] Your house, and two more friends want to come to Sanya soon, highly recommended

Especially Betty from the hotel relations depar**ent, who provided us with excellent accommodation suggestions, and also offered a lot of benefits for the children, thank you very much.

I was surprised by the free small hot pot for two people. The dishes are so fresh and the price is not expensive! The original plan was to stay for two or three days and change to Haitang Bay, but we prefer to play on the beach and scenic spots outside, so staying at Xinghua is a good choice. The hotel is not far from the beach on foot. I look forward to the opening of the new hotel, so that it will be more convenient to go to the sea. I rented a car for this trip, so it's really good to live here to eat and play. Will still choose next time. I forgot to take photos of the hotel, there is an error with the pictures attached by the merchant! Clean and simple! Hope to keep it!

We are 4 adults and 2 children (one is 7 years old and the other is 13 years old). We booked 2 sets of parent-child suites for 2 nights. Since one room only provides 2 free breakfasts, Xiaohan took the initiative to apply for a 2-day free breakfast coupon when checking in. To the kids, fried chicken thanks üòò

Vivi left a deep impression on me, her service is super nice, 360¬∞C has no dead ends, it can be described as responsiveüëç

There are many types of breakfast buffet, the ingredients are very fresh, and the service attitude is superb. The parent-child suite is very large, you can take a bubble bath in the bathtub, the baby's toiletries are complete, and different play programs are arranged for the children every day. This package is very cost-effective. Each room comes with an afternoon tea, parent-child dinner (Chinese and Western options are available, sailing experience coupons for 2 people, one travel photo, welcome fruit (2üçé2üçä), drinks in the refrigerator (Qingdao Beer, Wahaha, mineral water, coconut milk, a can of Coke each), snacks (a bag of potato chips), one serving per day, all of which are provided for free. I dare say this is absolutely impossible for a five-star hotel in Yalong Bay of.

The hotel has 2 swimming pools, a doll pool and an adult infinity pool. Free use of life buoys and armbands. The 2 babies soak in it every day and have a great time. They play until it closes at 22 o'clock in the eveningüòã

Amway friends, it is said that the hotel will open a new sea view room at the end of September, next time you come to Sanya, you must come and experience it‚úä

Needless to say, the breakfast in the hotel is more satisfying to me. The variety is super rich, including Chinese and Western styles. The dining time is from 8 to 11 o'clock. Many guests save their lunch. Every morning, there will be waiters in the restaurant to help you find a seat and arrange you to sit. Full of happiness.

As shown in the picture, the sheets and pillowcases have yellow or black marks. At first, I asked the hotel to help change it before I went out. After I came back, I still found that it was the same. Then I went to the guest room to change it. At first, I said that he changed it (I don‚Äôt deny that they did it). I asked if I could help me change it. This is true. It gave a very bad experience. After arguing for 10 to 20 minutes, he was not willing to change it at first, saying that he had already changed it, and felt that we were making trouble for him. The previous room cleaning was much better), after some explanations, Lena and the room cleaning started to change the sheets together, and brought over a pile of sheets and quilt covers, half of which had problems. This is the first time this has happened! In the end it took about an hour to change the sheets (already around 11:10pm). The next day I delivered a fruit and pastry. At the beginning, the hotel said it would give feedback. I hope they can do better in the future. Otherwise, no matter how cheap it is, I may not be willing to stay in the future! ! ! The only 2 stars are for Lena, if it wasn't for her service, probably wouldn't even give them 2 stars

Breakfast: very rich. It is richer than the previous two days, and it is similar to the Sanya Bay holiday.
Seasonal welcome fruits: As shown in the picture, besides fruits, there are also biscuits and cakes, making you feel at home.
Enjoy daily minibar drinks: Coke, Sprite, Coconut Juice and Beer
Tickets for sailing experience: The price on the beach is 280/person, this gift is for two people! It takes 10 minutes to sail, but it is very comfortable, the waves are big, and the sail is very stable. You need to take the hotel voucher to go to the beach service desk to change the bracelet first, and pay an additional 10 yuan per person for the insurance fee.
Facilities: The hardware of the new hotel is good! Now start complaining: bug1: To go to the G floor, you have to go to the lobby on the 1st floor to transfer. bug2: The hair dryer is very difficult to use, whoever uses it will know, it is very anti-human, this time I stayed in 4 hotels, I can remember this hair dryer for a lifetime. bug3: Free laundry room, as a result, I spent more time than washing and drying myself. Many people don't know how to set it up. It takes more than 3 hours to wash once, and I have gone to it countless times, with half the effort. I used the wash+dry mode, and it was wet after drying.

advantage:
üëçüëçüëçI booked an open mountain view room this time. The room is very large. It may be a seaside city. When you open the door, there is a tidal smell. The perfume is better. The room is very clean and the hotel service is very good. The restaurant is Chenli Island The service is very attentive, and the children are very happy to eat. There are not many styles of buffet breakfast, and Hainanese yellow lantern chili sauce with Hainanese noodles is a must for every day.
shortcoming:
One thing I complain about is whether the hair dryer can be replaced. The old-fashioned hair dryer has to be pressed with your fingers to blow it. Every time I blow my hair, I want to get angry. I asked the front desk and said it was for fire protection. Don‚Äôt other hotels not have fire protection?
Yalong Bay water project:
üëéüëéüëé This deep-breathing diving site recommended by Ctrip's guide is very poor. The coach keeps promoting it, and brings the children over. If the children can't take the video, they have to sell it to the adults. Everyone in the family of three has to take pictures. My attitude immediately changed, and I kept talking coldly and violently. I thought that the recommendation from Ctrip was better, but the result was not good, which made me have a bad impression of Sanya.

Turn right out of the hotel and walk a short distance to the public beach. It is not far away and is suitable for walking after meals. The quality of the beach is average, and bare feet are a bit prickly. Because it is public and close to Yalong Bay Underwater World, there are more people and the beach environment is average.

What is the difference between having an air conditioner and not having it installed? I asked the front desk and replied that this is indeed the case; at the same time, the switch of the hair dryer needs to be pressed hard all the time, which is too tiring; there is also a socket, the charger needs a lot of effort to plug in, how did the socket be installed in the first place Yes, I don‚Äôt understand either. I sincerely hope that the hotel can improve these deficiencies, especially in terms of sanitation. The most important thing for guests to stay in a hotel is the sanitation.

The hotel gives you everything, free room upgrades, free dinner for two and an upgraded seafood buffet, 8 bottles of water every day, and a 700-meter private car pick-up and drop-off to the beach on call, although it only takes seven or eight minutes to walk.

Sea activities are 40% off, and more than 400 played six or seven projects.

1. The hotel is not big, unlike the Sheraton I stayed in before, it has rich gardens and landscapes, but at this price, the facilities and the service are already very good, and the exquisiteness is better than anything else.

It's just a bit far away from the beach, but there is a sightseeing bus to take it to the hotel every day ~ the hotel breakfast is very rich, and the view is very good! There is a Qingbuliang for takeaway from the hotel, it is so delicious! It is called "Yuchun authentic clearing and nourishing coolness"! I have eaten at many restaurants in Sanya, and this one is my favorite! It costs about 70 yuan to take a taxi to Wuzhizhou Island at 7 o'clock in the morning. The hotel also helped prepare breakfast bread in advance, which is very good~

msg:This stay exceeded expectations, because the price is relatively moderate, so I didn't come here with high hopes. After checking in, it really gave me a big surprise. When I arrived at the store, the concierge brother would help me carry my luggage and take me to check in. The whole check-in process was also very fast. Ms. Lena at the front desk is very professional. I tell my check-in needs and I can get a response right away. Seeing that I took the children and gave me a sand digging tool as a gift, the children were clamoring to buy it, but now it is finally safe. Every time I pass by the front desk, I greet my children. The cleanliness of the bathroom makes it impossible for me, a person with a serious cleanliness, to find out what's wrong, which is very good. The hotel is also equipped with a children's playground, gym, swimming pool, and restaurant. I feel that I have come to the right place, which is all I need. By the way, the hotel also has a 24-hour self-service laundry room, which is very considerate. The breakfast time until 11 o'clock is also very heartwarming. After breakfast, I went to the park to take a breath of fresh air and then took the children to the children's playground. It was very comfortable. I hope to meet Miss Lena again as soon as possible next time, the children like her very much~

When I checked in, I told Wei Wei about my overall needs and the experience I wanted for my stay. He listened to me patiently and then helped me choose the right room for me. This is very commendable. After check-in, I was invited to add the WeChat account of Yingying, the holiday service ambassador. During the stay, they would ask me about my cleaning time and itinerary. In a place I am not familiar with, it is very reassuring to have a familiar person help me arrange the itinerary. Every time I pass by the front desk and see Wei Wei, he smiles at me and greets me. I am very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room. As soon as I opened the door, there was a breath of sunshine, which was very comfortable. The corners of the room were also cleaned very well. I checked in directly at the hotel at 3:00 pm without waiting. The hotel is on the mountainside of Yalong Bay, the environment is very clear, the taste of nature. The facilities and equipment are also very well preserved, basically all the facilities and equipment I can see are new! It's very good, the price/performance ratio is great, please look for Xinghua Holiday in the future, it will make your trip worthwhile!

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the hotel they‚Äôre about to open. It‚Äôs too noisy since 7 o‚Äôclock. They all woke up early to have their breakfast. The environment surrounded by mountains and rivers eased the mood of being woken up in the morning. When checking out, the staff in the lobby kindly asked about the check-in status and the destination of the next stop, and gave suggestions for the parade! If it weren't for the noisy construction site, I wouldn't want to change hotels!

msg:Grabbing the little tail of the child's pre-school holiday, I took the child and family on a trip. Compared with several hotels in Bialong Bay, I finally chose the holiday, which really lived up to expectations. Although it has not been open for a long time, the service, facilities and equipment, environment, and sanitation have all touched my heart. I am so satisfied! ! Let me talk about the service first. Before I checked in, I called the hotel to tell me that I had special circumstances with children and elderly people with handicapped legs. The front desk told me that they would help me arrange check-in as soon as possible. After arriving at the hotel around 15:00 and checking in quickly and conveniently, Ms. Huang Li saw that our luggage was scattered and took the initiative to help me with it. I was only responsible for bringing the children. Because children and the elderly have a relatively large demand for items in the room, as long as you contact Yingying on WeChat, the items will be delivered to the room soon, which is very considerate. I also like the facilities and equipment very much. There is an open kitchen as soon as you enter the room. There is a large refrigerator and an induction cooker to cook some noodles for the children. The layout of the bathroom is also very home-like. The environment is also very comfortable. After having breakfast in the breakfast room, you can take a walk in the park. The sun is very comfortable on your body, and the air in the park is very, very good. I am also very satisfied with the cleanliness of the room. When I checked in, I told the front desk guy that I needed the children‚Äôs toiletries. When I got back to the room, I saw the children‚Äôs bathrobes and slippers. The bedding and bathroom in the room were very clean , very standard of service holiday! The bedding is very comfortable and relieves fatigue. If I have a chance to come to Sanya next time, I don't even think about entering this hotel without thinking! nice~

msg:The resort hotel under the IHG group is next to the Cactus Hotel. It has not been newly renovated for a long time and is operated by the team of If. Overall, I like it very much, a remarkable experience
The room is big enough. The mountain view suite I booked actually has an extra children's room, which is very suitable for a family üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß to travel. I like the bedding as always.
There is an induction cooker and a smoker in the dining bar area at the entrance, and MS can cook without a pot, but it probably won‚Äôt be too strange to really cook by yourself when you come here. The fridge is huge. On the contrary, this area feels particularly suitable for a long stay.
The cloakroom area is also very large, and there are bathrobes for children
The bathroom is very good, with a large space, a strong water flow, and a good temperature. It's absolutely amazing, but I didn't see a ventilation fan. It said it was automatic, but I couldn't find it
The balcony is very big. I prefer the mountain view. It‚Äôs not noisy at night, and I can see the lights of the hotel on the mountain.
Because it is a set plan, breakfast and dinner are included. To be honest, the quality of the holiday breakfast is always online, and the dinner is a hot pot buffet. This price is definitely worth it. I also saw that some people did not comment highly. I especially want to say that the standard of 10,000 yuan for consumption of 100 yuan is a bit hypocritical.
Thanks to Tang (MS) who received the check-in and provided me with ice cubes. Every friend here is very patient, and the restaurant is also the same. He took the initiative to help guests find seats with this and that, which is quite üëç!

msg:My first impression was that the sanitation was very good. They were cleaned every day. On the third day, the cleaning staff Zhang Qing was a little girl who cleaned very carefully. The other cleaning staff were also very responsible. They changed the bath towels and towels. The quilt was clean and fresh Yes, the staff here are very enthusiastic and patient. You can borrow pots and utensils. If you can‚Äôt eat, you can use the kitchen stove to cook it. If you need a microwave, the restaurant downstairs can help you heat it. There is a free laundry room. This is really good. It's a big praise. On the first day we came to Sanya from Tianjin, the wind was very strong. The child wanted to go to the beach, so he didn't change his clothes. He went directly in fleece pants. The child couldn't help but walk to the beach. The wind, the sea, and the waves were also strong. As a result, the pants were soaked, and I was worried that there would be no thick clothes to wear when I returned to Tianjin. As a result, there is a fully automatic washing machine, which integrates washing and drying. Students in the north, if you need it, this hotel is really good. Before I went, I visited many hotels. They are all paid for laundry. Friends who need this, these two hotels are definitely worth it. Of course, you can wash your personal clothes by hand, so don‚Äôt worry. The infinity swimming pool is also good, but there is a building, so I chose an open-plan mountain view room, which is on the shade side, and the sun can't come in, but I go out during the day, so I don't think much about it. There is a balcony, and I can wash my underwear. Hanging, in short, the hygiene is very good, and the service is also very good. In the end, we ate Hey Guo twice. How should I put it, I think it is cost-effective, and it is better than the thousands of seafood around. There is also a naughty castle, which is also very clean.

A few highlights: 1. There is a refrigerator and an induction cooker, and pots and tableware are provided for free. **It is very convenient to buy vegetables and fruits for takeaway, and it is nutritious and delicious to cook for children who do not eat seafood. I tried the salt-baked Wenchang chicken (highly recommended), salt-based shrimp, garlic spinach, cucumber scrambled eggs, tomato and egg soup. Perfect!
2. Each room has an outdoor balcony. There are three washing machines on the first floor of the hotel, free laundry detergent, 24-hour self-service laundry, washing and drying, and the room provides a dirty clothes basket and enough hangers, enough for a family of three.
3. In addition to disposable slippers, the room also provides two pairs of hole shoes, which can be worn to the beach and the sea. Within 10 minutes of walking to the beach, the hotel also has a free shuttle bus to the beach from time to time, which is very thoughtful.
4. The variety of breakfast is rich, no less than that of five-star hotels in first-tier cities, and the fresh ingredients are served quickly. The lunch set meal recommends the hamburger meal, which is huge! The small hot pot dish at night is very large and delicious, and the two of them didn't finish it.
5. There is a small children's paradise indoors on the first floor, and the ocean ball trampoline, children go there every morning and evening. There are two small swimming pools outside, normal temperature! One for children is 0.3 meters deep and the other is 1.4 meters infinity. There are lifeguards on duty, and various types of swimming rings can be borrowed for free.
6. Fruits are delivered on the first day of check-in. The mineral water and beverages (Coke, Coconut Juice, Beer) in the room are replenished generously. We live on the 8th floor. The housekeeper and master Shan Haisheng heard that we are cooking and sent a lot of mineral water Water, all aspects of service are excellent, and the WeChat housekeeper responds quickly.

It feels connected to the lake in front. The gym is also more comfortable when there are fewer people exercising. Children don‚Äôt want to leave after playing in the children‚Äôs playground. The cleanliness is also very good, I am very satisfied with the clean up of the room, the quilt and bed sheets are full of sun-dried fragrance. There are relatively few people near the hotel, and the environment is relatively comfortable and suitable for vacation. The service staff of the hotel will greet me with a smile on the road, like an acquaintance who has known me for a long time. Every time I pass by the front desk, Yingying calls me by my last name very kindly, and asks if the stay is comfortable or not. When I left the store, she personally escorted me to the door. I will definitely choose this hotel next time I come back. But I have to say that the construction site next to this one is too noisy, and it is clanging at 7 o'clock. Fortunately, I am not used to sleeping in!

I have stayed in many InterContinental hotels and the service standards are really great, from arrival at the hotel to hotel lobby staff and room service staff. The restaurant service staff will greet you with a smile on their faces, especially the housekeeper, Miss Si Ting, who is very helpful and patient, and helps answer various questions.
We live in a room on the 4th floor of Building 2. I don‚Äôt understand why there is an aunt on the floor every morning. She must be a local member of the ward rounds staff. She is holding a folder and a red rag. She is always slapping her hands while walking down the corridor. The phone was very loud and I couldn‚Äôt understand a word. It must be in the local Hainanese dialect. It even scared the childrenü§£ü§£ü§£I don‚Äôt understand why they both spoke fluent Hainanese dialect when they met twice. The voice was very loud.

The toilet is too simple. In short, the flaws are not hidden. It is worth recommending to live in Yalong Bay at this price.

When we called, they patiently answered various questions and helped us prepare the room in advance. After checking in, I didn't know how to get to the beach. I met Susu, a little beauty in the lobby, who kindly and patiently helped me call a car and told me how to play the surrounding attractions. I also thoughtfully brought a set of sand digging tools for the children, and the children were very happy not to want it! Along the way, they told me to go back to the hotel to find this sister! But the bad thing about this hotel is that you can't sleep late, there is a construction site next to it, which affects your rest, and children will make trouble if they don't sleep well. Wait until the next time the nearby construction site is not under construction or when it is finished, come to experience Xinghua's service.

Unexpectedly, I still experienced the perfect service of InterContinental as always. Because it is a newly opened hotel, the facilities and equipment are old and new, and the hygiene is not maintained. When I enter the room, I feel relaxed. Because we arranged a room close to the construction site when we first arrived, the family members slept relatively lightly, so I contacted Jane, and she helped us solve the problem immediately and changed a room. Breakfast time is my favorite. The end time is until 13:00. After getting up early and going to the room to take a shower, I will take a leisurely breakfast. It is a perfect morning~afternoon and I will go to the hotel's swimming pool. Next to the infinity pool is the lake, soaking in the water Basking in the sun, this environment is simply not too good! ! This time the schedule was tight and we only stayed for two days.

The sanitation and facilities are also the best among several hotels I have compared. I added Yingying‚Äôs WeChat when I checked in. Not only did I provide a perfect check-in strategy and surrounding tourist information, but I also quickly responded to and solved any problems, very considerate! Breakfast time is really a boon for vacationers. Take your children to have a delicious breakfast and then go to the pool to play for a while. When you return to the room, you will see that the room staff has cleaned up the room, and then take a perfect nap.

Facilities: Because this hotel was opened in 22 years, the facilities and equipment are well preserved. It looks very new, and the gym, laundry room, and swimming pool all look like home.

Hygiene: Dirty is rarely seen in the park and hotel buildings, and the sanitation is very clean. I am not too friendly to a clean freak. The room was tidied up for me every day when I came back.

Environment: The front of the hotel is the mountain view and the back is the lake view. It is also very comfortable to stroll around the hotel every day when you have nothing to do. The hotel is on the mountainside and the air is very fresh.

Service: When it comes to the service, let me say a few words. The little brother at the concierge depar**ent came to help with the luggage when I first started, and I didn't wait for a long time when I checked in. It was Yingying who checked me in. She quickly helped me adjust the room and let me enter the room.

But one downside is that the construction site next to it is a bit noisy

The hotel is halfway up the mountain. The ordinary room booked was upgraded to a mountain view suite. There is also a caring butler who answers every question, which is very good! There are also fruits, which are very delicious. The rooms are relatively new, and the price is very high.
However, because I bring children who cannot sleep by themselves, the small room is useless. There is also a room where two elderly people are used to sleeping separately. This room type is not very suitable, and two large beds are more suitable. The room is rather dark and not bright enough. If you want to enjoy the sea, it is better to choose a first-line sea view hotel. We have visited the sea two days ago, so I wish the mountain view is also very good. It is really good to enjoy the mountain view with coffee or a cup of tea in the morning Enjoy it!
Finally, there are really a lot of delicious food nearby. Although the seafood is not cheap, it is very fresh and delicious. There is also Hainanese duck soup, which is very satisfying. Yalong Bay has refreshed my impression of Hainan, and I want to come again next time!

The location of the hotel is also relatively close to the entrance of the public passage to the sea. It is also excellent to go for a walk by the beach during the day. The most worth mentioning is the hotel's breakfast, which has a rich variety, both Chinese and Western styles and local ones. The focus is on the design of the 7.00-13.00 brunch. It can be seen that the hotel management is also quite generous! It is suitable for our lazy people to stay in bed on vacation! Wake up and go to the restaurant for lunch, and then go to the beach in the afternoon. The sun is very warm in winter and the sea is just right. very comfortable. Be sure to order early!

This holiday hotel in Sanya is very cost-effective in Yalong Bay, where the land is very expensive. The suites are 60 to 70 square meters, with two bedrooms and a kitchen bathtub. It can also be regarded as a first-line sea view, but it does not have a private beach (the beach is five miles away from the hotel) Minutes away, the beach has fewer people, much less people than some hotel private beaches), and the price of less than 1,000 in the crowded peak season is really profitable.

I originally ordered welcome fruit for the first day's order, but there was no sign of it until I left a few days later. On the first day, due to the lack of staff, we didn't check in until after 4:30 in the afternoon. The room was cleaned in a hurry and it was not very clean. They are all under the banner of InterContinental. After the construction of Hualuxe two years ago, maybe you can try there.

msg:Because I have been to Sanya several times, this time I moved here from the seaside of Tianya Town and wanted to find a hotel for a few days of vacation. This hotel was chosen because it had just opened, but it is actually a 5-star flag and 4-star standard .
But let me tell you something:
1. Just arrived at the room and lifted the quilt, the sheets were stained and hairy, and I didn't want to ask the hotel to re-yellow the sheets after a long journey.
2. For me, the mattress is very comfortable, but the pillow is not good, it is a bit hard and does not rebound.
3. The TV is well received and can be casted.
4. The hair dryer will be exhausting for long-haired girls, because they have to be pressed all the time and forcefully, so it is best for long-haired girls to bring their own hair dryer, otherwise the knuckles will hurt.
5. Because it is on the side of the road, the balcony windows will be a bit less sound-proof when closed. Maybe there are not many people in the epidemic, so the road was fairly quiet during the few nights we stayed. The door is not very sound proof, just next to us is the utility room, where the staff are tossing and turning every day, it is a bit noisy, so the sound insulation is a bit poor.
6. We chose to have a buffet at the hotel on Chris**as Eve. The dishes are not very rich and mediocre, but they feel like 4 stars, but we still had a good time after winning the lottery. But I had brunch on the day I left. The restaurant I arrived at 12:00 noon basically had no food. I was very disappointed. Many dishes would not be continued, but the staff came over to apologize and said that there were too many people, but I just wanted to say that it doesn‚Äôt matter Not too much, since it‚Äôs not time to collect meals, we should refill the food, let alone 12 o‚Äôclock is the time for meals.
7. The staff are still very enthusiastic and will greet you when they see you. The service will not be excessive, but they are still responsive.
Summary: It may just be the time of the first wave of Yangkang, and it is generally quiet. The service of the hotel staff is still ok. But it's really not a resort hotel. If you want to eat, drink and play in the hotel, you still need to choose the old 5-star hotels before. But I will still stay in this hotel for a few days next time.

msg:1. I ordered a sea view suite. When I first arrived at the hotel, there were only low-floor rooms. Is the room the hotel staff took me to see first? I don‚Äôt like the low-floor rooms very much. I checked out on a high floor, and found out that there was a high floor that I just checked out, and then I arrived at noon, so I went to eat chicken, and the hotel staff rushed to clean up the room on that high floor for me first.
2. Because the flight back to Tianjin was scheduled at 8:00 p.m., but usually check out at 12:00 p.m., the hotel staff considered the actual needs of customers and postponed the check-out for us for free, allowing us to return at 4:00 p.m. Checked out early due to rescheduled flight
3. The aunt in charge of room service in the hotel is also very good. The one in charge of us is Ms. Wu. She is very active and kind, and she is also very quick in her work.
4. The front desk person who received us was Ah Bing, who had a very good attitude and was considerate of customers. There was also a little sister who showed us the house. She was very gentle and cute, and she was not too old.
5. The hotel has complete facilities, including a gym, an outdoor swimming pool, and a lifeguard. Master Kong is also very nice and talkative
6. There are sandals in the room. Those who want to go don‚Äôt need to bring sandals. The large mirror in the bathroom has a defogging function, and there is also a full-length mirror. If you want pots, you can ask room service for them. Of course, the number is limited
7. It is less than 10 minutes walk to the beach, of course you can ask the hotel to call a sightseeing car for you, it is free~
8. You must go to the travel ticket and sailing ticket given away, and there is also a free car pick-up near the beach ~ and this hotel can park for free
During the epidemic, it would be great if there are more disposable items, such as disposable toilet seats, disposable paper cups, disposable chopsticks, etc. ~Of course there are some things you can ask for from room service~
When traveling, the first choice is the destination and the second is the hotel choice. It is very important to have a good check-in experience environment

msg:The first time I learned about this hotel was because Earl Brigade booked this hotel. I didn't want to bother me and booked the same hotel. Before I arrived, I made several phone calls, and the hotel staff were also very enthusiastic to help me answer questions and let me go out to be optimistic about the epidemic policy. When I arrived at the hotel, before I got out of the car, the young lady ran over enthusiastically to pick up the luggage. Because the Earl booked a suite, the hotel upgraded our first three nights and the last night to a suite for free. The hotel also sent welcome fruit, which was very fresh. Because of fear, I have never seen such a big flying insect flying to the balcony outside, so I will trouble the little brother in the hotel to deal with it. Because of this episode, the hotel also presented desserts and fruit platters, which were well received. Go to taste the breakfast on the first floor, which is delicious and complete. The interior of the hotel is well equipped and clean, with a kitchenette and refrigerator. It is less than ten minutes away from the beach, and you can get there just by turning a corner. You can go there for less than 10 yuan by taxi for the surrounding food, but I basically order takeaway, which is also very convenient.

Not only is it noisy, but also the construction workers can directly see the room here. As a result, the curtains were closed for the entire two days of the stay, and there was no view Experience, I didn't know this before I checked in, and the front desk didn't tell me whether to change rooms. The second is that I bought medicine because of severe physical pain and asked the delivery boy to send the room to the front desk. As a result, the front desk phone couldn't get through for half an hour. Finally, when I got through, they said they couldn't deliver it. What I want to say is that they clearly said that this is a guest. medicine! I was in so much pain that I was lying on the ground and couldn‚Äôt go downstairs to get it. It‚Äôs ridiculous to ignore such a simple request to send it upstairs, not to mention that I went downstairs to get all the takeaways a few days ago. I have troubled the service staff, and it is handled specially in special circumstances. Do you want the guest to pass out in the room? And the phone in the room often doesn't work like a decoration.
This is the first time in my life that I encountered such a bad accommodation experience, bad reviews, and I will never stay in this hotel again!

Advantages: Breakfast is highly recommended. If you can‚Äôt get up, you can eat lunch directly. You can eat until 1 pm. The suite inside the room is very large and spacious
Disadvantages: There are not enough service staff during the Spring Festival. I waited for the room for 4 hours, and the room has a balcony, but I can't see the sea view. I always feel that there is a problem with the design of the exterior wall and the view is limited.

First of all, I am very grateful to the manager Chen Fei. I added uu's WeChat before I went there and answered many of my questions. She told us that we were going to take an 8-month-old baby, and she thoughtfully arranged a whole set of baby equipment for us, including a stroller, a cot, a bath tub, etc. It was really very user-friendly. Most hotels do not have such a complete range of baby products, which really saves a lot of packing space, save one! Before I came, I ordered a lot of baby products online, and the hotel can collect them on their behalf, and none of them are lost, which is great.
After getting off the bus, Xiao Chen Robin from the concierge depar**ent opened the door for us to take our luggage, which was very friendly. Makes you feel at home.
The room is also very large, and there is a separate small room where the baby can sleep peacefully. With an induction cooker, we bought a pot to cook by ourselves, which is very convenient.
Overall, the price is really good, highly recommended. It is recommended to rent a car by yourself, so that it is more convenient to get in and out.

There was hair on the bed of the newly occupied room, and the sheets should not have been changed. The shower head in the shower is also someone else's hair. I want to know if the previous guest is too hairy or the cleaning aunt is short-sighted? btw, the first time I took a shower in my room, the bathroom was completely blocked. I started soaking my feet before turning on the shampoo. In the end, the water was everywhere. The problem is that I still live on the top floor, and the pipes are all like this. nausea!
The whole bathroom is starting to grow mold and yellow spots, and for a hotel that's been open for less than a year, all I have is one word: yue!


üîîService: Emphasize and emphasize again: The service of this hotel is 0 service. In the evening, the front desk ignores the answer, and the hall lights are turned off at night to save electricity. I feel like I am staying in a small hotel. There is obviously a food delivery robot in the lobby. The front desk refuses to let the delivery staff use it. If you order takeaway, you have to take it yourself. In addition, the service response is also very bad. The cleaning and lobby staff here should be underpaid, and the hotel's training can't keep up. They are completely guerrillas. Everyone serves according to their own mood. Shama, as a chain of serviced apartments, does this even domestically. The third-tier chain hotels are not as good as it is, it is really speechless.

üçÉEnvironment: The first time I checked in, I said I needed a quiet room, and then arranged for me to be next to the construction site. The cutting machine started work on time at 8:30 in the morning. Is this the so-called quiet? Opening the window at night is the construction site, gloomy, and it feels like a horror movie.

What can I say, I can only blame me for choosing this hotel as a poor guy, but if you are also a poor guy and choose this hotel, you need to be mentally prepared to meet a group of poor guys who are not only poor but also pretend to be tough in the lobby Wandering through the corridors, wearing a $30 bathrobe and showing off everywhere, nostrils up. Have you seen too many selfie photos of other celebrities wearing bathrobes? There are also many Northeastern ***s who couldn't help but feel disgusting. A room of 600 is actually only worth 300, plus in Yalong Bay, at most 400

Don't live there, or you'll just get unfortunate!

Generally speaking, the location of this hotel is not the best, but it is the latest compared to nearby hotels with similar prices. Compared, but the infinity pool, the lake and the sea are the same color, very comfortable, almost no one after dinner. It is about a ten-minute walk from the seaside, not very far. It is said that the hotel still has electric cars to go to the seaside, so there is no chance to sit there. Slightly upset stomach after eating. When I first checked into the hotel, the front desk was a bit tricky and gave a room on the fourth floor, saying it was a sea view suite. As a result, when I went to the room, I could only see three or four meters wide (the gap between the two buildings), looking from a distance. The sea view and lake view are a little bit. The newly built and unfinished construction site is only a few feet away. I agreed with the hotel that there is no room (the price difference is more than 800 per night for similar room types on the platform), so I can only call Ctrip to respond. I have used Ctrip for more than ten years, and I feel the most deeply. It is so caring. Not only does it actively connect, but also tracks the service until I am satisfied. The trustworthy platform üëçüëçüëç Mr. Lin Hong from the hotel is very attentive and considerate. The one who stayed in is really a world of difference. I changed it to a slightly better room, 808. The view is much better, but the balcony does not know why there is a solid wall, which affects the scenery. I told Mr. Lin and changed it the next day. 706, which is as follows. Although the lake and sea room type is not the most satisfactory floor on the 9th floor, I am satisfied with the service attitude. I hope that the hotel can provide attentive service like Mr. Lin, and it is worthy of high-end hotels and such prices. Room 706 is quite satisfactory. It is a bit like an apar**ent with one bedroom, one living room, one kitchen, one bathroom and one balcony. It has a kitchenette, refrigerator, and electric ceramic stove. Unfortunately, there is no chance to use it. There is also a small room, suitable for children. Big, sitting on the table and chairs on the balcony, drinking tea is very comfortable, I think it's worth the price, vacation, it was originally for a good mood, although it was a bit unpleasant before, I finally spent the vacation happily through the platform coordination, the first time I agree with a platform so much, I hope it will get better and better.

I took a taxi from the airport to the hotel for a little over 100. It was already night when I arrived at the hotel. I booked a king-size room with a mountain view. I got the key and found that it was given to me as a standard room with interior view. When it comes to downgrading the guest's room, they all upgrade the guest's room. I went to the front desk to communicate and said that there is no room. So what's the point of booking the room so long in advance? Even if it doesn't, it can't give me a drop. Anyway, I often come to Sanya. This is the first time I encountered such a drop. However, the hotel is reasonable, and finally upgraded me to a suite. Lou, I can't see anything, but the big bed room is comfortable to sleep in, after all, I don't need two beds! However, I would like to give a 5-star praise to the cleaning brother Chen Hao. I learned that there were children and gave us more daily necessities such as paper towels.
To sum up, I am basically satisfied, but this hotel does not have a dedicated private beach!

msg:I come to Sanya every year to celebrate the New Year. Basically, I can stay in almost all the hotels in Sanya. Based on the principle of wanting to stay in a newly opened hotel, I booked three suites in this hotel plus a meal for 5 people per table for 1,688 yuan on New Year‚Äôs Eve. You can You read that right, that‚Äôs all there is, and there‚Äôs a fruit plate that hasn‚Äôt been photographed. Is Sanya‚Äôs money so easy to earn? I understand that Chinese New Year is busy, at least I paid 1688 and you can give me the whole table that looks like 688! I called the front desk before boarding the plane and communicated my loneliness. When I arrived at the hotel to check in, it was still a mess. How can I explain it specifically? Maybe only people who have stayed here can feel it. Fortunately, I only booked it for two days, so I hurriedly left~

The hotel gave a sailing experience, and the baby likes it very much!
The hotel also sent a travel photo. The photographer was very patient and taught us all kinds of photo actions. My baby kept saying it was fun; and the film selector, Xiao Wu, was very good. I asked her to help take photos, and they all agreed. I am, thanks!

When I checked in, I happened to meet Director Huang of the hotel. He introduced the hotel with enthusiasm and patience. , It feels like a home away from home. The hotel arranges a series of travel photography, water and other activities, Haitang Bay duty-free shuttle bus, and afternoon tea. In the evening, you can taste Hainan's special hot pot. You can go to exercise or swim at any time in your spare time. Breakfast is different every day. , suitable for guests from all over the country to dine, with a wide variety; service concepts, from Wang Hao depar**ent leaders, receptionists at the door, receptionists such as Chen Xiaolan at the front desk, restaurant waiters Zhou Gui, etc., to room attendants Xiaotang and Xiaowei, or beach driver Aledu They are very enthusiastic and have warm smiles on their faces. They often say something "find me at any time, I will serve you". Since our stay was very good, we stayed for another two days, and really reluctant to leave, The hotel gives a warm, warm, warm, caring, clean home-away-from-home experience, rich in life, and shares and explores the experience and interest of life in the form of a short-term leisure travel life concept. Next time I come to Sanya, Hainan, I will stay at your hotel and recommend it to my friends. It is worthy of praise that the water sports coach and the photographer Xiao Tan are serious and responsible. Go to the tourist resort hotel on Ctrip, feel at ease, assured and responsible. Thank you to our service staff for this perfect holiday

He rolled his eyes to the sky and barely bothered to pay attention to you. The words are written on his face. . I stayed in a hotel in Sanya for a month and this is the worst front desk I have ever seen. In addition, the cleaning of the room basically just replenishes towels for you, the water cup will not be cleaned for you, the table will not be wiped, the sofa pillows will not be arranged, and the bed will not be made for you. For two days, I even forgot to replenish water. . I won't take the initiative to pick up the garbage bags placed at the door for you. This hotel service really surprised me. . . I don‚Äôt know if every cleaning staff in your hotel does this or only the cleaning staff on the 6th floor of Building 1 does this. I really want to know how you usually train your employees? You are in the service industry. . .

msg:This is the first time I want to give a negative review to a hotel. I would like to say that my experience was particularly bad at some points.
First, I was shocked when I opened the room. Not to mention the small size of the room, I can accept it. But! ! ! The window in the room was blocked and you couldn't see outside at all! ! As shown in the picture, the most important thing is that the sound insulation is not good, and the construction outside is always too big, so even if the door is closed, you can hear it clearly!
Second, I am raising my children by myself, so there is no need to book a family room. The standard room is enough. For this reason, they refused my request for a children's toothbrush, saying that the cost was too high. They only gave it to guests who booked parent-child rooms, and the room I booked was not available.
Thirdly, the hotel's swimming pool is small and pitiful. There is no place to play in the hotel and nothing to stroll around. There was nothing around, and it was inconvenient to eat. Fortunately, we drove there. They all drive out to eat!
Fourth, my child and I didn‚Äôt want to move about dinner. We ate in the hotel restaurant. The food was served so slowly that I almost fell asleep. My child was so hungry that he almost finished the set meal of radish, pickles, peanuts, etc. before the food was served. It‚Äôs best to order the Coconut Chicken Hotpot, it‚Äôs faster, so be prepared to wait when ordering.
Fifth, the hotel is a little far from the beach. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk. You can use the hotel's shuttle bus, but the shuttle bus ends at 5:20 pm. At that time, the sun is about to go down. It's just right. When we were having a good time, the children didn't want to leave at all. We played until about six o'clock and had to walk back by ourselves.
To sum up, this hotel does not have a resort experience. I booked this hotel because it is newly opened and the price is similar to Huayu and Yingbin Hotel. Yalong Bay is just for vacation. There are too many hotel choices. There is no need to choose this hotel. If this hotel is located in the urban area, I will think it is OK.

msg:My trip to Sanya would like to focus on complimenting this hotel. First of all, the location is behind the first-line beach of Yalong Bay. The hotel shuttle bus will pick you up and drop off to the beach for free every half an hour, which is only about 400 meters away. It is actually very convenient to play in the sea. But because I grew up by the sea, I actually don't have any special obsession with sea views. Instead, I feel that this quiet hotel surrounded by mountains and sea is especially suitable for our hearts. Because it is a new hotel and the price is high, I chose it decisively. It turns out that the hotel was chosen too right. The one-bedroom and one-living room chosen for the room is very large, and the balcony is also spacious, facing the emerald green mountains, the air is particularly fresh and fragrant. The service is hotel-like, but the space equipment is high-end residential. The refrigerator, induction cooker and range hood are all available. The toilet has a clear space, not only a bathtub, but also marble for the elderly to sit down in the shower, which is very convenient. The type of breakfast is basically the same level as a five-star hotel. The pool water is the cleanest I have ever encountered. It has also built an infinity pool. There are deck chairs and pavilions facing the lake view. You can soak in the scenery all day, away from the tropical paradise forest. The park is about 5 kilometers away by taxi, and there are also commercial streets and local food streets in Liupan Village for eating nearby. Personally, it is very convenient. Very cost-effective, highly recommended to friends who choose Yalong Bay!

The hotel has a swimming pool, buffet dinner, 98 people. When I went to dinner at night, the lakeside scenery was very good. I think it is very worthwhile. I bought it with double breakfast, the breakfast variety is ok, quite rich, and the service staff are good, I recommend staying in a hotel when I come to Sanya, it is very pleasant

msg:be cheated! Looking at the score of 4.7, it is a newly opened hotel in Yalong Bay, so I booked for two nights in the afternoon of the check-in day. The basic room type deluxe mountain view room with double breakfast increased to 358 yuan/night, which is not cheap. As a result, when I went to the store, the room was so small that it did not claim 40 square meters. The so-called mountain view outside the balcony was occupied by a stall next to it, which was seriously inconsistent with the promotional image. So I asked the front desk if I could spend money to upgrade, saying that the last room-type deluxe mountain-view suite was full today. I opened Ctrip and found that there are rooms available? The front desk said it should have forgotten to close. I asked if it could be cancelled, and said you want Ctrip to tell us. So I contacted Ctrip's customer service, with a good attitude, and agreed to contact the hotel. After a while, the front desk called and said that they could upgrade to an elegant twin suite for free, but there was no view from the balcony. So I went to see that it turned out that it was close to the construction site under construction. There was no noise outside, and the balcony was full of dust. No wonder the balcony was sealed. I didn't want it at the time, but the room door was closed and the noise was very small. The suite was much better than the previous room type. In addition, it was already more than five o'clock in the afternoon and I didn't want to bother, so I agreed to change the room. But I still feel uncomfortable. It turns out that the upgrade can still be done for free. Why do we have to wait for us to check out and Ctrip intervenes to get the upgrade? Can't we take the initiative? And when I opened Ctrip at 11 o‚Äôclock that evening, the Deluxe Mountain View Suite could still be booked. I felt that I didn‚Äôt want to upgrade the room type, so I upgraded the worst room. After staying for two days, I found that the construction site next to it started from more than 7 in the morning to more than 10 in the evening. Although the sound is not loud, it is still annoying. From this point of view, the hotel is not kind.
The advantage of the hotel is the newly opened hotel, the facilities are very new, the suite area is large, the hardware reaches the five-star standard, the check-in experience is very comfortable, some people bring in the room to help with the luggage, some staff have a good attitude, it is a five-minute walk from the Yalong Bay beach, which is considered Near; breakfast is also good. If the hotel is in a certain urban area, it should be a good star hotel, but in Yalong Bay, it lacks the flavor of vacation. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs swimming pool has a low water temperature and it is impossible to swim at night. It takes half an hour to walk from Baihua Valley and it is not convenient to eat. In addition to being close to the construction site, it is recommended to choose carefully. What Yalong Bay lacks is not a hotel. Resort hotels should have a better choice.

msg:I came to Sanya for the first time. There are old and young. After living in Sanya Bay for three days, I changed to Yalong Bay. Before I came, I saw many hotels on Ctrip. We three adults and one child, at least two A single bed, preferably a suite, will be more convenient.
   
  The suites I saw were either too expensive or too old, or were of the kind of homestays and apar**ent hotels. Looking at the B&Bs and apar**ent-style hotels, there are generally no public facilities such as children's amusement facilities and swimming pools.

   I saw Shama Hotel on Xiaohongshu and the reviews were very good. I finally booked this one. I think the price/performance ratio is really high! The check-in experience is very good. The suite itself is very cost-effective for a price of more than 300. The hotel staff are very polite and super gentle. Andy Chen at the front desk is very patient, and finally helped us upgrade the room for free. The small bedroom and the bed are larger, and the living is more comfortable. After entering the room, the first impression is that it is very clean. At that time, I filmed a video to my friend. The friend said that it was like a model room for selling a house. The room was also very spacious. The large balcony, the bedding is really one of the best since I have stayed in so many hotels, the family said that it seems that they have not lived in, it is very new and new, and I highly recommend it to friends who are more worried about hotel hygiene.

     Because there are elderly and children, we don‚Äôt get up too late in the morning. We go to the restaurant for breakfast. Breakfast is available at 7-10. Don‚Äôt worry about getting up late. The breakfast is also very rich and there are many types. It is on the first floor of the hotel. , The dining environment is quiet and comfortable. The manager of the restaurant is very good. He will take the initiative to introduce us which area to eat. The staff and service attitude of the restaurant are very good and make people feel very comfortable.
        
    The overall experience was very good. I took the elderly and children to Paradise Forest Park, which is very close to the hotel. We can drive there in about 10 minutes. It is also very close to the beach, about 300 meters. After dinner, you can take a walk to the beach. It‚Äôs very comfortable. If I have the opportunity to come to Yalong Bay next time, I‚Äôll still choose this one.

The newly opened hotel this year was also the first one I saw before coming to Sanya, and it was placed at the second stop of the journey.

Yalong Bay is really a suitable resort area, there are mountains and seas, it is very quiet at night, and the air is fresh. The location of Shama is relatively deeper and more suitable for self-driving.

The hotel‚Äôs internal facilities are novel and large. It is similar to an apar**ent room. It has a refrigerator and a kitchen. It is very suitable for vacation. .

The service at Shama Hotel is very good. Auntie will come to clean the room every day, take out the garbage, change towels and toiletries, etc. The front desk staff are equally enthusiastic, and Xiaoxue, who checked in for me, specially arranged a corner room and was very satisfied.

Personally suggest that if the TV channel can have some programs like CCTV, Oriental TV, etc., it would be even better, and the breakfast can also be appropriately increased and replaced with some varieties.

I told the waiter about the trendy bedding and immediately changed me one. It was better than the previous one, but still very damp. It made me feel uncomfortable and couldn‚Äôt sleep. I suddenly thought of taking bath towels and spreading it underneath in the early morning. I slept from 2 am to 6 am and decided to change the hotel when I got up. I thought this was a newly opened hotel in that area. Very disappointed, let‚Äôs talk about the internal environment of the hotel. It‚Äôs easy to get lost when you get off the elevator in a tube building. The room signs are very unclear. The most weird thing is that the lights in the corridors of this hotel building are not turned on before 7 pm. It‚Äôs very crippled, girls shouldn‚Äôt live alone, very insecure, the front desk staff are all boys, and it feels terrible.

üîîService: Let‚Äôs talk about the service. There is an induction cooker in the room for cooking. However, if you want to cook, you need to rent a pot from the room service depar**ent. This hotel is really lacking in structure, so you can make money right away, because Considering that I have to rent a pot and have to go a long way to buy ingredients, I gave up decisively. This thing itself is not important to me because I didn't plan to cook when I came out to play, but I thought it was quite interesting. Come again Speaking of the concierge, can Wen Libin send things by post? The concierge said that it could be mailed. Order online and put things at the front desk. When the courier comes, he will go to the front desk and ask whether the hotel has a negotiated price for mailing things. The concierge said that the negotiated price of the hotel is only whether the hotel can use it for the guests. I really feel that this hotel has no sense of service! Never come again, just rush to the corridor before 7 o‚Äôclock in the evening without turning on the lights, so there will never be a second time, too scary
Picture 1, I was about to go out at 6pm. I was waiting for the elevator in the hotel elevator. The corridor was dark and there were no lights. The concierge said the lights would be turned on at about 7 o'clock. There are pictures and the truth.
Picture two, the overall structure of the hotel, just like a tube building surrounded on all sides, feels completely insecure
Picture three, I can‚Äôt fall asleep on the mattress and quilt in the middle of the night. I really want to see what the structure of their quilt is. Turning on the light, it is obvious that the distribution of the filling inside is very uneven. This should probably be caused by the tide, I don‚Äôt want to Do not recommend this hotel if you step on the pit

Before the epidemic, I spent more than 200 days in a hotel outside a year, so the requirements for hotels are still quite high.

msg:It was possible to give a full 5-star rating, but one thing after checking out made people feel very uncomfortable. After we checked out, the hotel did not log out the ID card information in time, which caused us not to go to another hotel at night. I checked in and called the Shama Hotel. The line was always busy, but it was finally connected after 10 minutes, and no one answered the phone. We called again after 1 minute, and the line was busy for a long time, which caused us to wait a long time at the front desk of another hotel. It is recommended that Shama increase a phone number or increase the front desk staff.

It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the beach. There are hotels to go. The shuttle bus to the beach ends at 17:30 in the evening. The water and sand in the beach area are quite clean, and there are many marine entertainment options to choose from. The hotel is very new and the facilities are very good, the service is attentive and enthusiastic, and the breakfast is exquisite and generous, very delicious. The size of the suite is large and it is comfortable to live in. The bedding and beds are good for the decoration style. The balcony is large and spacious.

The hotel really has a sense of design! Films are released in many places
In terms of service, I think it should be done beforehand to add points and remedy afterwards does not reduce points, but it will give people a different feeling...but still have to boast hahahaha, the service is really good, Xiaoli at the front desk and Manager Chen Fei is very good
whatever! Great value for money! Everyone can rush

Location: Although you don't look at the sea directly, there is an ATV shuttle every ten minutes. It takes only six or seven minutes to walk to the beach.

Facilities: The hotel is newly opened this year, so everything is new and tidy, and the TV, air-conditioning and other electrical appliances are also new and awesome.

Service: There was a little episode when checking in, but the front desk decisively helped upgrade the suite. Check out is also very fast. In addition, there were two staff members who left a good impression during the stay: 1. The pool staff Kang Kai, the service is enthusiastic and proactive, and the attitude is also very friendly. 2. The room attendant Wu Yongyong is attentive and conscientious, and also took the initiative to prepare ice for us. water.

But I still have to talk about two shortcomings of the hotel: the first pillow is uncomfortable and there is no choice. Generally, there are two kinds of pillows in the hotel rooms, but his family only has low pillows. Maybe I am not used to it after the first day of sleep. My back was so painful that I got used to it a few days later. Wang Shama considers this and takes care of the habits of different guests. The second next door can hear a little noise during the day during the decoration, but if you go out to play and then come back at night, it will have no effect. The room was very quiet at night, and it was very pleasant to listen to the cicadas chirping in the summer night wind.

I heard that the order was placed on Ctrip just after it opened. The receptionist was Mrs. Wu Shixue Liang at the front desk who handled my order very enthusiastically and seriously. She was really very enthusiastic and fatigued. The hotel was very large and there were many rooms. We are a family room. The children have their own bed and bathroom. The dry and wet separation is very good. The bathing place is very large. There is a balcony and a shelf for drying clothes. It is very hard to sit on the balcony and blow the hair after going out to play. It is really home away from home. The morning is very rich. The gym is on the first floor of the restaurant. Outside the restaurant is a borderless swimming pool. When you go out to play, you can go for a swim. There is a taxi when you come out of the hotel door. Buy a large refrigerator and buy a local refrigerator in Hainan to play and eat an iced watermelon. It feels cool and crooked. I highly recommend this hotel and I will not regret it.

msg:I originally booked this hotel on Ctrip because it was newly renovated this year. It looked close to the beach, but it turned out to be backed by the green hills, facing the lake, and overlooking the ocean. I think it is very cost-effective. A taxi from the airport costs 117 yuan. When I got off the car, I saw two high-rise buildings in the hotel. At the time of check-in, the service quality of Wu Rui, the guest manager at the front desk, made me overjoyed. Because the booked room told me that it had not been repaired, Fairy Wu upgraded me to the mountain-view suite for free. Once the door is opened, it is simply not too beautiful. Which hotel in Sanya can achieve such a high cost performance and service quality at this price. Fairy Wu also answered various travel questions for me, and gave reference opinions one by one, and finally accepted the suggestion to split the group for a day trip. I am honored to feel the 7-star butler service. Very nice! ! ! The hotel is really new and the room types are also very practical. The rooms have two external balconies. Let the residents stay for a few days without wanting to go out. In the evening it is indeed a ten-minute walk to the beach. Too hot during the day (and there is a small road through the large parking lot. It really saves a lot of time)

1. There is noisy construction nearby day and night, the sound of electric drill can be heard at 8 o'clock in the morning ~ there is also a little noise at night (no electric drill)
2. The duvet + pillow should be used. Good guy, it smells like living in a poultry house. . . Encountered this situation for the first time.
3. Install glass in the toilet and bathroom + this curtain can't be put in the end. . . Downstairs is the swimming pool open until ten o'clock in the evening. When taking a bath, I can see the children below having a great timeü•≥
4. The bathrobe is not clean. I originally planned to wear it, but I gave up when there were stains on it.
In the end, I didn't get a good night's sleep.
Advantages: the room rate is cheap, the buffet is very cheap, there is a swimming pool, suitable for families with children.

But when I arrived at the hotel, it was really great. This is a special restaurant that does not engage in noodles. The actual hotel looks at the hotel lobby and the exterior view is unremarkable, but the rooms are very large, spacious and well designed. There are two rooms, one large and one small, with a balcony, an induction cooker and a refrigerator. The wardrobe is also equipped with an electric iron and an ironing board, and the bathroom is also It‚Äôs very large, and it‚Äôs very comfortable to bring children out to play and live, especially within a 10-minute walk from the beach. The hotel has an electric frequency sightseeing bus to the beach every half an hour. The hotel also provides children‚Äôs slippers and bathrobes. It‚Äôs also very good. Unfortunately, the price of staying increased later. I regret that I didn‚Äôt book a few more nights directly. The only unreasonable thing is that the family room is only given two breakfasts for three people. The breakfast variety is not very large, but the taste is good, and the additions are also very good. timely.

msg:The newly opened lakeside hotel features a classic Chinese garden design, with larger guest rooms and reasonable partitioning. The only dissatisfaction is that the store is not a flash member store, why do diamond members authorize Ctrip to pay without secret? After the customer arrives at the store, he has to pay for the room fee plus 600 yuan as a deposit? And after I paid the room fee and deposit, I still can‚Äôt turn off Alipay to pay without password? It was not until dawn and after contacting Ctrip's customer service center that the password-free payment was cancelled. Not happy to stay in the shop on the first day! According to analysis, it may have been done by a Ctrip back-end manager because there is evidence of authorization. Hope to improve in the future.

msg:The hotel package purchased by Ctrip.com during May 1st will start a trip to Sanya during the Dragon Boat Festival.
The group purchase is a mountain-view parent-child suite, which needs to be booked at least 3 days in advance and can be upgraded free of charge depending on the room condition. Check-in at the hotel and the front desk indicated that other room types are fully booked and cannot be upgraded. Finally, I gave two parent-child suites with mountain views on the 6th floor connected together with balconies facing the tropical paradise forest of Yalong Bay.
Since the hotel is newly renovated and opened, the room smells of decoration just after entering, it will improve after opening the doors and windows for ventilation.
The 80-square-meter suite is spacious and comfortable. The large bed is 2 meters wide and the small bed is 1 meter wide. It is more than enough for two large and one small beds. The living room is equipped with a TV, sofa and coffee table. The kitchen is equipped with a refrigerator, but it is empty. Range hoods, induction cookers, sinks, and cooking tables are also available, but it is unrealistic to start a business without cooking utensils and seasonings.
The shower room is equipped with a drawstring, which is very practical to put towels and hang clothes. There are embedded marble seats on the wall to provide convenience for those in need. But it seems that there is no ventilation system, if you soak in the bathtub, it will be a little stuffy.
The balcony of the suite has a length of 2 rooms and is equipped with drying racks, which is suitable for parents and children to go out to dry. Because the balcony faces west, there will be sunshine only in the afternoon. Sitting on the lounge chair on the balcony overlooking the paradise forest is comfortable and comfortable.
The hotel is equipped with 2 large and 1 small bathrobes, which are suitable for playing in the swimming pool. The hotel swimming pool is small, so if there are not many people, it is enough to play in the water.
The key point is the lowest-rated hygiene. After entering the room, I opened the quilt and found that there were eyelashes on the sheets. I just wanted to dust it. Unexpectedly, later, it was found that the quilt cover was stained, the cover was covered with oil stains, the sheets were covered with hair, and the sofa was yellow stains... I had to call the front desk to check. Unexpectedly, the hotel operations director personally took care of it, and finally the bedding was changed again, and the guest room staff had a good attitude. The director also invited us to experience the hotel‚Äôs buffet dinner, which was considered a proper solution.
The hotel is newly opened, the facilities are very good, and quality management is also important. I hope that sanitation can be strengthened in the future. After all, cleanliness and sanitation are now the first and the top priority of the tourism industry after the epidemic!

msg:The location is relatively secluded and I like the quietness. It only takes 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach of Yalong Bay. In the morning, I even ran to the beach along the road. Thanks to the hotel for the upgraded suite. All is well with the new hotel. The breakfast is rich and better than other old 5-star hotels. It tastes delicious. The gym and swimming pool are a bit small.
