The room is more than 80 square meters and very spacious. The most amazing thing is the breakfast. Various freshly squeezed juices and nuts, including pine nuts, macadamia nuts, and pistachios are all very fresh. There are also 6 kinds of side dishes such as abalone and various delicacies. It is really the best breakfast I have had recently. The coffee for breakfast is really good. I have been drinking coffee for 10 years. This coffee is very mellow and delicious. It's great! In addition, the bed and pillow are very comfortable. The water used is also Evian mineral water. Various skin care products and shower gels are also big brands. You can feel that the hotel is very attentive and spends a lot of money. Finally, the quality of the waiters is also first-class. All kinds of knowing smiles make people feel very comfortable. I hope they can stick to it. ✊

The West Lake Scenic Area has traffic restrictions on weekends, and you can't take an online taxi directly to the hotel entrance.

The staff has a beautiful image and professional service, and is always ready to help guests whenever they need it. For example, Lily, a tall and slender beauty, has a great sense of direction. She solved the problem of hailing a taxi for us in the traffic-limited Hangzhou and personally led us to the car. There was also a handsome boy who forgot to read his name and provided us with a meticulous and appropriate reception when we arrived late at night. Including the guest's birthday cake, the BGM must be praised; and Zada, whose eyes turn into crescents when she smiles, is as sweet and cute as a Japanese porcelain doll... The hotel's bedding is particularly comfortable, the pillows are latex pillows of your choice, and every detail and corner is clean , breakfast surpasses all private dishes. If I have to be picky, it’s that the water in the bathroom is slow and water will accumulate. The rest is great👍🏻I have already highly recommended it to my friends who are going to Hangzhou~

The sleeping experience can only be given 30 points. Because the room is made of wood, it absorbs a lot of damp odor. I asked the guest room to replenish some essential oil, but the mixed smell made my head hurt as soon as it entered, which is very unfriendly to people with smell sensitivity.
The temperature experience in the room is indeed due to the large temperature difference between morning and night, and the air conditioning is difficult to control. The B&B has been very good with the air conditioning on during the day and the heating on at night. However, it was cold with the air conditioner turned off at night and hot with the air conditioner turned on. I only slept for three nights. Hour. .
Before checking in, I contacted the service staff and inquired about the type of pillows, but the down pillows were really weak, and the overall bedding should be improved for this price.
Finally, there was a small bug in the service. Before leaving the store, they were offered the service of printing a photo for free, but they did not provide it. A week after leaving the store, they did not receive any feedback from the staff.
I hope the B&B will get better and better.

The breakfast is particularly good. It is divided into staple food and side dishes. For the hot staple food, you can choose wontons or rice noodles. There are a lot of side dishes. What a pleasure.

The downside is that the room is too dark and there are not many lights. It gets even darker at night. I can't see clearly even if I put on makeup in the morning.

That's great! There will be refreshments and sumptuous afternoon tea when you check in. The breakfast is really exquisite and delicious. There are so many varieties that you can’t eat them all. The service is really shocking👍🏻 Everyone is very professional and polite, and they will give it to you when you leave. Got gifts and fruits! The staff will help carry your luggage to the car and watch you leave. After leaving, my mother was still full of praises, so she made a reservation for Anyu in Sanya next week right after she left! Hope the experience will be just as good❤️

It has been prepared for a long time, and you can eat and drink as much as you want, including fruit, coffee, etc. during your stay. Although the hotel breakfast is semi-buffet, it is very pleasant! I ordered a few side dishes for lunch and they tasted very good. The various supplies in the hotel room are very exquisite, the bedding is also very comfortable, and there are surprises (flowers).

The restaurant's food is very good. You don't have to go out to find something to eat when you stay here. On the first night we stayed in the hotel, we found a 4.8 store in Manjuelong. It was really hard to describe! I decided to eat at An Yu on the second night. Not only was the taste good, but the service and presentation were also top-notch. The fruits were fresh and the snacks were not too sweet. The babies loved them.
If I have some suggestions, I hope the store can install a brighter light as an alternative for some customers. It’s too dark and sometimes things can’t be seen clearly~
Finally, thank you to the store. Our autumn trip to Hangzhou ended perfectly~

The custom-made solid wood furniture demonstrates quality, with the seats being the finishing touch, and many vintage pieces being a tasteful choice. In addition to Evian, the water products also include Hupao Spring water. The toiletries use Le Labo No. 33 sandalwood fragrance, which is consistent with the temperament. The free carry-on canvas bag contains sunscreen, mosquito repellent, wet wipes, handkerchiefs, and even umbrellas, sunglasses, and masks, which Aman Qiushui Zixuan cannot compare to.
The exquisite service is even more impressive. It follows you like a shadow, but it is invisible. If you are too enthusiastic, you will be reserved if you are less. It is just right. Free laundry, free power banks, free afternoon tea, free dinner, and parting gifts are no different from staying in Japanese hot springs.
The terrain is also good, with four wells and deep alleys. It has both the a**osphere of books and fireworks. The West Lake is full of tigers and can be walked anywhere.
Looking forward to visiting again.

Although I was not satisfied with the view outside the room window, I couldn't help but be curious to know about the ultimate stay experience that almost all guests praised. So I still booked this hotel.

Facts have proved: this is a hotel that far exceeds expectations!


Service: I studied hotel management in Switzerland and worked at Four Seasons in Hangzhou. I have stayed in many luxury hotels and am still amazed by the hotel service of this brand! The service of every employee is attentive, meticulous, and very kind and natural. The level of detail in the service is amazing and so appropriate, making people very comfortable and at ease. If I want to recall which services left a deep impression, then I would need to write a short article of more than 5,000 words to recall... I highly recommend travelers to experience it for themselves, it is really worth it!


Facilities: The subtle fragrance of wood in the room complements the wooden home design and can calm the mind. The supplies are equipped to reflect the hotel's taste and sincerity: Dyson hair dryers, le labo toiletries, and I even planted a lot of small things that the hotel prepared for guest rooms and public areas. Whatever you can think of or what you can't think of, the hotel has thoughtfully prepared corresponding items in the right place.

Catering: Breakfast and afternoon tea really exceeded expectations, both in richness and deliciousness. We did not choose to have dinner at the hotel. Firstly, because our schedule was too busy, returning to the hotel for dinner would conflict with our schedule. Secondly, we were sure that we would definitely return to this hotel again in the future and leave something to look forward to next time.

❌The only drawback is that the room lighting is dim and the sound insulation is relatively poor. Since the back of the hotel is close to the Siyanjing parking lot, the gate will make a sound every time a car comes in and out. When there is a lot of people in the scenic area, the horn sound will be louder. It is recommended to improve the sound insulation of the glass in the room.

In addition, I would like to thank the hotel staff for their assistance. I also left a wonderful memory of being "proposed" here!

🏡From the moment I entered the hotel door, I couldn’t control myself and was really taking pictures all the time🥹Everywhere is super beautiful, and I can’t tell which style it is. It has more connotations than wabi-sabi, and is younger than new Chinese style One point, it is more stable than the Japanese style, and slightly lighter than the European and American style. These elements are available in Anyu, but it skillfully integrates the advantages of all styles into a whole. Even the color of the fire hydrant is consistent with the overall tone of the hotel. Consistent, I have to admire the designer's aesthetics and ingenuity.
	
🚿The details in the room are actually the key factor in my decision to praise An Yu loudly. The open cabinet at the entrance is integrated with the tea table, and the moving lines are reasonable; the small items such as lelabo and Dyson in the shower room make people feel at home. What I like the most is the shower head and faucet, which are of high-grade and delicate texture. The shape is also very good-looking, and it is easy to use🥹In short, there are many details in the room that are very worthy of reference for home decoration!
	
🍵Afternoon tea and breakfast are provided to residents free of charge. The exquisite content of the two meals is simply jaw-dropping. Ginseng millet porridge tastes very good🫶🏻

The fruit at the cafeteria in the restaurant is unlimited and available all the time. Blueberry players are crazy about eating blueberries🫐 mango, mangosteen and kiwifruit. This kind of fruit has to be picked and given to the young lady. She will help to cut it carefully and deliver it, very meticulous. ~
	
👭The service is also worthy of the name of Haidilao in the hotel class. The ladies are very considerate and gentle, with various detailed explanations and greetings anytime and anywhere. They also gave souvenirs when they left💛
	
As a new internet celebrity produced by a domestic designer, I really can’t pick out any flaws in Anyu (if I have to be picky, maybe the sound insulation in the room is not so good

msg:Environment: On Hupao Road, not far away is Prince Bay Park. The surrounding environment is very good. It is very comfortable to go for a walk after dinner in the evening.

Service: The service is really good. It can be regarded as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Everyone is very welcoming. When I left, I said I liked the hotel's canvas bag and gave me a canvas bag. It also gave me an umbrella when it rained.

Breakfast: The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The fruit buffet is of good quality👍

Facilities: But there are also some dissatisfaction points: First of all, the privacy of the room is not very good. The door faces the restaurant. If the curtains are not drawn, the inside of the room is completely exposed. With the curtains drawn, it is difficult to enjoy the outside scenery. Then there is the glass door in the bathroom. The switch makes a loud noise. I hope the hotel can repair it, but the water pressure is still sufficient. The water pressure for flushing the toilet is too high, and it will splash if you don't pay attention. This is quite annoying.

All in all, the service is excellent and the environment is also very good. There are some minor issues with privacy and facilities, but overall it is very good.

We communicated the location in advance, helped with luggage, thoughtful and considerate service, and the Japanese-style soft and hard decoration of the hotel, which has the feeling of a Japanese-style family homestay. From the decoration and arrangement of the tableware to the clothes of the waiters, Everything fits well, it's simply pleasing to the eye, and the room is very comfortable in the style of a Japanese family. The room on the first floor opens the sliding door. No matter it is sunny or rainy, it is a beautiful scenery. The room is thoughtful and provides sunglasses, sunscreen, and umbrellas for going out, washing and washing The supplies are le labo, which tastes great, which matches the hotel very well.
The food and beverages are even better. The welcome tea and refreshments at check-in are very good. The complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast are excellent in terms of ingredients and presentation. Because there are only me and the child, I only ate fried rice and soup for dinner in the restaurant. , but the portion size and taste are great. Fruits are available 24 hours a day, and warm milk and steam eye masks are provided thoughtfully for sleeping. The children are so comfortable that they fall asleep immediately.
It is very considerate to provide laundry service. It is very useful for me to travel abroad for a week. I don't have to drag a pile of dirty clothes when traveling, which is great!
After checking out, I specially helped to print the photos I liked and put them in the photo frame. I also added a set of tea sets. I also thoughtfully asked the children if they need to prepare some fruits to eat on the road. Before leaving, the driver passed by and helped carry them. The luggage was sent to the car before leaving. It was so thoughtful. I must stay in this super hotel next time👍🏻

The room is full, the facilities are full, and the service is full. Feel at home. Moreover, dining in this hotel is also a gourmet journey. The breakfast and afternoon tea are exquisite, and the self-service fruit is thoughtfully cut, which doubles the favor! It was also a surprise to have dinner at the hotel, it was delicious and the portion was generous.
Besides, the location of the hotel is very convenient! This kind of convenience is not the kind of convenience that comes out of the subway, but it is really convenient if you plan to spend a few days in Manjuelong, Four Eyes Well, Yuhuwan, Lingyin Temple, Hangzhou Zoo and other areas! Stayed here for three nights, the most beautiful scenic spots in the West Lake, and the surrounding Internet celebrity check-in points can be easily reached.

The first time I met An Yu, I had a strong sense of design, mostly using wood as the main part, and the Japanese-style courtyard
With warm lighting, it is comfortable and warm.
The room is very well equipped, especially the hygiene is very good. The floor can be said to be stain-free. After staying in so many hotels, only An Yu can walk barefoot with confidence. The free minibar is also very nice and equipped with good brands.
The service is also very good. The ladies are soft-spoken, warm and thoughtful. You can eat the fruits in the restaurant freely. Every time you go out, the ladies are very enthusiastic to remind you that you can take out the fruits. The fruits at the buffet are all good fruits and unlimited. Self-service is really very bold. There is also a laundry service, which is so considerate, and the washed clothes are neatly folded.
The breakfast and afternoon tea are particularly exquisite and exquisite. The breakfast is so rich and delicious. It was a really enjoyable day in Anyu. It's still worth the experience.

I really like it both from the design and the experience. The most important thing is to be able to see the hotel's intentions. The first time you encounter a hotel, you will considerately prepare cotton face towels, band-aids, sunscreen isolation, parasols, and sunglasses for each guest. Even the bathrooms are prepared with disposable bathtub covers and toilet wipes. Also, the breakfast is really delicious, the best hotel breakfast I've ever had! You can taste the taste of handmade and not pre-made dishes. In addition, all the toiletries are my favorite Le Labo and Dyson hair dryer 🥹! No matter, I really love it so much, I really hope there are Anyu all over the country😭

It can be said that it is a beautiful hotel that cooks delicious food with heart. The breakfast is amazing
It is recommended that the design and service of the hotel be so attentive, but it is still necessary to work hard on the hardware. The most basic thing for the hotel is to achieve sound insulation. The sound insulation is really bad

The low-key door has an extraordinary temperament, and the Founder's courtyard is accompanied by mountains
Reception hall and restaurant share space, decorated with medieval furniture and utensils
The simple texture reveals the subtle beauty, and the high-level sense is self-evident.

The light and shadow of the window railing flow at night, quiet and romantic
Standard LE LABO shower, Dyson hair dryer, Bose speaker, etc.
The accompanying canvas bag is thoughtfully prepared with GM sunglasses, sunscreen, umbrellas, wet wipes, etc. Fruits, mineral water and sparkling water are free and unlimited. Good service is never a big fanfare, but a real moisturising, impressing guests in the details.

Breakfast is a combination of buffet table, set menu and Western-style a la carte
Specially developed soups (abalone with five grains, abalone, ginseng, wing and belly soup), six side dishes and optional staple food
Exquisitely presented, rich enough to fit on a table!
It can be said that it is the best match in the hotel I have stayed in so far!
It is more exquisite than the set meal in Sanya Anyu!
-
Afternoon tea is also a complimentary stay
Sister sends boyfriend to hotel to meet
The housekeeper arranged for two more cups of tea, and there is no need to charge extra tea seat fees, the main focus is a caring a**osphere! Gifts and photo frames will be given before leaving.
-
From check-in to check-out, the service experience beyond expectations made me never forget this niche hotel. If there is Anyu in the city you are visiting, then Anyu is the first choice!
-
You can walk around to eat, drink and have fun
There are also many restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and the environment is very good.

Although the back kitchen couldn't serve meals at the time, the front desk still managed to serve us two beef noodles for breakfast. so warm!
To be honest, if it is not the highest five stars for this service, it can be rated as ten stars. The only downside is the poor soundproofing, but the service makes up for it!

衞生：進門的第一感覺就是好乾凈好整潔，看的出來衞生標準非常高了，這個暖色系燈光下衹能説打掃房間的阿姨確實是用心了👍


服務：最後讓我最印象深刻的就是服務，服務真的是細緻入微，温柔體貼，非常的專業且讓人覺得舒服，每個服務人員見面都是笑臉相迎，一早見面看到她們的笑容，都能感染到你真的很厲害🥰🥰最後非常感謝Monica zada CoCo這幾天的用心服務和照顧，其他的服務人員也很好，怪我記不住這麼多名字，沒事下次還會回來哦🫶🏻
還有酒店的餐食非常棒👍🏻，早餐下午茶和晚餐都很好吃，並且早餐真的是我吃過的酒店早餐最豐盛的啦，推薦都來嘗一嘗安隅的早餐👍👍👍

msg:想給這家民宿打100顆星！無敵無敵無敵好！衹有客人想不到，沒有他們做不到的事情。客人能想到的，酒店已經幫客人都想好了。全家已經決定以後跟着安隅去旅行了。隨便講幾點，環境非常清幽，安靜，一樓有個小院子，非常出片，很適合拍照；早餐款式豐富，小菜到主食道水果都非常精彩，而且每天變着花樣在照顧客人的肚子，下午茶同樣精彩，蛋糕看得出來是認真在做的，水果也是款式豐富，正餐雖然選擇不多，但是道道精彩，廚師團隊真的用心了；再説説房間，全部地暖，也很寬敞，非常乾淨，依雲水隨便你喝，洗浴用品用的是實驗室33，還有濕巾提供，我們家真的是還蠻吹毛求疵的人羣了，在這裏挑不出一點毛病，服務員小哥小姐姐態度無敵無敵的好，臨行前知道我們要坐車去另外一個地方，還幫我們準備水和水果，説句實在的，大幾千元一晚的五星級酒店都做不到這樣。如果實在要講缺點的話，就是房間燈光相對暗了一點，不過應該是跟整體裝修風格掛鈎的，這真的是雞蛋裡挑骨頭了。下次去杭州還會住這家民宿！

設施：酒店設計十分用心，住起來很方便。適合I人，保證了絕對的私密性。唯一不足是隔音稍微差了一點。好在住店客人都比較安靜。

衞生：很乾凈。

環境：酒店坐落在西湖四眼井附近，離馬路有點距離，聽不見馬路的聲音，從酒店出發去西湖或者靈隱寺都很方便。

服務：服務滿分，賓至如歸的體驗。我們很早就要出發去景點，酒店會準備外帶早餐，離開會打印一份照片，對杭州的好印象也因為安隅的入住體驗而增色不少。

衞生：因為底樓，所以可能會有點潮濕，噴了精油味道消散了，夏天入住要注意防蚊。。山裡的🦟太可惡了。

解決方案是換另一家酒店，在我不同意這個方案的情況下，拖了差不多2小時才聯繫我，我衹能換行程，先去吃飯。
換的是相宜粧園，環境還可以，但是服務一般般、下午茶沒用上、位置也距離西湖遠了。

安隅的精緻都在細節裏，洗浴用品和生活用品的準備秒殺同類目boutique hotel。入住的託特包裏贈送的防蚊噴霧真的是在這一路救了我大命哈哈～
七夕入住，安隅還準備了花和巧克力。太可愛了。

msg:回程兩天終於想好要把這家酒店推薦給大家
第一次住一家酒店讓自己覺得樂在其中
服務態度説是行業天花板也不為過
每個夥伴精緻乾淨的粧容和時刻的微笑真的很感染人
安隅安隅 偏安一隅
杭州這家安隅在虎跑路上
一條鬱鬱葱葱 充滿陽光氣息的路
光在這條路上就已經覺得安靜快樂
入則寧靜 出則致遠
很適合描述這裏
公區桌與桌之間都有間隔
光影打下來的時候真的特別漂亮
在這個空間裏整個人都是安靜的
房間包含免費洗衣 下午茶和早餐
公區還有全天候的新鮮水果
最喜歡的是休息室 足夠放鬆和自由
洗護是le labo  吹風是戴森 還配了洗臉巾和一次性指甲剪 不要太快樂！
早餐很豐盛營養
下午茶品類也很多
退房時打印了照片 做成相框送給我們  伴手禮是白瓷蓋碗
因為喜歡帆布袋 還特別給我多放了兩個 真的超級開心
因為飛機很晚 在大廳休息 前台小姐姐在聽到我們要開始打車的時候 主動過來問需不需要打包水果帶在飛機上吃
同樣作為服務行業的從業者 我真的沒有找到任何讓我不滿意的地方
大家去杭州 真的要考慮這裏 很值得 ！

餐食都很美味，晚餐也在此解決了，魚頭很想念🥰
安隅的室內很出片，下次要預約雲南。
地理位置也很好，步行去西湖邊、虎跑、滿覺隴很方便。
提個建議，小程序公眾號抓緊建設，可以直接訂房積分。

缺點很明顯，隔音不好，第一個晚上很安靜，第二晚小孩就能聽到隔壁很明顯的打鬧聲。
優點很多，一是地理位置，在四眼井，往下走的一路上風景都特別特別好，滿眼的翠綠，酒店100米處有很多吃飯的地方，而且評分都還不錯。試了一家西餐廳，很好吃！二是服務，服務特別好，有求必應。大堂有24小時各種水果（我去的時候是人蔘果、荔枝王）和茶飲供應，上樓梯的地方有礦泉水隨心取。房間裏配了2瓶依雲， 2瓶虎跑山的礦泉水。三是吃的特別好，酒店的早餐和下午茶都非常好吃！四是酒店裝修很有意境，房間裏的花瓶實在太美啦！
下次有空還會來住～

🌴
地理位置非常優越，就在西湖附近！
在山上，周圍綠樹成蔭，可以欣賞到得天獨厚的山景。出租車可以開到門口，會有禮賓人員來接行李！
附近有很多家杭州特色的飯館，西湖醋魚等等菜品應有盡有。
交通非常方便，去到各個熱門景點都很便利！

🧑🏻💼👩🏻💼
酒店服務人員非常熱情專業。在我們入住之前就添加了微信，確認抵達時間並且準時在門口接我們。
進門服務我們的是一個小哥哥服務態度非常好，所有的事情都可以耐心的為我們解答。在等待房間打掃的過程中還給為我們提供了滇紅。味道非常不錯，脣齒留香！

🏠
酒店非常有設計感，我們定的是一樓的庭院房型，區別於普通酒店的房卡，做的是非常精緻的鑰匙！拿在手裡沉甸甸的很有分量，每天拉開窗簾就可以看見優美的庭院景色。
房間裏整體偏昏暗的侘寂風，長者覺得有點不夠明亮了！但年輕人住着剛剛好哈哈哈，很有氛圍感！

🥘🥨
特別值得一提的
是早餐和下午茶。
早餐是半自助的形式，第一天第二天分別是遼參和鮑魚。烹飪的很不錯火候恰到好處，調味也很特別！
米粉是我喜歡的，牛肉粉連着吃了兩天。
還有梅菜餅三文魚等等，三文魚是煙燻的，但能吃出很新鮮。常規的蔬菜沙拉無功無過，體驗很好！
下午茶是免費贈送的，有很多道甜品，精美又好吃，還未長者提供了熱牛奶，表達感謝！
長者和孩子都表示下午茶很合口。

🧡
最感動的就是退房的那天了！
退房之後在門口等車，服務姐姐堅持要幫我們把行李推到山下，並且給我們裝上了滿滿一盒水果！非常感謝，非常暖心。安隅真的做到讓每個客人在異鄉也感受到家的温暖！

最後，非常推薦安隅酒店，下次去杭州的首選還會是這裏！🧡

在很多要求中都配合很好
1）充電寶是免費的，退房後忘了換，如果時間超時產生99元的按金費用會退給我。
2）到店迎接，告訴我們快到時候他們會出門接我們。
3）小朋友早餐想吃清湯麪，去問廚房安排廚房煮好來。
4）小朋友口罩前台也有
5）晚上加被子也很快拿來。
服務的小姐姐們素質很高。
早點、設計都很多細節到位。

説一下不足的地方，這個可能是每個安隅的通病，隔音不好，但凡隔壁或樓上有一點吵鬧聲就能聽得真真切切。另外，房間沒有配備香皂，因為不是每個人都喜歡用沐浴露的。

msg:《略有誠意，但不多》
這家作為杭州之旅入住的第三家（柏悦和虎跑之後），我非常希望我能enjoy，尤其在歡迎茶水搭配的芡實糕還挺好吃之後。然而非常遺憾，這家酒店是我這種潔癖旅客的終極噩夢。
*以下感想來自於我對比同價位的住宿體驗（2k rmb）

設施：👎🏽
1）風格自成一派，總體設計風格不過多點評，酒店公共區域還是十分出片的。然而浴室設計（圖4⃣️）實在貼近當下的“敍利亞農村土房風”，看起來就像年久失修的老茅廁
2）燈光過於昏暗，燈光極暖，浴室基本半瞎狀態，女生無法化粧的程度。其實設計師完全可以做成旋轉調整式燈光，客人如有需求，可以調亮。同時我認為如此昏暗的燈光，非常不利於年過半百的打掃阿姨清潔。
3）房內每一個插頭都非常的難插（圖3⃣️），我不知道是否是供應商或是採購出了問題，但每次使用都要費九牛二虎之力（還要保證不弄斷）
4）酒店沒有電梯，心疼幫我搬行李和打掃的阿姨，實在是客服人員長者小孩不友好
5）洗護用品並未準備，我也沒有提醒，拿出了柏悦酒店帶的lelabo（圖5⃣️），希望店家注意

衞生：👎🏽
噩夢來源，掀起被單就是捲曲的毛髮和shi了很久的小蜘蛛（圖1⃣️），很難想象這樣明顯的臟污是如何在新鋪完的床單後留下？🤢
其次就是廁所地板，拿出體重計的時候順帶扯出了一坨女生毛髮，（圖2⃣️）同時也有毛髮卡住水池邊緣（水池設計也是有問題的洗臉水會一直漏在枱麪）

第一次解決：打了電話之後，打掃阿姨進來，態度很好，非常瀟灑的把毛髮用手撥到地上，把蜘蛛卷在舊床單裏，鋪上了新的全套。潔癖如我，呆坐半晌之後，在攜程上退房了。
第二次解決：退房後的15分鐘後，小姐姐帶着水果上來賠禮道歉，阿姨帶着拖布來把房間的地板簡單地清理。
主要解決方案：小姐姐隨後提出房費八五折，因為房費已付，需要在攜程上取消該訂單，退房時現場付款，如果我接受八五折，這就意味着我無法在攜程的平台上進行評價。考慮了一夜後，遂放棄，畢竟攜程的百分百好評實在是缺乏參考價值和客觀性。

環境：❓
如圖7⃣️8⃣️9⃣️，還是非常出片的，適合有拍攝需求的媒體工作者。

服務：👍🏽
所有的打掃阿姨小姐姐都熱情好客，服務都非常好，都很好打交道。可惜酒店各種的設計缺陷和人員培訓不到位而導致了此次的重大失誤（在我看來）。空缺的電梯和昏暗的燈光都不利於服務人員進行作業。

最後，
經濟下行和政策壓力，旅客對酒店的容錯率會降低，不衹有酒店方才需精打細算，大家也需要來自真實住店旅客直觀且客觀的評價（除了xhs等平台的百分百出片擺拍好評和軟廣）
最後的最後，
如果您愛西湖的便利和出片遠大於衞生，便可以考慮入住，畢竟服務的阿姨和小姐姐都十分不錯。
🙏🏻

整個酒店的感覺還是跟三亞店有些不一樣🐼 桌椅器物都更加有小時候記憶裏觸摸過的感覺😎 庭院裏的植物也各有姿態的在自然舒展 上樓梯的間隙 也有温暖的光線在腳下指引 一陣風拂面而過 能清晰地聞到或濃或淡的桂花香氣 是深秋應該有的姿態了~~~很是喜愛👍👍👍~~~安隅的空間彷彿就是有這樣的魔力 讓人靜下來好好閉目休息 深呼吸 深度感受身邊的一切美好~~~💤💤💤

小夥伴們都很好 親切温柔有禮貌 我們出門進門都是真誠的笑臉相迎 離開的時候 稍微有點小下雨 更是囑託我們注意行車安全和保暖~~~so sweet🎁🎁🎁

msg:之前住過安隅的三亞店，一直想再去一次，不過一直滿房訂不到，看到杭州安隅開了，就立馬預訂了，不得不説，安隅真的很會選位置，杭州安隅位於虎跑路上，在四眼井附近，離西湖很近，感覺所有的工作人員都是精挑細選過的，給人感覺很温柔很舒服，進到房間裏面，還是一樣熟悉的木質感，加上淡淡的香薰，很舒服，秋天的杭州，空氣中都是桂花的香味，中庭地白樹棲鴉，冷露無聲濕桂花， 今夜月明人盡望，不知秋思落誰家。 靜謐，典雅，不管是哪裡的安隅都能讓你感受到心靈的放空，自然的魅力，服務就更不用説了，還是一樣的恰到好處，關注到我所有的需要卻不會過份打擾，希望安隅多開幾家店，這樣去其他城市也可以入住安隅啦～

這次和男朋友一起去住了🌟杭州安隅，之前就一直在小紅薯🍠上刷到三亞安隅，被種草蠻久了，完全超過我的預期！
先説安隅的服務吧，就是那種暖暖的♥️很貼心！我住的那兩天穿了一雙新鞋就有點磨腳後跟，走路不太舒服，店員小姐姐很細心地發現了，主動給我遞上碘伏和創口貼，咱們就是説，雙魚座真的永遠會被細節打動✨
然後就是早餐，因為之前就知道安隅的早餐是天花板的存在，但是還是有被驚喜，擺盤好看高顏值而且還份量實在好吃~
下次有機會我還會來安隅躺平的❣️

msg:第一次住安隅酒店，實在是太驚喜了太驚喜了！！！
不管是房間風格還是早餐下午茶還是他們的管家服務，無一不讓我感覺到非常用心～
一：酒店的位置：位置非常好，靠近西湖風景區，附近可以步行到滿覺隴（現在到處都可以聞到桂花香😄），然後騎車去太子灣公園，西湖，雷峯塔都很近
二酒店服務：酒店是有24小時的管家服務的，工作人員很熱情（真的有被受重視的感覺），有任何需要真的很用心的響應我幫我去解決～
三用餐：不管是早餐還是下午茶我真的太喜歡了！！！是我住過的所有酒店裡最好吃的！！！真的很好吃啊，種類很豐富，上的水果也很新鮮，小甜點也非常合我的口味
四房間：房間風格也是我喜歡的，房間用的暖光，傢俱也都是實木傢俱（很有腔調啊💐），我定的是大床房，大的落地門，前面就是小庭院，拍照也很出片，很有感覺。雖然在一樓，但是隔音非常可以啊，不會吵的～
總之，安隅是我今年住過的最温馨也最用心的酒店～～～

酒店地理位置不錯，周邊都是景點，而且前台小姐姐給介紹了一些小眾的景點，非常感謝。
酒店空間的光影效果太棒了，燈光基本都是暖色調的，樹影印在牆上跟油畫一樣，室內的光線也特別立體，配上實木傢俱，質感一流。衹可惜手機拍不出眼見的光影效果，衹能現場感受。而且整體氛圍非常舒服，播放的音樂和閲讀室裏的書一看就是精挑細選過的，有一種讓人慢下來的力量，我竟然在閲讀室裏喝着茶看完了一整本影集。
還有不得不提的服務，讓我第一次對“無微不至”這個詞有了這麼具體的感受。出門有隨行包，裝着墨鏡、防曬、雨傘、紙巾，用餐可以送到房間，甚至吃個水果都能選擇要硬一點的還是軟一點的。我這個人比較認床，他們給我提供了四種枕頭來選，我還能説什麼呢，下次再來住吧！

msg:房間很好，住過大理和三亞的安隅，這是酒店的服務給住客的安全感選擇，因為住過才會選擇在杭州的安隅試試，提前一天溝通過確認住宿需要三點後才可以入住，並且也溝通過蝦過敏，但是晚餐還是蝦仁蒸蛋（雖然廚房有提出進行更換）但其實我們是屬於很好説話的人也沒有再麻煩餐品更換。第二天早上有朋友過來，也是單獨又買了一份早餐，還是一樣的問題……這個我真的很不理解，明明有告知海鮮類過敏，但我們還是也算了，OK，直到退房的時候，明明也已經説過了1點走，12點半打電話催我們説住客已經到了，那麼請問是衹有和我們説是下午3點以後才能入住，對其他客人隨意嗎，真的不滿意吧
