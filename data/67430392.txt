msg:1. Service - was very good all round from housekeeping to F & B , concierge and front desk/ reception.
2.Facilities - the swimming pool and changing rooms were clean and well maintained. Did not use the steam and sauna rooms.
3. The food could have been more tasty and not hot or kept hot. The variety of food for the breakfast buffet was a good spread. The Chinese Restaurant was ok but lacked options for smaller parties/single diner. All day menu at the cafe did not have many dishes offered on the menu such as char koay teow, Thai food etc.
4. The whole hotel may appear to be spread out from the photos but as a resident, I happily found out that all the buildings were all seamlessly connected and within short walking distances from each other..
5.I found the front office managers namely Nancy, Karry and Vivien to be excellent service providers who went out of their way to assist me in booking tickets, advising on attractions such  as the Panda Research Center and booking taxis for me and my wife. They really made my stay in Chengdu very enjoyable!

One word. Exceptional. 

The hotel is so beautiful and stunning with smell of osmanthus tree as soon as you walk out. 

Room is new, clean and full of amenities. With nice balcony area. Bed is the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on having stayed at so many 5 star hotels all around the world. Amazing!

Service is top tier. The staff is so polite and welcoming to attend to your needs. One of the best service I’ve ever received. On mid autumn festival they gave mooncakes for free too!

Food is delicious too. Lots of options with 3 restaurants for you to choose from. 

On my way to the airport I left a shirt in the closet and they offered to send it back to me for free! Such amazing service 

I will definitely be coming back here again and again! Thank you gran melia for your amazing hospitality and kind actions!

The luxurious and well-appointed rooms provided a perfect blend of comfort and elegance. The hotel's facilities, including the spa and fitness center, were top-notch and added to our relaxation. Dining at their restaurants was a culinary delight, offering a variety of delectable dishes that catered to different palates. The central location of the hotel made it convenient for us to explore the city's attractions. Without a doubt, Gran Melia Hotel exceeded our expectations and made our stay in Chengdu truly unforgettable. We can't wait to return for another exceptional stay!

msg:Excellent service from check-in to check-out. Credits to Clouds, who is the manager of the executive suites floor, and Nancy, who oversees the front desk. 

Location is not in city centre, but precisely what i like about this hotel. Sitting right next to one of the main recreation parks in Chengdu, with access to main highways within minutes of drive. Could be slightly difficult to hail a ride during rush hours, but otherwise all fine. 20mins ish back to Chengdu down town without traffic. 

Brand new building, and hygiene is well maintained (they even called to ask do i need my room cleaned while i was away as i have turned on the no disturb signal light). A bit of leakage from the the shower with water flowing into the toilet area, but this is a minor issue. Amenities were great, especially the balcony. 

Customers attracted to the hotel are well behaved and quiet, providing a relaxing ambience to the hotel. 

One recommendation however, would be great if we can have a proper bar area, ideally next to the nice garden, providing light food, easy drinks such as beers and cocktails. 

Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family.

So I come here almost every month. This time I booked a suite again. Xiao Jiang in the executive lounge was very enthusiastic. She arranged the room equipment, dog equipment, children's products, tea, evening snacks, and breakfast from the moment I booked the room. She was very welcoming. My child got up late, so the breakfast in the executive lounge was also delayed. She and a beautiful lady from another hotel helped me get a lot of delicious food for my child and put it on the table. My child was very happy eating. When I checked out, she also helped me with my luggage and sent it to the car. The service was really good. My child said, you must write a good review for me! I said, of course... I randomly picked a few photos of me staying in the same room twice

The hotel not only has a beautiful environment and is quiet in the bustling city, but also has Jincheng Lake Park next to it, so the air is also good, which is very suitable for walking in the park in the morning and evening. I basically recommend this hotel to my friends who come to Chengdu. The hotel staff are all very nice, especially the beautiful lady at the front desk who knew my birthday and specially decorated the room, which is very humane.

msg:The hardware is excellent, the greenery is very good... The room is quiet, the breakfast is also rich... But the service is really bad overall, very unstable... The door reception, front desk, guest room, restaurant, etc.
I have stayed in many hotels, and the service is at the level of a hotel that costs 200 or 300 yuan, or even less... When I first arrived at the hotel, the driver took down the suitcase, and the door service staff ignored me and didn't even say a word. When I entered the lobby to check in, I had to take the initiative to say hello. After checking in, no one took me to the room. When I walked a third of the way, they reminded me how to go and pay attention to which building... There were three women at the counter next to me. They asked me to take the guests to the room, but none of them responded. Is this the service level that a star-rated hotel should have? Usually when I walked to the hotel, I met all the service staff and none of them took the initiative to say hello. I have stayed in the most speechless luxury hotel... The room is equipped with a refrigerator, which is empty.
I have to say that the greenery, environment, hardware, and hygiene of the hotel are still good, but the service is really bad.

msg:After returning home and resting for almost a week, I finally had enough energy to write a review. Traveling with children is really tiring, but fortunately the hotel I chose exceeded my expectations, especially when we encountered the heavy rain in Shenzhen on May 4th and several flights were cancelled. Fortunately, it was at Gran Melia, and Ada and her team made arrangements with all their heart and soul, so that we could spend a day stranded in Chengdu with peace of mind.

I am usually a person who doesn't like to comment, and I always refuse to give gifts when I encounter good reviews. But this time I specially wrote a review, not only because Ada and her sisters' service is really commendable, but also I want to recommend it to parents traveling with children. This is really a low-key treasure hotel.

In the afternoon of the day before check-in, I received a call from Ada, asking about the details of the trip, paying special attention to the children's situation, understanding their age, preferences, and needs, and taking the initiative to make a lot of welcome preparations, such as bed guards, cribs, and supplies. Needless to say, we were in another resort hotel at the time, and there were so many people. I was immediately moved by Ada's proactive service and decided to change hotels early the next day.

I exchanged WeChat with Ada, and we kept communicating before and after check-in. I was always available to respond to any needs. During my stay, I was very satisfied with the hotel's environment. The garden-style hotel is a good place for babies to have fun. Next to the hotel is Jincheng Lake Park. Every afternoon after we woke up and ate fruit in the lounge, we went for a walk by the lake and saw many locals like to come here. At the beginning, I listened to the recommendation of a friend and booked the room type of Shengshi Hongge. My friend said that the service was super value, and it turned out to be true. All the services were positive and proactive. Our two children quickly became familiar with the sisters and strolled around the garden like they were in their own restaurant every day.

The restaurant's catering is also quite good. Because it is a Spanish brand, Spanish characteristics can also be seen in ordinary buffets and Western food, such as Spanish dough sticks for breakfast. And their Spanish restaurant is also very famous in the city. We arranged a dinner this time and were instantly amazed. Although it seems that the price is relatively high, the double set meal is 798 yuan, but the variety is rich, the ingredients are fresh, and the taste is well prepared, which is highly recommended. I said that the taste even exceeded the product of a top luxury hotel I liked in Shenzhen. After all, that hotel was more Tapas, while the Gran Melia was a formal restaurant with a wider selection.

I was really satisfied with this hotel. My husband and I agreed that it was the ceiling of parent-child and lounge services among all the hotels we have stayed in. The quality of parent-child services here is not reflected in the richness of children's toys and activities (of course, they also have what they should have), but in the delicacy and attentiveness of the services. Only those who have experienced it can feel it. I praised this hotel while staying there, and praised it countless times in chats with friends, and took a few pictures at random.

When leaving, the child said, I can't bear to leave, I still want to stay here. The sister in the lounge said, welcome to come back next time. The child said, OK, I will stay for 100 days next time!

Goodbye, my favorite city and favorite hotel. See you later.

msg:What can I say? The front desk didn't help me carry my luggage when I checked in with two babies. They asked me to get an extra set of yellow duck toiletries. They looked unhappy (they finally got it). When booking the room, I asked what I needed to prepare for swimming with my baby. The hotel said it was free as long as I stayed in the hotel. After checking in, they said I had to get a swimming cap. I asked how much the hotel sold it. It seemed to be 189 each, and it was about 600 for three people. I thought it was unnecessary to buy it for one use, so I went upstairs to ask a girl who looked like a manager. She said, didn't the hotel sell it? I said it was expensive, I would buy it outside. I saw it clearly, she smiled with a fake smile, and said she didn't know where to buy it nearby. Oh my god! ! ! The most critical thing was at 10:30 in the evening. I had just coaxed the two babies to sleep, and someone quarreled in the hotel lobby and woke up the babies. I quickly called the front desk and asked them to lower their voices and not call back later because I was afraid that the phone would be loud. After a while, I coaxed them to sleep, and the front desk called me and said sorry, they were dealing with it. Thank you. The ringing woke me up again. I can't recall this five-star hotel! But the next day, someone opened the elevator for me. Later, a manager called me and listened to my complaints. I felt much better. How can I describe it? Anyway, I stayed in a star hotel for so long, and that night made me nervous.

There are staff in the lobby to help with luggage. Knowing that we are from Inner Mongolia, Xiao Zhang and Xiao Gong also helped us upgrade the room type for free and sent 2 breakfasts. They are so friendly. As soon as we checked in, we were given fruit 🍉 We brought our children with us and asked for a small yellow duck children's toothpaste.
The breakfast was particularly rich. You can see Jincheng Lake and the Global Center when you eat in the restaurant. The scenery is first-class.
After breakfast, we went to the swimming pool. The children wanted to swim in the swimming pool and had a lot of fun.
Overall, this hotel exceeded our expectations. You can come to the hotel to play all day, comfortable and relaxing.
The environment is beautiful and pleasant, with a garden-style landscape. My husband loves this kind of hotel the most

First of all, it's been a long time. From my personal experience, the dishes have really improved a lot. They no longer pursue the Spanish style of the hotel itself, but have more staple foods. The waiter will also ask you which one you like and whether you want another one.
There's nothing to say about the room. It's very clean and you can't tell that it has been open for several years.
The layout is very delicate, and the fruit plate is also very delicate.

I had lunch in a Spanish restaurant, the service attitude was good, and the dishes were okay. Overall, I want to give it four stars, and the extra star is for the service staff🤣

msg:Let me start with the conclusion. I highly recommend it!

There was a power outage at home. I wanted to spend a night at the hotel with my wife. I didn't expect that the first stay at Shengmei was far beyond my expectations. I decided to stay for a few more days and didn't want to go home. The hotel is right by the lake, and the greening is well thought out. The environment is definitely the ceiling of the city's hotels. During our stay, we happened to run into business meetings of several companies. There were many people. I was worried that the service would not keep up, but it turned out not to be the case at all. The restaurant was not crowded at all, and the reception capacity was great.

I chose a suite with a lake view. The living room and the room each have a balcony that can directly see Jincheng Lake (the 3rd floor is better than the 2nd floor 👌🏻). The other hardware is worth the price. There are not many people in the lounge. It is still very pleasant to have some snacks and read in the courtyard. It's just that the mosquitoes outside are too fierce in this season, so I should prepare some mosquito repellent.

My wife had a lot of inconveniences in the late stage of pregnancy and was not feeling well. I had a great time staying at Shengmei these days❤️I would like to especially thank Megan from Shengshi Hongge, Sarah and Tom from the customer service depar**ent for their enthusiastic and thoughtful service. The other staff also took great care of us, so I would like to thank them all!

Jincheng Lake is right outside your door. It is very comfortable to have a parent-child moment while cycling around the lake with your children. On weekdays, there are also many people running and cycling by the lake for exercise. There are several commercial buildings such as Global Center and Youfang within two kilometers nearby, and the night view of the Financial City is also very beautiful.

It is far away from popular scenic spots, and the scenery is quiet. There is a subway less than one kilometer away, and it is convenient to take the Didi subway. I feel that people who live in these communities near the lake have a high sense of happiness. There are no people in the subway, and there are not many people on the road. You can usually camp and exercise by the lake. It only takes two kilometers to liven up. This is me Love the a**osphere of the area where I live!

If you don't want to go to those popular scenic spots and just want to be leisurely and comfortable, staying here is definitely the most suitable place.

I washed my baby's swimsuit and put it on the bathtub to dry. When I came back, I found that the cleaning staff had hung it up and set it up for me, which was very considerate!

Let’s talk about the advantages first: it’s close to Jincheng Lake, and it’s really nice to bask in the sun around the lake; the front desk and waiters are very nice and proactively say hello. Laundry service is very practical.
Disadvantage: I booked a terrace room, but the terrace is just a wall. This kind of room does not have to be turned into a terrace room. The sound insulation is poor, you can hear what the neighbors say. You have to go to the front desk to ask for the welcome fruits yourself, they are not placed in the room in advance.

Because I bought medicine for my child at night, I don’t want to meet a I was sent to the hotel entrance by a confused errand, but my child fell asleep and I couldn't get out. Xiao Tang was very helpful. He immediately mobilized the hotel staff to help me find the courier that was delivered to the wrong place by a confused errand, and got it to me as soon as possible. Delivered to the room thoughtfully. I’m really, really touched 😹. If possible, I would like to give her 100 likes. Although I have never met her, her 24-hour warm companionship made my trip to Chengdu very full. I will definitely stay at Meliá next time I come to Chengdu. It’s so great! , by the way, and thank you for thoughtfully preparing a fence for the children😘

The rooms are cutely decorated, and there are delicious birthday cakes and children. toiletries. Dry cleaning was also given as a gift, and the service lady enthusiastically gave us multiple bottles of mineral water. It’s very convenient to walk to Jincheng Lake from the hotel, but the smog in Chengdu has been so bad lately that I don’t dare to go outdoors.

msg:Facilities: This hotel has a full set of five-star facilities, including a gym, swimming pool, sauna, etc., and there are many restaurant facilities, in addition to the all-day breakfast room (the breakfast on the terrace of this restaurant is really great, you can laze in the sun in the morning) Eat breakfast and watch the lake view, amazing!), the breakfast is rich and tastes very good. There is also a Chinese restaurant and a Spanish restaurant. I tried the Spanish restaurant and it was okay. The recommendation is medium to high.
Hygiene: The room is very clean. Because I have children who crawl on the floor, I am worried that there will be problems with hygiene. My husband started to look carefully when he entered the room. He even looked under the cabinet and sofa. The carpets have also been treated, except for the bathroom. Because I was worried, I asked the waiter to help me disinfect again.

Environment: The environment is excellent. I dare say that no other hotel in Chengdu has a better environment than this hotel. The surrounding greenery is very good and it is close to Jincheng Lake. It is very beautiful. You can also hear the birds chirping in the morning. It is very comfortable. The room is very comfortable. It is recommended to book a terrace with a view of Jincheng Lake. When I went there recently, the hotel did not provide heating. The room facing the sun is really comfortable😌

Service: The service is very considerate, meticulous and warm. When the front desk manager Vivien observed that we had children, she thoughtfully helped arrange bed rails and more mineral water for making milk powder. She also arranged bath towels for the children. It was very cute and recommended. I also visited the Children’s Center, which was not suitable for my children’s age, but the VR and craft classes made me want to try it myself.

All in all, 100 points recommended! This hotel is worth it!

msg:The hotel is pet-friendly. It is located in the garden. The environment is very good and the service is good. However, the garden lounge only has beer, and there are no red wines, sparkling wines, etc. on the menu. It is a bit strange. In addition, the attitude towards dogs is generally good. , but the attitude is still a bit ambiguous. When I first took my dog ​​to sit on the outdoor seats in the Garden Lounge, I didn’t say no, but after sitting for a while, I said no dogs were allowed to sit, which made people feel bad. , but I still give it five points. I hope we can be more open to dogs and don’t make owners feel discriminated against. That would be perfect~

2⃣️As the price is 1,200 per night, the room is very small. But very clean. As a Spanish group hotel, the toiletries are very high-end, and there are also children's toiletries and slippers. This is very heartwarming.
3⃣️The service is particularly good. Especially the front desk sister Zhang Lin must be praised👍
4⃣️The third floor is the evening buffet. The buffet has private rooms with balconies. You need to book in advance. The buffet service is very good. It is very comfortable to enjoy the night view while dining at night. Breakfast the next day was also on the third floor, but there were not many breakfast varieties, and the meals were very Spanish.

The external environment of the hotel is beautiful and quiet, and the internal hardware decoration and facilities are fully consistent with its grade. The breakfast variety is rich and exquisite, and the dining environment is very comfortable. I would especially like to thank the front desk manager Gong Kun. When he learned that the guest's birthday was on the day of check-in, he not only immediately upgraded the room, but also specially arranged a birthday cake! It’s really heartwarming! Also, the restaurant manager Wang Na and the bellman Xiao Li in the lobby were very warm and thoughtful in their service. I would like to express my gratitude! I wish Shengmeilia will continue to maintain high-quality software and hardware services and have a prosperous business! Next time I come to Chengdu, I will choose you and recommend you to my friends!

I came here twice in two days and couldn’t care less about the hot pot. The service staff are basically friendly. It can be seen that the girls in the Spanish restaurant are sincerely proud of the restaurant. The waiter in the room left a warm note and gave us an eye mask when he saw that we had brought a lot of books. The breakfast manager The attitude of handling complaints is very sincere and professional, but the service attitude of the noodle stalls really needs to be improved. A person's unprofessionalism is not only disrespectful to the guests, but also disrespectful of the efforts of other team members. I hope the hotel can improve. Rewards and punishments are clear.

Every detail is meticulously crafted. The lobby is simple and a**ospheric, bright and warm. The corridor is also my favorite, and the glossiness of the stone maintenance is also in place😄 The room is decorated in Chinese style, and a Soviet-style embroidery painting in the living room is dignified and elegant, showing its unique charm. On the afternoon of the check-in day, I went to the lounge to taste the afternoon tea. The desserts 🍮 were not so greasy at the entrance, and all kinds of cookies 🍪 had strange shapes.
