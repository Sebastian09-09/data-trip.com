1. Located at a very convenient location with many restaurants and shops nearby
2. Service was good with every staff we encountered - all very polite and helpful
3. Buffet breakfast was amazing with lots of choices - particularly good for elderly parents
4. Wifi works for Instagram and WhatsApp 
5. Room is spacious and clean

The only one negative is that the rooms are not very sound proof

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦I came alone, but met up with a Family od 4 and a young couple, and we all agreed that the rooms could be bigger, and there should be some bubble bath and a better selection in the minibar (at least the same as the list of items). 

🤵🏻‍♀️The service was decent, although it could have been better in terms of English proficiency. The staff made a mistake with the minbar charge and kindly called me soon after I checked out to inform me about the alteration of my bill and deduction from my card. They also directed me to the nearest Covid testing center. Check-in took a while (due to the National Holiday crowds) but checkout was extremely fast. 

🏊🏻‍♀️Facilities were good - especially the GYM and pool but 24/7 working hours would be preferable.

☕️🥞The food was great - lots of fruit, salads, cheeses, breads, good coffee, egg and noodle stations, but no nutela?! :( And my friend noticed that coffee to go is charged an additional 20 rmb.

💖Overall, it was a good experience. Thank you.

I arrived at the hotel early and had no trouble checking in, the staff, particularly Zero were very helpful and always happy to assist me if they could.

The room is all clean and comfortable, when I checked in they told me that there's construction happening, this turned out to not be an issue and was very well managed to reduce noise. The only bit of construction I heard was some drilling for about 5 minutes.

Whilst at the hotel I decided to splurge a little and book a massage, this was a lovely way to end a long day,  the masseuse was very professional. 

Getting to the hotel from the airport is super easy as the hotel is adjacent to the subway station that goes to the airport.

overall, great stay would stay again.

The staff doesnt speak much English, which for a Sheraton hotel in such a prime location, surprised me. Even so, they were welcoming and tried to help as they could.
The rain shower in my room was broken, and there was no umbrella in the room or at the reception.
Besides that, it was a nice stay.

After entering the lobby, check-in was very fast, the room was very clean and large, and the waiters were very polite. In particular, the breakfast at the Sheraton Hotel was very good, with many varieties and good taste, much better than many five-star hotels. I would like to thank the hotel in particular. It was my friend's birthday on the 23rd, and when we returned to the room after dinner, the hotel had already sent a birthday cake. I would like to thank the hotel's housekeeping depar**ent. In addition, the hotel's bedding is very comfortable, and the mattress is neither soft nor hard, which is very suitable for guests with bad lumbar vertebrae. Unlike many five-star hotel beds, you will have back pain the next day after sleeping on them. I was very satisfied with this stay and will choose Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel as my first choice in the future when I come to Guangzhou.

Although the hotel room I rented this time was close to the elevator lobby, I felt that the room was very soundproof. It was just that there were children playing loudly in the morning. I heard the sound first, and it was very quiet the rest of the time. The bed was very comfortable and the overall feeling was good. I will stay here again next time I go to Guangzhou because the transportation is very convenient and it is close to the subway station.

Exit from Exit C of the subway to Tianhe Mall. Walk from the mall to the back door of the hotel and you can enter the lobby. This station also has Line 1. It is very convenient to go to Canton Tower, Chen Clan Ancestral Hall and Shamian Island. In addition, there are many large shopping malls nearby, which is very convenient for eating. The location is really convenient~ As for the hotel facilities, they have been newly renovated in recent years. Overall It's relatively new, with an outdoor swimming pool and a gym. As for the service, the lobby manager (I didn't see the name, I stood at the door to greet him, he should be the lobby manager) and the front desk lady Lulu yin are very kind and approachable. Lulu also responded to our questions and requests in detail. They answered the questions in a gentle manner, and I felt very comfortable. I stayed here for two nights in total, and overall it was pretty good.

However, the service level is not in line with that of established star-rated hotels. First, when I checked in at around 4pm, I was told that the room was not cleaned properly. In addition, I was told that the room was not cleaned properly the next day when I was out for fun. They said it was a mistake. I stayed for two days and only charged one day's deposit for me to make up for it. I was going to check out the next day. If I made a mistake, do I need to make up the deposit again? You can just pay it directly when you check out. Although the tone is very polite, it still feels strange. Of course, I still recommend staying in this hotel.

It was three o'clock in the afternoon when I checked in. I was told that I would have to wait for another hour. After directly expressing my disapproval, the front desk immediately coordinated to find a room for check-in. I paid a deposit of 3,000. These days, deposits are basically no longer required. I just paid it because I was too lazy to bother with it and asked the front desk to print a deposit receipt.
When I entered the room, I found it was pretty good. It was very spacious, the bed was quite big, and the layout was very reasonable. The curtain in the toilet can be raised and lowered, and the lighting is better when it is raised.
The hygiene is also good and meets five-star standards. Whatever you need can be delivered immediately, and the response speed is very fast. The phone call is so quiet, but the other party can hear it clearly. After asking for 3 extra bottles of water on the first day, the cleaning staff will put 3-4 extra bottles of water in the following days. This is very considerate and can remember personal preferences.
The door is generally soundproof, you can hear people talking and walking by. The air conditioner couldn't turn down the temperature, and it was still quite hot. Fortunately, it rained and was cold and humid in Guangzhou for a few days, otherwise it would have been too stuffy.
I applied for a delayed check-out until 2 o'clock. The check-out was very fast and the deposit was received in seconds.
The hotel is in a very good location, connected to many shopping malls, which is very convenient. I will consider staying here next time. very nice!

Opposite the hotel are the "Big Pigeon Rice", "Yinli Rice Roll Rice Roll Shop" and the nearby "Taotaoju" for Cantonese cuisine. It's delicious. Shopping, shopping and dining are very convenient near the hotel. There is a subway station just outside the hotel, which is also very convenient to the airport and scenic spots. It is within walking distance from the hotel to the Guangzhou landmark "Canton Tower", and the scenery along the way is very pleasant. The overall service of the hotel is okay. Special praise is given to the room attendant Zou Honglian, who took the initiative to introduce the transportation and dining conditions in Guangzhou to the guests. The room was cleaned very clean and meticulously. Some suggestions: According to my observation, it is normal for hotel guests to check in late. When I checked in, I was delayed for nearly 2 hours. The front desk should give a reasonable explanation. The hotel itself is a breach of contract if it allows guests to check in late. Therefore, hotels should provide guests with follow-up services due to late check-in, rather than the current situation. Despite this, next time I come to Guangzhou, I will stay at the Guangdong Sheraton Hotel.

What I like best is sitting on the second floor near the Chris**as tree with a view of the outside scenery, drinking my favorite Hong Kong-style milk tea and eating breakfast slowly.
  The hotel is surrounded by business districts, which is very satisfying for my mother and I. When traveling, isn't it just to see other cities and the scenery along the way? Moreover, this was my mother’s first time in Guangzhou. She went to the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, had sex, had afternoon tea at the revolving restaurant, and took a night cruise on the Pearl River. Seeing my mother’s smiling face makes my trip to Guangzhou even more perfect!
  We will go to Guangzhou next time and stay at the Sheraton. Looking forward to it~~

The breakfast is good. At the same price, it has more space than the Marriott in Zhengjia Plaza and the equipment is newer. The location is unbeatable, it can be said to be the best location in Guangzhou. The outdoor swimming pool is also one of the special features.

shortcoming:
Five-star price, three-star service.
I got off the bus at the entrance of the lobby, took the stroller and a bunch of luggage, and walked up three or four stairs. I struggled to carry it up. The receptionist turned a blind eye, and my first impression was completely lost.
The hotel actually has no bed surround, only a crib. The one-year-old baby is always nervous and tired when he is placed on the big bed.
There is no afternoon tea in the executive lounge, and the happy hour closes very early in the evening. It is useless and better than nothing.
I originally planned to stay for two days, but on the first night I contacted Ctrip to cancel my reservation for the next day. I changed to the Mandarin Hotel next door, which cost an extra two hundred. The service has improved several levels in an instant. Please pay attention to the management team.

The front desk colleagues are all very polite, friendly and smiling. During our stay, my husband was injured by a clothes hanger in the room and was bleeding. The front desk manager Jelly and a male colleague quickly helped to deal with the wound. At noon, they called us to care about the wound and gave us a late check-out. After checking into the inn, I found some traces of tape on the toilet board. Housekeeping colleague Penny and a female colleague took care of it. The hotel's breakfast is rich, delicious and varied.

The location is very good, very close to the subway station and easy to take a taxi. There are delicious food and shopping places within walking distance. Children like swimming pools. Although it is more sunny in the open air, playing in the water makes them much happier than going shopping. I will choose to stay here next time I come

You can take a bath while looking at the window view ~ I booked a hotel package and had dinner in the executive lounge. The food was okay and quite rich. Breakfast The buffet on the 2nd floor tasted okay~ I like the hotel swimming pool, the changing rooms are clean and the facilities are complete. The hotel is an open-air swimming pool. The scenery is beautiful in the morning and at night. There are beach chairs by the pool, which is very comfortable to sunbathe in. 😌

msg:The reasons for giving 4 points are as follows:

1. The location of the hotel is super convenient for taking the subway and shopping, but the surrounding environment is full of streets with no greenery at all, and there are many people and cars, which makes it feel a bit messy. This is not a problem of the hotel, it may be like this in the whole of Guangzhou, small Cars and battery-operated vehicles rammed into another lane, causing serious traffic jams on the road

2. The breakfast is rich, but it is almost the same every day. There are only a few stir-fried dishes (such as vegetables and mushrooms), and the breakfast feels a bit like being in a vegetable market. People around are talking noisily, and some even have video chat or video chat on. It's listening to music, in short: it doesn't feel like being in a five-star hotel.

We managed to get a room on the lower floor with a view of the stadium, which was okay. If you live alone, the room is quite spacious. The intersection at the door cannot be accessed directly. You have to take the underground passage. It is quite tiring to walk back and forth several times. The hotel is connected to Tianhe City and the subway, and there are many delicious restaurants around. One of the first choices for celestial activities.

msg:For more than ten years, this hotel has been my first choice when traveling to Guangzhou for business, but this time I was greatly disappointed! When I checked in, the front desk clerk was expressionless and a little cold. I felt that the renovated room was not as spacious as before. There was also a bench under the TV, making the space even narrower. At about ten o'clock in the evening, I suddenly received a call from the front desk manager saying that visitors should register at the front desk. I said that the guests would leave immediately, but the manager refused to comment and said: "You must register before you leave immediately. This is the regulation of the public security department." I think there is nothing wrong with enforcing public security management regulations, but the attitude towards regular customers should be more flexible and friendly, so as not to make people feel discouraged. Thinking back to the hotel where I have stayed for a long time, the service attitude has become like this. I feel bad, so I had to check out overnight.

msg:I have stayed at this hotel several times during my business trip to Guangzhou because I liked its service level. I always stay in executive rooms and recommend this hotel to colleagues. But this time may be the last time as this hotel completely ignores its regular guests.


1. When my colleagues and I arrived at the hotel at 3:30 pm, we were told that the room was not ready yet. Really? After the 12:00 check-out time, you couldn't clean the room within 3.5 hours, considering the quality of your hotel? Furthermore, the hotel staff deliberately delayed the check-in process: it took us about 20 minutes instead of the usual 5-7 minutes.

2. During tea time in the executive lounge, tea (not even hot water, just warm water), coffee and biscuits are provided. Is this the standard of a Sheraton hotel? A variety of desserts and snacks were also available last summer. Now there is nothing. The food variety in the evening is also less than before.

3. The check-out deposit will not be refunded immediately, but within 24 hours. Why can’t Sheraton Guangdong offer real-time refunds like other hotels? I don't like my money sitting around for a day. In the end, the deposit was not returned in time, and I had to waste time calling the hotel to find out the reason.


A five-star hotel should feel comfortable. This Sheraton hotel made me very troubled from the moment I checked in. The service level is much worse than just last summer. I will not choose this hotel again or recommend it to my colleagues.

The mini bar is not free, and the scenery outside the window is average. The only advantage is that the location is good. There are several high-end business districts next door, and there is a subway station downstairs. The hotel's spa is also good. It was said that the gym has a free sauna room, but no one told us that we wanted to try it. In short, I will probably never stay at the Sheraton at 4,000 yuan a night.

msg:The hotel facilities are not brand new. After all, the hotel is quite old, but the facilities are well maintained. There is nothing to say about hygiene, after all, it is an old-fashioned hotel. This is also the reason why I have been staying at the Sheraton. The location of the hotel is excellent, surrounded by large business districts, where you can find everything you want to eat, drink and shop. It can be reached by walking, and there are many restaurants with high ratings nearby, which are delicious. In addition, the hotel's swimming pool is a feature. The swimming pool is located on the roof. It is very comfortable to enjoy the night view of the city while swimming. The breakfast in the hotel is also good~the variety is rich and the standard is first-class. Will come to Guangzhou again to live in the future.

There is a male colleague in the hotel FO who is very enthusiastic and answers all questions. Knowing that we booked the high-speed rail, he reminded us that the distance to Guangzhou East Railway Station is shorter than that of Guangzhou Station, and then changed the ticket immediately. In addition, other staff at the front desk are very friendly, although during the summer vacation There are many guests, but they all manage them in an orderly manner
The hotel is very close to the subway, 2 minutes away 👍
There are Tianhe City and Zhengjia Plaza next to it, and there is a whole food street opposite, so it will be difficult to choose
Breakfast has many choices and all are delicious
The aunt who cleaned up the room knew that we drank a lot of water, so she specially added a few sticks of water for refill, so considerate👍
All in all, next time I come to Guangzhou, I will stay here again😆

Look at the white sealant in the bathroom. Alas, it is not as good as the sealant I applied at home. It feels very cheap. The kettle buttons are covered with scale. We dare not use them and buy water ourselves every day. At 9 o'clock in the morning, I started vacuuming the carpet at the door. It was really unbelievable that people were vying for seats during breakfast in the restaurant. I made my own suggestions, but I felt that they were not taken seriously. Stayed for 8 nights, and there was no shrimp dumplings for breakfast, which seemed very shabby. For breakfast on the 8th day, it was king oyster mushroom and beef on the 5th and 6th day, which was amazing~ once it was fish, which was so fishy. The guy who picked up the luggage at the door and the girl who checked in at the front desk were the only highlights. I will not stay here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone around me. I hope to improve service awareness and quality. Don’t use the customer service lady who answers the phone. It’s too bad. Let’s learn more about Westin and Mandarin Oriental. Don't look too cheap.

Administrative trea**ent is poor. In addition to the advantage of the buried location, other services are not even comparable to ordinary hotels. We booked an executive room and enjoyed executive trea**ent. Soft drinks are available all day on the 33rd floor, but there is no afternoon tea or snacks. There are only two cans of biscuits that have been stored for an unknown period of time; followed by dinner from 17:30 to 19:30 in the afternoon , That's really scary, it's okay if there are few varieties, the food is really unpalatable, one of the dishes that day was octopus, and it was definitely not fresh when you ate it. The fried noodles were cold and hard. The environment is poor, a bunch of ants crawling on the ground facing the entrance of the conference room, it's disgusting. The overall product and environment are worse than fast food restaurants. In addition, the bed sheets were definitely not washed, and after sleeping for a while, the whole body would itch and have red spots. Either no one answered the customer service call, or it took a long time to answer it. After answering, no one came to implement the promised service. Is this kind of service and this kind of environment worthy of the price? I think you need to use dim sum in management? There is no problem with the service attitude of the staff, but I think it is a management problem.

msg:In the hot Guangzhou summer, this location is really the best choice for eating, drinking and having fun. Flying Cinemas on the fourth floor of Tianhe City is most suitable for catching up with the premiere of Transformers. Daoxiang's morning tea on the seventh floor of Tee Mall is really good. The seafood buffet on the second floor of the hotel, the sashimi oysters are super fresh, and the baked lobster per person is really amazing. The buffet on the second floor is only more than 60 US dollars. Compared with the Wynn in Las Vegas, the quality and cost-effective super high. The most recommended is their fitness center. Facing the beautiful scenery of Tianhe Sports Center, Mayor Building and CITIC Plaza, this fitness center + outdoor swimming pool is worth returning to the box office.

I specially ordered a twin room so that they can be put together so that the children won't fall off. But after entering, I found that I couldn't move at all. Fortunately, the two sofas under the bed could be placed in the middle, which perfectly solved the problem.
Downstairs of the hotel is Tianhe City. You can walk into the shopping mall directly from the back, which is very convenient. You don't have to go outside to take the subway even in hot weather in Guangzhou. It is also close to the apm line. It is very convenient to go to Canton Tower. The swimming pool downstairs is very clean, with a constant temperature of 28.5. The view is very good, you can see the swimming pool and tennis court downstairs, the disadvantage is that you can't see the Canton Tower.
The buffet on the 2nd floor tastes okay, there are quite a lot of categories, and the drinks are a little less. It is easy to get tired of eating for two consecutive days because the dishes are the same on both days.
Overall very satisfied with the hotel

msg:Facilities: I think the facilities are ok. They are relatively new. Some people said that some facilities are not good enough. This time I stayed here, I think everything is ok, nothing particularly bad.
Hygiene: There are no garbage bags in the trash can, but the trash cans in the living room are sorted, which is very good.
Environment: the lobby and rooms are very good
Service: I checked in with my child and checked in at the front desk. It was done by a male staff member with a very good attitude. He told us that the room is still being cleaned and the luggage is left at the concierge. After the room comes out, help us put the suitcase When I got the room, when I was outside, I received a message from the front desk, telling me the room number. The door couldn't be opened after returning to the hotel. The room attendant helped us deal with it and opened the door for us by the way. The handsome guy at the front desk also helped to send the activated card, thank you very much.
         Because I had a child, I called the front desk and needed the children's bathrobe, toothbrush and slippers, which were delivered by a beautiful lady. To make a medicine box for the child at night, paper cups and water are needed. The staff are very nice and have delivered them to the room. Living in such a hotel gives me a lot of peace of mind.
        Suggestion: When checking out at noon, there are only two staff members at the front desk doing business, and there are many people queuing up. When consulting, I was told to queue up for consultation. I hope that at least three staff members can be arranged at this point, otherwise it will be really difficult. What's more, it is crazy for some people who want to check out or consult.
       A small episode: When checking out, the child spilled sugar on the ground. I saw a staff member walking by, so I called her. I probably meant that it would be best to clean it. The result , she first asked me if I wanted any more, I said no, then she picked up two 🍬 and gave them to the child, I was a little embarrassed and said no, no, it was embarrassing anyway.
Overall, this stay is very good, maybe I will have the opportunity to stay again next time.

After the overall refurbishment, the equipment is quite new. The supreme room type I stayed in this time is very comfortable: large bathroom space + walk-in closet, more than enough space. But the orientation is not very good, facing west, those who like to see the view of Zhujiang New Town cannot live in this room type.
It is not good to mention one point: the toothpaste and slippers are too bad to use, and it will not cost much to mention the next file, but the guest experience will be much better.

This hotel really does a great job with the staff.
But the hardware is really worth complaining about.
1. The door of the hotel room is too heavy, it will close automatically, and there is a loud bang when it closes, so you can always hear the sound of other people's doors slamming in the middle of the night.
2. The hotel is so stingy. It’s the first time I saw a five-star hotel’s trash can without a garbage bag. The bottom of the trash can is cracked. There is a box of toilet paper in the bathroom of the whole room. There is no toilet paper in the room.
If you want a razor, you have to find it yourself, if you don't have it, they won't provide it.
The hotel has a bathtub, but there is no bathtub bag. You need to bring your own. The hotel apar**ent where you stayed a few days ago provided it.
3. The first hotel I stayed in for a long time was a cotton quilt, not a down quilt. Once I put it on, it was so heavy, very heavy.
4. The sound of the air conditioner is very loud, but there is no sound at the entrance. Once you step into the room, the sound of the air conditioner is super loud. The air conditioner control panel was bright like a small light bulb in the middle of the night, and there was no way to dim it.
5. In this day and age, the TV cannot cast the screen. I tried it according to the method given by the front desk, but there was only sound but no picture.
6. There are a lot of advertisements inside the hotel in the room.
But the breakfast is good, but not much
The swimming pool is also great
The attitude of all the staff is very very very good
In summary, the hardware really needs to be improved.

I will choose to stay here next time if I have a chance!

The hotel can be said to have no service at all. As a parent-child hotel, there are no children's toiletries. We only provided children's toothbrushes and slippers after calling to inquire. The overall smell of the room was airtight, the pillows smelled of cigarette smoke, and the quilt was damp. The only good thing was that the breakfast was not bad. I will definitely not choose this hotel next time

Check-in is until 3:00 pm. Fortunately, the location of the hotel is good. You can go to have lunch first after storing your luggage, but it may not be convenient if you want to change clothes and refresh before going to the company if you are on a business trip.
The room is clean, the sound insulation is very good, and the hardware facilities are good. The breakfast is rich, and there are many varieties of Cantonese-style morning tea. At the same time, there are not enough Western-style varieties, which is understandable.
In particular, I would like to praise the room attendants. My odds and ends of cosmetics were placed on the sink. When I returned to the room in the afternoon, I laid out small towels. They were arranged in order as they were, which was very considerate.
After all, it is in Guangdong. It would be even better if there is a tea set in the room.

I ordered takeout just for convenience. I can't understand the service of a star hotel. Isn't there such an item? I called the concierge to ask if they could send it upstairs for me. They were very impatient and asked why the hotel here couldn't send it upstairs. There was no answer. Just tell me that you can pick it up yourself if you don’t deliver it. Forget it. If the customer has doubts about your service, shouldn’t you explain it? It’s hotel regulations or that all hotels in Guangzhou don’t deliver. You are not the kind of person who is messy. Do you think I understand your situation? What else will I do to you according to the regulations? Isn’t your service attitude at the top of the list for a five-star hotel? And the most ridiculous thing is that at 10:45 pm on July 7, a courier from SF Express in the same city took the elevator and swaggered upstairs. You didn’t say anything at all. What? Since you are going to do this, you should be stricter.

At that time, a female receptionist told me that I had booked a deluxe room There is only room 1818, but when I went up to the room, I found out that it was a superior room (the room type is different from the deluxe room I booked), and I immediately went to the lobby to find another female receptionist, and asked why the room provided was wrong She said that the deluxe room may be available later, and asked if I could change the room later, of course I can wait. Because I booked a deluxe room instead of a superior room, why did the first female receptionist give the guest a different room type without explaining clearly to the guest? Although the price is the same, the two room types are different. If there is no Do not provide a choice of 2 room types on the reservation website.

Manager Huang Bella specially considered the specific needs of me and my children when applying for preferential policies for me to make adjus**ents. It was properly arranged, which made me feel very at ease. In addition to special thanks to Manager Huang, the young man on duty in the concierge depar**ent is also very competent.

They also kept it very well. , unlike the concierge depar**ent of many hotels, which is just a decoration, it is really worthy of praise👍. The bedding is almost dirty every day due to children's allergies. Thank you for the patience of the cleaners to change it every day. Children love the rhythm ball in the rooftop swimming pool and gym! I sincerely thank the staff of Sheraton and wish you a happy new year in advance🎆Auspicious stars are shining🌟Sheraton Guangzhou, Guangdong, a trustworthy hotel for guests!

I can hardly imagine that it is still a first-tier city in Guangzhou. The facilities inside are so old that I don’t want to live in it. A hotel costs more than 2K a night. To be honest, 800 is too expensive. How can it be a five-star hotel?

The biggest drawback is that the waiter promised to help us deliver our luggage to the room. When we returned to the hotel, we found that the luggage was still intact in the luggage area. When we asked the waiter why the luggage was still there, he was confused and said that no one had explained it. Is this the level of service in a five-star hotel?

The hotel is the hotel when you come out of the airport from the Stadium West Road Station of Line 3. There are major shopping malls near the hotel, and there are various snacks opposite the hotel, which are affordable and very delicious. Not to mention the service of the hotel, I would like to thank Xiaoyue and Manager Yang who checked in at the front desk, because we took 3 children and the hotel upgraded the room for free, and also gave a lot of help. Every time we have an inquiry, we always take the trouble to help us inquire and solve it. Really feel at home. The children in the outdoor swimming pool on the 9th floor also had a great time. If I come to Guangzhou next time, I will choose Sheraton Guangdong.

Finally, another guest couldn't stand it and told my friend. I was very shocked that a staff member of the executive lounge gave such an answer. This is the most basic hotel knowledge. She doesn't know, even if she doesn't know, she should confirm it normally, and the guest has asked her to confirm her. Still don't know. This is a matter of attitude, the hotel is a service industry, and this staff member has no sense of service at all. I've seen many clubs, even interns don't do this. When encountering something they don't know, they will say a word to confirm it, instead of repeatedly shirk.

The hotel is connected to Tianhe City. The east gate of Tianhe City and the west gate of Tianhuan Square are separated by a road. The square used to be Wanlinghui, and the diagonally opposite of Wanlinghui is Taikoo Hui.

🧹Sanitation: The facilities are outdated, but the cleaning work is still in place. When I went to bed after 11 o'clock in the evening, I just opened the quilt and found that the quilt cover had a hole on the side that touched the clothes. I called the housekeeping center and the staff came up to change it. Bathroom towels have burrs, it is recommended that the hotel update supplies in time.
🍃Environment: Although old, it is neat and clean. The 26-degree constant temperature swimming pool on the 9th floor has clean water quality, few people and high comfort, but it is really cold after the water comes out, and it takes a long walk to return to the indoor locker room.
🔔Service: The first time I checked in was 1911, I didn’t like the view (Picture 3), the air conditioner kept heating, it was very stuffy, and the temperature could not be adjusted, so I changed it to 1925 (Picture 4, Picture 7) View, room temperature Also slightly better. The front desk is efficient, and took the initiative to delay our return to 2:00. We came by car. When leaving the store, register the license plate number with the concierge 15 minutes before leaving the store. The car is free within 15 minutes, and the staff took the initiative to help us with our luggage. parking lot.
Overall, the stay experience matches the price.

msg:I have to say that this trip to Sheraton was very comfortable. First of all, the traffic location can definitely be said to be the most convenient in the whole of Guangzhou. There is a subway next to it, so it is convenient to go anywhere. Shopping is also very convenient, there are large shopping malls, cinemas, etc. next to it. As soon as you enter the hotel gate, there will be a warm concierge to help with things. There is a refreshing fragrance in the lobby, which is said to be unique to Sheraton (I really want to buy it). The service of the little girl who checked in at the front desk is even more caring than my wife. The coffee in the lobby bar of the hotel is also very good, which is unexpected for my coffee connoisseur. The executive lounge of the hotel is also beyond my expectations. It can sit on the beautiful view of the whole Guangzhou city, and there is an outdoor garden where you can smoke. Is there a paradise on earth? The sisters in the lounge were all smiles, which could infect me, and I couldn't help showing a smile on my bitter and hated face. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool. With the temperature of 22 degrees, the experience is not very good. All in all, the experience is really good, highly recommended~

I fell directly when I came out, injured my calf, broke my mobile phone, and then complained to the hotel manager, which is also a variety of shirk responsibility. I am unwilling to bear my actual losses and injuries, and leave a very unfortunate end to my trip to Guangzhou. I am writing this review, not for anything else, but to advise everyone to consider staying at this hotel carefully!

msg:I still choose Sheraton Guangdong for this business trip. It is rare for this hotel to maintain a high standard of quality service during the epidemic. In particular, the front desk manager Wayne tried his best to satisfy my various housing preferences and requirements, making this trip more enjoyable both physically and mentally. Also performing well is the small card of the front desk staff. The entire check-in process is concise and to the point, without redundant procedures and cumbersomeness, which is the check-in efficiency I like. The buffet breakfast, which was once criticized for a while, has begun to offer more and more high-quality meals after a period of adjus**ent. It can be seen that all depar**ents are working hard to improve the comprehensive competitiveness of the hotel. As a resident passenger of this hotel, I hope that the hotel will have more and more favorable policies to serve the public in the future, and I will still choose Sheraton Guangdong next time I come again.

The single item is not the highest score, but it is first-class in general. The location is very advantageous, the parking is convenient, the subway travel, the room is clean, the breakfast is rich, the outdoor activity space is large, the environment of the executive lounge is comfortable, and it is close to the shopping mall Tianhe City Tianhuan Zhengjia Close at hand, the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, especially the hotel duty manager, Mr. Wayne, who has a friendly, professional and enthusiastic attitude.

The lights were broken and couldn't be turned off. At 11 o'clock in the evening, someone was called to repair it, and it was done in one minute. There are two shortcomings. There is a stainless steel drainage cover in front of the underground garage at the entrance of the hotel. It slipped and fell, injured his knee, and his hand was bleeding. Go out shopping at night and pass by very carefully. The hotel is obliged to remind the guests of this road section. It was the first time I slipped and fell in Guangzhou for more than 20 years. Breakfast until nine o'clock feels like a food stall and a dining hall. There are too many people and the food is not rich. We left without eating much. It is also for this reason that the next day's itinerary changed to other hotels and did not stay.

msg:I have been ordering hotel reservations on Ctrip. Ctrip has always been a trusted platform for me. Ctrip has sent out a lot of hotel booking promotions, which are really considerate and affordable...
First, after placing the order, the hotel’s confirmation information was quite fast, and then I called the hotel to make a few of my requests, and the hotel staff enthusiastically and patiently resolved the reasonable arrangements for me one by one...
The first impression of entering the hotel is that it is very clean, and the design style is elegant, and then from the waiter at the door of the hotel to the cleaning service of the room, every staff member is smiling, enthusiastic, amiable, polite and serious. ...... Serve customers with 💯 status......
Secondly, the hotel arranged for me to have a large, clean, and comfortable room. Standing on the floor-to-ceiling glass window, I could see the swimming pool. The bathroom was equipped with complete amenities and very high-end... The bathroom was also relatively large and the environment was comfortable. I used the hotel’s laundry service...The laundry is very clean and the charge is reasonable...When you go out in the corridor and encounter cleaning, the waiter will be very polite and take the initiative to say hello...This must be praised👍
The corridor passing through the lobby of the hotel is Teemall, where you can eat, shop, relax and have everything available... it’s super convenient
The location of the hotel is very superior, and it is extremely convenient to travel. The surrounding area of the hotel is surrounded by subways, buses, taxis... The traffic is very convenient... There are many street shops and delicacies around the hotel, you can eat whatever you want... There is a dazzling array, and you can change and eat different flavors every day...It's so delicious...😂

The hotel is quiet, although it is on the side of the road, it will not be noisy. As long as I go to Guangzhou, I will still choose to stay at the Sheraton Hotel, which is a trusted brand hotel......💯 👍
 
⚠️⚠️⚠️Here I want to give special service to the one who serves my room: Chen Nana's waiter is really a good waiter who is attentive, responsible, and considerate to the guests. I saw her message The note, really moved me all of a sudden... It instantly made me feel at home and feel at home... This service, this carefulness, really is the high-quality service that only Sheraton Hotel can do... …And only the Sheraton Hotel can produce such good and excellent staff… See the people, see the details, see the details… A small detail reflects the character and cultivation of the waiter named Chen Nana… It can be seen in a deeper level. The management of the Sheraton brand hotel and the ability of cultivating staff are so outstanding...Here: I want to thank again 🙏This waiter named: Chen Nana, thank you! Thank you very much 🙏 for your excellent service, so that I will always choose your hotel to stay in as long as I arrive in Guangzhou in the future: Sheraton Guangzhou Hotel. 👍

I booked another 3 nights. The hotel management is good, especially the executive lounge, located on the 33rd floor. There is also a separate smoking area. Children say it is convenient and comfortable to stay. The service staff are enthusiastic. Compare it with the whole building of Sheraton Hotel, which is very convenient and well managed. The variety of breakfast has not changed much, and it is also said that in the past, there are places to eat morning tea in Guangzhou, and the requirements are not high. Convenient transportation and direct access to the subway station are also a condition for choosing here.

This time I stayed for the outdoor swimming pool for two nights. The swimming pool was much more pleasant than expected. The view is very wide and will not be blocked by tall buildings. It is suitable for tanners! The pool water is also very clean. There are not many people. Towels and water are provided. The favorite thing is that there are a few hammocks in the rear for cooling off! I would like to stay again for this outdoor swimming pool in the future!
club: The service is very good! But the food is less than expected. The wine can be adjusted by yourself. There is room for improvement. For example, make a menu of classic cocktails and soft drinks coffee. Perrier has to ask if there is any. Thank you also for the warm hospitality of MAX from the club!
The breakfast on the 3rd floor is really okay...the only thing this hotel thinks is that a little bit of deduction is to eat🥺
Thank you also for the nice room arranged by sister orange at the front desk on the first floor

Upgraded the twin room for free, quiet and elegant. The downside is that the water in the bathtub is not hot and the bath is not soaked. Maybe the hotel is to save water. It doesn't matter in summer. If you can't take a bath in winter, you won't feel comfortable. After all, the price is twice as high as that of economy hotels.

It is also puzzling that there is no birthday blessing during the whole process. Although it is a 10-year old hotel, it is hard and soft. Very good, the swimming pool is quite good, the happy hour of the executive lounge is very good, the breakfast variety is not much, the taste is average, can eat enough, overall the price of 800 yuan is quite high

環境：房間很好，很寬敞，打掃的人員也很負責。

    大堂雖然不是特別大，但也很氣派，車到之後門僮立馬幫忙開車門搬行李，我很省事。前台小姐姐也是相當暖心，見我帶着小朋友，給我安排了馬上可以入住的、樓層比較高、比較安靜視野比較好的房間。
    房間蠻大的，方便小孩子活動，各項設施都很好用，到底是22年新裝修的。
    特別要讚揚一下客房服務員藍月娥，她發現我帶着小孩子，立馬拿來寶寶拖鞋和牙刷，還暖心地多放了幾瓶水，特此表揚👍
    總結：性價比很高！
    建議：房間床上的四個枕頭很好，都一樣大小和厚度，但對我來説不太好用，因為我頸椎不好，如果能有一個比較矮的、薄的就更好了。

早餐丰富，中西點心俱全
房間乾淨，挑剔的女兒終於可穿短褲睡覺
服務台員工有礼，代安排老人家找的士直達上下九食双皮奶
貼心服務，非常感謝。
美中不足，訂房時已溝通安排打通相連房間及同層，方便照顧2位九十多歲的父母，可惜3晚只安排了2晚，算了吧！
我一定会再入住，等我

不足之處：一是，浴巾有些太舊了，建議更換。二是，馬桶居然不是智能的，感覺跟酒店價位不是很符合。

第一天辦理入住由於酒店裝修後雙床拼不了，小朋友圍欄也沒有，要求換大床，等了一會就安排好了！
但是當晚上回來的時候發現空調不製冷，房間悶熱，聯繫賓客服務，馬上安排了師傅來查看，但是空調製冷了，接着就跳閘了，師傅在的時候跳了一次，後面小朋友洗澡時又跳了一次！無奈衹能再聯繫他們，後續給我們安排換了一間大套房！第二天在動物園遊玩時，工作人員還特意致電道歉！
酒店位於最熱鬧的天河城，到哪裡去都特別方便，樓下就是商場地鐵，附近很多吃的！
酒店雖然設施不比新的酒店好，但是服務沒話説！綜合地理位置，以後來還是會繼續住這家，希望酒店早餐可以再提升一下，吃的不是太多，甜品類口味稍微欠佳！

設施有年代了，房間裝修還ok但洗手間設施實在不能算好的，備品也一般，牙膏品牌有點不敢恭維。最大的優點可能就是地理位置吧，下次可能不一定會再選擇了。

地點：天河區中心商圈，和天河城一個大樓，可以從酒店大堂的小門直接過去；附近有天環廣場、正佳廣場、萬菱滙、天河又一城、廣百等，吃飯購物特別方便；地鐵站E口就在酒店大門口的天河又一城地下，到機場可以直接坐3號線，去各個地方都很方便。天河城地下一層有永旺超市，應用盡有。
酒店設施：雖然酒店年代有些久遠，但房間很大氣，房間設施也看不出來任何陳舊，特別寬敞、明亮，入住體驗很好。
春節期間入住率很高，人來人往的，9樓的屋頂泳池也很好，節假日期間房間價格上漲比較多，總體的感覺非常好，下次來廣州還會住在這裏。

msg:房間可以. 但是無法跟度假酒店相比. 所以可以理解！
入住當天是我的生日. 前台職員辦理入住時沒有任何表示. 所以比較失望.  不知道是服務意識不夠還是因為我是在線上訂購原因？
另外自己開車過來，因為有事要外出辦理. 入住時，前台員工沒有詢問是否需要停車，所以無故付了停車費用.   因為這樣我就打電話詢問，電話是第二次才有人接聽. 所以不太理解？   最後前台職員接聽電話時告知，因為停車場是業主物業，所以每次開車離開前需要到禮賓部先登記.
