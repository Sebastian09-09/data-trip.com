The restaurant is on the second floor, Wujia Xiyue Restaurant, which mainly serves Cantonese cuisine. Breakfast is also on the second floor, from 7 to 10 o'clock, buffet, relatively rich, 98 yuan per person.

The overall experience is very good. In addition, a deposit of 500 is required for check-in. Take-out can be delivered to the room by a robot.

The Xiaomi TV in the room is not convenient for mobile phone projection, you need to download the APP, and the projection effect is not good, and you have to pay.

The toilet in the bathroom is equipped with smart thermostatic control. The wash basins are all famous brands and high quality. The hairdryer is very powerful, similar to Dyson style.

Checking in on my birthday, no surprises, not even a happy birthday (less disappointment)
The room has a beautiful view, the curtains automatically rise when entering the room, so beautiful that the children make a swoosh
The room has enough space for activities, and children are provided with toothbrushes and slippers upon request.
The TV has to reconnect to the wifi every time it is turned on, which is a bit annoying.
It is convenient to get in and out of the call car, close to the Shenzhen Bay Port, and there is a small supermarket next to the hotel.
**After the flower purchase is confirmed at the front desk, a robot will be arranged to deliver it to the room.

He answered the questions very enthusiastically. There are two robots delivering things in the lobby on the first floor, which is very technological.

The suite is really cost-effective. I have stayed in suites in nearby five-star hotels, which cost more than 3k, but the quality was not as good as this one. The main thing is the details. It doesn't feel like a hotel on a business trip, it feels more like being at home, very comfortable. For example, the selection of speakers, coffee machines, tea bags, and bedding is very good. My boyfriend was surprised and thought I had secretly upgraded the room type. I said it was Brother Lei Feng (Xiao Guo) at the front desk who upgraded me. Thanks again. Gave me a very romantic trip to Shenzhen memories.

Then the second time I was on a business trip, I booked a regular double room, which was the same standard as a five-star hotel, but at half the price. Except for getting there late and not having enough parking spaces, everything else was great.

There are a lot of places to eat next to the hotel and the transportation is very convenient. I recommend it to everyone who comes to Nanshan for business trips!

The overall facilities of the hotel are relatively new. I prefer hotels with higher floors, which look more majestic and spacious, so I booked this hotel because of this. It is also very close to the stadium, about one kilometer away. It's only a ten-minute drive away, so transportation is more convenient.

The beds, floors, sofas, and countertops are neat and clean. The rooms are well-equipped with electric curtains, lights, etc., and are comfortable and clean. Everything about the hardware is incredible👍🏻. The room is arranged on the 24th floor. Although it is not a higher floor of the hotel, the view is very good and open. But there is a slight deduction for the service. When I checked in, the front desk did not tell me about the breakfast arrangements. I had to take the initiative to ask. The buffet breakfast has many types and tastes very good. Although there are many waiters in the restaurant, they did not take the initiative to take me away. The dishes after the meal were not good enough. If there were not these few shortcomings, the full 5 points would be well deserved👍🏻Recommended

The area is nice, but there is nowhere to sit or eat. The breakfast was pleasing, without the excessive harshness of the local cuisine, very good food that is understandable to a European :) The staff speaks English a little better than not speaking at all, but they cope quite well with a translator. The guy Yin Lisheng at the luggage counter was pleasant, very prompt, ordered a taxi, loaded the suitcases. Overall an extremely pleasant experience. Next time I'll stay here.

The hotel is in a good location, 8 or 9 hundred meters away from Shenzhen University Metro Line 1 and 300 meters away from Metro Line 9. The transportation is relatively convenient. The external environment of the hotel is okay, the room facilities and overall service are average, and there is still a long way to go before five stars. When I woke up in the morning, I found a metal object on the bed. Fortunately, it didn't scratch anyone. I was too lazy to argue with the hotel about who belonged to it. There was no disposable comb. When I picked up the comb in the drawer, I saw that it was covered with hair. I have been a customer of Ctrip for 20 years, but overall I have no favorable impression of this hotel. As a senior member of Ctrip, I have had a relatively bad experience in these years.

This should be the first time I write a ** review, because from check-in to check-out, I am really very satisfied in all aspects. I am traveling with my family and my baby. I booked a suite with two rooms inside and outside. I personally feel that the price is not low, but after checking in, I feel that it is worth the money. Even the baby said that he didn't want to leave and liked it here. If you have to say the shortcomings, there are two points: 1. I wanted to put water in the bathtub for the baby to take a bath at night. The water was transparent at first. Later, I went out to watch TV. After a few minutes, I went in again and saw that the water turned yellow. I don’t know why, but it didn’t affect it, so I didn’t tell the room service. Later, we chose to take a shower, and the water in the shower was normal; 2. When having breakfast in the restaurant, the male waiter who collected the plates had a slightly cold attitude. For example, if you say thank you to him, he will not say anything and turn around and leave. Maybe he is a little shy, haha. Overall, 10 points are satisfactory. It is highly recommended for friends who travel with children, couples, and business trips to stay.

msg:A nice light luxury hotel near the center of Nanshan District (Shenzhen Hampus Hotel).
The high-rise viewing room is very nice. I stayed for two nights and slept very comfortably.
It's easy to find the location by navigating. There are also many parking spaces in the hotel. Free parking is also available in the underground parking lot. It feels very luxurious when you enter the lobby. The receptionist at the front desk is very professional, polite and caring. This is the first time I have stayed at a Hampus Hotel.
It's great. It is recommended to book a room with Ctrip to get a lot of discounts.
The front desk clerk asked if you want a high-rise viewing room or the ground floor. It must be a high-rise. Although the hotel has 30 floors, the elevators are very fast and will arrive in a while. There are four elevators in the hotel, so you won’t have to wait too long.
The corridors of the elevators in the hotel have a good smell of perfume. By the way, I booked a landscape suite, which is 28m. The front desk helped me Fal to apply for a deluxe business room.
As soon as you enter the room, you feel like you are at home. It is very clean and simple, with warm and comfortable bathroom facilities (smart toilet), Dr. Yin professional soundproof door, Hunter Roman window
Curtain, President Airland mattress, Australian brand disposable shampoo, sleep professional
Brand carnation 120-count satin polyester-cotton bedding, high-speed wireless network, small and light electric heating equipment, group central air-conditioning and other supporting facilities
The ingenious and comfortable sleeping space provides an elegant stay experience.
One kilometer opposite is the Tencent Building, where you can fully enjoy the city view, 25,
There is a self-service laundry dryer on the 26th floor, but the clothes are not very dry.
Good experience, I will come back next time😁

Environment: The layout of the room is reasonable, all internal organs are complete, and the high floor has a wide view!
Service: Xiao Yang and Xiao Li at the front desk warmly received and upgraded the room for free, thank you very much!
Facilities: The coffee machine is broken, and it’s not particularly bad. It just means that no matter you press a small cup or a large cup, it will keep pouring out water until the water in the water storage at the back is exhausted. So everyone should pay attention to observe!
*Don't ask me how I know, just look at the back of me wiping the table and wiping the floor in a hurry to know why I didn't have time to take a photo. . .
**Small suggestion: From my personal perception, it is better to ask the guest "is the stay good" when checking out than to tell the guest "this is fine" + "make three phone calls after checking out" Feel warmer. ❤️
Although I may not feel right, this is really my little thought. I hope everyone has to help. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The colors of the two toothbrushes have been differentiated for easy use. The wind of the hair dryer is particularly strong and not too hot. I live in the view room on the 31st floor. Invincible, sound insulation is also good, no noise was heard. During the May Day period, the price of the hotel did not increase randomly, which is really rare. Xiaodan at the front desk helped us with luggage storage when we checked out, so that we could go out and play. Everything is very satisfactory, five-star recommendation.

Especially for breakfast, there is still more than half an hour before the meal is closed. Many things are gone. Let’s not talk about it. Feedback to the staff, not only did not solve it, but also felt that we had a problem. Some people even muttered with other employees. Pointing fingers at the guests, it turned out to be the supervisor later, and she wore different clothes from others.

It was already a low-level mistake if things were not ready. After all, this is also a 1000+ hotel, and it is rated according to the 5🌟 standard on Ctrip. This attitude is indeed surprising. It's the first time I've encountered it. If you don't change it, I believe your store's image will be greatly affected.

The aunt's service quality and attitude are very good, but it can be seen that the number of people in the hotel is not enough.
The hotel is an independent hotel, not a chain, not a single building. Maybe it's a bit less ritualistic. Below is Shenzhen University. Every day, I can watch the students take physical education classes and enjoy the youth that we have never enjoyed before. It’s okay￼.

2. Plastic flakes were found in the green vegetables cooked with noodles for breakfast...

For the second incident, the assistant manager of the hotel made a phone call to appease me, and sent a doll and a fruit plate to express my apology, and hoped that it would not happen again.

Generally speaking, it is good, and the flaws are not concealed, and it is well received.

He helped the customer to make perfect arrangements. He took the initiative to remind me that the room has no windows and upgrade to a higher-level room type for free.

msg:I booked a room with a view. First of all, there is obviously a problem with the design of the hotel room. The finished fonts of the doors of the three rooms are distributed. You can hear the opening and closing of the door next door clearly. Secondly, the decoration smell of the room is pungent, and you can’t stop crying when you enter Sneezing, from 3215 to 2815, to 2315, the hotel said that there is no room, because I have been traveling for many days and I am too tired, so I can barely stay. Fortunately, the guy at the front desk sent an air filter, which is fine up! Unexpectedly, the extremely unpleasant thing happened on the second day, around 11:40 (the check-out time has been extended to 2 o’clock), while changing clothes in the room, there were three knocks on the door, and the door was blocked by the waiter before he could react. Open it from the outside (I'm sure the waiter didn't have any other prompts). After the door was opened, the waiter saw someone and not only didn't apologize at all, but turned his face as if no one was there to teach the cleaning lady a lesson. After reporting the matter to the hotel, it was always a lobby assistant manager who came forward to deal with it. Not only did he refuse to apologize, but he also said that the waiter didn't see anything anyway, so the hotel was not at fault, and his attitude was very tough. This kind of service attitude is the first time I have encountered this kind of service attitude in a hotel. I strongly do not recommend friends to stay. I originally booked his hotel because there are few bad reviews, and the good reviews are all brushed up. Whoever stays in a hotel with this kind of service will be unlucky. I really feel angry once I stay in this hotel. I strongly condemn the service of this hotel, and I will give more than 1 point.

I felt that the decoration style was very modern. The floor was high and the interval was square. The hotel had everything. And it has just opened in 2021, clean and managed, and decided to continue the next day.

Later, I met Miss Liang Lidan at the front desk of the hotel, and asked her about the hotel facilities. She took the trouble to explain in detail, and added the contact information. I hope that when I check in again in the future, the check-in procedure will be faster.

Service: The etiquette depar**ent greets you from the moment you enter the hotel, which is very polite. When checking in, Xiao Zhao at the front desk was really nice. It can be said that the professionalism is full, there are taboos and needs for the room, and the attitude and tone of the whole process are very kind.

Environment: The lobby of the hotel is not luxurious, but the hotel pays great attention to the details of the decorations, and the furniture used has a sense of design. The room is also of the modern and refined kind, with first-class views and great details. It's really comfortable to eat snacks while looking at the city view outside.

There are only two small problems: 1. The takeaway is delivered by robots. There are only two robots and they can only deliver one room at a time. The efficiency is too low. It took a long time to wait twice. It is suggested that the staff can also help deliver it when there are many meals, or upgrade the robot.
2. The TV signal in the room is not good. I have to search for the signal and can't see it. I have already asked someone to come and see it. I removed the outer frame of the TV and said that it affected the signal. However, the next day it was still a signal card. And the screen projection function of the TV, I have never found my own room. From time to time, there are projections from other rooms to the TV in my room, and I even saw other people's chat records.

And at this price of more than 400, it can also bring a fully automatic toilet air purifier, and the house area is large. I checked in after 12 o'clock that night. Manager Liu Qian received me and carefully checked the health code and itinerary code, which made me very reassured that I don't have to worry about people living in risky areas of the hotel when there is an epidemic everywhere. . Secondly, after receiving my request, Manager Liu Qian carefully selected an upgraded room type for me. The two floor-to-ceiling windows can directly see Tencent, Baidu, Shenzhen University, and it is very close to the Mixc City.
This stay experience is close to perfect, and it is the best choice for visiting or business trip in Shenzhen. It is also my first choice for my next hotel stay. The price is super high and I really recommend it to everyone!

1. The hotel will help you with luggage to the room;

4. The view outside the window is good.

shortcoming:
1. There are no desks and chairs in the room that can be used for simple work. It is very difficult to get a computer. This is a standard standard that even general express hotels have;
2. There are no racks and hangers for drying clothes, only a small hook on the wall, I don’t know what the design can hang;
3. The smart toilet will automatically spray a very smelly potion spray (it is estimated to be a sterilizer), and it is unbearable to unplug the toilet to use it;
4. There is no clear indication of the charges for beverages in the room.
5. The configuration of the same type of room that others have commented on and posted pictures is different from mine. It is also an upgraded room type. At least others have the first table and chair configuration for their pictures.
6. The room sometimes smells of some disinfectant.
7. There is less food and drink in the surrounding office area.

After answering that it was OK, they called another front desk (maybe the manager) after working for a while. The other front desk directly said that there was no room available. Cannot be exchanged. There was no room available after four o'clock. This store is so popular! !

In addition, the lobby manager Liu Qian was enthusiastic and considerate in his service, and he made a call back visit very seriously.

This hotel is very good, the environment is very high-end, the furnishings in the room are also very smart, the bedding is also very comfortable. One problem is that I don’t know if the towels have been left for a long time and have a peculiar smell. It is also a pity that breakfast is only until 10 o'clock, I have not caught up after sleeping, and wasted breakfast money. Xiao Yang at the front desk has a good service attitude and praises.

When checking in, the young lady at the front desk upgraded the room and also gave the high-floor room type and the view is great I had a good rest for three days

The breakfast itself is simple but basic. It is not rich but exquisite. The only regret is that there are too many people during the breakfast on weekends. I will encounter the situation of table sharing. The experience is not good. It is the next two days that I don’t really want to go for breakfast.

The overall check-in experience is good

I hope the breakfast can be improved and I will stay here next time I come to Shenzhen

🍃Environment: Located in the core area of Nanshan in Shenzhen, it is very convenient to go anywhere. The room has complete facilities, air purifier and capsule coffee machine (the room type I booked has no windows, next to the elevator), the main material is also a good brand (Hansgrohe, TOTO smart toilet seat, etc.)

Overall it is recommended to stay, very cost-effective!

Therefore, I chose Hamps Hotel after several days of comparison and selection on Ctrip. From the airport, take Line 11 to Line 1 Shenzhen University Station and walk more than 700 meters from the station. The transportation is convenient. After the entrance, the lobby of the lobby has a simple and a**ospheric style. During the epidemic, the front desk personnel handled the procedures more quickly and effectively, and it was upgraded to a deluxe king-size bed room. After entering the room, the first thing is to observe the sanitary area. The dry and wet separation area is very user-friendly. I am used to sleeping with latex pillows and asked the room depar**ent to send them. The first day of staying was very good, so I chose to stay for another 3 days, no longer entangled with other hotels. In addition, I would like to talk about the hospitality of Manager Liu in the lobby, and also specially presented a welcome fruit, thank you very much. Next time I come to Shenzhen, I will continue to stay.

After arriving at the hotel, may the other person see us as two? Also upgraded to a twin room. There are windows to see the scenery outside. Although it faces the street, the soundproofing effect is quite good, and I barely heard any noise after staying for one night. Needless to say, the sanitary conditions, the facilities inside and outside the room are also very comprehensive, and the decoration style is good. The service attitude is good. After leaving the store, Xiao He also asked about the check-in experience. It can be said that it exceeded expectations, and the price for two people is also considered cost-effective.

The night view on the 34th floor is very good, the facilities are very complete, clean and tidy, the ToTo is complete, the room is big enough, the soundproofing is also good, and there is a coffee machine ☕️, suitable for me who are heavy coffee *******
The front desk service is also very timely, and the order of takeaway will be delivered to the door by the robot. When we checked out, it was very good for us to store our luggage, and my mother asked me to be named and praised.
The price of around five hundred is a surprise, which made my first impression of Shenzhen very good.

Exhausted physically and mentally, I booked a hotel near the Shenzhen Bay Port and made preparations for staying. When I checked in, I upgraded my room for free. It is clean and tidy. Mi TV can also broadcast all variety shows. It's about 8 minutes by taxi from Vientiane City, and I can go to the Talent Plaza for a stroll. I was in a gloomy mood, but I still got a lot of comfort when I checked in. 😂❤️ Next time I cross the Shenzhen Bay Port, I will consider staying again.

She was very gentle and asked if I had any needs. After checking out, the front desk asked me to check in. What’s the experience? The little Yang girl from the concierge of the luggage storage is very serious and cute. I asked her what the aromatherapy is used in the hotel. She went to the front desk and asked and told me that she also asked for a car for me. Although these are the standard equipment of 5 star hotels, it is hard to be able to use your heart. Forgot to say, the hotel's aromatherapy smells really good. People who have never commented did not hold back Hobbit today

msg:I have been very busy and have not commented. This is also my first time to comment, so I am really disappointed. Among the Five Star Street hotels I have stayed at, this is the one with the worst experience. From one in the morning to five in the morning, all the lights and curtains suddenly opened uncontrollably. I called the front desk and they said they were repairing it, but they did not inform us that this would happen. They told us that it would not happen again. This situation happened again and again five times, and we found the solution by ourselves by unplugging the power card. The next morning, I went to the front desk to report the problem. The person at the front desk asked the manager to solve the problem. The manager compensated us in the form of fruit and meal coupons, but did not apologize for our lack of rest all night. Anyway, it is not necessary for work and I will never stay here again.

①劉經理幫忙免費升級了房型，第一印象很好
②酒店附近有茶餐廳，出門左手邊繼續走還有24小時的腸粉店
③200-300是9號線粵海門；深大1號線也不遠交通比較方便的
④旁邊有很多掃碼自行車想去吃個夜宵不遠，木屋燒烤大概1.2km
⑤房間熱水比較舒適，房間也寬敞
❤︎ 幾點不足之處
①客房衞生上有時候有放浴室門地墊有時候沒有
②餐廳初一開始真的太擁擠，而且我們住了5天衹有最後一天3歲的孩子才起得來，因為他睡得比較晚，餐廳去拿打包盒總是不是太爽快

房間清潔乾淨，唯獨廁所較細，有點壓迫感。

所以又續訂了。

這次從一開始就有一點不愉快，但也能接受。

攜程下的訂單，打電話給前台要開行程單，前台和我説沒這個東西這個服務，讓我自己找攜程下。ok  我找攜程。

後面**跑腿送東西過去，確定前台禮賓已經收到東西了。我們打電話給前台，第一反應就是告訴我們沒收到物品（不經確認向我提供錯誤訊息）。於是我又找跑腿確認，對方給了我照片。又一次打給前台，才拿到我的東西。這事問題在於：1.酒店不讓快遞之類的上樓，又不能做好銜接工作，給住客添麻煩；2.工作人員能力與態度問題，為什麼不確認下再給住户回覆，徒生波折。

後面離店，行李寄存問題。物品放在禮賓部，我們的車到了提前去拿，打電話給前台（首頁衹有一個電話）提前交代一下。前台的第一反應不是完成這個內部溝通工作，而是和我説：“好的，我幫你轉給禮賓部，你這邊和禮賓部溝通”
我：！？？
不是你們一個公司，都是前廳人員，我一個需求還要和你們兩個部門的人溝通，你們自己不能內部完成接洽嗎？要增加住户的溝通成本。

不懂酒店的職責規劃和分工是怎麼樣的，但是接電話是個很重要的工作。貴司沒有總機這個職能嗎？給你們打電話講事情真的累，這次入住體驗很糟糕。時隔半個月想起來還是好無語。

唯一美中不足的就是一進房間還是會有一股潮濕的味道，這個可能是和最近廣東連續陰雨天氣有關，開了冷氣後味道就會消失，酒店在這方面可以多加強，總體入住下來感覺是瑕不掩瑜的。

不過要特別一提，個度的咖啡真係好好飲👍👍👍一定要讚

msg:整體滿意，酒店設施很新，週末出差來深圳，價格稍微比平時貴點，但是完全可以接受。但是兩點問題很影響體驗：

1，浴室的花灑水流太小太小了，不知是樓層高的因素還是什麼，建議改進一下，太影響洗澡體驗。

2，很多博主的評價，都説冰箱裏的飲料和膠囊咖啡都是免費的，喝完了第二天還可以補。結果收了30塊錢。這個感受特別不好，房間內沒有放價格標簽，評論裏又是免費，最後收了錢。不是錢的問題，這種感覺不是很舒服，
