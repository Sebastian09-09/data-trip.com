I have also enjoyed afternoon tea in the hotel lobby and Beijing Liang Restaurant. Taking advantage of the short holiday and anniversary, I checked in with my lover to stay in the hotel. I called to communicate the needs before booking. I would like to thank Eileen He, the deputy manager of guest experience, for arranging the room in advance, upgrading the room type, and adding WeChat to communicate at any time. Because the holiday was full, she also reminded us to avoid the peak period for breakfast. Overall, I am very satisfied. The room layout is very comfortable and really feels like home. The home outside the home in the greeting card is also very heartwarming, and the handwriting is also very beautiful. I also like the spa and infinity pool equipped with the hotel. In short, it is the best choice for couples to travel, family gatherings, and friends to dine together.

In addition, I would like to thank the front desk receptionist Mamie and the housekeeper Rose. We arrived at the hotel at 2:30 in the afternoon. Because the room was being cleaned, we were asked to wait in the restaurant on the 62nd floor. Because we bought a double package, we could drink free drinks, coffee, tea, and fruits. The children were also very happy to eat. The room was also clean, and the shower faucet was very full and quite comfortable. Believe in Park Hyatt! A great stay experience!

The room supplies were also sufficient every day, the sanitation was very clean, and the breakfast was also delicious. It left us with a good impression of Beijing! Give a big thumbs up to Jenny. I will choose to stay in Beijing next time.

msg:Arrived at the hotel at 11pm. The concierge on the first floor said to send my luggage to the room.
When I went upstairs to the front desk, the music was deafening and annoying.
No one greeted me when I arrived. I asked if they could help me see if there was a non-smoking room, not a large bed with beds pushed together, and the floor was farther apart. The front desk said you should pay for an upgrade. The hotel was fully booked that night. I said you should find a room first. I booked a month in advance, and you cannot cancel it. Then my colleague Ctrip sold a room with a good view with breakfast included, which was cheaper than what I booked. So the front desk reluctantly gave me the room. I waited for my luggage for half an hour after entering the room, but it didn't come. It was almost midnight. I urged it twice before it came.
After getting the luggage, I wanted to charge my phone first, so I plugged it into the charging port normally, and the charging device actually fell off. Just like that, I was asked to pay at the front desk again. That's fine. I lifted the quilt and there were black spots on the bed sheet, which couldn't be rubbed off. Then I put up with it. Just after I sat down, I saw the words "cleaning tomorrow" written on the table. I called to ask which day. The guest service and the front desk on the phone said they didn't know either. If they didn't know, they kept saying tomorrow, tomorrow.
I wanted to brush my teeth late at night afterwards. I found that the sink was still blocked. I took it out and saw that it was full of hair. I knocked and flushed a bunch of hair down. I thought I was your hotel cleaner. It was so insulting. Then I called the hotel and they said they would fix it and change the sheets right away. Do you have any sense of time? What time is it? It's midnight. I said I would change the room now. How could this hotel have the courage to do this? The hotel said they would change it tomorrow. I said I would go to the front desk to check. When the hotel heard that I was going to the front desk, they had a room. It was a suite. It was really a hassle. I changed the room in the early morning. Then I met the housekeeping when I went out the next day. They asked me to write a letter of praise for them. Am I here to spend money or make money? The pillows are all reflective. What are you praising? Her original words were, "Are you satisfied? I put some fruit. Have you eaten it?" I was in the elevator and she was chasing me and said, "My name is so-and-so." I was convinced.

1. Before check-in, the manager Eileen and I communicated the needs by email, and I felt the seriousness and thoughtfulness of the hotel.
2. The private butler Mika contacted us the day before check-in. In addition to confirming the needs, she once again expressed her blessings for our anniversary. In addition, she was very considerate to help us upgrade the room and decorate the room. The little surprise really left a deep impression on us. Thank you Mika.
3. The night view of Beijing is very good, and she helped us reserve a seat by the window. The food standard is very high and good.
In general, the level and service of Park Hyatt Hotel are very good. If there is a chance in the future, I will still choose Park Hyatt Hotel again.

msg:After a satisfactory stay on New Year's Day, I chose Park Hyatt Beijing again this time. The night before check-in, Mika Xu, the guest supervisor, did not forget to call to inquire about check-in requirements and provide travel tips (I thought she would not be able to take care of it due to the busy May Day holiday). On the same day, Rose, the front desk, was also very polite and kind to help with check-in. However, there were too many people that day, so we arranged afternoon tea and waited for the room. The room was not cleaned until four o'clock. The room was arranged according to the requirements. The view of the high-floor room was also closer to the big pants than the room checked in on New Year's Day. People with obsessive-compulsive disorder need to consider it. The washbasin area is tilted as a whole, and the two lights on the mirror are still crooked. It is not easy to make the decoration on the bathtub not crooked. 
There are also some problems with hygiene. The blinds are dusty and it is obvious when the sun shines in. There are long hair on the floor. Moreover, the glass windows were bright and clean before. This time, there was no clean glass from the lobby to the bar and in the room. 
As expected, there were long queues for breakfast on the second and third days, and we had to wait in line for quite a while (no need to think about the old seats we liked), and the food was also so-so that the pancakes and cream were broken after we ordered, and the orange juice was not replenished for a long time.
All in all, the experience of this stay was average.

The hotel's luxury and attention to detail are everywhere, making people feel both comfortable and noble.

Special thanks to the hotel manager Mika and Rose who checked me in. They not only made my journey start exceptionally smoothly with their enthusiastic and professional service attitude, but also brought me an unexpected surprise-upgrade to the 200-square-meter presidential suite. Rose was meticulous in the check-in process, and every step was in order, which made people feel very reassured and comfortable. Manager Mika showed her excellent management ability and deep understanding of guests' needs. She not only came to ask about my needs in person, but also gave me a lot of help in aspects such as restaurant arrangements and travel, which made my accommodation experience impeccable.
The suite is spacious and luxurious, with a panoramic view of the city of Beijing outside the window, and every detail reflects the hotel's careful care for guests. Such upgraded services exceeded my expectations and made every minute and every second of my stay at the Park Hyatt Beijing particularly memorable.
In short, Park Hyatt Beijing not only has amazing hardware facilities, but also warm and home-like service. Thanks to Mika and Rose, and all the staff, you made my trip to Beijing even more perfect. I look forward to returning here again in the near future and enjoying the unparalleled service and experience here again.

msg:Park Hyatt Beijing: The perfect combination of elegant experience and meticulous service

In busy urban life, a wonderful accommodation experience can often make people temporarily forget their worries and enjoy a moment of tranquility and comfort. It was May Day recently, and I was fortunate enough to stay at the Park Hyatt Hotel located in the core CBD of Beijing. This was not only a simple accommodation experience, but also an in-depth experience of high-quality services.

As soon as I stepped into the hotel lobby, I was attracted by the elegant and peaceful a**osphere. The spacious space design, exquisite decorative details and soft lighting all make people feel the warmth of home. Here, every corner reveals the low-key luxury and exquisite elegance unique to the Park Hyatt brand.

One day in advance, Xu Wenli and Mika called me to inquire about cleaning the room and checking in. Their enthusiasm and professionalism left a deep impression on me. Whether it was the selection of rooms or the introduction of various hotel facilities, she was patient and meticulous, answering my questions one by one. Rose, with her efficient and precise working style, ensured that my check-in process was smooth and hassle-free. Her professionalism and passion for work gave me a deeper understanding of the service quality of Park Hyatt Hotel.

The room we stayed in was equally satisfactory. The spacious space, comfortable bedding and complete facilities make people feel like home. Especially the night view outside the window is even more intoxicating. Whenever night falls, standing in front of the window, overlooking the bustling scene of Beijing, a city that never sleeps, the fatigue in my heart seems to be swept away.

However, after a few days of enjoying it, I also found some areas for improvement. As an important part of hotel services, breakfast's quality and variability are crucial to enhancing guest experience. At the Park Hyatt Hotel, although the breakfast options are rich and semi-buffet style, there are not many changes. This limits the taste bud experience of guests to a certain extent, and may also make guests who dine here for many consecutive days feel a little monotonous. Therefore, I suggest that the hotel can add some changes and innovations to the breakfast dishes, such as introducing some local specialties, or adjusting the menu according to seasonal changes, so that guests can enjoy different cultures and flavors while enjoying the food.

Overall, Park Hyatt Beijing gave me an unforgettable stay with its elegant environment, meticulous service and charming night view. Although there are still some shortcomings in areas such as breakfast, I believe that with the continuous improvement and development of the hotel, these problems will be properly solved. I look forward to staying at the Park Hyatt again in the future and continuing to enjoy my wonderful stay here.

It is worthy of being the best hotel in terms of environment, facilities and service. Emily contacted me one day before check-in and arranged a room for me. She also arranged a room with a good view as much as possible (I could see the China Bottle and the Yangguang Building). The children were very happy after entering the room. The swimming pool was also very clean. Breakfast was on the top floor, with a great view, rich dishes and high quality! There were also foreign waiters! The next day, my baby had a fever, so I called the front desk. The front desk staff and Mika Xu Wenli were very understanding and arranged a late check-out. Thank you very much! I checked in successfully and was very happy with the service provided by Park Hyatt! I will definitely stay here again next time!

msg:The hotel registration lobby can see the Tiananmen Tower and the Forbidden City. The location is excellent, but because it is along Chang'an Avenue, there are often traffic controls. Downstairs is the shopping mall - there are many foods on the first floor, which is quite good. Opposite is the Guomao shopping mall, which is very large and convenient for shopping. Let's talk about the hotel. The room was cleaned very well on the first day. Knowing that my child needs to make milk, they put a few more bottles of water for me and left me a note. Such customer service staff should be praised. On the second day, the cleaner changed people and didn't put a new toothbrush for me. Three toothbrushes were used. My husband forgot what color he had and opened a new one, but I remembered the color and threw away the only one of different colors. The remaining two were my husband's. I called room service to send a new toothbrush. The person who sent it also told me that there was a new one in the drawer. I said I saw that there was no new one. It can't be that I just want to take advantage of your new toothbrush. If you want to take advantage, you should ask for two. The overall service is OK. It is worth mentioning that you cannot wear room slippers during the breakfast buffet. I think a note could be left in the room to remind you. There are not many types of breakfast, but some of them can be ordered, which is quite convenient. It's just that the wait is a bit long when there are a lot of customers. The Chinese restaurant on the registration floor of the hotel is very good, the service is very good, and they made us stewed pear juice which is not on the menu.

msg:This time I brought my baby to Beijing during off-peak hours. I stayed at Park Hyatt from 4/26 to 5/2 for six consecutive nights. The hotel is in a good location. It is basically 5 or 6 kilometers away from the National Museum, Tiananmen Square, Temple of Heaven, and the Forbidden City. There were not many people before May Day, so it only took 15-20 minutes by taxi.

Environment: The hotel is in a high-rise area with a wide view. You can see CCTV's big pants.
Hygiene: The cleaning aunt is very responsible every day, cleans up very diligently, and greets people when she sees them
Facilities: New, Dyson hair dryer, hahahaüòÑ
Service: The hotel has very good service, especially Eileen He, the deputy manager of the guest experience depar**ent, who prepared extra beds and welcome fruits in advance, and asked about our needs every day
In addition to the buffet part, the hotel's breakfast also has a part of a la carte system. I especially mentioned her waffles, which are better than the ones I ate at the Peninsula Shanghai, üòÇ...
I will choose Park Hyatt next time I come to Beijing!

The hotel is in an excellent location. Just across the road, you can reach the China World Trade Center, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.
The hotel's hardware facilities are relatively simple. The hardware can be seen to be quite old, but it is well maintained.
The breakfast is very rich, with both self-service and semi-self-service, and the Western pastries taste great.
It is worth mentioning that before checking out, the housekeeper Kang Lili asked about the stay experience very considerately, recorded special needs and other situations, and provided gifts and fruits. I like her enthusiastic service~ The staff of the concierge depar**ent are also very enthusiastic.
Next time I come to Beijing with my family, I will choose here again.

msg:I regret writing my first negative review in more than ten years.
I have stayed at Park Hyatt in other places many times. My impression of Park Hyatt Beijing is really incredible. As an old five-star hotel, its service, management and facilities are so poor.
After getting off the plane and arriving at the hotel lobby, I wanted to go to the hotel lobby for afternoon tea. The waiter guided me to see if I had reserved a seat. I said no and took me to a very remote location. I said I was a hotel guest and I wanted to sit at the Scenic View. She insisted that I couldn‚Äôt sit without a reservation. After being booked by other guests, I asked her the time of the guest's reservation. I could complete it within an hour. She hesitated. Then another waiter took me to a view seat. The end was from beginning to end until I left the afternoon tea area. Many view seats were empty for the second time. When I asked about the afternoon tea menu, it only had tea and salty desserts. I asked the waiter about the content of the hotel‚Äôs afternoon tea. I didn‚Äôt know. So the manager probably came over and answered my question. Then he took me to the dessert table. I made it clear if there were simple meals like sandwiches, which they didn‚Äôt have in the hotel. I said, if I order food in my room, will I be told that it will take a long time? I can order takeout. I said, let‚Äôs order a pot of tea and sit here for a while because I originally wanted to take some photos. I said, let me order takeout. The man in the black suit actually used The strange words and looks said we can't eat takeout here. I said I know, so I ordered takeout. When I arrived, I went to eat in the room. Could you please say sorry, ma'am? We are dining in and don't allow outside food. As a five-star manager level The hotel's basic service standards are still like your Beijing Park Hyatt. Later, I saw that you are not like this at all to foreign friends. Later, the man in the suit gave me a salty snack and a dessert. At first, I refused and he said that he didn't want you to have an unpleasant experience. I said, if you want to give it to me, just give it to me, so I also finished one of the cakes. The dessert was still good, but I was no longer in the mood. The question "Can I cancel the room tonight" was already stuck in my throat, asking the hotel waiter about the breakfast time. It's just a different person to answer. The facilities in the room are not so new. After all, it has been normal for a long time. When taking a bath, the shower head is cracked and leaking. Beijing Park Hyatt, are you kidding me? I don‚Äôt care about the welcome fruits. The drinks in the small refrigerator in the room are charged. Only the mineral water on the table is free. Okay, these are the rules of your hotel. So, as long as you are a foreigner, you will have a shower head for breakfast in your hotel. Greeted with a smile and said hello. I raised the above questions with the front desk about the shower head, but the answer was my official I will report it and that‚Äôs the end of it.

First of all, I was impressed by the cleanliness of the Park Hyatt Hotel. Each room is kept very clean, making people feel comfortable and relaxed. This cleanliness is not only reflected on the surface, but also in every corner of the hotel, which makes people feel the professionalism and care of the Park Hyatt Hotel.

Secondly, I would like to mention the housekeeper Song Yu in particular. He is very responsible, always smiling, and ready to help us at any time. Whether it is to inquire about hotel facilities or to solve our needs, he can respond quickly and provide satisfactory solutions. His professional quality and enthusiastic service made me deeply feel the service level of the Park Hyatt Hotel.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the experience of the Park Hyatt Hotel. The cleanliness of the hotel and the responsible attitude of the housekeeper Song Yu made me feel the quality of the Park Hyatt Hotel. I strongly recommend this hotel to friends who need to find comfortable accommodation and quality service.

Of course, everyone's needs and preferences may be different, so when choosing a hotel, it is recommended that everyone choose according to their actual situation and preferences. At the same time, the Park Hyatt Hotel can also be used as a reference. After all, its cleanliness and quality service are obvious to all.

msg:Booked for 2 days, planned to check in at the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, but on the first night of check-in, the sharp corner of the glass door of the shower room cut my toe. The sharp corner was very sharp, and a lot of blood came out on the spot. The hotel did emergency trea**ent, and the toe was still very painful, which affected the itinerary on the second day.
It is difficult to evaluate the hotel's handling process. After calling the hotel for help, the staff came to disinfect and their attitude was relatively good. But when someone else came to "greet" us the next day, he didn't ask if we were feeling better, but directly said "You should pay more attention to these sharp corners" and "You should pay attention to other sharp places in the room." I don't know if I over-understood or what, but I really didn't like to hear these at the time. It turned out that I bumped into it, mainly because I didn't pay attention?
In the end, this matter was left unresolved. Overall, for a well-known luxury hotel, I still feel very disappointed in terms of safety hazards and the ability to deal with problems.
Objectively speaking, breakfast service is still quite good.

If you want to see the big pants, just wait for breakfast and go to the restaurant on the 66th floor early to find a good seat. The breakfast is exquisite. There are not many buffet varieties and not many orders. The waffles are okay. Other egg pancakes, beef noodles, fried noodles, wonton dumplings, beef buns, etc. are tasteless. Is Beijing a food desert? However, it should be noted that it is best to call in advance to confirm whether there is a room, because we booked a room very early. When we arrived at around 5 pm that day, we were told that the room was being cleaned and it would take 40 minutes, but it was not available until nearly 7 pm. Room, reception attitude at the front desk was very good, I believe it is a hotel management problem. It is close to Exit C and D of Guomao Station of the subway. There are some restaurants at Exit C, but Exit C cannot lead to the hotel. Note that there is no restaurant at Exit D. Overall, nothing special.

We also prepared welcome cakes and fruits, which were fresh and delicious. There is really nothing to say about the scenery of the Park Hyatt. Just make an appoin**ent. We watched the sunset in the restaurant and the sunrise in the room. It was so satisfying! The restaurant also decorated the dining table and hand-painted greeting cards, what a surprise~
Every service staff we met was very nice, and the hotel handled some minor incidents very well. The most impressive thing was the bartender in the restaurant, a male waiter with a strong Beijing accent, who introduced the wine very well. He was meticulous and professional. He tried a lot for us and the last few he recommended were very suitable for the dishes we ordered. Although I don‚Äôt know his name, I really appreciate it! And the young lady who took the photo for us did a great job, it was really a photo of life! In short, I am super grateful to everyone I met ~ without you, there would be no wonderful anniversary for us!
I remembered that when I was a kid, my mother always had a membership with her, so I always came here to eat with her. The cheesecake this time still tasted the same as in the memory, and I suddenly felt nostalgic.

Every waiter in the hotel from the front desk to the room service and the catering department is very good, meticulous, patient and thoughtful. Our whole family had a great time at the hotel. There are also many varieties of breakfast, and they all taste delicious. I accidentally stepped on the ground and sprained my toe in the swimming pool. The lifeguard took immediate care of me. In the evening, the housekeeping department brought ice cubes and Yunnan Baiyao, which gave me a very warm feeling.
Today, the fifth day of the ***** New Year, there is a lion dance performance in the hotel. The night view of Beijing from the hotel is also very beautiful. I am very happy to stay at your hotel next time.

msg:Family trip, a family of three, stayed for three days. It felt quite satisfactory. It was much different from Suzhou Park Hyatt. It can't be compared. The hotel lobby is on the 63rd floor. To check in and go to the room, you need to take another elevator. When you leave the hotel, you have to go back to the 63rd floor. , it‚Äôs a bit troublesome to take another elevator downstairs, but the elevator is really fast, and the night view of Chang‚Äôan Street is really good. Unfortunately, the lighting is not fully turned on. The room size is sufficient and the facilities are complete, which are all found in hotels. The bathroom is not closed and is connected to the pool. I don‚Äôt know what the design is. It feels very cold when taking a bath! The toiletries come in large bottles, which seems a bit cheap. The pillows are uncomfortable, the latex pillows are too short, and the down pillows are too soft. The sofa in the room is really good and long. It can accommodate one more person with a quilt. The room comes with a free welcome Fruits, a few poor sugar oranges. I remember when I checked in, my child asked the front desk if there could be welcome fruits every day, but the service staff didn‚Äôt dare to say anything. Hey, sugar oranges, what are you afraid of? I scared you, I thought they were bananas and apples. Well, we only ate one in 3 days! The breakfast is Western style. I would like to thank the hotel staff Pei Wenlu for giving us a free experience breakfast for three people a day. The swimming pool is not big and the management is not very good. You can wear a swimming cap or a swimming cap in the water. No one cares about it. Spa trea**ent The area is closed during the Spring Festival. Bath soap bottles fall off easily in the bathing area. It feels like there is a lack of maintenance. It is surrounded by the Guomao Business District. It is convenient to go anywhere, but the cost is high. The subway is very close and you don't have to go out of the building. The house price is around 2,000. That's all. Bar

The direct access to Yintai Center downstairs is very convenient for shopping and dining. The Beijing Liang Restaurant on the 66th floor is indeed very expensive and suitable for business banquets and check-in for ladies. You can experience the breakfast for breakfast and the beautiful view. There are two high-temperature massage pools beside the main swimming pool, which is very friendly. The only thing is that the lighting in the swimming pool is limited, the bottom tiles of the pool are dark and dark, and the room facilities are very new and unique in design.

msg:This time I came to Beijing for the view of the Park Hyatt, and I was unexpectedly satisfied. From the interior furnishings to the service, everything was impeccable.

Except for the door on the first floor which is a bit inconspicuous, everything else is perfect. The design of check-in, hotel lobby and elevator on the 63rd floor all demonstrate the combination of Chinese style and low-key luxury.

I personally prefer room designs that are not too conventional but square and square. The interior design of the rooms at Park Hyatt Beijing perfectly meets my needs. There is a retractable door between the bathtub and the room, which will prevent the room from getting wet. The view is also good, but maybe because I checked in early, I didn't get a room facing the Big Underpants, but it's still nice to be able to see the night view of the Big Underpants and Chang'an Street at the same time. The spare parts are all from Le Labo, and the SANTAL33 woody tone is also my favorite, very classy! In fact, before I checked in, I saw a review from a few months ago saying that the hair dryer was old and I was a little worried. It turned out that I had replaced it with a Dyson, and I felt so happy!

The hotel's breakfast is located on the 66th floor, with good views from all sides. There are not many types of dishes in the self-service dining area, but it can satisfy Chinese stomachs and brunch lovers, and the food is pretty good. The portions a la carte are not very big, so you can try one or two more. The beef noodles are delicious and the spicy oil is also very fragrant. Like most hotels, room slippers cannot be worn in the restaurant for the safety of guests. But I will remind them very thoughtfully, and give them a pair of non-slip slippers when they arrive. Zhu Rui will stand at the door like a teaching director and call the guests to go back to the room to change shoes.

Here comes the most important part! The most satisfying thing about Park Hyatt this time is Park Hyatt‚Äôs service. In addition to the restaurant services mentioned earlier, as well as basic luggage services, the entire hotel staff can quickly respond to guests' requests, which is really a weapon to enhance the hotel experience. In particular, GR Mamie, Miss Xu Wenli, who arranged my stay this time, contacted me in advance the day before check-in and understood my need to check in earlier. Even though the room was full the day before, she arranged a room for me. They also thoughtfully prepared small desserts (the cream is delicious!) and gave us a bottle of red wine, which was really sweet! After checking in, Mamie also carefully introduced the cultural design of the Park Hyatt Hotel on the way to the room. She also found other topics to make the whole chat interesting. I had other needs during my stay, and I told Mamie and got a timely response. It can be said that Mamie was the biggest surprise that made me feel happier during my stay at the Park Hyatt ‚ù§Ô∏è The rest of the room service was also very good. I went out to play in the afternoon. When I came back in the evening, the bed was turned down, water and tissues were replenished, and pillows were prepared in advance according to my needs. If you need to make up something, calling the housekeeping depar**ent is very efficient and can be delivered quickly.

Overall, I am very satisfied with Park Hyatt Beijing in terms of landscape furnishings and services. I will choose Park Hyatt again next time I come to Beijing.

The problem is that the hotel parking fee is expensive. I hope to negotiate with the relevant depar**ents. I have come to the hotel several times and have never received accommodation discounts. I have proposed it every time but it has not changed. From check-in to check-out, I spent 200+ parking fees to negotiate and solve the problem. It‚Äôs not difficult. The key point is whether the guest experience and suggestions are put first. The hotel accommodation experience, room service, scenery and location are not outstanding. I hope the hotel can make some changes that are convenient for guests. I look forward to not charging for parking fees next time I stay. trouble

msg:After comparing for a long time, I finally chose to propose at the Park Hyatt. I booked a corner room with a CBD view. I was originally worried that the room was not big enough, but the space in the room was actually very well utilized. There was a corner, a spacious corridor, and a large round dining table. Although there are no particularly large floor-to-ceiling windows, the windows in two directions make the house very transparent, and the light and shadow of the blinds give it a retro feel.
Because it was a proposal and I needed to decorate the room myself, I contacted the hotel‚Äôs guest experience depar**ent in advance. Eileen took the initiative to join me and provided a lot of help throughout the process. I was given red wine, cake and fruit as gifts, helped book a hotel restaurant view table, and contacted the concierge to help transport things and delay check-out. The hand-drawn greeting card is also a surprise. Eileen's words, paintings, and blessings are all very well written, and it can be seen that she puts a lot of thought into it. The overall stay experience is excellent and must be praised!
The bright high-altitude view of the lobby and Beijing is still very unique, unlocking a new perspective on Beijing. Choosing Park Hyatt Beijing this weekend was beyond expectations!

At Park Hyatt, you can see Beijing that others cannot. There is sunshine that breaks through the smog here. If by chance, it falls in the oversized bathtub, time and space are frozen here. You might think that in New York, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, I like this "vacuum" feeling, which is the mindfulness of urbanites only.
From the 63rd floor lobby, you can vaguely see the Forbidden City. In addition to high-rise buildings, there are also red city walls and yellow leaves. If you are familiar with Beijing, you can see the Temple of Sun and Yonghe Temple from a certain angle. This is Beijing, but not just Beijing. Park Hyatt represents an attitude and a standard, which is achieved by both guests and hosts. Even across the country, Park Hyatt's service and details are commendable. Park Hyatt, goodbye!

msg:I was tired of staying at school and wanted to find a five-star hotel in Beijing to stay for two nights, so I chose the Park Hyatt among hotels of similar quality.
       The hotel lobby is located on the 63rd floor of the China World Trade Center Yintai Center. Perhaps because the lobby is not on the first floor, the doorman at the front door did not open the door or carry my luggage (although I only had one bag, it was not until the front desk on the 63rd floor that I asked if I needed help carrying my luggage) ), it was raining when we left, and there was no help in opening the door or holding an umbrella. There was no suitable waiting area, and the doorman had no smile on his face.
       There was no problem with other services, especially Elieen who added WeChat to inquire about my needs before checking in. Later, I just mentioned in the circle of friends that I wanted to eat chocolates and they delivered them. It was a surprise and praise!
       After all, the facilities are not a new hotel. Although the overall maintenance is good, for example, the TV does not have a screen projection function and the hair dryer is average. In addition to the swimming pool, the steam sauna in the women's locker room is not open or broken. There is neither steam nor enough temperature.
       Finally, it feels a bit strange. Does Park Hyatt's shampoo and the like now come in large bottles? Even the next-level Hyatt has a small package. Although I don‚Äôt particularly mind it, I feel strange. Let‚Äôs talk about a common question asked by the Hyatt Group: Should we really not consider giving the room a free minbar? At least the administrative benefits are freeüÜòOne can of Coke for 35 is really embarrassing

First of all, I had an early flight and checked out at around 5 a.m. The plane landed. It was already 2 p.m. when I arrived home from the airport. During the entire period, I did not receive any calls or notifications from the hotel that I had left something in the room. I took the initiative to call the front desk and asked them to help me with the inquiry. They immediately responded to me. A full twenty minutes passed with no reply. I called them again to ask how efficient the hotel was. At this moment, the hotel staff said that something was left in the room and they forgot to reply. I was completely speechless! ! !
I specifically asked the hotel to pack some for me and send them back. I'll pay for the postage. The result! ! ! Oh my god, these are my clothes crumpled into a ball and sent back to me like garbage! ! ! terrible! ! ! I also left items behind at Andaz Shenzhen before. The hotel packaged it very well and sent it back to me. This is the difference. I never write reviews, but Park Hyatt Beijing will always be blacklisted and always have bad reviews.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location and is convenient for travel. Turn left when you go out and you will find Metro Line 1.
The front desk of the hotel is on the 63rd floor. On the first day when I arrived, my mother was attracted by the night view of Beijing outside the floor-to-ceiling windows.
The room was spacious, and snacks and fruits were given on the first day. The savior arrived at night and was already extremely hungry.
The supplies are all available and can be used smoothly. If you need anything else, just contact the service staff. It is very convenient. Mamie Xu Wenli's service attitude is very good.
The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room can see the bustling traffic in Beijing during the day and night. It is also very happy to sit on the sofa in a daze. It seriously affects the tourism of the special forces! Friends who have time, remember to watch the sunset in Beijing! üåÑ
It's worth mentioning that the breakfast was great! Very rich, healthy ingredients, on the 66th floor, and enjoying the view at the same time.
Finally, I have some personal thoughts. The room light controls are all buttons, which are a bit complicated and slightly difficult for elders to use. The night light under the sink cannot be completely turned off, which is a bit helpless for people who need to sleep in complete darkness.
But Beijing is really dry!
Overall, I'm still very happy~

I didn't call until after 5 o'clock in the evening when I checked in to inform me that the room was ready. It was too inefficient. Is it because guests check out too late or because the cleaning staff is inefficient? Hope Park Hyatt solves this problem and gets better.

Facilities: The guest room faces Guomao CBD directly, and the night view is beautiful. The bathroom products are from le labo, I like them.

msg:A hotel that made my trip full of regrets.
First of all, the room photos don't match the reality. When the hotel's customer service lady Rose told me that I was arranged on the 60th floor and sent me a route map, I was very happy. However, when I entered the room, I found that the middle of the bedroom window on the 60th floor was closed, with only blinds on both sides, but the website The photo posted above shows the entire surface with glass windows. When I asked to change rooms, a front desk lady came up with a slightly hunched back and no smile on her face. She went to another Park Hyatt suite. The bedroom window was not blocked, but the closet was close to the shower room, and the shower room It was not completely enclosed, which meant that my clothes would get wet, which made me hesitant. Later, I changed to a young lady who was more friendly and said that there was an executive suite, but it would cost an extra 3,000 per night. Of course it was not suitable. In the end, I had no choice but to choose the original room, feeling very depressed.
In addition, the room design is very unreasonable. Not to mention that the glass in the shower room is not completely closed, the shower is a bit cold, and there is no suitable place to put the suitcase. I thought I would put it in the middle of the closet, but when I put it up, I realized that unless it was a very small box, it would get stuck on the cabinet door and make it impossible to open it. I had no choice but to put them on the table in the bedroom, and then asked them to bring a luggage rack to keep the two boxes in place.
Furthermore, when it comes to catering, I always thought this should be Park Hyatt‚Äôs strength, but I was also a little disappointed. There are few varieties, almost no Chinese dishes, most of them are staple food. There is an older aunt who has been working hard to make pancakes and fruit, but the taste is average, the glutinous rice chicken is not hot enough, and there are not many types of bread and cakes. The most impressive one is a chicken pancake, which tastes pretty good. The service staff are very enthusiastic and proactive in closing the discs. I don‚Äôt know if it was a requirement of the building in the past. The dining table is not close to the floor-to-ceiling windows, but is some distance away. As a result, there are frame restrictions when taking pictures outside the window.
The best view is probably from the gym. The fitness equipment is quite complete. Opposite is the view of Beijing CBD. However, when I stayed at Park Hyatt Shenzhen before, the gym had fruit and oa**eal energy bars. There are no fruits and oa**eal energy bars here. The reception staff were not enthusiastic. One time it seemed like Or the cleaning staff.
In short, I had a lot of choices before departure and chose the Park Hyatt Beijing. However, I was very disappointed. It was not as good as the Waldorf Astoria where I stayed previously. In today's fierce competition in the hotel industry, we really need to improve.

msg:If the price is similar, I advise everyone to stay in other hotels and don‚Äôt go through the same trap as we did!
Maybe the price of the Park Hyatt comes from the location fee. This was my second trip to Beijing after fifteen years, and I didn‚Äôt expect the hotel I picked to be so disappointing.
The hotel starts from the 37th floor and goes up. Because I heard that the breakfast in the hotel is not delicious, I didn't buy breakfast. On the day we checked in, we were given a room on the 37th floor. When we took a shower, we found that the water temperature was unstable and the hot water was slow to come up. Halfway through the shower, the top sprayer started dripping cold water for some unknown reason, and the hole in the middle was turned off. The water gradually disappeared after a while. But the scary thing is that at 4-5 o'clock in the middle of the night, a sudden rush of water woke us up from our dreams! I was a light sleeper and almost jumped out of bed. I didn‚Äôt know why there was such a loud noise. I thought someone had entered the room. Then I went to the bathroom to check and found that a lot of water was leaking at once. I wanted to lie down and it leaked again several times. Back.
Because we were in a hurry, we didn't tell the hotel after dawn that day. We wanted to observe it when we came back in the evening, but it did leak again in the middle of washing, so I recorded a video and asked the person in charge to come to the door. At this time, it was already past 10 pm and almost 11 pm. The hotel wanted the maintenance staff to come to check and repair, but we were exhausted after a day's trip. Although we have emphasized that it is already late, your current maintenance cannot guarantee our sleep. They kept trying to come in for repairs. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because we are bullying our foreign guests, or because we are two girls. For my own rest and reasonable interests, and since I can‚Äôt ensure that there will be no more ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù for us in the middle of the night, I asked the person in charge and We talked, and in the end the manager on duty didn't see anyone, so he made a phone call and said he would change rooms for us. Around 11 o'clock, we packed up all the luggage in the room and moved to another room.
In the end, because we had a busy schedule, we didn't discuss the impact on us with the hotel, and the hotel didn't take the initiative to say that even if they gave us two cosmetic bags, they would deal with us. Sorry, it's not that easy to deal with.
In addition, in fact, because the hotel is old, it can be seen that there are many hardware problems after the renovation. Because of the unreasonably designed door, I even pinched my hand when I closed the door. The software configuration is also very poor, and unknown blood-sucking insects were discovered at night. If the price is the same, I suggest everyone not to stay here. Post the video and see for yourself.

1. It was a mess from check-in. Arrived at 3:00 in the afternoon, the front desk actually said that the room was not vacated and was being cleaned, and asked to wait for 1 hour [in a daze]. Saw another customer who had obviously been waiting for a long time, asking if he was okay. I just waited in the lobby like this, but no one answered. After waiting for half an hour, I couldn't bear to ask. The front desk took a long time to find a room. If I didn't ask, I just waited like this? !
2. The layout of the hotel is very strange. First, the elevator goes up to the 63rd floor to the front lobby, and then the elevator on the other side goes down to other floors to the guest room. If you want to go downstairs from the guest room, you must first go up to the 63rd floor. Special toss.
3. The toothbrush provided by the hotel is exactly the same as that of Home Inn 7 Days. The inside of the iron has turned yellow. In the room, except for the toilet, all kinds of lights, and the TV are all controlled by electricity to look high-end, the decoration is only at the level of the whole season. The exterior glass is dirty, as if it hasn't been wiped for a long time.
4. Bath balls and bath bags are not provided, and there are bathtubs without these.
5. After changing clothes in the swimming changing room, you need to walk through a corridor to reach the swimming pool. This design is also very strange. And there was no one to guide and indicate, so that I went in to change clothes and came out, I was in a daze, I didn't know where to get what, and I didn't know where to go.
6. The street is already noisy, and the sound insulation effect is extremely poor. The children shouting in the corridor can be heard clearly in the house, as if you are at home.

After talking about a good place,
Service: The girls and boys at the front desk are well-trained, maintaining a professional smile and speaking speed.
Room view: Overlooking Chang'an Avenue and the entire Beijing city on the west side, it is awesome if the weather is good. Many residents will take pictures of the sunset in the lobby.
There is a 24-hour gym, and the swimming pool is open during the day. The water quality of the swimming pool is very good and clean, without any smell of disinfectant. The wifi is top-notch and not intermittent.

Yueke Time complements Park Hyatt's regret that there is no Regency Club. Although the drinks and snacks are not as rich as the Regency Club, the service is better. It is also very good to be able to actively capture the needs of guests at all times.

The breakfast has a la carte menu, and the quality is very high. The black truffle egg rolls are eye-catching. It is indeed a product of "Beijing Liang"

The water temperature of the swimming pool is OK, and there are two warm water pools. The locker room is self-service, which I like very much. Needless to say, the view of the swimming pool.

In short, Park Hyatt will come to live again

msg:I've stayed in hotels so many times on business trips, and this is the first time I've given a negative review. I can't bear it. .
1. When checking in, I found used tissues and cotton swabs under the sink;
2. The design of the concierge depar**ent is very unreasonable. It is located in a very dark corridor on the first floor of the building;
3. One month after checking out, the deposit was not refunded. It was not until I checked the bill and called the hotel that the hotel discovered and processed the deposit refund.

Although I didn't enjoy it in detail due to the rush of time, I still look forward to experiencing it again next time. During the stay, the child suddenly fell ill, which disrupted the itinerary plan. The hotel staff also actively provided assistance, and we are also grateful.

The breakfast variety is not too much, and it is western style. The service is good and the price is not low.

This time, a special arrangement was made for Park Hyatt in Beijing.
Not disappointed at all! Very satisfied!
After getting out of the elevator, I was amazed by the beautiful scenery of Tianyang Pass in the lobby
The overall feeling is very similar to what Hangzhou gave me, and I like it very much!

Serve:
The housekeeper Bella confirmed the needs in advance so that we could check in early
After returning to the hotel in the evening, the luggage has been put in the room
The room is beautiful and comfortable
Bella responded to other needs in a timely manner

look forward to meeting next time

If you read this review, are you still hesitating whether to book Park Hyatt?
Go ahead, you won't be disappointed.

The bathtub is large and separate from the toilet area. The breakfast tastes good, the waiters try their best to turn over the table, and the queue is very fast. Generally speaking, it is the ceiling of high-rise hotels in Beijing.
Disadvantages: The sanitation is not up to standard, there are a few hairs on the bed as soon as you enter the room, and there is a lot of dust. The hotel does not have parking discounts or free parking tickets in the ba*****t, and the parking fee is still very expensive. The outer curtain wall is still dirty and affects the viewing experience.
Cost-effective business hotel, in line with expectations.

The scenery is superb, the sanitation and cleaning are meticulous, the details of the night bed and the accessories are well done, and the service attitude of each post is very enthusiastic. These are old traditions. Special thanks to the housekeeper Bella, who contacted us in advance to inquire about needs, and also made inquiries and return visits during the stay and after departure.
Let me talk about the things that can be improved in this stay:
After the redecoration, the style is more like home. It may be a board problem. Jinting has changed the menu, and the serving speed is still a bit slow, but the attitude is very good. The breakfast may be because there are too many people, the eggs are cold, and the waffles are a bit hard, but the attitude of the restaurant staff is very good, and they didn't change anything. There are not many places in the swimming pool, so you can prepare some simple stools. If there is no place to put water, mobile phone and towels, the staff can guide the children a little bit, or if there are too many people, it is easy to bump into each other. In addition, the settlement and deposit refund can be faster, but I have not received it yet.

Accor's high-end line may require more from me. Overall, the experience is still ok. Travel and check-in are recommended.

However, the front desk made people feel sorry for the price. They did not inform you about the breakfast location and time, or even provide you with toothbrushes, etc. The check-in experience was very poor. Your name was not displayed on the TV as a welcome page, and there was no welcome fruit for New Year's Eve. , the gym towels were missing for a long time, and they were full of water, and no one cleaned them. The service manual in the room is still very old and has not been replaced. The small room with a price of 3700 is not half as big as the one in Rosewood. In short, the standard of Park Hyatt is really poor, just this once.

I have basically stayed in luxury hotels in Beijing. The hotel with the best view and the most homely feeling is Beijing Park Hyatt. Joy.
It may be due to the high occupancy rate. The room facilities are a bit worn out. Maybe it's time for renovation. The light-colored rooms need to pay more attention to maintenance and hygiene. The butler Mamie helped arrange high-rise rooms in advance, and the service was professional and responsive.
Park Hyatt's breakfast is also one of the best in Beijing hotels. The a la carte dishes are moderate in size and taste good. The eggs Benedict are a bit average, and the hollandaise sauce tastes weak.
Looking forward to coming back as a guest next time

Third, there is a problem with the adjus**ent of the hot water washing operation, and the adjus**ent of the temperature is too slow. The overhead shower was leaking. Fourth, the elevator from the 1st floor to the 63rd floor is also very slow and crowded. Fifth, the doorman is unprofessional.

msg:Although I have stayed at Park Hyatt Beijing many times, every time I have different surprises. Before this check-in, the housekeeper Karina called very considerately, determined the itinerary in advance, asked about the needs, and introduced the hotel's various supporting facilities and services. After check-in, she will follow up and care about the daily needs of the guests. The missing friends really make the guests feel at home. The scenery of the hotel is even more incomparable. Looking at the endless traffic queues on Chang'an Avenue from morning to night, I can truly feel the charm and vitality of the imperial capital. Hope to have the opportunity to stay again next time.

Park Hyatt only arranged to stay for one night in order to let the children experience the night scene of Beijing. The experience was so good that I really regret not booking a few more nights! The night view is beautiful, the facilities are very new, the space is not too big, but the design of the whole studio will not be particularly crowded. The service is very enthusiastic. Anything I want is delivered to the room immediately. During the nap, I called during the nap. Because my sleep was disturbed, I also sent fruit. The cake expressed my apology, and I was warmed by the considerate service. Next time you come to Beijing Park Hyatt is the first choice.

To talk about a few details, a housekeeper called to ask about needs and preferences before check-in. When I checked in, I saw that the children living with me didn't ask if they were over the age limit. They were very friendly and generous. Check-in at the front desk is fast, no need to wait too much. Afternoon tea, happy hour, and the ladies at breakfast are all very nice. Especially for breakfast, the lady at the front desk will press the elevator for the guests and block the elevator door when they leave. Tap on the blackboard below to draw the key points! During the meal, I found a guest wearing white slippers in the room to eat in the breakfast room. The beauty who led the seat did not say no, but took out a pair of hole shoes and put them on for the guest, which not only maintained the rules of the hotel but also saved the face of the guest ! All in all, more than expected!

The hotel has convenient transportation. The downstairs is the Guomao Station of Metro Line 1. You can go to various museums and Tiananmen Square by subway. During the holidays in Beijing, the best transportation method is really the subway, so you won't waste time on the road. Next to it is the China World Mall, which is super convenient for shopping
I will consider staying here next time I come to Beijing

After comparing reviews on Ctrip for more than an hour, I finally chose the Park Hyatt Suite at the Park Hyatt Hotel. The hotel's personal butler, Pei Wenlu, is very caring. She called two days before check-in and asked how many people are staying, how old are the children, what are the requirements for staying, what are the needs for catering, etc., making people feel very warm and considerate. On the day of check-in, the personal butler Pei Wenlu personally greeted us at the elevator entrance and gave us a big surprise. He upgraded the originally booked Park Hyatt suite to an executive suite, and after personally leading us to the room, he also reviewed the room facilities and usage one by one. Introduce, considerately laid bedding on the sofa in the room in advance according to our requirements, and prepared exquisite red wine and fruits for us (all free). The hotel has a high-end a**osphere as a whole, a wide field of vision, and a panoramic view of Beijing city. On the flight back, my daughter was full of praise, and asked to follow the standard of the Park Hyatt Hotel when traveling and booking hotels in the future. Well, work hard, hahaha!

Park Hyatt customer service called and said that the doors of all their rooms faced the corridor. At that time, on the phone I just couldn't understand it. I didn't know how to imagine that the doors of all the rooms faced a long corridor. I said that when I arrived, I would check the room and go to the hotel. I waited until 3:30 to get the room card and went to the room. As soon as the room door opened, I saw a long corridor, and there was a ** when entering the toilet. I went to the front desk and asked to change rooms, and they changed me to a lower room type. I heard that extra beds are provided for free. When they gave me the first exclusive CBD room, they said that children can get extra beds for free. I tolerated it and went to the second CBD room. It basically met the requirements, but all the luggage was required. After it was done, I went to the toilet and lowered my head. I found something brown on the front edge of the toilet. I thought it was due to the equipment being used for a long time, but I couldn't help but take a paper towel and wipe it off, and it was able to be wiped off! Think about it, what else can there be besides üí© to get this brown stuff stuck to the toilet! ! I went to book a room while wearing big pants. The view is nice, but the service is really not good, there is no hygiene at all, and it is not worthy of a five-star hotel! The experience is really bad! In addition, there are very very few breakfast options!

msg:The first time I stayed at Park Hyatt Beijing, I booked the exclusive CBD view room on Ctrip. At night and early in the morning, you can see the China Zun and the "big underpants". It happens that the weather in Beijing is good these days, and the night view is very beautiful. Check-in hotel service at 2:30 It is still very good. The front desk of the hotel is on the 63rd floor. The services of the service staff on the first floor are very good. The only downside is that the hot water in the shower is a bit slower. The noise of the air conditioner is a bit loud. The electric curtains are noisy. It‚Äôs a good experience. If you want to see the scenery of the CBD, Park Hyatt is highly recommended. In addition, I would like to thank Ms. BELLA from the Guest Experience Depar**ent.

The location and view of the hotel are good, the facilities are a bit old, but the package price is very reasonable, and the restaurant also has a great view, so the price is relatively high. The interior of the room is quite satisfactory, and the quality of the equipment is a bit inferior. It is much worse than the Marriott series. The slippers are rotten as soon as they are worn... In addition, the waiting time for check-in is too long, and my room card was not given until after 5 pm. Karina from the guest experience depar**ent is very enthusiastic, overall it is not bad, but there is room for improvement

I paid more than 200 yuan to upgrade to a CBD view room. The view is amazing! During the day and night, you can have a panoramic view of the China World Trade Center. I called the front desk one day in advance to arrange the room arrangement, and arranged for Ms. Pei Wenlu from the Guest Experience Depar**ent to connect with her. The service is sincere. The room is decorated with birthday lights, balloons, and small cakes are also included in the package The enjoyment moment also includes afternoon tea snacks for two people and happy hour, catching up with Southeast Asian cuisine, Bak Kut Teh tastes good...

msg:With the mentality of trying to check in Park Hyatt in different cities, I did not expect Park Hyatt in Beijing to be like this. The experience can really be described as extremely poor. Even the basic guarantee of hot water cannot be satisfied. It is really unimaginable. How to maintain occupancy. I booked for three days and took warm and cold showers for two days. I negotiated with the hotel guest service depar**ent many times about the hot water problem in two days, but there was no solution. I couldn‚Äôt stand the hotel‚Äôs way of handling it, so I had to change it. The MO that I often choose when I come to Beijing. I really can't understand if it wasn't because of the proximity to China World Trade Center and the advantage of the location, would anyone really live there? The only good thing about the hotel is that the service from the concierge staff in the lobby on the first floor is really good, and the rest are really hard to describe. I hope everyone will not step on mine.

msg:I like Park Hyatt, because the location has always been good view and high floor. The butler service is very considerate. Wen Lu, a kind-hearted girl, is our butler of Park Hyatt this time. She called me one day in advance to understand my needs. Because traveling with children, in the post-epidemic era, all tourist attractions need to be reserved one day in advance , Wen Lu sorted out all the attractions I needed and sent me the link. I arrived at Park Hyatt on the 23rd. She just met me in the lobby on the 66th floor, took me to the room, and explained the facilities in the room for me. Thank you very much. Park Hyatt has such good staff. I will come back again next time I come to Beijing Live in Park Hyatt. Room service is also good, basically can meet your needs. There are small windows on the upper floors that can be opened a little so that the room doesn't get too hot. Disadvantages: The water provided in the guest room is a small capacity of 345, so the demand is high. It is embarrassing to always ask the aunt to deliver water, and I hope to change it to a large capacity of 550.

Lounge service: I haven't eaten dessert and dinner, but I drank tea and cocktails, which was very good and not perfunctory.
Room type: The hotel was designed in 2019, and it feels like the designer is exploring something new. The big bed in such a big room is not a king size. The shower is open and a bit cold, but with such a strange layout, with a door closed, it is actually very quiet, and you can sleep like a dream.

When I entered the main entrance of the building, a concierge would come and ask us if we were going to check in. He was very enthusiastic to help us with our luggage, and we could check it into the room. Also pretty fast. The lady at the front desk is very gentle, including the staff in the room service depar**ent and others have a good service attitude, but it takes a long time to deliver the items to the room. It takes about half an hour to deliver. This may be a common problem in five-star hotels.
Environment: Needless to say the advantages of the hotel's location, the lobby view is very open, and the photos are very good. It is very touching to see the busy traffic downstairs at night.
Facilities: I didn't feel amazing when I opened the door. It may be because the room is too old. The electric curtains are a bit tasteless and need to be pressed all the time, and the noise is huge. I hope it can be improved.
Hygiene: The sanitation of most of the facilities in the room is still very clean, but the carpet looks like it has been stepped on by many people and has not been cleaned all year round, and it looks dirty.
I want to praise the hotel's swimming pool. I didn't bring any equipment this time, so I went in and took a look. Once inside, it was very warm and the water temperature was just right. There are two places where you can soak in hot springs. It should be nice to take pictures. Unfortunately, I didn't swim this time. Then try again next time.

msg:For fifteen or six years, Ctrip has booked so many five-star hotels at home and abroad. The Park Hyatt Beijing has ruined my good impression of Beijing and the kindness of the Beijing people. I don‚Äôt even want to go to Beijing now. Objectively speaking, the hotel has a good view, but the facilities are very old and the front desk service is poor. When I checked in, the girl at the front desk was playing with her mobile phone with her face behind her back. I called a few times before turning around to check in. The voice was so quiet that I couldn't hear clearly every word I asked. I got the room card several times and didn't know how to take the elevator from the first floor to the 63rd floor. I didn't see a waiter to ask from the elevator entrance to the room. Finally, I turned to Ctrip‚Äôs review to read the hotel‚Äôs instructions. I didn‚Äôt even know where to eat breakfast, work out, or go to the room.
The second time I put the invoice at the front desk, I politely said: "Hello, so-and-so will come to pick it up later and I can forward it to you then." Before I could finish what I was saying, a male front desk man interrupted me rudely and asked. : "Do you have anything to do with me?" I was completely speechless. A second ago, I greeted the foreigner respectfully and with a smile. I waited in line silently for nearly 20 minutes. Then he responded to me with this tone and attitude. I replied, "I'm staying in the hotel." Then he helped me collect it. I would like to ask you to hand over the invoice if I don‚Äôt stay in the hotel and have nothing to do. Also, are your foreign-loving attitude and scornful expression for Chinese people really suitable to represent the hotel image at the front desk?

It can also be said that this stay at Park Hyatt is aimed at Ms. Sun Xiaoyi. Every time I come to Park Hyatt, I am very kind and feel like coming home! Having stayed in so many hotels in Beijing, Ms. Sun Xiaoyi's service that treats guests like family is more precious than a good-looking view. The experience of staying this time is very good. If I still need to stay in a hotel next time, I will choose Park Hyatt first.

There was no sign of charges near the refrigerator or on the drinks. In the end, I was deducted 93 yuan from the deposit when I returned the deposit. 2. The air conditioner has not been cooling since I checked into the hotel. Finally, I gave feedback that there is a price list in the refrigerator.

Park Hyatt's room was quiet, with three doors closed. Completely eliminate the noise of the corridor. Some guests with children, but the children are considered quiet.
The service of Beijing Liang Restaurant is very good, and the staff are very enthusiastic to visit. The executive lounge is very rich, a whole floor, enough space distance.
That is, photography enthusiasts do not recommend taking pictures in the lobby. Some people will come and say that they can't take a DSLR, but can only take a mobile phone.

msg:At the turn of autumn and winter, come to Park Hyatt for your birthday and relax (‚Åé‚ÅçÃ¥Ãõ·¥ó‚ÅçÃ¥Ãõ‚Åé)

It has been in the favorites for a long time and there is no suitable opportunity to arrange it. This time it can be said that the expectations are very high. If the full score is 5, the overall score is 4.5, the service is really considerate! Briefly list three service details:
1. Before going to the hotel, I called to inquire about some check-in details. The receptionist was Bella, a very serious and responsible lady, who answered all my questions patiently throughout the whole process, and helped me arrange a very beautiful birthday room. I ordered delicious little cakes and green grapes, and the big green grapes completely hit my heart! The handwritten letters from each team in the ps hotel are very cute~the mood is super beautiful o(^‚ñΩ^)o
2. When I went to the swimming pool, I found that I only brought a swimsuit and forgot to bring a swimming cap and goggles, so I asked the staff and said that there are swimming caps for 200 each. It's too expensive, so I just said don't buy it and swim next time when I have a chance. The staff said it's okay, if you don't mind, you can help us to see if there are spare swimming caps that can be borrowed. Later, I really found two sets for us, full of swimming caps and swimming goggles, super moved~
3. During the breakfast, there was a tricky temporary event in the middle, which made the breakfast time very tight. I was worried that I would have to leave before I finished eating, so I asked the staff at the breakfast entrance in advance if they could come back later. once. The lady was very nice, she told me that it was totally fine, and she could even pack some for me to take back to my room if needed. 555 is really warm!

Finally, explain that 0.5 points are all deducted from the facilities. Because the hotel is old, some facilities are relatively old. For example, the hair dryer is still a very old style, and the hot air is very hot and easily damages the scales. The toilet has no heating function, so it's cool to sit on it! The room has obvious refurbishment marks, and the color of the skirting is different. But these are still acceptable, the rest of the hardware is still carried, and the overall style is relatively calm.

So except for some hardware problems, others are perfect, and I spent a very pleasant weekend in Park Hyatt~

The front desk is on the 63rd floor. The receptionist has a good attitude and professional knowledge. Check-in is very fast. There is a staff member named Sun Xiaoyi. I must give a like!

Park Hyatt Hotel truly deserves its name~ The store lives up to its name. The biggest feeling of staying in the hotel is the cordiality and the meticulous service. It can be said that the service is super satisfactory! The room has a wide view, and the iconic buildings of the CBD have a panoramic view, and the night view is even more beautiful! Park Hyatt for two people can enjoy the exquisite meals and authentic taste. The breakfast is served at Beijing Liangliang on the 66th floor. The delicious breakfast combines Chinese and Western. I feel that it is the best and most exquisite breakfast in the five-star hotels I have stayed in. The opportunity must be second brush to check in!

msg:There is nowhere to go during the Mid-Autumn Festival, continue to take the family to check in at the Beijing hotel [spit]
This time, I came to the Park Hyatt under Hyatt, which is also the Guomao area. I really frequent Guomao this year [laughing]
I used to know Park Hyatt because of the Beijing Liang Bar. Many years ago, I went to see the night view and drink with my college girlfriends. Later, I went to Hangzhou on a business trip to stay at Park Hyatt, and suddenly I have a better understanding of this hotel. This time I just experienced it. Beijing Park Hyatt [Victory]
‚≠êÔ∏èHotel location‚≠êÔ∏è
Opposite to Guomao, the upper floor of Yintai on the south side of Chang'an Street is easy to find. After arriving, you can directly go up to the hotel lobby on the 63rd floor to check in (the hotel on the first floor will help you with luggage, which is very convenient [laughing])
‚≠êÔ∏è Room introduction ‚≠êÔ∏è
The hotel basically has deluxe rooms, Chang'an Street view rooms, CBD view rooms, suites, etc. I personally suggest that the first three are enough. The suites are mainly because the space is large enough. Local tyrants, please feel free to [Âë≤ya] because the last time I stayed at the China World Trade Center Hotel, I chose to see it. The cctv room, this time Park Hyatt chose the room with the view of Chang'an Street. The room space is five-star basic standard, and the layout is quite satisfactory, but I really like the shower room and washbasin, which is the layout I like.
‚≠êÔ∏èHotel Services‚≠êÔ∏è
Before I came here, I read the reviews on Ctrip. Many people said that the service was not good, but after I came, I found that the reviews on the Internet were too harsh. I think I have stayed in many five-star hotels chained by brands. At least by my standards, The service of Park Hyatt Hotel is very good. From the first floor, there will be staff to inquire and guide. When checking in on the 63rd floor, the staff at the front desk is very gentle. During check-in, they speak softly. I asked if I had stayed before. I thought it was because I was not a member of Hyatt Regency, so I wanted to market me as a member. Later, I found out that I was superficial. In fact, it was for the follow-up colleagues to serve us better üòÑ Because I was responsible for our room later. Karina, a staff member of the Guest Experience Depar**ent, introduced the hotel layout to me and my family in detail when receiving me. She also carefully informed me of the elevator locations that I need to take to go to different places, and accompanied and guided me to the room all the time. Let me get familiar with the hotel, and the intimacy of the hotel has increased [strong]
The hotel service is not only check-in, but also during the subsequent check-in period, and even check-out and check-out, it has always been very comfortable, especially the guest experience staff Helly, after we finished the check-out today, he also called specifically to ask about the check-in experience , it can be seen that the entire hotel staff are treating every guest very sincerely. I hope that the guest can have a beautiful and comfortable stay experience in Park Hyatt. I will go to the service and I will turn to the fan, and I will check in in the futureü§≠
‚≠êÔ∏èAuxiliary Facilities‚≠êÔ∏è
The hotel package purchased directly from Ctrip this time includes Beijing Liang breakfast, Yue Hall enjoy time, and happy hour. You can basically eat and drink all these things. There is a feeling of all-inclusive price [Naughty] I have attached some Enjoy the moments and happy hour snacks, drinks photos for your reference.
The hotel gym is also one of the facilities that I focus on. When looking at a hotel hardware, I have to look at the hotel's gym, swimming pool, and locker room. The details of these facilities can well reflect the hotel's standard [bad laugh] Park Hyatt The gym has an excellent viewing position. The treadmill faces the CBD. While running and listening to songs, you can watch the night view of the opposite CBD. The a**osphere is full, and the swimming pool is not bad. The experience is slightly poor, and it is recommended to come on a regular basis.

Finally, I would like to make a comprehensive comment. Regarding the hotels in the China World Trade Center, the two old people I have stayed in recently said that the Park Hyatt is more cost-effective than Shangri-La's China World Trade Center Hotel, the room price is better, the hardware facilities are comparable, and the software services are more careful than the China World Trade Center (of course, the China World Trade Center) The big hotel is also very good, but the Park Hyatt is more extreme), looking at the last two breakfasts, the taste of Beijing Liang‚Äôs food is more suitable for me. I have to come again next time. It turns out that staying in a hotel can really be addictive.

msg:1. This angle of view is very good. The 40th floor is moderate. It is really good to see the busy traffic in Beijing and feel the prosperity of the motherland. 2. The personal butler, Claire, understood my needs in advance, carefully arranged the room, warm and loving cards, presented red wine and cakes, presented my favorite bath products, and warmly greeted after check-in and check-out. The quality and service of Park Hyatt are shown by such a "golden key", which is intimate and warm, reflecting the professionalism of the Park Hyatt team. It is definitely not something that some hotels can have when they find a few Internet celebrities to wear less clothes for posing and promotion. On the contrary, it seems vulgar. 3. The richness of breakfast is not high, but every food is exquisite and high-quality, especially in the juice area. The chef keeps squeezing fresh juice, and the waiter in the restaurant even added a bowl of tofu brain for me. Happy hour is also a surprise, drinks and coffee taste online, and small snacks are also very classic. It is recommended that the chef replace the spring roll skin with the green onion skin as the skin of the beef roll. The skin is too thick and the weight is too large to be eaten and wasted. Improving the taste can also reduce the cost of hotel catering. The arrangement of green plants on the 66th floor and the artworks of the mountains and flowing water on the 63rd floor meet Zhiyin, which is full of relaxation and joy. Some hotels are evil and make people feel uncomfortable. 4. The mattress is very comfortable. I opened it to see what brand of mattress it was, and found the anti-collision sticker on the bed, so it makes sense that the details determine the quality. 5. It is recommended for business trips or tourism from other places to Beijing!

msg:I was on vacation in Xiaoqu District a few days before November 11. I was hurt by the high price of the homestay and the poor environment and configuration. After two days of hard work and overtime, I decided to stay at a hotel in the city for one night on the last day of vacation, and finally chose Park Hyatt. I was going to place an order for a single room, but found that there is a package, with double breakfast and happy hour, which is cheaper than a single room, so I decided to place the order. The day before check-in, Sun Xiaoyi, the housekeeper of the hotel, made a phone call and asked if he liked the scenery of East or West Chang'an Street, and then added WeChat to communicate before and after check-in, giving people a warm and caring feeling. Checked in at 3:00 pm, Sun Xiaoyi took us to the room, saw the children, and brought a piece of cheesecake, which was delicious. After a short break in the room, we went to the 62nd floor to enjoy the happy hour. There were some snacks, cakes, drinks and tea, and some hot food at dinner time. The day we went was Southeast Asia themed, with bak kut teh, curry puffs, fresh prawn noodles, etc. , is that the speed of serving is a bit slow. The room included happy hour for two, our child was 9 years old, paid 188 and could go from afternoon to evening. We stayed from four o'clock to seven o'clock, and enjoyed afternoon tea and a light meal in the evening. Overall, the environment and service were good, but the type and taste of the food were almost the same, not like the level of a hotel of this grade, at least better than The food in Shangri-La's executive lounge is much worse. I hope to improve the quality and not waste such a good environment. After dinner, I went to the hotel swimming pool. The depth of one meter is very friendly to children. The temperature of the large pool in the middle is low, and there is a hot pool on each side. After swimming for a while, return to the hotel to taste the cakes and fruits, and take a bubble bath to end this beautiful day. If we don't have children, we will go to Beijing Liang Bar on the 65th floor. It is said that the night view is particularly beautiful and you can see the China Zun with big pants. The next day, the breakfast was bright on the 66th floor in Beijing. The variety was much richer than the afternoon dishes. It is recommended to go early and sit on the east side with a better view. After breakfast, I went back to my room, took a bath, watched TV for a while, and checked out at noon, ready to go to Tiananmen Square to see the National Day flower basket. Sun Xiaoyi helped us check out, took us to the elevator, and gave us a set of toiletries. Overall, I spent a wonderful holiday. Thank you Sun Xiaoyi for the reception. I will choose Park Hyatt next time I have the opportunity.

Breakfast: Beijing Liang Restaurant on the 66th floor has a wide variety of varieties and invincible views. The weather is good, and you can see the West Mountain and Chang'an Avenue. Landmark buildings such as China World Trade Center and CCTV are all at your feet.
Service: Special thanks to the housekeeper Sun Xiaoyi. Before check-in, we will add WeChat to notify the check-in time in advance, and also help to extend the check-out time in advance. She also gave a lady's toiletry and cosmetic bag when leaving the store. intimate. I also like Kang Lili, the housekeeper, who prepared water and shopping bags in advance before checking out, which was thoughtful. For such a service experience, it is also worth coming back!
Favorite Park Hyatt's pool, suitable for children and swimming rookies.
Worth a visit!

The personal housekeeper, Claire, added WeChat in advance. During the stay, she responded to all requests in a timely manner, and quickly resolved my questions. Thank you! Room toiletries are from a personal favorite Fragrance Lab brand. The room service was great, and even came to the room to help me make coffee and deliver coffee pods late that day.
The only bad experience is the hotel's breakfast. In the five-star hotels I've stayed in, the variety and quality are slightly lacking. üâëÔ∏è There is less choice and the taste is average. Half of the breakfast fruits are sour (pineapple, red grapefruit) is not good Eat, the soy milk for two days has been cold~ Before leaving the store, the room butler asked for a request, and he prepared several bottles of mineral water and masks for us very thoughtfully.

Special praise to Miss Sun Xiaoyi for being enthusiastic, patient and attentive from the beginning of check-in. The whole check-in experience is perfect. Welcome fruit plates and candy desserts that children like are prepared in the room.
The swimming pool is clean, bright and hygienic, even if there are cleaning staff to clean up water stains to prevent slipping
You can count on Park Hyatt perfection at all times

The room was clean and of the right size, not too big for one person or too small for two. The facilities are perfect, but the self-control of the room is relatively old, and it needs to be explored. The windows in the room are not well sealed, you can feel the whirring when the wind is strong.
Be sure to try the hotel's breakfast, on the 66th floor of Beijing, the view is invincible, better than the room. I like oa**eal cups for breakfast, and I also recommend shrimp wonton soup~
The CBD room booked is very suitable for daze, watching the busy traffic downstairs. . .

The Park Hyatt Hotel has complete facilities, but it is really old-fashioned if you look closely. If you like to live in a hotel with a stronger sense of modernity, this hotel is really unattractive. But the professionalism of each employee's service is indeed remarkable.
Check-in is on the 63rd floor, and the moment the elevator door opens, it will definitely bring a strong visual impact to the first-time visitors to this hotel. A**ospheric and graceful artworks and large-scale floor-to-ceiling glass curtain walls perfectly convey the scenery of Beijing to you.

The staff at the front desk were very enthusiastic. When I learned that I was just in time for the wedding anniversary, I immediately asked the supervisor to help me upgrade a room with a better view. I was very satisfied. The supervisor also took the initiative to add my WeChat, and helped me bring fruit and exquisite chocolates and ducklings for the children to play with. The whole service is very online ‚úÖ, the hotel's breakfast is on the 66th floor, the view is very good, the category is not special Abundant but all you want to eat are good food with Beijing characteristics such as freshly squeezed juice and old yogurt, especially the service of a male waiter is very considerate. On the contrary, there was a long-haired waitress who was a little chubby and generally did not write her name. The pool has a cold and 2 hot pools, not many people enjoy it. The location of the hotel is very good, opposite to Guomao, and downstairs there are Crows heart and subway station. Overall I am very satisfied, the fly in the oin**ent is the shower üöø The nozzle can be upgraded again, then the experience will be better ‚ù§Ô∏è

Check into Room 4607 at Park Hyatt Beijing
Transportation: It is very convenient to take a taxi. It is not recommended to drive there. Parking needs to be parked below Yintai, 10 yuan per hour. It is mainly a lift parking space. It is not easy to park. The entrance and exit of the underground garage should be very careful. Take the elevator to the 1st floor, transfer to the elevator to the 63rd floor for check-in, and then transfer to the next elevator to the room after check-in.
The scenery is invincible, mainly the night view, and the scenery of the restaurants on the 63rd and 66th floors is even more beautiful like a fairyland. When I checked in, there was a small situation. The front desk staff legori was very professional and humane to help solve the problem, praise one!
Hardware facilities: room bonus items, double bathtub is super! The water discharge is very fast, the water pressure is also very good, the bath and bath are very comfortable, the mattress and quilt are also very comfortable, the softness is moderate, the pillow is a bit too soft, it is easy to increase the types of pillows. The supplies are really useful, I personally find it great! Disadvantages: hair dryer voltage is too low, hair is very slow
Food and beverage packages: How can you not check in for afternoon tea or dinner when staying at Park Hyatt Hotel, because I was afraid that I would not be able to eat afternoon tea and dinner in the afternoon, so I chose to have dinner at Beijing Liangliang.
The self-service breakfast service provided in the room is excellent, and the staff are very super five-star, but the breakfast is very general, there is almost nothing to eat, it is recommended to increase the variety of bread and fruit!
It's still a very worthy hotel, and the staff inside feel very kind and feel at home! In addition, in terms of service: the little brother who guided the parking outside the first floor of the hotel is very watery, and he is messing with time!

1. Due to the problems of the guests in the next room, the hotel staff made unreasonable demands on us. We just talked at a normal volume, and the neighbors next door complained about our voice several times. The hotel asked us to change rooms overnight without verifying it at all, and we were treated unreasonably.
2. The next day, the shoe covers used by the master were left in our cloakroom, and the ladder for repairing electrical appliances and the door on the roof of the cloakroom were open, which was very scary
3. Hotel service The security of the hotel cannot keep up with its price and brand. The service and facilities of Park Hyatt in Hangzhou, Shanghai and Suzhou are much better than those in Beijing.

msg:It is inconvenient to go out of Beijing during the epidemic, so take your baby to stay in a hotel for a few days to relax. The location is in Guomao, and it is very convenient to eat and drink. It must be said that I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad, but Park Hyatt's service can be said to be the NO.1 in the hotel I stayed in. A lot of details are well done! From Miss Becky, who handled the check-in, I have experienced meticulous service. She will add the guest's WeChat so that guests can contact her at any time if they have any questions during their stay, which is really convenient! And the lady's WeChat reply was very timely.
Room service: The service staff who deliver the things will always back to the door after delivery, and will not leave behind the guests. The service staff of the executive lounge is also very good, warm and does not make people feel uncomfortable.
There was a small problem with the linkage door of the room, so I came to repair it in time, and sent a bottle of red wine and fruit plate in time after the repair!

Does not provide any beverages, drinks and fruits. Toiletries are also locked, not small samples that you can take away. Mineral water is also mineral water in small bottles. If you want to drink water, you need it when you come and go. There is no door in the shower area, you will be blown to death by the wind, making you feel like you are taking a shower outside, and there is no privacy in the house, just watch each other take a shower. If you are in a hotel with this price, it is strongly recommended that you go to the New International Trade Hotel. You can eat and drink fruit drinks as you like, and you like to take away the toiletries. There are not many China World Trade Center Phase III, the scenery is more beautiful than here, the floors are higher, and drinks and drinks are also available in your refrigerator! If you want to get more and better gifts and drink as many drinks as you can, then your first choice is Bulgari Hotel! It's perfect... Unlimited drinks and drinks, as well as candy gifts, various fruits, desserts... When you leave, I will help you pack your drinks and give you souvenirs. It's really impeccable! The hotel is like Park Hyatt, I guess I really can't find it in Beijing! Stingy finger sucking, not pulling out a hair, that is the highest evaluation I give here! By the way, the parking fee here is also the most expensive of all hotels!

The housekeeper Coraline will always pay attention to our needs and give enthusiastic help.
There are two slight regrets. The Yintai parking lot used by the hotel has no discount for parking, and it is fully charged at 10 yuan per hour. In addition, because the hotel is not connected to multiple floors of the building, the elevator needs to be reversed between the lobby, guest rooms, executive lounge and restaurant, and there will be some extra travel, which is slightly complicated.

The Park Hyatt Hotel overlooks the skyscrapers of the CBD and has high-quality dining and bars. It has always been my favorite place.
Park Hyatt Hotel has many choices of hotel packages, long validity periods, and good price. It is also good to catch up with the road conditions during the holiday and long holidays. On weekdays, this is a well-known major congestion point in 9. However, the surrounding transportation and taxis are very convenient, and it is a paradise for consumption and shopping.
On the 4th, it was the opening day of the Winter Olympics. When I arrived at the hotel, I found that many guests also wanted to watch fireworksüéÜ. Despite the psychological preparation in advance, the process of cleaning up the room was indeed long. Fortunately, there is an executive lounge trea**ent, where the environment is elegant and quiet, but the afternoon tea and dinner are lackluster and have no bright spots.
Anna, the service staff at the front desk, gave a very good impression. There were some small episodes during the check-in process. In addition, the high occupancy rate of Park Hyatt during the Chinese New Year led to some unpleasant experiences. Anna was very enthusiastic and took the initiative, patiently explained and comforted, and sincerely helped us solve the problem. The problem, I got a very good check-in experience in general, and they are very good hotel practitionersüëçüëå. In order to express our apology, the red wine dessert was specially delivered. The food delivery staff served in a timely and enthusiastic manner, so that the unpleasantness was eliminated.

The breakfast is great, with good quality and good taste ‚òïÔ∏èü•ßüç∂ü•öüçùüå≠, and the receptionist at the door is active and thoughtful.

The way of civilized hospitality should not only be warm and courteous, but also provide convenience; it should not only improve the quality inside, but also build the image outside. Park Hyatt Beijing has done this perfectly [Praise R]
Be
üè®Park Hyatt - Park Hyatt, is the ultimate luxury boutique hotel under Hyatt. Park Hyatt/Andaz, Grand Hyatt, Hyatt and so on.
Be
üìçPark Hyatt is located in the core area of Beijing's CBD, the tallest building on Chang'an Avenue, opposite China World Trade Center. As the first Park Hyatt branded hotel in Greater China, Park Hyatt Beijing offers modern and luxurious facilities and meticulous service. There are many high-end shops and commercial office buildings around, adjacent to the International Trade Center, CCTV, and the Intime Shopping Center downstairs. It is less than three minutes to go out, and it is Metro Line 1. It is super convenient to go to Universal Studios, Tiananmen Forbidden City, and Wangfujing. It is also very convenient to call a car.
Be
üíÅ When you get off the car, there will be service staff to help with luggage. Guests can go directly to the 63rd floor to check in. The guest room needs to take another elevator to enter by card. Privacy and security are still very good. The pens are all sterilized, and the details are perfect.
The room also prepared masks for the guests, no-wash disinfection, and also prepared toiletries for the children, which really touched me. Moreover, the windows are bright and clean, and where you can see, there is no floating dust.
There will also be a private butler who will serve the guests attentively. I am very grateful to Pei Wenlu's service staff for responding to requests and caring about the needs of the guests. After leaving the store, they asked me if I arrived safely. In short, every service staff in Park Hyatt made me feel very moved and caring. Compared with many five-star hotels I stayed in before, the experience is better, and the details are more memorable. Meals are very particular about hygiene and rest assured.
By the way, there is also a conference phone in the room. It‚Äôs the first time we meet. It‚Äôs really suitable for family vacations and business trips.

msg:Reluctantly give five stars, mainly because the service is very good and very good, beyond the enthusiasm of 5 stars, but there are still some bugs in the hardware.
The hotel is located in the International Trade CBD Center, upstairs of Yintai Center. One of the hardware bugs is that the facade downstairs is very narrow, and there is only a temporary parking space. The lobby is on the 63rd floor, and the downstairs is also the entrance to the apar**ent and office building.

Because of our birthday check-in, we were upgraded to a room with a view of China Zun, and we also arranged a birthday room for us in advance. The room layout was very thoughtful and I am very satisfied. Some staff added WeChat in advance to confirm the arrival time and registered at the front desk. The staff also added WeChat, and if there are any questions and needs, there will be a special person responsible for coordination.

The room is on the 43rd floor. The room I booked includes double breakfast and afternoon tea ‚òïÔ∏è&happy hour. I enjoy it in the Yue hall on the 62nd floor. The environment of the Yue hall is very good, and there are very few people, but there are really few afternoon tea catering, happy The hour is impeccable. There are a la carte meals and self-service fruit and food, which are really delicious... The meals that night were Southeast Asian flavors. I have tried every one, and they have such a great taste and level. It was beyond my expectation, and the special notes are also delicious. In addition, the service attitude of the staff in Yue Hall is really worthy of praise. The executive lounges of other hotels do not have such good service. Breakfast was served at Beijing Liang Restaurant on the roof, and the food was too good to be said.

Thanks to Amy Yang from the Guest Experience Depar**ent for the meticulously decorated room and the birthday cake üéÇ, the cake is super delicious. I also thank Miss Fiona for coordinating many things for me and giving me a birthday gift. Ann, the young lady in Yueting Hall, can remember me and know my birthday, and specially prepared several cups of birthday specials for me. The service impresses me deeply, thank you.

The second hardware bug in the room is the bathroom. When I first checked in, the lights in the bathroom flickered and broke, although they were repaired immediately. There is also a bug in the bathroom that the glass is not closed, so remember to turn on the hot air conditioner in advance when taking a shower, otherwise it will be cold and runny. Because it is too cold, I went to the gym's locker room to take a shower the next morning.

In other respects, it seems to be quite satisfactory. The bathtub in the bathroom is very large, but we did not use it. The bathroom in the room is separated into three parts, and there is also a small luggage room in the room. The spare parts are lelabo, and the fragrance is really good. There is a free shoe shine service, and the attitude is very good. The hotel can order take-out, and the take-out can be placed in the security room downstairs.

I am really happy to eat "Crayfish ü¶û Birthday Cake" on my birthday~

Our room is on the 49th floor with a good view. The front desk is on the 63rd floor. Every time we go downstairs, we need to go to the 63rd floor and then take the elevator to the first floor. Breakfast is served in the famous western restaurant "Beijing Liang", on the 66th floor of the hotel, and it is also necessary to transfer to a special sightseeing elevator on the 63rd floor. The last picture is a photo of Guomao looking down from "Beijing Liang". The hotel has a special housekeeper who will come to the room to say hello, which is very considerate.

This one in Beijing is a few years old. The elevator speed is a bit slow, the facilities in the room are very good, and the toilet is automatic. But the curtains are a bug, the sound of the switch is particularly loud, but it does not affect the shading effect. The room is very soundproof and the bedding is comfortable. I haven't slept in the city for a long time and woke up naturally~ The night view is indeed a must, but the restaurant is a bit disappointing , probably because the higher the expectations, the greater the disappoin**ent. When I went to the legendary Beijing Liang restaurant, it was noisy and the restaurant had a strong smell. Later, I ordered the meal in the room~ The breakfast was also average~ It was still a little worse than the Rosewood~ But the room was equipped with Disinfecting paper towels and masks, this is very humane~

Environment: Maintaining the style of Park Hyatt, Check in is on the 63rd floor.

Service: The room service is very attentive, and the reception staff on the first floor are also very friendly
Summary: Maintaining the style and standard of Park Hyatt, it is a very comfortable stay experience!

msg:After buying a package from Ctrip, I came to experience the (former) tallest hotel in Beijing in time for Chris**as.

üöó Transportation: It is very conveniently connected to Guomao Subway Station. It costs 10 yuan an hour to park, and it hurts to stay for one night.

üßπHygiene: The hygiene is very good. The bathtub was disinfected in front of me, good reviews.

üçÉEnvironment: It‚Äôs very cold for some reason. Very, very cold. When I first entered the room, it felt like an ice cellar. The reason given by the housekeeping supervisor was that it had just been cleaned and the windows were opened to let some air in. After turning on the air conditioner for an hour, it was still cold, so I had to call the room service staff. I was told that "the air conditioner turned on at 27 degrees and 3 wind speeds actually blew cold wind, so the hour was completely in vain." Finally, the cleaning lady brought in an electric heater and things got better. I didn't turn on the electric heater at night because I was afraid of being dry, so I woke up from the cold... The air conditioner was turned on to 26 degrees, and the room temperature was actually 20-21 degrees. The quilt was not thick, and it was very cold at night because of the cold wave in Beijing.

üîîService: I would like to praise the reception staff and the staff at the 62nd floor Yueting. In particular, there was a male staff member on the 62nd floor who was particularly kind. The trea**ent in Yueting is pretty good, including snacks, coffee and tea in the afternoon, light hot meals and unlimited happy hour in the evening, as well as good Bordeaux red wine and Italian sparkling wine. The housekeeping lady is also very enthusiastic, but there is a problem...the doorbell does not ring. If you press the doorbell in Do Not Disturb mode and turn on the TV, you will not hear it. Then a staff member swiped the card twice to enter the room directly...First The first time was to send fruit, and the second time was to ask if there was any clothes to be washed... It was a bit embarrassing... What if I was doing something...?

Generally speaking, as a five-star hotel with a price of 1500+, it still does not meet expectations.
First, the lobby is too narrow. There are many non-hotel guests and dining guests crowded in the lobby to take pictures. The entire lobby is in a chaotic state, and it feels like no one is maintaining order...
Secondly, the temperature in the room was not very comfortable. The air conditioner was turned on very weakly, and it would wake me up from the cold at night. This was an experience I had never experienced in any five-star hotel.
Third, the room service lacks professionalism. It is really embarrassing to be broken into twice in a row.
Fourth, the environment of Beijing Liang Restaurant for breakfast is actually not very good. The dining area and the food collection area are very narrow and crowded, and the queues are serious during peak hours. The tables are very close to each other. It's really annoying when the room is full.

[Location] It is very convenient to get to the hotel by subway. You can enter Yintai Center through the passage from Exit C of China World Trade Center on Line 1, and it is more convenient to have 711 at the entrance. The driving and parking experience is not good. The underground parking management of Yintai Center is complicated. It is difficult to find a good location for temporary parking. The parking fee is about 200 per night.

[Facilities] The room has been carefully designed, with clothes, hats, luggage, toilets, bathing, toilets, and rest areas distinct. The facilities are complete, and the scenery is very good. When passing by the CBD, I feel that it is not characteristic compared to other first-tier cities. Looking at the panorama from a high place, I really feel the prosperity of the capital, and the bedding is more comfortable. The overall feeling is worthy of the five-star standard and room price.

[Service] The services from check-in, room service, and breakfast are all very good. The restaurant on the 66th floor has a well-deserved environment and has a rich variety of breakfasts. However, there are too many people to catch up with the peak of Chris**as Eve, and the experience will be discounted. It should be very good at ordinary times. On the 3rd floor of Intime, there is a recommendation of Japanese food, and b1 also has many dining options.

Room facilities:
Chang'an Street view room, the location is west, the disadvantage is that the floor I booked this time is not too high. The 39th floor is quite affected. It is blocked by Yintai on the left and SK Building in the middle. The room is large and the layout is very distributed. Okay, the square bathtub is too milky, the bed is so comfortable, I didn‚Äôt feel like I was staying in a hotel even after I woke up in the middle of the night~
breakfast:
Breakfast is on the 66th floor, with great views and delicious meals. There are many kinds of Chinese and Western dishes. Omelettes can be ordered and will be delivered to the table. Recommended black truffle egg rolls and wontons are delicious. There is shrimp meat~ Chef is so handsome and takes care of our meals~ A lady serving in red clothes is also very good, helping me explain the usage of the toaster, making coffee, collecting dishes, everything is fine, and the smile is very kind~
Cost performance:
To be honest, this price is really a bargain. It includes two breakfasts and Happy Hour. Happy Hour is rich enough to be eaten for dinner, very cost-effective~
Beijing Liang Bar has activities on Chris**as Eve. We paid the tickets, then sat down at the bar, and the guest bartender brother was too handsome~
Will go again if there is a chance, recommended~ [Naughty]

As far as the room itself is concerned, I personally feel that in addition to the wide view and superior location, the facilities and layout did not give me any sense of surprise.

In particular, Amy, the deputy manager of hotel experience, took the initiative to help arrange afternoon tea for the elderly and children, and asked them to order. The children really liked this beautiful lady.

My wife and I like running and fitness. Yuexiang Fitness Center on the 59th floor is the highest gymnasium in Beijing. The treadmill is very cool to run.
The only downside is that this time I encountered the year-end overhaul of the swimming pool, and failed to experience Tianchi.

The equipment in the house is so old, the plugs are broken, the walls are peeling off, and the bath water is hot and cold. Not to mention these things, not to mention paying the room rate in advance and the deposit is more than the room rate, how dare you charge 80 for a charging cable? Not to mention. During the afternoon break, the aunt came to ask about the experience of staying in the hotel. After five minutes, a young man brought me to tell me to turn down the bed. Are you really so idle? housekeeping woolen you guys? The check-out deposit was not refunded in time, and I talked back to me. Has the front desk been trained? Garbage Beijing Park Hyatt, don't insult this brand, change the name to Beijing Supreme Home Inn.

Beijing Park Hyatt is the first Park Hyatt in China
So when you go to Beijing on business, you must check in Beijing Park Hyatt
But speaking of it, this brand is also very recognizable
Either a resort hotel or a city skyline
Beijing Park Hyatt should belong to the latter
40 multi-layers + height, facing the big pants
The entire Chang'an Avenue is your background board
It's my dish~
¬∑
The number of rooms in Beijing Park Hyatt is not much overall
So the service is super nice
The hotel is located in an apar**ent building in the center of Yintai
The location is very convenient, right in the city center
No matter where you go, taking a taxi and subway is very convenient
Upon arrival, take the elevator directly to the check in lobby
It's also very okay in privacy
The overall design is more elegant
A little new Chinese style, a little light luxury
¬∑
Because the front desk sisters Estelle and Chole helped me upgrade the room
So the view of the room is superb
On the left hand side is the famous big pants
The opposite is Shili Chang'an Street (the hotel itself is on Jianguomen Street)
The night scene is better
¬∑
The space design in the room is very reasonable
Separate dry and wet, bedroom and office area are opposite
There is also a small sofa lounge area by the window
Some people may not be particularly demanding on the office area
But for a mobile office worker like me
Having a desk is really super life-saving
Thank you again, Miss Estelle and Chole at the front desk~
Toiletries use perfume laboratory
For personal reasons, I am not used to this brand
So I prepared my own toiletries in advance
¬∑
The breakfast room is also great
Semi-self-service
You can order Chinese breakfast or Western food
Say something fun
I ordered a sustainable porridge
I thought I could refill the bowl for free
As a result, the waiter said that the reason why it is called sustainable
Because the seafood inside is very sustainable
I was really amused early in the morningüòÇ
¬∑
Had dinner at their Chinese restaurant
Super refined, but better than the environment
When Hua Deng first appeared, the advantages of the skyline were unobstructed
Super warm and gentle, I really want to take a few photos and send it to my circle of friends
¬∑
In short, it was a perfect experience
Next time I go to Beijing on a business trip, I will visit again

Sleeping in the room during the day and hearing the cleaning and cursing next door, without thinking about the rest of the people in the room
The minibar is charged and you are not willing to refill the bottles of stuff for only a few dollars? ?
The breakfast room was a mess, and the lover got up to pick up the meal and came back, the table was cleaned up
It doesn't matter if the parking is not free. Compared with the JW Marriott Hotel who gave a 6-hour free parking coupon, the tall woman at the front desk has a arrogant attitude, and she justly said that she would not give it here. The expression is indifferent and there is no smile.
It is recommended that the front desk staff of the hotel be pulled out for training and training. Let's come out and see. Other hotels will beat you up
Not as good as Niccolo in Changsha and Shangri-La in Nanjing
Value for money is very low, not recommended

msg:An extremely disappointing Park Hyatt experience.

The facility design is unreasonable.
When the air conditioner is turned on to the lowest wind speed, the sound is still loud at night.
The green light of the bedside control board also greatly affects sleep.
The shower faucet is far away, and no one can touch the water at the same time when adjusting the water temperature, so back and forth several times to adjust the temperature to the right.
The bathroom is open, and the air-conditioning in the room makes the bathing experience very poor.


Sanitation is too far from the Park Hyatt standard. There are signs of mildew everywhere in the bathroom. Do you really doubt if you live in Park Hyatt?

I feel that I should be downgraded to Hyatt

The environment is good ~ privacy is good ~ invincible international trade view ~ Park Hyatt is undoubtedly one of the best choices for hotels in the city. The view of Jinting Restaurant on the 62nd floor is worth visiting a few more times, although the prices here are relatively high and the portions are relatively small. Estelle, the reservation depar**ent, has thoughtful and meticulous service and helped me set up the celebration props in the room for my daughter in advance. I basically didn't worry too much. The kids were playing high! There are few people in the swimming pool and a strong sense of design. It is a pity that the bear park downstairs is no longer open due to the epidemic, otherwise it can be a one-stop service for the children.

msg:This package is super cost-effective.
I have been to restaurants and bars a dozen times before, but I have never stayed. This time I got what I wanted.
The two big and two young ate three meals at the lounge and Beijing Liang, and soaked in the swimming pool. A pleasant weekend.
Everyone knows that the view of Park Hyatt Hotel is invincible in Beijing. I like the sense of design here, the decoration and furniture are simple and generous, the materials are good, and the feeling is very clean and refreshing. From time to time, I come to the art furnishings to make the mood very good.
In fact, the lounge and breakfast options are limited, but the belly is originally that big, enough to eat and drink. The key is a good environment, the sofa set on the 62nd floor, if you can come here often to entertain friends.
There is a slot, is it true that the waiters in high-end hotels have idol baggage, and I feel that all of them are slower, there is no such fierceness, there are people waiting outside, and no one is eager to clean up the mess. As long as there are more guests in the restaurant and swimming pool, it immediately becomes messy. Of course, some customers are not particular about it. It will be much better if you put the used towels in place.
Finally, I am embarrassed. I just left the coffee capsules and shower gel in the room. The main reason is that the office has the same coffee machine, and I prefer the fragrance of the shower gel.
Just now the hotel called to ask for a review, and wanted to give it a good review. In fact, not calling is also praised. Design and scenery are special.

I added money and said I would upgrade to a room with a CBD view as high as possible, but ended up getting the lowest room on the 37th floor? After entering the room, the carpet was really dirty and stained, which made me feel sick! ! A pile of dirt. Why was the air conditioner so loud when I was sleeping at night?

Because I was too lazy to get out of the door, I called me when I was even ready to order takeout, and then reserved a seat for me and asked me to come directly. The service was very good. The food is served quickly and there are many waiters, so you will not be left out. In the end, I forgot to order desserts, and I couldn't eat them anymore. The waiter took the initiative to say that he could return it for help, praise!

Note: Because the lobby is on the top floor of 63, you need to take the internal elevator to sit down to the lobby first, and then sit straight from the lobby to the first floor, which is a little inconvenient, but the advantage is that it is safer and more private. In addition, the window is indeed a bit dirty, but if you look at the big pants, you can see that Beijing will not last long after cleaning it.

msg:Yesterday I stayed in the deluxe double room and ordered the package on Ctrip. It also includes happy hour (afternoon tea + evening snacks and drinks). Generally speaking, the cp value is high. Afternoon tea, snack styles are less, but the taste can still provide hot food in the evening. Dim sum and red and white wine cocktails. The service staff emily is very conscientious and the service is very in place and attentive. He also prepared new cocktails for us. Because the front desk called to the front desk and no one answered the question, the front desk legerie Zhang Yuxin is very sorry for this, and also gave us a satisfactory answer and compensation. The problem is handled efficiently and the customer's requirements are met. Afternoon tea time on the second day, the waiter Chloe asked about our experience in Park Hyatt and said that there are many areas that need to be improved. As consumers, they hope that the hotel can get better and better. The five-star hotels I stayed in before did not seem to have such in-depth understanding. Guests staying in the hotel feel that Park Hyatt is the first to encounter it. This also shows that Hyatt Group still pays attention to the experience of guests in the modern society where the hotel industry pursues hardware facilities. In short, although it is not so perfect during the stay, these three service staff Make this stay experience a big plus!

msg:This time our two families are traveling together, two mothers with four children. The service staff of the hotel are very nice üëç very kind! I just met my girlfriend for her birthday and prepared balloons. I asked Coraline from the concierge to help us in the room while we were playing in the Forbidden City. I thought it was just to decorate the things I prepared, but I didn't expect the romantic lamp to make rose petals! I also gave a bottle of red wine, warm and touching. The point is, he knows that my friend likes Hello Kitty and drew a card for him himself. It‚Äôs so hard! ‚ù§Ô∏èThe full housekeeping service is in place to meet all our needs as much as possible, which is really touching. In addition, Chole on the 62nd floor helped us place an order with the kitchen in advance to let us spend a whole day outside. We can enjoy the hot food as soon as we arrive at the hotel! All the care and care is great just like family!

The breakfast is very rich, basically you can finish lunch, no need to eat! It's cost-effective to purchase this package for free extra beds.

Next time I go to Beijing, I will definitely choose Park Hyatt Hotel again! Looking forward to going again next time.

The service is very attentive. As soon as you arrive at the hotel, someone will help you take your luggage and send it directly to the room. The room arranged by Ms. Anna at the front desk has a very good view. You have a panoramic view of the China World Hotel.
The butler service is also very considerate, always asking if there is any dissatisfaction with comfort and discomfort. The next day I went to the gym to swim and the swimming pool environment was also very good! !
The buffet on the 66th floor is not to be selected. It overlooks the capital. The buffet is also delicious. Nothing bad!
The only shortcoming is that the things that turn on the lights are so complicated, I never know how to turn on the corresponding ones.
Will stay again next time~

The moment the door opened, it was a pleasant surprise. CAROLINE's meticulous service throughout the whole process, and the handwritten birthday cards are awesome. Happy hour OREO is gentle and considerate, afternoon tea background music is gentle and soothing. Compared to other HYATT, I would recommend this one to my friends first.

Although the floor is not as high as the opposite China World Hotel, it‚Äôs better than the scenery. The only drawback is that there is no parking lot of its own, and more than 200 parking fees are charged...

Estelle, our young lady, was very warm and thoughtful and provided us with quality service. The disadvantage of the hotel is that it does not have its own parking lot. Yintai‚Äôs parking lot costs 10 yuan per hour, which is quite expensive for one night. In addition, the bright glass in Beijing is a bit dirty, and it is a bit affected when taking pictures. Hope there will be improvements in the future.

msg:Guests staying in Beijing Liang dine at the top table, and the sunset falls to the west. Last time I only had meals without shelter, only on the 66th floor. Western food is large but I love mango desserts the most.
The guest room layout is reasonable, and the bathroom is designed with a small sink. It would be perfect to add a makeup stool to the washing area. There is plenty of coffee in the bar area. At 4:30 in the morning, the Chinese Zun in the CBD is the most beautiful.
On the 63rd floor of the lobby, you can view the Tiananmen Forbidden City Beijing Railway Station city wall from the west.

msg:The first Park Hyatt in Greater China, stands on the top of Chang'an Avenue. It opened in 2008 and completed the overall renovation and upgrade in 2019. The hotel's excellent architectural design combines high-grade artistic essence, large guest rooms, exquisite and delicate decoration and facilities, which perfectly define Park Hyatt's brand concept of "luxury by heart".
Take the high-speed elevator and enter the lobby on the 63rd floor. Oncoming is the hotel‚Äôs iconic artwork "Recalling Jiangnan" sculpture. The bronze sculpture inspired by "Shufengqing" has accompanied Beijing Park Hyatt Hotel for more than ten years. In a quiet corner of the cloud, it welcomes and greets every guest. After years of precipitation, it is still gentle and clear.
Thanks to Penny, the front office manager, and also praised Coraline from the guest experience depar**ent. He prepared a 07 view room for me, with a magnificent view of the capital from the window.
Just like the English name of Park Hyatt Hotel, it gives me a feeling of Park. It is quiet and plain but also living in the CBD filled with material desires, like a quiet place in the world. This is also the way to victory that Park Hyatt knows well.

Sure enough, there was a little surprise when I went in. There are also hand-written greeting cards and welcome fruits. The beauty Pei Wenlu is very enthusiastic, and she asks me if I need water from time to time. We couldn't cast the screen, and she immediately called someone to help us. I bought the set meal, as well as afternoon tea and evening snacks. Afternoon tea has all-you-can-eat snacks and drinks. In the evening, because we ordered dinner, we didn't go there, and it was probably very good. The breakfast is rich and exquisite. What impresses me is that the service is very enthusiastic.

msg:The hotel facilities are pretty good, but the front desk service is average. The worst thing is that you have to wait for a table for breakfast, and you have to wait outside the restaurant for more than half an hour. There are not so many breakfast places. Why is breakfast included? The breakfast in a five-star hotel is of poor quality and experience, and is not recommended. Unless you don't care about waiting for a seat or don't eat breakfast, you can consider it. Personally, I think you should choose another hotel in the same price range.
