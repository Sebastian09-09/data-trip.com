msg:I originally booked a parent-child room, but when I arrived at the hotel, I found that the entire floor's air conditioning was out of order, so the parent-child room could not be accommodated. Fortunately, after the waiter coordinated with many parties, we changed the suite. I would like to express my gratitude to the hotel staff for their enthusiasm.
Let’s talk about the room facilities. The facilities in the room are quite modern, the smart system, and the toiletries are pretty good, especially the toiletries are Hermès, which is a plus. The only drawback is that the smart toilet in the guest area bathroom has no battery. . . The equipment is relatively simple. . . The TV remote control doesn't work very well. . . Hope the hotel will make timely adjus**ents.
Compared with the hotel environment, the hotel dining is actually not as good as expected. Although there are thoughtful welcome fruits and evening snacks, breakfast is in the form of a set meal. We are traveling as a family. The set meal is not very selective for children and the portion is too large. It is not comfortable for two children to order one portion for two. The child ordered two set meals and couldn't finish them, which was a waste. .
Then I asked about the hotel's lunch and dinner, and was told that both required reservations in advance. And it’s expensive. For such a price, we can buy some Black Pearl and Michelin. The essence of eating lies in its taste. Perhaps being in such an environment will give the hotel extra points at a premium to all aspects, but after all, few people will eat a meal without knowing anything about the taste or service just for the sake of the environment.
To sum up, I will take my family to this hotel to spend a whole day facing the lake view, but I will definitely not have any illusions about the dining facilities here.

msg:The location and lakeside environment are great. Next to Condes. There is a large grassy area right outside the door. Since we booked early during the Mid-Autumn Festival, room (twin bed)-8806 was okay. It's just that the balcony is a little small. Single-family villas are the same. All SoftBank and wine in the room are free. Since I didn’t want to go out to eat, I made a reservation for dinner with the front desk in advance. 558/bit. Children under 10 years old are not included. It seems that we are the only ones on the Mid-Autumn Festival night. The food is generally okay, and the portions are pretty much the same. The restaurant opposite is similar. They are an independent family. Yuan Hotel is run by a private owner, and the 🏍️ at the entrance is very eye-catching. The boss is said to be young and promising. I rented the hotel's not-so-new bicycle and rode leisurely around the lake. One city was full of mountains and half was a lake. The lakes and mountains complement each other, giving you a panoramic view. Passing through Hanling Old Street, there was a lot of traffic and people. Carefully avoiding tourists and little kids really tests my driving skills. Breakfast on the second day is also served on a seat-by-seat basis, so you need to decide your staple food in advance. Such as porridge, noodles, wonton stew, etc. The side dishes are all the same. The self-service area has some fruits and vegetables plus drinks and coffee. Room service is not very responsive. The front desk guy and other waiters are young and energetic. They have tried their best, but they just need a professional team or manager to coordinate, and the experience may be better. It is easy to open a store, but difficult to close it. Hotels, restaurants, coffee, craft breweries, and service industries are all the same. Hope it gets better and better. The hotel opened in 2020. To be honest, it has not been easy after three years of epidemic! Oh, by the way, there is a public basketball court down the small stairs from the back door of the hotel. Next time I will take the ball and dunk a few baskets every morning. This time I drove there. The hotel parking spaces are limited, but parking spaces will be arranged. The road entering the hotel is prone to traffic jams when the weather is good. Because there are so many people coming to set up camp!

msg:Because several mentors and old leaders are in Ningbo, we brothers and sisters gather in Ningbo once every two years. I took a look at the high-end hotels in Dongqian Lake. Park Hyatt, Condes, and Yuan Hotel also saw the JUN Hotel in Hanling. Yuan’s price is still the highest, but their reviews are also the best, considering the teachers I like quietness, so I called the hotel to confirm. If it doesn't look like the comment, we will go to the opposite Condes the next night. The price is cheaper. After getting a positive answer from the hotel, we placed the order. Then Xiao Zhang from the hotel contacted us and said that it was our personal butler, and the girl was not a native of Ningbo.
The hotel has a special parking lot, and there will be a shuttle bus specifically to pick up the hotel on the mountain. After a series of health codes and travel codes have been checked, we have all gone to the room. Needless to say, the room hardware and other things are at the same price. ! What surprises me is that every room I booked this time has a large balcony, and the outdoor lake view is unobstructed, which is refreshing and refreshing. Several teachers also like it very much, saying that they don't know there is such a good place in Ningbo!
Because we also booked the hotel’s lake banquet box in advance, Xiao Zhang said that in the afternoon there was a film crew in the hotel, so he directly arranged for us to go to the tea room of the box for tea in advance. Speaking of this lake banquet, the lake view is invincible. Drinking tea and eating is simply a treat, but the price is a bit high, but overall it is excellent value for money!
The next day we went out to the old unit. At noon, Xiao Zhang recommended us the Dongqian Lake Datian Mountain Residence. The environment is also very good. Different from the lake view of the hotel, it is mainly in the rural style. In the evening, the big guys walked around Hanling Old Street collectively.
We were moved by a detail after two days of staying. During breakfast, a teacher casually mentioned that the mattress was too soft and didn’t sleep well all night. It happened to be heard by the staff and immediately told us that the mattress can be reversed. This will be harder. If it is not enough, it can be replaced with a rigid bed. To be honest, this kind of service is very moving.
I am very satisfied with this trip, and I am very grateful to Xiao Zhang for her service and care throughout the journey. I will come again later if I have the opportunity!

msg:Summer time in June, looking for a beautiful landscape with my dear people, choose Dongqian Lake. I carefully selected "Yuan" from a group of hotels. It was a tentative experience to experience. Unexpectedly, there are surprises everywhere!
The area of Dongqian Lake is three times that of West Lake. After traveling around the southern half of the lake, I found that the western and southern parts are still under development. The northern part is the Xiaoputuo scenic spot. Only the eastern part is mature and complete. The scenery is unique! Backed by the green hills, there are spacious and flat roads with excellent greening, as well as a large lawn park. There are tent camps. Southern Song Dynasty Rock Carving Park, Fuquan Mountain and other attractions. It is not far from the Sailing Center on the South Bank and Hanling Old Street. It is very convenient to eat, drink and play.
 "Far" is located between the tent camp and the caravan park, diagonally opposite Cordis, occupying the east side of the lake. The perfect location is the best choice for looking at the lake in a daze. The hotel is small and refined, with only 35 rooms. Each room has its own. Great view from the big terrace! When we went, catching up with the rainy weather, sitting on the terrace, listening to the patter of rain, watching the mist rising on the lake, like a painting of ink painting, with a unique charm. The hotel service is very good. We will take care and meet our needs as much as possible. The butler will contact us in advance to pay attention to our sense of experience and take the initiative to propose some service items. The hardware conditions are also good. The whole house's small smart home technology is full of Evian. Mineral water Hermes toiletries...the hotel has a gym and billiards room and two tea rooms where you can freely enjoy the design of the restaurant and study room with a strong cultural a**osphere. Breakfast is delivered to the room at the appointed time. It tastes good. If you are hungry, you can also order a set meal of steak or pasta, or go to Hanling Old Street not far away to eat Ningbo food.
This time I hurriedly came and left. Soon, the art museum, Mashan Sports Park and other construction projects will be more complete. Then I come to Dongqian Lake and I will choose here. I wish the hotel better and better 👍

Location: It has a first-line lake view, which is closer to the lake than Cordis, and its own restaurant far away has a great view.
Service: This requires a bit more pen and ink. Seeing that we have brought our children, we thoughtfully added a staple for breakfast the next day. We arrived late at the hotel that day, and took the initiative to help us upgrade the room. It rained heavily in Ningbo early the next morning. I asked if I could delay the check-out until 2 o’clock. The little sister at the front desk checked the backstage and immediately agreed. After checking out, the shuttle bus took us to the opposite parking lot. When the little brother heard us that there was a beautiful scenery along the lake road ahead, he took the initiative to drive us around. All kinds of services reflect people-oriented, no wonder it can get so many praises.
Facilities: Hermes accessories, Dyson hair dryer, free drinks in the refrigerator, and welcome fruits and red wine are prepared in the room.
I have already fooled my girlfriends with photos, see if I have a chance to come again next month

Not only the scenery is good, but the service of the young lady at the front desk is not to say. I checked the balcony on the fourth floor of the hotel and enjoyed the sunset while drinking afternoon tea. How beautiful, in short, if you come to Ningbo next time you will stay again

先訂的一個房間，2199的價格居然無窗，躺床上聞到廁所間的惡臭。後來還好被升級，好歹能有通風的地方。
設施無，停車場無，公共停車場還要聯繫接駁車，可能和佔位有關，實在太小了。
其他早餐還有服務也都一言難盡。
總之，作為民宿還算可以，但是如果按照五星級酒店的價格定位，實在讓我們一行幾人都太失望了。
