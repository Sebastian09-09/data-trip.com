One drawback was some of the front desk staffs are not proficient in English. Overall experience is wonderful.

Location is really strategic, nearby to many metro stations and only few meters away from the famous Nanjing shopping street. Thanks Holiday Inn Nanjing Street! I will stay again if I visit Shanghai.

The staff there, from the receptionists to the cleaners were more than professional and friendly and always happy to help. Overall I'd give 10/10 and would defo stay again when we visit shanghai again! Can't wait!!

msg:Holiday Inn was ridiculous by setting the temperature of the central air conditioning system at 27 degree celsius. There was literally poor air circulation and the 'strong wind' mode was not strong enough to cool down the room. My sister and I were feeling extremely hot throughout our first night stay. We called the service line, and they sent a housekeeping staff and their team of engineering support staff to come and try to talk to us to open the window for cold air to enter the room instead and kept stressing that the temperature cannot be adjusted because it's central air conditioning system. I told the housekeeping and support staff team including the customer service team that it's ineffective to set the temperature at 27 degree celsius while expecting the customers to open window to allow cold air to enter. As customers, I am buying hotel accommodation services and expecting the ideal comfort level to meet, yet I was told to open the window while they can't do anything, except to ask us to wait till there's available fan to be sent to our room as they only had 10 fans which were all been sent to other customers. How absurd that such a big hotel chain, you have only 10 fans and asking your customers to open window while you can't do anything to adjust the temperature to human comfort level of around 22 or 23 degree celsius! 
My sister and I had our sleep deprived due to the car horning, dog barking, etc noises from external due to the fact that we had to open the window for cold air to enter! The issue was even when we opened the window, not only we had been disturbed greatly by the external noises, we still felt hot and the air in the room was still.
In addition to the above mentioned, thinner blankets were unavailable when I asked for them as we were literally sleeping in sauna steam the whole night. The reply I've gotten from their customer service staff was they've only one type of blanket for their customers. Again another ridicule reason for such a big hotel chain! 
Last but not least, customers do not want free breakfast because free breakfast's not gonna resolve the main concern we had:- we had bad air circulation, high temperature inside the room, disturbed sleep from external noises(because we had to open the window) were not resolved instead. By giving free breakfast don't resolve the actual situations and problems.
Eventually, I had to make several complaints before I got a fan to improve the air circulation in the room.

msg:Recent chilly weather has compelled hotels to carefully factor in utensil temperature while preparing ingredients. My recent breakfast experience left me deeply dissatisfied as the cold weather translated to a majority of the food being served cold. The bowls and plates, seemingly straight from the refrigerator, created an uncomfortable dining atmosphere, significantly diminishing people's appetites. With the exception of the hot and satisfying ramen wonton soup crafted by the eldest sister, the rest of the dishes failed to deliver warmth.

Access - one single train ride from the airport to within 600 metres of the hotel. Convenience - I was within a 1km radius of every conceivable outlet, store, restaurant, amenity and public transportation access you could possibly ever want (and yes, I love walking!). This will be my one stop, only stop and permanent choice for stays on any trip to Shanghai in the future!

msg:Overall my stay at this Holiday Inn left much to be desired. When I got to my room I found that the fitted sheet had an awful yellow stain. I asked the front desk to send someone for a new one, but was told over the course of an hour that there were no clean sheets and that mine would have to be hand washed in the morning. I told them this was unacceptable and was moved to an different room. At first I thought this was a nice upgrade, but it wasn’t. The floor of this suite was extremely creaky and uneven. The rugs 
 were filthy and the ceiling looked damaged. The hotel had a decent breakfast buffet, though half of the food was cold. This hotel is conveniently located between shops and both People’s Station and East Nanjing. I won’t be staying here again nor would I recommend it to other travelers unless you’re in a pinch.

She didn't understand it on the first day of check-in. She called and asked how to adjust the temperature of the air conditioner? After saying that the air conditioner in our hotel has a constant temperature and can be turned off when not in use, he hung up the phone. I would like to ask, is your attitude really suitable for service? Finally, I found out that the air conditioner in the room has a constant temperature and can be turned on or off. Can't control the temperature by myself. Then there are no dental appliances in the room. You have to go to the front desk to ask for them. It's really funny. First time encountering this kind of hotel. Let’s talk about the breakfast. There are few varieties and it’s really unpalatable. Finally, I won’t say anything about hygiene. Just look at the pictures for yourselves. I took a few random pictures for your reference. It’s even a five-star hotel, and it can’t even keep up with the three-star rating. I really don’t know how it got this five-star rating!

At Check-in, Cherry was very kind to give me a room upgrade and check in early, I really appreciated this kindness. All the staff are very kind and although not all of them speak English, they were able to help me.
The hotel is located in an excellent location, between People's Square and the Bund, in the street parallel to the busy and noisier pedestrian area of ​​Nanjing Street (recommended for shopping!). The nearest metro station is 300/400 meters away.
My room on the 24th floor had an excellent view of the city. Spacious, quiet, well furnished and above all clean... it was a pleasure to stay a couple of days here.
At check out at 12:00 they let me store my luggage until 2:00 pm, enough time to have lunch and take a tour of the area.

Thanks for the nice experience! You will be a point of reference when I return to Shanghai.

But isn’t it a bit scary if you have to sell a four-star hotel with two breakfasts for more than 1,100? Secondly, the soundproofing of the room was poor. I was given a room near the elevator. You could hear the sound of the elevator and the voices of people talking in the corridor. The funniest thing is that I ordered a takeaway the night before and it was delivered by a robot. But it didn't work the next morning. I don’t quite understand the three robots that are doing well over there.

It is not far from the subway station and has its own parking lot. It is very convenient to get discounts for parking. Nice, parking in a hotel in Shanghai is also a headache! I will choose Holiday Inn again next time I come to Shanghai! (The picture was taken from the window at the end of the 21st floor. It’s very beautiful!)

However, there is a lot of dust on the floor and I think you need to be more careful about cleaning the bathroom.

msg:Hygiene is average: there was dirt on the sofa when I entered, and I called the customer to deal with it in time.
Focus: Poor service! Poor service! There should be no service at all. Choosing a brand hotel requires a little bit of service, but there was none. Two girls came out and wanted to ask the front desk to help find a cardboard box. I wanted to express more things back by myself, but they said that they had collected them all in the afternoon and didn't dare to say anything. There was no such thing in the warehouse and kitchen of such a big hotel in the afternoon, but there must be one the next morning. I just wanted a discarded cardboard box to send the express, but they didn't do it. It's very difficult! It's very difficult! There is no human touch at all. The face of the young lady at the front desk is very beautiful, and the lobby is propped up. If the face is propped up, can the inside be ignored? I don't know what the corporate culture of Holiday Inn is. What is the service of Holiday Inn, what is the character of Holiday Inn. Have you not learned the two words of character and kindness?
Facilities: It's okay, after all, the location is here
Environment: It's not bad, it's quite quiet.
But there is no service, no service, no service, no service, and the front desk will say goodbye as soon as you apply for a card. I can't hear any polite words. The sanitation was not cleaned properly and there was no apology, as it should be.

The hotel room was clean and tidy, but not the cleanest because there were some hairs. But I’m very lucky that there is no smoke smell. It’s hard to find a hotel that doesn’t smell of smoke at all. It’s very important for me who has a sensitive nose❗️

Overall, for the price, this is a very good hotel 🏨 I will choose this hotel again next time.

I would like to give a special thanks to Kimi at the front desk

We left the hotel and went to a different place. We found that the company's laptop was left in the room. She was still replying after 11 o'clock at night.
I followed up the next morning after work. To be honest, I really have no illusions that I'll find it. A friend has lost valuables in other hotels before and couldn't find them. The reply was very official. But soon I was told that I had found it. I'm very happy. They exceeded expectations by a huge margin! I also found some other items of mine, including chocolates and charging cables.
The laptop and charging cable were delivered to me by SF Express. The chocolates were accepted by me after repeated insistence. I couldn’t be there. Please let me express my gratitude.

I'm really satisfied, not very touched!

Generally speaking, hotel hardware can be achieved by high-end hotels now, but good service is commendable, and people are fundamental. This hotel makes people feel at ease. The service staff are not official and polite, but really consider the customers. They really think about it. When you do something well, you will feel comfortable, friendly and reassured

Thank you Holiday Inn, thank you Kimi. Two near misses happened during this trip to Shanghai, and this is one of them. Thank you 🙏

Next time I go to Shanghai, I want to thank Kimi in person.

If the window of the room faces in the opposite direction from Nanjing Street, the normal view is from about the 18th floor; below, look into the building opposite. If the windows face Nanjing Street, then the view from any floor is good. We lived on the 22nd floor. The room is cleaned, towels are changed every day. They refused breakfast. There are many cafes around. We had breakfast there, 2 times cheaper and variety. The hotel lobby is very modest for 4 stars. Drink coffee, just sit, don’t want to chat. We went to neighboring hotels to drink coffee - it’s chic and shiny, it’s nice to sit in the lobby. In general, if you only spend the night at a hotel, then it’s fine.

The walking distance from the subway station is acceptable and suitable for people who get up early and go out. If you take a taxi, you will find that there is only one traffic light about 100 meters away. Drivers have to pass at least four traffic lights 500 meters away. This is the case in this small area. I don’t know what was considered in the previous planning. . .
The hygiene is just that, the bathroom has a bit of a smell, I recommend putting more disinfectant in it. . .

The prices ranged from 400 to 1,000+. After reading the reviews, I thought I was worried about the cheap environment or the size. In the end, I chose this hotel, the price is above average, the room, location and environment are all very good. Facing the pedestrian street, but the sound insulation effect is very good.

The breakfast variety is not rich and there are not many locations…
The room was not big and the bed was too soft. After staying for two nights, the cleaning was careless on the second day and the bedding was untidy.

They all said that the hotel was very comfortable and the room was quite big and clean. The only drawback was that the front desk was a little unresponsive and the takeaways were not always available. I couldn't get the robot to deliver it in time, so later on I asked the delivery person to directly operate it when the robot was free. Otherwise, I might be too busy to go down and get it myself. I would like to thank the front desk staff ELLA. Our flight back was very late and she extended our check-out for us. Thank you very much! It is recommended to put a basket on the floor under the towel compar**ent in the bathroom to put used towels, which will be more user-friendly.

I didn’t see a bellman from the time I checked in until I left the hotel. When I left, the driver who Ctrip hired a car to pick me up didn’t arrive early. I'm worried that there will be a security guard at the door of the car park. I tell him that you are worrying too much. This hotel does not deserve a doorman or security guard. As soon as I entered the room after checking in, I saw used cotton swabs in the trash can in the bathroom. The shower room was leaking and the water that flowed under the sink was not wiped. The trash can in the room was also turned into a classified trash can, which was simply useless. , the bucket is not big originally, it is divided into two halves, I can put whatever I can in it, and finally I prepared a garbage bag to put outside the bucket. The next day, the housekeeping service finished cleaning the room. When I went back to the room, I saw that the various residues left by the children eating on the table the day before had not been wiped away at all. The dust on the floor was clearly visible. It seemed that I just came in to tidy up the quilt. , I asked the waiter to come in and clean again, and came with a mop. Such a big hotel doesn’t even have a vacuum cleaner? Breakfast is also very average, with few varieties and poor quality. The only advantage of this hotel is that it is close to Nanjing Road. The rest is hard to describe.

msg:10.1-10.5 Because we were traveling with elderly people and children, we chose a hotel closer to the attractions and booked two twin rooms. I don’t know if it was because the front desk was unskilled or something, but it took at least half an hour to check in. In the end, we waited in a hurry. After some urging, it was done immediately, and they promised to arrange the rooms together for us, because the children would go back and forth between the two rooms. But when I went upstairs, I found that they were far apart. I called the customer service and said they would arrange it for us the next day. I called customer service the other day and said we were a little late and there were no rooms available. Me? ? ? ? ? Every morning before going out to play, I would call customer service to ask for new sheets and quilt covers. However, the cleaning staff told us to change them every three days. After our strong request, the cleaning staff agreed to change them with extreme reluctance. After making the bed, the quilt covers were drooping. On the ground (p4), the room card accidentally fell into the room. I called the customer service to report the information. After reporting it, they said it was wrong. Then I would like to ask what is the use of facial comparison of the personal information entered during check-in? After waiting for almost 20 minutes, we came up to swipe the card and it was still because of our repeated urging. Is this the service standard a five-star hotel should have? The service must at least be worthy of the money consumers spend! It's really the worst hotel I've ever stayed in!

Seeing that we had brought children, we asked about our accommodation needs and thoughtfully arranged for the 23rd floor. It was very quiet and the view was very good. The children told me excitedly, "It's so big." The location is very convenient, one minute away from the pedestrian street and within easy reach, but it was the last attraction I visited😆. There are many foreigners in the hotel and they are very friendly. My son only knows hello and bye. He greets everyone everywhere and responds to every foreigner, which greatly satisfies his self-esteem.

Three subway lines lead directly to the railway station, Hongqiao and Pudong Airports, Jing'an Temple, Lujiazui, etc., making it the first choice for tourists traveling by public transportation.
The facilities should be considered relatively good and new among the hotels around Renguang. The sanitary condition is very good. My mother has very high requirements for hygiene. She checked many details and corners, and it is rare that she can praise it full of praise.
The only drawback is that there seems to be a little sound from the air conditioner outside the window of our room. In addition, the weather was not very good that night and there was sometimes a whistling wind sound, but the overall impact was not big.

The lobby is small and messy, and the check-in speed at the front desk is slow. It only takes ten minutes for one person to check in. The room is not big and the facilities are very simple. As soon as I enter, I feel that it is not as good as the 200-yuan hotel room I stayed in elsewhere... The price is basically high because of the location, but the most basic function of the hotel is accommodation. At least it is Could you please mention the quality of the room?
There are not many types of breakfast, but the quality is very average. I thought the breakfast would be good based on the reviews and price, but I was disappointed.

The beautiful room service sister on the 24th floor is very enthusiastic. She added quilts to both of our rooms and cleaned them in time every day. It was a pleasant trip.

The room was very spacious. The shower in the bathroom was made by Kohler. The water flow was smooth and the water temperature was stable. The hotel provided children's toothbrushes, toothpaste and slippers. We enjoyed our stay. The hotel provides free mini bar and welcome fruit plate on the night of check-in, which is very heartwarming. The hotel bathrobes and towels are clean and of good quality. The front desk receptionist and lobby manager are very enthusiastic and have a very good attitude. They will patiently answer the questions raised by the guests. The room attendants clean in a timely manner and are also very enthusiastic and thoughtful. Especially the waiter Zhou Qiumei, who serves with a smile every time and cleans very seriously. In short, the overall feeling of staying in the hotel for 6 nights was very comfortable. I hope it can be maintained. I will choose this hotel next time I go to Shanghai.

msg:This is the first time I gave a negative review. I feel that the hotel is where Indians gather. It makes people feel that they are in India instead of Shanghai. Every day, I see two or three buses picking up Indians. There are Indians everywhere in the hotel. There is a strong and pungent smell of inferior Indian perfume in the lobby, restaurant, elevator, corridors, and rooms.
No complaints, the location of the hotel is good, you can walk to several scenic spots, the attitude of the staff is not bad, the hotel does not provide toothpaste, toothbrush and razor, you need to call the customer service to ask for it, the supplies are of the quality of an express hotel, the carpet is dirty, and the unit price is nearly 1200 yuan per room, which is not worth the price. I originally booked two rooms for 4 nights. Maybe it’s because of jet lag. Indians don’t come back to the room until 3:00 in the morning, and then they gather in the room to make noise. The third night in the hotel was unbelievable. I couldn’t bear to be woken up at 3:00 in the morning for several nights in a row. I called the front desk twice to complain and let the room next door stop. I guess the hotel told the room next door that we complained. The Indians next door kicked the door of our room twice. The Indian theory, was pulled back by my wife, and almost called the police. The hotel replied that I didn’t see the Indian in the next room knocking on my door in the surveillance. So far, I haven’t given any explanation. I have stayed in so many hotels, and I have never encountered such an outrageous thing.

ADa at the front desk saw that the big bed room we booked with our 11-year-old child was a bit crowded. He was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to upgrade us to a small suite. The child was very happy to see that he could sleep alone on the sofa bed.
The breakfast is also rich. You can always find what you like with a combination of Chinese and Western. It is said that there are many foreign friends there recently.
The cooling effect of the air conditioner is excellent. People who are not afraid of the cold can sleep well at night under the quilt.

There was an elderly person next to me who didn't know that the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street was nearby, so he asked if there were any recommended places to eat. The lady at the front desk was very helpless. He said patiently: "Isn't it the same in the back?" The breakfast experience was also very bad, and the seating arrangement efficiency was very low during peak hours. After queuing for a while, the waiter took us in to sit at a table for four, and repeatedly confirmed it with the waiter next to us. There was no one around. The children sat and waited while the adults went to get breakfast. When they came back, someone else took the seat. The waiter explained that this seat was reserved for diamond members. Okay, then don't let us sit in the first place. He took a I piled up food and looked around for a seat. If I wasn't in a hurry to leave, I would definitely have to make some arguments. There are so many hotels on the Bund and Pedestrian Street. I definitely won't stay at the Holiday Inn next time. It's better to have Wang Baohe across the street.

This time, the experience of entering through the hotel entrance was not very good, maybe because of the lack of staff. The front desk clerk completed the check-in procedure quickly without smiling. Then I found that the shower pipe in the bathroom was broken, but it didn't affect the use, so I didn't inform the front desk. When booking the room, I registered that I had children staying with me, but I didn’t prepare anything. I had to call the front desk to bring them over.
The most important thing is to mention the experience of the buffet in the morning. The restaurant manager seems to be of Indian nationality and is very kind and polite. The breakfast variety is also ok. The other waiters are also polite, but there is a fat man wearing chef's clothes in the Chinese style. The male chef who served near the restaurant was very rude, didn't smile, and answered customers' questions in a disgusting tone. I felt unwelcome! Hope their staff will be trained!

2. The washbasin is not separated from the room. This is the biggest shortcoming of this family room and it is not very convenient. The hotel responds to the call of Shanghai, and does not place disposable toothbrush, etc., but ask the waiter for it. Drinks in the mini fridge are free.
3. Although the breakfast restaurant is in the lobby on the first floor, it looks small, but it does not feel crowded when you actually eat, but the a**osphere is good. The breakfast is very rich, with many varieties and good quality, especially the stir-fried beef with rice cakes on the first morning, which is very cost-effective and tastes good. The boiled wonton stew is especially delicious. The coffee needs a little more quality improvement.
4. The surrounding area is very lively and convenient. There are many places to eat and many cafes. The fourth exit of Metro Line 2 to Pudong Airport and Hongqiao Airport is also close to the hotel, and the People's Square subway station is not too far away. It is very convenient to go to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street and the Bund, and you can see Nanjing Road from the window.
5. The decoration of the hotel is relatively new, in a small and fresh style.
6. The front desk and floor attendants are very friendly and responsive.

It's so convenient that you don't want it. It's also very convenient to order takeaway. There is a takeaway counter at the door, which is very convenient. The service staff is very friendly, and they also help to store luggage when checking out. I have a small suggestion, clean up under the bed.

The hotel is next to the pedestrian street, it is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun. It is about 5 minutes walk from the subway station, and it only takes more than 10 minutes to walk to the Bund. There are many delicious foods nearby, and I will definitely choose Holiday Inn again next time I come to Shanghai.

Come to Shanghai for tourism and business, my five-star recommendation.

Fortunately, in the end, the lobby manager helped upgrade the room to a view room and checked in in time.
The check-in experience was not good. There was no carpet in the room. It was similar to a Home Inn. I originally planned to stay for three nights, but ended up checking out after one night.

You can tacitly allow foreign friends to jump in line; when it was your turn to check in, the male staff member wearing glasses asked me the first question, "Do you want to stay?" (What do you think, am I watching the excitement?) When I asked for a side room, his reply was that all the rooms in our hotel cannot see the night view of the Bund (Speechless, did I ask you?) When he asked me how to get my car out of the parking lot, he said I am impatient; reflect on myself, if I were a foreigner, would I be able to enjoy the same trea**ent?

When I mentioned that the temperature in the room was too high and my living experience was poor, the hotel staff not only said sorry and apologized, but also offered me a late check-out as compensation. Haha, no need to be so polite. I quickly packed my bags and left.
2. There are uncleaned hairs on the carpet in the house.
3. The slippers that were delivered were dirty and had dirt marks on the surface.
4. The hotel's buffet breakfast is suitable for foreigners' tastes, and the considerate curry food is popular. Many foreigners stay. It seems that Indians like this hotel very much, so they all come to stay.
Please pay attention to lightning protection when you come to Shanghai. After all, you can’t step on the same pitfall a second time.

There is a buffet restaurant and lobby on the first floor, and there are foreign chefs in charge, which is quite fun. The guy who received us was Jason, who was very polite and had a good attitude. My only regret is that I forgot to take pictures in the hotel

The subway station lines near the hotel are concentrated, and scenic spots a little away are just one or two stops away. I came here to travel with my family, and they were very satisfied with staying here. The interior decoration of the room is new, and the room type also meets the accommodation needs of this trip. Kimi at the front desk is very enthusiastic, answers questions patiently, and is kind and satisfied. I will continue to choose here next time I come.

msg:Twenty years later, I stayed at HOLLIDAY INN again. Brother Dylan at the front desk checked us into a room on the 24th floor. The room faces south and west. Although we can't see the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street or the Oriental Pearl Tower, it is relatively quiet and suitable for the needs of old mothers. It would be even better if it could be located eastward. The occupancy rate of the hotel is quite high. We arrived late, probably because the room was not booked.
The room is clean and very quiet, the mattress is good and friendly to the waist, and the pillows are also thoughtfully marked with softness and firmness. The rhythm of falling asleep in a second. The elevator needs to swipe the room card to be safe.
The dining place is not big, but everything you want to eat is here haha. The food that has been taken from the buffet will be replenished in time. It can be said that the place is not big and has everything that one expects to find. A hotel full of sincerity (๑ºั╰╯ººั๑) is a good choice for shopping in Renguang, Pedestrian Street, and Fuzhou Road to feel the fireworks of old Shanghai.

It has been two days since I checked out on the 20th. We booked an average of more than 1,000 a night for three nights. I don’t know what the difference is in the upgraded room? It's all landscape anyway.
1. There are no disposable toiletries and combs in the room. We don't use toothbrushes, but the combs are for the children to comb their hair. The room service will be delivered in 20 minutes. a little slow. In the middle of the night, the room service was very fast, and the quilt was delivered.
2. The roadside is very noisy, the road is being repaired, and those who are light sleepers may not be able to sleep.
3. The chair for the desk in the room is really not worthy of the price of the room, it is dirty.
4. However, the location of the hotel is good, it is very close to everything, and there is a double-decker bus stop not far from the door.

There is a construction site next to it, and the noise is very loud, which affects rest.
The water pressure is unstable, and the hot water always switches to cold water automatically, so I dare not bathe the children. The water launch is even slower. When I arrived at the hotel, I first contacted the maintenance personnel to come in and repair the water, and it was delayed for more than 20 minutes.
It is not so much a five-star hotel as it is the standard of an express hotel.
The so-called three-separated bathroom is really just a good-looking picture, and the sound insulation is really poor.

msg:I come to this hotel every time I go to Shanghai, but the company changed me this time. As a result, the road was built downstairs and I didn’t fall asleep. I asked for help during the holiday. The front desk arranged the highest floor and let me check in very early. Before I left The counter also gave earplugs which saved my sleep. Wake up and go to the headquarters for a meeting, come back at 7:00 and sleep until 5:00 in the morning. The view from the room is really good. You can see Shanghai slowly from night to early morning and then to the bright sunshine. My mood is much better than the lack of sleep the previous day. Haze, thank you so much

msg:Families, brothers staying in this hotel is a big move. All links are given a one-point evaluation because there is no way to score any less. It can be said with certainty that it is one of the worst hotels I have personally stayed in the country. If you count his price, please remove one of them.
①Check-in at one o'clock said that the room was not cleaned well, and it was after two o'clock. To be honest, this kind of situation is rarely encountered in domestic hotels, but we must obey them and upgrade to a suite room type for free. Live in the heart of being cheap and not taking advantage, who knows that it will be the beginning of collapse
②Stay in room 1901. The room is at the end of the hotel. To be honest, I don't like to live in the corner room. But they upgraded for free, so I'm sorry, I can only live here, who knows that the room can be seen at a glance. What about the suite? Where is the cover? Finally saw it on the wine list. 80 yuan a box. Forget it, we can bear it when we are away from home.
③I wanted to take a break, but just as I lay down, the sound of decoration came over, and I couldn't rest at all. Called the front desk and said it was re-carpeting. I said I wanted to change the room but didn't want to change it for me, so I found their manager again. The manager said a few high-sounding words, and went to investigate again, blah blah blah. In the end, I was told that there was still an hour to finish the work, and if I insisted on changing it, I could change it for me. The whole speechless, we bear it when we are away from home.
④After changing to room 1201, as soon as I entered the room, there was a smell of decoration glue that was not dry. Every time I choose a hotel, I like to choose the one that has just been renovated, it is clean and tidy, who knew that your hotel is still under renovation. If you want to change the room and have just changed it, it is probably the same. No one can afford to go out, bear with it. Who knew it wasn't over yet.
⑤Turn on the light in the room, crackling like lightning, tears are flashing out for you, okay, turn it off quickly. When I called to respond, I actually asked the engineer to come and take a look. Can your hardware problem be solved by engineering? And when the lights are turned on, they are going to rest after dinner at night. Really drunk, stronger than half a catty of wine I drank. Still that sentence can only be tolerated when going out.
⑥I wanted to take a bath and sleep, but there was no hot water. I collapsed at that time. By the way, I verbally greeted the family members of the relevant personnel in the hotel. After studying for half a day, the pressure is not enough, and the hot water cannot come out. The whole person crashed.
Stay in the hotel, sound, light, electricity, color, smell and taste. Tidy it all up for me. It's not too much to give a bad review.

There are still cracks in the walls, the soft decoration of the elevator is damaged, and the carpet is uneven and dirty. There is rubbish on the ground. The quality of the toiletries provided is inferior (cheap hotel supplies) The room is small and there is no writing desk. TV has no foreign channels! The tile floor is not caulked. There are too few types of breakfast, the taste of coffee is sp****, and the chef is noisy... It is not as good as Jinjiang Inn more than ten years ago. I don't know how the reviews on the Internet and luxury hotels come from?

msg:Changing the carpet started at 9:00 in the morning, and I called many times without any solution. The front desk just said coldly that it had been notified in the group, and there was no other way to solve it! As a result, it changed from one person beating to four people beating together. Is this a solution or discrimination against foreigners? If there are only these sugar plugs for more than an hour, no one can solve it! It wasn't until about eleven o'clock that someone slowly came up and said to change a room. I really don't know what the hotel thinks. The temperature in Shanghai was only five or six degrees that day. How can I rest in a cold room? How do you rest in less than an hour? It takes a long time to ask for a toothbrush! Even if the facilities are outdated, the musty smell of the carpet in the room also fills the whole room. Is this the sense of superiority of the Shanghainese or the hotel's so-called five-star standard? This kind of standard and attitude is really not as good as some chain four-star and fast hotels! I really don't know how this five-star review is made! Very bad experience! I wonder if the coming March 15 will make this situation better!

Sanitation: The sanitation is the best I have ever lived in, and it is not even one of them. The floor and carpet are clean and free of any dust (the level where you can walk barefoot). The design of the whole house is very simple, and it is clean at a glance

Environment: Within 100 meters of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, you can see the scenery of the pedestrian street outside the window when you look up

All in all, five-star recommendation, I hope it will get better and better

I repeatedly stated that the child was afraid of sleeping in the room, so I wouldn’t deliver it, and then I was told when I checked out.

msg:The hotel staff are warm and welcoming, and the hotel's environmental sanitation is relatively comfortable. The most important thing is that it is very close to the pedestrian street. Walk out in less than 10 minutes. It is less than 20 minutes to the Bund. It's very convenient to travel. The only thing that made me feel uncomfortable was that the house price on the second day increased by several hundred, and I visited 4 places in two days. They are all close to the hotel. The most important thing is that it is also convenient to walk the baby. Don't run long distances.

msg:Very average, big disappoin**ent, worst holiday ever, will not choose again. If there is a problem, I will only say sorry, but solve the problem. I saw online reviews saying that it was so hot that I couldn’t sleep, but I didn’t believe it. I had to believe it after staying for one night. 799 does not include breakfast just for convenience, but it’s too bad. Will write online reviews. What's even more funny is that when I didn't arrive at the hotel at night, I was told that I was lucky to call and deliver the things later, and the service staff would leave work. What a huh, it turns out that the service in Greater Shanghai is so special, which I have never heard of. Decisively live in Marriott on the second day, the gap is not a little bit

I turned on the 24-degree air conditioner at night and couldn’t sleep at all. It’s so hot that I’m speechless. The windows are broken I can only rely on a pen to support me like this. It’s ridiculous to say that such a small window really sleeps through the night and hasten to change hotels the next day...

msg:The sanitation of the room is not in place, and the floor is obviously dusty. You need to ask the staff for slippers and toiletries. Since you arrived at the hotel early, the staff forgot to give the waiting card after check-in, which led to problems with the formal check-in. The staff added WeChat and said there was a problem You can go to her directly for questions, but no one responds when you actually consult. It is understandable that you are busy with work and have no time, but can you not reply to messages after falling asleep in the middle of the night? The whole thing was woken up. For a hotel of this price, I am quite impressed that there is no free breakfast. Of course, I know in advance that one person is willing to fight and the other is willing to suffer, but it is a bit thick-skinned to take the initiative to ask for five-star praise.

I thought it was a small sofa bed until I entered the room and pulled it out to see. It was a pleasant surprise, and it perfectly suited our situation! Not only does it save an extra bed, but the sofa bed is also huge! This is so satisfying! The breakfast is also rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western, enough to satisfy a family.

I waited for a long time before it was my turn to check in. During the inquiry process, I found that the booking was for a holiday instead of their home. Wang Baohe The service attitude of the front desk of the hotel is really different from that of the Holiday Inn. As soon as you enter the holiday hotel, you will feel at home. The little brother at the front desk is handsome, kind and sunny. The hotel facilities are simple and complete, and the breakfast is rich and delicious. The hotel is about 100 meters from Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. It costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi to Lujiazui and the Bund. Very convenient. Next time you go to Shanghai, here is still the best choice.

I went there after seeing a picture of Ctrip's standard room. When I arrived, I was told that the picture of Ctrip's standard room was actually a room with a view, not the same price. The actual room in the picture was much more expensive than the same room in the Ctrip picture. I don’t know if it’s Ctrip or the hotel’s false advertising. I didn’t want to stay at first, but I was really tired. I thought it would be okay to have a good rest in such an expensive room, but the actual situation was disappointing. The room was very old, and the overall hardware and software were not worth the price. . I won’t stay here again!

The location of the hotel is quiet, close to the commercial street, and the front desk staff is very considerate to give a room on a high floor, which will not be noisy (although it is facing the street). The hotel attaches great importance to green travel, but when checking in, the front desk will actively ask for the needed supplies and provide them. Compared with passively providing them, proactive inquiries will make people feel good.
The interior decoration of the room is relatively new, and the items look clean and tidy. In terms of details, the pillow is sewn with soft and hard marks on the pillowcase, which is easy to choose; the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, which is convenient for family travel.
Overall, I am very satisfied, the quality of the international chain is still guaranteed, it is worth recommending!

Cleanliness: The cleanliness is not in place at all. As soon as you enter, you can see that the floor is very dirty, full of dirt and dust. At this price, it cannot give the quality it should have.
Environmental facilities: You can see that the workmanship of the room is very rough. When taking a bath, the hot water sometimes freezes and sometimes heats up, which is unstable. The cribs provided in the two rooms are not buckled securely, which is too dangerous for children to sleep on. The assistance staff came and told me They say that every one is like this (the attitude of the assistants is OK), but I still have to change to a baby crib that is fine under my insistence. Should you take a good look at your facilities? The baby cribs are not safe, how can you give them to the guests? use. 
Kimi, the front desk clerk, has a good attitude and is very helpful in solving problems.

We booked a hotel that day and arrived at the hotel very late at night after leaving Disneyland. It was already difficult for the couple to carry the luggage with two sleeping babies in their arms. No one in the hotel took the initiative to help. Can you believe it... not a single person. The concierge at the front desk is indifferent, even if ten small hotels saw this, they would not be like this. Then when we checked in, the front desk looked like we owed money and looked at our large and small bags without any sense of service. Indifferent attitude.
Room: My husband and I had a fight over the room. It was just that there was hair on the floor of the bathroom. The smell of **** in the room was really strong and unbearable... You can make up your own mind.

There is a pedestrian street just outside the door. It is also very close to the Bund. It is convenient for travel and shopping. It is the first time I stay in this hotel.

The first time I got takeout, I called the front desk and told me that there were no robots, so I had to go get it by myself. Is this the only service for a hotel that costs a thousand dollars a night? Even if the robot is broken, the customer should not be responsible for this mistake. At least I have to politely ask if I want to send it to me when I call. In short, the experience is very poor! ! !

Just arrived home, endured exhaustion and unpacked my luggage. I saw the backpack that Helenli gave to the children, and I felt a lot more happy. From the first day of my stay, I took three babies for breakfast. She took the initiative to help find a place and help look after the youngest baby Helping me find a way to pack the soup for Bak Kut Teh today reveals her love for the service industry!
The lobby manager of the restaurant and bar on the first floor, a very gentleman, knew that I was going to the zoo, but he didn't have a knife to cut carrots, so he took the initiative to help me coordinate and let the chef take four pounds! Four pounds! Four pounds of carrots! Cut into *****s!
There are also aunts and sisters who are on the night shift in the guest room, who help us make the bed surrounds and cribs, and the enthusiastic aunts who clean the room during the day shift. Here, I sincerely thank these people who have paid for the service industry. Your existence makes us people in foreign countries. Heart is very warm! In the new year, I also wish you a smooth work and a happy family!

When I checked in at the front desk, I found that I had made a mistake in the check-in date and made it a day earlier. Although I didn't check in, the guarantee should be deducted according to reason. After communicating with the hotel, I canceled the order for free and checked in again.

It worked for a while, but it didn't work. Let's make a phone call, everyone looks at the picture, but I don't know which one to press to contact the front desk. Hot water is also hot and cold. There are still stains on the nightgown. It doesn't look like a new hotel opened in 2021. It's a bad experience. Finally, I contacted Ctrip, and it was only after twelve o'clock in the evening that I changed the room.

Washing is a dry and wet partition. Hygiene is great in every way. I saw a lot of hotels before going to Shanghai, and I finally booked this place by chance and felt very lucky. On the first day of check-in, I added the WeChat of the hotel customer service amy, which is very considerate, polite and warm. Because the flight ticket was one day in advance, the accommodation that I didn't live in was refunded for free, and the room was also given free upgrade and free late check-out for me. Definitely a very good experience. The only downside is that the window is too soft, it is recommended to prepare a little hard bed for guests with bad waist in the future. However, it still does not affect my 5-star praise for it.

Secondly, the location of the hotel is also very good, and travel is very convenient. There are also many types of breakfast. The meat and vegetable pairing is very good.

The pedestrian street is just a few steps away. It's so convenient! The interior decoration is the usual casual style of the Holiday Inn, and the stay is very comfortable. The young lady at the front desk promoted me to the Nanjing Road Street View Room, and I can see the magic city three-piece suit when I look out of the window! Snicker~

Not only did I check in immediately, but also upgraded my family room with thoughtfulness, and also gave me fruit drinks and other small gifts, which was very heartwarming! The hotel is clean, hygienic, comfortable and professional in service. The most important thing is that you can see Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street when you open the window.

msg:Alan Liu helped me when I checked in
He explained all matters clearly
Alan is very enthusiastic
Smile and affinity
Very smooth and pleasant when checking in
Thanks Alan!!! (IHG should add chicken legs to such a colleague)

The first feeling after entering the room is to be attracted by the scenery outside the window
You can overlook the pedestrian street of East Nanjing Road
That's great 👏🏼👍🏼
Although the room is not big
But it can separate dry and wet
It's really a small sparrow, it has all the internal organs
Very good job details


In fact, when I went downstairs and arrived at the lobby check out the next day
At that time, a female colleague surnamed Jia checked out for me
I just said "Hello!"
I didn’t see any smile or affinity in it
When I walked to the counter, she asked me what help I needed
I just said softly, "Hello, I need to check out. Thank you!"
She hurriedly replied, "Give me the room card and you can leave!"
I also paid attention to her expression at the time
I feel a little impatient
I hurriedly said "I have a backpack to store! Thank you!"
Then she reluctantly helped me with the deposit
At that time, it felt like I was embarrassed by her. 🤣🤣🤣
I'm thinking
I just want to store my backpack
Isn't it?

Generally speaking, the hotel is good whether it is software or hardware~

I hope IHG can train more colleagues
Thank you 🙏🏼

The environment is good, the decoration is new, and the interior is also very intimate with ironing clothes racks and steam irons; 3. The breakfast is really very good Beautiful, with a combination of Chinese and Western food, and the dishes are both informative and fresh. Fourth, the service is very considerate. You can prepare fruit and beverage packages when you check in. Fifth, the price/performance ratio is really high. I feel that this section of the road is not profitable at this price.

Surprisingly, this INN maintains the usual standard of other city INNs. Although there are no three-piece suits in the landscape, there are at least two-piece suits. After all, the hotel is new, with large TVs, remote-controlled curtains, and capsule coffee machines and supporting capsule coffee. Get up in the morning and start a beautiful day with a cup of capsule coffee. Thank you, Miss MIA, Nanjing Road Inn is definitely the best choice when you come to Shanghai next time.

msg:On the first day in Shanghai, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt. Then we were going to Disneyland, so we stayed at the Wyndham Hotel, which is relatively close to Disneyland. Later, we entered the city and stayed at the Holiday Inn Hotel, which is relatively close to People’s Square. First of all, let’s talk about the hotel’s facilities. I stayed in a 18-inch king-size bed room. The hotel gave me a double-bed room with two 1.2-size beds joined together. I admire you here. Then I stayed in your hotel for one night and my feet were itchy ( It may be an allergy, the hotel hygiene has something to do with it). And the price of the hotel is not cheap (the room rate I stayed at was 700) and the price of the Crowne Plaza opposite was 720. This is the first time I have reviewed this hotel and I will never go back to this hotel again!

The bathroom water is particularly large and refreshing! . Except for the poor service at the front desk (cold attitude and slow speed), the others are very good. There is only one family room on each floor. After several struggles, I was given a higher floor, but let me wait for half an hour. After several negotiations, the room key was only obtained after an hour and a half. It was already three o'clock in the afternoon, and the plan to go to the exhibition was ruined! So friends who want to book a family room must pay attention and don't delay the trip! . Special thanks to Wang Yuying, the floor supervisor, for his enthusiastic attitude, and taking the initiative to help push the luggage cart, and feel at home. This kind of service is worth the price of more than 900! Mid-Autumn Festival price increase!

I booked this holiday hotel nearby because I had an appoin**ent with friends at People’s Square. The overall service was pretty good. I checked in at 10 o’clock in the morning. I was scared and afraid that I would have to wait until 2 o’clock to live in, but it went smoothly after arriving. After checking in, the little brother at the front desk was very considerate to help me upgrade the landscape big bed room for free, and gave me a bag of fruit, which was praised for the free upgrade room type.
🍃Environment:
The room is clean and not noisy. The pillows are very soft and comfortable to sleep at night, but I don’t know why. Sometimes there is no smell in the quilt. I hope I can pay attention to it next time.
🚗 Transportation:
500m away from the pedestrian street, it is very convenient for shopping, eating, drinking and having fun.

There are two big fans in the shopping mall outside the window of the hotel, which are constantly making noise, and I haven't slept well all night!

The rooms are automatically created. The inner and the Bund are very close. There are snacks and restaurants nearby. , The door of the room is very dirty, and it looks like it can't be wiped off.

msg:The location is superb, Nanjing Road is just outside the door, and you can see Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street from the room. The service is very good. My child and I went to the hotel. The child was a bit motion sick. I asked her to buy a can of Sprite by herself, which could relieve her uncomfortable vomiting and hiccups. She saw that the price was high and she put it back because it was too expensive. I was checking in, and I was chatting with a big sister in the lobby. It should be the leader of the management. Seeing that the child was not willing to buy Sprite, he even took a can of it and gave it to the child directly, asking her to pay her, not, saying that it was not for trea**ent. I'm very touched. Although the money is not much, it allows me to experience the care of my family.
Also, the breakfast is in the lobby. I thought it was small, but it was actually quite comprehensive. Both Chinese and Western dishes are available, which is not expensive.
The room is not very big, but clean and tidy. Give me a thumbs up and book here next time.
