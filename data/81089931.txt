The hotel is clean and hygienic, much better than the imagined homestay. The service staff, especially the housekeeper, are also very enthusiastic and take good care of our three meals a day. I stayed for three days this time, reading in the morning and visiting the tea mountain in the afternoon. It was very pleasant.
The hotel room faces the valley, and you can also see the unbeatable scenery while sitting in the room.

A little bit next to it is a tea mountain, a super large tea mountain. It is so comfortable to walk around when you have nothing to do. The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic. I called the front desk for 999 at night because of a headache. The front desk specially boiled a pot of brown sugar ginger tea and brought it over. The brother also cut a bamboo for me as a hiking stick! And the hotel food is delicious! Especially the cured pork ribs soup pot, there is a lot of meat, a bit like the villagers make it, not salty or bland, that wonton! Delicious üòã! Stayed for two days, two words, comfortable!

Although communication is a bit difficult sometimes, they are very enthusiastic. The facilities are definitely very good in Liangshan area, and the scenery is also quite good. It is suitable for couples and parents to lie down and relax.
There is no gym, but running in the mountains or doing aerobics on the balcony of the room is much more comfortable than lifting weights. The overall hygiene is still very good, but after all, there will always be bugs in the room in the mountains, so choose carefully if you mind.
There is a relatively long mountain road to the hotel, which is relatively easy to drive, but it is recommended not to go after dark.
The price is a little expensive, and the overall cost performance is medium.

msg:I went there in March. I don't know if it was the wrong season, but there was nothing there. I arrived at 2am on the first day. I was told that there was a tea mountain next to it and I could pick and make tea. I was very excited, but it turned out that it was not open. There were only a few tea farmers picking tea. I asked the staff and they said that this place was private and not open to the public. Even in the tea harvesting season, tourists were not allowed to participate. So the whole afternoon I went to that place was wasted.
The room is very good, with floor heating, and the air is very bad. It is reasonable that it is spring and blooming at the end of March, and the visibility is very high. It took 4 hours to drive from Chengdu to such a remote mountain, and the air and visibility should be very good. As a result, the quality is very poor, and there are no clouds. The day I went there was sunny, and the smog seemed very heavy. I saw on the way back that there are many industrial factories nearby, and the sewage is very serious. The service is very thoughtful. The next morning, we will take tourists to the back mountain to dig wild vegetables, which are the local zheergen. We ate them that night when we got home. They are so-so, without the wild fragrance. Of course, it is okay to pick them for fun. After coming down the mountain, we participated in the 88-yuan Qingtuan activity. In fact, it is to prepare things for you, and you rub them like making glutinous rice balls, and then the kitchen will steam them for tourists to take away. Qingtuan is not made of cotton grass. I heard from the staff that it is made of green vegetable juice. If you want to experience it in depth, it is recommended not to go. Go so far, and the room is not cheap. This is a government-supported project. Obviously, it is not as careful as a private boss. You work for others. If you just want to experience what it's like to sleep in a tree house, you can go there. It is indeed at the top of the mountain, but don't hold out hope for the scenery of the mountains or the night sky.

There are many activities to get close to nature in the resort. Here, I saw fireflies. The staff are very nice. Five-star recommendation, it is a place worth a special trip.

In addition to the activities in the resort, there are also rafting in Xuekou Mountain and Dazhubao Yangtianwo, a secret place with few people.

msg:There is not much to take pictures of in the room, the official pictures are already very beautiful. The scenery is beautiful and the environment is very comfortable. The meals provided by the butler are good and homely, and both adults and children like them.
Let me mention a few not-so-good points. There are fundamental differences between resorts and hotels. The experience of staying there is not good.
1. The room design is quite impractical. There is no comfortable seat in the 600-square-meter room. The living room is crowded, the seats are uncomfortable, and there is no public sink and toilet. The upstairs room is separated from other rooms, making it difficult for families with children. It is very inconvenient to live.
2. The housekeeper is on hand to provide service. He does not rush you with words and is very honest with your body. You should be in a hurry to get off work. Especially on the day of check-out, I started cleaning the living room at 7 a.m., with dishes colliding, tables and chairs being dragged, and the floor being cleaned. I couldn't sleep at all. Before I checked out, two-thirds of the entire building had been cleaned. The water basin that had already been cleaned was politely refused to be used because there was no handkerchief to clean it again.
3. It is recommended not to order the barbecue. The only seasonings are chili noodles and Sichuan peppercorns. You have to ask for other seasonings. If you ask for them, you have to wait for them to be delivered slowly, and they will be missed. It is no fun to go back and forth.

A suggestion for other tourists, there are two roads going up the mountain. You have to take the newly built two-lane asphalt road to go up and down the mountain! ! !
Here's what happened: When going down the mountain, Baidu Maps automatically planned another old road (near the highway). Since I wasn't familiar with the local conditions, I followed it. At first, the first section was the same new road in front of the hotel, but as I drove it, it turned into a new road. We entered the cement road, and there were traces of rockfalls intermittently. About one kilometer in, a huge boulder lay across the middle of the road blocking the way. I immediately decided to retreat to the hotel fork, but as a result, I encountered vehicles parked randomly on the roadside and couldn't. We turned around and had to call the hotel to ask for help. They promptly sent someone to move the car. The housekeeper heard that it was us and brought an umbrella over to see if he needed help. It can be regarded as a safe return to the new road.
I also hope that the hotel can place ice cream cones or sign fences to inform tourists that this road is dangerous, instead of telling me that Baidu is wrong and this road has long been closed...scared! ! !

The overall stay experience was great. Received unanimous praise from all our colleagues.

The traffic conditions were very good along the way from Chengdu. Although the road up the mountain has many twists and turns, it is a well-maintained road and the road condition is very good. After arriving at the parking lot below the B&B, a sightseeing car from the B&B will come down to receive you and deliver it to the door of the B&B.

After registering in the lobby, the housekeeper came to receive you and sent you to the yard. The housekeeper's workshop is configured independently in each yard. It is an independent house, where the housekeeper cooks and rests. It not only guarantees companionship but also takes into account privacy, which is very good.

The meal that comes with it is delicious and the portions are generous. Every dish is fresh and delicious. It was a meal for the four of us. Because the four of us didn‚Äôt have big appetites and couldn‚Äôt finish it, we packed some away and didn‚Äôt want to waste it. Moreover, because it is an independent kitchen, the meal time can be discussed with the housekeeper, which is very flexible. Breakfast is freshly made by the aunt who comes to the yard in the morning. It is fresh and delicious. The porridge is freshly cooked and very fragrant. There is also a side dish that you can eat with your hands, which is great~

There is a machine in the independent yard. It is very new and clean. You can play whenever you want without worrying about disturbing other people. It is great.

The bedrooms in Courtyard No. 7 where we live are all on the second floor. After going up, we go directly to the left and right. They are not next to each other at all, so they don't disturb each other, and the privacy is very good.

Everything used is branded, and the quality is guaranteed.

When leaving the store, the housekeeper helped to pick up things and deliver them to the door. She was very warm and friendly.

The entire check-in experience was very good. I was not disturbed and could respond to my needs in a timely manner. This kind of service was just right. Thumbs up!

I will love the store so much againüëç

It's a very nice place. It's in the mountains. It's very quiet. It also has a small independent courtyard suitable for a few friends or a family. The two of us stayed in the tree house. The service staff was very good, and the food was very good, fresh, delicious and not expensive. It‚Äôs probably the most approachable and cost-effective dining experience among the 100 hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. Haha

msg:We decided to stay here for our birthday trip. Courtyard No. 6 can accommodate our group just right. Two large beds and a standard room are just right.
I have stayed in a lot of resort hotels and B&Bs. Let‚Äôs put it this way, if it were not more than three hours away from Chengdu, I would be willing to come here every month to take a break. Compared with Rushi, Thousand Miles Eye, and Zuowang in the suburbs, this one is better.
The best thing is that the a**osphere is great. The housekeeper in each villa is a local aunt. The cooking is really delicious, and the service is friendly and enthusiastic. It is not rigidly standardized, but more sincere.
The price-performance ratio is very high. The villa for 6 adults per night also includes breakfast, dinner and afternoon tea. I also ordered a barbecue late night snack and a lunch. The barbecue is charcoal grilled, the skewers are clean and hygienic, and the charcoal grill is super fragrant. The Yi cuisine for lunch was also delicious, and the local bamboo shoots and salt vegetables were great. The detail is that the green onions provided can be seen to be washed very finely and cleanly, which shows that they pay attention to quality.
Since the hotel is on a mountain, when it rains, mud flows into the pool. But I didn't plan to take a bath at first, so it wouldn't have much impact.
The road up the mountain is not that difficult, and the scenery along the way is nice. A hotel worth returning to. recommend

It is similar to the Bird's Nest Hotel in Sanya, but the room facilities are much newer. It was Halloween when I went there and I participated in hotel activities. The only problem was that there was no food nearby. , the hotel restaurant closed relatively early, I was very hungry at nightüò≠

The distant mountains, sunset, tea fields, and mist in the morning make it a perfect rural picture. What surprised me most was the butler, a local who was responsible for our meals and service. He was very enthusiastic. Thoughtful, good cooking skills, rich and delicious meals, meticulous attention to detail, makes you feel at home. Recommend everyone to experience it!

I really did not expect such a high-quality place in such a remote mountain. The No. 1 tree house I booked for the first time has a wide field of vision, super good air, and the interior furnishings are of good quality and detail. Immediately after I came, I booked the No. 5 tree house. Staying here for two days will completely release the soul, the staff are very simple and should be locals. The name Kashasha is said to mean thank you in Yi language. It is indeed a project created by China Travel Service, very good. This place is the most comfortable place I stayed in this vacation, and I will come again next time I have a chance. In addition, the food here is good, the vegetables used are very ecological. The sho-shou who delivered the breakfast must taste it, which is very distinctive.

It is better to teach people to fish than to teach them how to fish, which creates employment in the surrounding areas and boosts the tourism industry. It still feels like I've come to the right place.

The service in the hotel is very good, the young girl and the young man are very enthusiastic and positive. Help with things, accompany me to the mountains to pick tea, and accompany me to see fireflies at night.
The hardware condition is very good. The furniture is low-key and high-quality. Bathroom products: L'Occitane, passable. The price is right. Compared with the conditions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, the price starts at 3,000~~
If you want to reserve a tree house, you need to book it in advance. There are only four in total, and they are very popular.
Disadvantages: Traffic, the road up the mountain is quite winding, so don‚Äôt get motion sickness.
The Yi Autonomous County is too far away. I was exhausted after driving for three hours.
There are not many choices for food around. If you want to go down the mountain, you can go to a small restaurant to eat. The bean curd rice and the like are super delicious.

All in all, the children and the elders were very happy.

Birds are chirping in front of you, drinking afternoon tea and tasting the peanuts prepared by the hotel. It is very comfortable. The boss even gave it here. The green plum rice wine is very delicious. It's very suitable for three days of quiet time here. We live in tree house No. 1 with a great view, and tree house No. 5 has the best privacy. Thanks for the service of the hotel, let us make this trip worthwhile, and we will bring our family to visit again in the future.

In each villa, there is a local housekeeper who is responsible for three meals a day. The portions are sufficient and the taste is good.

This time I took photos and checked in with my sisters. It was really relaxing and happy.

A meal costs 50 yuan per person. The food is also delicious. No pitfalls throughout.

We booked the courtyard on the first floor, which has two bedrooms, living room and dining room. The courtyard has an outdoor massage pool, which is very spacious.

The room is equipped with floor heating and air conditioning, making it very warm. The design is simple and warm, the cleaning is very clean, and the supplies are large bottles of L'Occitane.

The butler's service was also very good, taking us around for walks and sightseeing.

The only fly in the oin**ent is that the road up the mountain is currently difficult to drive. The main road is currently being built. After the completion in March next year, the road conditions up the mountain should be improved a lot.

Hope to have the opportunity to come again in the future ~

msg:Personally, I have very high expectations for this trip. Although this store has a very high price on New Year's Day... I still drove my friends for more than 3 hours to come here. How can I put it, there are many unreasonable things.

First of all, the booking cost a total of 5k+. I will measure this B&B according to this standard.

üçÉEnvironment: The environment is not high in the mountains. The altitude is only 900+. The surrounding areas and roads are relatively... In the development, it is a bit troublesome to miss the wrong car. There are many wrong cars on this section of the road.

üîîService: The service staff are indeed very polite and nice, but the front desk staff are not proactive. We took the initiative to ask about New Year's Day activities, but they were not proactive. We only asked the aunt for afternoon tea.
Since it is called a resort, no one introduced the facilities, and no one took the initiative to communicate some important issues that need to be informed in advance.
Kashasha's water heater runs out of hot water after 8-10 minutes and has to wait for half an hour. You are letting unsuspecting guests take a bath and the water gradually becomes cold. This... Since it is a water storage type, don't use it. The shower head is so large, and the water is relatively cold in winter, so the hot water supply cannot keep up.

Then, although dinner is included, you can inform the guests that if they need other dishes, they can order them a la carte. Special dishes, bacon and sausages can be made by the kitchen for an additional fee. The guests will definitely accept it. For a big holiday, the only food is shredded pork with green pepper‚ûï 0Salt chicken soup, other vegetarian options, for a large table of people, they will definitely be full, but...
Let us know early and we will definitely order in advance.
It is called a resort, but there are no supporting entertainment facilities (I asked and was told that I can only come at night to listen to Yi singers singing), so it can hardly be called a vacation.
The cost is 5k, but in fact the room is very ordinary inside and outside. The floor heating is strong, the hot water is not strong, it is very boring, and the overall experience is not very good.
I didn't take the initiative to place the order at the end of the checkout, and kept urging me to check out in the morning.

The price/performance ratio is low, the management is not systematic and professional, there is no need to come here specially...
The summary is that it is not necessary.

Third, the housekeeper aunt is very kind and cooks deliciously.

However, the first impression of the shop was not good. The front desk staff was not professional enough, lacking energy, and did not feel the enthusiasm that the resort service should have. Then they did not communicate well internally, which caused my problem to not be resolved.
