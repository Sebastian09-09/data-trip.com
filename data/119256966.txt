msg:The hotel is newly opened and is completely unprepared. It is marked as five diamonds on the platform, but it is only three diamonds. I hope the platform can strictly review and correct it in time.
There are no other supporting facilities except the breakfast room and gym;
The sheets and bedding were obviously not washed often enough, and I quickly became allergic when I put them on my body. I immediately changed hotels the next day.

msg:This is my first time staying at the Four Points by Sheraton. I have heard of it before as a hotel brand owned by Marriott. The experience was really great.
We arrived at the hotel at around 2 o'clock in the morning. We parked our car directly in the parking lot next to it, and then we went up to the lobby in the elevator. There was also a handsome guy in the lobby. I made a reservation in advance and got my room card within one minute after handing over my ID card. Service was provided with a smile throughout the process. It’s really convenient and allows me to go to sleep quickly👍
When I woke up the next day and took a photo of the room, I found that the room was very atmospheric, with plenty of storage space and not too crowded. The overall design was very youthful, and you could even sit down and take a shower in the bathroom. Can you bear this? Then I went to the breakfast room to have breakfast. The variety was very rich among the hotels I have ever eaten in. The ingredients were fresh and the soy milk and coffee were delicious. It's a pity that I didn't have time to taste the craft beer. Friends who come to stay in the future should not miss it ~

msg:A very satisfying experience. Because I was not sure about the itinerary, I only booked a hotel for one day. When we wanted to extend our stay the next day, we found that the hotel was full and we had to wait for other people to check out before we could extend our stay. Calvin from the front office helped us deal with this problem in a timely manner. We also encountered some minor troubles during the period and solved them in time. Yes, very satisfied!

The hotel lobby is too small, the elevator lobby and restaurant entrances and exits are too narrow, the garage entrance is too trashy, the elevator buttons don't light up, and the tone is too different from the Sheraton. The space and facilities in the room are satisfactory. The minibar and refrigerator are just decorations.

Since the hotel had just opened, the handsome guy at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade our room, which was great (as shown in the picture). The room price is very cost-effective. I will go there next time.

The front desk was unprofessional and told me that she didn't want to leave a phone number. She also repeatedly emphasized that the phone number was for balabala. The overall experience was very bad.
