It is inside the scenic spot so very convenient to walk around and see the sights. Definitely recommend this hotel. 

There was a large pool but was empty on our visit. I suspect in the summer time it would be a great spot to escape the heat overlooking the lake.

msg:Gubei Water Town, on a sun-baked day, there are few snacks and many inns and restaurants, many of which are not very tasty. It is better to fill your stomach with snacks. There is a dumpling restaurant on the road to Huotang Hotel. I forgot to call it. What, it‚Äôs hand-wrapped, the vegetarian dishes have no flavor, the pork, chives and signature dishes are all okay.
Living in Wangjing Tower, no one swims in the outdoor swimming pool. The scenery is good, but there are many floating objects on the pool surface. The lobby service will also remind you that the water is very cold, so don't go.
The hotel service is very good and responsive to all requests. The room is very large. At 65 square meters, it is almost as big as a suite.
The hotel provides two free hot spring tickets. Duanjia Hot Spring and Yushe Hot Spring, the only three hot springs in Gubei, are right at the entrance of Wangjing Tower. You can go directly in a bathrobe without booking a locker two hours in advance.
In addition, the night tour of the Great Wall opens at 6 o'clock, and the entrance is also at the entrance of Wangjing Tower, which is very convenient. However, there is a performance in Gubei Square at 8:30, so you have to weigh it [face covering]
It is best to take the entire cruise from both ends, as half the journey is too much.
In addition to free tickets, hot spring tickets, and shuttle buses when you stay at a hotel in the scenic area, you can also get a 40% discount on cruise tickets and Great Wall tickets when you buy a cruise ship, and you can get on the shuttle bus first.
I didn‚Äôt take any photos of the hotel, it‚Äôs no different from the business photos.

After checking in at the tourist service center, it only takes a few minutes for Baidu to reach the hotel. You can take Baidu cars at will; the front desk service is enthusiastic, and they actively help with luggage. The room is European-style design, the room is very beautiful, and it is the color I like. The bathroom is large, with dry and wet separation, and there is a large round bathtub. It is the first time I live on the first floor when I go out to play in a hotel. I can't see the scenery outside the window. It seems that I still have to live on the high floor with a viewing balcony. The room has direct drinking water, a small pool, and it is very convenient to wash fruits and cups. There is also a coffee machine and purified water (coffee, water, and fruit are all free). The bed is very large, and a hot spring ticket is given, but I didn't experience it; there is a small courtyard in the hotel, and the magnolia and lilac are blooming, as well as a swing chair and places to pay attention to; the hotel restaurant is in a good location, you can see the Mandarin Duck Lake outside through the glass window, and you can also dine at the open-air tables and chairs outside, listen to the gurgling water, bathe in the morning sunshine, and enjoy the beautiful breakfast. The breakfast is also very rich and very comfortable to eat üòå, if you want to climb the Great Wall, it is recommended to stay

First of all, the mountain view balcony room facing the swimming pool has a beautiful scenery outside the window, with birds singing and the fragrance of flowers. The indoor space is large enough to dance. The elegant decoration design with French white background makes it comfortable even if you stay in the room all day making capsule coffee with the beautiful scenery outside. Very laid back and comfortable. Both room types are designed in European style and are equipped with large bathtubs. It is highly recommended to stay here. There is a hidden gourmet restaurant in this hotel. Not only the mountains and rivers blend outside the window, but the waiters are enthusiastic and positive. The best thing is that the Shandong cuisine cooked by the Shandong chef is very delicious and amazing. I highly recommend travelers to try it here.

Gubei Light has 1.2 double beds or 1.8 large beds, which is suitable for family rooms. It is too expensive during the Spring Festival, so I just choose it. Looking at Wangjing Tower, Gubei Light is only one to two hundred meters away from Wangjing Tower, which takes three to five minutes to walk.
The hotel service is very good, including fruits and desserts.
The disadvantage is that I wish there could be more children's toys and facilities.

This is my first time staying at Wangjing Tower. The overall feeling is good. The room is large and has a large round bathtub. The hotel is very quiet and clean. The variety of breakfast is slightly less than that of other pure hotel buffets, but the main ones are included. The location is almost in the northernmost part of Water Town, very close to Wangjing Street. If you stay in Wangjing Tower, you can go to Yushe Hot Spring next door for free. Reservations are not available. When we went to soak, there was no one else and it was like a private bath. It was very quiet and comfortable. The overall feeling is that the environment is somewhere between typical hotels like Gubei Light and Water Town Hotel and other inns. It is somewhat similar to Edgar, and the location is more convenient than Hangu Villa. It is recommended for family travel.

msg:Superior double room facilities: The room is very large and spacious, and the bed is also very large. Two people can't touch each other while sleeping, and the bedding is quite comfortable. The room is very hygienic and the facilities are well maintained. It's nice to have a double bathtub. , the hotel can provide disposable bathtub covers, which is more hygienic; there is a capsule coffee machine, free fruit, turndown service, and a few cookies, which feels quite warm; the hotel's room service staff and front desk The little girls have a very good service attitude and good service awareness. They can also help call the shuttle bus when leaving, which is very convenient for getting out of the scenic spot.

Disadvantages: The hotel's breakfast is not rich in variety, and the quality is not very good. It can only be equivalent to the level of a three-star hotel in the city. This is the third boutique hotel I have stayed in Gubei. The breakfast at Wangjing Tower is the first one I have stayed in. The most average of boutique hotels and really needs improvement.

We booked them together at first, but then I saw that they only got two tickets and two hot spring tickets, so I canceled one room and booked another room. Actually, it was okay. I made a mistake. If you book together, you will get four tickets for free. This hotel is great. Please refer to the previous review for details.

The breakfast is very rich, and the package provided includes Chinese and Western food, but the style you prefer can be added indefinitely. The hot spring coupons given in the room card can go to the Yushe Hotel diagonally opposite the hotel (not open to individual guests). Maybe you go there on weekdays. You can only enjoy the open-air hot spring pool for yourself during the whole hot spring bath.

I have never stayed in an ordinary inn, but I recommend you to try it. It may be more cost-effective. Personally, the price of boutique hotels is inflated and not worth the price. Eleven hours of self-driving, just lying in bed and resting, I felt a foreign object crawling on my body. Fortunately, I was agile and caught it alive, whether it was a cockroach or a flying insect.

The room facilities and equipment are very good, and they are big enough, especially the service staff is really good. We Taking the baby back to the hotel for a stroll at night, I found that there were small cakes and honey grapefruit tea in the room, which made people feel warm in the cold winter. The next day we continued to live temporarily, but changed to Niancheng on the mountain. Although the room is bigger and the scenery is not bad, the overall feeling is that Wangjing Building is better, both in terms of location and service.

msg:In the last month of 2022, people across the country are almost immersed in the state of sheep and sheep. . . The first thing after Yang Kang, of course, is to go out to have a good time [naughty] New Year's Day, and my baby's online (open book) final exam is also over, so I chose a place for New Year's Eve, and finally decided on Gubei Water Town. The last time I came was five or six years ago in midsummer, this time I came to see the water town in winter. Last time I stayed in Gubei Light, this time I fell in love with Wangjing Tower. The big round bathtub successfully attracted my son's attention, and it has a huge area. Of course, the price of 2,510 nights is indeed not cheap (the usual hotel, Generally, the range of 1,500 to 2,000 is chosen. This time the price/performance ratio feels a little lower, but if you look at it as the time of New Year‚Äôs Eve, it is acceptable, after all, two tickets and a hot spring ticket are given away). The specific room is as shown in the picture below, not much to say, the bathtub is oversized, the bed is oversized, the area is not small, and welcome fruits are given. Just talk about the shortcomings, or suggestions: 1. There is no late check-out, but it is probably because the occupancy rate is high the next day. 2. The room was not upgraded. In fact, the room was not full that day, but the floor was not upgraded, which is a pity. 3. Although the bathtub is big, it is very cold, and the windows always feel air leakage. 4. The room is too hot in winter, the air conditioner is too dry, static electricity is all over my body, my hair is flying up, and the L'Occitane conditioner that comes with it is not good at all [embarrassing] 5. The free hot spring tickets are 2, just because I am not feeling well, My son and my father went together. I chose the Royal House next to it. There are few people, just the two of them, but the place is small, and my baby thinks it‚Äôs boring. I should choose the Duan‚Äôs compound below. 6. There are few types of breakfast, a Chinese-style set meal, and some leftovers are optional. My baby is nine years old, and I bought half price separately.

I called and talked to the front desk, but the front desk had no choice but to tell me to open the windows, but it is so cold in the mountains in winter, and I dare not open the windows, so the temperature still can't drop; 2.

The hotel service staff is warm, thoughtful and careful, so that you can feel the carefree play in the water town to the greatest extent. At the beginning, I was worried that the hotel would be inconvenient in the innermost part of the water town. Not only did I have no worries after checking in, but I felt that the hotel has the best location in Water Town, bar none. There is a shuttle bus from the visitor center to the door of the hotel. After a day of fun, it is very pleasant to sit on the balcony at night, listening to the sound of running water and watching the night view of the Great Wall not far away. Next to the hotel is the entrance of the Great Wall and the wharf. Before climbing the Great Wall the next day, I checked my luggage to the No. 1 parking lot. The hotel breakfast is very rich, and it is okay to brush the Great Wall twice in the morning with a rich breakfast hahahaha.

Opposite the hotel is Yushe Hot Spring, which is very convenient. Probably the only downside is that the hotel's breakfast is not buffet.

The room is large and the bedding is of surprisingly good quality. The furniture does have some normal wear and tear, which is acceptable. The bathtub and shower room are a bit fun, suitable for couples, the kind that can be unlocked and made up.

There is a beautiful infinity outdoor pool, a plus. You can see the Great Wall in the distance.

The breakfast is so-so, nothing to eat.

After moving in, the balcony is very, very small, two people can't sit down, and the balcony is open-air, if it rains, you can only see the scenery from the room window, and the room window is even more pitiful.

As soon as I entered the room, two male waiters were tidying up, one was in the bathroom and the other was making the bed. The following pictures are the pictures I took after cleaning the room. Is this level of room cleaning for a night of 3000+? The hair dryer was not in place, the vanity mirror light was still on, the washbasin was not neatly arranged, the cups on the water bar were not cleaned and not put in the cabinet, we brought the child and added a quilt, and then folded it as shown in the picture below, a hotel in the 1970s ? Food scraps are still on the ground! The bath towel was not replaced, it was just folded and placed next to the bathtub, I forgot to take a photo! To sum up, cleaning is to take out the garbage, put mineral water, do some surface, even the ground is not swept! Ctrip's first evaluation, it's so speechless!

Saying you check in before 3pm will definitely not make you 20 minutes early. Said 12 noon check out can not be delayed 1 second. The breakfast is extremely poor, it is the kind of buns and noodles that go to the hotel in the small county town. Is the service is very good, the waiters are very polite. Later, I thought about it and understood why it was not allowed to check in before three o'clock. Because there is nothing special in this ancient town before three o'clock. So everyone go late. Better to arrive at 5 or 6. Do not book breakfast if you can. Because you don't even get up to eat. Especially people who drink at night or who's late.

msg:It‚Äôs great. I gave us the nearest balcony room, next to the imperial house and Duan‚Äôs house, overlooking their hot spring pool, and the whole view of the Great Wall and the town. In winter, the water in the outdoor swimming pool is drained, so it‚Äôs close. The balcony room over there has nothing to look at except for the Great Wall, but it is more interesting here. The outdoor pool of the Duan's family seems to be more abundant. The outdoor pool of the Imperial House has two small pools without lights. They are dark and the temperature of the water is low, but the indoor pool is large and warm. The breakfast is a little bit small, but it's good enough. The bed is big and comfortable, the bathtub is also super, super big, just a little expensive bubble bath, haha
The service staff is very good, and it is convenient to call a taxi. In short, I am very satisfied!

msg:There are many inns in Gubei Water Town, but there are only a few hotels. The hotels in the water town are all located in places that can be reached by shuttle bus. If you choose an inn, you have to find it on foot, because the inns are located in different corners of the water town. Inside, is an integral part of the water town landscape. Wangjinglou Hotel is in the innermost part of the water town, and the surrounding environment is relatively quiet. However, there is a small waterfall outside the hotel. If the room is close to the waterfall, it may be a little noisy, and the effect of closing the windows and doors will not be great. If you want to shoot At the Great Wall of Night, it is recommended to live in a room with a balcony on the third floor. The hotel is very close to the entrance of the Great Wall, just a few minutes walk. The staff at the hotel have a very good service attitude. We told the front desk that there were not enough coffee capsules in the room, and the staff delivered them immediately, and they would give them more every day for the next few days. There were also snacks and fruits every day, because it was when we checked in in the mountainous area. The young lady at the front desk told us that there may be bugs in the room and there are card reminders in the room, but they are all bugs that do not bite people. The bugs we saw are stinkbugs, because there is nothing terrible to deal with, if you compare Mind if you can let the staff handle it for you. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western. It is a set meal and not a buffet, but if you don‚Äôt have enough food, you can ask the staff to add it at any time. It is not a problem to eat. The hot spring ticket provided by the hotel can be used in the Duanjia, Chengshang and Yushe hot springs, but the first two are for individual guests and residents. The Yushe is not open to individual guests and only open to guests staying in the Yushe and Wangjing Tower. , So there will be relatively few people, although not big, but very quiet. My family and I were very satisfied with the staying experience this time. If you have to make some comments, the toilet is a bit old and there seems to be no exhaust in the bathroom. Besides, the floor of the room we stayed in is always loud when stepping on it. Others are really good. not bad. Upload a picture of the Great Wall at Night taken on the balcony of our staying room for your reference.

Gubei Water Town is great as a whole, and I want to go there. The drone show was shocking. It's just that there are less food, and the delicious ones are expensive.
Other tips: Don't go to the roasted meat restaurant in the small town. If you step on the thunder, the roasted meat is fat and oily, and it's disgusting when you think of it.

msg:Backed by the Simatai Great Wall, the decoration is gorgeous and retro. I ordered a deluxe balcony room, and I took my mother on a trip. I look at the balcony on the second floor on Ctrip, but when I checked in, I arranged a pool balcony on the first floor without asking me. In fact, there is a step with a chair on it, which is shared with the next room. Private, swimmers can see the room unless the curtains are closed. Taking a nap will also be noisy by swimmers outside. So my mother didn't sleep well in the afternoon. She wanted to change the room, but she said that she should stay for one night and don't bother. In fact, this room is not bad. It is suitable for tourists with children, but I think it is not suitable for elderly people. The privacy is poor and a bit noisy. Gubei is good, but the reservation center communicates very slowly or not attentively every time. It does not seem to be afraid of bad reviews, and there is no shortage of guests. Let's be honest, let's take a detour for those who take the elderly to play.

msg:I have stayed in many large and small hotels in Gubei. This time I wanted to climb the Simatai Great Wall at night, so I chose Wangjing Tower, which is closer to the Great Wall. During the epidemic, it is summer vacation, and off-peak working days are not particularly cheap.

üóÑüìïüìí first advantages:
1. The room is relatively large and the decoration is very old. The 2.2-meter bed is very high for a family of three.
2. The location is close to the inside and not close to the main road. It is relatively quiet and will not be woken up by tourists early in the morning.
3. The room front desk service is good, because there are not many rooms, you can basically be there on call if you need it, which is more efficient than other hotels. You can check your luggage to the visitor center when you check out, so you can relax after checking out.
4. The swimming pool is beautiful, the room is free of hot spring tickets, and the hot spring in the city is 200 meters away, which is very convenient.
4. Next to the Great Wall and the upstream cruise ship port

üìóüìòüìô A few shortcomings of fault finding:
1. The wooden floor of the room is old or has been soaked, empty, and it is a bit cautious to walk crunchy.
2. The curtain of the bathtub in the room is broken, because it can't be covered completely, so I didn't dare to soak in the bath for fear of leaving it out.

In short, it will be better if it should be repaired regularly. Overall it is good.

msg:This time I chose Wangjing to stay. During the main epidemic period, there were fewer people living, and there was a balcony where I could sit down and take a look at the scenery. The swimming pool can be opened when there are not many people, but the groundwater in the mountains is too cold. Lying on the edge of the pool and looking at the Great Wall in the distance is a unique place in Wangjing. The breakfast is also good, and the service has a five-star standard. This balcony is a bit shabby, a space for one person. My wife doesn‚Äôt like the anti-aging European-style furniture here. I guess it‚Äôs a bit gloomy in the off-season. I will come back next time.

The hot spring ticket sent can go to the imperial house opposite, with few people and a good environment.
The only downside is that the breakfast variety is not rich enough, after all, there are only 33 rooms in total.

Therefore, when the front desk asks things, the service staff is at the low place and the guests are at the high place. The design is particularly interesting. The restaurant is also very user-friendly. At breakfast, I said I was too lazy to get coffee, and the staff next to me immediately said she would help me get it. The swimming pool is open-air, a bit cool, not as good as the indoor constant temperature for long-term travel, but the scenery is good, and the big waterfall next to the restaurant is a highlight.
