Positives:
- Comfortable bed with pillow menu (beds are not the typical rock hard Chinese beds)
- balcony comes with grand ocean view
- huge, impressive standalone bathtub
- one time complimentary mini bar (4 non alcoholic drinks)
- toiletries include hair conditioner (not a given in many Chinese hotels)
- tv comes with international channels
-  bedside usb and usb c charging

Negatives
- no electronic blinds/curtains
- balcony has no fan
- housekeeping could be more responsive 
- service was good but but exceptional (staff could have made more small talk and take more initiative to ask guests)
- hotel and room decor lacked the individuality and creativity one comes to expect from a Pullman hotel

msg:First of all, I’m really thanks to Eva❤️
I was arrived at hotel early after checked out another hotel. I didn’t expected to take early check in but Eva told me it’s already ready to check in so we could enter the room early.
She was really amazing friend. I am Korean so I’ve being had a hard time traveling China because of language. She helped me by We-chat app and fluent English and I could get lots of information easy.
And she gave me the coupon which is taking snap photos free(until 5photos. if you want to choose more you have to pay extra charge.) A photographer was nice, he taught my mom and me how to pose it was very comfy. we bought extra photos. 
And I booked a shuttle bus to cdf mall at 15:00, so I was worried about killing time until 15:00. So I asked her how to get a late check out, she gave me a free late check out until that time. I think she is an angel🧚.

And Actually pullman hotel is deserve to take 5stars.
Everyone is smiling and kind, system is comfy and safety. Even You can take room cleaning when you want( I mean you can choose the time.)

And I booked a room with breakfast that buffet was quite good. Especially I was in love with coconut bread,,, I really wanted to wrap it in my bag👍

I want to say about pools.
There are 4 pools. The one is for only swimming and the depth is 1.5m and I estimate the length is 40m.
It seems like infinity pools.
And there is the slides that was quite fun for me🌝

And pullman has the tunnel between hotel and beach you can go to the beach very easily and also use the sun beds and towels free(there are Pullman crews). This beach is public but you could feel private.

웰컴 프루츠도 주고 웰컴팔찌도 줍니다
테니스 코트 대여랑 강습도 가능 하지만 구경못했습니다
피트니스24시간 가능
공짜 스냅사진 5장 잘찍어주고 보정도 잘해줌
위챗으로 궁금한거 물어보면되서 매우 편리
그리고 체크아웃 후에 체인징룸이랑 샤워실있으니 물놀이 더하셔도 됩니다!
아 싼야베이는 수영이 안돼요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그치만 물에 드가는건 가능! 발담구고 파도 좀 타는거,, 대동해 야롱베이 다갔다왔는데 별거없더라고요 리조트만 보고 선택하면 됩니다 바다로 바로갈수있는 터널 진짜 만족👍👍👍
단점은 냉장고 크기가 작아서 음료몇개밖에 못넣는다는것,,?
조식은 메뉴가 많지는 않지만 서양식 좋아한다면 괜찮음.

msg:What a lovely stay in the quite apartment tower of Pullman Ocean View. Thanks to Lisa and Jason Ma who sorted out my booking mistakes and took care of all our requests. We were so satisfied, that we‘re staying a few days more. 
The breakfast buffet is rich with a lot of choices, both Chinese and Western. The beach is well accessible and there are even sun beds. There are a lot of pools with very attentive life guards. Feels very safe even if a lot of kids are playing in the water. 
Thanks to Eva who helped us book a few more days.

msg:I booked an executive level ocean view room at the Sanya Pullman and it was just lovely.  I stayed 9 nights and never wanted to leave.  I had great views of the ocean and pools.  It was very relaxing to sit out on the balcony.  The thermostat worked, so we had great air conditioning, which I've struggled with at other hotels in China.  The pool bar was quiet, even though it was a holiday, and we received excellent service in English.  I used the gym every day and they provided water and fruit there.  The equipment was in good condition - I used the treadmill and weights.  I received great support and service from the manager, Eva, throughout my stay.  She sent me the restaurant and water park operating times, shuttle bus information, helped me arrange a spa visit for multiple guests at once (I heard many comments it was the best massage they'd ever had, and also provided me with recommendations to local businesses.  She even helped me when I wasn't home in time for a delivery.  The hotel was very accommodating to provide a room during the May holiday when one of my friend's flights was unexpectedly cancelled - the same room they had was requested, and they were able to accommodate that.  I will be back!

Especially want to thanks Eva, for her attitude and care! My children were touched by her little gifts when we left.

Our recent stay at The Pullman Sanya Bay was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with fantastic service that set the tone for a memorable experience. The staff, especially Barry at the reception area, went above and beyond to ensure our check-in process was smooth and hassle-free. Barry's attention to detail and willingness to assist us with any questions or requests made us feel truly valued as guests.

The hotel's dining options exceeded our expectations, with the food being of excellent quality and offered at great prices. We particularly enjoyed our meals at the Sands restaurant, where Leila provided us with outstanding service. Her friendly demeanor and quick response to our needs added to the overall positive experience.

The facilities at The Pullman Sanya Bay are truly impressive and unmatched. The tunnel leading to the beach was a unique feature that we appreciated, allowing us easy access to the beautiful shoreline. The hotel's atmosphere was inviting and family-friendly, making it the perfect choice for our vacation.

One standout moment was when our family arrived earlier than expected, and Barry ensured that we could get into our room promptly to rest. He even surprised us with a family upgrade, exceeding any service we have received at other hotels. Barry's dedication to ensuring our comfort and satisfaction did not go unnoticed, and we are grateful for his exceptional service.

Overall, The Pullman Sanya Bay has become our go-to hotel when visiting Sanya Bay. The great atmosphere, daily events, and family-friendly environment make it a top choice for travelers seeking a relaxing and enjoyable stay. Thank you to the entire team at The Pullman Sanya Bay for making our time there truly. See you all soon!🌺

msg:Very nice hotel, but one which is starting to show its age - furniture is old, chipped etc - but room was spacious and clean. Service could be better - few of the staff looked miserable and not many spoke any English. Lack of amenities in the room (eg razors, USB charging sockets etc) slightly disappointing. The pools are nice and the open air dining options are great. Easy access to the beach, but lack of shopping/dining options within walking distance of the hotel. Overall a decent option in Sanya - would consider staying again.

As french travelers, we wanted an hotel where we can eat western food and the food was perfect for us during our stay 😍 The breakfast buffet was very cool too for the price, we ate lot of good western things !

I recommend the hotel for all the activities, the location, the sea, the pools, the big rooms, we love it 😍

Negatives: the room was dirty, the sheets and towels even after requesting the change were dirty.
The pool water was dirty and the towels provided in the pool had brown stains.
I suppose the laundry department has some serious cleanliness problem (maybe the filters are dirty?)
Manteinance work was carried out 2 meters from the pool for 2 days. I went to Sanya to breathe sea air and not smell of diesel! Why manteinance operation can not be done before National holidays or later when the tourists are not so much?
Management can not handle the problems mentioned above, can only ask sorry.
We had lunch in their restaurant before our departure and we have to wait 45 minutes for 1 burger, 1 grilled salmon and 1 rice even if the restaurant was almost empty.
Experience to forget as soon as possible.

They go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible, especially Shirley, who very quickly helped clear up a misunderstanding/miscommunication at check in.  My room was also very quickly changed and upgraded when I was not happy with the smoke smell in the initial room assigned to me.  The view from my first room was great, but the view from the upgrade was amazing.  Shirley continued to provide excellent customer service throughout my stay and were ready to assist at the drop of a hat.  The hotel is relatively close to the airport and about 18 minutes drive from Sanya Railway station.   It’s a hop away from the beach and about 30 minutes drive from Dadonghai. Despite the busyness of the hotel and the little misunderstanding when I arrived, check-in was quite smooth and swift.  The facilities are great and many activities for adults and children alike.    I would highly recommend a stay here.

msg:Second time at the Pullman Oceanview and a second fantastic experience. Close enough to the airport to be convenient, far enough you never hear a plane. Very clean and accommodating (we moved to a room two doors down for a better view). The pools and garden are beautiful and private, and the beach is just across the street (same as for all hotels on this stretch of beach). However, the Oceanview has a private tunnel to their beach and you can order coconuts and snacks to your lounge chair on the beach (or Waimai for better prices and more options, but the drivers are not as good as in big cities). 

Only thing lacking was vegan dining choices - very little in the room service and dinner buffet. Breakfast buffet included with the room was still worth it, but definitely could have more choices (Oatly in the drinks, a Zrou or Beyond option, more breads/noodles without egg or milk).

What made it extra special this time was the service of Perou Zhang, who welcomed me warmly and made a lot of special effort to make sure my stay was perfect. She kindly upgraded me from a 5th floor garden view room to a 10th floor spectacular sea view room on the 2nd day after I noticed there was sand in my bed on the 1st night and no hair dryer in the room. I wasn't expecting this and it was really special to receive such a treat! She also checked in with me every morning to see if I needed anything. She helped to move my bags and brought fruit to my room. Really exceptional service. Thank you so much Perou! 
Additionally, the staff at the outside restaurant and pool bar (especially Eric and Dean) were super friendly and accommodating as always, serving me amazing drinks, cocktails always with a warm and friendly attitude. Thank you everyone. Thank you Pullman! It was a wonderful stay and I will return again!

msg:I really enjoyed my stay at Pullman. My room was nice, but I did have a terrible view of a tree and a water slide, which blocked all the natural light entering the room so it was pretty dark all the time. Other than that, everything else was great! The staff were so kind and welcoming! Especially Sara, who was really helpful with the language barrier I had at times. She also provided me with a welcome fruit and cake package, which was really thoughtful! The beachfront was my favourite part. Being able to order food and beverages directly from the hotel to the beach, was the incredible. Overall. I would definitely stay there again! Excellent hotel!

The hotel itself is really nice but a little run down.
Some renovations should be done. Pool area and Beach are nice as well, unfortunately a part of pool was under construction.

Special thanks to Perou Zhang who has been extremely welcoming and supportive to help any time, the best service I’ve experienced in Sanya so far. Great rooms, food, beach, heated pool during the winter time which saves your vacation if the sun isn’t out, and their SPA is also on point. Amy is a professional in massages and facials, it was a good experience. 10 out of 10 and most definitely recommend!

We love going to the poolside BBQ at night where all family can enjoy eating seafood or meat. Access to the beach is easy, but the jet skiers are right by the beachfront, which I do not enjoy at all. One morning, they didn't have beach towels at the both beachside and poolside, which was very inconvenient. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay very much.

The Perks:
1) The Western breakfast was delicious.
2) Kind and helpful staff.
3) The rooms, bathroom and balcony view were wonderful! Especially the bathtub!
4) There are 2 giant pools for swimming and one has a swim up bar!
5) The beach is within walking distance and clean. - Sadly the locals are around selling toys for kids and fruit so they can be loud at times. - You can swim in the ocean.
6) You can order food and drinks on the beach and it will get delivered to you within 30mins.
7) There is Covid testing at the hotel from 9-10am.
8) Close to city life.
9) 7-10min ride to the airport.

Some things I didn’t enjoy:
1) The loud families on my floors. 
2) The locals roaming on the beach.
3) The check-in and out lines are too slow.

Would I come back there again? Yes!

msg:The Pullman Hotel was a good choice for us as family and provided us with a good time. We (5 people) have enjoyed the family suite including breakfast. The price of the Pullman is higher than other hotels in the Sanya Bay Area but the quality of the stay is also in general quite good. Especially the pool area is nice (one pool was closed). You get towels at the beach and at the pools which is nice. The infinity pool is great and the hotel has a private underpass to the beach. Indoor playground and trampoline are free of charge. The breakfast was also quite good in quality and variety - the coffee was great. 

Some negative points are:
- the staff at the breakfast was sometimes very sleepy and slow. The coffee machine needed service and the guy was standing next to it and ignored it until you mentioned it to him. Same for tables outside.
- the general room cleanliness was good but some areas should have got better cleaning when people move in (fridge & sink). 
- the service at the pool was quite slow. For some fries at the pool we needed to wait about 30 minutes. 
- it’s a pity that the hotel is right next to a large helicopter base; you will have the sound most of the days and also often until late evenings; inside the rooms it’s not a problem but it’s annoying when you are at the beach, bar or pool.
- the beach was not supervised, it has always been red flagged for no reason

It’s also just a short drive to a lot of local restaurants. The beach is public, but the hotel has their own area with good lounge chairs. The public beach has some benefits like people offering low priced fruits, fresh coconuts, etc. Their customer service is also very good and unusually personal for a large resort - Eva was an amazing host helping with anything we needed. Great value in Sanya and highly recommend it.

msg:The hotel had impeccable service. It was up to standard with international hotels. The downside is the guests who are absolutely oblivious and lack any sense of manors. I understand the hotel cannot change guests but there must be a policy about noise as the guests in the hotel are extremely noisy. For example we had to move twice due to hotel guests making so much noise at night. Instead of dealing with the issue of noise coming from those guests we were told to move to a new room which we had to pack our bags and move as late as 12 30 am. Apart from extremely noisy children and adults the hotel is amazing. Just hope in future there is a policy to help relieve this problem. I would recommend this hotel to guests with a family but it's definitely not for resting or relaxing due to external factors which make the whole experience unbearable.

We ended up trying the afternoon tea and happy hour offerings as well, it was a nice treat and made the stay extra convenient and relaxing. The amenities were great, our room was on the 15th floor with the ocean view. The breakfast offering was wonderful, so many different cuisines to choose from. The beach access was also super convenient with the private underpass from the hotel. I would highly recommend staying here, it was also really convenient to find a covid testing site in the city, which was like 10minute car ride from the hotel.

The pools were extensive and even though the hotel was highly booked up it never felt busy by the pools. Always managed to find a spot to hang out for the day. 

The rooms are decently sized. I like that the bathtub has a clear line of ocean views. I would recommend if you book an ocean view room you request above Floor 7. We stayed on Floor 6 and although there is still a view it's mainly tree tops. My friend was on floor 7 and his view was a lot more clear. I would also recommend a sunset cocktail in the rooftop bar.

msg:A very good girl and as conveniently located as you can get in Sanya. There are a few things writhing walking distance (local restaurants and beach promenade) but more just a Didi ride away. Everything in Sanya is a Didi ride away, and having stayed on Haitou and Yalong bay, this is probably our favourite. Houhai had lots more close by, but this is more of a place to relax. Great pools! Although the staff didn't have much English, they went above and beyond to help us with translation apps. Also, a cheeky little 17th floor free flow and snacks from 5 til 7 for 188.

msg:Pullman Hotel was everything I needed in my stay in Sanya. Location is great and very close to the airport and near the beach. I say near the beach because you do gave to go under a tunnel to get to the beach because of a street in between the hotel and beach but not a big deal. Service was great and all the staff were kind and friendly. The best part for me was the food. You tend to go high end hotels and the food is pretty basic, but at the Pullman I was really surprised. All of the food I tried was fantastic! Sands burger, chicken sandwich, chicken wrap, and the curry’s were delicious! The gym was nice and the always have a small sauna in the locker room. Only downfall I would say (maybe not even a downfall if the weather was super hot) but the resort is covered with trees. Very shaded areas covering the pools, so if it’s really sunny, I still fee the pools will never get warm. They also have a private beach area as well. Get there early if you want to get seat on the beach. Overall my stay was great and definitely would go back.

The staff is as lovely and always ready to help. Vivian have us a warm welcome on the reception and was alway available to help us with any concerns. The only thing needs to be improved is a dinner buffet- very very bad quality food is served . We also took a new year Eve dinner and it was such a waste of money ! The food just wasn’t tasty !  The restaurant a la carte is quite good and has a variety of food. If you get tired there is a nice Italian restaurant 15 minutes biking . Beside this I cannot wait to be there again- it was a very nice stay !

msg:Definitely more of a family hotel, loads for kids to do. We traveled as a couple and although the hotel was lovely, it was very kid orientated. (Expected during summer holidays of course) There were lots of pools but non of which were ‘adult only’ which got a little annoying after a while. 
Breakfast was good. So much choice, both western and eastern. It got very busy from 8-10am so go early or late if you want to avoid the rush. The lady manger was great. We didn’t get her name but she was very helpful and attentive, given that most of the staff were probably students. Oh, that brings me to the cocktails…very hit n miss as to whether they could make them or not. I don’t think they’d all been trained well. When I asked for a mojito, one of the girls said ‘I’ll do my best’! 😂
We had a slight issue with our room when we first arrived and I have to mention that David was fantastic at helping us get it sorted out quickly. We wanted to thank him the whole week but didn’t see him until checking out, so thanks again David and good luck with your studies! We were given an upgrade due to the issue, for the whole week, and the views were beautiful. 
It’s a shame the hotel isn’t directly on the beach; you have to walk under a tunnel to get there. Also the beach, although maintained in that specific area, got quite dirty as you walked further along, which is a shame. It wasn’t the white sand and blue sea we were expecting. The beaches down the other end of the island are much nicer. 
Overall, a nice hotel and for the price we paid, we were happy. However, as a couple (both teachers) we’d probably try a little harder to find somewhere with less children (if at all possible, next time)

msg:I stayed 6days in the Pullman Oceanview Resort. In a word, it was a splendid experience. The hotel was located in a 10 min. distance from the centre of the sanya bay with food street and shops. It was very convinient to use taxi or didi from the hotel. On the other hand, it could make a calm rest with a such distance from those noise and people. 
This hotel has a direct view to the ocean from the window and balcony of the room, without any other building stuff. Sometimes some hotels sell ocean view room but not that direct ocean view but ‘partly’ ocean view. Pullman is not. 
Also due to the matured service of the staffs here, I felt so comfortable during my stay, whatever I need it was done immediately, e.g. from tiny small things to the boat booking and covid test(which needed to come back to my home). Special thanks to Vivian, she was supa matured that I even do not need to explain several words but only with a few words she understood what I needed and handled it very efficiently. As a non- chinese speaker there was some inconvinience always when I stayed in the several other cities and also in the Yalong Bay, which made me realise english service of 5 star hotels were not always the same. BUT this hotel I did not feel nervous at all, it was one of the mist comfortable experience in China. 

The hotel facility was very clean and well managed, it can be compared favorably to some newer hotels. Outdoor swimming pool for kids was very well managed and good to swim for children, even though the daytime temperature was 25-27, so normal pool temperature was too cold for swimming for kids. My girl was so happy to swim everyday! 
I definitely will stay here again, if I have chances to visit Sanya. And very sure this could be one of the best hotel in the Sanya bay especially for non-chinese speaking family, if you can have Vivian’s butler service when check-in.

Beach is clean super long to walk or run, swimming is possible without annoying lifeguards. Really nice atmosphere with palms in your back. For kids it’s perfect as water is not to deep. Not so many noisy water activities just a few jet ski offers ( we saw 2) some few fruit sellers are passing by. The Pullman Resort surprised us as well a lot!!! It was an amazing stay. As we had already really bad experiences at Hilton and Marriott on Yalong Bay it was here perfect. Service was on point, food was really good at buffet dinners, a la carte and breakfast. Staff was more than caring always friendly and thinking forward. Without asking they reserved us every morning our preferred breakfast table and served us our coffee without asking for either. Really good Chinese and western choices. Facilities are really nice as well for kids. Great indoor playground including a huge indoor trampoline area. Outside playground nice. 3 different pools. One reserved for adults or kids over 12 one big shallow one with sand entrance and water vehicles to rent. One pool heated up to 30 degrees if weather is not that good. Pool and beach service is amazing. You can order by QR code drinks and food and it gets delivered to your place. To the beach it takes a bit more as it’s a little away from hotel restaurant, what is not annoying when you know it. Beach access is easy by elevator down through a short tunnel, that you don’t have to cross street. We will definitely come back when we choose Sanya for our holidays.

msg:Our stay over the Golden week in Pullman Oceanview Sanya Bay Resort & Spa was very pleasant. Even though the weather was very rainy we enjoyed our time in the hotel: swimming in all three of the beautiful pools, using great variety of floating devices, ordering drinks at the pool bar. Kids also enjoyed around the pool activities, especially the foam party. Families would enjoy plenty of activities for children. Staff at the hotel deserves a special mention especially Wayne who went out of his way to provide the best friendlies service to us. He organised delivery and storage of our daughter's birthday cake, room decoration and balloons on the day of her BD and also late check out the next day. All staff is attentive and very friendly. Some of the ladies in the lobby bar could maybe do a bit more training in the names of the drinks in English as it took three of us to try and explain to several of them what "vodka" as an ingredient for the cocktail. Two musicians are also very nice and talented, they kept singing till very late even if there was only a couple of customers. In general very good vibe at the hotel: relaxing and if not dead at nights as some hotels we've been to. Both Chinese and Western restaurants were very good. Breakfast plentiful and varied, very clean and attentive service, every dish is always replenished without reminders. We always managed to sit outside on the terrace and enjoy fresh air and beautiful views. 17th Floor bar also nice with panoramic views of Sanya Bay and has a variety of deals: afternoon tea, all you can drink, romantic dinner, etc.

The only thing it´s horrible noisy in the morning, so the breakfast can´t be enjoyed. The pool is very nice and clean, many chair below the tropical palm tree. The beach is clean and nice, this time can´t swim in the sea cause of many jellyfish(one bite me). What i miss in Sanya there is no beach restaurant like in other holiday destination for eat and drink.  All in all the hotel is good for have some holiday for relax.
