The only feedback is that the lobby lounge area needs some CLEAN freshener smell….I passed the lounge area to go to the “winter” mall and it kept smelling like dirty socks….I think it’s the carpet

From the moment I checked in, the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, always willing to assist and answer any questions I had. The room was very comfortable and well-equipped, with a cozy bed that ensured a good night's sleep. The breakfast selection was diverse and of high quality, providing a great start to the day. Additionally, the hotel's location was very convenient, with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and easy access to transportation. Overall, I had a fantastic impression of this hotel and I will definitely choose to stay here again the next time I visit this city.

msg:Easily one of the best hotels I have stayed in while in china. My wife and I already live in Guangzhou so we only went for a staycation but we were blown away by the room. The size of the room and the view from our window. We stayed on the 50th floor and I must say it was breathtaking. 

There were a few minor complaints, firstly the AC in the room wasn’t the best. So we found our self’s overheating a little during the night but it wasn’t unbearable. 

Second overall the staff were very nice and friendly but there was one lifeguard at the outside pool that was a little rude when we forgot to bring a swim hat to the pool. 

The breakfast too was a little overpriced for what it was and there are definitely better options outside the hotel

Other than these complaints I can see why this is one of the best hotels in city and I would recommend this to anyone who can fit the price range.

The service at the hotel is exceptional, our butler Calista who

msg:I paid for room twice. When booked it in app and at the reception. + Deposit . Why ? I don't know . But it's really stupid. Rooms are perfect. Watch guy at the swimming pool really piss me off. He had business only to me about swimming cap . Few times he say , that I NEED A CAP AT OPEN SWIMMING POOL in 5 stars hotel. For what ? Because I have less hair on my head than Chinese guest at their armpits. When other people was swimming without it. There is no any rule or warning about the cap at the pool. So I refuse it several times and the last one really piss me off. People start to understand you only when you raise your voice and become rude. I don't know , does the " Six on bar " or "Bar on six " ( really stupid name and logo design) belong to Jumeirah, but we was choosing, what we want to eat , around 10 minutes, and When I make a choice, manager just told me , that they don't have a chicken, which I want to order. REALLY???!!!! 5 stars hotel doesn't have chicken at the kitchen. Why waiter didn't warn me about they don't have it? Did I order giraffe or crocodile meat? IT'S A CHICKEN! Also we didn't receive menu with non alcohol drinks so we decided, that they don't have it. So we just leave that restaurant, because it's really out of my mind. Now I understand, why there is no tips in China. Tips for what? For shitty service in 5 star hotel? Other workers was super cool , like reception or delivery to the room. Very fast , smooth and nice job . Really grateful for that

P.S. - hotel can save my photo and made the pool stuff to remember me and never speak about cap again, cause they will show me , how long can they be underwater without oxygen.

msg:The interior design of Jumeirah Guangzhou is superb, but its people are even more superb. They are fabulous to the extent that I believe it is the only hotel in Guangzhou that can challenge Mandarin Oriental on the area of service, and I will not be surprised if that challenge succeeds.

The interior design of Jumeirah Guangzhou, be it the lobby, restaurant, or rooms, is grand. Here I need to play some games of language because the grandness of Jumeirah Guangzhou is different from how we conventionally conceptualize this word. It is grand, but not British, Oriental, New York, or French. It is grand in the fashion of Abu Dhabi. If I had taken a selfie in its lobby, posted it on Instagram, and set the location as Abu Dhabi, I am sure that no one would find it a joke. Some of us in East Asia may easily think of a grand but overly enclosed atmosphere without any air or light when I use the phrase “Abu Dhabi fashion”. It is not so here. Jumeirah Guangzhou's Abu-Dhabi grandness is accompanied by spaciousness and a high ceiling, which fills the environment there with lively air – not pressuring at all! However, when I say spaciousness and high ceiling, some of us may again think of a hotel that crazily and blindly pursues more and more grandness but has no attention toward detail and ends up being ugly and vulgar (Wynn hotels are perfect examples of such). It is never so at Jumeirah Guangzhou. The room and the lobby are spacious and high, but this hotel pays huge attention to details and inserts even the tiniest corner with substantial refinements that deserve appreciation. Jumeirah Guangzhou is spacious, but no space there is excessive – every inch is an art. The living area in the room – which is equipped with a long dining table, under the moderately lit chandelier extends from the high ceiling on the second floor of the room (yes, its room has two floors), and overlooks the most premium part of the central business district – is a perfect place for educated ladies and gentlemen to stay.

A hotel with such unparallel hardware can easily suffer from the criticism of not having the right staff to make the best use of the hardware. However, Jumeirah Guangzhou does not only avoid this criticism; its people are excellent to the extent that I am afraid that even such exceptional hardware cannot supplement such extraordinary people enough! Its service did not just start at its front gate; it had already begun the morning on the day I would arrive. I received a call from Lexie when I was still having breakfast that day, who confirmed with me my room preferences and gave me her WeChat such that I could contact her whenever I needed anything. I texted her at 1 PM to see if, by any chance, I could already check in or not, and she gave me a really reassuring answer: "Of course, your room is already ready for you!" I cannot express how touching this arrangement by Lexie is. I have visited countless hotels, and I would always tell the hotels my room preferences at least one day before my arrival. However, no matter how high-end they are, all hotels would only find a room that kind of best matches my preferences out of the few rooms available by the time I checked in. Jumeirah Guangzhou is the only hotel that would really plan ahead to best entertain my room preferences. Simply by this quality, Jumeirah Guangzhou has already defeated all the hotels in Guangzhou.

Please don't miss out the delicious breakfast which is definitely worth the price. Not only a nice buffet but several delicious individual  a la carte dishes are included. 

Will definitely return. Thanks to the amazing Team!

The service is very good and considerate, especially the butler service that is also standard in the basic room. You can tell the butler directly if you have any problems, and the late check-out the next day is also very pleasant. The most worth mentioning is the sleeping dessert every night. It is really comfortable to drink a hot dessert after going out. But the only drawback is that the hot water in the shower room is slow, and the shower head may spray water around due to the water pressure. I hope the hotel can have a chance to update the equipment. In general, it is a very good treasure hotel, but it is a pity that it may not be so well-known in Guangzhou.

When I checked in after arriving at the hotel, the lady had already arranged all my needs. The lady at the front desk also gave me a camel doll. After entering the room, I felt it was worth it.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, right in the core area of ​​Zhujiang New Town, close to the East Tower, West Tower and the river. Before checking in, the customer service called to inquire about the arrival time, and then added the customer service WeChat service. If there are any problems, they are always there and solved in time. The front desk check-in and the hotel reception are very enthusiastic. The hotel is very new, and the facilities are also very user-friendly and modern. Compared with the surrounding five-star hotels, Jumeirah seems to be more low-key. The entrance is surrounded by green plants and is very quiet. There are Chinese and Western restaurants on the sixth floor, an outdoor swimming pool and a gym, as well as welcome fruits and sugar water in the evening. All services are very satisfactory and I will stay here next time

msg:Fake five-star hotel, the room fee is nearly 3,000 yuan, but the actual stay experience is extremely poor. 
1. Head injury caused by the hotel: We arrived at the hotel at around 23:17 on May 2. My husband was injured in the head due to improper operation of the waiter when taking the luggage. The waiter suddenly lifted the trunk cover, and the cover bounced back, and the sharp edge hit my husband's head, which directly knocked him unconscious, and the pain was unbearable, and a big lump appeared. No one cared or apologized at the time. He stood there covering his head for about half a minute, with a painful expression. I got off the car and saw him covering his head, and I was scared. Later, someone brought an ice pack. My husband asked, "Don't you even say sorry?" Still no one apologized, and there was no substantial care. They just asked if we needed to go to the hospital. It was already 11:30, and we were with our 6-year-old child, so we checked in first. The lobby manager said that when eating the buffet breakfast, you can lie about your age with the child and get a free meal. It's ridiculous. Can't you be more sincere and give the child a meal coupon instead of asking the customer to lie? We take our children to any hotel buffet and never lie about their age. 
2. On May 3, I added the housekeeper on WeChat and asked the housekeeper for the video of the head being hit at that time. The housekeeper said that he could not give it. We made an appoin**ent with the lobby manager to meet in the room and clearly stated our demands, which was to get a formal apology from the hotel. The lobby manager said that it was beyond his authority and he could only wait for the leader to go to work the next day. 
3. On the evening of the 3rd, the child wanted to defecate. The hotel said that there was no children's toilet seat, only children's toilets for children under 3 years old. The hotel did not consider the toilet needs of children aged 3-6. I could only help him to go to the toilet, which was a very bad experience. It is not a 5-star standard. 
4. No one told me the buffet dining location and time when I checked in, and no one gave me the 200 yuan SPA voucher included in the order or told me how to use this discount until I left. The service was unqualified. 
5. I went to the buffet early on the 4th. The waiter wrote down our order (about 7-8 items), but only served a cup of tea in more than 20 minutes. When we asked the waiter, he said that the ordering machine was broken and the kitchen was closed, so we could only pack some bread or coffee. We asked for a refund, but there was no response. So far, the stay experience was extremely bad, and we asked to check out and refund the room fee for two nights. 
6. We went to the lobby to meet the room director and expressed our dissatisfaction. Even at this point, he still insisted that the injury was our own fault and did not respond to the breakfast experience. We asked for a refund for two nights, but he said he had no authority and could not contact the leader, so he could only give us a 30% discount on the second night. 
7. After calling the police, the police used their mobile phones to take slow-motion surveillance photos at the time and judged that there was a problem with the operation of the hotel staff. We insisted on a full refund, and the supervisor suddenly expanded his authority at this time, and could give us a 50% discount on the second night. The police talked to him alone, and he could provide a full refund for the second night, but he had no authority to refund the first night, and he needed to report to his leader, saying that he would reply to me on the 6th. His attitude was extremely insincere and inconsistent. Saying that he had no authority and could not contact the leader was just an excuse. We said in front of the police that we needed to refund the two nights' room fee, and we called Ctrip to temporarily refund the room fee on May 3, and informed them of the request to refund the room fee on May 2. 
8. No one contacted me on the 6th. In the afternoon, I called the room director and said that the room fee on May 2 would not be refunded. I asked who made the decision, but he refused to say, refused to give any reason, and refused to give me the contact information of his superior. He did not even admit that it was an operational problem of the hotel on the phone, which was completely different from his attitude when the police were present. 
9. There are huge loopholes in the hotel management. During the May Day holiday, when the tourists were full, there was no leader on duty. Customers' demands could not be responded to, and everything could only be reported to the superiors. It does not meet the 5-star standard at all. It is really not as good as the Four Seasons. 
10. The hotel uses the miscellaneous brand "Futini" (Tiffany?) shampoo and lotion, which is not a 5-star standard at all. 
The hotel is 5-star and gold diamond on Ctrip. We choose 5-star hotels when we go out just to have a good experience. But the actual check-in experience is extremely poor. The staff seemed to be untrained, without any professionalism, and not caring about the customers. The service attitude after the incident was slippery, evasive, and foolish, with no sincerity at all. There were several times in the middle when they could have shown good service attitude and saved their image, but each time the hotel chose the wrong direction, causing our experience to get worse and worse. 
We will not pay for such a bad experience. Taobao shopping can also return goods without reason within seven days. As a service industry, the hotel's service is its commodity. The room fee is nearly 3,000 yuan, and the service is completely unqualified and does not match the hotel's publicity at all. We are determined not to pay. 
Please Ctrip do its best to help me recover the loss.

msg:It was a very pleasant travel experience. When checking in at the front desk, the lobby manager enthusiastically introduced the hotel's surrounding shopping and dining facilities. The hotel is like a large garden in the CBD of Zhujiang New Town. The gate is surrounded by green plants. The location is also unique. It is located in the East Plaza of Godrej Land, and Huachenghui is next door. As a brand from Dubai, the lobby on the first floor uses dark gold tones as the main background, which sets off a sense of luxury. The room is equipped with a smart touch switch, which intelligently sets different lights for different scenes. The floor height is the biggest highlight, which, combined with the fragrance in the guest room, gives people a sense of luxury. The spare parts are from Biology in Australia. Service is also one of the hotel's strengths. The concierge depar**ent provides a 24-hour service similar to a dedicated butler, which can deliver takeout to the guest room; the night bed service also considerately prepares good night sugar water. The hotel's fitness facilities This time I chose to experience the hotel's gym, and the full set of Technogym is also in line with the positioning of a luxury brand. The breakfast is in a semi-self-service form, the single-point products are very good, the dining environment is also very good, and the choices in the self-service area are a little less. Overall, the experience of staying is still very good

msg:I chose Jumeirah for my holiday. There is not much promotion for the hotel, but it is indeed a big name in the world's luxury hotels, so I came to check in.
🧡The hotel is next to the Winter Plaza of G.T. Land in Zhujiang New Town. You can go to the hotel lobby bar in the mall and enter the hotel directly. This location can be said to be excellent, especially for those who travel to Guangzhou for vacation. It is in the core business district of CBD and is very convenient to go anywhere.
🧡The hotel lobby is not very luxurious, but the service is quite good. The hotel butler contacted in advance, added WeChat, and followed up on your arrival and needs at any time. There are also warm desserts in the evening.
🧡The room type is consistent with what I saw in the hotel reviews before, which is a long *****, but it will not feel cramped, because it is on the 50th floor, the view is still ok, and you can feel the modern building pattern of CBD.
🧡Breakfast is on the 6th floor of the hotel, semi-self-service, not many types, but the products are good. Overall, I am quite satisfied.
Daily bedtime dessert: Tremella and winter melon syrup
Welcome fruit upon check-in: Yes

msg:Jumeirah's reputation in the world is well known, and Jumeirah in Guangzhou has its consistent design style: grand, noble, and luxurious. The overall height of the hotel is very high, and the height of the elevators is about three meters. It indeed exudes luxury everywhere. Horizontal and grand, I have been hesitating about these hotels in Zhujiang New Town CBD before. The decoration style and service of this hotel, as well as the widely circulated "low-key", "difficult to find the lobby" and "secluded oasis in the busy city" made me like this hotel. I am interested in the hotel. Compared with the low-key entrance of the hotel, the interior decoration is in contrast to it, which is quite interesting. I have rarely heard of its reputation in Guangzhou before. Only when you step into the hotel lobby can you feel the beauty of the interior. The lobby The chandelier is a major feature, and echoes the small pool under the chandelier. There are two birds with special meanings in the pool. There is also an explanation for this. I think it is an interesting little detail. But there is one thing. There are many foreign guests in the hotel. I happened to meet a foreign guest when I went out that day and asked the luggage storage desk in English. The person at the desk didn't understand it for a long time. I stood beside and already understood the question. A foreign guest thought that someone had left a box for her, but the two waiters kept saying that she wanted a box, saying that we don’t have boxes, only bags. I think as a high-end hotel that often receives foreign friends, The English proficiency of the waiters at the service desk needs to be screened, otherwise it will affect the check-in experience of many foreign guests. Let’s talk about the room:
Facilities: Compared with other hotels of similar style, I find this hotel’s whole-house intelligence really rare and valuable. Most of the facilities in the same hotels are relatively traditional. This is a big plus. I stayed here this time. It is a duplex suite. It is very considerate that there are toilets on the first and second floors. If you want to use the toilet on the second floor, it is very convenient. The room is also equipped with kitchen equipment. It is more like a hotel-style apar**ent decoration, so qualified guests can stay there permanently. The room type has an interesting facility. There is a built-in hidden TV on the mirror in the bathroom on the second floor. Although it is very well thought out, there is always a small red light on the mirror, which sometimes makes people confused, and the actual experience of the built-in TV The TV freezes and the viewing experience is not very good. The shower room in the bathroom has a large amount of water and there is no limit on the hot water supply. Compared with other high-rise hotels with limited water use, it is much more convenient. However, the shower room has no door or curtain, so water can easily splash outside. This needs to be improved. , a chaise bed on the second floor is a bit empty, I personally think it could use a pillow.
Hygiene: Hygiene is not good. Although the room is not small, there are no sanitary dead spots. The overall hygiene is good.
Environment: Decoration styles vary from person to person. As a common fixture in luxury hotels, marble decoration is the same for people of the same level.
Service: The service attitude is good. There are welcome fruits and nighttime sugar water. I seem to have heard that there is a turndown service before? This time I didn't turn on Do Not Disturb on purpose, so I didn't see it. Overall, although the service has no bonus points, it is still of a very good level.
Overall, the stay experience is very good. I like the decoration here very much. I will stay here again if I have the opportunity. I also asked for a room card as a souvenir. The wooden room card is quite nice😄

msg:This trip to the third hotel in Guangzhou, unfortunately, I started to see blood an hour after checking in, and my finger was pinched by the glass door of the toilet. I can't understand that the design of a five-star hotel only has anti-collision *****s installed on one side of the glass door. After the proposal was made, the hotel's response was very fast and the anti-collision *****s were installed in the time it took to go out for a meal. Observing carefully, it turned out that there should be anti-collision *****s on both sides, but for some reason one side fell off and was not installed in time. And the incomprehensible glass door handle, an extremely small stainless steel peg? Are you afraid that the residents will be caught too easily? The compensation provided by the hotel: children's breakfast, a piece of fruit and dessert, a letter of apology, a canvas bag... It was too late to make amends. The harp performance at breakfast was great. There are more and more misaligned toilet seats from check-in to check-out. Even the dessert table that was given as an apology had two of the four corners broken. All in all, I can’t complain.

msg:My wife went to Guangzhou on a business trip, and I happened to go with her during my annual leave. I also did some research and wanted to experience what it would be like to stay at Jumeirah Hotel, so I know everything. On the morning of my check-in, I received a call from the hotel service staff who upgraded me to a suite, which was a pleasant surprise. I have stayed in luxury hotels many times, and this is the first time I have enjoyed an upgraded service.
After staying for two days, what impressed me most was the gym. As an athlete, I must give it good reviews. The equipment here is new and the categories are complete. If you like to exercise, after eating Guangzhou delicacies, come here to burn some calories, and continue to eat, eat, eat the next day.
As a luxury hotel in China, Jumeirah still uses manual delivery when guests order takeout to be delivered to their rooms, which shows that the hotel is still warm. However, the hotel service staff may not be able to deliver the takeout as soon as possible after it is delivered. , you may need to wait for more than half an hour. Moreover, a waiter I met this time seemed a little unhappy to me. He turned sideways, tilted his head, put one hand in his pocket, and handed it to me with the other hand, and his tone was also a little unhappy. Overall, this stay was very pleasant. The details in all aspects are still very good.

It also touches my aesthetic point.
Before coming to the lobby to check in, I saw the Jumeirah apar**ent. If
I will take my parents to stay here next time I come to Guangzhou.
The decoration in the lobby is grand but not tacky, and it is very elegant.
The service is impeccable, attentive but not excessive. The complimentary tangerine peel and hawthorn syrup is refreshing and delicious.
We stayed in deluxe twin rooms, and every room was full of the warmth of home.
The equipment is brand new, the items are well placed, and the night view of the city is eye-catching. It’s a great place to stay.
Very happy.

msg:On the last night of my trip to Guangzhou, I stayed at Jumeirah Hotel Guangzhou, which belongs to the same group as the famous Jumeirah Burj Al Arab Hotel in the United Arab Emirates. The experience was not inferior to the three nearby cloud hotels in Guangzhou, and it was even better in many aspects. The location of the hotel is very friendly to people who love shopping. Within one kilometer, you can visit Huacheng Square, Zhengjia Plaza, Tianhuan Plaza, and K11 within a short walk.

The design of the hotel from the lobby to the elevators highlights the luxurious and complicated scene. The large area of ​​marble, crystal lamps and flower and plant elements in the lobby are complex and delicate without being cluttered. The decorations of several elevators are not simple hanging paintings, but caged birds. With elements of changing seasons, every time you enter the elevator you are full of expectations and surprises.
The room experience is one of the top two among the hotels I stayed in in Guangzhou. I upgraded to the premium room. The room has a very high ceiling and great lighting. The aura is not inferior to the executive suite of another hotel I stayed in the night before.
The hotel service is also very good. Cantonese sugar water is prepared in the evening, the coffee and tea bags in the minibar will be replenished in time, the breakfast restaurant has good quality products, and there is also live harp music. Kiki from the guest experience depar**ent is very enthusiastic and responds promptly when help is needed.

A hotel full of sincerity. I will definitely stay there again next time I come to Guangzhou.

When the takeout arrives, you have to verify your last name. After three takeaways, there is no one to deliver the takeaways. You need to call. I called to remind you, and when you called the luggage storage, you had to ask at what time to pick up your things. The shower pipes and faucets couldn't be controlled at all.

The service is also very good and follow up at any time. There are different sugar drinks every night. It is a very special experience. However, the hygiene details need to be paid attention to if you want to use it. I took a look at the hotel's multifunctional tool and found that it was stuck inside. I had not cleaned it after using it before. The light button and the shower head were a bit flashy and too advanced. There was no explanation and it was inconvenient to use. Finally, I would like to say that such a high-end hotel does not even have an executive lounge. I don’t understand this (when the occupancy rate is very high) and I’m a little disappointed.

I’m glad I made the right choice! It was already past 10 pm when we arrived at the hotel on the first day. The concierge opened the door, picked up our luggage, and waited for us to check in. He took the initiative to press the elevator and guided us all the way to the room. Every step was very considerate. The lady at the front desk chose a room with an unobstructed view and a good view for us, and specially gave us a camel doll for the baby. We were very surprised when we opened the curtains the next day and found that we could see the Canton Tower from the side! The hotel's sound insulation is also very good, which is very important for us who are used to sleeping until we wake up naturally!
Stayed for 4 nights and the experience was really great! The hotel's facilities, sanitation and services are all above standards. The housekeeper sends greetings via WeChat every day, responds promptly to any questions, and delivers daily sugar water in a thermos cup to the room. The cleaning lady was kind and careful, and kept the room very clean. Seeing that we had brought a box of water ourselves, she was worried that we wouldn't have enough to drink, so she would put a few extra bottles of water for us to spare. The only problem is that the shower upstairs in the duplex has no door and water will splash out. We easily solved it with two floor towels. The service staff greet you with a polite smile when entering and exiting the hotel. They will open the door to pick up your luggage when you get on and off the bus. Even takeaways will be delivered to the room. After checking out, they will also help carry the luggage to the car. It is really hard work. I will definitely come back next time. I will still choose here!

As someone who majored in hotel management at university and worked in two hotels, the Ritz-Carlton and Capella, after graduation, although I have changed careers for many years, I still unconsciously retain some occupational diseases when it comes to staying in hotels. Jumeirah, which I used to call "Jumeirah", may be unfamiliar to everyone, but to us in the hotel management department, it is a legend. The Seven Star Burj Al Arab in Dubai is the same hotel group. Before I checked in, I was worried that my expectations were too high and I would be disappointed, but the actual feeling after checking in was far beyond my expectations, and it was like being wowed.
1. Low-key. The entrance is slightly hidden, blocked by a pedestrian bridge, and the eaves and pillars are covered with green plants. You can't see the hotel's logo when you look up.
2. Luxury. The lobby has a dark tone and two bouquets of orange fuchsias hang from the ceiling like waterfalls, filling the space with an artistic sense. Don't wait in line to check in. The room card is made of wood, which is special and high-quality. There are very few people in the whole hotel, making it quiet and comfortable. The room is in Chinese style, marble + solid wood, and has a heavy and high-end feel.
3. Clean. There were no water stains or fingerprints on the cup in the room under the light, and there was no dust within reach of the palm. I took my children swimming and when I came back I found that the soles of the hotel's slippers were very clean.
4. Details. The bathroom is from Duravit, the hair dryer is from Dyson, and the tea bags are from T**** Tea.
5. Temperature. Sugar water, fruits and cakes are delivered to the room.
6. Surprise. The room type was upgraded for free. It was a middle-aged man who had not celebrated his birthday for N years. The second day after check-in happened to be my birthday. The hotel arranged for red wine to be delivered to the room and also gave my child a cute camel doll. He was very happy.
Summary: Everyone has their own preferences for hotel decoration styles, and service is the core competitiveness of a hotel. Thank you Vivian for your considerate and meticulous service, which is just right, will not cause disturbance, and will not use excessive force.
PS: I took the hotel slippers home and they are really comfortable~
I look forward to the next hotel that can compete with Jumeirah, which ranks C in my heart!

When we walked into the room and opened the curtains, we could see the most prosperous scene of Zhujiang New Town. Outside the large floor-to-ceiling windows were the Liede Bridge, the K11 Building and the corner of Haixinsha. , the beautiful night view of the central axis of Guangzhou City also allows me, a veteran Guangzhou, to see a different Guangzhou. In addition, the decoration of the hotel lobby and rooms can be regarded as ceiling level, magnificent and high-end. I have also stayed in some high-end luxury hotels in Guangzhou CBD, but this time I felt that I felt at home in Jumeirah Hotel. In particular, every service provided by Lucy, the hotel's guest experience director, and her hotel team, from the moment we checked in to when we checked out, were very attentive and warm-hearted. This is a warm hotel that is really recommended and worth staying at again.

Since we arrived early, we told her that we wanted to get the room early, and we had children. Extra bed request. So I got the room at 1:00 noon. When I came back from a trip around 3:00 pm, I saw that the room had been decorated with children’s decorations (tents and toiletries, etc.) as Vivian said, and the bed was added. In the evening, the hotel also delivered warm food. syrup. On the day of check-out, Vivian gave us a free application to extend the check-out time to two o'clock in the afternoon, and assisted us in booking a courtesy car at a preferential price.

There was a slight problem during my 2-night stay, which was quickly resolved. However, the online reviews before check-in were much better than those of Four Seasons and Mo, so my expectations were a bit too high, but the overall experience was pretty good. The room was large and the floors were high, giving it a sense of luxury ( The public area has a luxurious feel, but it is not fashionable. The comfort of the room is better than that of the magnificent one.) The breakfast variety is generally special and a bit low-end. The spa is very comfortable and the service is good. I will come to experience the classic agarwood massage next time. There is free sugary water every night. Heartwarming!

🏠Provided in the room: crib, bathtub, bottle warmer, children's bathrobe, slippers, children's bath products, toothbrush, basically complete
illy's capsule coffee machine, the coffee is really delicious!

Hotel facilities:
1. The outdoor swimming pool is divided into adults and children. We brought our own swimming rings and inflatable guns, so we don’t need to inflate them ourselves. The kids had a great time playing in the pool!
2. The indoor swimming pool is 25 meters, and there is also underwater music. You can hear the details of the music when you swim. The shower room is separated from wet and dry. There are three types of showers. Both steamed and dry.
3. Hammam This is the place that surprised me the most. It even built a Turkish bath on the sixth floor, where you can do body exfoliation (additional charge), but you need to make an appoin**ent in advance, because it takes 3 hours to heat the whole room. The local tyrants can really do it experience it.

hotel service:
1. After checking in, I added the butler’s Wechat, and I can find the butler for anything, and the response speed is also very fast. In the evening, mung bean syrup and sugar water were delivered in a thermos. The food is delicious, and there are welcome fruits. I feel that the hotel is full full of sincerity.
2. The breakfast time is from 6:00-10:30. It is really friendly for those with children, and there will be a harp performance after 8:00, and the children don’t want to leave after watching it! The restaurant is very warmly decorated, there are some big bears sitting in different positions, there are special tableware and placemats for babies (the mini version for adults is super cute)
🍽️There are not many types of breakfast, but it takes a refined route, everything is delicious, the service is also very good, and the table distance is relatively wide.
3. Before leaving, I gave my baby a camel doll from the hotel. I liked it when I saw it in the swimming pool. I wanted to buy it, but I didn’t expect to give it to us directly. It’s great!

I didn't expect Jumeirah to be so friendly to children, beyond my imagination, must praise!

The housekeeper will contact you before check-in to ask if you want to bring children, prepare children's products, and answer any questions at any time. The little brother greets you when you enter and leave the door. It is very nice and worthy of this luxury standard. I recommend it to friends. You can also see the Guangzhou Tower in the room.

msg:The location of the hotel is great, it's close to the Canton Tower, the staff in the lobby are very friendly, the room is very clean, it's very comfortable to live in, different drinks are delivered to the room every day, very considerate. Because the flight is after 19 o'clock, I trouble the hotel to delay the check-out, thank you very much! Special thanks to the young lady I met in the elevator before leaving, who took the initiative to help us check out and store our luggage. Thank you very much. Next time you come to Guangzhou, you will choose Jumeirah! 🥰

msg:I like Jumeirah very much, manual five-star
- The location is good, there are many shopping malls and attractions within walking distance.

- The hardware facilities show the hotel's generosity. From the lobby to the housing, the design of a large number of marble elements combined with Chinese beams is amazing. Really magnificent. The bathroom has a whole marble wall with a height of about three meters and double sinks. This is the first time I have seen such a configuration in China. From the ceiling decorated with wood elements to the wood grain tiles in the shower room, you can feel the design echo. The ingenuity in many details is refreshing.

- Impressed with the hotel's indoor pool. In addition to the basic configuration provided by hotels at the same price, it comes with wet steaming/dry steaming, swimsuit dryer/ice towel refrigerator. The details are worthy of the five-star title. We went to the swimming pool in the afternoon, and we reserved it. The experience is great. (There is also an outdoor swimming pool, but I didn't go)

- Sugar water is provided every night, very Guangzhou. The hotel handles the small problems encountered during the stay very quickly. Feel at home.

Jumeirah's service is really good! Every staff member I saw has a strong sense of service, five-star praise!
The breakfast is Western style, there is a harp playing, and there is a resident singing in the outdoor swimming pool at night, which is very unexpected, I like it very much!
Guangzhou is very hot these days, and you will be sweating when you come out for a walk at 7 o'clock in the evening. This summer's trip to lie flat!
Jumeirah is the best stop!

msg:Health: The health environment is very good
Environment: The environment is good, you can barely see the Canton Tower. Stylish and clean
Facilities: The shower is not easy to use, the water temperature is too hot, and so is the air conditioner. The control for adjusting the light is not easy to use. The light is too dim. Even with the makeup mirror light, it is still difficult to see clearly. The shower was broken at first, but it was already 12 o'clock to take a bath, so the bath in the bathtub could not be processed until the next day, which led to a bad experience on the first night.
Service: Overall pretty good. The response speed is fast, the WeChat reply is fast, and the fruit and sugar water delivered are also good. However, the detailed services are not adequate and employee training needs to be strengthened. For example, etiquette, communication, problem handling, etc. Sometimes employees respond quickly to problems but are not efficient. Some issues can be dealt with in one visit and require two visits to the room.

The anniversary is noted, and the hotel also specially prepared flower bouquets and other decorations. In terms of service, everyone from the concierge to the front desk is very warm and polite, and there is also a dedicated butler to solve problems at any time. It is the first time I have encountered a hotel that prepares sugar water and delivers it to the guest room at night. No matter the software or hardware, this hotel is impeccable. The 24-hour gym is very large and well-equipped, and the brand is also top-notch. The room can see the Canton Tower. There are k11 Huachenghui and other business districts nearby. The location is excellent. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will definitely choose here again.

There are many hotels nearby that I think are pretty good, but in the end I chose Jumeirah’s The reason is because I saw reviews saying that the five-star hotel is quite new, but to be honest, I think it is quite old. The TV in the room is too small, and the sound has creaking noises, which is typical of a five-star hotel Are facilities this bad now?
Regarding the service, I think I can feel the service. Even the welcome fruit was delivered by the little butler I sent a message to ask. Compared with the previous stay at the Intercontinental, the service is really considerate. 1560 for one night is very average.

Hygiene: The hygienic brother diligently throws away the rubbish in the trash can, but the rubbish in the fruit plate on the table does not say no.

Service: The bill is basically in English, I don't understand... There are not many foreign tourists, most of them are Chinese tourists? When I checked out, I also said that I consumed a bottle of Coke/Sprite for 28 yuan, but I didn't use it...

msg:Unbelievable that such a disgusting thing could happen in a 5 star luxury hotel!

When I was making up and preparing to check out, I lowered my head and found that there were hairs left by the previous guest who shaved or trimmed the hair on the towels stacked on the sink, which means that the hotel did not replace the new ones when cleaning the room towels! ! ! ! ! And I actually used their bath towel and another towel on the washstand after I checked in in the rain yesterday, and because of my trust and myopia, I didn't check them and picked them up directly, in case they were just the last one The guest has used it but folded it well and put it there, maybe it has not been replaced! ! !

Must stay as a guest of this Jumeirah, please ask the housekeeper to replace all towels and supplies with new ones in front of you after check-in! ! ! It must be replaced with a new one, because they will not replace it as long as they see that the stack is well stacked. In case any guest has folded towels and hung them up after using them up, he will be tricked! ! !

This is the second time I have stayed in Jumeirah. When I first stayed a year ago, I found that the bathroom accessories used by the previous guest were not replaced. However, because the shower gel is relatively difficult to cause any pollution, I don’t care if I don’t use it. I was already seated at breakfast and went to pick up my meal while waiting for coffee. The staff actually took another customer to my seat, which made me feel embarrassed when I came back and had to find another seat by myself. This service is also terrible.

After the first check-in experience, because I like Jumeirah's room design, I decided to try again this time, but I didn't expect such a disgusting thing to happen, and it was an unacceptable mistake than the first time.

Because I used to be a hotel person, I couldn’t believe that a luxury hotel would pay so little attention to room cleaning, and after the room staff cleaned it, wouldn’t the room supervisor release the room without checking? ! Jumeirah can only be checked in after 3 o'clock, and other hotels of the same level can only be checked in at 2 o'clock. Could it be that the extra time can't be cleaned, not to mention that the towels don't need to spend a lot of time, as long as they are all replaced with new ones!

If you can't meet the service standards, please don't call yourself a luxury hotel. After the first check-in, I gave feedback very carefully. After checking out this time, I also called to apologize and said that it will be improved. What's the use? It's not that I didn't give it a chance, but it's disgusting to make mistakes that are more and more unacceptable. No matter what discount, upgrade and free compensation this hotel offers, I will never stay here again! ! With more than 20 years of domestic and foreign travel experience, dozens of beds and rooms in luxury hotels, this is the first time I think a hotel is "disgusting"!

This time I booked a duplex suite, both the decoration and the supplies inside are very elegant. I especially like the design of the room card, which is made of wood.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the view of the duplex suite is to see the Pearl River Park, and you can't see the small waist, but the design of the dining bar guide table is very good, the bedding is comfortable, and the service is nice.

First of all, let me talk about the room. It is clean and very quiet. It is really comfortable for the light sleeping stars. It feels like home. Moreover, the service of the hotel is very good, and the staff speaks softly.
This time when I was in Guangzhou, it happened to be my son’s birthday. The hotel thoughtfully prepared a birthday ceremony. The child was very happy. The thing that made me feel that the service was in place was that the child fell and called the front desk in a hurry. The waiter was there. In the case of medicine, I immediately found medicine for me, thanks to the staff of Jumeirah! Next time I go to Guangzhou, I will continue to choose to stay at Jumeirah😊

msg:When I was doing a hotel guide for this trip to Guangzhou, I was looking forward to the Jumeirah room. After checking in, I really like the hotel rooms. The rooms are very large and feel more than 50 square meters, especially the high ceiling design of Jumeirah. The height of each floor is at least 1.5 times that of ordinary hotels, so it seems that the space is super large and the view is extremely wide. When you check in, you can add WeChat to the service depar**ent, and you can talk about it at any time if you need it. In the evening, there is sweet soup (it was barley and winter melon soup) and fruit. I really like the hotel room so much. The Huacheng Square has a sweeping view. Although I can only see a little Canton Tower, it doesn't affect it at all. Sure enough, the room is big and comfortable.

When I left the store, I wanted to choose a room card as a souvenir. The lady at the front desk offered a lot to choose from and gave me a commemorative camel, very considerate!

The only downside is that the Wi-Fi is a bit slow.

The room is really worth living in!

It is very comfortable to sit and chat with family members in the tea tasting area. A few small suggestions: the night light in the room is a little too bright, and I don’t know how to dim it that night; it would be more considerate if the room attendant can explain how to use the facilities in the room when you check in. Generally speaking, from check-in, to room service, and finally check-out, the waiters we have come into contact with are professional, enthusiastic, and polite, making people feel comfortable and good. After swimming twice, the water temperature felt comfortable. The dry sauna room was not open on the first day. After reflecting, I opened the sweat steam room after swimming the next day.

Fortunately, there was no thunder. Arrived late, check-in and check-out were quick, and the service was good. Overall, I am satisfied. The given room type is located at the last corner of the corridor, which feels a bit strange, but the view is good.
Facilities: The hardness of the bed is just right for me. I can sleep without back pain or allergies. The quilt is thick and soft. It is that the indoor lighting control is not very friendly to the operation of the elderly, and there is a delay in turning on the lights. I have been doing it for a long time. The bath water in the bathroom is large enough and very comfortable. The gym on the 8th floor is great! It is reserved at 5:30, and you need to swipe your card to enter at the door. The experience is very good.
Check-in welcome fruit: This feels a bit tasteless, and the fruit is not very attractive. The thermos cup containing sugar water is a bit old and scratched, so it is recommended to replace it in time.
The driver who came in and out of the taxi couldn't find the location in the lobby, it should be in Gaode Landmark: Winter. The hotel is very close to Huacheng Square. Except for sleeping, I didn't stay in the hotel for too long, but the overall feeling is still very good.

The guests who had a party next door were woken up in the middle of the night and were very depressed. Ctrip's communication ability surpassed that of the hotel, and the work efficiency was high. Checking in is full of good things, making money, but because of this reason, the standards of other guests are lowered, and I think it still needs to be improved

msg:Overall, I think it's not bad, but during the Chinese New Year period, due to the high occupancy rate and insufficient staff, the experience is mediocre.

-Decoration style
I like it myself. In the room space, I think the space design and utilization are quite good, and the bedding is also very comfortable.
- Hygiene
Not so good, in a hotel of this level, the table in the room was not wiped clean (because it is a glass surface, finger prints are obvious); there are tea stains in the teapot.
-Serve
It's okay, maybe it's because the Chinese New Year is too busy. The welcome fruit for check-in was delivered at 7:30 in the evening, and it was delivered after several reminders.
-spa
Moderate, not particularly attractive

Facilities: relatively complete, bring children, but the hotel does not seem to have a children's playground. It is a very new hotel in the entire Zhujiang New Town. The decoration is quite rough, there are two swimming pools, one indoor and one outdoor.

Service: There is a special butler service, there is sugar water in the evening, and the waiter will deliver the food to the door of the room.

After entering the room, the scenery outside the window on the 50th floor is good, and the service staff of the hotel are warm and thoughtful. When there is any question in the room, we can solve and answer for the guest in the first time! On the day of check-in, the hotel's exclusive customer service called to inquire about the check-in time and preferences, and arranged the best room on the floor. Also, because of the birthday on the day of check-in, the hotel gave a cheesecake, fruit for check-in, and a thermos of refreshing and moisturizing sugar water for leftovers at night. And arrange the room for free, of course, after Ctrip places the order, Ctrip customer service will also contact the hotel to inform the guests of their check-in needs! Ctrip's customer service is getting better and better, thank you! At the same time, the hotel's exclusive customer service (Vivi beauty, the guest experience director) has been added. If you need anything, you can directly say it, and the housekeeper can meet it in time. In the evening, the hotel also presented a customized version of Camel for the New Year, which is very attractive! Thank you beautiful Vivi director 🌹🌹,
Guangzhou people usually like to stay in star hotels with different experiences in urban areas to enjoy their service standards. I like the service of Jumeirah Hotel in Guangzhou 👍👍 .

Personally speaking, when faced with choosing which hotel to choose, if the hotel has almost the same star rating and price, it depends on the service. This is the foundation of a star-rated hotel, and the service level is based on the requirements, understanding and respect of the hotel staff themselves and their internal staff for their own profession. If you are engaged in the service industry and your mentality and posture are not right, then why are you sitting in that position?

msg:I have always wanted to stay at the Jumeirah Hotel in Guangzhou, because this time I was in Guangzhou for business, and the Jumeirah brand is actually relatively rare in **************. I finally had the opportunity to stay there💓.

First of all, the location🌃 is really convenient. It is in the center of Zhujiang New Town, opposite the East Tower and next to Huachenghui. It is connected to AutoNavi Land Winter ❄️, so it is very convenient to eat. But the bad thing is that it is far away from the MRT station, because you have to take a detour to Huacheng Avenue Station on the APM line, which is still a bit of a walk.

The second is the service attitude, which is really top-notch. From handling at the front desk, to delivering luggage to the gift department, and delivering food outside, everything was really comfortable. What I particularly want to emphasize is that because this time I ordered fruits 🍇, medicines 💊, and daily necessities, which were delivered almost five times, the boys and girls in the gift department helped deliver them to the door, which was very considerate.

The third is the room facilities, which are really big and new. The room is very large, and you can directly see the East Tower and the Pearl River outside the window. The view is great. In addition, the room facilities are very high-end, including Bose speakers, Dyson hair dryers, and Duravit smart toilets. The bathroom also has two sinks for easy use by multiple colleagues.

In the end, I am really satisfied with my stay this time. I hope I will have the opportunity to experience it next time I come to Guangzhou.

The hotel lobby, elevator, aisle, room decoration and facilities make people feel very comfortable, and the floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the room have a good visual effect. It is especially worth mentioning that we did not live in a duplex, but the room space is very high, maybe because some of their room types are duplex suites, and the ceiling space may be designed to be very high. The bed was really comfortable. The parking is also very convenient this time, there are many parking spaces in the underground parking lot. Compared with other hotels I have stayed in, such as Four Seasons, Rosewood, InterContinental Poly, Elegant, Conrad, Hilton, etc., Jumeirah’s service is definitely the first, the most considerate and thoughtful. Will stay again in the future.

The guest service manager beety also gave us an extra cake, which my fiancee liked very much. beety contacted me one day in advance (you can contact the hotel in advance if you want a private surprise), and delivered fruit and sweet water in the middle of the night, which was also very pleasant. Breakfast is also very good and filling.
The difference between the honorable room and the ordinary room is that there is an oversized fan-shaped, charming landscape, facing the cbd flower city square, the room is bigger than magnificent, newer than the four seasons ❤️❤️❤️

The doll of the hotel, sent us to the room in advance. The breakfast is half a la carte and half buffet. The quality of the food is very good, and the product is quite good, and listening to the harp for breakfast, wake up the vitality of the day. Afternoon tea is quite distinctive, this time is the theme of autumn. The flower arrangement in the lobby is very beautiful, and the whole hotel is in the style of the Tang Dynasty, which is worth visiting.

Afternoon tea is very delicate, a friend comes over and the three of us only need to add a cup of coffee, the dessert is enough for three people to share, and my friend likes that Persian tea very much 😄 The room facilities are relatively new, there are children's toiletries, there is an indoor heated swimming pool, is that the outdoor pool is a bit far. The breakfast is very good, especially the optional breakfast on the menu is very satisfying. There are also many places to visit near the hotel. We took the baby out for a walk and came back for a nap, and also helped us to delay the check-out time. The service is very user-friendly. Overall very satisfied.

msg:💗On the wedding day, I booked a Pearl Suite and came to a small after party. The outdoor high-altitude terrace is like a private sky bar, which is very suitable for enjoying the night view and having a drink, but it was too cold that night🥲

🍽The content of breakfast is okay, at least I really like waffle, and the service response is also timely

🥂Actually, when Jumeirah called the night before, I mentioned the wedding on the day, expecting some small decorations and surprises, but it turned out to be nothing, compared to what I received at the Ritz-Carlton, Macau before. Surprise, Jumeirah is obviously not enough, not to mention that this suite is really luxurious. The lack of this caring experience leads to a very shallow memory of staying in hotels in the Mainland.

🍾 What can be praised is that adding WeChat is indeed a lot more convenient for communication. If you have any questions, you can respond in a timely manner. In the evening, sugar water is also provided, but unfortunately I didn’t have the appetite to drink it that night.

The only downside is that the service in the breakfast restaurant is not satisfactory. The waiter is not enthusiastic enough. The expression of serving the food is cold as if he owes him money. It is recommended to strengthen the training of waiter service awareness.

The environment is beautiful. It is also the only five-star hotel in Zhujiang New Town that has breakfast. The restaurant for the show. Afternoon tea is beautiful and delicious (for example, afternoon tea in Four Seasons is very bad and the price is very low), but the water in the hotel swimming pool is not directly exposed to the sun, so it will be colder than families with children (Park Hyatt's swimming pool will have an advantage). The room in this hotel is not very good, but the personal satisfaction of this hotel is that the restaurant is all delicious and beautiful.

The bad thing is the shower room, which is very dark and hidden, because this shower room should not be duplex next time.
And when we checked in, we were asked to wait until more than 4 o'clock, but the manager came up to deliver afternoon tea, because the afternoon tea was very good, so I was relieved.
There is sugar water every night, and a small cake for National Day. The red box with the outer shell is very special. It is actually chocolate when you pinch it. It is so realistic. The black sesame cake inside is very delicious!

msg:An ultra-luxury hotel located in Zhujiang New Town. Came here through a friend's recommendation and it was a good experience. The hotel is designed with high ceilings, and the lobby is magnificent yet exquisite and unique. The room I was in was located on the 52nd floor. After entering the room through the low entrance door, because the roof was very high, I felt a strange world. The design of the swimming pool is very distinctive, and there are many water toys that children like. Afternoon Tea Lobby Lounge, Breakfast Restaurant has a quiet dining environment, elegantly furnished, and the guzheng harp played by the artist live as the background music. During the meal, I heard a familiar tune by chance, and my normally tense nerves were instantly released. The variety of breakfast is not based on quantity, but on quality. It was a surprise that smoked salmon was on the breakfast buffet. There are also instant snacks on the menu, which is an inexplicable admiration beyond the surprise. Room supplies are also carefully selected or custom-made. Finally, two suggestions are made: First, it is recommended to provide soft and hard choices for pillows. The pillow was too soft for me. Second, it is best to provide an extra quilt in the room as a spare.

msg:The lobby and rooms are more elegant than the photos, not bad.
The butler service is also very considerate, and basically responds in seconds.
Here are the disadvantages:
1. The location is next to Huacheng Square, so it is very convenient to take a taxi. If you take public transportation, it doesn't feel very convenient.
2. The hotel's food and beverages are too average and overwhelmed. I brought an afternoon tea, which is more than just gold and jade, it just looks good. The so-called high-quality breakfast is also extremely ordinary and not worth it at all.
3. The hotel is famous for its service. The front desk staff and the butler are really good, but the waiter at the entrance of the hotel is extremely dull. Asking Didi Taxi for the hotel location can be wrong, and asking him to tell the Didi driver the exact address is also dumbfounded. Looking at the phone without saying a word. incomprehensible. . .

If the service and catering can be improved, it will be better.

msg:Jumeirah Hotel is located in Zhujiang New Town. It is an emerging five-star hotel in the past two years. The hotel lobby has a beautiful Chinese environment and is full of flowers. When checking in, there are very few people who can sit for guests, which is worthy of praise. Check-in was fast and room was available early.
On the day you check in again, the housekeeper will add WeChat to consult your needs, and the processing is more timely.
The afternoon tea in the package is also good. Overall, it is not lost, and everything is passable.
The swimming pool is outdoor, you need to walk to the apar**ent, which is a lack, and the air conditioning in the locker room is relatively cool, and children are easy to catch cold when changing clothes. It is recommended that the hotel can slightly increase the temperature and be more environmentally friendly.

msg:Going for 4.9 points, the service is very disappointing! I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 and told me that I could only take one room first and wait for the other one. I did not enjoy the free upgrade mentioned by other online reviews, mainly because it was embarrassing to go to the leader's room, and there was no relevant apology measures, such as arranging GRO to bring a drink to the lobby bar and other rooms. I went back to my room and waited abruptly for an hour. I got impatient. I called the front desk and said the room was ready. Wouldn't you take the initiative to contact the guest to send the room card? ! I ordered takeout, and I asked if it could be delivered to the room? The answer is ok, but I waited and waited, and I didn’t see it. I went downstairs to have a look. There were three staff members at the concierge desk, and I didn’t see them busy. There was no one customer, and the takeaway was there quietly. building. The flight was delayed and the check-out was delayed until 2:30. Considering the tightness of the hotel room, one of the rooms was checked out before 12:00. It was told that it could only be until 2:00 at most, otherwise the room fee would be charged, and the front desk said at the time of check-out. There is a breakfast consumption, to be deducted from the deposit. I was puzzled at the time. I booked a room with breakfast included, and there were no children. Where did the extra breakfast cost come from? After the negotiation, the internal connection problem was discussed. Such a misunderstanding and episode happened. After checking out, I waited on the sofa in the lounge area for the bus to go to the airport, and no one came to ask. Even if I brought a cup of free tea, I would feel much better, but unfortunately not. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but I have never encountered such "enjoyment extraordinary"...

msg:Jumeirah Hotel is black for a lifetime! ! ! ! !
The first negative review on Ctrip is for Guangzhou Jumeirah Hotel.
I stayed for two days, and when I checked out at noon on July 14, the hotel front desk told me that I had spent one morning, 178 yuan, which would be deducted from the 2,000 yuan deposit, and the balance would be returned to the payment channel within 3-4 hours. I replied that no problem. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I received another call from the hotel, confirming with me again that I had consumed a breakfast, and said that the balance of the deposit would be refunded to me within 1-2 hours. I say yes.
When I was about to go to bed after 12 o'clock in the evening, I suddenly remembered that the hotel deposit had not been refunded, so I called the front desk. So I asked him to transfer me to the manager. After he transferred, I waited for seven or eight minutes, but no one answered the phone. After I hung up the phone and replayed the front desk call, the front desk Travel said that he did not transfer the error to the manager for a while, and then said that he was communicating with the manager.
Anyway, I finally communicated with the manager, and the manager explained that several of their colleagues "forgot" to refund my money. The receipt that was sent to me also clearly showed that it was after one o'clock in the morning on July 15th that the payment was made for me. I don't know if they will refund the deposit if the guest forgets about it and doesn't call.
It's just... outrageous.

The bed in the room is very short, and a person who is 1.8x meters tall will have to spend his legs on the pillow when he sleeps normally.
The temperature control knob in the bathroom of the room was damaged, so I just used it. After 10 o’clock in the evening, the male waiter in the hotel lobby questioned the room number, saying that the safety issue at night must be reviewed, but the attitude is poor, which is not the professionalism of high-end hotel service practitioners at all.

You can see Liede Bridge and IFC if you can't see the waist. I don't care much about the waist, so this landscape is completely acceptable.
Coffee machine, microwave, all. Therefore, it is also very leisurely to invite friends to drink tea and coffee in the room, eat and bring your own afternoon tea. The sugar water in the evening was great, but unfortunately there are too many delicious dinners in Guangzhou.
The service is good, the housekeeper WeChat responds to every request, and the feedback speed is extremely fast, continue to add points.
In the end, the lighting in the room is on the safe side. Personally, I think it would be perfect if the hall on the first floor was brighter.

The biggest advantage is the height. Although the room is not very big, because of the height, it gives a good sense of space and is not depressing at all; the facilities in the room are relatively complete: hair dryer, coffee machine, bluetooth speaker, smart toilet, etc.; gym, swimming pool All are on the 6th floor, the swimming pool is not big, but it is passable;
Areas that can be improved:
1. The standard pillow is uncomfortable and has no support for the neck. You can ask the waiter to send latex pillows. I hope it will be standard;
2. I hope not to send fruit after 9 pm;
3. When it rains, the exit sign pasted on the ground leading to the swimming pool is very, very slippery, and it is easy to slip

msg:The most attractive thing about Jumeirah is the exquisite breakfast. This time, I ate breakfast for more than ten days in a row. The dishes are exquisite, the quality of the ingredients on the à la carte menu and the exquisiteness of the presentation are always on the line. The freshness and sophistication of other buffet dishes are also good. The chef at the noodle stall remembered me after cutting the apple for me once. When he went to the stall to ask for vegetables the next day, he took the initiative to ask me if I needed green apples today. I think that&#39;s the striking detail of Jumeirah&#39;s service. It may be that the steamed grains have lost their moisture and sweetness due to the long-term steaming of corn. I hope to change the way of storage. The blanched lettuce has some dry leaves that have not been cut off. The varieties of steamed points have not been changed for more than a year. I hope that as a hotel in Guangzhou, some traditional Cantonese refreshments can be added or replaced as special dishes in the dim sum category, such as chicken feet, pork ribs, and thousand-layer belly. When I checked in last year, occasionally freshly made dim sum was distributed to the guests. I remembered that I had eaten red bean double-skin milk, Indian steamed buns and freshly baked egg tarts. Not anymore. The service enthusiasm of the overall staff in the restaurant has dropped a lot compared to last year. First, no one will greet you warmly and take a seat when you enter the restaurant. Originally, the ziplock bag with masks and disinfectant wipes are standard when you are seated, and now guests need to take the initiative to ask for it. will give. Paper towels will not be offered voluntarily. The original service is very proactive, and the waiters will observe the needs of the guests, such as adding tea. Most of them are now passive services. Especially when the guests leave after the meal, almost no one will say goodbye and walk slowly. Even walking by is ignoring. In such a stark contrast, Lucky&#39;s service and enthusiasm are particularly warm. The tone is soft and enthusiastic, he speaks cordially and patiently with the guests, and the service is proactive and considerate. I thought she had just come here, but when I asked, she had been working for more than a year. Maybe other hotels have the same service, but it may be these small details that make Jumeirah the only luxury hotel in Guangzhou to score a high 4.9. It is because of the attention to detail that Jumeirah is Jumeirah, and I look forward to improving it next time I come.

If I have to pick some thorns, I personally think that the design of the swimming pool is a bit low, and it does not fit well with the hotel. Then the buffet breakfast on Sunday morning is too crowded with children and too noisy. On weekdays, this phenomenon should not occur. Special praise to the guest service manager beety for the whole process of caring service 🥰

I wondered how it was better than Four Seasons, W, Ritz-Carlton, Rosewood, and Hilton. I checked the Internet and found out that this is the brand of the Dubai Seven Stars Yachting Hotel. After I arrived at the hotel, I was not disappointed. I gave a full set of baby supplies, as well as a cute little tent. The 2-meter bed is super comfortable and the curtains are automatically drawn. After the 100% shading, Dyson's hair dryer is easy to use, needless to say, the swimming pool is the best in the hotel I have been to, that is, the water is cold in this weather, I drank the red dates and lotus seed soup given by the hotel at night, the baby said it was delicious Not only I like it, but my baby likes this hotel very much. He said that he would like to come to stay next time. The only downside is that the gate of the hotel is not easy to find. Help us put our suitcases on the taxi, I didn't have time to say thank you, here's a compliment to the door boy! I will bring the baby next time~

I really didn't put Jumeirah on the list at first.
But Ctrip Hotel has such a high rating, I was really curious, so I gave it a try.

Once you try it you will understand.
The "home away from home" feeling is top-notch.

3.5 meters high room is very comfortable. Although it is not very square, it still feels spacious and comfortable.
The bathtub location is very reasonable, and the shower is separated from wet and dry.
The bathrobe is soft.

Evening desserts and fruit and sugar water are not fooled.
Delicious. Amazing taste.
The cups that hold the tiramisu are also made of chocolate.
Makes the kid happy.

At the end of the check-out, a princess necklace was confiscated from the child, and the hotel also attached great importance to helping to return it.

My Guest Experience Director Sylvia～
I have been consulting her almost 24 hours a day, and they are all answered in seconds.
Attitude is good. Clear answer.

The pool was very cold that day, so I went up after two swims.
Not to mention experience.
But pretty.
There are plans to take the children to go again in the summer.

Afternoon tea service is meticulous.
Live music, the taste is flawless.

The semi-buffet breakfast service was also great.
On a rainy day, listening to the sound of the rain and the harp, watching the city view, and enjoying a delicious breakfast, I felt pure and satisfied in the early morning.

All in all, this stay was a happy experience.

The only regret is that the seven-centimeter high heels I wore that day may not have been opened due to the epidemic. When I entered the door, the waiter did not help to push the door for some reason, which made it a little embarrassing and laborious for me to push the door.

Will definitely recommend to friends and will stay again.

msg:The hotel is very new, the floor is very high (visually more than one meter higher than other hotels), the hygiene and supplies are very good, there are illy capsule coffee, bose bluetooth speaker, dyson hair dryer, flush toilet with night light.
The hotel's room service is in place, sent a small camel to the child, and also sent welcome fruit and sugar water (the sugar water tastes very good).
It is suggested that the double bed can be larger, and the hotel shares the parking lot with AutoNavi Land Winter Plaza. Due to the construction in some areas of the parking lot, the exit cannot be found directly from the same floor of the hotel parking lot, but must be opened first. To minus three (we still can't find the exit after two circles in minus three, and finally go to the next floor and go to minus four and circle half a circle to find the exit, it's amazing...), and the hotel has no indication signal at all, we go around Circle to find someone to ask before asking. The construction is a hard injury, but the hotel did not take the initiative and soft coordination to clear mines in advance, which shows that the management is not mature enough. Hope to improve.

msg:A great hotel experience! Due to the epidemic, there was no way to go out, so I had to choose to stay in a local hotel in Guangzhou as a Spring Festival travel 😆. I heard from friends about the high-quality service of Jumeirah Hotel Guangzhou. The hotel is low-key, luxurious and cost-effective, so I came to experience it temporarily. I don’t know the real face of Mount Lu, but it’s just because I’m in this mountain. In fact, the hotel is opposite K11, next to AutoNavi Landmark Winter Plaza. I work nearby, but I didn’t know there was such an excellent hotel🤣. The lobby of the Spring Festival Hotel is very a**ospheric and has a strong sense of festival. I booked a big bed room on the 52nd floor. The room is very spacious and comfortable. The window can overlook Baiyun Mountain, IFC, Haixinsha and so on. There is a shower in the bathroom to talk to you privately in the bathtub, and the mirror can even watch TV, it's really ignorant -_-||! The hotel distributes fruits, cakes, night sugar water, capsule coffee, etc., making customers feel at home. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that there is no heated swimming pool. I am very satisfied with everything else. I hope to have the opportunity to come and experience it again. Recommended!

Not long after the reservation, the lady called me to ask about the number of guests before checking in in Guangzhou. The explanations throughout the entire process were very considerate and gentle. As someone who often checks in to various five-star hotels, I may be a bit more detail-oriented, but Jumeirah's service attitude is really unparalleled, especially the lady ViVi who added WeChat and was very patient in all her responses. I give you a big thumbs up for your answer. I will definitely stay there next time I go to Guangzhou. Hahaha. The afternoon tea on the first floor is also delicious. I suggest you check in for the afternoon tea set. It needs to be booked in advance. I was in a hurry and ordered a la carte.

msg:First of all, I have lived in a common room alone the day before I stayed in Jumeirah Suite with my family. I am very satisfied with the experience. The suite is amazing, because the price is really high for this price. Slowly and personally, I called to apologize and sent afternoon tea. During the tea, the manager of the food and beverage depar**ent came to apologize again, and the service was extremely serious! Really warm! This hotel does not hesitate to help with takeout delivery, no matter whether you live in the cheapest room or the slightly more expensive room, so considerate. The room is low-key and luxurious, and the terrace is huge. It is enough to satisfy the children who have just been discharged from the United Family. It is really suitable for two nights to rest in this suite. The scenery is beautiful, but the space is large and comfortable. When you see the Guangzhou Tower, the entire CBD is Underfoot, it is too reluctant to leave. So I booked a one night stay and immediately renewed for another night.
The sanitation and even the terrace location are very neat and tidy. The traffic is very convenient, and there is no need to take the elevator. Will stay again in the future, for sure. Welcome to a plate of fruit! There are enough supplies for children, bed fences and tents are installed in advance, and the ceiling of the Guangzhou hotel is ready!

There is also a particularly warm red dates and dried tangerine peel stewed lotus seed syrup, which is prepared with a thermos cup and a bowl and spoon waiting for guests to drink. Super five-star bed sheets are folded, slippers are placed beside the bed, a rich fruit bowl is added at any time, Dyson hair dryers are waiting, and the spirit of super five-star service can be seen in the subtleties.

The overall hardware of the hotel is not bad, and the decoration style is restrained and refined. The duplex room booked is equipped with a microwave oven and an electric stove, but if you want to use it, you need to apply to the hotel. All aspects of the hotel generally reflect the value for money, but there is still a gap between the four seasons that have lived in the past: the elevator buttons are set too low and inhumane, the hotel landscape is not good, most rooms are blocked by a tall building in front of them, only Can peek into a small corner. The room area is not large enough, the bathroom design is unreasonable, the bathroom of the master bedroom upstairs is completely open, and the water outside is wet after taking a bath.

Whether it is sending quilts or sending tableware, or ordering takeout and sending it to the room, it is the only thing that is better than the same level hotel. Is the hotel's external landscape is not as good as other hotels, but the standard of service is OK
Afternoon tea in the hotel lobby and breakfast on the 6th floor, there will be people playing live. The dining environment is very comfortable. The only thing is that you can still put some tableware in the room. Very good, after all, some room types are designed for multi-person gatherings.

[Location] Located in the core business district of Zhujiang New Town, Guangzhou, close to Huacheng Plaza, next to GT Land Plaza, opposite to K11, the surrounding transportation, dining and shopping are very convenient.

[Room] Stay in the honorable double bed room, on the 51st floor, with a new Chinese style. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. Toiletries are easy to use. The Australian brand Biology, Dyson hair dryer, dressing table and desk are also separated. The wine bar is close to the window. , A good sense of space.

[Experience] The hotel butler is very considerate. He simply arranged the birthday ceremony in the room, prepared children’s daily necessities, children’s slippers and birthday cakes, and sugar water was delivered to the room every night; the hotel’s wooden room card was very special, which was in line with the hotel’s design Taste; afternoon tea set is also very good, can be delivered to the room.

The sanitary details are not very good. The whole process is very silky. Much better than the magnificent next to it!

msg:Jumeirah, a group with Dubai Burj Al Arab, hasn’t decided where to go tonight for New Year’s Eve. Hurry up and make an appoin**ent with your little sister and boyfriend. It’s a great choice to celebrate your birthday and New Year’s Eve here~

Book room type
I booked the duplex suite on the 53rd floor with a great view! !

Decoration style
Duplex suites are a bit like apar**ents

Praise praise:
When I checked in, the young lady at the front desk thoughtfully confirmed the birthday cake time with me, because I had an appoin**ent with the younger sister to celebrate her birthday, and found that there were not enough chairs in the room. I called the front desk and asked if I could send two more chairs. The hotel sent someone to move in immediately. 2 Zhang (the chair is really heavy). Maybe the hotel found that a few of us were not enough to give 1 small cake, and sent 2 to us. Jumeirah really did their best to achieve the best.

There is also snow fungus and almond stewed papaya syrup in the evening. It is said that a different syrup will be served every night. So heart-warming

The hair dryer is Dyson, no need to explain haha

Toiletries are matched with Australian brand Biology

If A is excellent, I would like to play A++, a hotel that exceeds full marks. Is the liveable series

I also gave birthday decorations and a birthday cake on the day of check-in. I gave a cake, but it didn't affect me at all. I gave a mascot when I checked in. I wanted to get another one. My little brother gave me another one. Breakfast is served in the restaurant on the 6th floor. It is a semi-buffet style and the environment is great. There will be bears to hug you. If I have to say that I am not satisfied, it is that there is no heated swimming pool, and I feel that the bath towels are not thick enough. Others are really not fussy, I strongly recommend everyone to stay.

msg:I have been to the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai ten years ago, and I was deeply impressed by the magnificent, high-end, luxurious and complete facilities of the hotel. Guangzhou Jumeirah Hotel and Dubai Burj Al Arab Hotel belong to the same hotel brand, designed by the same well-known international firm KCA, for this purpose, they will stay in an experience hotel. The design of the hotel is different from the design of the sailing hotel. It is reported that the inspiration comes from the Tang Dynasty. Embroidery and hollow elements, the super high lobby composed of three colors of black, white and gold, exquisite large crystal chandeliers, and elegant flower arrangements. Shows luxury and sophistication. The manager Luo Jialu at the front desk gave a warm reception, skillfully introduced the hotel and room facilities, and a gentle smile swept away the fatigue of my journey. The luxury-class service of the hotel is also reflected in the WeChat contact by the butler after check-in, one-to-one service, the hotel will try its best to satisfy the guests if there is any reasonable demand, and it is the first experience in a five-star hotel in China. The duplex suite on the 52nd floor is equipped with the world's top ten mattress brand Jin Keer mattresses founded in 1898, double toilets with separate dry and wet, oversized bathtubs, double washbasins that do not affect each other's washing, and embedded mirrors. You can watch various channels on the TV while brushing your teeth and washing your teeth, the century-old Japanese TOTO smart toilet, the Australian plant essence series of toiletries, Biology, the well-known British brand Dyson hair dryer, the world’s top ten speakers BOSE Bluetooth speakers, lighting facilities for adjusting the light source, small vases The flowers, fresh biscuits and fruits that exude an alluring fragrance are pleasing to the eye. At night, in the hotel room, you can see the colorful lights of the Guangzhou Tower and the bustling night scene. Go to the lobby lounge to taste the English afternoon tea with cheeks and cheeks, and admire the patience and meticulous work attitude of the Bella waiter. Go to the Schell restaurant for breakfast, a variety of delicacies and delicacies make people feast on. The swimming pool with blue water and the multi-functional gymnasium must be experienced. The hotel is located in the core business circle of Zhujiang New Town, surrounded by Guangdong Provincial Museum, Canton Tower, Guangzhou Library, Grand Theatre, TaiKoo Hui, and Guangzhou Friendship Shopping Center. It takes five or six minutes to walk to Metro Line 3 and Line 5, and it takes ten minutes to drive. To Guangdong East Railway Station. The hardware and services of Jumeirah Hotel are of luxury level. After staying in the hotel, it gives people a sense of comfort, comfort and pleasure, and it is worth staying again.

The hotel price is 3 for 4 days, excessive price adjus**ent, room facilities have problems, it is really speechless and should not be The problem occurred. However, the hotel’s service has kept up, the speed of handling problems, and the implementation of the plan can all be satisfied, and the service is one of my satisfaction. The entire duplex room is dark, and the lighting design is a bit unreasonable. Although it is full of high-level sense, it still needs practicality. The breakfast deviation of the hotel is a little bit less style. I think it can be updated. More styles, such a big hotel It should not be served with such a breakfast, it needs to be improved and improved. In addition, I don’t say much. The overall feeling is a bit deviated. Although the service is very good, it is only after doing something wrong to make up for it with the service. I think the management of the hotel needs to be strengthened, otherwise it will be eliminated. The room manager in the later period can follow up very well, and it is worthy of praise👍.

Gym:
The gym is shared with the apar**ent. I have to go to the other side of the apar**ent. I don't like it.

Room view:
The room is not in the first line of Zhujiang New City. Only some rooms can see Xiaoman's waist from the cracks. Whether you want to add money to see Xiaoman's waist is up to you.

service:
Each room will have an exclusive butler, and every night there will be desserts and welcome fruits, which is very considerate.

Room facilities:
The whole room is dark. However, the space is large, the buttons are smart, and the height is high. There are a lot of cups in the beverage cabinet, very delicate, and a complete range of beverages and coffee.
The bed is also easy to sleep. The bathtub has a headrest.
health:
Very clean and spotless.

breakfast:
The breakfast is semi-buffet, with more choices. A dazzling array. There are too few side dishes for Chinese porridge, not even pork floss.

Cost performance:
The overall price/performance ratio is still relatively high. I don't know if it is due to the epidemic or other reasons, there are not many residents, and the whole is very clean.

The children’s choice of duplex suite. Tell the hotel that there are children before check-in, and the hotel will carefully prepare tents, children’s toiletries and bathrobes in advance.
Upon arrival, the hotel check-in was super fast.
Entering the room is very pleasing to the eye. The room is larger than the photo on the official website. The upper and lower floors are very spacious, with high ceilings, and the floor-to-ceiling windows have excellent lighting views. There are toilets on both floors with showers, a large bathtub and cloakroom on the second floor, and a bar on the first floor. There are many types of drinks in the minibar, so you can make your own drinks if you have time. The above are all hardware aspects.
Food: The breakfast is semi-buffet, very hearty, and there are live performances of Guzheng (or Guqin?) in the restaurant.
Finally, the service is nothing to choose from. From check-in to check-out, the whole process is enthusiastic and thoughtful. The children camel dolls were given upon check-in, and sugar water, pastries, fruits, etc. were also given in the evening.
In short, I am very, very satisfied. I have been designated by the children as the only hotel to travel in Guangzhou~

Located next to the cbd is Autoland and k11 eating and shopping is very convenient
Hotel rooms are bigger than expected
A welcome gift is given after check-in. Fruits and cakes also have sugar water in the evening, which is very considerate.
Butler service when you check in
The swimming pool is not big but the kids are basically enough for fun
The 24-hour gym and perfect equipment deserve praise
Talk about what I hope to improve:
Although the capsule coffee machine was broken with illy, it was difficult to dispense water, but waiters came one after another and insisted that there was no problem (I also have it in my house, so I know that there is a problem with the water). Then I really didn't come to deal with it later) I think the waitress who doesn't understand these machines should send a technician to come and even replace it with another machine instead of nothing.
In addition, the hotel environment is not too big. It would be better if you add a children's indoor play area. After all, there are more parent-child trips.

The cute mascot, the camel, may also be related to Middle Eastern elements; there is a makeup mirror in the room, and the restaurant is accompanied by cute bears.

When I enter the door of this hotel, I feel a different kind of feeling. First of all, in terms of decoration, it is very tall and big, absolutely. Re-built, whether it is a public place or a room, it is very new and exquisite. Second, service. When entering the lobby, the staff is very polite and the service is very caring.

msg:Jumeirah Guangzhou’s rating on Ctrip is 4.9. I am looking forward to staying, but the actual experience and the various details of the hotel are very difficult to satisfy. 4.9 is a good reputation, and 4.5-4.6 is more in line with the actual experience.
Let me talk about the advantages:
1. The hotel staff has good service attitude and patience. Fruits and turn-down snacks are welcome.
2. The hotel decoration materials are luxurious, the hardware foundation is good, touch buttons, Dyson hair dryer and the like, the bed quality is good, the place where marble can be used is basically marble, anyway, it is the method of stacking.
3. The breakfast buffet is abundant, the a la carte part is online, and there are people behind to help you play the harp.
split line
Next, let's talk about the disadvantages:
1. Wonderful elevator button position: The button position of the hotel elevator is obviously low. For adults of 1.7 meters, they need to bend down to reach the position on the first floor. The taller friends are estimated to be more uncomfortable, and the buttons on both sides of the elevator are the same short. It is estimated that at the time of the design, a special person was arranged to help press the elevator, otherwise this thing is for children. (figure 1)
2. Strange apar**ent design: The area of the room is actually big enough, deep and wide enough, but in a crazy waste of space, a TV is installed in the middle of the washbasin, and the distance between the two washbasins is astonishing one meter, and In order to shape the vanity countertop is very low, the basin is particularly high. The entire length of the washing area can run inside, but there is no cloakroom. (Picture 2 and Picture 3) What is even more exaggerated is that there is a pillar by the window, and there is actually a lot of space behind the pillar.
3. Disadvantages of the high-rise building: Many comments are saying that the height and the sense of openness are good, but I posted two pictures (pictures 4 and 5). I don’t know if there are independent ventilation facilities in this area, which led to the hotel’s notification (Figure 6) that the water vapor is okay. Everyone knows if anyone goes to the toilet smells a lot. In fact, it is easy to explain that the top partition is not made. After all, the normal hotel storeys can't be so high. If you want to do the top, you can do special-shaped design and construction, and the cost will increase. Moreover, the high-rise building and the long and narrow room type, the color matching of Hermès gives me the illusion of an Arab tomb.
4. Small mosquitoes: When I checked in, I was surprised by small mosquitoes when I took a nap. Later, the hotel was disinfected, but the mosquitoes appeared again at night. Forget it, I lay flat and lay flat. Later, I was confident that a study found that, It turned out that the small insects were brought in from the fruit plate. The fruit plate provided by the hotel was honest and kind, including strawberries, grapes, and dragon fruit, but for unknown reasons, small flies also came in. (Picture 7)
5. Insufficient desk area in the room: In order to set up a symmetrical dressing table, the hotel room wasted a lot of space. The table is very small. If you put a rich welcome gift, you can’t work. If two people move in, you and It is estimated that your colleague will have to work separately on the dressing table on both sides of the bed, and there is no socket at the round glass table. (Picture 8)
6. Dangerous design: The hanging lights on the left and right desktops are no problem for pressing the switch on the bed, but if you bend down and press the switch, you may hit your head when you look up. The bathroom door is clearly written to push, but the actual push and pull can be opened (Figure 9).

In short, if you have high expectations and live in the mood of experiencing a perfect hotel, you will definitely be disappointed, and you will not be friendly to friends with office needs. From an experience point of view. The score of 4.9 is indeed high, but if you compare it to hotels of the same level, his prices and discounts are a bit expensive. After all, they are all in Zhujiang New Town, and you don’t even have a view of the Guangzhou Tower. Are you a little bit at a loss?

msg:Because the epidemic unit did not give Guangzhou City, I thought about booking a hotel during the Mid-Autumn Festival as a tourist. I considered Majestic, Mandarin Oriental, and accidentally saw Jumeirah’s ratings, so I decided to book one. This decision is really true. It’s correct. First of all, the service is very good, not excessive, but they are all in place. The rooms are quite large and very airy. They are equipped with a coffee machine, the bathroom is separated from dry and wet, and there is a bathtub and a hair dryer. Sen, if it's not for work, I would like to stay one more night! By the way, there is syrup in the evening, which is really delicious. I gave a box of moon cakes to the Mid-Autumn Festival!

Can you get out of the surrounding area?
🔔Service: The service is really awesome! When booking the room, I noted my birthday, I also prepared small cakes 🎂, and suddenly delivered red bean paste, and also delivered the hotel’s 🥮, which was also delicious! Lucy is very responsible. He told all kinds of matters before arriving. If there is a demand during the stay, he will respond quickly~
I was originally entangled in several hotels of the same grade, but I was really attracted by Jumeirah’s ultra-low reviews. After I checked in, I couldn’t help feeling, no wonder~
I should choose next time I come to Guangzhou

It feels like a resort hotel. The hotel facilities are very new, and the design is very careful and tasteful. Needless to say, the lobby rooms are not even beautiful, even the elevators and public toilets.
I tried every restaurant in the hotel, the things are very exquisite, and the price is very high, the service is really super good, they are all gentle, and they are very attentive and kind. Basically, one person looks after two tables and closes. Son, it's very timely to add water or something.
The guest rooms are above the 50th floor, and the height of each floor is also super high, at least four meters, and there are floor-to-ceiling windows on one side of the room. The scenery is really not too amazing! ! You can see a super beautiful sunset. The room was cleaned very cleanly, the quilt and pillows didn't smell at all, the facilities were all electronically controlled, and it was very quiet, and the air conditioner could hardly hear the sound. Sleeping in a few days is better than at home. There are WeChat butlers, there are takeaway couriers that deliver everything to the room, and they deliver different sugar water every day.
The hotel also has an outdoor swimming pool! ! There are many places to do or lie down, and the poolside bar is always open for ordering cocktails and eating. Surrounded by tropical plants, it really feels like an island in the city! I really love it! !

Beety also took care of us during the morning meal and asked about the rest and meal.
The spa was changed several times because of the wife's health. The housekeeper and service staff were very patient, and set the time with us, and the technique was also very good.

All in all, the room, service and environment are highly recommended. Come again next time.

The handsome and beautiful women, invincible, warm and thoughtful, entered the room. It is full of texture, with wooden floors and high spaces. For the first time, I saw that even the bathroom was paved with wooden floors, and even the room card was made of wood. The bedding is also very comfortable. Betty, the guest experience supervisor, will ask about the guests every day, and also note their preferences. The sweet soup every night is even more exciting, and it will not be perfunctory because it is a free gift.
Let's talk about transportation. There are many shopping malls & restaurants around, and the subway is also convenient. You can see the Canton Tower, Haixingsha...
All in all, there are many advantages. If you have to pick something regrettable, you just don’t get the promotion preferential trea**ent as the comment says. There is a little loss...

It's the Jumeirah Hotel! I use the most authentic staying experience to comment on Jumeirah Luxury Hotel! 1 The room hardware is very complete and outstanding, aromatherapy lamps, double wash basins, a full set of tools for making cocktails in the minibar, bose sound, full touch button intelligent guest control, and the height of the room is as high as 4 meters! Hair dryer Dyson and more! Simply kill all hotels in Guangzhou! 2 The hotel butler has a good service attitude, cold and warm, considerate service, welcome fruits, good night syrup, responsive to requests, and return a free upgrade of the room type! 3The breakfast is exquisite. Although there are not many types of breakfast, it is very delicate and very ceremonial. The food is of high value and there is a bear on the chair, which is very cute! Finally, let me talk about the manager on duty at the front desk. I gave a free afternoon tea worth more than 400 (it feels like a big bargain haha). The young lady is beautiful, kind-hearted, speaks nicely, and behaves elegantly, so I am at Jumeirah Hotel. Give 101 points! So there are two things you should not forget when you come to Guangzhou for business trips, eating and sleeping and staying at Jumeirah Hotel!

msg:Let me talk about the evaluation first: bad review! Not recommended! At nine o'clock in the morning, the official staff of the hotel (the kind in suits), not cleaning. Swipe card directly into my room. At that time, I was nothing but confused. Fortunately, I was packing my luggage and planning to go out. I was fully dressed and nothing more embarrassing happened. What's more interesting is that the guy who broke in was also surprised at first, and then asked me calmly if there was any change of clothes to deal with... It seemed that he looked down on my IQ. According to normal logic, it is a bit trained to confess that you have made a mistake and sincerely apologize. After a few perfunctory words to me, the young man closed the door and left, and I waited for the manager's call in the room for half an hour alone. It seems that this slippery guy still intends to get away with it. As a last resort, I informed the guest room about this. Of course, the follow-up is the process of professional apology, giving small gifts, free upgrades next time and so on. But this kind of service training, if you have a brain, you will continue to live next time. If you have a luxurious shell, the service will only apologize. I really don’t know where I spent the premium money for staying in a luxury hotel🤷‍♂️, Zhuo Goodbye Maya. Thanks to this experience, I have a topic worth sharing with friends.

雖然房間看不到廣州塔，但是由於樓層夠高，望出去嘅景觀也很美。
另外酒店的微信管家服務非常好，基本上都是秒速回答！無論什麼時候他們都在線回答我的問題，及立刻幫我安排，非常感謝他們的用心服務！
另外每晚的糖水服務也非常貼心，每晚都有唔同的糖水，三晚都沒有重複，喜出望外！
這幾天在廣州都是下雨，下雨，和嚴重暴雨，雖然天氣唔好沒有出外欣賞廣州的風景，但是留在酒店房也很享受，因為房間實在太舒適

      唯一槽點必須要説一下:卧室的空調出風口居然是正對床的枕頭，雖然房頂很高，幾乎沒什麼風，但是還是擔心吹到頭，所以睡覺的時候是關了卧室的空調，讓客廳空調開着，冷氣飄進來的。對這個設計空調的腦回路十分不解，那麼大地方，為什麼非要把出風口設計在床頭？
      早餐一般，不過因為周圍好吃的太多了，倒也不算什麼缺點。總體優秀，是個還會再去的酒店。

前台，管家服務熱情。特別表揚退房離開的時候，在電梯口遇到保潔阿姨，阿姨熱情打招呼，看我推着行李，問我是不是退房了，還貼心提醒我記得收衣櫃的乾洗的衣服，這才想起來衣服我忘記拿了，省了回去再聯繫酒店郵寄的過程，表揚！

1、服務，從邁進大堂開始，就有工作人員主動詢問是否幫忙拿行李，之後的每一天遊玩回酒店都會主動問好，並幫你按電梯。
2、房間，反正我這間真的很寬敞，雖然不是方方正正的格局，但乾淨整齊，東西都很齊全。衞生間的鏡子也可以播放電視，化粧的時候也不無聊。
3、其他，房間整體樓層都很高，可以俯瞰廣州市景，每天訂外賣，都很麻煩小姐姐送上來，但服務很好都是第一時間送上來。每晚回到房間還有糖水送到桌子上。
對面就是K11，遇到極端天氣也不愁沒地兒逛吃。地鐵交通都蠻方便的。整體真的挺滿意的。

        再説説不足吧：去的時候恰逢下雨，大堂有非常濃的潮濕黴味，第一感官很不好，個人覺得如此高星級酒店是不該出現的；房間智能控制系統用着方便，但是凌晨會自己亮起來，發藍光，這個就有點嚇人了；床頭兩個吊燈沒有辦法完全熄滅，一晚上都以極其微弱的光亮着；空調低轉速噪音也不小；最後想説的是，一對一的賓客服務，有種服務了又沒完全服務的感覺，因為一切更像是固有的流程，而並非客人實際的需要，對於硬件上不足的補救是下次再入住的時候可以免費升級，可以作為家庭出遊，短期之內還會選擇廣州嗎？對於所有的不滿不是應該在客人離店前解決嗎？難道還期待客人帶着不滿的情緒下次再選擇這家酒店嗎？

msg:作為一年住上百聯號酒店的人來説，廣州卓美亞印象深刻，它既不像其它奢牌酒店，時時刻刻提醒住店客這裡是冰冷的酒店，反而多了一份家的舒適感和落定感，同時，卓美亞的設計和品質，又保持在一個國內酒店超高的水準，這是在國內讓我最喜歡的酒店之一

msg:特別優秀！到廣州之前，無論攜程和小紅書都做了不少攻略，看見很多大V和資客都力推卓美亞，帶着嘗試的心理選擇了春節大假期間連續入住兩個晚上。酒店非常貼心，定的尊榮大床房，按協議給加了一張1m2的單人床。房間用的全原木結構，隔音和舒適度一流，洗手間淋浴區也是木質地板，不僅不遺水，還防滑，光腳踩在上面也沒有冰涼感。空調温控很棒，無論在什麼狀況下，都能適應體感調試到最舒適的狀態。卓美亞酒店雖然沒有最好的江塔景，但卻有最細緻周到遊刃有餘的管家服務，和最卓越的床鋪舒適度，我一般情況下，對環境適應度差，出門在外正常情況會有一到兩晚無法入睡，這一次顛覆了以往的感受。不僅第一晚就睡着，而且入睡很快，自己都沒意識到就睡著了。卓美亞的床品無論後半部、軟硬度和温感都特別適宜，給人一種在家裡入睡的感覺。物超所值

晚上我提出要加一床被子（有個人睡沙發），結果，酒店客房告訴我，所有被褥配發光了。毯子也沒有了。
在我打了兩次電話催促後，給我送來一個小童薄被（1米5長），能蓋個半截身子。
並且客房人員説，給我一條床單湊合。
當天廣東温度0度。
請問，我空調開到多少，來禦寒？
五星酒店能夠被褥都配發光了，是什麼誇張的情況？
很榮幸，第二天，兩人感冒中槍。
再來，兩個小童，從辦理入住就提出要小童洗漱。一直催到晚上10點才送過來。
我衹能怪自己，沒去對面住瑰麗，省了1000塊。

卓美亞在中國生根，最好的土壤應該就是廣州。

房型挑高，景色怡人，50層以上，完美。硬件設施夠硬。

早餐推薦！建議每天去把菜單上的吃個遍，哈哈哈哈。這個餐廳也對外開放，人均還七八百呢。唯一不足的地方就是，對外開放了以後，位子不夠坐，有一天早上下去的時候我們住店的反而沒有座位了…導致衹能歪腰坐在喝酒的小桌子，要求等有空桌了換過去，服務員説那邊的桌子衹適合一個人，我們兩個人不適合，愣是不給換…我想説，適不適合是我們自己認為的，再説了桌子明明配的兩個椅子…
另外，酒店外部泳池不好使。淋浴不好用，好在立馬來修好了。

環境挺不錯的大堂很漂亮瑰麗柏悦四季都在那一片周圍很便利
層高可能有四米顯得室內空間很大
1門僮沒有主動意識不會主動開車門同伴手裡提着的包到前台都沒有人幫忙提而禮賓台站了一堆人，到了還沒房就先寄存行李出去覓食，回來在禮賓台，三個人在那我説拿行李他們在那找了幾分鐘，也不知道説等下我幫你送上去還要我自己開口。主動意識真的是和普通酒店拉開差距的一點
2迷惑的夜床，拖鞋不擺兩邊衹擺了一邊而且沒在床頭放水和水杯。
價格我覺得實惠的所以沒有給差評，希望酒店能加強一下員工培訓，這樣酒店能更好。

msg:因為是大床房換雙人床，酒店通知是衹有愛心雙人床，沒有正常的雙人房房間。詢問後得知愛心雙床衹是衞生間等設施矮一些。於是就訂了。入住後才發現房間結構不是很好，很壓抑。窗户空間基本用不上，呈倒三角，後附圖，這個是硬傷。另外，卧室正對衞生間馬桶，推拉門又又不隔音，而且推拉撞擊聲音很大，很納悶貼個隔音棉又能防止噪音又可以防止碰撞，為什麼細節工作沒人做呢？酒店應該反思一下。 另外，浴室居然和洗漱間僅僅一張簾子隔開，不是到是愛心房獨有還是和其他房間一樣，這個因為房間不帶滿意也就沒有續住了，所以沒有對比。用一個簾子隔離，這個設計讓人大跌眼鏡，無法與5星酒店聯繫在一起，不知道酒店用意何為。 
個人感覺酒店以中式，木質傢俱為主，應該是打造中式，奢華的感覺，但是推拉門噪音，衞生間和浴室的簾子，以及敞開的淋浴間和洗面台徹底讓簡約變成了簡單，讓奢華變成了大眾。最後，睡衣上的其他客户留下的頭髮居然還在，這點着實不應該。
功過兩評，聯繫酒店有小童一起入住，準備了玩具和小童洗漱用品，這點多少彌補了我的遺憾。希望酒店用心對待客户，也建議大家訂愛心雙床的時候留意房間結構的硬傷，避免訂到這類房間。

給個建議：雖然入住率比較高，但需要加快房間打掃速度，下午三點入住已經不算早 但還會遇到房間沒打掃好的情形。

設施方面，樓層挑高很高，房間裏配有戴森吹風機，但洗護用品是不知名品牌，提供換枕服務。泳池室內室外兩個還不錯。早餐有很多可以點餐的種類還不錯。

在入住期間，曾有別的客人刷房卡進入了我的房間。萬幸的是，當時我也在房間裏，因此才未造成進一步損失。酒店對此的解釋是客人在前台補房卡時記錯了房間號。我無法接受這樣過於牽強的解釋。前台補房卡的時候難道沒有任何的核對措施？如果真是如此，廣州卓美亞的管理能力還不如廉價酒店，更別談與廣州第一梯隊的文華、瑰麗、四季等酒店相比。

1.酒店環境設施很好，房間設施很好，還用心佈置了小童小帳篷，贈送了一個玩具和小童洗浴用品，衞浴用品很好，牙刷一般，其它梳子之類都好
2.第一天贈送兩杯甜羹，第二天贈送一杯如果需要兩杯就加錢購買，第三天正常贈送甜羹但是忘記了調羹就是勺子
3.房間每天都會打掃，保持衞生整潔
4.早餐要注意時間到點就拆了
5.我最差的體驗就是第二天早上唯獨吃了不一樣的食物吃了兩片三文魚蘸了芥末，吃完早飯後有點胃噁心，後來在其他地方喝了一杯現榨的鮮橙汁，吃午飯之前上廁所拉稀了，後來就胃絞痛，整夜疼的發汗，持續胃疼和拉稀，吃了葯整個人幾天都沒力氣，第三天掛水後才好些，給大家一個提示遇到這種情況第一時間報警，一定要報警！

msg:還是客觀評價吧。
一年多前入住尊榮大床房，房間設施、給孩子準備的帳篷、玩具、甜品，都給我們留下很好的印象。
此次帶着這種很好的印象，再次預訂尊榮大床房，我入住的是55樓5517。實話説，房間比原來小很多，電視機緊挨着床，坐在床上，電視與床僅隔一米。視野也僅有一扇窗看得到風景。我也反映房間比記憶中小，客服回答房間都是有50平的。
衹能説因為運氣不同，尊榮大床房會帶來評論里豪華大床房一樣的格局和感受。
今天客服也詢問，晚上睡得是否舒服。床品不錯，衹是房間地處樓梯盡頭，靠近工作人員工作室，不知是否這個原因，十二點至一點反覆聽到開門關門聲。
這次的小童洗浴用品也較一年前降級了。
雖然服務是不錯的，前台工作人員一直笑容可掬，管家也有數次微信問候，但一樣的價格，下次廣州行，應該比較難選擇卓美亞了。

首先隔音真的很差，在房間裏睡覺能被走廊或者隔壁聲音吵醒
在我按了請勿打擾的情況下，早上連續兩次敲門把我吵醒
行李要我自己拎上樓，工作人員態度都很冷淡，之後來廣州再也不會來住

從一下車就感受到禮賓小哥熱情的歡迎目光，立刻主動小跑前來幫我提隨行行李，一路清晰指引直至完成整個Check in過程，期間還簡潔明瞭介紹酒店的餐飲和其他健身游泳，SPA等基礎配備，非常專業高效！得知我和好友此行入住目的，特意贈送一衹白葡萄酒慶賀。
剛好到達時間是下午14點多午餐還沒吃，有機會可以一試廣州CBD酒店排名第一的大堂吧出品。選了靠窗的兩人沙發位置，景色好開闊環境安靜，中式典雅的裝設配上旗袍小姐姐的獨特演奏伴樂聲，用餐視聽體驗一流。出於好奇心詢問服務小哥是什麼小眾樂器，服務小哥全程不僅親切耐心解答各種疑問，對甜品和茶品逐一詳細介紹，考慮到稍後入住房間休息，特意推薦一款不含茶鹼的波斯茶，氣味獨特甘香令人一嘗難忘。
回到房間歡迎禮遇的水果和白葡萄酒很快送上，同樣的小哥服務一如熱情細緻。後續打電話的roomserive下單的香檳和小吃，也很快送到房間。
入住時瞭解到西餐廳正主推海鮮菜單，還有當季的生蠔，必須要好好試試~面對菜單眾多菜品選擇，餐廳經理Feren親自逐款介紹，特地推薦一款白葡萄酒搭配生蠔，推薦餐酒前體貼詢問平時的口味偏好，以及點菜分量。當季生蠔以及海鮮都會根據產地出產品質精選。
房間設計極具後現代感，設計空間和全房間的電器控制面板，都充分考慮到人性化和科技感。選用的洗護品牌是澳洲純天然無添加的，尤其是NO.304護膚霜使用膚感保濕滋潤，剛好遇上這兩天廣州起風了，膚感做到秒殺很多大牌，後續直接上粉底毫無壓力！一直還在頭疼出門太急沒帶面霜！
第二天一早要回程就沒機會體驗泳池和SPA，睡得太舒服還賴床起晚了~十分匆忙下樓辦理check out，前台小哥Alan一如既往熱情專業，還幫我們打車，後續出行行程時間立刻變得充裕寬鬆，十分完滿的好心情和出行體驗~
廣州卓美亞酒店，絕對有下回再見！

本來訂了3晚文華東方，被冷冰冰的服務和收停車費這件事情，搞得心情極糟。住了一晚毅然決定退房換卓美亞。

入住之後首先感受到的是前台和禮賓部等工作人員的熱情，對的這才是豪華酒店應有的面貌。進入房間後，因為想調整到另一個房型，酒店的工作人員也全場耐心陪同，仔細講解不同房間的優劣，很貼心也很專業。酒店也配備了專門的管家，及時響應，悉心解答我的每一個問題。

硬件方面智能馬桶，戴森吹風機標配，房間風格現代不落俗。照片為窗外風景。

早餐非常好，每天有變化，看得出很用心。好評。

早餐是半自助形式，食物選擇不算太多但主菜即叫即做，味道很好。
特別提及的是，酒店有提供管家服務，非常窩心，經微信溝通，有什麼需求都可直接聯繫。
整體這三日兩夜我和我先生都十分滿意。

msg:作為一家上榜奢華酒店，硬件是OK的，特別是晚間糖水和半自助早餐，聽着豎琴演奏進餐真的很舒服。但有一説一，服務方面我覺得遠遠達不到奢華酒店的標準。先説辦理入住的人員，雖然帶着口罩，但是是否有微笑是可以感受得到的，反正我是感受不到。遇到走廊客房收拾衞生的阿姨，對客人視若無睹，更不用説主動熱情打招呼。難道冷漠與酒店所謂的低調奢華對等意思？最後要説的事情我有一半責任，我把卸粧乳落在酒店右邊洗手盆的旁邊了，但退房後沒有人聯繫我讓我回去拿，我打電話給酒店，酒店説找不到，難道自己跑掉了？
總的來説，網上最高評分名不符實，對比之下旁邊四季的體驗會更好。

環境：酒店大堂是妥妥的土豪設計感，房間設計簡單但不失格調，唯一不足的地方是房間被前面的建築物擋住了視線，完全看不到小蠻腰

服務：值得一提的是，夜間糖水很符合時節，是去花消暑的五花茶，服務員得知我們帶了兩位小孩，還主動多給了一壺糖水，這個是比較人性化的服務？

服務也給到了驚喜，入住前就接到客服beety的電話詢問房間要求，並全程跟蹤服務，很貼心。
室外泳池非常贊，提供了各種水上玩具，小朋友玩得很開心。
房間設計很好，有電磁爐、烤箱、戴森吹風機等非常實用的電器供使用，贊👍
緊鄰高德置地、K11等商場，逛街購物很方便。
如果酒店餐飲方面能再提高一些就完美了。

各位千萬不要去游泳池，簡直是一場災難。

因為定的一個小的loft
一邊辦公一邊看風景 入住還有送一個小玩偶
切辦理入住時候是坐下來的 體驗很好
還有服務很好的前台小哥哥小姐姐會把外賣送到門口 晚上每天有不同的糖水送到房間
入住沒多久發現樓下的小洗手間智能馬桶也不好用 遙控器按了沒反應 不過這些都不能磨滅我對這個房型的喜歡 都是小問題
開心到12點準備睡覺了去洗澡 大無語事件發生了
淋浴有問題 雖然有很多花樣 什麼熱帶雨林模式 
但是打開關不上 且頭頂的牆上反向噴水 第一時間聯繫了前台 前台派了一個設施維護的工作人員上來看 看了一下説是我使用方法不對 然後演示給我用 結果自己也是弄不明白 二樓的洗手間淋浴花灑邊上就是一個燈 水一直反向朝燈和牆噴射 牆皮也脱落了   且存在漏電風險 給出的第一方案是 今天先這樣 不要洗了 明天再説 在我的否定要求下 説是同等級換一件房間  由於通行朋友對酒店處理問題的態度不滿意 又聯繫了前台 前台説是做一個房型升級 當晚值班經理 經理過來就更神奇了 對我們提出的要求退房 或者升級房型提出了異議 説設施有問題不是他們的問題 難道是我的問題嗎 並且在朋友提出如果不能妥善解決就退當晚房錢時候 經理表示可以 但是要我們馬上搬出去 （ps:凌晨2點）本來想着無所謂的 小事情 但是這種態度確實讓人火大 最後在各種協商下換了另一個貴一些的房型 我是無所謂房型問題因為那個loft 我是很喜歡一進去有一箇中島台 可以吃飯辦公 但是作為五星級酒店態度就無語  然後在值班經理的一再勸説下搬去了酒店所謂的唯一能看得到廣州塔的房型 些許有點一言難盡 剛從四季走出來 換到一個所謂的隔着兩個樓看廣州塔的房型沒什麼想法  最後又贈送了早餐加下午茶 此事了結 但是我還是鍾愛我訂的小複式 真的很🉑 如果沒有這段插入這應該是除了廣州新開的凱賓斯基以外我最喜歡的酒店

不過下午茶味道超出預期 雖然是在大堂 環境就一般 但是味道不錯 早餐的鹼水面也是yyds
