Room looks old and not well maintain; water stains, pale wooden door, old and rusty balcony door, dusty curtain and etc. Booked for a non-smoking room but still can smell smoke coming from air con ventilation.

Extensive Gym equipment and they were very well maintained. Gym staff was friendly and polite.

room was close to an AC outlet so it could be noisy when you sit on the balcony. The noise insulation was not great: there were children running around on my corridor so it was difficult to sleep. I could hear every door slam on my floor.  It is worth noting that the hotel does not have a beach so the views aree awesome but I couldn't sit on and swim at the beach. Definitely a good hotel for families. Maybe not so much if you want to do things within walking distance from the hotel.

Especially air conditioner  are quite noisy. When booking ocean view rooms one should make sure to book from 9th floor upward. Otherwise you get ocean facing rooms but view on the front row building.
Traffic situation is not easy. Consider in peak time DiDi ir taxi services may need  20-30 min to arrive at the hotel due to traffic jams.
During Chinese New Year very expensive - rates are not justified by quality

 greenery and a stunning view of the sea from the balcony, making it the perfect place for a relaxing and rejuvenating family vacation.


One of the highlights of our stay was the exceptional service provided by the front desk assistant, Charlene. She was extremely helpful, warm, and charming and spoke excellent English. Charlene was very professional and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable. She was always willing to offer recommendations and assistance, which made us feel welcome and valued as guests.


Another memorable experience was at the cafeteria, where we met Gucci, who was exceptionally helpful and recommended many delicious dishes. The food at the JW Marriott Hotel in Sanya was truly outstanding, and we enjoyed every meal we had during our
 stay. From breakfast to dinner, the menu offered a wide range of options, and each dish was beautifully presented and tasted incredible.


The hotel itself is a marvel of modern design and luxurious amenities. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with every possible comfort thoughtfully provided. The view of the beach from the first floor was breathtaking, and we spent many hours relaxing
 on the balcony, taking in the stunning scenery.


Overall, our stay at the JW Marriott Hotel in Sanya was exceptional in every way. The level of service provided by Charlene, Sweet and Gucci was exceptional, and the food was outstanding. The hotel's environment was a perfect blend of natural beauty and modern luxury, providing the perfect backdrop for a memorable vacation. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience in Sanya.

The pool was tidy and expansive. Loads of sun beds and inflatables were available too. 

The one downside is that the hotel was advertised as beachfront which is technically true but it it extremely rocky and difficult to reach. A more suitable beach however is just minutes away.

The nearby area is about 10 mins walk away. This suited us because the hotel was quiet and spacious. There are a number of restaurants and convenience stores nearby.

Overall this was a great hotel stay and was worth the money.

They have a fleet of student interns, who do not speak any English of course but very eager to help as well. Vita from IT helped me so much when I encountered technical problems with my laptop. The Spa services here are much cheaper compare to many other hotels. Gym is great too. Pool is good, but water is hot these days. Breakfast is nice like at any Marriott. They have a nice tropical garden for walking and a nice lobby with cool fountains, water streaming, sitting areas were extremely comfortable when I needed to rest between trips here and there.

The service is ok but slow, which if not what I expect from the Marriott chain; when in the cafe the staff didn‚Äôt know how to work the till, causing me to wait over 5 minutes for them to process my very cheap purchase. Also the hotel staff refused to help when I asked for assistance in procuring a driver to take me to an activity further afield than the typical excursions Sanya offers.

Good gym that's open 24/7 and also have a billiards room which for some reason shuts at 10pm.

The swimming pool is awful. It is not heated in the slightest and absolutely freezing, even in 24¬∞c weather. 
In terms of cleaning, the staff regularly forgot to provide some basics during housekeeping such as forgetting towels, new toilet paper and shampoo. The cleaning was quick but also quite careless.

The lounge for the drinks is nice but it can take up to 10 minutes to receive the order and the staff at breakfast regularly forgot to bring the coffees when they ask us what we wanted to drink.
Overall, the stay was acceptable but there was much that could have been improved upon.

The ocean view - is not worth the view, as it‚Äôs blocked by other buildings and the balconies do not provide much privacy. Rhee ware surrounding apartment and buildings with views directly into the balconies! 

In terms of service, this property felt short of the typical Marriott experience. Staff were not attentive and looked disinterested at best. Not one staff interaction stood out during our stay there.

Breakfast was another disappointment. The spread is wide, but most of the food is bland, and the organisation around seating arrangements was poor. 

The only positive was the spa service, as they had really good masseurs, and the setup in general had a nice atmosphere.

Overall a rather forgettable experience, would give it a miss and opt for another chain altogether in the future.

msg:Again a very nice experience. I love the pool area the balcony and the walking distance to the restaurants and bars at the beach. Even though the beach lost it‚Äôs charm after they closed and removed all the little shops and bars on the beach. Unfortunately the hotel cut down the offers at the breakfast buffet during the quiet time. But liliya was very nice and helpful to get arranged a cheese platter for me.
To improve: coffee quality in the room.

 Most of the rooms you can have beautiful look of the ocean, just at a certain Angle. 
It's only take  a 5-6 minute walk to the beach. I just loved the hotel breakfast. 
The hotel has some beautiful shops and cafe as well. 

I personally really appreciate and thanks Ms. SUNNY (front desk) that helped me a-lot with my invoices and room. Also thanks to Ms. Maggie. 
It's the right choice for holiday relaxation.

msg:We had a wonderful experience at the JW Marriott! Ceacer Zhou helped us to check-in but his services did  not stop there. He enquired about our stay every single day. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and that we enjoyed our stay. Ayi Alice cleaned our room and she did an exceptional job. She greeted us every morning with a big smile filled with so much warmth and sincerity. This hotel is so lucky to have these 2 employees! 

The buffet breakfast and dinner were delicious. The staff were also friendly and polite. 

Our kids loved the children's club! Lots of activities to do and a great way to keep the kids occupied for an hour or 2. 

We loved the swimming pool! It was clean and never overcrowded. 

Service at The Lounge was horrible. Whenever we ordered drinks we waited for a long time. One evening we waited for nearly an hour for our food. The waiter did apologise and gave us free beverages. We appreciated that but their service is poor and gives the hotel a bad name. 

The location is perfect and close to the beach and shops!  I recommend going to The Dolphin for delicious Western food. 

Overall, we had a wonderful stay and will definitely return!

The cleaning staff is also spectacular and go above and beyond to make my stay as positive as possible. 
Choice for the breakfast meets all requests. Western and Chinese dishes, very good coffee different art, bread and pastries European art, Not Chinese, lots of fruits and veggies every day. The quality of food is high. 
Swimming pool and children playroom both are very big and clean. No feeling that it's crowdy. 
I would advise to improve and strengthen the non-smoking hotel policy and to keep an eye on quests, as Chinese guests still smoked in pool area and near the indoor children playground, even they had their own kids nearby, no understanding for this issue. Pool staff and indoor playground staff didn't pay attention to it, and even after our complain they didn't try to help.

We are a family of 4 and the ocean view room served us well. The cleaning service was absolutely excellent- thank you to all of the staff who work tirelessly to maintain the very high level of cleanliness, you do an amazing job! 
Breakfast was an excellent experience also with a blend of Western and Asian. It does not finish until 11am- a fantastic treat for all holiday makers.
We spent our day by the pool- clean, well kept and great fun. Lots of families which means the kids can play together!! Another winner. The hotel does not have beach access but the beach at the bay is steep and the current is strong so we were much happier by the pool.
We also attended the dinner buffet with a large group of friends- again the service and food were excellent. Lots of great white wine and sea food, I highly recommend. 
The location of the hotel is just 1km from the main *****. There is an abundance of shops, bars and restaurants in the town and along the beach front. You can walk along the boardwalk from the hotel to the town- it is a lovely walk in the mornings.
All in all we had a fantastic time in JW Marriott. Jackie and his team were excellent hosts and we will definitely return. This hotel has a super location, excellent facilities and excellent service. Thank you for your hospitality.

Secondly, the hotel is located in the Dadong Bay scenic area, and taking photos outside the hotel or on the balcony of the room is absolutely a good choice.
In addition, the Chinese and Western breakfasts are rich in variety, nutritious and delicious, and there are also Hainan-style teas.

But the only drawback is that the service response time is slightly slow.

In short, if you come to Sanya for a trip, JW Marriott Shanhaitian is worth the first choice.

The housekeeper Andre's service is good. He will patiently ask if there are any other needs. The child suddenly had a fever. Andre, the housekeeper, was very concerned and sent the hospital address and suggested timely medical treatment. It was really heartwarming. He also said that it is best to go to the hospital if the child has a fever. I feel relieved. I am very touched. When a mother is careless, there is such a careful housekeeper. The journey is really less worrying. The reply is timely and online at any time. It is very good. Then the reply is very timely, and the problem is solved quickly. The hotel scenery is good. The housekeeper Andre contacted in advance before check-in. Not bad [love][love][love]

Five stars for the butler ANDRE üëç. The check-in at the front desk was also very fast, and the luggage was delivered to the room for help. On the day of check-out, I took the initiative to contact me to ask if I needed a free late check-out. Very considerate service üëç Although I am not a Marriott member, I was also given a fruit plate as a gift, which was a surprise.

Hygiene: The hotel lobby, restaurant, and rooms are all very clean

Facilities: The swimming pool is quite large and divided into adult and children's areas. It works until 10 o'clock at night. The gym equipment is very complete, and I want to talk about the details. The gym has water dispensers, bottled water, towels, and wet wipes. Bottled water and towels are prepared on each treadmill for guests to use. There is also a SPA center, which is a little expensive. I chose a foot massage and it felt good. At the end of the lobby, there is a children's playground on the second floor up the escalator. There is an executive lounge, but I am not a member and cannot enter.

Environment: The hotel is very green, the facilities are new, and the scenery is very beautiful. I stayed in the hotel for 3 days and 2 nights without leaving the hotel. I took a walk in the hotel and took pictures, and I felt very beautiful.

Let‚Äôs talk about 2 shortcomings:
There is no beach and no way to swim in the sea. If you have to go into the sea, there are rocks, which are very slippery and easy to fall.
The door of the gym is open and the temperature is set at 27 degrees. It feels very hot when you are sweating all over your body during exercise. It is okay for those who exercise while playing with their mobile phones. However, it will feel uncomfortable if they want to work out exclusively for an hour. I told the staff, but it had no effect. The door was still open the next day and the temperature was too high.
By the way, the Ctrip 2-night accommodation package I purchased came with a free photo session and a military hotpot (it‚Äôs just a bowl of sausage noodles, but it‚Äôs enough to fill you up). Very pleasant stay experience.

The service attitude of the hotel staff is great, and the doorman took the initiative to help with the luggage. Thank you very much! The hotel is not far from the beach. The swimming pool is empty and the restaurant is empty when you stay in the off-season. The only small drawback is that the room still has a little smell, after all, it is humid by the sea and the mountains.

The housekeeper Andre is very considerate and proactively communicates the needs in advance. He upgraded and arranged two sea view rooms with better views for us. Both are located on the 15th floor of the hotel. The overall sea view of Dadonghai from the room is the best, and the mountains, sea and green land are full of layers. The hotel facilities and services are in line with the usual standards of JW Marriott. You can also go to the infinity pool of the hotel next to it to swim and check in for photos. Next time when my relatives and friends go to Sanya for vacation, I will definitely recommend this JW Marriott.

The playground was great, and the children loved it so much that they stayed for a few days and extended their stay. The shallow and deep areas of the swimming pool are suitable for children to play. In short, if you don't want to go out with your baby, the hotel can meet all your baby's needs for a whole day. There are fewer dishes outside the buffet restaurant than inside at night, but there are resident singers, which feels very good. The cool breeze makes it easy for the children to get along and play together, and they are not afraid of falling on the grass. This is awesome!
Highly recommended!

The hotel is very cost-effective, and we upgraded the sea view room. The butler Andre provided great service, and there were fruits and red wine delivered to the room. I will stay here again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:I have been to Sanya 3 times. I chose Dadonghai for the first time and JW Marriott for half a day. I was not disappointed. With two children, the bed is 1.4 meters tall and is enough to sleep on. The oversized round bathtub is very popular with children. The package garden view room booked was upgraded to a sea view room on the highest floor on the 16th floor. The view is super good. The most important thing is that the hotel has a butler who contacted us one day in advance to ask about room requirements. The butler Andre's service is very good and the hotel is good. If you have any questions during the whole process, you can consult. The most important thing is that there are few people in the hotel and it is very quiet. There are much fewer people than Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay. You can enjoy the swimming pools of both hotels. The infinity pool on the top floor has a great view.

In addition, because I stayed with my parents, they gave me an extra breakfast, which was very considerate.

The hotel should be the closest hotel to the sea in Sanya. The sea is right next to you as far as the eye can see. The service is considerate and it is very worthy of praise.

Traveling in the off-season is extremely cost-effective

Thanks again to Eva for her help, which made my vacation comfortable and happy. The hotel is full of island style and I feel full of vacation~

msg:I upgraded to a sea view room directly after checking in. The scenery is really great. The beach next to the hotel is still very clean. If you walk towards the Dadonghai Sea, it will be a bit turbid. It has been cloudy these days. If it is sunny, you can just see the sunrise.
Except for dragon fruit and banana, all the welcome fruits are quite sour. Hainan‚Äôs fruits are so cheap, so Marriott shouldn‚Äôt save money here.
We were not allowed to wear hotel nightgowns for breakfast, so we were given a pink shawl, which I personally felt was not as elegant as a nightgown.
There is a dead fish on the platform around the second and third floors of Building G. It has been lying quietly for two days. I don‚Äôt know where it came from.
Overall, I still give good reviews. The butler Liz's service is good. The butler is very considerate. She answers all questions and responds to all requests. She changed the pillows and delayed check-out.

msg:The scariest hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. The hotel attendant probably holds a room card. If there is no response when knocking on the door at any time, he will directly swipe the card to enter the guest's room. When they delivered fruits during the day, they clearly stated that they would wait until we came back (it was already past the cleaning time and I thought they would not come in again), but they still placed the fruits in our room when we returned. The most exaggerated thing is at night, at 1 o'clock in the morning! Actually! There will be a male waiter who directly swipes the room card to enter our room! It was said that a data cable was provided, but without asking clearly (it was not the data cable we wanted) and without getting permission, we directly swiped the card in. We were really frightened and confused when we were in deep sleep. After being frightened, I had insomnia in the middle of the night. I can‚Äôt imagine how scary it would be for a girl to live alone. When we checked out the next day, no one from the staff apologized to us. It was so disappointing! We will not accept the conditions you mentioned in the future. I will still give negative reviews. You will upgrade my room type to me in the future. In the future? Will not come again!

The weirdest thing is that the waiter knocked on the door at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. This is too unacceptable. In short, the service is really matching. If the overall environment of the hotel is not good, I would not recommend staying there. Why would you choose a hotel with poor service at the same price?

msg:Overall quite satisfied. The hotel infrastructure is very good, and the garden and sea views are great. Especially the night view is better than Yalong Bay. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and there is an open rest space on the second floor. It has a roof to protect you from the sun, and the natural wind blows through it, which is very pleasant. The decoration of the room feels like it has seen some age. But the maintenance is relatively new. The hotel has been upgraded to a luxurious room. Although it is not a 180-degree sea view, it is still quite satisfactory. The room is also very big. The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not good, you can clearly hear the children next door making noise in the middle of the night. It is recommended whether guests with children and guests without children can be separated. The hotel arranged a WeChat butler, which is a good point for real-time docking service. However, it was said that we could check in at 1 o'clock in advance. In the end, due to the slow cleaning of the rooms, we did not get the room card until 3 o'clock. Fortunately, a Korean lunch was given for us to consume for an hour. In addition, it is not very boring to take pictures of the beautiful scenery around. Breakfast meets JW Marriott standards, so I won‚Äôt go into details. The gift part is also practical. The free travel photography experience is great. If LD is satisfied, I will be satisfied. The only thing LD had some complaints about was the soundproofing of the room and the cleaning and tidying up of personal belongings on the table. The hotel also provides an airport drop-off service, which is a great experience. Overall, I am very satisfied with the holiday.

She not only introduced the hotel's various service facilities in detail, but also provided personalized suggestions according to my needs, whether I needed to know about the surrounding tourist attractions or wanted to I was assisted quickly and accurately when making restaurant reservations. What moved me even more was that Ruby Butler also paid careful attention to my itinerary and took the initiative to arrange a pick-up vehicle for me to ensure that my trip was smooth. Throughout the entire check-in process, Ruby was enthusiastic, professional and attentive. No matter what needs I raised, she was able to solve them for me quickly and accurately. It can almost be said that everything was answered!
The facilities in the guest room are complete, clean and tidy, and the beds are soft and comfortable. Both parents are very satisfied. They really feel the warmth and comfort of home. Whether it is a business trip or a leisure vacation, this place is an ideal choice. Once again, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Marriott Hotel and the butler team for their attentive service, which made our stay a pleasant and unforgettable experience.

Luming at the front desk (I remember this name correctly, the little brother with glasses) helped me check in. He was not very nice at all. He helped me change rooms, added an extra bed, and most importantly, gave me room No. 888. I felt really surprised during the Chinese New Year. We were even more surprised when we arrived at the room. The balcony was very large and the scenery was great. You could see the entire Dadonghai Sea! During our stay, the housekeeper named Zheng was also very nice. She kept things tidy and put in a few extra bottles of water every day! When I saw him coming back, he held something in his hand and helped open the door! Children love this place so much. You can catch a lot of interesting sea creatures downstairs! The executive lounge is also pretty good, everyone is polite and you can have some simple meals! There is also a lion dance performance on the first day of the new year, which is very lively! If there is a flaw, it may be the breakfast. There is not much to eat. I hope it can be improved! Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Marriott again!
Facilities: It's okay. After all, it's a bit old. I want to point out in particular why there are no electric curtains. It's very difficult to pull such large curtains!

I would like to give special praise to the hotel butler Andre this time. The service is super warm and thoughtful, and he is always responsive to all requests! They took the initiative to provide us with fruits, rooms with balconies, gifts, etc. Overall, it was a very satisfying experience. The most cost-effective five-star hotel in Sanya is worth choosing!

Traveling is convenient, the coastal trail can go all the way to Dadonghai Scenic Area, and there are many restaurants along the way. There is no beach in the hotel, but you can go directly down the steps to catch the sea. There is one-on-one butler service during check-in. I like the butler Alex for helping with late check-out. The service is good. The indoor playground is huge and kids love it. It‚Äôs a cost-effective choice during the peak winter holiday season and I will choose it again next time. A place of tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle.

msg:I was quite satisfied after staying for two nights. They upgraded my room to Yinghaixuan. I was very satisfied with it. I liked it even more than the front sea view because it faced the Yintai Hotel and the beach. When I stayed at Yintai twenty years ago, , Yintai is still a place that people look up to and has its own exclusive beach. Now twenty years later, Yintai is submerged in the surrounding high-rise buildings. I have been to this beach dozens of times and witnessed its changes. Looking at the beach There are countless emotions. The round sofa on the hotel balcony is very nice to lie down and watch the scenery. You can enjoy the scenery without being exposed to the sun.
The concierge service is very warm and thoughtful. Cloud Butler solves problems very quickly and proactively. The breakfast is also very satisfying. The coffee made by the little brother is very delicious. It was a bit weak on the first day. The second day after I mentioned it to the little brother, it was very good. It matched my taste. Except for the mattress being too soft and the room being a bit old, everything was fine. I hope I have the opportunity to stay here again in the future.

msg:JW Marriott Shanhaitian,
The recommendation index is 4 and a half stars.
The hotel is very clean and the equipment is very nice. The butler LIZ's service is very considerate. She upgraded the room, gave us welcome fruits, and replaced all of us with latex pillows. Every day, she would warmly ask if we needed any help if we were not sleeping well.
The room was cleaned in a very timely manner. The cleaning aunties were so gentle and soft-spoken. Water and toiletries were replenished in a timely manner.
On the G floor, walk across the lawn and follow the railing to the left for 100 meters to the Xiaodonghai Sea and the National Coral Protection Area. You can catch the sea from 8 to 11 a.m. when you open the reef, you can easily harvest fat baby bread crabs, and there are many beautiful things. Little shells. The hotel also prepared flashlights for catching the sea.
In addition, the hotel‚Äôs travel photography is really great, very blockbuster, and you can also choose a horse-faced skirt or Dai suit.

The only inconvenience is that the location is a little out of the way. There are often traffic jams on the way to the hotel, so it is a bit laborious to take a taxi. It is better to wave directly at the hotel lobby door to call a regular taxi. If you leave early, it is recommended to book a car in advance. Otherwise, I would be anxious if I couldn‚Äôt get a taxi at the last minute and I was in a hurry. Ha ha.

Everyone‚Äôs common understanding is that the hotel is a brand, and no matter how bad the hardware and software are, it will not be bad. . So I decisively decided on the JW Marriott. Sure enough, what they said was right. Everything that should be in a long-established hotel is there. The room is clean and sanitary. It‚Äôs worth it! The well-designed lobby and the outdoor swimming pool and coastline are great!

The hotel is located in a quiet location, making it easy to go shopping. It is backed by Luhuitou and faces the Dadonghai Sea. At night, lying on the balcony overlooking the lights of thousands of houses in the distance, the place is quiet and only the sound of the waves is heard. It is really healing.

We truly feel what it means to feel at home. Thank you, JW Marriott Shanhaitian, here. Checking in was truly the most satisfying part of the entire trip.

msg:JW Marriott Hotel Sanya Dadonghai adheres to the tradition of Marriott and makes people feel at home in every detail, but hopes to do better in terms of service. For example, the front desk was able to check in a little faster. In fact, there were no other guests at the time. We were the only ones checking in. It seemed that the front desk was a little unfamiliar with the operation and had not done it well. In fact, this is nothing, but if we are greeting and asking questions, It would be even better if I can be more sincere when customers need me, and less of the rigid sense of process that is my work process. Overall, JW Marriott Sanya Dadonghai is worth recommending.

msg:It was my first time staying at Marriott, so I was a novice at Marriott. I stayed in the Lanhaixuan, which is considered to be a mid-to-upper-priced room. From the perspective of ordinary people, there are several points that are not very satisfactory. 1. The hangers outside the platform in the room are very short, and hanging ordinary half sleeves will drag the floor. From the air, I saw the clothes racks in the room next to me were very high. I don‚Äôt know if they have different configurations in each room or if they brought their own. 2. There is only ordinary mineral water in the room, and all drinks are charged. When staying in the same hotel that costs around 1,000 yuan, the room will be provided with a few bottles of basic drinks. The cheap rooms in Sanya have free Coke and Sprite. 3. The shower gel smells really bad. No matter how expensive or good the brand is, the smell is the first impression. Every time I take a shower, I have to pinch my nose and wash it out. It smells like Chinese medicine and pungent to my nose. dislike. Maybe I'm not a high-end person and can't appreciate it. 4. The lighting in the restaurant is hard to describe. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs dark for dinner. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the a**osphere. But the breakfast was also dark, and I couldn't feel the vitality or sunshine in the morning. When I went to have breakfast in the morning, I almost fell asleep, let alone feeling energetic. Breakfast and dinner are quite delicious, but there are not so many categories. The hotel also has advantages: the service is very good, and the guy at the front desk enthusiastically helps with luggage. Although the room is a bit older, it is clean and tidy. If you need help, call the front desk and the front desk will help you immediately. The location of the hotel is also good, and the view is also good. Anyway, these are just personal opinions, everyone has different feelings. I wish Marriott Hotels will get better and better.

The hotel facilities are complete and it was quite comfortable. The package included executive benefits. You could eat and drink there all day long. It was very pleasant to drink. The hotel service was great. The butler, Nicole, was very good. We contacted her in advance before checking in and helped us choose a high floor according to our wishes. She also helped contact the free wine bar. Fruits were welcome and she also answered our questions. He was able to answer the questions immediately. During the stay, my feet were worn out due to the discomfort of wearing shoes. After contacting the housekeeper, she was able to promptly deliver iodine and band-aids, and also applied for a late check-out. The service was very attentive. The service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic. However, as the hotel has been here for a long time, it is inevitable that the facilities will age. For example, the sound insulation is not very good and the air conditioner is loud. However, the flaws are not hidden and there is nothing particularly unacceptable. If I come to Dadonghai next time, I will continue Choose to stay at Marriott.

msg:Because I had been working overtime for a month before the double holidays, I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to find a place with beautiful scenery and a slow pace to rest and recuperate before the holidays. In the end, I chose Sanya - I thought it might be a few years before I came to Three Towers after I retired. After deciding on the location, I started searching on Ctrip and Baidu: I am alone, so I have to choose a safe place. , a place that is not remote and has convenient transportation; because the festival prices are high, you should choose a relatively cost-effective brand hotel. So, finally, on the day before departure, I chose the flight + wine package on Ctrip and chose Marriott.
Regarding this choice, I can only say: It‚Äôs so wiseüòçüòçüòçFirst of all, the hotel is close to the sea-although I couldn‚Äôt book a sea-view room on the day of check-in because it was full (later, the hotel had sea-view rooms, and they immediately took the initiative to upgrade me to a room type), I was satisfied. The desire to view the sea; secondly, the hotel equipment is relatively new and there are no old equipment; thirdly, the decoration is the Japanese log style that I like - the most important thing when choosing a hotel is not to choose a fully carpeted one, which is too bad Easy to clean; fourth, the service attitude is good. I changed rooms and upgraded the room type midway. The housekeeper Julia and the front desk Joy followed up the whole process and were kind and kind. The key point is that because it was a temporary itinerary and it was my first time to come to Sanya, many outing arrangements were made on the spur of the moment. For example, I didn‚Äôt book a ticket on Ctrip until 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening, and so on. . But as long as you contact us via WeChat, the housekeeper Julia can reply in time and provide reference opinions.
All in all, it was a very satisfying experience. For me, Sanya is definitely a place I will visit again and again, and JW Marriott will also be my first choice for my next stay.
By the way~ It‚Äôs so delicious~ The variety is also rich ‚Äì this is the first time I have eaten Roujiamo in a hotel breakfast buffetüòÇ I didn‚Äôt enjoy the trea**ent even when I stayed at Shangri-La in Xi‚Äôan~ I ate pancakes‚ûïcream four mornings üòÇ

msg:Room: The hotel room has a great balcony. The view from the balcony is simply stunning. The room I stayed in is very close to the sea. I have stayed in so many hotels in Sanya and most of them are a little away from the sea. I wrote One is to feel the blue sky, white clouds and sea up close, which is very pleasant.
Service: The service of this hotel is absolutely meticulous. Before check-in, the manager Vivian called us specifically to confirm our location, time and needs, and make arrangements. After arriving at the room, everything was ready and we quickly checked in at the executive lounge. During check-in, Vivian sent us back to the room and introduced the hotel's facilities and some highlights. According to his introduction, we got up early to watch the sunrise. The weather was also very good and the sunrise was perfect. We didn't want to get up early.
Lounge: This is also a special feature. It may be approaching the holidays, but there are still a lot of people. The food is quite satisfactory, and HH can meet the needs. The service staff in the lounge are very busy but they can also get the needs of the guests, which is still very good. of
Location: Close to the city. There are two shopping malls nearby. There are many places to eat. It is mainly close to the station, which will be much more convenient.
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay. It is worth recommending. Thank you to the manager Vivian for the arrangement.

We arrived around 2 o'clock, and the lady at the front desk saw that we had children and took the initiative to upgrade to a parent-child room, and also gave one of us breakfast. Waited for almost an hour for the room to be cleaned. During this period, the little housekeeper Nicole joined me and kept communicating with me about the room situation. If I had any questions during the subsequent check-in, she responded quickly. Thank you to the housekeeper and the front desk lady. The hotel's children's pool basically has no play equipment, and I didn't go to the concave and convex infinity pool next door because it is a bit deep and is not recommended for children. There are quite a lot of people at breakfast, but there are not many varieties. The hotel is located close to the city, so it is relatively close to take a taxi to find food. The entire hotel staff were very nice.

msg:Summary: Go live next door at the Autograph, this jw is awesome
The corridor and the room on the non-smoking floor smelled of cigarette smoke. I wanted to change to a room of the same type, but the housekeeper said that there was no room available and would give me an air freshener. I was speechless for the first time today. I insisted on changing rooms, but it turned out that the room next door was actually vacant. I didn't ask you to change me to a bigger room? So lying and perfunctory customers is JW‚Äôs service attitude? Speechless again.
Okay, I moved to the room next door on the same floor. Then the housekeeper said that we are on a non-smoking floor. Why does the corridor smell of smoke? I'm sorry that you have a problem with the management environment and you dare to question the affected guests? Or do I look like I know? Finally, he said angrily, "We will also help you upgrade to a sea view room. Excuse me, I originally booked a sea view room?" ? ? ? ? ok I am so angry when I think about writing this review ^_^ If I had known I would only live in the Autuge next door, people would have a much better attitude. I am really angry when I live here.

The disadvantage is that it is far away from the beach and it takes about ten minutes to walk there. The hotel staff did not take the initiative to mention that we can take the hotel's shuttle bus when we asked how to get to the beach. Answered, so remember to take the initiative to ask to send it to the beach when you live here.

msg:1. I informed the housekeeper one day in advance that I wanted three rooms on one floor. When I arrived at three o'clock the next day, I was told that the rooms were on three different floors. We said we could wait, but we waited until 6 o'clock to get the room. Since it is already the peak season, the manpower issue should be something that hotels should pay attention to.
2. The sea view rooms we stayed in were all connected rooms, and the sound insulation was poor, which was a nigh**are. At around five o'clock in the morning, a family with a baby next door started to get busy. Every word they said was very clear, and they even started to play children's songs, "What's the name of daddy's daddy..."
3. As a resort hotel, we did not expect that the room attendant would knock on the door at around 9 a.m. and ask if cleaning was needed. After we turned on the "Do Not Disturb" light, there was another knock on the door at about one o'clock in the afternoon. Even our companions who were sleeping in the room were shocked when the waiter who delivered the welcome fruit opened the door and entered directly.
4. Since there are many guests waiting for rooms in the executive lounge, there is a serious shortage of tableware and cups, so I can only eat fruit with toothpicks. The milk frother of the coffee machine was broken on the first day and could not froth milk, so I had to add milk. HH's product is too ordinary, the curry fish balls are all starch balls. The service attitude of the staff in the executive lounge is still very good.
5. The lighting in the breakfast room is dim; there is only one socket at the bedside of the twin room; the bathroom door does not close tightly; the decoration is old

Finally, I would like to praise Alan, a guy in the concierge depar**ent.

The hotel also provides many convenient facilities, such as free parking, laundry service and 24-hour front desk service.

Finally, the hotel's food and beverage service is also excellent. Breakfast offers a variety of options including hot items, fruit and breads. The hotel also has a restaurant serving delicious local and international cuisine.

All in all, this hotel is an excellent choice of accommodation. Whether you are traveling for business or leisure, it can provide you with a warm and comfortable accommodation experience. I highly recommend JW Marriott and look forward to staying again.

After arriving at the hotel, the hotel lobby manager Xiao Zeng gave us a tropical enthusiasm. He is a cute and lovely island boy. , In addition, I would also like to thank Joy and the concierge Bob. No matter the room or other problems, they have been arranged properly. It is definitely one of the first choices for Sanya vacation. In addition, the sea view of the hotel is amazing. It is really a good movie. I will definitely do it next time will come again

The package includes the executive lounge, dessert, dinner and drinks. Although the spirits are not very complete, it can barely make cocktails. There are many types of hotel buffet breakfast and lounge dinner, but the taste can be improved.
The hotel adopts butler service. The butler Liz called in advance to ask about the arrival time. If there is any problem, she can communicate through social software at any time and help to solve it properly. Liz's service really makes me feel very good and considerate.
By the way, it happened to be my birthday during the stay. When I checked in, I asked the hotel that there was no bakery but only a bakery, so there was no cake to choose to buy. But on my birthday, I received a call, saying that I noticed it was my birthday, and prepared a cake for me and put it in the room. Although relatively simple, this kind of heart is really heartwarming.

msg:The second hotel I stayed in Sanya chose this JW Marriott in Dadonghai. The first reason is that Dadonghai is relatively close to the urban area, and there are many food choices. The second is that I have bought a particularly cost-effective suite room voucher on Ctrip~
Because it is a vacation with a baby, the requirements for accommodation are relatively high, and the bigger the room, the better. Originally booked a Shanhaixie sea view suite, butler Andre contacted me two days in advance to meet my specific demands, and helped us upgrade to a better Haohaixie full sea view suite. The moment I entered the door, I was shocked by the balcony with a full sea view of 270¬∞C, because it was really hot these two days, hiding in the room and watching the sea view became the only enjoyment haha. And you can see the sunrise on the sea from the room, which is simply beautiful. The room is 108 square meters and is super large, with a dining and living room. It is super comfortable for a family of three to eat in the room.
The hotel has a lot of parent-child facilities. Although we didn't go to the children's playground, the outdoor swimming pool and the artificial beach dolls played a lot haha. The fly in the oin**ent is that walking to the beach is a little far away, but it's enough to see the sea view from the hotel on such a hot dayüòÑ

During the two-day and one-night trip, I could always feel the care of Andre. I am very grateful to him and his hotel for the good memories he left for me.
This hotel has been around for some years, but it is not old at all. On the contrary, it has precipitated the thoughtfulness and consideration that Internet celebrity hotels do not have at all. It is a kind of self-confidence to dare to hang jw. The room is very hygienic, the facilities are complete, the swimming pool is even more charming, and the special restaurant Wushan tastes unexpectedly delicious. The hotel is still being upgraded, and I am very much looking forward to staying with my family and children next time.
Timeless good hotel!

Now Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay have been captured by Internet celebrities, there are strange people everywhere, and the number of afternoon tea is scary even thinking about it. I really like the low-key indifference of this hotel. The buffet is an indoor open kitchen, which is rare and has fresh ingredients. The executive lounge is suitable for a daze, suitable for work, suitable for a family to dine, and then have a drink together, the food and drink is richer than imagined. The whole family is quite satisfied with the holiday with tea, wine and sea. The club is very big, big and small can play, and the pool rental entertainment facilities are not expensive. The bed was very comfortable with full buckwheat pillows provided. The check-in experience is much better than that of the Edison, in short, it is a vacation worth the money!

The most important thing is that this hotel is very cost-effective. The price is unmatched for hotels in Yalong Bay. You can't even touch the beach. You can also enjoy the sea view, and it's very convenient to eat, drink and have fun around. I also highly recommend the ice cream on the first floor of the lobby. The cheese flavor is very delicious. You must try it! I would also like to thank the handsome manager Yang for his attentive service and extending check-out until 4 o'clock (probably because he saw that I liked this hotel so much that I couldn't bear to leave haha).

msg:This is the hotel I booked for about 1800 a night.
The price and service facilities are completely out of proportion to the hotel.
Location: First of all, this place is very close to Dadonghai. However, we took two taxis out and drove in. Both the online taxi and ourselves made mistakes at the entrance. The road signs were not obvious. Hard to find.
Hygiene: I don‚Äôt want to talk nonsense. The two pictures in the comments can explain everything. The floor is very dirty, and the bathroom sink is so dirty. Both sofas have mottled stains. I didn‚Äôt dare to sit on them the whole time.
Facilities: When I checked in, I asked the front desk that there is no private beach. The hotel only has a swimming pool and lawn. Some fine sand is spread on the edge of the swimming pool to disguise the beach. There is a public corridor next door to Autuge. But the one closer to the sea is on the Autuge side. The bar claims to have one, but when I looked there was no one and no service staff. There is a landscape that claims to be a rainforest, but is actually a potted garden.
Service: 1. Before going out, I communicated with the front desk about the license plate and confirmed it again and again. I still entered it wrong and almost got charged for parking. Fortunately, the security guard looked at the room card and confiscated the money and told us to go back and make up for it. 2. I had two room cards, but one of them couldn't be opened. I went to the front desk and was told that it might have been degaussed. It was a good possibility. I had stayed in so many hotels during my travels and it was the first time I encountered one that could be degaussed. 3. The air conditioner will be locked and cannot be turned on. It is said to be energy-saving, and it doesn‚Äôt matter that our balcony door is not closed. In fact, the balcony door was closed, and I closed it several times, but it just couldn't be opened. I couldn't turn on the air conditioner because I was so sweaty that I couldn't turn on the air conditioner. I was so angry that I slammed the balcony door several times and finally unlocked the air conditioner.
This is a hotel for 1800 a night

Just this health, just this facilities, just this service
I'm such a victim

The trip to Sanya started with JW Marriott, and the whole journey was very pleasant. Although everyone says that the hotels in Dadonghai are not as good as those in Haitang Bay, I still think that JW Marriott has given a very good answer!
First of all, when I have not relegated and only have a gold card left after the epidemic for several years, Sweet, the lady at the front desk, managed to upgrade the room, and her service attitude is also very good. The little brother saw that we had a lot of luggage with us, and he helped carry the luggage for takeaway many times.
Although there was a small episode during the stay, Neal still dutifully solved the problem and tried to make up for it. The overall experience was good. I felt caring and caring.
The parent-child attribute of the hotel is also quite good. The parent-child room also provides a full set of children's appliances, and the design is quite good. The amu*****t park downstairs is said to be the largest indoors, but it is still a little old, and some items are also out of service. It may not be a hotel that focuses on parent-child, which is understandable.
The lounge experience is also pretty good, with good products and services. If you are a platinum member or above, you can ask the butler if you can experience the swimming pool and other facilities of the Autograph next door. You can experience two hotels by staying in one hotel. It's still pretty good!
Next time I have a chance, I will come to Jw Marriott again to experience it!

1: After reading the reviews, it is said that the service is average. The actual experience of the service is perfect. Any needs raised on the app will be quickly responded to and resolved.
2: The front desk of the room did not take the initiative to upgrade the room. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are usually on a business trip. This time when you are traveling with your family, you have the cheek to ask the front desk if you can upgrade the room. I was upgraded to a high-floor executive sea view king bed.
3: The quality of the afternoon tea in the executive lounge is average. HH products are not bad. There are freshly cooked noodle stalls. The taste is good. You can only eat if you are full.
4: Buffet dinner. It may be off-season recently. The buffet is 188 people. You can bring children under the age of 7. It is very friendly. The buffet dinner is very good. There are grilled lamb chops and steaks. Freshly fried shells. There is also table wine. There is also a band. In short, if you have a baby at 188, the price/performance ratio will be extremely high.
5: Parent-child activities are barely enough. It can‚Äôt be regarded as a hotel that mainly focuses on personal. There is a large amu*****t park. The fun is average. The swimming pool is an ordinary swimming pool + sandpit. Haitang Bay is suitable for bringing children to the hotel.
6: The only place where staying in a hotel is quite pitiful. The buffet breakfast is really worrying. You can have fewer varieties and not exquisite. But you are always delicious. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be up to the mark. It‚Äôs not as good as the breakfast at the Four Points by Sheraton the night before. But the waiter service in the restaurant is very good. They take care of customers who are afraid of the cold and those who are afraid of the heat. There is no messy experience. I also stayed in four hotels this time. The only place where Marriott can be satisfied in terms of service.

msg:My neighbors and friends all come to Sanya to stay at the Marriott Hotel, and we also come here especially for the name. The first time I came to this hotel, I was very impressed. Since the suite I booked can be late check-out free of charge, even though it was past the check-in time when we checked in, the room hadn't been cleaned yet. A young lady at the front desk and a manager brother asked us to go to the lobby to apologize We drank drinks at the bar and waived our extra bed fee. We fully felt the hotel's enthusiasm, thoughtfulness and full respect for guest service. The hotel room is very clean and tidy, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, you can have a panoramic view even if you are sitting on the sofa on the bed, and it is more comfortable to lie on the sofa on the balcony and blow the sea breeze. The hotel has complete supporting facilities. The outdoor swimming pool can be shared with the hotel next door. There is also a children's playground and a small botanical garden on the second floor of the lobby. The only inconvenience is that there are no restaurants or convenience stores around, but it is still very good to eat in the hotel when the restaurants in the hotel are discounted, and there are many choices of cuisines. However, there is a dining cabinet at the entrance of the hotel, and it is very convenient to order takeaway. The hotel is located on the seaside of Dadonghai, and it is very convenient to take a taxi to Nanshan, Yemeng Corridor, Yalong Bay, the airport and other places. In the future, JW Marriott Hotel Sanya Dadonghai Bay will be my first choice in Sanyaüëçüèª

msg:I stayed in Yalong Bay for the next few days after I arrived in Sanya, but there were also many delicious food and attractions in the city and I didn‚Äôt want to give up, so I booked the JW Marriott Hotel Shanhaitian in Dadonghai for two days.

Let me talk about the good things first~ The hotel housekeeper contacted me one day in advance to ask about the needs, and added WeChat at the same time, with a perfect attitude. Marriott Platinum members have upgraded to an executive sea view room. The view is very good. It is really great to be able to see the sea while lying in the bathtub. The welcome fruit is also very rich, and there is a big dragon fruit. As one of the few hotels in Sanya with an executive lounge, the happy hour is not bad. The key is that the location is really good. It is very convenient to go to Luhuitou and go to the city to eat seafood~

Let me talk about a few things that can be improved. One is that the lady at the front desk who checks in may be a novice, or we checked in late, and we didn‚Äôt introduce anything during the check-in process. We just handed us the room card and said it‚Äôs ok. Didn't say how many nights we booked. Then it didn't recognize the Marriott membership. When we asked about the lounge and other matters, it suddenly dawned on us, and then introduced us to the location of breakfast and the time of the lounge.
The other is that I booked a two-night stay on Ctrip, but the front desk may not have connected the order for us or something. When I went out and returned to the hotel the next day, the front desk and the lobby bar both said that we only booked one night and had already checked out. Then it took some time to deal with this matter. Later, it was said that the staff checked us out for the second night or made some operational mistakes. This made people feel a little uncomfortable.

However, during the stay, including helping to deal with the refund of the deposit later, the attitude of the housekeeper Fay and other housekeepers who changed shifts were very good, and the handling was relatively timely. On the whole, the flaws are not concealed, and I will still choose this jw Marriott Hotel next time I go to Sanya to transit in the urban area.

The hotel hardware is good, the room has no peculiar smell, the quilt is moderately thick, the breakfast is rich, and the swimming pool is also clean. Standing on the beach and blowing the sea breeze, looking at the clear sea water, I feel extremely happy!
Thank you Mina, I will bring my children to stay next time, and I will recommend it to other friends!

msg:Thanks to the hotel for taking the initiative to upgrade the room. The size of the room is not bad. It is more suitable for bringing a baby. The facilities are well maintained and the feeling of use is good. The feeling of living is relatively comfortable. The view outside the window is not the best but it can be regarded as a sea view. The floor is high It should be good. It is quite comfortable to sit and lie on the balcony. The hotel facilities are enough for us to bring a young baby, but the swimming ring in the swimming pool needs to be rented for a fee, and there is no one suitable for a one- or two-year-old baby. Survival wear gear. However, the indoor play center is enough for babies to play for a long time. It is spacious and safe, and the old mother said that she likes it very muchü§≠. There are many seats in the hotel for guests to rest or watch the scenery, which is great. It is very friendly for business people who need to deal with work or take a nap; for breakfast, it is quite satisfactory, and it can still meet the needs of bringing babies. The location of the hotel is not bad. It is not too far to walk to the beach. The only downside is that there are no sidewalks on the way to the beach. It is not very safe to push the baby out. Fortunately, there are not too many vehicles. The sea area in front of the hotel is a rocky beach, but the hotel has built a small piece of white sand beach to make up for this shortcoming. Walking to the nearby beach area, the sea water is fairly clean and the sand is fairly fine. It is very quiet and the wind and waves are not too big. Bring your baby to play Words are enough. The beach is very lively at night, but we didn't go there with our baby. Because the baby has the habit of taking a nap, the hotel has also made a late check-out. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied and will choose this place next time.

I would like to say something special here, because I bought a package this time, and because of the room extension and breakfast, I asked Ctrip to negotiate with the hotel to change the package. Ctrip was particularly responsible, and it was still helping me coordinate as it was approaching midnight. really thankful!
I brought my baby to live in Shanhaitian Marriott. What I like more is that I can catch the sea because he doesn‚Äôt have a beach. Although I only harvested some small crabs this time, I caught mantis shrimps with big hammers. Although there are crabs with big palms , It's a pity that I ran too fast and my technique was too poor, so I didn't catch it, haha.
In short, the baby is very happy, and I am also very happy. The hotel has maintained the standard it has always been, and it is still great.

This hotel is not suitable for vacation. It doesn't feel like a vacation at all, it feels full of business. The room was not soundproofed. I don't know if someone in a nearby room was chatting at about 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. I don't know if they didn't close the door or the soundproofing was so poor that the sound was very clear and it was so noisy that I couldn't sleep. In terms of hygiene, this is the teapot in the room. I washed it three times with toothpaste before cleaning it.

msg:The attitude of the service staff is very good, but it may be because of the mountains and the sea, the room is humid and smelly, the balcony door is opened and the room can almost water ski in the room, the air conditioner needs to be adjusted frequently, otherwise it will stop after a while. With children, the little housekeeper helped to prepare children's products, but the production date is October 21, and after communication, they changed to recent ones. The breakfast and dinner buffets on the second floor are hard to describe and can be eaten. In addition, the room card may not be able to open the room halfway, and you need to wait for the staff to help. The children's playground is quite big, but it is suitable for older children. Generally speaking, the name does not match the reality, and the children said that they should never come here again~

2. After I made it clear that I did not accept it and planned to call the police to resolve it. The hotel only gave a sea view room. However, the sea view here is also very ordinary... It is incomparable with the view of Haitang Bay. The landscape of the park is almost interesting, anyway, it is very Commerce Depar**ent.
3. The swimming pool is very good, the sanitation is very clean ~ the bed in the room is very comfortable
4. The buffet tastes very good!

Generally speaking, don‚Äôt come here for vacation or parent-child activities. It‚Äôs not on the same level as Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay. It‚Äôs more suitable for business trips! Taking pictures is also very good!

The gym equipment and gadgets should be considered the most complete in the hotel, including kettlebell battle ropes, and barbells for pull-ups and bench presses. Special thanks to Len, the waiter at the all-day dining restaurant. During the buffet dinner, my husband got stuck in his throat with food. The situation was critical. Fortunately, Len was by his side and rescued him with the Heimlit method. Thank you very much. I hope the hotel can train all the restaurant staff to save the lives of guests at critical moments.

msg:The second time I came to Sanya, I chose Marriott without any hesitation after reading the online reviews. Because I believe that Marriott's super cost-effective, comprehensive facilities and personalized service will bring me a better experience on this trip.
When I checked in, Una, the lovely butler, was waiting for me, helping me with my luggage and introducing me to Marriott's facilities and nearby attractions. I really want to praise my little butler, the service response speed is very fast, what I need, I can know the information I want immediately through her.
The room I stayed in this time was also upgraded for me. The balcony has a 270¬∞ sea view to watch, and the photos are also very good. There is also my favorite room service link. As a person who loves to eat in the room, there is nothing more beautiful than looking at the beautiful scenery on the balcony and wanting to have a delicious meal. The hotel's culinary skills are also very high, and none of the meals I ordered were thunderous. The only suggestion is to hope that the hotel‚Äôs breakfast can have the option of coffee or juice, and you can set whether you need to add drinks on the order interface, which is more friendly to novices.
Overall, I am very satisfied. Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose Marriott. I also hope that my job as a housekeeper will go smoothly! !

Compared with the same price range, the Intercontinental Deluxe Ocean View Room in the Mid-Levels Peninsula, which costs 1,700, has a much better layout than the Marriott. The Marriott toilet and shower are so far apart it's not convenient at all. Breakfast is also the most unsatisfactory breakfast I have ever had in a hotel of the same price range. It tastes bad and there is not much variety. Our family of three left without eating much. The hotel has nothing to do and has no resort a**osphere.

This is due to the weather, and I didn't pay attention when I made the reservation, and it didn't include breakfast. This is my problem. The package I bought gave a lot of things, and the introduction was a thousand words, but breakfast was not included. Then I ate dinner at the Chinese restaurant. Dianping bought a crab spicy hot pot 388 set meal in a group purchase~sold 1 copy in half a year~ Sure enough, the money paid on the spot did not go to Dianping, and the introduction of the spicy hot pot set is also a lot of information.... no rice! I xxx, and then ordered the most expensive two bowls of rice in my life, 20 a bowl. Then, 10 minutes did not go on! ! After being urged no less than five times, a bowl of rice for 20 yuan was served! Then, when checking out, there were seven or eight large and small bags, and I wanted to call the luggage cart to pick them up. I called the front desk for ten minutes and ten times but failed to get through. Finally, I called the mobile phone once but failed. Take the children with you to check out the room! ! By the way, I remembered that I arrived at 2:30 when I checked in. I was asked to wait for an hour. I sat there and drank afternoon tea until 4:00. I waited for an hour and a half before going to the front desk to check in, and I was asked to wait In 10 minutes, the room card cannot be given without cleaning. Alas, it‚Äôs really not good to be cheap. This time, Sanya booked a total of 7 hotels for 9 nights, and this is the cheapest one. It is also the most unpopular one, and it may really have something to do with my price. . It's going to Atlantis, it's not too bad...

Service: During the breakfast buffet, there were no feeds for the first two days, which was quite chaotic. On the third day, there was another seat. Maybe there were insufficient staff during the epidemic.

I got up at the front desk at 10 o'clock in the morning to check in, and was told that there was no room to wait. (Blame me ), check in again at 12:00 and tell you to wait (the number of people staying is understandable), and check in again at 4:00 and tell you to continue to wait. On the first floor, I immediately picked up the phone arrogantly, as if calling the reservation depar**ent to cancel someone's Ctrip order for him, and then told me fiercely that you called Ctrip and told him to change the order. Why are you so fierce, I know you have been busy from morning to afternoon today, but you can't take your anger out on the guests
3 I think I was to blame for the first two check-ins, but it was almost 4 o'clock and I still received such an impolite reply. I think you insulted me and your responsibilities. There are so many guests watching in the lobby Under the circumstances, play the role of official authority, fine taste
4 As a hotel lover, I will teach you how to deal with it. (Sir, I am really sorry for keeping you waiting. I see that the package in your room includes an afternoon tea. Why don‚Äôt I arrange for you to have the afternoon tea first? The room I'll help you follow up here, sorry for the trouble,

Although there are not many guests, the service is not much, especially the service of Xiaoli, the guest service, which is very warm and cordial. Same, it takes time to answer, replying to WeChat is very timely, giving a lot of advice on travel, and the tall man at the front desk, not only upgraded us to the best room type, but also handled the problem quickly and easily, without procrastination, I am really satisfied, one thing My demeanor at the front desk of the hotel 20 years ago was decisive in handling problems and made the guests feel that their choice was correct. Suddenly I remembered that 20 years ago, I was still the main team at the front desk of a government-affiliated hotel. The lights were not repaired and my face was red when I came to the front desk. The deputy shift hurried back to the lounge to find me. I immediately took out the only room in the hotel and put it in the hand of the guest to tell her that it was our fault and the only one. There is no need to make up the difference in one of the suites. At the moment, everything is quiet and rested. I am the only one who has not slept all night, because I am the only one who is betting that the mayor will not have guests temporarily, and that I can still appear at the front desk of the hotel tomorrow. , 20 years later, China has developed so well. There are so many young people in the hotel industry who work hard and serve customers. According to what customers think and what customers are anxious, they treat the hotel as their home and do their best to do their best! jw Marriott, the room is clean and tidy, the service is considerate and warm, the stay is happy and comfortable, the price is the lowest in history, it is worth recommending!

msg:The hotel is in Sanya during the Chinese New Year. The quality is high quality and the price is reasonable. Since we are traveling as a family, we booked two rooms. Considering that we didn‚Äôt live in a hotel on the first floor, we got a free room upgrade. The sunrise is really beautiful, but there are some problems with the sound insulation. The neighbors are a bit noisy, but The service is very good. Amy, the little butler of the hotel, is very kind and lovely, and she speaks softly and nicely. Because I arrived very late, I have been very patient and gentle. The location of the hotel is very good. The beach and the sea are downstairs. Next time I don‚Äôt travel during the spring break, I will choose this place again, hoping to be accompanied by the lovely Amy

It is very convenient to enter the city and share two swimming pools with Autograph. The service staff are very enthusiastic and responsive. My sister is very nice, and she explained to us the place where you can take pictures and express delivery. She gave me ice water and hand towels at any time. It was really the happiest hotel I stayed in this trip.

This is the service that a 5-star hotel should have, and the care for the guests is good, in fact, many of them are reflected in the details. Especially their Demi manager is very dedicated! If there are basic problems, they will be explained clearly in advance, and they will take good care of customers and give us a lot of surprises. The overall feeling of the hotel is really beyond the existence of the follow-up hotel. May lose in a bit old. But really a plus for the service

msg:The first time I stayed in Dadonghai in Sanya, JW Marriott was the right choice. Especially for business travelers, there are one of the few executive lounges in Sanya Hotel, so there is no pressure to work in different places during the epidemic. The hardware of the hotel is a little old, but it seems to be well maintained. The staff at the front desk, restaurant and lounge are friendly and professional. The hotel is located in a quiet place. It is a 10-minute drive from Dadonghai and the city center. Compared with Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, there are many more dining options and five stars for convenience.

I didn't even give up hope for the butler service that I contacted in advance, and just made a light request. Unexpectedly, the little housekeeper Demi did everything as required! üòòüòòüòò The service is warm, and the room type arranged is also super satisfied, with a large balcony, a first-class sea view, and the most important thing is that there is no musty smell! üëçüëçDemi provided all kinds of help during the stay, and even helped the children find shoes. Since the plane took off late, I wanted to delay the check-out. Apart from that, it was delayed until two o'clock. Before leaving, I even gave the children a small gift! The service is perfect and the experience is great! Will choose again!
  There are a few points to complain about the hotel: 1. The breakfast is really mediocre and does not meet the five-star standard at all. 2. There is no heated swimming pool, so you cannot go swimming at 9:00 pm. 3. Although the children's playground is the largest in the hotel I have stayed in so far, there are too many charges for parent-child activities, and it is not as good as Intercontinental.

msg:Coordinates: Dadonghai
Advantages: It is close to the urban area, close to various Internet celebrity coffee shops in Dadonghai and Tianya District, and close to the night market.

High cost performance: newer than Wenhua, and it took less than 4 years to renovate in 2018.
Quieter than Wenhua, Wenhua is full of people hyped online, 3 and 4K room prices have to wait in line for breakfast, but at the price of 1000+ at JW Marriott, you can get a sea view room, there are not many people in the breakfast room, and the breakfast room is air-conditioned. Comfortable

Service: Mila's housekeeper is very caring! All requests must be answered! Very young but feels like a very professional hotel guy already. Thank you for your care during your stay. The service of the restaurant and the service of the room are also well-mannered and considerate.

We booked for three nights, because the children wanted to take online classes, the hotel's It engineer came to the room to help adjust the bandwidth; house keeping would also take the initiative to ask if we needed to add nursing supplies~ When the tissue in the room ran out, the waiter brought two boxes at a time. Your needs are always met!
wifi:
strong signal
breakfast:
Rich and beautiful
Room Facilities:
In Sanya, it is a relatively new hotel
bed:
Moderate, neither soft nor hard, there are many choices of pillows, a total of 4 are provided
health:
very clean
Gym:
Don't forget to check in the ocean view treadmill~ It's great to have the ocean view close at hand!

The very handsome little brother helped me with the luggage and pressed the elevator, and later helped me upgrade the room type. The breakfast is rich and delicious, and there are many choices of fruits, mainly fresh. The service of the buffet dinner is really great. There is a young lady who doesn't know her name, and I am very impressed. The people are very nice, kind and attentive. The owner of Shanhaitian on the opposite side is also the same owner. I wanted to go shopping at the opposite hotel one night. The little brother who drove the hotel asked if he wanted to take us there (in fact, the two stores are very close, so it only takes a minute or two to walk), go back to the room It just happened to be raining again, the driver sent us back again, and the whole service was super warm ‚ù§Ô∏è. I was a little reluctant when I checked out. This was the first time I felt reluctant to part with a hotel. Although I only stayed for two nights, I felt that I already had feelings for this hotel. I haven't stayed at other Marriotts, but based on this experience, other Marriotts will definitely be very good.
In addition, the hotel is not far from the Dadonghai Sea. The location of the hotel is also close to the city, and it is also very close to the Xiaodonghai. Evaluation from the heart. Must be super star üåü

Hygiene: clean
Transportation: very convenient

msg:First of all, this hotel is not a resort hotel, but a business hotel that happens to be on the seaside, with a small area and no vacation feeling. However, the propaganda of the hotel is very misleading, making people mistake it for a resort hotel. The so-called 1,200-square-meter children's center is only a small part of the actual opening, and there is a lot of odor.
Second, the hotel service is very poor, not as good as the ordinary Marriott, and certainly not as good as the Yalong Bay Marriott Hotel I stayed in before. I don't know if jw means inferior Marriott. Our room came with two adult breakfasts and I went with my two ten year olds. Make me pay for a half-price breakfast. One full-price breakfast is equal to two half-price breakfasts. This simple question has been entangled for a long time. I don‚Äôt know if it is deliberately finding fault or is there a problem with intelligence? ! We have stayed in more than a dozen hotels in Sanya and have never struggled with this issue. After a rain, the hotel's outdated service was immediately prototyped. The swimming pool was full of muddy water, which was extremely ugly. A strange smell came from the sea, like the smell of rotting seafood. The hotel concierge didn't even have an umbrella to borrow. It is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in Sanya, no one.

The staff, indifferent and unreasonable, asked our room number and said that there is no such room, 0762 does not have this room, I said 762 again, and she seemed to understand. I don't know if she is sincere or just so stupid, adding a 0 will make her numb. The gym has one thing to say and one good, and it's cool to look at the sea when running. Another thing is that when the front desk checked in, the occupancy rate was only 40% at night. It was obvious that the sea-side room type could be upgraded on the order. As a result, only the interior view room was upgraded, and the extra balcony was still inside. , I dare not open the window, it will be seen by the opposite side, let alone this balcony, it is useless at all, it is a lonely upgrade

msg:This Marriott is not worthy of JW's level. When I checked in, a big man from Northeast China greeted me. I asked if I could upgrade the room. He said no. I said I was a Marriott Gold Card member. The answer I got was that it doesn't matter what kind of membership you have. If you want to upgrade, there is a room available at 8 pm. If you wait, it will be reserved for you. So I checked in normally. When I got to the room, I saw that I was assigned a room facing the hotel lobby. The so-called garden view was weird. I don't know if it was intentional. If you said the room was full, it would be understandable. Can't you communicate well? Here comes you. You are useless. I drove to the hotel by myself. Whether I drove by myself or not, shouldn't the front desk remind me to register? As a result, I found out that I was charged for the first time. I asked the security guard why I was charged for staying in the hotel. The security guard's introduction was correct. I checked in at the front desk. Excuse me, this simple thing, couldn't you inform me in advance? It's obvious that they treat people differently based on their personal preference. Later, through communication with Ctrip, I was moved to a higher floor where I couldn't see the lobby. When the check-out time came at 12 o'clock, I was told that it was ok. However, I checked in at another hotel at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. When doing facial recognition, I found that Marriott Hotel did not log out of the public security system. I repeatedly confirmed with the hotel whether it had been logged out, and the answer I got was that it had been logged out. As a result, I waited for more than an hour at the next hotel. Well, this is JW Marriott. Maybe it's because of my own experience that I was very dissatisfied with the hotel. Anyway, different people have different opinions.

After arriving at the hotel, the concierge Xiao Zeng enthusiastically opened the car door for me and took my luggage. Although I couldn't see it with a mask on, I felt that the service was done with a smile.

I am very satisfied with this stay, and I will come to JW Marriott next time I come to Sanya.

This room is just facing the sea, the scenery is very good, and the swimming pool is quite big, but maybe due to the epidemic, it only opens at ten in the morning and closes at 7 in the evening. After ten o'clock, it will be very hot. I don‚Äôt know how to go swimming. Generally, swimming is either earlier or later. You just avoid this time period, and you have to walk through the lobby to go to the swimming pool. The privacy is not good. The security guard is a bit fierce, and then the breakfast is not rich in variety, and the air conditioner is facing the food, the fried food is cold, and the others are still ok. I had breakfast at about 7:30 in the morning, which was relatively early. And the guests in other rooms were still loudly knocking on the door at one or two o'clock last night, and the whole thing was okay~

For example, the shuttle bus to the duty-free shop (although a part of the fare is returned after negotiating with the customer service) and the buffet dinner in our package are gone. I think the taste is pretty good, the check-in is relatively slow, you need to fill in all kinds of things and wait, and the hotel does not have a shuttle bus to Sanya Station or Phoenix Airport. I think many star hotels have this, and his family is not surprised. , The hotel does not have a private beach, and the swimming pool is not big enough. In fact, it is ok as a business overnight hotel. It is not a resort hotel, and the cost performance is not as high as a budget hotel. . We stayed in the ocean-view executive room type, which has poor privacy. If you stretch your head, you can see the situation in the room next to you. The full sea view bar is not enough. There is also a large terrace below. The luxury hotel in Shuiwanning looks at the sea view, much more beautiful than this.
The only thing worth commending is the receptionist at the door, Xiao Zeng, who is very warm and funny. He helped us carry our luggage to the car. When we checked in, no one helped us with our luggage and took us upstairs. Maybe they were all busy. Xiao Zeng is this time. A highlight of staying at the Marriott.

The high praise of the hotel service has been ruined by this 600 yuan fish gei in the Chinese restaurant. Not too happy. Next time I hope that the fish is good value for money and I will of course visit the Marriott Hotel... Fantastic trip by JW Marriott hahahaha Thank you Jackie and Zhou

The sea view on the 15th floor was great and the room was big and clean. Due to the late check-in, a small gift was specially sent to express my apologies. The children's playground on the third floor is very large, children have a great time playing, and the happy hour buffet in the executive lounge is also very rich. I especially appreciate the service attitude of the hotel. Every staff member is very professional and caring. Aubree, the housekeeper Xiaoshan, knew that the child was injured, and immediately notified the customer service to send disinfectant iodine and Band-Aids. Next time I will choose Marriott, the location is convenient, the service is attentive, and I feel at home!

msg:This time, I stayed at JW Marriott for ten days before and after my stay in Sanya. The first six days left a good impression. The second time I stayed there was a little episode, which was a bit unpleasant. The husband directly expressed his dissatisfaction, and the hotel quickly resolved it. Sent fruit and red wine to express apology, indicating that the management is still orderly. But the butler service is really useless, I remember the housekeeper is Ruby. This hotel is located in the Dadonghai Sea and has a beautiful swimming pool, as shown in Figure 1-4. Maybe because of the epidemic, there are not many people, so swimming does not disturb each other. It can be seen that the swimming pool of Shanhaitian next door is more beautiful. The two swimming pools are next to each other, but they do not communicate with each other, as shown in Figure 5. The feature of this hotel is that there is no beach. From the balcony, the seaside is a reef, but the treasure is that the sea water is very warm, and there is a good diving area hidden by the very close reef pile. The diving company seems to be not formal, but because The water is very shallow and there are many fish, so it is not dangerous, see Figure 6. The sea view is beautiful, you can watch the sunrise and sunset from the balcony. The hotel room is good, the balcony has a big round sofa. The hotel is close to Luhuitou Park. It is very convenient if you go out to eat and walk 20 minutes to the lively street. It must be pointed out that the chef team of the hotel is relatively weak. There are still so many tricks, but the taste is not required. The dinner is especially outstanding. Different guests choose different snails. After having a buffet dinner for a few days and trying the Chinese restaurant on the first floor, I chose to go out to eat.

However, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are not very good, especially the beef, which is fishy and chewy, and there may be too many people.

I ate the hotel buffet dinner for two consecutive days. The shrimp became smaller every day. The next day was the seafood buffet on Friday. Even the salmon had to wait for an hour. The hotel does not have its own beach. The children's playground is good, but the children's activities have not been reserved, and the room service is also waiting for a long time. The experience of this stay is very bad. The hotel gave a fruit plate during the feedback on the phone, and only brought the children's toiletries after the feedback.

I originally booked the superior room of Yinghaixuan, and communicated with Ms. Zhang that I wanted a view. A better room, Ms. Zhang decided to upgrade to an executive room, which is impeccable in terms of view and comfort. It is recommended that you buy a package. This time we bought two packages of 2588 for a total of four nights, each night added Two hundred yuan, but the hotel provided a two-night dinner buffet, which is very cost-effective. I have stayed at Wanlong Bay Marriott, Banshan Peninsula Intercontinental, Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt and Haitang Bay Tianfang Intercontinental. This time I will give jw both for hygiene and comfort. Marriott's full score, the sea view room here is the closest to the Caspian Sea, and will stay in the future, thanks again to Ms. Ruby Zhang.

The location is not bad, at the seaside, the front desk specifically called in advance to ask about my accommodation requirements, and arranged for me a room with a good view and a seaside location. The customer service staff did their best to clean and took the initiative to help me tidy up the messy cosmetics. The waiters passing by are very polite and take the initiative to greet the guests. The hotel has a nice view and is suitable for taking pictures. During the period, I also experienced Western food buffet and spa trea**ents. The overall feeling was pretty good, but I felt that the SPA was a bit expensive. The taste of the western food buffet is so-so. When I left, there was a concierge in the lobby to help me carry heavy luggage. Overall, the management of the Marriott Hotel has done a good job in every detail. Next time I come to Sanya for vacation, I will still choose. See you next time.

After communication, We changed it to a super large balcony and provided 24-hour follow-up service for a few days after our stay. Thank you very much to her. On the day of check-in, because we had to wait a long time to reserve a room, the front desk lady specially applied for three people. Friends who came to see me could go to the executive lounge happy hour together (the room only accommodates two people). The breakfast was also very good. Everything I like to eat is delicious. , the services in the executive lounge, breakfast restaurant and children's playground are also very good. The children's playground is very good.

The housekeeper couldn‚Äôt contact me on the day of check-in. I was told that I had to wait an hour for check-in at the front desk. Fine, we arrived at the hotel at 12:30 on the same day. The housekeeper may not arrange it for me, but he still checked in for me. Pre-sale, but at 13:30, I went to the front desk and asked the front desk manager to ask when my room will be ready, but the front desk manager told me to wait an hour later, and the attitude was all sorts of ignorance. Then I said that I had paid and waited for an hour. The front desk manager reluctantly gave me a room card without telling me the information and location of any room. In general, the experience of check-in is extremely poor, and it is not taken seriously.
Then I called the membership care service hotline of Marriott Group, and Lily, the duty manager that night, approached me to communicate and understand the unpleasantness that happened at noon.

I am also a regular guest of Marriott. Both Ctrip and Marriott Group‚Äôs App will book hotels, but the experience this time is really bad.
From the time the butler contacted me to the check-in environment, there was no feeling of being respected at all, and I even felt surprised that this is the service attitude that a five-star hotel can present.
By the way, the front desk manager is a man, and I can‚Äôt remember what his name is Ce.

Staying for two days, catching up with the typhoon day, Dadonghai‚Äôs plan to go out to the sea was ruined, and I could only have fun in the hotel. Talk about the highlights:

-Needless to say the service, there are cakes, red wine and dry white, Max‚Äôs considerate service adds to the journey
-The children‚Äôs playground is very clean. Marriott and the neighboring mountains and seas are common, and both parks can be played
-Most of the items are free, and some need to pay, such as making chocolate and pizza, but the amount is less than 100 yuan
-There are not many varieties of breakfast, and the place is not big, but the quality is very good, and the tableware is changed in time
-Chinese restaurant dishes are amazing, the price is acceptable, the signature crispy chicken is very good
-The room in the east wing has an L-shaped sofa with a width of about 1.2 meters. We remodeled a small bed, and a family of three can sleep comfortably

In the end, there was a catch. There was a lot of music from 8-11 at night, probably because there were young people holding a party next to the presidential suite, which affected the rest. In addition, as Marriott's luxury JW, there is still some gap with others, but the price is also placed here, and the price/performance ratio is still very good. Finally, I would like to thank Max for his attentive service, and I will continue to stay in Dadonghai next time.

Since I was staying with my parents, the lounge also helped to apply for an extra breakfast. When my parents returned from Hong Kong after buying local fruits, James in the lobby enthusiastically helped their parents put the fruits in their cold storage to prevent the fruits from spoiling. Lounge Vivian helped parents upgrade the East Wing Executive Ocean View Suite. The balcony of the room can see the aircraft carrier of the South China Sea Fleet. The parents are very satisfied and the whole holiday is very enjoyable. Shanhaitian is the most worthwhile five-star hotel in Dadonghai and one of the best hotels in the Marriott depar**ent.

We arrived at four o'clock and we could only check in after five o'clock. I called the front desk and asked the front desk, but I didn't do it because I was in a hurry to go out and said that I wanted to refund the result and I couldn't. I made three calls before I could return, and the front desk hung up the phone before anyone finished talking. There was a little bug on the bed that bit one leg and one leg. Forty packs and little ants crawling around. Change the sheets or they are torn. Asked about the sheets. It takes only three days to change the sheets. There are still small stains on the quilt.

The breakfast is definitely the best. It's similar to the EDITION. The rest of the diet is basically done outside. It's very convenient to take a taxi. The surprise is the Autograph buffet next to it. You must try it, people The environment is good, there are not many things but exquisite, it is the best buffet I have ever had in a hotel, the key is not expensive, can you stand it, haha. . . 3 days in Dadonghai and 3 days in Haitang Bay, the Grand Hyatt service in Haitang Bay is not as good as this one. If you want to experience what the housekeeper adds WeChat service in advance, you can take the initiative to ask Ctrip's customer service to help you contact you during the summer vacation. The hotel will not take the initiative to come to you, that's it, the children are not afraid of going into the water this time, the wife said Next time I want to stay in this hotel, next time I want to go to Yalong Bay to live in Ritz-Carlton.

There was a round sofa on the balcony where I could lie down and watch the sea view. The bedding was also very comfortable. The service is good, and the overall experience is satisfactory. The disadvantage is that the sliding door of the bathroom in my room does not close tightly, there is always a seam; and there are four or five dead bee corpses in the seam of the fence on my balcony. I hope to be taken seriously. !

The hotel's children's entertainment facilities are very rich, and the two children are very happy. The swimming pool is great, and the pool scenery is very good at night. The internal facilities of the hotel are relatively new, and I like the overall decoration style very much. Outside is the Dadonghai, the scenery is not bad. The hotel service is great, and the buffet restaurant tastes good, especially the freshly fried shellfish, which is sweet and slightly spicy, which suits our appetite very much. Parent-child travel is highly recommended.

The only thing in the hotel does not have its own beach, and you have to go through the wall to go to the beach, but it is cost-effective if you don't remember this. The hotel's housekeeper, demi, was warmly entertaining and answered any questions by calling one day in advance. This hotel was rated as the favorite monster hotel for this trip because the logo is a griffin.

After entering the hotel, if you drive by yourself, you can park directly in the ba*****t, which is free for guests, and a staff member will take the initiative to help note the license plate number. The lobby is very cool and natural wind is not just air conditioning. The room is very large and nearly fifty square meters. If you need ice cubes, you can send it to the front desk. This is the most satisfying place. The breakfast is rich in variety, but it's not very impressive. It is also worth complaining that many services in the hotel do not feel the same, it is more like a business hotel for people to rest, rather than a resort hotel.

After all, there are so many five-star hotels in Sanya, and everything should be lackluster. However, Xiaoxiao, the butler of Marriott, brought me a little surprise and warmth. He contacted me by phone and added WeChat one day in advance to ask if there were any special requirements, and he also took the initiative to provide advice on various aspects. During the stay, the "Shrimp Soldiers and Crab Generals" who helped put their children in the restaurant got the guest rooms as soon as possible. Thank you very much! I especially want to comment on the afternoon tea in the lobby bar, because the desserts are sold out late and need to be re-made. Although I waited for 20 minutes, it is really worth it. The pastries are beautifully made and taste very delicious. Arrived for a meal, this is something I didn't expect haha! Finally, the rooms are clean and tidy, well-equipped, with large bathtubs and invincible sea views. . . Everything is beautiful! Thank you Marriott for its excellent service, which made my daughter and I‚Äôs vacation more beautiful!

Then I finally moved to a high floor, and it felt completely different. However, staying in this kind of hotel did not feel like being at the seaside at all. First, there was no beach, and second, it looked like a business hotel (maybe it is a business hotel). I didn‚Äôt like it very much. This style makes me feel like I am on a business trip, not a tourist.

If you come to the beach, stay in a room that is stacked or facing the sea. This is the right way to open up in Sanya.

In addition, breakfast is very crowded! But the good thing is that they actually provide maple sugar, which is commendable!

msg:Check-in took two hours to complete, a little twists and turns. The level of luxury is ok, children's paradise, children have a lot of fun. The swimming pool is a bit far, and I feel that foreigners can also enter it, which is a bit complicated. In addition, the parent-child room is booked, and the breakfast children will be charged. Just in the city, if you want to see the sea view, it is not recommended to live here.

msg:The outside a**osphere is stylish, and the public area is well set up! But the room is not meticulous. The light control in the room is faulty, and it is still being repaired in the middle of the night. The bed in the parent-child room is too small, and the drying rack on the balcony is too short for underwear.
