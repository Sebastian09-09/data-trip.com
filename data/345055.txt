There was also a gym and swimming pool available. Subway train station is just opposite the hotel and Yu Garden is about 5 mins walk away. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again

msg:Room was clean and quiet. Temperature was fine. We experienced a strange noise in the air conditioning unit overnight but the hotel fixed it the next day. We had to pay a premium for 2 x adults and 2 x children, it seems difficult to get a family room for 2 children in China, which is frustrating and costly. Room only had one smoke hood despite being advertised as a family room. Hotel was clean throughout and quiet. Breakfast had a wide array of options and good coffee. However, some of the food, such as eggs, was on the cold side as it was pre-cooked and left out on warming trays. The pool and hot tub were in a far worse condition than the photos on the website suggest, the hot tub didn’t work and the poolside area was cluttered and has rust around it. The pool could do with a renovation. Location was good for the Bund and metro.

msg:The Renaissance Shanghai Yu Garden Hotel offers a mixed experience that balances some exceptional features with a few drawbacks. The highlight undoubtedly lies in the breathtaking views from the rooms, which provide an awe-inspiring outlook, offering a glimpse into the vibrant cityscape.

However, it's important to note that the building itself might show signs of age, which could be evident in the overall aesthetic and some facilities. The lack of amenities like self-service laundry might be a downside for guests looking for such conveniences during their stay.

Nevertheless, the hotel's prime location opposite the wholesale mall is a considerable advantage for guests interested in shopping or exploring the local area. This proximity to a bustling commercial center adds convenience and opportunities for guests to immerse themselves in the city's vibrant atmosphere and culture.

In summary, while the Renaissance Shanghai Yu Garden Hotel might have some limitations in terms of the building's age and absence of certain facilities like self-service laundry, its unbeatable views and strategic location opposite the wholesale mall make it a worthwhile choice for travelers looking to experience the vibrant energy of Shanghai.

msg:I was traveling with my family and we booked a night stay in this hotel. We were reluctant if the hotel would accept us since we didn’t have our passport with us. Our visa is still on renewal process and we just have that single receipt/paper  from the police. While other hotels were so strict with no passport no check in policy, I phoned the  Renaissance Yu Garden Hotel and got to speak with Quinzel ,I explained our situation why we didn’t have our passport with us. She assisted my all the way to checking in smoothly. At the same time she helped us upgrade our room to a bigger one with a beautiful view.  Finally we checked out late and we weren’t asked for extra charge. Quinzel granted our  requests and a big help for us  to have a wonderful stay at the hotel. Definitely we would come back and  stay here again. 
As to our room, it was spacious, tidy and the bed was comfortable as well. The breakfast was great, novel to the taste buds. Having lived in china for quite some time, the breakfast experience somewhat brought us somewhere beyond China, or even a taste from back home. The location of the hotel is at the heart of the city and at the same time at the doorstep  of metro line 10, which is very strategic in getting us to the different and major hotspots thru the metro. All in all  in a scale 1 to 10, where 10 is tops, I’ll give it an easy 20.

msg:This hotel boasts a favorable location, making it convenient for guests. However, there were some concerns regarding the room temperature during the stay. The centralized temperature control system maintained a consistent 24 degrees Celsius, which proved to be uncomfortably warm for us, leading to hot nights throughout our stay. Despite the hotel's effort to address the issue by providing a fan, it was mentioned that the fan's effectiveness was limited, offering only marginal relief. While the positive aspects of the hotel's location are acknowledged, the guest experience could be significantly improved by addressing and refining the room temperature control to ensure a more comfortable stay for all patrons.

Small but nice pool. My kid enjoyed the pool everyday.
Only thing a little bothering was the construction work noise across the road. At one occassion had to remove bunch of long black hair that was clogging the water drainage in the bathtub - which was gross to say the least.  
A few things - Hotel does not provide shampoos and shower gel in small size bottles. They are mounted in the shower. So was kind of confused how to use them when in the bath tub 😅 - get out from the bathtub, go into shower - few drops of shower gel, get back into the bathtub?
Iron and ironing board was provided but they were in terrible condition, had to wipe iron handles with alcohol wipes as it was stained by I don’t even know what, ironing board alos looked stained and dirty. 
Overall, liked the breakfast in the morning, liked they provide takeaway food containers for taking my breakfast into the room. 
Kindly allowed us late checkout, kept our luggage at the concierge service etc. 
Would stay again with extra cleanliness precautions.

msg:Excellent, that is all I can say. Shanghai is filled to the brim with great hotels but finding one that stands out is always difficult. The Renaissance in Yu Garden did it. Upon arrival we were greeted with smiling faces, 22h00 at night and just after a intense heatwave . It was extremely clean and COV-19 safe, we never had a doubt that we would be safe. The rooms have excellent views of the Bund and the financial centre and it is nice just taking in the scenery, especially at night. The hotel offers a bar, swimming pool and lounge but due to restriction’s placed on the city it wasn’t available. The breakfast buffet is excellent and offer both a good asian and western cuisine experience. We will miss the staff and our delivery robot named Room-bee!🤩

msg:Location was amazing being in short walking distance to the Yuyuan Gardens. The room was clean and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating. We forgot our passports and the staff allowed my kids and I to jump in the pool while my partner went home to retrieve them (we live in SH). The hot tub was more of a luck-warm tub, and the heating in our room was stuck to “on” which made it a little uncomfortable trying to sleep at night. Overall the service and accommodations would deserve another booking in the future.   Here’s a video showing a little bit of the room and hotel accommodations: https://youtu.be/lqfFIVF6lM4

msg:The hotel is quite good and front desk service great. The restaurant was sorely lacking. We went for lunch during the lunch service time, but our sandwiches took 45 minutes to arrive with no other guests besides us, they were cold, half the drinks were not available and it was not the quality I was expecting from a 5 star hotel restaurant. It was incorrectly prepared and tasteless. The staff started cleaning for evening service and the waiting staff left. The rooms were also too hot. The central heating should never be set at 26 degrees with no windows to open. The saving grace was that our room was upgraded and we had a stunning view of the Bund. I'd recommend that the staff in the Business lounge are also trained to prepare cocktails as we needed to fix these ourselves. Not a bad stay, but expected more.

The hotel restaurant has group purchase prices online. When I went there, I was told that I needed to book it one day in advance. I suspected that there was a diversion. I have never heard that group purchase meals need to be booked. No one was eating in the restaurant. The place is very small! I highly recommend staying in the hotel. If you want to eat, go to Chenghuang Temple. There are many snacks inside. It is very clean. Be sure to walk inside to find it. We didn't find it at first, so we ate at Shanghai Old Restaurant. It was quite expensive and too sweet. The service guy was good, but the taste was really not suitable!

She also took the initiative to ask if the children needed slippers. Because we were not sure about the daily schedule, the room we booked did not include breakfast. Sally carefully reminded us that if we needed breakfast, it would be cheaper to order it one day in advance than to buy it on the day. The four-day and three-night stay experience was still very good. The room was very spacious, the bed, pillows and quilts were very comfortable, and the two 1.4-meter beds were very good for a family of four. The view from our room was very good. We could see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the three-piece suit on the side. The handwritten welcome note and the weather forecast for the next day were also very warm. The hotel is in a good location, right next to Yuyuan subway station, close to Yuyuan and Chenghuang Temple, and about 20 minutes walk to the Bund and Nanjing Road. The children especially liked the infinity pool on the 21st floor. After swimming, they went to the gym to play for a while before returning to the room. In general, the hotel is very good in all aspects. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Shanghai. [Happy]

The staff is very nice. When I checked in, I learned that I had not booked a twin room and I had two and a half-year-old children. They directly upgraded me to a three-bed room and arranged for breakfast for the two children. I bought a child’s toothbrush and slippers, so worry-free!

Business is booming, so I only booked a king-size bed room. Kiven at the front desk is well-trained. Under the condition of a nearly full house, he quickly helped to change to a twin bed room and upgraded it to a river view room. Thumbs up.

msg:This time, I booked the Renaissance Yuyuan Hotel when I took my baby to Shanghai for fun. The hotel is in a great location. It is only a few hundred meters away from Yuyuan, Chenghuang Temple and the Bund. You can walk there to see the scenery. The hotel is 30 meters away from the subway entrance. The subway at the door can go directly to Line 10 at Hongqiao Station, which is very convenient.
I booked a twin room with two 1.4-meter beds, which is very suitable for traveling with two children. Many hotels do not have 1.4-meter twin rooms. It is uncomfortable for two adults and two children to stay in 1.8-meter beds or 1.2-meter twin beds. 1.4-meter twin beds are very suitable, and both children and adults can rest well.
The view outside the hotel window is also invincible. You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Huangpu River outside the window. Seeing the cargo ships on the river makes the children very excited.
The hotel service is really great. My hotel service manager Li Jing called me the day before check-in to inquire about my approximate check-in time and number of people, so as to facilitate the room arrangement. After knowing that I took my baby to Disneyland during the day and checked into the hotel late, she also thoughtfully arranged welcome fruit for me. The baby was tired and hungry when he entered the room and saw the fruit, which was so happy. Thank you very much! After checking out, Manager Li asked about my stay experience again. I really felt the hotel's meticulous care. I will choose to stay here next time I come to Shanghai!

On the day of check-in, he was upgraded to a Yuyuan Garden View Suite on the 9th floor for free, with various complimentary afternoon tea and hot food and wine services in the executive lounge. It made him feel instantly Make a lot of money.
The room is super big, quite new, and very clean. The hotel staff are very professional, and Coco's service attitude is even better. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is only a few hundred meters walk to the Chenghuang Temple and Yuyuan Garden, and it is also very close to the Bund. The only drawback is that the elevator is a bit slow during peak hours and the wait takes a little longer. Everything else is satisfactory.

It is right at the Yuyuan subway station. You can push your stroller from the barrier-free elevator to the ground and walk for a short time to the hotel.
After booking the hotel, a service manager contacted me. After learning that we were traveling as a family of three, my service manager, Li Liang, took the initiative to help me add a crib, upgrade the room, and increase the number of people with executive lounge privileges. , so that our family can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner.

The decoration of the hotel is relatively old, but the facilities are well maintained. I also experienced the swimming pool and gym on the top floor this time.

It’s very convenient to walk to Yuyuan Garden. I recommend Songyuelou vegetarian buns in Xiaochang and the shrimp slipper shop where you can scan the QR code to order. We recommend Dahuchun’s pan-fried buns and pork ribs rice cakes.
When I sent the express, I thought it would be troublesome to send a 24-inch box. The SF Express guy picked it up in less than an hour. I felt that the service around the hotel was also very good.

msg:After hesitating for a long time, I chose this store at the last moment. The price/performance ratio is very good. If you have a budget of 1,000 yuan near the Bund, choose this store. Taking into account the subway entrance, attractions, the Bund, landscape, rooms, and star ratings, there is no better value for money than this. I was worried that it would be early and there would be no place for the elderly to rest. Fortunately, I met Jerry and saw that it was a parent-child trip for the elderly and teenagers. Not only did he help upgrade the floor, he also coordinated early check-in. I saw a three-piece suit in the room. An unexpected surprise. Five stars. The service is indeed guaranteed.

I couldn't see the Oriental Pearl Tower due to the angle, but I could see the Yuyuan dragon lanterns. The children were very excited😁. Room maintenance It's very new, clean and sanitary. The customer service depar**ent's service is very good. He helps carry luggage to the room. There is a robot for cooking noodles. There are also special robots for delivering toiletries and takeaways. The only drawback is that the fan is too noisy at night and the room temperature is too high. The quality of sleep is a bit poor. There are discounts, but the faults are not hidden. During the Spring Festival, compared with the all-season DC next door, it is still more cost-effective! In addition, the location of the hotel is excellent. During my 2-day stay, I went to Xujiahui, Pudong Century Plaza, Lalaport, Xintiandi, Huaihai Road, the Bund, Nanjing Road, the Bund, and Jufu Chang. It was very convenient. You can also watch the lantern festival near the hotel at night. ! I will give it a priority next time I come to Shanghai!

msg:How should I put it? There is still a certain gap between it and a five-star hotel. Only the location is very close to the Yuyuan City God Temple, which is more convenient.
1. I called a day in advance and asked when I would arrive at the hotel. I was told that because it was during the Spring Festival, there would be no rooms in the morning and that they would be available in the afternoon. I thought it was understandable at the time. After all, the passenger flow was large, and I thought that a five-star hotel was considerate. As a result, When I arrived at 3:30 the next day, I was informed that both rooms had not been tidied up. One hour could be given to one room, and two rooms could be given in two hours. The elderly and children had wandered 20,000 steps out to arrive at the store late. The waiter suggested If we go shopping again😅 the kids will get a little noisy
2. After continuing to wander around, I came back to collect my room card. I heard someone asking for mineral water at the front desk. The front desk staff said that each room only has two bottles of water per day. If you get it today, you won’t be able to give it back tomorrow... It’s really the most stupid five-star I have ever seen. That's great. After all, the price is more than 1,000 per night. It doesn't matter if the refrigerator is empty. I won't give you an extra bottle of water. I'll buy water by myself.
3. When checking in, the front desk gave a check-in reminder, saying that due to the holiday period, late check-out service could not be provided. I had applied for it on Ctrip before, but it was not counted. I was a little confused. Since late check-out was not possible, the last check-out service was at 12 o'clock. The room is ready, why hasn’t the room been cleaned at 4 or 5 o’clock? Anyway, we checked out at 12 o’clock, so don’t affect the next family’s check-in.
4. The breakfast can only be said to be quite satisfactory, and there are not many varieties. I stayed at the International Hotel for two nights and one night at Zhujiajiao Seasons. I didn’t think this breakfast was as amazing as the previous two restaurants😅
5. The windows are closed and the air conditioner does not work well. The temperature is the same regardless of cooling or heating. The sound is extremely loud. The elevator is very slow and the wait takes a long time during peak hours.

When everyone is on holiday during the Spring Festival, it is the busiest time for the hotel staff, but what I felt from the beginning to the end of this stay was The hotel waiters are meticulous and considerate. Before checking in, Ms. Coco from the hotel contacted me in advance to understand the guests' check-in needs and make appropriate arrangements. During the stay, we can communicate in a timely manner throughout the entire stay and think about what the guests want. During the lantern festival, there were many guests in the hotel. During the morning rush hour, the waiters could tell that their voices were hoarse from working overtime continuously, but they could still arrange the meal and seating in an orderly manner, and even enthusiastically sent holiday greetings before leaving. It was a very pleasant stay experience. During my stay, I fully felt at home. I was also touched by the professionalism of the service staff in the hotel. I will definitely choose Renaissance Yu Garden when visiting Yu Garden in the future.

The service butler COCO contacted us in advance before check-in and handled it promptly during the check-in process. My parents, who are over 80 years old, had a comfortable and pleasant stay😀 Because my old father liked the hotel’s welcome fruit, the floor service staff specially went to add extra portions and adjusted the room temperature to be comfortable for them. During the festival, parking spaces were tight, and the security staff also tried their best to make arrangements. 2 I happily bid farewell to the old year and welcome the new. I sincerely thank you and wish you good luck in the Year of the Dragon.

Then when the time comes, pack up the troublesome luggage and send it directly to the room. I also specifically confirmed with the concierge at the front desk that I needed children's slippers and toiletries.
When we arrived at the store at 9 o'clock, we immediately saw that our suitcases were still at the front desk! I asked if the room was available? Say yes. Then why is the luggage not delivered to the room? Silent response.
I asked again, have the things I need been placed in the room? I don't know if I ask three questions.
When I got to the room, I laughed angrily~~~ No luggage was provided, and the children's slippers and toiletries I requested were not available. I didn’t even have the hand soap or washbasin soap I should have prepared! ! !
When I called the concierge, he hesitated and said he didn't know...
It is a 5-star hotel under the same collective brand, but the service is not as good as that of a Samsung Express Hotel! Taking advantage of the excellent geographical location, shouldn't the hardware be able to keep up and the software services should be improved?

But the facilities and services are really not flattering
I arrived at the hotel at two o'clock and was told that the room was not ready, so I went out for a walk. When I came back after six o'clock, I asked if it was not ready yet, so we were asked to sit next to it and wait for another ten minutes. Then I entered the room and looked at the toilet. There were no consumables that I had told you needed in advance😓
The phone didn't work at all (only the first time I called to ask someone to watch the TV was stuck, but the call never got through again). If you want anything, you have to go downstairs and find the front desk. The TV is also very laggy and almost unwatchable (there are only a dozen channels and not even cctv13, which is really humorous･ﾟ(ﾉヮ´)) and the video will not be played.
What is worthy of praise is that the porters are very enthusiastic and responsible (even the delivery boy!). This conscientious attitude can bring back the impression of this poor hardware hotel a lot.

Most hotels in downtown Shanghai have double rooms, but this one had rooms for four. Four people came on a trip and had a great time staying in one room.
I highly recommend Koreans to go there. There is a 7-Eleven convenience store nearby at Yewon Food Street!!

The river view room is a bit reluctant, and you can't find the river unless you look carefully. However, you can see the panoramic view of the Yu Garden Lantern Festival at night. The service is pretty good, the room is clean, but the facilities are a bit outdated and the air conditioner is loud. Overall, it's okay.

msg:Let me first talk about what I saw in the bad reviews, which made me very worried before checking in. 1. The facilities are dilapidated. I personally don't think it's very shabby. Before entering the room, I saw my aunt lying on the floor cleaning the carpet carefully. I think cleanliness is the most important thing. 2. Heat. This is true. The whole family felt like they were in a dryer. They contacted the front desk at 12 o'clock in the morning and a master came to adjust it immediately. Finally, explain why it received a five-star rating. 1. The location is excellent, next to the subway station and very close to Yu Garden within walking distance. 2. The service attitude. When you walk in, a handsome guy will ask about your needs and inform you of various precautions. When I checked in, I met Ellen Wang. She saw that I had a child with me and she was supposed to check in at three o'clock. She arranged the room in time to let us enter the room early and gave the baby biscuits. He also took the initiative to suggest that the child needed water for making milk, and arranged extra mineral water for us. We have also added WeChat. If you have any needs, just contact us via WeChat and we will respond.

But the bathroom is very big and clean, and the service at the front desk is great👏I also bought two bathrobes, which is a great deal! You have to grab the coffee for breakfast because there are so many foreigners! But the orange juice is particularly delicious! 100% organic, 0 additives. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is very convenient to walk to Nanjing Road, the night view of the Bund🌃 and visit the City God Temple. The subway entrance is right outside the door. This is the third time I have stayed at the Renaissance Hotel, and I still miss the Renaissance Nanjing!

One day I took my kids to Disneyland, and my parents just wandered around Yuyuan Garden, City God Temple, Nanjing Road, and the Bund. They were all within easy walking distance, and it was also close to the subway station when we went to Disneyland. The hotel is not new, but the management is very good and the rooms are very tidy. The service was very friendly, especially Kevin at the front desk, who helped the elderly upgrade to a room with a view. He also called the next day to ask about the check-in experience and any problems that needed to be solved. In short, this hotel is the best choice considering location and cost performance.

I invited friends to visit Shanghai and booked this Renaissance Yuyuan Hotel. The environment is good, the service is good, and the transportation is convenient. When you leave the hotel, you will find the Chenghuang Temple. Going forward is the Bund and then to Nanjing Road. When traveling to Shanghai, I highly recommend this Renaissance Hotel
The lady Barbara who greeted us at the front desk was great, her service was attentive and professional. Smile service throughout the process
The guys in the breakfast room are also great and will proactively provide services to customers.

The view was so beautiful. You could see the Huangpu River directly. Later, I found that the room next door was a bit noisy. I tried to ask if I could change to another room. They helped me upgrade to a suite and gave me fruits. I can see it. Go to the night view of the City God Temple and the architectural complex of Pudong. This is the first time I have experienced the feeling of being at home in a Marriott Hotel in China. The breakfast robot is fun to cook noodles and wontons, and the coffee is delicious. In addition, the hotel has a robot that delivers supplies, which is very innovative. A very recommended hotel. Parking downstairs is 20 yuan per time, and there is no additional charge for entry and exit. I am very satisfied.

The only shortcoming is that the hotel host has an intelligent voice response. If you want to add mineral water, you will only be given one bottle. Fortunately, I added more water when I was cleaning the next day.

The location is also good, just at the exit of Yuyuan subway station, so it is convenient to go anywhere. The price is not expensive around the Bund. After placing the order, the hotel arranged for the manager to contact him and specially helped prepare a Kumamon doll to be placed in the room. The room's windows were large and you could directly see the Oriental Pearl Tower. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provided a wide view. From check in to check out, the experience was good. There are so many foreigners in the hotel. It feels like there are more foreigners staying than Chinese.

I stayed at a hotel worth over RMB 1,000 during the National Day. Although I got a free upgrade to a room with a view, it is not necessarily a five-star hotel. When traveling to Shanghai, it is recommended to stay in a hotel of the same level near Nanjing Road. It is nearly 2km to walk to Nanjing Road and 1km+ to the Bund. There are no landscapes on the road.

Because it was National Day, there were a lot of people. When I arrived after 12 o'clock, I was told that the room was being cleaned and you could check in as soon as it was cleaned. This was great. The staff member Carlo was very enthusiastic and helped us inquire about the room situation. Overall very satisfied. I booked a family room with two large beds, which is more friendly to a family with two children, but the breakfast is not rich enough.

You can see the most beautiful night view and morning glow without going to the crowded Bund. The hotel is in an excellent location, close to the subway entrance of Line 10, and it is very convenient to get to the subway station. The hotel is only a ten-minute walk from the check-in attractions Yu Garden, City God Temple and the Bund. There is no more convenient location than this. Although the hotel was built in 2007, the facilities are not old, clean and hygienic, and there is an open-air bar overlooking the night view of the Huangpu River. The most noteworthy thing is that the hotel front desk staff, Barbara, is enthusiastic and attentive. She prepared thoughtful gifts for the children. She helped us upgrade children's breakfast and executive lounge benefits. We checked in in time for the Mid-Autumn Festival and gave us a mooncake gift box. She also gave us a gift before leaving the hotel. We brought a few bottles of water to drink on the way to remind us how to take a taxi at a cheaper price. Next time we come to Shanghai, we will definitely choose Renaissance Yuyuan Hotel without hesitation.

The room was on the 8th floor, so I almost was disappointed because it was low, but it was actually better.

The night view from the upper floors could be fully enjoyed from the swimming pool on the top floor. I spent a lot of time at the hotel because the gym (24 hours a day) and the swimming pool (8:00 to 10:00, changes frequently, with a sign in the room indicating usage times) are free to use at any time.
Breakfast (reservation the day before, payment the day before) and Chinese course meal set (no reservation required, same-day visit possible, eaten at the breakfast area, 30 yuan discount) dinner were also delicious. I had a good rest.

Then I happened to check Ctrip’s push notification and saw the Renaissance Yuyuan Hotel. Decisively quit and change here. The front desk of the hotel is located on the L floor. When you enter the lobby, you will receive Kiven's enthusiastic help. To be honest, I have stayed at the Peninsula, as well as the closed Four Seasons and Banyan Tree North Bund. This is the one where I feel the service is the best. Seeing that I was traveling with an elderly person and a child, and it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, they upgraded us to a river-view room for free, gave us a box of delicious mooncakes made by the hotel, and prepared children's slippers and dental kits for the children. A sincere smile is more than just a professional manager, serving customers sincerely. Although the hotel has seen some age, it is very clean and the double bed is large. I just happened to sleep with my third-grade daughter. The room does not smell messy and it is very quiet at night. The breakfast is very good, especially the steak in the morning is not synthetic meat, the noodles are also professionally prepared by robots, the service in the restaurant is also very good, and the hash browns taste great. All in all a good experience. The swimming pool staff were also very attentive. Only my daughter looked at me without blinking, but both staff members paid attention to the child with me and were very attentive. This was not done at Banyan Tree last year, and That water is super cold! To be honest, I am also in the service industry. It is really difficult to work in the service industry now. It is very stressful and everyone knows the reasons for it. So every time you travel, give them more tolerance, recognition, and understanding. I believe your journey will be more comfortable and your life will be much smoother. I wish Kiven and his colleagues all the best in their work and a happy Double Holidays🎉See you next time.

The hotel facilities are a bit old, but the service is very good. The breakfast has Chinese and Western styles, and the Chinese style is more distinctive, such as pan-fried buns. There are also flower rolls and vegetable and meat buns, and they taste good. The takeout counter is on the ground floor. You can order some special souvenirs and have them delivered to the takeout counter. You can pick them up when you return to the hotel. This is really convenient. You don’t have to run out to buy them yourself, which saves a lot of time. During our stay, the Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, and the hotel gave us a box of mooncakes, which were beautifully packaged. Thank you very much. Next time I go to Shanghai, I will choose Renaissance Yuyuan.

The hotel staff was very helpful and told us how to go to eat nearby. Because it was raining, we couldn't Just borrow our umbrella and use it. The hotel breakfast is very rich. Go out of the hotel gate and turn left into the alley, turn right out of the alley, you can go directly to Yuyuan Old Street, which is very convenient. The next time we come to Shanghai, the child asked us to stay in this room. The bed in the room is big and easy to sleep, and there is a bathtub. Recommended!

My companions and I were both in good condition during the day, but developed a severe cough at night.
I turned off the lights and went to bed at 11 o'clock when there were study activities the next day and I didn't fall asleep until 2 o'clock.
I called a plumber to fix it, but nothing could be done.
I asked to change rooms but they were not changed. I asked if there was something wrong with the room.
Say: Everyone’s feelings are different
I answered: The feeling can be different, but the temperature and breathing caused serious discomfort, which is no longer within the normal range.
I was not given a room change on the same day. I was changed to a room the next day. It was completely different from before. At least I could live in it.
This is the worst Marriott I've ever stayed in. It's really not as good as 7 Days Inn and Home Inn. My life was threatened. I got into a steam room?

You can have a panoramic view of the Huangpu River and the main buildings in Pudong. Unfortunately, there is no swimming at night, and it is only experienced the next morning. The breakfast is average and rich in variety, and the robots that make noodles and wonton stew are especially interesting.

Of course, there are also many delicious specialty snacks around, and the kids are very satisfied! ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻Thank you again to all the hotel staff.

When I checked in, I took my children with me and it happened to be the Lantern Festival. Coco and Elien thoughtfully gave me a small lantern to help. Together, they helped me escort the elderly upstairs and taught them how to operate the room. It was worthy of Marriott. Although the facilities are a bit old, it took a long time to build, but it is still acceptable! The most fun thing is the hotel breakfast, where robots cook wonton noodles. With the development of technology, the children said it was so fun.

2. At the buffet, I asked the front desk to make a reservation, and then asked me to be a Marriott member. If I wanted to have a meal, I had to show off.
3. Then order takeout by yourself and let the robot deliver it to your room. The answer is no, no food will be delivered. Until now, when I lived in a five-star hotel outside, the robot delivered it, and I had to go get it myself. The answer was also very awkward.
4. You called back the next day in the afternoon. I answered your questions seriously, told my true feelings, and said I would verify it, but then nothing happened. In this case, why bother calling back and wasting the customer’s time?
More than 1,300 per night is the trea**ent of such a high-end guest house. I will not stay there again.

When I returned to the room at night, I felt that the room was very small, and I could see the bed when I opened the door. I don't understand why there is a cloakroom wasting this space. The shower head in the bathroom is unstable and can’t be used if it keeps falling off. You can only use the shower on the ceiling, and it is facing the bathroom door. After taking a shower, the bathroom is full of water, and the bathroom door is tightly closed. It's almost 1 o'clock in the morning, and it feels like the sound of the external air conditioner is very noisy. I don't know if it is the construction site outside the hotel. Anyway, living on the 16th floor does not feel soundproof at all. Before I checked in, I specifically called the hotel to ask for a quiet room not close to the road. In short, it is not directly proportional to the price. Compared with other Marriott hotels I have stayed in, the rooms are poor. A very disappointing experience!
The only consolation is that the hotel's breakfast is not bad, there is freshly squeezed watermelon juice, and other drinks and food are also relatively rich. 6:40–10:30 am is very human.

msg:Environment: The location of the hotel is good, the view from the room is superb, the Town God Temple and Yu Garden are just downstairs. Just walk to Nanjing Road on the Bund. I took a picture of the landscape I took in the hotel.

Service: Kiven at the front desk is super considerate. I brought two children alone, helped me upgrade the room, and arranged breakfast for the two children. No matter what you ask him, he will arrange it clearly. For example: adjust the temperature of the air conditioner. He is afraid that I can't adjust it by myself, so he specially arranges for the master to help adjust it, which is super considerate. Children always praise others.

Hygiene: Not bad.

Facilities: There are others, all of which are quite complete.

In short, I am really satisfied with the hotel I booked this time. Thanks Kiven

msg:There is a subway station 30 meters from the hotel entrance, which is very convenient. This was the reason why I made the reservation. However, the reason that prompted me to comment was the service quality of the hotel. During check-in, Barbara at the front desk worked rigorously. When she found out that I had made a double reservation, she did not shirk or ignore it. She was very active in helping solve the problem from the guest's perspective and handled it. I have been very patient for more than half an hour. After various phone calls and coordination, it was finally confirmed that the correction could be made without any loss for me before I continued to deal with other matters. This makes me particularly grateful! In addition, I would go to the restaurant to turn on the water every night when I checked in. The girl in the restaurant was very considerate. When she saw me in the next few days, she took the initiative to ask for help. When you are in a foreign land, the kindness of strangers is most precious. The hotel's hardware may be unsatisfactory, but its soft power is really remarkable in Shanghai's service industry, which is generally over-the-top. As ordinary people, we must applaud such a group of hard-working people!

The view from the room is very good, you can see the lights of the tall buildings on the Bund at night. The location is also very good. The Town God’s Temple, the Bund, and mm Dou Lego are all within walking distance. Even if you go to Disneyland, it takes a little more than an hour to get there by subway. When we arrived at Disneyland at 10 am on Saturday, there was basically no queue. The food in the executive lounge is very convenient, and there are many types. It is hot in summer, and the children come back to rest after going out for a few hours. Breakfast, afternoon tea, and dinner are just what they need. Thanks to coco, yuki, and jessica in the executive lounge for their professional and considerate services ! I will choose here next time I come to Shanghai~

The location is excellent, not far from Nanjing Road and the Bund, and next to Yu Garden. It is very convenient to watch the lantern show at night. There is a subway station downstairs. It is very convenient to book an executive room with executive benefits. You don't have to go up and downstairs to have breakfast. The facilities are a bit old, but the quality is OK, it feels like an old five-star hotel, and the service is very good. The disadvantages are: the check-in process was too slow, taking more than ten minutes. After checking in, I asked for some toiletries, but no small bag was provided. The end result was that I was holding a pile of toiletries with my newly used ID and room card in my hand. I still have to carry my luggage and swipe my card to press the elevator. It’s really confusing.

Good location, no other advantages. To enter the door, you need to go from the first floor to the fourth floor to check in. Check-in personnel kiven service is so-so. The night view of the Yu Garden in the reserved room is not bad. There is an open-air bar on the top floor with a view of Pudong Three-piece.

There are a lot of people at the hotel for breakfast. It may be due to the queues every day during the peak tourist season. The dishes are not bad. The breakfasts in star hotels are similar...
Let’s talk about the location, it’s really convenient😁 You can go anywhere by subway, it’s very close to the subway entrance, and it’s super close to Yu Garden from the hotel. I compared three hotels and chose this hotel for the convenience of travel...
The service of the hotel is still ok, adjust the appropriate room in time according to our requirements

1. Arrived at the hotel after 12:00 noon, and was told that it would take more than an hour to check in. After depositing the luggage, it was still impossible to check in when I came back after 4 pm, and I couldn't indicate the check-in time. Only through third-party coordination can I check in within 15 minutes. I thought I could move in smoothly by upgrading to an executive floor, but something worse happened.

2. After resting for a while, I was going to wash the dirty clothes I had played in the past few days. I opened the shower room door and smelled a pungent smell. I also felt uncomfortable in my throat, and the smell of the renovation site was strong. I immediately found that the "beautiful seam" in the shower room was newly filled. Anyone who has renovated the house knows that this needs to be aired for more than 24 hours before the pungent smell disappears. It just doesn't disappear. Easy to smell, formaldehyde does not. Use shop guests as human absorbers? ! It is still necessary for a third party to assist in communicating and changing rooms.

3. Changed directly from 1919 on the 19th floor to 1519 downstairs, and the upgraded executive room was lowered back to the previously reserved view room. Since I was looking for toothbrush in the previous room, I saw that the room was equipped with "bath salts, mouthwash" and other items. I asked "there is no mouthwash in the room, can you give me a bottle?" It will be equipped, but this floor is not available." I didn't force it, and told me to give it to me, and emphasized to me again that I shouldn't get it.

4. I will travel during the winter and summer vacations, and every time I bring a baby, it is also a five-star hotel. This is the only one who has a long queue for breakfast, so I should improve my efficiency. The hotel also thinks that this is the case during the peak summer vacation, and other cities and other brands are not like this...

In short, a very good hotel, and I will book it next time.

msg:This time when we stayed at Renaissance Yuyuan, in addition to the complete, clean and comfortable facilities of the hotel, we also liked the services of the swimming pool and lounge on the top floor. Especially the lounge made us feel more intimate. During our stay, there was one day where we had not seen each other for 8 years. Old friends came to the hotel to meet us at odd hours. Because it was before the New Year, all the surrounding restaurants were overcrowded and we couldn't find a suitable place to meet. Li Liang, the manager of the hotel's L Lounge, found out about this and specially opened a conference room for us. It provided for our gatherings and meals, and also helped us adjust the equipment so that the children could play as much as they wanted and the adults could chat without being disturbed. This is the most considerate and sincere service I have experienced since returning to China. Manager Li Liang was very considerate for us and made our party very enjoyable and enjoyable. He really likes and praises the convenience provided by the lounge and the customer-oriented concept, making this hotel one of our must-choose hotels when we return to China. .

This type of room can see the Oriental Pearl Tower through the window, and a little bit of Huangpu River view, which is very good.
The hotel's hardware equipment is really bad. The inductive elevator control card often cannot be sensed. As a result, I have to wait in the elevator and have no time to swipe. I have to go to the L floor to change the channel and try again. Whether an update is required.
Betty in the housekeeping depar**ent is very nice and the service is great! And the people in the concierge, five points are for them.

The hotel also has a parking lot, which costs 20 yuan a day for guests, which is not expensive. Hotels at this price near the Bund do not have a parking lot. It is more convenient to drive here from other places.
Room decoration facilities are not new, but fortunately relatively clean. We stayed for two nights, and the sanitation was cleaned every day. The bed sheets and quilts we brought were also laid by room service for us.
The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, and it ends at 10:30, so you can have breakfast without getting up very early.
Generally speaking, it is more comfortable to live

- The service, always impeccable and professional. Very attentive and fast. Very simple communication.

- The facilities are not the best compared to other hotels in the city, but logically they are on par with a hotel of such reputation and quality. The rooms are great.

- The breakfast is very complete.

- The location is excellent! Just a 3-minute walk away you are inside the ''Yuyuan Garden'', an excellent tourist attraction. And at the same time very close to ''The Bund'', where you can enjoy a great walk while enjoying the spectacular views of the city, especially at night.

Conclusion, if you are looking for a 5-star Hotel, very well located, with great service, and a reasonable price taking into account all the above, this is without a doubt the best for you.

Kiven helped with the check-in. When I saw a child, his room was postponed to three o'clock, so I asked him to contact us via WeChat if he needed it. The room is also arranged with a view room as much as possible, where you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower. Children like to see the cars and night scenery outside through the floor-to-ceiling windows. One disadvantage is that the room decoration is a bit old, and the other is that the central air-conditioning and heating are average. People from the north are not used to the temperature at night. When I consulted the front desk the next day, they gave me a radiator. The overall experience is better than the service and location.

The breakfast is very rich, and it’s my favorite breakfast! Children love to eat too~ The transportation is also very convenient, the No. 10 Yuyuan Station is downstairs~
Especially the room manager, Kevin, was very enthusiastic and saw that I was a member and immediately upgraded us to a view room~ The floor arranged is also very quiet and comfortable~
There are no pedals for the child to wash up, and the staff will be quickly arranged to deliver it~ Special snacks are also given as a gift~ Very attentive! The hotel currently adopts non-contact service, and robots are responsible for delivering the needed things to the guest rooms. There is also an automatic takeaway cabinet downstairs for ordering takeout, which is convenient and fast! If you choose to believe again, we will come again

Although the facilities are not as good as those of newly built hotels, they are adequate and can be maintained. The design of the room is quite warm and fresh. Because I brought children and the elderly, the front desk upgraded the room for free when the original room type had to wait for cleaning. The upgraded Bund view room really has a very good view. The Shanghai sightseeing bus stops opposite the hotel , The subway is in front of the hotel, and it takes 15 minutes to walk to the Bund, Shiliupu, and Pedestrian Street.

It is mainly located in a quiet location in the middle of the bustle, with convenient transportation and many places to hang out in the surrounding area. The check-in experience this time was still good. Ms. Ellen Wang at the reception desk was very warm and considerate, and she also took the initiative to correct minor mistakes in the membership system. Because I had to catch an earlier international flight the next day, after asking, the hotel specially prepared a rich breakfast box for me to take away when I left the hotel in the early morning. A very pleasant stay.
A small reminder, the floor in the toilet room is prone to slipping when using hotel slippers. You need to pay attention to safety assessment to see if it is due to the material of the floor tiles, surface waxing or slipper soles to avoid accidents for guests.

When I came out of Exit 3 of Yuyuan Station on Metro Line 10, I looked up and saw that it only takes five or six minutes to go to Yuyuan Garden and Chenghuang Temple, and it is not far from the Bund. Very convenient. The hotel facilities are also very clean and tidy. After a busy day, taking a bath in the bathtub is very relaxing. I was very lucky. The person who helped me check in was the front desk manager Barbara. She was skilled in business and friendly in attitude. She always served with a gentle smile, which made me feel very comfortable. She took the initiative to upgrade my room type and also gave me breakfast. There were welcome fruits in the room. There is also a handwritten welcome letter written by a dedicated butler.

The room is clean, but the TV cannot connect to the Internet and watch movies. The switch for adjusting the hot water for bathing was broken again. I called the counter and asked a technician to come and repair it. However, after the repair, the bathing water was still so hot that it smoked. Fortunately, we booked two rooms and had to go to the other room to take a shower.
The price of the hotel is so expensive, but the quality of services and facilities are not worthy of the price. It is not recommended to choose this hotel.

msg:This is the first time I write a review in my life. We are traveling as a family and have booked 5 executive rooms. Let me talk about my experience. The hotel entrance is extremely narrow and it is inconvenient to get on the car. There is an unpleasant toilet smell when checking in on the 4th floor. Free breakfast. I didn't eat a bite, so I can't comment, but all my family members said it was too delicious. The executive floors of the hotel are from the 17th to the 20th floor. Among them, the executive suite I booked was arranged for me on the 11th floor. I asked why Ah, they said that the suites on the 5th to 20th floors of their hotel are all executive suites. This was the first time I heard about it, and they finally arranged me on the 16th floor. What’s especially important is that the hotel’s toilet must have two power levels. It took me three times or three times to flush out your poop. I was really convinced. Finally, we had dinner in the executive lounge. The manager of the lounge made things difficult for us in every possible way. Finally, I told him for a long time before he understood our request, but He first rejected all our ideas. I think that as a service industry, we should deal with it as humanely as possible without affecting the hotel and other individuals, instead of using the hotel's rigid rules to argue with guests... Just write Come here, everyone can refer to it. If anyone is still willing to live there, it doesn’t matter. Tell everyone about your toilet experience.

My daughter had gastrointestinal problems after returning from abroad and vomited on the bed in the middle of the night. When we called customer service, they quickly changed us to clean quilts, mattresses and sheets without any complaints. The room is spacious and has good facilities. The location is conveniently next to Yuyuan Garden. The hotel's customer service and porters were very polite. It was a very good stay experience, five-star rating.

Advantages: It is only a few steps away from the Chenghuang Temple, which can be said to be just downstairs of the hotel; the service in the lounge is very good, and the view is also super good. It can be said that the lounge has raised the overall rating.
Disadvantages: The air conditioner in the room is not well adjusted, and it is very stuffy; the cold water in the shower faucet in one of the two executive rooms booked is broken, and it can only be used after repairing at night. It is better to check it frequently.
The robot below is very interesting ☺️
But as far as the lounge and location are concerned, I still recommend it.

msg:When I checked in at 1:40 pm, I was told that the room still needed to be cleaned, which would take at least an hour. It was said that cleaning could be expedited, but we still had to wait for an hour, especially since one of my children fell asleep. While waiting, no one came to greet me or proactively told me how long it would take. The feeling of "love can't live" is revealed everywhere. Standardized, but temperature. The phone call after check-in was also mechanically told to "give me a good review". When I answered the call from the hotel, I had to wait for 10 seconds before the other party made a sound. It felt like I had received an automated sales call. I had to wait for a long time before the sound came. I didn’t even know that the other party was calling me for the first few seconds. What are you calling for? In short, the location and hardware are good, but the service is not as good as a three-star hotel.

Unexpectedly, the state of the hardware resources in the Renaissance Shanghai Yu Garden Hotel is so disappointing! Dissatisfaction everywhere in the bathroom: damaged charging socket, damaged bathtub floor drain switch, bad scale, lack of clean, tidy and fluffy bathrobes! One dissatisfaction outside the bathroom: the damaged air vent of the central air conditioner creaked, and I couldn't sleep after being woken up at 2 am! Completely from the five details, the five stars hanging on the facade are slapped! The only thing that gives the hotel a good appearance is the reception desk on the first floor, where 3 men and 1 woman provide warm and warm service! Post a photo of people in Shanghai in a taxi. The color of the sky is very similar to the mood after staying in Shanghai Renaissance Hotel!

msg:It was very average. I originally booked a family room with 2 1.8-inch beds. The front desk took the initiative to upgrade it to a so-called view room. I thought it would not be worse than what I booked, and I was going to give a good review after staying there. I didn't expect the room type to be irregular. The extra bed was a folding bed about 1 meter long. It squeaked when it was moved, and the children couldn't turn over. It was very noisy all night. The flushing of the toilet was also a big problem. It took several attempts to flush it. I came back late from an outing and was very disappointed to see the extra bed. I could see a few long hairs in the room. I was speechless. The so-called view room faces east, and you can sunbathe early in the morning. 1600+ a night is too low cost-effective, the hardware is too poor, and it was a relatively poor experience. I will not be a repeat customer.

msg:Parents want to come to Shanghai for fun, Yuyuan Renaissance is the most suitable place! Mainly considering that the legs and feet are not very convenient for the elderly, it is very close to Yuyuan Garden, Town God's Temple, the Bund, and Pedestrian Street, so you can go for a walk. The reception service at the front desk is also very good. When I checked in, a young lady with short hair even provided a room upgrade service (higher floors and bigger rooms, but my parents wanted to see the scenery of the Bund, so I stayed on the 7th floor). A breakfast ticket was given as a gift, perfect! This trip to Shanghai is very pleasant, and one of the reasons is the comfortable stay in the Renaissance Yu Garden.

msg:Perhaps the expectations for the Renaissance are too high. First of all, the hotel is old at first glance, and the decoration is a bit old. The most dissatisfied should be the service. When I checked in, the front desk told me that you booked a business double room. I said it was wrong. I booked a parent-child room. The other party smiled contemptuously and said, just decorate it sofa. At that time, I was very angry, why did the same room come up with different gimmicks, and charged more money! Then, my order included three tickets for the Yuyuan Lantern Festival, but the front desk didn’t take the initiative to give it to me. I asked the front desk, and the front desk told me that they didn’t even check. Only the executive room can send tickets. I have repeatedly emphasized that it is in my package I had a ticket, but in the end there was a stalemate. He asked a colleague to check and found that I had a ticket, so he gave it to me. I am really helpless, where does their sense of superiority come from? Besides, the room is really small, the windows cannot be opened, and the air conditioner is very noisy.

I experienced bedside dancers and KTV on the upper floor, and then the bathtub in the picture was missing, and the trash can had no garbage bags. When I got out of the elevator, I saw it first. Know who threw the trash! Is this also a five-star hotel? It's simply a scam, and what's the situation with the scratches on the elevator? Are werewolves killed? I ordered a takeaway at night and there was no robot to deliver it to me. I saw the robot sleeping at the front desk. The delivery man said that no one operated it and threw me the takeaway cabinet on the first floor. In winter, I was shivering from the cold, and the air conditioner was too hot. Adjust the temperature, fire and ice

msg:This should be the first hotel I got a bad review on Ctrip regarding service. The hotel location is very good, close to the Chenghuang Temple and Yuyuan subway station. I also chose the location because of the location. The room facilities are actually not bad, but the ones facing the road are better. It was noisy and affected my sleep. Although I specifically said hello and tried to arrange a quieter room, the result... The reason why I canceled the reservation for the next day was mainly because the service attitude of the hotel staff was really not good. Maybe it was because I was staying in the hotel. There are more foreigners, so the enthusiasm for service must be given to foreigners. I took a child alone and dragged two large pieces of luggage and countless shopping bags out to take a taxi. The staff on the first floor was busy helping a young foreigner pick up his luggage and call for a taxi. In the end, it took me a long time to call the service staff. The person who helped me with my luggage... This was indeed the first time this happened to a hotel of the same level, so I gave it to the Renaissance Hotel for the first time with a bad service review, and I probably won't stay there again in the future :)

The room is also very clean, the cleaning aunt is very discerning, and the delivery of things in the room is done by small robots, which is very cute.
Breakfast: Due to the epidemic, we cannot dine in, and the variety has not decreased. Pack it back to the room and enjoy it slowly.

2. The sound insulation is extremely poor, you can clearly hear what songs are being sung by the ktv downstairs, which seriously affects your sleep, and you can't fall asleep until 2 o'clock in the middle of the night
3. When poor sound insulation seriously affects sleep, call the front desk. The front desk manager has a bad attitude and says that he can't change the room and can't solve it

You can see the night view of the Bund. The hotel service staff is very good, and the robot delivery of goods is the highlight. It's just that it was set to include breakfast at that time, and why was there not when I checked in, there is a high probability of choosing it next time.

Every waiter you meet after entering the door will nod and say hello, which is very polite. Booked a business room, the room window can see the Pudong three-piece suite, the scenery is pleasant.
The room is gifted with executive courtesy. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the lounge on the 17th floor brighten up the glasses, and the beautiful view of Pudong can be seen, and it is even more beautiful at night.
The breakfast is very rich, and the robot cooks the noodles, which is very attractive. The only regret is that the swimming pool is temporarily closed during the epidemic. Will come to stay next time.

It was just fine.
Although the hotel room is on the 12th floor, not a high floor, the window faces the financial center and the sightseeing hall, and the night view is particularly good. The concierge was very attentive. Even though there were only two handbags, they also helped me directly to the car at the door from the lobby. The casual observation was also in place. If you don't have to put forward an improvement suggestion, the sewer pipes of the shower room can be better checked. Just perfect.

The room condition was clean and not bad, but it was a bit disappointing that the facilities were old. I didn't particularly want or request a view, but it didn't seem like all the rooms were full, so I felt like the room I was assigned wasn't sincere; Breakfast also had fewer varieties and items than expected.

The only regret is when I have breakfast
The attitude of the chef in the breakfast buffet was too fierce. Because we had to have a meeting and asked for a bowl of wontons, we had to wait for a long time, so I asked the chef to cook it instead of the robot, but the chef actually trained us to be more fierce than the owner of the fly restaurant on the street.
I just suggest that the hotel strengthen the training of chefs in the cafeteria. I don't understand a little politeness, and there is no service. The experience is really uncomfortable. Because of the chef, I changed the hotel the next day.

You still complain about me. It’s really funny. Even chain hotels can’t compare with who gave you a five-star rating. It doesn’t look like a five-star. As soon as you enter the lobby, it’s full of cheap fragrances. The smell is really disgusting.

I can only take the baby to hang out. The baby is actually I would love to be in the room first. Then the hygiene is also very general. The children want to take a bath. I don’t approve of bathing in the bathtub outside. But the baby wants to take a bath too much. The mother wants to put some water first and I will wipe it again for them. Then I found a root hair. It took five or six minutes for my husband to take a bath in the shower room. When he came out, he said he would find someone to repair it. Because the water wouldn't go out, the water was about to come out after he washed for a while. It took a long time for the water to finish. Later, the staff said that it was a little blocked. If it is still blocked, take the floor drain away, which is also very speechless😓. There are also few TV channels, and they are not clear. There are still many criticisms of this old hotel.

msg:Don't blow or step on it, write a review carefully, show it to the hotel executives, and also show it to the guests who are about to stay.

I checked in on January 31st during the Spring Festival of 2022 and settled on February 6th.
The overall evaluation is, [will not go again].

advantage:
1. When I checked in, ellen at the front desk helped me upgrade my room and stayed separate from the floor of the senior tour group to avoid noise. Thanks to this girl.

2. The room attendant candy, she has been cleaning the room for us during the stay. The person is very nice and serious, and the service is in place, thank you!

3. Floor supervisors Wang Pingmei, Wu Xiaofen, Christy, thank you three, every night during the Spring Festival, I will come to the room to give a red envelope of gold coins, chocolate, candy 🍬 and other small gifts, I still feel very happy.

4. When I left the hotel, I forgot the small card of the Buddha statue in the hotel. When I remembered it at night, I called the front desk and found it. Thank you for mailing SF Express to me. Thanks to the guy who was on duty that night.

5. The room was very warm on the first night of staying in the room. The temperature in the next few nights was lower than the next day. On the fourth day, after communicating with the hotel, two young brothers from the engineering department came to repair the air conditioner quickly. OK, great.

Next, let's talk about why you don't want to live anymore [disadvantages]

1. The worst thing is the breakfast. Even if there are 27 rooms on each floor, after a rough calculation, there are about 700-1000 guests when the room is full.

There are less than 200 seats in the breakfast restaurant. Although it is said to be eating in different times, there will be very few people when it is too early or too late. Most people still pour into the restaurant during the time period of 7:30-8:30.

The mismatch between the number of hotel restaurants and the number of guests results in congestion and queuing when the traffic is large. . . Even if all the western restaurants on the opposite side are used, there is a long queue waiting for boarding during peak hours. Want to eat? Excuse me, let's wait in line first! During the Spring Festival, during the peak period, every day is like this, really enough!

Besides, after entering the restaurant, the water glass was gone, and the one-time use was also used up, and there was no water glass at all. I wanted to use a bowl to get some water to drink, but the bowl was also used up. . . Not to mention the food, it's good to have something to eat, but also pay attention to quality? smell? surroundings? This is a breakfast that costs more than 200 yuan per person. It's hard to think about it, and I feel like I'm here to seek abuse. Every day when I go downstairs for breakfast, I feel very uncomfortable. I really suffer from eating a meal!

The waiters were all very nice, everyone worked hard and worked hard.

I just want to ask the executives, do you know the number of occupants per day? Why not make arrangements in advance, and why not prepare for an emergency? Is it that hard? Just so inexperienced?

I ate a few dinners in the hotel, looked at the broken tableware, just took it out to entertain guests, and charged a 15% service charge. Except for the fresh wontons on February 1, the next two days were all fresh. It smells bad, I reminded it, it still smells bad when it is delivered, which is very disgusting.

2. The glass of the bedroom, the pictures of the scenery outside the window were taken by me almost on the glass. The angle of the room is a problem. If you want to see the beautiful scenery, you have to stand at a specific angle in the room to be more beautiful.

However, the glass is so dirty, can you clean it a little? Please see the photo below, the black ash on the glass, one after another. . . I didn't dare to take pictures during the day, and the pictures I took were full of black *****es! Have stayed in so many hotels, your home is the dirtiest!

3. The bedding problem in the bedroom, this time we went to live with two big and one small, and all three of them had skin itching problems, which means the bedding was not clean. , causing sensitive skin problems. This is not necessarily a hotel problem, but the laundry room detergent used in the hotel should be managed properly, there is really a problem!

To sum up, from the front desk to the guest room, from the cleaning to the restaurant waiter, everyone worked hard to delight the guests with their services. You have worked hard!

But the upper management of this hotel should really pay attention to the management, dirty glass, broken tableware, crowded breakfast reception, these should not appear in this price hotel.

As an old Ctrip member, this is the worst experience I have ever had. In the future, unless you want to find guilt, you will not take the initiative to stay.

msg:Unable to go out due to the epidemic, I chose Renaissance Yuyuan Garden for the weekend. The first thing that caught your eye when you arrived at the store was the warm-colored lobby. Some netizens said that they didn't like the layout of the lobby, which seemed a bit crowded and messy. But I feel that it is compact and orderly, and I still like this style of lobby. After arriving at the front desk, I upgraded to a refreshing and comfortable bedroom on the 16th floor. The quality of sleep throughout the night was indeed good. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the surrounding transportation is convenient, especially when you go to Yuyuan Garden, you can reach it with your legs raised. After talking about the advantages, talk about a hidden danger, a fault, and a shortcoming. A hidden danger is that there is no lifeguard on site in the swimming pool, so in case of an emergency, it is too late to distinguish and rescue by monitoring; a serious injury is that the bath water in the guest room is only about 40 degrees, and guests who like to take a hot bath in winter may It will feel more rushing and colder; one shortcoming is that there are too few parking spaces, and self-driving residents may feel inconvenient. As long as there is parking, the parking fee of 20 yuan a day does not matter. Overall, it is worth staying.

msg:This time I am very satisfied with my choice of Renaissance Yuyuan Hotel. It is very close to Yuyuan Garden, Yuyuan Mall is nearby, and there are many time-honored brands on Dianping. The night scene is particularly beautiful at night, and it is just right for eating, drinking and having fun. It is also convenient to travel, very close to Yuyuan Station of Metro Line 10. The hotel is an old five-star hotel, but the facilities are not old, the key is to be particularly clean and tidy. I usually don’t like to live in a hotel with carpets. I feel that the carpets in old hotels are not clean, but the carpets in this hotel feel very clean, and the overall stay is very comfortable. And the lighting is very good, it can be turned on and off with one button, the brightness is suitable, and it is very convenient. The breakfast is particularly good, the variety is very, very rich and can adapt to all tastes. I like milk oa**eal most, some are hot and some are cold. There is also teriyaki chicken for breakfast, which tastes great. Recommend everyone to experience!

msg:1. The location of the hotel is good. There is a subway station within a few minutes of going out. The transportation is very convenient and it is very convenient to take a taxi. The entrance is Henan Middle Road with dense traffic.
2. Yu Garden and Chenghuang Temple attractions are about 5 minutes' walk away. If you have a snack, there are many things to choose from in Yuyuan Mall.
3. The hotel is easy to find. The name of the hotel on the outer wall can be seen far from the roadside. The concierge service in the lobby is very good. They actively help with the luggage and get off the car, and they will be guided to the service desk upstairs to go through the formalities.
4. The front desk clerk is also very caring. I have booked two different room types to help me arrange them together as much as possible. The room area is larger, and the higher floor has a better line of sight.
5. The room has been renovated and maintained well before, and it doesn't look outdated. The size of the bed is good. The floor attendant will greet you when you meet. If you need to call, you will deal with it soon.
6. The breakfast variety is not too much, and the taste is okay. The fruit and juice drinks are not complete. It may be because there are fewer people staying. I hope that there will be some improvement in this area in the future.
7. There is a gym on the top floor for exercise, and there is an indoor swimming pool next to it. It is very comfortable to see the night scene from the top of the field of vision. Just arrange the time and start playing overseas after 10 o'clock in the evening.
8. The experience of staying in this time is good, and I am satisfied with the hardware and service quality of the hotel.

The air conditioning in the room I got for the first time was very loud and noisy, and it felt like a "corner" room. I went directly to the front desk and asked for a room change, but I didn't expect it to be the same room type on several floors. Maybe I didn't subscribe to the administration, but I don't think this is the problem. Apart from being very close to the subway station, nothing special, right? I can't think of any reason to choose Yuyuan Renaissance again.

The health of the whole hotel is good and the transportation is convenient. There are direct buses and subways to Nanjing Road at the entrance, which is more suitable for tourists.
But the ambience is very bad, the whole check-in process from queuing to check in to breakfast the next day is very bad.
All kinds of uncles and aunts jumped in the queue to grab breakfast! The door asks to queue but does not stop the queue. Only the honest people are forcibly stopped, but the queue jumpers are not stopped!
There is also a problem with the amenities in the hotel room, but there is only one pair of slippers for double occupancy.
The customer service attitude is good, and it is not bad to make up for this in the first time.
The welcome at the door requires a health code for a while, and then a room card is required to enter the door. Management is very free and loose!

But the hotel is too old, there are windows that cannot be opened, we didn't expect this to have a great impact on us. The air in the room is not ventilated, and it is very unfriendly to guests with allergies. When I leave the hotel, I have rhinitis and can't breathe normally.
The night view of the infinity pool is good, but why are some residents of such poor quality that their nails are clipped on the loungers?
It is estimated that there are more guests than expected during the Chinese New Year, and the breakfast scene is chaotic, even standing and waiting! It would be better to order more than 10 o'clock, but unfortunately a lot of food and tableware did not keep up. The quilt in the room was too thin, which made my rhinitis worse!

Museums, exhibition halls, Yu Garden, and Chenghuang Temple are all within 2 kilometers. The hotel can see the Bund buildings, which is really convenient to take children there. The hotel service is very good. As soon as you enter the door, someone will help you take the luggage to the room. There is a place to store takeaways on the first floor, which is very convenient👍
Finally, I would like to specially mention the service of kiven, the front desk of the hotel check-in. He is enthusiastic and considerate of customers. He helped upgrade the room according to our needs. He specially chose a room on a high floor with more night views. It is a great service. 👍👍👍

The hotel is dilapidated, old and musty. I won’t be on a business trip on July 7. My wife wanted to go to dinner with her 15-month-old baby, and asked the hotel staff where to eat? The waiter instructed my wife to go to the executive lounge. My wife took a look at a few vegetable buffets inside, and then sat down. After all, it is not convenient to run around with the child. She prepared a plate for feeding the child, rely on it, heavy salt and heavy oil, try A bite, really nauseous, not for humans, and then took a few slices of watermelon and fed the baby and left, pay the bill, it’s incredible, 350 oceans, this black shop is crazy for money, no one is bad for money, but Can't stand their full routines, shouldn't you go to the restaurant to eat? Why point someone to the executive lounge? A woman takes a baby over a year old to drink? Can't stand such bullying of women and children, and don't talk about martial ethics at all for a few bad money!

There was no one from the hotel to accompany me to the hospital. I just called for a taxi. I wiped the water on the floor and left. Nothing more to say. If I hadn't looked for them the next day, they wouldn't have even asked. The location is very good, right next to Yuyuan subway station. I waited for an hour to get a view room, but the room service was poor. The room is not cleaned. If you go out in the morning, it will still be the same when you come back in the afternoon. In short, if it weren't for the night view of Shanghai from the view room, I wouldn't choose this place again. If you come to Shanghai in the future and want to see a different view, I really don’t recommend this. By the way, when I came back the next day, I saw an old man on the first floor who fell down and lay down. His colleagues helped him up, and the hotel attendant on the first floor pretended not to notice. We fell down in the hotel. The second time, both of our arms were purple and our head was numb. Although the hotels we have stayed in before were all a bit slippery, this one was too exaggerated. We could even fall down in the lobby on the first floor. When I left, the front desk gave me a good review and a small umbrella that can be used by children. I feel that I must talk about the fall.

msg:Let’s talk about the conclusion first: The hotel has a bad review among bad reviews, but Ctrip’s customer service handling has given it a five-star rating.
During the epidemic, I specially chose a hotel with windows and good ventilation to stay for 2 days. I got off the subway and checked in at the hotel at around 11 o'clock that night. As soon as I stepped out of the elevator door, there was a smell of inferior water mold. I thought the room would be better. , it turns out that the so-called window in the hotel room is literally a piece of glass. There is no window for ventilation in the entire room. The musty smell in the room is like it has been fermented for many years. It is really unbearable.
I immediately went to the front desk to communicate with the manager. The manager said that all the rooms in the hotel had no windows for ventilation, and said that refunds could not be made (it took less than 10 minutes from entering the room to leaving the room. The room remained the same). Fortunately, it was nearby at night. Find ibis Express Hotel and check in.
I communicated with the hotel again the next day, and the hotel said they could only refund the fee for the second day, and forcefully explained that the glass was a floor-to-ceiling window, and the floor-to-ceiling window could not be opened, but it was still a window, and the musty smell in the room was my personal subjective opinion. I was relieved that later Ctrip customer service was willing to compensate me for the next day’s room fee.
Finally: The attitude and efficiency in handling problems cannot even be compared to that of a fast hotel. I really don’t know how to get a five-star rating. You can verify the smell in the room for yourself. Is it my subjective opinion or objective fact? I encountered this during the Golden Week This kind of thing is really terrible. I didn’t expect that the hotel with a magnificent appearance would be ruined.

Very bad experience! During the stay, the service staff directly swiped the card to enter the hotel without ringing the doorbell. There was a big management problem.

The toilet was not flushed well. Check-in and billing were also as slow as ever. I don’t plan to come again next time. Staying here, the experience of Westin with Marriott next to it is much better.

msg:When I arrived at the hotel after six o'clock in the evening, without receiving any advance notice, I was told that the previous wave of guests had just checked out and the rooms had not been cleaned up yet. Shouldn't the general check-out time for hotels be between 12 and 14 o'clock? Besides, to put it another way, even if the previous guest is delayed, shouldn't you notify me in advance? They also said that we are all taking care of children and understand each other. The problem is that this should not be a matter for the hotel to coordinate. Why do we have to understand? Then the children we bring deserve to be running around all day waiting for your hotel to be cleaned, right?
Besides, after what happened, the front desk was quite arrogant. That's it, what do you do? We asked to change clothes and rest, but they even sent us to the gym. The front desk made no apology and thought we were being unreasonable. In the end, he felt that it was difficult for us to talk to him, so he offered to give us a room to rest and change clothes. He also said that we must come back before 9pm to ensure that the room originally given to us would be kept. I'll go and book a room with me. You didn't give it to us on time, but you have to ask the guests to take care of your time? Is this the attitude a five-star hotel should have?
Apart from this incident, the rest is passable, but nothing outstanding.

msg:I have stayed in many five-star hotels across the country and rarely post about them. This time I really want to complain! Maybe I checked in late. I booked two double rooms, but I was given the two rooms with the worst room types (because I had stayed in this hotel before, so I thought I was staying in an unconventional room type this time). I applied to the front desk for a room change and the result was I was told that there were only these crappy room types left, and there were only two rooms on each floor that I encountered (as you can see from the fire schematics hanging on the back of the door), so I can only say that I felt uncomfortable staying that night! After one of the air conditioners was turned off, the pipes inside the air outlet were still noisy. It was a very poor experience for a five-star price, not to mention the quality of sleep. In addition, the breakfast was just so-so, there will be no next time! But the quality and service level of the waiters are still worthy of recognition!

msg:First, at 8:30 in the morning, the sanitation staff knocked on the door and asked if they could clean the house. After staying up late to watch football, I thought I was staying at Home Inn;
Secondly, it is obviously allowed to decorate at 9:30, but the sound of electric saws started to appear at 9:00. I called the operator and asked the operator to tell me that we should start the decoration at 9:00. I am confident that I don’t have the service awareness of a five-star hotel;
Third, because I was angry and wanted to complain, I moved from the 9th floor to the 18th floor. When I opened the door, there were still rags on the table where the boxes were placed. The cleaning staff hurriedly came in to complain about the clothes left behind by the guests. I really don't believe that guests staying at Renaissance would wear clothes that look like rags.
In short, the service is poor, the location is poor, and the rooms are extremely aged. It is recommended not to stay there. It will disgrace the Renaissance brand and our Marriott members.

msg:When staying at this hotel, you must check the amount of the refunded deposit when you check out. There is something fishy about the hotel. I found that the amount of the refunded deposit is inconsistent. Two extra cents deducted. hehe! customer service said. It’s the hotel’s calculation error. According to her, every customer will make an error of 2 cents. If you don't look carefully, you won't notice it. Although it's only two cents, I feel that the credibility and integrity of this hotel are completely gone. The key customer service attitude is still plausible. It's funny that they want to add me on WeChat and give me two cents back. What I want is a reason, an attitude, not two cents.

msg:到酒店晚上 10 點多了，前台Carlo很熱情，房間能看到豫園附近的夜景，想看外灘的夜景可以到 21 樓的觀景台去看，距離外灘也比較近，溜溜達達 15 分鐘就能走過去，早餐、衞生、服務都不錯，交通也很便利，出門走一段就是地鐵，還有觀光巴士的站點，就是設施稍微老舊了一點，總的來説值得推薦！

2、酒店位置好 去哪裡都方便 三件套 東方明珠 迪士尼 新天地 出酒店就可以逛豫園和城隍廟
3、為了倡議環保不提供一次性牙刷 但是我們忘帶了 給前台打電話很快機器人就給送了
4、房間衞生好（洗手間沒有味道） 床品無異味很乾凈
5、洗浴用品齊全
一般：1、早餐豐富不失望不驚艷（比高端五星還是差一些）
