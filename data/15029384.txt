msg:It was a great vacation staying at the Chimelong Panda Hotel. We spent a full day until nearly sunset exploring the animal zoo, its free tickets came with the hotel package. The breakfast in the hotel was delicious with plenty of choices, and we sat next to the floor to ceiling window enjoyed watching pelicans,swans and monkeys strolling leisurely outside. The hotel provides very convenient and free shuttle services to various locations of the park and the metro station linking to Guangzhou city. 
I'll surely revisit Chimelong and the Panda Hotel again.

msg:Frankly speaking, it doesn't look like a 5-star rated hotel. The facilities are a bit run-down. The pro is close to the theme park and shuttle bus to the zoo. The room cleanliness is awful as I could spot trash (candy wraps, toy remains, etc.) left over on the floor carpet when we checked into the room. I could have stayed in a much better hotel but out of the Chimelong area then take a cab to the parks.

msg:Very convenient to take the free shuttle bus from Hanxi Changlong metro station to the hotel. Chimelong Paradise amusement park and Circus are right next to the hotel, and you can take the shuttle bus to the zoo.

Check-in was convenient and fast, even for foreigners. The hotel and theme parks were quite empty, but might be more crowded during peak season. 

The whole hotel is panda themed, so if you are not into pandas, this hotel is not for you... Great for families with kids, but also adults who enjoy funny theme hotels (like us). Everything down to details is very panda-related - we thought it was super fun. 

Details that we especially liked: the room had a foot massage machine that you can pay by QR code, it was very nice. Also room service can be ordered via QR code, not too expensive, food was good.

All in all would recommend!

There is a buffet restaurant and a food town on the first floor of the hotel. The buffet restaurant has rich food. There will be panda dolls taking photos with you. There are also many delicacies suitable for friends of all ages. The buffet restaurant is large and has many seats. However, a reminder, even if you have booked the buffet, there are no seat reservations, so it is best to line up early and wait for admission, so that you can choose the seat you like.
The food town has many different foods for you to choose from, and there are also many comfortable seats. You can see peacocks and other birds through the glass windows, giving you a comfortable environment to enjoy delicious food.
As for the hotel room, it is very neat and clean, with beautiful decoration and many panda-shaped utensils. There are two pairs of disposable slippers for children and two pairs of adults, as well as toothpaste and toothbrushes for two adults and two children. The mouthwash cups and children's toothbrushes are even more beautiful with panda patterns. The children's toothpaste comes in two different flavors that children can choose from. As for shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, they are also available for adults and children, which is really considerate.

It was just dinner time, so we had dinner in the food town. After placing an order, there was a pager. Vibration and light up meant that the food could be picked up. There were stir-fries, local specialty clay pot rice, and roast goose rice. There were many choices, the portions were large, the overall price was moderate, the taste was not bad, and the free sweet soup was also delicious. Because it was our first time using the self-service machine, the waiter Xiao Yanlan was very patient in explaining to us how to place an order to pick up the food, introduced us to the dishes, and helped us plan the tour route. She was very professional and the experience was super good. I will come again next time if I have a chance

On the second floor of the hotel, you can take a scenic bus to the north or south gate of the zoo and go to the water park. It's just across the street from the south gate. It's very convenient to travel with children. The room size is small and similar to other theme park hotels. The service is warm and thoughtful. You can see peacocks and other birds and animals in the Tang Dynasty of the hotel. There is a gourmet restaurant on the first floor. There is an amusement park in the town where children can play. The prices of snacks are relatively high. The hotel's buffet breakfast has both Chinese and Western food. You can also order takeout and pick up food from the bus station on the second floor, which is just a short walk down. It is also very convenient.

After entering the room, there was a very strange smell in the room. Because it is a family hotel, most of them will go with their babies. I really don’t understand why they continue to sell products with such a strange smell. Of course, the hotel staff changed my room in time, and the water in the shower was suddenly cold. Sure, as a family hotel like Chimelong, there is still such a problem, I really don't understand, it is really not good, the hardware problem should be paid attention to.

msg:Go to Chimelong!! Which kid doesn't want to stay in this hotel? ! 
The joyful journey of Chimelong starts with the Panda Hotel, which is full of pandas and cute and cool in every corner. It is also very close to the scenic spots. The big circus and Happy World are just a short walk away. There are many food in the food town downstairs~
The children are really obsessed with this hotel! 
I have to say! My big child of more than 400 months also likes it very much! 
The design with a castle-like appearance is very attractive from a distance~
When you walk into the lobby~it's like walking into a fairy tale world in a dream
A whole hydrogen balloon building~
There are small shops around~
Where you go, you are surrounded by details of panda elements. 
Originally, the 2-day and 1-night Chimelong Safari Park tour chose the "handsome room" of the Panda Hotel, but the front desk brother upgraded both to the "Prince Room", which was a surprise! ! 
It's really worth visiting a parent-child hotel! ! 
Strongly recommended: 
＃ Parent-child tour ＃ Good place to walk baby ＃ Chimelong Safari Park travel notes

The food town in the hotel has a variety of food choices, which are very delicious. Children can also play in the restaurant amusement park. The children have a lot of fun. The buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are also very good. It is not messy when there are a lot of people eating. The supplementary meals are quickly removed and the tables are quickly cleared. Every staff member in the restaurant is excellent. Moreover, all the staff from the hotel to the park are very friendly. They will take the initiative to say hello and answer all questions. It is worthy of being the ceiling of the parent-child park. The children have asked when they will come next time.

You can see birds such as pelicans and black swans by the window, and the children are very happy. There is a small theater in the middle of the restaurant that plays animations from time to time. A bunch of children sit there and watch while eating, and even parents squat to feed them. The scene is spectacular and funny. The hotel's service ambassador is also very considerate, and I am generally very satisfied with the stay. If you check in, there is a self-service machine during the day. If it is at night, the self-service machine is closed and there are many people, you may need to queue at the front desk. Check out is very convenient and fast.

3 days and 2 nights for two people to play 3 parks unlimited: This package is very good, no matter how many times you want to enter and exit the park, you can go. My baby went to the zoo. He was tired on the first day and had to go back, but it was a pity that he didn’t watch the 4D movie. On the second day, we took a shuttle bus directly to the zoo to watch the movie and then left. Haha, it was still very convenient. There is a tuna show in the evening buffet, and there are also performances for children to watch. Overall, the children feel very good~

They would stop and listen carefully to and answer guests' questions, and provide answers to questions and doubts. It was great. When checking in, there was a boy at the front desk. He was very nice and upgraded the room type. The room was clean and tidy with complete facilities. After checking in, the cleaning was also very timely the next day. The hotel has a special express cabinet for taking takeout, which can be ordered for takeout, which is very convenient. The hotel has a special station. You can spend 10 minutes walking across the overpass to the Big Circus and Happy World, or you can take a free bus at the station to Bird Park and Animal Kingdom. On the first day we went to the Animal Kingdom, we entered from the south gate. Basically, all the cards were big. Except for drinking water, we could not bring food. There were many restaurants in the park and the prices were acceptable. Check out the next morning, and the luggage can be stored for free. Go to Birds first and go to Happy World in the afternoon. This is a very satisfying parent-child trip, and your legs will be very tired.

The biggest advantage: The design is full of childlike fun, and my kids love it! As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, there is a big cartoon tree, and birds come out at every hour, which is very cute. The restaurant has three cute and handsome pandas coming out to interact with them for breakfast, lunch and dinner, which the kids love so much. There is also a children's show at breakfast. There is a shuttle bus to the zoo on the second floor of the hotel, which is very convenient.
At noon, the baby goes back to the hotel to take a nap, and can go out to play again in the afternoon.
In terms of price, I personally think the buffet inside is a bit expensive. I didn’t eat downstairs at night. I went to a gourmet restaurant next to it. It’s also semi-buffet. You can order with an ordering machine, and the dim sum and Cantonese noodles are all good.

If necessary, you can find a service ambassador on WeChat, who will answer and help you with various questions at any time.

After all, in the scenic area, the key is that it is so full that there is no queue for dinner. Check-in is at 4 p.m. You don’t have to wait in a long line to check in or pick up your luggage. You can’t go to the food court for self-service. The food is very expensive and tastes very bad. It costs 170 yuan to buy two bowls of bibimbap for 30 yuan outside. Panda has its own The monetary value is quite outrageous. It’s ridiculous to throw a lot of money here but not be able to buy anything corresponding to it.

msg:Hello, thank you for participating in the praise and gift event. You only need to give a full 5-point praise on Ctrip’s order when you are free, and send us a screenshot (text + picture), and a free panda will be mailed to you. Hotel themed gifts, thank you!

You can comment from the following aspects:
Hotel service: Most of the services are very good, especially the concierge. In fact, they are the busiest, but they are very patient. In particular, the concierge Liang Xinyi helped us repair the toys (I bought the toys from Happy World and found out there was a problem when we arrived at the hotel. It was already past ten o'clock) so that our family of three could spend the night peacefully (I understand everything)
Hotel facilities: The facilities are quite complete and all are available. It is very convenient. It is recommended that the clinic add iodophor swabs.
Hotel hygiene: There is nothing to say about hygiene. Children’s hotels do a good job in this aspect.
Hotel catering: We also ate in the food town and the buffet breakfast. They were all very good. It depends on your needs. I feel that the cost difference is not that big. If there are more than six or seven people, the food town is definitely more suitable.
Hotel location: The location is very good. We did not take a shuttle bus. It took a taxi very quickly and we got to the South Gate in five minutes! A quarter of an hour further away from the north gate. I also took a taxi to Bird Paradise, which took about twenty minutes. It’s really close to the Happy World on foot! ! It's next to the circus.
It is very convenient to scan the QR code for self-service and activate directly, saving a lot of trouble and no need to wait in line to check in! The Chimelong shuttle bus is very good. It goes directly to the Penguin Hotel and has a reserved seat. It is fast and cheap. It takes about an hour and a half. We arrived at 3:25 pm. Very satisfied! ! !

msg:I brought my children to Guangzhou during the Chinese New Year and stayed at the Chimelong Panda Hotel. It is a family hotel that children like very much. When you enter the hotel lobby, it has a vintage feel and a**osphere. There are panda elements everywhere. And the hotel's service ambassador is also very good, warm and thoughtful. The hotel is very convenient wherever you go in the park, and there is a free shuttle bus. It was a lot of fun coming here this time, and the children were reluctant to leave.

The staff have a good working attitude and a clear division of labor. The two children are very satisfied with the bottled water in the hotel.
The hotel's hygienic condition is very satisfactory. The breakfast is rich in variety. The restaurant is large and reasonably divided. There are so many varieties that I don't have time to taste them.
It is very convenient to take a taxi at the entrance of the hotel. The staff at the entrance are warm and considerate. There are also circus performers performing in the lobby at noon, and the children stop and interact at close range! Foreign friends are also great for children!

Fun 5.0

Service/price ratio 5.0

A great experience. The hotel service is in place and timely. The buffet is rich in variety and clean. It is very convenient to stay with children. There are also animals such as white peacocks and macaws that children like in the lobby. If there are any problems, the corresponding waiters will solve them in time. Moreover, the hotel In the park, it is very convenient to go to see the Circus and the World of Fun. There are free non-stop buses to the Safari Park and Bird Paradise every day. It’s just that it’s too hot in Guangzhou, so you can only wear short-sleeved shirts, so there’s no need to bring extra clothes.

msg:The service is pretty good, and there are extra baby mineral water, milk, and orange juice. Tips for surrounding tours. The hotel is in the park, so it is more convenient to go to each park. There are special buses to pick up and drop off, and you can also take taxis in the park. The transportation is very convenient. 📌If you are driving by yourself, you can actually stay outside the park. Hotel facilities at the same price are better, and the five-star hotels outside the park are not far away📍|Guangzhou Chimelong International Circus^ is right next to the hotel, a ten-minute walk away Arrived📍|Guangzhou Chimelong Paradise^ is also very close, you can walk directly to it📍|Guangzhou Chimelong Water Park^ takes about 5 minutes by car, and the hotel also has a car to pick you up📍|Guangzhou Chimelong Wildlife World^ It is very convenient to drive, you can +300 yuan to drive to the car dealership area and then walk to the park.

As soon as you enter the lobby, you will be very happy when you see the tall child in the middle. There are many people checking in but they are organized. First of all, the lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic, thoughtful and quick to check in. Even after you check out, your luggage can continue to be stored. The experience is great.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I went to Chimelong with my children and the elderly. We booked a total of three rooms, two cool big beds, and one family room. The feel of the hotel facilities is as follows:
1. The bed in the double room is very large, two meters tall, and there are spare quilts in the cabinet.
2. The room we booked at that time was given desserts from the food court for each person. The dessert list was sugar water exchanged for stew in Guangzhou.
3. The buffet restaurant is quite large and has a full range of dishes.
4. The food in the food court is indeed more expensive than outside, but the quality is better than I expected. I originally thought that the food in the food court in the scenic spot was inedible, but in fact there are still many highlights.
5. Chimelong has two hotels, one is Panda Hotel and the other is Chimelong Hotel. If you want to visit Chimelong Paradise and watch the Circus Panda Paradise, it is the closest. If you just go to the safari park, you have to take a shuttle bus from both hotels, no need to consider the distance.
6. Hotel tenants still have many advantages. If you stay in a hotel, consider purchasing a package (including hospitalization tickets, circus, etc.).
7. Each park has VIP fast lanes, and hotel guests can enjoy a 12% discount on purchases. If it is your first time to Chimelong and you have children with you, it is still recommended to take the express channel. Whether it is the cable car, small train, or roller coaster in the wildlife park, the queues are more specific, especially the panda sightseeing car in the wildlife park.

Overall, I was satisfied with my stay. I considered staying for one night when visiting Chimelong. There weren’t many other options. After all, you can go to the park and watch the circus just across the street. You can save a lot of energy and physical strength. It will feel better to play this way.

msg:A very good hotel, whether it looks from the outside or inside, the panda theme is implemented throughout without being out of shape. The toiletries sets for washing your face and brushing your teeth are all panda-themed, which shows that the hotel is very attentive👍
As soon as we entered the lobby, we were stunned. It was very large and full of people. It felt like we had entered a tourist attraction. However, the order was maintained very well and the staff were very enthusiastic. Check-in and check-out were smooth.
By the way, opposite is Happy Valley and the Circus, and the shuttle bus to the Safari Park is at the back door of the hotel.

You can go directly to the Paradise on foot. There is a huge food town on the first floor of the hotel. , all kinds of delicious food are provided until 10 o'clock in the evening, which is just the right time to replenish your energy after a long day of playing.

msg:This is my first time to stay at the Panda Hotel in Chimelong. The hotel is fully implemented, reasonably designed, and very user-friendly. The environmental sanitation is particularly good. I can see hotel staff cleaning the corridors at any time. It's a very childlike themed hotel that both adults and children can't resist. There are many activities in the hotel, and children especially like to participate. When I checked in, I added a service ambassador on WeChat, and my requests were answered instantly. The service staff's warm smiles are heart-warming, and the buffet restaurant has rich categories and nutritious combinations. The hotel has a bus to the park, which is very convenient. Overall, I felt that the food, accommodation and transportation experience of this trip was great.

Although the hotel buffet is not cheap, it has a rich variety, and there are waiters wearing panda clothes to take photos with guests. The hotel also has a food court with cheaper prices. There are also peacocks, golden pheasants, and some unnamed birds next to the restaurant, which the children like very much. Although the room is not big, the general facilities are very complete. Overall, I am very satisfied.

The children's disposable slippers were very cute and they were taken home. You can store your luggage on the day of check-in and check-out, which is very convenient. On the day we left, we stayed in another hotel. Two-year-old Erbao also said he wanted to stay at the Panda Hotel. Next time I wait until there is less traffic to bring the kids here, the experience will definitely be better.

They checked in in advance, entered the information, and then went to the park. Everything was in order, and I took photos with Mengmeng, Cool, and Shuaishuai. We had a lot of fun before even going to the scenic spot, and there are quite a few animals in the hotel. It is convenient to go to any scenic spot. The children had a great time watching the circus. The hotel supplies are very detailed and there are two copies for the children. In addition, it is very convenient if you drive. There are enough parking spaces in the basement. I forgot to leave the baby's milk in the refrigerator when I left. The hotel called me in time. , I kept it and picked it up when I came back from the zoo. Thank you so much. Good review!

msg:I just stayed at Panda Hotel and Chimelong Hotel, two rooms for two nights, and visited all three amusement parks. Overall, I feel that Chimelong only cares about money and is impersonal. 1. Hotel: 1. The room price is nearly 4,000, with no breakfast, no tickets, and no priority when entering the scenic spot. 2. There are only a few peacocks and swans in the Panda Hotel, which are not distinctive and have no real quality. 3. The hotel collects money for various items and uses them as gimmicks. Guests staying at the hotel are given discounts when buying things in the store, but only once, to induce more consumption. 4. The shuttle bus to Birdland is too late to drive. It leaves just after the park opens and it takes twenty minutes to get there. We had to take a taxi. The shuttle bus back was also very crowded and we had to stand the whole time. 2. Zoos and Bird Gardens: 1. The staff at the entrance to the scenic area have a bad attitude and push and push tourists with their bodies. My uncle is a disabled soldier who was disabled in the war. He doesn't have any priority. When he goes to the park with his cart, he is made every possible difficulty. 2. The ticket price is too expensive, especially for children between 1 meter and 1.2 meters. Generally, zoos are free, but Chimelong charges 245, which is very unfriendly. 3. There are only a few animals in cable cars and trains, but they are not outstanding. Compared with Nanjing Hongshan Zoo, Shanghai Wildlife Park, and Beijing Zoo, the price/performance ratio is poor. Overall not recommended! ! !

I have stayed in many family hotels. Only the Panda Hotel has the most comfortable check-in process. It is very convenient to have dedicated staff to guide you through the process.

The prince room has a small bed for children, and the children sleep very comfortably. The balcony is locked for safety, and if you need to open it, you have to call the staff.
The food in the buffet restaurant is very complete, the noodle shop and desserts are all very delicious, and the staff at the door are super patient.
The hotel has a bus directly to the safari park, which is very convenient ~
All in all, a very good experience!

The tickets included in the room provide unlimited access to three parks for three people for two days and one night. It is very convenient and can enter and exit the park multiple times. The hotel is very close to the Circus and Happy Park, just a few minutes' walk away. There is also a shuttle bus to the Safari Park, so there is basically no need to wait. All aspects of the hotel are designed very reasonably, and every situation that can be imagined and encountered is taken into consideration. The lady can solve all kinds of problems with just a phone call. The service attitude of the boys and girls in the lobby is very good, especially the service ambassador girl who is very nice and enthusiastic. Stayed in the Prince Family Room, the room was very warm and cute. After a day of walking, there is a foot massage machine. Although it is charged, it relieves the fatigue of the day. The breakfast is very rich. It is recommended that friends who come to stay set aside an hour for breakfast. Because the restaurant is very big. After walking around, I found that there are many things I want to eat and they are quite unique. I originally stayed for more than half an hour for breakfast, and finally ate It took about 45 minutes. The weather in Guangzhou has been very good these days, with moderate temperatures. All in all, it was a very pleasant trip.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first:
Service: The staff are very polite and friendly, check-in is very fast, and you just need to hand over the room card when checking out.
Public area: There are three elevator halls in total, divided into Mengmeng Hall, Cool Hall and Shuaishuai Hall. Each elevator hall has 8 elevators. Except for the large amount of people and the need to queue up when returning from the circus, the other There is no need to wait for the elevator, there will be one at any time, and you need to swipe your card to ride. The lobby is colorful and full of childlike interest. There are regular programs and actors will interact with the children. On the left hand side of the lobby, there is the elevator of the same garage and check-in. On the right hand side, the concierge is followed by luggage storage, express delivery, and purchasing tickets for each park. and check out. There are many waiting sofas, and there are large interactive screens on the left and right. There are also peacocks and pheasants to watch. There is a small parrot garden on the right side of the door.
Room: The room has three themes, cute, handsome, and cool. We chose the Mengmeng room, a pink room, which my child liked. It has a small balcony where you can dry clothes and towels, but you have to call 0 to have the room staff unlock the door. There are complete toiletries, as well as body lotion and clothes hangers specially for children. Two small souvenirs with panda heads are also given out every day. The designs are different. If you want to collect all, you can ask the staff to help find them.
Meals: The quality of Panda Buffet is acceptable, and there is a small stage with shows during meals. You can put your children there to watch the show, allowing parents to relax and have a good meal. If you want to order a la carte, you can also go to the food town, but during the peak period, you have to queue up. It opens relatively late in the morning, so if you are in a hurry to go out, it is recommended to go to the buffet. But Panda Hotel doesn’t have a Chinese restaurant like Chimelong Hotel. I prefer Qilin Chinese Restaurant in Chimelong. Every dish is of good quality. I’ve tried almost all of them. The Typhoon Shelter flavor is my favorite. There is also an eggplant, which is crunchy and my kid likes it very much. The barbecued pork and pan-fried pork are great. If you pay attention to the quality of your meal, you can go there.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings:
Service: Personally, I think the staff have very good attitudes, but when I encounter a few people who are not so good at Mandarin, they really need to guess or explain their words. I suggest you train more in Mandarin. After all, you have to face tourists from all over the country, and there are many foreigners. tourists.
Accommodation: The room is much smaller than that of Chimelong Hotel. It feels like it is decorated with cartoon wallpaper and painted. There are no other small surprises like those in Disney hotel rooms. The balcony is very narrow.
Dining: In addition to the buffet, there are too few fine dishes to eat a la carte, and there are only a few varieties of in-room dining. Or you can only order takeout, which can be picked up from the takeout machine on the right side of the hotel. In addition, although the programs in the buffet allow parents to relax and eat well, they also make the children focus on the program. If they do not eat well, when taking their children to go there, be sure to ask about the program time and let the children finish eating in advance before watching the program.

The room is not big but it is warm and clean. There is nothing to say about Chimelong's overall service package. The staff are enthusiastic and can respond to any questions at any time. Safety issues are also taken into consideration. The facilities are good and the experience is good. Although there is a shuttle bus to and from the hotel, it is still lagging behind Zhuhai. There are more people and fewer vehicles, and it is very crowded every day. The advantage is convenience, so you can't ask for too much. Overall, the Chimelong trip is pretty good. It’s worth taking the kids for a second visit.

The people queuing up to check in were larger than the people queuing up to check in. While queuing up, I encountered hotel staff who asked about the order method one by one. I heard that my order was from Ctrip, and they took me to a special channel to handle it. It’s fast, and it comes with two drinks and a gift. It’s so nice! Big thumbs up for Ctrip! I also want to give a big thumbs up to Panda Hotel. As a partner, I really took the trouble to ask questions one by one when facing the queues. It is really reliable!
Although there are many people, the hotel handles it quickly. I think when you go out to play, don’t have the aura of God, cooperate with each other and understand each other, don’t be too picky, and having a pleasant experience is better than anything else, right?
Remember to download the Chimelong app to check the queue time at any time. There are really few people on the small train after 2 o'clock!

There are special buses on the second floor for free pick-up and drop-off to Bird Paradise and Wildlife World, which is very convenient. If you stay for two days and one night, you can go to the Safari Park during the day and the Happy World at night, because only the Happy World closes at 9 o'clock, and the other two parks close at 6 o'clock, but if you want to watch the circus, that's a different matter.

Then there was always someone to guide everyone. Everyone would take the initiative to serve with a smile. Because it was 12 o'clock in the afternoon, the children wanted to sleep. I found Lu Yingli, the service ambassador of Panda Hotel, she was very positive. Helped coordinate and allowed us to check in early, which was great. They actively addressed the guests' needs and the lighting design of the room. The overall feeling was that the breakfast had many varieties and was delicious. Overall, the experience was very good!

If you want to go to the Wildlife Park and Bird Paradise, you can take the shuttle bus directly on the second floor of the hotel. There are many buses and it is very convenient. Secondly, Let’s talk about the breakfast buffet. The variety is quite rich and the taste is okay. It is available from 10 o’clock in the morning to 10 o’clock in the morning. It is very good. Finally, let’s talk about the service. All the services in the hotel are good. We can add extra bedspreads for the children in about ten minutes.

msg:I was torn between Chimelong and Panda for a long time. Chimelong has White Tiger Restaurant and Panda Hotel has many parent-child elements. In the end, I chose Panda. I had no choice but to put the baby first.
The hotel lobby is very grand, with cuckoos chiming on the hour, and small trains running to watch. Panda triplets perform and take photos every day. My kid also likes the video games in the lobby.
The restaurant has a buffet and a la carte, both of which taste good, but the buffet is a little more expensive.
I originally booked a double room, but the hotel upgraded me to a family room for free. The family room has a small bed, which is pretty good. I like it. The room is also very cozy, the bedding is comfortable, and there are toilets, toothbrushes, and shoes for children, which is very child-friendly. There is also a foot massager.
The location of the hotel is right next to the wild animals. It only takes 5 minutes to take the hotel shuttle bus. It is very convenient. I highly recommend staying here for two days.

msg:Not satisfied with the lack of service awareness from the door to the front desk. The service timeliness of the hotel is very poor. You basically have to wait for someone to answer the call at the front desk. The toilet smelled like smoke. 1589 for one night + four-park pass, buy with caution. Except for the water park, which you can walk to, you have to take a car to go there. The bird park is simply dumb. It takes more than 20 minutes to go to the village to feed the birds.

The ubiquitous panda elements are so surprising. Even the sidewalk at the door is full of cat paws. So cute. As soon as the children entered the hotel, they went crazy and said "Wow!" and took various photos holding the panda statue. The triplets are so cute. The lady at the front desk enthusiastically upgraded the adorable room. The cute pink room is perfect for little girls. The hotel has a shuttle bus, which is very convenient to Chimelong Wildlife Park and Bird Paradise. There is a circus at the door. I love it. Before leaving, I took photos with Kuku and Shuaishuai. The children said: They still want to come.

The location of the hotel is very convenient for travel. You can reach the Circus in a few minutes' walk. The south gate of Happy World is right next to the Circus. The other two parks can also be picked up by the hotel's shuttle bus. Children save a lot of energy for visiting the park. The overall service of the hotel is also very good. I still remember the service ambassador Lu Yingli receiving us. The decoration of the hotel is also very pleasing to children. The entire Panda Hotel is full of panda elements.

msg:The parent-child hotel in Chimelong Resort, themed on the triplets of pandas (Meng Meng, Ku Ku and Shuai Shuai), is great value for money and excellent in all aspects. You will never regret it if you choose it with your eyes closed!

Transportation: The hotel is very close to the Big Circus and Happy World, and it only takes 8-10 minutes to walk there via the corridor. Therefore, you can finish playing later at night, and it is not too late or too tiring to walk back. If you go to the Animal World, Water World and Bird Park, you can also take the hotel's free bus to get there, which takes about 10-15 minutes and 40 minutes respectively, which is convenient for travel!

Dining: There is a restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, which can be ordered a la carte or self-service. It is clean and hygienic, and the taste is authentic. You can also order takeout and it can be delivered. Just fill in the comprehensive building (**self-collection cabinet). Friends who want to save money can choose this method.

Facilities: The layout is simple and atmospheric. The room has a balcony, an independent children's bed, cartoon decorations that children like, small cups, etc.; there is a small lid for children on the toilet, and it is also equipped with a small stool. The facilities are complete and the details are in place.

Service: The staff are polite, warm and lovely. This 3-day 2-night stay was perfect and impressive, which shows that Panda Hotel not only has good hardware, but also excellent soft power services. I would like to thank Miss Lu Yingli (Service Ambassador) for her thoughtful service. She not only sent me travel guides and answered questions before the trip, but also responded to my questions in time after check-in, helping me optimize my itinerary and improve the quality of my trip. 

In general, Panda Hotel has convenient transportation, complete facilities, clear themes, and thoughtful service, which is very suitable for parent-child family travel!

msg:After comparing for a long time before traveling, I finally chose the Panda Hotel with the theme of "cute, handsome and cool" triplets. The colorful decorations make you feel like you are in a fairy tale world, and children are full of novelties wherever they go.
On the second floor of the hotel, you can take the park shuttle bus to the Wildlife Park, Bird World and Zhuhai Chimelong, or you can take a 5-15 minute stroll to the Circus, Happy World or Water Park. There are many choices in the food town on the first floor, and self-service ordering is very convenient.
The room is equipped with a full set of daily necessities and is clean and hygienic. The keychain on the bedside table is a small check-in gift that can be taken away.
When we checked in, we were told that we had been upgraded to a room, and we were also given water park tickets, buffet coupons, children's self-service free coupons, etc. The hotel service ambassador answered all questions and cleaned the room promptly and conscientiously. The overall experience was really nice. The 3 days of multiple visits to the three parks in the package are really necessary. We left the opportunity to the safari park and were lucky enough to see pandas eating up close.

There is a shuttle bus at the main entrance of the hotel, and it only takes less than 10 minutes by car. Get off at the South Gate of the Safari Park, which is opposite the water park.
Experience: The supporting facilities are complete. The hotel has everything, including convenience stores and gym buffets. The convenience store is equipped with safes, refrigerators, etc. The service is very attentive and considerate, the bed is very soft and comfortable, the bath water is also very comfortable, the room also has foot massage equipment and disposable foot covers. The room has a balcony for drying clothes, and there are enough hangers for drying clothes. The food is a little expensive, so it is recommended to bring some food before entering the park.

The hotel environment is very good and the children were very happy.
There are children's slippers, children's toiletry sets, children's toilet seats, small stools, etc. in the room.
The hotel's check-in is quite user-friendly. You can check in quickly and then store your luggage. The room number will be sent to your mobile phone later, so that it won't hinder you from going out to play first.
The overall experience is very good, I will try the restaurant again next time

msg:Very satisfied, the lobby is very big and there are cute panda triplets everywhere. The receptionist was very enthusiastic to help us carry our luggage and guide us to check in. The front desk also upgraded us to a cute room. The girl in the pink room liked it very much. There are super cute panda supplies everywhere in the room. I love them. The entire hotel has complete facilities and the rooms are very clean. The Panda Buffet Restaurant on the first floor has a rich variety, and the food town next to it also has a lot of delicious food. Chimelong provides free shuttle buses and free luggage storage services, eliminating the trouble of dragging luggage when traveling. It’s just that our trip is a bit short. Next time we take the children for a complete tour of Chimelong, we will still choose to stay at our Panda Hotel.

There are many things for children to play in the hotel, and it's also very clean and hygienic. The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good and they will answer any questions in detail.

msg:I was hesitant to choose a hotel during this trip to Guangzhou Chimelong, but finally chose the Panda Hotel. After all, it was my child’s favorite. As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt how big it was. As soon as I entered, there were staff members who helped me with my luggage. The service was very good. I would like to thank Lu Yingli for her enthusiastic service and careful answers to my questions about the park and the hotel. It’s also very convenient to visit Chimelong, with free bus transportation! The children especially like the room. The toiletries inside are printed with very cute panda patterns, and the buffet has a wide variety of food. The Panda Hotel will still be my first choice next time I have the opportunity.

msg:I have never written a bad review since using Ctrip. I am really speechless. When I entered the hotel, the room smelled like a damp, moldy smell. I didn’t even mention the facilities. It was understandable. It was agreed that Ctrip members would check out at 2 o’clock. 1 At one o'clock, the cleaning staff started urging me to do this so that I wouldn't have to write a bad review. In the morning, my child's gums were swollen and sore, so he wanted to go to the restaurant and order some salt. The restaurant employee actually said that he was not allowed to take it out. I really thought it was a little bit funny. It's just salt. I've already said that children's gums need salt water to rinse their mouths, not to eat. It's really speechless to say this. I am also a hotel industry practitioner and understand that bad reviews are not easy for hotels. So I never leave a bad review when I stay in a hotel. Maybe a small thing must be because of the accumulation of customer experience. As a mother who is anxious when her child is sick, everyone should be able to understand that the last straw that broke the camel's back made me explode. It was just such a little bit of salt. How ironic.

The high-speed rail station is very close to the hotel, and check-in is also very convenient. After checking in, you can receive park tickets to explore first. The entire hotel is full of panda elements, which children especially like. Even the shampoo and shower gel has panda patterns. The service is also great, thank you Lu Yingli for your thoughtful service. The hotel is also very close to the park, and there is a shuttle bus to and from the park, which is very convenient! The buffet variety is also very rich and fresh, worth a try!

The cute room was upgraded for free, and birthday decorations were also made! My daughter loved it 😍The room also came with family water park tickets, and she played for an hour and a half before leaving. It’s a stress-relieving holy place that both adults and children love to visit, and they’ll come back again! The only downside is that there are no regular staff at Kaka Club during the day, so it would be a bit of a pity not to book a good night story!

All kinds of supplies are made with children in mind. The toothbrushes, shampoos and shower gels are all for children. There is a free shuttle bus to the Circus, Bird Paradise and Happy World on the second floor of the hotel. The lobby on the first floor of the hotel has a luggage office, automatic check-in machine and express check-out. By the way, there is also a large screen that automatically takes pictures, which can be sent to your mobile phone by scanning the QR code. You can directly see peacocks and white peacocks, pheasants and unnamed birds in the lobby. There is a gift shop. If you buy tickets for shopping, there is a long way. The Long app also allows you to earn points, which can be redeemed when eating at the buffet. One side of the lobby is a food town, where you can order your favorite delicacies a la carte, and the other side is a buffet with rich and fresh varieties. There is also a small theater inside, where you can take photos with Meng Shuaiku. If you check in, you will be given small gifts. You can reach the Chimelong Circus in just 5 minutes' walk, which is very convenient!

There are also complete supplies for children in the room, including toothbrushes, shower gel, etc. However, there are no slippers for bathing in the room, which is very inconvenient, especially when taking a bath with children, you need to be careful. Animal World is recommended in the three parks, but the instructions for animal performance interactions are relatively simple. I hope it can be introduced more clearly in chronological order. The Happy World has strict height requirements, and our children are still too young to play in many items.

It is a great family hotel. There are panda elements everywhere, which are very popular with children. We drove more than 1,000 kilometers from Shaanxi to Guangzhou. The hotel has an underground parking lot for free parking for hotel guests. Although there are a lot of guests, it only takes a few minutes to check in, and the staff is well-trained and polite. The booked package stays in Shuaishuai Room with three park tickets for three people and two-day breakfast buffet. It is very cost-effective, and the breakfast is very rich.

There are also clown performances and teasing at the door, allowing children to immerse themselves in the joyful world of play. The service is also very good, especially thanks to Lu Yingli for her thoughtful service. Entering the room, a series of panda cartoon types are also full of parent-child style. The mattress and quilt are very comfortable, and the milk offered by the room staff is so considerate! Our family enjoyed family fun at the Panda Hotel!

msg:From the moment we checked in, it was dirty and messy.
After changing rooms, I still felt that everything was dirty, especially the stalls, which made me feel disgusting.
I have endured everything, but the most unacceptable thing is that I am not allowed to take out food. The delivery boy called me and asked me to take a taxi to take out my own food. Isn't this funny? Having stayed in so many hotels, this Panda is really weird and the layout is too small. To protect their own hotel catering. No takeaway guys are allowed in. Later, I called the front desk to complain. It turned out that the front desk said there was a takeaway counter, but the takeaway guy couldn't find it because it was so far away. It's so hidden. Finally, I didn’t want the takeout I ordered because I was very angry.
That's it anyway. It cost 2,300. At that expensive price, the stay was not as good as a hotel. In fact, Panda's various facilities are just like an express hotel, so it is strongly not recommended.
The next day, we spent 1,500 and stayed in an elegant hotel. The experience, service, and facilities are truly heaven and earth.
I hope friends who are not here will not step into the trap. Even if you live in Panda, you still have to take a bus to the park, and there are a lot of people queuing up.
It's really better to spend more than 1,000 to stay in a five-star hotel near Canton Tower and take a taxi to the zoo. It’s also more comfortable and cheaper than living in a panda.
This Panda is the worst hotel I have stayed in. none of them

There’s nothing good about it and there are too many people. But we still went there once to satisfy our children’s curiosity. Then we took a taxi to eat local specialties nearby. Among them, the Big Pigeon Rice Restaurant was worth checking in even though we had to wait in line for two hours.

msg:The most speechless hotel in Guangzhou trip. I arranged a 4-day trip in Chimelong. I wanted to stay at both Chimelong Hotel and Panda Hotel. I stayed at Chimelong Hotel on the first day. The design of the hotel is very good, like being in a forest. The hotel balcony You can see animals, so I arranged to stay for two days at the Panda Hotel because of its high reviews online. However, when I checked in, I encountered an impatient receptionist. The hotel didn’t even have a swimming pool. They even explained to me that our parent-child hotel does not have a swimming pool for safety reasons, and the Chimelong Hotel does not. From your family? Zhuhai Chimelong Hotel is not yours? They don't have a swimming pool? If there is no, there will be no. Why am I using you to quibble with me like this? The room was very small, about the same size as Home Inn. The floor was stained, and the bathroom was also very small. I didn't expect the bathtub. I couldn't get out of the bathroom when I opened the door. The worst part was that my girl couldn't see the mirror when she stepped on the stool. Is this a family hotel? The balcony was closed and was not allowed to be opened. Later, I signed a safety liability exemption agreement before it was opened to me. The balcony area was almost non-existent. I stayed at the Chimelong Hotel on the first day, and then stayed at the Panda. I felt that this hotel was built solely for cutting leeks. Anyway, it is not possible. Worry about selling. This price and quality are the worst in my trip to Guangzhou. For 8 days, I stayed at Rosewood, White Swan, Chimelong Hotel, Panda Hotel, and Atour. The worst hotel ruined the good mood I had brought from Chimelong Hotel.

There is no 15-second video! Let people spend more money to buy more photos! Bad review! ! More than 7,500 for two nights! not worth it! This price doesn’t even include breakfast! The garbage is dead. I won’t come again next time! !

You can take the corridor to get there, basically within 10 minutes, or you can take the free bus on the first floor of the hotel. The hotel is a triplet panda-themed hotel. Children especially like it. The rooms are clean and tidy, and the service staff are very friendly! Hotel meals can be enjoyed at the Panda Restaurant on the first floor. On the day of arrival, I had a seafood buffet meal with many varieties and a good dining environment. This trip is a family trip, the experience is very good, next time I come to Chimelong, I will choose Panda Hotel!

msg:The first time I gave a negative review to a hotel, I didn't expect it to be Chimelong. Because of the good impressions from our visit before the epidemic, we took our two children to Chimelong again during the Chinese New Year, but this time the experience was even worse. Apart from the objective factor of the large number of people during the Chinese New Year, from a subjective point of view, the hotel's irresponsibility and indifference are outrageous.
     On top of that, there are major problems with dietary hygiene. After staying in the hotel for two nights, on the third morning while going to the circus after breakfast, the two children vomited one after another. The infirmary showed them two packs of Mommy's Love and a umbilical patch (charged 14 yuan). Since the circus ends at 12:20, we asked the hotel to coordinate a one-hour delay in check-out before going there (ignoring that platinum card members can delay the check-out for 2 hours), so we checked out to watch the circus. At the circus, the waiter saw the child vomiting. No one cared about me. After finally walking back to the hotel, there was no room and no one cared about it. I asked the lobby attendant to find a small cup of warm water to soak in probiotics. The answer I got was to ask me to take my dehydrated child to the restaurant to find it myself. It was very " "Considerate" told me that there are no cups in the restaurant.
      We left the hotel and went to Shunde, our next stop. We vomited five times along the way. We could have started a food tour. However, during the Chinese New Year, our two children had their blood drawn and given antiemetic injections at a hospital in Shunde. The doctor diagnosed acute gastroenteritis and asked What did they eat? The two children only had breakfast at the Panda Hotel restaurant that day. They started vomiting an hour later. During this period, they did not eat any food not provided by the hotel. Is the hotel really not responsible?
       When I thought about how we would go to Zhuhai Chimelong after leaving Shunde, I felt extremely regretful. We should not have brought our children here because of their longing. The whole Chimelong city gave me the feeling of indifference and irresponsibility.

msg:Supporting facilities: The overall facilities are very suitable for children. Generally speaking, children are happy. Actually now the hotel is equipped with 2 big and 2 small, keeping pace with the times. Small slippers, small toothbrushes, small cups and small pillows are all very cute, and milk, orange juice, absorbent water and two key chains are also sent. It's right for children to be satisfied.

Environment: You can directly see the peacock in the lobby of the hotel. Children like it very much. There is also a Brook Hall which is also very pleasant.

Hygiene: Hygiene is generally good.

It’s just that I was unlucky. The room I stayed in on the first day was probably due to renovations next to it or some other reason. The toilet smelled badly, but the first day was too tired to bother. Respond immediately after giving feedback to the hotel to arrange a room change for us. But the next day we were out all day so we returned to the hotel in the afternoon for a replacement. Here I want to praise the hotel's service, which is more considerate. There seems to be a problem with the water temperature in the bath at night. When the children were bathed, the water was relatively cold for a long time. I was a little worried that I would get sick after washing. At first, I wondered whether the water consumption was high at nine o'clock, but I responded and dealt with it in a timely manner after reporting to the hotel.

Service: Ctrip customers can check in quickly when checking in, which is very good. The service ambassador, Lu Yingli, is very enthusiastic. In addition to sending me a strategy, she also helped me urge me to check out the room. When I left, I dropped items in the room and she responded to me in a timely manner and promised to help post them. Very caring. Feel the convenience of Ctrip.

Guest rights: It is very good that the guests who stay in the room are given a welcome drink. Desserts are delicious. There are sugarcane juice, mung bean paste and white fungus soup to choose from.

Food Town: I had a meal at the Food Town at noon on the day of check-in, and the overall taste was okay. The price is relatively expensive, but it is more convenient.

Itinerary: Because the children are small and our energy is limited, we have arranged for the Bird Paradise and the Zoo in two days (additional ticket purchase). If the energy is limited, the hotel package with three parks is also a good choice.

I arrived at the hotel on the first day, because I could only check in after three o'clock. We didn't notify until five o'clock. Because at noon on the first day, we arranged to go to Bird Paradise after having lunch in the gourmet town. That way you can make the most of your time. When you come back, you can go directly to the room. The next day is a full day trip to the zoo.

Shuttle bus: It takes half an hour to go to Bird Paradise, and it takes 15 minutes to go to the zoo. It is very convenient to line up for a bus on the second floor of the hotel.

Buffet: The buffet breakfast should be praised, it is very rich. There are plenty of options even for us gluten sensitive babies. It is more reasonable to schedule a meal time of one hour. After eating, children can also watch cartoons in a small theater, which is stable.

The overall experience is good. But to be honest, more than 2,000 yuan per night in summer is still a bit expensive, and the usual price of less than 1,000 yuan is more appropriate. It would be even better to be able to travel at staggered peak times.

Enter the lobby full of parent-child a**osphere! Compared with Chimelong Hotel, which is quite satisfactory, Panda Hotel is really very suitable for bringing children to stay! When queuing up for check-in, the service ambassador came over and informed that the room type can be upgraded for free: Prince Family Room‼ ️So happy~
When checking in, the ambassador also informed the hotel of the location of the elevator, the buffet time, and the aisle to use when visiting. 💯The family also gave a small cake for their birthday that month🍰
The children in the Prince’s family room have a separate small bed, children’s products + bathrobes + slippers + small stools (you can use it if you can’t reach the pool) ~ adults have prepared a foot massage machine, and you can relax at night when you’re tired from playing during the day (35 minutes 45💰)
The cafeteria is very big~ The location and food content of each dining area is written on the dining paper, and children under 1.4 will be given a dinner buffet coupon every day‼ ️
After dinner, you can take a photo with the dolls by strolling in the lobby! The night view of Panda Hotel is really beautiful💯
Ambassador Lu also added WeChat~ If you have any questions, you can communicate on WeChat! It's really convenient~perfect experience💯💯💯

msg:Terrible experience! Arrived around 12 o'clock and got the room only after 5 pm, which completely disrupted the travel plan. The so-called prince's family room should be renamed beggar's family room. It's not a big deal. After taking a shower, the bathroom floor was covered with dirt. I don’t know how the water and washbasin are designed. All the water for washing your face is on the countertop, the toiletry bag is all wet, and the faucet keeps dripping! Disposable shower gel shampoo is also very poor. I was so tired from playing that I didn’t want to go out to eat, but the result was weird. You can’t order takeout in this hotel!

This time, except for the Bird Paradise, I played all the other theme parks. Every day, I took 20,000 steps. Although I was a little tired, I was very happy~ I will try to play all of them again next time~

msg:1 point is given because the bed is relatively clean and the hot water is OK.
This hotel is too shabby. The room is not ventilated and the windows cannot be opened. Chimelong Zoo is fun, but there is absolutely no need to stay in this hotel. I calculated that for a 2,500 yuan package, the zoo ticket only accounts for 1,300 and the co-ownership hotel accounts for 1,200, but the hotel facilities are no different from those of a small hotel priced at 200 yuan. Big break! ! ! Moreover, the food is not delicious, and express delivery is not allowed, so I can only drive out to eat and buy things, which is so inconvenient!
My suggestion is: stay in a 700-800 five-star hotel outside the park, and just drive into the park to play. Everyone will be happy!
Because the hotel facilities are really too shabby, usually it’s a group, usually a child, it’s too noisy, too small, too shabby

The three mascots will often come out to interact with the children. Our children like the fat panda very much.

There are African performances in the hotel lobby, and there are peacocks and other birds. Classes can be seen, and it is a worthwhile trip for children. After all, it is closely related to the theme of the three-born panda in the zoo, so you must bring breakfast!

There may be many attractions and attractions, and there is no wave pool in the hotel.

There is a buffer period of a few days, which is suitable for my hesitant personality. 🤔 After booking, you will receive the hotel's reservation code and order code, which is very convenient. The Panda Hotel is a classic. I was worried about hardware problems before I went there, but I completely dispelled this idea after I arrived. Both software and hardware are very powerful. There is no problem with the hotel facilities at all, and the quality is good. It should be regularly maintained and updated. The service is even better. There are multiple admission counters, so there is no need to worry about long queues if there are many people.

The breakfast at Panda Hotel has a lot of variety, and there is also a similar micro-video area. The hotel reception staff and the staff at the door work hard and reply in a timely manner.

The baby strongly requests to experience the cute and handsome room again next time. The hotel is very convenient to go to various parks. There are exclusive shuttle buses to the zoo and bird park in the far distance. The corridor on the second floor of the nearby Happy World is directly accessible, and the big circus is also very close. The hotel has a complete range of food and beverages, and my baby likes it very much. There is a puppet show in the hotel lobby. If you are lucky, you can see the parade of floats and interact with various NPCs. The hotel service is also very convenient and friendly, especially Ms. Lu Yingli, who also explained the park and the hotel and told us about it. Provide us with convenience and hope that the hotel will get better and better.

The hotel is very nice. It fits the theme of the panda triplets. There are panda elements everywhere. The children like it very much. When they see the toiletries, they start to break up the puzzles.
The location of the hotel is also very good. It is very convenient to walk to the Circus and Happy World, and there is also a shuttle bus to the Animal World, which runs every ten minutes.
The quality of the hotel service staff is also very good, especially the service ambassador Lu Yingli, who will patiently answer questions for us and explain some routes to the park. It was a great stay experience!

One place I like very much is that there are separate windows for check-in, room card collection, ticket purchase, check-out, and luggage storage. They all go with children, which saves a lot of time and prevents the same customer from repeating the same window. Consult the delayed guests. The staff I met were very patient and served with a smile 🤩A parent-child hotel, mainly for children, with a strong theme of cleanliness☺️

Everywhere is cute and the environment is cartoony. The key point is that there are many staff, so even if it is full, everyone is very orderly. There are two staff members waiting for the elevator, which I really didn't expect. The staff is also very enthusiastic and patient, and Miss Lu Yingli's reception. I also upgraded the high-rise room for free. The children's toilet in the room is really very considerate. I was thinking about how my son would defecate outside when he used a small toilet at home. The Panda Hotel has a small stool for the sink, and the toilet is also for children. The lighting is also very good. I forgot to bring my luggage up, and the medicine I bought was delivered by the concierge. I came very early, so I stored my luggage and went first. I came back tired and forgot to pick up my luggage. The child had a fever, and the hotel also had a special medical room, which was great. There are also children's slippers and nightgowns. You can see the peacock in the lobby, just opened its tail, which is very beautiful. The child is very excited and very surprised. I will come again when the child is older, and I will choose the Panda Hotel again!

Accommodation + package ticket, add 200 to upgrade the room and get two breakfasts
Even the toilet here is so cute 💥 (I couldn’t resist taking a picture of the women’s toilet😝)
Even the peacock 🦚 is extra face-saving and keeps opening its screen 😂
There are many more delicate and extreme services
Such as: luggage storage, baby carriage rental, pick-up service
There are Shuaishuai, Kuku and Mengmeng to accompany the children to interact and play

You can sleep until you wake up naturally in the morning; the hotel buffet breakfast area is large and rich, go there after 8 o'clock on Sunday morning There are still a lot of seats left. There are panda triplets interacting in the restaurant. My sister likes the dining environment there very much and has a good time. The transportation of the hotel is relatively convenient. There are shuttle buses to various parks. It is said that the waiting interval is not long. To save time, I chose Didi Chuxing to and from each park. The overall feeling of being in this time is worth the money. The cool soft decoration of the cool room may be more suitable for little boys. The younger sister wants to live in the cute room the most, so next time you bring your sister to experience it again!

On the day of the child's birthday, the room was specially arranged, and a group photo with Meng Kushuai and a small surprise gift were presented. You can see many small animals in the cafeteria, and the food is rich in variety and tastes good. The hotel has a shuttle bus directly to each park, which is convenient and fast. Postcards and small pendants are presented in the room. It is a recommended family hotel.

The advantage of a parent-child hotel is that it is very friendly to children. Children’s toilet seats, small stools in the washbasin, Chimelong’s own cartoons on the TV, and various shops that take pictures and sell things~ the makeup mirror on the washbasin is broken, remember to check the room these details.
There is a discount for booking dinner buffet at the hotel (children’s buffet is delivered by the hotel), so adults don’t need to buy online in advance✔

The hotel is very suitable for children, and it is very close to the attractions. The Circus and Happy World are just a short walk away. The zoo and Bird Paradise a little further away have free shuttle buses, which is very convenient. The food town downstairs has a lot of food. If you don’t eat the buffet, there are many choices here, gathering flavors from all over the world. The hotel offers a free drink "Good morning orange" 😊 and milk, and it is a hearty breakfast with bread. Cotton candy is made by machine DIY, and children want to try it. Send a copy of the children's paintings on the return flight, thank you for the happy memories brought by Panda Hotel.

msg:The Panda Hotel, which came here admiringly, has to be said that in a themed hotel, it is basically at the ceiling level. The design and style of the hotel are especially suitable for children, with rich colors and perfect details, all of which are panda-themed, and children like it as soon as they enter. There is a small bench in the bathroom, slippers and bathrobes are small, and there are children's toiletries, which are very suitable for children.
There are shuttle buses to and from the park and scenic spots, but it is very close to several parks, and walking is not tiring. According to the route recommended by netizens, I took the small train cable car, fed the animals and watched the parade, played various sports, and went to see the well-deserved circus. I was really happy.
The food section is also good. The buffet breakfast is comparable to a full meal. It takes half a day to read all the varieties. The richness cannot be described in words. You can basically eat it by leaning on the wall. The food town also has local characteristics. Buffet order The taste of the meal is not inferior to that of a big hotel.
It is particularly worth mentioning that the package ticket we bought was a pity that the child's father could not come, and the hotel also helped convert it into a consumption fee, and directly bought dolls and supplies. When I was playing in Happy World, I lost my newly purchased umbrella. The staff helped me to take pictures and adjust the monitoring. The umbrella was quickly found. I am very grateful.
The small ground train and aerial cable car in the safari park, as well as the interactive performances of actors, the parade of floats, and the three-dimensional viewing experience are really top-notch. The Baby Paradise of Happy World should be the pinnacle of indoor playgrounds in China. Unfortunately, because the children are relatively young, some items cannot be participated in. During the admission period, due to the weather, some items were not open. It is a little regretful to save it for the next time!
Summary: An unforgettable dream trip in childhood, five-star recommendation for everyone to bring their children to play!

msg:I checked in at around 1:30 in the afternoon. The front desk said that the room would not be available until 3:30, but I made a reservation a few days in advance, and I did not expect to have a room until 3:30. There is also a check-out time at 12 noon the next day. Besides playing, eating, and just sleeping for a few hours. The front desk asked me to add 200 yuan to upgrade the room and include two breakfasts. I went with two teenagers, they had package tickets, and I bought a ticket to enter the zoo on the same day. Because there is no room, I can only go to the zoo immediately, because the zoo closes at 6 o'clock. It seems to be very rushed, and I played for more than three hours. I didn't really check in until almost nine o'clock in the evening. Once I entered the red floor, it was very dark, and I jumped down, and I didn't feel very comfortable. In the inspection room, it is either dark red or black, especially the red on the glass in the bathing place, which is a bit strange. Fortunately, I have two children with me. The next morning, the child went to the buffet and came back with a dazed face. It is conceivable that the taste index is very high. And I went to the food street alone to eat a set meal. To be honest, the sushi was made of fruit salad sauce. I asked the kitchen to give me the tomato sauce for the chips. There was no sushi soy sauce. The waiter asked me to use Lee Kum Kee soy sauce instead. I waited for more than 20 minutes for this meal, and saw that the kitchen was not wearing disposable gloves, so I grabbed it with my hands. It looks like I have no appetite, and I haven't eaten much! When picking up luggage, a few employees didn’t care about the people who jumped in line. Alas :-( I didn’t expect the Chimelong service three years after the epidemic. I was a little disappointed. I have been there four times in total, and it seems that I will not go again after five years!

msg:The heartfelt journey has begun! The children have been looking forward to it for a long time, get up early, start from Zhongshan in the early morning, drive for more than 50 minutes, and arrive at the Panda Hotel at 8 o'clock! The handsome guy at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped us check in in time. Because it was too early, the room number hadn't come out yet, so he told us to store our luggage first, and then let's play! There are so many fun things in the whole park, just go to the Happy World first according to the wishes of the babies! It can be reached by free service bus. Wow, as soon as you enter the door, you will see wild roller coasters, big hammer swings, and torrent warriors... so exciting! The whole scene was full of screams! What a world of joy! There are too many projects, so you have to come and experience them yourself. Before you know it, it’s late at night, and you can’t play in this park...
      When it got dark, I hurried back to the hotel. The room numbers had been arranged. When I opened the door to check in, the children exclaimed:! Ya so beautiful! So many panda patterns, so pretty! I really like the silly and cute panda pattern, and I will buy two panda dolls as a commemoration! The bedding in the room is very good, like sleeping in the clouds, and seeing the sweet smiles of the children is the greatest gratification of being a mother.
      The next day I got up early and went to have a buffet breakfast. There were many types, which the children liked and were happy. Because I have to go back to Shenzhen, considering that there will be a super traffic jam at the end of the festival, I can only say goodbye to the hotel reluctantly. Goodbye, lovely Panda Hotel. I will come again next time. Goodbye, goodbye

  We checked in on the 26th, because it was the baby's birthday that day, and I was a member of Chimelong, and I was upgraded to a cool room for free, and I was given a birthday gift 🎁, a badge, a photo frame, and a cake for the red panda 🍰. Decorate the room and give fruit for free.
  The room and the hotel lobby are very kawaii. Panda Sanbao will take pictures with the guests in the hotel lobby every morning and 3 pm. You can also watch peacocks in the lounge area of the wine point, and there are face-changing games on big screens everywhere. The cafeteria has a variety of varieties, and children can watch the Panda Theater while having breakfast.
   The staff of the hotel are very patient, the service attitude is also very humane, and the arrangements for children are very thoughtful.
   I recommend friends to stay at the Panda Hotel when they come to Chimelong, your baby will definitely not want to leave.

There is a special car to pick you up to the park. The circus is opposite the hotel, which is convenient.

Environment: Suitable for bringing children, the room is not very big, each room has a balcony, the floor is too high, for safety reasons, the balcony door cannot be opened, only a crack can be opened for ventilation. The bathroom is a bit crowded due to the direction of the door opening!

Facilities: Children's facilities are complete. Each room is equipped with a children's stool, which is convenient for children to wash up. The toiletries include children's special shampoo and shower gel, and children's body oil!
The restaurant is very large, and there are many types of breakfast, which are distributed in different areas, so it will not be crowded when picking up meals!

The decoration of the hall is also very childlike, and there will be small tours and panda dolls interacting with children.
The room should also have three themes of "cool, cool and cute". The baby girl's stay is a cute theme, and the room is pink and tender.
The bedding is clean and the space is tidy. The air conditioner is powerful. After playing tired, you can have a good rest.
When booking a hotel, a breakfast buffet is included, and there are so many categories, it is simply too difficult to choose in the words of the old man.
There is a special one, because the natural ecology is good, you can hear the birdsong when you wake up in the morning, which is very special for concrete workers.

msg:There is nothing to say about the hotel, it is suitable for parent-child travel, and the children like it very much. The good reviews are only for the hotel itself.

I bought a 2-day, 1-night package ticket, and I was pissed off by Chimelong Paradise. The student activities in Guangzhou for two consecutive days made the whole Paradise crazy, chasing and fighting, making noise, Each item has to queue for more than 12 hours. As a result, we played 4 projects in two days, and it was still a fast track to buy... In fact, there are very few tourists themselves, and the interests of our tourists have been seriously trampled on. Everyone came from all corners of the country, and I didn't expect this to be the result. You can allow the school to arrange student activities, but you can't let several schools come at the same time. Do you pretend that other tourists don't exist? Do you not care about the feelings of tourists? Lots of tourists and lots of students are two different concepts. If tourists don’t know each other, they won’t be so noisy. Students are in small groups, wishing to bring a loudspeaker to make noise, and some students even jump in line at will. There is really no sense of experience in Happy World, and I will definitely not go there again in the future, and I will not be recommended by others.
The safari was ok. Bird Paradise is in dilapidation, and there is nothing to see. The shuttle bus in the whole park is free, but it still needs to go around, which is very troublesome. The whole scenic spot has not fully recovered from the epidemic, and many facilities have not been released.

As a result, the children’s favorite is the panda cartoon-themed hotel. The design is cute and the environment is warm. Toothbrushes and toiletries are well thought out. Adults The children are all equipped, and the hotel's overall service is very good. I borrowed an ironing machine to solve the baby's wet pants, double bed circumference, provided disinfection feeding bottle and tableware service, and helped find the little rabbit that was lost in the room, especially the reception of the service ambassador. Help Upgrade the room. The cafeteria can eat while watching small animals. The children are very excited. Breakfast is until 11:30, and the Chimelong Wildlife World departs at 12:00. There is a free shuttle bus to and from it. Time is free, super happy, and parents are satisfied! Great experience! I will choose again when I go to Chimelong.

There are a lot of small snacks purchased from outside, not made by myself. There are not many desserts, and the taste is average. The wildlife park is still worth visiting.

You can take the circular shuttle bus directly to the south gate of the zoo. It is within walking distance to watch the big circus at night and to the Happy World the next day. Secondly, the hotel service is considerate. It seems that you are bringing a male baby, and you can upgrade to the cool room for free. Wechat is also added. If you have any questions, you can contact the service ambassador. Finally, the room is notable. Although it is not super luxurious, it is enough for a family trip. The twin room is comfortable, the bathroom is large, and the breakfast is also very rich. There are many choices, which suits the taste of the whole family! Recommended to friends who go to Chimelong!

I feel that Panda is good in all aspects, just in time for a suitable check-in package, a handsome double room, two-day unlimited three-park pass, and a panda breakfast buffet for two. Simply fantastic value. The Panda Hotel is super good both in terms of hardware and software facilities. Like it, the service is great. The staff greet you with smiles on their faces. They are in good order, just like coming home. The room is great, and the breakfast at the Panda Hotel is also very good👍We had enough to finish the meal, because there are animals to accompany you for breakfast. The climate in Chimelong is also very comfortable this season, and the children like it very much. They said that the summer vacation will come again, and they have not had enough fun. Whether you come to Chimelong by plane or high-speed rail, it is very convenient. Friends, you must stay at Chimelong Panda Hotel! It's a little regrettable that the probability of catching a claw machine at the entrance of the second floor is too low. The child wanted to catch a panda cub, but he was a little disappointed not to catch it dozens of times. I hope the hotel adjusts the probability to satisfy the children.

msg:I am so happy to have chosen Chimelong Panda Hotel🏨 and spent two wonderful days and one night here.
First of all, the staff here are very enthusiastic ❤. Recently, Chimelong ushered in the peak of travel. The two days I stayed coincided with the weekend. Every morning, the lobby was almost full of people, waiting for check-in, waiting for luggage storage, and waiting for photos Yes, everyone has different needs and questions. I saw that the staff either explained in detail or directly led or called to help the guests. It was really warm. Of course, every time I asked for their help, they would solve it for me in time. The hotel's hardware shows its level, and only the software can truly retain guests and build a good reputation. In this regard, the staff of Panda Hotel really do a good job.
The hotel has complete supporting facilities, and you can take free shuttle buses to various parks and subway stations; there is a restaurant town on the first floor, where you can find a lot of Cantonese special snacks with your room card 🈶 free drinks; in the Panda Cafeteria There are a variety of meals, which are more suitable for children to eat. During the period, there are cute and handsome people who come to take pictures, and the children are very happy. There are a lot of co-branded products with Chimelong in Brooke's authorized store, so it's good to buy one as a souvenir. There are elevator rooms on both sides of the hotel. Choose the elevator close to your room to get up and down. In order to protect the safety of the guests, you need to swipe the room card to get up and down. The panda element in the room is not only liked by children, but also by adults. It is so cute. There are special children’s toiletries and drags. Children also like to play on the balcony. On the second day of my visit, I encountered a cartoon parade in the lobby at 11 o'clock in the morning. I heard from the tourists next to me that it was only available on Sundays. They specially reserved a room on Sundays to watch the parade. Haha, didn't you earn it?
A little suggestion: the check-in speed can be faster. I arrived at 9 am on Saturday and opened three windows. There were more than ten people lined up outside, and it took an average of seven or eight minutes to check in for a family; the slippers were slightly low, so it was ok Print Chimelong's logo on the slippers, and the children's dragging can also change in color. In short, the flaws do not conceal the virtues.
Next time I have a chance, I will come to Panda Hotel again, and I look forward to seeing you all!

msg:The children at home have long wanted to come to Guangzhou Chimelong to play, so they came to the Panda Hotel before the end of the winter vacation. It took more than 3 hours to fly from Beijing to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. After landing, I drove to Chimelong, Panyu, and arrived at the Panda Hotel not long after entering the car. From a distance, there are only a few panda patterns, which are very easy to find. We parked the car underground and followed our footprints to check in at the lobby on the first floor. The staff on duty, Ms. Xie, was very good at serving. When she learned that we were girls, she helped us upgrade the cute room. The hotel lobby is very tall, bright, cute, and cartoony, and even the elevator hall is also very cute. The room also has everything that one expects to find, and it is also cartoon and warm. The most important thing is that there is a circus performance opposite the hotel. After we checked in, we bought the first-class circus tickets for the night at the ticket center. The location is very right, and the viewing effect is very good. The children like it very much, and they will choose this hotel again if they have the opportunity.

Service: I would like to praise the staff on duty again, Ms. Xie, for her thoughtful and enthusiastic service!

She kindly reminded us that we can store our luggage and go out to play. We will be notified by text message when the room is ready. We care about whether we live comfortably and whether we are satisfied with the room. The service staff is very polite and will say hello no matter where we are.
Room facilities:
I have stayed in many hotels with my baby. Overall, Chimelong is very good. The air conditioner in the room is very quiet when it is running. The faucet produces a lot of water. It is very comfortable to take a shower. There are also special toiletries for children. The balcony window in the room is fine. Open it, but it can only be opened very narrowly for the safety of children, and it is equipped with a screen window, which is very good.
Catering Services:
Because I bought a package ticket with breakfast, I can only comment on the breakfast part. There are many types of breakfast. My son likes pork feet noodles, and I like Cantonese-style morning tea. There is a stage in the restaurant, which will broadcast panda cartoons. Accompanied by birds, very comfortable breakfast time

The three major theme parks are suitable for family outings. It is very suitable for a family to come for leisure and entertainment. The sanitation and ventilation of the room are also pretty good. The service is also good, thoughtful and warm, and there is also a service ambassador lady reception. The performance of the big circus is very exciting. There are a lot of lights and music to cooperate. No matter what age group can be well accepted. It is a good choice to come to Guangzhou. The cable car in the safari park is very suitable, and you can watch animals without being tired. Recommended

msg:Choice Phobia - Hotels 🏨
       At the beginning, I lingered in the Panda Hotel and Chimelong Hotel for a long time, and then I came across a suitable package and chose it🐼At first, I "complained" about the service and so on. Later, I compared the prices and recognized it. Let's share~
       We recently discussed whether this hotel should be booked or not, because almost all 6 stores in the park are closed and open from 9 to 10 in the evening. If you live at 200 Beijing Road ➕ one night, it costs about 100 yuan to take a taxi back and forth! Now that we live here, we will also take a taxi back to Beijing Road to go shopping, eat and drink at night, and the taxi fare is also an additional cost. But the final conclusion is: I will regret not choosing this place, and there is nothing wrong with choosing this place. I don’t need to live here next time when I have a stronger purpose.
       I booked 2498 yuan, three days and two nights, including only one child lunch or dinner coupon, accompanied by an adult (adults need to purchase 258 yuan or 298 yuan separately), three days unlimited trips to Bird Paradise, Happy World and Wild The zoo, free shuttle bus to various parks and airports. It's worth it! After all, tickets for unlimited entry and exit for three people for three days will cost 1,500 to 2,000 yuan, and you can also get a 20% discount when staying in a hotel for the exclusive enjoyment. In fact, it is not much, so give some comfort! ~
        But it’s inconvenient to eat here. Apart from the cafeteria, the hotel is a gourmet town. The food is really expensive. Claypot rice with egg and beef is 78 yuan, which tastes good, and beef brisket noodles, which is 62 yuan, is not delicious. , but the beef noodle soup is delicious, and people who stay can get a dessert for free. The orange peel mung bean paste we chose is really delicious, but the taste of orange peel is still somewhat weird. It would be perfect without orange peel! In addition, at different times, there will be panda dolls to accompany the children to "do activities", which are very popular among children. In addition, there are many children's facilities in the corner of the restaurant, which are probably suitable for children under 4.5 years old!
        It is recommended to buy dry food such as drinks and bread in advance, because the takeaway here can only be delivered to the gate of Chimelong Resort, and you have to pick it up yourself, which is very inconvenient! You can also stroll out to eat, but if you really spend a day in the scenic spot, you will be too lazy to move! ~💤💤💤💤💤
        The hardware facilities here are all good, very clean and tidy, the room is full of cartoon toiletries, etc., the staff will put new ones in the next day, so even if they are not used up, you can put them away and wait for the staff to put new ones in. Hahahahaha! The little psychology of taking advantage~~🤓In addition, you can book various activities for your children in advance~ We didn't make an appoin**ent for any of them, because we don't have enough time to play in the scenic spots every day, so we don't want to waste time here~
        If there is another time, I will definitely choose to stay at our first hotel on Beijing Road: Nanbei Zongheng International Apar**ent (Jinrun Platinum Branch), I booked it one month in advance, 200➕ Loft, serviced apar**ent, beauty and manicure in the building Yes, shampoo and massage, bath and sweat steaming, supermarkets and shopping malls, the key is to walk to Beijing Road in 3 minutes! The downside is that this season is still a bit cold. After all, it can’t compare with the Panda Hotel. There is no air-conditioning, and there is a small heater. However, the temperature in the next two days was 20➕ and we all wore half-sleeved sleeves, so we didn’t feel cold anymore! Xiao Kai likes Loft very much, floor-to-ceiling windows, running upstairs and downstairs is not enough for her to toss~ The big space really wins!
        In short, each hotel has its own advantages and disadvantages, and you can still judge the one that suits you best~ The two pros and cons of my stay here can also be used as a reference! 😎

The hotel environment is very suitable for children. They are all panda elements. We must praise the soft head of children's toothbrushes. Rich breakfast. The environment is hygienic, the room is clean, hygienic and comfortable, the children like it very much

msg:The appearance of the hotel is very beautiful, like a castle 🏰, very attractive to children. You can see several white peacocks and golden pheasants in the lobby. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety and has many seats. The food court also has a wide variety of food options. The panda shop is the favorite place for children, where you can buy all kinds of souvenirs, just like those in the zoo. In particular, the bath water in the room is very good, the water temperature and speed are just right, and the hair dryer works well. Recommended to stay.

msg:It's winter vacation, and I haven't traveled for a long time. This time I brought my baby to Guangzhou to play. I booked the Chimelong Panda Hotel for two days. I placed two orders. The first day included tickets to several nearby parks, and the second day was a pure hotel room, and it was not the same one. The room type, I was worried that I had to change the room in the middle, but when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk helped to arrange the two nights in the same room directly, so as to avoid tossing between us. It is very considerate, grasps and solves the customer's pain points, so you can rest assured It's fun👍🏻
The exterior and interior of the hotel are very beautiful. You can see many small details designed for children. Children also like it very much, from children's clothes hangers to embroidered towels, neatly placed mouthwash cups and water cups, pictures and pictures on the roof. The pictures in the elevator room are very cute and very healing to look at. The staff are also very enthusiastic. Although there are many people at the buffet and it is a bit noisy, it can be seen that the waiters are constantly busy. Chimelong is too hot, and there is no way. Except that the hair dryer is a bit stretchy, which doesn't match the price and style of this hotel, everything else is very satisfactory.
In addition, the hotel is very close to the scenic spot. It only takes a few hundred meters to get to Happy World and the circus. After playing at night, you don’t have to worry about taking a taxi with your children. You can walk back to the hotel and lie down in a few minutes, hahaha. The most practical point for me.

The parrots here are really beautiful! At about 11:00 noon, there was a performance in the atrium of the lobby. The three panda brothers and sisters and the Huhu family all came out to dance. Although it wasn't amazing, it was also very hard work for the joy the staff brought to everyone. After the show, you can line up and take photos with them. The service is also good, especially thanks to the service ambassador Lu Yingli for the reception. Very happy outing.

The packaging of the hotel's toiletries is also very interesting, spelling out childlike pictures. The room will also have a toilet seat suitable for children. The key is that after washing clothes, there are hangers that can be hung on the balcony. The environment and sanitation are very good. There are panda dolls in the lobby where you can take pictures as souvenirs. It is very suitable for bringing children to live. The two children like it very much. I will definitely recommend the Panda Hotel next time when I come to Chimelong or when my relatives and friends come to Chimelong! It is worth staying!

msg:The exterior design of the hotel is cute. Whether it is the lobby, rooms, restaurants or food in the hotel, it is closely related to the Panda Hotel. The baby is excited and happy inside. The service is also very good, thanks to the service ambassador Lu Yingli for the reception. Chimelong Panda Hotel has 1,500 themed rooms. The rooms are divided into 4 major themes, namely cool theme, cute theme, handsome theme and prince theme. Each room in the hotel is equipped with children's bathrobes, slippers, towels and animals Cartoon washing supplies, etc., and even children's exclusive clothes hangers are all available.

msg:This is the first time I came to Guangzhou Chimelong. This time I stayed at the Chimelong Panda Hotel. It is very close to Paradise, Circus City, and Wildlife Park. Lu Yingli, the service ambassador of Panda Hotel, received us and provided warm hospitality during the stay. Service, hotel equipment is relatively new, the function is intact, there are many varieties of buffet, there are quite a lot of choices, salmon, steak, lamb chops are also available, and there are also special rice rolls and sand river noodles! The only problem for me who goes to bed early at 9 o'clock is that the sound insulation effect is average. If you go to bed late, you probably won't be able to feel it! I have stayed in many parent-child hotels, and the Chimelong series gives people the feeling of being a mother with a baby. They are extremely caring and considerate. Sometimes they pay attention to the details and safety that you didn’t expect. I will also recommend Panda Hotel to my friends!

The hotel service ambassador, Lu Yingli, thoughtfully upgraded us to a parent-child room with a small bed, and also gave us a delicious sweet soup. If you encounter line problems during the game, you will give me the best advice in time. It was a satisfying and enjoyable journey! If you come to Chimelong in the future, you will definitely stay at the Panda Hotel!

I came back from Zhuhai to watch the big circus, and then I booked the Panda Hotel when it opened. The hotel has a relatively large lobby. It is very beautiful and the room is clean, especially the bed feels very comfortable to sleep on. I want to sleep when lying on it. The experience is very good. If I go to Chimelong next time, I will choose to live in Panda Children. I really like it
The hotel staff is very enthusiastic and the service is very thoughtful,

The first few times I went to the Wildlife World, this time I came to the water park in summer. This time, I found that the service of Panda Hotel is still very meticulous.
There are many projects that can be played in the water park, and there is a cobra project that I have played four or five times. The lazy river project is also loved by children! Play from 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm, and there is also a water electronic music festival at 8:00 pm.
After returning from the water park, I went straight to the cafeteria. The dishes are rich and I like it very much. Children can also eat while watching the performance.
Children will never get tired of staying in hotels, and they should come again when they find time.
By the way, the hotel can do nucleic acid from 15:00 pm to 8:30 pm. My hotel service ambassador is Xiong Yingli, the service is great!

It is a very pleasant journey and I look forward to coming again. I’m impressed to share with you a few points. As soon as we entered the lobby, we were warmly received by Lu Yingli, the service ambassador of Panda Hotel, so that we didn’t feel unfamiliar and cramped when we first arrived, and it was very warm. On the 2nd day of check-in, I also responded to my needs, I felt like an exclusive housekeeper, thank you very much. 2 The hotel lobby is beautiful and a**ospheric, and the rooms are all cartoon elements, especially panda elements, which children like very much. 3 The wildlife park has many animals, pleasant environment, scenery everywhere, as if you are in the wild, the park is large, and all kinds of services are complete. 4 National Day, lively but not crowded, the must-go small train, cable car and 4D cinema all only waited about 3 minutes for their turn. 5 The shuttle bus is very convenient. Generally, there are seats to sit on. There are also cars on the roadside to solicit customers. I don’t think it is necessary to take the bus by myself. There is a nucleic acid test point in the parking lot 2 from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., which is very convenient. The food in the food town on the first floor of the 7th hotel is good for the price. I eat in the food town in the morning, noon and evening. I ordered a lot of things, but no one stepped on the pit. The elderly and children recommend their porridge and steamed eggs. 8 Shop too many cute things, tighten your wallet.

msg:The park is close to the circus world. There is no cake for breakfast, only buns, some special animal buns, and there is a performance at 8:30 in the buffet restaurant. Remember to print the buffet voucher at the entrance of the restaurant by yourself. The room package is very strange. It either includes 2 adult breakfasts, and you need to make up for the children's breakfast, or you can give the children a buffet breakfast, which needs to be brought in by paying adults. Takeaways can only be delivered to pick up outside the 1.5km park, and cannot be delivered to the door of the hotel. The food looks a bit ugly. In general, 5-star price, 3-star service, the waiter can not trouble himself, he will let the customer handle it by himself, or push it to others. The security service is seriously under-managed, and serves customers with a high profile standing on the customer's head. Managers are usually used to handling customer complaints and compensation, and managers during the day and night do not hand over problems, requiring customers to repeat things many times. The manager has various room numbers on the compensation book, and it is conceivable how many customers have complained about problems. Ctrip's evaluation is still very useful. After the evaluation of the first day's stay, the hotel manager has called and apologized. As consumers, what we spend money on is happiness and enjoyment. It is hoped that the hotel can attach importance to management and internal education and training. It does not mean that each security guard has a different personality. They serve customers as much as possible. When they go to work, they must be in place. If possible, ask a third party to experience the hotel service hardware and software, and find problems, identify them, and correct them. Otherwise, the hotel manager will be tired to deal with repeated complaints.

The decoration is cute, but not of any grade, and the waiter's attitude is good. The food town on the first floor has a good taste. It is open from 8:00 to 22:30. Three people can get it for more than 200 yuan. Ctrip members will receive free sugar water and cotton candy in the food town. The hotel is very close to the nucleic acid point within 5 minutes.

The next day I went to the animal world. The animal world is very big, but in fact, it will not let people walk too much. The whole tour route is designed to be very comfortable, with key points and the best tour route. After entering the park from the south gate, take a cable car tour. Get off at Swan Lake and transfer to a small train for a tour, and finally stroll back from Swan Lake all the way to the South Gate. You can visit the entire zoo perfectly, and there is very little walking. Go again next time you have the chance.

msg:The child likes animals, so I told him to take him to see animals. Coming this week! The package purchased on Ctrip is very cost-effective for entering and leaving the park multiple times. We chose the Panda Hotel. The Panda Hotel is very in line with the aesthetics of children. You can see peacocks in the lobby. When I checked in this time, I met Lu Yingli, the service ambassador, who basically responded to every request. Also sent two drinks, late check out. Basically butler service and it was fantastic! Thank you~ The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to take. We took the children to the zoo, which is very suitable for bringing children here. There are many animals, and the red pandas are very cute [happy].

I would like to thank Miss Lu Yingli, the service ambassador, for being very considerate. Parrots, peacocks, and other animals can be seen outside the lobby on the first floor. It's a dreamy and cute fairytale-themed hotel. Children like it very much. The parent-child hotel is well-deserved. There are many small details that can take care of the baby. For example, the baby on the small bench can climb up to wash it by himself. Such as diapers, such as a small toilet seat. The details are very poke people will recommend to friends and look forward to coming again next time.

The service is very good when you enter the lobby. You will ask if you need help along the way. You can also see white peacocks in the lobby and even the elevator upstairs. It's very innocent and really hits the hearts of children. There are also many dining options. There are gourmet towns, panda cafeterias, panda cafeterias and small theaters. Adults can eat with peace of mind. Even buns are served for breakfast. Very cute child to linger! The next time I will choose the Panda Hotel, it is also very close to the big circus and is the first choice in all aspects

There are many warm little details in the hotel, commemorative keychains and postcards can be taken away, and postcards can also be sent to the concierge to ask for stamps to send to friends.

The theme is of course pandas, and there is a channel on TV that is full of panda animations. My daughter especially likes it. don't want to go. Ha ha. The hotel is very close to the zoo, amu*****t park, bird park and big circus. But it's better to drive. Walking is still a bit tiring. Especially in hot weather. It's hard to walk. The buffet is also good, and also sent a child. Come back when the kids are older. The children are small, and there are many equipment in the amu*****t park that cannot be used. Staff service is also good. Especially service ambassador Lu Yingli. Patient service.

It is a fun and comfortable family trip. Special thanks to Lu Yingli, the service ambassador. She is traveling alone with her baby.

msg:The Panda Hotel has been in my heart for a long time, and I have always wanted to bring children. This time I finally made it. As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I was very excited, full of childishness, and there were many small animals. It's very fast and the experience is very good. The room is small but very clean and warm. There are also children's toiletries and small slippers, which are quite considerate. The big circus is opposite the hotel, which is a very good accommodation experience.

The ambience is good. The hotel is very close to the Grand Circus and Happy World, within walking distance. There are also free bus rides in other parks. The service is also very good, especially Lu Yingli, the service ambassador, thanked her for her careful reception and explanation. The room is also cosy and lovely. The child is reluctant to come out as soon as he enters the room, hahaha. There will be a chance to come again.

Talking about the hotel as a whole is very detailed, in terms of food and beverages, there is a cafeteria on the first floor. I usually hear that lunch is not open, usually only on Saturdays. There is also a gourmet town, where you can order food, there are also slides for children to play. There are also small animals in the lobby glass. I just saw the white peacock opening. The room is also very cute. My daughter likes it very much. It is very suitable for family travel.

msg:After three years, I came to Chimelong again, a familiar and cheerful place. Staying at the Panda Hotel this time, the a**osphere is very suitable for children, the independent cot design allows children and adults to relax better! Chimelong's three parks can meet the needs of different groups of people, of course, the zoo is the most not to be missed. The ecologically excellent Chimelong Zoo allows you to spend a day watching slowly. Whether it is a walking animal area or a wild animal area that requires a car, it is very, very worth watching. Finally, it is very good to take a cable car to browse the whole park from a high altitude. Spectacular and worthwhile.
  This time, I also went to Flying Bird World. I have never been there before, and the experience is still very good. All kinds of precious birds, snakes, turtles, lizards, etc., as well as a large crocodile island, let children know more and more closely. The performance of Hundred Birds Flying Song is still very good. It allowed me to see the performance of so many precious birds, which is very worth watching. Choose to come to Chimelong for a happy holiday! Special thanks to Panda Hotel Ambassador Lu Yingli!

The peacock opens its screen and attracts children for a long time! The service ambassador took the initiative to ask about the needs, reminded the weather changes, and especially helped to contact the battery car to solve my 2 personal problems. Every staff member of the hotel made me feel at home. There is also a free bus from the hotel to the park. Children like the small train in the zoo very much. After several rides, they can see many animals up close. The aerial cable car can also go around the zoo, which is very convenient. Chimelong Panda Hotel experience is worth the money! Like Chimelong, like Guangzhou!

msg:I don't remember how many times I've been to Chimelong Wild. I never get tired of it every time I go. Adults usually only deal with higher animals. When they have the opportunity to get close to these non-higher animals, they will temporarily put down their hypocrisy and pretense, and feel calm and peaceful. detachment. Therefore, Chimelong Wild is not only suitable for children, but also suitable for every adult living in the concrete forest.
The price of the Panda Hotel is 5 stars, the facilities are 3 stars, and most importantly, it is 5 stars for children's fun. This is not felt in other 5-star hotels that are magnificent but slightly pretentious for adults, so it is worth the money. The bath utensils are divided into adults and children, the quality is very good, 6 stars.
Special thanks to Miss Lu Yingli, the service ambassador with a beautiful voice and sweet voice, for her thoughtful weather reminder and tireless answering questions. Next time I come to Nagano, I will choose bear wine!

msg:The children at home said that they always wanted to come to Chimelong, and then we stayed at the Panda Hotel, which was really fun! The children were very happy when they entered the hotel. In the lobby, you can also watch animals up close, and there are also puppets performing in the Tang Dynasty. The children are very happy to see it, and the hotel's service is very good and very patient, especially the hotel's service ambassador, Lu Yingli! The hotel is also very convenient for everyone to go to, and there are free buses. It's also very close to the big circus, just opposite the hotel. The big circus is very exciting. It's worth seeing! The whole family had a great time on this trip, and will come again if there is a chance.

msg:There are animals to watch in the lobby of the hotel. I was lucky to see the peacocks open their screens! If you like animals, you can go to the wild animal world, which is very big. You can drive by yourself or take a cable car or a small train to play. It is not hard to bring children! If you go to Happy World, your height should not exceed 1.4 meters. Children will play less. If you have time, you can take children to go shopping. In the evening, you can go to see the Chimelong Circus, which is very exciting and spectacular, and children like it very much! These attractions are very close to the Panda Hotel. The hotel's check-in service attitude is very good. I would like to thank the service ambassador Wu Yaxuan for his enthusiasm and assistance, and Miss Liang Ruting at the front desk. You can also take a taxi at the entrance of the hotel, and the shuttle bus is more convenient to go outside. It is a very good experience in all aspects👍

Ctrip has a special channel for ticket booking, which is convenient and fast. The service ambassador helped us upgrade the prince family room for free at the front desk. It was a pleasant surprise to be able to live in the prince family room at the price of the handsome room. The baby was very happy and had a very good impression of the Panda Hotel. The hotel is very close to the North Gate of Happy World. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk. It is very convenient to return to the room at noon to rest and fight in the afternoon. There are many convenient facilities in the hotel, the buffet is also delicious, and there is a place to build blocks for free, so that the baby can have fun and interesting without leaving the hotel. The white peacock entering the door is a major feature and worth seeing. Needless to say, if you come to Chimelong in the future, you will definitely choose Panda Hotel.

Fortunately, we saw the exclusive channel of Ctrip.

The room service is also in place, and a phone call is immediately resolved, especially the room attendant named Xiao Bin is gentle and considerate and very patient.

The hotel's customer service provides fast service. It won't take a long time to come, but it will appear in 2 minutes. It's really great!

msg:Chimelong can be said to be the ceiling of a domestic parent-child theme hotel. I have been to Chimelong Ocean Park in Zhuhai before. Compared with Disney theme hotels and Universal theme hotels, what domestic theme hotels lack is IP. But this kind of thing needs to be accumulated. In fact, if you want to take a shortcut, Chimelong can try to buy the more popular animation IPs in recent years, such as Bear Infested, Nezha, and Green Snake, and re-upgrade on the original basis.
Speaking of the hotel, there is nothing to say about the service, the breakfast is also ok, and the peacock in the lobby really attracts children.
The only thing missing is that most of the room types are 36 square meters, which is a flaw. In fact, parent-child hotels can try to design more larger rooms.
In the end, the epidemic is really hard on these catering workers. After three days, there are basically no people in the zoo, and there is no need to queue up for the cable car. The same is true of the playground, there is basically no queue.
Last but not least, remind those who read the reviews that if you want to go to the big circus, you need to get a seat early if you want to save money, otherwise you will spend money to upgrade your seat.

It also upgrades the room type for free and extends the check-out time. Small-panel friends like it very much. Problems during the stay were quickly resolved at the store. It is very suitable for parent-child activities, and I will definitely continue to Ctrip next time.

The facilities inside are open regularly because of the epidemic, so some of them were not played.

msg:The last time I came to the big circus, I passed by the Panda Hotel. The cartoon and novel appearance of the hotel deeply attracted the attention of my boy. This time, it was arranged. When I entered the hotel, I was not disappointed. The whole hotel is designed around the theme of pandas. It is really cute. We adults like it, let alone children. Especially the Mengmeng elevator, which is really girly. When we got to the room, the kid was so excited that he couldn't wait to lie down on his chicken bed. It can be seen that the room items are carefully designed, the room is clean and tidy, and the bedding is comfortable.
      The next thing is to talk about the buffet lunch. There are not many people at lunch, and the dishes are rich and exquisite. Lamb chops and prawns are my favorites, and the desserts taste good. It is commendable that there are parrots, peacocks and raccoons in the hotel, which can be enjoyed while eating.
      The two-day itinerary was very full, but it was not particularly tiring. Because there were not many people traveling, it was the first time to go to Happy World without having to wait in a long queue. I was really happy! It is rare to have played almost all the games in the audience. The trip was perfect!

The two ambassadors, Lu Yingli, have a really good service attitude and are very patient.

msg:The hotel is very distinctive and warm. The hardware facilities are fully thoughtful to consider the needs of children. It is very good. It is the first choice for children. You can check in for a day of fun. The style that children like very much. There are many children's products. The transportation is convenient. There are shuttle buses to the park. The service attitude is good and caring. The one who is impressed is Miss Lu Yingli. Really super satisfied, the panda hotel must be taken with children.

msg:A very pleasant holiday. This time I took my baby girl out to play alone. As soon as my daughter entered the hotel, she danced and screamed happily! Like a dream world, there are cuteness everywhere! The daughter of the room really likes it, it's pink, cozy, clean and tidy! My daughter didn't want to go home anymore, she said she would live here! The service is also very good, thank you Miss Lu Yingli, she is very caring, if you have the opportunity to play again, I still choose the Panda Hotel! Like 👍

msg:This time I was traveling with a family. I was very happy to stay in the Panda Hotel. I felt very spacious when I entered the lobby. There is a small train above the lobby, but you can only watch it. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the rest area are particularly good to see the peacocks at close range. The hotel is also very close to the park. It is walkable and can take the free shuttle bar. It is quite convenient. The service of the hotel staff is also very good and very enthusiastic, especially It is the service ambassador Lu Yingli, who in general is very satisfied with this stay.

msg:Both the decoration style and the facilities of the hotel are dominated by panda triplets. They are very beautiful, and the peacock children can be seen in the lobby and they are very excited. The disposable items in the room can be used for free. The panda-patterned cup is also very cute. There is also a happy shop on the first floor where you can buy souvenirs. Our service ambassador Lu Yingli patiently answered us.

msg:There is a direct bus from Baiyun Airport to the Panda Hotel, but there are very few flights. There is a bus at 3:00 in the afternoon. The epidemic has reduced.
The hotel is relatively new, more suitable for children than the Chimelong Hotel, full of three pandas themes
There are children's toothbrushes, toilet seats, fences, diapers, mineral water, double bed against the wall, and no fences. The children are relatively safe but the area is a bit small. If the balcony is open, you need to call alone and sign the exemption. The balcony is even smaller.

The room stays in the cute room, the whole pink is suitable for the little girl, the handsome and handsome, the front desk was upgraded to a little girl’s room
Check-in is in the form of package + breakfast or dinner, several park tickets, the big circus, you need to identify the package that suits you, you need to calculate it, it’s a little troublesome
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are quite satisfactory, but for children, there are some dining chairs, tableware, and a theater panda show every half an hour. You can let your children follow you and parents eat quickly.
The overall attitude of the waiter is pretty good, except for a few lose faces, others are full of enthusiasm
There is a courtesy on the birthday month. Send a small cake, you can also take pictures with the panda in the lobby, send photos, send a voucher to feed the pigs in the small zoo, welcome fruits, decorate the room, these
There is a bus from the hotel to the south gate of the Safari Park, and every 15-20 minutes to other hotel parks.
Takeaways from the park can’t come in. It’s a bit troublesome to go to the nearest gate to get it. It’s quite far away
