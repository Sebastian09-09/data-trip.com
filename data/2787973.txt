We were upgraded to a higher floor with a better view, and all our requests were met by the staff with the utmost care and consideration. The location of this place makes the experience complete. Situated overlooking a bay with white sand and scattered rock formations, and the best water visibility this side of Sanya, this place is worth the trip. I highly recommend a stay here for a night or more.

Only one pool was open when we were there and we enjoyed using it in the evening as it was too hot during the day. We were given cookies and bottled water on check out which was a kind gesture (we were cycle touring around Hainan). We appreciated being able to keep our bicycles on the balcony of our room. Thank you for a lovely stay!

msg:Because I knew that Chang'e 6 would be launched on holiday, I chose Luneng Hilton Hotel. I didn't expect to grab the last room on the 2nd. Although the price was really expensive, it was worth it for this trip! The hotel is very big and has many rooms. The smart children's space room we stayed in is in Building 1, which is the building closest to the launch pad. The hotel has a specific room to watch the rocket launch, with a good view, avoiding the crowds on the beach! The hotel room area is acceptable, and the service facilities are complete. If there are any room needs, they will try their best to meet them! Wenchang is very humid. There is a musty smell as soon as you enter the room. The balcony door of the room cannot be opened casually. After opening it, the whole room will be flooded! The breakfast variety is rich and the breakfast tastes good. The waffles and rice noodles are delicious! Because we eat three meals a day in the hotel, the buffet for lunch and dinner seems to have very few varieties. The price of the buffet is more than 300 per person. Except for Buddha Jumps Over the Wall, there is nothing else to choose! The hotel lobby service and concierge service are quite good! During the two days of the launch, there were always many tourists in the hotel. However, the hotel provided a safe and comfortable resting space for many tourists, which relieved everyone's anxious and tired journey. I highly recommend it! The only flaw was that the sewer pipe in room 1517 where I stayed was leaking. Because I checked in too late, I told the hotel to solve it after I left the hotel! I hope the hotel will do better and better in the future!

Environment: It is a bit far from Wenchang City. It is also very convenient to eat in Longlou Town. It takes 8 or 9 yuan to get to the town center in 5 minutes by online taxi. There are too many Wenchang Chicken Rice Houses and Dad Tea to choose from. In front of the hotel is the Qishui Bay Beach. You can see the sea from the balcony of the room. The hotel can walk directly to the beach. It is very comfortable to take a walk on the beach in the evening and take pictures to watch the sunset.

msg:The hotel, which was transferred from Haikou Marriott, has been through ten years of ups and downs. It is really not simple.

The hotel is really a great choice for family travel. Both the environment and the service are impressive.

🌿Environment:
As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, the children run around excitedly. The penetrating lobby can smell the sea, and the sense of beach immersion fills your mind.

🏊♂️Entertainment:
It is close to the sea, has its own garden, and all-weather parent-child activities. It can be seen that the brand and the owner have a deep understanding of tourism, so that adults and children can find a way to relax that suits them.

👩👧👦Service: Name and praise 3 employees in different positions, from the housekeeper Lulu to properly arrange and coordinate communication... to the hospitality of the big brother who picks up the station... and finally to the concierge brother who delivers to the guest room...
From housekeeping, fitness, and catering, every time you come in, you greet like an old friend, which makes people feel warm

The room was also upgraded from the first floor to a sea view room. The children had a lot of fun. It was a very satisfying weekend trip. The environment was really comfortable ~ Going downstairs to the beach, it is worth recommending! !

msg:It is really difficult to choose a hotel in Wenchang. After struggling for a long time, I chose Hilton. I had many concerns before placing the order because I saw that it was humid, far away, and old. But I am glad that I made the right choice. It is the leader among the first-tier hotels in Wenchang in all aspects.
The housekeeper Lulu contacted me the day before arrival and asked about my needs and room preferences. She hoped that the room would not be too humid. The next day, she told us that we had upgraded to a sea view room. Thank you very much! Lulu's own guide was also very attentive! We arrived late that day, and after asking Lulu, she also helped us to delay the check-out of the room, which was very considerate.
The hotel is located on the beach of Qishui Bay. The lobby is transparent, and the service staff are also very good. They will take the initiative to say hello on the way. After arriving in the room, the facilities and equipment are overall ok. It has been open for many years, but it can be seen that it is carefully maintained. The humidity is indeed inseparable from the weather in Wenchang, and it can also be seen that the hotel has been attentive. The air conditioner was turned on and the room door was closed before check-in. So the overall room is still very comfortable.
The breakfast is not bad, with a wide variety, and the noodles and noodles are delicious. And the breakfast time is long, so you can sleep in before coming.
The distance to the beach is relatively close, within 10 minutes, but it also depends on the building of the room, generally not far.
The surrounding area is not very desolate, and it is convenient to go to some attractions. You can drive out to find snacks, supper, and tea. In general, the cost-effectiveness of staying in the off-season is quite high.

The room I stayed in this time was on the 5th floor of Building 7. The balcony can see the sunrise and the seaside. The moment I opened the balcony door, my heart seemed to calm down. The shower in the hotel was very comfortable, and the bed did not feel damp. I could fall asleep quickly in bed after a day of playing.

The buffet breakfast is on the first floor, with a relatively rich variety. There are also many seats in the restaurant. You can have breakfast quietly and then go to the beach or swimming pool. This trip was a bit rushed, and I did not use the hotel facilities. I would like to choose Hilton again next time if I have the chance.

Improvement: As a repeat guest, it is recommended that the mineral water and tissue paper in the room are not obvious in the bathroom. When I came for the first time, I thought there was no room in the room, so I called the guest room to get a few more bottles.
I have stayed in many Hilton hotels, and dehumidifiers are installed directly in the hotels, not to mention Wenchang. I have to actively request them every time. They should be installed in every room. It is too humid here and there is a musty smell everywhere.
The breakfast was very good, with many varieties, and the waiter collected the dishes in a timely manner.

Thank you, Concierge Chen Baojie~
The airport (high-speed rail station) pick-up service that I helped arrange was simply great.
Our trip was delayed because we forgot our luggage on the high-speed train. The person helped us make a new reservation without saying a word. Since we both had a late shift, my husband and I were the only two people on the bus when we came back.

Thank you very much 🙏

Because we were on a honeymoon trip and the time was tight, we didn’t bring the kids. I will definitely bring the kids next time. It was great!

but! Compared with Sanya hotels, the price-performance ratio is not too high.

msg:The room is clean, the hotel garden and the breakfast are all good! Especially the service staff. Miss Lucky called to take care of us before we arrived at the hotel. After we arrived at the store, we were also well arranged. A tall male porter at the door helped to send us to the far 7510. The room attendant on duty that afternoon (18th) was also very enthusiastic and responsive! The breakfast was also good. The hotel is very suitable for self-driving tourists. Qishui Bay is very beautiful. It is very pleasant to take a stroll in the morning. From the hotel, you can see the Wenchang launch site from a distance. Hearing that we are interested in this, Lucky specially adjusted the room where you can see the launch pad. Another thing is that it is close to the Dongjiao Coconut Grove. We drove for half an hour to a coconut milk chicken restaurant called Hengwei that we had eaten two years ago. Although it is far, the quality of the chicken is worth the trip. Personally, I think Luneng Hilton is a choice worth stopping at when driving from Haikou to Sanya!

msg:I chose Hilton Hotel for a self-driving tour in Wenchang. It has butler service. The butler Lucky is very attentive and considerate. He communicated the check-in time and requirements in advance the day before check-in. Because it was not a holiday, he also helped upgrade the room type to a sea view room on that day. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very beautiful to take pictures of Qishui Bay when you go out. It is within 15 minutes by car from Stone Park, Tongguling and Foguang Temple, and only 10 minutes by car from Longlou Town. There are many delicious foods in the town, and the breakfast of the hotel is also very rich. Ctrip's package also gives away tickets for Tongguling Scenic Area + sightseeing bus, the scenery is worth seeing; the free travel photography in Qishui Bay is also very good.
In short, the hotel's facilities and services, as well as the service of the butler Lucky, are great. I will bring my family here if I have the chance~

There are basically no people. It's still pretty good after the tide recedes. The hotel staff is also very good. They also sent local guides and checked in at several delicacies. Basically, there are no thunders. The price is also reasonable. It is indeed authentic local food, especially the seafood, really small seafood and the like. The sea white, the squid is so fresh that it explodes. Overall, it is worth staying. After all, staying in an executive suite at this price is really a big bargain wa

The environment in the hotel is super nice and beautiful. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to Qishui Bay. There are few people and the water is clean. The tickets for Tongguling Park and the battery car are also provided by the hotel. The total cost of the two scenic spots is 90 yuan (ticket 45 yuan) (Basic car 45 yuan), a taxi is about 10 yuan. You can also go on a tour not far from the hotel. You must go, it’s so beautiful. Thanks again lulu for your service. Will come again if I have the chance! Provide a few more photos for reference!

The room has a ceiling fan and air conditioner. The sockets are a bit weak and need to be updated.
The breakfast is delicious and there are many choices.
The hotel is in a place where there is no village or store in front and behind, so we took the children to solve the problem of eating in the hotel. Fortunately, the Chinese restaurant is not bad.
The free Tongguling ticket also comes with a sightseeing bus, and we happily went up the mountain to enjoy the beautiful seaside scenery. If you buy the ticket yourself, it feels that the cost performance is not high.

Advantages: A few steps along the garden is Qishui Bay. The bay with rocks is really beautiful. The sound insulation is super good, you can't hear the sound from next door.

The breakfast was extremely rich, and I was surprised by the crispy pork stewed with cabbage. You can also make an appoin**ent for travel photography. In addition to the free photos, the single purchase is not expensive. The important thing is that there will be no forced buying or selling.
Disadvantages: The air conditioner cannot dehumidify, and the balcony clothes drying rack should be replaced with a new one.

Maybe it's more beautiful when it's sunny. The swimming pool is far away from the guest room and it feels super cold when I walk there. The butler Lucky was very helpful before checking in. I was given a check-in guide and thoughtfully arranged the room guide. The food guide in the room guide is very useful and you can eat without making any mistakes! It’s so crowded during the Chinese New Year~

msg:Stayed at the Wenchang Hilton for two nights~ It was a good experience
The hotel is located in Qishui Bay and Coconut Grove Beach🏝️, with its own central lawn and beautiful scenery~
It’s about a 15-minute drive from Tongguling and Wenchang Aerospace Science Center, which is quite convenient~
The hotel has all-day children's recreational activities, some of which are charged and some are free. Generally, there will be a recreational activity for free. We chose baking biscuits and digging for sand crabs on the beach for two rooms, which my little friends liked better.
The food is just average.
The service is okay. The butler Liang Yan added WeChat and sent surrounding guides for reference.

Special thanks to my housekeeper Lulu, who was very warm, thoughtful, professional and meticulous. Thank you very much. Before every parent-child activity in the hotel starts, someone will notify you in advance. Or if we have new requirements, the housekeeper will coordinate and implement them as soon as possible. The beach is not far from where you can play in the sand, and the breakfast is also good. It is a very comfortable family trip. I will stay here again next time I come to Wenchang.

msg:I read a lot of reviews before booking the hotel, and I was a little confused. Finally, I booked a sea view suite. I loved it as soon as I entered the room! A very large house with unparalleled sea views! I saw many stars on the balcony at night and even saw a shooting star. The washroom is also large. It's worth staying here on weekdays. It is much quieter here than Sanya. It was very quiet at night, the room was dark, and I slept very well. During the launch of the rocket, the price will be five times, which is very expensive. The service here is pretty good. I have stayed in many rooms with butlers, and I have to say that this butler (Liang Yan) really responded to all requests and even provided coconuts and breakfast as gifts. I have to say, I was quite happy to see two beaten coconuts when I opened the door. The pillows are a little softer. The hotel is very close to the beach, which is very convenient. The only thing is that the hair dryer is too outdated and it takes three times as long to dry my hair. This hotel did not immediately invalidate the key card at check-out time. So I find it easy to come back and pick up things after I leave them behind. It was a pleasant stay.

In addition, the fruits are also super delicious. The dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are not only unique but also very good. We booked a Super Wings space-themed sea view king-size bed room. It was exactly the same as the one introduced on Ctrip.com. The room environment was very good. It was not only clean and sanitary, but also all the items were very new. The room was cleaned cleanly and promptly. The hotel provided When free items need to be replaced or replenished, the hotel staff always replace and replenish them in time. The staff are responsible, meticulous, and do every little thing with a sunny and positive attitude. The room is equipped with children's play equipment. The children had a great time playing with the spliced ​​building blocks, rocket tents and airplane pedal cars. Fresh and delicious welcome fruits were provided when checking into the hotel. The hard work of every hotel staff made us feel at home. In particular, Ms. Lulu, the housekeeper of the hotel who was responsible for the room we booked, used her enthusiastic service concept and serious and meticulous work style to make our family feel comfortable and have fun in the hotel for just one week. I would like to express my heartfelt and sincere thanks to Ms. Lulu and praise your service attitude and working style👍. At the same time, I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to every hard-working staff member of the hotel. It was our first time to visit Wenchang. The Wenchang Hilton Hotel left a very good impression on me and my family. We will choose Wenchang Luneng Hilton Hotel next time. Wenchang not only has the beautiful Qishui Bay Beach but also the even more beautiful Wenchang. Luneng Hilton Hotel.

msg:I stayed for two nights and brought my children here to experience the charm of the aerospace town and to introduce the children to aerospace knowledge. Overall, I am very satisfied. The children had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Special thanks to Teacher Guo Ping from the children's center. She taught the children seriously and took a lot of photos and videos. The children were reluctant to leave when they left.

Facilities: A little old, but still very useful. The indoor swimming pool is great
Hygiene: I don’t know if it was because it rained during the two days I stayed, but there was a damp smell in the room.
Environment: Very good, worthy of being a long-established hotel, the garden design is very grand
Service: Not bad. The child care service is very good, but it is charged separately. If it is included in the room rate, the experience will be better.

In addition, I had severe skin allergies after staying for two days. I don't know whether it was due to the humid climate or dust mites in the air conditioner. I am usually very allergic to dust mites. I hope that if the hotel encounters rainy weather, they can turn on the air conditioner in advance to remove moisture or clean the air conditioner regularly.

msg:A particularly perfect experience. There was no room available at the pre-sale hotel in Sanya, so we temporarily changed the trip to Wenchang, which far exceeded expectations.
The hotel's free upgrade to the invincible sea view room allows you to directly see the rocket launch tower of Wenchang Base from the balcony. The room steward Liang Yan is very considerate, provides sand digging tools, mineral water, quilts, children's toothbrushes, slippers, late check-out, basically everything I can think of the customer before I leave the store. I only remember to issue the invoice and handle it in a timely manner. It's great! The gourmet roast chicken in the guide is really good, and you can also order takeout and have it delivered to the hotel. The gift of a small aerospace classroom was a surprise. The handmade rocket must be made by Lao Gao. The children were so happy. The teachers Guo Ping and He Rongze were very patient. Seeing that the children were having fun, they even extended the time by 15 minutes. It only takes 5 minutes to walk to Qishuiwan Beach. The travel photography is also very good. There are beautiful scenery everywhere. I want to come again if I have the chance!

msg:Because it was raining and the temperature was cooling down, I chose the Hilton brand considering the environment. I have never given any negative reviews and it was such a terrible experience to stay in a hotel. 1. The check-in hall was windy, and I didn’t wear enough clothes. It was eight o’clock There is only one person checking in at the front desk, and the other two are busy with their own affairs. The person on duty at night can understand whether it depends on the actual situation. I asked if it can be upgraded, and the staff said no, that's okay.
2. After checking in, I said I needed children's toiletries for the playpen, but they didn't arrive for more than an hour. I called again to urge them, but they didn't notify me of my needs at all. The playpen was not fixed when it was pressed, causing the child and the playpen to fall to the ground. Well, luckily it just fell a little bit
3. After checking in, there was no information or introduction about the usage. I just gave the room card and told me to go this way. All the corridors were ventilated and it was so refreshing. I had to go upstairs and downstairs to find a room.
4. The minibar in the room was empty. They called me and told me that I needed to consume it, but my order was included for free. I later called back and told me that they could give me Coke and orange juice if I needed it. Am I unable to afford it myself or something? I don’t need you to send it, just guarantee my normal rights and interests.
5. We didn’t know that there was air leakage from the balcony door of the room. We only knew that it was cold outside and the room was cold. We asked the room service staff to help adjust the heating to 30 degrees, but it was still cold after two hours. I restarted it and it was still cold. It was already midnight. It’s after 11 o’clock, and they can only give you quilts, and the bedside lamp is broken.
6. It’s strange that the 100-square-meter children’s park closes at 8pm and opens at 11am. The order includes a cookie DIY that starts at 10:30 (normally it costs 58 per time). When I called to make a reservation the next morning, I was told that I needed to make an appoin**ent in advance. One day, why didn't you tell me when you checked in? Please make it clear that it was my fault that I didn't make an appoin**ent. Also, we didn't mention the redemption of tickets to the Rocket Science Center, let alone give them to us. It was the staff at the science center who informed us of the need after we checked out. We only found out after redeeming the tickets that we had no choice but to go back to the hotel to get the tickets. We went back and forth in the cold weather, which made us really angry.
7. The indoor heated swimming pool needs to be reached through the outer corridor. It opens at 8 a.m., and the water temperature is still 25 degrees when we get there at 10:40. Children in the gym cannot use it.
If you just want to sleep, you can barely consider it. If you are bringing children, you should avoid this pitfall. The environment is not very ideal, let alone the service. The only thing that I think is not bad is the room service guy who takes the trouble to deliver the service, and After checking out, a concierge guy at the door offered to help with my luggage. The rest really made me want to explode. I had recommended it to a friend before. Thinking about my own experience, I must have been comforted by him!

My daughter and I watched the sunrise in the room. If we take a bath, we can also see the sea view. There is a swing on the first floor of the hotel towards the beach, and there is Qishui Bay not far away. Many children play in the sand there. We made an appoin**ent with the hotel for a free family trip and spent the afternoon taking photos and digging in the sand until the sky darkened. I went back to the room after feeling a bit cold due to the dark sea breeze. My daughter said she was very satisfied. The butler Lulu's service was great. He helped us apply for a late check-out, booked a free shuttle bus to the high-speed rail station, and also provided check-in guides and travel consultations. Thank you! There is also a convenience store in the hotel which is very convenient. My daughter and I also stayed in the lobby lounge for half a day, each enjoying Haagen-Dazs and latte. It was beautiful!

Not only did she make a guide, but she also consulted on her housing preferences and needs at any time. I have stayed in so many five-star hotels, and this is the first time I have received such warm and proactive service.

msg:Service: The hotel service is super good. The dedicated butler contacted us one day in advance. After asking about their needs, they upgraded the sea view room for free when many people checked in (the room I booked before was on the first floor and there was no sea view). I was given a self-made guide, and knowing that there were three of us staying, I also took the initiative to give a set of toiletries. During check-in and check-out, there is a concierge guy who helps with luggage, which is very considerate. Environment: From the balcony of the sea view room, you can directly see the sunrise on the seaside. It's very close to the beach. The sand on the beach is very fine. We also had a beach activity to teach us how to catch sand crabs. We were very happy. Consumption: I don’t think the price is too expensive. The room rate of more than 700 yuan includes breakfast for two people, travel photography, space center tickets, and sea activities. I think it is quite worth it. There is a small bar in the hotel. I went to have a cocktail with my best friend in the evening. The alcoholic drink was only 40 yuan. There was no service charge. It felt cheaper than spending at a bar at home. There were also beautiful desserts for 26 yuan. The price is also considered a fairly normal price. Overall, it was really worth it. If we hadn't booked a hotel in Wanning, we would have stayed a few more days. Finally, thank you to the dedicated butler Lucky for your attentive service. It is really thoughtful.

Rather than bothering to search for guides on various platforms, it is indeed a labor-saving and worry-free choice to directly choose an established star-rated hotel. Hilton is in a very good location, very close to scenic spots such as Qishui Bay and Tongguling. The entire hotel is very large.

In addition, there was something wrong with our room on the night of November 8th, and the manager on duty (we didn't ask his name) was very enthusiastic and helped us solve it. I would also like to thank you for this. Unfortunately, there is no bellboy at the entrance of the hotel lobby. It would be better if there was a bellboy. In short, given the warm service from Hilton people, we will choose Hilton Hotel Wenchang again.

She should be the best housekeeper I have ever stayed in any hotel. 2. It rained and the roads were slippery when I checked in. The corridors were covered with carpets, which was very friendly to me who wears old slippers. 3. Breakfast is provided as a gift. The breakfast is very delicious, with a full range of varieties and delicious taste. 4. The room is quite good, with a wooden ceiling fan, and the room size is OK. It is recommended that when upgrading in the future, we try to figure out how to cover the balcony from rain. The plug of the hair dryer is a bit loose and difficult to use. 5. A cycling event was being held when I checked in. There were many motorcycles at the door and it was very messy. Parking space planning and front door command need to be strengthened. 6. The signs on Buildings 6, 7, and 8 of the hotel are not very clear. It is recommended that they be revised and strengthened. 7. The air conditioner is not turned on very much and I have not tested it. I don’t know if it is strong enough. The Wyndham in South China where I stayed before was very strong and very air-conditioned.

Thanks to lucky Feng for contacting us as soon as possible and helping us extend our stay on the last day for three consecutive days, saving us the trouble of moving rooms. On the first day, sand digging tools were prepared for the children. The children had a great time playing on the beach. Travel photography is also great, it’s rare to take a photo of yourself. Afternoon tea is also good. Since the two children took a nap, we agreed to pack it back to the room to eat. Overall, this trip was really fun, and the children in the aerospace classroom also had a lot of fun participating. The child said that he didn’t want to leave and would come again, so he would come back next year to watch the rocket launch, haha.
In short, watching rocket launches on the beach is a really great experience! So handsome. I’ll take my two kids to watch the final launch of Fat Five in 2023. It’s perfect.

msg:There is a hotel dedicated shuttle bus to Wenchang High-speed Railway Station to pick up the station. It is free of charge. The hotel butler's service is attentive, meticulous and enthusiastic. He informed the shuttle bus departure schedule one day in advance. After arriving at the hotel, the room was upgraded and checked in immediately. It is spacious and bright, with a large balcony facing the sea and an unobstructed sea view. , vast lawns, beautiful coconut grove ecological garden, the environment is so beautiful. I had a wonderful sleep on the soft and comfortable bed. The room was clean and tidy and the temperature was suitable. The hotel is very close to Tongguling Scenic Area and Stone Park, about 3-4 kilometers away. The scenery is charming and worth a visit. The hotel is close to the seaside. The beach, fine sand, boulders, coconut groves and the sunset are the best places to take pictures. In particular, the food in the hotel restaurant is really authentic, with a variety of Hainanese dishes that are unforgettable and delicious, and the breakfast is even richer. In the afternoon, we provide free afternoon tea for two people, with carefully prepared coffee, fruit, cakes and popcorn. We will come back again.

msg:The service was perfect. The customer service manager Lucky was super attentive and provided personal tips. I was very satisfied. The hardware of the hotel is old, so you can accept it. It goes directly through the woods and is very close to the beach. However, it is inconvenient to go back to the hotel after dark. There are no lights on the shortest original route, so you have to go around in a big circle to go back from the main entrance. Maybe I am not familiar with the road. It should be fun to watch rocket launches with a 300 focal length camera.

msg:A poor experience. Although upgraded, the room facilities are old. The underground parking lot (the car cannot be parked underground because there are items in the car that cannot be exposed to the sun) is too far from the room. The access is extremely eerie. There was also a problem with the elevator after parking at night. After getting off the parking lot, the return button is invalid, and the safe passage is like **. The service efficiency was low. In the morning of the next day, my companion locked the toilet, and it took half an hour for someone to repair it. I asked the service depar**ent to send two handbags and they urged me many times. What’s even more outrageous is that more than half a day after check-out, the front desk didn’t register. , affecting check-in for the next part of the journey, so I called to check out. Really needs to be improved.

msg:The housekeeper Liang Yan is very dedicated and the service is very good! However, the hotel's breakfast needs to be improved, there are not many varieties and it is relatively ordinary! The key card was demagnetized twice during the stay, and the facilities need to be upgraded! No matter what, it is still a better choice to take your children to watch rocket launches

msg:Traveling by car, the hotel service is very good. I am especially grateful to Miss Liang Yan for contacting us in advance and giving us travel guides and upgrading the sea view room. Qishuiwan Beach is free to visit. It's right after leaving the hotel. It's really convenient. I will stay here next time I come to Wenchang.
