Impeccable service from front desk to service staff. Special thanks to Manager Mr Johnson and service staff Karina, Jeff , etc. Everyone is always so helpful and would serve with a genuine smile.

It's not easy to travel with elderly parents and 2 young kids, but the impeccable service and close proximity to good food and shopping more than make up for it.

Fantastic.

Rooms are very large and spacious. Very clean too. The hotel interior could do with an update but it‚Äôs ok otherwise. Breakfast is simple. Has the necessary stations but service is rather slow. Friendly though. Staff not all can speak English. 
Overall, still happy to stay here and would definitely come back again if I‚Äôm in Xiamen.

msg:My elderly mom and I visited Xiamen for a 5D4N private trip. Booked Millennium Harbourview Hotel again on the 3rd and 4th day stay due to the superb and convenient location. 

When we reached the hotel around 4 pm, we were greeted by a hotel staff wearing a black coat. He helped us to push our luggage bags from the main entrance until our room. We really appreciate his kindness. 

From the hotel, turn right and walk along the road until you cross the traffic light and reach the end, turn right again until you reach Heping Wharf to onboard the ship for Lujiang night tour. 20 mins walk. There's 2 sessions available, 7.30 pm & 8 pm. It cost RMB109 perpax. The night tour took around 1 hour to finish. 

The sky in Xiamen started to get bright at 5 am. If you can wake up early, this is the best time to go out and walk around the hotel surrounding area. It's cool and windy. It's a good time to take photos as only a few people and cars are on the street. It's very peaceful and safe to walk along the road. We didn't see any cat, dog, or birds on the street. 

A 30 mins walk to Haibin Park to see the sea and Gulangyu Island. You may also rent a bicycle that is available at the roadside in front of the hotel. 

There's many local food roadside stalls available in front of the hospital beside the hotel. 

We requested the hotel staff to arrange a taxi to send us to airport T3 during checkout. The whole process took around 7 mins, from checkout until we board the taxi. We really appreciate the front door staff dressed in red uniform to call for the taxi and helped us to upload our luggage bags in the car. The journey to the airport took around 30 mins and cost us RMB50. 

I hope the hotel management can consider changing the room mattress as it's too old. The pillow is too flat. Good for sleep but not for resting. The room is very clean, but the wooden headboard frame was sticky when i lay my head on it. The bathroom rain shower head needs a fix as cold water dripping down when i'm using the handheld showerhead.

Cannot say enough good things about front-of-hpuse Mr Micheal Chen, whose English was exceptional, and politeness incredible. He helped book our ferry tickets to Gulangyu even! If you meet him, ask about Fawlty Towers! ü§£ 
The same cannot be said of 1 lady working in the breakfast buffet. I got a plate of bread to share and was told if I liked bread that much, then they sell it!!!! It felt like she was always scrutinising us every time we went for food. I doubt she said that to anyone with a plateful of dumplings. It made us feel uncomfortable every time we went for breakfast after that, and that is not a sign of a good hotel. I won't return to Xiamen, but because of her, if I did I'd choose a different hotel.

There are a few local Xiamen souvenir shops along the streets which sells the local candies and biscuits.

If you don't like the crowd there is the ‰∏≠ÂçéÂüé mall right opposite the hotel with all the international brands boutique and local restaurants. 

Next to the hotel is the ZhenHai Road station. The metro is great for visiting the attractions. If you can activate your Alipay with credit card or with a stored value. The Metrol and Bus will be a breeze with the QR Code.

The Hotel staff are very courteous and pleasant. The morning breakfast is decent but not fantastic. Edge towards Chinese breakfast.

The room has the basic amenities. However the furniture and decor is a bit outdated and old. Has a bit of old furniture smell. Cosy room. View of the room is not bad. Can oversee the bustling streets and the architectures.

Overall an acceptable experience, easy location to the Metro and the local food.

msg:I was on vacation in Xiamen and chose this place very early. üòÉ
The service staff was very considerate. I found that I couldn't find any channels on the TV, so they came to tell me how to adjust the channels. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
There is a subway station underneath, and it was very close to transfer to the BRT in the past. üòÉ
The buffet is particularly rich for breakfast, lunch and dinner (there is a buffet lunch and dinner on weekends). üòã
The small flaw is that it happened to be raining when we got here, so the scenery was not very ideal. If the weather is nice, the view of the Petronas Twin Towers in the distance will be quite amazing üôÇ .
All in all, this is a pretty great hotel. üòä

As soon as I got off the bus, a porter came up to help us with our luggage and guided us to the front desk to check in. The front desk guy was very enthusiastic and had a good service attitude. I would like to thank Cameron at the front desk for helping me solve many problems and recommending a delicious restaurant and surrounding attractions. The original room was a bathtub where I had to stand to take a shower. He suggested that I pay the difference to upgrade the room. After the upgrade, it was really worth the money. Not only did the bathtub problem solve, but the room was also newer and the scenery was better.

I tried both shacha noodles and shrimp noodles, which were quite appetizing. Thanks for her introduction. Xiamen is a beautiful city, and people walk at a leisurely pace. I like it here very much.

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels in this price range and I have never experienced such a difference! First of all, we are 4 adults and 2 children, and we booked 2 parent-child suites. The page said there was a double bed and a single bed, but in reality, both rooms had 2 single beds, so I ended up with sofas in both rooms. All used! Then, except for the public areas such as the lobby, the rest of the hotel can be described as old. Then there is the service. Do you want comfortable service? There will be angry service. They don't help with luggage, but they actually need the child's ID to register when booking a room. I don't understand what that means. The most annoying thing came when I bought medicine for my child's allergies at night and the takeout could not be delivered. I asked the front desk to help deliver it. Later, I called back and said that the robot was broken and could not deliver it. The robot is indeed more reliable than your waiter. In the end, I insisted on delivery before I delivered it. The price for 2 rooms for 2 nights is 9876. Is this a hotel at this price? Is it worthy? The experience is extremely poor! The only advantage is that it is close to the pedestrian street. It is also my fault that led to this suffering!

The room is also spacious, clean and tidy. Overall, the hardware is good.
But, I have to say but. The service is really... not good enough. It's not that the attitude is bad, but many details really need to be improved. First of all, the business content. In a place like Xiamen where it rains frequently, it should be common for shoes to get wet, but it is very regrettable that the hotel does not have a drying service. We stayed in a hotel in another city in Fujian Province. In fact, the room cleaning and paper towel replenishment were not timely. In just a few days, there were several empty paper towels. Many hotels will directly put a whole bag for guests to use, but this hotel did not do this. The third is the hotel's drainage, which should be unblocked in time. The fourth is the ironing machine. Can it be updated? It is unexpected to directly send an iron with an ironing board. . . Now a handheld or hanging iron is not expensive. Such a modern hotel should keep up with the times.
Summary: Overall it's OK, but the service details need to be improved.

I read the reviews on Ctrip on 2/13 and when I placed the order, I chose this old five-star restaurant. I thought it would be right, and the facts proved that the choice was OK.
I arrived at the hotel after twelve o'clock and checked in smoothly. I told the guy at the front desk that I wanted to have a sea view, and I was given a room on the 18th floor with a sea view. Hahaha, it was already very good.
The location of the hotel is very good. It takes 12 minutes to walk to the pier. Zhongshan Road is very close, Chinatown is next door, and Zhenhai Road Station of Metro Line 1 is downstairs. It takes 20 minutes to ride to Xiamen University. Xiamen has a lot of traffic jams during the holidays, so being able to ride a bike is very important.
Stayed for two nights. The hotel room was clean and well-equipped. Although the breakfast variety was not as good as those of new five-star brands, it was rich enough, including various breads, Chinese snacks, coffee, milk, various hot porridge, hot noodle soup, salads, and fruits. Meet your energy needs for the day. During the Spring Festival holiday, there weren‚Äôt many people eating breakfast after 8 o‚Äôclock. My son and I ate very full every day and went out, and we didn‚Äôt have lunch until 1:30 in the afternoon, which was off-peak.

All the staff on the first floor are very friendly and help me solve any problems immediately. I will stay here again next time I go to Xiamen:)

The receptionist was very polite and upgraded my room for free.
The buffet breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western meals, which is very rich.
It is very close to Zhongshan Road, the pier and the beach. It is suitable for children and the elderly. See you in the next ten years - the millennium!

Line 1 subway is just outside the door, and Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street is only a 5-minute walk away. Secondly, the hotel environment is also very good. Nice room clean and tidy with complete facilities. What impressed me the most was the service. I booked a room by mistake because I didn't understand the room type. After learning about my problem, the front desk actively solved the problem for me and upgraded the room type. Next time you travel to Xiamen, your first choice will definitely be Xiamen Seaview Millennium Hotel

I called the lobby four times and dispatched floor attendants and floor supervisor engineering and maintenance personnel respectively, but the problem has not been solved. Finally, I asked the management to change the room to a room on the 20th floor. The room I stayed in at the beginning did not have a bathrobe. I found the waiter and said that it was not provided on the floor where I stayed, but there was conditioner in the bathroom facilities. The room I changed later had a bathrobe, but it lacked conditioner. All in all, there are problems like this. The location is acceptable. Sea view rooms have sea views and are not far from Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. But the overall feeling is different from that of a five-star hotel. If it is not a very cold season, the temperature of the room should be more comfortable.

I checked the strategy, checked the hotel, and read the reviews for a long time. Originally, I didn‚Äôt read his 4.4-point reviews. I booked another five-star foreign-funded hotel, but I also used Ctrip‚Äôs background manual customer service online service on the first day. There were replies from his home and another 4-star hotel, and that morning, my son said to find a closer one before changing the hotel. Let me talk about hygiene first: 5 points, very clean, you can rest assured. Then the service: um...it‚Äôs okay, the praise was originally only 4 points, because I went home by train at 15:40, so I hope I can help to delay the check-out. , and then the floor service staff will take the initiative to greet you. The next day when you return to the hotel, you have helped tidy up the room, replenish the toothbrush, praise üëç, the concierge took the initiative to open the door, and finally asked me to give 5 points for service. There is a woman, it should be The chief mate or the front office manager, etc., have been standing in the lobby with a very good attitude, and the storage is super gentle, and they keep telling her to come, let me not move, and express my gratitude. Facilities: I can only say that it is similar to a guest house (see the picture below). The toothbrush is very hard, the shampoo and shower gel are not sure what brand it is... the slippers are also very ordinary, the water glass is an ordinary and ordinary glass, and there is no shading in the room Curtains, the overall lighting in the room is relatively dark, there is a broken spotlight at the head of the bed, and the bed has no backrest, it is directly against the wall. The sound insulation may be good, but I can hear a child crying there every day. The hair dryer is old. You have to stand in the bathtub when you take a shower. The room is not equipped with bathrobes and there is no minibar. The window looks at the swimming pool, which is opposite The building completely blocks the line of sight and cannot see the scenery, because there are no additional products, such as welcome fruit, delayed check-out until 2:00 or even 3:00 p.m., night bed, supper, and departure souvenirs. So, that's it. For the facilities, I feel that five stars should not be worthy, after all, the price is not cheap. The third is the environment, which is old overall, but clean, and the service staff have a good sense of initiative. Location: I thought it was close to the pier at first, but in fact, when we go to Gulangyu Island, we need to go to Xiagu Wharf to take a boat, so we still need to take a taxi , Then you have to take the subway or take a taxi to go to the botanical garden. It is not close by walking, Huandao Road is farther away, Zengcuo'an is also far away, that is, it is close to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, so the geographical advantage is average. After all, we are going to play, not to go shopping.

msg:The worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. I came back from a trip at night to take a shower. When I turned off the faucet after washing, I suddenly got an electric shock (very baffling). I called the front desk immediately, but they didn‚Äôt come to check the result immediately. Instead, we were asked to dry our hands before checking in. We were really speechless. What a weird suggestion. We asked to change rooms and were told that there were no rooms. As a result, the two of them were unable to take a shower. There was also the occasional ticking sound of water in the bathroom in the middle of the night, which made it impossible to sleep. They spent more than 1,400 on the hotel. They could not take a shower and fell asleep. It was really the first time they met. The key point was that the hotel's attitude was indifferent. , without any processing results. Ctrip‚Äôs rating of 4.4 turns out to be reasonable. Choose carefully.

However, the hotel's facilities are relatively average. The decor of the room is a bit dated and may need some updating and maintenance. In addition, the hotel's entertainment facilities are limited, which may be a bit disappointing for some guests who want more leisure options.
Overall, if you value quality service, this hotel is a good choice. But if you have higher requirements for facilities, you may need to reconsider. Hope the hotel can make some improvements in facilities to provide a more perfect stay experience.

msg:After looking at the booking software for a long time, I finally chose Seaview Millennium. Overall, there are pros and cons.

Location: Just next to Exit 3A of Zhenhai Road Terminal Station of Metro Line 1, there are convenience stores and Ruixing next to the hotel, and there is a bus stop about 50 meters away, and China City is diagonally opposite (there are not many restaurants in it, and the mall has insufficient air conditioning. So hot). In the past, Zhongshan Road was also very convenient, about 5 minutes away!

Facilities: It‚Äôs true that the grilled chicken is old and the bathroom is very narrow, but I think the shower design is not bad. The bathtub and shower are in the same space, which is relatively convenient, but the sink and toilet are too narrow Come on! ! !

Breakfast: Not rich at all, the authentic Xiamen cuisine is not delicious at all, the only thing that is okay is the "noodle stall", because after the chef cooks it for you, you can choose the ingredients. I made a bowl of hot and sour noodles, so I think it's okay, but if you need to charge extra, I suggest that you may be better off ordering takeaway yourself!

Service: neither warm nor cold! I have never experienced the special experience that other housing has had... There is no late check-out! No room upgrade! No free meals! Nothing at all

Swimming pool: The outdoor swimming pool in summer is really impossible to play in the morning, the sun is too hot...

Facilities: The facilities are aging, as shown in the picture, the five-star hotel with the worst configuration of the Westin I have stayed in
Hygiene: basically qualified, the toilet is aging, there are many water stains on the doorüö™
Service: Regarding the service, I would like to seriously comment on the three service staff who checked in and impressed me deeply
The first place: the handsome guy at the front desk who checked in, the receptionist was polite, arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock, and asked if it was possible to check in in advance, the front desk said yes after the room check, and the check-in was smooth.
The second person: I went to have breakfast at 8 o'clock this morning. When I was about to leave the room, I heard the doorman was very noisy. After I opened the door, I saw that it was the room manager and criticized the room staff. When I went out to the elevator, I walked in the wrong direction. ,üà∂Turning back and walking, I passed the room manager twice during the whole process. She didn't look up at the guests during the whole process. She was only criticizing the room attendant, and her voice was very loud. The whole corridor was full of her blaming voice. After reading The room attendant kept his head down and didn't speak a word. This process made me feel that the manager was not worthy. He was cursing people outside the room door after 8 o'clock in the morning. Did he take the customer's rest into consideration? Are guests disturbed? And when we passed by to find the elevator, we didn't prompt or ask questions, which really made us feel very bad. Bad review! My room number is 1209/I hope the leader will check the floor monitoring to see if what I said is true!
The third person: I took a taxi at the entrance of the hotel after 10 o'clock, but the driver didn't get out of the car. A thin hotel lady took the initiative to help me carry my suitcase and put it in the trunk. Thank you very much.
The five-star hotels in Xiamen Island are very old and the equipment is aging. This hotel wins because of its location and convenient travel. If it is redundant, it will not be evaluated.

It is also very convenient to take a bus from the train station. , I would like to thank the front desk for helping me upgrade to a room with a double bed. The breakfast of 138 yuan for foreign guests and 98 yuan for tenants really has room for improvement, especially the 3 cans of jam compared with the Millennium Hotels in Taichung, Beijing and Hangzhou It's really much worse than...

It's just that this time I checked in on the 4th floor. I looked down at a tin house and looked ahead at the old apar**ent opposite where the balcony was full of clothes drying out. Standing inside the room and looking out, it feels like you are surrounded by an old community. This feeling is not very comfortable.
Also, I wonder if the freezer in the refrigerator is broken? Still don‚Äôt have this feature? The ice cream I bought turned into a puddle of water.

The price of extended stay has also increased. The key point was that they kicked us out of the hotel and refused to let us stay.

It is very close to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and it takes 20 minutes to walk to the headquarters of Xiamen University. This area is under construction for the subway, so this section of Siming South Road is particularly congested. It is recommended to walk to Xiamen University. It is an old-fashioned five-star hotel. I used to look up at this towering building when I was studying at Xiamen University and went shopping on Zhongshan Road. It is also fate to stay here now! Since it is an old hotel, the internal facilities and design are still a bit old, and the door of the bathroom is still an old wooden door, which is almost meaningless. The space of the room is not particularly large, but it is understandable in the island where every inch of land is expensive. Although it is called a sea view hotel, it is estimated that it can only be seen from certain directions on the top few floors. My window is the view of the old city. In any case, the transportation is very convenient, and it is considered clean. For this price, it is ok. If you want to live in a sea view room, I do not recommend this place.

It's also very convenient to go to the scenic spot from the hotel. You can go to Zhongshan Road when you come back at night. I really like this kind of hotel that can reach the scenic spot on foot.

It doesn‚Äôt match the expensive price, and the attitude of the waiters is mediocre and unenthusiastic. The configuration is particularly poor.

msg:The location of the hotel is right next to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, next to the China Town Shopping Center, and there are many restaurants and restaurants on the top floor. Going out of the hotel door, turn right for 4-500 meters is the seaside, and the opposite is about 500-1 kilometers away from Gulangyu Island. On the way to the beach, about 200 meters away, there is a nucleic acid point in Xiamen Women's and Children's Hospital, and the results are available in an average of three hours. The distance from the hotel to Shapowei is about 1.5 kilometers.

We booked a two night package at the hotel. Delighted to be upgraded to a deluxe room for another two days. The decoration of the room is high-end and elegant, and you can see the quality taste. The large bay window by the window is very useful, and it is very good to read and see the scenery outside the window. The room has a light colored carpet and is very clean. The bathroom is also very clean. The shower and bathtub are integrated on the hardware, there is no separate shower.

The most impressive and most comfortable is the service of the hotel. Check in was quick. Also received an exquisite small letter from the hotel. The front desk service is warm and scale, very comfortable. When I extended my stay, the front desk completely remembered me and was very warm. One morning the hotel was doing a routine fire alarm test, and by coincidence I had a conference call at the same time. The front desk of the hotel also helped me with special processing so that I would not be disturbed during the meeting.

There were not many guests in the hotel when we checked in. For breakfast, there is a noodle/rice noodle bar, as well as some typical breakfast foods such as hot dishes and porridge, steamed buns, bread and fruits. I personally feel that there are fewer options for protein other than eggs.

The gym is on the third floor of the hotel, you need to get off the elevator on the second floor and take the stairs to the third floor. The gym is full of space and has less aerobic equipment. It seems to have two treadmills and an elliptical machine (or a bicycle). There are quite a few weight-lifting equipment, but they are all a bit old. The barbell and plate are a little rusted.

Overall, this is a very satisfactory hotel. The price/performance ratio is very high. üëçüëçüëç

msg:We were very happy to escape from the cold Wuhan (relatively) to the warm Xiamen. We booked a five-star hotel in Wuhan the night before. But it was this hotel that cast a shadow on this trip. Fortunately, my wife was more cautious and only booked one night, otherwise it would be a big loss. I don't know how the industry defines what a luxury hotel is, but I think even with **'s eyes, this hotel cannot be defined as luxurious. The decoration in the guest room is old. The walls are old shit-yellow wallpaper, which is a bit cracked and peeling. There is also a musty and old smell in the room. Don't be confused by the smell of freshener in the lobby and corridor. The TV in the guest room looks like a product from 10 years ago. You must stand in the bathtub to shower, which is actually very unsafe and easy to slip. The shower head is also blocked for a little bit. Forget it. I spent 500 yuan a night and you gave me a plastic sheet to block it? After washing, the floor was full of water. The shampoo also smelled cheap and strange. And the wind speed of the hair dryer felt like an 80-year-old grandmother was blowing air with her mouth next to me. My short hair, which was almost a buzz cut, could not be dried in 10 minutes. My wife couldn't dry it at all. Even the cheap hotels out there wouldn't use such a hair dryer. And the mattress was a damn hard spring mattress, so hard that it hurt my waist. If I didn't turn over, there would be a creaking sound of the spring. I thought I slept on a hard bed, so you can imagine how cheap this mattress is. The quilt is also very old. After washing it again and again, it feels a bit like A4 paper. The service industry is very flexible everywhere. It's a wonder in the hotel industry that a store like yours can still be open. To be honest, this experience is really not as good as a cheap hotel.

Then I contacted the front desk to upgrade for 200 a night The room that claims to be able to see Gulangyu Island (actually can't see it), the environment is slightly better! But there are no toiletries in the room, the peephole is damaged, and the pillow can‚Äôt spring back after being pressed. After contacting the customer service, the 200 upgrade fee was refunded to me, but after this series of journeys, I was very upset at the beginning. I dragged my family to change it the next day.

During the check-in process, he also chatted with the colleagues next to him. Because the temporary order from Ctrip did not arrive at the hotel, he even asked me to pay a deposit of 3,500 yuan. There was a musty smell when I went up the corridor, and I came to a corner room. There was a 90-centimeter door in the aisle outside. It was blocked by a fire door next to it by 20 centimeters. Maybe the door was broken, so I replaced it with another door. Doors with completely different colors are considered to be a utility room. Is it because I have booked for three nights to be able to eat me? Arrange such a poor room. I really haven't seen a few guests. There is no shortage of housing. I thought the deposit of 3500 was very luxurious. When I got to the room, I was disappointed. The small window of the room was so simple that it couldn't be more simple. People who are insensitive to sleep like this can't fall asleep, and they can't do anything if they call the engineering staff after one o'clock in the morning, so they can only open another room for me to sleep. This is this so-called five-star hotel, the room rate is more than 900 per night, which is very poor! Fortunately, after checking in, I checked out the next two nights

It is close to the subway station and Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and is also close to the double-decker sightseeing bus station. There are many bus stops in China Town.
When booking the room, Ctrip also gave a large and 1 small lollipop tour ~ leisurely Gulangyu (including boat tickets) for a one-day tour. The route taken by Xiao Zhang's tour guide did not meet too many tourists. The attractions are very detailed and extended. Tu also helped to take pictures, which made the stay more worthwhile. I plan to take my family to Xiamen next time, I will still choose Millennium Hotel

Maybe the hotel business is too good. Fortunately, the lady at the front desk kindly gave me a free upgrade. After checking the room type, I came to the room and took a look. Wow, there is a PS5 game console. It turns out that this is an e-sports game room. Surprise! Tired of shopping, I just lay down in my room and played games, so cool, yyds
There are quite a lot of games in it, such as Uncharted 4, Tomb Raider 11, Biochemical 7, The Matrix 5, and 30 or 40 games. It is estimated that you can play for several nights.
The room is also very good, quiet and comfortable, clean and tidy, the view from the window is very good, you can see the hazy strait and the city in the distance.
The service is also very good, especially the little brothers and sisters at the front desk, who are warm and thoughtful, courteous, NICE

And the facilities are very old and low-end, and the gap is too big from the online promotion (a room of 480 yuan/room is not worth it, at best it is worth 200 yuan/room), and the bathroom does not even have a shower room, and people have to stand in the dirty The old and outdated bathtub can only be bathed by pulling the cloth on it. Even the tap water was yellow that day. I was speechless. It was too bad. I will never stay in this hotel when I come to Xiamen in the future! too poor!

It is worth mentioning that the location of the hotel is very good. Across the road is China Town.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very substandard. I arrived at the hotel at 10:00 p.m. on the 23rd to take a bath and prepare to go to bed. When I lifted the pillow, there was a long hair. Hurry up and call the waiter to change the whole set ‚òú‚òú You said how annoying it is that the waiter comes to change the sheets in the middle of the night, üò†üò†üò† Especially the pillow is very smelly, a smell of scalp, I especially hate the smell on the pillow.

Transportation: As soon as you go out, there is a subway station of Line 1, which is very convenient.

Environment: The lobby is more stylish, and it is a pedestrian street as soon as you leave the hotel. If you want to go to Vientiane City, take Line 1 for three stops. Very convenient.
Service: The service is average, not excellent, 60 points.

All in all, I still remember the 200 yuan a night digital hotel in Yiwu. The hotel is not only advanced and sanitary, but also has a variety of breakfast services. It pales in comparison to the 1,000-plus one-night hotel.

You can see the night view of Zhongshan Road from the window. The room is not very big but tidy and clean. The living is very comfortable. I would recommend it to friends. The small robot that gave the goods was cute, and it moved around when meeting someone

msg:A veteran five-star hotel, near Zhongshan Road, it is very convenient to go shopping and eat special products, and the subway at the door can go directly to the moving station. The room is very well decorated. You can see the night view of Zhongshan Road from the window. It is comfortable, spacious and quiet. It is no problem for a family of 4 people. The hotel staff is very patient and nice, and we were also cute by the room service delivery robot. The lobby bar with waterfall on the first floor is a good place to have coffee and chat ~ will come again!

You can go shopping and drink in China Town on the opposite side. The service staff is very friendly, warm and thoughtful, and the check-in efficiency at the front desk is high. The rooms are clean and tidy, the beds are comfortable, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry. Next time I come to Xiamen, I will stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to a friend.

The front desk watched my family of three with children staying in, and asked if I needed to change to a twin room, and suggested to me that the location of the twin room is better and quieter. I gladly accepted the front desk's suggestion for a twin room. See the details in the service, which is very satisfactory. The lobby bar environment is also very good, quiet in the noisy.

Although I only stayed for one day this time, I fully appreciate the convenience of the location! The hotel is adjacent to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and there is a tall shopping mall opposite the side entrance, which is invincible and convenient for shopping and eating.
2. The hotel room is comfortable and quiet, the staff are very nice, from the concierge to the front desk, the service is in place, especially the reception staff, very patient

The check-in brother at the front desk was very nice, the concierge was also very good, and the cleaning aunt was also very good.
However, there was no one to help pull luggage in and out of the hotel, and the service attitude of the consumer area behind the elevator was very poor. Some service staff in the hotel felt that they despised people and did not feel the five-star trea**ent.
But the young lady who called the day before check-in and asked what needs it was nice and met the needs.

The specially-designed barrier-free rooms have the bathtub in the bathroom, but there are a few more handrails around the basin and toilet. Such barrier-free facilities are really formalism, not considering the actual situation of the user at all! In this aspect of humanized facilities, we still have to learn more from peer foreign hotels. Many domestic hotels still have a big gap in this regard.
