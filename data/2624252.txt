msg:The duplex suite A I booked on New Year's Eve has three rooms but two bathrooms...and one of the rooms doesn't even have a trash can. I don't understand the design logic of the hotel. Of course, before I made the reservation, I knew there were only two bathrooms and I thought it was because there was not enough space. But after I went there, I found that there was space, but I didn‚Äôt plan to design three bathrooms. It‚Äôs not easy to book a room for three people in Gubei to spend the New Year together, so don‚Äôt ask for it. But I never expected that I would find out something even weirder when I actually lived there. The bathroom on the first floor and one of the rooms on the second floor were both weird. The floor drain of the room on the second floor did not seep. If I took a shower after two o'clock during the Chinese New Year, there would be accumulation on the floor. The water wouldn't leak out when it was full, and I didn't have the heart to call the waiter at that point. I told the room attendant early the next morning, and the attendant said, Oh! This floor drain is like this, just don't be anxious and wait for it to drain slowly. The co-author said, you know that there is a problem with this floor drain and you are still selling takeout instead of repairing it. It has been leaking all night and it has not been drained in the morning. Is it because you want to raise fish? Take it. The one on the first floor is also very strange. Not only does the water flow be very small to wash your hair, but you also have to stand in the bathtub. There is no shower, only a bathtub. Then, no paper towels were provided in any room. We had to call the waiter to give them to us. Other than that, there was no service at all. The TV on New Year's Eve was small and unclear, it felt like a 90's TV, but luckily we were able to entertain ourselves. The breakfast the next morning was in a very sunny room. I observed that most of the tables and chairs were exposed to the sun. It was really annoying to have breakfast. Talking about the most important thing about bathing, the hotel's private bathing pool is moldy, and the corridor in the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lobby is also full of mold. I don't care. This hotel may not plan to be a long-term hotel. This is our feeling during this trip. So, I really can‚Äôt give a good review, after all, it‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Eve.

msg:I checked into this hotel on December 20th. The whole hotel has a tatami style, and you need to take off your shoes in many areas. I think many guests will also walk barefoot. However, due to negligence in the hotel's cleaning and management, when I was walking barefoot on the tatami (straw mat) floor in the house that night, a tiny piece of glass that had not been cleaned was dug into my left heel, causing it to bleed.

Immediately, we notified the staff on duty to deal with it, and went to the park medical office for simple wound disinfection with iodophor. After I returned to my hotel around 1 a.m., the hotel offered to transfer me to the same room next door. However, what is unexpected is that after putting on new slippers, my friend was still injured by another tiny piece of glass. This was very surprising and unacceptable.

We asked the hotel to explain this bad situation. Until the morning of the 21st, three management employees came to the scene to negotiate. The latter two initially claimed to us that they could make a decision and give us an explanation. However, after many exchanges, the two parties could not reach an agreement. It was clear that the hotel was unwilling to sincerely admit its wrongdoing due to the unwarranted harm it caused its residents. Moreover, the last person complained to us that the higher-level managers were unwilling to come forward and would not accept the residents' demands. From the beginning to the end, we just need the hotel to give a sufficient attitude of admitting its mistake, because after paying to stay in this room with a price comparable to 5-stars, the residents cannot accept the principled hotel management negligence where the glass hurts people.

Just imagine how serious the accident would be if a child without judgment climbed on the tatami floor and was scratched by uncleaned glass shards, or swallowed unintentionally. Moreover, if a resident is punctured by other unknown foreign objects, will there be a risk of bacterial infection or infectious disease infection? And all of this happened in a high-end hotel known as the number one in Gubei Water Town, which is very scary to think about.

In addition, one of the reasons given by hotel managers is that each accommodation order can only be considered for appropriate deductions and exemptions, but it cannot be made into a loss-making order or exempted from the order, and the hotel cannot make decisions that harm the interests of shareholders. I would like to ask, if a situation harms the health of residents, which is more important, the interests of shareholders or the safety of residents? I cannot accept this reason.

As a resident, now that the incident has occurred, it cannot change the fact of physical injury, but what I need is a comprehensive, effective, and sincere apology from the responsible party, followed by compensation to the residents. What's more, after so much communication, the hotel still showed an insufficient attitude from the senior leadership. They only wanted to make a big issue a small matter through a little financial compensation. This kind of management and attitude makes an irresponsible hotel service company. People are very uncomfortable and unacceptable.

The above situation is for everyone's understanding. I sincerely hope that you will not encounter similar situations in your future travels, which will bring unhappiness to your originally relaxing journey.

Finally, I would like to thank the Ctrip staff for actively contacting, communicating and fighting for the interests of the residents during the above incidents, which made us feel that we have channels to seek help when encountering difficulties, and Ctrip can provide effective solutions. Ctrip is indeed a responsible and responsible company platform.

There was a round pool table similar to the kitchen. It was spacious, and the two children ran around freely. It was very relaxing to have a luxurious time occasionally. Although it was only one night, it was enough to go back to the city to continue moving bricks and rolling. The bathtubs were all L'Occitane, and the quality of the paper towels was OK. Bathrobes, slippers, and bottled water were all available. You don't have to think about bringing anything, which is very worry-free. The hot spring has two outdoor directions, and an indoor one is very convenient next to the hotel's own lobby. You can also go to the city, which is included in the room rate. The breakfast buffet + set meal is also very comprehensive. It saves worry and effort and is very enjoyable. The service is great.

msg:The room type has been upgraded. Although it is not as good as the Furo Hotel in Japan, it is still better. It is a localized Japanese-style hotel. The lamb chops are served with five-spice powder, which is a high-quality Xinjiang flavor. Outside the window, loudspeakers from the Great Wall Scenic Spot are broadcasting "Watch the scenery without walking, walk without watching the scenery" all day long, which is a bit noisy. I originally wanted to give it a five-star rating, but it was almost full on Friday night and only a small outdoor pool was opened, and the big one had no water. It's a bit crowded and noisy at night, and it doesn't have the tranquility of a Japanese private bath. It would be really nice to have a private bath in the room with an outdoor balcony. Unfortunately, the balcony is sealed, and the aluminum alloy door and window frames ruin the view of the Great Wall. Fortunately, the windows can be opened for ventilation, and the real bath must be outdoors. The service is quite warm. The aunt in the housekeeping depar**ent gave the children a perfect space for an extra bed, which was very considerate. The front desk also tried its best to help arrange a warm and quiet room. Thank you so much

msg:I have to complain about my stay at the Yushe Hotel and other feelings in Gubei Water Town this time.
1. Background: The Yushe Hotel, which is known as the No. 1 hotel in Gubei Water Town, has been decided. The price is 11850 for two days. More than 4000 a day and more than 7000 a day. (After the ambiguity happened later, Ctrip customer service asked me if I had seen the photo? How different is it from the photo? It‚Äôs ridiculous.) I saw the photo on the Internet and booked a Japanese room type. Because we are traveling as a family, I think this room type is more convenient.
2. After checking in, I arrived the day after. The hardware was found to be grossly out of line with the price. First of all, the decoration standard of the room is relatively low (because I have stayed in the Japanese-style room of Shanghai Peace Hotel, the price is cheaper than this), and the hot spring pool in the room is made of wood and looks very dark. The hair dryer is the kind that costs dozens of dollars on Taobao. There is only one bathroom in a room for four people, which is extremely inconvenient. The TV is just a decoration on the ground. The whole room is on the ba*****t floor, and only one window leads to a small courtyard that cannot go out. One of the two rooms where I stayed at night did not have a window, which was very suffocating.
3. The restaurants in the scenic area are very expensive. We ate a so-called Lu cuisine, which was actually a home-cooked dish. We spent 1,500 yuan and got nothing. This price is very good for eating in Beijing. It is estimated that this attraction will soon decline, and it can only be cheated once! It is recommended that friends in Beijing go back and forth on the same day, and friends from other places should be cautious.
4. I haven't commented on Ctrip for a long time, and I need photos. May I ask if a blind date can be successful just by looking at a photo, then there is also a *use of meeting. I hope that Ctrip's sales will also conduct on-site inspections. But later Ctrip replenished me and their income was quite satisfactory, but the hotel was really speechless.

Facilities: The integrated management of Gubei Water Town is in place. There is no pediatrician in the No. 1 parking lot.

As long as you stay in a hotel in the scenic area (or a fixed number of relatively large hotels, I don‚Äôt know if the small inn has this service), all shuttle buses are free. It was delivered to the door of the Yushe Hotel in five minutes, and was welcomed by someone. The service was warm and not overly enthusiastic. Someone sent it to the room. The location is at the innermost part of the scenic spot, very close to the entrance of the Simatai Great Wall, very quiet.

Ambience: The room is very, very large, out of the ordinary. Since I didn't book this hotel at the beginning, but due to some objective factors, the hotel I originally booked failed. Ctrip customer service contacted me and gave me a free upgrade to this hotel, and changed from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom duplex . Surprised and grateful, Ctrip is really rich. The hot spring water can be used as many times as you want, the water is very hot, and it is very comfortable to soak.

Hygiene: The hotel is designed in an all-Japanese style, the bathroom is very large, there are a lot of sinks, the hardware is in place, and the hygiene is also good. I didn't see anything unacceptable. The bedding is said to be good, and it is indeed soft.

Food: There will be fruit in the room, but the quality is emmm okay, four big apples + a bunch of grapes The hotel has its own restaurant, the environment is very good, the dishes are Japanese cuisine, there is Tomahawk steak, but it is too expensive and I dare not ask for it. . . The taste of sashimi is average. The breakfast is very good. There is a set meal, one for each person, and one for the baby. There is a self-service, and the variety is okay. It can be full. The breakfast siu mai is delicious.

Service: The service attitude is very good. When we leave the store, we will ask if we need a shuttle bus. The shuttle came in less than five minutes after the call was made. Luggage can also be checked in to No. 1 parking lot in advance. Super convenient.
In short, I am very satisfied with this store during this trip. Even my baby said that he didn't want to leave and stay another night.

Breakfast: Not bad, there are optional meals in addition to the set meal, not bad! It's just that the eggs in the steamed egg custard are very fishy and can't be eaten!

You can also take it with you... If you go to the hotel first and check in directly, you can take it with you! If you want to play in the ancient town first, it is recommended to transport your luggage first üß≥... The shuttle bus ride is at the entrance of the luggage storage office~ You only need to provide your check-in information to take the shuttle bus for free if you stay in a hotel in the water town! Drive to the tourist center at the entrance of the water town... After checking in at the center, you can transfer to the shuttle bus in the scenic area and sit at the entrance of the hotel ~ it is also a free ride for staying in the scenic area! The front desk is on the third floor... There are rooms on the second and third floors! There is a restaurant on the second floor to a hot spring on the third floor (reservations are required for the indoor and outdoor pools)! The first floor is in Tongshui Town... If you go to the ancient town to play, you can just go down to the first floor~ The hotel is very Japanese! There are two washrooms in the guest room... There is also a separate toilet and bathroom ~ the dining room and bedroom are connected! The living room (tea room) is separated from the bedroom by a door... the balcony door separates it from the living room~ The bathroom is amazing and too Japanese! There is a special place for shower üöø and a small bench... Go soak in the pool after taking a shower! Breakfast is a set meal ~ including ramen üçú ‚ûï tonkatsu ‚ûï custard ‚ûï 3 side dishes! There are also some buffets to choose from... I greeted the store in advance for my child's birthday ~ the store has decorated it a bit... very beautiful ~ I also gave cakes üç∞ ~ snacks and fruits! Thanks for the hard work in the store...a very good stay experience! But you have to check out before 12:00 noon ~ there is no extended service...it's not very friendly for people with children...but it's understandable! After all, the rooms are full these days... If you still need to play in the water town during the day, you can put your luggage in the hotel's luggage storage in the No. 1 parking lot... You can still take the shuttle bus with the check-in ticket! The kids had a great time on this trip~

The hot spring water is average, and the hot water is on the first floor, and the hot spring water is on the second floor. The independence of two families in hot springs is not good. The scenery on the second floor is very good. Make morning tea before getting up early and watch the sun rise and the view of the Great Wall is very beautiful. The hotel's Japanese breakfast set + buffet is very good, but I don't have time to go shopping inside the hotel. It's a pity that I didn't have time to appreciate the design landscape built on the mountain. The tatami mats on the first floor are suitable for traveling with babies, and you won‚Äôt have to worry about falling out of bed when you sleep. The bed on the second floor is just enough for big children. The dressing table, shower room, and toilet are all separate spaces, which are very friendly to women. The dressing table is long enough to hold all kinds of skin care cosmetics.

msg:The view is wide and you can see part of the Great Wall. The location of the hotel is relatively quiet, in the innermost part of the town. If you are walking around, go downstairs from the elevator, and it is more convenient to enter and exit through the door of the Japanese restaurant.
The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not good. You can hear the conversation next door. The sound insulation of my duplex suite is not good. The bedroom downstairs has a Japanese-style sliding door, which is actually just a layer of paper. The master bedroom upstairs is also a Japanese-style sliding door, which is also a layer of paper. Upstairs and downstairs swiping mobile phones can hear each other. Living as a family, young people go to bed late, while old people get up early, influencing each other.
There are a bunch of cups, saucers, and plates for breakfast. It looks lively, but it can only be said to be edible, not good. At least it doesn't match the room rate of more than 5,000.

Although the facilities are not too new, they are clean and comfortable, creating a cozy feeling of relaxing at home, a good experience. The hot spring is also very good. The water in the small pool is very hot and needs to be set aside to dry for a while. It is very close to the cableway entrance of the Great Wall, and it is very close to the town block when going out from the back door.

Downstairs there is a bathroom with a bathtub and a double tatami. The second floor is very large, with a bathroom with a shower room and a big bed room. The living room is large with a double tatami. In addition, there is a small wooden barrel of private soup on the second floor, which can be used for unlimited hot springs 24 hours a day. There are 8 rooms of this type in the entire hotel, all on the 3rd floor. The lobby of the hotel is on the third floor. Breakfast is on the second floor, which is a set meal + self-service mode. The food in the set meal can also be ordered again and again indefinitely. There is an indoor hot spring pool and 2 outdoor hot spring pools on the third floor of the hotel. The outdoor hot spring can see the Simatai Great Wall not far away. The overall feeling of the hotel is good. Our housekeeper, Mr. Wang Liwei, was very attentive and enthusiastic and gave us a lot of help. The hotel also provides fruit and flower cakes and grapefruit tea for in-house guests.

1. This room is simply the lowest cost-effective room, with the same size and settings as a double room
2. The room is on the first floor. After the elevator goes up to the second floor, you need to take long stairs to go downstairs. It is very inconvenient for the elderly and babies
3. It is equivalent to adding a partition and a mattress to the living room of the double room to become a quadruple room, and the layout is unreasonable
4. There is only one bathroom and toilet, so it will definitely be cramped if four people stay
5. Sound insulation is poor
6. Breakfast is still at the level of a four-star fast chain
7. About one hour after this booking (booked on the same day and already departed), the scenic spot notified that üêë visited the day before yesterday and some hotels were still in quarantine. There was no reminder or notification when booking
8. The scenic spot called at 10 o'clock the next morning and said that there might be visitors from the hotel, and asked to check out as soon as possible or they might be quarantined
9. The hotel does not have any apologies or compensation measures for the two points on July and August... It is recommended that the food during the epidemic should not be too ugly... It is not right for a hotel with more than 4,000 rooms per night

After reading a lot of reviews, it is better to experience it yourself!
After careful consideration of many hotels and B&Bs, we finally decided on the Imperial House. It is not very suitable for staying with a 2-year-old baby! The tatami room is free to play without bumping into it! The room is clean and tidy, and you can enter Japan in a second! The details of the room are handled very well! The thoughtful service of the housekeeper, Miss Xu Qian, makes this trip even more warm! I have customized a play route, and if there is anything, I will find her to solve it in minutes! Be meticulous and considerate~
For my mother's birthday, I told her temporarily that I dressed up in the morning and prepared a cake üòò When I left, I took pictures and washed them out for souvenirs!
All the staff in the hotel are very nice and friendly! There is a soup pool in the hotel room, and the hotel also has a public hot spring‚ô®, one large indoor and two small outdoor ones. It feels very good to watch the Great Wall at night. There are showers and saunas when you come out. Detailsüëçüèª The hotel also has a gym and a baby play room. I didn't have time to play. Next time I come to see the red leaves and let the baby play.
The breakfast in the restaurant is set meal‚ûïSemi-buffet, Japanese style‚ûïChinese and Western style, exquisite and deliciousüòã
The hotel is in the innermost part of the ancient town, so it is best to play from the inside out! The hotel is very close to the water dance show and not far from the drone show. The price of the hotel is mid-to-high-end, and the service is affordable. The Japanese food in the restaurant tastes good. The teppanyaki is famous, and it is also very close to the barbecue restaurant! Must eat ü§ôüèª
In general, Gubei is usually very good, the prices are high on holidays and there are too many people, and there are many people in the ancient town, but it is very comfortable!
By the way, the ancient town has free luggage storage and free check-in, a highlight, it is really convenientüëçüèª

The hotel is in the innermost part of the water town. You can check in your luggage in the p1 parking lot. You don't need to carry big bags and small bags. You can play directly when you arrive~
The shuttle bus can go directly to the entrance of the hotel, and the hotel can also help you to call the ferry. It is very convenient to travel in a few minutes. It is only three or five minutes away from the hotel if you turn right and go to the Great Wall~
Each room has a private soup, and there is also a public soup pool on the first floor of the hotel, which can only be used by hotel guests, so there are not many people in a good environment!
This season the hotel has turned on the air conditioner, so it is not cold at all. Very friendly to children, the tatami is not afraid of falling off the bed ~ the super large space of more than 100 square meters, the beasts running around the house are really not too happy ~ and the sukiyaki pot in the hotel restaurant tastes good

I have been there many times before, this is the first time I stayed at the Royal House Boutique Hotel, and I am very satisfied! We chose the deluxe family room, the big four and one small stay in Japanese style. First of all, the hotel is very clean. In addition, the hot spring in the hotel is the best and most comfortable. The outdoor hot spring can directly see the Simatai Great Wall. view. Especially the waiter Yang Xiujuan of the restaurant deserves to be commended. When she learned that her child was celebrating her birthday, she took the initiative to send birthday noodles, took the initiative to take a family photo, and printed it out for us. The service was enthusiastic and thoughtful. If you come next time, you will stay here!

The hotel is very spacious, with a sense of overall design, and privacy is also very good. Except that there are a lot of people during the breakfast time, there are basically no other tourists, but the room is actually full. It is rare in Gubei during the peak season. take quiet~
This time I live in Duplex B. The two live upstairs and downstairs respectively. Both floors have separate toilets, showers and private soup pools, which can separate the living areas very well~ There is a living room downstairs and a living room upstairs. Facing the small balcony of the Great Wall, if you don't want to go out and join in the fun, you can stay on it and watch the scenery~
Finally, I have to mention that the bedding in his house is very comfortable, which is very suitable for relaxing on vacation!

What's more disappointing is that the hotel's own hot spring is very small, and the two small pools outside are not hot. The breakfast did not take the initiative to tell whether it is a ration for one person or it can be added. One tray per person, just a little of everything in it. Don't get your hopes up in the gym, there's basically nothing. The service staff are quite enthusiastic, take the initiative to say hello, and provide service faster than that. The hotels and inns in the entire scenic area should be operated uniformly by the scenic area, but the positioning and pricing are different, so they are similar.

msg:Temporarily decided to go to Gubei Water Town to play before school starts. I have two children and one is considered an adult. I can only choose the family room. In the end, I chose this place in Hangu and Yushe. The room is larger, although the price is nearly double the price. . To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I first came in. The two floors of the room are very spacious. There is a big bed upstairs and tatami mats downstairs. There are enough bathrooms and there are hot spring pools up and down. The closed balcony upstairs can see the Great Wall cableway, but the lighting of the room It's really bad, maybe it's a problem with the layout of the hotel. The first floor is outside the atrium, so the curtains are always drawn, so the first floor basically relies on lights, and the light is still relatively dark. On the second floor, some balconies and tea tables are brighter, and the view from a distance It's good, but the roof is nearby, and the bedrooms upstairs and downstairs are all close to the inside, which is equivalent to no windows. In short, except for the balcony on the second floor, the room is very dark. Although the space is large, I am really sorry for the price. It feels like a flaw in the design. Tucao here, I am quite satisfied with everything else, the room decoration feels relatively new, there are not many optional things for breakfast, but the set meal is very rich, basically it is in a state of eating, the Japanese food looks good but I have no experience. I ran in the hot spring in the room at night and soaked in the outdoor pool the next morning. Maybe everyone went out to visit our reserved venue. This should be a highlight of this trip. The two outdoor pools looked at the Great Wall and soaked in it, too There are also umbrellas for sunbathing, which is so comfortable, and finally had to leave because I had to check out. The location of the hotel is close to the Great Wall. After checking out, I took my children to climb the Great Wall. It's not too far to walk to the town. Luggage can be checked in from the parking lot, which is quite convenient.

msg:Stayed for two nights. The hotel is still in Gubeizhiguang, and the battery car in the scenic spot will be delivered to the door. Japanese style, the facade is very inconspicuous. The lobby is small and concise, on the third floor according to the hotel mark. From the elevator down to the guest room area on the second floor, there is something unique. The guest rooms are distributed in a zigzag shape around the central courtyard. But we need to complain a little. Our room of the same room type needs to go down a dozen or more steps that are a little steep (see Figure 1). If the child is too small, the weight is too heavy, and the legs and feet are inconvenient, it is better not to choose this room type. It is recommended that the hotel arrange special personnel to assist the guests with luggage, so as to increase the favorability of the hotel and improve the service level. The room is big enough, just entered the room, the tatami smell is obvious. The room is clean and tidy, and the facilities are relatively new. The four parts of the bedroom with bed, tatami bedroom, small living room and balcony with view are separated by Japanese sliding doors. The private soup is not big, enough for two people. Because of the use of wood material, it is inevitable that some places cannot be cleaned particularly cleanly, which makes people feel unsanitary, which is a common problem of wooden soup pools. The bed is more comfortable (personally, tatami is better), and I slept more heavily for two nights (maybe because of the hot spring). There is indeed only one toilet, one shower, and three sinks in the whole house. Small refreshments, fruit and a pot of honey citron tea are served every afternoon in the hotel. Delicate and fresh, especially the tea is delicious, drink it after soaking in soup, warm and comfortable. The hotel's air conditioner was cold, and we all slept at night. Speaking of breakfast, in the hotel's Royal House and Valley Cuisine Restaurant, although the set menu is mainly nine palaces, there are still some changes every day, plus yogurt, drinks, porridge, custard, steamed buns, small pickles, and fruits can be self-supplied, especially fruits. It's fresh, and it looks like it's done with care. The night I arrived, I was a little tired and ate at this restaurant. It's a bit unexpected (I don't know why the score on the review is very low), there are not many choices, the set menu tastes okay, and the spicy conch and noodles with single addition are also very good. It can be seen that the restaurant is trying to improve the service and cooking standards to make up for the restrictions on ingredients. The hotel's own hot spring is not open to the public, and it needs to be reserved on the applet. Next to the lobby, it is not big, with one large indoor pool and two outdoor small pools. There are not many people. Go after the sun goes down, it will not be too hot, and you can see the night view of the Great Wall outside.

It is a bit like the sound of adjusting the air conditioner switch next door. It is the sound of the wind blowing on the glass, which may affect people who sleep lightly. In addition, the sound insulation of the room is not very good. If someone passes by the door in the morning, the sound is quite clear. Others are very satisfied!

The hotel rooms were quite big, all of them were more than 100 square meters. It was very comfortable to live in. I ordered a sushi pot package. There are not many people in the hot springs, so I booked a pool with my friends hh

To satisfy these, come to Gubei Water Town Royal House Boutique Hotel. During the epidemic period, it will be open from time to time, so please consult in advance to make a reservation. The breakfast was delivered to the room, which was very rich. There was no inconvenience except that I couldn't dine in. The town staff member Zhang Ling was very considerate. She informed me of the route and parking location in advance, personally greeted me and took my luggage, and even helped me order food and deliver it to my room. Full of memories, great experience!

Because there were fewer people in the epidemic and during the May Day period, all the games that could be played were finished in half a day, so staying for one night was completely enough. It is very good to have such a game without being in Beijing. I will come back next time when the dine-in and performances resume~

The fly in the oin**ent, the indoor wooden bathtub is poorly maintained, the hygiene is not good, and the wood is rotten.

Although repairs were carried out the next day and fruit was sent, I was still not very happy. After all, as a hotel with a price of more than 4,000 a night, it still affects the mood and the experience of staying.

Although the flaws are not concealed, I still hope to be perfect.

I said it was too late to go out to buy food. I asked if we could send some cake or food to the room. We could pay for it, but it turned out that it was not available. In the end, the four-year-old child could only eat cup noodles for dinner, and the adults were hungry. , decided to change hotel that night, it was definitely not worth the price of more than 2,000 per night.

There were not many guests on the day we went, so you can enter the hot spring without making an appoin**ent. At first, I was worried that the outdoor hot spring was not hot enough when I read the reviews. Later, I found that as long as guests entered, the hot spring water would start to heat up. The hot springs are really cool.
The rooms are well set up and there are hardly any noise problems. The internal bathroom of the guest room is scientifically designed, and the toilet and washing areas are separated and completely unaffected. The private soup bath area is also very comfortable. I just don't know if it's because the winter is over and the heated towel rack in the bathroom can't be used.
Hotel food service is a failure. Originally, the breakfast also took the Japanese route, and it was delivered to the room during the epidemic. When I checked in, I explained to the hotel in advance that I wanted one vegan breakfast, and the other had a normal breakfast. When it was delivered the next morning, it seemed that the breakfast was very rich at first glance. When I looked closely, the vegan breakfast was replaced with seafood and meat. Stir-fried vegetables and mushrooms, fried rape, nondescript and creative, completely sorry for the price. Then there is seafood in the egg custard, meat floss in the rice ball, and the cream of the cake is not known whether it is animal cream. The chef has some misunderstanding about vegetarianism. . .
To sum up, except for the food, everything else is very good, the food service is too bad

msg:During the Chinese New Year, Gubei Water Town feels the taste of the New Year. The hotel booked two months in advance mainly sees that the area is large enough to accommodate many people, and the room can be soaked in private soup.
Let‚Äôs talk about parking first, it‚Äôs best to park in the No. 1 parking lot, and then you can check your luggage at the luggage check-in place, and you can send it directly to the hotel room, and then take the shuttle bus to the tourist reception center, check in and enter the park.
The hotel room, the duplex room I booked, is unexpectedly spacious. The duplex stairs are wide enough for the elderly to go up and down without difficulty. There are toilets and private soup pools upstairs and downstairs. Going to the Simatai Great Wall, sitting and drinking a cup of tea or coffee, in a daze, it is very pleasant.
The hotel services are not bad, but they are not overly enthusiastic, but they are responsive. Fruit plates are delivered every morning, and snacks and hot drinks are delivered in the afternoon. The hot drinks are grapefruit-flavored, which is particularly comfortable to drink in winter.
In terms of food and beverages, because I have breakfast, I don‚Äôt have the right to speak. As far as breakfast is concerned, it is slightly average. The package is added in a semi-self-service form. If you can eat enough, you may not eat well. If it is not enough, the breakfast needs to be improved. Only the main dish should be replaced with other things. In addition, the noodles are too soft, the soup is too bland and tasteless, and the sushi tastes average.
The location of the hotel, the ticket office of Simatai Great Wall is right out the door. It is very convenient to climb the Great Wall by cable car. In the other direction, go to Wangjing Street to watch the fountain light show and walk for about five minutes. It is very convenient. Bar,
The overall recommended hotel, service, room and location are all good, of course not because the scenery is better in summer during the Chinese New Year.

msg:Gubei Water Town to take advantage of the Spring Festival holiday. The duplex private soup suite B. There are two bedrooms upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs is a Japanese-style room, a Japanese-style tatami living room, and a Japanese-style tatami bedroom. Comes with a Japanese-style bathroom with a wooden bathtub (not hot spring water), and then an additional normal toilet + shower room. The upstairs is a half-Japanese style, the living room is a tatami + stool, and the bedroom is a Simmons bed. Then the wooden bathtub upstairs comes out of the hot spring, the shower room is ordinary bath water, and there is also a toilet upstairs.
Let's talk about the advantages: the hotel style is in place, because I have been to Japan many times, so I know what Japanese style should be. Including the hotel's floor heating, the floor heating is specially paved for the tatami on the first floor. It's really hot~~ I sweat without a quilt in the winter. The hotel's breakfast is also a standard Japanese breakfast. It provides a Japanese breakfast corresponding to the occupants, and there are some buffet meals on site. At the beginning, I didn't know that each person had one, and I wondered why such an expensive hotel has so few types of breakfast~~~
The private hot spring in the room is very comfortable, and the duplex villa fully considers the characteristics that children cannot soak in the hot spring. The bathtub is one out of the hot spring and one out of the ordinary bath water. The hotel has a shuttle bus, and it is very convenient to travel to and from the water town.
In addition, the hotel is in the innermost part of the water town, which is very quiet. It is only 50 meters away from the entrance of the Simatai Great Wall Scenic Spot (walking & cableway entrance). It is very convenient to climb the Great Wall. In addition, the hotel will send tickets to Gubei Water Town.
Talk about the shortcomings: mainly in the details. The fee is more than 4900 yuan per night, and at least 4 adults' rooms were accommodated. A total of 8 small bottles of water were given. I asked the front desk for water, and I specifically told me that I could only deliver it for free again, and then I would have to pay for it...and then I delivered it again. 4 bottles...In an instant, our family often travels with children, and we basically choose luxury hotels when we go out. It is rare to encounter so many people who stay in such a small amount of water. If you ask the front desk, you will specifically emphasize the charges... InterContinental and Marriott's hotels around the world, Bay Mid-Levels, Nuojin, Shanghai Disney, etc. have stayed in, usually double rooms 6 bottle configuration. If you ask the front desk for water, people will take the initiative to ask how many bottles of water they need to make up. It‚Äôs the first time that a luxury hotel sends a few bottles of water.
There is also breakfast. No one in the restaurant reminded them to provide a Japanese breakfast for each person. Because they had to climb the Great Wall during the day, they were afraid that the children would be picky and not get enough to eat. They kept telling her that there was only so much breakfast, and you could only eat rolls or bread. At least 2 or 3 waiters next to us were surprised that no one told us that there was an extra breakfast for one person, which led us to take a lot of bread and found that the real breakfast was coming... In the end, we tried to stuff it inside, did we go to Japan before? Most hotels provide this kind of breakfast for one person, and they will tell you when they enter the restaurant, so that it is convenient for guests to take meals in the self-service area in moderation... And in the end, there are two leftover breads that can't be stuffed in. Now, in order to not waste it, ask the waiter if you can take it out of the restaurant, and also emphasize to us that you can't take it, but you can take it... like InterContinental or Marriott, especially Nuojin, unless you are taking your life to take it away Yes, otherwise there is one or two bread left, and we basically let them take them. We once got up early in the intercontinental road in Lijiang, and we just fooled two people and left. The waiter took the initiative to pack two cakes for the children to eat. I just want to say that since it is a luxury hotel, I should pay attention to such details... I spent the money of a luxury hotel to experience the service of a business hotel, what am I planning...
The other is the hygiene of the bathroom, which needs to be further improved.
The last thing to say is that most Japanese-style hotels have poor sound insulation. If there are families who are particularly concerned about sound insulation, it is best to choose a single room instead of a multi-bedroom suite.

It's not very good. The bathroom is really cold. The breakfast is for four adults in the suite, but we only have two adults, one child over 1.2 meters, and two children under 1.2 meters. We only serve three adults and two children. I don't say that it will be later. If you can't eat, tell her that it won't be served. We didn't say that we couldn't wait until we left. We didn't give it. We didn't ask if we couldn't. One of the male guests just asked her when the temporarily changed steak meal was on the table, and saw that the waiter remembered that the steak meal was also crossed out in the book, so hehehe, in order not to affect the mood, I was too lazy to tell the waiter that people are good and being bullied. This is it! Other than that, everything else is very good. The two little smiling faces that are poor are given to the service staff in the restaurant.

The outdoor hot spring could overlook the illuminated Simatai Great Wall without blind spots.

But objectively the rights and interests have been lost, and you think the hotel will make up for it from other places. But no, not at all. Even the other services are nothing special, not at all like this class of hotel. One star is deducted for this.
Let's take a look at the photo with one star. There is a set for breakfast, in addition to some buffets. As a hotel of this class, the sushi buffet turned out to be ham and cucumber *****s. I really can only use two words to describe it. Why are you embarrassed to swing out?

msg:A hotel that has been growing grass for a long time, but since I have been to Gubei many times, I haven't booked it for a long time. Due to the outbreak of the epidemic in Changping, the gathering of friends was temporarily changed from a small soup to this place. It seems that it is also very destined.
I had booked a suite for 4 people in the early stage, and I called on Friday to confirm the hot spring matters. As a result, I was notified that all indoor and outdoor hot springs would be closed on Saturday night, which is really bad news. Discuss with the hotel and upgrade to a duplex suite.
[Duck] Room Facilities:
The decoration is simple and the room is spacious for the four of us. For the ladies, the spacious vanity mirror is really proud, and there are 2-3 sinks on each floor, which is super convenient.
The first floor is tatami mats, the living room is very suitable for chatting, a laptop is placed on a small table, it is very good to sit down and work. (But it‚Äôs a holiday) There is a private hot spring pool on the first floor, which is also relatively large, but the hotel said it is not a hot spring, but only warm water, so we did not take a bath.
The second floor is more spacious, and my favorite is the balcony, as well as a small living room and coffee bar. Exactly 4 locations, there are free capsule coffee (4), friends drink tea and chat, very comfortable. It can be said that two more days will not be enough. The bubble pool on the second floor is slightly smaller and only suitable for two people.

[Candy] Breakfast:
Breakfast is delivered to the room, with many styles, much like a Japanese hotel. The taste is also good, there is very little of everything, but the edible is very supportive. Like salad or something, you can add it if you need it. I feel that the nutrition is also very rich.
Tucao about the ingredients for breakfast, the main course only has chicken and dragon fish to choose from, which is really speechless. The price of the hotel is not cheap, all the ingredients are cheap in the market, and there is no pork, so I will settle the bill.

[Naughty] Service:
There were not many guests in the hotel when we checked in. It is said that there were only 5 or 6 guests in the room. It actually feels like fewer people going in and out. But when I called the front desk, it was not very timely to get things. The service is also quite satisfactory, with no special highlights and intentions.

The overall situation is quite good. During the working days during the epidemic, the hotel also upgraded the room types. Many price concessions. However, it feels a bit more expensive if you take your family on weekends, and the room type is not particularly suitable.
But this room type is very suitable for friends like us to travel. I hope to have the opportunity to experience the outdoor signature hot spring.

The environment is okay, remember to tell the registration front desk to move forward as much as possible, we can't see other people but it is not very convenient for the room to be the innermost and the next floor.
üîîService: The front desk is still welcoming, the outdoor hot spring scenery is good, and there are usually few people visiting

The breakfast delivered is as shown in the picture, which is okay.


If you want to go to the next floor of the fountain music show and go out directly for 5 minutes, it is more convenient to take a car when you go out and walk to the gate. In addition, the triple room has a set of wash (trial size) even if it is a high-end shower gel. It‚Äôs not enough to take a shower in the morning. Fortunately, I‚Äôll give it right away, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll give a bad review if I‚Äôm embarrassed.

It is suitable for three-generation family trips or multiple parent-child trips; The outdoor hot spring was barely, not big, but it was OK. There were no other guests when we went, and it was basically a reserved place. The children had a great time; parking at the Water Town Hotel, luggage checking, inspection of the town‚Äôs ticket purchase and reminders of precautions, The hotel Xiao Zhu (Ubabaa) was warm and thoughtful at the reception, explaining current affairs in every detail, patiently and gentle while waiting, praise, and also showed the hotel's service level and staff training quality.

It was basically quiet, but the door was a bit thin and soundproofed. Someone outside could hear it. The breakfast is a Japanese buffet, there are not many varieties, and it is enough, and the taste is not bad. The hotel's hot springs are quite good and the temperature is relatively high. The hotel is in the innermost part of the water town, very close to the Simatai Great Wall and the fountain show. It is suitable for a night tour of Simatai. It will be quieter overall, and the relatively lively market is a bit far away. It depends on personal preference.

msg:It is very convenient to drive to the parking lot No. 1, check in the luggage and take the battery car to the service hall to check in.

In contrast, it takes a long time to wait for the battery car after checking out, because most hotels cannot extend check-out at 12 noon. It is very crowded. When people arrive at the parking lot, they have to wait for half a day for luggage. 12 noon is the hottest day and the least crowded. I really don‚Äôt want to wander around in the water town, but this is a water town problem. The front desk of the hotel actively adjusts the car according to the check-out order and informs everyone in order, which is great.

The hotel has a good environment, large rooms, good view, and very quiet. The hot spring has indoor and outdoor facilities. It is only for guests of the Royal House and Wanghai Tower. It is convenient to go directly with a bathrobe. Room cleaning services are ok, the number of bedding is high, remind me that tatami mats are a bit uncomfortable to climb up and lie down, private soup wooden barrels have a bit of smell, people with sensitive smell may mind.

Breakfast buffet, dinner is a fixed meal, usually the dinner is settled outside.

What can be improved, each room is given a piece of fruit and a piece of biscuits. It was a good intention, but first, the two items were delivered twice separately, and then the waiter knocked on the door when they were delivered. Whether it was taking a bath or resting in the room, both I had to go down to the first floor to open the door. The experience was a bit poor, so I refused the biscuits decisively on the second day.
I ordered ice cream while soaking in the hot spring and ordered two glasses of white water. I can‚Äôt laugh or cry, the table is a few meters away from the bar, so I just bring it over. There are few people considering hot springs, and they are prone to lack of water. This service can be a little more considerate~

msg:The suite was booked for two consecutive nights, and the room was very large. But the price of the benchmark 6000 is still too far behind. First of all, the wooden bathtub in the room had a peculiar smell, so I gave up soaking in the room and spent the first day peacefully. Unexpectedly, when I went into the outdoor hot spring pool the next night, I felt the smell of bleach and disinfectant which was a huge choking nose, and the smell of disinfectant still persisted after the shower. I could only spend the night smelling the disinfectant water. In the morning, both the adult and the two children had skin allergies at the same time. When I asked about the hotel, the only reply was that our hot spring was no problem. Regardless of our feedback, the only answer to the hotel is that our hotel is no problem. I'm really speechless, do we still have something out of nothing? Really the worst experience in a high-end hotel. Will not live again.

msg:I wanted to stay happily for one night, but the hotel was really terrible! At around two o'clock in the afternoon, I took my family and children to the hotel front desk to book a room. The front desk also saw a few-month-old baby checking in with us, and gave us room 218. I will never forget this number in my life! The room was at the very back of the hotel, and I walked for a long time. I thought maybe the front desk saw the baby and found a quieter place, so I didn‚Äôt think much about it, so I just walked a few more steps! A hotel experience that costs more than 5,000 yuan per person per night: I put down my luggage and went out for a walk. After dinner and sightseeing, I arrived at the hotel room at around 9 o'clock. I don't know if it was a bar or something nearby but it was very close! The sound continued until about 11:30 in the middle of the night, and the room felt trembling at the maximum volume. I would simply say that the current experience of the room is very noisy, very humid, and the room design is very uncomfortable! I don‚Äôt want to say anything about this now. I just want to talk about the attitude of the hotel service staff. For three consecutive days, Ctrip contacted me for a solution. On the fourth day, the hotel called me! The attitude was extremely bad and he said: There is nothing we can do, we are just a hotel and resort with performances, and we can‚Äôt change it! Why didn't you warn us that the room was noisy even though we were checking in with our baby? Then there was a beeping sound on the other side of the phone. I didn‚Äôt know what it was doing. I said: Are you still there? The hotel staff replied impatiently: There is nothing we can do about this! This is the inquiry call made by the hotel staff at around nine o'clock in the morning. I was about to ask for her job number or name, but she hung up on me! I'm so angry! Let‚Äôs not talk about the hotel check-in experience, but let‚Äôs talk about the attitude of the staff! So awesome! You are just on a small vacation. If you were on a bigger vacation, would you go to heaven? Staff training training! oh! Yes, he also said that he would let me book a duplex room for more than 7,000 a night next time! That's quieter! Oh my God! Is there a next time? Is there a next time possible? We were so angry that we left right after checking out! I no longer have the heart to climb the Great Wall, I just want to leave this awesome place as soon as possible! ! ! This review is absolutely true! Can bear legal responsibility! ! !

We called the front desk, and a waiter came and picked up the centipede. He said something apologetic and didn't do anything more. He just explained that the humid environment of the private soup might attract centipedes...
This experience was so unpleasant at the end of the trip. What's even more disappointing is that such an expensive luxury hotel has no plan or follow-up solution. Just a few words of apology and a free pair of disposable slippers for the child? ! ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs hard to feel professional and sincere.
We came here with a family, including a three-year-old child and a seventy-year-old man. We don‚Äôt know what will happen if we are bitten while sleeping!
I hope the hotel management will take a good look at this review and give us a satisfactory answer!
