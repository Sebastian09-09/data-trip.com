msg:The hotel was rebuilt from an ancient house with a history of more than 100 years. If you insist on perfect hardware facilities, it is indeed a bit difficult. The room is not well maintained, dust can be seen everywhere, and the sound insulation effect is not required, but the light leakage of the curtains will definitely affect the quality of sleep. There is only one five-hole bedside socket. The two-hole bedside lamp is plugged in, leaving only one three-hole. You must know that mobile phones are basically two-hole plugs now, so you can only unplug the lamp. In the end, the socket is still loose and can't be used. You can only charge it by the pool. For service, my requirements have never been too high. I can feel that the customer service wants to provide good service, but it's just a little bit short. The location of the house is absolutely OK. It is on Nanchang Street, hidden in the city, quiet in the bustle, and the cultural heritage is also very deep. To put it in a tacky way, the room fee of 1,680 per night is to pay for the hotel's heritage. As for hardware and service, it is definitely not worth it.

msg:The designer hotel is located in an old house. The style of the old house is well preserved. You can feel a lot of ancient style when you enter the door and go upstairs.
The room is not big, but it is well decorated and comfortable. But if you look closely at the facilities, you can feel the consideration of cost control during the decoration.
The restaurant is great! There are only two breakfast sets, wonton and noodles, and the taste is quite traditional, which is well received.
The location of the hotel is not easy to find. You can't take a taxi directly. The front desk will contact you in advance. After all, you have to drag your luggage for a while. However, this location on Nanchang Street is excellent, quiet in the bustling city, and it is very suitable as a starting point for city walk after checking in.
But overall, the room price of 1.2k+ is a bit high for the experience. If the price can be more reasonable, such as around 800-900, it is actually perfect.

The breakfast was too simple and there was not much to eat. At this price, the breakfast in a hotel should be rich. After checking out, I still had some time to go to the high-speed rail station. I originally wanted to take a rest in the breakfast area, but I was told that the air conditioner was not turned on and I felt that the hardware was still a little weak. I won't choose a place like this again at this price.

msg:Highly not recommended! Very poor accommodation experience!
The intuitive feeling is that the farmhouse configuration is priced at the price of a boutique B&B.
Very poor value for money. The room was small, the bathroom was smelly, and there were no anti-slip mats or slippers in the shower room.
On an ordinary weekend that is not a winter or summer vacation, a family room of more than 1,500 people looks like this: a large room, divided into two areas with hollow partitions, one is the bedroom, in the form of a tatami, with two mattresses on the floor, and a simple Coffee table, two futons, and a bedside table for each bed - because the space is too small to fit two bedside tables, then this area is full, and the sides of the bed are very crowded; the other area is the hall, washbasin, and shower Room and bathroom, yes, the washbasin is outside the bathroom, because the bathroom can fit a toilet. The lobby is also very crowded, the table is small, and it is very cramped to put luggage, and the boarding suitcase can just be spread out.
Moreover, this room only has a small window that cannot be opened. Outside is a dusty rooftop platform, and the window glass is also gray.
It's just a twin room, and it's actually called a family room.
Besides, the public area of ​​the hotel is also very average. There are some bonsai decorations. It is very cramped and there is nothing interesting to see.
This is the worst B&B experience I have ever had!

Facilities: I am dissatisfied with the design of the hotel's bathroom. Although wet and dry are separated, there are no doors or shields outside the toilet and shower room. The shower room is small and you cannot put clean clothes in because it will get wet. The floor in the bathroom will be very wet after taking a shower, and it will be inconvenient to put on clothes. However, since the living room and bed are just outside the bathroom, there is no partition at all, and you cannot go out to get dressed, so it is very inconvenient.
Food: The hotel will provide a simple breakfast, which tastes good.
Service: Since the room is on the second floor, there is no elevator but stairs, and the service staff did not take the initiative to help carry luggage upstairs. It will be more inconvenient if you have large luggage.
Overall, the price/performance ratio is low.

一座老宅子的改建的酒店，比較清凈，在熙熙攘攘的南長街上，有點桃園的感覺。

房間的陽台很寬敞，坐在陽台上喝喝茶，聊聊天很不錯。客房內有衞洗麗，還不錯。

提前一天，工作人員會發來具體停車庫的定位和配圖。停車庫離酒店大概五十米的距離，還是很方便的。

早餐比較簡單，有點麪包牛奶之類的自助，定食是麪或者餛飩，配上一點雜糧小菜，能吃飽。

和朋友一起去的，朋友覺得客房枕頭不是最滿意，希望能多備着些不用的卧具方便不同的住客。

首先，酒店的地理位置很好，作為南長街的商鋪之一，還有可能被遊客誤認為是博物館，走進去瞧瞧😂打車到南長街走兩步路就到，晚上感受一下南長街的夜生活，可以美美走回酒店。
酒店的設計風格也融合了無錫南長街的建築風格，主打一個江南小院古色古香，房間裝修又有一種日式庭院的感覺。
酒店的環境、服務、衞生都是一流的，鬧中取靜，主打一個小而精。一個房間有兩個門，一個門直通小院，八個房間圍繞一間小院子，有種四合院的感覺。如果是好幾個朋友一起來，相信體驗感會很棒，因為可以互相串門。
雲隱東方·莫宅酒店可以説是目前我住過體驗感最好的酒店，希望以後實現經濟自由後，還來住😄

msg:莫宅算是這幾年住過最好的酒店了。比很多五星國際連鎖都要好，主要是住店的感覺。酒店每個地方你都可以體會到設計師的心思。
整體環境很幽雅，一門之隔外面就是無錫著名的景點步行街南長街。週末的晚上人滿為患，我們從停車場出來就要路過繁華的南長街，根據店管家提前告知的，看到有輛黃包車那就是酒店地方。進了酒店，喧鬧立馬安靜了下來，到了房間，外面的聲音一點都聽不到了。
管家的服務非常熱情和到位，誇獎下那位小哥哥，走的時候還要幫忙拿行李送到停車場，我們都不好意思了。
酒店的裝修設計就不用我多説了，網上都是更專業的探店解説。我來説説最讓我感到驚喜的是床墊，對腰部的墊託剛剛好，這幾天在常熟腰有舊傷，睡覺的時候都感覺到左腿有點麻，結果躺在莫宅的床墊上感覺到腰部剛好被床墊託住，很舒服，腿也沒有感覺到任何的不適，是睡得最舒服的一晚，可惜衹有一晚就要回去。其他的小設計處處都能給到你休憩、安逸、恬靜，真的給你一種還想繼續住下去的感覺。
早餐並不是全自助的，也是房間不多，客人不多的考慮。有餛飩和湯麪兩種套餐選擇，套餐除了主食，還有茶葉蛋、煎蛋、鹹菜、玉米、小芋頭、紅薯等配菜。麪包、咖啡、茶就是自助的。
酒店的實景跟網上的宣傳圖一模一樣，隨便拍都是佳作，不用怕踩坑。照例還是放了些我自己拍的，給大家參考下。

從拈花灣波羅蜜多酒店打車到莫宅，接單的司機和三天前送我們來的一樣，一上車就又説要走高速，又説環湖路會很堵。我問司機星期五上午11點哪來的車堵？導航全綠。他不説話。我開了導航，要他跟着我的導航走。他先裝聾，故意不從；我再次提醒後，他又説導航要從鎮上走，人多紅燈多，按他走的路更暢通。我第三次要求按導航走，他才終於放棄繞路。一路依然和來時一樣，除了城市道路中正常間隔的紅燈，沒有一腳停頓。

無錫的司機喜歡在跑長途時刻意繞路，坐兩次遇兩次，説明不是個案。外地去的朋友多加小心，多開導航。

酒店的工作人員頭一天打來電話加了微信確認了行程發來了定位，説地方不好找。但發的定位又出了問題，司機把我們扔在那個座標點的路邊後，我再一搜素，步行距離2.8公里，32分鐘。烈日當空，我毛了。太太重新叫了車，定位了酒店名稱，才終於七拐八繞停到了橫跨南長街古運河的一座大橋上。按我的交規記憶，橋上停車是違法行為，但市政綠化帶上的缺口和缺口邊的台階卻又真是走到南長街，走到酒店的捷徑。

拖着行李箱狼狽的下着台階，順着南長街往右走了大概200米，路過一家柴犬飲品店，就到了這家門臉兒貌不驚人的老宅酒店。三個姑娘和一位男士的歡聲笑語飄到門外，直到我們推開門打擾到他們。四個人坐在涼爽的前台，沒有一個人出門到不那麼好找的橋上、台階、路口，或者哪怕是店門口接應。

我不禁和太太感慨。鼓浪嶼上1500元一晚的民宿，人家直接到碼頭接人幫忙拖運行李，南長街1880元一晚的民宿，衹有微信提示。不知道是不是感受到了我的不滿情緒，那位身材高大的男士後來主動幫忙把行李箱提上了二樓房間。

幽靜的二層老宅散發出它應有的古典氣質，設計師呂邵蒼的巧思，賦予歷史新的功能與時尚。筒燈與小景的細節搭配隨處可見，一幅畫、一個花瓶，一束乾花，在幽暗的光線和環境的烘託下，營造出一分神祕、一分清雅、一分古樸。入園口擺着一籃蘋果🍎，既是出入平安的寓意，也為客人再補充些維生素。

老宅的磚木結構得以保留，上台階時嘎嘰嘎嘰的聲響喚醒歲月的記憶。兒時家境貧寒，曾住在老爸學校校辦廠的吊腳樓上，上樓時也是這樣嘎嘰嘎嘰的響。

房間不算太大，勉強算得上寬敞。老式建築的房樑很高，中式的木床放在下面也不顯得侷促，算是情調。另一頭有大尺寸的茶台，擺着迎賓的水果和一本心經。軟塌坐着挺舒服，衹是利用的時間不多，心經寫了幾個字，還是掌握不了楷書的精髓。小時候學書法盲選了隸書，似乎選錯了。

坐落在南長街中段的莫宅位置很好。傍晚後，古運河帶走熱量，暑氣消褪得很快。古街、古河、古橋、古宅，吃飯、散步、拍照，閑閑散散幾個小時也不會覺得疲憊。走到兩頭，慢慢步行也不過10來分鐘。

身處鬧市，房間裏卻很安靜。連上藍牙音響，在睡前聽一段大提琴，是我最近大半年的習慣。小隱隱於野，大隱隱於市，設計師的初衷的確得以實現。不過藍牙連得上，電視遙控器卻不太聽話，和波羅蜜多酒店一樣，電視不太聽招呼。

早餐在樓下的小廳。小廳佈置成書房的樣子，書籍📚成了最好的裝飾。等餐的時候翻了翻，設計類和文學類居多，隨手從手邊的格子裏抽出一本，假如時間充裕在這裏讀讀書喝喝茶也蠻好。和酒店相比，品類自然少很多，好在味道真不錯。莫宅平時還承辦私房菜，300元/位起。

因為南京疫情的影響，我們提前一天從無錫返程。退完房拖着行李🧳費力的爬回橋上，打車20分鐘就到了碩放機場。

行程結束，並不完美，好在順利。
