Staff in reception/cafeteria all very businesslike. To be fair it might have felt a harsh contrast coz visited after disneyland.

msg:This hotel had very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Their English abilities were quite good, which I appreciated very much in a Shanghai that speaks less and less English. 

The cleaning staff was also quite pleasant and respectful; when they didn’t come in to clean my room, they left a note letting me know that they noticed the “do not disturb” light was on, so they offered to come a later time or for me to call them directly.

The location is quite convenient as there is an acceptable number of restaurants, shopping malls and other shops around, within walking distance. Getting to some of Shanghai’s landmark areas was easy and not time consuming at all. 

Since I liked my experience for the first 2 nights, I decided to book for 2 more nights. Once the staff knew about this, I was able to stay in the same room without any hurdles. 

Locating to the check-in lobby was somewhat confusing at first because the property is divided into different buildings and it even has gardens and internal roads that get you to these buildings. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I would book again.

msg:Jinjiang Hotel, founded by Ms. Dong Zhujun, a pioneer of the Chinese women's rights movement from Nantong, is a garden-style hotel located on Maoming Road in the city center. Since its opening, it has received nearly 300 heads of state and government from more than 100 countries, as well as many wealthy businessmen. The North Building of the hotel was built in 1929, and its architectural feature is the integration of traditional European style and modern facilities. In July 1999, the renovated North Building reopened, and the facilities are configured according to five-star standards. The reopened Jinjiang Small Auditorium also includes a small hall that once witnessed the Sino-US Shanghai Communiqué. The renovated Jinjiang North Building has retained some of the past styles and added modern facilities and decorations, becoming a luxury hotel building in Shanghai.

msg:In the past few years, my family and I have been staying at Jinjiang one after another. The intuitive feeling is that Jinjiang's service awareness is increasing. Whether it is the doorman or the front desk staff, I can feel that the service attitude has been greatly improved. Although there are many negative comments in the comments, I personally feel that the service attitude is guest-first. A socket board has also been installed at the head of the bed.
Let me talk about the aspects that I hope to improve. The room is indeed a bit old, the quality of the TV is lacking, and the brand of toiletries has been changed from the previous Herborist to a fixed one. The breakfast is not as good as the quality of a few years ago. The overall hardware facilities are not as good as those of new chain brands, but I think people who stay in Jinjiang must also be attracted by the historical memory and feelings. I hope that the hardware facilities can be improved and upgraded.

I scanned the code and read the story of this building. As a former state guesthouse, the story here is closely connected with history. The hotel service is very good. At the same time, I want to give the hotel a big thumbs up, because I accidentally left the camera on the coffee table at the front desk of the hotel. I didn't remember it until the next morning. The staff carefully put it away and handed it over during the shift. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and the service training and management are very good. The only drawback is that the facilities are a little bit old, which is consistent with the style of the hotel and does not affect the experience at all. If there are travelers who mind this, they can choose carefully. Finally, I want to say that the cost performance of this hotel is really very high. The price of a five-star hotel is almost the same as that of a comfortable business hotel during the May Day holiday. At the same time, this hotel is close to the subway, next to Huaihai Road, and opposite is a park. The location advantage is very obvious. It is a treasure hotel.

Parking is also relatively convenient, suitable for customers who drive. The nearby old streets are particularly convenient for shopping and sightseeing. It is a visual enjoyment to pass by every day. I have to complain about the parking lot. You have to take the stairs. There is no prompt when calling the hotel.

When I came to Shanghai before, I would consider Jin Jiang Hotel.
But never in the future

First of all, a 5-star hotel can’t even have Wi-Fi.
It took me a long time to send an email but it still couldn’t be sent.
**It’s difficult to order takeout
I called the front desk and they said it was the central WiFi and asked me to use the mobile network.
It just so happens that the signal in my room is not good.

Second, air conditioning!
I called the front desk and was told there was no air conditioning!
Open the window if you can, or send me a fan! ?
A joke? A 5 star hotel
After several phone calls, there was no improvement. In the end, the temperature was over 28 degrees Celsius.

Really, don’t even consider staying here. It’s not what it used to be.

msg:Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel, the nostalgia of old customers for you is being exhausted

I stayed at Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel, Jinnan Building, Twin Room from April 15 to 18

Total price on Ctrip: RMB 2,467, unit price: RMB 822/night (including 1 breakfast)

‼ ️Service score: 4 points
(Service score = price corresponding to service level, full score 10 points)

Every time I return to Shanghai, I will choose Jinjiang Hotel on Maoming South Road first. I have always liked the style of old-school Shanghai hotels in Jinjiang Hotel. Unfortunately, the check-in experience is getting worse and worse.

➡️The five most important nodes in the hotel customer journey: Doorman, front desk, housekeeping, telephone service, breakfast service. Jinjiang Hotel does very poorly without exception

1️⃣Doorman: The doorman of Jinjiang Hotel is just a soy sauce. When the guest's car arrives at the door, he will never take the initiative to open the door and carry the luggage, let alone guide the guest to the front desk. I remember when I got off the car, the doorman looked at me, and I looked at him, and we even looked at each other, but he still didn't say anything.
2️⃣Front desk: I dragged my luggage to the front desk, and the first thing the front desk said was "Do you have a reservation?", not even a "Excuse me", let alone greeting the guests. When checking out, the front desk took the room card and didn't even open the door, let alone say goodbye to the guests
3️⃣Housekeeping: The carpet in the guest room was full of stains, and it looked really dirty. Housekeeping was making a loud noise in the corridor outside the door all morning, which was very speechless
4️⃣The communication ability of the telephone service guest service operator was worrying. The air conditioner didn't cool down all the time. I called the guest service, and the reply I got was that some guests felt cold and some guests felt hot, so the hotel simply didn't turn on the air conditioner, but only turned on the ventilation. I said your logic is wrong! Whether it is turning on the cold air conditioner or the heating, only half of the guests are dissatisfied. If you only turn on the ventilation, won't all guests be dissatisfied? Then the customer service said that it was to save costs, so the air conditioning was not turned on.
5️⃣ Breakfast service: The variety is getting less and less, and the quality is getting worse and worse. I can't complain. What surprised me even more was that the image of the restaurant waiters was really bad. The uniforms were obviously ill-fitting and very dirty. Those foremen in black suits kept walking with their hands behind their backs, as if they were leaders inspecting the work, and there was no communication or exchange with the guests.
➡️Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel, if your service does not change and improve, then I can tell you that your price will become cheaper and cheaper, and in the end you will only have the advantage of geographical location and the name "Jinjiang Hotel"

In the past, they had always thought that only senior leaders could stay at Jin Jiang Hotel. Very good feeling, very good mood, spent an unforgettable 2 nights and 3 days. I also saw the introduction photos of presidents, prime ministers and leaders from all over the world who have stayed in the VIP building of the hotel. I felt even more proud. I thought about whether I could stay in this VIP building for 1 or 2 nights in the future. It was very meaningful. . The scenery inside Jinjiang Hotel is beautiful, and the lawn greening management is very good and beautiful. Room hygiene services are also in place. Catering is also good. This time it must be rated five stars.

I chose Jin Jiang Hotel because I appreciate the retro Shanghai style. The rooms are quiet and comfortable, and there are steel windows with a strong sense of history. The scenery outside the windows is unobstructed, and the breeze blows and makes me feel happy. I like the big bathtub. I can take a bath here to get rid of my fatigue, and then sink into the comfortable bedding and have a good night's sleep. The breakfast is average, but the environment is elegant.

The air conditioning was turned off in the room and it was very hot. The service is acceptable, but it is divided into many buildings, and each building has a front desk. The advantage is that it is convenient for hotel customers. The disadvantage is that there are not enough staff. With only one person, there will always be a time to leave and you have to wait. Breakfast needs to be ordered one day in advance, so the price is cheap, which is a bit strange, mainly because the breakfast is average and the price/performance ratio is not high. Overall, the experience of old Shanghai style is charming, and the number of guests staying at the hotel is actually slightly more Shanghainese.

The day before when we registered in the Jinnan Building, we got help from Manager Xiao Yao. Seeing that we had children with us, she enthusiastically helped us upgrade our room to the Jinbei Building. This time, the experience was better. It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel with good hardware and services. It's very good, and it's super convenient to travel. I drove myself but I didn't use the car during my stay. To use a popular saying, I felt good staying at Jinjiang and I'm looking forward to my next stay.

When checking in, the service staff were polite and followed the procedures, but I could not feel the sincere enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the service staff. Everything was By convention. I applied for an extension on the first day I checked in, and went to the front desk to inform the staff about the extension. However, something unpleasant happened on the day of the extension. I came back from traveling and found that the key card had lost its magnetism and I could not enter the room. At this time, my mother and I were very tired but could not enter the room. I quickly went downstairs and asked the front desk staff. After checking, they said that the renewal form had not yet arrived at the front desk, so the door card was automatically demagnetized when the time came. It said that the equipment was aging and delayed. Then I would like to say that I informed the front desk about my extension on the first day. Why not change it on the system or make a record? Although in the end the lobby manager gave me fruit with a smile on his face, But I think this kind of thing shouldn't happen. It still lacks the minimum sense of responsibility. The store is famous and I hope to provide employees with basic service training~

The twin bed in Jinnan Building, the old building I booked, was arranged on the first floor after arriving. When I opened the window, a smell of oil smoke came out. Outside the window was the narrow kitchen equipment. Go down the aisle, negotiate with the front desk, and add some money to move to the Jinbei Building. The Jinbei Building is relatively new, and the rooms are large. The rooms are arranged to face the courtyard and can open windows. However, the bathroom arrangement is very unreasonable, there is water on the floor of the shower room, and there are construction problems. That love seat is weird. The hotel is in a good location, located in the old city, with Wutongshu Street extending in all directions. For bosozokus, Wukang Road, Sinan Road, Zhangyuan, etc. can all be reached on foot. There are few parking spaces on the ground floor of the hotel, and we are required to park in the underground parking lot. When we arrived, the security guard just went underground without asking, and found out that there was no elevator and the luggage had not been picked up. I have to praise the housekeeping depar**ent and lobby staff. I left something at the hotel and found it at night. It was delivered by SF Express the next morning.

Lao Jinjiang looks mysterious from the outside, but actually the price/performance ratio is pretty good. The room is not small, the swimming pool is nice, and I am very satisfied with the fact that the windows can be opened.
The details are definitely better than those of Xin Jinjiang, but there is still a slight gap compared with Huayuan, but the basics of the two are also different.
The courtyard is more like a traditional state hotel, mainly used for walking, and it is very comfortable when the weather is good.
Personally, I feel that among the three giants of Jinjiang Maoming Road, New Jinjiang is the best choice for cost-effectiveness and has the best garden details. If you like Japanese hotels, Old Jinjiang is suitable for those who have higher requirements for hotels than New Jinjiang.

The afternoon tea is also good, the snacks are rich in color, and the breakfast environment is also good, with less variety. I don’t know if it still belongs to the Airport Authority. It’s really not easy to be open to the public without losing service.
I was lucky enough to see Premier Zhou pick up Ethiopian Emperor Salasi from the old Hongqiao Airport and get off at the north building from the window of Jinjiang Auditorium 50 years ago...
This is my first time staying in Jinjiang North Tower, which was unthinkable before.

I searched on Ctrip and found that an ordinary hotel near Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street costs more than 1,000, while the famous Jinjiang Hotel only costs 700, which is a great deal. After checking in, I realized that the price-performance ratio is very high, the service is attentive, and the environment is elegant. It is only 200 meters away from the South Shaanxi Road Station of the subway. After a day of playing, you can swim in the constant-temperature swimming pool to relax. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will stay at Jinjiang.

I originally wanted to give Jinjiang service no 5 stars (explained later), but it wasn’t until I met her that I decided to give her 5 stars! When I stay in a five-star hotel, I usually have to call the front desk to pick up something, and I have to wait for more than 10 minutes at the earliest, but the aunt can show up within 5 minutes, smiling every time. Her personal service, knowing that we need to drink more water, took special care of us, adding water to the room, and placing a small glass on each side of the small table next to the bed🥃 to add warmth to this hotel. Why didn't I give it 5 points for "service"? The reason: When we checked in, it was raining. We took a taxi, but they let us get off at the VIP building. ￼Sitting at the front desk of the VIP building, when we asked how to get to the North Building, she said coldly and walked over there without looking at us. Normally, when a five-star hotel sees a guest in such a panic, she will enthusiastically help lead the way. Her Indifference made us feel cold for a while! ! Fortunately, this aunt's excellent service made us feel at home! Thank you auntie. As for the environment and location of Jinjiang Hotel, they are also very good! Will go again next time!

msg:I stayed in the North Building on my first night. There were no shortcomings except that the room was small. The hotel covers a large area and has its own garden. The height of the building is not particularly exaggerated. The building and rooms are very stylish. It's just that the gym is underground, and it doesn't have all the equipment. The air is very bad. I feel uncomfortable when I go in. I feel a little dizzy after half an hour when I come out.

The next day we booked the Nan Building because there were no rooms in the North Building. Apart from the larger rooms, Nanlou has no advantages. I don’t know if it’s because the 4th floor, which is considered a high-rise building in Nan Tower, has sunlight, so the room temperature remains high. The hotel's central air conditioner was not turned on, and the air conditioner could only ventilate the air. I reported it to the front desk and there was nothing they could do. Even if the temperature outside the window is pleasant at night, the room is stuffy and hot with the windows open all night. It shows that the indoor temperature is 26-27 degrees, which is obviously not a temperature suitable for people to sleep.

I finally fell asleep, and around 7:30 this morning I heard the sound of a key being inserted into a lock. It was very pleasant to my ears, and I heard it repeatedly not just once but several times. I usually wear earplugs when I sleep. I have never been woken up in other hotels, including the North Tower the day before. Today, I was woken up in the Nan Tower. I couldn't sleep, so around 8:30, there was noise outside again. I opened the door and saw that someone was cleaning. After a brief chat, the aunt just said she was sorry and that the noise should be noisy, and she couldn't sleep again until 9:30.

Fortunately, Ctrip refunded my room for today as soon as they communicated with the hotel. This service efficiency is still online. It is really difficult to evaluate Jinjiang. The hardware and staff quality are not very impressive, but the key point of making the tenants' stay comfortable can be said to be missed at all. Next time if I really don’t have a five-star hotel to choose from, I might consider the North Tower, but I won’t stay in the Nan Tower if I stay for free.

However, the hygiene in the south building is really not satisfactory. At night, a cockroach fell out of the toilet paper in the shower. I quickly trampled it to death on the bathroom floor. I was too tired to call the front desk at night. It is hard to imagine that if you are afraid of bugs, you may really be afraid of bugs.

Xiao Yao at the front desk had a bright smile and gave the children a box of delicious cookies. The facilities are also good. It is quiet in the bustle and convenient for travel. There is a typhoon shelter and Xinwang just outside the door. If you like a tea restaurant, you can have morning tea instead. Check out is also very easy.

msg:I don’t know how to rate this hotel as a five-star hotel, but it is a hotel with a bit of a story. It was past 11 o'clock when we took a taxi from Disneyland and arrived here at night. No one asked us when we entered. The child fell asleep. When we carried the child from the VIP Building to the Jinnan Building, we were told that the order could not be found. Finally, we found out that the order was in the booking process. The Jinbei Building is not here. A shuttle bus came to take luggage. It can only accommodate three people, and the others can walk there. When I arrived at the front desk of Jinbei Building, the girl who checked in was too slow. It took half an hour to get three rooms, and she told me that afternoon tea had passed. I asked her what was included in afternoon tea, and the answer was: I haven't had it, so I don't know! Finally got to the room, my God, this is not a five-star hotel with more than 1,000 yuan, it is just a shabby small hotel. The room smells of urine, the sofa is unbearably dirty, and the wallpaper is cracked and stained It was dirty, and there wasn't even a decent handle on the corridor door outside, which was a safety hazard. After staying in so many hotels, this hotel really ruined my outlook. I didn’t want to change hotels with my children, so I couldn’t wait to check out the next day. Everyone should consider this hotel carefully. Both the hardware and software are too poor, and it has nothing to do with five stars.

The design and details of the rooms must have been very high-end at that time, especially the door and mirror of the bathroom. It can be seen that the designer's ingenuity is now. All the facilities are a bit outdated, and the overall floor of the south building is low, and the windows are facing the wall, so they cannot be fully opened, which is a bit of a loss. The service is okay, although it is not particularly enthusiastic, but I don't think it is bad. The little girl who makes coffee at breakfast is very nice.

When I checked in, the front desk saw that there were three of us and we only booked two breakfasts, so they suggested adding another one, and clearly told me that I could refund if I didn't eat it, so I added it. I went for a walk in the morning and didn't go to eat breakfast. The guy who checked out told me impatiently that I couldn't refund. He impatiently showed me the check-in form and threw it on the table. His attitude was very bad. He looked down on us outsiders. At my strong request, he contacted the supervisor and refunded it. It was not the problem of the 118 yuan difference, but the service attitude was unacceptable. In addition, the sound insulation in the room was poor. The neighbor was tossing until more than three o'clock, and I couldn't sleep well. In a word, you get what you pay for. I will not stay here again.

However, I really feel that the times are changing rapidly, and now this kind of design is no longer in line with the preferences of young people. I am not talking about the soft decoration design, but the design of the functional pattern. The guest rooms are very depressing, and the toilets are hidden guards. There is an indescribable feeling. My wife said that old hotels are quite gloomy. Generally speaking, the experience is average, but the price/performance ratio is still acceptable in terms of location.

I drank two cups in the dim light, and then I opened the curtains and prepared to drink it for my children, only to find out~ I took it to the front desk Inquiry, a man said indifferently, wait a minute, and called a lady who should be the manager of Datang. The lady looked at it and asked me if I was boiled with mineral water, it should be minerals... I dare not dare at this level I believe that there are old five-star hotels~ I stayed in this Jinjiang hotel many years ago. At that time, I felt that although the service was not in place and the facilities were relatively old, the faucet turned out to be turned off. I screwed it back~ But win The location is good, and it’s very convenient to bring a baby~ It’s fine if there’s basically no service, because most of the time it’s outside~ But the water was really disgusting for me for several days~ I changed to the Garden Hotel opposite the next day~ This one is included in the list Blacklisted~ But, Yongfu on the 12th floor has delicious food and good service

Environment: A rare garden hotel in the urban area, and 🈶 underground parking lot (can park about 20 cars). There are also parking spaces on the ground in the yard, but only experienced drivers with side parking skills are required to park perfectly.
Service: All the service staff are very polite, especially when we stayed in Jinnan Building for the first night, because of a small accident, the manager personally asked us and upgraded us to Jinbei Building for free.
The breakfast is a Chinese and Western buffet. The food in the south building and the north building are the same. The hotel also has a swimming pool and a spa (you can contact by phone, and you can go to the hotel room for a massage). Next time you go to Shanghai, you will stay in Jinjiang.

What surprised me was that she asked us if we needed toothbrushes at the end. I said of course, and then she took two from under the counter and gave them to me. Is this a five-star hotel? It was the same routine as the guesthouse. Are your toothbrushes Hermès brand? I was given a room on the second floor. When I got to the room, I was furious again. The room smelled of cigarettes, and the windows were covered with film. When I opened it, I saw a wall outside. I spent a thousand to stay in this room. I was so angry that I went to the front desk to ask for a change. They said I had to pay more to change to the opposite side. OK, I accepted it and added 100 to change to the opposite side. The mood is the most important thing when you go out to play. Eat well and stay well, don't get angry!

msg:I have been living in New Jinjiang before, and since I arrived in Shanghai this time, I was lucky enough to experience the so-called "service" of Jinjiang Hotel, which can be said to be beyond imagination. First of all, when the car arrives at the front hall, only the welcome guests come to tell the car not to park at the door and leave the box. No one cares about it. After the shouting operation in the lobby, a welcome person came. Two boxes worth nearly 10,000 yuan were all forced to go down the stairs by him. Strong inspection) When I arrived in the room, I was surprised again that the wallpaper was cracked and moldy. This is actually a 5-star hotel, which is so amazing, and the operation of the hotel requires me to see if the newly changed room can satisfy me, which is enough to explain They have a management system with no standards and no professional ethics. If this is a state-owned hotel, then I firmly believe that ***************, otherwise the management will not be so bad. This is in the breakfast It was also confirmed. Since I went there late, I saw that the noodle shop in his house was not collected and stored by the staff, but was packed in bags by the cleaning staff and then brought downstairs and out of the hotel. an experience. From another angle, what would it be like in a place we can’t see? I will definitely not choose a hotel managed by this group anymore because they have no management except for this old yard and several historical buildings plus a superior location. Nothing else.

The sanitation of the hotel is a mess (the photo is proof), the five-star hotel has a 0-star experience, the facilities are a mess (there are also photos as evidence), the bathroom space is small, and the sink is less than 10 cm wide by visual inspection (the photo is proof), sitting on the toilet You must straighten your back, or you will have to fix your head on the glass door of the bathroom! The big bed room is made up of two single beds, and the sleeping experience is extremely poor! The aging air conditioner was so loud that I had to turn it off to fall asleep.

msg:It was the first time I came to Shanghai to stay at the Nikko Garden Hotel opposite Jinjiang. Maybe the size of the room was specially designed for Japanese tourists to be uncomfortable. The next day I moved into this hotel whose exterior design still retains the pure and strong flavor of old Shanghai. After many years, although Jinjiang is also next door, I have never been tired of this distinctive Shanghai landmark. I occasionally come to China and stay for a night or two. The old and old elevators have been replaced with new ones. Fortunately, this time I found that the exterior design has returned to the old style, which is quite good. I really like the corner room 819 in Jinbei Building. The bathroom has an independent bathroom with a huge space, so I can wash happily 😂 The breakfast seems to have not been changed for a long time. But on the whole, the Jin Jiang Hotel with a history of 1926 still has its own irreplaceable characteristics. 🌿🔺

msg:The location of the hotel is more convenient, it can be regarded as a quiet place. When I first checked in, I was given a room on the 2nd floor. The light was not good and it was next to the outdoor unit of the air conditioner. After communicating with the front desk on the phone, I quickly changed the room on the 6th floor, which happened to be facing the Lyceum Theater downstairs. After the talk show in the evening, the street is very lively, but the room is very quiet, not noisy at all.
There are many delicious small restaurants around, but unfortunately with a baby, I can neither listen to talk shows nor go to supper every day.
The hotel is old, but the room facilities are very new. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the children are very happy to eat.
The only downside is that there is no convenience store near the hotel, but there is also a vending machine in the hotel lobby.

msg:Service: It was a wonderful experience staying in Jin Jiang Hotel. When I arrived, it was around 10:00 in the evening. The sign of Jinnan Building was not very clear. , I asked a service staff to ask, but when I went in, I found that the lobby was empty and the service desk was empty. I didn't know who I was and where I was. Then I went to the service desk, and when I got to the front, the waitress sitting behind stood up. Then let’s talk about the check-in process. It’s unreasonable that there is only one person on duty in the hotel at night. This female front desk has been answering the phone during the check-in process for me, and each call has been spoken for more than two or three minutes. He didn't mean to apologize to me during the phone call, just let me wait beside him, and he didn't mean to apologize to me for waiting after answering the phone. Then she asked me for my ID card and after scanning it, she patted the room card in front of me and said, please keep the room card and ID card. I thought the ID card was already in the room card, but I picked up the room card. She said again, please keep your ID card, I asked her where is my ID card, she pointed to the machine in front of me and asked me to take it myself. He didn't mean to hand me the ID card at all, and his service ended at this point, and he didn't take the initiative to tell me my room number and where my room is. I asked several times before telling me that the room is The first floor, the elevator is behind. Then he suddenly said that the disposable utensils were in front of the machine, and he spoke with his mouth the whole time, without using gestures to guide the way. His tone was blunt and impatient. Absolutely, I really applaud this waitress.

Transportation: The location of the hotel is very good, and it is convenient to go to the airport and train station by subway

Environment: There is a large green area in the hotel, which is pleasing to the eye, but if the room is on the first floor, it is a bit noisy

Hygiene: Satisfied

In addition, I applied for an extension for two rooms on Ctrip 2 days in advance. On the same day, the two room cards still failed, and I had to wait 10 minutes each at the front desk. Minutes later, I was told that it was OK, but in the end, I could only get on the elevator. When I reached the door of the room, I still couldn’t get in. All of the above, I really don’t know why the legendary woman Dong Zhujun managed Lao Jinjiang so well, but today’s service is so bad. In addition, when I stayed in hotels in Shanghai and Nanjing at the same time, the sheets were very dry, so this is definitely not the fault of the climate, it is just bad! As an old customer of Lao Jinjiang, I am very sad. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will not choose Lao Jinjiang again. For three days, I was in a cold and wet quilt every day. It is simply unbearable to look back!

msg:Old hotel, the room is OK
It is divided into north and south buildings. It is very big inside. I searched for the front desk for a while. The underground parking lot is far away from the room, and there is an additional charge for those near the door.

Bad place.
1: The friend who was traveling with me did not bring an ID card, and the hotel informed that it was not possible to check in with an electronic ID card.
Although now many places can use electronic ID cards or enter ID number face recognition.
Although this side has not kept pace with the times, we also expressed our understanding.
The hotel informed the nearby police stations that they can apply for temporary ID cards for check-in. We came to the nearest police station, and the other party told us that we got the police station in the hotel area, and we needed a certificate from the hotel to handle it.
It should not be the first time that the hotel has received customers who did not bring their ID cards, but they did not give any notice, which made us waste a lot of time.
2: The room is equipped with toothpaste, cotton swabs and other disposable items, but there is no toothbrush. This operation is a bit confusing, and I don't know what the starting point is.
When we couldn't find the toothbrush to wash and called the front desk, the front desk told us to come to the first floor to get the toothbrush... Of course, the service staff finally brought it to me.
Why didn't you remind me when you checked in? Wait for someone to be found in the middle of the night before calling.
3: The central air conditioner only has ventilation, no heat or cold...
It was very hot in Shanghai that day, and the room was also very stuffy. I turned on the air conditioner and fell asleep sweating all over.

There is a large yard but it cannot be parked on the ground. You have to park in the narrow and hard-to-park underground garage about 200 meters away from this building. Finally, you have to walk up a few flights of stairs to the ground, and then walk back to the check-in building. It is not recommended to stay. It's nothing but an embroidered pillow.

On the first day, I was pulling my luggage and wanted to enter the gate, but a service staff stood by and didn't move the gate for me; I was in a hurry to check in, because I wanted to take a shower and have a meeting in the afternoon, but the front desk staff opened their mouths and said there was no way , the room has not been tidied up bla bla, instead of saying that we will try our best to find a solution for you... Later I got a little angry, but it was resolved quickly... The hotel hardware is still very OK, but the service attitude really needs to be improved (later In two days, I feel that the attitude of most of the service staff is OK; but a small number of people also affect the guest's impression of the hotel). In addition, the hotel is a bit big, if you are crazy, you have to directly search for the building you live in when navigating haha. If you want to experience an old-fashioned hotel with history, Jin Jiang is still OK, and it is more suitable for family travel.

And for two consecutive days😵💫, the hotel lobby manager not only failed to deal with it, but also said it was "construction during normal hours"! We have no choice but to consider ourselves unlucky! I didn’t even say sorry😡This is my first negative review! When checking out, I didn't even say sorry for the poor experience... Is this a five-star hotel? hehe
The musty smell in the room never dissipates and the carpet is dirty. People who want to stay here should think carefully!

The Shanghai dishes are still exquisite, and the environment is also very good. , The hot water temperature is not easy to adjust, maybe the faucet needs to replace the ball core? The ball valve is gone. It is also close to Huaihai Road, the overall is very perfect, and the price is very suitable, so I will make a decision in the future!
highly recommended!

The sanitary conditions of the room are average, the small coffee table is muddy, and hotel slippers on the bathroom floor will feel sticky to your feet. 3. The man at the front desk of the hotel who checked out didn't know who gave him the confidence. He kept asking questions about the room card during check out, which was unreasonable and arrogant. I can only say that your performance represents your vision and the management of the hotel. In addition, the aunt on the floor is very nice and enthusiastic.

msg:I hope that Ctrip can come up with a negative point system, I will definitely give it to it!
I have stayed twice in the past few years, the transportation is convenient, and I chose Jin Jiang Hotel without hesitation for a temporary Chinese New Year trip. Block it from now on!

To evaluate whether a hotel is excellent or not, software services and hardware facilities complement each other.

The front desk service is the face of the hotel. From the time of entering the door at 6 o'clock in the evening to walking in front of the front desk waitress, there was no sentence from the beginning to the end: Hello! Happy New Year! welcome! Even wearing a mask can feel the cold face. What did you ask and she replied coldly with a slightly rhetorical tone, there is no so-called active service. I didn’t confirm the room type with you, so I started to collect deposits. There are no high-end restaurants that need to pay for food and beverages, and the minibar only has a few bottles of soda and Evian. So I asked her if Ctrip members need a deposit? She sneered that there is no need for a hotel! I said that you have a smile on your face from the moment the guests enter the door, and you don’t have a good attitude towards the guests. Then she started calling, welcome to complain, and called the lobby manager, hehe~
A big guy came, and he just said to give me face, excuse me? who are you? I don't even know you, Zhang San or Li Si. If you don't ask yourself what the staff's attitude is towards the guests during the Chinese New Year, do you want me to give you face?

After that, you will not be informed of the availability of smoking rooms in non-smoking rooms, where to get to the elevator, how much Wi-Fi is available, and how to pay for parking. All the reminders will be omitted!
In the end, I was afraid that I would write a bad review, and I didn't even confirm that I had checked in with Ctrip!

Not to mention the hardware, it is dilapidated and mottled! The elevator is like an old car, wobbly. Entering the corridor on the floor, there was a musty smell and a gloomy feeling.
Several places in the room where the wall paper was connected had turned black.

There is an anti-human doorstop installed in front of the toilet in the bathroom, where you put your feet at your convenience, and if you stumble with a bad eye, you can hit your head directly on the door. There is not a single word to remind you to pay attention to safety!

The sound insulation is super poor, the sound of singing in the shower next door is clear!

No matter how you adjust the water in the shower head, it is always hot and cold, and there are a few thin streams of water. This ancient equipment is reluctant to change.

The charging plug next to the bed needs to be moved to plug in the bedside table.
The central air conditioner rumbles all night, accompanying you to sleep.

I know that it is state-owned, and there is a gap between it and the five-star chain brand, but it is not like this lying flat and rotten! This kind of rigid management and arrogance make guests uncomfortable like a few lice under a dilapidated Chinese dress. I don't know where that sense of superiority comes from, it's ridiculous!

Guangzhou Garden Hotel is also a five-star state-owned brand. After staying several times, you feel at home and satisfied every time. If you describe it as the bright star in the sky, you Jin Jiang Hotel is the frog at the bottom of the well. Goodbye! Never see you again! Although you don't care.

In the middle of the night, there was suddenly road construction outside, which was very noisy. I asked the front desk and they said it was allowed by the municipal government and they had no choice. So why did they open a room close to the road for guests when they knew it was a waste? It was really terrible. I got up in the middle of the night to change rooms and didn't go to bed until two or three o'clock. It was a great suffering. The breakfast was also very bad. We went to eat at 9 o'clock, and they didn't add any more dishes. The food was really bad and tasted bad. It's hard to describe.

msg:Recently, I encountered a bad service experience when I helped a friend book a stay at Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai. I accidentally filled in the wrong check-in date for the reservation, but after discovering the problem, I immediately contacted Ctrip and the hotel for help in just 10 minutes. However, the hotel refused any pre-operation under the pretext of being scheduled to be off work, and directly hung up the customer's call with a bad attitude.

This kind of service attitude is disappointing and leaves customers with a very poor stay experience. As a well-established restaurant, customers expect professional and friendly service, especially when they encounter problems. However, the hotel's response was dissatisfying. Customers simply wishing to change dates or check out so that they could receive the service they expected were met with indifference and indifference.

As a representative of the service industry, hotels should put customers first, actively solve problems and provide solutions. For such a small mistake, the hotel can completely provide help, such as changing the booking date or helping the customer communicate and coordinate with Ctrip. However, they chose to turn customers away, severely damaging the hotel's reputation.

We hope that Shanghai Jin Jiang Hotel can learn lessons from this incident, strengthen staff training, and improve service quality. Only by truly caring about customers and providing positive solutions when faced with problems can we win their trust and support. For this affected customer, we hope that the hotel can proactively contact them to solve the problem and provide appropriate compensation to repair their bad experience at the hotel!
The hotel is rubbish and calls customers directly. Ctrip colludes with the hotel to deceive customers!

msg:SOEs, you know. Originally, I came to stay because of the famous Jin Jiang Hotel, but I was disappointed.
Jinnan's floor count is very low, and only a row of dilapidated residential buildings can be seen outside the window, which is really a loss. The staff had a bad attitude the day before yesterday, especially a young guy who was a ********? Could this be the front desk of a five-star hotel? ?
There is a welcome drink, but you can't drink it with two bottles of beer in it. You need to pay for it. Then why do you put it? I don't understand it at all.
It came at the end of October. Anyway, the room was very stuffy, and the air conditioner was getting hotter and hotter. Do you really have no one here to check the temperature in the room?
There is nothing wrong with the buffet breakfast. The variety is complete and the service is good. You can like it.
The most annoying thing is the swimming pool. From the time I came in to the time I went out, the lifeguards were lying on the reclining chair and playing with their mobile phones, and also put them outside. I can't understand. Are all the co-authors here related households or retired national assholes? The day before I stayed in Jinjiang, I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel on the Yangtze River, which is also a five-star hotel. What kind of services do they provide? I was swimming alone, and three lifeguards came in. They were at least sitting on lifesaving chairs while playing with their mobile phones. They retreated after I played.
All in all, as a state-owned enterprise, it is conceivable that the services of all hotels under Jin Jiang Group will continue to decline. Since I have spent all this money, why don't I go to hotels with better service? In the final analysis, the historical background is just a few buildings, things are dead, people are alive!

msg:I have always liked to live in the Jinbei Building of Jinjiang Hotel. Although it is an old-fashioned hotel, the facilities and facilities inside are very good, but this time I was very disappointed. The front desk gave a twin room, but the shower facilities are It's very old, the yellowed toilet seat looks terrible, I can't even go to the toilet😱, I hope they can improve it in the future. When I go to Shanghai, I still like to live in Jinbei Building, their room, and I hope that I will not live in such a toilet in the future.

Parking on the ground was not allowed and said that there would be a fee. I said I would charge it, but it still didn't work. I insisted on parking in the underground which is far away from the walk. I pretended that the underground was free and said it was for my sake. It's better not to open it to individual visitors like us, but to use it exclusively for internal personnel

The concierge and cleaning are maintained at a good level. Personally, I think it is more suitable for the elderly. If you are tired from walking around, you can go back to the hotel to rest at any time, so you don't have to go out all day.

I was waiting for me to catch a plane, but he didn't say anything, he didn't take you seriously at all, asked him if he said he was quitting, and you didn't say anything when I said I was quitting? I stand there and wait for a long time? The funniest thing is that there was no refund at all. When I asked for a refund certificate, he begrudgingly fought for a long time before refunding the money. I'm really speechless, I've lived in a hotel for a year and a half, and I've never seen anything like this. It may be that my vision is not very broad, the world is full of wonders. The future is bright, lad.

Normal hotels would clearly mark the price of things that need to be paid for. Jinjiang Hotel left the menu somewhere else, and the only two bottles of free mineral water in the room were placed on the bathroom sink. Do you go to the bathroom when you need water in your hotel? In the end, two cans of coke, two bottles of Evian and one bottle of Perrier were charged 130. Isn't this disgusting? The lobby manager said that he was a dog compared to the waiter, haha, Shanghai men haha...

How is it hindering your freedom? I have never seen such a well-behaved hotel. I went to so many cities on business, and I didn’t bring my ID card. I didn’t say that I wouldn’t be able to check in. I got a temporary ID card, but when I extended my stay, I lost the temporary ID card, and I wasn’t allowed to check in. Okay, okay, if you don’t give me a place, I won’t give you a place. I’m so sleepy at 2:30 in the morning, so I’ll take a rest in your lobby. What’s wrong? I’m here to chase people. What the hell? This is my first time to write a negative review. I will never come back again. This is the worst service among all the five-star hotels I have ever stayed in.

Communicate with the hotel lobby manager and place the takeout at the security booth so that the guy can leave first.
He said, "Hey, Miss, I'm telling you, this is our rule. If you're not satisfied, it's 12345."
It turns out that this is how state-owned enterprises represent the country and show our country’s image to other countries! Who gave them such confidence?

msg:The geographical position is superior, you can walk to the subway station within a few minutes, and it is also very convenient to take a taxi. You can walk to Huaihai Road to eat nearby, and the choice is also very convenient. This time I stayed at Jinnan Building. It is said that it was built around the 1980s. The floor is not high, but it feels more comfortable to live. There is a large lawn at the door. The tree-lined air is rare in the city. The room size is appropriate. , It feels warmer, and the decoration style is very good. The bathroom has a smart toilet with flushing. The bedding is also comfortable. There are some age-like photos in the lobby on the first floor. The hotel has received many foreign friends and belongs to the former state guesthouse. It's just getting old gradually as the years go by, but overall it is well preserved. Speaking of breakfast, the variety is single, and it can only be said that you will be full. Without the rich variety and taste experience of a five-star hotel, I hope that there will be improvements in the future.

msg:I lived in the North Building before, and this time I specially booked the Nan Building to come and experience it.
External environment: Nanlou is still good, and the building is more charming and historical;
Internal environment: the lobby is more spacious, and a good place to relax and gather; but the location of the twin room has no scenery from the window, and the frosted window is the same as no window. Don't expect too much (the side of the double bed room is also good)
Service: Check-in is slow, or it may be due to abnormal holidays, lack of experience in handling, but good attitude and sufficient service staff
Others: The room has poor soundproofing. I can't stand the unscrupulous chat in the middle of the night when I meet someone who doesn't know each other. On the one hand, guests need to be self-disciplined, on the other hand, I also hope that hotel management can be strengthened... Chat loudly in the middle of the night for no less than an hour, without any management interference
Veteran hotel, overall is good!

msg:The tail is too big to fall off, and it is rotten.
I stayed in mid-March. The temperature in Shanghai was already 25+ at that time, and the central air conditioner was still blowing hot air. I was told that it could not be adjusted.
In fact, of course it's not "unable" to adjust, it's just that you don't bother to adjust.
Compared with the outside, the old building is more stuffy.
Speaking of which, the Huating Hotel, one of the culprits of the Shanghai epidemic so far, is also because of the "unadjustable" central air conditioner.
Living in Jinjiang, an old state-owned enterprise, made me feel like I saw Ma Tianshui who criticized production theory many years ago.
It is better to have a non-adjustable central air conditioner than an adjustable breeze.
Speaking of which, when you Jin Jiang Hotel celebrated its anniversary, you were so ungrateful that you didn't invite the founder Gu Zhujun.
Now it seems that it is actually quite right, but fortunately there is no invitation.
If the old lady really saw Jin Jiang's current virtue again, she would have to die again.

msg:Opened in 1929, Jin Jiang Hotel, which has a history of nearly a hundred years, has to be called an "old hotel". Because of poverty, this time I moved into the Jinnan Building which was built later. The hotel also has the more historic Jinbei Building and the VIP Building.
The day of check-in coincided with the "firework" typhoon that had happened in many years, so lunch and dinner were eaten at the small cafe in Jinnan Building. Although there are not many varieties, the taste is really good, especially the bowl of pork noodles with pickled vegetables, absolutely absolutely.
Started a conversation with a restaurant manager. The manager is a native of Shanghai, and he enthusiastically explained the history of Jinjiang to us, and told us many anecdotes about the hotel and the city of Shanghai. It is precisely because of this that I said goodbye to him on the day of leaving the store, and I hope to see you next time haha~
I have to say that the service of the old hotel is really standard, which is incomparable to many other hotels. What impressed me the most was when I was having breakfast, when I was looking for a napkin, the service staff on the side immediately asked "What are you looking for" and helped deliver the paper to the seat. This kind of observation and active service consciousness are really impeccable. Such professional services are touching.
Although the hotel has been in business for a long time, the facilities are well maintained. After getting off the elevator, the corridor is full of fragrance, accompanied by light music, which makes people feel refreshed. In the room, the mattress is moderately firm and the linen is of good quality, soft and comfortable. The shampoo and shower gel use a British brand and the quality is very good. Hygienic cleaning work is in place. If you say that the toilet is disinfected daily, you can really smell the faint smell of disinfection. I couldn't find any dead spots in the room, and I gave it a good comment.
The history of such an old hotel is naturally glorious. The hotel has received more than 100 heads of state and government including three American presidents and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It is a former state guesthouse. In 1972, Nixon visited China and signed the famous "Sino-US Joint Communiqué" in the Jinjiang Small Auditorium. It is fortunate to be able to live in such a hotel.
Nevertheless, I still want to make some suggestions. First of all, the breakfast variety is a bit less. Although it is Chinese and Western-style buffet, the quality is good, but the richness is more like a four-star hotel than a five-star hotel. Is it possible to add more local elements from Shanghai, such as steamed dumplings, pan fried, etc.? In addition, can there be more changes every day? No matter how delicious the food is, I’m tired of repeating it~
In addition, I feel that Jin Jiang doesn't cherish his own history enough. As a guest, we are all willing to learn about the glorious history of the hotel, but the hotel itself does not even have a decent exhibition, even if it is a small one. Except for the photo wall and a few brief introductions, there is nothing left. I have been to Tianjin Astor Hotel, which is also an old hotel. Astor hotel even opened a museum to sell tickets. Detailed textual research and introduction, tableware and room furnishings from a hundred years ago, this is the proper attitude towards one's own history. What's more, the history of Jinjiang is so glorious.
The level of afternoon tea in the hotel still needs to be improved. The variety is less, the preparation is not refined enough, and the taste can only be said to be average. The tea is even Lipton's black tea in bags, some of which do not match the aura of the old hotel.
Finally...Jin Jiang can check the history of the people who have been listed... Characters like Mobutu should not be killed, my God...

Because I like it, I wrote more, forgive me. In general, five-star praise!

msg:A hotel with a great sense of history and culture. The location and environment are really good. Compared with the five-star hotels in the same area, the price/performance ratio is quite good, especially the Jinnan Tower. Although we did not live on the side of the garden, But it’s not bad. It’s very quiet at night, clean, fully automatic toilets, and the date of toiletries is very new. Especially the cotton swabs are made into ear spoons. They are very careful. The dressers are also very good. They want mineral water. Slippers and everything, good attitude. The fly in the oin**ent is that toilet paper, including facial tissues, is too general. In the past, the five-stars used to live basically use the Vida brand. The most uncomfortable thing is that the parking lot is inconvenient to use. There is no elevator. It takes a big circle to get to Jinnan Building. There are free parking spaces in Jinnan Building and the opposite VIP Building, but parking is not allowed, just catching up with these two. The typhoon in Shanghai did cause us a lot of inconvenience. We hope to communicate with the security guards. In special weather conditions, flexibility and accommodation will not work, but it is reasonable to talk to the leader. It seems that no one has seen the leader. Same! The regulations are good, but they must also be humanized. If there is no typhoon and the weather is good, it is absolutely reasonable to drive around in a circle. As a guest, we should definitely cooperate and implement it. Sure enough, Mr. went to drive this morning. Because the wind was too strong, the hotel's umbrella valley was blown off, and most of his body was wet. In short, this kind of historic hotel, like the Martier in Harbin, can be experienced in a lifetime.

The hotel is located in the heart of Shanghai, making it easy to get in and out. This time I stayed in the VIP building suite, which is a genuine 220 square meter (compared to the large virtual standard room area of some five-star hotels), two bedrooms, two living rooms, two bathrooms and a separate study room. The decoration is elegant and attentive with low-key luxury, which is quite amazing. The entire suite is quite large, and the two halls are big enough to hold a party of 15 people without feeling crowded. The front desk management and service staff are also very professional, enthusiastic and comfortable, with the feeling of a top high-end apar**ent. I have stayed in many five-star hotels and high-end apar**ents in the past ten years because of my work. The experience of this stay is the most perfect. From location to room space to hotel decoration to service to hygiene, I undoubtedly surpassed 100 points. The perfect experience. Later, I learned that this VIP building and the north building of another hotel are both historical buildings in Shanghai. They were built around 1930 and were the top hotel apar**ents in Shanghai before the liberation. The residents were all famous celebrities in Shanghai that year.

At about 9:30 in the evening, room 409 for the elderly suddenly The shower was broken and the water spurted out. The old man was soaked and unable to take a bath, so he had to change the room. The sink in our room 419 kept emitting a foul smell. We found the front desk at 10:30 that night. The front desk sent two staff members to open the drain and found that it was all hair and vomit! Very disgusting! ! ! But it was too late that night, the child fell asleep, we had to endure the nausea, smelled the smell, and sleepless all night, we decided to change the room the next morning. At around 10 am the next day, a female lobby manager came to check again and let us change to 619 after confirmation. Since the rooms are the same, we still smelled, so we asked whether we could change one. The manager told us that the room was not available and let us wait until 12 o'clock. Since we had something to do on this trip, we couldn't wait. We returned to the hotel more than 9 o'clock that night, and the hotel arranged suite 322. I thought the nigh**are was over, but I didn't expect more terrible things to come. On the morning of the 18th, we took our children back from the swimming pool and were about to pack up and salute. Suddenly the fire sprinklers in the living room were spraying water like heavy rain. (I don’t know how the hotel’s fire protection standards are met) the entire room and all our salutes. It was like being in the open air, all wet, and the whole process lasted for more than 20 minutes. When we called helplessly, two lobby managers, Fu Yu and Zhao Minghong, came. Our clothes are all wet. Delayed our return trip, the hotel has been delaying us, passive handling! Caused us to be unable to return normally! I hope you all enter this hotel carefully, there is no way to get a five-star rating! Bad review bad review!

The Garden Hotel can only park guests until check-out at 3pm. In other hotels The overall performance of the facilities and service staff is not as good as that of the Garden Hotel. I look forward to improving its soft power!

msg:The location of the hotel is good. There are many restaurants and shopping malls around. Eating is not a problem at all. The hotel provides parking lots. Guests staying in the hotel are parked in the underground parking garage. Remember to ask for a parking ticket when checking out. The parking garage does not find an elevator. On the ground, you need to pay attention to luggage ⚠️, the guest room is still relatively large, about 28 square meters, the bathroom is generally hygienic, and there are many red-brown long hairs of the tenants on the wall of the shower room. The soundproofing in the room is not particularly good. The sound of showering and flushing next door is obvious, but fortunately, there are not many guests on weekdays. The most important point is that the minibar in the room is chargeable! Charges! ⚠️There is no obvious reminder and price list in the room. You will be asked to provide a deposit of 500 yuan when you check in. After deducting the usage fee when you check out, I used 2 bottles of Evian water and a can of ordinary Coca-Cola, and I was charged 80 yuan , This is a bit depressing, I feel inexplicable consumption

It was like walking through a maze for a first time visitor. I finally reached the lobby. The person who checked in at the hotel was so unprofessional. I explained several times who was sharing the same room with whom, but they still couldn't get them together. The room was very clean when we arrived, and there were confiscated beer bottles. The table was not wiped clean. The house smelled like smoke. Even when I moved to another room, the same thing happened. , the bathroom plug and the hair dryer are out of power.

Some small details of the Shanghai hotel are well done, such as the cotton swabs used in the bathroom, one end of which is made into the shape of an "earpick". Some comments: 1. When checking in, the front desk wrote the wrong room number on the room card, leading to the wrong room. The old five-star hotel should not make such a mistake; 2. Although the facilities are a bit old, sanitation should be done The tea is in place, the traces of tea collapse in the teacup are obvious, I hope to improve it!

For example, takeout can only be delivered to the gate of the courtyard. It is still quite far from the hotel to the gate, especially when it rains. Have you considered the inconvenience of the guests? If it is for the safety of the yard, there are several restaurants and other businesses in the yard, and people can enter casually. It is completely allowed to deliver takeaways to hotel lobby doors. If the management is strict and you can only go to the entrance of the hospital, you can refer to the Xingguo Hotel. There are service staff responsible for delivering the food from the door to each room, so the guests do not have to run to get it themselves.
On the other hand, many service staff have a stiff attitude, feel condescending, and are not positive.

As long as it comes to processes related to people, everything will be terrible. I opened the door by myself, but the doorman didn't care; after checking in for half an hour, there were only five or six people, and the front desk was a mess; I left some things in the refrigerator at the front desk, but no one could find them, and I had to find them myself; I was passing by when it rained When I received an umbrella in the auditorium, the foreman laughed at me first; the waiter asked if he wanted to clean the room and told him no, but someone asked again after a while; the staff always kept saying that this is not my business, we don’t have this service, but let things happen. In front of my eyes, and it makes sense. You can see how loose the management behind it is.
I rarely write reviews, but this time I have to:
Shanghai Jin Jiang Hotel is simply the ultimate combination of a bunch of SBs managing a bunch of SBs. Meeting someone from Jinjiang will definitely make you angry.

msg:I usually book this hotel whenever I go to downtown Shanghai, and there are no problems. This time, due to time constraints, I asked when I checked in if I could delay checkout until 2 o'clock the next day. The front desk said that I would need to ask the next morning, so At ten o'clock the next day, I went to the front desk and asked a front desk person who said that the room was full and could not be postponed. I still wanted to try again, so I said that according to international practice, I should be able to apply to the front desk next to me. He immediately replied that this is Shanghai Jinjiang Hotel and there is no international practice. This service is amazing! I have never experienced this kind of service when staying in a hotel! If there had been no such practice last night, the front desk shouldn't have asked me to ask the next day. I've stayed in too many hotels and I've never had customer service say no! This is how the front desk of Jinjiang Hotel seems to feel superior! Don’t believe that you only entertain people from Shanghai? ! I read the reviews carefully. All the negative reviews are for the service. As a long-established service industry, the hotel doesn’t think there is a problem! ! I can accept the reason why there is no delay because the room is full, but I will never accept the nonsense that Jin Jiang Hotel has this rule! Absolutely bad service!

After Ctrip helped to coordinate, the security manager representative of the other party apologized. But I am convinced by the fact that the service industry is like this. I will never go to this experience again.
It is recommended that friends who drive must ask if they can park and how to charge them before parking. If you don’t ask “it’s the guest’s responsibility”, if you don’t accept it, it means “the guest shirks the responsibility”. (The question is how can I raise this question without knowing it? As a guest, what responsibility do I have to bear????). After the insulting language is over, it is like using more insulting money to solve it.
Think twice before you live.

"Will you call me if you have a room in advance?" "There is a business card, you can call and ask." All requests are rejected, and I feel that I don't want guests to check in early , I hope your business is so good that there is no room at all. The front desk reads "Check in after 14:00; check out after 12:00 will be charged a half-day room charge", I hope those guests who check out late will not be charged for the room fee^_^Due to the hurry, they did not check in at the end. , The room rate will be bought as a lesson.

msg:不知道怎麼評選上五星級的，服務非常差！一下車也沒人來拿幫忙拿行李。一開始司機送到了北樓，然後辦理入住被告知是錦楠樓，然後前台説請人帶我去楠樓，前台的人臉也挺臭，但是工作人員出門後就沒管我了！直接去做別的事，還是我請另外一個隨機的工作人員帶領去楠樓，路程大概5-10分鐘，期間也沒有提出要幫忙拿行李（我拎兩個比較大的袋子）。

後來辦完入住説要憑房卡領取洗漱用品，但是那個智能櫃也是壞掉的，上上下下找半天也沒找到那個箱子打開了，後來前台的人直接拿了洗漱用品過來 説智能櫃壞了。那我請問呢？為啥不能直接前台給我？耍住店客人麼？客人時間不是時間？大包小包的還要搞這些有的沒的 不累麼？要做智能化就好好做。

一整個咱們就是説 住的非常無語😓。酒店也不是在路邊的，還要繞一下才能走出酒店，除了location，也沒什麼好誇的。

給了走廊盡頭房間不説，插座、門鎖有很明顯的舊損，地毯大塊臟污，和上半年來時差距很大。而且每天清晨6點樓上準時開始搬動桌子椅子，不知道是不是住在了工作間樓下，很影響休息，故而很失望。

錦江貴賓樓的裝修典雅大氣，維護得很好。因為貴賓樓裏都是套房，一層衹有兩間房，相對安靜。一個套房裡兩個卧室，全家人共享客廳餐廳書房，非常舒適。

服務是老牌國賓館似的服務，熱情周到又很有分寸感。前台的魏女士非常親切貼心。

唯一的缺點是早餐差一些，而且在另外一個樓裏。不過周邊街區太多好吃的，就不在乎這個了。

我們訂的是錦北樓，一下電梯，一股潮濕味，但母親卻聞到了40年前甜蜜的味道。房間裏潮味也很重，被褥，沙發都很潮濕。斑駁的窗户我開都不會開。父親卻有些激動，“窗沒換，你不懂，這樣開……”天哪……真的是古董窗，民國文物……
入住時讓工作人員多加一個早餐，但是他居然沒給我加上，好在第二天早上值班的經理又給我協調了一下，雖然工作人員態度傲慢，沒有按之前的價格，但也算是給我解決了這個問題吧。
曾經的國賓飯店，迎接了100多位國內外的領導人，但説到底也都衹是曾經的輝煌。曾經的國營早已不能適應當下的市場，現在也不過是靠着父母一輩人的回憶和情懷苟延殘喘，試問：如果將來沒有了這些回憶和情懷，錦江飯店，你當如何適應當下，向著未來走去？至少像我這樣的80後是不會買賬的，因為關於你，我衹有耳朵裏的美好，卻是看在眼裡的落後……

出門右邊直走，就是建於1931年著名的蘭心大劇院，再往前就是特別愛吃的一家小館子“蘭心餐館”這次去知道掌櫃老太太80多歲退休在家了，去晚了拼桌也要擠着吃這頓飯，滿滿的回憶

如果對所有都不要求，衹希望地理方便，這個酒店是可以的，而且確實也是鬧中取靜的好地方。
房間隔音效果不好，如果你的隔壁是國際友人，小心不要吵到他，可能他會講英文投訴。但是如果國際友人吵到你，麻煩你多擔待，因為人家是客人。
早餐6點半開始，請在7點以後去使用，因為6點40分煮麪的水還沒有開，熱牛奶也是冷的。
如果提前在線預訂的房間下午3點還沒有打掃出來，可以在前台説需要鐘點房，説不定有。
以上僅為參考，又或許是我都遇上了。
使用攜程訂酒店基本是我的首選，我也會看評論。經過這次的住宿，我想我應該再反省，一定是自己不夠仔細，沒有看到真實的評價。

msg:這次住錦江有點失望，到了房間首先房型一般般，其次晚上還有蚊子，不過可能因為開了窗。第二天早上未經房客同意，酒店派了工人在我們這一層刷油漆，用電鋸起了粉塵，我們嚇得趕緊出門，晚上回來房間有股奇怪的臭味，打電話問前台，也就是換房間，態度比較消極。住兩個晚上，第二晚樓上有人辦婚禮，八九點還在那裡唱歌，特別吵…早餐還行。總之，錦江除了地理位置好其他也就一般般

msg:老錦江一直是我來上海的首選，不是他有多豪華，也不是因為他有多厚重的歷史，其實是特別偏愛他給到的服務，那種無微不至，到家的感覺。這次去，前台給我的感覺，依然如此，很是開心。
但是，三件事情的發生，讓我不由得感歎，第一，是因為疫情，外賣不讓送進來了，要出去取，因為我當時已經洗完澡了，並且衣服也讓我泡上洗了，因為晚上就不想出門了，於是打電話給總機，想麻煩服務員幫忙給取一下送上來，結果被禮貌的拒絕了。沒辦法，穿着睡衣，從錦北樓走到茂名路那個門，還碰上下雨。第二，因為突然想吃生蒜，於是打電話問了一下，總機給轉到送餐部門，然後送餐部門回覆説，有蒜，但就是不給你送。最終，半小時後，在我的投訴下，才給送來。其實他要是態度好點兒，或者直接説沒有蒜，我也就不較勁了。第三，其實跟我沒關係，衹不過是在酒店大門口，看到兩個保安大爺，正在對着外賣員罵罵咧咧，態度蠻橫，那語氣簡直不把外賣小哥當人看，充滿了歧視。雖説因為口罩原因，現在管的都嚴，但作為掛牌五星酒店，能不能態度好一點兒的去溝通交流呢，或者説能不能對任何人都一樣的態度呢，我們住店客人進出，態度就好多了，哎。關鍵的是，我在這住了四天，幾乎每天都有看到保安大爺在對外賣小哥發飆。真的影響形象

msg:220平米大套房。兩卧，客廳餐廳加書房。十分寬敞。陳設雖然略有陳舊，但是絲毫不影響透露出來的年代感。整個建築羣就是對上海歷史的致敬。夜晚窗外的淮海中路高樓林立的景緻印證着現代的發展，很美。服務人員態度和藹專業，同時帶着一些自傲，是我喜歡的上海人的風格。周邊守着國泰，蘭心大劇院和長樂路，每個街角都是老上海的味道，地段無以倫比。

服務員周到有禮。停車免費，就是停車場距離錦北樓有一點點遠。錦北樓明顯好於錦楠樓，外觀漂亮房間面積更大。早餐在兩個樓都有。
可惜早餐品種和檔次一般。但瑕不掩瑜。
帶父母再逛逛淮海路瑞金路茂名南路長樂路，也去了對面的花園飯店和隔壁的新錦江。
錦江飯店是父母一輩眼裡最典雅正宗的五星級。之前從未想到在上海住酒店，現在出行不便，卻成就了帶父母體驗老牌酒店的機會。

根據以前的經驗，和酒店打個招呼説有小朋友生日，酒店方都會特別安排一下，這裏要特別欣賞和平飯店，去年住的，他們事先説會簡單佈置，實際在房間和用餐時得到意外的驚喜，當然這次被錦江一口回絕，好吧，其實也沒什麼，畢竟人家不是非要提供的。
接下來預訂的三間房間一一説明:
房間的插座很少，衞生間沒有電吹風插座，淋浴房有外溢水
給父母的房間裏有一股煙味
最奇葩的是給朋友安排的房間裏晚上十點馬桶溢出，不得不換房

也許是平常接待的都是國家元首或各種大人物，面對我們普通住客，錦楠樓幾位門衞服務生的冷漠臉似乎有點配不上這家大上海老牌五星級大酒店的形象。

不過要批評的是前台一位貌似是主管的女士，當我入住中途禮貌詢問銀卡會員是否能延遲退房的時候，説因為我是在攜程訂而不是在錦江官方渠道訂所以不能享受，並勉強説最多給你延遲到2點。其實延遲到幾點不是問題，酒店有自己的規則，但是主管全程的服務態度挺差的，反而其他同事比較好，讓我理解怎麼當上的主管？
去上海我都會首選錦江飯店，老宅子很寧靜舒服，但這個真的要改進。

msg:酒店雖然有年頭，但是任然乾淨，沒有很陳舊的感覺，服務員也是經過嚴格培訓過的，服務很熱情，雖然衹住了一天，但是已經留下了很好影響。交通方便，環境優美，房間裏很温馨，很滿意
