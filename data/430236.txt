msg:This is the worst 5 star hotel experience I have ever had. I communicated with the hotel in advance about the goods to be collected, explaining that there may be a lot of goods, and the staff also replied that there is no quantity limit. After arriving, there was an older woman in casual clothes, maybe a supervisor. Without asking, she kept scolding me for having too many goods but without communicating with the hotel in advance. I immediately said that I could provide the information from the previous staff's reply. The woman knew He justified his mistake and walked away without looking at the evidence.

This is really the first time I have seen a hotel that scolds guests at the first word. Even if the hotel staff made a mistake in previous communication, they can still respond politely and there is no need to have a bad attitude. The hotel has many private rooms for tour groups, so it should not be rare to do business with individual travelers.

In addition, the room decoration is very old, the electric system is broken and cannot be used, and the hair dryer is also broken. There are a lot of good hotels to choose from. I will not come back to a hotel with such a bad attitude next time.

The front desk clerk was kind and courteous, but the parking lot still couldn't recognize the Hong Kong license plate. It was a bit inconvenient to bother the front desk staff to open the gate remotely! The breakfast is average, and the selection of Western bread is slightly insufficient!
The hotel's underground connection to the shopping mall is very convenient. I went to Tianyuan Four Seasons that night and had durian and coconut claypot. It was unique and delicious, and it was very memorable!

I am very satisfied with the hotel overall and it is worth recommending!

There is no power cord for mobile phones. You need to bring your own adapter. The toilet faucet kept leaking, and the soundproofing of the room was poor. I could hear people coming in and out and closing doors all night long, which was not a good idea. In all of them, you can smell a "sleep" smell as soon as you enter it, and there is no irritation at all. The breakfast in the hotel has few choices and tastes very average. There is no air-conditioning. You will feel wet and sweaty after eating. There are also mosquitoes and flies flying around to accompany you while you are having breakfast. It is seriously not worth the money.

After all, they are the successors of Crowne Plaza. Some details of the room, such as the anti-collision *****s, are spotlessly clean, reflecting the current operator's intentions. Breakfast is good, not much variety, but tastes good. For such a good price, it’s worth it!

msg:I came to Xiaolan for a business trip and chose to stay in this hotel. Although the hotel is quite old, the lobby is very impressive, and the service from the lady at the front desk is also warm and courteous. The main reason is that the room is big enough, spacious and bright, clean, and the equipment and facilities are well maintained. Especially the bedding feels clean and comfortable. I had a good night's sleep and felt pretty good.

During the busy time for breakfast in the morning, can some of the breakfast seats for individual tourists be allocated for us to use? I don’t want to eat there anymore when I see the crowds of people.

msg:1. The room has a musty smell, and the quilt and bed are all damp
2. I didn’t know what was vibrating every few minutes when I lived on the backside, and then changed to the sunny side. As a result, the air conditioner hummed at a low frequency. The key point is that I didn’t turn on the air conditioner.
3. The most disgusting thing came, I cleaned up the room and took away my things, a charger, a plush toy Strawberry Bear, they took it away and didn't tell me, the key point I didn't check out. I called the front desk to ask, and the front desk said to ask, and then said that the charger was found, and I said where is the bear? The front desk said, it depends on whether your toys are there, I f***ing thousands of miles to blackmail you. Then I searched again, I just waited, and I didn’t take the initiative to contact me to report the progress. I had to chase after it all the time. After a long time, I told me that it was too late to contact anyone. It was early tomorrow morning, but I had to take the initiative in the morning. I contacted and asked about the result. This hotel is too rubbish. I took the initiative to chase the whole process. It is not one of the most rubbish hotels I have ever stayed in.

I originally booked a superior room, but when I checked in, because the hotel received many Hong Kong tour groups, the room was quite full. The front desk was very considerate to help me I upgraded to a senior suite for free, and I felt very warm immediately. The room in the suite was very large, the sheets and quilts were clean and tidy, and the bathroom was equipped with a bathtub. The whole environment was quiet and comfortable, and I had a pleasant night

msg:This is my first review as a diamond card member, because I can't imagine how bad this crown can be. Due to the rain on the 5.2 holiday, it was temporarily changed to Zhongshan Daxin Crown. Because it is both old and young, a large family can eat, drink and have fun in the hotel. As a 20-year senior member of IHG, I have never been disappointed with the hotels under the group. Pass. But this one is just horrible. First of all, no one checks the body temperature, itinerary card, etc. when entering the door, that is, anyone can enter at will, takeaway, and there is no check for the casual staff. The front desk checks in and asks if it is possible to upgrade. The answer is no, I said I am an IHG diamond member , the front desk said it couldn’t be recognized, I only had my mobile phone to open my membership, upgraded, and told me that she was the only one at the front desk of the entire hotel, there was no security guard, no other front desk staff, because the business was not good, everyone else was on vacation. In the afternoon, the child wanted to swim, but was told by the hotel that the swimming pool was closed. He wanted to go to the executive floor for a drink, but was told that the executive floor was closed. All restaurants and lounges in the entire hotel were closed, so he had to go out to find food in the heavy rain. I went out to eat at night, but the license plate could not be recognized, so I couldn’t go out. After waiting for a long time, someone came to manually open the gate. When I came back after eating, I was stopped by a man at the front desk and asked everyone to come over and take pictures for identification. I wanted to report the situation to him. And feeling, he actually said don't say anything now, you do face verification one by one in order, and then do your own thing after finishing, without a word of apology or embarrassment during the whole process. Shocked that Crown would hire such staff. The next morning, only a small section was opened for breakfast, basically only noodle stalls and cold cuts. The child wanted to eat bread and asked the waiter for butter. The waiter actually said that due to the impact of the epidemic, butter cannot be imported into the country. Is this the reason? When we are all ****! This terrible experience really brought us a shadow of Crown Crown. It is recommended that Ctrip also do a proper investigation when choosing a partner! Such a great holiday ruined! Will never stay at this hotel again.

1It rains with an umbrella, and there is no etiquette to help open the door and receive people in,
2 The fat girl at the front desk is neither hot nor cold, and looks like you can't live in love,
3 There is a strange smell when I go up to the hotel. I don’t know if it’s because of the humid weather in Guangdong. The smell is very strong. The rooms and corridors,
4. In the evening, I called the front desk and arranged for someone to come over to wash the bathtub. The day before yesterday, I said that our bathtubs are all disinfected in advance, so you can use them with confidence. The guest room may not be there.
5 There is no waiter and reception in the gym, let alone ask the waiter in the sauna room, the towels are placed randomly, if you ask, take it yourself, the waiter is beating the king.
Overall, this hotel is a bit disgusting, the service is poor and the equipment is outdated. Not recommended.

另外酒店大堂進門要出示粵康碼跟行程卡，可以理解.但是為什麼進去之後前台入住還得再來一遍？
酒店設施稍顯舊.感覺已經不如附近4星的歡朋.

msg:在小欖這個小鎮這個酒店唯一可取之處就是地處鬧市，交通比較方便，其他硬件比不上希爾頓歡朋酒店，早餐種類豐富多彩，床上用品洗漱用品礦泉水飲品比大信皇冠假日酒店這個所謂的五星級酒店高級很多，還可以洗衣烘乾直接穿，大信皇冠假日酒店早餐簡直可憐得很，又不可以自助洗衣，床上用品破舊不堪，礦泉水是冰露，連如家漢庭都不如，都不知道哪裡來的底氣，入住查個不停，24小時核酸，健康碼，行程卡，填資料，拍照，整套下來將近半小時，更奇葩的是房間沒什麼東西還要收三百元錢按金，這個是怕客人把你們浴缸搬走嗎？搞笑得很！

msg:真的不知道網上那些好評哪裡來的，晚上22:00到了中山，因為是五星品牌選擇了這個酒店。做核算入住已經凌晨了，大堂蠻好的，進入到房間一股陳舊的味道，像是90年代的，給人一種非常不舒服臟的感覺，房間連瓶水都沒有，最關鍵的是，洗過澡後，用了毛巾，我和家人皮膚全部發癢，聯繫前台想要退房，前台給換了個套房，這次洗澡沒敢用毛巾了。總之這個酒店給我的感覺就是太陳舊了，不衞生。根本達不到五星，也就經濟型。還不如快捷酒店，最起碼沒有味道。

大堂就有星巴克，酒店是與一個mall相連，這個mall也是大信的，檔次和氛圍略微城鄉結合了一些，隨便吃點東西很方便。
酒店價格非常超值。但早餐品種非常有限，補充也不夠及時，早餐這一方面的確與其他的Crowne Plaza沒法比。
