msg:A very good hotel on top of Nanjing Lukou International Airport terminal T2. The hotel lobby entrance is on the departures level (level 3) of T2, only a 3-minute walk inside the terminal from the check-in counters . My room was very spacious and well-equipped. The only negative was that the room temperature was too warm, and the air-conditioning wasn’t working properly so it didn’t make it much cooler.

The service was top-notch, with the staff going above and beyond to make my stay comfortable. The combination of a prime location, stunning views, and exceptional service truly made my experience at Pullman Nanjing Airport Hotel amazing. Highly recommended!"

msg:I was really surprised by the behavior and professionalism of the reception of the ladies and her male manager on the executive floor.
They look at you in surprise, say nothing. Then just say/gesture 'sit down'.
Don't offer anything, don't say what you can take, am I too early, aren't you ready? Worse reception and hospitality cannot be imagined.
The male manager makes an attempt, what do you think of our service? He apparently has no regard for what he is even doing, given the attitude of the ladies at the door.
Then a female manager passes by. This is indeed alert, quickly sees what is missing and supplements it. This person understands what guests want if they wish to use the executive floor.
The joke is that when you are about to check out and you are in a hurry to catch your flight, you get all kinds of questions about what you thought of your stay. It is better to do this earlier.

One more thing. I was privileged to get the same room the last two times. Both times the sink was clogged. A technician arrives and manages to drain the water with an emergency solution, but after two hours the same problem occurs. The dirty drippings and splashes are all around the sink and he cleans it with the towels that I am supposed to use to wash my face.

I am really surprised by such service, which is apparently normal for this hotel brand.
Maybe next time I will make time to have a quiet chat with various staff.

Unfortunately, the door to the balcony can not be opened due to its vicinity to the Airport. (Beyond the hotel's control.) In the morning the temperature of the room showed still 24 degrees.

The room was clean, bed comfortable, AC strong and shower good; basically everything I look for in a hotel. The only downside was that there was a lovely big balcony that couldn’t even be accessed; not sure why you’d build a hotel with balconies if they can’t be used. It seems strange, especially considering my room faced the outside of the airport, and not the runway. I would definitely stay again if I had an early flight or arrived late at night.

When I arrived service was on point💯, staff helped me check-in quickly and easily and even assisted with all my heavy bags. I was also upgraded to a bigger room which was great, but on Ctrip I initially opted for late check-out (14:00). 

When I got to the room I was a bit disappointed because:

1. I was looking for a button to drawn the curtains until I found it need to open them manually LOL. 

2. I tried to open the balcony door as to get a better image of the planes, unfortunately it was locked which completely defeats the purpose of a room upgrade. 

3. The carpets were dirty all throughout the room and hallway. My room looked as though white paint had been spilled on the carpet🤷

4. Power points to charge electronics are so inconvenient. So outdated and didn't at all fit my electric needs. Also, I had to charge one phone on one end of the room and another at the other end, because inconvenient! 

5. Upon leaving I called the service center to assist with my luggage again. Unfortunately, when I called the lady didn't quite understand and said she'd call back. I waited for a call that wasn't returned until I decided to drag and carry 5 heavy luggage bags on my own to check-out. 

For a well known hotel I wasn't expecting this. I feel I could've gotten more value for money elsewhere but I specifically booked this for airport convenience. So sad!! I don't even have photograph, because there was literally nothing worth posting.

The hotel is located between Terminals 1 and 2, and it is very convenient to go anywhere.

The hotel upgraded to an executive floor with an executive lounge. The dinner was great. I have seen the executive lounges of some hotels, and I am really satisfied with the lounge of this transit hotel.
There is also a gym and a swimming pool! It is really different from Shanghai Airport for the same price.

The staff YlLlA and Ella provided great service. Next time, I will definitely not go to Shanghai if there are flights from Nanjing 😀

Bad review: I burned the cup because I wanted to drink tea. When I used the small bar spoon 🥄, it was used by the previous guest. It was disgusting and I threw it aside. The hotel shower connection leaked. I don’t know how to use it. When I returned the room card to the front desk staff, he didn’t look up or respond. It was so rude. I think it was redundant to say hello and thank you.
Objective: I have stayed in Pullman and InterContinental many times before. I don’t know when this Pullman started to collect a deposit.

I have stayed at a Pullman in Shanghai before, and I felt very bad at that time. The room was simple and not up to the five-star standard. I didn't expect to be amazed by the Pullman at the airport this time.

The hotel front desk upgraded us to the member elite floor. When we arrived at the 8th floor, we were immediately attracted by the lighting shape of the middle courtyard, which left a great impression.

The room is super large, and the window is the airport area where you can hear the plane. The gradient color of the glass door of the hotel's bathroom is very beautiful. In addition, the toothpaste in the hotel room's toiletries is actually packaged in paper and plastic, and the drinking water is also packaged in paper and plastic.

The hotel breakfast is very rich, and both Chinese and foreigners can find breakfast food that suits them.

Passengers who need to catch an early flight or arrive late are strongly recommended to stay in this hotel.

The speed and attitude of the front desk were ok, but for guests pushing luggage, no one helped to send the luggage to the room (there was still one in 2019), and there was not even any guidance. You can imagine the resistance of dragging the suitcase on the carpet. The poor sound insulation near the airport is inevitable, but the next room is not soundproofed for talking, closing the door, and passing by, so I almost didn't sleep well all night. The quality of the room service dishes is poor, the shrimp is extremely not fresh, and I don't know how long it has been frozen.

The front desk service was proactive and enthusiastic, and the two rooms booked were proactively coordinated to two adjacent rooms. When I made the reservation, I asked for a quiet room, but my children wanted to watch the planes, so I changed to a room facing the airport. The room change went smoothly and quickly. If you have sleep requirements, try not to be near the airport. The sound is not too loud. If you sleep with headphones and listen to a novel, you won't feel the sound of the plane. There is a children's amusement park on the fifth floor of the hotel, and there are many sofa seats next to it, which is suitable for spending time with children. There is a hotel food stall on the left hand side when you go out of the hotel. It closes at 8pm. There are big meat buns, corn, lobster meat mooncakes, bread, various cakes, drinks, soy milk, etc. I was a little hungry at 4pm and bought meat buns and lobster. The whole family was full of meatloaf and drinks. The child especially liked the big meatloaf, and even though she didn’t have a big appetite, she also ate a whole one. During dinner time, you are invited to enjoy the automatic meal in the executive lounge on the ninth floor. The main dishes, hot dishes, wine, desserts and drinks are exquisite and delicious. Be sure to try the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants next time you stay.

The beautiful woman at the front desk (sorry, I forgot her name) helped us move in at 22:30 on the evening of February 13th. Arrange the room thoughtfully.
The next morning (February 14th), we found that our child's hat was missing. The beautiful and handsome man at the front desk helped us find it in the lobby. His patient attitude made us feel moved and warmed.

msg:Being within the airport is the only advantage.
1. After opening the small refrigerator, there are yellow stains on the corners of the partitions, and the partitions fall off, which is a bit disgusting.
2. The bedside chandelier is too short and is directly above the bedside button. If you accidentally bump your head, my family has bumped into it twice.
3. When checking in, the front desk asked if I had brought any toothbrushes. I said I didn’t bring any, so they threw three handfuls for us (only toothbrushes and toothpaste). When I took a shower, I found that there was no comb or shower cap.
4. Halfway through breakfast, I went to add dishes. When I came back, I found that the aunt had taken away all the tableware. There were not many guests at all after 9 o'clock in the morning. At first glance, there were only 15-20 people dining. So the restaurant is overwhelmed? So eager to take away the tableware I haven't used yet

Anyway, 78 hundred rooms are not good except in the airport.

msg:It was my child’s birthday, and because he loves airplanes, I took him to the airport hotel to celebrate.

The hotel has been open for a long time, but the facilities are well maintained and are much newer than most old hotels. The location is also very convenient, between T1 and T2. There is Starbucks and Lawson outside the security check of T2, as well as a row of snack stalls.

The room arranged by the hotel has a good view. There are two rows of parking spaces right outside the window. The children had a lot of fun (unfortunately, due to airport control, the balcony door cannot be opened). The room supplies are quite unique. Toothbrushes, combs and razors all have wooden handles and are very high-quality. The disposable slippers feel very comfortable, better than most five-star hotels I have stayed at.

There are not too many breakfast categories, but children under 12 years old have free breakfast. This is so conscientious and really child-friendly. The Western restaurant on the 3rd floor only has a la carte dinner, and there are not many categories, and the taste is average. The executive lounge has afternoon tea and dessert Set Meal, which is very good. There are not many snacks during happy hour, maybe because there are few customers. . . Generally speaking, the catering aspect is weaker than that of similar hotels, but considering it is an airport hotel, it is expected.

Finally, I would like to thank the hotel for the fruits, desserts and drinks provided (as shown in the picture, I brought my own red wine and cake). The children were very happy. I would also like to thank the beautiful lady in the executive lounge (forgot to read her work badge), who thoughtfully helped the child open the balcony door and allowed the child to take very satisfying photos.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay and the children said they would come back in the future.

First of all, the hotel brand is already a basic guarantee, and the location is between the two terminals. It is very convenient to walk there in a few minutes. The lady at the front desk helped upgrade the executive room. You must know that Pullman's bedding has many different choices, including the material of the pillow core, and the sound insulation is very good. Although it is inside the airport, it is not very noisy.
The breakfast includes Western-style bread, cakes, coffee, Chinese-style wonton noodles, porridge, and fruit desserts. I took a leisurely swim in the rooftop swimming pool and the water temperature was good and comfortable. I didn’t have time to go to the gym.
When checking out, the front desk manager and Uncle Max also helped explain the route and called the car directly to pick me up at the hotel gate. Thank you! 👏

Next comes the drawback.
1. When checking in, the front desk said that they would upgrade to a deluxe king room for free. It turned out that the room was indeed facing the sun, but the balcony could not be opened. There was no ventilation source in the whole room except the door, and I had to endure the sound of planes taking off in the middle of the night.
2. We had a baby, and we were going to turn off the lights at nine o'clock in the evening to put the baby to bed. We found that the lights were broken and couldn't be turned off at all. At first, I thought there was something wrong with my method. I kept trying and found that it didn't work at all, so I just I called the front desk and asked her to help me check if there was something wrong with my method. As a result, I was called directly to a repairman uncle. The uncle came in with his ladder and started repairing the lights. Is your hotel okay? Our children are going to bed, and you ask someone to fix the lights. Am I paying for my house to watch you fix the lights? It made our kids cry all the time. Really nerves. When the hotel front desk knew that the light was broken, didn't they change our room as soon as possible? As a result, someone came to repair the lamp, and it took half an hour. It was not repaired in the end, so I asked my uncle to pull the light switch.
3. We didn’t lock the door at first. When the guy who sent the light repair guy went out, I was going to lock the door. I found that the lock was also broken and couldn’t be turned. Fortunately, I pushed an airport car to stop me. door.
4. That night I went to the hotel front desk to report the light issue, and when I left the next day, I gave our children a doll from their hotel. This was what made me most angry. What a dirty doll you gave me! ! Our child liked it very much and held it all the way. However, when he got home, he started to break out in rashes all over his body. When he went to the hospital, the doctor said it might be an allergy or the baby was not clean.
5. There are also various shortcomings. The hotel facilities are outdated; the carpets in the rooms are not clean; there is a children's playground mat on the 5th floor that is faded and the white socks are dyed green. I originally wanted to endure it, thinking that my baby was having a lot of fun, so I gave my baby a doll as a gift when I left the store so as not to leave a bad review, but it turned out that my baby got sick. I was really speechless! !
I spent six to seven hundred to live in a room with a broken light, a door that couldn't be locked, and my baby even had a rash! ! What an unfortunate hotel! !

msg:The room layout is decent and grand. In my opinion, the hotel is right next to the airport terminal, with the tarmac right outside the window, but it's not noisy. The most satisfying thing for me is that the big bed is so comfortable. It’s rare in recent years that I can sleep from 11 o’clock at night until almost dawn. I am very satisfied!

msg:My children went to school in SF in the United States, so I booked this hotel while transiting in Nanjing. First of all, the location is right inside the airport, in the middle of T1 and T2. It is very convenient for boarding, especially if you have heavy luggage. Secondly, the service is very good. If you book a parent-child room, the hotel will call first to ask if it is a boy or a girl. Decorate the room; in addition, the airport is right outside the room, and you can see the planes parked outside when you have breakfast, but the sound insulation effect is very good, and it is very quiet to rest at night. The water was stopped for a while in the morning, and the hotel sent a doll as an apology. The overall feeling is very good.

To be honest, the environment is good, the sound insulation is very good, and the beauties and handsome men at the front desk are all nice. The most hateful thing is the rest area on the right side of the front lobby on the third floor (Figure 1). When I checked in at the front desk, the children dragged their suitcases and sat in the rest area for a while, but the waitress rushed out fiercely, saying that they could not sit here without spending money. I don't know what kind of guests this rest area is for? After a few days of playing, the overall experience of Nanjing is not good, especially bad! ! ! All hotels are expensive, much more expensive than hotels with the same conditions in Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai.

It is said to be a five-star hotel. It’s the first time I’ve lived in a five-star hotel when I grow up. I am still a little bit excited about the first-class hotel, and I am also full of curiosity about the hotel! From the moment I entered the door, it gave people a very high-end feeling, and I saw a lot of bears, and they were so cute! Then I went to the front desk to check in. The young lady at the front desk was also very warm and gentle! It was also very considerate to tell me the breakfast time the next day and ask if I needed daily necessities such as toothpaste. Fortunately, I brought them all. This is very considerate! Then he told me how to get to the room. I took the room card and walked to my room. The hotel floor is quite high, and there is also a gym and a swimming pool. Unfortunately, I didn’t bring a swimsuit. I can only experience it next time. Looking at the swimming pool The water is quite clean, and the gym equipment is also quite complete, which is very good. The sanitation in the room is still very good, for people like me who love cleanliness, it's very good! You can also see the tarmac from the room, hahahaha I'm looking forward to it, after all, it's my first business trip by plane! Looking forward to the next experience, come to live again, and bring my swimsuit again hahaha
Facilities: very complete!
Hygiene: Very clean, very good for a clean freak like me!
Environment: Gives a very comfortable feeling! a**osphere! tidy!
Service: From the moment you enter the door, someone guides you to the front desk to go through the formalities, and the young lady at the front desk is also very enthusiastic!
 Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay!

The hotel gym and swimming pool are very well equipped. For people like me who love fitness Simply gospel. The location of the hotel is also very good, in the middle of the terminal building, it is very convenient to travel. The room was big and clean, the bed was very comfortable, everything was perfect. I will continue to experience it next time!

msg:1. It takes a long time to check in, the reason is that there is a problem with the system
And the service attitude is very perfunctory, which may prevent unpleasantness with the guests, so the silent mode is adopted
2. I booked this hotel because I saw a balcony where I could see the airport, but the balcony door was locked, and the photos were all fake
3. As a hotel, the hot water for bathing is not hot enough, and the water pressure is still very low. The top sprinkled with cold water, I thought the water pressure was not enough at night, but the next morning, the water pressure was still very low
4. The air conditioner suddenly switched off in the middle of the night, and it was hot and sweaty in the morning

5. The most frightening thing is that even if the toothbrush is not equipped with toothpaste, the brush bleeds out, and the blood flow does not stop

feel it yourself, toothache


The most terrible thing is the toothbrush,

When deducting the parking fee, hehe, I seriously suspect that the finance and security of the Pullman store and individual leaders jointly deducted the parking fee. The parking fee is 6 days. It’s the personal account in the nearby Pullman called Pullman. Oh, it’s the first time this happens in a five-star hotel. Normally, it’s paid to the group. I’m only willing to pay one night’s parking fee for two nights. I’ve given 5 before. 2 days, the old customer is very disappointed, goodbye

msg:There is nothing worse, the worst. In order to make it easier to travel the next day, I made several calls to the front desk to confirm that the hotel had a chess and card room that was open for business. I was told that there was a chess and card room, and after we went there, we were taken around. A small dark room, the external environment is dirty and messy, and the interior is also messy and messy. There are no services and no facilities. The key is that the person who pressed the bill while we were playing cards was afraid that we would skip the bill, so he came in to remind us later. We checked out once and came in to remind him once. We told him that we didn’t know what time the payment would be and how to settle the bill. After we finished, we contacted him and told him our number, but he still kept coming in to remind us. There was no basic service at all. There is tea and no fruit plate. The checkout is a five-star price, 2,400 yuan a night. The breakfast in the morning is the same as that of an express hotel. The variety is pitiful. If you don’t have the ability, don’t stay in a hotel near the airport. I have stayed in hotels near the airport so many times. It's not that bad. It's too bad.

When arriving at Lukou Airport, turn left directly at the exit and follow the signs to the T2 Passenger Terminal. The hotel is easy to find and the location is very conspicuous. The hotel looks new, has a comfortable environment and convenient transportation. There is a convenience store nearby, and you can take the subway to anywhere in Nanjing by going downstairs to the first floor. I booked a double bed room, and the front desk enthusiastically gave me a free upgrade. They also thoughtfully gave me dental kits for the children, and added pillows and quilts. The room has a large bathtub that my daughter loves and a capsule coffee machine that I love very much. The bed in the room was very comfortable to sleep on and the room was very clean. You can book breakfast at the front desk for 98 yuan per person. Children are free. The breakfast is very rich and you can see the planes on the tarmac through the floor-to-ceiling windows. In short, it is a very suitable hotel for family travel! highly recommended!

msg:This time I passed by Lukou Airport on a business trip. On the way back, I saw a very cute dining car at the entrance of the Pullman Hotel. The dining car is a combination of Chinese and Western food. On one side are super big meat buns, and on the other side there are hamburgers and cola. It is very characteristic of the combination of Eastern and Western cultures. Seeing that the price is very affordable and conscientious, a meat bun is only 6 yuan, which is very down-to-earth and provides a particularly good service for people traveling. Hotel facilities are also very good, the room is very large. The service of Cecilia and Roxy at the front desk is also very good👍

msg:1. Environment: Same as the promotional pictures of the hotel, the a**osphere is spacious, the apron is outside the balcony, and the corridor bridge and the planes parked can be seen. The sound insulation of the room is very good, and the noise of the plane is not loud. This is also the overnight hotel for the crew.
Because this trip is an early flight and I brought the elderly, I booked this hotel purely because of the short distance and the convenience of taking the plane. It is in the middle of T1 and T2 terminals, and you can walk to the check-in counters and ground elevators (flat elevators) in a few minutes on both sides. I pushed the luggage cart all the way to the room. Spend the money and buy a close range.

2. Service: Regardless of the front desk or the guest room, the service staff are very enthusiastic and have a good attitude. After the anti-epidemic policy was lifted, the number of guests became even rarer. Except for the crew, there were hardly a few residents. This time I was upgraded to a business room.

3. Hygiene: clean, absolutely trustworthy. There is also a small anti-epidemic gift bag in the room (including masks, alcohol disinfectant spray, and disposable disinfectant, but they are flammable items and cannot be brought on the plane), and I forgot to take pictures.

4. Facilities: The room is equipped with a star hotel, with a small refrigerator, an ironing board, an iron, and a bathtub. There is a gym on the 7th floor, which is open. It's just that I'm used to living in smart hotels recently (switching lights, curtains, TV, etc. are all voice-activated), but there is no such thing here, and it feels a bit inconvenient. Hope to improve it.

5. You can park for free when you check in, and the car is parked at the entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient. When leaving the car, go to the front desk and ask for a release ticket.

For flying lovers, it happens that the plane parked on the tarmac directly opposite the room I stayed in this time is the flight I took the next morning. Hahaha, the mattress and bedding are very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff It's not bad. Manager Du's service is friendly. Check-in and check-out procedures are very simple and fast. The room is very large. The breakfast style is okay. Having breakfast facing the apron is not bad. The scenery is also good. It's suitable for guests who catch an early flight

After exiting the station, follow the signs to the third floor, and you will see the small door of pullman, which is not far from Starbucks and Luo Sensheng. The decoration of the lobby is quite gorgeous, and it feels like a high-end hotel. There is a rest area on the left to rest.

The front desk is well received, the room is huge, and the price is not expensive.
The hotel is very empty, it feels like there are no other guests.
It's just that the facilities are a little old...but this should be the best choice near the airport.

The location of the hotel is good. If you can get a good night's sleep by plane, there is absolutely no problem in choosing this hotel, because it is only a few minutes walk. The hotel facilities are well maintained, after all, it has been opened for several years according to the introduction. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, if you have any need to tell them, they will try their best to help you solve it. Still a hotel worth recommending to everyone.

So no matter which terminal you go to, it only takes 3-5 minutes to walk there. Entering the hotel to check nucleic acid is more serious. I also entered the door and filled out a few documents before entering, and the epidemic prevention work was very good. The two front desk staff, Manager Li and Miss Chen, are really enthusiastic. He gave me a detailed introduction to the various business premises of the hotel and also upgraded my room. You can see the airport terminal, which is quite special. Because the check-out time was earlier the next day, there was no time to experience other hotel facilities. Have the opportunity to experience it again.

The hotel is right at the airport, and it is also a rare experience to have breakfast and watch the plane schedule. It's a pity that the balcony door is not allowed to open. But understandable.

It's convenient wherever you go. It is especially suitable for those who catch an early flight and land on a night shift. This time I am sending a friend to Frankfurt. Stayed for one night because the plane took off very late. The experience is still very good. The room facilities are very good, especially the mattress is very comfortable to sleep on. Breakfast the next day was also good. It's still a good choice to go to the plane in the future.

首先酒店環境無可挑剔，地處人來人往的T1T2客運大樓之間，酒店卻十分寧靜，服務也非常棒。感謝酒店給我們升至行政樓層並享受行政待遇。
我們在酒廊吃了下午茶和晚餐，最快樂的插曲是品酒，品着世界各國名酒，回憶着我們在各國旅行的快樂時光，真是happy time。酒廊的兩位工作人員：ELLA和CHAI提供了非常細緻周到的服務，感謝他們。
游泳池也很棒，玻璃天棚倒映着頂燈和波光粼粼，讓仰泳的我彷彿欣賞着璀璨銀河一般亦幻亦真，很特別的體驗。
感受是如此完美，以至於讓我決定：以後可以創造機會多住住祿口機場鉑爾曼（比如可以特地訂早班機或晚班機）。

先説説酒店的工作人員吧，一進門就有小哥哥幫忙拉行李，也有女經理（不確定是不是經理，但是笑容很輕切）在大堂問候，讓人緩解了路途的疲憊。前台的小姐姐也很可愛，應該是實習生，也很熟練的辦理的入住。值得一提，酒店響應環保，所以塑料製品基本上沒有的。辦理手續之後，還是那位女經理，將我引領至電梯口，中間跟我簡單介紹了酒店。以為是位老員工了，瞭解下來，才來一個多月，值得表揚。
另外酒店的也有很多巧思和打卡的地方，房間不錯的。唯一的遺憾就是陽台打不開。
雖然衹是為了早上多睡幾個小時而選擇的酒店，但是也得到了很不錯的入住體驗。下次有機會再見啦～

希望能夠在預訂的時候給一個容易記住的地址。 房間很大， 不錯。 在日本呆久了這樣的房間就相當闊氣了。 狗頭。

The overall design style of the hotel is very unique and I like it very much. Of course, the hotel's two younger brothers, Richard and David, are very enthusiastic about their service. They helped me upgrade my room type and helped my family arrange luggage delivery. Although the hotel is in the terminal building, the sound insulation effect is really good. I can't hear the sound of planes taking off and landing at night. The bedding in the room is also very clean and tidy, so my family and I had a good night's sleep! The hotel also has a gym and swimming pool that are really great. I will continue to choose it next time I travel. It is worth recommending!

酒店在兩個客運大樓之間，下飛機十點多直接辦入住。
打開房間窗簾就可以看到很多飛機。而且，隔音做的很好一點都不吵。
唯一不好的，就是我覺得早餐價格有點偏高了，早上辦理128一位。提前前台辦98一位。感覺確實高了。
早餐環境確實還可以。
酒店除了早餐價格太高以後，其他都還可以

環境給5分：前台小樑升級了房型，陽台有座椅，房間內可以直接看飛機起降。我屬於睡眠特別特別淺那種，以為會睡不着，但11:00過後真的沒什麼飛機了，安睡整晚

这家酒店在机场2个航站樓的中間坐飞机非常放便五分鐘不到就走到航站樓了。
环境：非常不错
卫生：非常好
服务：服务员前台門口保安也很有耐心幫忙解决問题
设施：房間设备好，床也夠大

有要在机场住酒店的话非常推荐

msg:飛機延誤臨時決定住在這裏，完全超出期待，特別好的一個酒店。前台和禮賓熱情的幫助我解決行程碼的問題，進入客房後被大陽台和近在咫尺的飛機起落驚呆了。這應該是我住過的最隔音的酒店客房，關上陽台門連飛機聲都聽不到。房間很乾凈，晚上找客房服務員要東西也送的特別及時。白天打掃衞生的阿姨特別nice，一看就是受到特別好培訓和管理的。
