msg:The Sitechi Hotel is located in Chedun Town, Songjiang District. It only takes 3 to 5 minutes to walk to Shanghai Film and Television Park. The overall design of the hotel is like the famous century-old Wukang Building, with vivid and bright colors and classic and smooth matching. The room is very new, with a capsule coffee machine, quiet air conditioning, and warm wind. The bedding is comfortable, and the bedside and other sockets are equipped with USB ports. The bathroom is fully equipped with a Dyson hair dryer and an automatic flush toilet, and the bath water is hot and the water flows smoothly. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, exquisite and delicious. Checking in to the hotel also gives you a free ticket to the Film and Television Park, which is very cost-effective. 👍The most praised thing is the hotel's service. The smile is very warm, the operation is very meticulous, thinking about what we think, and creatively solving some of our weird requirements. 😃😃😃It's a great hotel, I will recommend it to my friends and will come again next time. 👍

1️⃣ The facilities in the room are reasonably set up: the bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and the shower equipment and makeup mirror are quite user-friendly.

2️⃣ The service is very good: I am very picky about pillows during pregnancy. I asked the front desk and found that in addition to ordinary pillows, there are also buckwheat pillows and memory pillows to choose from.

3️⃣ Breakfast is ordered and tastes good.

There is a high-tech screen on the ceiling of the first floor, which shows everything from humanities to design, giving you a VVVIP trea**ent.
The front desk upgraded the room type. The decoration and supplies in the room are really attentive. The bedding is very comfortable. The welcome fruit, capsule coffee, and high-end electrical appliances are very colorful.
The hotel also has very special projects such as performances. You must experience them next time you come.
Special praise for brother Kevin, who has a good attitude, is handsome, kind, and patient.

I look forward to its subsequent development. The hotel is separated from the Shanghai Film and Television Base by a wall. Brothers and sisters who like to experience film and television can stay here. I look forward to the hotel and the guests being able to role-play in the future, which will be even more interesting. The waiters can consider serving in the standard costumes of famous film and television, which will definitely have a good effect😊

Hygiene: The bedding and public areas are very clean, no spider webs and garbage in the dead corners of hygiene are found, and the tidying makes people feel relaxed and happy. The hygienist of this hotel should be very dedicated

Environment: It is right next to the film and television park, which is quite convenient. The film and television park is also very busy, with many people bustling around. You can also change your clothes and take pictures. There are some performances, and there is also the interpretation of Shikumen Auntie Xue, which is a plus

Service: From the security guard at the door helping with luggage, to the front desk warmly welcoming us and sending us to the elevator entrance, introducing places to eat, drink and have fun along the way, to the professional and meticulous ordering and serving of dishes by the restaurant waiters, I feel that this hotel is not simple and should have good training

Of course, no one is perfect. If the hotel can be connected to the subway and add some Chinese food, it will be perfect!

There are not many hotels that are thoughtful, I hope they will stick to it!

Sanitation: Very clean, whether it's the room corridor or the restaurant, the windows are bright and clean.
Environment: Imitation of Wukang Building, the interior decoration is movie-style, right next to the film and television base, and the room window can directly see the flowery Huanghe Road scenery.
Service: The waiters are very enthusiastic and the service attitude is very good.
Remind you that the breakfast is not a full buffet. There is a menu on the card that you can check yourself. There are not many things but the taste is okay, and you can definitely eat enough.
To say a disadvantage, after all, it is a new hotel, and there is still a decoration smell. You can't smell it if the window is always open. Fortunately, the weather is good now. If it's too hot or too cold to open the window for ventilation, the smell will be very obvious.

msg:As a designer hotel newly opened at the end of 23, the exterior of the Stylish Hotel is a 1:1 replica of one of Shanghai's classic landmarks, the Xuhui Wukang Building. Inside the hotel, although the public areas and guest rooms are not large due to the architectural shape, the sense of refinement is everywhere and unique. The hotel lobby is modern and avant-garde, and the revolving door with lighting effects reveals a retro fashion. The hotel corridor is a rare arched design.
The guest room is a small suite this time. The overall area is not large but it is enough.
Advantages: The decoration and equipment are very new and very clean. The hard decoration can be seen. The ubiquitous gold edging reveals a low-key luxury. The design of the bathroom mirror lamp is a round bulb commonly used in theater dressing rooms, which is very unique. The best part is that the bathroom faucet has a superior texture, such as brass material, temperature control, water output, and knob texture. Various switches also use a unique golden lever design, which is very exquisite. Dyson hair dryer is standard and very new.
Disadvantages: Limited by the width of the room, the width of the bed in the guest room is very limited, it feels about 1.6 meters wide, not spacious. Although the bedside table is exquisite, it is also small and inconvenient to put things. The refrigeration capacity of the small refrigerator brought by the customer is insufficient. There are no laundry bags and paper bags in the guest room. The breakfast is not self-service, the choice is too limited and the waiting time is long, there is a lot of room for improvement. In addition, the hotel is not equipped with public activity facilities such as gyms and swimming pools.
In short, this is an exquisite designer hotel, suitable for couples or couples to spend time together. If you are traveling with the elderly or the whole family, it is not the most suitable.

I booked a package with two free tickets. Because I traveled off-peak, there were few people and it was very comfortable. The hotel has all the services it should have, and the room is large. The included dinner and breakfast are rich and plentiful. The design of the hotel revolves around stage and film, which is very impressive. In fact, there are many fun places in Songjiang. You can go to many local attractions within 10 minutes from the hotel. You can also try the local farm dishes in Songjiang. The only thing that I think the hotel can improve is that you don't need to change your toothbrush, toothpaste and slippers every day, you can change them for each guest.

It is very close to the park, convenient for playing, opposite is the complex, coffee, milk tea and takeaway are all suitable. The dinner in the set meal is unexpectedly rich and delicious, but the breakfast is a bit thin. The only small regret is that there are no facilities such as gyms and swimming pools, and there are no game rooms or gardens suitable for little friends. For parents and children, the day without visiting the park is relatively boring.

I heard that it was only opened in December 2023. The hotel is very artistically designed and very new. It's clean, the waiters are all very enthusiastic, welcome fruits are given in the room, and the drinks in the refrigerator are free. The hotel suite I bought came with a dinner for two people, which was enough for our family of three, and an extra drink. Although the breakfast was only for two people, it also came with an extra one for the children. The breakfast is not a buffet, but a set meal. There are three kinds, the amount is very large, everyone is very full, the fruit is very fresh and tastes good.
The hotel suite also comes with two tickets to Chedun Film and Television Park. I went there this morning and it was pretty good.

msg:The hotel has just opened. The design is really pleasing, with a French romantic feel. There are a lot of arches and contrasting colors. The color matching of each space is very high-end. There are many small details worth exploring. The marble in the elevator hall has a 3D effect, and the air-conditioning vents are all beautiful. Made with pattern processing. There are also little surprises everywhere in the guest room. After pulling out the door card, I found a message on the card holder. When I entered the guest room, I found my husband and I’s names and blessings written on the TV. The guest supplies are all from big brands, including a Dyson hair dryer, De'Longhi's kettle and Acca Kapaa bath set are full of luxury. The service is also super good. I give a thumbs up to the lady at the front desk and the guy in the restaurant. The service can be said to be meticulous! It was a pleasure to stay here, I will try it again next time!

msg:The room suite is also very small and the service staff's attitude is average. They only put two bottles of water in each room for cleaning. It's a bit stingy. The breakfast options are even less pitiful. There is only one row and it ends. What's even more exaggerated is when they run out of paper towels and hand sanitizer and ask them for it. It’s really weird that you have to come to the room to check before giving!

msg:The hotel has a strong sense of design, the room is small, clean, the bedding is comfortable, and the sound insulation is good. Maybe because there are not many guests at the moment, there is no noise disturbance. The bathroom is spacious and the water is comfortable, but it still lacks some humane facilities. For example, there is no clothes hook in the shower room, and there is no suitable place to put changing clothes, which is a bit inconvenient. Because the hotel is newly opened, there is no place for leisure, no entertainment facilities are open, and the gym is not open. When you book a room, you will receive tickets to the film and television park. It is more convenient to enter the park from the nearest hotel. Currently, only the western restaurant on the ground floor is open, and the food is pretty good. The service staff has a warm attitude.

I must give it a thumbs up. I will stay here again next time I come to Songjiang. Unfortunately, I came late in the evening and left in a hurry in the morning, so I didn’t have time to take beautiful photos.

msg:第一次在攜程給全一星評價。
因為實在是純純大冤種。
地點完全是縣城水平，我還以為來到了山東縣城。上海住了二十多年沒想到現在還有這種地方，簡直夢迴2000年。周圍衹有快餐，連個像樣的餐廳都沒有，打車二十分鐘到工業區吃的鐵板燒，勉強對付了晚餐。
裝修是漢庭水平。住的套房，小也就罷了，關鍵是格局非常糟糕，長條**型，床最多一米五寬，整體住的很擠，非常逼仄。和皇冠開元這種的套房完全比不了，哪怕是同等面積的東湖賓館也比這裏的格局好多了。怎麼會搞得這麼爛啊，不能理解。
馬桶的感應式沖水靈敏度糟糕，設計雞肋。套房的起居室的沙發極其不舒服，根本坐不了人。浴室的整體設計就是1995年左右的上海老破小的經典設計，感謝破賓館幫我回憶童年。
來之前在點評看到可以送早餐到房間，特意定了兩個早飯。來了之後發現早飯必須到餐廳用餐。所以送早飯衹是開業營銷是吧？真要命，我十點半要是能起的了床，為什麼要在賓館吃早飯？結果因為房間太差太悶，估計兩點多才睡着，八點多就醒了，但是渾渾噩噩很難受，根本不想下床。

説真的，一千三四的價格，我住松江開元的套房，或者市區的香格里拉的大床，不舒服嗎？為什麼要來這個縣城漢庭遭罪啊！
衹能説有一個喜歡到處發掘新賓館的女朋友，總有踩雷的時候吧！
希望攜程給賓館定級的時候，稍微睜開店眼睛，別整的太過分了吧！
