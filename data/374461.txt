When i asked the reception why they don't have a kids play room, she just said its a commercial business oriented hotel. So if you are bringing your kids to have a business visit in shanghai don't stay in this hotel. Plus, the breakfast is much simpler that the same hotel in other cities as guangzhou or shenzhen.

However, they put a crib in my room without a mattress. In place of the mattress they put duvet and blankets. I complained for 3x, the manager every time claimed that he would put a mattress and they went and added a blanket. It was one of the worst nights of my life at the hotel, because my baby didn't sleep. He was super uncomfortable and he doesn't sleep in bed with me, just on the crib. I am disappointed by the lack of neglect of the hotel manager.

When we informed the reception they first sent and air cooler but later changed our room. The room was well appointed with a nice view. Since Shanghai is just recovering from a lockdown it was the first day for the breakfast buffet to be opened and hence had limited options. The hotel has a lot of potential but for now seems like it is still reeling from the aftershock of the lockdown.

The check in was fast and efficient and the desk clerk spoke good English. 
The room was very clean upon check in, a big comfortable bed and amazing bathroom with very big shower and bathtub
There were plenty of restaurants and bars very nearby with the West Nanjing Road area an easy walk, bike or Subway ride away.
It was easy to order waimai dinner to the hotel , the pick up point was down stairs in the reception area and the local drivers had no problems dropping food off. 
There was no annoying noise from the corridor at night and no smell of smoke which can often happen in Chinese hotels despite the strict non smoking policy!
The continental breakfast from room service was excellent and delivered perfectly on time.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break or Staycation.

msg:This was my second time staying at the intercontinental. Overall the stay was enjoyable and relaxing for a long weekend. The location is good with many restaurants in walking distance. It was also easy to get a didi. There was a sweet and kind older doorman (I didn‚Äôt catch his name) that always opened the doors and helped with luggage when the younger doormen did not. 

Negatives: I was very disappointed in the breakfast arrangement. The staff did not enforce people to wear mask while getting food from the buffet. I witnessed many people touch the food with their hands, put it up to their nose to smell then put it back, and sneeze or cough without covering their mouth/ nose right over the food. I couldn‚Äôt even eat anything because of the uncleanliness of the atmosphere. Masks should be a requirement due to Shanghai being a tourist town with many people from out of town. 
Another improvement the hotel could add is the women‚Äôs locker room. The jacuzzi only worked on one side which was a downside when there were other people in it.

It is more useful than some new hotels, and the system (such as the bathtub) is also very complete. The key is that the service is really good. The swimming pool is also very clean, the hot spring in the swimming pool is also very clean, the water is very clear, and the staff are also very serious. The price-performance ratio is very good, and this price is really not high in Shanghai. I added breakfast at the front desk, and I can add it at a preferential price one day in advance, and the breakfast is also very good.

Hygiene: Clean and tidy, the sheets and bedding are white, the bathroom is cleaned very well, and I took the opportunity to take a bath.
Facilities: Swimming and gym are all one-stop. I went swimming specifically. It is 1.5m deep and there are few people, so you can swim freely. There is a discussion area and a bar in the lobby where you can drink. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant is very rich and satisfies your taste buds.
Service: As soon as you enter the door, the doorman will help you carry the box and lead you. The service staff are polite, very professional and serious, and make you feel very comfortable.

I still want to choose InterContinental when I come to Shanghai next time. Big brands are trustworthy.

msg:I chose Jing'an InterContinental Hotel in downtown Shanghai. It turns out that my choice was right. It meets all the characteristics of an excellent hotel. The reasons are as follows: 1. Good location, really good location! Quiet in the bustling Shanghai Station, the closest to the barrier-free elevator on Line 1, the overpass has a vertical elevator, and it is not far from the Shanghai Natural History Museum, Zhang Garden and the Bund; 2. The service is simply too good. Coco Wang is beautiful and kind. She is beautiful and kind. She said important things three times and upgraded me to an executive twin room, which made me not too happy. It instantly became noble, so that my classmates from Shanghai who came to my hotel felt very proud, which made me, a luxury hotel lover, feel satisfied. Special thanks to Coco Wang. Because the baby wanted to swim, the front desk delayed my check-out by two o'clock. When I was packing up, they didn't urge me. It was a great virtue of the staff. I was so moved. When I came down to apologize, YOUNG YU, the duty manager, was very tolerant and generous. It was so touching. The front desk staff were all very beautiful. In addition, the concierge Jordan Shi is an expert on Shanghai. If you ask him about your itinerary, he will definitely point you to where to go. He also gave me some postcards in a friendly way, which finally prevented me from returning to Guangdong empty-handed. John Liu at the door was also full of smiles. When he saw the taxi carrying people coming back, he quickly came up to help with the luggage. During the few days I stayed here, I was very happy to see Xiao Liu pick me up at the door. I felt relaxed and warm instantly; 3. The hotel's environment and facilities are quite good. There are four rooms with separate toilets, cloakrooms, toilets and bathrooms. In the morning, I changed the coat rack into a study room and locked it in to read without disturbing my family's rest. The hotel has three books introducing Shanghai, as well as the Bible; the toilet is smart, the curtains are also electric, and the lighting is very sufficient. The breakfast is delicious and rich. The gym and indoor heated swimming pool on the sixth floor are open from 6:00 to 22:30. You can play in the water after dinner. There are also indoor saunas and hot springs... In short, InterContinental is emipre!

It was so serious that it affected the quality of sleep. I tried to close the shower door but it didn't work. I asked the staff to check the problem. They replied that the people upstairs were taking a shower and the noise would stop after they finished. Every room was like this. Many guests have reported this problem. Why don't you solve it? Instead, consumers spend 1,200 yuan to listen to others taking a shower in the middle of the night. It's really speechless. Because there were children sleeping, I asked the staff to speak softly, but I didn't expect the staff to slam the door and leave. I was stunned at the time. Thinking back to when I first checked in during the day, I asked for a quilt, and the staff said it was all distributed. Such an InterContinental Hotel is really bad. I'm here to persuade people to quit with my real name. The equipment is also old.

The front desk replied: "Our hotel is a non-smoking floor, and all hotels in Shanghai are non-smoking."
Second: I asked the front desk: "Why is the corridor so smoky, there are cigarette butts on the ground, and the room is really smoky." The front desk replied: "Madam, we don't have a smoking floor here, and it's even more impossible in the room."
Third: Until I took out these photos, he had nothing to say! He replied hastily: "Maybe some guests smoked secretly. Our hotels in Shanghai are all non-smoking." But the hotel did not give me any apology or explanation!
Excuse me, is the surveillance system in the corridor of the hotel set up? The hotel solves the guests' demands with a blindly confident and superior attitude? He also said: Our hotel in Shanghai, our hotel in Shanghai, no discrimination is mentioned in every sentence, and every sentence is replied with a discriminatory tone! There is nothing to say about the arrogant attitude. Is this the attitude of a five-star hotel? How did you get the stars? It makes people doubt

First of all, the room facilities are first-class. The spacious room is equipped with a comfortable big bed, and the sheets are soft and skin-friendly, which ensures the quality of my sleep every night. Modern facilities in the room such as high-speed wireless network, smart TV and air conditioning system all work smoothly, meeting my various needs during the trip. In particular, the rich variety of drinks provided in the minibar allowed me to enjoy a glass of iced drink after a tiring journey, which greatly improved my stay experience.

In terms of location, the location of the hotel is impeccable. It is located in the city center, close to many popular tourist attractions and can be reached on foot. The surrounding transportation is convenient, whether by subway or bus, it is easy to go to every corner of the city. In addition, there are many restaurants and shopping malls near the hotel, whether it is tasting authentic food or buying souvenirs, it is very convenient.

Finally, the service level of the hotel is also an important reason for my high evaluation. From the warm greetings from Jane at the front desk to the timely response of the room service, every employee showed a professional service attitude and meticulous care. It is especially worth mentioning that the breakfast service was excellent, not only with a wide variety of options, but also delicious, which injected vitality into my day's travel.

In short, I was very satisfied with my stay in this hotel. Whether it was the comfort of the room, the convenience of the location or the warmth and thoughtfulness of the service staff, my trip was enriched a lot. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and look forward to staying again on future trips.

In addition, the fresh air turns on by itself in the middle of the night, and the sound is so loud that I woke up in the middle of the night for two nights. I called the front desk for a long time before they turned it off. I didn't sleep well afterwards. Speechless. The last night, the engineering staff manually turned off the fresh air in my room, and I slept a full night.

msg:This article is written by a student who graduated from one of the top ten hotel management schools in the world. It provides an in-depth analysis and guides you to avoid the worst InterContinental Hotel in the world. To sum it up in one sentence, the hotel is a ruin built in the Jin and Yuan Dynasties. The path from the lobby to the room allows you to experience in depth the time of traveling back to the cavemen in 2024. If one point is the lower limit for other hotels, I firmly believe that For this hotel it is the upper limit. I checked in on 3.29 and checked out on the 31st. From the moment I got off the bus, I deeply experienced the pain of no guest service. I had to carry a bunch of luggage alone to the executive room on the 28th floor. The hotel will only say that we have guests, but they are too busy. In fact, this is equivalent to being in name only. The service of the front desk guy on the 29th was good, but the attitude of the front desk guy on the 30th can only be described as barbaric, rude and unprofessional, as if the guest owed him hundreds of thousands and would secretly ridicule and despise the guest's personality behind the mask. , don‚Äôt say no, the slightly fat waiter smiled with his eyes. They have not received professional training and do not know how to say sorry or address guests. Not only do they not know how to explain guests' problems, their education level may only teach them to say no. Many buttons in the elevator were broken, and they were not disinfected in time and were very dirty. The room was dirty, old and run down. And they would not clean the room. Even though I did not need to clean it, they would also put a sign on me saying that because you did not need to clean it, we did not clean it. So the service staff of this hotel entered my room just to visit? The room will not provide disposable toiletries, which need to be shared with previous and future guests. In the name of environmental protection, no one can guarantee whether the previous guest has added other ingredients to it. This is completely inconsistent with the outlook for sustainable development of the hotel industry! Instead, he established a unique and disgusting standard for himself. Wi-Fi is stuck and there is no signal at all when going to the toilet. There is even no charging socket on the side of the bed. I can only say that this hotel only makes excuses for its mistakes. If you are looking forward to a pleasant trip in Shanghai, be sure to avoid this hotel.

The latest breakfast time is 10:30, which is really good news for those who love to sleep in‚ò∫Ô∏è

Regarding check-out, the hotel gave me a big surprise~ My flight was at 17:30 in the afternoon and I was expected to leave at 15:00. I originally planned to extend the room for half a day and pay half of the room rate.
After the little beauty Gloria Xiao Yuhan learned about the situation, she helped us delay the delay to 16 o'clock for free. It was so heartwarmingü•∞

I will still choose Jing‚Äôan Intercontinental from now on and have firm trust‚ò∫Ô∏è

msg:I have been staying in hotels during the holidays, and the comparison is obvious. InterContinental has generally better hardware facilities, and the front desk service is also very enthusiastic and helps to upgrade the room type, but the view is average.
The main thing to mention is that the breakfast was too lame and didn't have anything. It was mainly bread, salad and cereal. The lunch was just badly cooked and rotten wontons. The price was almost 200 at this level. The child ran out to eat at KFC by himself the next day. The restaurant was also very slow in clearing the dishes, which was really shocking.

msg:Every time I go back to China, I always wonder, how do the established international five-star brands survive now? brand? Location? Old member?

Sometimes the old Five Star has made me forget that they are in the service industry.

On the first day I checked in, I broke my toenail. I bought something and asked the concierge to bring it to me. The answer was: there were not enough staff, so I had to pick it up myself.

I said: I have traveled all over the world, and even three or four-star hotels in Europe cannot provide this service. Besides, what if the guest is inconvenienced? If your old hotels are unwilling to spend money to upgrade to smart hotels, for example, the Junting Hotel in Hangzhou where I stayed before and a five-diamond hotel in Suzhou not only have robots to deliver things, but also have check-in surprises, fruit trays and snacks in the room, etc.

May I ask what is left of these old international brands in China? Only feelings left?

Do you still want to develop inbound tourism? I remembered that I was in Spain. I stayed in a different hotel across two roads the next day, and it was still raining. The guy at the front desk took the initiative to say, "I will help u." to carry my dad's luggage. Before I could say thank you, he left. .

What about our service industry? Everyone is arrogant or shirking responsibility.

The overall a**osphere of tourism software is getting worse and worse. Who will dare to come here in the future?

Or you can learn from those smart hotel chains in emerging markets, let alone other countries, and don't go online. Every time you spend money to add to the trouble, you will be so angry that you will vomit blood!

As for the service, I have to complain. What happened to the InterContinental recently? When I started checking in, the front desk looked arrogant and was very bad. Then all the hotel staff I met did not see the standard smiling faces. This Do you have a problem with the hotel or the customers? It really needs to be improved.
The hotel breakfast is the same as Indigo. The variety is quite rich, but the taste is really average. He even dared to go to the place where he had breakfast when a water pipe burst and he stepped in the water.
Overall, the house price is indeed not expensive, but it is also not cost-effective and disappointing.

I wanted to wash my hands and found hair on the sink. I couldn't accept it. It was so disgusting! As an InterContinental, if the room is cleaned like this, can guests check in? ? ? There was also a stench and musty smell from the sewer pipes in the shower room! ! I almost burst into tears. . .
So I called the front desk to ask for help. I have never seen such a cold front desk staff. Your hotel has already done this to improve its hygiene, and your service attitude is still so bad. After a different front desk person answered the phone, his attitude improved and he was offered a different room as compensation and was upgraded to a corner room.
The corner room is very large, but there is something wrong with this room again! ! The shower head is leaking, and the connection is leaking! Everyone knows about the online public opinion about shower heads üöø, but who would dare to use a leaking shower head! ! ! ? ! ? ? ? ? It really sucks.
There are also faucets in this hotel. The designer who designed this faucet is a talented person, and the Jing'an Intercontinental who chose this faucet is also a talented person. No matter how low you turn on the water, as soon as you touch it with your hand, water will splash everywhere. The entire washbasin is surrounded by water. There is no way to put anything in it, and it will splash on your clothes!
The worst stay experience ever, I will never stay here again! ! !

Environment: The room is large and the lighting is good

Hygiene: The biggest concern when staying in a hotel is hygiene. I haven‚Äôt seen those issues mentioned online. It‚Äôs good to see them after checking in.

Overall, Jing'an Intercontinental is really good at this price. You can't go wrong with the old five-star brand. It's very worth it. I will definitely come back next time I come to Shanghai~

The location is very convenient and you can also see the Suzhou River. The hotel is a super five-star hotel. Although the equipment is not new, it is well maintained. The mattress is also very comfortable, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry rooms, and members have welcome drinks. The breakfast on the first floor is also great, with a wide variety. In short, it is worth staying!

I wonder if they have passed the standard training? Next, when we get to the room where we checked in, don‚Äôt use the bathroom. Can the hotel buy a bottle of mold removal cleaner? Do a good job of hygiene. If it doesn't work, just apply glue on the cracks. A bottle costs more than 10 yuan. Can you live in such a dirty environment? Nowadays, boutique hotel chains can provide good hygiene and service, and at least provide a powerful hair dryer. I wonder if the hotel leaders would like to come and inspect it when they have time.

I stayed in a twin room in room 2722. The toilet and bathroom were very large and very comfortable.

There are many types of breakfast, but I still hope to have more local Shanghai specialties. I also hope that the ingredients can be fresher and more down-to-earth. However, this may also be a common problem of hotels in big cities. The ingredients are too standardized or uniform. Semi-finished product, lacking some human warmth.

Hygiene: No problems were found in the overall hygiene and it was very clean! It's just that hotels in the city center can't open windows for ventilation, so I hope there are more green plants or fresh air in the room.

It's an old five-star hotel, so I felt that the waiters were full of European aristocratic temperament. There was no bellman when I got off the bus, and the front desk lacked enthusiasm. Everyone was completing their own work.
The nearby restaurants are very convenient, so I‚Äôd give it an overall rating of eight.

msg:First of all, I want to say that this is the worst hotel among all the five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. No place is satisfactory to me. First, when you have not entered the lobby, there are cigarette butts all over the floor at the entrance of the lobby, and no one is in time. Cleaning, second, when you go to the lobby rest area, the carpet in the lobby is disgustingly dirty, not as clean as some 200-plus small hotel carpets, third, check-in took more than 20 days without waiting Minutes, because I need two rooms on the same floor, and I need to take care of the elderly in wheelchairs. The waiter said yes, and after a long time, a person who looked like a foreman came over and said no. Treat each other with an indifferent attitude, and finally they are not on the same floor. Fourth, when I went to the restaurant on the fifth floor to eat at 6 o'clock in the evening, I waited for several minutes and no waiter appeared. Later, I went to get the tablet computer to order the food. Needless to say, the food in the restaurant is expensive, but The taste is really bad, and the bathroom in the restaurant on the fifth floor is very small. When the door is pushed in, it will hit the toilet by a few centimeters. Normal people have to squeeze into the corner to close the door. For an old man with inconvenient legs and feet , as one can imagine. Fifth, at ten o'clock in the evening, I called the service desk for more than ten minutes and no one answered. Later, I used my mobile phone to call the hotel number left in Ctrip and no one answered. I completely collapsedüò°. Fifth, the breakfast is not like a five-star hotel breakfast at all. There are a large number of uncleared tables, a mess, the placemats are filthy, and there is no change for every guest. There are few dishes and the management is chaotic. Sixth, the parking fee is 80 yuan from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. (the first time I encountered a five-star hotel that required parking fees). The charge for two rooms is more than 3,400, which should not be low. Seventh, the hotel will refund the money only the next day. Generally speaking, this is an old hotel. The decoration style of the rooms is similar to that of the better hotels 20 years ago. The service level is not as good as that of the two-star hotels. I am not exaggerating. Is it true that a five-star rating will always be a five-star hotel? ? At the very least, the InterContinental Hotel in Shanghai Jing‚Äôan is not worthy of five-star hotel at all. Guests pay a five-star price and must receive matching services. Anyway, I will never choose the InterContinental brand again in the future. Due to pushing the wheelchair, I didn't have time to take some photos.

The attitude of Ms. Harmon Mu at the front desk is very good, and the waiter who cleans the room is also very good.

Room facilities: The room is very large, there is still a lot of space for children's beds on the floor. The bathroom area is very spacious, with separate shower, bathtub, smart toilet, and children's chair. It may be because of the 19th floor, the bath water is too small, and there are too few charging sockets.

Breakfast: rich in content

wifi: stable and smooth.

Bed: 2 meters wide, very large and comfortable.

Restaurant: A**ospheric, with a high ceiling.

Hygiene: clean

Parking: 10 yuan per hour, capped at 80 yuan a day, and there is a new charge for entry and exit.

Location and transportation: Near Xinke Station, the transportation is very convenient.

After waiting for a while, several groups of people thought we were not going to register. The guest directly jumped in front of the queue, and I only gave up my seat after asking. I am very displeased with the service in the lobby. I don‚Äôt even give a smiley face like I owe money. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the casual clothes we wear on international flights.

The person who helps to collect the express is still good, although small but well organized.

The breakfast is average, and the Western food is less and basically Chinese.

The room was generally cleaned. We stayed in the bathroom for four or five days and cleaned it once. The cigarette butts at the elevator door waited for a whole day before being cleaned away.

Calling a taxi is quite fast, also because of Shanghai, the service staff at the gate station are not helpful, security purposely?

Relying on the high price but not noisy, this is very gratifying!

Overall it's okay!

I went to dine immediately after purchasing and told me that there were actually no hairy crabs. However, in fact, the relevant sales channels of the hotel were promoting hairy crab themes. The buffet is not as good as a small hotel. The hot dishes are basically cold. The buffet can make every dish taste so unpalatable that it is impossible to eat. It is amazing! After I complained, the restaurant supervisor admitted on the spot that it was the hotel's fault, told me that I couldn't contact the senior management, left my phone number and said they would reply the next day, and then there was no news. After that, I took the initiative to contact the hotel many times, but the hotel management ignored me and never contacted me to deal with it! As a professional hotel manager - the catering director and general manager of Jing'an InterContinental, please pay attention to customer experience and don't ignore customer feedback! The entire hotel falls short of InterContinental Group standards from top to bottom, and is a discredit to the InterContinental brand! Intercontinental Headquarters needs to clean up this hotel! If the hotel continues to ignore customers and does not actively deal with them, I will continue to defend my rights and complain!

msg:The worst Intercontinental I have ever stayed in so far is actually in Shanghai
1. There are cockroaches, Xiaoqiang freely shuttles between the bathroom and the shower room area, there is more than one.
2. The washbasin has a wonderful design. When the water volume is normal and you turn on the washbasin, the water will splash and wet the things on the countertop and your clothes.
3. I drove there after 7 o'clock in the evening, and there was no service person at the door to guide the way. I went around twice to find the parking lot. (If there are large and small suitcases, don‚Äôt you have to take them in yourself)
3. In the parking lot, hotel guests need to pay for parking, 80 for one night.
4. The attitude of the front desk is very average. Ask if you can borrow a charging cable, and scan the first floor by yourself.

When checking in, there was only one staff member at the front desk, and there was no smile or greeting during the whole process. After consulting wheelchair services and other information, the front desk did not know much about it. , I really suspect that I am not living in an intercontinental, like a budget hotel.

Room facilities: Fully equipped facilities, toothbrush and toothpaste can be collected directly at the front desk.

Sanitation: It's useless.

Environment: The room is at the corner, so the room type is not particularly positive, and there is no exterior view. Basically, it is a commercial office building.

Service: needs to be improved.

msg:This is the first time I write a negative review on Ctrip. It‚Äôs really because this hotel gives people such a bad impression. Let me explain it in detail from several aspects!
1. The hardware hall is generally good, but it has a very strange smell. Maybe I personally don‚Äôt like this kind of aromatherapy. It's a bit too strong, and it's been raining in Shanghai these past few days. The moist air is mixed with a strong fragrance, which makes people feel uncomfortable.
2. The room facilities are old and not at all like a hotel renovated in 18 years. It has an old feel everywhere. It feels like it was renovated ten years ago. The bathroom shower and bathtub are together. The bathtub is in the innermost part of the shower room. The floor is slippery. Marble is also very slow to drain. There is no anti-slip mat or anti-slip tiles. The shower will inevitably cause the floor to be slippery. If a second person goes to take a bath or go to the bathtub, it is very easy to cause slipping. My child slipped and fell and hit his head. It was very It was dangerous. Later, because the child kept crying and had psychological problems, he checked out and went home overnight. My child has stayed in many 5-star hotels across the country, and this was the first time he did not want to spend the night in a hotel.
3. Service, this is what I want to complain about the most, and it is also divided into three small incident narratives
   1. There are many foreign guests in the whole hotel. It is true that there are places to attract foreign guests. However, I feel that domestic guests are treated differently. This is reflected in several aspects. I was in a hurry when I got off the car and did not bring my ID card. Can I use Alipay's ID? The answer was no. I said that I had stayed in many hotels and it could be used. The front desk official said, sir, our hotel is an international hotel chain and it cannot be used here. I said, is the ID card picture I took OK? He said that I would help you register first. This may lead to ward inspections. I said it was okay. Then I said that my wife had brought her ID and could register her. He said that it would not work if the room was not booked in her name. Later, we communicated about the solution. My wife's ID card was registered, and then my ID card photo was taken and kept for the record. The whole process was handled with a very cold attitude.
  2. The room given to us for the first time was the last one. After checking it out, my wife was a little concerned about it and went to the front desk to change the room. Because the front desk did not see any guests handling business, my wife went to the counter to change the room card. , then the front desk said that the foreign friend hadn‚Äôt finished the process, and then a foreigner who was far away and chatting with someone came to handle it. Naturally, we got out of the way without saying anything. As a result, the foreigner was very arrogant and talked to my wife. Say: I'm not sure you understand me, Please give me some space. My wife and I were a little overwhelmed by the unexpected situation. The front desk heard and saw it very clearly, and did not explain a word to avoid the guest's embarrassment, because there was no one in front of us when we came. Misunderstanding, the front desk did not do anything.

3. I called room service around 9pm, but no one answered. After about ten minutes, there was still no answer. It wasn‚Äôt until the third call in half an hour that there was no answer. This is also the first time I have encountered this in all the hotels I have stayed in. .



Maybe our past guests from other places in the hotel are not as noble as foreigners, so we feel that they are treated differently in terms of service. I can't explain the difference here, but people who have been there should be able to feel the difference. The hotel management doesn't know how to train its employees. I didn't feel any service or kindness in this hotel. Even when we checked out that night, the front desk didn't even ask basic questions and just let us leave it alone. The service is much worse than InterContinental in other cities, and also much worse than other chain brands such as Banyan Tree and Park Hyatt.

msg:It was extremely bad. There was no service at all. The room service took my clothes to be washed. They were damaged from the third wash. The clothes were LV and the leather was burnt directly. They said the color was fading. I said the fading became darker as the color faded. Well, I stopped talking and said I would ask the lobby manager to handle it, but there was no result after waiting. I took the initiative to contact me to ask about the situation, but there was no reply. I woke up in the room the next day and saw the clothes hanging there (nothing was handled) by the waiter himself. I swiped my door to enter my room and hung it there. I was sleeping and had no clothes on. The waiter swiped my card to come in. It was not the check-out time and there was no cleaning. The explanation given to me was that he brought an older aunt here. , the old aunt who said it was a female came in. She said she didn‚Äôt hear any response, so she came in. I saw that the aunt was older, so I said I didn‚Äôt want to go into details, and I didn‚Äôt check the surveillance to see if it was the female aunt. Her clothes were not taken care of. Send it back directly. What do you mean? They couldn't reply and asked the lobby manager to call me later. From the time it happened on the 3rd to the time I checked out and left the hotel on the 7th, I didn't wait for any reply. The clothes cost 26,000. That's what the hotel lobby manager told me. The solution is to waive the cleaning fee and give me 70‚úñÔ∏è10 compensation for the cleaning fee. Imagine that this 26,000 yuan piece of clothing is broken. If you pay me 700 yuan, can I repair it or continue to use it? I refused the 700 yuan, and the lobby manager told me that he was done with it. If he couldn't, he asked me to call 12315. The store was bullying customers.

If you stay in an executive room type, you can enjoy administrative trea**ent. It is enough to tell the room number when the front desk handles it, but after going there, it will take a long time for certification, and the work communication is not in place. Also, the room service is very slow, and it takes about ten minutes to wait for a razor. I called the front desk and informed that it would arrange to send it to me firstüòÇIt turned out that it was delivered by reminder. The overall feeling is that the hotel is not staffed enough, and there are quite a lot of people staying, so it shouldn't be.

msg:A very poor hotel. The room equipment is old and unhygienic. There are obvious marks left by the previous guest on the carpet and bathroom. After taking a bath and using a bath towel, I felt itchy all over. It is completely a five-star old hotel room design from the 1990s. The switches are anti-human and there are only two sockets. One of them is shaky and does not meet the basic standards of a five-star hotel. There are a lot of door-to-door takeaway services in the evening. Sitting in the lobby waiting for guests to come down to greet them is unworthy of dignity, and the hotel just sits back and does nothing. Highly not recommended for families with children.

msg:The feeling of staying this time is incomprehensible. I gave a triangular room at the beginning, and then I was busy changing rooms. When I entered the room, it was super invincible and gave me a fan. The front desk said let us get used to it before sending a fan. It was still hot when we came back at night. I asked for a fan, but one didn‚Äôt work and it was still hot. Another fan still had ice cubes. As a result, there was a water leak. Once the water was injected, it leaked all over the floor. I was also responsible for cleaning the floor, but it couldn‚Äôt relieve the heat. I slept for two days. The sofa is covered with a thin quilt, and the quilt is completely useless. I feel that I am not staying in a hotel these two days, but camping in the wild. That feeling is really uncomfortable... The most exaggerated thing is the bathroom, both shower heads are broken Yes, my son took a shower in the bathroom and shouted that the water could not wash his body (as shown in the picture), and called them to repair it the next day, but no one cared about it. The only thing that needs to be praised is the attitude of the customer service staff is still good. The lid of the kettle was broken on the first day of stay. When I poured water, the water overflowed onto my feet. Fortunately, it was thick and the service staff replaced the kettle with a new one. To be honest, the sanitation is really mediocre, just outdated. My husband keeps saying that this hotel can no longer be used. Is this still the standard of InterContinental? We have lived in many intercontinental cities. I felt very good when I stayed in November, but this time it was very, very bad.

msg:I usually don't write reviews, but Intercontinental really left me speechless this time. First, I booked a room four days before we checked in. When we arrived at the hotel around six o'clock or almost seven o'clock, we were told that there were no rooms available and that the cleaning lady was short of manpower and the room had not been cleaned. They told us to go have a meal first. Come on... It's outrageous. It's already six or seven o'clock, and it's already dark. You said that if I came at three or four o'clock, you told me that I didn't clean it because of the lack of manpower during the New Year. OK, I'll wait, but it's already It's six or seven o'clock. To put it bluntly, insufficient staff is not something that guests should consider, right? Moreover, the hotel did not take the initiative to provide any compensation measures.
       Secondly, the hygienic condition of the hotel is poor. After taking a shower and lying on the bed to rest, I found an unknown brown solidified liquid on the quilt cover. Since it was too late and I was only staying for one night, I was not happy that I had to go through the trouble of giving feedback. If I give feedback at this efficiency, I might not know when a new quilt will be delivered.
       Oh, by the way, the hotel TV cannot cast the screen.

msg:I have something to do in Shanghai during the Chinese New Year, and I booked two executive rooms for three nights with my parents. Let‚Äôs talk about the first day first, check in was surprisingly slow! It took a long time for a guest to stay, and there were so many passengers staying in, so there was a long queue. Not only did the staff not express embarrassment, but they also showed poor management! It took an hour to finally check in, and when I entered the room, I saw the long hair left by the previous customer on the toilet! There are also four or five long hairs on the white towel under the tooth brushing pool, and three on the sofa! Calling the front desk to clean up is not a bit embarrassing and a little impatient! Later, when the cleaning lady came, she was older and said she was short-handed, so I thought it would be difficult for everyone to celebrate the new year, so I didn't say anything! I wanted to ask for an extra quilt at night and was told that our hotel didn't have extra quilts? Not even willing to explain! The next day, I told a female staff at the front desk that there was a problem with our TV, so I didn‚Äôt bother me because it was too late yesterday. The front desk said impatiently that they would check it out if they found out! I didn't solve the TV problem until I checked out! The second night I called to ask for mineral water, and it was delivered as soon as I said, but it was not delivered until the third morning. On the third night, when I returned to the hotel, I found that there were no extra slippers, neither of the two rooms (the children played with the slippers during the day and threw them away). We found the hotel twice and needed slippers. The front desk told us that we were short of staff and we were very busy, etc. It has not been delivered for half an hour! Later, the child cried and had no choice but to bathe the child barefoot. During the period, I called the hotel manager and came to our room for about an hour. I didn‚Äôt solve any problems. I just told me not to be angry. I was afraid that my speech would be heard by the guests in other rooms. What I need is to solve the problem, not "you Don't be angry" "I'm sorry" such perfunctory words! The last morning I had breakfast and asked the waiter for baby tableware. The first one was not willing to help me and asked me to find another waiter. The second waiter directly told me that there were no baby tableware, and we only had three sets of baby tableware! It's outrageous! I ate breakfast for three days, and I saw countless children with baby tableware, you tell me there are only three sets of baby tableware in such a big hotel? Originally, I didn't want to be unhappy during the Chinese New Year, but the experience of staying this time was simply speechless! The parking fee for one night is 80. We saw some private cars parked on the ground, so we wanted to see if there were any seats. When we stopped, the hotel staff sternly drove us away and told us to leave quickly! We parked our two cars for three nights, and we couldn't use the charging pile. The hotel didn't provide free parking or parking coupons, and we were beaten by the staff. I don't know what I did wrong! When I checked out, I wanted to try my best to solve the problem. I told the female staff that I wanted to check out. Before I finished speaking, the staff picked up my room card and threw it into the check-out box, saying that it‚Äôs okay to put it here and go! nice! This hotel is really awesome! To sum up, we have been told by different staff these days that we are understaffed and very busy! It probably means that the guests should be sensible and don't make trouble for them! At first, I also felt that it was not easy for them to settle down. But again and again, I would like to ask, why do you open so many rooms because you are not capable enough to work? How much ability to do how many things! If there are not enough staff, then these staff can open as many guest rooms as they can serve. The guest has no fault at all. Why do guests have to understand again and again that your hotel is understaffed and responsible for the discomfort caused by guests? After staying for three days, the room card failed three times. Do we have to re-swipe the room card every day for our three-day stay? I can't understand! The staff are very unprofessional and the check-in experience is simply terrible! It is not easy to be in the service industry, but you must also have the necessary cultivation and service concept!

msg:1. The experience is extremely poor. When you check in, you are a guest who pays with a smiley face, but when you check out, you turn your face and don't recognize anyone, and you are extremely indifferent.
When leaving the store, a parking fee of 80 yuan will be charged.
The front desk didn't understand the business, and one said that they would charge; the other said that the executive suite would not be charged. Then there was no parking card at the front desk, so we took us to the restaurant to find a computer to process it. It took nearly 15 minutes, and after waiting, we said that we could go out directly. As a result, I was stuck at the parking exit for nearly 40 minutes. The security guard refused to let it out, saying that the system did not recognize it and that they had to pay.
      We made 5 phone calls back and forth with the front desk, and we were stuck at the exit for nearly 40 minutes, unable to get out, and not allowed to pass.
      What's even more incredible is that the main entrance of the hotel is only 2 minutes away from the exit of the underground parking lot. No one came to deal with it, and we were kept "patiently" waiting.
      On the other side, I was driven away by the security guards in the parking lot. If I want a parking ticket, I will go and ask the hotel myself! Don't block this exit!
     I completely delayed going to the government window that I made an appoin**ent in the afternoon. I finally made the appoin**ent and the planned work connection time. Because the hotel was slack and indifferent, I didn't arrive on time, which completely affected the day's work.
2. In the executive luxury suite on the 29th floor, the WI-FI cannot be connected and is always disconnected. I couldn't work at all, and some mobile phones were completely blocked when I went to the bathroom, and I couldn't even make calls.
    The final download was completed after standing at the front desk for 20 minutes.
I chose this InterContinental for my first trip in the New Year, and I will never live in an InterContinental again. Friends, pay attention to avoid pits.

The charger falls off as soon as it is plugged in. This is impossible to maintain. ? In terms of personnel, the management is chaotic. There is no waiter in sight. There is always only one person at the check-in area. Others occasionally come and wander around and run away, and there is always a queue. The dinner buffet and breakfast buffet actually had many duplicate dishes. The dinner was a mess. There was actually leftover cheese platter from the morning. In the morning, there were also a bunch of leftover dishes from the evening. It's too outrageous. The food is very sp**** and there isn't much to eat. I suggest Quan La go to Shenzhen Intercontinental for training. By the way, the waiters didn‚Äôt choose well either. They were all crooked. The manager was really drunk right next to the customers scolding the lazy waiters.

There is no service at all in terms of service. Ctrip's score of 4.3 should be believed. This time I am lucky and I will not make a mistake in the future.
For breakfast, hehe, I have never eaten a breakfast that is worse than this price.

It was quite late when we arrived at the hotel. I didn‚Äôt know whether it was the concierge or the security guard at the door. My boyfriend and I carried two large boxes and hand luggage, all of which we moved from the car ourselves. The staff was unhelpful and gave no guidance.
During my stay, I couldn't get through the phone call at night. There was no response from the room's landline and mobile phone, and there was no call back. What if there is an emergency?
The door chain of the room was broken, the hand shower in the bathroom could not be held, the shower on the ceiling was a decoration, the water outlet was almost completely blocked, the bathtub stopper was not tightly connected, and the water was leaking downwards.
When I checked out, I was alone. I am a girl and the driver was also a female driver. The driver and I struggled to carry our luggage to the car. The concierge was completely ignored.
Not under Intercontinental management, but on your own?

The dinner was not good. I have stayed in relatively poor five-star hotels. There were few varieties and poor quality. The meal replenishment was not timely and the waiters were impatient.
There is nothing for children to play with. It is only suitable for business trips or short-term stays that are convenient for going to the station.
The facilities are poor, very poor. Many details need to be improved. They should not appear in the Intercontinental brand. The phone is broken, the windows are broken, the door sucker is broken. When the air conditioner is turned off, the air outlet emits cold air by itself. It is very dirty. It's all dirt.
Not to mention the service, especially the person in charge named Henry, who speaks irresponsibly, goes back on his words, slanders the Intercontinental brand, and has no sense of responsibility as a leader. I‚Äôm really surprised that Intercontinental has such a person, and he can be responsible. It may be a related party. Due to some reasons, I don‚Äôt have the energy and time to appeal for a satisfactory result, but I will continue to appeal. If you don‚Äôt believe that no one will care about treating consumers like this, it is lawless and terrible.
Let‚Äôs talk about Ctrip. Although we are having a bad time these days because of the hotel and this responsible reason, Ctrip‚Äôs response and handling are still relatively timely and warm. I will still be a loyal user of Ctrip in the future.

I decided to evaluate it truthfully. The room facilities are average. I booked a big bed room, and said that the room will not be available until 3 o'clock. If I have an existing room, I would like to help me upgrade to a standard room. At that time, the child was sleepy and was in a hurry to sleep, so I agreed without thinking too much , As a result, I lay down and saw that the standard room was more than 200 cheaper than the double bed, and I didn't bother to go down to find the front desk
It's also called helping me upgrade, isn't this a scam! ! !
I will not consider staying in the future, the impression is greatly reduced! ! !

Finally, I called the catering, and the catering said they could help me. What‚Äôs funny is that the aunt brought me a toothbrush and then left. Half an hour later she knocked on the door again and offered to give me a toothbrush. I said I already had one and it was the same aunt. About half an hour later, the toothbrush came again, and it was the same aunt. You said it was funny or not, but I fell asleep. Does this aunt like me?
The next morning, I finished cleaning the room at ten o'clock. I was speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless and speechless.
Anyway, I won‚Äôt choose it next time. I guess there is something wrong with the hotel‚Äôs internal management.

Intercontinental Hotel is a very good brand
The room is clean and big. I live very comfortable.

The waiters are polite and take things seriously.
The breakfast is on the first floor, which is relatively rich. I eat less because of weight loss. When I saw the Shanghai special braised pork, I couldn't help but come for a piece, which tasted rather somersault.
The traffic is also very convenient and it is not far from anywhere, the Bund, Pudong, Nanjing Road are all a few kilometers away.

msg:I basically don't comment, but this is the worst intercontinental I've ever stayed in!
Not only the InterContinental, but also the worst among all the hotels that cost more than 1,000 yuan!
When I checked in, I saw an aunt at the front desk complaining to the front desk for a long time, complaining that as a five-star hotel, the service is extremely poor!
In fact, I can see from some details at the front desk when I checked in: 1. Toothbrushes were not provided, and the front desk didn‚Äôt ask if we had brought our own. Later, I came down to get it by myself; 2. The list at the front desk stated that accommodation parking fees, room cards I lost 50, and if I smoked, I would add another day's room fee. I had a high-ranking, love-to-live tone; 3. Since the Hunan cuisine I ate at night was rather spicy, I asked the front desk if there was any small fruit in the room, and the male receptionist said, "No Yeah", I didn't hear clearly, so I asked again, and the answer was "No".
Later, when I checked in, I accidentally found a lot of dried blood in the corner of the drawer. All of a sudden, people have a very bad impression of this hotel.
This time I chose this place because it is close to the train station. I will not live here again. I recommend everyone to avoid pitfalls!

1. A can of Coke sells for 25 yuan, which is no problem because you have 5 stars, but how long is the production date? You don‚Äôt want anyone to drink anyway.
2. Because you are a 5-star hotel, why are you reluctant to put out the bottled water in the room, which is purified water and mineral water, and why do you charge thousands in room fees? I dare not drink even though I am full.
3. I asked for money to park my car, so I accepted it. Your store does not come with a car.
4. It took 60 hours to get the refund of the deposit. If you manage your money well and don't lose it, can you still earn interest? I don't know either.

msg:The hotel has a good environment and is very close to Shanghai Railway Station, but I don‚Äôt know why the service is so poor. Here are a few things I encountered:
1. The attitude when checking in was obviously not very good and very cold. There was a gentleman next to me who probably left a computer charging cable behind when he checked in last time. I contacted the front desk before and told him to leave it at the front desk and pick it up when I check in today, but the front desk said he didn't know. The guest took out his cell phone to check the chat history for him. As a result, the two boys at the front desk quarreled among themselves. One complained and the other used his own work number. They completely ignored what the guest said and refused to check in the guest. There was only an older lobby manager who helped find the lost charging cable before and after running, and he was very polite.
2. A lady in the middle asked if she had a parking ticket, but she said impatiently that she didn‚Äôt have one. She didn‚Äôt even use basic polite words and didn‚Äôt even raise her head.
3. While waiting for someone, I sat in the sofa area and was told that it was a consumption area. I asked the waitress where I could sit, and she kept saying the third one. I didn‚Äôt understand what I was saying at all, and when I asked again, I started to get impatient and made a tut-sounding sound: ‚ÄúI already said the third one, the first one here, the second one there, and the third one ahead.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even raise my hands. Willing to lift.
4. Go to the front desk to ask about the check-out time. There are no customers at the front desk. The waitress doesn't know what she is doing and doesn't look up to ask when someone comes. After asking for the time, she still lowered her head and fiddled with the things in her hands throughout the process. She said thank you but did not respond, as if it disturbed her daze.
If you don't want to work here, you can quit and don't affect the customer's mood. If you are not good at work, get more training. If you can't manage it, you will be eliminated. Keeping these people will give you a worse experience than having a bitter face.

My family came here for a trip and I chose a brand that was relatively large, Intercontinental, but the result was unexpectedly bad!
When the car arrived at the door, there was no porter to take the luggage, and the check-in at the front desk was super slow. Because the reservations were made separately, even if you made a note in advance, you still had to go to the front desk to refresh your room card every day. The five-star hotel does not have turndown service. I stayed there for 4 days and it didn't even happen once. The air conditioner in the room is simply weird. Turn on the heating. There was no air conditioning, and it was so hot that I hardly slept dry all night. I communicated with the hotel on the last day and told them that the air conditioning must be turned off before the fresh air system could be activated. However, the air conditioning turned on by itself in the middle of the night. Rubbish!

First of all, there is a parking space on the first floor of the hotel. When we arrived at night, we asked the security guard if we could park here (I meant the surface parking space). The security guard said no. There is an underground parking lot.
The next morning, I asked the hotel front desk for a parking ticket. The front desk said there was no need to pay for parking. I asked why there was no explanation from the front desk yesterday. Even if parking on the ground is not allowed, at least explain it to the guests. Then the front desk did not apologize or express anything and was just silent.
Third, the parking fee is 80, which is not cheap. The front desk does not tell customers when checking in, which is very unreasonable! What makes me most uncomfortable is the attitude of the hotel staff. If there is a problem, they just have an attitude that this is the only way to deal with it.

Other five-star hotels will take the initiative to ask if they want to send facial cleanser if they left it behind, or do they still need it? The aunt who tidied the guest room did take the initiative to hand it over! But the level of service and attentiveness in the five-star hotel really needs to be improved. I am quite disappointed and will not stay here again in the future.

I only brought my own thermos with me. Cup, it was not very convenient to make this medicine, so I called the service staff and asked if they could get me a disposable cup. It seemed like a simple thing at first, but the service staff refused and said no. When I told the reason again, She promised to help me go to the restaurant to check it out. I was very happy and thought there was hope, but the waiter came ten minutes later and said no! I just don‚Äôt understand. Is it so difficult for such a big hotel to need a disposable cup? Aren't you going to entertain other people? This service is enough!

I suspected that it was just a few dim sum from the buffet at night. After complaining, I gave a similar one. And the waiter was very rambunctious, gathered together to drink milk tea and chat, but we sat there and waited for a long time without even placing our order. Finally came up, there were flying insects in the cup, the waiter did not apologize, just changed the cup. The breakfast is not at the level of Intercontinental at all, and the fried noodles are like rubber bands. This is the service and level of Intercontinental? ?

1. Hygiene:
There were a lot of scratches on the toilet seat in the hotel. The room was cleaned very sloppily. Even the water on the bathroom floor was not mopped up. The cleaning was very sloppy.
2. The water pipe burst early in the morning. The worker banged it with a hammer and turned off the water gate. There was no way to take a shower. The front desk told me that he could only take another elevator to the 6th floor to take a shower, and no apology was given the whole time.
3. The bathroom lights and all sockets were out of power in the middle of the night. I called someone to fix it, but a middle-aged uncle was called. There was no second person accompanying the woman when she was alone in the room. What should I do if something goes wrong? ? ?
4. There are very few sockets. There is only one socket on the left side of the bed.

Even staying at Home Inn is better than staying at this hotel! ! !

When I was checking in, I thought why the hotel had such a long check-in mark and the queue was so long. Finally it was my turn and we were only given one room. I had reserved two rooms in advance. The front desk said that there was another room that was being cleaned, so I thought we were not in a hurry to check in anyway, so we could just give one room first. Anyway, we left our luggage and went out for dinner. It turned out that by the time we finished dinner and returned to the hotel, it was almost 10:30, and the check-in queue at the front desk was even more exaggerated, and there were all people. After asking about the room we still need in the afternoon, the room is still dirty and has not been cleaned at all! After asking, I found out that the actual situation is that there are only 4 people cleaning rooms in the hotel, and there are more than 100 rooms that have not been cleaned. What? There are only four people cleaning rooms in such a big InterContinental Hotel? Can you believe it? What's even more irritating is that the hotel's leadership didn't come up with a reasonable plan. They just said that they would either refund the hotel for free or give the guest a dirty room first and let the guests go to the dirty room and wait. Please, it's already 11 or 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. Where can we find a hotel with a similar price if we cancel? After staying in a hotel so many times, this is the first time this has happened to me! In the future, Intercontinental will be blacklisted and I will never choose Intercontinental again! Not even a fast hotel! !

Objectively speaking, the charity is old, the service is poor, and the attitude is bad. It's embarrassing to use the brand name of InterContinental and do work that is inferior to that of Hanting.

We arrived at the hotel to check in early at 10:30 in the morning and were informed that we could check in at 3 pm. We understood and agreed with this and the hotel also charged a 3,000 deposit. However, we arrived at the hotel at 10 pm to tell the guests that the room had not been cleaned! Yes, you read correctly that the room was not cleaned at ten o'clock in the evening. When questioning the on-site lobby manager, he didn‚Äôt even tell him that he didn‚Äôt have a room yet. He just said that the room had not been cleaned. At this time, there were already 50.60 people on site, all of whom were guests without rooms. Subsequent guests started to take action, and the police also Coming. After 10:30, there was still no movement, so I immediately changed hotel and checked in. The room rate will be negotiated with Ctrip later. We originally renewed our reservation for three rooms, and it was like winning the lottery and we were awarded one room. So far, the hotel's 3,000-point deposit has not been refunded, and the hotel has not said anything to the guests.
ps: Ctrip was very helpful this time. It actively communicated with us and helped us recommend hotels. It also paid part of our expenses and promised to hold the hotel responsible for the follow-up. At the same time, we also complained to 12315 to see how this incident will be handled in the future.
It is recommended not to stay in this hotel. The business does not treat guests as human beings. It‚Äôs not like you feel at home anywhere you pay thousands for a room~

It was not 2 o'clock but 8 o'clock and there was no room yet. He looked confident. It really makes people feel uncomfortable and hope for improvement

The service at the front desk was very poor. When we called before, we were told that rice puddings were not delivered. When we arrived, the male GRO at the front desk said that we would have to wait for more than half an hour to check in. We went out for a walk and then came back and the room was still not ready. There are whispers there: "Why is it not healed yet?" Are you asking me? The attitude is also very bad. I won't come here a second time. The sound insulation is so bad that I was actually noisy in the early morning. As for the noise, you can guess for yourself. I won't come here a second time.

Neither the service nor the hardware works.
It takes a long time to queue up at the front desk to check in
I was told to get the room card after 15 o'clock, which is understandable. When I was told to get the room card, I had to queue up. Isn't this nonsense? The sanitation is not clean. No one answered the phone when I called the front desk. I was extremely disappointed with Intercontinental Management for the first time. The key is that the charging bed was not plugged into the wired control at night (I am really speechlessüòì). It takes about 3 days to receive the deposit after check-out. This It's nonsense. I stayed at Kempinski one night and received it in less than 10 minutes. It was absolutely rubbish! ! ! !

Maintenance technicians have also come to check but they have not solved it. It is even hotter after taking a shower. I keep sweating. I wash it in vain and the room feels like a steamer.
2: The TV and speakers are too old to cast the screen or connect to Bluetooth.
3: I ordered takeout at ten o'clock in the evening and asked the hotel to help me microwave it. I was told that the restaurant was closed. I asked if I could use the microwave in the employee lounge. I was told that I needed to ask for an answer, but there was no answer.

The charging socket at the bedside broke after a while, and it was charged again after touching it. What makes people speechless is that when we checked out and took a taxi, there were two waiters inside and three people outside the door. There must be one person who is serving. In the end, the driver was an aunt. My aunt and I carried the suitcases into the trunk. No one cared whether it was a person or not. I won‚Äôt say anything. There are three people and no one can move them. I‚Äôm really speechless. The price of 900 is so cheap. I won‚Äôt stay in this hotel again for 200 next time.

I told me to pay more to upgrade the room type, and he told me that the executive room type had double rooms, which was total. You want to be a lay Buddhist who pays extra money, but you won‚Äôt be given a place to live if you don‚Äôt pay extra money? As soon as I entered the room, I looked down. There were more than 1,500 room types, designed to look like a brain bubble. The TV was facing the bed diagonally. I tilted my head to watch it? The cleanliness of the room is also average. It doesn't feel like a five-star hotel at all. The overall experience is very poor. The price should not match the service and environment. I seriously doubt the authenticity of the ratings and stars. What a great experience this time. It's really bad. I believe that after this review is posted, an official review will appear below. I'm sorry, rectification, etc. They are all professional replies. Copy and paste. After a look, a five-star hotel has this. There are more than a hundred negative reviews. You can imagine how rubbish the hotel‚Äôs management problems are. Avoid lightning.

When I woke up the next morning in the bathroom, I discovered that there were blood stains on the corner of the unused pillow on the bed. The cleanliness of the room was also poor. Anyway, I have never seen such a bad intercontinental. The only thing I think is okay is that it is only 200 meters away from the nucleic acid testing point.

msg:The moment I walked in, I wondered if I lived in Intercontinental...
The price is about the same. The city view room opened in Sanlitun, Beijing. When it arrived at Shanghai Intercontinental, it became a corner room in the most corner. It doesn't matter if the room is slanted, the key is that the floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides can't close the curtains in the middle? Sleeping with a lot of light? LOL. There isn't even a charging jack at the bedside. To charge your phone, you need to sit on a stool five hundred meters away... My God, it's better than you. What about Intercontinental? ? ? Hotel service is also to die for, not even as good as a budget chain hotel... What are you doing? The order includes two breakfasts. Check in. The front desk can't even tell you the breakfast time? Or it was ten o'clock the next morning. I looked at the order and realized that I brought breakfast... and the Shanghai woman who answered the phone at the hotel reservation center. How arrogant are you? I asked two questions, and then hung up before I finished speaking. Do you understand what needs and questions I have? Did you do it? Was the crooked little room open for dogs? Impressed. Quickly delist and hang 4 stars safely, I vomited.

I forgot to get invisible braces at the hotel, so I called to look for them. I didn't see if I could find them for the guests first, but asked me what to get them. They only got them at 9am and 5pm. The nucleic acid at the door was closed before two o'clock, and the manager looked arrogant, so we sealed the tube and didn't do it. Good words can be said well. üôÑÔ∏è

From reception at the front desk, arranging to upgrade the executive room, to the warm experience of dinner, the thoughtful service and the taste of the dishes are all worthy of the five-star standard. The buffet in the morning is even more varied to suit your different choices. If you are vacationing in Shanghai in summer, trust me, choose the InterContinental Hotel.

msg:It's not the first time I've stayed here, because it's close to home, and I'll come here when I have something to do. This time, my friends chose this place when they came to Shanghai. Although the hotel is a bit old, the overall maintenance of the room is okay. The uncle at the door and the uncle of the gym have a good attitude. I want to rant about two points
1: When I arrived, it was about 4:00 pm. There was only one group of guests checking in at the front desk. One of the staff was helping the guests. The other one, Derek, gave me a look and lowered his head to look at the computer, and then he could only go up and ask. Is this counter available for check-in? Very impatient tone to say a word. This attitude is not as good as that of a fast hotel. The hotel needs to strengthen training.
2: The breakfast room, if you spend money to eat it, you can eat it with breakfast in the room. I didn't have time to eat breakfast before, but this time I have time to eat it. That's it, I don't feel that it has reached the level of InterContinental. The breakfast at InterContinental Nanjing really surprised me.
I hope the hotel can strengthen the management, the breakfast can be a little richer, increase the leader, and take the initiative to ask if you need coffee or tea

It is estimated that the occupancy rate is not high and it coincides with the Spring Festival, so many places (pools) are not turned on. The little brother at the front desk helped me upgrade to the executive floor. The room is very spacious and bright! Very comfortable. Okay, let's talk about the annoying... The wooden door of the bathroom really sucks me. At night, I wanted to close the wooden door before going to bed, but it got stuck halfway through. Can't open, can't close. In the middle of the night, the engineering depar**ent came up and was busy, and the wooden bathroom door finally opened. Besides, how scary this "induction toilet" is! Normal situation: When someone enters the bathroom, the toilet will automatically open. What doesn't make sense is: I'm already lying in bed, why is the toilet still sensing in the middle of the night? ! I live alone, may I ask who else is in the room! ? ! ? In addition to hygiene: when I adjusted the position of the pillow, two small insects flew out of it...

msg:There was a typhoon yesterday and the flight back to Shenzhen was cancelled. I stayed in Shanghai for one more day, thinking about taking the children to the Natural History Museum the next day, so I decided to book the InterContinental Jing'an Hotel. We arrived late, and there was no one to help with the luggage at the entrance of the lobby. Maybe the weather was bad. The room is on the 18th floor, with big windows looking at the road. The pattern is square and square. This intercontinental hotel should be longer. Many electrical appliances are malfunctioning, such as TV remote control. There is also no way to adjust the mode of the air conditioner. The temperature is increased since entering the room, but the display is always 24‚ÑÉ, and the body cold is below 20‚ÑÉ. After being awake in the middle of the night, calling someone from the engineering depar**ent over could not solve it. Simply turned off the air conditioner. This hotel needs a refurbishment and staff service improvement. I hope I can have a better experience next time I stay here.

It starts to get stuck like a butt kick after five minutes of watching it; the charging socket on the bedside is also, it‚Äôs only charged for a minute and it breaks and there is no way to charge it. There is also no way to charge the sink. Put the faucet on the right hand side. When you catch the water, you can only use it if you are afraid that your right hand is disabled. There is also breakfast, and the dishes are poor. At least it is professional and hygienic. The next small wontons are mixed together in a funnel. Next, I was impatient to ask the waiter where the spoon was. This is the intercontinental five-star standard? I am embarrassed to charge this price at this level. Will never come again next time! ! !

Moreover, the picture room did not match the actual situation. I asked the front desk and said it was me. Wrong. I thought that the twin beds could be merged, but it was not. In order to prevent our twin beds from merging, we deliberately made a very small fixed table. This small table was built out of the sky, with sharp corners. It‚Äôs easy for kids to run into sleep. I asked the front desk what time to check out, and I just said 12 o‚Äôclock, OK. I‚Äôve stayed in countless five-star cities, none of which is like this. Generally, it will extend us 1-2 hours. .It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt give us a delay, but don‚Äôt let the waiter come to remind you. Just knock on the door at 12 o‚Äôclock. It‚Äôs really the first time you have encountered it. Besides, they don‚Äôt give us free parking, and the cap is 80 per night. I will never live again next time. Thank you.

msg:Our family of four checked in on Chris**as Day and spent more than 8,000 in two rooms for 4 days. Disappointed, I feel like this hotel is really sorry for the old brand InterContinental. First of all, Ctrip indicates that the hotel was renovated in 2018. After checking in, I found that the facilities were old. I asked the staff and they said they were renovated in 2006. Three of the four bathroom ceiling lights were broken (room 1606). I feel cheated by Ctrip. Secondly, when I go to have breakfast every day, the lady at the door never says good morning, but directly asks what room number it is. He didn't even take the seat, and didn't ask whether he wanted coffee or tea. Breakfast is served in the huge hall on the first floor, which is cool in winter. According to employees, Intercontinental's China headquarters is in the same building. Do the executives really know about the problems in this model hotel under their feet? I will never stay in Intercontinental again.

When checking in, the front desk did not ask or introduce the rights of platinum members, including whether there was room upgrade, whether there were welcome snacks or fruits, etc. As a result, no welcome fruits were received until check-out. When I checked in, I told the front desk that I would check out at 14:00 and not to call me to confirm whether to extend my stay. However, after 12 o'clock, I still received a call from the front desk asking whether to extend my stay. In addition, the bed in the room has obvious dents, making it uncomfortable to sleep on. To be honest, this hotel is not worthy of its price.

The room facilities are very new and readily available. It's just across from Shanghai Station, about 300 meters walk. It is very convenient to call a taxi. Here comes the point, service! We arrived at 10:30, and the hotel room had not been cleaned. We went out to play at 12 o'clock. When we arrived at the hotel more than 2 o'clock, we upgraded the view room to the 31st floor of the executive room, and the view was invincible. The response to room service calls was very prompt. Because I took the kids to the Nature Museum to play, I came back and checked out a bit later, and also delayed our check out until 3 o'clock. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool and gym are also very clean and comfortable. I have stayed in Sanya Ritz and Conrad. I think this hotel has the best service experience at present.

After five minutes of showering, water flooded into the living room. After feedback to the customer service, I was told to move to the room next door. During this period, his attitude was not sincere and he kept emphasizing that he was new and didn't know there was a problem with this room so he assigned it to me. After I moved to the next room, the musty smell was very strong. I thought I had booked an intercontinental, right? The cleaning lady felt the smell was strong and sprayed a lot of air purifier inside. The customer service said they would send an air purifier to change the air. They saw that I was completely dissatisfied, and immediately smiled and said they would give me a special late check-out time to 2:00. To be honest, I won't come again, and I don't have any expectations for the InterContinental brand.

What people are talking about, putting a cup in the shower, starting the water to take a bath, opening and closing the toilet lid, all can be perfectly picked up.
      There may be energetic young people around the station. They usually go back to their rooms after midnight and form gangs in groups to roam the mountains and forests. Then the nightlife has just begun. They play cards, werewolf, and have emotional night conversations until five in the morning. The sky is bright, and combined with the hotel's screen-divided rooms, you can perfectly experience the immersive real-life NPC script killing.

The most annoying thing is! At 1:30 in the middle of the night, the waiter kept ringing the doorbell to deliver slippers! ! Inexplicably throw two pairs of slippers in the door! ! Seriously disturb our rest!
The video I posted is the noise in the room

msg:It's a big, big, bad experience. I booked more than 1,000 rooms, and then the parking fee cost 90. I feel that a business five-star hotel does not provide parking for customers, and the room smells and has hair that has not been cleaned. Please communicate with the housekeeping depar**ent. , you push me and I push you, I guess the hotel is too big to manage.

msg:An accommodation that shocked the whole world....
First of all, the service is very good, especially the old man at the door (speaking in Hong Kong accent). The front desk also changed us to a quiet room after we asked to change rooms.
The most fatal problem of the hotel is the sound insulation. You can hear the sound of the faucet turning on and off and the toilet flushing next door, as well as the sound of doors opening and closing in several rooms in the surrounding area.
The climax came. At 11 o'clock in the evening, I could clearly hear the sound of sex next door, as if there was only a curtain between us... In these ten minutes, I really wanted to scream countless times. But it wasn't the customer's fault, so I just called the front desk and said I needed to change rooms.
After changing rooms, we thought we would be given a room type, but later we found out that it was different. There were thick mats in front of the pool, and there was mouthwash where the body lotion was placed. Only then did we realize that this was another room type that cost hundreds of dollars more. I can't laugh or cry.
