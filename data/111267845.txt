Cons: The breakfast is very poor, and when I checked in, I specifically asked if it was a set meal or buffet, and they said it was buffet. As a result, I got a portion of porridge, steamed buns and eggs per person. If I had known this, I would not have set the alarm to get up early.
Service needs to be improved. It was a good thing that they gave us desserts in the evening, but when we were taking a shower and going to the toilet, the waiter pushed the door open directly. It was too embarrassing. I said sorry and left. No apology when I checked out

Especially on the night we arrived, it snowed heavily. The next morning, the hotel was covered in snow, as if we had traveled through time, and it was beautiful. The room facilities are complete and very comfortable.
Then there is the remarkable service. It was almost midnight when we arrived, and the temperature was about minus 6 degrees Celsius. The uncle on duty responded to every request. In the morning, the snow was frozen, and the aunts melted the ice on the stairs in front of our door to prevent us from falling. There is also the sweet water every night. The young lady braved the severe cold and delivered it to our room. Every sip of the sweet water warmed our hearts. There are many thoughtful services, which make us still feel so warm when we think of this short stay.
The hotel's dinner is also very attentive, with fresh ingredients and first-class taste.
In short, this hotel has beautiful scenery and a warm team. It is perfect and a place I want to go again.

2. The hotel's catering is cost-effective, not greasy, and the ingredients are very fresh.
Although it is a parent-child theme, there are few recreational facilities for children. It is very cold in winter and in the mountains, so it is almost impossible to go outdoors to play on the slide. It is still suitable for slightly older children, who can climb the mountain,

msg:I am a newbie coming to Hangzhou for internship. The internship period is about to end, so I will find a place to go every weekend. This time I came to Ninghai and made a deliberate choice to avoid other popular attractions and come to this small county.

Hotel selection: In the beginning, I was attracted by the feeling of mountains and mist in the promotional pictures, so I chose this place. After arriving, I found that the weather has been really good these past two days, so I didn't enjoy the fairy-like feeling. But at night there was something unexpected.

Location: The hotel is located at the foot of Lianghuang Mountain, and it is very convenient to go up the mountain. I am not traveling by car, so I need to take a taxi. It takes about 20 minutes to drive from Ninghai Station. There are no shops around the hotel, so you can buy some snacks and dry food in advance before coming. Of course, excluding self-driving, it is about a 10-minute drive from Qiantong Ancient Town, and you can also go shopping there.

Room: The room is large, the bathtub is large, and the view is very good. It would be better if it is on the second floor. (Sorry for being uneducated) It can completely meet your needs for vacation. Everything in the hotel room is free including mini bar, fruit snacks, and wine.

Facilities: The outdoor swimming pool is not open due to the season, but there is an area across the lobby where you can play pool, board games, coffee, cookies and cakes. It's quite leisurely. At the back of the hotel, there are some free activity areas through the guest rooms, where you can play badminton, which is quite pleasant.

Finally, it‚Äôs up to you to see the surprise I mentioned earlier with your eyes.

In winter like this, sitting on a cold toilet is not suitable for people of any age. The rooms are spacious. Clean and neat Breakfast is not much. But the fruit is the best, the freshest. Overall, the staff took good care of our group.

The environment is very good, at the foot of Lianghuang Mountain, the air is very good.
The whole hotel is designed with small low buildings, and the density of the buildings is very low, so the experience is also very good.
In addition to living, it is also very suitable for strolling. The sunshine during the day is beautiful, and the dim lights at night are also very flavorful.
The room is large, the toiletries used are also good, and the overall facilities are in line with the price.
The most surprising and comfortable thing is the service of this hotel.
In addition to the welcome fruit of the day, it will also give a dinner for two, drinks, coffee, and red wine from the restaurant bar in the room. Wine, good night drinks, fireside tea, souvenirs and tickets for tours
I really like the drinks here. The drinks on the second night were in a thermos cup because we returned to the hotel late. It was really comfortable to drink a cup of warm red dates and white fungus soup before going to bed
The staff here will also study some small desserts and drinks. The hot red wine given at dinner is very delicious and makes people fall in love with hot red wine again
The fireside tea is also very textured, and the quality of the dishes is very high. It is really comfortable to eat sweet potatoes and fruits and drink milk tea in the warm sun
In short, this place is very suitable for a comfortable vacation

Manager Xiao Wang at the front desk has a smile and is responsive to all requests. Miss Yuanyuan is also very enthusiastic! The butler service is excellent! After placing the order from Ctrip, they immediately contacted me to inquire about the arrival time, etc. The next day we went to climb Lianghuang Mountain, and they were also very considerate and asked if the journey was going well. Lunch was ready for us when we descended back to the hotel. When we went to visit Qiantong Ancient Town, the car didn‚Äôt come, but Mr. Dong personally took us to the ancient town! Thank you so much! In addition to welcome fruits, the hotel also gave a bottle of red wine, and the front child was given a souvenir of three treasures before leaving! The sugar water before going to bed is Tremella fungus, wolfberry, lotus seed, and lily soup, which is delicious! Very warm!
Thank you for your hospitality and warm reception for two days!
In addition to its own comfort, spaciousness, cleanliness and elegant charm, this hotel also has Qiantong Ancient Town and Lianghuang Mountain attractions as highlights. Lianghuang Mountain is the place where the travel notes of Xu Xiake, the Chinese travel saint, begin. It has certain significance for people who love to travel and is worth visiting! The entrance to Lianghuang Mountain is about 500 meters next to the hotel, and the location is very convenient! Lianghuang Mountain has waterfalls and beautiful scenery! The glass bridge and sky mirror on the mountain give you an extraordinary experience! Qiantong Ancient Town is like a painting with strong ancient charm, romantic and poetic!

There is a magic carpet that goes up the mountain but I didn‚Äôt do it (because it goes directly to the top of the mountain). It‚Äôs easy to go down the mountain.

There is coffee every day, and I also brought my own fresh milk and asked the waiter to make me a latte (this is entirely because I have some requirements for milk, and their own latte is not bad). The mini bar in the room is also good, and I like to drink it. The ü•∞welcome fruit mini bar will be replenished every day!
The hotel is right next to the Lianghuang Mountain Scenic Area, and they can be sent directly to the top of the mountain, and experience the glass trestle and glass slide all the way down. My legs and feet were still sore the next day after I came down like this. I couldn‚Äôt imagine climbing up and coming down again. My legs would probably be disabled. Thank you to the lobby manager for sending us to the top of the mountain. The road up the mountain is quite narrow!
I would like to make some suggestions. First of all, the parking lot of the hotel is not very complete. I am worried about pebbles flying on the gravel road with my new car that is half a year old. There are also dirt roads. I have to find a place to wash my car when I go back!
Secondly, due to the unavoidable nature of various insects at the foot of the mountain, the banana tree at the door of the room kept losing petals, and there were bees and flies at the door. I asked for them to be cleaned when I checked in for a new room, but when I came back at night, I didn‚Äôt know whether they had fallen off again or forgotten them. Anyway, the door was closed. There were still flower petals and flies, but when I checked out, I saw someone doing disinfection or killing. It felt like they were listening carefully!
The sweet soups we stayed at for 2 nights were different, but they were all delicious. But the breakfast is the same for both days. It is recommended to change it a little bit. Some people don‚Äôt like porridge for breakfast but they have no other choice.
Overall, the hotel is very good. This is the best choice to stay in Lianghuang Mountain!

Although we did not dine at the hotel, the details were really impressive. Comfortable.
The only flaw I felt about the entire hotel was that the breakfast was a bit poor. The portion was enough for us, but not delicious. I only ate fruits and eggs for breakfast on the two days. The porridge on the first day was still thin. The porridge delivered to the room the next day was like paste and was really unappetizing.

msg:The geographical location is unique, relying on Xu Xiake's Lianghuang Mountain.
The Hui-style architecture combines turrets and bamboo forests, and uses lighting effects to fully reflect the petty bourgeoisie sentiment!
It is a pity that the facilities are lacking and the construction has not been completed. The children's playground has not been built, the parking lot has not been paved with cement, the swimming pool is undisturbed and unattended, the laundry room is actually a utility room, the furniture is made of particle boards, and the sockets are third-rate brands of international electricians. The reaction The cobwebs under the table were not cleaned twice. The spire design on the second floor is very unique. Unfortunately, the installation of the ceiling lights did not take into account the human body and the person taking the photo can't open their eyes. It is really not in line with the high-end price point. What a pity.

msg:The hotel is right at the entrance of Lianghuang Mountain Scenic Area, and the location is good. Except for the parking lot and some children's play facilities which are not yet fully completed, everything else is almost complete. It can be seen from the hardware that more care has been taken in the design and construction. In terms of service, the attitude of the staff is very friendly, but the overall feeling is that there is room for improvement in terms of professionalism. In addition, the food needs to be greatly improved, especially the breakfast, which completely does not match the positioning of the resort hotel and is too simple.
