I booked a Fengyin room, but was given a room on the first floor… There is no view from the front or back… You can only see the hotel corridor and the road outside… The picture and text are seriously inconsistent… The terrace in the picture must be fake…

The self-service package was very thoughtful, including everything from snacks to dinner, and the food tasted good. The most praiseworthy thing is the hotel's service, especially the hotel manager.

Cons: The breakfast is very poor, and when I checked in, I specifically asked if it was a set meal or buffet, and they said it was buffet. As a result, I got a portion of porridge, steamed buns and eggs per person. If I had known this, I would not have set the alarm to get up early.
Service needs to be improved. It was a good thing that they gave us desserts in the evening, but when we were taking a shower and going to the toilet, the waiter pushed the door open directly. It was too embarrassing. I said sorry and left. No apology when I checked out

msg:First of all, Xia Ke Yuan Resort Hotel is a place full of surprises. The hotel is beautiful, with Hui-style architecture and houses scattered in an orderly manner. Especially on the night we arrived, it snowed heavily. The next morning, the hotel was covered in snow, as if we had traveled through time, and it was beautiful. The room facilities are complete and very comfortable.
Then there is the remarkable service. It was almost midnight when we arrived, and the temperature was about minus 6 degrees Celsius. The uncle on duty responded to every request. In the morning, the snow was frozen, and the aunts melted the ice on the stairs in front of our door to prevent us from falling. There is also the sweet water every night. The young lady braved the severe cold and delivered it to our room. Every sip of the sweet water warmed our hearts. There are many thoughtful services, which make us still feel so warm when we think of this short stay.
The hotel's dinner is also very attentive, with fresh ingredients and first-class taste.
In short, this hotel has beautiful scenery and a warm team. It is perfect and a place I want to go again.

1. The room is large, with a good view, very quiet, and very photogenic. There is an L-shaped long sofa, which the children like very much. They are very happy and jump around on the sofa.
2. The hotel's catering is cost-effective, not greasy, and the ingredients are very fresh.
Although it is a parent-child theme, there are few recreational facilities for children. It is very cold in winter and in the mountains, so it is almost impossible to go outdoors to play on the slide. It is still suitable for slightly older children, who can climb the mountain,

msg:I am a newbie coming to Hangzhou for internship. The internship period is about to end, so I will find a place to go every weekend. This time I came to Ninghai and made a deliberate choice to avoid other popular attractions and come to this small county.

Hotel selection: In the beginning, I was attracted by the feeling of mountains and mist in the promotional pictures, so I chose this place. After arriving, I found that the weather has been really good these past two days, so I didn't enjoy the fairy-like feeling. But at night there was something unexpected.

Location: The hotel is located at the foot of Lianghuang Mountain, and it is very convenient to go up the mountain. I am not traveling by car, so I need to take a taxi. It takes about 20 minutes to drive from Ninghai Station. There are no shops around the hotel, so you can buy some snacks and dry food in advance before coming. Of course, excluding self-driving, it is about a 10-minute drive from Qiantong Ancient Town, and you can also go shopping there.

Room: The room is large, the bathtub is large, and the view is very good. It would be better if it is on the second floor. (Sorry for being uneducated) It can completely meet your needs for vacation. Everything in the hotel room is free including mini bar, fruit snacks, and wine.

Facilities: The outdoor swimming pool is not open due to the season, but there is an area across the lobby where you can play pool, board games, coffee, cookies and cakes. It's quite leisurely. At the back of the hotel, there are some free activity areas through the guest rooms, where you can play badminton, which is quite pleasant.

Finally, it’s up to you to see the surprise I mentioned earlier with your eyes.

It turned out that he had put in as much water as his ankles. The water isn't hot anymore. The feeling must end immediately. I would like to use a toilet that can adjust the temperature. In winter like this, sitting on a cold toilet is not suitable for people of any age. The rooms are spacious. Clean and neat Breakfast is not much. But the fruit is the best, the freshest.

The environment is very good, at the foot of Lianghuang Mountain, the air is very good.
The whole hotel is designed with small low buildings, and the density of the buildings is very low, so the experience is also very good.
In addition to living, it is also very suitable for strolling. The sunshine during the day is beautiful, and the dim lights at night are also very flavorful.
The room is large, the toiletries used are also good, and the overall facilities are in line with the price.
The most surprising and comfortable thing is the service of this hotel.
In addition to the welcome fruit of the day, it will also give a dinner for two, drinks, coffee, and red wine from the restaurant bar in the room. Wine, good night drinks, fireside tea, souvenirs and tickets for tours
I really like the drinks here. The drinks on the second night were in a thermos cup because we returned to the hotel late. It was really comfortable to drink a cup of warm red dates and white fungus soup before going to bed
The staff here will also study some small desserts and drinks. The hot red wine given at dinner is very delicious and makes people fall in love with hot red wine again
The fireside tea is also very textured, and the quality of the dishes is very high. It is really comfortable to eat sweet potatoes and fruits and drink milk tea in the warm sun
In short, this place is very suitable for a comfortable vacation

The buildings are staggered and the density is very low, which is very suitable for vacation and rest
As for climbing and Qiantong Ancient Town, to be honest, there is nothing to see in winter.

The hotel has a quiet and elegant environment, making it a good choice for a relaxing vacation and a place of tranquility. The hotel service is attentive and meticulous. Manager Xiao Wang at the front desk has a smile and is responsive to all requests. Miss Yuanyuan is also very enthusiastic! The butler service is excellent! After placing the order from Ctrip, they immediately contacted me to inquire about the arrival time, etc. The next day we went to climb Lianghuang Mountain, and they were also very considerate and asked if the journey was going well. Lunch was ready for us when we descended back to the hotel. When we went to visit Qiantong Ancient Town, the car didn’t come, but Mr. Dong personally took us to the ancient town! Thank you so much! In addition to welcome fruits, the hotel also gave a bottle of red wine, and the front child was given a souvenir of three treasures before leaving! The sugar water before going to bed is Tremella fungus, wolfberry, lotus seed, and lily soup, which is delicious! Very warm!
Thank you for your hospitality and warm reception for two days!
In addition to its own comfort, spaciousness, cleanliness and elegant charm, this hotel also has Qiantong Ancient Town and Lianghuang Mountain attractions as highlights. Lianghuang Mountain is the place where the travel notes of Xu Xiake, the Chinese travel saint, begin. It has certain significance for people who love to travel and is worth visiting! The entrance to Lianghuang Mountain is about 500 meters next to the hotel, and the location is very convenient! Lianghuang Mountain has waterfalls and beautiful scenery! The glass bridge and sky mirror on the mountain give you an extraordinary experience! Qiantong Ancient Town is like a painting with strong ancient charm, romantic and poetic!

There is a large lotus pond at the entrance of the lobby, and there are many welcoming pines inside the hotel. The environment is quiet and elegant, and it feels like a paradise.

Hygiene: The interior of the room is very new and clean, and the bedding is very comfortable to sleep on. Have a good dream! The space and layout of the room are quite bright.

Environment: I saw a photo of the glass plank road on Lianghuang Mountain right next to the hotel, which attracted me to stay here. After breakfast in the morning, I took the hotel’s complimentary tickets, enjoyed the hotel’s value-added services, and drove directly to the top of the mountain ( It’s so fun, it saves me the energy to climb mountains), I can use the small ticket package of 168/person to redeem the big ticket discount, and enjoy every event along the way! The glass plank road is worth checking out. If the weather is good, the best shooting time for the Sky Mirror is 15:00. There is a magic carpet that goes up the mountain but I didn’t do it (because it goes directly to the top of the mountain). It’s easy to go down the mountain.

Service: The service of Miss Wang Rong at the front desk is great. She explains carefully and provides considerate service. She takes great care of you during your stay!
There are welcome fruits during the day and sweet soup in the room at night!
Special note: One day before check-in, you need to make a reservation in advance.

There is coffee every day, and I also brought my own fresh milk and asked the waiter to make me a latte (this is entirely because I have some requirements for milk, and their own latte is not bad). The mini bar in the room is also good, and I like to drink it. The 🥰welcome fruit mini bar will be replenished every day!
The hotel is right next to the Lianghuang Mountain Scenic Area, and they can be sent directly to the top of the mountain, and experience the glass trestle and glass slide all the way down. My legs and feet were still sore the next day after I came down like this. I couldn’t imagine climbing up and coming down again. My legs would probably be disabled. Thank you to the lobby manager for sending us to the top of the mountain. The road up the mountain is quite narrow!
I would like to make some suggestions. First of all, the parking lot of the hotel is not very complete. I am worried about pebbles flying on the gravel road with my new car that is half a year old. There are also dirt roads. I have to find a place to wash my car when I go back!
Secondly, due to the unavoidable nature of various insects at the foot of the mountain, the banana tree at the door of the room kept losing petals, and there were bees and flies at the door. I asked for them to be cleaned when I checked in for a new room, but when I came back at night, I didn’t know whether they had fallen off again or forgotten them. Anyway, the door was closed. There were still flower petals and flies, but when I checked out, I saw someone doing disinfection or killing. It felt like they were listening carefully!
The sweet soups we stayed at for 2 nights were different, but they were all delicious. But the breakfast is the same for both days. It is recommended to change it a little bit. Some people don’t like porridge for breakfast but they have no other choice.
Overall, the hotel is very good. This is the best choice to stay in Lianghuang Mountain!

Although we did not dine at the hotel, the details were really impressive. Comfortable.
The only flaw I felt about the entire hotel was that the breakfast was a bit poor. The portion was enough for us, but not delicious. I only ate fruits and eggs for breakfast on the two days. The porridge on the first day was still thin. The porridge delivered to the room the next day was like paste and was really unappetizing.

msg:環境：景色非常好，酒店內新中式的設計樹木蔭蔭流水潺潺。獨幢別墅設計的客房排列整齊乾淨。周邊有樑皇山景區，客房裡看出去的山景也很不錯。大堂門口書上的風鈴真的是點睛之筆，微風吹來更加恬靜。
衞生：酒店是新開的，衞生整潔乾淨。
設施：設施都很新，活動中心有打球玩遊戲的空間。大堂的圍爐區域冬天過去真的感受到了温暖。
雙人中式晚餐:晚餐有A和B套餐，我們選擇了B套餐，出餐快東西也好吃。
酒店的早餐也是品種豐富精緻。
服務：感覺酒店的服務真的很值得一誇。從訂完房間之後馬上來加微信確定圍爐煮茶和晚餐預約的管家開始，到晚上温暖的晚安飲品。還有退房時的伴手禮和景區門票，真的事無鉅細的關心。晚餐考慮到有團建客人，幫我們安排在大堂吧，能更安靜得用餐。整體感覺酒店的服務有家的感覺。
以後來寧海肯定住這家了。

整個酒店環境氛圍很好，背山臨溪，山野度假感很強，再加上是那種新中式徽派建築，和這裏的山霧合在一起，就是東方水墨畫的感覺，出片率高，可以原圖直出～

他們的玩樂項目選擇很蠻多，像户外泳池、露營草坪、桌遊桌球這種網紅設施都有，還是比較適合帶全家人來個週末度假的

到店前，酒店管家就有跟我們對接行程，因為我們帶着小孩，所以他們有準備小童用品和玩具，第二天也給我們推薦了很多寶藏景區和小店，服務整體不錯~

       最值得稱讚的還要數服務。酒店工作人員態度都不錯，親切和善。尤其是董經理，讓每一位客人都能有賓至如歸的幸福感。

去時酒店入住客人不多，早餐為套餐，品種不多，衹能説是一般般。
酒店員工服務意識相當到位，禮貌待客，前台接待提前聯繫並添加微信，發送酒店位置。到店後還詳細介紹附近遊玩景點。離店還贈送了禮品。非常不錯的一次休閑度假。

￼一家值得真正度假酒店
環境.在梁皇山腳下《推門見青山、枕眠闻溪声》正如宣傳一样
服務：入住有水果、紅酒🍷，下午有咖啡，晚上有甜湯。全部Free.
特別谈一下这家酒店總經理🧑💼小董年青有為服務太貼心了，酒店送梁皇山門票，总经理小董且亲自开車送我們上山並特別关照注意事項⚠️半路上突然下起雨，小董经理把他的傘給我們找來雨披，下山回到酒店總經理親自为我們手工制作了熱Latte. 服務太貼心了，太👍贊。
下次去宁波我还住这家梁皇山下霞客苑酒店。
