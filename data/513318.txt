msg:The environment is great. The hotel yard is a park with beautiful scenery. Taking a walk on the lakeside trail in the morning is a particularly comfortable enjoyment! This time it coincides with the early spring in Shenyang, and the pink flowers and green willows are so beautiful. What is particularly memorable is that I stayed in Building 6, where Comrade Xiaoping stayed four times. It is the most unforgettable memory of this trip to Shenyang!

msg:Liaoning Friendship Hotel is worthy of being a guest hotel. It has a beautiful external environment, fresh air, green grass, and small guest room buildings nestled in a tree-lined garden. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and elegant, the front desk staff are warmly welcoming and attentive, and the rooms are clean and well-equipped. The breakfast is super delicious. It left us with wonderful memories. Thumbs up for such a good hotel in Shenyang, Liaoning.

One was stepped on to death by the child, and the rest ran into the cracks in the floor. We contacted the front desk to change rooms, but they said there was no room of the same type. We were told that we could check out if we did not stay there. As it was too late with the child, we had to accept the arrangement of the front desk!

msg:The room was a bit small and the aisle was so narrow that I couldn't even move my suitcase while walking. The refrigerator was not cooling and all the fruits in it were spoiled. The bathroom is quite large, with wet and dry separation and a large bathtub with hair in it. The decoration of the room is old and the wallpaper is still there. The bed is so hard and the pillows are not comfortable. The scenery outside is pretty good, it's very, very big. When we arrived, the taxi took us to the wrong place. The front desk of the hotel asked us to walk there by ourselves. We walked there for ten minutes with our children and their bags, so we couldn't send a car or someone to come. It's okay to lead the way. The service is completely lacking. It's like being indifferent and alienated in Hong Kong. I guess it's the confidence of a state-owned enterprise. Reviews say that the breakfast is very rich, but I haven’t seen a single picture. My own experience is that there are very few breakfast varieties. There are only two drinks, which are watered down, and two kinds of fruits. The snacks are meat buns and custard buns. The bread is only sliced ​​(I even ate moldy sliced ​​bread on the first day🍞), and then there are vegetable salads, noodles, porridge and egg fried rice. There are no cakes or desserts. This hotel is the worst among the five hotels in this itinerary. I feel sorry for myself for paying $100 to buy a double breakfast room. It is really a big injustice. I ordered takeout on the first night. I didn’t know not to let the takeout in at first, so I had to run to the gate to get it. Fortunately, I met a manager. When I asked for directions, he said it was a bit far, so he drove me back and forth. Thank you very much.

Although it is an old hotel, there are no problems with the sanitation and hardware facilities. The room is clean and warm, and the design style of the high ceiling and second-story loft is great. The environment is quiet and elegant, with a large park and lake where you can take photos and take a walk.
Especially praise the front desk service! Gentle, careful, professional and thoughtful, and polite!
I will choose to stay here next time I come to Shenyang.

msg:We have booked a lot of rooms at the Friendship Hotel, but overall our friends think the hotel has a nice environment outside with green trees, but the facilities inside the rooms are indeed very old, and the bathrooms feel very similar to public toilets in the 1980s. The front desk responded. It was not very timely. My friend made more than 10 calls to the front desk at 1 pm, but no one answered. The receptionist was also very cold when receiving the phone. He asked a simple question like "How to get to Building 4?" , the reply I received was to go out here and turn left, and you can ask about the rest when the time comes... The working attitude and professional service concept of the hotel front desk staff need to be greatly strengthened. Compared with the hotel background, maybe everyone will feel the same when booking a top-level suite. It will be different. If you are just visiting Shenyang or entertaining friends, I would not recommend this hotel. Because both the facilities inside and the attitude of the service staff are speechless.

The rooms we stayed in are located in different corners of the garden, which is an excellent experience for those who like immersive roaming. During my morning jog, I discovered that this place turned out to be a state hotel, full of towering ancient trees, birds singing and the fragrance of flowers, and the negative ion purification that filled the heart and spleen. To my heart, there were actually little squirrels scurrying out of the jungle... I had a great impression when I checked in in the lobby last night. This is an experience that coexists a sense of the times and a sense of modernity. A must-choice next time you come to Shenyang!

msg:The environment of the hotel is very good, with green trees, lakes and mountains, singing birds and fragrant flowers, and squirrels running around in the forest. The place where government leaders meet and rest is full of various official vehicles and groups of government drivers. The hotel lobby and some guest rooms are not in the same building, so you need to take a small shuttle bus in the park, of course, you can also walk. The room is very spacious and bright, with obvious hardware facilities in the style of a government reception hotel, good sanitation, noisy air conditioner, hard bed, and comfortable pillows. Overall, it does not reach the five-star level, some aspects are three-star level, and some aspects are four-star level. The two bedside lights in the room are not on, the bath water is not hot, and there are disposable bath bags and toilet traps. The attitude of the waiters is very good, and the breakfast is rich. It seems that the civil servants are eating well. There are no general commercial restaurants around, and you need to go far to see them.

The surrounding scenery is very good, with ancient trees forming forests, fresh air, and squirrels scurrying around in the forest Go, don't be afraid of people. There is also a Qingnian Lake, which is surrounded by a circle, which is very pleasant. It is the hotel I want to live in.
When I went to the front desk to check in at the hotel booked on Ctrip, the doorman was very enthusiastic, "Help us park the car, the front desk staff is warm and thoughtful, and inform us of the breakfast time." Hotel facilities are complete, clean and tidy. Breakfast is also good. Especially self-driving tour, parking is convenient.

I have to go to Building 1 to check in and then I will be assigned to Building 15. I took a suitcase and brought a child and went to the hotel again. Building No. 15, the front desk is indifferent, no one cares about you, and there is no shuttle bus to take you. What's more funny is that when you leave the deposit and check out, you have to go to Building No. 1. You have to drag a suitcase with your children and walk to it. Building No. 1, when you come out, the concierge waiter stands at the door and ignores you and refuses to help you with your things. Second, he greets the person driving a luxury car with a smile on his face. Is this the service level of Friendship Hotel? I think it’s just watching people order dishes. I won’t be staying in the future, and I will tell people around me to be careful. The overall service from top to bottom is poor. Watching people order dishes really makes you perform vividly.

The exclusive and private environment of the hotel is naturally not to be said. There are many small scenic spots in the garden, and the famous brand introductions on various trees are also very detailed, which has increased a lot of knowledge. I was lucky enough to meet little squirrels and various birds.

After leaving the hotel courtyard, there is a subway station, and the transportation is quite convenient. Regardless of the front desk or the cleaning lady, the attitude is super good!

The hotel is next to Beiling Park. Although there is a section of wall, you can hear the sound of grandpa and aunt exercising early in the morning, which makes you feel full of energy.
The greening rate of the hotel is very high. Big trees, lakes, and lawns are all in the hotel. The distance between buildings is also very large, and the view from the room is very good.
There were some small episodes when I checked in, and it was close to 24:00, but the staff contacted multiple depar**ents to solve the problem at the first time, and arranged it properly, and provided thoughtful service in the next few days.
I am very satisfied with this stay. If you come to Shenyang, Friendship Hotel is a very good choice.

2. The cleanliness of the room is poor. As shown in the picture, the floor is full of dust and scum. I don’t know how long it has been since I wiped the floor. After cleaning during the day, the room still has paper scraps and other garbage on the floor
3. The equipment and facilities are old, so it doesn't matter. The key is that the quilt cover is a little dirty, with stains remaining, and it doesn't look the same color as the pillowcase
4. The level of service is hard to describe. I checked in at 9:00 p.m., and I arranged building No. 15, but my brother sent me to No. 12. I went around in the dark building, and there was no one (including the door), and the corridor lights were not very good. Yes, the adults are scared... It took me a long time to find the room. The child was so frightened that he didn't dare to stay there. He called the front desk and almost scolded the person in the reservation depar**ent on the phone... He said there was no other room , I had to move back the next day, **... I won’t mention the details, it’s annoying, and I changed the room later, and I can still live there. After all, it’s not realistic to change hotels in the middle of the night
5. There is no breakfast in the hotel. I want to experience Shenyang early, but outsiders are not allowed to enter the hotel. They can only be delivered to the gate. You can call a battery car to pick it up, which is a bit troublesome
In summary, the garden environment is at the level of the state hotel, the hardware facilities in the room are old, the sanitation is worrying, and the service quality is rubbish

msg:友誼賓館是遼寧服務行業標桿，從入住辦理開始便始終感受到賓至如歸。同行2人，有1人午夜過後才抵達賓館登記，雖時間很晚，但前台經理仍精神狀態飽滿，值得學習。印象深刻的是，前台馮經理，細緻耐心，諮詢的很多問題都一直耐心解答，提出調換房間需求，會在客人面前把協調過程告知，即使滿足不了客人需求，也能贏得客人理解；另外，在續住辦理時，在滿房狀態下，能夠及時向客人解釋，並快速輸出解決方案，推薦距離最近的幾處酒店，並應客户需求幫助溝通協調預留房間，非常滿意！

遺憾的是，在退房過程中，也看到了另一波團體客人辦理入住時，向前台服務人員惡語相向，不理解不尊重。客户是上帝不假，但也不能吹毛求疵、肆意妄為，彼此尊重是做人辦事的基礎底線。但願此類現象越來越少發生！

最後找到這個了這家酒店，一開始因為比較“傳統”的名字並沒抱太大希望，直到辦入住才發現自己偶遇了“寶藏”，酒店房間設施談不上“高新”但非常乾淨，園區是我唯一遺憾，由於第二天要早早拔營趕往延吉沒辦法在花園般的園區內享受晨起的寧謐（睡懶覺為主因）

有機會專程來沈還會選這裏！
