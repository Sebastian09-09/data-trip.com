msg:My wife and I decided to visit Xi'an for her birthday from November 30th to December 4th, 2023, and we chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt Xi'an during that time. In short, it is an exceptional hotel, offering super delicious breakfast with a wide variety of both Western and Chinese dishes. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. For examples, the gentleman in the front door of the hotel always welcomed us with very beautiful smile, the lady who took care of our room every day, displaying meticulous attention to detail that never failed to surprise us. The employees at the Italian restaurant were exceptionally kind, going above and beyond to provide extraordinary care and respect. When they discovered it was my wife's birthday, they surprised us with a small cake, decorated our table with balloons, and even offered us complimentary cocktails.
Furthermore, the staff in the Lounge went out of their way to help me arrange a surprise birthday cake for my wife. They decorated the table with great care and passion, and even presented her with a thoughtful gift and a postcard, sharing their kind wishes with us. I almost forgot to mention that they also surprised me by offering a birthday cake when I was in my room. So, we ended up with three birthday cakes in one night that gave us the opportunity to share our joy and share a slice of happiness with the incredible staff. These are just some examples of their great team of their staff. Without doubt, I would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning to visit Xi'an.

msg:Grand Hyatt (Xi'an) is cheaper than Hyatt

If the price of Grand Hyatt is over 700 yuan, it is the only one in the city that is outsold by its younger brother Hyatt [laughing and crying]
The location is indeed a bit remote. The high-tech zone is still a bit far from the city, and it is not close to the scenic spots. From this point of view, it is understandable that the price is inverted with its younger brother.
The quality of all aspects is very online. The first-line brand is still trustworthy. The hardware facilities are well maintained. It doesn't look like a hotel that has been in use for six years. I won't say much about the service and hygiene, which are in line with the level of this price and brand [strong][strong][strong]
The hotel has a strong sense of design. Although the overall color scheme does not use red in a large area, the touch of crimson dotted in the details just highlights the brand's main color☞Grand Hyatt red. The lobby is not big, but the irregular glass skylight, special-shaped polyhedron lamps and white curved ***** decorations make it look very sci-fi and futuristic [proud] The gym and swimming pool are all available, and the scale is smaller than expected. The equipment and environment are very good. What surprised me was that there were seven or eight people exercising in the gym at 8 o'clock in the evening, which is rare [snickering] There are five restaurants in the hotel, including Chinese and Western food, buffet, and bar, which can meet all kinds of needs, but the overall quality is not outstanding, much inferior to W [shut up]
The room layout is quite alternative (standard room), with the aisle in the middle and double beds on both sides, probably considering the consideration of privacy. The indoor area is relatively large in the same level, but most of the space is given to the washing area, two independent washbasins, a separate bathroom with a sink, a shower room and a bathtub, and a dedicated separate cloakroom and ironing area [covering face] The TV is squeezed in a small corner on the side, which is quite unique [proud]
Although the layout of the room is not ordinary, the overall aesthetics are still online. The lines, colors, and decorations are integrated with many Chinese elements, and they can easily walk between classic and modern. All hardware facilities are top-notch, electric curtains, smart speakers, and electric switches are all available. The sanitary ware is Grohe, and even the room card is made of wood [laughing and crying]
However, there are some points. The disposable items are too confusing, there are slippers without brand logos, relatively inferior toothbrushes and combs, large bottles of shower gel and shampoo, and even razors are not provided. Drinking water is to save trouble and go directly to Nongfu Spring [picking nose]

msg:Let's talk about the hardware first. The hotel lobby is OK, but the hardware in the room is just average. The curtain fell down when it was pulled up on the first day. Fortunately, no one was hit. For Grand Hyatt Hotel, such hardware is not up to standard. The air conditioner is also very loud. We booked two rooms, one of which was very noisy, so we changed the room.
Let's talk about the service. It seems that no dedicated customer service contacted me when I checked in on the first day, but when I checked out on the last day, a customer service staff called to ask for a good review, which was not good.
Overall, I am a little disappointed with the level of Grand Hyatt.

msg:I chose Grand Hyatt Hotel for this trip to Xi'an. The hotel is very new. When booking the hotel, I noted that I wanted to stay on a higher floor. In the end, I was given the 32nd floor, which has a great view.
The day before departure, I received a call from the hotel housekeeper Molly. I tried to ask if I could upgrade the room type for free? After all, the May Day holiday was still two days away. I got a positive reply, which made me happy. The room is 50 square meters, and the cloakroom, toilet and shower are separated.
After checking in, the housekeeper Molly found that I didn't order breakfast in my room, and enthusiastically sent a three-day buffet breakfast and recommended special snacks, which are worth a try. In addition, knowing that I was going to climb Mount Huashan, she specially sent drinking water, which was very considerate.
Grand Hyatt Hotel is very close to the subway station, and it takes only five minutes to walk to the Zhangba Road subway station.
In addition, the breakfast is also very delicious, such as this Roujiamo. The restaurant of Grand Hyatt Hotel is trustworthy.

The original room 2709 was very noisy because of the renovation of the construction site opposite. I called the front desk and a tall and handsome manager helped us change to 2803. He responded quickly and solved the problem. The aunt who came to disturb the room cleaning on Wednesday was very detailed and put the things we used on the table covered with towels. It was quite professional. The treadmill in the gym prepared towels and bottled water in advance, which is a big plus for a fitness enthusiast!
Facilities: The facilities in the gym and the room are well maintained, and the mirrors and glass products are clean without scale residue
PS: This hotel has almost no disadvantages except that it is a little far from the scenic spot. It is not suitable for "special forces travel" partners, but it is very suitable for lazy people like us. In general, Grand Hyatt is very cost-effective, and the experience is beyond our expectations. If you come to Xi'an again, you will still choose Grand Hyatt!

The man at the front desk and I kept calling ** and it didn't work. In the end, we all wanted to abandon it. When I arrived, the front desk manager (a woman in her mid-40s) came over. She asked me what was in it. I said it was nothing expensive, just women's menstrual products. It was so late, so I didn't want it, but she said We gave it a try again, but we didn’t expect it to work. She said that our hotel can actually provide menstrual products, but traveling abroad is already very uncomfortable. Women who are sensitive during their menstrual period should use their favorite menstrual products. It feels so touching to be understood🥹
Also, because we were on a business trip with our children, we were given macarons for two nights, which were very delicious. Thank you~~

msg:Facilities: Not bad, not bad,
Service: I originally went here for service. Logically speaking, as the Grand Hyatt brand under Hyatt, the service must be meticulous, but there is almost no service throughout the whole process. I think the concierge and front desk in the hotel include all the glamorous services. Workers wearing suits should learn service awareness from the security guards at the door! None of the hotel staff we encountered when entering and exiting the elevator took the initiative to greet us, including the concierges standing on both sides of the door, who were in vain, just standing and chatting! There is almost no sense of service when facing guests coming in and out! Fortunately, we only made a reservation for one day. The next day we went to the Hilton Canopy in the Tang Dynasty. From the moment we arrived at the door to the moment we checked in, four hotel staff greeted us and took the initiative to help us carry our luggage. Everyone we met during our stay was very kind. A hotel staff all greets you proactively and provides service with a smile. This is the attitude a real high-end hotel should have! In comparison, Grand Hyatt Xi'an is simply outclassed by Hilton in terms of service. The difference is huge! You have the nerve to call me and ask for a good review? The room was also very stuffy. The room I lived in was like a sauna, with all the windows sealed and no air flowing! What’s even more outrageous is the design of your floor-to-ceiling windows. I thought there would be a good view, but it turned out to be a construction site! I really went from expecting to hanging with my heart completely dead! It's the same Grand Hyatt, but the service at Hefei Grand Hyatt is much better than yours! I simply wondered if I had found the wrong hotel! However, your hotel's service and the importance it attaches to its guests can be seen from the hotel's reply to Ctrip's negative review. You don't care at all! All templates can be pasted and copied! If you give me a human-machine reply to my lengthy negative review, then all passers-by who see my review, please step back from the cliff! I highly recommend the Hilton Canopy at the same level. It is located in the Tang Dynasty that never sleeps. The service is second to none! ! ! Forget it, I’d better ask everyone to appreciate my photography.

msg:Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt brand hotel in Shanghai, Chengdu and Suihang, I chose this place as my first stop when I visited the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties.
Different from the traditional impression of heavy history, sitting in the core area of ​​Xi'an Hi-tech CBD and surrounded by exquisite skyscrapers, this Grand Hyatt fully interprets the new look of the ancient capital.
The clever collision of classics and modernity creates the unique decoration of Xi'an Grand Hyatt. The competition between Shaanxi snacks and Western desserts awakens the taste buds of diners in the morning. The most touching thing is the attentive service of every Grand Hyatt employee, from the concierge who took the luggage and said cordially "Xi'an welcomes you, Grand Hyatt welcomes you" to the waiter in the coffee shop who helped me take care of my suit and tie, especially the front desk Niky and Linda took the initiative to upgrade the room, adding more wonderful memories to my Grand Hyatt trip.
See you in Chang'an, see you at Junyue.

msg:Extreme travel, temporary decision to come to Xi'an
I booked the Grand Hyatt on the high-speed rail and it was already eleven o'clock when I arrived at the store.
Room type: Executive Deluxe Suite
The lobby was very quiet and the waiter checked us in quickly.
The front desk clerk carefully wrote the morning dining time and dining floor on the room card cover.
The night view from the room on the 27th floor is quite nice.
Tips: Executive rooms have breakfast options on the 25th and 22nd floors.
Service: There are many people in the restaurant on the 22nd floor. Hygiene...emmmm is not very good.
There are no children's play facilities in the hotel, which is really not friendly!
The 24-hour service is still very nice! I decided to let the child sleep on the small sofa in the bedroom at night. I needed to ask for a new quilt to cover it. At one o'clock in the morning, the waiter still got it done quickly. It was still great.

btw The second day I stayed at the hotel was my child’s birthday, and the hotel also gave me a free fruit cake🍰red wine🍷chocolate🍫, which was great! Great experience during the trip to Xi'an

I have stayed in a hotel with the best service attitude. The facilities are also very complete and the breakfast is rich. I brought a child with me, so there were a lot of people in the group, so it was a bit troublesome to have food and accommodation. There was no scorn or anything like that during the whole process. They were always very patient with us. It was a great experience and left a very good impression on Xi'an.
Special praise for the handsome guy Edison in the lobby, he is handsome and kind-hearted!

There were some minor incidents when I checked into Grand Hyatt, but Linda from the guest service center was very professional and solved the problem in time. And the communication was warm and warm, which was not inferior to the brands I stayed in, such as Ritz, Wendong, Park Hyatt, and Peninsula. It was better than Four Seasons overall. I would like to give praise and change your room in time. The suite was very comfortable and large, and the executive lounge was also good. Since my family was traveling, we booked an executive twin room in addition to the suite. The interesting thing was that the door between the executive twin room and the suite was actually a screen, which was very interesting to play hide-and-seek.

I booked a twin room. The room type is a bit strange. The bed is on both sides of the door. The bathroom, shower room and dressing room are all independent. It feels like all the space is spent on this, and the space of the room is average. You can use the mini bar as you like, but there are actually three cans of soft drinks in it. The most important thing is, why is the room so hot? Even if the air conditioner is turned off, it is useless. The completely enclosed space is so hot that I can’t breathe. After reacting, I brought the air cooler and turned it on. It was so noisy that I really didn't want to stay in the room for a minute. I will definitely not stay here again if I come to Xi'an again.

The entire hotel's facilities are relatively new and well maintained. The decoration style is simple and modern, and the Chinese style elements are the finishing touch. The hotel as a whole is very high-end and tasteful. There are large tables and two sets of sofas in the room, which are suitable for working, eating, or having a drink. The cloakroom is large enough to store a lot of luggage. I like the bathroom design very much. The hidden toilet, spacious bathtub, and oversized ceiling spray greatly enhance the happiness of living. The breakfast category is very complete, and there is no shortage of delicious food with Xi'an characteristics. I have stayed in many Hyatt hotels. It is no exaggeration to say that I think the hardware of this hotel is enough to be listed on Andaz or Park Hyatt. The brand style is thoroughly displayed in this hotel. , is what I think a Hyatt hotel should be like. The hotel price is really competitive in Xi'an. Downstairs is a two-story large Tsutaya Bookstore. I bought the last remaining ymo 40-year photo album inside, which was a great surprise!
I would like to express my special thanks to Ms. Minnie from the guest service depar**ent for her attentive service. She not only called in advance to inquire about my preferences, arranged the room, prepared fresh welcome fruits for us, but also constantly cared about our various demands. Introducing the hotel's facilities and benefits made us feel like coming to Hyatt was like returning to our own home. Due to time constraints, I only stayed for one night and left in a hurry. If I have the opportunity to stay in Xi'an for a longer time next time, I will definitely come to Grand Hyatt Xi'an again to experience the beauty of Chang'an!

After checking in, I received five-star praise. It is true that the hotel's central air conditioning and temperature control and the high-altitude night view are slightly lacking. But the transportation is very convenient with Line 6, the facilities are new, and it has a sense of design and solidity. This photo cannot be captured. The service attitude is good and standardized, and the check-in and check-out procedures are very convenient. The most favorable thing is the catering. The breakfast is very rich. The executive light meal served from 18:00-20:00 in the evening at the Regency Club is definitely not perfunctory. There are bolognese noodles and wonton noodles made on site, paired with drinks, which can be used as dinner. . Therefore, the price/performance ratio is still very high and it is worth recommending.

msg:The room is not well maintained and looks old. There is no waiter actively providing coffee and tea service for breakfast, unless you request it from the waiter, it is very slow. No one took the dishes from beginning to end, and the breakfast table was littered with cups and plates. The meal was not replenished in time. There was no butter on the buffet table. Tell the waiter in the stand and he will ask you to ask the chef at the open stall at another dining table. You went to pick up the meal in the middle of the way. When you came back, the chair was dragged away. I can’t imagine this. It's the Grand Hyatt. The room rate of more than 1,500 is nearly double the daily room rate of this hotel. I accept the price increase during the National Day holiday, but the required services cannot be reduced! The first round of mini bar included in the room rate is free, and only four drinks including Coke and Sprite are inferior to express hotels such as Atour and All Seasons. We stayed for four days in a row, and after the first day we didn't even replenish what we paid for.

It’s so worth it😍😍😍
I came to Xi'an on a business trip and saw that the reviews were very high and the surrounding facilities were complete. I also had my heart set on Tsutaya Bookstore. It was perfect😘
Warm and considerate service, good attention to details and a good sense of boundaries~
The room was clean and tidy, with a good view and a rich breakfast. I was lucky enough to go to the club salon on the 25th floor, which is very suitable for business negotiations and quiet.
Xi'an, looking forward to meeting you next time😎😎😎

msg:The hotel environment is OK, but the service is far inferior to that of the Marriott Group's Renaissance. I ordered takeaway at the hotel and put it in the express cabinet on the first day. I went down to pick it up. I didn't have any problems. The next night, it was said that a robot would deliver it. I ordered oily noodles. I had to make several phone calls from the time the delivery guy called to inform me that it was delivered, and then the robot delivered it for nearly 20 minutes (there is a video to prove it). The front desk also shirked responsibility with me and said that it was the problem of the delivery guy (there is a recording as evidence), and I said: First, the delivery guy sent it to the express cabinet and I can pick it up by myself, or send it to the front desk when your robot is very slow. It's OK to call me to go downstairs to pick up the food. First of all, I don't want to go downstairs to pick up the food. Why didn't you tell me that the delivery time will be long? The noodles will be cold and dry. What's the logic of the good delivery guy? Second, I won’t blame anyone if I’m still willing to wait for the noodle to be hunched over even though your front desk informed me that the robot delivery was slow. The staff also gave one excuse after another. I like the city of Xi'an very much but forget about this hotel. The location is also very remote and less convenient than the core area, and the service is average.

msg:I must express my extreme dissatisfaction with the serious errors and unprofessional behavior in your hotel's service. Although I clearly communicated with the front desk and ensured that my reservation included two breakfasts, your hotel's service team was extremely negligent in its implementation. What is even more unacceptable is that even though I had clearly communicated this issue with the front desk again during the meal, the service staff of your hotel rudely interrupted us again while we were having dinner and having an important business conversation. Ask for breakfast fee.

This continuous service failure and neglect of customer needs not only caused great embarrassment to me and my customers, but also seriously damaged the image of your hotel. A basic reservation request was not handled properly and the same issue persisted despite clear communication, which reflects serious deficiencies in your hotel's service management and staff training.

It is not recommended to stay if traveling, it is too far from the attractions. Design is the foundation, but it cannot make up for the lack of experience. For example, the noisy air conditioner, the kettle that seems to be broken, and the tasteless high-altitude scenery (it doesn’t matter if it’s really high).

msg:I was a little nervous about staying at the Grand Hyatt during the Spring Festival, but the final experience exceeded expectations. Although the decoration and positioning of the Grand Hyatt seems to be business-oriented, it is very friendly to children. During the Spring Festival when housing is in short supply, the cute little girl at the front desk saw two lively little boys and helped us upgrade the room to provide the children with a better view and more space for activities. Thank you again Song Yanning. Every detail of the hotel is exquisite and stylish, from design to decoration to equipment to catering and service. Although it is impossible to be perfect, you can feel that everyone in the hotel strives to achieve perfection. Cleaning the room every day, silently tidying up the various items thrown by the children on the floor, folding the clothes, and carefully replenishing every item in the room, it is so warm. The breakfast is good, the swimming pool is good, the spa is also very good, clean, professional and persistent. As someone who once slipped and injured himself while wearing hotel slippers, I respect the hotel for refusing to wear slippers for meals. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but this time I gave a special thumbs up to the Grand Hyatt.
In addition, I am finally glad that I lived outside the scenic area during this Spring Festival. Compared with the old inner city, I prefer the modern high-tech zone. Moreover, during this Spring Festival, the traffic inside the city wall and the city that never sleeps is tight, and because we are far away from the core, we not only avoid The crowds were noisy and a considerable amount of congestion was avoided. So, who would have thought that being far away can actually be an advantage😄.

msg:As a member of Hyatt, it is the hotel of choice in every city. The location of Grand Hyatt is in line with my preferences. It avoids the city center with traffic, but it is not too remote. It is more suitable to take a taxi and drive. The style of the hotel is unified, retro Nordic style, and the hotel is rich in color, which is more attractive than the minimalist style.
Facilities: The Grand Hyatt in Xi'an is a bit smaller overall. The room layout is rectangular and divided into three spaces: the living room, bedroom and bathroom. I personally prefer a more square room. There are no ventilation windows in the room. Three floor-to-ceiling windows have good sound insulation effect, but the windows There is a lot of dust, which may be the reason why the house is being built on the opposite side. There are two toilets, one with automatic toilet and one with normal toilet.
Hygiene: Hygiene still needs to be further strengthened. There is still dust in the corner of the bedside table.
Environment: Grand Hyatt Xi'an does not have an outdoor environment, which is disappointing. The swimming pool is slightly smaller than the Grand Hyatt in other cities. There is no deep water area, and the deepest is only 1.2 meters.
Service: Special praise to the breakfast waiter. There are a lot of tourists on May Day. The hotel's breakfast quality and service quality are not discounted. After staying for two nights, the waiter will help pack two takeaway coffees in the two mornings.
Generally speaking, staying at Grand Hyatt for two nights brings you a feeling of being at home, and draws a successful conclusion to the trip to Xi'an.

Facilities: very characteristic of Xi'an, including the design and decoration are low-key and classic, very nice
Environment: The environment inside the hotel is great. This building looks better at night. It’s very comfortable to stroll around at night when the weather is sunny. There may be a lot of places around that are still under construction, so it's not particularly bright. I guess the night view will be better when it's built. Except for the problem with the fresh air system and the air conditioner not cooling, it's basically great. Overall, it's a very pleasant stay experience.

msg:I originally stayed at the InterContinental for this trip, but the decoration tastes good, so I chose the parent-child room of the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The room is quite big and there is a slide. The children had fun, but when I went to the bathroom, the door was covered with an iron sheet and there was a special leak. The sharp corners left a lot of blood on the child's foot. I was worried that the child would wipe it off after seeing it. I immediately contacted the hotel staff and asked them to send some iodophor cotton swabs, but there was no one after waiting for 25 minutes. It took us two calls before a waiter delivered the food. During this period, the child’s blood could not be stopped at all. We were very angry that this is how a five-star hotel treats guests in an emergency. Later we It took a long time to ask to see the lobby manager before they came to a female manager. We asked to go to the hospital, and they took us and the child to the hospital for a bandage. Afterwards, there was no indication that they would compensate us. We consulted a lawyer. In this case, the hotel has to bear us Medical expenses, lost work expenses, and mental damage expenses. After all, children can’t go to school and adults can’t go to work. This trip is also in vain. We have been greatly affected. In several conversations, the hotel only agreed to waive One day’s room fee and dinner fee, we were here for a trip and it wouldn’t take too long, so we returned the house and left. Now it’s been a week since the incident happened. I didn't go to work, and my child's father blamed me for these things caused by changing hotels. I still blame myself. I didn't expect a five-star hotel to have such a sharp iron corner in the decoration, and it was so slow to deal with emergencies. Compensation afterwards He told us that we can only get free room and meal fees for one day, so we can file a lawsuit. This is the first time I have experienced the feeling of being bullied by the store. After all, we still have to go to work and don’t have that much experience to file a lawsuit for this matter. We can only admit that it’s bad luck. I hope that parents with children must open and close the door and be careful not to touch the children. I hope that every child can have fun and not get hurt

He was very impatient when several guests talked to him. He didn't even raise his head and ignored many people. I thought he hadn't heard, so I kept telling him again and again. I still didn't want to cook it. I wanted to add some vegetables and mushrooms, but I was so mean on the spot. I was so scared that the guests didn't dare to speak. I said the meal would be ready at ten o'clock, but in fact it was nine o'clock. At half past 30, many things were gone, and none of them were replenished. We could only eat whatever was left. A customer asked for orange juice, but the orange was clearly not squeezed in front of him, so he told the customer to drink milk. Two jobs The staff kept chatting there. When my child saw this, he had to walk away silently and took a yogurt to drink. The breakfast at the Grand Club on the 25th floor also had very few varieties, which was incomparable with other cities.

msg:This is my first time to leave a negative review for a 5-star hotel. I stayed at 2 hotels in Xi'an and I can only say that the service is worlds apart. The Grand Hyatt is really bad. I was given a room at the top of the stairs with my child. I booked a double bed room and wanted to change it to a twin bed, but I was told that it was no longer available. The next day I planned to change my itinerary and change to a hotel. I booked two nights in a row and communicated with customer service to cancel the second day’s reservation. They said I couldn’t refund. After several conversations with Ctrip customer service, they said that the price for one night was different and I had to pay extra, so I agreed to cancel. What a waste. Almost 300 yuan was deducted. Later, I clicked on various major booking platforms and found that twin rooms were also available and the single-night price was only over 900. I was confused. I have stayed in five-star hotels all over the country, but I have never seen one so speechless. It is impossible to consider Grand Hyatt again in the future.

msg:The service at the front desk was very satisfactory. He is enthusiastic about service, takes the trouble to answer questions, and works hard to meet guests' room requirements. It is really not easy to send someone to show guests the room and select the room. This level of service is really not easy in the price range of the hotel. Overall, the hotel's service level, from the front desk to housekeeping, is willing to allow guests to feel the service details. This is the best thing about this hotel. In particular, I would like to praise the three employees at the front desk. One is a boy in his 30s and 40s. He is experienced and efficient. The other girl has more years of experience and is fluent in English. There was also a little girl in her early twenties who showed us the house. She was attentive and enthusiastic about service. I'm sorry that I forgot your name after so long, but I give you a thumbs up. I hope you will be there when I come again. I'm very happy that you are part of my Xi'an impression. Last time, my wife and I came. Next time, my wife, daughter and my whole family will come together and we will stay in that room, if you still remember me. Merry Chris**as!

It is very clean and new, and the strong Chinese style makes people's eyes shine. Secondly, the service is very good. The front desk Echo who helped me check in was very considerate and helped with the upgrade, and also sent welcome fruits. From check-in to check-out, I was very concerned about the guest's check-in experience. The most satisfying thing is the bathtub. It is one of the few five-star hotels that I have stayed in. It is very comfortable to lie in. Many details of the hotel are also well controlled, and the toiletries are still from Balmain. Very tasteful, I will stay in this hotel next time I come to Xi'an.

Guest room: The dry and wet separation is done very well, the accessories are balmain, and the bathroom and bedding are very high-quality brands.
Service: The front desk service is very good, the professionalism and detail are very high, the echo attitude is very good, and the breakfast is delivered to the room~ The attitude of the room is also very good, and the water delivery is very timely.
In addition to being far from the ancient city, there is really nothing else to say! excellent

The next day I called the hotel staff, the first person said that the air conditioner was broken, the second person said that the temperature of the air conditioner was not allowed, and then adjusted it to 37 degrees, and it was still 20 degrees after an hour (the actual temperature is estimated to be 17 degrees), The child fell asleep, so I went downstairs to the lobby and asked the front desk to report it. The result of the discussion was that the hotel air conditioner room turned off our air conditioner. I repeatedly asked not to go to the room, the child fell asleep, but when I returned to the room 10 minutes later, the engineering depar**ent rang the doorbell, which was already 10:40 pm. Such a good hotel, this kind of management, a little disappointed. The phone in the room is also broken, it cannot be used without pressing the speakerphone.

Second: the price is not expensive! During the summer vacation, it was about 1100 yuan. When I saw me with two children, I upgraded the suite for free. Like it! !
Third: The facilities are complete! The swimming pool and gym are free, and the swimming pool is on a terrace which is equivalent to semi-open air. The floor of the gym is quite high. I forget the specific floors. They are all large floor-to-ceiling windows. Running on the treadmill can directly enjoy the scenery of Xi'an. . 😁

I don't know how long I have to wait! The front desk did not leave a phone call to say that the system is ready to contact the guests. After half an hour, I asked myself to know that the system was up and I could check in. The area of the room is very large, and the decoration can be seen to be thoughtful, but the details are not well done. The four corners of the bed stool are too sharp, and the corner trea**ent under the washbasin in the toilet is also a protruding point. I feel that the hotel engineering depar**ent has not considered the consequences if the guests bump into it. The room temperature has been very hot, and the air conditioner cannot be turned on to the lowest level. Indeed, as many guests said, the air conditioner is very weak. I went out to have dinner and went back to my room. I didn't turn on the turndown. I called the front desk for consultation. There is no tissue box on the desk, dining table, and bedside table in the room. I searched the whole house, as long as there is a box on the bathroom sink. I feel that the hotel only pays attention to the decoration design, and does not provide services from the perspective of the guests. The floor in the corner of the bathroom still sticks to the shoes. It should be because the drink spilled by the superior guest has not been cleaned up. The overall stay experience is not very good.

msg:The Grand Hyatt Xi'an is simply the one with the worst experience among so many mid-to-high-end hotels across the country! During the two-day stay, all I felt was prevarication and talking back, as well as extremely low work efficiency!
1. On the first day of check-in, we arrived at the hotel at 2:30 p.m., and were told that the room was still under inspection, and it was expected to take more than 10 minutes to check in. The front desk staff said that they would call me after the check-in and leave it to the front desk staff After my phone call, we waited in the rest area next to it, but after waiting for nearly 4 hours, I was told that the room could be checked in after I took the initiative to call the hotel switchboard! ! ! And the attitude of the girl who answered the phone was very rude. I asked her if you forgot to inform me that I can check in. She said, "Anyway, I told you that I can come and check in." May I ask your Grand Hyatt training staff? Like this? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I can even understand that you forget me because there are too many people, but this kind of prevarication and arrogance are really disgusting!
2. That night, due to waiting too long to check in, I had some heatstroke and physical discomfort. I ordered takeaway and hoped that the hotel staff could help deliver it, but it took me more than 40 minutes to wait from the takeaway to the hotel and then to the room. Called many times to urge, the hotel boy who came to deliver the food was also confused. It can be seen that the hotel staff did not communicate well at all.
3. The coffee beans for breakfast are mushy, and the meat of Roujiamo is completely cold. The solution given to me by the former is: I argued with me because the coffee was too strong, and the latter had no solution. The former can be understood as ignorance, while the latter simply does not take customers' food safety seriously!
Conclusion: If your store has such a service level, it will really discredit all the hard-working hotel employees in Xi'an! ! ! !

msg:It's the second time I stayed here, and I'm quite disappointed overall. I booked a seven-day trip with a child, and the Grand Hyatt in other cities is 5100 water, but I drank two yuan of water in this Grand Hyatt for the first time, and I changed it on the last day after reporting. The more you try to save money, the worse your business will be. The hotel gave Xishai a room, and I had to take the children out to hide from the sun at five or six in the afternoon. The table and floor were not cleaned when I came back on the second day of check-in. The bathroom floor drain was blocked for two consecutive days before it was repaired. The odor of the toilet floor drain was not resolved until the end. The TV had signal problems the next day. In short, we encounter different problems every day. Apart from apologizing, the hotel did not solve the problem in time. I've stayed at Grand Hyatts in many cities and was really disappointed this time. Not recommended.

Before I came, I was almost dissuaded by the orange in the room picture, but it was actually very simple and advanced. The design from the lobby to the corridor to the room is very good.
The two young ladies at the front desk were very enthusiastic to help solve various problems. Thank you very much Joanna and Niky. They are meticulous, at home, gentle, not humble or overbearing. We also upgraded our room due to the slow system. very happy.
It is worth mentioning that the elevator waits very well hahaha.
The room is very nice, the water table is frosted and the toiletries are balmain.
After eating three meals, the Asian barbecue, hot pot and barbecue on the fifth floor were quite satisfactory, but the terrace and space were well-shaped. The Cantonese cuisine upstairs is by no means inferior to the "Beijing Kitchen" (you may not know if you haven't eaten it, but it is also a Cantonese cuisine)
The breakfast is definitely the top level among the five stars in the country. In addition to the traditional Chinese medicine standard, there are also mutton steamed bun and Rou Jiamo are also top-level.
BTW, turn left for 20 meters downstairs and you will find the Internet celebrity bird's nest bookstore.
The last little detail, I think the room is too hot, and sent me the refrigerator, which belongs to Dyson.
A perfect experience. Definitely come again.

msg:I never thought that I would write such an evaluation to Hyatt, which I have always loved, or Grand Hyatt. Worst hotel experience in years.
At around 14:30 on October 13th, I drove to Grand Hyatt Xi'an by myself.
1. During the check-in period from the elevator in the parking lot to the check-in at the front desk, and then take the card to the elevator, there is no concierge to help with luggage during the period.
2. After entering the room, I found two obviously sticky cup marks on the bedside table, and a trace of an unknown white gelatinous liquid flowing down. The desk metal lamp was dusty. Explain that the countertops were not cleaned and wiped at all.
Immediately called housekeeping, attendants and floor cleaning supervisors, and front desk staff came to the room, everyone's mobile phone was ringing loudly, and the phone and text ringing kept ringing while I was communicating with me in my room , with no respect.
In this case, the front desk staff offered to change my room and took me to see it. It turned out that the room was still being cleaned, and the room size was even smaller than mine. I don't understand if this is a sincere apology? Then said that there is no other room to change, and other rooms need to wait. I was in a hurry to go back to the room for a conference call, so I proposed that I go to the spa after 4 o'clock. During this time, they can come into the room to do cleaning work.
The front desk staff added me on WeChat at 15:00, and after I confirmed the time, I asked her to make an appoin**ent for me at the hotel SPA for facial trea**ent and body oil massage at 16:30.
After the appoin**ent, the spa called the room twice to confirm that I would go to the spa. I don't understand how to be disturbed like this even though I made an appoin**ent through the hotel staff.
3. Arrived at the SPA at 16:30, the staff took me into the room. Before I sat down, the first thing the front desk staff did was to recommend me to apply for a card. I said no, I am a hotel guest who is on a business trip, and I still sell stored value again The card says it can be used nationwide. After I entered the room, it felt very cold in the room. The service staff only turned on the heating and electric blankets, so the room was not ready at all during the hour or so I made the appoin**ent, and then when I asked about the brand and process of the spa products, they couldn’t reply clearly, and even told me No matter which facial trea**ent does not have a mask step, and after waiting, the physical therapist came and said that there is a mask, and answered me that she is the front desk and is not familiar with the business, which means that she only cares about calling to sell cards. A staff member doesn't even know the most basic product and service process. Because the room was too cold, I wanted to do a facial first, and I was not given disposable slippers when I changed my bathrobe. Because the temperature was too low, my hands were always cold, and I didn’t have a body oil massage until the end, and I was sold to apply for a card again during the period. (In fact, after experiencing professional services, it is more likely to apply for a card?) When changing clothes, Because the facial trea**ent also has a head massage, I want to brush my hair. Seeing that the comb is not disposable, and even has hair on it, it looks really unhygienic... and the physiotherapist is actually wearing a navel dress, obviously she is also very embarrassed, and took me to the front desk to check out, I also kept pulling my clothes with my hands, trying to cover my waist and navel. Even if the spa is outsourced with such an unprofessional image and service, it will represent the Hyatt Group.
When I went to the front desk of the spa, I obviously booked the spa through the hotel. I didn't prepare the checkout and sign in advance, and I didn't contact the hotel in advance. Instead, I waited there for them to communicate with the front desk. I just checked into the hotel, and I haven't made any consumption yet. I was told that I can't pay the bill for the spa because the deposit is not enough. The facial trea**ent is only less than 1000 yuan, and the room bill cannot be paid. This is something that has never been encountered in any five-star hotel or hyatt. I had a guarantee of 1325 on Ctrip before, and paid a deposit of 5000 at the store, a total of 6325 yuan. (I went to brush another 3000 that day)
 I returned to the room after 18:00, and it has not been cleaned up yet, and it has been almost 2 hours. There are also three cleaning staff, one is at the door, one is in the bathroom, and the other is in my cloakroom, squatting in front of my luggage, the mobile phone is placed next to my luggage and the hands-free is turned on, making a loud call, and then I stand She called her twice before she realized it, and then quickly picked up the slippers and said that she was getting them for me. I asked them if they finished cleaning? Said that the cleaning was over, I said I was going to rest, please leave, and then the ink was turned around the room, and I left after I asked to leave again. Then I went to the front desk to pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan. I don't want the situation where I can't pay the room bill for consumption during the hotel again.
10.14 I went out to work and returned to the hotel at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon. The room key card could not be used, but I could swipe the elevator card to go to the room floor. After a long time of swipe, there was a service person in the room... I said to come to check the room, but I was at the door, checking the room Card has not come to open the door for a long time?
In the evening, I ordered food in the room, and ordered 4 bottles of sparkling water, ice cubes, and lemon slices. After the food delivery guy put the plate on the table, he didn't sign the bill for me, but sent a WeChat message with his mobile phone? ? Then after I asked him for a single sign, he suddenly picked up the plate containing the lemon slices, and tore off the plastic wrap, and at the same time checked that the fork of the lemon slices fell to the ground. I asked him why he had to tear it apart. I haven’t used it yet, because I ordered several bottles of sparkling water and planned to drink it slowly in the refrigerator for two days. He said I thought you were going to put it in the refrigerator, shouldn't there be plastic wrap in the refrigerator? (Honey juice operation) Ice cubes were not delivered together. After a while, he came to deliver lemon slices again, but the ice cubes were still not brought. After waiting for a while, another waiter without a mask came over with an ice bucket and said that he would enter the room to get me ice tongs. I told her that there were no ice tongs in the room. No, go get me again...a simple meal delivery, was entered into the room four times. Not wearing a mask during the epidemic...also very unprofessional service.
10.15 I drove out of the parking lot and found it was raining, so I went to the entrance of the lobby and asked the concierge to help me get an umbrella, and also told me the room number, but the concierge with the umbrella asked me to go in the lobby to find the concierge counter to register the room number and get Umbrella... I don't understand what this concierge does? Isn't it serving hotel customers?
While working abroad, the hotel staff sent a WeChat message to ask for my invoice, saying that they would issue the invoice for me first, and asked me for my license plate number, and wanted to help me confirm that no parking fee would be charged. I told her that I need to see the bill when I check out on the 16th to confirm the signature before I can issue an invoice. The license plate has also been entered during check-in, and there is no problem driving in and out in the past two days. I don't quite understand what this redundant contact and disturbing guests are doing.
Back at the hotel in the afternoon, the room card can still be used to swipe the elevator to the floor. But the room can't be cleaned again. I don't know what is the reason? Contact the front desk to wait for the card to be delivered. After coming up, I have to test whether my card is really unable to swipe the card. After confirming that the card cannot be swiped, I will swipe the card to enter the door...
I checked out on October 16. I had already sent a message to the front desk staff saying that I was ready to check out. Then the service staff said that the concierge was coming up to get the luggage. After waiting for a few minutes, no one came, so I went down with the luggage by myself. At the front desk During the check-out process, the front desk did not call the concierge to pick up the luggage, nor did the concierge take the initiative to come. After I asked, he came to help me take the luggage to the underground garage and put it in the car. (with tip)
During the period, a manager said that he would help me arrange lunch or dinner as an apology. However, at the end of the checkout, all the consumption during the store was on the bill, and I paid in full without any deductions. And the 98 yuan swimming cap I bought at the swimming pool was also thrown away by the cleaning staff...
1325 yuan per night, the distinguished deluxe double bed room with a room rate of 75-79.5 square meters provides guests with such a service attitude and hygienic conditions.
With such service quality, hygiene quality, and customer relationship handling capabilities, Hyatt really disappoints old customers.
And the room doesn't even have a capsule coffee machine, only instant coffee.
(Tips are given for breakfast delivery and luggage concierge.)

The front desk was very reluctant, but I went upstairs and she gave it to me. The room key can’t open the door, the one I want can open, and I fell asleep when I arrived very late. I got up in the morning and went to the bathroom. A lot of soot was not cleaned. I was shocked. I thought I was in, so I went to have breakfast on the 22nd floor. I wore my own clothes and the hotel slippers didn’t let me in, saying that I needed to change my shoes. So when I checked in, didn’t I remind the customer, so I went back to change my shoes and got the bad room card. When the service staff opened the door for me, I didn’t eat breakfast, and then went to work. I called me again in the afternoon and asked if I could renew my stay. I said that the order was only two days, don’t you guys look at it, come back and open the door and let me I'm speechless to play with the room card

This time I want to say that the appearance and lobby are very a**ospheric. Check in at the front desk and give Leo and his colleague Kay a thumbs up. See you I took the child and arranged a parent-child theme room for us. There are small tents and drawing boards in the room. The children’s nightgown and bathing supplies are all available. The details are well done. My baby looks at the tent and does not want to come out so cute. Let’s talk about room service. The cleaning aunt in the corridor would take the initiative to say hello to us, one toothbrush was missing, and the phone was delivered to this point in seconds. The breakfast time is also very long until 10:30. I can sleep until I wake up naturally and then go to the restaurant for a meal. The breakfast in the hotel is really good. The main points of 120 praises The breakfast category of five-star hotels is very rich, but it is difficult to make every meal tastes good. His breakfast is basically cooked by the chef, fresh and delicious, service is not necessary I said that the tray is fast and polite, especially thanks to the waiter who seems to be called Sisi. I don’t remember it clearly. I took a blanket for the child and covered it. It’s super sweet. It’s in Gaoxin, but there is a subway station at the door. It’s very convenient and I think it’s also very suitable. Parents and children will recommend to colleagues and friends around me👍

I checked in on my birthday and sent a cake. Special thanks to the front office manager Leo, for giving you a thumbs up 👍

msg:The last time I stayed at Grand Hyatt Changsha, I left a very good impression. I did not hesitate to choose Grand Hyatt Xi’an for this trip. Although it is not too close to the city, I have no worries because I rented a car. NS.
[About parking] The hotel has an underground parking lot, but the few parking spaces closest to the elevator are occupied by a few zombie cars. If you come back late, you can only park in farther parking spaces. Parking is free. Just report the license plate number at the front desk. After I reported the license plate number for the first time, I asked the hotel whether the license plate number was required for every trip. The front desk staff said no, just report it once. As a result, I couldn't get out the second time... I called the front desk in the car and blocked several cars, which was too embarrassing.
[About the room] It's good, but you need to pay attention to the details. The door of the 2101 room we stayed in could not be closed and always leaked; the cabinet door under the bathtub in room 2102 that our parents stayed in would also open by itself, and the bathtub could be seen. The following structure is up. There is another point, and the biggest complaint about this stay: the room is too! hot! NS! ! The air conditioner has been adjusted to the maximum wind of 10 degrees, and it is still hot enough to sweat after taking a shower. There is really no way to ask for a fan. The Crown Air Conditioner I live in Shenzhen is better than this. Even the waiter who sent the fan said it was really hot. Quickly improve it!
[About breakfast] The variety is quite rich and the taste is good. There are also local specialties such as simmered noodles (delicious), steamed buns, and steamed buns (not tasty), as well as rich freshly squeezed juices, and the taste is all good. The only thing I want to complain about is that during the epidemic, the hotel reception did not require guests to wear masks, which is a bit uncomfortable.
[About the bar] There was a band performance. I took my parents to have a drink late at night. Because there was an event in the bar that day, I sat down for 10 minutes and no one was on the wine list. Ask the waiter to introduce the wine that suits my father. Recommend old fashion, without any explanation, please, not everyone is professional, and his attitude is so cold that I thought he was a guest (a short man with glasses) after ordering wine without any snacks, the four of us watched this scene Quickly slipped away. The experience is very poor.
[Surroundings and others] There is a Takuya Bookstore downstairs in the hotel, which is very beautiful. You can try Ziwu Road Zhangji Roujia Mo for takeout. It is very delicious.

I hope that the above suggestions will improve the hotel as soon as possible~ I look forward to meeting a better Grand Hyatt.

The lobby of the hotel is very grand, with large room space, good facilities, automatic toilet,

The toilet has a lot of space.

Next to the hotel is the Takuya Bookstore with a renovation of 100 million, which is worth recommending. There are cafes inside, many Japanese boutiques, and a large bookstore.

msg:The Grand Hyatt Hotel is located in the high-tech zone and consists of two towers, one is a hotel and the other is an office. There is a cool corridor in the middle, which is the restaurant. The decoration of the entire hotel is inspired by the Silk Road and is full of streamlined shapes. In addition to light wood and white, it gives a very clean feeling.
The big bed room I ordered is large enough, with a cloakroom, separate shower and toilet room, and a large white bathtub with frosted texture, which is very nice. There is a corner sofa and a round table in the room, which is convenient for dining in the room.
The hotel is thoughtfully equipped with a teapot, and the kettle is also very Japanese.
There are not many types of breakfast, but the taste is not bad. The popular freshly squeezed watermelon juice and dense melon juice are not restocked when they are used up, which is not a**ospheric; in addition, because the hotel is business-oriented, you can’t enter with slippers, so be careful.
Next door to the hotel is the online celebrity Tsutaya Bookstore, so you must check in when you have time.
a fly in the oin**ent:
1. The rain in the room is too free and easy, and the spillage is too strong to be useful.
2. The 50-square-meter standard double room is not equipped with a kingsize bed, so it is too crowded for a nap.

msg:I heard that the LTW Designworks team led by Mr. Lin Fengnian was responsible for the design. In fact, I have been looking forward to it since it has not opened yet. The design themes of the Silk Road and the mirage run through the entire space, and the elements full of tradition and history are interpreted in a modern way. The progressive pattern not only moves smoothly, but does not disturb each other. The room decorated with logs and auburn is warm and relaxing.

I especially like some simple but interesting small details, such as the background wall inspired by the mirage, and the wall edges and corners with the fan structure as the concept. These are enough to see the designer's intentions in the subtle places. I really like it!

Special thanks to hotel staff Jennifer Sun Jingxin for making our Grand Hyatt feel at home!

設計感滿滿，細節都很好。
高樓層視野很好，25層的嘉賓軒簡餐完全能滿足孩子晚餐需求，主食、主菜、水果，還有家長必備的酒水都供應很足的。
游泳池一邊大人一邊小童，水温28/36 滿足游泳和戲水兩種需求。
特別感謝Molly小姐姐，温柔專業，而且所有問題反映都很及時。
還會帶很多孩子的好朋友一起來住

Service: There is nothing to say about the service. It is worth noting that the five-star service attitude is very good. It's a comfortable stay. It's the second time I've stayed in this hotel. I'll stay in this hotel again next time. The only downside. As a five-star hotel, the breakfast variety is less

msg:1. 我訂的是豪華雙床房，房間很大，近80平，有客廳沙發，倆衞生間，浴盆和浴室都有。這點比較滿意。
2. 地理位置比較偏，離哪個景點都不近，如果你是來旅遊的，完全完全不推薦。如果作為去機場前一晚的住宿可以考慮。
3. 酒店的自助早餐198一位，如果在前台買的話是117一位。 早餐的飯菜味道與華住會美居系列或者亞朵的，差的太多了。 那個麪條做的難吃一點味道也沒有。整場吃下來 衹有肉夾饃是不錯的，但是排隊等饃的人也超級多。117 買個饃 還要排半天隊。 
4. 我們住的豪華雙床房 拉開窗簾對着施工工地，若説是住君悦還有個高空夜景，我這個位置也是破爛不堪。

總而言之，我這五天四晚的西安之行，君悦這晚應該是非常不滿意的。 我前幾天也是沒晚1300-1500 的房間 在華住會， 真是從服務態度到飲食 都是非常滿意的。西安君悦- 華而不實 徒有虛名。下次不會選了。

msg:暖雨晴風初破凍，柳眼梅腮，已覺春心動。酒意詩情誰與共？淚融殘粉花鈿重。乍試夾衫金縷縫，山枕斜欹，枕損釵頭鳳。獨抱濃愁無好夢，夜闌猶剪燈花弄。
       又到了一年之中為數不多暖春時節，暖陽加上萬物復甦，讓我這種本就在家待不住的人更加躁動了，那就趁着這股燥勁兒，找個地方脱離一下工作，逃避一下現實。疫情原因出外地實在是有很大風險，加上我好市民的心態在作祟，不願意給城市和國家添麻煩，在西安這個地方，衹能選擇去上次令我意猶未盡的“君悦”了。
      如上次一樣，我提前聯繫了有應必達又親切可愛的“楊瑞”（Anna）小姐姐，她的聲音有一種特別的吸引力，使我掛完電話下意識的放下手中所有事情，腦子裡衹想着趕緊去“君悦”的事情。
      這次接待我的是一張陌生的面孔，“楊艷萍”（Joanna）小姐姐，她的親切讓本沉浸在未見到因其它工作忙碌未在前台的“楊瑞”失落中的我，由悲轉喜，原來Anna小姐姐給我把一切都安排好了，Joanna為順利的辦理了入住，拿到房卡的我並沒有第一時間上樓，反而是利用提問題的方式刻意在前台停留為了能見一眼Anna小姐姐，所以我到底是因為君悦而來君悦，還是因為這幾位小姐姐來君悦，此時此刻我自己也搞不清楚了……
      這次的房間很驚艷，不帶任何廣告色彩平心而論，採光，視角，房間佈局，裝修細節等等，全部吊打名聲在外的亞洲第一大某W酒店，唯一能與之媲美的衹剩下某ritz酒店了，但論性價比，ritz又輸給了君悦。一晚的深度睡眠後，我產生了不想回家的想法。
      續住，第二天的為我辦理續住的是熟悉的“馮靜”（Ella）小姐姐，還未走到前台，她的眼神好似已經在跟我打招呼，“又來了”？ 。Anna ，Joanna ，Ella三位小姐姐為我入住君悦的體驗感畫上了點精的一筆，本以為酒店衹有房間，設施吸引我，捫心自問，更多的是這三位小姐姐。
      君悦至臻的服務品質以及過硬的設施又一次讓我忘記了時間的流逝，轉瞬即逝學習已經連續在君悦住了4天，回首殘酷又忙碌的現實工作，我不得不強迫自己抽離，從這份安逸舒適中回到現實中去。
      也許有一天 或許就是現在 君悦會成為我逃避現實享受安逸的一條船，Anna是船長，為我的每次航行保駕護航。Ella和Joanna就是大副和水手，為我解決航行中的一切問題。
       而我，在不久的將來也一定會成為HYATT“環球客”！

msg:放張泳池的圖，完全沒人，遊起來很舒服，游完泡個温泉很愜意，前台小姐姐非常nice，升級了套房，但是套房樓層比較低，視野不是很好。房間非常大，浴室浴缸衣帽間會客區域全都有，但是燈光比較昏暗，不適合辦公，建議對照明系統進行調整，至少亮度能跟得上；電視不是網絡電視，比較難受；可能是房間大的原因，空調製熱效果一般，房間有點冷。
綉橋中餐廳人均300左右能吃的不錯，觀景位很少，設計師用巨大的鋼筋遮蔽了視野絕佳的條形玻璃巨幕，觀景和承重自相矛盾，迷之設計。由於是過年期間來的，所以很多菜並沒有，推薦麻婆豆腐波龍。菜味道中規中矩，點心量少，可以多點幾個嚐嚐。
之後還會再住，希望君悦能越來越好，為糟糕的西安服務業正名。PS：車位非常寬敞，停車十分舒服

今天接待我的是一位親和力非常強的漂亮小姐姐，她叫楊瑞（Anna），非常迅速且貼心的為我辦理了入住，詳細地向我介紹了酒店的基礎設施以及特色服務，她服務的態度讓整個酒店的level又上升了一個台階，給人一種回家的感覺。
酒店的設施，房間，還有安靜舒適的睡眠環境，全部都非常令人滿意，君悦應該與高新ritz最大的競爭對手吧！和而不同，就像汽車裡的奔馳和寶馬一樣，各領風騷。
這次入住如果滿分100，我願意給出120分的評價，因為酒店工作人員“楊瑞”（Anna）的服務令我非常舒適，這多出的20分就是因她而加。
期待下一次來君悦的體驗。非常非常滿意

msg:🚗 交通：酒店在高新的cbd，位置很好找，打車、停車都很方便。離旁邊商場步行五分鐘距離，附近餐廳和咖啡廳也很多。

🧹衞生：無可挑剔，酒店環保意識很強。無衞生死角，細節上也做的很到位。個護用品是Balmain，很舒服的氣味。

🍃環境：酒店整體裝修大氣獨特，這棟建築裏裡外外都能算的上是藝術品。房間設計和佈局不僅人性化且別出心裁，讓人印象深刻。高樓層可以在酒店得天獨厚的地理位置眺望林立的高樓，感受這個城市的魅力。酒店酒吧還有樂隊駐唱，酒也調的很不錯。

🔔服務：入住當天比較晚了，前台小姐姐幫忙升級了房型，住的更舒服了一些。另外服務人員都非常熱情且有禮貌，有時忘記按下請勿打擾燈服務員都會按門鈴一再確認房間是否有人，不會貿然開門。另外每次下午取消勿擾之後前台都會來電確認房間的清掃時間。
