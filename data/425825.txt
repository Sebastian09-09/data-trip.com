However, the experience in Chinese restaurant 香宫 is awful, food is not good and the tea is so expensive, they charged us RMB250 for a pot of Chinese tea, the red wine is RMB240,  omg, very bad. We would not go there again, I mean 香宫.

The food at the restaurant is wonderful and has a great variety of Western and Chinese cuisine. The facilities were fantastic as well, especially the gym and the change rooms, which contained a sauna, steam room and hot bath. The spa was a bit overpriced, to be honest, considering what you pay just a night's stay. But other than that, there really wasn't much to be upset about and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is keen on piece and quiet but also ready for a good night out.

msg:The overall service is acceptable, and the housekeeper's service is in place. For business travelers, such a five-star hotel will never stay again. I advise everyone not to step on the pit. I stayed in the best Internet celebrity view superior king-size bed room. The old facilities were wonderful. 1. The lumbar part of the mattress collapsed. I slept for one night and my waist hurt for a day. I endured it on the second night. I booked four nights, but I checked out and changed places after two days. 2. All the wall plugs are loose, and the three plugs fall off. 3. The Sony TV is as small as 37 inches. Can it be smaller? The bed backrest is 4 meters away from the TV, and there are not many channels. Many of them are spent or deflated, and I can't watch them. 4. Fortunately, the hotel prepared a purifier when booking the room. It's also stuffy. It's unimaginable if there is no purifier! 5. The bathroom has no exhaust, and the drainage is not smooth. Many hotels in Atour Vienna Seasons are equipped with smart guest control systems and smart toilets for 500 to 700. Shangri-La is a five-star hotel, but it costs more than 1,000 a night! What is our experience? The only highlight is the breakfast!

It is both prosperous and artistic. The hotel's decoration style is warm and elegant, which suits my taste. The most rare thing is that the overall quality of the staff is quite good, and they always show the service spirit of guests first. Whether it is the lobby staff or the room service staff, they all greet you with a smile, making people feel at home. Special praise should be given to Sandy D, who is attentive and considerate in all kinds of care, and warm and friendly service attitude, which is very heartwarming.

msg:When traveling by car, you have to experience Shangri-La in every city of a certain size. Maybe it is because it is a brand that entered China earlier and has a relatively advantageous location. It is always located in the C position of the city, with excellent landscape, environment, and facilities, high starting point of decoration, and full a**osphere. It is a mixture of lively Southeast Asia and Chinese style, and it never disappoints me (except Shangri-La in Changchun). When I came to Chengdu, I chose Shangri-La by the way. It was an unexpected surprise. It is definitely the C position of the city, overlooking the Jinjiang River, opposite the Jiuyan Bridge, and the lively nightlife. The rooms are spacious and exquisite, with unbeatable river views, and a rich variety of breakfasts, including Chinese, Western, Japanese, and local specialties. In particular, the level of Western pastry making is excellent, which made me, who likes salty food, couldn't help but eat a lot of Western pastries. In the outdoor garden in the cool morning breeze, I enjoyed their buffet breakfast to start a full day. The service of the hotel staff was also very good. Customer service Xiaolin personally arranged the room, breakfast, and parking perfectly. I would also like to thank the gentleman who checked me in at the front desk yesterday.

🌈 Special thanks to "Xiao Li" in Shangri-La and "Master Qu" in the bakery, who must be given five-star praise🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟. The service is very thoughtful and responsive, and it can be solved quickly from the beginning of check-in to the process service. The breakfast is really full of highlights, especially the Western style. The croissants and puff pastries are very nice and very fresh. They must be freshly baked. When leaving, the hotel also gave croissants, which is very heartwarming.
Next time I come to Chengdu, I should bring my family to stay at Shangri-La.
Thanks again to both of you, I hope the hotel can praise them!!!

The room is super clean and well maintained. The hygiene details are super perfect. Because Guangdong kids often have sinusitis, they are very concerned about hygiene and dust mites. It happened that this trip had an attack. I mentioned my concerns to the housekeeper Lucy Xiaoting. She said don't worry, the room will be ready, so I stayed comfortably with such a large flow of people on May Day. I originally booked for one day, but stayed for 3 days intermittently after checking in. It is very considerate for children. There are children's slippers and bathtub bags. Children who are not used to showering can take a comfortable bath. There is an air purifier for children with rhinitis. It is a must-drink tea. After crossing the Jiuyan Bridge, walk for 5 minutes to eat delicious freshly rolled sweet noodles. This location is convenient to go anywhere during the May Day holiday. It is much more convenient than friends who live in Taikoo Li.

msg:1. The location is very good

It is right next to the Jiuyan Bridge, the old nightlife center of Chengdu

Hejiang Pavilion is downstairs

On the other side of the hotel is the old site of Sichuan Shuijingfang, which is ancient and charming

Next to the hotel is Lan Kwai Fong

2. The hotel itself

The hotel has been renovated for a while, but the facilities are still in their prime

I didn’t find anything particularly old

It was quite quiet at night (perhaps because it was on the city side)

The soundproofing was good

The pillows and beds were also good

The hardware was generally good

3. Service

Generally good

But there were two minor problems

(1) During the breakfast peak, it seemed that there was a shortage of staff. There were no bowls near the tofu pudding for a long time and no one paid attention to it

(2) Since the hotel reception is on the second floor, there are three entrances: the office building, the lobby, and the first floor of the hotel. This is my first time here. I didn’t go to the right entrance twice. It is recommended to add eye-catching reminders.

Here, we especially thank a beautiful woman named Tiffany Xiaoli. She specially made a Chengdu travel guide and asked us to contact her at any time if we have any questions. She is not only sweet, generous and decent, but also sincere and has a good service attitude. She left a good impression on us. 🌹🌹🌹

msg:I rarely write reviews, but this time I must praise it. I have always preferred Shangri-La. The service industry wins in details. I stayed for 3 nights in a row. When I took a shower on the second night, I found that the drain was a little blocked and not very smooth, so I pushed the floor drain cover forward a little to expose a small gap. When I came back on the third night, the cleaning staff had already covered it. When I took a shower, If the water drains smoothly, it means that the cleaning staff on the 17th floor noticed that the floor drain cover was opened a little and took the initiative to detect the problem and solve it immediately. If a grassroots staff can be so meticulous, it reflects the high service level of the entire hotel.

msg:Excellent location: 20 minutes walk to Taikoo Li and Sichuan University, overlooking Anshun Bridge and Jinjiang River, opposite is a street of food stalls and bars, and you can enjoy the night view of Jinjiang River at night.
Service praise: Breakfast basically has one-to-one seating arrangement, which is very good to avoid the chaos and conflicts caused by guests occupying seats by themselves. This is very good, especially considering the passenger flow on May 1st, it can still be kept in order, indicating that the management is in place.
Finally, special thanks to the room manager on night duty on May 2: Due to the location, the designated room faces relatively loud music noise at night to affect rest. The manager immediately changed the room on the upper floor. No evasion or shirking, good communication throughout the process, and quick resolution.
Next time I come to Chengdu, I will choose this hotel again.

The large floor-to-ceiling glass gives me a panoramic view of the night view of the Nine-Arch Bridge. The street downstairs is full of bars and nightclubs, which is very lively, but living on the 16th floor is not noisy at all. The hotel service is excellent. All the service staff are very enthusiastic, smiling, polite and courteous. Ella from the concierge is particularly considerate. Every year, my child's birthday during the May Day holiday is spent in a travel hotel, and this time is no exception. Ella helped me arrange cakes, gifts, fruits, birthday cards, and desserts in advance. She is very thoughtful. I am very grateful and touched. Shangri-La is really great.

msg:I took my family and children to Chengdu for a May Day tour, and I was very satisfied with the Shangri-La Hotel. Let's talk about the facilities first. When I entered the hotel, I was amazed by the hydrangeas at the gate. The room decoration is a bit old, but it is well maintained. The hotel also has a Sichuan Zongzi wrapping activity in the afternoon, which is free to participate. The hotel is just at Jiuyan Bridge, a little way from the subway station. The bar street of Jiuyan Bridge is just opposite, very close. The hotel is within 2km from Taikoo Li, Chunxi Road, Sichuan University, and you can just walk around. The environment of the hotel itself and the surrounding environment are very good, literary and fashionable.
Let's talk about the service. The front desk saw the two orders I placed and took the initiative to help me check in together. There was a deposit in the middle. I thought it was the room fee. They also helped me check with the platform to avoid misunderstandings. There were also Xiao Zhao Rancho, Zhang Xia, and Ella, who helped with the service throughout the whole process. The child wanted to go to the 132 factory, and helped me ask relatives how to play. The flight to leave the hotel was early in the morning, and asked me the night before if I wanted to issue an invoice and book a car in advance. It was really considerate.
Finally, let's talk about the food. I was surprised by the rich breakfast at Chengdu Shangri-La. The taste was also very good. It was not like some buffets that were just large but not tasty. I came out full every day, which resulted in two meals a day during the few days I visited Chengdu.
I will stay here again next time I come to Chengdu!

Standing by the window, you have a great view, overlooking the entire Jiuyan Bridge and the night view of the covered bridge in the evening.

msg:The hotel has an excellent location, close to Taikoo Li on Chunxi Road and not far from Jinli, Wuhou Temple. Stretching out from the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel, you can overlook the Jinjiang River. The pavilions and pavilions along the river are unique, and the Anshun Lan Bridge across the Jinjiang River adds to the unique scenery. It is the Spring Festival. At night, the lights along both sides of the Jinjiang River are bright, and the Jinjiang River meanders forward like a dragon. Occasionally, cruise ships pass by on the river, cutting through the black sky in the center of the lake, reflecting the bright lights on the lake. Occasionally, the night breeze blows, and the lights on the lake ripple and sparkle. When you get off the taxi, you will be greeted by the God of Wealth at the door of the hotel lobby, which is very impressive. Entering the lobby, you will see panda sculptures of different shapes. It is the Spring Festival, and the lobby has been decorated with New Year a**osphere. Spring Festival blessings can be seen everywhere, as well as the money tree symbolizing the joyful a**osphere of the New Year. Book a Horizon Club river view king bed room. It was the peak Spring Festival season and the room had not been cleaned when I checked in. The hotel front desk arranged to have a rest in the executive lounge as an apology. The 36th floor executive lounge on the top floor is like a castle in the air, with an excellent view. It has a panoramic view of Chengdu, and even Jinjiang is a little cramped. It's the 5:30 lounge viewing time, and the buffet and drinks are provided for you to enjoy. Not long after, someone was arranged to deliver the room card. The rooms are relatively spacious and the facilities are a bit dated, but it does not affect the overall sense. The most distinctive feature in my impression is that the angle of the TV display in the guest room can be freely switched. The breakfast is rich, with local characteristics, northern and southern flavors, and a combination of Chinese and Western styles.

msg:Thank you Shangri-La for bringing me a happy New Year. My first stay at a Shangri-La brand hotel was a very good experience. From the moment I got off the bus at the hotel door, from the attentive reception of the doorman to the housekeeping depar**ent, the materials needed by the guests were always there. More considerate guests want to go the extra mile and deeply feel the hotel's attentive service. The hotel environment and services are very good. Doris, the WeChat butler, was thoughtful and provided us with high-quality services. After checking out, he still paid attention to our stay experience. , the afternoon tea in the hotel lobby bar is quite good, I will stay again if I have the chance!

msg:It felt good to stay at Shangri-La Restaurant this time, but the room service needs to be further improved. We stayed for 2 nights. When we came back the next night, we found that the bath soap was not put away, the paper towels were not added after running out, and the coffee and tea bags were not put away. The student said that he went directly into the room to check what was going on. Is this the service that a five-star hotel should have? I was really dumbfounded. I felt deeply insulted. I reported it to the service desk afterwards. They were very polite but kept saying "I'm sorry" and so on. There was no other plan. In the end, I didn't receive any response from the relevant hotel personnel. Maybe They have become accustomed to it. Very bad experience! Wouldn’t recommend it to friends and family!

The hotel swimming pool is clean and hygienic, with free steam room and sauna room, and hot pool for bathing. The location of the hotel is very convenient, next to Lan Kwai Fong in Chengdu, and very, very close to Jiuyan Bridge and Jinjiang Night Tour! The only drawback was that we ate at the hotel's Chinese restaurant. They said that if you get a 20% discount for guests, you can't earn points on the Shangri-La membership card. This policy is very unfriendly. Members of other hotels do not have this rule! Marriott, Hilton, etc. can all earn points! Suggest hotel improvements!

Since the hotel has been open for a while, there were some minor problems during the check-in process, but Yvonne, the hotel's account manager, handled them in a timely manner. Problems can arise with virtually any service, but attitude is what guests really value. Chengdu Shangri-La has no problem in this regard. This is why I have always liked Shangri-La.
A very pleasant Spring Festival holiday and a very pleasant trip to Chengdu. I will choose Shangri-La next time in Chengdu!

The scenery of Chengdu Shangri-La is very good, and Jinjiang River can be seen from the window. The scenery is also beautiful at night. We chose the parent-child room. Panda theme, children like it very much. The winter in Chengdu is really warm, and it’s also very hot indoors. In the afternoon, I basically turned the air conditioner to the lowest setting. Shangri-La is very comfortable to live in. The restaurant chef also specifically asked us for our opinions on the dishes. The lifeguards wearing glasses at the swimming pool are very nice and very responsible. Fruit was delivered to the room twice. Very thoughtful. A wise woman in the lobby is kind-hearted and gives a baby panda as a gift. Chengdu is a beautiful city with delicious food, beautiful scenery and beautiful women. Shangri-La is even more refreshing.

msg:An old five-star hotel, I went there with great hope and curiosity. As a result, for the same price, compared with the Wenshu Monastery Courtyard Hotel where we stayed on the first night, it was inferior! The child didn't know what brand of five-star hotel it was. As soon as he entered the room, he said he didn't like it. There were too many mirrors in the room. The most important thing was that there was a big mirror facing the bed, which made him feel uncomfortable. There are many varieties of breakfast, mainly Western style. There are not too many guests, but the service cannot keep up. There is only one chopstick. In short, the experience is average, and there is an attitude that the store is bullying customers and doesn't care about the customers' feelings. It doesn't matter whether you come or not, the reputation will still be there!

Regarding the hotel room, I have a small suggestion. The TV shown in the picture cannot be retracted into the wall. It is too close to the bed and is easily bumped in that position. I hope the hotel can adjust it.

The next day I decisively changed it to Chengdu Shangri-La, and the service was completely different. The porter will help with luggage (the one at Chengdu Kempinski is like a puppet and can only watch), and the front desk will give you a welcome gift of a panda when you check in, and the housekeeper Yvonne will always respond to guests' feedback as soon as possible (such as morning wake-up service, etc.) The location of the hotel is also excellent.

After confirming the room, they arranged our rooms together, upgraded our room to a river view room, and promptly asked us if we needed anything the next day.
The invoice is issued first so that we can get the invoice at the same time when we check out. The whole service is professional and smooth.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. Lan Kwai Fong is just downstairs, and Jiuyan Bridge is opposite in two or three minutes. You can also walk to Taikoo Li. And although the room facilities are not that new, they are clean and tidy, and there is no smell at all. What I like most is the bed. The quality of sleep is still the most important when going out for fun. Only when you sleep well can you have the energy to play. The service is impeccable. I even heard people on the roadside say that Shangri-La is the Huangpu Military Academy of high-end hotels in Chengdu. The service standards of many high-end hotels are set by them. After I booked the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Rancho contacted me immediately to discuss my favorite room type and any requirements. If you have any needs or questions every day, you can ask the housekeeper and make you feel at home. Recommend it

msg:When our car arrived at the door of the hotel, an older doorman stood there and glanced impatiently, saying nothing! They didn't signal to stop, didn't come to open the door, and didn't come to help carry the luggage. We were carrying a two-year-old baby, and the suitcase was heavy and big, and we were really speechless with the big and small bags!
  A five-star hotel is so bad. There is a stale smell as soon as you enter the door. The furniture in the lobby, front desk, and furniture are old and dirty. When I checked in at the front desk, there were three service staff, and there was one person in line in front of each of them. There was also one person in line in front of me☝️! However, it took half an hour to complete the process. The business ability was really too slow and poor. I couldn't wait any longer, and the children started to make trouble, so I contacted the housekeeper, and the housekeeper Lucky came to help us get a room. Although Lucky also asked me about it later, there were many things that she could not handle as a housekeeper!
When I had breakfast in the morning, I felt uncomfortable and asked my nanny to bring me some milk and eggs. The staff refused to let me bring them. They said it was a rule. They didn’t even let me bring milk or eggs. It was so speechless! The small table in the bathroom was also crooked, and my phone fell to the ground several times. I was so angry!
 In short, after staying for four days, the room price of 1,566 is really not worth it, and the experience is very poor!

The location of Chengdu Shangri-La is also great. Which commercial street you go to, the attractions are relatively close. In addition, the service is also good: the reception staff in the lobby are very polite. Special thanks to Anna, Guest Relations Director, who took very considerate care of us and thought of every detail. It was a very pleasant stay here for a few days. In short, I will choose Shangri-La again when I come to Chengdu in the future! Thank you Anna!

We were supposed to check out at 12 o'clock, but it was past 2 o'clock after we finished eating and shopping. The plane was late. The children were very sleepy and needed to sleep again.

At the same time, compared with the temperature in the lobby, I feel that the temperature in the lobby is cooler. Ask the master to repair it, it is a little bit better and not so hot, but the air conditioner is still not cool. This problem affects the experience a bit

The sound insulation is not very good, you can hear the sound of the next door (it may be the sound of the TV or the sound of people); the sound of the child running past outside the door can be heard clearly.


Hygiene: Super clean, this one looks so comfortable. It is so much cleaner than those ostentatious internet celebrity homestays!

Environment: The night view of the river is beautiful. During the day, I can also see the scenery near the Chengdu Covered Bridge

Service: Full marks. Also made a memorial day love heart. The breakfast is also super cute, because there are quite a lot of gourmet options

I was not disappointed. Faye, the lady at the front desk, specially arranged it for us. The room on the 11th floor can see the Jiuyan Bridge. The night view is very beautiful. Sitting by the window at night, drinking a cup of fragrant tea and watching the cruise ships on the river and the night view on both sides of the river, it immediately eliminates the fatigue of a day of sightseeing. The young lady at the front desk also prepared small slippers, cartoon dental kits, and welcome fruits for the children. They are very thoughtful, and the breakfast is also very rich. The children said that they would like to stay in this hotel next time they come to Chengdu. It was a very enjoyable trip for our family.

msg:After three years, I came to Chengdu again. The last time was at the beginning of 2020, and I lived in Shangri-La at that time. Because of the epidemic, I went back in a hurry, this time I thought about coming again on the weekend. The hotel is really old and looks a little old, which is impossible. But why is it not so delicious 😲
Before check-in, Doris made a connection in advance and took note of our requirements. The express delivery of disposable items I ordered in advance was also stored at the concierge. Since we arrived at 11 o'clock in the evening, we checked in in a hurry. The concierge helped to deliver the luggage and courier to the room. We went upstairs after taking the food. We ordered a double bed, but we were given a double bed. It was too late , there is no room change in the early morning. The next day, I sent a message to Doris to explain the situation, saying that I would give us extra aromatherapy and souvenirs. After breakfast, I went to the front desk to change rooms. When changing rooms, the front desk said that the housekeeping depar**ent registered incorrectly, but it was a hotel coordination problem anyway. , Consumers shouldn’t be tolerant. This is the first time I’ve been given the wrong room type. This time we’re two girls. If the opposite sex encounters this situation, it’s so embarrassing in the early morning.
The only thing that is not good is that the hotel does not have a robot food delivery service. I asked the front desk and said that it is a food safety issue, and other things can be delivered to the room. It is true that many hotels say this, but I think that if the delivery staff are safer than the concierge, then the current situation of hotel security is thought-provoking.
The overall feeling is still at the old five-star level. If you are too lazy to choose a hotel, Shangri-La is a good choice.

I ordered a bowl of beef noodles and it was delivered in less than ten minutes, but the taste was very, very inappropriate. There was a lot of garlic and the beef was very good. I asked them to take it away as soon as possible. For 40 minutes, no one came to take care of it. This is a very strange thing for a five-star hotel. How can there be such a service? They charge this amount for a bowl of noodles that is not eaten. I think this is a disgrace to a five-star hotel.

Swimming and fitness are on the fourth floor. The water quality of the swimming pool is clear and the environment is good. Two days before check-in, a special person (Doris) contacted me and learned that I was traveling with the elderly and children, so I took the initiative to communicate and arrange a non-smoking room near the elevator, so that the elderly do not have to go too far, and the service is very attentive, which I have never enjoyed in other hotels . The hotel lobby is on the second floor, and there are express cabinets on the first floor. It is also very convenient to take out food. There is also a bouncy castle on the first floor, where children can jump around.

2. There is no order in the lobby bar, food ordering is slow, and napkins, paper towels, sugar, and salt packets are not provided on the table.
3. The service in the hotel is perfunctory. There are only 2 pairs of slippers provided. My size 39 feet also have to show a heel at the back. During this period, I paid attention to other passengers and found the same situation.
4. The network in the room is extremely poor, often disconnected, and the operator's signal is not good. WIFI is often disconnected for no apparent reason, affecting the use of mobile phones.
5. The facilities are aging and lack maintenance. The desk lamp often goes out automatically and flashes during use.

7. The big slippers on the right in the attached picture are from Marriott. There is no harm if there is no comparison.

msg:The room we booked was for a house near the river. It’s pretty nice when the Jinjiang lights are on at night. It’s right next to the bar street, so it’s nice to take a walk at night. Some of the furniture in the hotel room, such as the minibar, were still dusty and had not been cleaned, which is really inappropriate for such standards. The front desk staff was not very polite when checking in. The manager on duty at the time was not very enthusiastic either. I asked a few questions and received cold answers. I did not feel the friendliness or service attitude that I should have. Overall, the overall environment was good. The biggest dissatisfaction was the poor attitude of the manager on duty.

Compared with the so-called luxury design peers, although Chengxiang has been in business for a few years, it is well maintained, the ventilation is quite good, and the accommodation experience is just right! Located in the downtown area surrounded by the Jinjiang River, Jiuyanqiao Shuijingfang Distillery is within walking distance, with profound historical and cultural heritage, three words: just right! . Here I need to thank Jasmine, who took the initiative to ask about her concerns before and after the trip. When she learned that she was traveling with her daughter, she thoughtfully upgraded the river view room, which made the itinerary icing on the cake🌹 and it was just right! In the end, the snow mountain city that I was thinking about was also perfectly filmed on the 35th floor of Chengxiang, it was just right! Leave the unfinished business for next time.

I didn't pay the room fee, or you are nervous about meeting rooms and are so anxious to earn double money. First of all, The next time I took a lunch break, I knocked on the door four times for more than an hour. Are you afraid that you won’t stay in the room anymore? I called at ten o'clock in the evening and said that there was no luggage in your room. Did you feel that you couldn't live without it? Does it have anything to do with you? How can I make a phone call so late at night if I can't live in the room, and I don't have to pay a day's room rate? Are you in a hurry to sell your room? You entered the room so many times in the afternoon, and you found that your suitcase was gone. When you returned to the hotel in the evening, you didn't put any toiletries in it? What did you do in the room? Just check to see if the luggage is there? It's really ridiculous. There are too many hotels, especially with children, don't choose this one, it's too bad.

msg:Environment: Good location, a landmark building on the edge of the Jinjiang River. Going out and crossing a bridge, you can come to Jiuyanqiao Bar Street, where you can spend a good time at night. Located in the central city, it is also very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel to various attractions.
Room: Horizontal Club Riverview rooms are small in size, especially the entrance is very narrow. The landscape is facing the Jinjiang River, but the night view is average. The curtains are electric, the bed is very comfortable, and the thickness of the quilt is just right. The air conditioner is strong and quiet. The distance between toilet and shower room is small. The shower has a large amount of water and the water temperature is good. The room was very quiet.
Catering: The products in the Horizon Club are more exquisite, and the breakfast also has a la carte noodles, etc., and the taste is acceptable. There are more varieties of breakfast on the first floor.
Hygiene: Cleaning didn't start at 5 pm one day, and after cleaning, it was found that the shower room was also cleaned up. Another day I don't have to clean the whole house and just take out the trash. The little brother came empty-handed at first, and asked him to go back and get a garbage bag. After a long time, the bag was covered with a trash can, and he stood up, lifted the trash can, and poured it down. I was so scared that I sat on the sofa and watched this wonder. Finally he went out, I said thank you habitually, and the little brother left without looking back. So I froze again.
Service: The attitude of the waiters in the Horizon Club is very good. We basically go to the lounge for dinner in the morning and evening, and they will remember my surname. It's just that after pouring black tea, they won't come over for a refill.
The doorman was very conscientious and thoughtful, and offered to help carry the boxes.

The overall feeling is still good, good value for money. Maybe I am more demanding and care more about details. Come to think of it, the cleaning guy might be a little socially fearful.

msg:My impression of Chengdu is not only from the prosperity of the Land of Abundance and the beautiful waters and mountains in the hometown of giant pandas, but also from the temptation of delicious food and the attachment of the taste buds.
The precipitation of the years has made Chengdu culture extremely diverse. Classical elegance is inseparable from its body, and fashion and leisure are synonymous with it.
During this business trip to Chengdu, I stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel next to the Jiuyan Bridge, next to Lan Kwai Fong. It was really fun to drink and party at night
The hotel has Rong Coffee, Happy Hour at Shang Palace and Datang Lounge. Tasting a city naturally starts with food. Shang Palace, the signature Chinese restaurant of Shangri-La Hotel in Chengdu, is the unavoidable choice. I like Maoxuewang and boiled beef👍
There are many red wine and foreign wine exhibition halls on the first and second floors, and there are many people.
The breakfast is arranged in the cafeteria on the 36th floor. The food is rich and varied, and the appearance of the dishes is very delicate. I have eaten dan dan noodles for three consecutive mornings. It tastes great👍
Service: The waiters in the restaurant on the 36th floor are very kind and patient. There are many people who come to eat every morning. They take it seriously and arrange to meet the male manager.

msg:I booked two days, two orders. I didn't notice the difference in room types when booking. I booked two room types, River View and River View Pavilion (I didn't notice the difference when booking). When checking in, I told the front desk that we booked two days. Can I swipe the room card for two days directly? Because I was going to Dujiangyan the next day, it was troublesome to come back late. The front desk told me that I saw your order (I didn't tell me the difference in room types), but the front desk said that the two orders could not be swiped at the same time, but it didn't matter. I just swiped the room card again when I came back the next day.
I got up early the next day and went to Dujiangyan. In the afternoon, I called the hotel specifically to tell them that there were so many people in the scenic area. It would be very late to return to Chengdu from Dujiangyan at night. I needed the front desk to find my room order. I booked for two days, so I didn't have to change the room. The signal in Qingcheng Mountain was not good. I was afraid that I couldn't contact the hotel. The hotel said it was no problem! And I asked her to make a note.
I returned to the hotel at more than 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. The black uniform of the front desk (should be the manager) told me that the room type was different and I needed to change the room. If I didn't change the room, I would have to pay the price difference. The point is that the attitude was very bad! She didn't ask her colleague about the whole story, but just asked to change rooms and make up the difference. In the end, we were very angry and had a few words. The woman didn't apply to anyone, but just swiped the room card and continued to live in the same room. She didn't have a good attitude throughout the whole process, and she didn't look happy until she swiped the card. ****

msg:From 03.10 to 03.11, I stayed in Chengdu Shangri-La for two days. It was the most comfortable hotel I stayed in Chengdu. Located on the Jiuyan Bridge, all river view rooms can enjoy the invincible night view.
First stay in Deluxe River View Room 3504, enjoy the distant view in the early morning, but the view of the river is blocked. Therefore, it was lowered to 1019 again.
The luxury room toiletries are L'Occitane, and the vanity mirror has lights. The common room is Shangri-La, and there is no light in the vanity mirror.
Luxury electric curtains are usually manual.
Luxury air-conditioning control keys have more functions than ordinary ones.
The common disadvantage is that the TV is too old, not clear, and relatively small. The toilet seat has no cushion and rattles.
The episode is the river view room booked by Ctrip, the hotel shows the city view room...
Hotel service is quite good! ! ! Every bread stall for breakfast is delicious! !
Manager Li Ping is super nice! A gentle and gentle beauty, with a beautiful heart and a beautiful heart, she feels like flowers are blooming when she smiles ~ Professional service, perfect communication, Shangri-La is worthy of being the best hotel management group in the world.
Although the hotel facilities look a bit outdated now, it can make people deeply understand the sentence: "Excellent hotels come from excellent employees"! Next time we go to Chengdu, we will contact Li Ping to choose Shangri-La, thank you very much, see you next time

Worthy of being a star hotel, the hotel lobby is gorgeous and elegant, and the baby pandas are all cute. The important thing is that the service is as warm and considerate as ever.

msg:I booked a room from Ctrip a week in advance, a panda-themed room for 2 nights for 2,799 (including breakfast). When I arrived in Chengdu, I checked Ctrip and the price for two nights including breakfast became 2,362.22, which was 436.78 cheaper than me. Looking at Dianping again, it turns out that it is cheaper, including double breakfast for RMB 2346, which is RMB 453 cheaper.
I just want to know how Ctrip determines the price. Will the price increase by nearly 500 yuan just because I want to go? Isn't this a rip-off?
Then I want to complain about this hotel. It is very old and the rooms are very small, super small. The price is so high compared to Kempinski. The waiter's service was also very poor, and he was very impatient when he went to the front desk to register.

Next time you come to Chengdu, Shangri-La is still our first choice!

But the facilities are too old, the family expressed their dissatisfaction, and the price/performance ratio is too low. Swimming pool The temperature of the children's pool is a bit low, and it is a bit cold for the children to enter the water at this time.
The breakfast is okay, a little rough, and I hope it can be improved in the breakfast.
The overall effect is not worth the price.

She helped us with the check-in with a gentle and polite attitude. He even helped us upgrade the room. Mandy was serious when I checked out. Help me issue invoices and check out. I really like the feeling that there is no sense of distance and strangeness. It always makes people feel very warm. Shangri-La is the first choice for me to stay in hotels in various places. Even though the facilities may be old, the attitude and service have won. The two people who cleaned the room on the 34th floor were also very considerate. They told us to play and drink more water. They specially left two bottles of water for us. , I remember that I stayed in a hotel before and asked for a bottle of water and charged. I want to say please learn from Shangri-La.

The view is very good, and there are many delicious food nearby. I personally think this experience is the result of my stay in Chengdu. The best and most quiet among different locations.

I am so angry. How can it be rated as a five-star hotel? Did it go through the back door? Rubbish rubbish rubbish! The sheets were torn and smelly. I couldn't check in until 3 o'clock. I forgot to bring my clothes and came to pick them up. I called 30 minutes ago and had to wait a long time to pick them up. I was overwhelmed. I'm speechless.

msg:This is my first comment, I feel it is necessary. I drove from Shanghai to Chengdu to celebrate the New Year. I stayed in several first-tier hotels in several cities along the way. Now I would like to share with you the Shangri-La Hotel in Chengdu. We stayed for 4 days. The front desk service was very good on the first day when we arrived at the hotel. We saw that we were two adults and one child, and showed us the executive suite. You can get an extra bed for free. The size of the room is twice as large. After seeing it, we decided to upgrade . The luggage boy was very enthusiastic and sent the luggage to the room. The room arranged welcome fruit, which was very rich and not perfunctory. The extra bed on the first day was a kind of camp bed, which was very small and hard, and it was uncomfortable to sleep in. After communicating with the room manager, the camp bed was directly replaced with a standard single bed in a twin room. It was a hard room The staff let me sleep well for the next few days, and left a note on the second day after changing, asking me how I slept, very considerate. The Shang Palace restaurant in the hotel is also very impressive. The food tastes very good. I eat in the hotel almost every day. The service is also first-class, especially the manager of Shang Palace. He learned that we have not passed the sun yet, so he left other restaurants that are not open. The area is open for us alone, and a service staff is specially assigned to take care of it. The New Year's Eve dinner was also booked at Shang Palace, and the manager Ping An even came to toast, making people feel at home. The location of the hotel is very good, the scenery is also good, the breakfast is rich, especially the service of the Horizon Club is also very good. In short, the hotels along the way are all average, but the service and quality of the Shangri-La Hotel are impressive, which is definitely not inferior to the first-line hotels in Shanghai. I strongly recommend it to everyone, and I will stay here again without hesitation next time I come to Chengdu.

I was not disappointed, the staff were very friendly and always responded to requests for service in a timely manner. I can especially drink water. After explaining to the staff, the staff will put enough bottled water in the room every day. Other small items that are needed will be delivered to the room in time by the staff. In short, the service is very attentive. The hotel's buffet breakfast is very good, with a variety of varieties, and you can eat to your heart's content. I would like to give a special compliment to the bean curd. It is tender and sweet. It is the best bean curd I have eaten in Chengdu. It is placed in the corner of the restaurant. You should pay special attention to it when you have breakfast. The hotel is clean and a**ospheric, the location is good, and it is convenient to go everywhere. I will choose Shangri-La next time I go to Chengdu.

     It’s not very important to save diamonds, just keep an emerald, because the breakfast at his house is generally more expensive, and Shangri-La is not very good in the whole Greater China. Everything is very good. Chengdu is located in the core area of Jinjiang District, behind Lan Kwai Fong. The B1 downstairs is said to be very convenient and especially suitable for visiting here.

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the ladies at the front desk helped us to upgrade to the Horizon Club room on the 34th floor. The room has L-shaped windows, and the beautiful scenery around the hotel can be seen at a glance.
The hotel's breakfast is also rich in variety, as well as the distinctive bell dumplings and dan dan noodles. It is very important to do nucleic acid testing during the epidemic. Nucleic acid testing services are available from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm at the entrance on the second floor of the hotel.
When checking out, the young lady at the front desk also specially gave a red panda gift. Thanks again to Xiao Xiao, Fan Fan, and cecilia at the front desk.

My answer is that it is convenient to go out and do business, and more importantly, I can enjoy privileges. Upgrade the room type to a high-rise! Today, when I left in a hurry, I forgot a piece of clothing in the hotel. Ms. Ada called me continuously to help me solve the problem, thank you! I will come to live again next time, hahaha!

The only good thing is that the breakfast is very rich, especially the chefs of pancakes, fruits and pastries are very enthusiastic, and the other waiters are useless and feel overwhelmed.

Xiao Xiao, the receptionist who checked me in, is someone I've seen who is quite enthusiastic in the hotel industry. There are too many hotels in China, but not many people are passionate about the hotel industry. Come on, I'll keep an eye on you, little girl.

Before the end of the quarantine, the flights were canceled, and I could only stay in a hotel for one night and take the high-speed train home the next day. The wife is just not feeling well. I am very worried about whether the hotel can pick us up during the epidemic, let us check in, and where to test nucleic acid. We contacted the luggage depar**ent of the hotel. A young man named Xiaoma answered all our questions very carefully and dispelled all our concerns. As soon as the quarantine was over, I arranged a vehicle to let the master wait downstairs, and did the nucleic acid for the high-speed rail the next day. When we arrived at the hotel, the pony was already waiting for us. The tour manager in the front office warmly welcomed us to help us handle it, and the pony gang's wife wheelchair was also arranged. Take us to the room. During the epidemic, we can only dine in the hotel and have no chance to experience various services. The next day, the breakfast was packed and brought back to the room. The restaurant staff took the initiative to help me make porridge and various snacks. Although I rushed back in just one day, in the difficult crisis, I saw the hotel staff's ability to deal with various problems and the quality of treating guests, which is worthy of the brand of Shangri-La Hotel.

It takes more than half an hour to check in. The amazing thing is that a deposit is required. I have a lot of luggage. The hotel waiter sees it. They walked around after I arrived, maybe because they were afraid of carrying my luggage. The facilities inside the room were old and the hygiene was not very good. I have stayed in so many hotels and this was the worst experience I had! ! In the end, the price is over a thousand, so it’s not worth it! What is meant by virtue is not worthy of position, it describes this kind of hotel.

The service of the five-star hotel is really good. It is really great that nucleic acid testing services are provided for free every evening. Special thanks to He Min and Aunt Wang Xiuhua for keeping the room very clean every day. There are also Chris at the front desk and Rebecca at the executive lounge. The service attitude is particularly good, making us very comfortable during our stay. Brother Chris has always been conscientious and patient.

When I continued my stay, Jin Yu, the VIP receptionist, asked about the experience of staying at the hotel very enthusiastically. I casually said that the room felt a little cold, as if there was wind at the head of the bed, and I immediately asked the relevant colleagues to check the air-conditioning equipment. In the hotel I have stayed in, it should be the most enthusiastic and in-place service. Next time I come to Chengdu, I will continue to live in it. ❤️

The scenery is very good, and the whole covered bridge has a panoramic view. The hotel's epidemic prevention and control is also in place, rigorous and careful without making people feel troublesome.
During the stay, I wanted to entertain visiting guests, so I asked if there was any good tea. The concierge Tyler and his team really helped me bring a good tea, so that my guests and I were in this rainy and rainy place. Rongcheng felt more warm and comfortable, accompanied by the Fuhe River, with good tea, and the work became much more pleasant.
Although I only stayed for one day, I deeply felt the warm hospitality of the hotel staff. Such professional and attentive staff also reflected the good management of the hotel, and I wish the hotel business is booming.

msg:In addition to living comfortably in Shangri-La, for me, this residence is more of a healing. If it wasn't for the sudden outbreak of the epidemic in the past few days, I would have been prepared to stay for a few more days.
The last time I came here was more than 10 years ago. After many years, nothing seems to have changed. Except for the epidemic, the bar downstairs was closed, and there was no piano performance in the lobby bar. However, the care for the guests has only increased from 10 years ago.
There is no need to talk about the environment and hardware conditions, only the details are the most attractive, such as giving flowers every day, sending various fruits according to your preferences, if you don’t like the existing toiletries, you immediately change a set, and the room delivery is neat. Comprehensive, from the front desk to room service to the concierge, it seems that every link can wrap the guest comfortably. Shang Palace's food is really delicious. The gym facilities are older, but the quality and hygiene are still online.

Presumably this is what distinguishes Shangri-La from other hotels, winning in service and details.

I sincerely hope that Shangri-La can maintain its own style as always.

Thank you to every Shangri-La friend who provided service.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent, and Chengdu snacks are behind it. 10 minutes walk to the subway entrance. The distance between Chunxi Road and Panda departure is two subway stops, which is convenient for travel. However, with five-star hardware and three-star service, the waiters in the lobby are unreasonable, and only a few are more enthusiastic. The restaurant is better than the waiters in the lobby. No welcome, not even opening the door for guests, needs improvement

A little regret is that the room you stayed in has a strong smell of traditional Chinese medicine. Because you have already checked in and put your personal belongings away, you have not changed the room. Subsequent service was well done and an air purifier was delivered right away.

msg:Shangri-La will never let us down.
My husband likes to live in Shangri-La wherever he goes, even in Chengdu.
I have higher requirements for hotels.
But Shangri-La, regardless of environmental sanitation, location, service level, hotel hardware, breakfast and catering, executive lounge, fitness pool, public facilities, including customer needs... It really did it, not to mention the extreme, but it was absolutely perfect. .
As an international five-star hotel, Shangri-La is really superior and competitive compared to other hotels.
We drove to Chengdu and booked the hotel one day in advance. A few hours after booking the hotel, the hotel called to confirm the information, upgraded the room, and asked me carefully if I had any requirements and needs. After communication, inform that the room has been reserved. After arriving at the hotel and entering the room, the fruit plate was delivered within a few minutes. When turning down at night, I also prepared hand sanitizer and masks on the table.
During the stay in the next few days, room attendants He Min and Zeng Yu cleaned twice a day, very meticulous. Moreover, the fruit trays are delivered in time every day, and no matter what needs are, they are met in time.
During the meal, Manager Guo, the manager of the Rong Coffee Restaurant, led the way carefully and prepared coffee and black tea. During the meal, they will also introduce and inquire about the meal. Really attentive.
For breakfast on the last day to leave, the restaurant manager Zhong, really did his enthusiasm in every possible way. After being guided to the seat, I brought coffee and asked briefly about the dining situation and taste. I learned that we were leaving Chengdu by car today, and specially prepared some bread, yogurt and fruit for us so that we could satisfy our hunger on the road.
When checking out, Manager Yang at the front desk gave me a four-piece sample set of L’Occitane.
Really, Shangri-La makes us feel at home outside.
Shangri-La — really, from booking to check-out, it gives you that kind of comfort, unparalleled!
The next day, there will be customer service inquiries about accommodation, as well as opinions and suggestions.
This is excellent.

🍃Environment: It's okay, it's a bit old, it feels like it needs to be refurbished.

🔔Service: There is no welcome service, the lobby is a bit noisy, and there is no one to help us with our luggage, but the check-in in the front hall is faster, which is very good.
There are a few small comments: 1. The two beds in the twin room are all facing the mirror, domestic people still mind it.
Came over at 2 and 5 o'clock to turn down my bed. I was a little shocked because I just checked in to the room.
Finally, the hotel did a return visit and it was good.

There was also a bathtub screen but no remote control, no bath salt, poor service, and check-in was slow and slow. In short, compared to all over the country Shangri-La is completely different.

msg:Shangri-La is a brand hotel that I like very much. During my trip to Chengdu, I did not hesitate to choose to stay here. It did not disappoint me. As always, the hotel is located on the Funan River, and across the bridge is Bar Street and Langui. At night, you can experience the extraordinary nightlife, and there is the Shuijingfang Museum at the back, where you can visit and experience the brewing craftsmanship and the blending of fine wines, allowing you to feel the true meaning of "the fragrance of wine is not afraid of the deep alley". The appearance of the hotel is magnificent and warm A**osphere, the floral decoration in the lobby is very beautiful, beautiful and elegant, making people linger, check-in at the front desk is fast, cost-effective, rich breakfast, variety, and delicious. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with well-equipped facilities, well maintained, and the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows is also very good. The most outstanding thing is the service here, which is top-notch, especially the room attendant Li Yan. She is enthusiastic, proactive, patient, and has a strong sense of service. She introduces the surrounding environment and helps to formulate travel strategies. I am afraid that I am not familiar with the route and caring. Send me a map, I highly recommend it to everyone, staying here is definitely your most correct choice.

msg:It's the fifth day of staying, and there are different experiences every day. Today, Wang Yi, the reception director, called to ask about his feelings about staying in. He also gave moon cakes and a red panda with a logo.
I rushed back from Mount Emei and decided to continue to choose Shangri-La. This time, Ms. Wang Yi and Wang Wei at the front desk helped upgrade the river view room, and also presented the hotel breakfast. It must be said that Chengdu’s river view has a special charm. The breakfast is very rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western, and the taste is very good. Good, fully meets the standards of high-end hotels.
This time I also went to experience the gym on the 4th floor of the hotel. It has a large space and a wide range of equipment. It is equipped with a swimming pool, yoga room and private classrooms. It can be said that it has everything.

Clean, the room has all kinds of tea to make, and it was delivered 🍑😋. The panda afternoon tea in the lobby is super cost-effective and highly recommended!

The decoration of the room is too old. The white sheets come with black after long use. See the photos for the others. I won't repeat them one by one.
It is estimated that the public areas have been renovated and still have a vibrant a**osphere. But some of the flowers in the lobby have been ruined and no one has trimmed it, making it incomprehensible.
We have a welcome drink every day, which can be consumed in the hotel’s 5 bars. We went to 3 of them, 1 said it’s not possible here, 1 said it’s not free, it’s 20% off, and 1 said it’s free but a fixed price. After understanding, this one doesn’t sound like it sounds, so I gave up
So the Shangri-La Hotel in Chengdu is just a name, with a 3-star standard

From the greetings she added on WeChat the day before arrival, to the room with the best river view when I arrived at the hotel, the restaurant she recommended for three days allowed us to eat the most authentic Chengdu food. Before leaving, she also recommended that I take the most authentic Shuangliu Lao Ma Rabbit Head souvenirs back to share with friends. She always answered questions at any time. She was both professional and warm. She was really a gold medal housekeeper. 👍I saw beautiful scenery and delicious food in Chengdu for three days, and felt the family-like care of Shangri-La. I had a very wonderful time. I look forward to coming again soon. Once again, I sincerely thank the beautiful and generous housekeeper Sandy D!

房間兩面落地玻璃朝江，景色宜人，小確幸。
房間雖然不算大但格局緊湊，對於出差的人開會等需求均可滿足，安心。
早餐很有本地特色，煎餅擔擔麪豆花…西點方面，牛角包很酥，真愛，法棍略軟但味道不錯，其它小點衹嘗試兩種，貨真價實，可惜肚子太小無法多品嚐。每早一杯現沖拿鐵，對咖啡不太感冒的我也覺得濃濃咖啡香很愜意。
酒店裡各崗位的工作人員都很熱情，接觸比較多的客服服務阿姨都非常貼心。特別是胡小艷阿姨，我隨口問是否可能多要一衹熊貓玩偶（家裡倆娃，不知咋分，無暇挑選相當的禮物），阿姨主動説幫忙詢問協調，還説可能其他客人不帶走可能有給留意找找。果然晚上回房間就看到兩衹可愛的熊貓寶寶靜靜等待，太感謝了！
管家Sandy也是全程適時有度給予關注和服務，不會讓我覺得被打擾，離店前還送了小禮物。
朋友每次來都住這裏，很喜歡其洗漱用品，説品質好，這回終於體驗到，確實好。
還要點贊床品，三個晚上都睡得美美的，床鋪不硬不軟正好，枕頭是最舒服的柔軟度，被子鬆軟提起放下時能感受到被裡填充物緩緩落在身上，有在雲朵裏的舒服感。這些對於我非常重要，真希望家裡的也都換成痛品質的。
已經安利同事，下次值得擁有。

另外，即便給你們香格里拉5星好評，但是還想提個建議：我今天早上10點退房，前台4位工作人員全部在辦理入住手續，足足等了15-20分鐘，首先，早上的時間不是應該以退房及開發票為主的麼？入住一般不都是下午2點後辦理的嘛，就算你們上午也辦理入住，不要影響退房的心情吧？4個工作人員能不能分1個人出來退房呢？這麼忙的時候，大堂副理幹什麼去了？

msg:老牌的大酒店，服務與硬件，好是應該的。
房間大，景觀好，房間安靜，早餐豐富，電梯等待時間，這些都不錯。
位置沒有太古裏那邊人流這麼多，相對靜點。
但蘭桂坊酒吧街就在樓下，過安順廊橋後也有很多音樂餐廳，走過去聽下歌，吃點東西也是不錯的選擇，小朋友也喜歡。

找一下缺點：迎賓水果盤中的水果刀是西餐的餐刀，不好用。電視小，像素低。有浴缸，但沒浴缸泡澡的一次性塑料膜（那個叫什麼？），最好提供點海鹽。。。
洗澡水壓很大，但感覺水質很硬，去水池查看一下，是不是很久沒清洗了？還有管道。
這個要求有點**，但洗澡時給我的感覺這水就是在水池裡已經呆了很久的水。算了，當我沒説過。衹是對優秀者更苛刻的標準吧，希望貴酒店越來越好。

終於有一家酒店，超過了以前自認為服務最好的濟南魯能貴和洲際酒店，其它上檔次的諸如北京的半島酒店，文化酒店，服務都不如這次
江景房的視野也美得冒泡泡，唯一的缺點，就是酒店內部設施有點老，應該重新裝修一下了。
酒店的Titany服務態度也非常哇塞，下次來成都還入住成都香格里拉

服務方面，要特別感謝mandy，在去成都前就聯繫我，並給免費升了江景房，還給了小禮物，而且每天會聯繫詢問是否需要提供補充水果，非常暖心，再次感謝mandy的服務。
其他酒店員工也是非常熱情，這次旅行讓我感覺這幾年沒住成香是一大憾事，哈哈哈。
服務很好，睡的很舒服，非常滿意，下次還會再訂成香的。

餐廳的菜品再多點蔬菜就更好了，不過還算豐盛，工作人員服務態度很好，第一天剛到用下午茶時，服務大使陳哲妮看我們帶兩個孩子，還主動幫忙申請免了大寶兒的費用。第二天退房時因為孩子在熊貓基地玩的太嗨，一直到下午4點半多才趕回退房，服務中心小張和貴賓接待主任楊歡都很痛快的幫忙做了延時和退房手續。
整體特別滿意，很適合帶孩子來住，臨走時送兩個孩子的熊貓，孩子們喜歡的不得了，哈哈。

msg:香格里拉是我最喜歡的酒店，沒有之一。

成都的香格里拉是第一次住，也是非常滿意。

酒店的地理位置超級棒，雖然成都這幾年發展很快，但我還是喜歡更有底藴的老城區。

早餐居然都坐滿了，可見喜歡香格里拉的人很多。我第一天的早餐是坐在室外吃的，哈哈哈，破天荒第一次，不過也挺好，河邊的空氣清醒。

賓客主任Lisa在我入住前、入住期間、入住後，都給予熱情周到的服務，特別負責，真正讓我感到賓至如歸。

前幾天還在上海的浦東香格里拉，整個裝修風格，乃至聖誕節裝飾，都和成都香格里拉如出一轍，這種一致性，讓我覺得特別習慣。

另外，在一樓買了個熊貓，快遞迴上海送朋友，得到了一位叫朱剛的先生周到的服務。

包括退房時候，前台一位沒注意名字的女士，能貼心的把插到我前面的人勸退，讓我先完成了退房。（順便鄙視一下那位大搖大擺插隊的女士😌）

總結——特別好！香格里拉永遠是值得信賴的酒店！

什麼需求可幫我解決，讓我瞬間感覺非常的親切，每天的問候和關照，真的讓人倍感温心。在此表示衷心的感謝🙏🌹
   再是酒店前台美女小姐姐非常的細緻耐心和專業，幫我解決了吸煙房的需求，且幫我榮幸成為了香格里拉大酒店的會員。怨我太粗心沒留意她的名牌。藉此也向她表示感謝🙏🌹
   特別要提到樓層的服務工作人員（王懷清，鄒仕珍）倆位姐姐態度超暖 ，每天房間都打掃的一塵不染，真的很敬業，非常的奈斯，謝謝！🙏👍
   這次入住成都香格里拉大酒店，給我的體驗感真的太好了，也無法用三言兩語來表達的，衹能就此向貴酒店全體辛勤工作的服務人員表示萬分感謝！再見！🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
   噢，差點忘了還有熊貓嘟嘟的伴手禮，非常可愛。

msg:酒店設施略微有點陳舊，電視機能感覺到明顯的年代感，不過這個年代又有多少人看電視呢，所以無所謂。第一晚的住宿體驗還可以，各種服務也挺到位。但第二天早晨出門後，我請前台幫忙更換床上用品之類。晚上回酒店後房間裏出現了非常強烈的煙味。詢問前台後請工作人員來房間檢查。給出的結論是短時間內無法消除，所以給我換了房間。更換後的房間首先位置上不如最開始的房間，房間不足可以理解，但是新房間裏的拖鞋藏得很隱蔽，天花板邊緣的燈還閃爍不停，恐怕這個房間之前並沒有準備給人住吧？還是説看我一個人住寂寞要給我來點午夜兇鈴的氛圍感？詢問了前台我房間出現煙味的原因，衹説可能是線路老化後續會調查，我退房離開也沒有給個結論，如果就按照這個説法，豈不是説我前一晚是呆在找一個隨時會因為線路老化而產生危險的房間裏咯？好歹是5星酒店，不至於出現這種路邊50塊一晚小旅館的問題吧？
總的來説，酒店位置挺好，衞生狀況也不錯，服務人員態度也棒，但發生這種事情，下次讓我再住我是不會再住了。

       這次讓我感動的有兩件事：第一，禮賓部的Ella為我周到的解決了我面臨的問題。因我離開成都後還需要到其他地方，有部分東西攜帶起來不太方便，我瞭解到禮賓部可以提供快遞服務，當時是Ella接待我的，我跟她商量是否可以在酒店暫存一段時間再快遞，因為我擔心最近家裡沒有人接收快遞不太方便。Ella瞭解到我的需求後，在對我解釋酒店管理政策的基礎上也考慮了我的具體情況，最終提出的方案既不違反酒店政策也解決了我的問題。我感覺她是一個好員工，即遵守酒店的規定又非常體諒住客的困難，讓我感到了春天般的温暖。第二，Allen是客賓關係部主任，非常貼心的詢問我入住的情況，是否需要她們提供幫助，並代表酒店在入住和離店後贈送了伴手禮。
總之，這次的入住感受非常好，感謝提供的各項服務！
