msg:The worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Soft drinks in the mini bar are almost free in that five-star hotel. You can charge for them, or write a fee list and put it on the table. There's nothing written. I drank a few bottles of water, but they called and charged 300 yuan! The most speechless thing is that you can't wear hotel slippers to eat breakfast in the morning, you have to wear formal shoes. Obviously, you get up early in the morning to eat breakfast and sleep for a while, but you have to go back to change shoes. The service environment is not good, and there are too many rules! The waiters in the breakfast restaurant are more arrogant than each other! It's better to close down soon.

msg:From reception to check-in, to the gym, breakfast, etc., everything was very good. I slept until about 2 a.m., and a sudden scream woke me and my girlfriend up. It was about 2 a.m., and a woman was crying and shouting loudly, "Ah! Ah! Ah!" one after another, screaming madly and slamming the door. We thought the sound would soon pass, and then the noise continued until 3:30. After the girl stopped crying, a man stood at the door and repeated the woman's name surnamed Wang for hundreds of times, saying, "I didn't touch you, I sent you to the hotel, your clothes are good, blah blah blah," etc. At one point I wanted to call the police, and called the front desk. The staff came, but the woman continued to make noises, and I don't know if her friends or relatives came later, but the volume of the sound still did not decrease. However, the hotel's handling of this kind of emergency was indeed unprofessional. All the important schedules the next day could not proceed normally because of this night's insomnia. I have to bear this loss alone and will not come again. Please don't call back at the hotel, because this matter has made me exhausted.

msg:The room is not very big, but the facilities are quite complete, with a bathtub, and the bathroom is separated into wet and dry areas. I originally wanted to order a big bed, but it seems that the single beds are larger when put together, which is just right.
The hygiene is relatively clean, and the service is very thoughtful and patient.
In addition to the brand strength and sense of security, the reason for living here is actually the convenience of the location and the height.
In terms of location: no matter where you go, it is not particularly far. It takes about half an hour to climb the mountain the next day. There are also many places to eat around. Suning Plaza is right next to the downstairs. If you park in the underground parking lot, you can find a parking ticket. Although we didn’t find it the first time we went out, it’s a little more than 10 yuan for 2 hours, maybe 2 yuan for half an hour. I don’t know why it seems to feel cheaper than some places in Qingdao~ After that, I parked on the ground because it was convenient, otherwise I would need to take an elevator.
The high-rise is really beautiful. You can see the clouds and mountains when you wake up in the morning, and the traffic on the road at night. Even if there is some singing and music downstairs, it will not be noisy, and the sound is much smaller.
The hotel staff, especially the girls, are very friendly and neat.

The hotel front desk called me to ask about my preferences before I checked in, and then prepared slippers and a children's gift bag for my son. When I checked in, I was upgraded to a 40th-floor king-size room for free, with a view of the harbor city. The bed and bedding were very comfortable, and the breakfast also amazed me. It was not inferior to the breakfast of a four-star hotel in Gold Coast, Australia. The handmade big buns, wontons, and roujiamo were all delicious! The hotel waiters were enthusiastic and polite. Downstairs was the bustling Suning Plaza, which was super good.

The hotel lobby is magnificent, the room layout is elegant, the disposable supplies are of high quality, the room is very clean, and the stay is very comfortable. What satisfies me the most is that I can overlook the distance through the window. I can enjoy the bright moon and the night view of the city even while lying in bed in the early morning. The breakfast is very rich, the soy milk tastes very good, and there are also freshly made Roujiamo. I didn't expect it, it's delicious! The waiter's service was also very good.

Because we arrived late, the afternoon tea provided by the executive was not available in time, and we were replaced with dinner.

BRT Tour 2 at the entrance can go to Liandao, Tour 3 can go to Huaguoshan Island, and Didi can go to Yuntaishan 70. It is very close to Yanhe Lane from the train station and the taxi fare is less than 10 yuan. The lobby is very grand, and check-in and check-out are very fast (the lady who checked in is very nice), and the doorman with an old man will help with luggage. You can open the window in the room. It's a bit cold and stuffy to turn on the air conditioner in this weather. It's very comfortable to open the window. However, our room faces the Civic Square, and the square will be noisy until 11 o'clock when people sing at night. Cleaning is done in a timely manner every day. You can have a good rest when you are tired from playing. Cleaning also pays attention to details, because the windows are open and the tables and dust are cleaned. For breakfast, there are freshly made steamed buns and noodles with Lianyungang characteristics. The tofu is delicious, the coffee is delicious, and there are a variety of Western and Chinese dishes. The driver of the car said it was the best hotel in Lianyungang and it felt very good.

Then I went to the executive floor to have afternoon tea. The scenery was very good. I climbed up and looked into the distance. I sat and looked at the distance, and it suddenly became enlightened. To be honest, Sofitel's afternoon tea always amazes me. It's really good quality and affordable. I stayed at a hotel in Sanya before. With such a good environment and food, afternoon tea starts at 300 RMB in other places, but RMB 198 at Sofitel, and it’s RMB 198 here too. I was just thinking about ordinary afternoon tea, but I actually got the Fendi co-branded afternoon tea for 198. Absolutely amazing, visually very happy. The taste is also satisfied.
All in all, I am very satisfied and will come back next time.

msg:This should be the most comfortable hotel in Lianyungang, right?
In the old town of Lianyungang,
The hotel is suitable for business travel
The waiters should be considered the most professional hotel in Lianyungang.
Here are all comparisons with this city.
We cannot compare provincial capitals or first-tier cities.
In this way, in third-tier cities, they really look professional when compared with each other.
The decoration of the hotel is also relatively well maintained.
If you come to Lianyungang on a business trip for three or two days, you can rest assured to choose here.

Staying on the top floor of the hotel, the night view is also good. There is also a small gift when you leave the hotel. A more generous buffet would be better.

I entered the room and wanted to open the refrigerator, but I didn’t open it at first, so I called the waiter to open it, but it was opened, but it couldn’t be closed, so it took me a long time to do it again! I think the desk lamp in the office is not on again. I waited for a long time. I wanted to take a shower but I was afraid that no one would open the door when the master came. Wait! It's finally here, and I don't have the slightest desire to sit down and work! Really speechless, the wallpaper on the wall next to it, the cabinets are all broken! There are still white things on the sofa! too disgusting! May I ask how this meets the standard of a star hotel, and then take a closer look at the decoration, and return to the retro and dilapidated feeling of the 80s, it is really dirty everywhere! It's not as disappointing as the Express Hotel! ! ! ! !

I responded to her and was about to open the door. She heard it from outside the door, but she used the staff room card to open the door herself. This is very rude. Bar! Third: It will be more environmentally friendly and convenient to replace the small soap with hand sanitizer! Fourth: no fruit. I stayed in a total of 7 hotels in 3 cities during my trip this time. There are luxurious ones, high-end ones and economical ones. The other 6 hotels will deliver a plate of fruit every night. Of course, the more expensive hotels have more advanced fruits, but This hotel is the only one that doesn’t have it, and even the All Season Hotel gives away a few small tomatoes and 2 bananas every night, which is a bit out of touch in the industry. Long Zhiyu, the deputy director of housing affairs, was very kind and took the initiative to tell us where to go with our children. Hope to improve next time.

But I have to complain about the hotel service problem. I drank a few bottles of drinks in the freezer. I thought it was free. I have stayed in many high-end hotels for free. As a result, the fee was charged, and the fee was not unacceptable. I didn't ask when I checked out, and I refunded it directly. The hotel even chased me over and called me to ask for it. They blamed me for drinking their drinks. They sneaked away and didn’t tell them. They didn’t ask if they had any extra drinks in the freezer when they checked out. They expected the user to tell you? Can I know if it is free or paid? Whether money is money or not is a small problem, but if there is a problem with one's own work, it is irritating to put the responsibility on the user first.

msg:The hotel is very convenient in the city center, about ten minutes by taxi from the high-speed rail station. The hotel is very good, the lobby is decorated for the New Year very festively, there is a handsome guy named Qiao Tenglong at the front desk who is very enthusiastic, and the check-in is very fast. Seeing that I am a member, he gave me a cup of coffee, and arranged a relatively high floor with a very good view. The key is that they turned on the air conditioner for me in advance. The room is very warm, which is so considerate. The room was cleaned very clean, overall very satisfied~

msg:I often stay in their hotel. Sofitel's hotel decoration in Lianyungang is pretty good. All the service staff I met have a very good attitude. What impressed me the most was Xiao Zhang at the front desk. I met her both during check-in and check-out. Her service attitude was very good. It made people feel that Sofitel is a big hotel with very warm service. The hotel's room facilities are also very good, and the Sofitel's bed is the most comfortable I've slept in so far. There are also many types of buffets in the hotel, and the dishes are fresh and nutritious. I usually go to the hotel's gym to swim and keep fit. It's great that the hotel also has these services. It's so comfortable! Super praise!

The hotel gym is also very good, and there are many children in the swimming pool who are on summer vacation.
The service of the hotel made me feel very considerate. On the first night, I saw that I used a bathtub bag in my bathtub, and the housekeeping staff specially prepared a new bathtub bag on the second day. I gave full marks to this detail.

Returning from Shandong to Shanghai by car, I felt a bit rushed halfway, so I stayed in Lianyungang for one night, and chose this one near Suning Plaza.

Living on the 30th floor, compared to the surrounding floors, the view is good; the room size is moderate, the layout is comfortable, and the facilities are quite complete; the service is not bad, and the breakfast is also available [smiley][smiley][smiley]
