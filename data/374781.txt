Another issue was their gym is only open limited hours.  Those hours are such that we were gone out sightseeing during those hours.  Consequently, we never got to use it.  Most hotels have a 24-hour gym.

It is very close to Chongwenmen Subway Station and Wangfujing Subway Station. The old brand five-star hotel still has strength, whether it is the hotel's appearance, landscape design, room structure or lobby cooking. I stayed here for three days. The room was cleaned every day. The special ice cream and free bottled water still made customers feel the warmth from the capital. If I have to make suggestions, as an image of the capital, I hope to improve some information technology management, such as robot water delivery mode or self-service laundry equipment. If I bring my children to Beijing next time, I will still choose here, at least the space is spacious and the room is quiet.

First of all, the location is particularly advantageous, right next to Tiananmen Square, close to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the National Museum, the Military Museum, Houhai, and various alleys. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. The hotel is a Chinese garden-style hotel with rockery, flowing water, pavilions and towers. Although it is an old five-star hotel, the room facilities are OK. When I stayed there on Monday, the front desk upgraded the room and gave me ice cream. The room was large and I could see the Forbidden City. Overall, the cost performance is very high, recommended!

msg:First of all, let me summarize in one sentence: If you don't care much about the old equipment and facilities, then Beijing Capital Hotel is really a very good choice! Especially for those who are traveling to Beijing for the first time, the location of the hotel is really convenient! 
Let's talk about the service first. The doorman of Capital Hotel is one of the best service I have ever seen. Not only does he open and close the car door, but he also helps to load things and take things very actively! The room service is also very warm and generous. 5 bottles of large water and 5 bottles of small water every day are extremely thoughtful. Children's slippers are also replenished in time. Other supplies are also great. The water is also very delicious. I must give a big thumbs up! 
Let's talk about the room. Although the facilities and equipment in the room are a bit old, the arrangement and setting of the bathroom are still very reasonable, and various paper products are very convenient to use. The bed is very comfortable and the air conditioning effect is good. The only flaw is the design of the curtains. There is a part of the light-transmitting area, which is not very friendly to people who are afraid of light when sleeping, but wearing an eye mask can solve the problem. 
The hotel has its own restaurant and a catering brand. Lanyu Hotpot is not only delicious, but also has great service. I recommend friends who stay there to try it. Although the hotel's breakfast is not very rich, it can meet basic needs. It has everything you need, and the noodles taste good.
The hotel is in a very advantageous location. Dongjiaominxiang is just outside the back door. It is about a 20-minute walk from Tiananmen Square. The Forbidden City and Wangfujing are within walking distance. Although the hotel is not a resort hotel, it still has some exquisite pavilions and corridors, as well as a large waterfall. It is small but complete.
Overall, the price-performance ratio is still very good, and I recommend everyone to choose to stay!

Facilities: The overall facilities are a bit old, after all, it is an old hotel. The decoration style also has a sense of age. The room windows are large and the lighting is good, but there are some problems with the window handles of the two guest rooms. The bathroom is a little inconvenient to stand in the bathtub. There is no main light on the ceiling of the room. If you want the room to be bright, you can only use table lamps and floor lamps to supplement the light source.
Hygiene: Overall it is clean, but the details are slightly lacking.
Service: The service is very enthusiastic, and the room in Block A was upgraded for free. A small gift (an enamel 🍵 tea cup) was also given when checking in

msg:This time, I stayed in the hotel but there was no place to take photos. It's not that the place is bad, but I walked more than 20,000 steps every day, which was too tiring.
Originally, I stayed in this hotel because it was close to Tiananmen Square, but I was too tired every day to get up to watch the flag-raising ceremony, so I had to come again next time.
In addition, due to the low floor and the obstruction, the scenery of the hotel could not be seen at all.
Also, because I was outside the hotel all day, I went back every day after 10 o'clock in the evening, and I didn't enjoy any facilities at all, including the coffee provided, and I didn't have the energy to go.
However, there is one thing that the hotel does well. I suggest that people who stay in this hotel remember to ask for Band-Aids at the front desk. This is life-saving! ! !
Again, there is a JD convenience store nearby, where you can buy water, etc. But don't buy fruits from roadside shops.
I spent 24 yuan to buy 4 oranges in a small shop outside Chongwenmen subway station. They were packed in plastic boxes and told me not to pinch them. After I bought them and brought them back to the hotel, I found that all 4 oranges were rotten. They turned the rotten parts to the center or back of the four oranges instead of facing outwards, so that I couldn't see whether they were rotten or not, and they didn't let me touch them.
Depressed! I didn't expect that there are also places that cheat people in the capital, the best place. You still have to be careful when you go out!

It is an old five-star hotel. Although the room facilities are old, they are very clean. Especially it is very close to the starting point. After all, the location is very good.
It takes a few minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. It is very convenient to watch the national flag raising or go to the Forbidden City. It is also within 15 minutes to walk from Wangfujing and Qianmen.
The service is also good. The aunt who cleans the room may see that I am here for running, so she gave me 8 bottles of water every day, which is very considerate.
The disadvantage is that the handle of the bathtub is difficult to use. Some tips on how to use it can be given. Another point is that the blackout room is really dark, but fortunately there is a window for ventilation.
In terms of cost performance, it can be given full marks. If I have the opportunity to participate in the National Marathon again, I will still choose here.

msg:This is the worst accommodation experience among more than ten hotels I have booked on Ctrip. I saw in the introduction of the window-covered room in Building B that there is a window. It costs more than 800 yuan a night, but I didn't understand what window-covering means. As a result, the window of the room I stayed in faced a whole wall, just like a basement. I couldn't see my fingers without turning on the light. The room was cold and gloomy. I stayed for a day and asked for two quilts, but I caught a cold. It was a very bad experience. The front desk changed the room the next day. It was okay. The room facilities were old, not as good as the three-star hotel I stayed in before. The location was okay, 1.7 kilometers to Wangfujing, 1.9 kilometers to Beijing Railway Station, and 1.5 kilometers to Qianmen. The warmest place is Junting Restaurant on the second floor. When I arrived with my children, the room could not be cleaned and I had to wait. I went to Junting for dinner and felt at home. Thank you to the female manager. The service was warm and gentle, and the dishes were exquisite. I liked it very much

Beijing in April is suddenly warm but then cold. The wind in Tiananmen Square is still a little bit cool. But the warm-hearted actions of Wang Yanyan, Ning Songqian and Shi Xiaoming at the hotel front desk made me feel warmer.
Because I was on a business trip to Beijing, I chose to stay at the Capital Hotel for the convenience of transportation. On the first day I checked in, I felt the polite reception at the front desk. It made me feel that they are really attentive to service. They will pay attention to your every need and patiently answer every question for you. a doubt
On the second day of my stay, an urgent document was sent from the headquarters of the American company at around 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. I had no place to print it out. I was so anxious that I had no choice but to give it a try. I approached the front desk Wang Yanyan, Ning Songgan, and Shi Xiaoming for help. I didn't expect that they were anxious about what I was worried about. What I wanted was that they helped me solve my problem in a very short time. Their help and support meant a lot to me. The front desk sent me a thank you. Maybe it's more than just a simple thank you that can be expressed. I believe that all goodwill will turn into beautiful memories that accompany us every day of life. The thoughtful and caring people at the front desk will definitely bring a good mood to every guest.

The room is clean and sanitary, and the courtyard is in Chinese style, with a very old Beijing flavor and a sense of history and culture. It is worthy of being an old five-star hotel.

msg:A very satisfying stay. Although it is state-owned, the service is worthy of the five-star standard. When checking in at the front desk, the staff Liu Jia took the initiative to upgrade the room type, which gave the guests a good first impression. The room is quite spacious and has a wide view. The housekeeping is very timely and clean. Even if you check out on the last day, they still clean it in the morning.

The overall environment of the hotel is also very good. There are several small gardens imitating the palace, pavilions and towers, where guests can take a walk in the morning or evening. The hotel is fully equipped and has many restaurants with different flavors. Although breakfast is not included, you can enjoy beer or coffee in designated restaurants every day.

The hotel is located in the center of Beijing, only about 1 km away from Tiananmen Square, and Wangfujing, Dashilan and other scenic spots are also close at hand.

msg:1. The hygiene is poor. I feel that the cleaning lady is very confused. 2. Breakfast costs 80 yuan for adults, which is too average and not as delicious as the breakfast shop opposite. 3. If you don’t change the bath products every day, they are really useless on the third night. I called and asked for them, but they were given a bunch of them. 4. Before checking out, I found bugs crawling on the bed. I was really speechless. 5. Towels, it is clearly written on the brand, they must be thrown into the bathtub before they are replaced. In general hotels, as long as the towels are not neatly arranged, it means that the guests have used them, and they will definitely be replaced with new ones. The towels are all gray and are being disinfected and reused over and over again. Dear friends who want to stay here, please consider it.

There are armed police on duty at the intersection. The family walked back to the hotel at midnight. The children ran a long way ahead without worrying. The price is very suitable during the Spring Festival. The small hotel booked in Qianmen during the Dragon Boat Festival last year was much more expensive. The beer and coffee were good. By the way, I also had supper and lunch in the western restaurant. The sausage tasted good. I walked a few steps to Ziguang Garden to eat some special dishes. The yogurt was delicious. In short, for visiting nearby attractions, this place is highly recommended, but I didn’t encounter upgraded room types. Maybe I arrived a little late?

Two cups of coffee are provided every day, which tastes good.

The Capital Hotel was built after the founding of New China and has always been a government reception hotel. It is built in the style of old Beijing and has a very convenient location. It is located in Dongjiaomin Lane and is a 10-minute walk from Tiananmen Square.

Overlooking the thousand-year-old Beijing,
Downstairs are the former sites of embassies of various countries.
A fusion of ancient and modern.

In addition to the lack of soundproofing, the children were running in the corridor, and the rooms next to them were not very soundproofed.

The hotel is specially equipped with children's tableware at the dining table, so that accompanying children can also try the self-service experience...

The location of the hotel is very convenient. Whether you are going to the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square or Wangfujing and other scenic spots, you can reach it on foot.
The surrounding transportation is also very convenient. The subway and bus are very convenient for travel.
In fact, the safety in the city center is very guaranteed. Due to the hotel's geographical location, there are many security posts. It is safe for parents and children to travel and it is very quiet at night. The children did not suffer from insomnia at all.

The hotel facilities are relatively old, but the comprehensive location, service, and price are still relatively good. I am very satisfied. 👍 Taking the elderly to travel is for peace of mind and reliability. I think the Capital Hotel is still very cost-effective. Yes, the buffet breakfast is also very rich. There are two buffet restaurants in the hotel where you can eat. I have a full breakfast every day. I have also recommended it to my friends👍
It is worth mentioning that eating near the hotel is also very convenient. I had three dinners near the hotel during this trip. I was very satisfied with the meals at Ziguangyuan, Dongsi Minfang and Meizhou Dongpo😀

2. The appearance and garden design of the hotel are very high-end, with fountains and waterfalls, which are very beautiful.
3. The facilities in the guest rooms are slightly outdated, there are few intelligent facilities, and the sound insulation effect of the rooms is average.
4. The coupons given in the room are not actually discounted, and the mineral water that comes with it comes in different sizes, which I feel is not worthy of the actual price.
5. There are many kinds of breakfast, combining Chinese and Western food, so you can eat well.
6. It seems that you can hear KTV singing at night until the early morning, which is incomprehensible.

The price is quite cheap, it's relatively centrally located in the capital, and it's a five-star hotel. I booked it for 2 days. The appearance is quite good, very stylish, and the service is also very good. I would like to give special praise to a young lady named Peng and an old aunt in the room service. They are very enthusiastic. Seeing that we have children, they also brought several bottles of pure water to them. us. What I want to complain about is that the room is quite old and the door cannot be opened even for 2 days. The guy at the front desk even came to give us the room card. The facilities really can't be made up by the service. It's all thanks to these service staff. Without them, this hotel would have been given 1 star.

The front desk receptionist was polite and considerate. I called the front desk one day in advance to inform the front desk that I needed to put the bed together and add a quilt. It was already 9pm when I arrived at the hotel. The check-in process at the front desk was very fast. The receptionist informed me that the bed had been put together and extra quilts had been added, which was reassuring. Comfortable.
The room is spacious and has a welcome fruit plate. The view outside the window of Room 1423 can see the Zhengyang Gate and the red flag of the Great Hall of the People.
In terms of facilities, except for the small shower water, everything else is pretty good.
The location is great, you can walk to the Temple of Heaven and Tiananmen Square. There is Zizhuyuan nearby and not far from Wangfujing. It’s convenient to order takeout when you’re tired from walking
The hotel breakfast has a little less variety, but it is enough. I recommend the noodle stall. Bolognese noodles and pork ribs noodles are both good.
In short, it is worth recommending!

The facilities in the room are relatively old, there are no sockets at the bedside, and it is not particularly convenient to turn off the lights at night. There is a bathtub in the bathroom, and it is not safe to stand in the bathtub to take a bath. What I find most incredible is that there are no children's supplies in such a hotel? Or are children’s items not available in the standard room I’m staying in? The free soda is a drawback, it doesn't taste good and affects the experience. Disposable toiletries are too low-end, not as good as those from a hotel. Those who iron clothes have an ironing board and an electric iron, which most people are not very good at using 😂
There are two traffic lights from Tiananmen Square and the subway station. It is neither close nor far. It is recommended to ride a bicycle when bringing children. There is nothing to eat nearby because it is near Tiananmen Square.

Service: It was after one o'clock in the morning when we arrived. As a five-star hotel, doesn't the concierge provide 24-hour service? I have stayed in so many high-star hotels. When I entered, there was no concierge and the taxi driver brought me suitcases (one large and one small dragging 24-inch suitcases). I found the front desk by myself. The person who received me should be the lobby manager after reporting it. After checking in, he sent us all the way to the room and was kind enough to upgrade to a family suite.

Next time I go to Beijing, I probably won't stay here again.

I believe in Feng Shui very much, so I was given the third-to-last room, and there were advertisements outside the room window. There were also many black unknown rooms outside the room window, and the windows were dark. It was almost facing our window, so we didn’t dare to open the curtains at night. I originally thought that the name Capital Hotel would be particularly loud, but I didn’t expect the check-in experience to be so bad. I spent 800 yuan to buy it.

2. The lobby is very grand, the hotel covers a large area and has a garden corridor.
3. The doorman service is very good.
4. We live on the 10th floor of Block A. The room is about 38-40 square meters, which is quite spacious. The corridor is very quiet. Only by swiping the card can you go to the floor you live in, which is very safe. 5. The hotel buffet breakfast is rich in categories.

Disadvantages: 1. The sound of the air conditioner is quite loud, and it is also obvious when sleeping at night.
2. The shower water in 1024 flows out in a lump, which should be broken. The water in the shower was leaking from the cracks and the toilet floor was overflowing with water.
3. The supplies of daily necessities are not timely. For example, my mother's soap is gone, and I have to call the front desk to deliver it.
4. The phone at 1023 was broken, and when I called the main station, I heard a buzzing noise.
5. The momentum of the toilet is relatively weak.
6. There is no main light in the room, only corridor light, bedside light, typhoon, floor lamp. A little darker.
7. The windows are fully sealed, semi-floor windows.
The above is the real experience of staying in two rooms for five nights. After all, the price of summer vacation is also very expensive, but the hotel has been renovated for a long time and the facilities are relatively backward. All in all, I feel that the price is still on the high side.

There are various scenic spots when you go out, and the tourist bus to the Great Wall is also nearby, especially late at night, when the crowds have dispersed, and you are riding around the Forbidden City with your daughter. I am tired from riding. , you can go back to the hotel, really comfortable, of course, the facilities are a bit old, after all, it was a state guesthouse in the 1980s. But I didn't come to Beijing to stay in a hotel. I am very satisfied, it will be more perfect if the price can be within 1000. If you are traveling as a couple, or traveling with older children, this is the first choice, because the old city of Beijing is really suitable for cycling! If you are taking the elderly or younger children, you cannot use bicycles. That's a little more troublesome, because walking in the old city of Beijing is also a bit tiring. Taxi traffic is also often regulated.

I arranged for the Tiananmen Gate Tower on the last day, and I just took a mobile phone and rode there. It was very convenient, and I didn’t need to store anything. After I came out, I walked out through the east gate of Taimiao (Workers’ Cultural Palace), and then went through the alley to Wangfujing for dinner. The time was just now good. Living in downtown Beijing, I think cycling is the most convenient, and there are many new and many shared bicycles. I suspect that all new bicycles have been shipped to Beijing.

Great! There is a small surprise, in fact, there is a small swimming pool open to the residents, those who want to go swimming can bring their swimsuits! The small wontons in duck soup at the breakfast buffet are worth eating. After staying for four days and three nights, the breakfast is refreshed every day, and it tastes good! To focus, the biggest advantage of this hotel is that there are check-in points nearby. You can visit Tiananmen Square, Railway Museum, Qianmen Street... In short, it is a hotel worth recommending!

msg:The disadvantages are very large and numerous:
1. The service attitude needs to be improved. When refunding the deposit, you have to ask the guest if he has drunk his water. One day, the attitude of the staff who swiped the card for breakfast was very bad, with a bad expression on his face. With this attitude, can you still rate five stars? The review of star hotels by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism should really be strengthened;
2. As a five-star hotel, takeaways cannot be delivered to the door (don’t use safety reasons as an excuse, you can refer to the takeaway robot business of many express hotels under the same level of five-star and Huazhu Club in Wuhan. I can only say that you are stubborn and do not want to make progress! );
3. The breakfast is poor, not even comparable to the buffet breakfast I had in a chain hotel in a third-tier city. Although there are bright files, they are very poorly done! It is the worst Ming stall I have ever eaten! It's hard for you that the wontons are so unpalatable. The old man's legs and feet are inconvenient, and I can only let them eat in the hotel, so as not to have to go out to eat, so I have to eat this terrible breakfast every morning during the four-night stay, which makes me very unhappy every morning 😅;
4. The WI-FI is poor, and you have to reconnect every time;
5. There is no welcome fruit, which is very annoying. The hotels in Beijing have really been spoiled by the influx of tourists in recent years, and sooner or later they will be rectified.

Of course, there are also advantages:
1. The doorman opens the door to carry luggage, but this is a must for a five-star hotel, so there is no big surprise;
2. The space of the deluxe room is still very ample, and the scenery is also very good, you can overlook the lights of Tiananmen Square buildings;
3. The geographical location is superior, and there are many delicious foods in the surrounding area.

In summary, quite satisfactory, not very satisfied. Come back next time, add money to live in an international chain.

I am tired in the afternoon and want to go back to the hotel at 4-5 o'clock, but I don't want to go back, because I don't go back until 6 o'clock for the decoration.

The room type is large and comfortable, the facilities are perfect, the service staff is excellent, the geographical environment is excellent, and the hotel is green. All these can't hide the fact that I really sleep in a big construction site.

msg:I booked this hotel because of its location, because the hotel is relatively old, and I am worried that the inside will be old. The result was completely unexpected after checking in. First of all, the room is much larger than some other Internet celebrity hotels at the same price. Secondly, the service level is worthy of five stars. The outdoor environment can be used as a scenic spot. Children like it very much. A very satisfactory stay.

msg:Compared with the hotels near Tiananmen Square before, I think this hotel will be more reliable in terms of security, after all, it is an old five-star hotel. The overall check-in experience is not bad, very quiet, without the noise of regular hotels. It's a good choice here if you are afraid of noise. It is only 1.5 kilometers to Tiananmen Square. It's quite convenient to walk by bike. The only thing I am very dissatisfied with is that when I checked in for two days and extended my stay, I informed the front desk twice a day in advance, and the front desk only emphasized that it was not yet time. I can't go through the formalities of continuing my stay. Wait until this afternoon but said there is no room. Blame me for not renewing my stay online, they only placed an order online. Very speechless😒 was forced to find a hotel nearby. If you want to continue your stay or place an order online. Otherwise it will affect the whole trip, annoyed🔥

The courtyard landscape is very beautiful, and the service staff is very friendly! Luggage can be stored both before check-in and after check-out! The interior is clean and tidy. Futons are refreshing. Stayed for 2 nights and the room was cleaned every day. I have also stayed in other hotels, and I didn’t clean them when I came back from going out, and I didn’t add used cleaning products! As expected of the capital, haha! When the children grow up and go to the Forbidden City, they will choose the Capital Hotel! No photos of the interior, really nice! 👍

msg:This is my first negative review on platforms like Ctrip or Taobao. I really feel it is not as good as a budget hotel. The specific check-in experience is as follows: 1. It is not recommended to choose this hotel with children and elders: there is a bathtub under the shower in the bathroom. The bathtub has stains and yellow stains and cannot be used; you can only use the shower while standing on the bathtub. After taking a bath It is necessary to "carry" the bathtub to get out. The elderly and children are prone to falling. This is the first time I encountered this kind of bathroom. I only took a bath once and never dared to use it again. I only took a shower once in 4 nights. It’s better to book an express hotel. At least I can take a shower every day. 2. The female service staff at the front desk had a cold attitude. When we discussed whether to upgrade, the answer was that we need to add 200 yuan per night to upgrade. On Ctrip, the hotel has a picture of a bathtub under the bathroom, but I didn't see it and ignored it. 3. The location is between two subway stations. It takes at least 10 minutes to walk here every time you take the subway. You also need to take a bus or walk for a while to go back to the hotel from the front door. I really feel that it is not as good as staying in Wangfujing or Qianmen, at least there is a subway. Yeah, don’t bother too much

msg:It was the first time for me to bring my parents and children to Beijing, so my mind exploded after studying the strategy of accommodation, and finally chose the Capital Hotel. The first time you come to Beijing’s Tiananmen Square Forbidden City, you must check in. Then you find that many attractions are nearby. I found an interesting thing. The price of the express hotel is similar to the price of the old five-star hotel, but the express hotels of the same room type basically have no windows. Although the room type is closer to the subway, it is more convenient to travel, but finally gave up. The facilities of the old five-star hotel are more complete. The landscaping of the Capital Hotel is remarkable, full of Suzhou garden style. The lobby is antique and magnificent, but the swimming pool is a bit small and the facilities are a bit crude. Building B is close to the road. The tennis court is on the north side of the fifth floor, and the privacy is not good. Although the rooms on the south side face the road, they are farther away and better than those on the north side. To be honest, the room is really average. The star hotel mainly relies on supporting facilities. I stayed for five nights in a row. The back door can go directly to Dongjiaomin Lane, and then walk to Tiananmen Square for ten minutes. I didn't expect to have to swipe my ID card everywhere near Tiananmen Square. Sure enough, it is the center of the imperial capital, with strict security. Although it is not so free and easy, it is still safe. Resident parking is not free, 2 yuan for 15 minutes, half price at night. This time, Beijing only took the subway once in five days and five nights. If passengers have a strong demand for subway transportation, we recommend hotels within 300 meters near the subway entrance, because Beijing’s scenic spots are too wasteful and require extremely high physical strength every day, especially After playing the scenic spot, it is really too far to walk a hundred meters.

What I liked at the beginning was its good location. It takes 12 minutes to walk to Chongwenmen Station of the subway, and about 10 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square. It's so close, it's not too convenient.
After staying for a few days, to be honest, I didn't want to leave. The room is quite large, with a reasonable layout, very quiet, quiet in the midst of prosperity, suitable for the elderly and children.
Recommended, I will stay here next time I come to Beijing!

After learning about it, Zhao Jiangtao, the service staff, was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to help me deliver the things to the room, which made people feel warm and friendly. The cleaning staff are also very enthusiastic and helpful.
Hygiene: Very clean, I brought a disposable four-piece set myself, but after seeing the clean, tidy and fluffy bedding in the hotel, I didn't use it. Sleep quality is guaranteed.
Facilities: Because it is old, it is indeed a bit old, but it is fully functional, which is ok for me. The family suite in Block B has a relatively large space, and the south-facing room receives sunlight every day. The deluxe room is also quite big, but the bathroom facilities feel older than those in Block B.
Environment: The natural environment is very good. But there is a KTV downstairs, some people sing karaoke after 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, which affects the rest, hope to improve.

I had no choice but to walk back, especially when I was stuck in traffic all the way back to the hotel at night.
Facilities: Old hotel, the hotel breakfast is really musty than the corridor, but the rest is fine; there is a lot of external light at night, and the curtains are not very well connected after being closed, and it is easy for light to leak;
Hygiene: Room cleaning is considered clean;
Environment: The surrounding area is constantly under control and cars cannot get in. It takes half an hour to walk back to the hotel after a day of shopping.
Service: 1. I chose a twin room when I booked a room in advance, but I was given a personal bed without any explanation. (It’s not a king-size bed, so I couldn’t sleep well for two nights with my child; there are notes, but for the first time I didn’t read the customer notes at all.
2. I was planning to extend my second reservation, but when I finally got informed that there was no twin room available, I canceled it decisively;

msg:I have stayed in so many hotels, and they all give me five-star reviews! But this hotel is really not recommended. To be honest, this hotel is just like a fast hotel. The room facilities are very old, which is understandable. However, the overall service of the hotel is extremely uncomfortable and poor. The hotel is good or bad. Very important, I really don’t recommend it!

msg:It's very good and the service is satisfactory. It's very close to Tiananmen, Wangfujing, Dashilan and Zhengyangmen when you go out. The facilities in the house are okay. Although it's not very gorgeous, it's okay. It's very comfortable to live in. Let's talk about the pillows It's quite a lot, but it's too high and bulging. The buckwheat husks we asked for later, the staff were very kind to us, arranging check-in in advance, giving us change, and bringing us water! The front desk staff are pretty good-looking, the aunt who delivers the water is also enthusiastic, my mother had a great time, and the price is very cheap at this location, everything is expensive in the big capital, and there is a refrigerator in the room, so you can refrigerate things that you can't eat the first day! It's convenient to go out. Go to Beijing Railway Station and go all the way to Chongwenmen to take the subway. We took the No. 9 bus at the gate and changed to 412 to Chaoyang Station. The transportation is convenient! The external environment of the hotel is also very good, with a yard and its own garden! Next time I go to Beijing, I will stay here again. Thank you Ctrip for providing such convenient conditions! It's really Ctrip in hand and just go!

msg:On weekends, parents and children take their children to watch the flag raising. Visit the National Museum and listen to the Lantern Festival concert at the National Grand Theatre. I deliberately chose the Capital Hotel which is far away from the branch line of Tiananmen Square. Riding a shared bicycle on Qianmen Street, the experience is full.
Capital Hotel is an old brand hotel. It is hard to imagine that the architectural elements and furnishings of the 1980s and 1990s are still used cleanly and tidyly in the 21st century. Let those born in the 1980s who had no chance to experience the texture of the 1980s re-experience that good time after a few years.
I especially like the pair of sofas and standing lamps in the room. There is a proletarian unpretentiousness. After a tiring day of travel, I returned to this house. Feel the comfort, cleanliness, peace and tranquility of home.
Last but not least, the most important. Sincere thanks to the two beauties Zhang Haijing and Wang Yanyan. Their service is warm, sincere and caring. Makes you feel at home. And enthusiastically helped me use WeChat to make an appoin**ent for the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square. Because of their excellent service. I experienced the enthusiasm of Beijing and stayed one night longer than planned. A very good memory and experience. Thanks again.

msg:The old-fashioned 5-star hotel is focused on location and safety. The distance to Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People, and the National Museum is relatively short compared to other hotels. Because of the control near Tiananmen Square, even after getting off by taxi, the walking distance is shorter than that of the Capital Hotel. Attractions are far away.
Then there is safety. When traveling with children, safety must be considered. The special location of the Capital Hotel has police and armed police at the entrance and intersection, so it is very safe.
The hotel facilities are the previous five-star package, which cannot be compared with the emerging smart hotels, but the cleanliness can make me ignore its facilities.
The reception at the front desk is very professional, and the check-in is very simple and fast. The cleaning sister is very enthusiastic. The room is cleaned every day. Towels, sheets, and quilts are also changed every day. It is very clean. The staff in the breakfast area are very diligent. Disposable alcohol wipes and chopsticks are prepared for each table. The staff will clean up immediately after the meal, and will confidently help us with milk and coffee. This must be praised.
Not to mention breakfast, the buffet breakfast changes every day, and you can eat different salads, hot dishes, bread and juice every day after staying for 5 days. I went downstairs to have breakfast at 9:30 today. Every dish is served hot, which is not possible in many hotels.
It is very suitable for traveling with children to choose a hotel for accommodation.

It’s the first time I come to Beijing, and I am very yearning. It is also a hastily decided itinerary. My family prefers larger rooms and closer to the city. , a hotel with brand awareness. This successful journey, I felt the warmth and enthusiasm after the recovery. On the day I arrived at the hotel, because I had two pieces of luggage with me, the old and the young, the concierge at the door was very enthusiastic and proactive to help open the door and carry the luggage, because the early arrival The relationship helps to store luggage. The young lady who checked us in helped us check in very carefully. To my surprise, she gave me a very meaningful room number. Because I was still cleaning when I arrived early, she reminded us to store our luggage first. I originally booked a big bed. Temporary change and wanted to change the double bed, which was also solved for us, including after check-out, the lady at the front desk also reminded that the deposit will be credited within ten minutes. On the second day of check-in, we needed to clean and pressed the cleaning light. When we came back, we came back with a tidy and clean room and bathroom, as well as slippers for the children (although we brought our own shoes). The details are very heartwarming. The breakfast during the two days of stay was in place and in line with your appetite. This is a family trip in the post-epidemic era, and I saw and experienced thoughtful and warm service.

Go to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag raising. This is the best five-star hotel, no one! Originally, we only planned to stay for one night. Since the flag-raising the next day was not considered, we stayed for another night, raising the flag at 5:00 and getting up at 4:00 was enough. Many attractions are very close and can be reached by bicycle. Third, as an old five-star hotel, although the hotel facilities are relatively old, it is very well maintained and clean. In the end, the service of the waiters is still in place. highly recommended

I went out to play for a day that day, and at 9:30 I came back to the hotel and found that the room card was not available. I contacted the front desk and said the date was wrong, and asked me to contact Ctrip to modify the date. Ctrip, the hotel and me communicated with me for more than an hour to no avail. In the end, it said that there was no room. , ask us to take the room things away. 3 questions, 1. Even if I booked the room at the wrong time, why didn't the front desk remind me and updated the room card for me. If I said it at the time, I would rebook it. 2. If you want to check out for me, why don't you have a phone call for a day? The hotel is obliged to contact me, and all my belongings are still in the room. 3. If you don't check out, why did you tell me that there is no room, and whose name is this room still owned?

The epidemic prevention requires itinerary code, health kit, information registration, etc. We all cooperate with our work, after all, it is for everyone's health. Safety. Everyone knows that health treasures have one code per person, so we always carry the household registration book to the children. Besides, the children’s action trajectory while away from home must be the same as that of adults, but at the request of the lobby staff, we registered all the information for the child and showed the household register is not enough. The child must also show the health treasure. Under the guidance of, let the child be both information and face recognition. As a result, the health treasure prompted several times that one person and one code could not be entered. Even when our 2 year old little treasure was asleep, he actually asked us to wake up the child for facial recognition. Recognition 😡 I told him angrily that you didn't see that the health treasure can't be recorded? Dabao's face has been recognized three times. Could it be that Xiaobao can record it when he wakes up? Can't you understand the tips of one person, one code for health treasures? Finally, under the coordination of the front desk staff, we finally checked in at about one o'clock in the morning. As a result...the moment I opened the quilt in the room ⬇️Come and see what this is? How about giving away "pets" when staying at your hotel? Was disgusting instantly! Thanks to me, I pulled the quilt first when I entered the door. It would come out if I had already fallen asleep. 😡😡😡 Although the hotel immediately changed our room, the person in charge said that the hotel was deworming recently did not hold up. Besides, This tossing made us have zero points for the hotel’s service attitude and environmental sanitation. At the beginning, we chose this hotel mainly because of its location. Although it is an old five-star hotel and the decoration is old, we are all 👌, but the service is as well as Sanitation really shouldn’t be like this. The name of such a prime location and the Capital Hotel really doesn’t match your capital.

It will be deducted from the deposit after I check out. The current situation is that both the room fee and the deposit are collected. Double charges.

The hotel is a veteran five-star hotel with a quaint feel. There are complete facilities, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and rockery garden fountains. Each room in the hotel will give four free bottles of Nongfu Spring mineral water every day. If you don’t have enough, you can ask the waiter for it. The service is also very good, clean in time, and you can also delay check-out until two o’clock in the afternoon for free. It may be that the surrounding restaurants are relatively rich, which seems to be not very popular in the hotel. For breakfast, you can go to the Xisi buns across the road from the hotel. There are also pancakes and fruits for sale at 10 yuan each. Several nearby restaurants are quite delicious, such as Songhe Tower, Old Alley Restaurant, Kung De Lin Su restaurant, etc., which are very convenient. In a word, it is a very cost-effective hotel.

msg:Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, the location is very good, not far from the Metro Line 2 line. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Tiananmen Square, and the bus stop at the door can go directly to Dashilan. The small garden is beautiful. At present, the room facilities are relatively outdated, and are out of five stars. I feel that the sofa, bathroom, etc. really need to be improved. The room lighting is also relatively dim. This time it is more commendable that our two adults and two children, the children are relatively young, and also agree to a standard room for one room.

msg:One of the worst service experiences I've ever had in a hotel in Beijing. The air conditioner was not heating for a long time, and the humidifiers were both broken. Every time the hot water was turned on, it took more than 15 minutes to start heating. The service and maintenance personnel came in and out this night. The manager on duty has a good attitude, but there is no operation such as taking the initiative to send some fruit. It took a long time to ask for a late check-out the next day. After taking two baths, washing hands, etc., the water is hot for a long time. How can I count the wasted time? In the end, I finally agreed to a late check-out, and there were a lot of disclaimers on the phone, as if giving me the delay was a gift. Before leaving, I wanted to ask the front desk for a bottle of water and said no. Several front desk staff discussed for a long time and finally said that someone would send it over, but I had to wait five minutes. Should I let the special car wait for five minutes too? Other hotels will prepare water at the front desk for guests at any time, and the service concept needs to be improved. The special hotel for the two sessions is at this level. Is the designated hotel for the LD service a stumbling block for you to only serve the two sessions and not pay attention to the guests in other periods? It is the first time for users with all five-star reviews to give a negative review!

The hotel has a nice environment, with a sense of garden, the rooms are large, and the service is also OK. If you have any problems, you can quickly solve them by calling them. If you need them, they will be delivered in time. The facilities are average, relatively old but do not affect the use.
It takes a long time to check in, I don't know why, there is no queue, it is very slow.
In addition, the breakfast was not satisfied. All the dim sums were unpalatable. For two bowls of noodles a day, the noodles were ok.

Advantages: good location, high cost performance, convenient travel. The breakfast was quite satisfactory. The environment in the hotel is beautiful.
Here I would like to commend the concierge Sun Yu. One night I asked the concierge at the door whether there is glue or transparent glue. At that time, Sun Yu searched for a circle and couldn't find it. Then he called me to find a roll of double-sided tape and delivered it personally. room. Thank you very much for the service of this young man.
Insufficient: Some meals are insufficient for breakfast, and it is slow to add dishes. One day I saw the room cleaners brushing the toilet seat with the toilet. I just walked through the bathroom door and saw it because I didn't talk to the waiter when I was going out. Hope to improve!

msg:帶娃遊玩好環球后，準備次日去天安門廣場接受家庭式愛國主題教育，折中綜合考慮選擇了這家賓館。
出租車停靠首都賓館後，服務員標準化開車門及拿行李的動作就讓我覺得這家賓館不一般。因為前天北京莫名打雷下暴雨，前台主動關心了我們的行程還是比較貼心的。
房間佈局挺官方，猜想是接待領導幹部的原因吧。（建議與時俱進，遊客和領導接待房間還是區分下比較好，或者説部分房間裝修風格現代化點比較好）
因為孩子她媽一早趕飛機去深圳看周深演唱會，把我和女兒丟在賓館。前台服務員得知我不會幫小朋友扎辮子後，三位黨員前台姐姐主動幫助我。其中一名黨員姐姐將“為羣眾辦實事”的優良作風發揮到了極致，讓我感受到了家庭的温暖。其他兩位小姐姐拿着玩偶在哄我家小朋友，場面温馨程度讓我覺得非常貼心。日後帶老大來北京一定會再光顧北京首都賓館！

    我剛往前台走，剛走到大門和前臺中間位置處，前台外站着的那位男工作人員已經迎了上來，很熱情的説到：先生，我來幫你拿行李，並立馬接過我手中的行李箱，領我到前台工作人員處辦理入住。
     前台的另一位男工作人員態度也非常熱情，很快幫我辦理好了入住，並提醒了各項事宜。
     前台這2位男工作人員看到我帶了小孩，還差了小朋友一面國旗，挺貼心的。再次感謝10月3號中午前台的2位男工作人員（抱歉沒記名字）。


設施：酒店年限在這了，不新也不算舊。

衞生：沒發現衞生有啥問題。

環境：挺好的。主要位置很好，但相比人民大會堂賓館（現在大會堂賓館不太好訂）位置差了點。

2.酒店沒有清晰標識，兩棟樓來回。而且沒人跟你講
3.設施陳舊，而且房間沒有洗漱用品入住沒人説，電話前台要送來的阿姨都是面無表情
4.管理混亂，基本可以隨便進出，衹要有一人登記，其他人隨便進出沒人管。

msg:第一次來到北京，選擇入住北京首都賓館，非常愉快！
        酒店雖然歷史悠久，但內部大堂、房間等都非常乾淨整潔，空氣中有一股淡淡的香味，令人舒適。工作人員都非常地熱情有禮，服務周到。   
         在此，要特別感謝禮賓部的石仲瑾。由於我的粗心，離開賓館等車時，將一個小袋子遺忘在了大堂外的石凳上。電話賓館求助時，是石仲瑾第一時間到大堂外幫助尋找取回，並幫忙快遞到家。給添麻煩了！感謝感謝！
         為北京首都賓館點贊👍👍

2樓的中餐廳叫什麼“君”的中餐廳，差評，黑店的感覺，菜單上20%的菜都沒有，替換的菜比菜單的菜貴50。比如一個湘菜的炒土雞168元，點菜後説沒有，有其他的替換土雞，沒幾塊雞肉結賬時發現288。

2樓的日料店還不錯，雖貴，但菜品材料都是上乘，服務也不錯。

msg:房間：房間乾淨寬敞整潔，除了浴缸下水慢，馬桶式樣老，其他沒有“老舊”感覺，浴巾等也很新。酒店沒有小童牙具，帶娃的切忌自備。
地理位置：很方便。出行去天壇，天安門，王府井都比較方便。出酒店右邊走有前門地鐵站，左邊走有1號線和崇文門地鐵站。
服務及環境：酒店前台的姑娘們和房間服務員都很親切熱情，遇到住客提出需求，反應都很迅速。酒店幾個小花園也打理的很漂亮。泳池健身房比較小。每天贈送2瓶波子汽水，讓娃很歡樂。

這次旅行，想看升旗，不想坐車，就選了這家店。設施是比較陳舊的，但服務很專業，衞生條件良好，衞生間和布草都讓人放心。
地理位置騎車到故宮12分鐘，步行看升旗25分鐘（含數次安檢），地鐵站也不遠。
要重點講講早餐，6：30開始，種類十分豐富，中式的油條豆漿豆腐腦白切饅頭豆沙包煮蛋鹵蛋，豆豉蒸排骨麻辣魚肉小青菜，西式的麪包蛋糕咖啡紅茶牛奶酸奶，蔬菜沙拉，另外還有現煮的餛飩和粉絲，種類豐富，品質優良。

地理位置還不錯，離天壇2公里左右路程，離天安門1·5公里路程，來去比較方便。
説到服務，有點想吐槽。打掃衞生的阿姨可能年紀大，比較急，我們前三天因為有行程，所以較早出門，阿姨看到我們都會問房號並且馬上打掃，結果到了第四天，由於路途勞累，要睡懶覺了，八點半左右，阿姨卻主動敲門要來打掃，第一次，我們告知晚一些，第二次我和孩子下樓吃飯，老公還在房間，又説要上門打掃，我就跟阿姨明確表示待到我們全部出門後再打掃，結果，我們吃好早飯進入房間，發現已經打掃好了，可是喝茶的杯子並未清洗，且我們出門時需要清潔的垃圾也不能及時清理……感覺非常不好！
期間酒店裝修，早上八點半左右就走沖擊鑽的聲音了
酒店早飯希望可以有所改進

酒店地理位置還可以，幾個景點公交車都可以到達，離地鐵站稍微遠點。

msg:性價比很高啊，北京天安門廣場附近的地段，五星級酒店，和幾周後上海住的一比較，就覺得北京在這方面還是比上海好了不少，價格相對低，服務相對好，乾淨衞生，就是一直沒有搞明白為什麼空調關了還是一直很涼爽，很安靜地睡了六晚，極力推薦。就是攜程送機的太垃圾，説是免費多等30 分鐘，結果我晚到了十分鐘再打電話就聯繫不上了，從來沒有遇到這個情況，一開始還不好意思地又等了十來分鐘反覆打電話不通才取消，發現還是自己太善良了，估計司機就是故意不接電話，建議大家以後遇到這個情況就直接打滴滴，攜程送機極不講信用，非常垃圾！

1、因為一夜趕路+排隊、沒怎麼睡，加上天氣比較冷，看完升旗儀式後長者、孩子已經提不起精神來了。聯繫酒店説明這情況後詢問是否可以協調一間房先讓長者孩子休息一下，在這裏點贊👍前台服務人員，很快就幫助協調提前辦理了入住，非常感謝
2、老牌星級酒店了，各種設施方面透露的是“沉穩”氣息，但是還是很乾凈的。主要是離天安門廣場、故宮、王府井近

1. 原來圖安靜 入住的 B座。結果隔音實在太差了！一進屋沒多久 就聽到樓上大吵大鬧 甚至打架砸東西 持續了至少一兩個小時 小孩子被嚇到。致電前台也沒啥改善，也不知道到底哪裡傳出來的打架聲。出門時看到，跟我們同樓層的一位女士，可能幾間房都是他們一起定的 大門敞開着在吸煙，幾個小孩在那裡跑來跑去 折騰 沒人管，説好的無煙房呢？ 第二天看完升旗回來 酒店轟隆隆 一直在大聲砸牆，我們都是剛睡下去就被砸醒的，整個屋頂都在顫動。幾次跟酒店溝通，他們説為了趕進度，沒辦法 不能停。完全沒有考慮客人感受。最後唯一的解決辦法 就是讓我門收拾行李，換房。
換到A座後，沒想到更為噩夢。因為也在裝修。還是從早到晚 持續的那種"多多""咚咚"聲，讓人聽了更為難受，要持續到傍晚挺晚。
看裝潢 我相信他曾經輝煌過。但是現在不止硬件，服務也沒有跟上。很不好的體驗，我們正好是從希爾頓退房住過來的 一對比更明顯，以後應該不會再住了

住的其中有一天是孩子過生日，前台送了一個小生日蛋糕，這給遊客非常便利，外地遊客臨時買蛋糕聽不方便的。
也有行李寄存服務，最後一天可以寄存行李很方便。
硬件設施我不得不吐槽下，淋浴和浴缸在同一個地方，洗澡衹能站在浴缸裏面洗淋浴，空間小且地上比較容易弄濕，第二天晚上小孩洗完澡從浴缸下來時滑倒了，頭差點撞到浴缸，幸好他抓住了，不然不知道會怎麼樣。我在想萬一是腿腳不方便的長者住這個酒店洗澡怎麼辦呢？爬上爬下怪危險的。

整體來講，我如果專門來北京玩，大概率還會選這裏，訂個高級點的房間也許會感受更好。

2、距離天安門也很近，可以走過去；
提幾個建議：
1、房門鎖真的不好用；
2、早餐菜品種類少，住兩天就完全不想吃早餐了，可以考察學習一下同類五星級酒店；
3、一進門大廳大堂副理腳下那塊地毯影響酒店形象；

msg:去看天安門這個應該是最近的一個五星酒店了。幾年前去北京住的是北京飯店，印象裏很近的，本來想繼續訂北京飯店的，到了才發現記錯了。不過這可能就是緣分，首都賓館是老五星了，在訂的時候一直很糾結，會不會太老，環境、衞生什麼的跟不上，所以入住的時候先看了房間，整體還是不錯的，又靠着天安門，值得推薦。
在這裏要重點感謝下禮賓部的孫昱，由於最後一天火車在6點，所以下午去了趟恭王府。算準時間4點半出發去火車站，然而還是低估了北京的交通，這個時間緊湊合自己趕到火車站，肯定沒法再回酒店拿行李了😂。後面果斷的聯繫了酒店讓幫忙叫個車或者跑腿把行李送到火車站（之前從來沒有這麼操作過😅），事情發展到這裏後面都是孫昱小夥子幫的忙，叫車、聯繫司機、確定匯合位置，包括過程中兩方路程的進展，真的超級負責，要是沒有他的幫忙，我們指定趕不上火車了，在這裏再次感謝👍👍以後來北京，還是會選擇這個酒店❤️

酒店裡天安門廣場近在咫尺，一公里多適合步行。酒店早餐也還算豐富，總體物有所值。
