Our room was spacious, offering contemporary decor and luxurious comfort. The captivating city views added an extra touch of enchantment to our stay. The plush bedding and indulgent amenities ensured that we had a restful and rejuvenating night's sleep.

Little did we know that the Westin Guangzhou would exceed our expectations by surprising her with a magnificent birthday cake. The staff arranged the cake with utmost care and consideration, reflecting the hotel's commitment to creating memorable experiences for their guests.

Every encounter with the hotel staff was nothing short of outstanding. They were attentive, responsive, and always ready to go the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. The Westin Guangzhou's dedication to customer service is truly commendable.

The Westin Guangzhou's prime location truly adds to its appeal. Situated in the heart of the city, it provides convenient access to numerous tourist attractions, shopping destinations, and vibrant nightlife. Whether we wanted to explore the local culture or unwind in luxury, the hotel's convenient location had us covered.

In conclusion, our stay at The Westin Guangzhou was an exceptional experience. The hotel exceeded our expectations with its elegant surroundings, impeccable service, and genuine care for its guests. The surprise birthday cake was the cherry on top, leaving us touched and grateful for the hotel's thoughtfulness. If you are looking for a remarkable hotel that combines luxury, comfort, and warm hospitality, The Westin Guangzhou is an excellent choice. We look forward to returning soon for another unforgettable stay.

msg:I recently stayed at The Westin Hotel for three nights and overall had a pleasant experience.

Location:
The hotel is in a great location, close to a train station and several shopping malls, making it easy to get around. However, be aware that the traffic in the area can be quite bad at times.

Cleanliness and Amenities:
The hotel itself is very clean, and the amenities are top-notch. The facilities provided were excellent and enhanced the comfort of my stay.

Overall Impression:
Despite the traffic issues, the hotel‚Äôs proximity to public transport and shopping centers made my stay convenient and enjoyable. The staff was professional and attentive, adding to the positive experience.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in the area.

When I thanked her upon my leaving , she said anyone at the front desk would do the same thing. What an answer and what a culture! The breakfast was delicious and the 50% buffet dinner is a must have. Do yourself a favour and use Westin as your base in Guangzhou.

Another thing that I don‚Äôt like is they set the aircon to only 23deg, which at midnight it seem to be hot. You not able to to down the temperature further. Location to metro, 5min walk

To hotel Next time, please set your aircon 21deg.

Room was clean with large and comfortable bed.
Pretty nice view by day and by night.
Conditioner bottle was empty and there was only one bathrobe instead of 2 for a couple booking.

Breakfast buffet has multiple options, although the coffee is pretty bad for an international well-known chain and dim-sum selection quite basic and not exciting for Guangzhou.
Staff is very nice, both waitresses/waiters & cook.

Dinner at the Chinese restaurant was good, professional and caring staff. Adjusted dish according to our allergies. Highly recommend the pork on crispy/souffl√© rice.

Swimming pool staff is a bit unprofessional, 2 young men joked about having or not a girlfriend when I was at the counter, thinking I don‚Äôt understand what they say.
Also I asked if the sauna could be turned on and warmed up while we were at the pool as it was totally off and cold when we arrived at the pool, but when we went back to the changing room it was still off so we left.
One good point, we didn‚Äôt have a swimming cap and the staff landed us some.

The hotel is pretty busy, but I dont have to wait long to check in and out. I'd recommend it as a home when uou are away from yours.

msg:was a good experience as always by the Westin, and bonvoy members.. the hotel location is very close to tianhe shopping belt. 
the room is excellent-but I think the basic things nowadays is to have built in usb port in the room. I didn't bring mine because I expect every hotel room should have it.. nevertheless,  the helpdesk officer Ms Mickey was very helpful and asked room service to deliver usb support connector in due time. 
The amenities such as gym and pool is great, but I can't fathom as I have stayed at other city hotels that don't have problem requirement to wear swim cap in the pool, I caught unaware and can't do my swim here. 
btw,  as finishing touches..  pls put some sofas near the waiting area at reception lobby. all else is great.

msg:The location and the environment is very good. The staff I met were all extremely hospitable. Their English level was far better than other hotels I have stayed at in Guangzhou. I would also like to thank Kevin who helped me borrow a portable phone charger when I couldn't because it's only available to Chinese guests.

The room was clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable and clean. It was a large spacious room with a comfortable atmosphere. The TV was not very good, the picture was fuzzy and the sound delayed. There was some cockroach dirt on the floor so perhaps a more thorough cleaning is needed.

Food - I ordered room service of pasta and steak. I would recommend the steak but not the pasta. The food was delivered quickly. The breakfast buffet was ok. I felt like the pastries were not very fresh. Also I wanted to try some noodles and Cheung fun but I waited for 30 minutes before anyone showed up to make them. I wouldn't have the breakfast again if I stayed here again.

The pool - The outdoor pool was a good temperature. Unfortunately it was very dirty. There were guests spitting in the pool and none of the staff said anything. There was dirt rolling around on the bottom of the pool. The signs said no photos but people were taking photos. The changing room was also very dirty. There were no more shower shoes available and the floor was full of hair. They also ran out of lockers. The shower was also dirty and the plug blocked with hair, it has a bad smell. 

I wanted to go swimming the next morning hoping that it would have been cleaned overnight, but unfortunately there was still dirt on the bottom of the pool (I could see this from many floors above). How often does it get cleaned?

I don't think I would stay here again.

msg:I‚Äôve given the Westin a lower cleanliness rating not because it wasn‚Äôt clean but because the air in the room smelt strongly of mold spores. It‚Äôs not uncommon in southern China but they should have it under control by now. I did actually try to ignore it but after ten minutes trying to do some work, I had to change room. This was managed well but it did take a while, and very clearly, they used some form of air freshener to mask the smell in the next room. Actually it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the previous room. I suspected the net curtains needed a wash too in the first room. 

Other than that, the in room food served was good, and service was excellent.

The indoor pool is nice and perfect temperature, though the jacuzzi on the second day was not hot enough. The sauna is really good too, and I liked the hot and cold pools inside the shower area. I haven't given a perfect score on amenities and cleanliness as there is definitely a scope of improvement in the seating space around the indoor pool and cleanliness of the pool! But I'd definitely like to visit again during summer months to experience the outdoor pool too!

msg:In terms of hygiene, the pillow smelled sour, and the facilities seemed to be from the last century and were very old. Only one side of the bedside of the king-size bed room could be charged, and there were no waterproof slippers for bathing. I don't know how the hotel staff was trained to be unfriendly to Mandarin guests (maybe they are unfriendly to everyone). When I returned to the hotel in the early morning, I wanted to see my room card. I didn't do anything to the foreigners who were traveling with me. The discrimination was quite serious. The hotel staff was lazy. When I landed on a pile of luggage, I would never help without opening my mouth. I just stood there bending over and playing with my phone. Is this worthy of being called a star hotel? I asked the concierge to help send a courier upstairs for half an hour, but it was not delivered. When I went downstairs to take it myself, I saw him playing with his phone. I shouted loudly in Mandarin that he ignored me. I repeated it two or three times before I got the courier. When I checked out, I asked if the mini bar was charged. They asked me what I drank. I asked the front desk if I didn't mention the money, and they told me that it was like this, and they didn't mention it, and then they still took my money. This Guangzhou transit experience was extremely poor. From the facilities and hygiene to the service, I couldn't see any advantages. The worst hotel I have ever stayed in is HNA Westin!

2. The service is in place. Call the front desk and the hotel staff will help with takeout, water delivery and other services. They also respond quickly in the early morning.
3. The environment is good, and all bath towels are replaced every day.

I need to mention it again. I like the surrounding cleaning products with white tea flavor. I will choose Westin next time.

The hotel environment is very good, the location is also very good, it is convenient to travel, and take-out is convenient. It is close to Linhe West Road subway station. You can take your children to experience the APM line. Because it is the first station, it is easy to sit at the front and rear of the train. There are outdoor and indoor swimming pools and gyms on the 7th floor of the hotel. I took my children to swim for a while, and the children liked it very much. The hotel breakfast is also very rich, with a full range of Chinese and Western food. Then the guest room environment is also OK. The aunt will also help fold clothes seriously. After going out to play, the aunt will help fold a few clothes that have not been put away and put them in their original place. It's really great. Then on the last night, I don't know what happened. I broke a glass cup, and there was no compensation. The deposit was quickly returned after checking out. In short, it is very wise to choose HNA Westin for this trip to Guangzhou! Very satisfied!

I really have to praise the swimming pool, both indoors and outdoors. What makes me most happy is that the water temperature of the indoor constant temperature swimming pool is really good. I have been to many other five-star hotels with constant temperature swimming pools before, but the water is still cold. I have to use the indoor swimming pool. There is also a hot water massage pool next to it, and there are separate cold pools and hot pools in the locker room.
The only drawback for me may be that the hotel is relatively old and does not have a smart toilet. Furthermore, the central air conditioner does not seem to have warm air. When the warm air is turned on, the air is still cold.
But overall, it is still highly recommended. The stay experience this time was very good!

The room is large, but the lighting is too dim. Especially the lights in the corridor, it's the same as not turning on. There is no ventilation in the room, not at all. I thought I would just stay for one night, and I didn't report it to the hotel.
It's very convenient to eat and go shopping around, and it only takes about 20 minutes to walk. You can also take APM directly to Guangzhou Tower, which only takes a few minutes.
Next time, I will choose to stay here again.

3) The music player is just a decoration. It can only play CDs, listen to radio stations and serve as an alarm clock. It doesn‚Äôt even have Bluetooth. It should have been replaced a long time ago.

msg:I took the initiative to review. I need to go to Guangzhou on New Year's Eve. Because the higher the Ctrip membership level is, the more points you get. When choosing a hotel, I found that the Westin can use Ctrip points to redeem cash. After a quick trial, I booked a luxurious king bed. After the deduction, it cost about 400 yuan. .
I checked in at around 7pm, and all the staff were very warm and polite. The guy on duty at the front desk still thoughtfully provided me with a free room upgrade. I thought it was just a simple upgrade to a room with a view, but I didn't expect that I was directly upgraded to an executive suite! I'm really surprised. In this location, this brand, this service, this room type, 400 per night is a free price, hahaha. The room is clean and tidy, with a good view and plenty of hot water. The air conditioner can also be very warm during this season.
The breakfast reservation at the front desk is 100 per person, and the on-site reservation is 188. If you need breakfast, you can order it in advance. The quality of the breakfast is quite average. It is recommended to go early. Although it is the first day of the Chinese New Year, when you get down around 9:30, you need to queue at the entrance and wait for your number to be called before you can enter. In addition, there is a lion dance activity on the first day of the ***** New Year, which creates a strong New Year atmosphere.

When entering, an old customer reminded me that I need to keep watering for the steam to heat up. I poured 5 buckets of water in the whole process and it was still barely enough. Feeling weak, an old customer came in and said this was good, as it wasn't hot at all the past few days. The New Year's Eve dinner is also a dinner for two people. Only the two main dishes of roasted suckling pig and shrimp cost more than 800. We were given an extra charge of more than 900. Fortunately, we checked carefully and asked for boiled water. They said it was for one person under 18. It was really too much. ‚Ä¶

msg:First of all, breakfast repeats the same barbecue set meal every day, roasted potatoes, roasted sweet potatoes, roasted pumpkin, roasted tomatoes, roasted mushrooms, roasted chicken, sizzling rice cakes...
Hmm...it's pretty good, but don't bake it next time. They all got angry.
There was a fried fish steak on the first day, but I never saw it again. The service staff at the breakfast table were all nice and smiling, which made me happy during the Chinese New Year.
It's okay to stay for a day or two for breakfast, but if you stay there for a long time, there are many morning teas around, not barbecue. Except for the first two days, the porridge is made from the rice from the previous day. This morning I also saw fried scallion rolls.
The toppings at the noodle stall seem to be rationed every day, so it‚Äôs better to go early to eat noodles. Yesterday, very early in the morning, only tomato and egg toppings were left.
Except for the first two days, the breakfast every day is almost the same. Maybe the chef is on vacation during the Spring Festival? Are you going to set up a barbecue stall to make extra money?
I took out the used towels from the towel basket in the guest room and folded them for guests to use. The first time I didn‚Äôt have any evidence and didn‚Äôt say anything. The second time I touched the toothpaste and it was white when it dried. When I came back in the evening and dried it, it was bright. They didn't admit it until it was hanging there and replaced it with a new one.
The manager refunded the children's breakfast fee when checking out. He also expressed his apology and hoped that things could really be improved. The hotel's facilities have become obsolete over time, but it does not mean that it has dropped its star rating. Renovate quickly, Guangdong and Hainan have been renovated.
The hotel's shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, etc. are all in large barrels. I don't like it, so I still feel uneasy about using the canned ones. The cost of small packaging may be a little higher, but you can use it with confidence.
As for the fruits, they have almost remained the same for seven days, with the occasional mango. The salad section doesn't even have cucumber slices sometimes. The noodle stalls are all hot pot meatballs.
I hope the hotel can return to its five-star standard. After all, the Tianhe Stadium area is still very convenient for frequent stays.

However, this time the leader suddenly fell ill and couldn't walk. He needed to be sent back to Hong Kong for medical trea**ent urgently. He asked the hotel to borrow a wheelchair and pushed it to the waiting car in front of the door. Considering that he needed to It was difficult to walk through the border inspection and customs. I asked the hotel whether I could rent it, leave a deposit or buy it... but all were rejected... Some people say that HNA Westin is just HNA, not Westin. It seems true. As a frequent visitor, I am deeply disappointed and heartbroken this time...

It is a very ordinary five-star hotel breakfast, not rich, and there are too many people, queuing up, the experience is very poor, like a vegetable market, eating a lonely. I canceled breakfast the next morning and went downstairs for morning tea instead. Third, there are two children's playgrounds where children can simply play. Fourth, it is not worth it for the room rate in the early 1000s. Five-star hotels can be better. There is no view in the room, and the swimming pool has no special features. The coach does not allow you to touch anything. He bluntly said that you can only touch the floating board if you have registered for swimming lessons. You don't feel any service from a five-star hotel at all. I will not choose this Westin next time.

The hotel is well insulated and will not be disturbed at all. Check-in and check-out are very fast, there is a shopping mall around, and there are Line 3 and APM Line, which fully satisfy the curiosity of children. Surrounded by office buildings, not noisy, the check-in experience is great, and I will choose Westin again when I go to Guangzhou in the future

msg:After struggling for a month, I finally chose this hotel after reading the reviews. Facts have proved that the importance of reading reviews is full of hotel details. Someone will help you open the door and take your luggage as soon as you get off the car. There are many hotels with the same star rating You can't do it. There are staff members who will guide you to check in when you enter the door. Xiao Chen at the front desk is very proactive and enthusiastic. He helped arrange a room on a high floor. The executive floor on the 38th floor is very close to the children's playground on the top floor. It is super convenient. The hotel also pays special attention to Ctrip. User, so booking a hotel with Ctrip feels very secure. I am especially grateful to Xiao Chen for his service. He greets you with a smile all the way and responds to your needs. Every time you stay in a hotel, the first contact you make is the front desk, so I can predict your future experience. Sure enough, after entering the room, my son liked it very much, and even clamored for me to stay for a few more days. This is the second hotel my son said he wanted to stay in more than the Disney Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are very large, and we prepared carefully The welcome drink and fruit are included, which is very different from the overpriced Panda Hotel I stayed in a few days ago! The welcome drink is very attentive. It is the fruit juice that children like. The hotel is not far from the subway. It is very convenient to go to Beijing Road, Canton Tower and the airport. There are convenience stores around the hotel. When I returned to the hotel at night, I was given fruit and snacks. My son just returned I was clamoring to eat macarons, and I ate the hotel's macarons at night, and they tasted very good, like ice cream, and I fell asleep very quietly at night. There was an eye mask in the room, which was very considerate. Breakfast the next day, Although it is not particularly rich, but there is everything that should be there. A staff member came to ask the children how the food was, so I said, I didn‚Äôt see the donuts, and then the lady immediately helped me to the back kitchen to ask if there were any. , After about 10 minutes, I took a few donuts for my son. The children are very happy. It would be great if we could add some small cakes. The children's playground on the 40th floor of the hotel can be said to be quite big, and there are even You can wear anti-skid socks, so this hotel is really detailed. The children had a great time. Although the hotel has been open for a few years, it is well maintained, and the details and services of the hotel are beyond many hotels of the same level , After check-out, the hotel also has a special return visit, which shows the importance it attaches to service! A service-oriented hotel can always let guests feel the sincerity and dedication of the hotel, so next time you go to Guangzhou, this is definitely the best choice

The room is clean, the sound insulation is very good, and the hardware facilities are good. The breakfast is rich, and there are many varieties of Cantonese-style morning tea. At the same time, there are not enough Western-style varieties, which is understandable.
In particular, I would like to praise Larry at the front desk, who told him about my poor sleep, helped me upgrade the room and found me a very quiet room, and helped me put a small bottle of sleep aid essential oil near the bed when I returned to the room in the afternoon , the lavender smell is very intimate.

msg:The hotel room service is very good, the breakfast is also very good, and the food around the room is okay. Only the individual service at the 2-story buffet in the evening was substandard. Among the several main dishes, you have to queue up for kebabs and barbecues, especially the person who is responsible for the barbecue. Everything is slow. A group of people are waiting, but only a few slices are put in each time. The grill pan is two-thirds empty. This person still cares about the beef. Only two slices were cut per person, and my friend who was traveling with me saw the size of the cuts and said he wanted six slices, so he didn't have to queue up again. When I asked for 6 slices, I cut the third slice. Unexpectedly, after hearing this, the meat cutter actually stacked the three slices together and cut them into 6 small slices. At that time, my friend said that if he could speak Chinese, he would just curse me. I think it was contracted out and the boss refused to give it in order to reduce costs, but the napkin on the table had Westin printed on it. Later, a thin woman, probably a female manager, came and stood by to stare at this person. After ten minutes, we didn't have to wait in line. Everyone has their own preferences for various dishes and can and cannot eat them. The buffet itself is very tasteless in this way. The three of us just don't eat shrimps and crabs and prefer meat, so we didn't ask for the hairy crabs that were given to each of us. It would be easier to eat a few slices of beef in portions instead of just ordering the set meal from the buffet.

Ordering takeout and waiting for it to be delivered is already cold. Others will use robots to deliver it. The room type is really old, and the price of 1,600 for two nights comes with nothing, and the service is also very poor. After saying that I live by myself, I still ask men if they need to register... It's rubbish. I won't come back again. The service is very poor. I don't get anything I want. The phones are from hundreds of years ago and the curtains are still manual. The lighting control is also very poor, and the scenery is not much visible. It was said that there was a window but the window could not be opened, but the aunt was very nice and folded the clothes very well. The location is okay, relatively downtown. But the service and facilities are really poor and poor. Will not be returning.

The facilities are a bit dated, but are kept quite clean. At 1,200+ per day, the hotel is not cheap. I stayed there for two days and had no special impression. The kind that makes no mistakes.

Also, why does Ctrip require a deposit now? The room charge for two days was 2,400+, the security deposit was 2,400+, and the hotel deposit was 1,000, totaling almost 6,000. And the security deposit was not refunded until I checked out. I paid the room fee when I checked in. Why wasn't the security deposit refunded? If everyone is like this, Ctrip's income from the deposit will be quite considerable.

If the iPad hadn't been put on it, the "missing" surface of the table would not have been noticed. Breakfast is added when you go to the front desk to check in, so adding breakfast on site is cheaper than on the Ctrip APP. There are also Chinese and Western styles for breakfast. The only downside is that some fruits can‚Äôt even be cut with a knife, so I dare not put them in my mouth to chew, otherwise it will not only hurt my gums, but even if I bite them into pieces, it will be difficult to be swallowed by stomach acid.

Not only is the location close to Metro Line 3 + Guangzhou East Station in Tianhebei, which makes the transportation very convenient, but more importantly, the room is comfortable, and the hotel staff are friendly, enthusiastic, and considerate! And when I checked in this time, Chen Anduin at the front desk helped me upgrade my room. When I checked in, I felt that the software and hardware are worthy of Westin's international brand! At the same time, there are many places to eat, relax and shop nearby.

Environment: The traffic is fairly convenient, but the road at the entrance is currently undergoing major repairs, making it noisy and dirty.
Service: Check-in and check-out at the front desk are very fast, but the affinity needs to be improved. The concierge and luggage service is not in place. The young lady called several times before answering, and the luggage was not delivered to the room in time.
Pros: The room size is quite spacious, the view from high floors is better, and the bedding is more comfortable, but the linen in the bathroom is a bit flimsy and not as good as the standard of a five-star hotel.

2. The service is perfect. The staff in the lobby will take the initiative to say hello almost every time. This kind of enthusiasm is very comfortable.
3. The parent-child center is clean and hygienic. It is only open until 8 pm. If you go late, you will understand and let your children play for a while

Bad:
1. The category and quality of breakfast is debatable. The experience of eating a single product is not high, and the replenishment of meals is slow. There are even scenes of a large group of people queuing up for meals during peak periods

msg:We arrived at the hotel to check in at 4:30. At this time, the front desk Yami told us that none of the rooms had been cleaned up, 6. Then she explained that it was because of the delayed check-out during the Spring Festival, and the cleaning was slow. It felt to me that the hotel was like a **, not able to make promises and shifting responsibilities. Then I asked what compensation could be given to us? Yami said to send a piece of fruit, not a buddy, you send a piece of fruit for five rooms, don't be too ridiculous. I don't know why you are also slow in handling other check-in related procedures, are you trying to delay time? Then Bryan came out to save the situation and said that each room would be given two breakfasts, which I thought was acceptable.
Then I bought a milk tea and came back. Grace greeted me at 6 o'clock (I didn't expect that I remembered everyone's name). She said that none of the rooms had been cleaned up. I got angry again and said that the efficiency should not be too low. The final result of the negotiation was to upgrade the room, which was fine. But Grace's attitude was very impatient and sarcastic throughout the whole process. She kept saying that it had nothing to do with her that the sanitation staff hadn't cleaned up. Hey, are you from the hotel or am I from the hotel? You two are on the same boat, can you please be more careful? Then she told me that there were still three rooms left (we booked five rooms, and at that time, I was given a room at 6:00 after the one at 4:30). And when I said four rooms, hey, I meant that I would book four rooms in total tonight, okay? Anyway, it was like she was implying that I was not clear-headed, but what else could I do except being mad at you? Hmm.
After the spa, I went to the front desk at 7 o'clock. At this time, I could book a room. Yami opened the first room type for me when she saw me. I realized at a glance that she was fooling me, and then I felt that my nerves that had just relaxed "rubbed" and tightened again. I said, "Didn't we negotiate to upgrade the room type in the afternoon?" Then she started to change it for me. **Sister Yami, you won't turn back until you hit the wall. You have to wait for me to watch you every step of the way, otherwise you will fool me beautifully, right? Am I a young person who is easy to fool? But you never thought that I have already joined the law firm. Today I am fighting for my rights. Will you continue to fool me tomorrow when it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs turn?
Then my sister said that the upgraded room type has not been cleaned up yet. I said that you can‚Äôt clean up three rooms in one hour (the time I have a spa treatment)! ! ! ! ! Maybe it was at this time that Yami realized that I was really not a pushover, and summoned Bryan to back him up. It was just a simple operation.
(Too long to save the flow): Yami likes to fool around, Grace likes to be weird, and Bryan is simple, decisive and has a good attitude (bro apologizes to you. He was very aggressive in the afternoon and shouldn‚Äôt have transferred the anger of the hotel to you when you didn‚Äôt make any mistakes. I hope you don‚Äôt mind). That‚Äôs it! I hope everyone can speak up for their rights!

The location of the hotel is a bright spot, and other facilities and services are also in line with five-star hotels. It's a pity that the residents in the neighbor's room went out very late to cheer up and came back without thinking about other people going to sleep.

msg:The hotel service is very good, except for the double-standard pool staff. We went to the hotel pool at night and saw that the hotel staff taught children to swim in the pool without swimming caps, so we thought that swimming caps were not required to enter the pool. As a result, the staff member who didn't wear a swimming cap asked us to leave the pool as soon as we entered the pool. Later we asked him why he could not wear a swimming cap, he said he would (?????) We watched by the pool for 5 minutes, and he still didn't wear a swimming cap to teach children to swim. The truth is that I have a new understanding of the Westin Hotel

The shower head leaked, the big shower head above my head also leaked, and the water pipes also leaked. It dripped into the floor drain. It was so loud that I called the front desk late at night and told me to find someone to fix it. It took more than half an hour to fix it. In the end, I had to remove the floor drain piece to stop the leaking sound. That's one thing. The second point is that the toiletries are extremely simple. There are only two pairs of toothbrushes in the room. There are no combs, shower caps, cotton swabs or any other things. It wasn‚Äôt until I checked out the next day and asked the front desk that I was told that I could collect them at the front desk. So you don‚Äôt Will you remind me when checking in? Do you still have to wait for me to discover it myself? I came to your hotel to hunt for treasures, right? The third point is that the toilet and shower room are very small, and there is no place to access your belongings. The sockets are only on one side of the bed, and charging is also very inconvenient. All in all, the experience was extremely bad, couldn't be worse, and it also worsened my impression of Guangzhou.

The restaurant is not big, but the food you eat is not suitable for a hotel of this level. About 10 days after I left the hotel, the hotel contacted Ctrip and asked me if I could give my phone number to the Public Security Bureau to verify my situation. Because I had a 15-year-old son with me, I needed to report to the police to verify whether my relationship with my child was true. It was a rubbish hotel. If you are really so responsible, shouldn't you report it directly to the police on the day you move in? So many days have passed before you reported it, and you contacted me personally to ask for advice on whether the office could be safe. Is it really too late for something to happen?

I didn't order breakfast at first, but because the hotel cooperated with Ctrip, breakfast was provided. The variety is also relatively rich;
The hotel is close to East Railway Station, about ten minutes walk from East Railway Station, and less than ten minutes from Linhexi, so the traffic is more convenient;
The facilities are indeed a bit old. I feel that the thermostat of the air conditioner is a bit broken, but it does not affect the condition of the air conditioner. Others are fine.

The pre-authorized deposit needs to be refunded 48 hours after check-out, and many hotels will deposit it on the same day. Also, the room fee is 3,000, the deposit is 3,000, and the pre-authorization fee is 6,000... I don‚Äôt know what the standard is. Maybe the hotel‚Äôs items are limited, so they are very expensive...

msg:I generally don't write online reviews unless the service is particularly good or the experience is particularly bad. Unfortunately, Westin falls into the latter category. If it wasn't the lowest score of 1 point, I wouldn't even give it 1 point. When I made the reservation, because I was a Ctrip member and had room upgrade rights, I called a few days in advance. The lady on the line said I wasn't sure and that I needed to apply with the manager? ? ? Do I still need to apply for the rights that I already have? After staying for two nights, there was no call from the hotel to ask about my experience. Apart from a few bottles of mineral water, there were no other gifts in the room. Maybe I booked it in advance and the room price hadn't increased so I didn't deserve it. The equipment was poorly maintained and the toilet leaked. It was very cold in Guangzhou during the Spring Festival. The hotel probably didn't even have heating due to cost considerations? ? ? Last but not least, as a tea drinking place in Guangzhou, I asked for tea sets to be provided, but the receptionist actually told me that the hotel did not provide tea sets? Do you want me to use the water cup in the room or the drinking cup to make tea? Are you kidding me? ? ? In short, there will be no next time. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the 4.7 rating.

Check in was quick and not too much waiting. I booked a twin room on the 12th floor, the view from the window is average, the ordinary street view. The room is clean and tidy, there is no peculiar smell, the decoration style is low-key and solemn, the furniture and electrical appliances are relatively new and not old, but the bathroom is average, the area is small, the shower room and toilet space are small, a bit oppressive, the glass sliding door is in the shower It can only cover one side, and the glass is not stable enough and a little swaying, so be careful to push it. The gym and outdoor indoor swimming pool are all on the 7th floor. The area is large enough and the water quality is very good. There is also an Italian restaurant and a children's indoor amu*****t park on the 40th floor of the top floor, which is suitable for bringing children to live. It's like fire, so I can only have fun in the hotel!

The hotel's epidemic prevention measures are very good. The health code will be checked when entering and exiting. The hotel staff are also very professional. The lobby manager Bryan enthusiastically also offered extra breakfast. The food and beverage products are slightly higher than other hotels.

The service is also very good. I hope I will pay attention next time. Too many hotels owned by Marriott or similar, this is the first time we have encountered this situation.

The concierge's terry greeted warmly and helped press the elevator. I was very satisfied with this trip! !

When I was about to go out for dinner, Cindy at the door introduced me to Guangzhou‚Äôs special food, and recommended us to Guangzhou Restaurant. I felt that the food in Guangzhou was really delicious, but the weather was too hot and it was only suitable for two days.

The guest room was transformed into a parent-child room, and building blocks were also given away, so the children had fun. The room service staff helped us retrieve our ID cards and toys, which must be liked.

The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is large in size and there are many choices. There are two children‚Äôs pools and a standard swimming pool with an indoor constant temperature. There are also outdoor pools that take into account both deep and shallow waters.

The parent-child club on the 40th floor is very popular with children and linger. ü§£ü§£

msg:I think Westin is a more suitable hotel for business travel. This is the first time I have chosen to stay at this hotel in Guangzhou. Undoubtedly, I think that it is less than 900 to be able to stay in an executive room, and the price-quality ratio in Tianhe District is relatively high.

Lobby: The welcome service is in place, and the first impression is not lost. The lobby is right in front of the gate, and there are people coming and going in the hotel, but there are not many people checking in, and the queue is about 3 minutes. It was about 1 o'clock when I arrived at the store, and the room needed to be cleaned for an hour, so I had to go to the Hongmian Chinese Restaurant on the fourth floor for dinner.

Chinese restaurant: Located on the fourth floor of the hotel, I did not expect the occupancy rate to be as high as 80%, which made me have higher expectations for the hotel's products. Ordered a suckling pig platter and nine-layer pagoda prawn dudu chicken pot. I think the dishes are scored 8 points. No matter the taste and presentation, there are no surprises, but they are up to the standard. There was an episode in service. I called the waiter to come and order. Maybe the little girl was not familiar with the business and looked at me blankly, a bit embarrassed.

Rooms: Arranged on the 32nd floor, not far from the elevator, and the occupancy density is not very high. After all, the hotel has been in operation for some years, and the facilities and hardware have slightly lost a lot of time. The advantages and disadvantages, let's add it at last.

Executive Lounge: The lounge is located on the 39th floor, with a simple decoration and warm lighting. The dishes and service are really good, kind and polite. Perhaps it should be the reason for the weekend, the occupancy rate is as high as 90%, and the dining area is also crowded. The point is that the standard of drinks and meals is good. I also went to the executive lounge for breakfast the next day, maybe it was close to 10 o'clock, and the environment was much more comfortable and less noisy.

bonus:
1) The air-conditioning in the room is great, which is the key to my whole staying mood.
2) The soundproofing of the room is excellent, except for the cleaning staff next door.
3) JBL Bluetooth speaker, you can play some light music.
4) The water pressure in the bath and bathtub is stable to the temperature.

Minus items:
1) The room details are not cleaned in place, and there are small stickers next to the wardrobe.
2) The bedside lamp (left) is broken.
3) The hair dryer was broken and replaced later.
4) The lights in the room are equivalent to one-key full-off, except for corridor lights and bathroom lights. I think the room lighting can be switched on and off selectively in two stages and three stages.
5) The occupancy rate of the executive lounge is too high, it is not much different from the ordinary room type, and there is no very relaxing dining area.
6) When checking in, I didn't tell the room that the service could be delayed until two o'clock. (The room type should include)

Summarize:
I think it is a business hotel with high cost performance. If it is a tourist or honeymoon, it is not recommended to stay at this hotel. It is not ruled out that you will stay next time, and I hope that the hardware facilities will be improved.

The restaurant on the fourth floor has low cost performance, and the pickled fish is not fresh. In short, I'm sorry for the corresponding room rate. There are too many five-star hotels in Guangzhou that are better than here. Sorry to tell the truth, I hope to improve.

msg:This check-in experience was extremely poor. It was raining on the day of check-in, and everyone was wet. There were many staff members standing in the lobby, but none of them helped. They were soaked from head to toe. I asked the front desk for a piece of paper and ran for a long time, but there was nothing.
I want a higher floor, so I replied no directly, and then insisted that I want to live on a higher floor, and gave it to the 30th floor, hey
There is an executive lounge on the 39th floor, and the front desk said it was a good idea. The concierge swiped the card to go up, and told the waiter inside that he came up to experience it. I felt all kinds of distrust. I called two or three times to confirm, and I felt very bad.
There are many small flying insects in the room, so I won't come next time
