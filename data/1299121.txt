msg:This is a nice hotel that has a great location. I stayed for two nights on a weekend just to get away and there was plenty to see within waking distance. You’re next to a mall, McDonald’s and KFC as well as a garden, a park and a temple. The front desk was very courteous, as a foreigner I had to use my translator to communicate, but they helped me out and made it a very pleasant stay. Breakfast was provided which was a buffet, mainly Chinese dishes, but also had fried eggs, cereal, toast and a few western items. The room was very clean and amenities were provided. I would highly recommend this hotel!

msg:The location is very good, next to Qiyuan Commercial Street and RT-Mart, and it is within walking distance from the scenic spot. The view outside the window is also great, you can see the sunrise. Although the hotel facilities are old, it is cost-effective.
Disadvantages:
The water in the bathtub was green on the first day. The staff said that it might be full and the water consumption was high, so they put more water in. Although I don’t know why, the water returned to normal on the second day.
Breakfast is only until 9 o’clock, and it costs 38 yuan for children over 1.2 meters tall. The order of holiday breakfast is a bit chaotic, and the categories are not complete. The Qiyuan pancake next to it on the second day is more fragrant, but the breakfast coupon cannot be refunded, nor can it be deducted from the extra children’s breakfast on the first day.
There are no separate children’s products.
When checking out, the staff said that it is OK to give the card directly, and did not ask to verify the bill, and deducted the money directly.

I checked in at 6 or 7 in the evening, and when I went to the room, the door was wide open!! The front desk said that the previous guest checked out late. But isn't it 12 o'clock here? Oh, maybe they paid extra and left late.
Toothpaste products need to be charged, which is clearly stated on the packaging bag. Maybe shower gel and shampoo are also charged, but it is not clearly stated. When the fee was deducted, there was one more dollar than when the room was booked, which should be this.

Haiyan Hotel is a time-honored local hotel

Environment: Qiyuan, RT-Mart Supermarket, Xinhua Bookstore, Apple Mobile Service Store, Beauty Shop, Ruixing, Cinema

Service: There are many payment methods, such as the service provided by ICBC, and the payment port of foreign bank cards

Service: Provide local specialties and souvenirs, but no sea salt, 🤣

Note: Do not buy too many non-sea salt or Jiaxing products. It is better to stay in Haiyan for a few more days.
Note: I did not see a card selling "traffic union". People in Haiyan are very wealthy, and every family has a house and a car (the housing price is cheap!) There is wind power generation in this place, maybe it is suitable for solar energy. There are fewer oil trucks and taxis, and the fare is more expensive.

It is said that it is because the new energy license plate cannot be entered... I booked for two nights, and on the second night I was very tired when I returned to the hotel, but the room card I can't get in... I called the room depar**ent with a perfunctory attitude, and a female employee surnamed Zhu reluctantly came over, as if it was our own problem that I couldn't get in...

The service attitude of the male service staff at the front desk is too bad, and the tone is blunt. It doesn’t matter if you don’t let the take-out delivery to the room, it doesn’t matter if there is no waiter to deliver it. We don’t have this service. You can get it at the front desk yourself. Say, bad review!

msg:The hotel I booked on Ctrip.com, Building B, was priced at 271 yuan per room with breakfast for two. I thought a five-star hotel was so cheap, so I just stayed there for one night. I didn't expect that there was no heating and air conditioning, and we were freezing all night. It was shocking that Haiyan Hotel, which is next to the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, was cut off from electricity. The cold air was coming south, and the hotel didn't provide heating in such cold weather. Shouldn't you indicate this on Ctrip? ! There are reasons for being cheap, and I should be mentally prepared to see if I can bear it. The stewed buns are not good. I booked a room online for 271 yuan, but they deducted 282 yuan from me. What kind of operation is this?

msg:The experience is very poor. As a representative of Haiyan Hotel, it affects the image of Haiyan. 1 Personnel literacy is not professional. Ctrip placed an order for the family parent-child room reservation, but there is no order information when I arrive at the store, and the room type is full. The front desk staff judged that the employee had not registered the order and check-in was blocked. Later, we still proposed to upgrade the room to break the deadlock, otherwise the front desk, including the manager who came from behind, didn't know if they didn't want to or could not come up with a solution. 2The facilities are poor and the personnel management is not in place. The upgraded room is an executive sea-view suite. The entire room was powered off at about 7:30 in the evening. The process of contacting the front desk and the hotel staff to resolve it was very annoying. After we called the front desk for the first time, we waited in the dark for 10 minutes and no one came up. After the second phone call, someone came up. After a few minutes, a cleaning lady came up. The first sentence was a question. Did we use a kettle to boil water, saying that the water was too full and the power was cut off. The words were accusing us. Then we looked around, looked at the entire room, and didn’t even know where the electric box was. After asking, let’s take a look what's the situation. We contacted the front desk for the third time to express our dissatisfaction, and asked for professional maintenance personnel to solve it. In the past 10 minutes or so, no one came. I contacted the front desk for the fourth time. The front desk kept saying that it was there. Children aged 4 and 7 were constantly asking when there was electricity. A few minutes later, an electrician and a female manager appeared. At this time, it had been half an hour since the power outage, and our patience was exhausted. As soon as the electrician arrived, he immediately pushed the switch and called, presuming that the safety post should be unattended, and the temporary notice was late. The female manager-like staff also said the same thing, saying that the water in the kettle was too full and the power was cut off. Not only did it fail to reassure, but it was also very controversial. We believe that the kettle did not boil water when the power was cut off. Second, if the hotel has long known the hidden danger of the kettle, why not replace it. It identifies a luxury hotel, but the kettle used is so easy to cause a power failure. Kettle is not a rare item. We still have common sense in using it, and it will not be too full. Let's take a step back and say that our home and other hotels have the same habit of using kettles. We have never encountered a power failure. Minor power outage problems cannot be solved in a timely and effective manner. There are hidden dangers in emergency response and safety management. The lack of basic communication skills and service attitudes when communicating with residents is the posture of “the guest’s fault, let’s hurry up”, luxurious We believe that this type of hotel is extremely incompatible with such facility configuration and personnel management. To sum up, the two incidents are things that are unlikely to be encountered by hotels. Haiyan Hotel has done it. It destroys the guests' travel mood and lowers the image of Haiyan city. It is very powerful. We will also respond to relevant issues to the Haiyan County Market Supervision Bureau and the Culture, Broadcasting and Tourism Bureau.

During the epidemic, the opening hours of the gym were 18-21. When the time came, I asked the staff that the gym was not open, and they didn’t know that the notice was posted at the entrance. Then they inquired about each other, and finally told me that it was not open. I didn’t mean to apologize at all during the whole process, I just told me after asking... I ordered a pot of tea in the lobby bar. Maybe the lobby bar was not handed over at the end of get off work. When I left, I told the front desk to leave the room account, but the staff actually asked How much am I... the quality of the staff should really be improved
