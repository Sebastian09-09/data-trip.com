msg:This stay at this hotel was a special experience. When I checked in, I met a new front desk employee named Annie. Although I could feel that she was not very skilled in her job, her attention to the guests was particularly heartwarming. I remember that when I asked for some information about the surrounding areas, she was a little unfamiliar but she looked up the information very seriously and introduced it to me carefully, with a kind smile all the time. Although it took some time, her sincerity and efforts made me not impatient at all. She also kindly reminded me of some precautions, which made me feel valued. Although she was a new employee, her attitude towards guests was really great.

I booked a basic room during the 51 holiday, which was cheaper than some express hotels. I didn't expect much, but the front desk unexpectedly upgraded my room to the executive floor, which made the three-day experience perfect. The cleaning lady also helped us fold clothes and make the bed. It can be said that the hardware, environment, landscape and service are impeccable.

When I come to Chengdu in the future, I will give priority to Millennium!

Seeing that I took the children to the room, they took the initiative to send a set of children's products. What impressed me most was that I accidentally locked myself out of the room, but the children were still in the room. I was very anxious at the time and contacted the front desk. They responded positively and acted quickly. Anna at the front desk comforted me not to worry and arranged for relevant personnel to rush to deal with it. Soon the staff successfully opened the door for me and solved my problem.
From this little thing, it can be seen that they really attach great importance to the problems of guests, and they are not perfunctory or shirking. This attitude and professionalism of actively helping guests to deal with problems make me feel particularly at ease and happy to stay here. I believe that with such an excellent front desk service team, this hotel will definitely develop better and better. If I have the opportunity next time, I will definitely choose this hotel again.

What is even more impressive is that Manager Yu always maintained patience and smile during the explanation. No matter how trivial the questions we asked were, she always patiently answered them until we fully understood them. This service attitude not only made us feel her professionalism, but also made us realize her love for work and respect for guests.

The first impression is that the front desk staff is friendly, the environment is quiet, and the transportation is convenient. The facilities are a bit old, but the bed is very comfortable. This time I came to Chengdu to attend a conference for work reasons, and the conference happened to be held in this hotel. As soon as I arrived at the front desk, I saw my colleague who was attending the conference talking to the staff at the front desk of the hotel. I said hello and asked about it. It turned out to be him. I left my cell phone and clothes in the restaurant when I went out to eat. Now I have no way to contact the outside. I am using the front desk phone to contact the restaurant. The front desk staff Xiao Zhao responded very positively and helped us with suggestions. I quickly found the phone and clothes. Manager Shen, the manager on duty, also helped my colleague pay for the flash delivery of clothes. Finally, with the help of the two of them, he successfully got his phone back. While waiting, I chatted with the two of them for a while. Both of them are from the north, they have very forthright and enthusiastic personalities, and their words are also very humorous. This experience gave me a better impression of this hotel. As an old five-star hotel, the price is affordable, and the staff is serious and responsible and enthusiastic about guests. This is rare. I hope to work harder in the future and the business will be better. The better come!

I hope the little sister won't catch a cold after returning, so my friend especially asked me to comment and thank her! Like!

After explaining my situation to the front desk, I was worried that the company would pay for the next day, which would involve changing rooms and other troubles. After Xiao Xiao at the front desk understood what I meant, she said that there were differences in room types, but the differences were not big, so my room could remain unchanged. Then the children learned that they had a constant temperature swimming pool and clamored to go play in the water. The swimming pool was constant temperature and the temperature was suitable. There were also few people. Their swimming pool was semi-open-air, and the water was reflected on the glass at night, which was very beautiful. In addition, their gym is open 24 hours a day and is very friendly to guests staying in the hotel. The atrium design of the hotel is also a major check-in point.

I believe that under her leadership, the service level of your hotel will definitely be improved. I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to her again!

msg:This hotel has a high-end building, low-key and restrained interior, complete facilities and equipment, and careful selection of materials and design. It is located between the South Second Ring Road and the 2.5th Ring Road, next to Metro Line 5 and Line 7, 25 minutes' drive from Shuangliu Airport, 10 minutes' drive from the city, and convenient transportation. The surrounding area is full of residential areas, greenery, and the environment is very good and quiet. Because it is a living area, the surrounding supporting facilities are very complete. There are all kinds of restaurants around the hotel, and the taste is pretty good after trying several of them. The hotel is warm and simple in style, the hygiene is up to standard, the staff is enthusiastic, and Manager Wei is especially good. He does things neatly and gives people a proper experience. I like it. In addition, the hotel's gym is also very good, with an indoor heated swimming pool. Go swimming and exercise in this weather, and the experience is full. You must try it. There are some calligraphy and paintings, art photos on the floor, and the cultural a**osphere is strong. The room is clean and tidy, with air conditioning and hot water. I have only these few requirements for staying in the room, as long as it can meet the standards, there are no other requirements. There is no problem with the room in this hotel. The hotel room price is not high. Looking at the area in the south of Chengdu, it is one of the most cost-effective hotels. Overall, it is a very good hotel and worth staying in!

msg:I feel like it was a very bad experience. First of all, as a five-star hotel, no one helped me carry my luggage. I had to move it myself from beginning to end, and the security guard didn't even provide a luggage trolley. We booked a standard twin bed, but the story started as soon as we walked in. There were not even rotten oranges on the floor cleaned (pictured)
I changed to a room on the 14th floor, but it turned out that there was a workshop opposite, and it was very noisy with the door opening and closing all the time, the kind of door slamming with emotion. The children were frightened and cried. I changed rooms again the next day, and I was exhausted from changing rooms continuously.
The service in the breakfast room is also very poor, and the sanitary conditions are also very poor. You can read other negative reviews. I personally tested it and stayed there for four days, and they are all true.
In addition, many problems occurred, and the male manager on the day shift couldn't solve anything at all. It wasn't until Manager Liu on the night shift came to work at 4 p.m. that they were solved again. The experience was very bad. I will not stay in this hotel again and do not recommend it. Then if there are other hotel colleagues, they can poach Manager Liu. You can feel that there is only one person in the whole hotel working hard to coordinate the customers' demands, but the person who works hard does not have authority. It’s also outrageous.

When we checked in, we wanted a quiet room on the side. The little brother said that there are no more rooms on the side now, only the middle room with a garden view, so we gave us a free upgrade. I saw so many people checking in just now. , We also expressed our understanding, but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the room next to the street in the middle was also very quiet after arriving at the room, and the lighting and view of the garden view room were really good.

Hygiene: The shower room has mildew, because their windows are locked and closed for many years, and there is no ventilation, which is weird. . .
Environment: The environment is not bad, but the traffic is a bit out of the way.
Service: This is the only reason why I am willing to stay here. I am too lazy to pack my luggage after checking in, so I just live here. To be honest, the service can be scored 4 points, and the others are not good.
The room is not big, the bed is too narrow, the child fell down twice in the night, and the ear was scratched and bled. The hotel doesn't even have basic iodine. . .
Let’s talk about breakfast, I didn’t buy breakfast two days ago, I bought it alone, 138 people, I want to say, why do you have such a poor breakfast. . 38 is okay, right? There are no special types, which directly lowers the hotel grade. I only ate eggs, porridge and green vegetables and pumpkin, and the porridge was overcooked. . .


There is a door in the room, which can lead to the next room, and the suite is sold in two. . Fantastic design. .

Overall evaluation, the service is okay, and desserts are delivered every day. Nothing else works. . . In my opinion, it is not worth 400-600, and the house price is almost 300. Will not choose him again.

I arrived very late at night and went to check in. The receptionist's attitude was as if she owed her money. After cleaning the room, the toothbrushes were not repaired and the bath towels were not changed.

It is very convenient to work. It is surrounded by Shenxianshu Park and the environment is very comfortable. It is said to be the rich area of Chengdu. The facilities in the hotel itself are also good, the rooms are soundproofed and quiet, and the staff are very friendly. I was going to the airport early the next morning. The front desk staff took the initiative to book a car for me and praised it. The breakfast is rich and there are many Chengdu specialty snacks, which are very good; in short, it is a pleasant surprise, I should book it in the future, and recommend it!

msg:Thinking that my family would come to Chengdu for two or three days during the Dragon Boat Festival, I saw this hotel recommended on the homepage, thinking that I had also stayed at Millennium in Hangzhou, it should be okay, so I decided to try a big bed room first.
The location of the hotel is easy to find, there is a park opposite, and the air is not bad. The lobby is very delicate and the children are very interested in the moon made of flowers.
When I arrived at the front desk to check in, the younger brother at the front desk watched me with the child and asked if we wanted to upgrade to a parent-child room. The children would like it more, thinking it would be inexpensive, so he agreed.
The children in the room really like the panda-themed bed sheets. There are also three red panda toys and special toiletries for the children on the bed. They are very practical! Originally, we did not have bathrobes and slippers for my son when we went to other hotels, but when we opened the closet, we prepared a mini bathrobe and slippers for him, so that we would never worry about the yukata being too long and mopping the floor, and the slippers were too big. It's an awkward situation to wear.
The front desk learned that we were going to the panda base the next day, and told us that the hotel had a car to make an appoin**ent for pick-up. The panda base and Sanxingdui were 188 people. I continued for two more nights decisively and planned to go to Sanxingdui the next day.
My husband and children were very satisfied with this trip and decided to come to Chengdu next time and live in Millennium.

msg:Breakfast is 138 yuan per person... This is too expensive. At that time, the staff said 68 yuan per person. Maybe I got it wrong, or you may be wrong. 4-year-old children are also 68 yuan per person, which is unreasonable. I thought the deposit was deducted by mistake, and it turned out to be so.
