msg:The room itself was ok and clean. The bed was your average western hotel standard. The breakfast was disappointing due to the range of food offered and poor service. You needed to ask for basic things like a knife and fork.
Yuxi restaurant on the second floor should be avoid for health reasons.  METAL WIRE was found in the food. Extremely dangerous, I shall never eat there again. The service was slow and the dealing of the metal wire in the food was pathetic and didnt seem to be taken serious by the management of the hotel. I asked to speak to General Manager after the rude and incompetent staff failed to seriousness off the situation, smiling and in one case laughing about the situation. The night floor managers and executive floor manager tried to trick me by telling me that the Food and Beverage manager was the General manager. 22 hours after the showing the staff the wire in the food, the hotel sent the Food and Beverage manager, pretending to be the GM, and a marketing and sales person to give a non-sincere apology.  THE HILTON HOTEL GROUP NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE HOW METAL WIRE GOT INTO THE FOOD?, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT? AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS WITH ITS STAFF BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. (which the marketing guy and the food and beverage managers could not and would not answer ) ALSO THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT NEEDS  TRAINING IN CUSTOMER CARE/ SERVICE / COMMUNICATION SKILLS. It is sad when the new floor trainee was more sympathic than the rest of the management combined. I am still waiting to hear from the General Manager of the hotel. Save your money and your life and stay somewhere better and with better management and customer service. 

To the Hilton group, the managers and certain staff at this hotel are ruining your reputation, your business, and will end up seriously hurting someone, if not causing someone to die.

The best of all was that my daughter had a small accident and the hotel staff accompanied us to the nearest hospital and took care of our girl so well. Truly appreciated, especially since we as foreigners don’t speak Chinese. 

Conclusion: this is one of the better hotels that we stayed in in China.

msg:Staying in Hilton for a long time, the overall feeling is that the appearance is basically high-end, and the room is so-so. This one is the opposite. The appearance is ordinary, the lobby is small, but the room is very good. There are only 3 Hiltons in Zhejiang. I have stayed in Zhuji and this one. Let's compare them. Zhuji's appearance is very cool, the sky lobby is full of style, and the room and bedding are not too bad. This one is the opposite. Summarize the following points for your reference:
1. Cost-effectiveness and service: The price of this Hilton is really super cheap. I booked the cheapest comfortable king-size bed room for a casual one-night stay. The front desk directly upgraded me to a landscape room on the executive floor (46th floor) for free. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides. I was touched.
2. Bedding: Serta's mattress is moderately soft and hard, with a pair of goose down hard pillows and soft pillows. The four-piece set is better, but it is still insufficient compared with the Marriott series. I certainly can't compare with Westin, so I won't say it. Many of Marriott's use Simmons and a down comfort pad. My family uses King Koil, and I stay in Slumberland more often. To be honest, it is more comfortable than Hilton. In addition, Marriott's pillows are all incense, which Hilton can't compare with.
3. Room type: Very good, this is the invincible place, separate cloakroom, washroom, bathtub and entrance, a small room is divided into many small rooms, very good.
4. Bathtub: The bathtub is average, Marriott InterContinental usually gives bath salts.
5. Breakfast: Very rich.
Summary: Hilton's appearance is invincible among all hotels, but other aspects can only be said to be relatively balanced, without any special highlights.

msg:The hotel is still very good, the attitude of the service staff is very friendly, and you can feel a lot of careful thoughts in the details. Five-star praise.
I drove to the hotel with my family at around 2:30 pm. There may be some problems in the connection between the hotel and Ctrip system. Although I booked two rooms in one order, the front desk seemed to only recognize that I booked one room when checking in with my name. The other room was handled after providing the information of the other person, which is different from the usual check-in experience.
One room is on the 38th floor and the other is on the 30th floor, which is far apart. Fortunately, the room numbers are the same on different floors. They are all along the corridor to the innermost room at the end. The room is very bright, and the warm afternoon sunlight can supplement a lot of calcium.
If you look closely, you can find some mottled traces on the air-conditioning vents of the room on the 38th floor, which makes people feel the accumulation of years in this old hotel.
Later, after communicating with the front desk, I changed to another room type on the 38th floor. The room is much larger. I like the efficiency of the front desk in handling problems in a timely manner!
Later, because there was no small spoon in the room, I asked the front desk and it was delivered quickly. In addition, the hand soap that is usually available in the hotel has become hand sanitizer. I originally wanted a piece, but I have already bothered the front desk several times, so I was too embarrassed to give up.
In general, for a weekend in Jiaxing of about 700 yuan, it is probably worth the price. It is recommended that friends who stay in this hotel upgrade their rooms to avoid a lot of troublesome communication. After all, the most important thing when traveling is to have fun.

When I extended my stay, I casually mentioned it to the front desk. I didn't expect that the duty manager would follow up and solve it on the same day. When I had dinner the next day, all the minor problems that were not so good before were corrected. Sandy Guo, the executive lounge manager (a very beautiful lady), was very enthusiastic, capable, and efficient, which made people feel very friendly. The hotel room was clean, the afternoon tea was of high quality, very good, and tasted good. Overall, it was a satisfactory travel experience.

msg:After going out on a whim during the May Day holiday, I decided to stay in Jiaxing for one night. I didn't bring anything with me. After getting off the highway, I hesitated between Marriott and Hilton and chose Hilton. Let me talk about the good places first. Check-in was fast and the service was also good. I asked for water and disposable bathtub covers, which were delivered quickly. The hair dryer had a negative ion button. The Chinese restaurant had a double set meal option the next day. There were few people and it was quiet.
The bad places were also very bad. The disposable utensils provided were comparable to those of a small hotel in a town. I couldn't believe that I was staying in Hilton. I received a call back within two hours after checking out. I mentioned my doubts about the disposable utensils. The hotel apologized and asked to add WeChat to facilitate future check-in upgrades. I declined. I should come to Jiaxing again, and I probably won't choose Hilton again. I don't understand why they don't pay attention to the small places that should earn the most reputation, and they have to spend effort to restore the reputation after the return visit.

1. The floor was sticky as soon as I entered the hotel room
2. The layout of the room was a bit strange, resulting in the sofa table being moved
3. (4721) The shower door was difficult to close, and the above reasons led to the hotel changing rooms
4. The service was quite positive, and they helped us change rooms in a timely manner
5. When we returned in the evening, the hotel forgot to put our luggage in the room
6. The hotel room was not soundproof, and we could hear the corridor, stomping and running sounds upstairs at night
7. The shower door of the changed room was also a bit difficult to close
8. (4716) The toilet made a sound as long as there was a little water flow, which should be a problem with the location of the water. You can try pouring a glass of water into it, and you will immediately hear the sound of water splashing.

The hotel executive lounge is good, and the time period is much better than Andaz

The breakfast flow is not very good, a lot of people are crowded together, and the guests have to find their own seats, which led to some people quarreling over seats

The hotel is located 15 minutes away from the light rail, and the nearby business does not seem to be developed.

The overall service is OK, the room is not up to standard in many places, and it is probably a 4-star level.

The questions are all in the video, remember to turn on the sound.

I am impressed by the service of Manager Sandy, whose professionalism and enthusiasm make every guest feel at home. The hotel's facilities are also very complete, and both the guest rooms and public areas maintain a high standard of cleanliness and comfort.

In terms of advantages, I think the service of Jiaxing Hilton is its biggest highlight. Manager Sandy's thoughtfulness and attentiveness make people feel warm, and he can provide personalized services according to the needs of guests, which is very rare in many hotels. In addition, the hotel's facilities are also very modern and can meet the various needs of guests.

Overall, I have a very high evaluation of Jiaxing Hilton. If you are looking for a comfortable and modern accommodation environment and want to enjoy high-quality services, I strongly recommend you to choose Jiaxing Hilton. My suggestion is that whether you are on a business trip or a leisure vacation, Jiaxing Hilton is a good choice.

The service attitude of the hotel is very good, the breakfast is delicious, and the heated swimming pool is also very good. There are many kinds of desserts in afternoon tea, and the portions are so large that you can’t finish them all. The most important thing is that the hotel is very cost-effective, the rooms are large, and there is a bathtub. The staying experience is very good!

msg:Nowadays, the elders want to understand that they don’t have to work hard to prepare New Year’s goods and cook food. They book a hotel for two nights and spend the New Year happily in the hotel. This has become very popular in recent years. It seems that people in the hotel are bringing their families with them. Anyone from Shanghai will know this trend.
      Book the room early, because it is also a hotel, the driving distance is closer, and you can avoid the crowds; the hotel must be a brand hotel with good catering ratings. These are the factors for me to choose a hotel.
This time, the Jiaxing Hilton is a landmark building with 50 floors. Spring couplets and red lanterns are hung in the lobby, which is full of joy. Traveling on the first day of the new year, the rooms were relatively slow to come out (during the festival, which is understandable). We booked three rooms, but luckily we were given one to rest in first.
      We had a buffet dinner at the hotel on the night of the first day of the new year. The long table had been arranged. The family members spoke very well of the dinner. First of all, there are a lot of drinks, including red and white wine, rice wine, beer, as well as sparkling water and drinks. A small hot pot is also arranged, which is steaming and very a**ospheric. The quality of the lamb chops and meats are all top-notch, and the most commendable thing is the desserts. They are all delicious without being overwhelming.
      In terms of room service, all necessary items can be delivered to the room in time.
      The facilities are complete, including a swimming pool and a gym. The gym is quite large.
      The hotel is suitable for self-driving, and there is no public transportation around.
Of course, I personally think there are some shortcomings. For example, the hotel does not have an underground parking lot, which will be inconvenient in extreme weather. Also, the deposit was not withdrawn in time on the day. The hotel is just a tall building alone, with no views from the outside. Of course, the price is there, and the price/performance ratio is still high.

msg:A very satisfying stay. As soon as I booked the hotel, the staff called to confirm the time for the afternoon tea so that it could be prepared in advance. On the day of check-in, the room was upgraded directly. Every time I went out and couldn't get a taxi, the front desk would help arrange the contact. The prepared afternoon tea would be packed and sent directly to the room if it was inconvenient to go. The variety was much richer than expected. The room experience was also very good. It was arranged on the 46th floor with a good view. It was the Lantern Festival, and I saw the fireworks on the opposite side. The room was very spacious and the facilities were very satisfactory. Breakfast was on the first floor, with both Chinese and Western options. Although the variety was quite rich, I still felt a little dissatisfied. In addition, it was very cold during the two days I went there. The restaurant on the first floor was not warm enough, probably because it was facing the gate, but the restaurant itself was not surrounded by a wall. Even if I wore a thick coat when eating breakfast, my body could not get warm. The location of the hotel is quite convenient. I came to Jiaxing mainly for business. Basically, the taxis to the places I want to go are more than ten yuan, and it is also very convenient to go to the railway station. It takes only about 10 minutes to walk to Wanda Plaza. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the stay! Especially the staff, they are very kind and responsible!

For the third night of our trip to Jiaxing, we chose International Group, which is also said to be the commanding heights of Jiaxing.
The guy at the front desk upgraded the room to a higher floor. The room is on the 40th floor.
It's a pity that the smog was quite serious in those days, the glass was not clean, and the field of vision was deducted.
The grandeur and details of the hotel are still rated online. Compared with Hilton prices in other cities, it is also very cost-effective.
Children’s favorite is swimming🏊♀️ Bubble bath🛁 Satisfies them all
When I checked out, I was given a museum cooperation New Year poster.

Except for one of the transom windows that was blown open due to the wind, everything else is pretty good. Breakfast has both Chinese and Western styles, and the taste is quite satisfactory. I personally prefer cakes, but unfortunately they are not available here. The greeter at the door of the restaurant swiped the room card, looked at the three of us, and told him that my reservation included breakfast for two, and I had paid extra at the front desk when I checked in. I paid a separate breakfast fee and then had to verify my reservation information. I can only say that he is really serious and responsible in his work... During the meal, the waiter may not have mopped the floor clean, and a guest slipped and fell. I hope he can pay more attention in the future. , so as not to cause unnecessary trouble. Except for some problems encountered during breakfast, this stay was generally quite satisfactory.

The room I stayed in was very large and the layout was reasonable. Basically, it is in line with Hilton's management level. It is just that there may be insufficient manpower during the Spring Festival. For example, house cleaning, tea bag replacement, etc. are not done in place and timely. However, the flaws are not concealed. I will choose Hilton next time I come to Jiaxing. In addition, As a reminder, the front desk gave you a small gift after checking in.

The hotel's occupancy rate was very high during the Spring Festival, and the breakfast room seemed a bit crowded. Fortunately, the waiters closed the dishes and replenished dishes in time, which was considered orderly.
The hotel swimming pool is nice and the temperature is suitable. The only drawback is that the room temperature is too high and cannot be adjusted. It is still hot and stuffy even if the air conditioner is turned off.

For breakfast the next day, hotel staff were at the door to maintain order, and you had to wait in line to get a seat before going in to dine. Feel much better.

The service details also reflect the ultimate thoughtfulness. The duty manager Sandy Guo is kind and enthusiastic. The reception at check-in and the speed at check-out all make people feel considerate and caring. The sanitary conditions have reached the high standards of a five-star hotel. Every place is as clean as new, which completely exceeded my expectations. What a great stay!

msg:On a temporary trip, I hastily booked a hotel on the high-speed rail. We arrived after 12 o'clock and were checked in. The room is located on the 38th floor, with a nice view👍🏻The twin room is clean and spacious, with a 1.35-meter twin bed, and the toilet and shower are separated, making it very suitable for family travel.
Since the weather was too cold and I didn’t want to go out, I made a reservation for the hotel’s buffet dinner in the afternoon. There are discounts for hotel guests, which is a bit more cost-effective than Dianping. The taste is also very good, and the kid who doesn't eat desserts ate a lot for the first time. There are live singers and the a**osphere is full. Molly at the door also goes to Oita😁
I had something to delay the next morning, so I asked if I could delay check-out, which was immediately arranged. Thumbs up to the duty manager James.
I am very satisfied with my stay. I will consider staying here next time if I come to Jiaxing.

Although it was not our first time to Jiaxing, each of the attractions he introduced suddenly made us yearn for this city again. The Ginkgo Street View of Santa Road, Fanli Lake Park, and the quiet and fashionable Luxihui are all our first time here. They are quite good, with cultural a**osphere, fashionable elements, and a quiet and relaxing place, making people unforgettable and comfortable. Thanks to Xiao Wang and his colleagues for their sincere and enthusiastic service.
Secondly, the hotel is worthy of being an authentic Hilton hotel. The services of all personnel, hotel facilities and supplies, and catering are all of high quality. Although we only stayed for one night, the hotel's warm service made us unforgettable. Thank you James Wang, thank you to all the hotel staff.

After arriving at the hotel, I was upgraded to a room type for free. The higher floor is indeed quieter, which is very helpful for a light sleeper like me. The room is clean, spacious and well ventilated. There are many eating options nearby, and it is very convenient to go out to scenic spots. The hotel's breakfast buffet is rich in variety and the service is very good.
Mona and Ayn, the front desk managers on duty, provided very good service. Any minor incidents that occurred during the stay were immediately resolved, which reflects the brand value.
The whole stay was very comfortable. I will choose Hilton again when I come to Jiaxing in the future.

We went during the long holiday on October 1st. The passenger flow was very high, but the hotel was well organized and there were no long queues or difficulty finding seats for breakfast.
This shows that the level of international hotel chain brands is still online.
The room is also relatively large and the swimming pool is nice.
The executive lounge is nice and the beer is good. Hahaha
Not far from "Linggongtang". During my morning run, I also met many Jiaxing runners.
All in all worth staying.

She made my first impression very good and also introduced me to famous snacks in the surrounding area. I was assigned a high floor. Because I didn't like high floors, I contacted Manager Guo to change the room. She also actively served me. I was very satisfied after entering the room. The bedding was very comfortable. When checking out, Manager Guo told the restaurant to prepare a piece of fruit for me to take away (because it was too late the night before and it was not delivered successfully). Great service awareness. If I have the chance to stay again, I will still choose Hilton Jiaxing

If the window cannot be opened, the room feels a bit smelly. Also, there are a lot of people at the swimming pool during the holidays, so it would be best to set up a reservation system to avoid peak times.

The underground garage is dark and the lobby is not a**ospheric. The room decoration is very average and the bathroom does not have a washlet. Nothing but the night view. The service is also worrisome. When I checked in, I saw that there were children, and they were not given slippers or toothbrushes. I asked if they had a bath bag. I said I needed to look for it before I got back to them. Then I heard nothing from them all night. The environment and variety of the buffet breakfast are average. There is only one slide for outdoor play. Indoor play is banned and tables are set up for breakfast. When checking out, I reported service issues. In the afternoon, the manager added me on WeChat, thinking it was an apology, but turned out to be asking for a good review.

Still with the same point of view, try to find hotels that have only been open for a few years. The facility is still in that condition without much wear and tear.
There are Wanda Plazas or convenience stores when you go out, which is quite convenient.
The breakfast is also at the level that a five-star hotel should have. At this price point, you don’t necessarily need to make their meals more exquisite.
You can choose to stay again when you come to Jiaxing

The service is average, and the five-star service needs to be improved. After all, it is a relatively business-oriented hotel. There is no welcome water in the hotel lobby at noon, and it is not particularly friendly to children.

The whole hotel is only a children's room. Hahaha, the environment and facilities are very good, and the service staff everywhere in the hotel are also very good Nice, next time I come to Jiaxing, I will choose Hilton. The swimming pool is great, and the children like it very much. In terms of food, whether it is the buffet on the 1st floor or the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor, it is worth recommending, especially the Chinese restaurant, the dishes are very delicious.

msg:During the vacation, we ended our trip to Suxi. I came to Jiaxing all the way from Shanghai, and stayed at the Jiaxing Hilton Hotel, which just opened.
       Hilton Jiaxing is the tallest building in Jiaxing and a landmark building in Jiaxing. The hotel lobby is low-key, luxurious and stylish. All kinds of decorations displayed in the lobby are high-end.
       Upon entering the lobby, the concierge service immediately helped the elderly to place their luggage. Ms. Xia Jin, who received us, was warm, thoughtful, considerate and meticulous. Considering the living needs of the elderly, she arranged for us a room facing south with a wide view.
        Hilton Hotel rooms are spacious, comfortable and well-equipped. The bathroom adopts three separations, and the toilet is equipped with a cabin-style sink, and verbena face soap is thoughtfully placed. The mattresses in the rooms are very comfortable and breathable.
       The room service center provides 24-hour all-day service to solve our problems in time.
        The Hilton Hotel's buffet breakfast is rich, delicious, and of high quality, and the quality of the west and mid-point is great. Jiaxing special snacks are also available. This is one of the reasons why we choose to stay at the Hilton Hotel.
       The hotel is located in Nanhu District, it is very convenient to enter and exit major scenic spots, and the surrounding supporting commercial facilities are complete.
         The excellent service provided by the Hilton Hotel made us reluctant to leave.

Two or three employees at the desk next to the check-out said they couldn't check in. The next day I checked out and went to the desk next to me to check out and said that I couldn’t get a refund or I had to refund at the check-in desk...so what did I see when I checked in? The room brochure stated that the executive hotel time is 6:00-10:00 every morning, which is wrong and not that long.
The afternoon tea cake in the executive lounge is good, but there is not much to eat. The Perrier water was brought out after seeing other people drinking it. The dinner bread provided in the evening was cold and should be left over from breakfast. Meat dishes are all kinds of grilled meat in one pot. It feels like there are leftovers.
 In short....em... I probably won't come to live again in the future

It is 8 kilometers away from Jiaxing High-speed Railway South Station and 8 kilometers away from Nanhu Scenic Area. It is close to Jiaxing Wanda Commercial District and has convenient transportation.

Almost all employees cannot say hello to guests when they meet them. Even the employees wearing cadre uniforms did not greet the guests while riding in the elevator. This is a big problem from the top down.
During dinner in the cafeteria, dozens of primary school students were allowed to engage in fun activities. Beat gongs and drums and make a fuss. Children were running around and making noise. Seriously damaged the restaurant environment and seriously disturbed the mood of the dining guests. There are small hot pots on the tables, and it is a time when children have serious respiratory diseases. It is unbelievable, unheard of, and unseen to dare to hold such an event with such various safety risks.
A hotel with a well-known international brand will have these problems. It is the hotel's top management who should do something.

🏡#hotellobby 🏡
As soon as I enter the door, there is a scent, which is quite strong. To me, the smell is average and choking.
The overall lobby is not particularly large, and the more attractive is the Phalaenopsis, which is brighter in color.
The light and shadow of the section from the lobby to the elevator room is relatively good, but the smell of heavy ink decoration is still pungent.

🏩Room Facilities🏩
The overall rooms are relatively standard business type.
Particularly worth recommending:
🌸The hotel has many floors. If you live on a high floor, you can see the university's ⚽️ football field and 🏀 basketball court outside the window. The view is still good.
🌸The color of the carpet in the room is a warmer yellow, which is softer overall.
🌸The fragrance of the hand washing and bathing series used is still good.

The executive floor not only has a high floor, but also its executive lounge can meet the needs of guests, whether it is afternoon tea or happy hour at night, it is worthy of this price.

The hotel has only been in operation for two years, with new equipment, new environment, and cleanliness.

If it is insufficient, it is that the water provided in the room is a little less, and only 2 bottles of pure water are provided, especially the executive room, which should satisfy the drinking water of the guests, in order to get a better staying experience. The water problem has been solved. I like to drink tea, and I am very concerned about the water that the hotel prepares for guests.
The parking lot is definitely big enough for easy parking.

msg:Let me talk about the disadvantages first. There are huge crowds of people who go there during the Chinese New Year. We didn’t get the room until after 17:00. There was a lot of noise from the front desk. When we went upstairs to the room, we were given a corner room, which was very small. The front desk didn’t admit it, saying it was the same size. I showed her the picture and she explained it was the other big room, not your small one, excellent front desk. You need to queue for half an hour for breakfast, because there are really too many people, and there are very few breakfast items. I came from Suzhou Fairmont on New Year's Eve. The breakfast can be said to beat Jiaxing Hilton.
Special thanks to the foreman of the Chinese restaurant on the second floor. I booked a table for dinner. The service is very good. The most important thing is that the environment is good, not as noisy as the first floor.
The cleanliness of the hotel rooms is average. Don't blame the cleaning lady. The rooms are too big and there are too many rooms to clean in time. It may be better in normal times.

I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 pm on the first day, and by 5:30 pm, I got the room card after communicating with Ctrip for mediation. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to stay today.
There was no explanation from the hotel throughout the entire process.
The buffet dinner in the evening had few items, poor service and no management at all. I took some photos for your reference.
The most ridiculous thing is that when I left, I wanted to ask the front desk for a mask. The answer was that I bought the masks myself and could not give them to guests.
The overall experience was very, very poor.

I had just checked in for two hours and you asked me about my stay? What can I feel? Fortunately, the lady in the room service was very patient and would arrange it as soon as possible.

Ctrip booked two nights on Friday and Saturday, but the room card cannot be used on Saturday. I went to the front desk and was told if I wanted to extend my stay? It was the man with glasses at the front desk who greeted me. I reiterated many times that I was not extending my stay. I had originally booked 2 nights, but I still kept asking if I wanted to extend my stay. I don’t even know how to answer so that she can understand. Let’s talk about the room facilities. The shower head in the shower room is very strange. The hot and cold water displays are opposite, and the small shower head will only face the wall no matter how you adjust it. I don’t know if it’s like this in all rooms or in ours. Anyway, it’s pretty good. Disappointing and not worthy of the Hilton name. There are also good things, the swimming pool water is very clean and the breakfast has many varieties. But I will not choose this restaurant again when I come to Jiaxing in the future.

msg:Between Nanhu Hotel and Hilton, I chose Hilton decisively, and booked an executive room for two nights. The hotel’s parking lot is very large. I drove from Shanghai and parked on the ground for two days. When I checked in, the front desk would ask for the license plate and approach the system. Very convenient.

Let’s talk about the hardware first. As a newly opened hotel in 2021, there is no need to worry about the hardware. The executive room is located on the 47th floor, facing the Nanhu CBD. The whole room is clean and hygienic. The electronic control system and air-conditioning of the house are adequate and the layout is reasonable, the bedding is extremely comfortable, and there is also the tradition of Hilton to watch satellites🛰️📺.

If you have to find some small flaws, then the area of ​​the room, especially the area of ​​the bathroom is relatively small. The toilet is not a smart toilet, which may be due to cost considerations.

In terms of software, the security guards at the entrance of the hotel are serious and responsible, the front desk is quite standard and slightly blunt, the lounge experience is very good, and the supervisor has shown a high level of service quality. He asked about the room experience for two consecutive days and promptly resolved the individual needs of customers. On the second night, the happy hour hot food stall was close to closing, and the service was not discounted at all, and they would not rush the guests. In addition, the waiter who registered the room number in the breakfast area on the first floor was also very polite, which is worthy of praise!

In addition, the breakfast at this Hilton is really beyond expectations, with a variety of varieties and everything that one expects to find. It completely beats the Pudong Ritz who stayed last month. I hope the hotel can continue to maintain its advantages and become the leader in the hotel industry in Jiaxing!

As soon as I checked in, I heard the sound of the electric drill vibrating the floor. I called the front desk and got no reply. Later, when I wanted to turn on the air conditioner, I found that the air conditioner was not heating, so I called the main station, which was called natural wind, and said I asked the master to come and have a look. After waiting for 15 minutes, the master did not come. Minutes later, the master came to check the temperature, knowing that the air conditioner was broken, he even arranged such a defective room for me. I called the main desk again and asked to change rooms. The main desk said that they would send someone over and waited for more than 20 minutes. No one answered me for a long time. The efficiency was too low, and then the sound of the electric drill kept coming and going. , and the service staff ignored people, I was so angry that I ran to the front desk to check out. Contact Ctrip customer service Shiliu, Ctrip's follow-up is really good, and then compromised and changed to an executive suite. It was now 4:30 pm. The efficiency of the hotel service staff is really too low, individuals have no affinity, and the service awareness is not correct. Staying in the executive suite is not worry-free, the hygiene is bad, and there are dried rice grains left by the previous guest on the table. Please see the pictures for details. When I stayed at 8:00, the smoke alarm went off. I didn't smoke or take a bath. I called the front desk, and the front desk said they would send someone to take a look. After waiting for more than an hour, no one came. Really Speechless. I called the main station again, and said that someone would be sent over. After about 10 minutes, someone came and said the problem was resolved. Why can't you give feedback in time? This hotel is really bad in terms of hygiene and service level. When checking out, the manager wanted to chat with me. He explained that he was sorry that the sound of the electric drill bothered me, and I was too lazy to complain to her. It was more than the sound of the electric drill. There was no need to tell her about the situation after going to the exam. Well, anyway, I will never stay at the Hilton again in the future. There is also poor sound insulation, you can hear the sound of the TV next door. On the upper floors, there is a window that is probably leaking a little air, and the wind is also loud.

It is recommended that the executive room be set at the same price, and the trea**ent of the executive lounge is really great. I didn't know the difference at first, thinking it was the same as the lounge of InterContinental Nanjing. Thanks to the Weiland manager for making reasonable arrangements for us. The 8-year anniversary of the wedding has been very experienced. Special thanks!

Kris, the on-duty manager who helped with the check-in, introduced us to the facilities and equipment of the hotel very professionally and with a warm and friendly attitude. He also introduced us to some attractions in Jiaxing for the first time when we came to Jiaxing, and praised him for his professionalism. 👍

msg:This is the worst Hilton I've ever stayed in. And it's still newly opened, and the aisle stinks to death. There are no paper towels in the room. Now the curtains of the newly opened hotel are actually manual. Due to the late check-in, I was hungry and ordered a takeaway, but the front desk refused to let me. The epidemic prevention and control is understandable, but don't tell me that we are a five-star hotel for food safety. Is takeaway toxic? Funny, learn from other hotels, robots can deliver meals. Five star? Why? Has it been open for a year? Has the Tourism Board rated it? You may feel that you are at a loss. It was already past 11 o'clock in the evening, and it was almost 12 o'clock in the evening. A waiter knocked on the door, saying that it was a fruit plate. I figured it out, and knocked on the door in the middle of the night. Have you been trained? I just went to work, I can't complain.

兩點建議：1、建議酒店增加非特斯拉或保時捷專用的充電樁，目前酒店的地面停車場設有7～8個特斯拉專用充電樁和2個保時捷專用充電樁，但絕大部分都在閑置，相當浪費資源。2、春節期間酒店早餐人很多，即使我們特意錯開酒店建議的9:30之前的高峯時段來吃早餐依然半天找不到座位，而且也沒有任何酒店工作人員主動前來指引或幫我們找座位，而且到了10:30又非常準時的收餐，導致我們兩天的早餐都吃的十分匆忙，這點體驗不太好。

電視機是不能投屏的，這都2024年了，早餐時發現這酒店是2021年開業，這什麼年代了，電視機不支持投屏……
一個酒店的硬件差到如此地步，以後肯定是不會再住了，出差那麼多，確實是全季桔子一類的性價比高。
對於這希爾頓滿滿的差評……

新建的酒店還比較新，房間比較乾淨。廁所的沐浴露和洗髮水在牆上沒有固定好，洗澡的時候差點掉下來砸到我🙃
第二天9點多隔壁不知道是酒店工人施工還是什麼就開始敲敲打打發出噪音，一點都不管別人的感受。整體感受都比較糟糕👎
吃一塹長一智下次帶爸媽出行還是要擦亮眼睛挑選好酒店。

整個就餐過程，這位經理（猜測）對於我們前面那桌長者和我們這桌都在經過時俯身關心一下，詢問一下，隨手收拾掉一些雜物殘渣等。
帶寶寶出遊的家庭對於 這點 應該深有感觸，被戳中，有沒有。
我們離開餐廳時，快十點半，看到轉角處熟悉的身影正在和幾位工作人員站着貌似在開會，打聽了一下，果然是經理，王辰羽經理~ 給你快步穿梭忙碌的每一個早晨五星好評！

前台經理家豪處理問題及時，因為我們入住時間比較早，提前安排了房間並作了房型升級。
原本兩晚之後去到烏鎮酒店，在希爾頓入住期間無論硬件、軟件都很給力，果斷續住一晚，打車當天來回烏鎮回到嘉興希爾頓。

msg:酒店服務很好，入住的時候和前台溝通了很久最終一家人都給安排在了一個樓層，鑽卡會員也給升級了套房。行政酒廊的出品還是挺不錯的，happy hour能當晚餐，下午茶點心品種也夠多，而且服務也很熱情、專業。早餐品種很豐富，蘭州拉麪特別贊。中餐廳味道可以，不過食材感覺一般，和定位有點距離。缺點的話，大堂感覺和酒店的檔次不是太匹配、房間的毛巾感覺有點硬，看上去不知道是燈光關係還是怎麼的，有點灰。不過總體性價比還是很高的，這個價位的希爾頓可以無腦沖。泳池和健身房硬件沒的説，就是外包的，使用起來可能會遇到別人上課，碰運氣了。

現在暑期同價格酒店，全國都找不到嘉興希爾頓這麼好的。房間大，環境好，配置新，浴室水到位。

服務：春節期間前台、餐廳每個人都很忙碌，但依然熱情。前兩晚是在希爾頓官網預訂的，前台看我們一家老小，很nice的把其中一間客房安排了角房，還送了小朋友生日蛋糕。年三十初一安排了揮春同包餃子的活動。初一早上安排了舞獅表演。
泳池：前台小姐姐很熱情，不過好像是外包了。大池子很大，非常不錯。還有兩個熱水池，不過似乎裏面不太乾淨。淋浴水偏涼。體感最多32度。更衣室裏拖鞋很臟，各種頭髮沒有清理，就直接上架了。
早餐：品種不多。也沒什麼特色。住到目前唯一一家供應盒裝橙汁的hilton hotel & resorts。餐廳管理意識沒有跟上。比方牛奶豆漿、麥片、果汁居然放在三個距離還不近的角落。年初一大客流，咖啡機衹拿出一台，還出現故障。我兔年第一杯咖啡居然是客房裡的速溶咖啡…餐點衹有水餃，沒有湯圓。要知道南方年初一是吃湯圓，寓意團團圓圓。
位置：商務區，步行到萬達10分鐘內。開到南湖天地5km。挺方便的。

msg:酒店的位置並不是特別好，但好在嘉興城區本身不大，且酒店周邊餐飲和購物都是方便的，所以並不影響。
從酒店的設施來説，整體都不錯，符合希爾頓中高端的酒店定位，不足之處主要是封閉窗的情況下換氣並不是很好，住久了會比較悶。
酒店服務還是比較細緻和熱情的，但是下午大堂吧基本沒有單點甜點供應，僅有的幾個小蛋糕看着也不太新鮮，最後衹買了一杯咖啡（大堂吧的咖啡師並沒有詢問要冷的還是熱的）。
總體來説入住體驗還不錯，就是一些小細節上的問題，在嘉興的所有酒店裡還是挺不錯的~

一眼看中希爾頓酒店，説是嘉興最高的大樓。畢竟之前在廣州老跟媽媽住，品牌還是放心的。就預訂了普通的兩晚大床房。一天帶早餐一天不帶早餐。

我們高鐵早上十一點不到就到了，可以辦理入住。Jessica小姐姐態度很好，很温柔，我是護照，等得時間比較久也沒有不耐煩；看我們外地來玩的，還特地送了我們第二天的自助早餐和歡迎水果。愛了愛了！

床很舒服，來之前我是失眠的，但這兩天睡得很好。老公更是天天泡在浴缸裏面不肯出來。健身房是24小時的，器械很足，老公很滿意。

唯一一點點不足的地方就是地上有一些臟，不過問題不大。

入住體驗很棒，下次還會選擇希爾頓！

msg:這是嘉興第二家希爾頓酒店。作為嘉興人怎麼能不支持一下呢？然而入住的體驗是失望的。
客觀説我衹能給一分。5分是給客户經理有意識處理問題的態度。還有早餐煮麪的廚師，衹有這一位真正執行了希爾頓讓客人賓之如歸的理念。他身上散發著温和快樂的能量。
下面的評論，如果你們真正做筆記改到實處了絕對比你們買各種營銷號站台推廣有用。
1.入住沒有升級房間，兩次提出依然沒有，看評論酒店是有這個服務的，是什麼原因在入住率低的情況下不給我升級，我的理解是看人下菜碟。我不想撕破這個體面去解釋我是鉑金會員其實我有二次免費升級房間的權益的。
2酒店整體裝修設計風格沒有驚喜，沒有豪華感，沒有品牌酒店特有的香味。房間窗户鎖着，沒有標誌告知住客可以要求打開，房間味道重，處理衹是更換更高層酒店那樣根本解決問題。
3泳池外包出去，我進去遭到無理驅離，酒店管理人員要明白犧牲客人體驗換取的短期利益一定會憑實力流走的。
4酒店衞生打掃不合格，枕頭下面有牙簽。這個嚴重的疏漏是快捷酒店都不應該有的。
5.送的不是月餅禮盒是月餅券要客人自己下去領，這種多此一舉的服務目的是什麼？賓至如歸體現在哪？你回到家會拿券領吃的嗎？
6.早餐單一品種少，自點餐食價格貴的有點離譜。
7售後沒有解決根本問題更多是形式上敷衍。客服經理後來邀請給機會免費再入住一次並送早餐。相比之下我更願意聽到我會在哪些方面改進沒辦法改進的告知理由，改進後會通知您來體驗，我會給您打折扣並送早餐希望您在此之間不要急於對我們做出評價，我們對您的服務還沒有終止。這樣才是讓客户感到受尊重。如果問題依然存在，再入住一晚有什麼意義？我的感受是你們不關心客户反饋的問題衹想成功解決的潛在的差評。
酒店優點：離萬達和凌公塘方便購物和休閑。花灑和浴缸不錯。有機器人送餐方便

msg:與家人選擇出行住酒店，慶祝新春。選擇此酒店考慮到希爾頓品牌，另外新開，設施服務都會較好。但是沒想到，從入住開始，3點入住，表示還沒有房，要等1小時。在交涉多次會，才給到房間。入住後，房間熱悶，台盆漏水，被子太厚蓋不上。早飯10點去吃，竟然排長隊，餐食也很普通，體驗很差
