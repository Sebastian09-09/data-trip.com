msg:The previous post said that the hygiene was poor, so why did I stay for two nights? The reason was that I overslept and exceeded the time limit, so I thought about extending it for another night to avoid having to find another hotel. On the day of the extension, there was afternoon tea with a cake, a fruit (dragon fruit, cantaloupe, watermelon) and a drink.

msg:General introduction and stay experience evaluation of Putian Licheng Youde Hotel:

1. **【3】【2】** The hotel opened in 2018 and was renovated in 2020. It provides fast check-in, free room WIFI, restaurant and 24-hour front desk service. The hotel advocates a green and environmentally friendly lifestyle, responds to reducing the use of disposable plastic products, and no longer actively provides disposable items, but if you need it, you can consult in advance.

2. **【9】【10】【4】** The hotel is strategically located in the middle section of Yanshou Middle Road, the main commercial road in Putian City, close to Putian Sports Center, Putian Grand Theater, Zhengrong Commercial Center and other landmark buildings, with convenient transportation. The hotel has a magnificent exterior and luxurious and elegant interior design. It provides 167 guest rooms of different styles. The guest rooms are fully equipped with WIFI, high-speed Internet access, LCD TV, domestic and international long-distance calls, etc.

3. **【5】【4】** The hotel also has Chinese and Western restaurants, spas, gyms, chess and card rooms, tea art rooms, billiard rooms, conference halls and other facilities to provide guests with a wealth of entertainment and leisure options.

4. **【7】** However, reviews on TripAdvisor pointed out that although the hotel's hardware facilities are great value, the software and services are not satisfactory.

5. **【4】** In addition, there are other hotels to choose from, such as Yishang Hotel, Huitong Haoting International Hotel, Super 8 Hotel, etc., all located in different areas of Putian City, offering different prices and services.

In general, Putian Licheng Youde Hotel has received certain recognition in terms of hardware facilities, but there seems to be some shortcomings in terms of service. If you are considering staying, it is recommended to learn about the latest service situation of the hotel in advance and make a choice based on your own needs.

msg:1. I traveled with friends and stayed at Youde Hotel. I was very satisfied with this hotel. 2. I have a mysophobia. No matter where I stay, I like to see the room first before checking in. Then the front desk lady and a handsome guy took me to see the room politely and enthusiastically. 3. The lobby doesn't look very bright, and it feels a bit dark, but the room is very wide, the facilities are decorated in the style I like, the bed is very soft, and the details on the countertop are also in place. 4. The reviews say that there is a KTV downstairs that is very noisy. I was quite worried about insomnia at the time. The floor that the lady took on the day of check-in was a bit high, and I was very glad that I didn't feel any noise. Then the hotel has convenient transportation, free parking, and a good stadium next to it. It is also convenient to eat nearby. In short, it is a very satisfactory stay experience. If I come to Putian with my friends next time, I will continue to choose this hotel.

msg:I generally don't give negative reviews, even if I'm very dissatisfied. This time, the room price was more than 400 yuan, but I did not enjoy the corresponding service, which made me feel disappointed. The following is based on facts. (1) Ctrip marked the hotel as a 5-diamond luxury hotel, so there should be welcome fruits or snacks. Moreover, it is Chris**as, but the front desk said that they would not be delivered until after 1 p.m. the next day after check-in. Oh my god. , we left the store at 8 o'clock the next day, obviously we didn't want to give it! I have never heard of giving "welcome" fruit until the next afternoon. Even if it is given, it is "farewell"; (2) We ask you, isn't this a 4-star hotel? The answer from the front desk was, it's not a 4-star hotel, it's a 3-star hotel! Therefore there is no corresponding service. Then a 3-star hotel shouldn’t charge more than 400 yuan a day! (3) In the newly checked-in room, a grape was found on the floor, as evidenced by the photo below; (4) The breakfast did not meet the standards of this price range, and the quantity was indeed 3-star standards. We were the first to go in for breakfast, and found that the milk in the bottle was only one-eighth (see picture). Readers can think about the reason for themselves; (5) There were no welcome snacks, but there were a lot of consumer foods in the room, and everything needed to be done. They charged a 500 deposit and were slow to check out without any apology.

There is a bus to the high-speed rail station at the door, and the transportation is convenient. There is a lot of drinking water in the room, and you can add more for free if it is not enough. There are many varieties of hot dishes for breakfast, and the taste is also good. Suggestions for improvement in the following aspects: 1. The paid consumer goods in the room are not used now. If you need them, you can order takeout, which is cheap and convenient. These things can be removed, so that guests do not need to pay a deposit of 500 yuan during their stay. 2. The front desk staff have serious expressions and need to learn smiling service skills, which will bring a friendly and comfortable feeling to the guests.

But the three girls at the check-in front desk were not only rude, but also chatted together while checking in. One of them even used dirty words.

The location of the hotel is convenient and easy to find, and it is also very convenient to travel. If clothes are lost in the room, I will call you immediately and arrange to send them back.
The only drawback: the waiter at the breakfast front desk was very rude and unfriendly to guests, which was in sharp contrast to the overall specifications of the hotel. We had to catch the early high-speed train, so we decided to take away some breakfast snacks that were included in the breakfast service to eat on the way. After all, we had to leave the hotel at 7 o'clock, but she was very unfriendly. There were three adults and two teenagers in two rooms. Children, we only packed a box of fried dough sticks + 3 slices of bacon and 5 cans of small packaged yogurt. When one of the adults wanted to drink a small bowl of white porridge on the spot, the service staff asked that we need to pay extra! We can only leave in anger! It is hoped that the hotel can improve related services and that the professional quality of the service staff can match the hotel's decoration and facilities.

msg:The worst and worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If you want to sleep well, don't choose this hotel. The KTV on the 6th floor was still dancing at 3 o'clock in the morning. I could feel the whole building vibrating. I didn't sleep well all night! ! ! Maybe because the nightclub is making money, the front desk didn't respond at all. Almost called the police. The elevator to the hotel room is the same as that to the nightclub. The elevator smells of alcohol, and the carpet in the room smells bad. The sound insulation is poor👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎 🏻 👎🏻👎🏻.

It cost 300 yuan. I didn’t sleep well all night. There was construction underneath in the morning. I was really speechless. 🤦‍♀️, I won’t dare to stay here again.

It was only a few minutes before check-out at noon, but they still deducted half a day's room fee. Fortunately, the manager was reasonable, which was good. It's just that the room-hopping is not good, it's too expensive.

msg:Very angry and had an extremely poor hotel experience. As a Ctrip diamond member, I have been to dozens of countries and stayed in hundreds of hotels, and I have never been so angry.
① A deposit is collected when checking in, and there is no deposit even for the mini bar.
②The refrigerator was broken and was kept in disorder. I told the hotel and after waiting for a long time, the aunt came up and said that the refrigerator in your room was broken, and then it disappeared.
③As an old hotel, I can understand that the hardware facilities are dilapidated, but at least the service attitude should be worthy of your star rating. I kept asking the front desk my name and refused to tell me. Is this because I made a mistake and am afraid of complaining?
④I said I was a hotel tenant, but the security guard pointed to the left side of the main gate and asked us to park. We walked around on the left side and found no space, and finally took away the sign on the right side to let us park.
⑤Look at this bed. It’s as hard as a wooden bed. I couldn’t sleep at all. At 11 o’clock in the evening, I told the hotel. The hotel said it was because the room I booked was on a low floor. That’s all. Shouldn’t the customer’s feelings be considered? Change rooms. When I booked the room, it said that the floor was low and the bedding was not good?
⑥A five-star hotel doesn’t even have tea bags. The female receptionist at the hotel came again and said that you don’t have tea bags on a lower floor. Haha, do the same hotels treat each other differently? I'm not asking you to put Perrier, just a tea bag.
⑦Finally, I am really angry with the service attitude of this hotel and hope it can be improved.

msg:If you extend your stay, you will receive a breakfast. It's amazing. Double room comes with a breakfast. Ctrip Mom, let me ask you, are you interested? If you want to give one to 2 people, just don’t give it away. Then upgrade your room type for free. This is the name of the front desk manager. Also said the manager. Not gross at all. I was wondering if I could get an extra breakfast without upgrading the room type. After all, there is a price difference. I called the lady at the front desk and she was very friendly. Replaced a so called front desk manager. The tone is surprisingly heavenly. In fact, I won’t eat it either. I can’t get up so early. That tone and attitude is off-putting. I stayed 4 nights in a row. . . The embodiment of beauty. It was bad all of a sudden. ~I still remember what the manager said. You upgrade. . . I asked what the difference would be if I upgraded to a deluxe twin bed. Will the size be the same inside? Is there any difference in the decoration style? ? ? ? ? No. The same floor is only 2 floors high. . . . . . . . So don’t get a deluxe double room as standard in your room type. It doesn't deserve it. It should be called a high-rise room. It turns out that the KTV downstairs is noisy. Still jumping around at 1am. I didn't live in a lowly place either. Hahaha. Front desk manager, your attitude is really bad. I really lose points.

🔔Service: I have never seen such speechless service. After the front desk sent the wrong thing and called me to wake me up at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, without a word of apology, he said that he had dialed the wrong room number... The weather was getting warmer, and the room temperature was 28 degrees. No, they didn’t even turn on the air conditioner. I was speechless.
🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient. There are many places to eat nearby. A taxi from the high-speed rail station only costs more than 20 yuan...

沒有自助餐，衹提供三選一簡單的小套餐，選好了回房間等送，入住的時候也沒有提前告知，感覺花了冤枉錢。這就算了，按照要求選好了回房間，結果等待了四十分鐘才送上來，早上的行程計劃受到了很大的影響，體驗感很差。

msg:I chose this hotel for the first time on a business trip to Putian and stayed for three consecutive days
I paid 500 as a deposit, and I get 385 back when I leave the store. I know that there is a 15 yuan consumption.
But charged a hundred dollars for overtime, I can't understand
My Ctrip order is check out at two o'clock
The front desk called at 14:00 to ask if I would like to extend the stay. Then I said that we have a lot of things and a lot of things need to be sorted out. Please accommodate me and need a little more time to sort them out as soon as possible. The attitude of the front desk is very good and I say yes
The check-out time is 14:50, the front desk said that they check out by computer at 15:10
This is the hotel that charged me an overtime fee once I checked out one hour overtime
From InterContinental St. Regis to Atour and other boutique hotels
From a big hotel to a small hotel, I was charged an overtime fee for the first time.

and was charged for overtime without telling me in advance
I called the front desk and the front desk kept telling me normal XXXX normal XXXX like a robot. I think this is too inhumane. If you have to pay for overtime, please let me know in advance. I didn’t notify me when I called and said I would come down later to check out , I don’t think it’s my responsibility. If we had informed in advance, then we should be quicker. Everyone in Putian has a good impression. From the restaurant owner to the service staff to the taxi driver, everyone has a good attitude, except when checking out. This matter is very unpleasant!

Everyone, avoid the trap
Let me add that the 5.6th floor of this hotel is like a nightclub Ktv. At night, there are women with bare thighs one after another, and drunkards one after another. The whole hotel is full of smoke 🫠
