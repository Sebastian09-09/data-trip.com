One very minor observation about breakfast service, that the staff would ask some people about drinks and bring coffee but not others. I had breakfast for three consecutive days but not once been asked about if I’d like some drink… the staff passed me several times… Not a great feeling.

Excellent breakfast, also here great service. Fresh juice available only on demand, but that’s fine. 

Full rating, very recommendable, especially with kids (extra toothpaste, toothbrush, lotion, foam bath- all brought to room, play ground close to breakfast place)

Beds comfortable and rooms have everything you need. Checking in was a little bit slow. It wasn’t obvious where I could get breakfast - I went down to the cafe in the morning and found they don’t serve food until the afternoon. Perhaps I missed it because I’m not a native Chinese speaker, but perhaps that could have been communicated better. 

Overall a nice stay.

The biggest feature of the hotel is the 46th floor helipad on the top floor. My dad and I checked in here and watched the sunset. It was very beautiful. The breakfast buffet is very rich. We had breakfast every day, and basically it was afternoon before we ate again. When we checked out, the hotel also gave us a bird brooch as a souvenir.

The hotel is in a great location, located next to Xuanwu Lake. The view of Xuanwu Lake from the sky is very recommended. When I got off the taxi at the hotel, Master Zhong, who was very enthusiastic, helped me take my luggage to the front desk to check in. Thank him very much! After checking in, I thanked Brother Wang Lichao for helping me deliver my luggage to the room and answering my questions. Thank you very much!

Manager Zhang of the hotel prepared and arranged the room for me in advance after communication. Manager Terry of the housekeeping depar**ent also paid great attention to details and cared about my daily life during my stay. The room was very comfortable and tidy.
The Jinling Roast Duck at Jiangnan Stove is worth a try. The Black Pearl Chinese Restaurant deserves it. Of course, other dishes are also very well done. Thank you for the dishes recommended by the restaurant manager Jay and the excellent service. The dishes at Yunfu are even more amazing.
Ms. Luna, the guest relations, is very warm and considerate. She appeared in time when I needed help and sent me lemonade to the room; Mr. Ian and Ms. Rita in the lounge are very professional and patient. It must be the outstanding performance of Manager Cristiano Wang leading the team.
During my stay, I am very grateful to Manager Hu Kun of the Security Depar**ent for answering my questions about food, accommodation, travel, shopping and entertainment in Nanjing on the apron very professionally and enthusiastically. He is really a Nanjing PHS. Mr. Sun Mengmeng of the Security Depar**ent is also a warm-hearted person. It is very pleasant to communicate with him! Thank you for recommending me the tourist attractions in Nanjing, which makes me feel comfortable when traveling alone.
The drinks in the lobby bar are amazing, and the Metropolitan is really delicious. Manager Young always appears with a smile on his face, worthy of being a gentleman serving gentlemen and ladies.
Thank you to Jimmy, Director Yuan, Manager Raymond/Manager Caroline Zhao/Manager Cherry for their meticulous care, providing me with high-quality and excellent help and service. Nanjing Shangri-La is shining because of everyone here!
See you next time! Shangri-La will always be my first choice!

msg:When traveling to Nanjing, I had the opportunity to stay at Xiaoxiang, which is about 3 minutes away from the subway entrance. It is very convenient for this congested Nanjing. Although it is an older hotel, it is well maintained as a whole and not obviously shabby. Check-in is very fast, and each guest has a small gift, a beautiful bird brooch, which the children like very much! When I checked in at night, I just caught up with the performance of the Ukrainian singer in the lobby bar on the first floor at 9 o'clock. It was very interactive and the a**osphere was very good! The only bad thing during the stay was breakfast. On the first day, I went down to the 2nd floor and just got out of the elevator. I was forcibly guided to the 5th floor by the service staff. I saw that the specifications and food were not in line with the version. I asked and told that there were too many people to divert! First of all, did you ask the guests for their opinions if you diverted? Secondly, it doesn’t matter if the diverted restaurant is in place, the key is not in place! There is no seasoning at the old duck soup, and I don’t know that the jam at the bread was mixed with the taste of the naughty child. I didn’t see anyone clean up until the meal was finished. The last watermelon was even more excessive, the color was dark red, and the taste in the middle was directly that kind of soft and glutinous. I called the waiter, and before I could say anything, he immediately knew the problem and explained that the ice had been frozen for a long time, and the quality of the food was the problem. After the meal, I complained, and the hotel called several times to explain and apologize. To be honest, I often stay in Xiaoxiang all over the country, but this is the first time I have encountered a hotel like this one. I can't blame all the problems on others. During the holidays, there are more guests, and the hotel doesn't know? The guests also pay more for this than usual, and then the return is a lower service. It feels like it's all their own fault!

The Huaiyang cuisine of "Jiangnan Stove" is also good, fresh and sweet, worth a try. I will choose Shangri-La next time~

Because the weather is a bit dry, they gave us fruits. They are very attentive and the service is very good every day. The service staff at the front desk and the restaurant are very good and polite.

msg:Let me first say the conclusion. Shangri-La Hotel Nanjing is definitely my first choice in Nanjing. If I come to Nanjing again next time, I will definitely stay there. Later, because the experience of Shangri-La Nanjing was so perfect, if there is Shangri-La in my subsequent travel itinerary, I will choose Shangri-La without thinking. 
￼This time I stayed there because of my child’s birthday. The budget was limited and the schedule was tight, so I chose a common twin room with a relatively high cost-effectiveness on weekdays. Then, when I called in advance, the customer service knew that I had a child’s birthday, so they upgraded me for free. Thank you very much. The two people who contacted me were Kay and Lily. The manager who helped me upgrade was Zohar. In addition, when I called in advance to confirm all the details, the customer service had already noted all my needs, including that I would need a baby bed for a child, and that we needed a foot of a twin bed, as well as some toiletries. When I arrived, I found that not only were there professionals, but all the configurations had been completed, and all the details had been taken into consideration, including putting the twin beds together to give us a relatively appropriate location for all personnel. These humanized services made me feel that the beginning of the entire Nanjing trip was full of sincerity and great anticipation, which instantly made me have a good impression of Nanjing.
At the same time, because I also ordered some cakes and dinner at the Jiangnan breakfast restaurant downstairs, they also helped me make some related contacts at the same time. Then in many subsequent services, we couldn’t eat the birthday cake we brought ourselves because the dishes at Jiangnan Kitchen were so delicious. When we finished eating and checked out, the guest room and Jiangnan Zao were linked to help me handle all my cakes. We ate very intact and fresh cakes in the guest room the next day. This kind of thoughtful service that was delivered directly to the room without any problems, I have never seen it in other hotels. Because the experience was so good, we extended our stay for another day. Then, Yang Dan, the housekeeping manager, didn't know that we had been to Hongshan Zoo for a whole day, and she prepared sweet soup and snacks for us for two consecutive days, as well as fruits for us to recharge and relax after going out. Thank you so much. When we checked out, we also gave two little unicorns and two small brooches to our baby and our whole family. We were all very moved at the time. The scenery in Nanjing is indeed very pleasant, and the food is also very good, but I think the most satisfying thing about the whole trip to Nanjing and the biggest motivation for me to come back in the future is the high-quality service provided by Nanjing Shangri-La Hotel. Even in parent-child hotels in Shanghai, I have not felt such a level of quality.

There was also another small episode. In the middle of the night, the child was jumping too happily by the window in the big room, so he vomited some milk on the bed. Less than 3 minutes after I called the front desk, at 11:30 in the evening, the room customer service attendants Tong Suli and Tong Qunfang immediately knocked on the door of our room and changed the clean sheets. They also gave us a lot of small supplies that the child needed for discomfort, and even told us that if the child still had any discomfort, we could say hello to him while seeing a doctor, and he would have some other professional building services to help us deal with it at the same time, which made us feel very relieved. At the same time, they introduced many local characteristics of Nanjing in the process of daily communication, including food and scenery, as well as some tips for traveling during the morning rush hour, which made us feel very at home.

This Shangri-La in Nanjing is really amazing👍The five-star hotel service is fully realized, absolutely 100 points. From the moment I got off the car at the hotel, I felt the warm reception of the concierge at the door, and I felt at home. The service brothers and sisters on the 40th floor of the executive floor were also impeccable, very attentive and enthusiastic. Great! The hotel is very convenient to any scenic spot. Xuanwu Lake is just next to it and less than 10 minutes walk. In short, 100 points, I will stay here next time

The lunch buffet on the second floor has a decent variety and tastes good. They also gave you a small gift brooch when you left the store, which was very cute.

Overall, it was a good experience. I would consider Shangri-La when booking a hotel in the future.

The water in the indoor heated swimming pool is relatively comfortable, and people will not feel the kind of adaptation feeling of trembling all over when entering the water. There are indoor hot water and dry and wet steaming, so both children can enjoy it to their heart's content [strong] Nanjing Shangri-La also has a check-in project on the rooftop helipad, with a 360-degree view of the Yangtze River Xuanwu Lake and CBD city landscape. The breakfast is very rich, with a variety of Jiangnan snacks, whether it is duck blood vermicelli soup or steamed dumplings, it is not inferior to the popular restaurants outside, and you can eat enough at one time [strong] There is also a small children's slide at the restaurant location, and it is equipped with clown balloon toys and cotton candy, perfect!
I used to have an obsessive-compulsive disorder for offline execution, and I saw that they really spent a lot of manpower (in addition to the staff in the lobby, there were six additional staff) in the lobby and restaurant areas to ensure that any small needs of everyone during the check-in stage can be responded to immediately, so that you can feel very relieved and fully satisfied the first moment you contact the hotel, without having to wait for immediate satisfaction [strong]
(Although it sounds like a public relations article, it is indeed my personal feelings [tears burst into laughter])

Breakfast: Shangri-La's Western pastries are really delicious, but unfortunately there are no small cakes, only Danish pastries, which is a bit regrettable. The mid-points are also great, freshly made soup dumplings and pan-fried beef dumplings, which bring back endless memories in one bite! There is also tofu brain and duck blood vermicelli soup, which are also very good! It's a pity that there is no spicy soup

msg:I have been to Nanjing several times, but this is my first time staying at Shangri-La Hotel Nanjing, and I had a good experience. The hotel is strategically located on the shore of Xuanwu Lake with convenient transportation. It only takes more than ten minutes to get to the hotel by taxi from Nanjing Station. There is a subway station downstairs, which is very convenient to various attractions. The Deluxe Lake View Room I booked this time overlooks the entire lake, which is refreshing. The hotel lobby is magnificent, and the design styles of the elevator room, restaurant, and guest rooms are elegant and modern. During my stay, the hotel staff I came into contact with always provided guests with warm and thoughtful services. The day before check-in, Ms. Lin Fanglu, director of the hotel's guest relations depar**ent, also called to ask if there were any requirements and would try to meet them. When checking in, the front desk lady Li Xiang was warm and considerate, and prepared a room on a high floor with a good view for me. When arriving at the hotel and leaving the hotel, the waiters were very proactive in greeting, opening and closing the car doors, and assisting in carrying luggage. The second-floor breakfast is very rich in variety, with fresh ingredients, and provides a variety of local specialties and snacks. Soup dumplings, purple rice balls, etc. are made on the spot, and the taste is great. The duck blood vermicelli soup is also delicious. Deputy Director of Food and Beverage Depar**ent Zhang Pingyuan and handsome young man Wang Shuaijie provided warm and thoughtful service. The executive lounge on the 40th floor of the hotel is also quite classy. You can overlook the Xuanwu Lake and Jinling City while dining and drinking tea. The hotel is perfect in terms of service details, surpassing most five-star hotels of the same level. In short, I was very satisfied with this stay. There are still many places that have not been described and experienced, and they are waiting to be discovered again in the future. It is certain that I will choose Shangri-La next time I come to Nanjing.

It was originally a 32-floor luxury pavilion, but I couldn't accept that when I opened the curtains, I was facing the business building, and there was no view at all. After requesting a change, it was not upgraded, but moved to a lower floor... I don't know what they were thinking. I want to praise Master Zhu, the master of the swimming pool. I went there on the 29th. I haven't swam for a long time, and my movements are slow. He patiently guided me on the shore and was very enthusiastic.

The supervisor Jiang Shupeng patiently and carefully explained the various details of the courtesy and specially upgraded us. Jiang also helped to successfully book Jiangnan Zao for dinner! The next day, when we checked out before leaving the hotel, he didn't forget to bring us some small desserts to eat on the way, and even a souvenir for each person. The thoughtful service attitude impressed me deeply. I will definitely come again next time. I strongly recommend Jiangnan Zao!

When I was having breakfast, I saw that the lights above my head seemed to need someone to clean them. Housekeep was very enthusiastic and the service was also good. Thank you very much.

The guest room had large floor-to-ceiling windows and a large bathtub. After a full breakfast, I went to the scenic spot to walk around, and went back to the hotel to take a bath and sleep. It was a perfect holiday life. The children liked the broth dumplings and marshmallows for breakfast and the four-story swimming pool the most. The hotel is very close to Xuanwu Lake. I didn't know I went around the park gate on the first day. On the way back, I found a small door very close to the hotel, which was very convenient.

msg:I have to complain about this old five-star hotel. I booked a parent-child room when I was traveling with my baby. As a result, I was given the last room next to the elevator. I could not sleep due to the buzzing sound all night long! Even though the room was small (the TV was pathetically small), there were no windows in the whole room, and there was no exhaust fan even in the bathroom. It was so stuffy and suffocating all night that the children were crying out of boredom, ugh! As a five-star hotel, the mineral water is actually 1.5 Pure Joy. . Haha~ At least it deserves a centenarian mountain! Featured item: Check in at the helipad on the top floor. As a result, the weather was beautiful and we stopped visiting and taking photos due to rain. OK, let’s take the baby to the constant-temperature swimming pool. My mom, the indoor temperature didn’t even reach 20 degrees, and the water temperature was even colder. I was so scared that I hurried away. I thought about going to the children's playground on the 5th floor to play, but it turned out that it was raining outside and I couldn't play. The indoor one was said to be closed, and I couldn't go in after get off work at 5 o'clock. I am speechless! I had to take the baby to stay in the room to breathe carbon dioxide! ! The room fee of more than 1,000 yuan is really not worth it. The decoration has not been upgraded at all, and there is no electric toilet! Beer and juice in the small refrigerator are chargeable! The welcome fruits and snacks I redeemed with Ctrip points were of poor quality! ! Hey, if I had known that the quality of Shangri-La would be inferior to that of Staying at All Seasons or Atour! ! It’s really far worse than the Shangri-La Hotel in Sanya! !

Facilities: Check in to Jiangnan Zao on the first floor. There are so many people that the queue will take more than 2 hours. It is said that there are usually many.

Attentive and thoughtful👍

Traveling is very convenient. Turn left when you go out and there is a subway station next to it🚇 Line 1 can go directly or transfer to other lines to reach most attractions. It is only one stop away from Nanjing Station🚄 This time the room is on the 37th floor and you can see Xuanwu Lake and Zifeng Building. The weather was fine during the Chinese New Year days🌞 I watched the sunrise in the room in the morning. In the evening, I saw the sunset in Nanjing from the rooftop apron. Kevin Hu, the security manager who accompanied the tour, provided very good service. He not only introduced various attractions and directions in Nanjing, gave a lot of travel suggestions, but also helped find angles to take photos📷

Free minibar drinks for the first round in the room🍹🍺 There are also welcome fruits🍎🍊New Year candy and chocolate🍬🍫 Various tea bags and capsule coffee🍵☕️ The Jiangnan Zao on the first floor of the hotel is very popular🔥 Get a number at DP at 3:30 pm🕞 , I waited until 7:30 in the evening🕢 to eat it... After eating it, it tasted really good🉑️ The braised pork and soft drunken crabs were delicious😋 In comparison, the breakfast buffet on the second floor was quite average, and the food I ate every day was the same.

This kind of trea**ent far exceeded our expectations and made us feel unparalleled dignity and comfort. We were deeply impressed by the suite's large space, exquisite decoration and meticulous service.
We heard that even music superstar Jacky Cheung had stayed here, which made our stay even more special. We feel extremely honored and happy to experience such supreme service.
Thank you for creating such an unforgettable stay for us. In the future, whenever and wherever we have the opportunity, we will definitely choose to stay at Shangri-La Hotel and recommend your high-quality services to our relatives and friends.
Thank you again and look forward to meeting you next time.

msg:It was my first time to stay at Shangri-La and the experience was particularly good. I booked a Horizon Club suite. I received a call in advance to ask what the requirements were. I asked what requirements I could choose? 😆 The service desk said that the floor should be higher, so I said, let’s go on a higher floor! After checking in, I found that it was a non-smoking room. I enjoyed a free simple dinner on the 40th floor of the Horizon Club. The telephone service desk was changed to a smoking room. I was told that after dinner, I could just change my room card on the 40th floor. It was really very user-friendly! There is a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea and simple dinner on the 40th floor. You can enjoy all three meals for free when you check in. The scenery is unparalleled and you can have a panoramic view of the entire Xuanwu Lake. The price/performance ratio is very high!
       Let’s talk about the dishes. For breakfast, you can also go to the coffee show on the second floor. It is more lively and has many choices. The soup dumplings taste great. The aunt will count down the seconds to the waiting customers to see when the soup dumplings will be released🤣. Duck blood vermicelli soup is also popular. The duck liver is very fishy and the duck blood is very fresh. The egg rolls are delicious, and the sun-cooked eggs are also great👍🏻! The breakfast on the 40th floor is fancier and the coffee tastes better. I personally experienced it. They have eggs Benedict, but I have a suggestion. The sauce is not sour enough and will make it greasy. Smoked salmon is sometimes available for breakfast, which is really great value for money! If you order Xiaolong or something, you have to go downstairs to the chef to get it. It’s not as hot as downstairs😊
       There are also charging piles in the parking lot, which are shared with the free parking. We can slowly charge it at night and unplug it in the morning, so there is no need to wait! The equipment in the room is very good. There is a high-speed hair dryer. You can get a bath bag at the front desk. My aunt also gave me an extra set of toiletries. The mini bar is free for the first round. The only drawback is that the toilet is not a smart toilet and the bathroom in the smoking room is Not worthy of convulsions either.
       At the front desk the next day, the girl at the reception, Lin Fanglu, had a very good service attitude. She helped us make an appoin**ent to watch the sunrise on the tarmac for the third day. She carefully checked the sunrise time for us and made an appoin**ent for the early wake-up call service. It was very nice. Thank her! When I checked out, I found that the room booked by Ctrip could not be used to earn Shangri-La points, so they gave me an exquisite brooch as a gift🎁Thank you again!
       I was very happy staying here for two nights. I will choose Shangri-La again next time!

The food is very good: the exclusive privileges of the Horizon Club VIP Lounge provide free afternoon tea and breakfast, and you can enjoy the panoramic view of Xuanwu Lake while drinking coffee. It is beautiful; Jiangnan Zao on the first floor is used as the Black Pearl Hotel, which is convenient for reservations and tastes very good; there is also a free mini bar in the first round
Location: Line 1, Xinmofanma Road Station, Exit 1, turn right and walk 50 meters, one stop from Nanjing Station and 12 stops from Nanjing South Railway Station; to go to the Nanjing Museum, you need to transfer to Line 2 to the old gate of Confucius Temple, then turn east to Line 3; at the entrance You can take a taxi.

One drawback is that the water in the shower room will flow out when taking a shower, and the sealing is not very good, but I will stay here again if I have the chance.

msg:Our experience at the Shangri-la Nanjing Hotel was incredible!
The hotel staff were very very friendly, helpful and professional. We would especially like to highlight the reception staff as well as the housekeeping staff. They were very attentive and meticulous.
They respectfully brought fresh fruit to the room every day and welcomed us with an impeccably clean room.

The hotel's breakfast is very varied, you can find a Western part but especially Asian cuisine, offering dim sums which were delicious! The hotel also serves noodle soups, breads stuffed with meat, vegetables and red beans. There is also a choice of seasonal fruits, small traditional dishes, a wide choice of desserts and it never ends :)

The various restaurants in the hotel also left a good impression on us. We found the Jiang Nan Wok tasty tasty tasty! And we had an unforgettable experience at Jin Hot Pot! You can choose either a pot to share or an individual pot and make a varied choice of fresh ingredients.

The entire hotel decor is beautiful welcoming you with vibrant fresh orchids in the lobby.
The hotel entrance is very spacious which allows easy access for arriving and departing guests.

Many events are organized in the establishment such as weddings and conferences, etc.

Shangri-la Nanjing we thank you for your warm welcome which allowed us to have an even more wonderful stay while visiting the city of Nanjing!
We will definitely come back as soon as we return to China! And you made us want to experience the Shangri-la chain around the world!

Thanks to the entire Shangri-la Nanjing team!

The hardware decoration of the hotel is a bit old, but it can be seen that it is still maintained with great care. In particular, Shangri-La has always been known for its good service. This time, the service was as good as ever during my stay. The hotel service staff have very good attitudes. In particular, Manager Zhang, the check-in lobby manager of the hotel, although there was a little hiccup in room coordination, it was solved very well. In particular, we were able to go up to the hotel apron and overlook the sunset over Jinling City, and taste the dishes from Black Pearl Two Star Jiangnan Zao, which were delicious. Attended the hotel's New Year's Eve reception in the evening. The whole stay was a pleasure. I will consider it next time I come to Nanjing.

You can see Xuanwu Lake from the floor-to-ceiling windows, which is worth recommending. The only thing is that the hotel shower head is a bit loose, and the bathroom is full of water if you don't hold it. There was also a small gift from the young lady when I checked out, which was very happy!

The hotel has a strategic location, beautiful environment, convenient parking, and is within walking distance to Xuanwu Lake. The hotel facilities are well maintained, the rooms are clean and tidy, and the sound insulation is good. From the floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see Xuanwu Lake at a glance. The view and dining environment of the executive lounge are very good. The hotel's service is impressive. Every staff member I meet is warm and polite. The warm service makes people feel at home. This was a pleasant stay experience. I will choose Shangri-La Hotel again when I come to Nanjing again. Recommended👍🏻

msg:I chose a lake view room. When the weather is clear, the scenery is good, and the night view is also OK, but it faces Xuanwu Lake from the side, not directly.
It is very close to Hongshan Zoo. If you want to go to the zoo in Nanjing, you can choose this hotel directly. Transportation and other facilities are also very convenient.

Facilities: There are capsule coffee machines and various tea bags, but there are no coffee cups of corresponding sizes. The cups can be more particular; the TV is not a smart TV and cannot be cast. The equipment can be upgraded in the future.

Hygiene: Although it was built a long time ago, it is well maintained. The room facilities are clean and hygienic. The only thing that needs improvement is that it would be better if there were more towels. I feel that the towels are not enough.

Service: Check-in is very fast, there is basically no need to wait, the welcome fruit will be delivered after check-in, and the quality of the fruit is good.

Environment: It’s approaching Chris**as. There is a big Chris**as tree at the door. The overall layout of the lobby is pretty good, simple and elegant. The sound insulation is relatively good. Even if the floor is high, you will not be disturbed by the sound of speakers downstairs.

msg:I specially booked a deluxe lake view room in order to see the lake. When I arrived at the hotel at two o'clock, I asked again that I wanted a room with a better lake view. I waited until a set of 3708 was packed up before checking in. As a result, the desk faced a building under construction, the living room faced three buildings, and the bathroom was more direct. Is this a good view of the lake? It's not a holiday, so I can't believe I couldn't choose a room with a front view of the lake. It was originally cloudy and rainy, but it was too windy when we went to the tarmac at night, so we stayed there for five minutes. There is a cocktail hour for the executive trea**ent in the evening and I was not reminded when I checked in. Go to the swimming pool and start bathing early. The breakfast on the 40th floor is very average, and there is no Nanjing style at all. It is better to go to the large restaurant on the first floor, which also has big soup dumplings. Knowing that it is an old hotel, I don’t have high expectations for the facilities, but the soft service is really not good. Instead of just smiling on the face, can I communicate as a guest?

msg:The overall experience of staying in the hotel is good, the scenery outside the window is great, and the overall service is also very good. The old five-star hotel deserves its title. I especially want to mention the restaurant under the hotel. It’s so delicious. If I’m a foodie, I’ll close my eyes and enjoy it. I’m satisfied with every dish. Highly recommended!
But there are some small problems, I hope the hotel can make more improvements: 1. There are too few charging ports in the room, so I ended up looking everywhere for a place to plug in.
2. The hotel has a special helipad for visiting. Since it is a special feature, it should be more convenient for guests. As a result, the visiting time is not friendly at all, so it is 7 o'clock in the morning (come on, it is not very bright in winter), or 4 o'clock in the afternoon (that is to say, you can't come back from that time when you go out for fun😰) I hope the hotel can increase the time slot, and I hope I can make up for this regret next time I go there.

It seems that because the heat of summer lasted a little longer this year, the late autumn of Nanjing came a little late. The ginkgo is half yellow and half green, and the red leaves are not yet red. It is not lost even with the blessing of the sun. The charm is that Nanjing changes into Jinling in autumn. You can reach various scenic spots by subway from Shangri-La. Take the little yellow duck to Jinling to experience the simplicity and romance of the Republic of China. Customize a Horizon Club room and return to the hotel for a worry-free meal in the evening. Suitable for travelers who don’t need to check out Internet celebrity food everywhere 😀 Thanks again to the meticulous room manager Yang Dan and the cleaning lady Qunfang, as well as the security guard Zhang Siqi who led us to experience the tarmac at 6:30 in the morning. I don’t know if I’m asking the right question. I got my name😛, and when I left the store, I had already started decorating the Chris**as decorations. Looking forward to seeing you again🌹

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, right next to Xuanwu Lake. Be sure to stay in the Horizon Club Premier Lake View Room, which is on the 30th floor or above. You can see the sunrise over Xuanwu Lake while lying on the bed. You can also reserve the helipad to watch the sunset. The best value is The sunrise and sunset are beautiful, and the breakfast and cocktail hours in the executive lounge on the 40th floor are also very good.
Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained and clean, and the service staff are also very enthusiastic. On the last night, they even gave us white fungus soup and a handwritten card. Thank you!
In addition, there are a few details. When I first booked the room, I only booked one adult and one child. Later, the itinerary changed and I added an adult. The hotel asked for more than 100 yuan per night. Then when I arrived at the hotel, although I had noted that I wanted a high-rise hotel, I still arranged ten For a room on multiple floors, if you want a high-rise, you will have to pay an extra 180 per night. After talking to the hotel for a long time, I finally got a free upgrade without any charge. The third time was for breakfast on the second floor for children, which cost more than 70. We stayed in other hotels or other places. Shangri-La has never encountered this situation. We understand that hotel staff must abide by their procedures, but it is not good for an old five-star hotel to have to temporarily add money several times in a row. It is better to make the price more expensive from the beginning. I hope the hotel can Improve to give customers a better check-in experience

The service is very good, and you can see Xuanwu Lake at a glance. The breakfast is rich and the xiaolongbao is delicious. The subway station is also very close. Just turn left when you go out. The transportation is convenient. Give small gifts when you leave. The hotel has already started to get into the Chris**as a**osphere.

msg:I arrived relatively late the night before yesterday, and the front office staff effectively guided us to the parking lot downstairs. After coming up to the parking lot, I was greeted by a burst of fragrance. I asked the front desk staff if this was the hotel's unique aromatherapy smell. There is a statue on the left side of the hall that is very cute and full of artistic appeal. There are a lot of snacks on the porch when you check in. There is a Ukrainian band performing in the bar on the first floor next to it, and the music a**osphere is great. All floors are decorated with fresh flowers, which gives an impression of vitality. We were given a lake view floor, so you could enjoy the view in the morning and evening. The room was fully equipped with just the right supplies, and I had a good sleep. The packages offered by the hotel, especially the spa, are very cost-effective. After making a reservation in advance at the rooftop helipad, we arrived under the leadership of a handsome security man, overlooking the scenic Jinling scenery and helping to take photos. The reception in the morning was polite, the male and female waiters were reasonably matched, the staffing was adequate and attentive, and the variety was rich. After eating, four people at the card counter at the door on the second floor said they were very happy to take a slow walk. After dinner, take a walk in the outdoor garden. The air is fresh and very pleasant. Fruit and moon cakes were given during the stay. Will stay here next time.

msg:Every time I book a reservation at Shangri-La, I am extremely confused.
The location is really good,
The hardware is really old.
But coupled with the soft services of the Horizon Club, the price/performance ratio is indeed very high.

Room facilities:
The Horizon Club Lake View Room I booked this time was originally advertised as showing a 270° incomparable lake view. After checking in, I didn’t expect that it was facing the construction building, which was very unpleasant. The key is that the hotel staff communicated with me on the phone the day before I arrived at the hotel, and they did not mention this issue. Thinking that I had been playing outside for the past two days and didn't have much time in the hotel, I didn't ask to change rooms. But I don’t believe that Shangri-La’s service staff could not imagine such service details. They just have the mentality that they can sell every house.


Value for money:
The room rate includes Horizon Club breakfast, afternoon tea, and dinner. It’s very suitable for people like us who don’t want to check into any internet celebrity restaurants and just want to eat quietly. The coffee-dazzling breakfast is richer than that of the Horizon Club, but it's a bit noisy. The service in the restaurant was very good.

Hygiene and landscape are very good! The breakfast at the Horizon Club was also good. After taking a walk in the garden, I felt much happier! The dinner buffet is also rich in variety. Since it was late to get the room card yesterday afternoon, the manager learned about the flight the next night and delayed check-out until the afternoon, which was more humane. Thank you very much! The first trip to Nanjing came to a successful conclusion! Hope to see you next time at Shangri-La!

He proactively informed us that the palm mattress in the room had been changed according to the check-in request. He also reminded that the Chinese restaurant in the hotel was crowded on weekends, so if necessary, You can go to the nearby Nanjing Snack Street to dine (especially recommend the Maojia dumplings that are loved by the locals). After check-in, the floor attendant also took the initiative to introduce the service enthusiastically. The check-in fruit was very good and the mineral water requirement was met according to my request. You can enjoy the beautiful view of Xuanwu Lake and the scenery of the main city from the room.

msg:The quilt cover looked like it had been used for too long and had holes in it. The quality of the slippers is very poor. They are open-toed ones, so your toes will hit the ground directly when walking. The soles are very thin, and they make a very harsh sound when walking in the bathroom. There were hairs on the quilt, the room had a connecting door, and the sound insulation was very poor. Later, when I changed rooms, I found that the slippers were different. Although the quality was still poor, at least they were normal slippers with toes covered. A five-star hotel actually treats a pair of tattered slippers differently. I am really speechless. I have never worn such lousy slippers. You can imagine how much better other things would be. The greeter at the door didn't help with the luggage. Later, a foreigner got out of the car and quickly helped with it. Maybe this is how the hotel is trained, and I can't blame the staff. However, the staff at the call center are relatively professional and solve problems quickly, which is a good comment. This is my first time staying at Shangri-La. I quickly canceled Shangri-La at my next destination and decided to stay with Marriott.

msg:This time I went back to Nanjing and chose "Nanjing Shangri-La Hotel" among the many five-star hotels. Firstly, because I have always had a good impression of the Shangri-La brand; secondly, because of its superior geographical location. Facts prove that the choice is correct [strong]
        First of all, it is located on the north bank of Xuanwu Lake. Turn left when you go out and you will reach the Xuanwu Lake Tunnel. The main roads from east to west, north and south meet here, which can be said to be connected in all directions. Because it is not far from the main attractions, we stopped driving after staying at the hotel (the underground parking lot is free for hotel guests) and took a taxi (the taxi is very easy to hail). It was very convenient to get in and out.
        Secondly, the environment is quite beautiful, despite being located in a downtown area. It has an independent small garden with red flowers and green grass; it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the Xuanwu Lake; you can see the lake and mountains (Purple Mountain) from the high-rise buildings on the side of the lake.
        Again, it feels very comfortable to live in. We stayed in a lake-view king room on the 22nd floor. It was quite large and had good sound insulation. The room could be partitioned off with a sliding door to form a one-bedroom-one-living room. The huge floor-to-ceiling windows faced the lake (slightly blocked), and the view was wide and quiet. .
        The entire hotel's catering should also be a strong point: there are five restaurants of different styles on the first, second, fifth, and two floors above the 40th floor. The dinner in the buffet restaurant on the second floor is very cost-effective; the large terrace next to the hot pot restaurant on the fifth floor is impressive; the VIP lounge on the 40th floor has a first-class view and a rich wine list.
        Of course, what impressed me the most was Shangri-La’s service: due to an unexpected situation, I was able to witness the efficient communication and professionalism between the front office, catering depar**ent, and guest room depar**ent. It was gratifying and admirable👍, and showed the relationship with The service level is consistent with the brand image.
        Overall, satisfied [strong]!

msg:I stayed in Shangri-La for four nights during this vacation. I had a lake view room on the 36th floor. The scenery was beautiful. The elderly and children were very satisfied. Fruit was delivered to the room every day, and gifts were given at check-in and check-out. The breakfast is also very rich. The three of us can find our own favorite food, and the children can also consciously act on the disc. We participated in the parent-child activities in the afternoon for two days, and the children also enjoyed it, which briefly liberated the adults👩
It’s very convenient to order various Nanjing specialty takeaways to the hotel, and it goes well with the first round of beer in the minibar. We often go to the first floor to listen to band performances and order two glasses of juice or mojita. It’s a very comfortable and relaxing holiday.

The sound from the air conditioning vents and the construction outside are combined, making the noise loud. The view outside the window is as shown in the picture. It may have been a very busy day during the holidays, and the children lacked toothbrushes. I waited for a long time before urging them again before getting them. During the National Day, there are more than 1,600 such rooms, and the price/performance ratio is very low.

Breakfast: A combination of Chinese and Western cuisine, with rich and varied varieties. I had the duck blood and vermicelli soup, which was pretty good!
Check-in tarmac: Although it is quite common, it is also rare to see on the top floor of the hotel.
Surroundings: Across the road is Xuanwu Lake, there is a shopping mall, 2 stops to the zoo, and several other famous attractions can be reached by subway.
Regret: The scenery outside the window is a construction site

After putting on makeup, there was a box of beautiful snacks inside. The children were so happy when they saw the little duck in the bathroom😊. The internal swimming pool is also good. There is also a steam room inside. The service from the floor aunt was also good. When we got to the room, she was already greeting us with smiles. Several bottles of water were waiting, and it felt very warm, including adding a quilt at night, and the aunt who gave it to me was smiling. When we went to the tarmac, there was a handsome security manager named Hu Kun who was wearing sunglasses and looked very cool. The service was quite good and he would help take photos😊. I couldn’t choose what to eat for breakfast. I walked around a few times and found nothing I particularly liked, so I had to eat whatever I wanted. , I was given a small gift when I checked out. This is the advantage of staying in a five-star hotel. I personally feel that it is generally good.

msg:When I checked in, the front desk introduced me to a 36th-floor Horizon Club Premier Lake View Room, so I chose to upgrade. This is a suite room with a much better view. It avoids the tall buildings next to it to a large extent and is well worth the upgrade.
The executive lounge on the 40th floor has a better view. The afternoon tea and evening cocktail hors d'oeuvres are unlimited and of good quality. If you don't want to have dinner, the cocktails and salads here are enough.
I made an appoin**ent to check in at the 17:30 Internet celebrity parking lot. It is on the 46th floor. Due to safety issues, we cannot get close to the building. Therefore, the scenery here is not as good as the restaurant on the 42nd floor, the lounge on the 40th floor and the guest rooms. In order to blow the wind on the roof, after all, few roofs are open to the public. If you bring aerial photography equipment, it will be different.
Because it was rainy and foggy today, only our family chose to go up there. I walked around for more than half an hour. Security officer Wu Xinyu accompanied me throughout the whole process and was very patient and attentive. Because there was no view due to the heavy fog, Wu Xinyu was still on the roof of the building. Thank you very much for explaining to us Nanjing’s attractions, the directions of major traffic arteries, urban development, etc.
The guest room is very quiet and the service is very attentive. The waiter Xiao Xia proactively replenished coffee, tea bags and other supplies for us in a timely manner.
The Shangri-La brand is displayed here. Needless to say, the hygiene of the rooms, the quality of the supplies, and the supporting facilities are all top-notch.
At noon on the last day, the sky finally cleared up and the fog dissipated a bit, giving us a better view. It was a worthwhile trip.

In the morning, I made an appoin**ent with an Internet celebrity to check in at the helipad. I took some photos overlooking Nanjing from a high altitude and experienced the joy of helicopter transportation for rich people. After taking the photo, we just went to have a buffet breakfast. Let’s have a bowl of Laoya Vermicelli Soup first!
After eating, I passed by the lobby and saw the staff changing flowers in the lobby. The fragrance of the flowers was so fragrant that I started the day in a good mood!
Manager Shen on duty was very warm and friendly, and even gave me a small gift at the end.
I can’t say what’s particularly stunning about it, but it’s full of details that make you feel happy.

2. The glass door of the shower door is faulty, which poses a safety hazard and cannot be closed. The rainwater spilled all over the place outside, which was unsafe.
3. The restaurant on the first floor of the hotel is not friendly to guests at all. I couldn't get a seat at all in advance, so I made an appoin**ent at 5pm and didn't get a seat until around 9pm. We made an appoin**ent at 11:10 noon and didn’t eat until 13:30. If it does not provide the supporting facilities of the service hotel, you should consider moving out.
4. When checking in, I told the front desk that the room I stayed in on the first day was different from the room I stayed in on the second day. Can I adjust it? I was informed that it was not possible! There was no way to move the room the next day, and the room card was not given until 16:30 in the afternoon. Keep waiting and delay your trip for a day. Bad review!
I have been to many Shangri-Las, and the service in Shenzhen and Hong Kong is the best! The ones in Guangzhou and Chongqing are also very good! Nanjing is really hard to describe! I won’t consider it next time.

msg:No, very bad. I had to wait for half an hour at the front desk after I arrived. There were only two people in front of me, and they were together. I don’t know how long it will take to check in. The front desk seemed to be in a bad state of mind. I saw it was Ctrip When I booked it, I just said, "Oh? Booked it with Ctrip? Or is it a standard room?" I had to sneer because my family members were not from **************, so I was treated with an extremely weird attitude throughout the whole process, without any precautions or instructions. Wherever the elevator is, just hand over the card and fend for yourself.
The service attitude of the hotel was a big problem, so I quickly moved to another hotel. It was also a five-star hotel. Others could help carry luggage and open and close car doors, but Shangri-La couldn't do that. They didn't say anything and the scope of services was unclear.
The coupons and activities on Ctrip are no different. The gift box will not be given to you unless I tell you, just because I am afraid you will ask. If you don’t ask the front desk, it will not be given to you. The parking lot must be reserved one day in advance, and it only opens at 7 am. When you can't even get up, if you can't go, you deserve to be the unjust one.
I just finished the buffet on the second floor and wanted to sit in the dessert seating area. The waiter rushed over and told me that I couldn’t sit until I ordered. He asked me to sit on the stool in the lobby like a beggar. I couldn’t sit on the balcony for a second. I just arrived at your hotel. I was so full after the meal that I couldn't even sit down. There was no one around. Is there an outsourcing shop inside this window? You pay for a hotel room together and get nothing. The price is five-star and the quality of a low-quality B&B. I guess they often bully tourists from out of town. They pick and choose which one is nice. Compared to other hotels of the same level. He said that unless the consumer has never seen a hotel in his life or is stupid, it is impossible to choose this hotel, because this hotel does not have a very good impression of Nanjing. If he had not changed his hotel, he would have really wanted to leave directly.
The hotel did not indicate which ones were free and which ones were charged, nor did it say that it was deliberately guiding consumption behavior. It was just a terrible experience and not worth the price. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life. Just wait and see.
The room was very unsightly. There was nothing to see, only the construction site. It cost more than 1,000 yuan to see a construction site, and it was so close. I might as well just let the guests stay at the construction site. I really don’t know where the good reviews came from. Poor location, poor service, and guided consumption. , there were only a few people there, but they still grabbed every guest, and the supplies were not brand-name. It was the most shabby and worst hotel I have ever stayed in! I guess the front desk also thought that only ** would choose to stay in this kind of hotel, so I smiled like that. I was very disappointed, permanently blocked, and protected from lightning! The perspective picture is here. The front desk said with a weird smile that this is the best room. It doesn’t matter if you can’t understand the text. The picture is more straightforward. There are people on the upper floors opposite. The wrongdoer must go to the store. There are beggars on the street outside the door. People are drunk and messing around. Collide.

The beautiful young lady in the lobby on the first floor is also very enthusiastic and patient, answering every question. I booked an executive lake view room. I didn’t expect that the first thing I saw when I entered the room was the China Central Place construction site next to the hotel. It’s still so close that the sound of construction can be heard clearly, and the windows are still facing the hotel. Sleeping on a big bed, I decisively offered to add money to change the room. The answer was yes, but I had to wait for 1 hour. After waiting for 2 hours, I was told that I could change the room. The window next to the sofa and the bathroom can see the city wall of the Ming Dynasty and the view of Xuanwu Lake. The scenery is not bad. The overall area of ​​the executive room is relatively large, and there are double basins in the bathroom, but the highest temperature of the hot water for bathing is not very hot, which affects the bathing🛀. The breakfast style is very simple, but the quality and service attitude are not up to the five-star standard. The aunt of the Xiaolongtangbao doesn't like to answer questions, but the Xiaolongtangbao she makes tastes really good, and the only recommendation in the breakfast. Breakfast ended at 10:30, and the bacon was gone by 10:00. When I asked when it would be new, there was no answer, and I was speechless. The environmental facilities and landscape of the executive lounge are very good, but the quality of the food is really mediocre. There are very few light meals in the evening. I took a bite of the cantaloupe and gave up. I didn’t taste the sweetness. There are few desserts, and the coffee tastes good. The only thing that reflects the quality of Shangri-La's service is Manager Hu who has been accompanying us during the check-in on the hotel apron. He offered to help take pictures for us. The photos he took were also very satisfactory, and he enthusiastically introduced us to the city landscape.

Very unprofessional. When I checked out the next day, I looked at the bill, and the price of coconut water was also different from what was said at the time.

The view from the window of the hotel room is good, you can see Xuanwu Lake. The supervisor Yang Dan and Zhang Aihong and Tong Suli who cleaned the room also provided excellent service, and they also gave evening desserts. I also went to check in at the apron on the top floor of the hotel. Thank you, Manager Hu Kun, for taking a group photo with our family and explaining patiently. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose Shangri-La.

msg:I went to Nanjing without doing any strategy. The accommodation spots are all randomly selected. I can walk around and play at will. I found that the accommodation is very crowded and difficult to secure. I finally booked a few nights in an express hotel. The child asked me why I didn’t have any Swimming pool 😂, I can only search the Internet for hotels with swimming pools, and I booked Shangri-La.

The facilities and environment of the old-fashioned hotels are good. Although they are not new, I still like the complete facilities and the heavy feeling of the furniture. This kind of fast hotel in the tourist season is not cheap, and the price/performance ratio is not bad in comparison. You can also go to the Internet celebrity apron on the roof to check in and overlook Nanjing City.

Location: I like this very much. You can see Xuanwu Lake from the room, and you can also walk to Xuanwu Lake. It is relaxing and comfortable. Looking up at the Xuanwu City Wall, it is majestic and small.


A cool summer gift: I find this gift a bit dumbfounding. It is an electric mini fan. Although it is very practical, it still feels a little weird🤣😂. Generally, if there are souvenirs in the place where I lived before, they are relatively famous things in the local area, such as living by the West Lake, and the delivery is Longjing tea🤭🌱

A cool summer gift: Soak cookies in hot milk and eat them, which is considerate.
After a comfortable night's rest, the next day's breakfast was served warmly by Wu Liping with a smile. "Are there any taboos in the meal? Do you want to add a little vinegar or chili sauce? The small dish will help you pack it. Add it according to your taste."
In the afternoon, there was a check-in activity on the tarmac of Internet celebrities. The handsome Hu Kun led us up to the 46th floor, and then patiently turned into a professional photographer under the scorching sun. Where is the best view point, stand for a while and squat down to help take pictures🤳, must praise👍
By the way, Miao Qiqin, the service staff on the floor, greeted warmly and kept the room clean.
Very satisfied with the check-in experience, satisfied with the room, satisfied with the scenery, satisfied with the meal, satisfied with the drink, satisfied with the gift, satisfied with the activities, and the most important service👍. I will go again, once is not enough. Bring friends, bring family to go again.

The most satisfying thing about Shangri-La is the service, which is the case everywhere.

She has good empathy, assisted in choosing a suitable room, and gave a lot of care and care.

In Nanjing at 35 degrees, after getting off the bus, there will be 2-3 staff members who will take the initiative to help with luggage and close the door! The lobby manager of the hotel is also very enthusiastic. He is very busy when checking out in the morning. He will take the initiative to share the work of the counter! But forgot his name, short hair man! l
Room space: The bathroom is very large and bright~ There is also a makeup table and chairs and a whole mirror, which is very satisfying~ The room is very clean and soundproof. The nearby construction site will be a little quiet after 8 am, but it does not affect sleep!
Sense of ceremony: Maybe it’s summer vacation, and a little yellow duck is prepared in the bathtub, so I can feel the hospitality of the hotel!
The soft drinks in the refrigerator are replenished every day~ You can still drink ice-cold drinks when you return to the hotel on a hot day

Finally: It is worth mentioning that there are at least 8-10 elevators in the hotel, so you don't have to wait too long! Very important! ️

In fact, it is very well maintained and the hygiene is satisfactory, which is especially important for families with children. Before check-in, I received a phone call from the hotel asking if there were any special requirements. I learned that some children agreed to add an extra bed, which is very humane. Welcome fruit, the room Mini bar is free. Remember to make an appoin**ent for the apron on the 46th floor, which is a very good experience. Hu Kun, the manager of the security depar**ent, took us up and took pictures for us. His skills are good. The lounge on the 40th floor has a beautiful view, with a sweeping view of Xuanwu Lake. It is a quiet and hearty meal, with breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. When we checked out, Ms. Yu Xiang at the front desk gave us a gift, which was a box of cookies. There is a Ukrainian band singing in the hotel at night, and it is a 5-minute walk from Line 1. In short, it is recommended to choose it next time you come to Nanjing!

I have to say that the fitness center has a lot of equipment, comparable to professional gyms. Will come again and recommend friends to stay here!

The transportation is convenient, and it is located near Zhongyang Road at the northern end of Nanjing's north-south central axis, which is a prime location in Nanjing! There is Metro Line 1 nearby, and it is not far from Nanjing Railway Station. Buses are also developed.
The food and beverages are also good. I tasted the afternoon tea in the lounge, HH in the evening, breakfast on the second floor, and breakfast in the lounge. They all taste good and have a variety of varieties. Jiangnan Stove and others have not had a chance to try it yet.
The service is also very good, and the hotel staff are very polite. In particular, Archer Wu, the service director of the Horizon Club, is the one who checks in and checks out, so she has more contacts. During the dining in the Horizon Club, they are well taken care of. She has a great personality and is very polite, which makes people feel very good. I can see that they have worked very hard when they are busy, so I would like to express my gratitude!

This is very good and must be praised! The room is hygienic and clean, and the service is considerate. There are many varieties for breakfast, and the fruit and snacks are delivered twice, which is more warm. It’s just that the front desk asked to write down the age of the children, and said that there would be a charge for early dining when they were over 6 years old. I said that I had lived in Shangri-La in Fuzhou and Suzhou before, and it was free only depending on the height. Later, another person came and said it was free, so I brought Beware of children.

The next day's breakfast was until 10:30, which was very suitable for me who woke up naturally. The customer service provided free fruit and sweet soup, and the little brother Chen Haoran at the front desk gave me exquisite biscuits when I checked out. Very nice experience.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at Shangri-La, Nanjing. I booked a duck parent-child room in cooperation with Ctrip. The main thing is the little yellow duck tent. The toy table is only suitable for young children. We are not interested in it when we are 5 years old. The little yellow duck's toiletry bag and slippers are good, and they are free. I bought a puzzle and a canvas bag, and the children were very happy. (I went home after checking out and found that there were no children's bathrobes and bath towels written in the reservation)

Environment: The location of the hotel is good. The Xuanwu Lake Tunnel is on the right hand side. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Fan Xuanwu Gate. However, there are a lot of battery cars along the way, so you need to pay more attention to safety. The environment of the hotel itself is also very good. There is a small rockery & waterfall in its own small garden. The coffee bar in the lobby has performances from time to time, and the singing is still very good.

Facilities: Shangri-La's hardware facilities are still very good. The slippers don't have a foamy smell like other hotels, and there is no smell at all, which is very comfortable. The hotel has a total of 42 floors, and several elevators are dispatched very quickly, so there is basically no need to wait. There are not many people on the Internet celebrity apron on the top floor to check in, and it is not particularly popular. You can take a look at the Nanjing city view and take a photo to check in. What needs to be mentioned is that you have to take the elevator to the 42nd floor and then climb 3 flights of stairs. It is not convenient for those with legs or feet. Don't go if you have heart disease.

Service: There are two bottles of juice, two bottles of beer, and two bottles of Sprite Coke in the mini bar in the refrigerator. The first round is free, which were not stated when booking. The service attitude is still pretty good, there is a
The girl who checked in and the girl in the coffee bar were not very happy. The check-in time was too long, because the room has not been cleaned up. Let us go to the Horizon Club for afternoon tea. In fact, the room was not full that day, why bother? wait?

The hotel's buffet breakfast is very good. When you enter the restaurant, a waiter will guide you to your seat and ask if you want coffee or black tea. This experience is very good, and there are many varieties. There are many Chinese and Western styles. The fruits are fresh and the juice is freshly squeezed. Duck vermicelli soup and Xiaolongbao have the most queues, and the taste is also good, which is very satisfying.

It seems that there is nothing special about booking Shangri-La on Ctrip, and there is no record of membership points for Shangri-La. It seems to be cheaper to book on your own app, and there are all the services you should have. Next time, I will book with the app.

The room is facing Xuanwu Lake, but it is blocked by two buildings. You can walk to the side entrance of Xuanwu Lake, and the entrance of the big tree root of the Ming City Wall is also there, which is super convenient. We walked from Ming City Wall to Xuanwu Gate, took a cruise in the park, and then walked back from the park.

Going back to the hotel just to experience the Internet celebrity apron, it's great! Special thanks to Hu Kun, the security manager, who not only patiently took photos of us on the tarmac, but also enthusiastically introduced Nanjing's food.

The hotel's room service is also very considerate, Wang Cuiyan, Zong Peipei, Ding Jiafeng and other staff for 3 consecutive days, I would like to express my gratitude. The service is timely and considerate!

The reason I paid 1,200 yuan for the room was to post bad reviews, and I hope other people who bring their children can see that this is the worst stay in Shangri-La! The luggage clerk who got off the bus didn't help with the luggage. There was a queue at the check-in time. It took dozens of minutes to complete a check-in, and no one came out to explain. The attitude was indifferent and the management was chaotic. After moving in, it was so noisy that I basically didn't sleep all night, and there were gusts of wind howling Because the child was tired from playing and fell asleep, I could only endure it. I made several phone calls to complain and couldn't solve the problem. I only found out late at night that the high-priced parent-child room I stayed in was separated from the four employee elevators that operate 24 hours a day! The elevator went up and down all night, you can't be so bad if you want to make money, right? No one informed about such a seriously flawed room. This is deception. Complaining over the phone is useless. I will post this experience on other platforms. I can’t believe this is Shangri-La.

(Baidu Maps behaved very convulsively in Nanjing, and even asked me to get out of the subway and reverse the bus😓)

The size of the room is small, and the design is a bit cramped. The old five-star hotel already has a little imprint of the times. The water flow of the shower is excellent, and hotels with abundant water flow are good hotels😂

The service is impeccable. During my stay these days, the staff from top to bottom are all warm and thoughtful, worthy of this five-star service.

The breakfast is so-so, too simple, basically no change even after a few days, and there are not many choices. Except for the breakfast, which is a pity, everything else is good.

The location of the hotel is right next to Xuanwu Lake, where you can enjoy the view from the window. However, there is a building next to it that is under construction recently, which is disturbing. The room is relatively large and it is comfortable to live in. Some suggestions, 1. Before checking in, I asked about the request to stay at the hotel, but it was not implemented when I checked in. 2. I was looking forward to visiting the apron on the roof when I stayed in this hotel, but because I couldn't arrange it for three days, I thought about it on the morning of the day I left the hotel. Have a look. The waiter on the 40th floor said that there are only two shows at 2:00 p.m. I am touched, although the matter is small, it shows that the service awareness of the waiters is different, the sense of responsibility is different, and the result is different. In addition, the doorman service also has room for improvement.

The decoration is relatively old and has a wooden style. It is suitable for older people and does not make many movies.
The important point is that the deluxe double room does not have a lake view, so you have to pay extra.
The lady at the front desk said that the charge is per person, an extra 500 for two people.
I didn't want to add it at first. The manager said she made a mistake and added 300 per room.
I thought 300 was not bad so I added it. The room was very slanted and I could only see part of the lake view.
The opposite one seems to cost more than 800 yuan, which is not interesting.

Checked the room number and went downstairs to the front desk to tell me to open a new room for me. The woman was probably scared to menopause and thought her husband would come to catch rape. If I would call the police, I really thank the hotel for giving me such a stimulus experience, roll your eyes
2. There are too many people on the 2nd floor for breakfast. I went to the executive lounge at 9 o'clock. There was no room and no one checked the room card. I sat on the sofa and waited for 2 minutes for someone to turn over the table before I sat down. I thought the waiter would come to collect the table until the lobby Say hello, is there anyone alive? Someone came to clean up. It’s really busy. I understand the lack of manpower, but there are too few dishes, but they provide a la carte. I just tell you that there are more than 60 dishes in front of you, which means don’t be a monster and make complicated ones. It took only 20 minutes to finish it, and no one refilled the cups in the public area, saying that the auntie was still washing... Finally, I was given a disposable paper cup, old swan... Staying in the All Season Hotel... is full of swear words
3. I chose an afternoon tea package in the room reservation, and I was told to pay separately after checking out... Later, the lobby manager came to check for a long time and said that there was a system problem. I asked for two free bottles of water at 10 o'clock in the evening, and it was delivered at 12 o'clock, and I fell asleep. I got up and opened the door in a daze, and it was difficult to sleep in the back, and the fully enclosed windows were airtight, and the air conditioner whirred loudly and loudly. It sounded like a woman crying when I was sleeping. Maybe it was my problem. supernatural event
4. I ate the Jiangnan Stove downstairs. The two-star Michelin star tastes good. It is a Chinese food and western cooking. I don’t go in until 9 o’clock in the evening. It is very cost-effective, 1300 for two people
Okay, I'm tired of typing, I hope I can help you make a choice

I didn't know there is an apron on the roof until I went there. You can visit and check in. I took some good photos with the drone. If the weather is better, it may be better. The attitude of the waiter is comfortable, not in a hurry. I was surprised by the speed of the cleaning lady. We didn't go out in 30 minutes, and we had already tidied up. This kind of careless cleaning makes people sigh, and I want to praise it. When checking out, I also gave a small gift of Qingtuan, which should be produced by the Jiangnan stove downstairs. The taste is good and the ingredients are in place.
To mention a few minor shortcomings, the restaurant has a wide range of choices and rich dishes, which should also be one of its competitiveness. But the chefs over there are probably disturbed every day. The DIY style required by various customers is somewhat tiring. It is inevitable that the aunts who serve are quite critical. The mood is understandable, but with the attitude of service, they may still There could be a better way to deal with it. The restaurant is not small, but there is also a lot of people on weekends and holidays. I was surprised to queue up for breakfast. If there are really many people, I suggest you make a reservation, otherwise it would be a bit silly to wait in line at the door.

There are fruits for check-in, and there is turn-down service. Director Yang Dan personally comes to deliver white fungus soup every night. We just booked the Horizon Club side lake view room. Manager Dong at the check-in desk helped me upgrade the Horizon Club lake view room for free, and I can see the panoramic view of Xuanwu Lake. Shangri-La Hotel's breakfast is too rich, Horizon Club guests can choose to eat in the executive corridor on the 40th floor.
You can also avoid passenger flow when you check out. Check out in the executive corridor. Manager Dong Jingjing at the front desk and the front desk also gave a small gift (the hotel's homemade biscuits 6 are very delicious). By the way, the toiletries: L'Occitane. Also, the Jiangnanzao restaurant on the first floor is excellent both in taste and service 👍👍👍

The other three rooms told us that it would be good to come in an hour. They locked the house first, so we went to eat first, and it was past 3:30 when we got back. When we got to the front desk, we checked the order for a long time, and the business was very slow, so I couldn’t figure it out. Yes, as the front desk, I still can’t find the order in the system. It took nearly an hour to process the 3 rooms. The premise is that we have already locked the house and processed it for so long. If I didn’t get angry on the spot, I wouldn’t call Will it take longer for the manager to come over and deal with it? ? ? Then it's over! On the morning of August 8th, I went to the second floor to have breakfast. I was told that I could not enter the restaurant wearing slippers in the room. Then my husband went back to the room to change. I was waiting, but a few minutes later I saw a gentleman come out of the restaurant wearing slippers! What kind of management is this? ? ? Then I went to reason. At first, there was no need to line up when I got down, but now I need to line up because of the shoes. At the beginning, the person who registered the room number said that it is impossible for someone to wear slippers. Then I took out the photo and was still quibbling! In order to appease me, I found two places to let me in. I said no, to find out this matter, I can go to investigate and monitor, and then the person in charge said to arrange for us to go to the 40th floor. I said no, I can also eat on the 40th floor. , but what I need is the result of your handling of this matter, you will give me an answer if you say it well, understand the matter, and give me a reply! After 24 hours today, there is no way to deal with it! The hotel deposit was refunded today, and the refund was less, and I was told that I need to check the order! I just don't get it, is it so difficult to check a bundled order in one system? ? ? As a five-star hotel, is this the efficiency and attitude of handling affairs? ? ?

The swimming pool has a good view and water quality, and the supporting facilities are also good, but it is a pity that there are no swimming rings or floating boards for children. The rich breakfast is standard in a five-star hotel. From the homemade tofu, deep-fried dough sticks, and homemade soup dumplings, you can see the care. Unfortunately, the soy milk is too thin. If you use a soymilk machine, it will be perfect. In addition, I hope to improve the welcome fruit. Although the oranges are beautiful, they may have been waxed, but there are too many seeds. The quality of the pears is average and not very sweet, which is not equal to the quality of the hotel. A family of four stayed for two nights, and one of the rooms was upgraded to the Lake View Pavilion with a better view. On the last day in Nanjing, I tried the 66th floor of the Internet-famous Golden Eagle G Hotel, but compared with the hardware and software services, I miss Shangri-La even more. I will definitely choose Shangri-La next time I come to Nanjing.

On the evening of the 26th, before the child went to bed, he found that the white storage box containing the shaping glasses on the dressing table was missing. He immediately contacted the hotel. Manager Zhang on duty went to the room at 11:30 to confirm the photo. The next morning, because the high-speed train back to Beijing was very early, there was no time to deal with it. I confirmed with the front desk of the hotel and recorded it. The hotel clearly agreed to investigate and reply, but there has been no news since then. Until the 30th, I took the initiative to call (there are all phone recordings), saying that I have searched, but I couldn't find it. I can only express my regret and take no responsibility. I need to explain that shaping mirrors are similar to contact lenses, but they are expensive, 11,800 yuan a pair, and the left and right eyes are stored in separate boxes. The shaping mirrors are worn at night and taken off in the morning. There is no problem of us losing them outside, and because of the high value, we are very careful and put them on the dressing table uniformly, and there is no possibility of losing them in the hotel. We have replenished a single lens on February 4, and we have a receipt of 5,900 yuan. Demanding compensation of 5900 yuan and an apology.

msg:Advantages: The location of the Shangri-La Hotel is very good, and the overall feeling is like an old-fashioned aristocrat! The exterior looks luxurious and magnificent, the lobby, elevator, fragrance, carpet and other small details all show the exquisiteness of an old five-star hotel, and the service personnel are standardized, enthusiastic and professional. Maybe it was due to the lack of manpower for moving in on New Year's Eve, and some mistakes that shouldn't have happened. The other room was disappointing, the room was irregular, and the TV had very few channels... As far as the guest room is concerned, it can't even be called four stars

From the smile of the lady at the front desk to the serious work of the auntie in the guest room, they are all very good. The Chinese restaurant is first-class. Every dish is online. It's a pity that I'm not satisfied with eating, drinking and traveling. It's a pity that I only arranged for one night. The later schedule is full, otherwise I must stay a few more nights.

Shangri-La, who has lived in several cities in China, has the best service! All the staff members will take the initiative to greet you when they meet, and the breakfast on the 2nd floor is delicious! Duck blood vermicelli soup and soup dumplings are delicious! Next time you come to Nanjing, you must come and live again. Before leaving, I gave a small gift, which is great!

The best thing is the check-in experience, which left good memories for our family's trip to Nanjing. The service director Yang Dan gave the surprise to the two children in the evening, and I would also like to thank Jiang Aixia and Wang Yingchen from the room service. When I checked out, I also received a pastry gift box from the hotel. From check-in to check-out, I enjoyed the thoughtful service that puts the customer first.

But the hotel's service is really good. The front desk, restaurant, and room cleaning really have a strong sense of service (the fragrance at the front desk, Miao Qiqin who cleans the room, and the female chef who makes steamed buns in the restaurant didn't see her name) made the check-in experience very comfortable thanks
I stayed at the hotel early to celebrate my birthday. Thank you for the birthday cake provided by the hotel. It was delicious 😋
Ps: The lake view room facing Xuanwu Lake has a good view and you can see the sunrise!

Free upgrade to Xuanwu Lake View Suite room, with walk-in closet, wet and dry separation, shower, bathtub separation, two washbasins; some "experts" 😊 recommend L'Occitane wash and care; air conditioner has hot air, not too noisy, very comfortable Comfortable; parking spaces in the underground parking lot are hard to find (it can only mean that after the domestic epidemic situation is released, there are too many people traveling out 😊), the garage elevator and the guest room elevator are located on both sides of the front desk in the lobby, there is a distance; the swimming pool water temperature is suitable , It closes late at night and opens early in the morning. After staying for one night, after checking in at night, and before breakfast the next day, we swam separately; the breakfast variety is very rich, including Chinese and Western styles, and the restaurant staff are also very timely and light-hearted; Before driving away in a hurry, I asked the welcome staff and learned that there is bread 🍞 and takeaway 🥡 in the lobby on the first floor. After visiting the mausoleum, I drove away, and I specifically helped me inquire about the smooth route; Shangri-La is trustworthy.

Walking to the Houhu Yinyue Gate of Xuanwu Lake Park is only 500 meters away, and next to it is the south gate of the Ming City Wall!

①The toiletries used to be L’Occitane, but this time it’s a miscellaneous brand.
②I have stayed in the hotel so many times, and it was the first time I had to queue up for breakfast at 10 o'clock.
③The bed sheet and quilt cover are very transparent. You can see the fur on the mat through the bed sheet. Vomit, I asked for an impermeable bed sheet the next day.
④Looking for Fragrance in Winter, Adventures and Gifts: When I placed the order, I wrote about dolls, and the cookies I gave when I left the store were unpalatable batches.
⑤ The security guard at the entrance is a decoration, and the entrance is tightly blocked. I went to the underground garage to queue for a long time.
⑥The TV still cannot project. Is it difficult to equip each room with a TV box? is it hard? is it hard?

They will call to greet you before arriving at the store, and will return to visit when leaving the store. This time I live in a free upgrade suite, standing in the house can see Xuanwu Lake, very happy. Especially worthy of praise is the Jiangnanzao Restaurant on the first floor. Every dish is very good, and there is no thunder. Overall, it makes people feel at home.

In order to hide from the sun, I always take a taxi when traveling. The hotel is very close to Xuanwu Lake and Jiming Temple. It is a bit far from the Qinhuai River Scenic Area of Confucius Temple.

②: It is also very convenient to travel. There is a subway entrance one or two hundred meters away from the hotel, and there is Jinmao City, which takes five or six minutes to walk.
③: The location is also very good. It is located on the edge of Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing. You can take a walk after eating.


Service: The lady at the front desk is still very enthusiastic, and told me that I can do nucleic acid at 5-7 pm every day, which is considerate. Since the air conditioner was on in the room, it was relatively dry, so I called the front desk to ask if there was a humidifier, and the problem was quickly solved for me, and the service attitude was excellent. I also specially gave me a lake view room on the highest floor, whether it is night view or daytime, the view is super nice.
The first round of mini bar: I don’t quite understand this mini bar, hahaha, do you mean the drinks in the refrigerator? I hope that next time I can make it clear to the guests.

1. The facilities are outdated, the central air conditioner cannot be adjusted automatically, and the writing desks are old and scratched

3. Hygiene is not very good, there is a layer of dust on the table

4. The service attitude of female waiters is pretty bad (it seems that boys are generally better)
(Ask the front desk for a vase, all kinds of reluctance, blunt attitude)
(I went to the breakfast room and said that I can’t wear slippers. I saw several girls being driven back to change their shoes. Why didn’t I say it in advance, and then I didn’t ask to wear a mask when I picked up breakfast, and I was staring at others whether they wore slippers)

When I checked in at the front desk on the 22nd, it was stated that I would always hang do not disturb during the check-in period, and do not let anyone enter my room without my notice. At about 10:30 in the morning on the 24th, I called the service center and asked to collect the garbage in the room and replenish supplies. Reloaded Do Not Disturb and left the room, (with photos) waited until 19:42 in the evening to return to the door of the room, and found that the Do Not Disturb had been turned off, (with photos) so I waited outside the door to notify the hotel as soon as possible I asked for the duty manager to come over. After waiting for 21 minutes, a duty manager came late. I immediately showed her the photos taken by my mobile phone. At that time, I had lost confidence and patience in the hotel, and I wanted to leave immediately. I don't know how the management of Shangri-La Hotel is like, how the staff training is carried out, such unforgivable mistakes will be made, this is no longer a problem of service nature, this is a serious violation of rules and regulations, and an incident of violating the privacy and safety of guests Yes, the hotel gave a 20% discount on the room rate for two nights, and said sorry and thought it was resolved. As I said, I will resort to the law and the Consumers Association.
In addition, I had breakfast in the restaurant on the morning of the 24th, and found that the sanitation was really unsatisfactory. The porridge table was full of rice grains and soup, and no one dealt with it. The waiters were only whispering and chatting. The seat is only checked by the guest after checking the room card, and there is no question of coffee or poor service process that a five-star hotel should have.

When we arrived, the room had a window and the lake was gone. We called the front desk and told them it was a side lake, and the lake view and No, the price of the lake view should be different. Consumers are deceived on the platform. Please choose the right hotel and don’t waste money. In the end, the hotel changed a room. The lake is there. The side windows are about 500 meters away from the lake, and there are two buildings between them. Only 10 buildings in the close distance are under construction, which is very noisy. sorry for the price

The advantage is that the service response speed is fairly fast. It is close to Xuanwu Lake, has a lake view, a good swimming pool, and the bed is quite comfortable. The breakfast and soup packs are good.
The Jiangnan stove on the first floor of the hotel is a bit disappointing to be honest, the taste is so-so, and it does not meet the expectations of black pearl two stars
Overall it's pretty average.

msg:For a short trip to Nanjing, in order to experience the Jiangnan stove on the first floor of the hotel, I chose to stay at the Shangri-La Hotel, Nanjing. For the room, choosing the corner room facing the southeast will be better than the room facing the north, and the room is brighter; because the room card is changed. The episode helped to upgrade the room with full lake view. The room is bright and you can enjoy the view of Xuanwu Lake at 180 degrees. However, the most improved experience of this trip is Shangri-La's Horizon Club service, from morning breakfast to afternoon tea and happy hour. On the 40th floor, you can enjoy it while watching Xuanwu Lake. The breakfast order menu is very rich and of high quality. There are a few types of afternoon tea, and the happy hour ends a little early. The overall stay experience is good, and it is worth staying in as an old five-star hotel.

The fragrance of the hotel lobby smells very good. Special thanks to the front desk manager who checked in at that time. It was a newcomer who checked in for me. The staff of the hotel, after I made my own request, she said that I need to add money to upgrade to a lake view room to see Xuanwu Lake, because I called the hotel when I booked before and put forward my own request, I need a floor A room with a lake view can be seen at a higher height. The front desk manager quickly found a room for me after understanding my needs, and finally arranged it in a south-facing room on the 36th floor. The room size is quite satisfactory. The cabinets are particularly old, but fortunately, the view from the high floor is good, and the sanitation of the room is also very good. Overall it is recommended.

msg:The hotel has to honestly choose the old brand five-star:
1. It is suitable for bringing babies. When checking in, the front desk feels the children's emotions and will take the initiative to comfort the toys. The furniture in the room is not sharp, and it is relatively safe. I told the front desk that there are children who need to make milk and take a few bottles of water. Give it all at once, unlike other hotels that give you two or three bottles, the waiter in the executive lounge will remember your hobby and will take the initiative to ask if you need to prepare in advance, and will also provide disposable bibs;
2. It is very close to Xuanwu Lake, so I have a good meal in the evening and push my baby to digest food. The cultural and life a**osphere by Xuanwu Lake is very good, and the little baby is very happy to sing and dance;
3. Although the hotel is a bit old, I was a little worried before I went there, because the last time I stayed there was five years ago.
4. The best thing is the software - the service level is very stable, give customers enough respect, pay attention to details and service, and be very attentive;
5. The room must be on the Horizon Club VIP floor. You don't have to go to the second floor for breakfast. There are not many people, it is very noisy, it is very quiet, and the scenery is beautiful!
6. All meals are eaten in the hotel. Downstairs is the Jiangnan stove. Make an appoin**ent and queue in advance, and the price is right!

Very good value for money, Shangri-La's breakfast feels more Nanjing characteristics than Ritz's, and the soup dumplings for breakfast are particularly delicious. Shangri-La's service is the same as always. The auntie who cleans the room is very warm and thoughtful, making you feel at home.

From the friendly smile of the guide when driving to ask about the location of the parking lot, to Cherry's attentiveness at the front desk when checking in, and the enthusiasm of the housekeeping staff when the toiletries in the room were replenished, many of them were touched by the details.
Shangri-La is a very inclusive hotel, which allows employees to show their individuality within a reasonable range. Yellow hair and gray hair are very recognizable. People who love to do hair too know how difficult it is to take care of their hair every day; Shangri-La is a hotel that can think from different perspectives. When the staff at the front desk is upsell, they are not just thinking about the price of selling more rooms, but will provide you with the most reasonable options according to your needs. The scenery on the 35th floor is very good. It is as beautiful as the smile of every front desk employee; Shangri-La is a tasteful hotel, which is different from the old man's music that many people say. I think it's really the years that give it a unique charm, and the new equipment will be old in three years. , only the vitality of the humanistic spirit can last forever.
The time is a bit rushed this time. Although I only stayed for one night, I still love it very much. See you next time, Nanjing Shangri-La~

Although it has been open for some years, the maintenance is generally good, which does not affect the experience of staying. The breakfast dishes are also very complete and taste very good. I changed to a hotel later, with the same price, and I wanted to change back to Shangri-La immediately after entering. Will stay again next time.

msg:Transportation: This hotel is not close to the airport, it takes about an hour to drive. It is convenient to go anywhere in the old city. The subway station and the bus station downstairs are very convenient for various transportation hubs.

Hygiene: Hygiene was going to give five stars, but while cleaning was changing products for my room, I found a long strand of hair on the fitted sheet, which was obviously not mine. After I told the cleaning, he took it off with his hands casually, as if it was not surprising, and I was a little embarrassed.

Environment: The hotel has a good environment, there is a small garden outside, and the greening is better. When I had breakfast in the morning, I saw green eyes, and there were birds flying around on the trees. I was in a good mood. And the supporting facilities in the hotel are relatively complete. Afternoon tea and swimming pool can basically be done in the hotel, which can be regarded as an old-fashioned hotel.

Service: Service, in fact, is okay. Our family of three travels, and what we care about is service. When having breakfast, the procedures are a bit complicated. If you add breakfast at the front desk, you need to sign at the entrance to eat breakfast. The procedures are cumbersome, and the guests have to wait for a while and have to type out the form to sign, which makes people feel a little inhumane. .

Let's talk about the Jiangnan stove on the first floor. This is a restaurant in the hotel, but many people come to eat it. The taste is not bad, but I personally think that the reputation is bigger than the taste. I sent a salted duck to the room, thank you!

On the first floor, there is the Black Pearl and Two Diamond Restaurant, which subverts the perception of Nanjing Jianghuai cuisine.

Unfortunately, there is no scenery outside the window, a construction site. The biggest disadvantage: the facilities are relatively old, there is no charging port beside the bed, and a wiring board is required in the room to complete the charging of electronic devices. In 2022, I will use a wiring board in a five-star hotel room, which is a bit magical

Good quality, 👍, I will still recommend friends and colleagues to choose 😀

The breakfast exchanged by Ctrip is not as much as I imagined, and the taste is very good. The lady will ask about your seat preference~

msg:I originally booked a deluxe room, but then I upgraded it to a deluxe lake view suite. The room is a living room with separate bedrooms. It is very clean and quiet. Fruit snacks are provided, and the minibar is also free. I like L'Occitane's toiletries the most. I chose the 34th floor to watch Xuanwu Lake, but the scenery is still good. I also went to the leisure area on the 40th floor to have a look. There are free drinks and snacks, and the Xuanwu Lake is really unobstructed. The overall decoration of this hotel is new Chinese style, relatively simple and atmospheric
The breakfast is more Chinese, and the details are well done. The sweet potatoes are peeled and cut into *****s, and the taste is okay. I'm not very picky about what I eat.
Xiao Dong at the front desk is very enthusiastic and helped arrange very well, especially praise!
Bring your family next time

msg:The hotel is located at the junction of Mofan Road and Zhongyang Road, adjacent to Xuanwu Lake. The location is excellent. The check-in is fast and fast. The check-in and check-out are handled by the front desk manager Dong, and the service is warm and patient. A welcome fruit and a gift box were presented upon check-in, and a set of L'Occitane travel suits were presented upon check-out. Really sweet.
The room is more than 40 square meters, and it is quite satisfactory. The decoration is relatively old, but it is well maintained. The transparent glass on the whole surface is a bright spot. You can overlook the Zifeng Building and the night view is good. The free Americano in the mini bar is delicious.
The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the handrail design of the bathtub is more user-friendly, especially for the inconvenience of legs and feet and the elderly. The brand feels better.
The gym is on the 4th floor, with a large scale and complete equipment. There is a dedicated aerobic zone. The water quality of the constant temperature swimming pool is clean. It may be related to the epidemic.
The buffet breakfast room on the second floor, the breakfast is more Chinese style, unlike many five-star hotel breakfasts, half Chinese and Western, I am not used to Western breakfast, so I am very satisfied with the hotel breakfast, especially the fried buns are made with three diced buns, The pot stickers and duck blood vermicelli are also good. Dinner was served at the Jiangnan stove on the first floor of the hotel. Huaiyang dishes were served in line for more than an hour. The taste was as good as ever, but the service was really bad. Maybe it was too famous and the business was too hot, so the speed of serving and the quality of service were average.
One last little suggestion, the Nanjing Public Security Bureau’s safety tips and anti-fraud promotional materials at the hotel’s front desk should not be used as decorations. Guests can introduce or give them a copy when they check in. The front desk of Sting has done this very well. After all, everyone is responsible for preventing fraud and building a safe Nanjing. Only when everyone participates, our city will be better. There are many five-star hotels, and services are more reflected in the details. , But in general, the flaws do not hide the flaws. As a well-known five-star hotel brand, Shangri-La has left a good impression on many aspects of its service. Compared with the prices of many five-star hotels in Nanjing, the price is still super high.

Thanks to Sheila at the front desk and the guest relationship Yuxiang, who upgraded to a small suite when checking in. I lived very comfortably. Although there are few people staying now, the quality of breakfast is still guaranteed. Nucleic acid needs to be done during the stay.

The vic check-in process is also very fast when checking out. Every time I come to Nanjing to do business, I will choose Shangri-La to stay.

The hotel is next to Xuanwu Lake and you can walk to Xuanwu Lake. If you want to enjoy autumn in Xuanwu Lake, I highly recommend staying here.

Let me see you for a long time. I came back from Nanjing Ritz-Carlton to check in again, just to complete the two bad reviews that you asked to delete🤪
      "As far as Shangri-La Nanjing's obsolete guest room decoration concept in 2000 is full of sense of cheapness, it can be removed from five stars on the first day of its opening in 2014. No matter how well your front lobby area is decorated, the hotel as a whole is just mud. The outside of the feces is too bright to stand up to scrutiny. There is also the self-operated restaurant on the first floor, the 8-person private room is pitifully small, half smaller than the 5-person private room in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and the manager of the entire restaurant said the private room is too big, I’m too wasteful alone, I’m really a frog in a well... I still sit in a private room for 16 people for dinner at the Shanghai World Expo Intercontinental Hotel. I eat more than a thousand by myself, and Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou tacitly allow me to eat in the private room. It has become all sorts of obstructions. How come your Nanjing is the legendary Pingyang? The tiger fell in Pingyang and was ridden by dogs? And the whole fruit is not only the service concept of this Shangri-La hotel’s self-operated restaurant is so backward, it is probably a raging nest. Shangri-La Group The Malaysian management in the headquarters is also a bunch of frogs in the bottom of the well. After all, it is a small country... Regent, Ritz-Carlton, and Niccolo have long left Shangri-La behind. Anyway, I wrote these, and the group management can't see it. People Already at the Ritz-Carlton, Shangri-La is out of sight for me.”

I would like to express my gratitude. Thank you for letting us spend a Happy New Years Holiday 😀

I am worthy of being an old five-star hotel, especially the caring butler service of Director Xu Meng, which not only helped me I was upgraded to a suite with a view facing Xuanwu Lake. The room was carefully decorated, and a blessing cake was also sent to me in the evening. I was very moved, thank you!

The room is spacious and has a good view! The landscape is beautiful, Xuanwu Lake is outside the window! As an Emerald member, there are extra small gifts to give, we chose fruit snacks and drinks. The drinks in the refrigerator are all free to drink, and the toiletries are of high quality as always! Before check-in, someone contacted us in advance to help us arrange. After the front desk has completed the formalities, someone will send us into the room and introduce the room facilities in detail. Very caring, very thoughtful, reflecting high quality! Thank you very much to all the service staff of Shangri-La Hotel in Nanjing, and you must choose Shangri-La Hotel when you come to Nanjing again. The location is also very good. The Jiangnan stove of the hotel is also good, so you need to make a reservation in advance.

msg:When I came to Nanjing to see the red leaves, I chose Shangri-La, which is close to the airport and Qixia Mountain, and the transportation is convenient. And just across from Xuanwu Lake, the hotel can see the lake view, which is very nice.
But beyond the above, the more surprising thing is the hotel's service! Before I came, I called to ask about the check-in requirements. After leaving the point, you will call to ask if you are satisfied. As soon as I arrived at the door of the hotel, I helped with the luggage and delivered it to the room. The other staff members were also very enthusiastic and asked if they needed help. The upgraded suite also sent fruits. In particular, there was a small hand-made card made by Manager Xiaoyuan in the room, and a small penguin was drawn. It was really thoughtful and moved.
From many details, you can see that the service of this hotel is very attentive! I feel the high quality of the Shangri-La guest relations team and the concierge. Next time I will definitely choose Nanjing Shangri-La again.

msg:As a veteran chain of five-star hotels, Nanjing Shangri-La is relatively good. Transportation: The hotel is conveniently located not far from Nanjing Station. It is also convenient to Xinjiekou on Metro Line 1. Xuanwu Lake can be seen from most rooms.
🔔Service: The service of this hotel is also very good. When checking in, the deputy manager of the front desk Du Wenyu performed very professionally and very well. When checking out, he also presented a small gift, which was delivered to the elevator.
The breakfast in this Shangri-La is really amazing. After staying in so many hotels, it’s basically cold food and Western food. Nanjing Shangri-La has quite a lot of Chinese breakfasts: Xiaolongbao, pancakes and fruits. , Duck blood fans... The taste is great.
🍃Environment: As a 14-year old hotel, although the facilities are a little bit old and not as good as the newly opened, the sanitation is still OK.
The most famous black pearl restaurant in Nanjing-Jiangnan Stove is on the first floor of the hotel, but because of the rush of this trip, I didn't have time to eat. I hope I can try it next time.
Finally, there is a small suggestion. The service manual in the hotel room is scribbled by the previous resident. It is recommended that the hotel change it to give the next resident a better experience.

msg:We went to Nanjing mainly to see the maple leaves at Qixia Mountain. We stayed at Jinling Hotel for one night the day before. Because the room in Jinling was too small, we decisively booked a double room at Shangri-La Hotel for the next day. I received a call from Shangri-La Hotel the day before asking us what requirements we have for staying in, such as bedding, etc. I suggested that we are senior citizens and the bed should not be too soft, and we provide us with latex pillows and buckwheat pillows. It is better to upgrade the room. , The reply on the phone is as satisfactory as possible. The next morning we first came to the hotel and wanted to store our luggage and then went to Qixia Mountain. The waitress who received us was Zhang Mengyu. She had a very good attitude and said that we can check in now, because the room was given us from a luxurious big bed. The room has been upgraded to a deluxe lake view room, and you can only enter the room in the afternoon. We came back from Qixia Mountain at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and we were very happy to enter the room. The room is very large and it is a suite. The pillows and mattresses are prepared as we requested. Outside the window is Xuanwu Lake and welcome fruits. There were many stalls for breakfast the next day, but the food was not high-grade, with few western styles, basic sausages and bacon 🥓. There were many Chinese styles. I think Xiaolong Tangbao is good 👍. In addition, the Jiangnan Stove Michelin restaurant on the first floor of the hotel is very busy. We wanted to have dinner and did not have a seat. The guests in the hotel did not have priority. Unfortunately, we did not taste it. The overall feeling of staying this time is very good 👍

The service is quite satisfactory, most of the waiters will not greet the guests when they see it. The front desk suggested adding money to upgrade the room, but the rights and services enjoyed were not clearly stated. Many rights and benefits require residents to call and ask themselves, which is very unprofessional.
The hardware of the room is old, the outer paint surface of the shower room is aging, and I directly pierced my hand. I asked for a sewing kit for room service. No one sent it for 30 minutes. Finally, I went out to find the corridor attendant to solve it.
The welcome fruits are different in quality, and the apples are already a long time. It is better not to send such fruits.
The view of the lake-view room is not ideal, and houses are under construction downstairs.
There are not many choices for breakfast. There are very few Western-style cold dishes, but there are many Chinese ones. Eat greasy and greasy meals early in the morning.
Low cost performance.

On the opposite side of the road is the entrance of Xuanwu Lake. In the evening, the park is very quiet and there are no tourists. The locals in Nanjing are walking and jogging, very comfortable
Room: Because the child is older, an adult single bed (including breakfast) is added, so there is no need to squeeze to sleep at night. The lake view room can directly see Xuanwu Lake, and it is also very beautiful to go to the executive floor to see the night view at night.
Food: There are many types of breakfast, although not very colorful, but the quality is very stable; the Jiangnan stove on the first floor is worth brushing, the taste is good, and the price is reasonable in the catering of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai hotels. The handsome hot pot on the 5th floor is also very cost-effective, don't miss it.
Facilities: The gym equipment is very new and has all the necessary equipment, and the equipment is well maintained. Although the swimming pool is not too big, it is not too small in a hotel. There are not many people, and the experience is good.
Service: warm, smiling, service is very good, very satisfied. The cleaning aunt is also very easy-going.

Disadvantages: The decoration must be old, and the cleaning is still in place. In addition, the Jiangnan stove needs to improve its operating capacity, the food is really too slow. On the first night, thanks to the reservation depar**ent belle, we got the number in advance and we were able to sit in and eat. After that, they were packed back to the room to eat, and they would have to wait an hour for them to be packed. No more complicated dishes, but the simple lunch "spring rolls + three portions of Yangchun noodles" before checking out today has been waiting for nearly 50 minutes, which is a bit weird!

I checked into the hotel after 11:00 p.m., and I was about to go to bed after washing up. The smell of sweat from the pillow made me bounce off the bed. I wondered if it was because the cleaning staff didn’t change the pillow? I called the customer service center for a long time Only then did someone pick it up, and then the waiter brought over a couple of pillows to change. Unfortunately, these pillows also smelled of sweat. After half an hour of tossing, the waiter had to bring a pair of pillows to serve as pillows for one person. For pillows.
Had breakfast the next morning, and found that the variety of breakfast was not at all the standard of Shangri-La that I had experienced in the past. There were few varieties and the ingredients were rough. . .

After hesitating between Jinling Hotel and Shangri-La for a long time, I finally chose Shangri-La under the suggestion of a friend in Nanjing. 1. The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the old city wall of Xuanwu Gate of Xuanwu Lake, you can walk around. If you choose the Horizon Pavilion, you can see the lake view and enjoy the afternoon tea. 2. The breakfast at the hotel is excellent. There are soup dumplings made every morning, fresh duck blood vermicelli soup, and friends in a hurry can enjoy the authentic Nanjing breakfast by the hotel Good food. 3. The customer service is good. When I picked up the phone, I asked about the room preferences. We arranged the three rooms on the high floor together, which is convenient for taking care of the elderly. I also learned that some children put children's bathroom products in advance. Special thanks to Belle Xu Meng, Director of the Guest Relations Depar**ent of the next hotel. 4. The hotel’s own downstairs dining Jiangnan Stove is the famous Black Pearl restaurant in Nanjing. The dishes are classic and need to be positioned as soon as possible. His buffet and coffee are also good. Currently, each person delivers hairy crabs in the fall. In summary, I would like to thank Shangri-La for bringing good memories to our family during the Nanjing National Day Tour.

Of course the hotel is very satisfied overall, adjacent to Xuanwu Lake, the location is very good, convenient transportation, the hotel buffet breakfast has handmade xiaolongbao and pot stickers, xiaolongbao tastes good.
The area of the hotel room is very large, and the view from the most basic room type we live in is also good. The waiter service is also in place. There are small snacks and fruits.
The gym configuration is very high, the swimming pool changing room configuration is very good, the most important thing is that the swimming pool opens at six in the morning, very suitable for my habit of swimming in the morning without affecting the whole day itinerary.

The whole process was serviced and the attitude was very good. Especially the customer relationship manager Bella, Renmei, thoughtful arrangements, helped in advance. Checking in, the hotel is well-equipped and clean. The hotel is close to Xuanwu Lake and can see the view of Xuanwu Lake. The location is convenient. As it was during the epidemic, many places were not open and the experience was not complete, so no evaluation will be made. One suggestion for improvement: the card placed in the smoking floor room is recommended to be removed to avoid customer misunderstanding.

msg:A five-star hotel very close to home, a very familiar place, but I have never had the opportunity and willingness to check in, but I have always been looking forward to it. Finally, I came to experience it on my 31st birthday. Because I have to work half a day in the morning, and to catch up with another Qixi festival, I had already expected the enemy to be the first. Before going to work, I ordered the takeaway artifact KFC and asked them to send me to the hotel. After arriving at the hotel, I went to Jiangnan stove to meet me. Old sister: I found out that when the old sister had just finished the Chinese meal, her eyelashes were about to fall due to the overload of work 😂😂 I can’t say anything. After sending the energy supply package, I came to the lobby and saw Miss Halo, who has been very popular on the Internet and almost all the employees of Xiangji are calling for her to vote for her. I am also impressed by her cheerful and sincere personality. After completing the application according to the sop, I did not forget to show me the itinerary code and green code. After checking in, gro tracy came over and said that Mr. He knows that tomorrow is your birthday. We have prepared red wine and an internet celebrity mousse cake produced by the bakery. How can I not know this cake? It is Jiangnan stove today. The Internet celebrity products in the main promotion of the Tanabata Double 520 package are from the idea of Xiangji star chef Sherry. After that, it was our new concierge, section head eric, the guy Liu, who appeared on stage. Putting on the new vest, the whole person was energetic, and I was still half a fellow villager. It's just a matter of talking to him and talking about the mountains. If I know that I can switch languages in multiple countries and regions at any time. After sending the luggage to the room, I filled it up neatly, and when I heard you mention Anthony, it must be a senior. I hope you have a pleasant stay. You can contact me if you have any questions. We exchanged WeChat. But to mention, it seems that I haven't checked the number of items with me. In addition, if you can help the show room, it would be better to introduce the use of various facilities and equipment. I am so familiar with Shangri-La. As a result, there are still a lot of things that need to be adjusted and sorted out by myself after entering the room, which invisibly wasted some of my time. I just got off work, and I was wearing a stinky sweat, which would indeed reduce my points slightly. In addition, I think 🈶 one of the more important omissions is that it did not introduce the escape channel and the pool gym spa. Later, I woke up at night and woke up to the front desk to realize that it has been shut down due to the epidemic 😳 But I think the attitude, enthusiasm and sincerity It can indeed play a decisive role, and I don't need to be so serious. What's more, FO team is such a great benifits suite ➕ red wine cake compote. I am sure that I can feel your kindness very sincerely. It is also a sincere suggestion to say those shortcomings. I hope that my little fellow can understand my starting point and meaning if he sees this passage. Concierge depends on you. Now, Bell's work and show room are basic. Later, during my stay, the guest room eldest sister, a Northeast guy, and Xiaoge Cai from the food delivery depar**ent all provided me with high-quality and meticulous service. Let me take a bath in the bathtub as much as I want, and then hold a red wine glass and look at the beautiful scenery of Xuanwu Lake. Birthday is to have a sense of ritual. In the end, don’t meet any messenger guests when you go to work. Happy Chinese Valentine's Day, everyone. My birthday is only halfway through. In the afternoon, I will go back to my unit and continue to move bricks. By the way, I have to thank my sister gloria for her strong support. I will late co until 4 o’clock. I will sleep well and write carefully. Okay, this comment. Then this morning, it might be because the phone was not hung up. I booked three morning calls but didn’t call into the room. The concierge and gro also came to wake me up and assisted the restaurant to add breakfast to me. When I entered add, I saw the heroic master George Yang. The first sentence was victory in the fight against the epidemic. ✌🏻 I was immediately affected by his enthusiasm. I was confused and prepared dry breakfast, pancakes, preserved eggs, thin porridge, and soup. The bag is real, yyds. Because I arrived late, I didn’t want my colleagues in the restaurant to wait for me too long. After negotiation, I packaged some fruits, yogurt and ice cream. I didn’t need to eat lunch. After I finish my day's work, I can send out this experience happily and full of memories. I hope I can come back if I have a chance. Thanks to all the staff of Xiangji for their thoughtful service😱

I was struggling with Shangri-La and Westin, which are also located by the Xuanwu Lake, which is suitable for parents and children. Later, I chose the older Shangri-La. The result is a great experience! Parent-child travel is equally suitable! From the beginning of the check-in, the duty manager Ms. Shen and Amiee helped us solve the problem, and also upgraded the room to the Horizon Club Lake View Room, thank you! ! As soon as the children checked in, they were attracted by the scenery outside the window and picked up the pen to outline the beautiful scenery of Xuanwu Lake. In fact, the small garden downstairs is also exquisite. The aunt who cleaned the room was very enthusiastic. Fruits were also delivered at night. The breakfast is rich and maintains the standard of a very high five-star hotel. Especially recommended: Nanjing special soup dumplings (one in a cage), beef fried dumplings, egg pancakes, produced by the chef 👍. In Shangri-La, Nanjing, we had a very good experience and nostalgia. Nanjing is a city with a rich history and full of charm. See you again in Nanjing and Shangri-La, Nanjing soon!

Service Evaluation: Excellent. Ms. Miao Qiqin's services are in place and caring at the front desk, catering, and guest rooms.
Environmental assessment: Excellent. As shown in the figure.
Hygiene evaluation: poor. One is that dust accumulation is serious, as shown in the figure. It is usually caused by dry air and air conditioning. This situation is very unfriendly to people with rhinitis like me. The second is that the bathtub is not deeply cleaned, and it has been normal after check-in. After using the bathtub before check-out, the situation in the picture appears. The area is the whole body. This makes me doubt the hotel room cleaning standards and operating procedures, whether it is healthy in the current epidemic Disinfect relevant parts of the body that are in contact with the present day when hygiene is paramount.
Recommendations: Hygiene should be the first priority, especially at the moment of the epidemic, the relevant operating standards and hygienic standards should be appropriately improved, and it is hoped that improvements can be made. If serious health problems occur, the gains will outweigh the gains. If this happens, I will be the first person, and I hope I will also be the last person.

1. There is no service at the front desk. It takes a long time to enter the hotel to check in. During the epidemic period, it is understandable. After the check-in, the ID card was placed on the table face up, and then I was not given a room card. After I asked, I remembered that one hand directly threw the room card over.
2. The cleanliness and smell of entering the room feel like no one has lived there for a long time, the noise is still relatively loud, especially the air conditioner, when entering the bathroom, there are spiders in the bathtub 🕷️, real spiders, call someone to come and see, waited 21 minutes before coming.
3. Breakfast is really nothing to eat, and there are very few categories
Final summary: The experience of staying for more than 700 yuan for one night is relatively poor. How can the 88th store be made like this? Management services do not work

整個酒店讓我們在旅途中感受到了温暖和舒適，一個人帶着寶寶出門住的很安心和放心，酒店專門送來了寶寶洗浴用品和拖鞋！

設施：如圖一，是不是應該提升一下。
環境：如圖二，位置擺放顯然有香格里拉自己的想法，如果坐沙發上，那麼看電視需要一直右轉頭；如果坐在床上那麼一直左轉頭即可。
服務：辦理入住各種不順序，來時一位接待辦理（女），下午又換一位（那位還在崗，也知道情況。有問題當看不到了）特意比前台告之辦理入住時間晚50分鐘回來結果仍然還沒收拾，需要繼續等待15分鐘（沒有房升級可不升啊）。再沒人問了，過時間自己去問，再告之要主管查房還要再等十分鐘。天氣比較熱，要求之下先給房卡放東西，一直在等查房，半小時後問門口清潔阿姨（阿姨態度很好）説早查過了，可以洗澡。第一次遇到這樣的五星級服務，也是第一次住香格里拉。感覺對比洲際，萬豪，麗思卡爾頓還有差距。另，早餐種類不算豐富。

msg:省流：如果你是一個有耐心且能容忍老舊設施的人，我推薦你住這裏；不然的話建議去別家看看。

硬件：酒店設施算不上是新，但足夠使用。衞生沒有問題，無懈可擊。所謂湖景景色比起別家角落套房，角度不正且被其他樓宇遮擋（見圖）。房間裏既然按照套房擺了沙發，應該擺3+1多一把沙發椅才對。旁邊華貿中心裝修施工噪音較大，夜間還有巨型招商廣告燈牌正對房間（燈牌白天狀況見圖）。

軟件部分：今次入住3晚豪華閣豪華湖景，同行人員入住豪華大床。

入住：禮賓和門僮有眼力見，加分；前台服務無功無過。

第一晚：

有開夜床，但是浴巾衹有一條，減分。打電話後阿姨光速送來的多餘浴巾，非常厲害（掛電話後5分鐘內送到），加分。

第二天：

2層早餐排隊有引導，加分；但是落座後無人詢問飲品選項，減分。豪華閣早餐可供選擇數量相比2層極其有限，減分；現點現做菜品上菜較慢，一碗麪從點到上用時20多分鐘，減分。

豪華閣晚間不提供酒水，令人驚訝（小坐一下，期間來客均詢問，得到“無酒水服務”後均表示驚訝），減分（如果成本問題不能晚間1930後提供酒水，建議傍晚happy hour也取消，如果提供了就請一直提供。）。

沒有開夜床，減分。（如果成本問題不開夜床，那麼第一晚就不要開，如果開了，應持續保持才對。）阿姨收走了床邊墊布（不是床尾床旗），之後沒有給新的。

第三天：

2層早餐排隊有引導落座，落座後終於有人詢問飲品，加分。取餐完成，整盤全新未動過的食物放至座位後去拿果汁，服務生跑來問“是不吃了嗎？”，無基本觀察能力，減分。今日早餐師傅不夠熟練，煎雞蛋女廚師蛋殼掉到煎蛋裏（不是一點碎殼，是半個雞蛋殼，當然她有及時拿走），減分；煎培根男廚師無視排隊等待培根的人，優先為一位插隊女士服務，大減分（客人沒有禮貌是客人的問題，酒店無法維持秩序是酒店的問題）。

豪華閣下午茶點心選擇很少，但味道都很好。

繼續沒有開夜床，減分。（如果成本問題不開夜床，那麼第一晚就不要開，如果開了，應持續保持才對。）
床邊墊布（不是床尾床旗）依然沒有再次提供。

第四天：

2層早餐有排隊驗卡，無人引導落座，減分；之後有實習生引導落座至餐廳偏僻座位，不願叫服務生打掃明顯已經用完餐的正常座位，減分。

豪華閣退房快速高效，加分。


綜上所述，酒店設施老舊，服務不盡如人意，如果你有耐心提出問題並等待改正，他們能夠快速改正，但如果你希望第一次就能做好的酒店，這裏顯然不是。

經人提醒，酒店平日價格非常便宜，所以上述情況的產生應該也有關係。酒店如果想削減成本走廉價路線，建議可以進一步削減開夜床、豪華閣服務等，而不是扣扣索索地維持在一個不上不下得過且過的狀態。

如果你不圖便宜，衹希望以正常價格得到應有的服務，建議去其他酒店看看。

無關：1層江南灶普通版價格親民，食物味道不錯，但是服務員對菜品擺放位置有自己的理解，需要客人自己手動擺正。

酒店其他住客素質極低，穿浴袍穿拖鞋，頭髮都沒吹乾，在大廳晃來晃去，完全不顧及這裡是公共場所。酒店應該有規定的，顯然酒店沒有能力維護自己的規定。
服務之所以給三星，有一個重要的問題，就是酒店對其他住客泄露了我的樓層訊息也沒有得到我的允許，這個是完全不能被接受的。

然後行政酒廊，不知道是因為缺人手還是培訓問題，服務員的服務意識幾乎沒有。正常行政酒廊的早飯肯定會帶位然後問喝什麼，香格里拉不僅沒有做到並且我選的位置在去拿東西的時候還被別人佔了。
行政酒廊早飯幾乎選不出來，老鴨粉絲湯淡如開水，這些都是我意料之外的。
房間客廳還不錯，主卧裝修感覺沒有客廳好，然後湖景衹能看一部分，基本上看不全紫金山，對比威斯汀行政湖景套房，威斯汀性價比更高

建議住正湖景的高區套房，因為低區朝玄武湖房間其實被前面建築遮擋了視線，基本要36層以上才可以。或者直接住最便宜的大床房然後和前台要西面的房間，因為西面的城景是最美的，北面是新造的樓完全檔風景了，南面房間是側湖景也能看到紫峯大廈但是被金茂威斯丁擋住了。圖1是41樓西面風景，圖2是41層的南面風景，圖3是41樓南面風景，北面房間不用住也知道被擋。

辦理入住的時候會想我所想。積極協調解決問題。因為過年期間人比較多。一家三口特別安排加床服務。房間升級到更大的套房。正逢新年 還給孩子準備了一大盒糖果 和紅包巧克力金幣。
這裏從門僮到禮賓部到前台到客房，衹要在這裏的任何地方看到的每一個工作人員都會熱心微笑跟你打照顧，幫你開車門提物品按電梯。會貼心告訴我們現在哪個景點人比較多。還有一個爺爺很熱心的告訴我們去哪裡玩 怎麼去。讓人感覺南京是一個很有温度的城市。因為香格里拉還會再來南京 。

酒店自助早餐竟然還排隊排了一會，早餐品種還是蠻多的。酒店中餐廳江南灶沒吃上，低估了黑珍珠兩鑽的實力。停機坪打卡説是住店客人都可以上去看的，看看夜景可以。房間裏看了日出日落，也不枉此行了，另外玄武湖湖景是歪的，不是正對的。

酒廊視野開闊、服務親切有禮，玄武湖盡覽，遠看湖面舟船緩行、有風箏在灰藍天色裏迎風攀高，樹木也整體是灰調。天氣預報當日南京有霾，心想果然天下大同，西京南京差不多啊，但北京就不同，鐵腕治理下藍天已是常態。
二樓早餐空間稍顯逼仄，菜品選項不算多，某朝向窗外是對面在建樓宇，似乎停工狀態，觀感欠佳。

早餐後想上頂樓停機坪看看，到頂層是間餐廳，服務員告知需到前台申報、由保安開門陪同可往，想想這是對的，酒店考慮很周到，大盤舉而不堅堅而不久風景這邊獨好，天台已經成了一撮又一撮無數韭菜自嘲之梗。

其他所見一切均好。值得推薦。

一開始因為12月31日是我母親的生日，我很高興酒店在我的要求下為她準備了生日佈置，感謝酒店贈送的生日賀卡和蛋糕。

然而，酒店房間設施相當陳舊，浴室瓷磚有幾塊都搖搖欲墜，浴缸旁邊的噴頭甚至拉出來帶着泥巴，廁所發出異味，這種異味甚至可以在廁所門口聞到。我們第一晚報告了問題，一位工程師來處理，但問題未能解決。第二天早上，酒店又派了另一位工程師，但異味問題仍未解決。工程師在我們房間逗留了半小時，影響了我們的休息時間。

儘管我們預訂了兩晚，但第二天房卡居然被消磁了。在房間門口等了15分鐘，員工才送來了新的房卡。

我在前台投訴了下水道和房卡的問題，並提出要求換房。令人生氣的是前台員工沒有道歉或提供補償。最終，在我提出升級房間的要求下，我們被換到了貴一級的江景房。

儘管問題最終得到解決，解決問題的過程並不順利，酒店員工也沒有及時表達歉意。考慮到跨年夜的房價較平時更高，服務方面也應該更加慎重。總體而言，作為老牌酒店的香格里拉不應該發生這一連串讓人不舒服的事。

首先就是前台小姐姐（一個四個字名字的笑起來超甜的小姑娘）入住和退房都是她 細心記得客人的需求 話語温柔如沐春風 還幫我們預訂了酒店中餐廳和停機坪打卡的項目//帶我們去停機坪參觀的胡經理也很專業 會在停機坪細心介紹南京的各個地標和景點（停機坪上看日落應該也會很美吧）//客服打掃的阿姨們也很用心 

乾淨整潔服務好是下次來南京還會再住的酒店🏨

再説説湖景房，你們攜程上架時候不瞭解詳情嗎，還是酒店大忽悠那，前台特意給的高層，進到房間一看，兩座大高樓擋得嚴嚴實實的，分明是樓景房，大言不慚還湖景。
再説説前台，我住你酒店，選什麼房型一定是自己喜好，你欺騙我算了，我認！但是請別忽悠升級啥的，沒意思哦。

msg:總體感覺挺棒的，我比較注重品牌，才選擇了香格里拉。有幾個印象不錯的地方：第一個是孩子喜歡的，在五樓有小童樂園，籃球場、桌遊之類的，孩子玩了幾次都很開心，四樓的無邊泳池雖然比較小，但孩子也喜歡。第二個是我印象比較深的地方，樓頂的停機坪打卡遇見了夕陽🌇體驗感挺棒的。第三個是酒店的地理位置很不錯，毗鄰玄武湖，全程服務總體挺不錯的，能微笑服務，也還算注重客人的反饋。需要改進的地方：第一，酒店設施及裝修風格偏老舊了，裝修風格和智能化都跟不上新裝修的酒店了；第二，房間內的茶葉、咖啡、水果、洗漱用品等品質跟不上，甚至太差了，完全與酒店品牌形象和定位不符合，跟快捷酒店一樣，而且入住第一天沐浴乳、洗髮水忘了提供；第三，早餐服務接待能力弱，住了三晚，前兩晚都被拒絕去二層正常自助餐廳用早餐，被安排去臨時改用的五樓火鍋店用餐，直到第三天早上起了一個大早才能在二樓用餐，雖然承諾菜品一樣（實際上也有差異），但體驗感不好。下次還會入住這家香格里拉嗎？也不一定不會，得看孩子的需求。

msg:這是今年我們第二次帶孩子住這家了，小朋友第一次走的時候都哭了，説捨不得小黃鴨房間，可見有多喜歡啦
先説房間的設施，雖然確實是有些年頭了，但是保養的還是很不錯的，尤其是親子房除了有小朋友的拖鞋浴袍和帳篷玩具外，還有小台階、小馬桶圈等，真的很貼心。有個小建議，親子房的桌角、牀頭櫃角可以裝個防撞貼。
再説服務，我們一進房間就有工作人員送來了小朋友的用品，説不知道孩子多大所以很貼心的準備了一大一小兩雙拖鞋，因為小黃鴨漱口杯沒有了，還送來了一個小黃鴨小包包作為禮物，本來很失望的小朋友一下子歡呼雀躍起來了。第二天，水果也有更新，客房部的姜愛霞、楊丹還手寫了小卡片，真的是細節也很到位了，而且來房間送東西的時候都是笑容滿面，讓人真心感受到如沐春風。
最後説説酒店整體情況，離南京火車站衹有一站地鐵，而且離地鐵站非常近，所以出行很方便。酒店早餐也很豐盛，味道也好，大加分（建議地板去油再清洗，現在有點黏腳）。游泳池人不多，小朋友遊得很開心，建議室温升高一些，孩子爸爸游泳之後有些感冒了。其他就很完美啦，下次再來肯定還是住這邊～

唯一美中不足的一點是checkin時忽然有兩名應該當天在酒店舉辦婚宴的伴娘，擠到了同櫃枱，或許是尋求借物。但當時我正在辦理入住，幫我辦理入住的員工以及另一位應該在為兩位伴娘服務的員工均沒有阻止。希望員工可以意識到這一點，當時並不是沒有空的櫃枱。而且如果同事想服務多位客户，還是請注意一下間隔。

這一次特意要求了視野比較好的房間，雖然樓層不高，衹有25樓，但是可以俯瞰到玄武湖的全景，當年也很寬敞。
房間的服務很好，每天負責打掃的服務員汪學梅很盡職，我們需要什麼東西補沖也很及時，想泡澡的時候還主動幫忙提供了一次性泡澡袋。
客房主管楊丹也很貼心，我們出門去了，還給我們留了甜湯宵夜～～
貴賓廊的服務小姐姐小哥哥態度也都超好，主動招呼我們，都笑眯眯的。前台的Byron劉越和Kaya小鮑也很不錯～～主動提供相關的訊息。
我們還特意去了46樓的停機坪，陪我們去頂樓的安全員張思奇態度也很好，上樓下樓都有主動提醒長者注意腳下。
總體來説，是很滿意的一次入住。
但是如果能更注意一些小細節，可能會更好。雖然説不影響最基本的入住體驗，但是或許可以更顯專業性。比如餐廳的一些展示架，客房一些特別不常用的地方和角落，可能更仔細的控制一下灰塵，會讓人感覺更好。

單純説房間，這價位香格里拉在南京已經沒有優勢了，淋浴間甚至不如智選假日水平，旁邊還有不利因素疊加

江南灶是真的好啊，道道好吃，有新意有心思，大黃魚和臭豆腐肥腸可以説驚艷了，這價格吃到這水準實在太滿意了

1.位置，交通：十分便利。邊上那個就是地鐵站，距離南京站僅1站路。去是內主要景點都很方便。步行到玄武湖公園（城牆）也就3-4分鐘。
2.服務：相較三年前，最明顯是，服務在整體上有好幾階的提升。不管是客房打掃，前台接待，餐廳服務等，每個人臉上都洋溢着喜悦的笑容，説話親切，做事麻利。特別表揚大堂接待張禾欣，我因着急趕火車，下來時才發現房卡還留在房間，她直接笑着説，“沒事，不影響，您先走，稍後會給您辦理退房的”。還有39樓的客房打掃大姐，每次看見都會主動打招呼，知道我們天氣因乾燥流鼻血後，主動給了好多菊花茶，讓我們泡水喝。
3.餐飲：一樓的江南灶是不容錯過的，品質依舊。想説説酒店早餐，品類還算豐富。特色湯包還有，當場做，就是把以前大的一籠一個灌湯包改成小號了（我真想念當年的灌湯包，皮薄汁多，秒殺外面的同款，大大一個很過癮。這是訂香格里拉理由之一），現在改一籠兩個，口味挺好的，但沒有特色了。可惜鍋貼沒了，有現做的肉餅，很香，但我吃不慣。早餐中規中矩，建議可以利用自身的淮揚菜優勢打造自己的特色。

房間不算大，但設施比較新，有歡迎水果，因為是中秋節入住還送了月餅。
住的32樓湖景房，視野比較好，能看到玄武湖和城牆；晚上夜景也不錯，有一邊是建築工地。
酒店大堂吧有烏克蘭樂隊駐唱，聽了幾首還不錯，在現在疫情後的酒店裡算是少見的了。
服務也比較周到，離店後發現物品漏拿了，前台幫忙叫快遞到付送給我們。
不足或可以提高的地方：
泳池水太涼，沒有小童泳區。
房間地毯上有一個不明鋒利螺絲釘，幸好及時發現後撿起來，不然很容易扎到腳，這個應該避免。

豪華閣貴賓廊專屬禮遇:這個必須體驗啊！還能飽覽玄武湖美景！

地理位置-南京的地標玄武湖與紫金山搭美景一覽無餘，內環快速路喝地鐵站都在門口，無論公共交通還是打車駕車出行都毫無壓力。
設施餐飲-早餐豐富美味，符合香格里拉的一貫標準，40樓行政酒廊更是俯瞰美景，來一杯咖啡，絕了。泳池健身房維護得當，非常舒服。大名鼎鼎的江南灶就在一樓大廳，還有提供特別為酒店客人的客房服務，非常方便。
私心-這次是帶爸爸媽媽來慶祝長者家生日，賓客關係主任Susen美女主任提前電話問候，幫我們安排高樓層，生日當天還和另外一位美女yaya一起為我們佈置了房間生日主題，贈送了特別好吃的芒果蛋糕，一起唱了生日歌，給我們全家拍了拍立得。細節見真彰，Susen以及其他香格里拉的同僚（Yaya!）對我們無微不至的關心，讓我覺得這並不衹是一次酒店入住，一次異地旅行，更是創造了未來我們全家會常常記起並且暖心微笑的幸福體驗。“熱情好客香格里拉情“，南京香格里拉的各位辛苦了！在這裏再次感謝南京香格里拉的大家，再次特別特別感謝Susen主任和yaya。我們一定會再次相遇。

門口小哥會指引旅客排隊，前台辦理入住的住客賓客如雲
房間衞生：沒有異味，沒有太大灰塵，除了浴袍櫃有一股許久沒打開過的塵封味，其他都是做到很完美。

設施：咖啡機，煙灰缸，小火柴，歡迎水果，健身房，游泳池都有，雖説酒店14年開業，整體設施維護的很好

環境：旁邊就是玄武湖，地鐵站，綠化覆蓋廣，這環境真的哇塞，

服務：服務沒得説，深圳香格里拉真的要學學了，
感謝Luna小姐姐幫我及時續半個小時退房，讓我有充分時間回去收行李，感謝她送的伴手禮，讓我覺得南京不僅素質高，服務也是很nice的。期待下次南京之旅！
真的沒有缺點

優點，早餐湯包真心和外面差不多，好吃裏面有汁水，和我特地找的老店一樣的。西瓜汁也不錯。他家酒店早餐，我願意付錢吃。
床品舒服，不軟不硬，睡的很好。
交通，打車也方便，周圍吃飯地方也夠了。
不足：住的普通房，所以安排到的房間，打開窗簾特別近距離看到另外一個裝修的大廈，必須整天拉上窗簾，要不對面工人師傅看的一清二楚。
綜上，去其他城市也會優選香格里拉。

地鐵一號線 新模範馬路站
1號口很近 
步行三四分鐘
這點有利於出行
畢竟旅遊城市 堵車嚴重
地鐵是最佳方式
湖景房
值得等待
阿姨打掃了很久
大概一點半才入住
41樓
風景很贊
電梯很快
4樓是健身房 24小時
5樓有火鍋餐廳
2樓是自助餐
早餐種類比想象中少一些
1樓的餐廳 生意火爆
大堂很寬敞 高大 
衹是一樓沙發區域需要消費
但晚上遇到了老外歌手的表演
聽一下還是很愜意
酒店房間很乾凈整潔
符合五星標準
衹是酒店的房門 有點單薄
46樓停機坪適合拍照
早上去的 藍天白雲 很美
希望 下次還能入住
感謝阿姨給了一套歐舒丹
滿意

1.大堂的綉球插花沒有一點點爛葉，品質超好。
2.提前通知前台，小朋友生日。YAYA小姐姐佈置的房間，小朋友很喜歡。吳桐小姐姐當天還送了小朋友小蛋糕，服務細節滿分💯。
3.當天辦理入住的客人很多，整體有序，也不忙亂。

msg:Bringing children to experience the historical and cultural a**osphere of Nanjing's ancient capital, choosing to stay in Shangri-La, is a worthwhile trip. First of all, the hotel has convenient transportation. When you enter the city, you can go through the Xuanwu Lake Tunnel. The subway line 1 is just downstairs, so it is convenient to go anywhere. Secondly, the hotel environment is very good. You can enjoy the panoramic view of Xuanwu Lake from the room, overlooking the distance The beautiful scenery of Zijin Mountain, with mountains and water, has a panoramic view. Downstairs there is the hotel's own small garden. It's good to take a walk in the evening to digest food. Finally, the hotel service staff is warm and friendly. Every time they meet a guest, they will take the initiative to say hello, greet them with a smile, and respond to every request. The front desk service staff suggested that we upgrade the room type. We can enjoy the breakfast service of the VIP Pavilion on the 40th floor, afternoon tea and evening mini bar service. In the afternoon, we can sit in the coffee bar on the 40th floor, read books, drink tea, and enjoy the scenery. It is very comfortable. This The upgrade is well worth it. Here, I would like to thank the hotel staff Miao Qiqin, Liu Jiumin, Yang Dan, Yu Xiang and Wu Tong. This time I stayed for three nights in a row, and the sanitation was in place every night. The staff will help to add paper towels, water and water in time. Drinks, the room depar**ent will also give fruit and desserts in the evening, thank you very much 🙏

msg:比較神奇的體驗吧
先説好的：名副其實的香格里拉大飯店，東西好吃 ，大多數的小哥哥小姐姐都還是非常好 ，讓人很舒服，帶我們參觀停機坪的安全經理胡坤 又高又帥 貼心的服務，不過攝影水平有待提高嗷
再説説問題吧：第一天晚上3點多我是熱醒的，渾身過敏 我家娃是就抱着自己帶的毯子，熱的啥也沒蓋
，為了不打擾別人，我自己吃了抗過敏葯 坐到6:00多 ，打電話給客服要求換薄一點的杯子 不能是鴨毛的，一位老先生包了兩條破毯子 一臉嫌棄的告訴我沒有其他被子，衹有這個，就是在168也看不到的那種破毯子，被套薄成紙，上面還有洞，再不濟我住的也是香格里拉行政套房，就被這位工作人員這麼不待見！吃好早飯我找到樓面經理 ，結果 酒店啥都有 ，整個中午我們倆就傻呆呆看着一堆人換被子 烘床墊 檢查空調 換冰箱（冰箱也是壞的）之前我放在冰箱的點心都壞了
我們定了兩晚，第一天下午5點 前台就打電話催我們退房，弄得我們莫名其妙 還解釋了半天 非常鬱悶
樓層經理主動安排的糖水作為道歉 還主動吧我們第二天退房時間延遲到6點
第二天下午四點 門卡有失效了 我們倆個在樓上下不去 一個在樓下上不來 反正兩個人都回不去房間
這兩天我就忙着溝通 檢修 解釋 換卡 
休息也沒休息好 心情也受到影響

也有優點，酒店提供的自助早餐非常豐盛，可選擇的種類和服務都很不錯。味道也很好。希望能做得更好。
