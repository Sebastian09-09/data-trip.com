Only item is probably the lights are turn on slightly late. We saw a few ppl riding in the dark. Quite dangerous since cars are travelling in low lights. 

Feedback to  staff and they mention they will bring this to the in charge to adjust the light timing

msg:We had a lovely stay at this beautiful hotel.  The rooms were clean and a good size and the breakfast was delicious with lots of choice.  We ate Western food in the bar every evening (burgers, chips etc) and the food was great.  The pool was lovely (the jacuzzi is very warm) and my daughter loved the play room in the basement.
Two things to consider: firstly, the boat trip is only short and involves either a cable car ride or a steep walk (I don‚Äôt like heights, so we opted for the walk and it was pleasant but would not be suitable for the elderly or very young children). Secondly, we did not know we had to book our taxi to the station the night before we checked-out, so a member of the team eventually booked one for us, as my Didi app would not get us a car, with the hotel being so far out.
Overall, a lovely place and we will definitely return soon.

msg:Lovely scenic location, peaceful and remote.
Upgrades upon check-in, I was told the reason was because there were not many guests. This was a welcome surprise.
The room was lovely, a suite with well-thought out break-out areas and amazing views.
Breakfast was vast and good quality with food choice for both Chinese and western. 
Out of the restaurants, only the Chinese one was open. The food and choice was below average. 
Despite being told that food from the Japanese or Western restaurants could be ordered before arriving at the hotel, it seemed it was not possible. There was a 30-min quick menu to order from, but the quality and choice was very poor.
Executive lounge access on the first day was of the poorest experience I have ever had. After speaking to the manager they promised me a better second day experience. It did improve to what I would expect at any 5 star executive lounge. Nothing special.

Overall: Room and location were lovely.  It was clear that if busy, then service and access to the full amenities would improve. It is a shame that the 5 star quality cannot be kept, even if only a few guests are staying.

You can easily reach touristic points from the hotel but,  if you don‚Äôt want to go to far , staying at the hotel and enjoying the amenities offered is also a very good option. Indoor and outdoor swimming pool ( with lake view!! I suggest to avoid holidays because pool can be really crowded) . There are painting and ceramics classes. Tried the ceramic class for a couple of hours, really worth money and experience-wise no matter your level  , teacher is patient and teaches you very well, you can even bring your piece of art at home or purchase one of his great works! Restaurants: Food is tasty and with a great variety of choices. Chinese restaurant and Japanese are amazing ( we didn‚Äôt try the western restaurant for lunch or dinner but only breakfast - Chinese and Western buffet options). Hotel is good for families or couple holidays. We enjoyed a lot our long weekend stay and we look forward to coming back soon

Location is a bit isolated at the end of a peninsula. Views from the hotels are great, no other constructions. Surroundings are very quiet, road not too busy, good for family cycling.
So many activities for children: ceramic, an incredible play ground, two swimming pools, cycling, etc. 
Staff is very helpful.
Of course, F&B is quite packed and "mass market" when the hotel is full. But well organized.

msg:Overall we had a very good experience at the Intercontinental. We were upgraded to excellent lake facing rooms which had a fabulous view. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of peace and calm away from the city, this is an excellent choice! Blake at the front office was especially helpful and the hotel and staff were always trying to help us with our baby. The child play area is fabulous! So are both the indoor and outdoor pool though the outdoor pool could have been bigger. 

On the cons - there‚Äôs literally one person in the entire hotel who can speak English which sometimes creates a problem. The food is very average and the breakfast options at other 5 star hotels are much better - here there were limited options and food just didn‚Äôt taste very good. The other grouse was with the spa where we opted for a foot scrub and a body massage but turns out foot scrub was only a foot wash! The last issue was with the boat ride which for 300 RMB is a 10 minute ride to a cable car ride (which is ticketed separately). 

We still had a very good stay and would love to go back.

msg:It's so comfortable to travel during off-peak hours when there aren't many people. This time I stayed at the InterContinental for 4 days and 3 nights. My husband and I stayed in the hotel. We ate the big fish head from Qiandao Lake and took beautiful travel photos. We took more than 100 photos but only selected more than 40. I'm almost going bankrupt from choosing. The hotel is on a peninsula, covering a large area. It backs onto Xianshan Mountain and faces Qiandao Lake. The environment is great. The hotel arranges many activities, making it suitable for vacationing with children. Most of the people I saw were families with one or two children. The housekeeper AMY is very nice. She was afraid that the Xianshan room I booked was far from the main building and it would be inconvenient to have breakfast, so she specially upgraded us to the most spacious room in the main building. High-rise suite, the room is very large and faces the mountain view. The mountain is shrouded in mist after the rain. It is so beautiful to sit in the room and drink tea and enjoy the scenery. Aunt Xiong Xingshu, the room cleaning waiter, is very polite. Seeing us making tea in the room, she gives us several more bottles of water every time. I drank a bottle of juice in the refrigerator, and she replenished 4 bottles at onceüòÇI called a special car to pick me up at the train station in Shanghai. On the way, I asked the local driver, and he said that he thinks the InterContinental Hotel is the best hotel in Qiandao Lake. Other hotels may be more upscale and expensive, but overall, the InterContinental is more cost-effective. It seems that I did not make a wrong choiceüòéI will come here for vacation if I have the chance in the future

Service: The housekeeper added WeChat in time, the service was very considerate and the attitude was good. I would like to especially mention the hotel's travel photography service. The shooting effect was unexpectedly good, the makeup was professional, and I liked the few photos I took. The people and natural landscapes were all very beautiful.

The only hotel that can afford Qiandao Lake is InterContinental and others.
The environment is already very quiet ten kilometers before the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I was shocked by the beautiful scenery.
The breakfast in the hotel is also very delicious, but it‚Äôs a pity that the buffet has not started yet. I will try it again during the summer vacation.
I think it‚Äôs enough to come to InterContinental to play in Qiandao Lake.
The rental of the Little Tiger electric car is 120 per hour, and you can ride around the hotel, which is very cost-effective.
The children's playground is also very large, and there are very comfortable sofas. I think it is happier than Nairbao and parents are more relaxed.
In addition, the butler service is very meticulous and considerate. I have to praise Yunia for making our family feel at home.

This hotel was recommended by a friend. It is a distance away from the high-speed rail station, but it is really worth a visit. There are many popular check-in spots. As long as you have hands, you can take big pictures without retouching. The breakfast is very good, rich, and delicious üòã There is also a boat to go out to sea. You need to make an appoin**ent one day in advance, 300 per person. It is also a good choice to see the scenery of Huangshan Peak. The outdoor swimming pool is not open for use in this season. You can take a private bath (charged separately). The only drawback is that the deluxe view room I booked is on the 3rd floor of the hotel lobby. The view is blocked by trees and you can't see other scenery outside. So if you want to see the scenery, communicate with the front desk in advance. Even so, it does not delay giving a five-star praise.

The hotel route map details various tour routes, and you can choose the appropriate route according to your needs.
The hotel also carefully prepared a small train, an amusement park, a botanical garden, and a swimming pool suitable for babies for the children. In the morning, there is also a breakfast suitable for babies to take by themselves. It is definitely a model of a parent-child hotel.

msg:I really like InterContinental Qiandao Lake. This is my second visit. Before I checked in, my exclusive butler Yunia had already added me on WeChat. She was very considerate and provided us with activities during the May Day holiday, free travel photography, and sugar paintings and dough figurines. The hotel butler service was very thoughtful, fast and meticulous. There are also a variety of parent-child activities in the lobby. The hotel environment is equivalent to a private island, with a very quiet and comfortable a**osphere. I hope to come again next time.

msg:This time I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel, and the experience was very good. First of all, the hotel is in an excellent location, with a unique view of Xianshan Island. Although it is a bit far from the high-speed rail station, there is a shuttle bus, which is very convenient. Secondly, the butler service is very considerate, almost responsive, and answers to questions are very timely. The lake view of the executive lake view room is excellent and the room is very comfortable. The food in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is also good, and the fish head soup and river shrimp are delicious. If there is anything lacking, the breakfast is average. Overall, InterContinental is worthy of being a well-established five-star hotel and is worth staying in!

msg:The software environment is absolutely first-class, and the entire Xianshan Peninsula is exclusive. The scenery is so beautiful. But the hardware service is not worthy of the environment. 1. The daily cleaning is too sloppy, the quilts and towels are not tidied, the garbage is simply dumped, and the cobwebs only 20 centimeters away from the bed are not cleaned, indicating that the cleaning has been neglected for a long time. 2. The air conditioner in the room is broken, which makes it cold and hot when sleeping without a quilt at night. The environment by the lake is cold, humid, and very uncomfortable. 3. The mattress was too hard and my back hurt when I woke up the next day. I opened it and looked at the mattress from Xilinmen. 4. The so-called butler service cannot be said to be useless, but I was never added before check-in. I left a message with suggestions on the last day and took a whole day to reply. 4. Users‚Äô demands and questions in the hotel communication group are never answered, and they just keep posting advertisements. In short, I feel that the service and hardware are not worthy of such a good environment, nor of five-star standards.

3) There was a rag on the chair that the cleaning staff forgot the next day.
4) The refrigerator was not cold, and the fresh milk was thrown away after one day and I didn't dare to give it to the baby.
5) The quality of the travel photos is average, and the extra photos are expensive at 80/photo.

It's also speechless that the room facilities are not intact.

The hotel has a nice view and a quiet external environment. The attitude of the service staff is OK.

There are also handwritten cards and teddy bears for the children, which is very warm.

msg:Before coming to Qiandao Lake, I heard a saying: There are two types of hotels in Qiandao Lake, one is the Qiandao Lake InterContinental Hotel, and the other is other hotels. I thought this was a bit exaggerated at first, but after checking in, I felt that this statement spoke my mind.
I ordered two twin rooms for 4 nights during the May Day holiday on Ctrip. The hotel called to inquire that we were 2 elderly people, 2 adults, and 1 10-year-old child. They took the initiative to change one of the rooms to a double room and arranged an extra bed for the child. Before we arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Huang had reserved the boat tickets for Huangshan Peak for us. The hotel front desk guy was very patient and enthusiastic. In order to facilitate our care for the elderly, two different room types were arranged in a very close location, and breakfast was given to the children. The hotel waiter would leave a small card of love every day to greet the guests. I took the hotel shuttle bus many times when dining around the hotel. The shuttle bus driver was polite and friendly, and the service was thoughtful. On the day of check-out, the hotel front desk extended our check-out to 2 o'clock to facilitate the rest of the elderly. The Mimi bar in the room is free to drink, and good night milk is given every day, which is very considerate for children and the elderly.
The most unique thing about InterContinental Qiandao Lake is that it has a large forest scenic area on the Xianshan Peninsula. The hotel itself is a tourist attraction worthy of in-depth travel. During the May Day holiday, when the surrounding attractions were crowded, returning to InterContinental Qiandao Lake felt like being away from the hustle and bustle and in a paradise. We stayed in the hotel for two full days, strolling, cycling, driving electric cars, visiting Xianshan Botanical Garden, swimming, children's playground, and changing clothes to take pictures.
New travel photography was an unexpected surprise for this stay. The hotel gave each room 3 photos or a 15-second short video for changing clothes and taking pictures. The photographer was very professional and dedicated. With the blessing of the beautiful scenery of the hotel, he left us many beautiful memories. We were very satisfied with every photo and paid extra to buy a lot of photos.
If I come to Qiandao Lake again, I think I don't need to worry about choosing a hotel anymore. InterContinental Qiandao Lake is my only choice.

Luggage and clothes can be placed in the small cloakroom. The bathroom is very large and there is also a large bathtub for bathing. At night, service staff will come to open the quilt for service and clean up the garbage again, which is very considerate! Drinks in the refrigerator can be enjoyed for free and will be refilled after drinking. The hotel is very suitable for parent-child travel, and there are many free rental baby products. In the afternoon, there are candy painting, snacks and some small handicrafts to participate in. You can walk outdoors or rent a bicycle to stroll around the lake. The indoor swimming pool area only has a swimming pool and a massage pool, no sauna room, and the massage pool is very unimpressive. The choice of buffet breakfast is OK. The buffet dinner is not cost-effective and has no special features. Overall, this three-day and two-night vacation is still very happy!

The facilities were well maintained and the room was very clean. The environment was green and there was no noise when sleeping. The only drawback was that the location was a bit remote, but the scenery on the road was also unique. The 10-kilometer road was built by the hotel itself. It is recommended to drive by yourself

When fully booked, the hygiene and service are very good, and the holiday activities are particularly outstanding. Thanks to the housekeeper Yunia for her thoughtful service during our stay. Although the hotel has only three restaurants, the dishes in the Chinese and Japanese restaurants are very delicious. We had 6 meals in these two restaurants and didn't feel tired at all. The Japanese restaurant especially recommends sushi, and the Chinese restaurant is also very good in addition to the fish head soup and dim sum. It is rare to encounter a hotel that occupies a mountain alone, borders the botanical garden and zoo, and has mountain climbing, hiking, watching the sunset, and can take children to experience the beauty of the surrounding environment in all aspects. It really lives up to the reputation of "There are only InterContinental and other hotels in Qiandao Lake".

Whether in terms of facilities, environment, service concept and many other aspects, it still has its unique style! In the room, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery by lying on the sofa. You can go swimming during the day, have a meal in the Chinese restaurant, have afternoon tea in the afternoon, take a walk by the lake at dusk, and make an appoin**ent for a travel photo shoot to leave the best memories...

It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the lighthouse. There are many small flying insects on the road, but fortunately they are not poisonous insects. The hotel's Chinese restaurant opens at 17:30 in the evening. Dianping has set meals. I would like to thank the hotel for sending mon**orillonite powder at 22:30 in the evening. Because my family had severe diarrhea, I called the concierge depar**ent with a try mentality. I didn't expect it to be delivered in less than half an hour. The breakfast is quite rich, and there is a children's meal area. There are scenery everywhere when walking around. If you like hiking, you can go to the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon area.

I have to praise Ctrip's service here. The lake view room on the 5th floor on the first night was blocked. After reporting it to Ctrip, Ctrip communicated in time and changed to the lake view room on the 6th floor the next day. It was much better. Ctrip's after-sales service is still good.
The new travel photography included in the package is also good. Unfortunately, the weather was not very good on the day of the photo shoot. The young man is very good at entertaining children. The photographer and the photo selection service are very friendly. I feel that everyone pays attention to service now, which is quite good.

The hotel has complete facilities, is family-friendly, and has good water quality in the swimming pool. The lake view suite is over 100 square meters and luxuriously decorated. The service quality upholds the consistent high standards of IHG. Special praise is given to the room attendant Aunt Xiong Xingshu, who is always responsive and gives snacks to the children. The hotel's travel photography service is a major feature. The moon gate inside the hotel is a holy place for taking photos. The lake viewing platform and lighthouse outside the hotel can take beautiful photos. The price is not expensive, leaving a good memory for this trip.
If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the world, Qiandao Lake InterContinental is your best choice.

msg:1. The hotel housekeeper will contact you in advance to provide a hotel map and activity list. If you have any questions, you can consult. Some activities require reservations, such as Moon Gate Travel Photography and Terrace Hotpot, etc. (It is best to make an appoin**ent one day in advance for travel photography, because it requires reservations. Shoot for 1-2 hours). The service is attentive. They will help deliver your luggage to the room when you enter. There is also a good night service and free milk and lavender aromatherapy every day.
2. Turn left at the gate and enter the small road to reach Xianshan Park. There is animal feeding (rabbits, ducks, goldfish). You can go to the store in the hotel lobby to get free feed. Goldfish and ducks will eat this feed. There is no rabbit feed, and the staff will give it to them. We have an apple haha.
Xianshan Botanical Garden (opening hours 10:00-17:00, holidays until further notice, closed on Mondays), strawberry picking is available in season, suitable for taking children. There are many interesting animals and plants in the botanical garden, and the staff have labeled them with names. There is a small wooden house in the garden, which contains some animal and plant specimens. It takes half an hour to complete the whole journey.
3. On the day of check-in, there are welcome fruits (bananas, apples); drinks in the mini bar in the room are provided free of charge, including juice, beer, tea, coffee, and almond milk; the hotel also gives away two drink coupons, so you can go to the lobby for drinks when you are free.
4. The hotel's lakeside terrace hotpot is really average. I don't recommend trying it out. It's better to go to Xianshan Restaurant to have a fish head hotpot.
5. The buffet breakfast is 6:30-10:30. There are too many people who arrive late. We have to wait for a table when we go at 9 o'clock. The staff will recommend you to go to the executive restaurant on the fifth floor, but there are few varieties. If you want more variety, go to the all-day dining restaurant on the first floor (a series of Chinese and Western food such as wontons, noodles, soup noodles, waffles, etc., which are the standards of a five-star hotel. I think the pound cake there is delicious). The all-day dining restaurant also has children's meals, such as sausages and steamed eggs, which are very suitable for babies.
6. The scenery of the Intercontinental is really good. It is very suitable for pregnant women to lie down in the hotel and watch the scenery. If you want to stay in the Intercontinental, it is recommended to travel by car. Because it is located on the Xianshan Peninsula, transportation is inconvenient. If you are doing activities near the hotel, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It is convenient to have a car to go to the city. Those traveling by high-speed rail can reserve the hotel's high-speed rail shuttle bus in advance, but there is a time limit.

We hoped to check in early so that the elderly and children could rest, but the front desk asked us to wait until 3 pm for a room, and we could only wait in the lobby. I understand the 3 o'clock check-in policy, but should a more appropriate solution be provided instead of letting the elderly sit on the sofa in the lobby for a lunch break? Although a small gift was given to apologize when leaving the hotel, this incident made people feel uncomfortable. Apart from this incident, I am very satisfied with the rest. The room is large and well maintained. There is no sense of shabby age, and there is no damp and moldy smell. The indoor playground is large, and the 3-year-old baby has a lot of fun. The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is also very good. The elderly can also visit the botanical garden, etc. It is suitable for staying at the hotel to lie down and relax.

msg:It was a very happy trip. Before departure, I hesitated for a long time between InterContinental and Sheraton, and finally chose the InterContinental package. On the day of check-in, I added WeChat with the housekeeper Melody, who sent me the check-in guide and reserved a room with a lake view. I was very satisfied. After that, I asked her many questions and the replies were very quick. The hotel service is great, and all the staff I met on the road will greet you with a smile. The room is large and clean, and the lake view is super beautiful. My favorite thing these days is to sit on the balcony and listen to the rain. The afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge are average, but the waitresses are very kind and thoughtful. The scenery of the hotel is so beautiful that it feels average when I go to Huangshan Peak. On the day of check-out, we took pictures while walking around. The lakeside is really beautiful, but there are too many insects and we have been fighting with them.
There are Xianshan Hotel and Xianshan Tavern next to the hotel, but we still like the hotel's own Chinese restaurant the most. The environment and taste are good. The two restaurants outside are a bit unbearable. The fish head soup is super delicious, but the set meal is too large and wasteful. Be careful if there are few people. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious. I like yogurt and noodles very much. I eat them every day.
The travel photography is a bit tasteless, because if you take more than three photos, you have to pay 80 yuan for each one. I feel it is quite expensive, so I don't plan to add it. In order not to waste each other's time, I told the photographer in advance that I would only take three photos, and then I was told that I could only take photos at the entrance of the hotel and not go to places farther away. Before, in Hangzhou and Yangzhou, five photos were given and one photo was charged 20 yuan. The photographers were also very good. If you don't buy, they will try their best to meet the customer's requirements. In the end, basically everyone will pick more. This side is a bit difficult to comment. It may be a common problem of monopoly merchants.
The flaws do not cover the merits. Overall, I am quite satisfied. I like this hotel very much. I will come again for Qiandao Lake vacation next timeü•∞

msg:I stayed in the Southeast Lake District for the second and third nights in Qiandao Lake and chose the InterContinental Hotel.

I chatted with the driver on the way here. The driver said that the hotel was in a remote location, but it was the best hotel in the area. I knew I had made the right choice when I heard it.

Let's talk about the hotel. First of all, in terms of service, the housekeeper Melody contacted me in advance on the day of check-in, introduced the hotel's activities to me, sent me an event poster, and asked if I needed to make an appoin**ent for me. The service attitude was proactive and enthusiastic. Although we booked a lake view room, we were afraid that it would be some rooms with a slanted view of the lake, so we asked Melody for a room with a better view. As a result, Melody simply upgraded me to an executive lake view room. The room view was great, which must be praised!

Secondly, the room facilities are complete, the big bed is comfortable to sleep on, the bathtub is spacious, and it is very enjoyable to take a bath. It's just that the hotel has been open for more than 10 years, and the decoration is a little old, but the flaws do not hide the merits. The scenery outside the window makes people feel happy and comfortable.

Thirdly, the hotel covers a huge area. It is said that the entire Xianshan Peninsula is a hotel. The hotel garden is very beautiful and it is very photogenic. The package we booked included three photos taken by Xinrui Travel Photography. The photographer took photos for us very patiently and his photography skills were also very good. In the end, we directly selected 30 photosüòÄ

In short, this stay experience was great. The hotel's lake view and gardens are so beautiful that people don't want to leave once they come. InterContinental is definitely the first choice in the Southeast Lake District!

Stayed for two nights. It was stormy at night on the first day, but the sun started to shine at noon on the second day. The package purchased on Ctrip includes a very rich and high-quality picnic basket. It feels so wonderful to pretend to have a picnic on the balcony facing the beautiful scenery!

The butler Nick called me one day in advance to understand our check-in time. He added the butler's WeChat account and kept in touch whenever needed. Whether booking hotel activities, extra bed service, or room arrangements, he was timely and considerate. The three days in the hotel include buffet, hiking, taking photos at the Intercontinental Lighthouse, taking a speedboat to visit the top of Huangshan Mountain, watching the sunset, starry sky party, and night fireworks show. The arrangements are rich and comfortable. Thanks again to the butler Nick for his attentive and fast service during the three days, allowing us to have a perfect vacation experience.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Nick, the intercontinental butler who made the connection this time. He provided various information service support and responded promptly throughout the whole process, including free room upgrades, reservations for dinner and yachts, etc. It was really considerate.

Secondly, I would like to thank Ms. Guo Yanhui (on the day of check-in) and Ms. Ni Xiaojiao (on the next three days) from the room service for their meticulous service. Especially Ms. Ni, who saw that we drank a lot of water and took the initiative to adjust the amount of mineral water in our room, was very considerate.

In addition to the above three, the hotel staff I met during this trip were all kind and courteous. Luggage delivery service is proactively provided as soon as you get off the car. The reception staff are considerate and efficient. The store staff proactively reminds you of the time and precautions required to reserve a yacht in a timely manner. The staff in the Western and Chinese restaurants also make people feel friendly. A waiter at the Chinese restaurant said he remembered us when making comments after the meal on the third night. Aha, lovely girl, I remember your appearance too~

Needless to say, the hardware of the hotel itself goes without saying. It has a beautiful environment and complete facilities. It is the best place to rest for those of us who don‚Äôt like to rush here and there. (Those who like to check in at every point may think this place is more suitable for self-driving, but I feel that calling a taxi is just as convenient).

Thank you Intercontinental for making this trip to Qiandao Lake comfortable and satisfying.
If you like Thousand Island Lake, if you yearn for Thousand Island Lake, you must stay at InterContinental~

msg:I have always chosen Intercontinental for vacations. I have long heard that the intercontinental environment in Qiandao Lake is very good. This time I chose this place during my vacation. Although it was off-season and it rained all the time, what made this visit unforgettable was its unique location and magnificent scenery. The hotel is located on the bank of Qiandao Lake. The hotel presents guests with a beautiful picture of lakes and mountains, making people feel like they are in a fairyland. Especially after it rains, the scenery outside the window looks like a splash-ink landscape painting.

The activities in the hotel are rich and colorful, providing guests with a wealth of vacation options. From water sports to mountain hikes, there's something for everyone. The hotel made a special call to confirm the day before check-in, and the hotel's warm and thoughtful housekeeper Melody made the entire stay experience even better. She sent an activity list on WeChat for my reference before I even arrived at the hotel. After check-in, she was also attentive and provided considerate service. Although there was a little hiccup in the middle, he was able to provide timely help and solve coordination. I would like to give him a thumbs up. When I checked in, the front desk also helped me upgrade to an executive room, which was also great.

The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety. In the all-day dining restaurant, the enthusiasm and attentive service provided by the waiter Wang Zhiping are very impressive. It can be seen that he loves his job. It has brought a pleasant dining experience to many guests. There was also a management lady wearing glasses (forgot her name) who also happened to help guests communicate with the kitchen staff about food issues. Everything was based on the guest's experience, which was good. The housekeeping staff, Wu Zuxiang and Liu Xia, provided guests with considerate care by delivering sleep-aid tea and good night milk every day. There were also little handwritten notes, which were nice touches.

However, the problem that needs to be pointed out is that there are some deficiencies in the hotel's facilities, such as no USB port for mobile phone charging, the socket voltage does not match the domestic one, resulting in low mobile phone charging efficiency, and the facilities are relatively old and backward. This may affect the comfort of some guests, because many fast-food chain hotels have USB charging ports, but a five-star hotel does not. It is recommended that the hotel can improve and optimize in the future. People nowadays cannot live without their mobile phones, and the freedom of charging is very important.

The food in the executive lounge and the delicious food in the Chinese restaurant are also an unforgettable part. The exquisite food provided here allows guests to enjoy the delicious food while also appreciating the artistic beauty of catering. The afternoon tea is very exquisite and suitable for sitting when you have nothing to do.

The hotel's swimming pool is pretty good, the deepest is only 1.5 meters. Because it is the off-season, there are almost no people. It is open until 22:00 on daily basis and until 23:00 on weekends. The hot spring bath was outdoors, so I didn't try it because it was too cold. But there is a hot water massage pool next to the swimming pool. It is very comfortable to lie in it and even fall asleep. The gym is also very attentive. Drinking water is placed on each treadmill for guests in advance.

Of course, the hotel also has many outdoor activities, such as strawberry picking, hiking, etc., but because it kept raining, I chose to lie on the sofa in the room and watch the scenery of Qiandao Lake. There is a lighthouse nearby that you can check out. Just turn left when you go out and walk for a while, which is suitable for checking in.

In terms of catering, because the hotel's location is so unique, there is only one Xianshan Hotel near the hotel, which costs about 300+ per person. The taste is okay, but if you want to eat local food, you have to take a taxi for more than ten kilometers to find a suitable restaurant, which is not so good. convenient.

Overall, despite some facilities issues, InterContinental Hangzhou Qiandao Lake is still a desirable resort hotel through its unique location, beautiful scenery and considerate service from its staff. I will wait for the next opportunity. Come back to experience it in May and June when the weather is good. I heard from the driver that the peak season of Qiandao Lake is usually from May to October, and hotels cannot be booked at that time. In fact, it‚Äôs good to travel during off-peak hours. On vacation, you need to find a good hotel to lie down and relax appropriately. InterContinental Hotel is a good choice.

msg:very good! It is worthy of being the No. 1 resort hotel in Qiandao Lake. Although it has been open for a few years, it has a stronger charm, which does not affect its luxury and seclusion at all. The wood + stone materials will never go out of style no matter how you look at it. The most luxurious thing in the room is the entire wall of the lake, half indoors and half outdoors. Although it is winter, you can lie down by the open and warm window. The background is the calm Qiandao Lake. In the morning, you can see yachts gliding across the lake, making ripples. The welcome package includes desserts and fruits, and the mini-bar in the room is free of charge. The amenity is Byredo, a brand from Sweden that I like very much. It has a very light citrus fragrance. What‚Äôs more considerate is that the toothpaste contains dental floss. The starry sky corridor is also very beautiful, the sunset is particularly beautiful, and the breakfast is rich. In short, it is worth a visit and is not necessary.

When I checked in, I was upgraded to an executive lake view room. The lake view outside the window was superb, and I felt comfortable even lying by the window in a daze.
Although it is relatively remote, the hotel has many activities. It provides a speedboat to the top of Huangshan Mountain. Although the price is a bit high at 300 yuan per person, it is very convenient to go back and forth. Taking photos from the top of Huangshan Mountain is very good. In the morning, I also rented a bicycle and went around the lake to see the scenery. It took about 30 minutes easily.
Ivy, the Ctrip housekeeper, was very enthusiastic and solved our problems in time, which also made our journey much easier.

Due to personal reasons, I changed the room for the next day. In the case of tight housing supply, they communicated patiently, made proper arrangements and exceeded my expectations.

Because some rooms in the hotel had to replace wooden floors and we couldn't rest well, they arranged for us to go to the executive lounge to work and rest, and also gave us free afternoon tea. The fish head soup at Xian Restaurant is outstanding, and there is also a farmhouse restaurant called Xianshan Restaurant next to it that is also delicious. Although it was foggy at Huangshan Peak that day and nothing could be seen clearly, the hotel's warm service made up for the lack of weather. The bicycle ride around the lake is also worth it. Because it was raining lightly, I rented a double one with a canopy for 180 an hour. The only thing is that the cable car at Huangshan Peak is under maintenance from time to time. If it is said to be out of service, there will be no special notice. You have to go to Dianping to see if there is any suspension announcement on the day. Otherwise, you will not find out until you land on the island that you have to rush. The duck is on the shelf and climbing the mountain. Fortunately, I read the scenic spot announcement before going to bed on the day I checked in and found that the mountain cable car reserved for the next day was out of service at 1.29, and the boat schedule was temporarily postponed to wait for the cable car to resume operation at 1.30. In this way, we had to rush to the hotel at 11 o'clock after disembarking from the pier. Bus. We were worried that we wouldn't be able to make it in time. All depar**ents of the hotel helped coordinate the whole process from early morning. They sent a shuttle bus to the pier to pick us up and board the bus. We also gave our children thoughtful gifts.

msg:During the Spring Festival, our family came to Qiandao Lake for the first time to celebrate the New Year. Among several popular lake view hotels, we chose the Intercontinental Hotel with the best reputation. Before coming, we were a little worried about whether the room facilities in the old hotels would be outdated and whether the view and location were good. I hope we got an unexpected surprise and a super satisfying experience during this stay, which made our Spring Festival trip a complete success.
First of all, before checking in, Kaia from the guest relations depar**ent contacted me in advance. After understanding the size of our family and our needs, she helped us upgrade to a room facing the lake view and add a single bed. We enjoyed the unforgettable sunset over the lake and the beautiful holiday fireworks right in the room. The facilities in the room are also very warm, comfortable and luxurious. The decoration is more traditional and mainly made of wooden finishes. Not only does it not look old, but it has a Hong Kong-style old money style.
Attractions and sightseeing: Because we focus on leisure and leisure, we booked a hotel and took a boat to the island. We boarded a cruise ship from the hotel pier and went to Huangshan Jiandao (belonging to the Southeast Lake District) to overlook the picturesque scenery of Qiandao Lake. The fee is 300 yuan per person, including tickets to Huangshanjian Scenic Area and round-trip boat tickets. Personally, I feel that it is very convenient to play this way during holidays, as it can avoid the noisy large groups of tourists.
Service: The services in all depar**ents are cordial and friendly, making you feel at home. The room has a turndown service every night. Milk is placed on the bedside at night, hot health tea in a thermos cup, and a handwritten letter from the waiter.

Environment: There are many tourists during the Spring Festival, but the hotel organizes various interactive activities, such as New Year‚Äôs markets, folk customs, and lion dance performances. All employees should participate in performances and services, and serve tourists enthusiastically to make the New Year experience more intense.
15S Travel Photography Quick Cut Video: The travel photography included with the booking package is an unexpected surprise! The photos captured by the photographer within 1 hour turned out particularly well. Although only three quick-edited photos were given for free, I couldn't bear to part with them, so I spent money to buy more.
Disadvantages: The hotel's Xian Chinese restaurant charges an additional 15% service fee if you order dishes, which is relatively expensive. In addition, the buffet dinner, which costs more than 200 yuan, has too few hot Chinese dishes and a slightly smaller variety, making it not cost-effective.

msg:Special thanks to the little sister Zhang Jing at the front desk. When I called to inquire whether I could book a Ctrip package and make up the difference to upgrade the room type, Zhang Jing was very patient and gave detailed suggestions. In the end, we chose to upgrade to an executive lake view twin room. They also helped us apply for breakfast included for both our children, which is very cost-effective. The bed in the room is 1.35 meters wide and there is a sofa, making it completely stress-free for two adults and two children.
The most important thing is that the location of the room arranged this time is very good. You can see the lake view from the balcony during the day and the fireworks show at night. Therefore, I won‚Äôt put any other photos, just the ones I took on the balcony in the past two days.
In addition to the Ctrip package, many gifts were also given. IHG members received a welcome drink in the lobby bar for each person upon check-in. Children were given bear dolls and souvenirs when leaving the hotel. The mini bar was replenished every day, as well as fruits and good night milk. , and even gave the child a snack. There were also many activities during the Spring Festival, which was really fun!

msg:A pleasant trip that exceeded expectations.
The hotel is located at the corner of Qiandao Lake with unique landscape resources. After a ten-minute drive along the winding path, arches, lighthouses, and hotels gradually came into view. Together with the natural scenery of Qiandao Lake and Xianshan Mountain, it was very eye-catching.
Because it was built in 2011 and renovated twice in 2018, I don‚Äôt have high expectations for the hotel‚Äôs software and hardware. However, the experience after moving in was good, the hardware and equipment were good, and the bedding, bathroom, and decoration were all online, very IHG. (I was fortunate enough to participate in the design of IHG's high-end luxury brand. In comparison, I found that it lacks the intelligent design of RCU and returns to the experience itself, which is quite good)
The hotel's service is quite considerate, including the connection, welcome trea**ent, extra bed service, and farewell gifts. My family members commented very well.
Finally, I would like to thank Melody, our housekeeper for this trip, who was very responsible, measured and hardworking.
Thousand Island Lake Intercontinental, see you again~

msg:This Intercontinental Hotel is located on the Xianshan Peninsula. There are few other things to do in the surrounding area. It is a hotel. There are many people during the Spring Festival, because it is more for families and children, so it is a bit lively.
Breakfast is average, with many varieties
In other places to eat, I tried the Japanese restaurant and Xian Chinese restaurant. The Japanese restaurant was average, the Chinese restaurant was good, and the afternoon tea place was average. I ordered a pot of tea and was told that there were only two cups and the price for extra cups was abstract. .
If you want to go shopping, there is Xianshan Restaurant outside the resort, which is cost-effective and has a farmhouse style. The fish heads and various stir-fried dishes are also delicious.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel has a butler for docking. The butler Amy helped me reserve a lake view room and welcome dessert fruits in advance. If I had other questions and needs, she also helped me solve them in a timely manner.
This time it happened to be during the Spring Festival, and there was a fireworks show in the evening. You could see the fireworks directly from the lake view room, which was very beautiful.

I was supposed to go to the children's playground, but the children were anxious to go back to their rooms to play games, so they didn't go.

The location of the hotel is excellent. It sits on the Xianshan Peninsula and faces the lake. You don't need to leave the hotel to be in the scenic spots and natural oxygen bar.

However, the hotel has been open for a little longer, and the air conditioner in the room cannot adjust the temperature on its own. Nick is also helpful and can change rooms. But considering that I only stayed for two nights, it was ok once I got used to it.

Overall, Intercontinental Thousand Island Lake is a good place for family vacations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

One island, one hotel, beautiful scenery, the natural environment is indeed superior. There are also the same lighthouse and moon gate of Tan Jianci...
It is also very convenient to drive here from Shanghai. It can be said to be one of the best resort hotels in the Shanghai area. When traveling with children during the winter vacation, the hotel's parent-child facilities and services are quite complete, and the children are very happy.

The ritual of the Year of the Dragon starts with tasting [New Year‚Äôs Afternoon Tea]. The afternoon sunshine in front of the floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the lobby bar is very warm and suitable for posing.
During the afternoon tea meal, the waiter explained everything one by one; when mixing the juice shaker, he interacted with the children when he saw them watching, and he was super friendly. We also gave our baby a milkshake. Manager Wade thoughtfully helped us choose a window seat and patiently introduced the different flavors of the ingredients inside.
It‚Äôs really suitable to come here to breathe oxygen during the holidays, and it‚Äôs so lively in winter! Every step we take is accompanied by the crisp chirping of birds, which is suitable for workers like us who work in the Shanghai circle. The hotel is directly opposite the open Qiandao Lake. Half a lake and half a mountain, there is a strange feeling of the mountains being empty and covered with rain. Being able to see the golden sunset in winter is the biggest surprise of the day... Sure enough, nature is the most healing~
Finally, I would like to praise the staff in the hotel‚Äôs WeChat fan group for their excellent service. They contacted me before checking in to arrange a room. The lake view family room has a very good view. They responded promptly if I had any questions. They helped me make an appoin**ent for a travel shoot. They were also very special in shooting. Thoughtful, I will definitely come back next time.

2. If you want to borrow a swimming ring for a short period of indoor swimming, you will be charged RMB 30.
3. There was no reminder for the scheduled items. Even if I arrived near the concierge desk early and waited, no one greeted me and I was left behind. There was no one to remind me about the gift items, how to redeem the coupons and where to use them. When it was time to use them, the redemption failed.

msg:I booked a lake view parent-child room on the 7th floor. The view from the room is very good. The children's bed in the parent-child room is very large against the window, so the children can sleep very loosely.
The indoor children's playground is also large.
The whole hotel is very quiet, which is more suitable for relaxing.
The housekeeper Nick added WeChat on the morning of check-in, provided some project schedules in the hotel, and also helped to make reservations for children's kitchen activities. He was very enthusiastic and hopes to check in again next time.

The view from the room was so beautiful that I was in a daze on the balcony of the room on the first day. Bella also actively cooperated with us and tried her best to meet our requirements when we checked in. We would like to express our gratitude to her. Our housekeeper Melody was also conscientious and had a good attitude. She would help arrange many things and even offered to put an aromatherapy diffuser in the room. , smells much better. I have stayed at InterContinental many times, and this is the first time I write a review for Intercontinental. I really feel that the scenery is great and I enjoyed my stay, which is why it is worth writing. All in all, I was very satisfied with my stay this time.

The hotel is in an excellent location, at the foot of Mount Xian on the edge of Qiandao Lake. There is a lake in front and a mountain behind. You can watch the water and climb the mountains without leaving the hotel. As a resort, the hotel not only has good hardware, many activities, but also really good service. Nick, the butler, added WeChat in advance. He has very strong execution ability and can meet any last-minute requests. It can be seen from him that the hotel butler's service is very measured, makes people feel comfortable, and responds to requests in a timely manner. Alas, he focuses on attentive service. None of the staff we met at the front desk, restaurant, concierge, or guest room said no to our requests or questions. They were all good and OK. This feeling of being fulfilled is really great. I left a message to the room service that I didn't need to wash the pot, and the staff member Ms. Liu Xia also responded to me on the paper, OK. This kind of communication makes people feel interactive, responsive, equal and friendly, and really caring. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs terrace. I liked it very much when I saw the photos. When I actually arrived, I felt that it was just like the feeling in my imagination, a portrayal of ideals reflected in reality! The InterContinental Hotel is the best anywhere. It‚Äôs the kind that gives 100 points and a five-pointed star. That‚Äôs great!

You can have a lot of fun without leaving the hotel. The hotel has raised little rabbits and little ducks, and we come to take a look at them every day.
The children liked the little bear provided in the hotel‚Äôs parent-child room. Before leaving, they repeatedly asked if they could take it with them. Afraid of being separated from the cute little bear. Because there were two children, in order to prevent the children from grabbing a bear, the housekeeper Melody specially gave us an extra bear. She was very caring about the check-in situation throughout the stay, which was very considerate.
Intercontinental Park is a must-visit place for children every day. It has rich activity facilities and is divided into age groups.
There are also many hotel activities every day. We participated in the Huangshan Jiandeng Island and hiking tours. The tour guide Xiao Jiang was also very energetic. This time it was the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, and the hotel had a lantern lighting event at night.
In terms of food, the hotel‚Äôs Chinese restaurant‚Äôs fermented glutinous rice dumplings have been recognized by picky babies. It was great to have ice cream for breakfast. Afternoon tea is also good.
The aunt who turned down the bed was very considerate. I forgot to ask her name.
Overall, the hotel is very suitable for a leisure vacation. I heard from Xiao Jiang who was hiking that the ginkgo trees in front of the hotel will turn golden in November, which should be very suitable for taking pictures. I would like to come and see if I have the opportunity.

Overall, The service is still very good. Thanks to the butler Melody for arranging it, we arranged a room with a great view. Other activities and meals were also directly arranged by the butler. The room is large and the most important thing is the amazing view. The fish head soup at Xian Restaurant downstairs is very good. The fish meat is firm and sweet, and the soup is moderately salty. The other dishes are also very good. Although it is more expensive than other restaurants, it is worth the price. It is definitely worth a try. The surrounding environment of the hotel is very good. After eating It is very pleasant to have a meal or stroll around the lake in the morning. The hotel is located on the Xianshan Peninsula, which is very quiet but indeed remote. It is not recommended for self-driving guests to arrive at night (especially novice drivers), as the mountain roads are not well lit. There are many activities in the hotel, which is suitable for those who want to travel in depth. You can enjoy the scenery of Qiandao Lake without leaving the hotel. I will choose Intercontinental next time I go to Qiandao Lake.

Considering the location of the hotel is relatively remote, so I only stayed for one night. One day is not enough. Next time I go to Qiandao Lake, I will only stay at Intercontinental!

msg:I uploaded all the photos taken in the children's playground for mothers' reference. P6 and p7 are photos of the manual class. P9 and p10 are the indoor swimming pool and outdoor swimming pool respectively. p12-14 are part of the buffet dishes. p16 is the schedule of activities in August. P19-20 is the restaurant outside the hotel. This Xianshan Hotel has a good business and the taste is quite satisfactory.
Let me expand on this: 1. I booked an executive room. The hotel has an executive lounge, where afternoon tea is provided, and dinner can also be settled in the executive lounge. Or go for a cocktail after a meal, there is a menu, and the staff will make it. 2. Floating boards are provided free of charge in the hotel's indoor and outdoor swimming pools, on a first-come, first-served basis. 3. P15 is a fish pond, which can feed fish and ducks. You can ask for the feed from the staff at the hotel‚Äôs canteen. The canteen didn‚Äôt clearly write about this experience, so you asked yourself. 4. The hotel staff will contact you the day before check-in. On the morning of the check-in day, the housekeeper will add you on WeChat. If you need anything, you can tell the housekeeper. 5. The play facilities in the hotel are actually not very suitable for quiet girls. There are more boys playing here, and the play facilities for parents and children are still a little bit less.

msg:I liked the brand of InterContinental and chose to stay. I still have some feelings after I brought my children here.
It is said that it is a parent-child hotel that is very suitable for bringing children to stay. I personally think it is especially suitable for younger children. They will not be too tired. The environment in the hotel is very good and beautiful, and there are many interactive activities.
The kneading activity starts at 10:00 am, and sugar painting begins at 2:00 pm. There are dolls who will interact with each other, but it usually takes 20 minutes to line up. Events are free.
Intercontinental Paradise is free, but there is one thing I hope the store pays attention to. I followed it by myself. In some places, the foam pads are bulging and uneven, and children may fall down.
I stayed in a lake view room, the lake view is a bit far away, but it is very beautiful, the balcony is not big, but there is a sofa to lie on, a small wooden round table, and a drying rack, but it is semi-closed, when it rains Clothes may get wet.
I chose the 2400 deluxe lake view room type, but there is no usb interface, and the toilet is not smart, but I have prepared a disposable toilet mat and bathtub bag.
Juice and beer in the fridge are free, as is capsule coffee.
There is a reminder to friends who are staying here that the yacht must be booked one day in advance to reach the top of Huangshan Mountain. We didn't notice that it was already past 5 o'clock when we checked in, because we didn't make an appoin**ent and couldn't go to the island the next day. It's a little pity.
The road to the hotel is winding mountains. Friends who suffer from motion sickness should prepare motion sickness medicine in advance.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich and tastes good!
At the end of the checkout, the beautiful young lady presented a gift, and it was a pity that the children's toys were gone.
This hotel is a bit far from the central island area, so think about it when choosing, but the scenery of the hotel itself is very good, you can choose it with children.

But deficiencies still have to be raised.
1. The water from the bathtub is sandy and dirty.
2. I didn‚Äôt believe in evil, so I insisted on taking a dip in the bathtub and was bitten by a flea (fleas are most afraid of water)
3. The power of the air conditioner is not enough. Once the weather gets hot, the lake view suite will be directly baked by the sun all afternoon. Be mentally prepared for the heatüò≠
4. The lake view suite looks very beautiful, but the outdoor sofa is not practical because it is too hot and sunny. It is better to drink and cool down by the pool. So is the executive lounge.
5. Huangshanjian is recommended by everyone, but after seeing the mountains and rivers at home and abroad, I personally think it is very average. In China, it is far worse than Zhangjiajie.
Brothers and sisters, it‚Äôs 300+50 yuan. If you add another 100 yuan, you can get a ride in a Rolls-Royce.

As far as Huangshanjian is concerned, even driving from the high-speed rail station to the hotel, the scenery on the road is better than this.

msg:When visiting Qiandao Lake, you don‚Äôt have to go through so much trouble to choose a hotel. I only choose Intercontinental. If you travel during off-peak hours, you can have exclusive use of the outdoor swimming pool. Vacationing doesn‚Äôt have to be so hard, and no homework is required. Food, beautiful scenery, the best facilities, and the best services can all be solved in one hotel. Open the window, lie on the bed and watch the sunset over the lake. It's so beautiful.

The hotel service is considerate and in place, and the butler's service is very meticulous and considers the guests from their perspective. The only drawback is that the sound of the air conditioner is a bit loud at night, it is very stuffy when it is not turned on, and the humidity is a bit high. There is a balcony in the room to dry clothes. Unfortunately, it has been raining from time to time in the past two days, so the clothes never dry and get wet. The housekeeper introduced us to the Coucoq clothing care machine in the room, which was indeed amazing! It dries clothes and swimsuits quite quickly. Later, I kept taking all the clothes out of the closet and putting them in here, saying that they can be sterilized and kept away from moisture and bacteria.

The breakfast is very rich, including Chinese, Western and Japanese buffets, so there is no need to go out of the hotel to find food. Prepare to buy IHG three times on November 1, it is the best place for lazy people to vacation.

Our butler Nick was also very nice. , responded in a timely manner and helped us contact us to provide bed rails, bottle sterilizers, and bathtubs.

msg:Too bad. I have never stayed in such a bad five-star hotel.
The location of the room given by the front desk was too bad. In the rush to check out more than 200 rooms (the front desk said it himself), the room was so bad. The room booked at the regular price of more than 1,400 yuan was not as good as the good room purchased by others for a few hundred yuan a day. The scenery is very hip-lifting
The facilities in the room are outdated. When I entered the room, I just wanted to walk out. The corridor and the room were full of rotten and rusty smell. The cushions on the bedside were all moldy. The whole bed was uneven, with high and low pits. It was also extremely hard to lie down on it without taking sleeping pills. I can't sleep. The beds in chain hotels are more comfortable than this five-star one.
No matter how you turn on the air conditioner, it doesn't work. The temperature in the room is annoying.
Price aside, how can such a facility be considered five-star?
I canceled the reservation early and the hotel was still rude. I still refused to end the order. I ended the order on the original date. I insisted on staying for one night and checked out early. When I checked out, I contacted the front desk manager and wanted to give us financial compensation. But we refused and said this was the difference. I gave it a rating

msg:Environment: Surrounded by mountains and rivers, InterContinental enjoys a lake area exclusively, with a wide view and excellent scenery. Be sure to book lake view rooms and suites, where you can watch the sunrise and sunset. You must stay for more than two days. There are many activities in the hotel, basically all of which are free, and you can‚Äôt enjoy it. In fact, you can climb mountains in the surrounding area, and there are many scenic spots, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Lotus Peak, etc., but most of the tourists I don't know, it's a pity.


Xianshan Xiayi Afternoon Tea: It‚Äôs a bit of false propaganda. I bought the package from Ctrip, but I went to say that it will end in June. I contacted Ctrip and found that Ctrip didn‚Äôt know about it, and Ctrip itself couldn‚Äôt contact InterContinental to sell it. The sales director of the afternoon tea, fortunately, the customer service manager of Ctrip actively defended my rights and resolved the matter. In fact, it is more expensive to buy this afternoon tea at the hotel alone, because there are few things.


Service: Actually, the service of this InterContinental is not that strong. It can be seen that the usual training is not very good, because there are pearls and jade in the front. I just came from Suzhou Zhongyin InterContinental last week. Compared with the friendly smiles of every service staff in Suzhou Zhongyin , it‚Äôs like I owe them here, including the front desk of the hotel who also has an impatient attitude towards the guests. After a few days of the whole trip, only an uncle who moved flowers and plants in the guest room passed by and said good afternoon to me. The others walked with their heads down. It is better to go directly to the InterContinental Membership Service Office for matters.

Compared with this kind of service awareness, the focus here is to praise my little butler, Nick Su Zhou. He may be dedicated to serving members. This service awareness is very strong. When I contacted me in the early stage, there was a little misunderstanding about membership rights. , but immediately showed the professional level of InterContinental. All questions were answered immediately and followed up to solve them, and they were all done by himself. He upgraded me to a suite with a view of the sunset. Although I originally booked a lake view, but The suite has two balconies to see the scenery even better! I hope other guests will be lucky enough to meet him too!

In addition, I would like to commend the lifeguards in the InterContinental's swimming pool depar**ent. All swimming activities here are free, but the service level in the swimming pool depar**ent is very high. The lifeguards are on duty all day long. I have observed them and they are all For those without mobile phones, their eyes are always patrolling every adult and child to ensure safety. Especially Fang Zihao, the two lifeguards in Huangjiang City, who are extremely responsible, will also interact with children, and even witnessed Fang Zihao saving a child on the evening of the third day of stay! ! ! There is also Guangpeng, the host of the pool party every night. No matter how many children there are, he hosts the event seriously. He answers every "boring" question of the children seriously. Some children cry and he even gives small gifts to comfort them. Every child who enters the swimming pool is unwilling to leave~

It can be said that Su Zhou, Fang Zihao, Huang Jiangcheng and Guangpeng are the ones who brought back the face of Qiandao Lake Intercontinental!

During the summer vacation, although I chose to check in on a weekday, it was already 3 o'clock in the hotel, but I still couldn't get the room. The front desk urged me several times, and the solution I got was to give a few drink coupons in the lobby bar, let us sit wait. After finally getting to the room, the cleanliness of the room was actually not satisfactory. There were even long hairs on the towels. I don‚Äôt know if it was not changed at all or what, but the 4 and a half hours‚Äô drive, plus more than 1 hour of waiting, was enough. Unable to give feedback to the front desk. The toiletries are from BYREDO, they smell good, and the hair will not dry after shampooing and bathing. The disadvantage is that there is no soap.
The hotel has complete facilities, including indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a children's playground, a small train, and there are free and charged activities. You can play if you don't leave the hotel or near the hotel. There are also many online celebrity check-in spots suitable for taking pictures.
The breakfast variety is also good, there are quite a lot of things.

The welcome at the door is very warm and will help you unload your luggage. The entrance of the hotel is a large circular glass window. The lake view outside the glass is reflected in the pool, like a painting. The front desk of the hotel was warm and courteous.

I originally bought a buffet dinner for 2 large and 1 small, but I was told that there was no more at the store. I was a little disappointed. Dinner We ordered a set meal, which tasted good but was expensive. Rooms also have turndown service. The hotel called me to confirm the itinerary before departure. The butler Joze was attentive and thoughtful, answering all my questions and responding in a timely manner. All in all, the family of three are very satisfied with the hotel. As long as you have enough on hand, I highly recommend it.

Small train, 50 yuan per person, children are calculated according to their height. It takes about 20 minutes to go around the hotel. It is too hot, but it will blow you with a small fan. It is recommended to bring iced drinks or water It will be better. 3. The hotel has a cruise ship directly to the Huangshan Peak scenic spot, the cost is 300 per person (adult), children are calculated according to their height, including round-trip summons and scenic spot tickets. The cable car costs 50 yuan per person, and children are calculated according to their height, which can be bought on board.

The water and minibar are also replenished in a timely manner. She also puts milk in the afternoon when cleaning and has helped turn the bed down. She is very considerate. 3. A girl waitress in the cafeteria wanted to ask her name today, but she ended up taking six days off and one day off. She didn‚Äôt ask after the rest. Every time I went to the restaurant for dinner, the service was very active and thoughtful, with a smile on her face, making her feel at home.

msg:After researching on Ctrip for a long time, I found that this hotel has the highest rating among Qiandao Lake hotels, so I bought a 3 days and 2 nights pre-sale package of elegant lake view twin room. This package is basically 1,000 more expensive than the lake bay room package, but it feels like The scenery is average, not as good as expected. Let‚Äôs talk about the rooms first. All lake view rooms are on the 4th floor. The floor is low and the view is not spectacular. Because the B&B on Anji Mountain where we stayed the night before has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 square meters, there is a big psychological gap in staying in this lake view room. A little too small. The facilities in the room are basically complete. The TV is very small and cannot be seen clearly when lying on the bed. The temperature of the air conditioner in the room is not low enough. It may be due to central control. It can only be adjusted to a minimum of 18 degrees. However, the room faces west and it is very hot in the afternoon and evening. Hot, this temperature is not good. Shampoo, shower gel, hand soap and body lotion may all come in large cans for environmental reasons and use the leftovers from the guests. This is not good for the guests. After all, they are afraid that others will add more to the cans. thing. Service is the only selling point of this hotel. When I checked in, the front desk patiently explained hotel activities and precautions. Because I am a single person traveling with my elderly parents on a reverse parent-child trip, I need to add breakfast for one person. The front desk took the initiative to inform me of the hotel guests. There is a discount for adding breakfast, and I paid 258 for breakfast on the last two days. The hotel basically responds to requests within a reasonable range. It delivers two boxes of Yili milk every day, Nongfu Spring has enough pipes, the room is cleaned in a timely manner, and supplies are replenished. The only thing missing is that the men's razor was not put away. We later asked the waiter for it. , after all, it‚Äôs quite uncomfortable for boys not to shave for two days. For families without children, half of the items included in the pre-sale package are useless and useless. The only things that can be used are the afternoon tea coupons and beer coupons, but the package includes breakfast for two people for two days, so it is still better than It's a good deal to book a room alone, and with afternoon tea, the price difference is about 500. Let‚Äôs talk about the food in the hotel. I personally feel that the original price of 181 per person for breakfast is a bit expensive. The Western kitchen is okay and the cakes are delicious. The Chinese kitchen is just so-so. The fried buns and small wontons have more skin and less meat. The meat in the Chinese and Western kitchens is OK. There isn't much choice, which is not very friendly to a meat lover like me. The original price of the afternoon tea seems to be 275, which is a bit too high. It is a three-layer birdcage. The middle layer is salty. The most expensive ingredients are probably the salmon and a few fish roes. It feels like it is only suitable for posing, and the taste is average. . On the morning of the last day, the housekeeper would take the initiative to ask if we wanted to check out late. We wanted to go home early, so we didn‚Äôt check out late. When we checked out at the front desk, we would give the guest a bag of small gifts, and the stuffed bear toy was quite cute. This hotel is more suitable for children under 12 years old. Older friends may find it boring. The hotel environment is generally good and there are several views. It is enough for young people to stay for one night. If you drive by yourself, you can stay for a few more days. It is boring. You can drive out for fun. If you are bringing an elderly person, it is recommended to stay for two nights and leave one and a half days to explore the scenery in the hotel. Generally speaking, this hotel is okay, and the staff are very kind. I hope to launch more pre-sale packages suitable for young and elderly people during the off-season. After all, as the birth rate decreases, these two consumer groups can increase the hotel's off-season income. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Nick and the front desk lady for their considerate service. I wish you all the best in your work and see you again~

msg:The service is very poor. What is the reason that InterContinental seems to be on the verge of bankruptcy? The doorman and front desk seem to have never received hotel management training. I don't know if they can't pay wages or something. They are very unfriendly to guests, let alone service! Instead of enjoying my stay in this hotel, I was completely annoyed! The facilities are old, the sanitation is extremely poor, and the house price is nearly 2,000, I suggest you don‚Äôt fall into this trap!

The hotel also gives free upgrades to the parent-child room with lake view, balcony and floor-to-ceiling windows. The high-grade bathtub is also superb. The intercontinental lung washing trip is absolutely amazing and I look forward to staying at the Intercontinental next time.

The scenery is quite good.
Due to schedule reasons, I didn‚Äôt catch up with the hotel‚Äôs own travel photography.
I just took some pictures myself. Moon Gate is very popular. The following pictures were taken in and around the hotel.
The little housekeeper Kaia answered all questions, thank you very much.

The weather was great, making it perfect for any photo shoot. The Ctrip package we ordered also only allowed travel photography, which was great. The staff are very nice. The photographer also interacts with the children and adjusts the a**osphere. I am very satisfied.
The hotel has 2 indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Lifeguards are always there and the water quality is very clean.
There is also a children's playground, which is almost reserved.
In addition to there being almost no food around the hotel, takeout is also difficult. Everything else felt good, and the afternoon tea included in the set meal was actually quite delicious. Overall a very enjoyable trip.

msg:The first time I stayed at the InterContinental Qiandao Lake gave me the feeling of staying at the InterContinental in Shenzhen OCT, with sunshine‚òÄÔ∏è, swimming pool, and service! Very comfortable!

The gym is very good, and there is also a yoga room. It is very comfortable to stretch after training. The outdoor environment is beautiful! It‚Äôs nice to walk around the hotel, and if you like moderate-intensity running, climbing up the hills is also great! Tandem cycling is very interesting and requires certain physical strength and skills.

The housekeeper Melody was very considerate. My wife was stung by a bee on her thigh and it hurt a lot. The housekeeper immediately came over with medicine to help my daughter apply it. She suggested preparing a bottle or two of Thai grass oin**ent, which is very effective against mosquito bites.

It's a pity that I didn't have the dinner buffet.

All in all great! Will go next time!

It has been sent to the cloakroom in the room~
After resting for a while, I walked around the hotel. The dinner on the first day was a buffet in the hotel. It cost more than 500 for two big ones and one small~ It felt very cost-effective~ After a good dinner, the children played in the Ali playground in the hotel until 9:00 ~~ There is no need to worry that the children will have no playmates~~ There is a massage chair next to it~ I fell asleep sitting on the massage chair~~
The next morning I slept until 9 o'clock~ I went downstairs to have a buffet breakfast~~ The omelette made by the omelet brother was really delicious~ My baby said it was the best omelet she had ever eaten~~ Have a good breakfast Lou, the little brother of the kneader is at work~~Everyone is consciously queuing up~ As long as it is an animal, the little brother can make it out, but there are other children who chose Ultraman, Piggy Page, Kulomi, Melody~ I ate the stovetop chicken at the Xian Xiao Restaurant next to the hotel at noon üêî~ The chicken is very fresh~ very delicious~ the price is also quite affordable! In the afternoon, I took a yacht to Huangshan Jiandao, overlooking the entire Qiandao Lake~ the scenery is extremely beautiful! After returning to the hotel, the children participated in the pre-booked small kitchen activity and made sushi by themselves~ They even took it back to the room to share with us~ They still ate the hotel buffet for dinner, the children liked it very much~~ Oh yes! The prawns are really fresh! ! Very sweet! ! There was a thunderstorm at night‚õàÔ∏è, so we swam in the indoor swimming pool and had a water fight~There were several security guards next to me~Very safe~~The pool can swim until 10:30pm~~The water is very clean~
After breakfast on the third morning, I happened to meet the little brother Tanghua (that is, the little brother who kneads dough). The little brother was very patient. We went early and there were not many people. He even made two sugar paintings for my family treasure! The children are so happy! Lunch is eaten at the Xianshan Restaurant next door. A set meal is enough for the group, and the amount is very large! The fish soup is so delicious~ I would like to mention here that the fish soup in the buffet in the hotel also tastes the same~ it is delicious! ! Will definitely drink several bowls! In the afternoon, we walked around a few photo spots nearby and then headed back home~~ My baby said that we will come again next time! Next time I plan to play for two more days~~Intercontinental is really the best choice! !

Shanghai‚ÜíQiandao Lake high-speed rail is 2 hours, because I took 2 old people and 1 child and chose to rent a car in advance to drive to the hotel (although the hotel has 25 yuan per person. The bus picks up the high-speed rail station, but the time should be checked in advance), the hotel‚Äôs 10-kilometer private road is not nonsense, there are about 3-4 parking spots along the way to enjoy the scenery of Qiandao Lake. The front desk saw that the four of us helped us upgrade the parent-child room with a lake view. It was quite caring. Breakfast can be eaten until 10:30, which is very suitable for us who don‚Äôt get up early. By the way, we solved lunch. Don‚Äôt even think about taking out here. Well, after all, the location is too remote. But Xian Xiao Restaurant outside the hotel is a good choice (if you don‚Äôt drive or don‚Äôt want to go too far, you can eat here), if you drive, go out to eat directly Recommended: Wanji Chuncai House, Big Fish and Shrimp, Chunyuanwai ( Personal test is delicious, and the price is high). The hotel's various activities are enough to fill up the daily time, parent-child interaction, sugar painting, dough figurines, feeding small animals, large indoor activity area, outdoor cycling, 1 indoor swimming pool and 2 outdoor swimming pools, outdoor on sunny days Pool parties, carnivals, and more. According to your own needs, there is always a reason why you want to come again.

The auntie on the floor has a very good attitude and a sense of service.
The room has a beautiful view and the surrounding environment is super nice, very suitable for relaxation.
It's amazing that there are very few mosquitoes around in such a humid and hot weather. The balcony door is often left open, and I saw mosquito repellent in the room, but I didn't see any.

Except for the fact that the child was scratched by an unknown sharp object while swimming in the outdoor pool, they are basically satisfied. The lifeguards arrived at the scene quickly, disinfected and bandaged the bleeding, and disposed of it in a timely manner. The hotel provided a large number of band-aids and the manager comforted him. As a result, I was a little helpless and regretful that I couldn't swim for the next two days.

Last night at 10 Contact the butler to make an appoin**ent for the yacht landing service this morning, and they responded instantly. I couldn't go to the restaurant for breakfast because I got up late in the morning. The restaurant is very user-friendly. You can pack the food and eat it on the yacht, which is very good. There are also many recreational facilities and activities in the hotel, and there are also Internet celebrity check-in spots. It is enough to stay in the hotel. Because the child is a bit old, I still went out of the hotel to play some surrounding attractions. All in all very satisfied. I will choose to stay here next time. There is also a souvenir upon leaving the store.

From a close look, there is a stone roof underneath, which is blocked by some trees. From a distance, the view is still good, and you can see the lake view. Although there are many people in the whole hotel, it feels very quiet, and the sound insulation of the rooms is also very good. Later, I stayed at Kaiyuan Resort for one night. When I checked in, the lobby was noisy, and the room was not as good as the InterContinental. Of course, Kaiyuan also has the advantages of Kaiyuan. We took the small intercontinental train, which didn‚Äôt feel very interesting. We walked around with the tour guide, and it was okay. We fed the ducklings and koi. There were more mosquitoes in the evening. We went to the lighthouse to take pictures, and the view over there was very good. In the evening, after dinner, we went to Intercontinental Paradise. The children played and we played table tennis. It was very comfortable. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools are nice.

msg:Don't come for couples, let alone parents and children! ! This Qiandaohu InterContinental is really dark all my life. As a senior customer of InterContinental, I have stayed in various brand hotels of InterContinental in different cities (including Indigo, Voco, etc.) for many times. There has been such an exaggerated situation here in Qiandaohu Intercontinental. How many people are attracted by sweet potatoes and a certain sound? Let me talk about the bad situation:
1: The service capacity of the hotel is obviously unable to meet the current passenger flow. The check-in queue time is long, and there are only 2 staff members at the front desk to check in, which is extremely inefficient. Just ask the management team of Qiandao Lake InterContinental. What is the first impression of the low efficiency on the guests?
2. The hotel facilities are old. I saw the renovation in 2018 on the platform. I thought the facilities would not be very new but they would not be so dilapidated (‚ö†Ô∏èI used dilapidated ones here). Cabinet door, room door, coffee table, bedside table, damaged wallpaper, and the funny thing is that the hair dryer uses Reifen (a fake Dyson), which is completely inconsistent with the IHG brand. If it is an express hotel, maybe I can accept it, but it is under the InterContinental brand. For the Intercontinental Hotel of this brand, I really can‚Äôt laugh or cry. All the spare parts are in large bottles. Let‚Äôs not talk about environmental protection. It always makes people feel that the hygiene of large bottles is not as good as that of small bottles. Every guest can get a comfortable set.
3. The hotel is mainly for parents and children. The InterContinental Children's Paradise advertises that it has an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 1,500 square meters. The actual facilities are very few, and there are traces of repairs everywhere. It is also old and dilapidated. Children don't want to stay longer after playing for 10 minutes.
4. There are no disposable slippers in the room, so you need to call the front desk to send them to the room. I really don't understand this operation. The bathtub has obvious stains, and the mirror has obvious water stains, hey.
5. Let‚Äôs talk about the dining situation. There is really nothing delicious in the buffet for 258 people. The salmon in the sashimi area is of average quality, and there are even artificial synthetic fish such as vegetarian abalone and Greek dace. The beef and mutton in the barbecue area can also be imported. The clip went to get the skewers, and the food was served very slowly, and there was almost nothing else to come out, and then the waiter's amazing operation came again, and the meal was not over yet, and they came to urge good reviews from table to table. . . Is this what should happen in a five-star hotel restaurant? I am already drunk without drinking.
6. Breakfast the next day, I entered the venue at 9 o‚Äôclock. I queued up at the door and refused to let people in. I asked the waiter and told me that there was no room. I have stayed in hotels of various grades countless times on weekdays, and I was stopped outside the restaurant for the first time. Waited about 10 minutes. The foreman reacted dully and did not give a solution. He told him to wait patiently. There were already about 10 people behind him. Everyone expressed surprise and surprise. This was what happened at Intercontinental. There is no beef noodles from InterContinental for breakfast. I am drunk again. There are not many varieties of breakfast and the quality is not high.
7. The management of the hotel swimming pool is lacking, people without swimming caps abound, and no one reminds them. Getting rid of the swimming pool and wearing a swimming cap is the most basic requirement?
Advantages: Exclusive access to the Xianshan Peninsula, with turndown service.
I strongly hope that InterContinental's management can see this comment. I really can't bear to see InterContinental lose all its excellent image in consumers' minds in front of an unprofessional team.

msg:The quality of Intercontinental is still excellent.
It's very suitable for baby walks, especially for young babies who need to take a nap. You can feed small animals and look at the lighthouse. The environment is super value and beautiful, and the service attitude is very good
The hotel facilities are still online, the room lights may be a little dark, and it is not suitable for storytelling at night.
The indoor swimming pool is clean and there are not many people. It is very comfortable.
The butler service is very considerate. Kaia helped us a lot and upgraded the view room. The activity of feeding the small animals is over, but he still helped us find a suitable feed for the ducklings. The baby had a great time and even gave the baby a small gift when we left.
Will come again next time!

I received a phone call from the hotel to confirm the day before I checked in, and then arranged for the housekeeper Kaia. Kaia is very enthusiastic and careful. She helped me according to my needs. Thank you very much for making reservations for fun projects, and answering all my water needs one by one. Then when the hotel arrived at the store and learned that we were 2 adults and 2 children, they upgraded the room type for us for free. The children were so happy that they didn't want to go home after playing. I am also very satisfied with the cleanliness of the hotel. It is cleaned in a timely manner, twice a day, because there are too many children and the bathroom is in a mess. When we go out for dinner, they have already cleaned it up for us and have milk and water for good night. Well, there is also a thoughtful note, which gave us a surprise. At the same time, the restaurants in the hotel are really delicious. The children and children are very happy to eat. I will continue to choose InterContinental next time. The five-star service makes people feel at ease.

msg:This trip left a good impression on InterContinental. I monopolize the Xianshan Peninsula, drive in, and when I finally see the hotel, I feel like a soup house in Spirited Away. The facilities and design of the hotel do not feel old, but have texture and taste. Our lake view room can see the open and bright Qiandao Lake view and the misty Xianshan mountain view in the early morning. The service is also good, butler-style service makes people feel at home, such as welcome fruit, adjusting the amount of drinking water according to the needs of guests, handwritten good night cards, etc. The cutting-edge travel photography that comes with the hotel is also highly recommended. The photographer and makeup artist are very professional. The overall shooting and selection experience is very good, and the finished film is also very exciting! In short, Qiandaohu InterContinental is ranked among the top 5 hotel series here, for a wonderful journey and exciting experience.

msg:Thought that even if the old hotel is old, the quality is still good. After thousands of choices, I booked the Intercontinental and felt that the experience was too bad

To go to the hotel, you can book a bus in advance. It is very convenient to get on the bus when you get out of the train station, but you have to check the time carefully, 25 yuan per person

The scenery along the way to the hotel is beautiful

Arriving at the hotel happened to be the time for the Huangshanjian cruise in the afternoon. The lobby was so crowded that when we told the reception staff to check in, we were guided to the cruise reception. At this time, the reception gave out disposable raincoats to everyone for free.

After checking in, I went to the room in the building across the corridor from the lobby. When I walked in, there was an old musty smell. When I entered the room, there was also a musty smell. Then I found that the air conditioner was not cooling and the air outlet was moldy in a large area. The TV could not adjust the sound and called the front desk. I asked the master to repair the air conditioner for a long time, but it still didn't work, and finally changed the room

After we arrived, we went to a western restaurant to eat. We have never eaten such poor food in a high-end hotel. It should be quick-frozen food. It is really hard to eat. After eating it, the waiter asked us to give us a good review and send ice cream. I really can‚Äôt give it a good review. It‚Äôs useless to give away anything. After reading the reviews, I guess those good reviews are due to the ice cream.

Besides, the dinner was served at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel for two nights. The taste is reasonable, but the service is beyond words You still have to wait for them to clean up. Compared with the price, it is really worthless.

The hotel has a cruise ship to the top of Huangshan Mountain, which costs 300 yuan per person and half price for children. It is said to be a luxury yacht, but it is actually very ordinary. There is a one-way cable car ticket to buy. It rained all day on the day we went, but the hotel didn't give tourists raincoats and couldn't buy them around.

The park near the hotel is very beautiful and the hotel's own garden is also good
Swimming pool is available, children's playground is available

breakfast is not good
the little train is not running

The service is not good. Our package includes a native chicken package. We need to go to the gift shop to redeem it. As a result, the staff at the reception is probably new. They don‚Äôt know how to handle it, so they didn‚Äôt handle it well. We couldn‚Äôt exchange it when we went to the restaurant to pay the bill and then called the hotel front desk to deal with it.

The coffee in the hotel lobby is 30 to 40 hot, and 50 to 60 cold. I told my colleagues that you should buy hot coffee and ask for a few pieces of ice.

Xian Xiaoguan Traditional Stove Chicken Set Menu: Yes, better than hotel restaurants, and cost-effective

They were all booked by the housekeeper, and the location is very good. The housekeeper was very attentive and even sent mosquito coils to our room.
The lake view room has a good view, and the room is quite large. I especially like the outdoor sofa design on the balcony, so I can comfortably watch the scenery in the room.
Breakfast and afternoon tea are okay, mainly with lake view. There is also the chopped pepper fish head in the Chinese restaurant, which is very delicious.

msg:The scenery and air of Qiandao Lake are very good. The hotel occupies an excellent location but it does not meet the standard of Intercontinental. Check-in does not take the initiative to inform the breakfast location and does not introduce the opening hours of important hotel-related facilities. The outdoor swimming pool of the resort hotel will be closed at noon, and such important information is not informed in advance, so many children ran over after changing their swimsuits to be informed that it is closed, which spoils the children's interest. Room service calls went unanswered for long periods of time. The small train is required to make up the difference according to the height. The actual coupons presented by Ctrip are considered children under the age of 15. If you don‚Äôt pay attention, you will have to pay more. There is no staff for cute pet feeding, and I don't know where to get the feed. I wanted to drive a go-kart and contacted the go-kart staff, saying that I was a third party, and asked me to contact the hotel. I found the hotel service staff and said that I couldn‚Äôt drive it. I don‚Äôt know if there is something between the hotel and the third party. The door panel of the refrigerator in the room is damaged and will pinch your hands. The buffet breakfast and dinner service staff are guarding the door with POS machines. Children line up to measure their heights. It can be chaotic to take a seat, and the dishes can be unfamiliar, but you can‚Äôt spend a penny. The last time I met a hotel with a pos machine to guard the door was Conrad Xiamen. To sum up, the hotel is very friendly to children on the surface, but the actual details are very bad! Next time I come to Qiandao Lake, I will not consider InterContinental!

The hotel room is larger and the room service is more thoughtful. Towels will be changed in the afternoon and milk will be delivered in the evening. This is more thoughtful. The hotel is relatively large and has its own dock. The top of the mountain is just right for three days and two nights. There is no need to go to other places. The cruise ship to the top of Huangshan is also a better sofa seat. The time for sightseeing is enough. It is enough time to go to the top of Huangshan in the morning without being too tired. Generally speaking, the scenery of Qiandao Lake is really good. The hotel service and food are all online

The balcony and floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the hotel room are facing the large lake. There are many children playing in the infinity swimming pool downstairs. The hotel's small train, pottery bar, bicycles, children's playground, animal feeding, gym, and spa can make everyone find their own comfort. The chef's skills in the hotel's Chinese restaurant are really good, and I recommend everyone to try it (the hotel's Japanese food is average in price and taste, so I don't recommend it). Since my spine is not very good, I am more concerned about the comfort of the mattress. InterContinental's mattress has moderate hardness and perfect support. I especially looked at the brand of king koil, which should be the hotel's first model, planting grass. I also like InterContinental's toiletries, which are the brand of Bairuide. Before returning, I went to the Ministry of Commerce to buy shampoo, shower gel and body lotion. InterContinental's butler service is very good. Before check-in, the butler Xiao Guan introduced the hotel's activities in July in detail. On the day of check-in, he helped to check in quickly. During the stay, I also made reservations for the hotel's afternoon tea and yacht activities according to my needs, which was very considerate. During the peak season of summer vacation, we remind everyone that the hotel seats and various activities must be reserved in advance.

I thought the InterContinental side would be more biased, but I didn't want to leave after I came. The hotel has complete facilities, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, various lakeside bars, garden trails, bicycle rentals, basically meeting all the needs for relaxing on weekends. The surrounding scenic spots are not as noisy as the main scenic spot, but they are fresh, quiet and clean. Walking up and down along the trail will not be too tiring, and you can feel the nature and see the lake and mountains. I couldn't see the sunset on a rainy day, but it was an unexpected joy to pick red bayberry at this time.

3. Entertainment items: indoor and outdoor swimming pools, outdoor swimming pools and bubble parties or magic carpets in the afternoon, small trains, multi-person bicycles (don't forget that it's too hot and too tired to go uphill, I'm almost tired and stupid), children's playground.

There are also Internet celebrity check-in points such as the lighthouse, walk for 15 minutes, look at the trees and fish on the sidewalk, and feel that you will arrive soon.

The hotel also has a yacht to go to the top of Huangshan Mountain. The pier is just outside the side door, and the air conditioner of the yacht is cold enough, so it is comfortable. Adults 300/person, buy tickets and book in advance at the hotel store; go up and down the cable car 50/person, you can buy tickets on the yacht. The world is "public" and it is beautiful, and there are ice cream 35/piece on the viewing platform.

4. Cafeteria: The set meal includes buffet for two people for two nights. The single price is 258/person. The salmon and chicken are delicious. I think the price is not bad overall.

5. Hotel service: good! In advance, the butler lady Jiawei asked her to help arrange to change the bath towels and bathrobes, and when I returned to the room, I saw that the minibar was also filled. The staff will take the initiative to say hello, and they will be very patient when they ask for directions inside and outside the hotel.

msg:Before the epidemic, I always liked to stay at the InterContinental Hotel. This stay directly lowered my influence on the InterContinental Hotel. The air conditioner in the room was very, very noisy unless it was turned off. The whole room had a musty smell. I arrived after 15:00 on the day of check-in, and said the room was ready, but there was only a pair of children's slippers when I entered. The other slippers were urged by my left and right phone calls. Is it because you can only get such a poor room type when you book an intercontinental special package through Ctrip? On the island tour booked through the hotel, the air conditioner was broken on the return journey, and the whole boat was too hot to take the boat back for 20 minutes. The hotel watched the sunset activities, arrived at the destination, the sun was still high, and the mosquitoes were attacked by high temperature. I will never go again in the future. I am so disappointed!

After arriving at the hotel, there will be waiters who will take the initiative to help with luggage. The problems encountered during check-in were solved immediately, and the room manager was efficient and polite. When we meet health aunts in the corridor, they will say hello to us. All three meals are ordered at the hotel's Chinese restaurant. The price is a bit high, but the dishes are good, especially the fish head soup is delicious, the braised pork is very delicious, and the dried bamboo shoots are also very fresh. The hotel swimming pool and the children's playground on the first floor are also very fun, the lake view room has a great view, and the natural oxygen bar! It is recommended to take the baby to lie flat in the summer vacation.

Before the trip, the hotel matched the butler Ruby, who asked about travel needs, estimated arrival time, room requirements, etc., and also provided the hotel's recent activities to facilitate advance reservations. During the stay, Sister Hong, who cleaned the room, was also very responsible. She greeted us every time we met, and carefully prepared drinks in the mini bar. Every night, she prepared room service, sleeping milk, etc. in advance. The layout of the parent-child room also fully meets the needs of children's families. The Ahri element satisfies the childlike innocence. It is very suitable for families who want to spend time in the hotel with their children. I feel very cordial, and I will choose it next time I travel

If I take a taxi from the high-speed rail station, it will cost nearly 200 yuan. I greeted the hotel in advance to help my friend celebrate my birthday, so InterContinental arranged for me in advance, upgraded the room, and prepared the cake for us. There are a lot of summer activities in the hotel, and of course there are a lot of people, but we didn‚Äôt have to wait for a long time when we checked in in line, and when we arrived at the hotel, it was already past 2 pm and we hadn‚Äôt had lunch yet, so the hotel staff speeded up the process In order to allow us to have lunch in the Chinese restaurant, the lunch in the Chinese restaurant is delicious, especially the braised pork is highly recommended, Dianping has a group purchase.

What touched me the most was that I came to my aunt early that day due to physical reasons, but I didn‚Äôt prepare sanitary napkins. After the hotel room staff, little sister Wang Yiwen learned about it, she immediately brought me her own. I am very grateful. She still refused to tell me her name. I only found out her name after asking the housekeeper. Here I still want to thank her. Thank you InterContinental for making me feel the real caring service.

I lie down in the hotel all the time, drink coffee and look at the lake view outside the window. It is very peaceful and relaxing. The hotel's Chinese restaurant, afternoon tea, buffet, Xianshan Restaurant, and Xianshan Restaurant one by one. I was pleasantly surprised by the small restaurant. The fried chicken in a wok is delicious. It would be even better if there were more choices to eat. June is a bit sultry, and I look forward to enjoying the beauty of nature again in autumn or spring.

This time I chose the InterContinental directly from the thousands of choices when I came to Qiandao Lake. The playground is very nice, like we brought three or four-year-old children very friendly, there is a playpen, the playground is also safe, and the scenery is very good, especially if I asked for a high floor, the front desk arranged for me the fifth floor. I am very satisfied with the room and there is a small room Butler Niu brought his parents-in-law with him, fearing that they might not understand something, and the steward Niu was also very enthusiastic, and could answer any questions he asked. It's just that the small train is under maintenance, so I can't sit on it. Call a few days in advance
When I was inquiring, there was a customer service attitude that was not very good, and there was no dinner buffet from Monday to Friday. Fortunately, there are two restaurants around the hotel, otherwise there is nothing to eat in the hotel if I am too lazy to go out. I feel like staying in a hotel is fine, there is no need to go out to the island, but the price of the chess and card room is a bit high, and there are no activities for children in the morning. If there are activities in the morning, it would be better if there are more activities for adults.

Thanks to the little butler, Eleven Liao, for the thoughtful gift prepared for the children when we checked in. When we wanted to pick it because it was raining, we couldn't make it, so we sent fresh red bayberries. Every night when we return to the room, the staff is ready for the sleeping mode. Here we enjoy the beautiful scenery and delicious food, and feel the relaxed moment of raising the baby. When we leave, there are exquisite souvenirs, leaving a souvenir.

The floor attendants are warm and friendly. The hotel also provides activities such as hiking, cycling, and boating, but it rained for two days and failed to make the trip. I took a walk on the mountain and by the lake by myself, very comfortable. The hotel's gym, yoga room, and indoor swimming pool hardware are also good, and the overall is quite suitable for a few days of soaking.

In time for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, there are many people, and the breakfast buffet is average. The fish head in the Chinese restaurant is very good, and the iron pot stew in the nearby Xian Xiaoguan is also recommended.

ps: There is a shuttle bus to and from the high-speed rail station, 140 by taxi.

Finally, I would like to thank the lobby manager, Manager Sun , On the day of check-out, the child accidentally twisted his arm and kept crying. We were all terrified. When we couldn‚Äôt get a taxi and all the hotel cars were out, we tried to find a way to help us find a car and drive as fast as possible. Send us to the hospital, fortunately there is no danger in the end, when the child is older, he will definitely get a second brush

See April events. Activities such as cycling and go-karting are oxygen-inhaling activities. The hotel also has a variety of climbing tours, moon gate check-in and sunset viewingüåÑ activities. There is someone to lead. The small train can also enjoy the beautiful scenery around the lake. The hotel has a packaged cruise ship to board the top of Huangshan Mountain and depart directly from the hotel to and fro. It is very convenient to wait for the boat without going to other islands or to the southeast. I feel that the Chinese restaurant is the best, and it is not much more expensive than the nearby farm dishes. Because the location is relatively unique, there are not many dining options around. I feel that afternoon tea and dining in the executive corridor at night are average. Probably there are some flies in the hot weather, I hope the hotel can still strengthen management in this regard. Although the bus encountered a little problem when it came, Manager Sun solved it in time. Compliments to the butler service here as well, who can answer right away on Wechat. Later, with the help of Manager Sun, this trip was even more perfect. InterContinental is not only a good resort hotel, but also a parent-child hotel that babies will be satisfied with. The lighthouse is very beautiful, and I feel that the parent-child paradise can be further strengthened.

msg:I have long heard people in the hotel circle say that the best resource in Qiandao Lake is InterContinental
Taking the elderly does not want to spend a day in the scenic area by boat to go to so many islands. There are intercontinental boats that go directly to the best point, the top of Huangshan Mountain. Because of the good location of the intercontinental, we were the first to go to the island in the morning, and there were few people in line. When we went down the mountain, the boats from the scenic spot and other hotels arrived, and they had to queue for at least half an hour to go up the mountain. Living in the intercontinental saves time and has a better experience.
Xianshan Peninsula is an intercontinental development, a veritable resort, with beautiful space to enjoy, and the fragrance of camphor.
The Chinese restaurant is good, and the signature fish head set meal on the review is great value. The two waiters for the 5.14 dinner were also very proactive and professional.
The only disadvantage is that there is a fast-moving goods sales team, and the quality of the personnel is not high, which affects the hotel environment

The hotel should have known that there were obvious problems with the room and should not have arranged for guests to check in before repairs were completed.

msg:Spring trip in March Although the weather in the mountains is not good, but the mood of thinking about the mountains and lakes is very urgent. On weekdays, it is very difficult to make appoin**ents with like-minded people and tell the truth... Okay! If you like to travel alone, you will be very happy~ My follow-up order will be matched with the little butler Diana Xiaodai, the little fairy, who really arranged it well. The content of the package is very well arranged. The specially selected lake view room has a great view, and girls love it Travel photography, afternoon tea, and girls‚Äô favorite photography will be arranged here one by one. It‚Äôs really fun to travel alone! I have been here in the past 19 years. I have been to Qiandao Lake many times, but my favorite is the environment of InterContinental Qiandao Lake. I like the feeling in all aspects... Although the journey is a bit far, the hotel is from The high-speed rail station üöÑ has a docking shuttle. There are two round trips every day. The pick-up is at 11:00 and 16:00, and the drop-off is at 11:00 and 14:30 (the fee is 25 yuan). The pick-up is also the hotel's own car. The master is also very nice, very polite and kind You are welcome... The whole point of this hotel is that the staff are well trained. This is the charm of the brand! There is no way to fight for the strength of the homestay, it all needs financial resources... The hotel also has a docking boat to the top of Huangshan Mountain twice a day, which is also very good, it is convenient for everyone to travel, the best thing to do when you come to Hudao is to take a deep breath in the morning Negative ion air is priceless! Finally, I would like to thank the little housekeeper, Xiao Dai, who is young but has a high EQ. I wish Xiao Dai all the best in his work! (I will come back next time if I have a chance, and I will find you as a housekeeper) Hee hee üòòüòòüòò

msg:This is my third time coming to Qiandao Lake. I wanted a quiet and leisurely weekend, so I chose the Intercontinental this time. The Intercontinental of Qiandao Lake is located on the Xianshan Peninsula. It has the feeling of being isolated from the world (but it is far away from the city. About 30 minutes drive). The room was chosen as a classic deluxe view room. The room was large, with a nice balcony and a good view. The butler Melody provided very attentive service throughout the entire process, from the early activity introduction to the various reservation services in the middle, I was very satisfied! To sum up, I will come again~ I also recommend everyone to choose InterContinental Qiandao Lake Resort~

It would be great to come and relax for a few days and walk around the hotel, but the decoration is a bit old. We came here on Thursday, there were not too many guests in the hotel, and the breakfast and service were acceptable. On Saturday breakfast, it felt that there were obviously more guests, and the service order in the restaurant was a bit chaotic.
It is worth mentioning that the free local chicken pot from Xian Xiaoguan served by the hotel tastes good. Personally, it tastes better than Xianshan Restaurant. There is nothing to eat around the hotel. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel tastes average.
This InterContinental has a general awareness of active service. When we checked in, only one staff member was handling it, and the other two stood there not knowing what to say. After we lined up at the back for a while, we asked those two people if they could handle it. He hesitated for a while before handling it for us. In addition, the waiters in the hotel felt that they were not very friendly, but the uncle in the parking lot was very nice and would take the initiative to say hello to us every time.

The housekeeper Mia added WeChat in time after she was busy, and the communication was smooth. Since this trip was to celebrate her mother's birthday, Mia specially arranged a birthday cake and a handwritten blessing card after knowing the situation, as well as the signatures of everyone in the front office. It was a bit hard, but it's a pity I was in a hurry to check out and forgot to take it awayüò≠If you have any questions during the whole process, you can ask the beautiful butler, she is very considerate, I hereby give you a good review, and look forward to meeting with friends again next timeüò¨

After waiting for a month, I finally waited for a sunny weekend. Hurry up Qiandao Lake!

Location traffic:
The location is relatively remote. It takes about 40 to 50 minutes to drive from the center. If you don‚Äôt drive by yourself, it‚Äôs not very convenient to travel. However, we don‚Äôt go to scenic spots on this trip, we only go to hotels, so it doesn‚Äôt matter

Room view:
The lake view room has nothing to say. You can sit on the balcony and watch the sunset. It‚Äôs beautiful. Of course, there are places where you can watch the sunset everywhere in the hotel~
The environment of the hotel is also very good. Although the interior is relatively old style, the exterior scenery is quite attentive. Spring is still very beautiful, but the hotel is not as big as imagined, and you can take a walk around soon~

breakfast:
The breakfast variety is okay, and the taste is okay. There are quite a lot of people dining during peak hours

swimming pool:
The outdoor swimming pool is currently closed~

Slots:
Check-in is too slow. I arrived after 1:00 on Saturday. I said the room was out, but I didn't enter the room until 3:30. The welcome fruit was rough. In terms of hygiene, there is no problem at all, but there is a box of white rice in the refrigerator. I'm a little lost~

The hotel is very suitable for parent-child travel. There are children's playgrounds and various activities. Of course, the two of us who were lying flat didn't go there, so we took a walk on the trail.
Because the takeaway is inconvenient, we ate at the hotel restaurant. We ate the buffet and the Chinese restaurant in the hotel restaurant. I personally think it is not bad. The fish head soup has more bamboo fungus and mushrooms than outside, and it is still very fresh.
Finally, I would like to thank my little housekeeper, Diana, who contacted me one day in advance to confirm the check-in time and reserved the room.

Although the nearby luxury hotels are also facing the lake, the surrounding environment is far inferior to the InterContinental. They are basically in the downtown area. It is so beautiful to enter the ten-kilometer landscape avenue of the InterContinental Hotel! The value of a hotel should not only be based on the guest rooms, but also on its public facilities. The InterContinental's gardens and viewing platforms are superb. This is the biggest feeling of this stay. The service is nothing to say, the front desk, doorman, restaurant, and cleaning are all in place. Especially commendable is the InterContinental butler - Li Tingshuo from the concierge depar**ent, who is proficient in business and clearly introduces all aspects of the hotel, allowing guests to quickly get into the mood, such as booking cruises, restaurant breakfasts, fitness venues, the best location for shooting, etc. Its quality service left a deep impression on me.

We were very happy, and our parents also lived very comfortably. The children's playground is quite big, and it's easy to walk the baby, hahahaha

msg:I am very happy to have chosen Qiandao Lake InterContinental as the resort hotel for three days and two nights. I was even more fortunate to meet the butler Mavericks. The little girl is sweet and kind. From the upgrade of the room type before check-in to the gifts when I leave the hotel, it is really true. It makes us feel at home, and we will give timely feedback and solutions to our needs. This kind of meticulous care keeps us in a good mood all the time. The scenery of the hotel is very beautiful. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake without leaving home. The boat trip at the tip of Huangshan Mountain is very suitable for lazy people. In general, this trip has left very good memories. I will recommend Qiandao Lake to my friends next time Lake Intercontinental and Maverick Butler.

Thanks to the housekeeper Ms. Niu Jing for upgrading the room type with a large balcony, which has a wide view. During the stay, they are always caring, answering all questions and providing convenience. It's a place where you can come and "lie down" for a few days when you want to

Day1 check-in, my baby takes online classes in the room, my husband and I walked around the hotel
I didn‚Äôt want to queue for the Chinese restaurant at night, so I ate at the hotel‚Äôs western restaurant. I didn‚Äôt expect the taste to be very good and the service was also very good.
Take a break, go swimming in the pool at night, and then go back to the room to take a bath
Day 2 breakfast buffet. You can tell the lady that the coffee you want will be ready and delivered. I ordered Mocha, which is very good.
Go around by bicycle and take pictures at the lighthouse
In the afternoon, the hotel makes an appoin**ent to visit the island, take a boat, take the cableway, and enjoy the scenery. It takes two hours to go back and forth, not tired and very leisurely.
The dinner was eaten at Xianshan Restaurant next to the hotel. It was delicious üòã

Services: Room cleaning, swimming pool, bicycles, restaurant staff are very polite
In the lobby, I took a look at the signboard for afternoon tea, and the lady immediately came to ask if I needed anything. At breakfast, I took a look at the drink list on the table, and immediately asked if I needed coffee.
The swimming pool closes at 10:30 and reminded my son to get off work at 9:30, and the staff immediately said it‚Äôs okay, there‚Äôs still a while to play üòÑ

very pleasant trip

1. The shuttle bus between the hotel and the train station is very convenient, and you can choose the appropriate time according to the time period.
2. The Internet celebrity attraction Moon Gate at the entrance of the hotel has a free photographer every morning.
3. The lake view room has a very good view.
4. Those with babies can take the Xianshan train. The children's playground is very big, suitable for all ages! Older kids can play pottery, go-karts, hike and bike around the lake!
5. If you don't want to be too tired, you can take part in the hotel's yacht tour to the island. You only go to one scenic spot at the top of Huangshan Mountain. You can choose the cable car up and down. It takes two hours to go back and forth effortlessly.
6. The price-performance ratio of the hotel's Chinese food, Western food and Japanese food shop is slightly lower, and there are only Xianshan Restaurant and Xian Xiaoguan nearby. Dining options are not strong.
7. Henry, the concierge manager, is very nice. Whether it is an appoin**ent for a project or seeking help, he can arrange it properly at the first time. Like it!

msg:The experience of staying at the Qiandao Lake InterContinental this time was really bad. Since I decided to check in at short notice, I booked a room on Ctrip when I arrived at the hotel at 6pm. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that the information had not been entered into the system and I had to wait. During the period, I asked a second time and said Yes, there may be a delay. When I asked for the third time, I was told that it had not been entered into the system yet. Another staff member next to me told me that it had been entered into the system. It was only at this time that I checked in. After putting down our luggage, we had to check in early the next morning. I wanted to go somewhere else, so I decided to visit the night market in Qiandao Lake in the evening, so I drove out to have dinner and stroll around the night view. During this period, the hotel front desk called and informed me that there were two gifts available for collection. We wanted to wait until we returned to the hotel around 10 o'clock. When I picked up the gifts, I was told that the time for picking up the gifts had passed and that we could only pick them up after 9 a.m. tomorrow. We had to leave early in the morning. After coordination, we picked up one of the gifts. We had breakfast at 7:30 a.m. the next day. Then left the hotel. Near noon, a hotel salesperson called me to ask if I was satisfied with my stay. Since I was driving, I simply expressed my dissatisfaction, and the salesperson said they would contact me later. After that, the hotel‚Äôs after-sales service never contacted me again, as if I had just asked and the problem would be solved. The hotel's overall service awareness is really poor. Many staff feel very inexperienced. They deal with problems passively and have no sense of service. They are not like a 5-star hotel at all. I am really disappointed. No matter how beautiful the view from this hotel is, it is off-putting.

I have always struggled with the location of InterContinental, which is a bit far from the city. But this time I made the right choice. I only stayed for two nights, and I still want to stay here. My personal butler, dinana, helped me upgrade the lake view parent-child room for free. The view is absolutely amazing! The environment around the hotel can be described as green and shady, there are many types of plants, the environment is quite good, and the air is very fresh. The housekeeper, dinana, is kind and kind, and answered every question. She took the initiative to help me solve many problems. She was also very kind to the children, and even gave them gifts.
As far as the disadvantage of the hotel is concerned, there are too few restaurants nearby. There is only one Internet celebrity Xianshan Restaurant and one Xian Xiaodian with little business. In addition, the hot water in the women's bathroom at the swimming pool has to be turned on for several minutes to heat up, and it is a bit wasteful to keep spraying cold water from the shower head.
Also, on the first night, because we didn‚Äôt see the closing time of the Children‚Äôs Paradise, we went in at 6:50 after dinner. My husband asked the waiter in the Children‚Äôs Paradise whether he should take off his shoes if he wears shoe covers. He asked twice, but the waiter didn‚Äôt Answer, when we passed the service bar, the waiter came and said that the door was closed at 7 o'clock, and finally knew why she didn't answer, because it affected her off work, so we played for 5 minutes and left. This is the most hard-core waiter I have encountered at InterContinental.

msg:Bad trip!
Checked in on August 9th (2-night order), and found that the bathroom was smelly after checking in in the afternoon (judging from the common sense of life, it should be the smell caused by the previous bathroom not being cleaned well). So I called the front desk to let the bathroom be cleaned. After dinner, I went back to my room to rest, but the bathroom was still full of fumes. Call the front desk to ask for a room change, and the front desk will give feedback to the leader. Considering that it was already late, the room was probably full, and the family of three just slept through the night like this!
The next morning, I was so angry that I called InterContinental 400-830-2766 to complain. The hotel front desk called back within an hour and I agreed to change the room. I will change when there is a clean similar room. When there was no movement at 1:30 p.m., I called the front desk, waited online and waited for the front desk to complete the internal communication and give me feedback. There was a room. I had to wait for them to complete the internal rounds and they would call me to change the room. The front desk called me around 2 p.m. You can change rooms.
The above is the whole process of this terrible trip. The location of the Qiandao Lake InterContinental Hotel is indeed very good, and it coincides with the summer peak, but the cleaning of the bathroom is the most basic service. It is really unreasonable to make such an extremely low-level mistake. ! In addition, during the whole process, apart from the girl at the front desk saying sorry, the hotel did not apologize at all!
This trip to the InterContinental Qiandao Lake really stinks!

msg:There are many choices of hotels in Qiandao Lake, and I chose the InterContinental Qiandao Lake Hotel to stay.
The hotel has a beautiful environment. It is located on the Xianshan Peninsula, a hilltop of Dushan, a little distance from the center of the earliest developed area of Qiandao Lake. Away from the noisy tourist environment, you have to drive a few kilometers of internal roads to enter the hotel. There are no other hotels around the lake along the way, so the environment is very quiet. The hotel has all kinds of facilities, and you can spend a day in the hotel. The hotel has swimming, fitness and spa, and various activities. There are scenic spots in the back mountain where you can hike or borrow bicycles to go around the island. There are also Internet celebrity lighthouses and so on. Spend another day to visit the surrounding islands, the hotel has a boat üö¢ to take you to the top of Huangshan Mountain. In fact, sitting in the room and staring at the window is also quite good! The executive lake-view room faces the lake with pleasant scenery. The afternoon tea and happy hour meals in the evening are delicious. Room service is also available 24 hours.
It's a pity that the past few days were cloudy and the sun didn't come out, and I didn't see the sunset. Comfort yourself that cloudy days also have a different kind of beauty! The hazy landscape is more like ink painting, isn't it?
If you like a quiet hotel environment, there are not many people! InterContinental Qiandao Lake can be considered, stay away from the city and relax!

The housekeeper, Chen Lean, was very enthusiastic. He contacted me one day in advance to help change the parent-child room, and recommended nearby attractions. Before leaving, he thoughtfully gave the children many small gifts.
There are also more parent-child activities in the hotel, but the price of the small train is slightly more expensive.

As soon as you leave the Qingxi Toll Station, turn left and you will enter the winding mountain road dedicated to the hotel. Follow the road signs and circle all the way to reach the beautiful lakeside hotel.
When I checked in at the front desk, I learned that I was an InterContinental member, and offered to upgrade me to a parent-child room with a lake view. The scenery is so beautiful that it is really worth it!
There are many activities included in the room for one night. Children can enter and exit the Intercontinental Park for free and unlimited times. There are children's courses that can be reserved every afternoon. There are also outdoor children's playgrounds, orchards and small trains that can be visited. The small train circles the hotel.

After checking in, I took the initiative to add me on WeChat, and helped me make reservations for various activities and restaurant seats in a timely manner throughout the whole process, and even asked my assistant to lead us to the hotel restaurant for dinner. As long as you have any needs, you can contact the little housekeeper. Our hotel has a lot of activities throughout the day. The itinerary is full and there are many activities. The children are very happy.
In addition to the considerate service of the housekeeper, the restaurant waiters, pool waiters, and room service waiters are all very enthusiastic. They take the initiative to ask us in the morning and help us solve problems as soon as possible. Three days and two nights are really not enough for us.
As a parent-child room, the most commendable thing is the disinfection cabinet in the picture, which is definitely a safe experience for young babies to go out. In summer, we will have the opportunity to experience the outdoor infinity pool, climb the mountain to the top of Lotus Peak, and experience more exciting things.

msg:It was a pleasant surprise to choose to live in the Qiandao Lake Intercontinental this time. It feels like a resort with a very good environment!
The hotel is located on the Xianshan Peninsula, and it is very convenient to drive from the entrance and exit of the expressway. The hotel occupies a large area, and has developed a mountain along the lake. The garden is exquisite. There are several viewing platforms that are within walking distance outside the hotel. You can hike and climb the mountain to see the lake. There are also many items for children to play, such as indoor and outdoor swimming pools, outdoor playgrounds, indoor handicraft workshops, etc.
The breakfast is also very rich, there are several bright stalls, and there are a lot of bread, snacks and meat. There are both Chinese and Western food for dinner, and the Western food, pizza and burgers are all well done.
InterContinental's service is worthy of a five-star standard. Daniel, the housekeeper, contacted the check-in one day in advance, and the waiters he met were also very friendly.
I will choose to come to Qiandao Lake Intercontinental for vacation in the future!

The whole hotel covers half of the island, where you can see the most beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake. But as a five-star hotel, the service is really poor. Specifically: 1. The room I stayed in this time has a balcony. After entering the room, I found that the balcony door was broken. I called the front desk three times before someone came to repair it; 2. I was on duty The manager arranged for a free afternoon tea in order to express his apology, but he asked the specific service personnel and told us that we were not eligible to enjoy the afternoon tea, which shows that there is a big problem in the internal communication of the hotel; I went to the room to rest, and when I fell asleep at 9:00, the hotel staff called the room to ask if the hand card was returned, regardless of whether the guest had already rested. However, in view of the above, the hotel manager on duty also expressed his apology sincerely, and presented afternoon tea, red wine and nuts. I hope the hotel will not waste such a good hardware condition, and improve the service quality a lot...

I let the Ctrip platform coordinate all the communication (I give a big praise to the Ctrip platform here, and attach great importance to customers.

    The room is very large, with the width first. The bed and bathtub face the floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking the scenery outside the window at any time.
    The biggest feature of the hotel is that it is located in the Qiandao Lake Resort. If foreign tourists from the province do not have time to participate in the three-day inspection and cannot go to the scenic spot, it is worth coming here. The scenery is panoramic, the resort is prosperous, and there are many beneficial facilities. I bought a bicycle, took part in a hike, and watched the sunset of Qiandao Lake.
    If there is a shortage, the hotel is far away from the city, you can‚Äôt get takeaways, and there are no convenience stores nearby. Meals can only be settled in the hotel and the two farmhouses in the resort. The food taste of the hotel needs to be improved.

Although it was finally adjusted to the desired room type, during the communication process, I just ignored everything I asked. When asked how long it will take for the adjusted room type to be available, the answer is I don't know. Asking about Chinese restaurants, hotel activities, are all indifferent words, which do not match the administrative trea**ent. As a result, I waited for more than an hour for the room to be available, and I went to the front desk to ask for a second room. I said that the room was ready and I called and did not fulfill the contract. But the attitude of the lady who served at the front desk for the second time was much better. According to common sense, the hotel should upgrade the room for free instead of making customers wait so long. There is no administrative service in the whole process, which is far from the intercontinental standard. Aside from the bad service experience, the hotel environment, facilities, and meals are all good. After the incident, the hotel also gave an apology feedback and refunded the difference of more than 300 yuan in the executive lounge, which is worthy of recognition. However, as a top brand, corporate risk internal control and employee education should be strengthened. Don't ruin the whole pot of porridge because of one or two mouse droppings, and ruin the hard-won goodwill.

It may be that many people cannot go out of Shanghai due to the epidemic, so the hotel feels that there are not as many people staying in the hotel as I imagined! Unexpectedly, the housekeeper Aqian added WeChat before check-in and provided a lot of hotel tour consultation. Because it was earlier than the normal check-in time, Aqian also thoughtfully helped us arrange the room in advance, and you can check in when you come! The hotel is in Xianshan. There are many attractions and check-in items when you go out, such as go-karting, hiking, water sports, etc. It feels especially suitable for family-child travel. , but the misty clouds are also another kind of scenery! When checking out, A Qian also gave a souvenir and helped to check out late. I felt that this trip was really relaxing and very comfortable! Hope to experience it again next time in summer

I ordered a big bed room with a view and arrived at 12:00 noon. The front desk told me to upgrade to a lake view room, but the room had not been cleaned, so I had lunch in the hotel Chinese restaurant first. The food in the Chinese restaurant was still good. Little babies can make less salt, and they eat both lunches here, with a 15% service charge.

After lunch, I took the baby to Ari Paradise. The 2-year-old baby is very playable. It is divided according to the age of the baby, and the parent-child activities are also here.

Around 3:00, the front desk called and said that we could check in. The lake view room on the 6th floor has a great view. The room is also very clean, and there is a fruit plate as a gift.

The breakfast is also very rich, the stalls have noodles, wonton and egg cakes, as well as baby meals. Checked in on a Monday and it was almost full at breakfast time.

üå§ The infinity pool is beautiful at sunset, and InterContinental Qiandao Lake is worth staying in from all aspects.

After all, 2022 is not easy, and at the beginning of the year, it was sealed and charged and lost the "bright spring",
After resuming work, I recovered lost time and continued to work overtime;

There is a direct high-speed train from Shanghai, which is a 2-hour drive.

msg:I stayed with my children for 3 nights, the slow pace of the parent-child tour, and I was generally satisfied.
Advantages: 1. The hotel called the day before check-in. Afterwards, the housekeeper ruby added WeChat, and communicated at any time with any questions. The reply was very timely and the communication was smooth. This service is still good. During the stay, a big thank you to the housekeeper ruby.
2. The environment is good. The hotel is on Xianshan Island, even though we stayed in the hotel for 4 days, we didn't get bored.
3. The parent-child travel experience is good. In the room, we booked a parent-child room, and after arriving at the store, we upgraded to a parent-child room with lake view. The room has a good view, with a small tent and a small dinosaur mount, a large bed and a tatami mat. Although the room is relatively old, I am generally satisfied with the room; The children's playground is free, we are 22 months old, enough to play; the hotel small train departs once every half an hour, 20m circle; climb to the top of Mount Huangshan, sign up one day in advance, arrive 20m, go up and down the cable car, which is convenient for taking children; the indoor swimming pool has a heated pool , the water temperature is 38 degrees, and the depth is 0.8m. It is still very good for children to play.
4. Catering: Except for one meal at the Xianshan Hotel, after that, it was settled in the hotel Chinese restaurant and Western restaurant (dinner buffet), and there was almost no thunder.
Disadvantages: 1. In terms of catering, there is only baby meal for breakfast, but no baby meal is found in lunch and dinner. Since it is mainly a parent-child hotel, it is recommended to introduce baby meals in Chinese restaurants and western restaurants. Although you can tell the waiter to make clear soup noodles and the like, we hope to give guests more choices. (Envy the gnocchi in the restaurant, there is no menu, it is very suitable for babies over 1 year old)
2. The room is a little old, but there is room for improvement in hygiene in some places, such as the mirrors and lights in the bathroom are dusty.
3. The service awareness of some waiters needs to be improved. For example, restaurant waiters should at least be worthy of the 15% service fee in Chinese restaurants. The service is not proactive and the attitude is average (not enthusiastic at all, and compared with the aunt who is doing hygiene, the gap is very large), there are many trainee waiters, and I still feel very young. , the service ability is also very general, and the experience is not very good.
4. Nucleic acid detection is not very convenient. Our check-in period was 8:30-9:30, and we didn‚Äôt tell you when we checked in. If we missed the test time, we had to go to the county hospital, which was very inconvenient.
5. More parent-child activities are recommended.

Overall, this parent-child tour is still very satisfactory, and the children had a great time. Thanks again for the housekeeper ruby, will go again next time.

msg:In the summer vacation, I like to take my baby to visit five-star hotels. I heard that InterContinental Qiandao is a parent-child hotel that can be as famous as Senbo in Moganshan. !
Let's talk about the advantages first, the scenery is invincible, look at the picture 1, the sunset is amazing, healing ~ the staff Li Tingshuo is very good üëç Our three family of seven people, we trouble Xiao Li every day, and get Xiao Li's butler-style caring service!
The hotel's catering, breakfast, Chinese food, afternoon tea in the lobby bar, and the Xianxiaoguan Xianshan Hotel in the periphery are all very good! The more expensive ones belong to the hotel Chinese restaurant, but the value is great. If you want to be more affordable, Xianshan Hotel and Xian Xiaoguan are both good.
I booked a lake view room for two days first. When I renewed it on the third day, because I was with my friends, I directly renewed three rooms of the same room type. The difference between the two room types is more than 1,000. !
Since I stayed for three nights and stayed in a hotel, I basically had a chance to play all the projects. You can go to the island by boat and surf the Web. You can try it!
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: the breakfast on the first day was really bad and made people feel bad. I took two babies alone, the older baby is 13 years old and the younger baby is 6 years old. The room with two breakfasts still insists on charging my baby half price, saying that the older baby is one. Adult, my little baby is over 1.2cm, I'm a little angry, the parent-child hotel is not very a**ospheric, staring at the baby and speculating whether it is 1.19 or 1.21 speechless The half-price children's breakfast of dozens of yuan, my husband is free to travel with us, our two small hotels are not chasing the price of children's breakfast, maybe I like and choose are of high quality, and the corresponding services are also Very goodüëç I dare to say that I dare to accept bad reviews. Sometimes I really shouldn't be used to it. . . This matter has been solved perfectly by the on-duty manager Wei. I hope that the parent-child hotel and customers will not be so fussy about it, and be tolerant and generous without losing everyone's demeanor! The next day for dinner, I was stopped for the same problem. I said to its staff, please understand that what happened yesterday has been resolved. Thank you. Breakfast on the third day, good luck!
4 points, 1 point is not deducted from the breakfast, I want to complain to the fat female employee of the swimming pool canteen who works on the 22nd and 23rd. The swimming ring is rented for 30 yuan per time, so I bought one for 80 yuan. My daughter chose a crown Swimming ring, on the 22nd, we played in the outdoor pool until 22:00 in the evening. We were so tired that we forgot to bring the swimming ring back to the room, thinking that it would be fine. The quality of this hotel's guests is very high. Who will take ours will only be taken by the staff. I took it. I went to ask the little brother at work the next day. They said that the canteen was taken away. They told me to pick it up. I went. I didn't see the crown swimming ring, so I could only ask her if she had any solution, give us a normal version of the swimming ring for the baby to play with first, she actually reluctantly said that we must return the game that day, in fact, our crown It was rented out by her that day. After we found the swimming pool, I went to ask others. They rented it for 30 yuan. On the same day, Crown also sublet two others. My daughter has been crying aggrieved! Later, I didn't return the swimming ring, I threw it back, and I was really angry üò° Even if you think we don't want it and sublet it out, our master must at least say hello when he finds it?

msg:The entire hotel can still meet expectations, as a parent-child hotel, at least it will not step on the pit. The hotel is very big and the environment is good. When you take a slow life on vacation, you can stay for a few more days. What is remarkable is that the design of the hotel is very reasonable. It is very convenient to swim and eat in the whole resort. The facilities of the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are also perfect, and the staff can help solve the problem. If there is anything that needs to be improved, it is to make the signs more clearly. When I first went there, I looked for indoor swimming pools everywhere, but I couldn't find them for a long time, and then I was familiar with the road. In addition to eating in the hotel, there is only one Xianshan restaurant nearby. If you have three meals a day, I feel that the cost-effectiveness of eating in the hotel is not very high, but the environment is still good.

msg:I went on a trip with friends and children and chose the Intercontinental Hotel, and the children were quite satisfied. The environment is beautiful and a**ospheric. The most important thing is that you can enjoy the beautiful scenery without leaving the hotel in the hot summer. Children can play in the playground and watch their favorite cartoons. The most important thing is that there is a superb infinity pool. . Children soak in the pool every day. There is also a cafeteria. The quality of the restaurant is very good. I don‚Äôt want to go out to eat every day. It can satisfy my brother who is picky eater. My sister also gave a very good review of the restaurant. Not only is there a wide variety, but most importantly, it tastes delicious üòã. In the evening, you can also take a walk on the mountain path, watch the sunset, the lighthouse in the lake, the green mountains in the distance... This trip left a deep impression on the children, and I will definitely choose Intercontinental next time! Interlude: The younger brother accidentally kicked the toe nail, and the hotel manager Henry quickly brought the medicine kit to deal with. In order to comfort his younger brother, he also brought him toys warmly.

msg:This summer has been a series of high-temperature days. Due to the repeated epidemics, it is more difficult for Shanghai people to travel. Before the trip, a friend recommended the InterContinental Hotel, and I didn't have time to do my homework. I traveled with a little bit of anxiety; I encountered double inspections when I came off the highway. In the communication with the hotel's duty manager Herry Sun, he actively coordinated Although it took an extra hour to stay at the expressway, we finally arrived at the InterContinental Hotel; Herry kindly helped us upgrade to a lake view room and a 2-hour late check-out, and felt the proper humanized service of a five-star hotel.
Because of the heat, I traveled for three days and two nights and did not leave the hotel; I soaked in the swimming pool every day, played with my children happily, and participated in the free check-in activity of mermaid swimsuits in the swimming pool, the children were very happy; the pottery bar 1.5 hours from drawing to The painting activity liberates parents to relax for a moment: the hotel has its own boat dock, and it takes 2 hours to go back and forth by boat and take the cable car to the top of Mount Huangshan to enjoy the natural beauty of the world, which is the "public" natural beauty, without having to go to the dock outside. The whole trip came and went in a hurry, but the service of InterContinental Hotel is satisfactory, see you next time!

msg:Due to the outbreak of the epidemic in Sanya, I had to temporarily change the travel destination. I have always heard that the Intercontinental Hotel Qiandao Lake is very good. I think it has a peninsula by itself. For me who don‚Äôt want to rush to the attractions, I can take my children to bubble in the hotel and have a leisure time. Right in the middle.

From Qiandao Lake high-speed railway station, it takes about 40 minutes to take a taxi to the hotel. The whole journey is high-speed and provincial road. After entering Wanxiang Road, there is a 10-kilometer Huanhu Road. On one side is the open waters of Qiandao Lake. I am in a good mood.

This time we stayed for two nights and enjoyed three restaurants. The buffet breakfast and dinner were quite satisfactory. The breakfast waiter brought a seat very quickly. We came to eat during the rush hour in the morning, and there was basically no need to wait for a table. The Japanese restaurant has a good view. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows is Qiandao Lake and the undulating mountains. We choose a la carte eel rice and beef rice bowl. The taste is good and the price is within a reasonable range.

Children love the two outdoor swimming pools. They have a hard time playing every morning and evening. The scorching sun, blue sky and white clouds, and the blue wave loungers in the swimming pool really have the taste of the sea. In addition to the facilities for small children, Intercontinental Children's Park also has table tennis, billiards and shooting machines suitable for our older children. It is not a problem to kill an hour.

My favorite is the daily 5 pm hiking activity arranged by InterContinental. You can climb the mountain along the road around the lake, go to the lake to look at the lighthouse, and then enjoy the sunset to satisfy your vacation wishes.

The hotel room is quite satisfactory, the bathroom has a shower and a bathtub, and there is a drying rack on the balcony. The clothes dried at night are dried in the morning.

What confuses me more is the customer service center satisfaction survey. Just half a day after I checked into the hotel, I received two customer service calls to investigate whether I was satisfied. I received a third call the next morning. Although I gave a good review, there is no need to mark people like this. I don't know if the management has set any KPI, and the workers have their own helplessness.

The only episode of this stay is the drilling construction in the lobby of the hotel at 12 o'clock at night. The noise in the room is very obvious, which causes the elderly to not rest well. The operation of the night construction is very incomprehensible. The guest room and switchboard are unanswered, and most of the night I have to go to the lobby to respond to the situation, which is not in line with the services of luxury hotels. Other than that, all good.

1. The environment is very beautiful, and you don't need to leave the hotel to take pictures of the beautiful scenery.
2. There are many activities for children, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and indoor heated swimming pools for children, which are highly praised. There are small train rides, playgrounds, screening halls, etc., as well as various small classroom activities during the summer vacation.
3. The overall service attitude is good, responsive to requests, although there are many people in the summer vacation, the details are also well done.
shortcoming:
1. It is said that the hotel bubble machine has been broken for a long time, and the bubble party that the children were looking forward to has not been played. When there are many children, the organization of activities is a bit confusing.
2. The room is relatively old and the sound insulation is slightly poor. The TV can't be turned on. After I came here twice, I gave up and stopped watching.
3. It is far from the urban area, so there are only hotels and Xianshan Hotel at the entrance to choose from.
Overall, it is very suitable for lying flat and sliding, recommended~

The love for InterContinental stems from this place. When you come to Qiandao Lake, it is also the first choice to recommend InterContinental. In the past, the habit of visiting once a year was interrupted by the epidemic. Looking at the lake view on the sofa in the room, drinking coffee in a daze, I don't want to go home every time. I arrived at the hotel late this time. I was worried that some of my needs could not be met, but the worry was completely unnecessary. The hotel staff did their best to help me solve it. Special thanks to CC, JOEY, and Xiao Xiang for giving me Lots of help during this stay. On the way home, I was thinking about doing it again this winter.

It is much worse, whether it is the environment, facilities, service, taste, there is a certain gap. First of all, when entering the hotel, there is a musty smell in the public area. Secondly, there are some problems with the business philosophy of the hotel. It is too economical. If you come to vacation, you will spend money to enjoy it. Too much saving in the hotel will inevitably affect the customer experience. For example, many public areas do not have air conditioning, the room is air-conditioned, and the balcony door cannot be opened. Third, the buffet is not rich enough, there are few things, and the price is not worth it. The buffet of more than 300 yuan is not as rich and delicious as the buffet at Lishui Oriental Wenting 129. Overall, the feeling is not worth the price, only the experience of a comfortable hotel.

And the toilet is also not good. My son went to the toilet once, but he flushed it twice and it still couldn't be flushed. . In the end, I could only let Ctrip coordinate to check out early, which is a very poor check-in experience.
Hygiene: The toilet is not easy to use
Hardware: not worthy of a room of 3,600 yuan a night

msg:I suspect that the good reviews are all brushed. Staying in many hotels and giving bad reviews for the first time
Service: The cleaning sent a plate of fruit and asked me to give a good review, I said yes. She actually stayed in the room and refused to leave. I had to take out my phone and give her a good review. She asked for a screenshot. I was really shocked. !" She didn't leave until I got angry and asked me to leave the store. I must give a good review. I seriously doubt that InterContinental has the suspicion of brushing good reviews on Ctrip. Being bullied by the hotel staff like this, the room fee of nearly 4000 per night made me feel like I ate a dogüí©. Although the room manager came to apologize, I was no longer in the mood for a good holiday. I left the hotel early the next morning. I don't want to say more about other services, which are the worst among the five stars.

When we checked in, we saw a lot of tourist buses, all with groups. Check in at 3pm and check out at 12pm. It was not until 3:40 that the notice was ready to move in. Booked a parent-child family room, three children, three breakfasts. Went for breakfast in the morning and asked us to add a breakfast fee. It is said that a child is also a person. We say that children under 1.2 meters are free. What money do you want. The staff saw that we knew it was confiscated. If we don't know, have you been tricked into paying for a breakfast? I go to your hotel every year. First time encountering this kind of thing. Is it because the epidemic is not working well? Feeling a little bad this time.

üçÉ Environment: ‚¨áÔ∏è
üîîService: There is nothing to say, the natural oxygen bar, the room cleaning service is timely and accurate, because there is a baby, two bottles of water are delivered in the middle of the night, and the cleaning lady ran twice. All the staff answered questions and doubts in a timely manner. They knew that they were bringing a baby when they checked in, and they assisted with check-in in advance. The differentiated service was great!
The downside is that when checking in, 50 people surround three staff members, and the diversion of personnel is not enough.
, there will be no check in congestion problem.


breakfast:
The overall is quite satisfactory, no fault
The shortcoming is the lack of supplementary meals. We did not go there on holidays. As a result, there were large areas of empty dishes for two consecutive days, and the most basic vegetables had to wait for a long time to be replenished. Yuan's buffet will not be like this...... It can't match the level of hotel dining at this level.

Thank you, Ctrip's exclusive little housekeeper, Yuanyuan, for arranging a room with a lake view, so I don't want to go out at all, I just want to lie on the balcony in a daze! It is indeed the most popular parent-child hotel in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Children are not bored at all in the hotel. They refuse to leave every day in the Intercontinental Park, and the bumper trains have to ride every day! On Father's Day, I arranged the hotel pottery for the father and son, and made a souvenir to leave memories of the two of them! The hotel's buffet breakfast is of higher quality than buffet dinner, with more choices and more in line with my appetite! When the waiter sees the children, they will also serve a baby meal attentively, which is very nice! Although there are not many choices for the dishes in the Chinese restaurant, the taste is good! In short, before the children left, they shouted that they would bring their grandparents with them next time.

msg:The location of the hotel is relatively remote. It is more like a secluded place in the peninsula that turns back from the exit of Qingxi Expressway. The entire park is relatively large, and there is enough leisure and play in the hotel (do not visit the attractions in the city). Near the summer house prices are high, the overall service is not bad. 1. The parent-child room is very good. The 2m master bedroom in the room and the 1.8m floor-to-ceiling window tatami are very suitable for bringing young babies. Adults sleep outside without worrying about the baby falling off the bed. 2, the buffet is generally OK. The food is 5 star standard. There are two local food restaurants outside the surrounding hotels, or drive to the farmhouse 5 kilometers away, where there are many local food restaurants. 3. There will be bubble pool activities next to the pool in the afternoon. There are pottery museums, small train tours, and bayberry picking in the hotel, which are suitable for children to participate in. The indoor children&#39;s park feels that it lacks some operable play items, the climbing frame is not bad, and the others are average, and the level of feeling needs to be improved. 4, the sound insulation is not very good. Please consider carefully if you are looking for soundproofing. 5. The garden vegetation along the lakeside is very neatly arranged, suitable for taking pictures and walking. Guess I have done insecticide protection, this time I was basically not bitten by mosquitoes, I like it. 6. Betty, the reception staff at the front desk, is very good. He is careful, patient and enthusiastic in his approach, and introduces the hotel&#39;s infrastructure and housing-related matters one by one.

There are many items suitable for babies to play in the holy place. This time, I specially brought my baby to play in the water. The hotel&#39;s infinity pool is very good.

This time I made light clay, a little chef, and a hand-painted kite. The projects are all good, but the little chef's time is very cramped. It takes less than ten minutes from start to finish, which is a pity!
The parent-child room type mini bar is free, and there is a free capsule coffee machine in the room. The room can also order 24hr service. The location is too far, so there is basically no takeaway nearby.
Before the trip, the housekeeper Inama added WeChat to help prepare some supplies and hotel project reservations in advance. She was very considerate. If you have any questions during your stay, you can ask her, and the communication is very good.
There are discounts for buffet dinner, but it is not recommended to eat. The Xianshan Hotel next to the hotel is a good stop, and it takes 10 minutes to walk.
The breakfast at the hotel is very good, and the dishes change every day for two days.

The room on the 7th floor was better, and the view of the lake was better. In fact, when booking a room, I emphasized that I hope the room has no peculiar smell. It is completely possible to give a better room at the beginning and save the trouble of changing rooms. There is a lot of dust in the room, and the sanitary condition should be better. Let's say something good, the Intercontinental's breakfast is as good as ever, I hope it can be maintained. The Chinese restaurant tastes ok but when there are few people, there are too few dishes to order, which is not a good experience. The natural scenery of Xianshan Peninsula is excellent, and it is very good to take pictures while walking. Overall satisfied, will go again, I hope the hotel can pay more attention to and improve the service and other details.

The greening and landscape design are first-class, and it is worth spending time to watch it. The hotel has its own exclusive wharf, and you can expect the ferry ticket to the Huangshanjian viewing platform. If Qiandao Lake only goes to one viewing platform, it is Huangshanjian.
      I haven't had a full meal in the hotel, but I have studied the menu and feel that it is too expensive, and an additional 15% service charge will be charged. But there are also two restaurants nearby, which is very convenient to eat.
       The hotel is about half an hour's drive from the city center, which is more suitable for self-driving people. The hotel has exclusive use of Xianshan Mountain and the surrounding lake view, which is very suitable for staying for a few days on vacation.
        The architectural design of the hotel itself is also very good. The wood, stone, red brick, glass curtain wall, etc. are all natural, and the air is filled with a touch of camphor wood, which I like very much. Hope to live again in the future, hope to keep it good and be more refined and warmer.

3: Free upgrade to parent-child lake view room
4: There are welcome gifts (biscuits), fruits (two apples and two oranges), good night drinks (white fungus soup)
5: The child loves Xianshan Braised Pork the most. Every meal has to eat 2 yuan with a bowl of white rice, which is 8 yuan for a bowl of rice, which is a bit expensive.
6: As a parent-child hotel, there are quite a few activities, some of which are free items and some of which are charged items. There is a free park, and the indoor park is really quite big. It is divided into infants, within 8 years old, and then a little older. When we go to such a big park, we are the two of us. The park is great, it is worth bringing children. For the charged items, we rode a bicycle for 160 an hour, which was almost a circle around the hotel.
7: The hot springs are not open outside, they come directly to the room to put water, add ingredients, choose shea butter, and others seem to have lavender and ginger. During the epidemic, I think this is acceptable.
8: The constant temperature swimming pool YYDS has been here for 2 consecutive days. The children in the pool next to it are the favorite.
9: After checking out, the girl at the front desk gave me a souvenir (the last picture)
10: Will come again, Hangzhou people's weekend vacation first.

The Intercontinental Children's Park is very large and has many play items. It is also a good choice for parent-child travel.

msg:1. Take the initiative to downgrade the room type: If you book a room with a view, you will be assigned a regular room type with a price difference of more than 1,000 yuan by default. You have to fight on your own to get the room type you ordered, otherwise you will only suffer a dumb loss.
2. Picnic without guidance: The package you bought includes a picnic. The so-called picnic means giving you the meal and then forgetting about it. I asked three people about the picnic spot and finally learned that to have a picnic, you have to carry a picnic basket weighing several kilograms and walk a kilometer of mountain road to the picnic spot in the sun.
3. Potential safety hazards: When I stayed in the room in the morning, the cleaning staff directly swiped my card to enter, which shocked me. Fortunately, I was sitting at the door. If I was taking a shower, changing clothes or going to the toilet at that time, I didn‚Äôt dare to go too far. think

Thank you to Carina from the Guest Relations Management Depar**ent for adding WeChat to communicate in advance, for the arrangement of the room, and the birthday cake and small toys. It's so sweet. I have been to Qiandao Lake n times. I used to live in the city center. This time, I found that although the location of Intercontinental is a bit out of the way, the parent-child tour for one or two days is completely satisfied. First of all, there are many children's amusement facilities in the hotel. The children also made pottery and picked strawberries. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the lighthouse. The gap is very suitable for children to play. Children say that they will go to Intercontinental in summer.

I followed Miss Xu Yuanyuan of the concierge depar**ent and another lady to tour the hotel on the first day of my arrival. The explanation was great and very patient. In the middle, I also helped to take pictures and hold the children. During the period, not only the scenery was beautiful, but also the children experienced the fun of feeding rabbits, ducks and fish. We stayed in a high-level parent-child room, and the hotel upgraded us to a lake-view parent-child room for free. The hotel is too friendly to children. The room layout is very warm, and there are special children's wash sets and small toilets. The hotel's parent-child activities and restaurants are also good Yes, it is very suitable for bringing children to play, such as the super-large children's playground, the Xianshan train, and the outdoor amusement park. Because of the season, there is no picking activity. The hotel's indoor and outdoor swimming pools are also great~ Because I came during the off-season, people are not There are many, the starry sky bar in the hotel is not open. I ordered a glass of wine in the lobby at night and gave a free one. Here I want to confess to the lady at the bar~
Needless to say about the surrounding environment of the hotel, occupying an island can be imagined, you can take a yacht to visit the lake and mountains, it is not too beautiful, the hotel has a special glass viewing platform to watch the sunset, and the lighthouse next to it is also super nice to take pictures~
The service of the little brother at the front desk is also super attentive. When checking out, he prepared snacks and toys for the children. The whole service is very good~
I finally know why many people say that there are only two types of hotels in Qiandao Lake, InterContinental and others. They are really suitable for leisure vacations, especially for parent-child travel. Recommended! ! !

The hotel has many parent-child amu*****t items, which are enough to satisfy the strong energy of the baby. It is worthy of being the ceiling of the Qiandao Lake parent-child hotel. The afternoon tea included with the package is also good. In short, although the hotel is a bit biased, the itinerary can be fully arranged and enjoy the slow life. .
I especially want to praise the housekeeper, who is very responsible and helps coordinate the upgrade as much as possible during the peak season. However, I am a little dissatisfied with two points: 1. I just got off the bus with a lot of luggage, but the bellboys gathered together to chat with themselves, without any intention to come; 2. The taste of the Xian Xiao Restaurant that comes with the package is really not very good, but There is indeed nothing to eat near the hotel except the hotel, the only regret is.

Open-air hot spring: It is a private soup, with a first-line lake view, and it is absolutely unique.
Heated swimming pool: 30 degrees, a comfortable temperature for swimming in winter. The room is open until 11 o'clock. After dinner, I can take a swim. I like it.
Speedboat Lake Tour: The dock is right behind the hotel, which is very convenient. The yacht is very new. In fact, there is only one to go, so the time is short.
It is a very suitable hotel for vacation, and the waiters will greet each other kindly. Very satisfied with the stay experience

The children's playground is very large and the children had a great time.
Afternoon tea snacks taste good.
A sister was very kind and helped us clean the bathtub in the room again. Thanks! The front desk service is also very good, the business ability is good, and the English and Chinese can be switched freely.
Here are some points that I think need to be improved: 1. The lights in the room should be checked and replaced regularly. There was a light on the top of the big bed in our parent-child room that suddenly went out at night, and after a while, it started to flicker non-stop, which was a bit scary.
2. The espresso made at breakfast is delicious, but the latte in the lobby bar is a bit indescribable. Not sure if it's the coffee beans or something else.
3. After all, during the epidemic period, there will still be people who do not wear a mask to pick up the food when picking up food. Can you kindly remind me again?
As a luxury brand under IHG, I hope Qiandao Lake InterContinental can get better and better.

The children have to play every day, which makes us a lot more relaxed, and the New Year's activities are also very good. It's a pity that the weather is not good, otherwise you can participate in outdoor activities. Looking forward to coming back in summer!

Mia from the guest service added my WeChat to introduce various hotel activities and other content. On the day of check-in, I heard that our three big and one small stayed in the standard room, and the front desk directly upgraded the room to become a suite with two 2-meter bed rooms, and also sent an adult breakfast (original price 188 yuan), delayed check-out Room until 2 o'clock, free 2 drink coupons in the lobby bar and other benefits! happy! The guest service Mia is very meticulous and thoughtful, and the WeChat tracking service throughout the process! Remind us that the "New Year's Market" (the hotel's New Year's event) has delicious and fun things, and also reminded us that there will be lantern riddle guessing activities in the lobby the next morning, which is very heartwarming! During the New Year, we always make our customers feel at home, and I can't even celebrate the New Year by myself. I am really dedicated, and our guests are also very moved.
During the breakfast, the service staff were very many and very enthusiastic. There were always service staff serving coffee to the guests, and there was no need to do it by themselves, and fresh egg tarts were also delivered.
The children had a lot of fun for two days, and the hotel comes with a super large children's playground! There are also small trains and other activities for children.
In the package we bought, there is also a fish head package coupon for Xian Xiaoguan, which is full of weight and full of snacks. The hotel package also includes a warm soup experience. Due to the weather, it is not possible to take a bath outside, so it is changed to a bathtub in the room. The service staff sent desserts, roses and warm soup bath salts to the room. The ceremony was full of sense, and they also released water for the guests. The service was super good!
During the New Year of the Intercontinental Hotel, it is still very thoughtful, the weather is cold, but the guests feel very warm! Great praise! ! !

On average, it took half an hour to finish ordering the first course. Hours, once the main course of fish was only served when the two large and two small main dishes were ready to pay! The son wants to eat white rice at the hotel buffet. I asked the first waiter and said no, and my wife asked the other waiter and said yes. So, do I have it or not, or does it depend on the person?

msg:Perfect check-in at InterContinental gives people a very comfortable feeling, especially the hotel housekeeper, Miss Monroe, who is professional, responsible and careful in arranging everything for you. It feels worth the trip. The professional service reflects the great brand image of InterContinental Hotel!
Guide: Depart from Jianggan District, Hangzhou at 9 am on Sunday. The total distance is 178 kilometers, which is relatively short. Drive to the hotel at 11:20. The journey takes 2 hours. Go to Xianshan Hotel for lunch. The taste is too bad. Go to Xianshan Restaurant in the evening to eat some ** set meal 279 fish head set meal. If it is not enough for 2-3 people, you can order a few side dishes and add 100rmb per person. No.1 Booked the hotel cruise project at 300rmb/person per person. At 2 pm, take the hotel yacht to the observation deck. The cable car is 50rmb/person, including going up and down. It is very comfortable to watch the scenery. The yacht round trip includes the scenery. It takes a total of 2 hours to get to the hotel. We went back early and went back to the hotel to rest at around 3:50. No.2 4:30 is the autumn sunset time (ps: Miss Monroe reminded me) to check in the sunsetüåÑ It‚Äôs so beautiful. No.3 It‚Äôs time for dinner and went to Xianshan Restaurant. I went there and ate a set meal of 279, 100/rmb per person. Your Xianshan Hotel is much more reliable. The taste is better. It may vary from person to person. Netizens said the hotel tasted good, but I was not the one who was criticized.
No.4 After dinner, I took a walk around the hotel and went back to the room to rest. The room lady upgraded me to a suite for free. Thank you very much. There were also fruits and yogurt at night. The room was very clean.
No.5 The next day, we went to pick oranges, see the lighthouse, and ride the train. It was wonderful.

Summary: The housekeeper Miss Monroe is great! InterContinental is worthy of InterContinental. The service is first-class and it is worth it. It is very comfortable. The breakfast is also very rich. The autumn scenery is very pleasant and great.

Swimming pools, outdoor pools, etc. are all closed, and the items in the purchased packages have been changed to beauty or experience locations. Three people checked in and got a good night porridge as a gift. The Chris**as afternoon tea was quite exquisite. There was a Chris**as a**osphere everywhere, but there was a lack of decoration. The overall service is not very smooth. It may be due to the epidemic. The new business flow line is not very familiar to everyone. However, there should be various inconsistent calibers. There are also handover problems. For example, people from different depar**ents will call and ask how many people are there. Order breakfast. However, after all this, it seems that the hotel does not have a general manager to take care of the guests who are not having a good experience at this timeüòì

The location is good and the environment is beautiful. You can appreciate the beauty of Qiandao Lake without leaving the hotel.
The service is very good, every lady is soft-spoken, gentle and patient.
Because I am very concerned about hygiene when raising a baby, I was not disappointed. The bedding was comfortable and the bed was super comfortable to sleep on.
What I am dissatisfied with is that the seat cushions in the room are so worn and have not been updated, which is not the standard of a five-star hotel.
Also, the hotel lobby was not grand enough. There were many people holding Chris**as activities at night and it was crowded. The experience was not good, so I went back to the room to rest soon.
Furthermore, the breakfast experience was not good. There were many people and the restaurant was small and crowded. It was a bit unpleasant to be crowded during the epidemic.
Overall, it was a very comfortable stay. I will consider coming here again when my kids are older.

Now the high-speed rail directly goes to Qiandaohu Station and other reserved hotel buses to the hotel, and the traffic is still very convenient. And the breakfast was not disappointed, the variety is rich and delicious, and there are honeycombs, which makes it very chewy. The cruise project is to go to the tip of Huangshan Mountain. You can take a short cable car to take pictures on the top platform. The scenery is not bad. The lighthouse took a photo from afar. You can eat at the nearby Xianshan Restaurant or the hotel at a discount. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs a pity that I can‚Äôt go to the outdoor swimming pool and watch the lake when it‚Äôs cold. I hope I can make it up next time. When checking in at the hotel, the little brother of the waiter helped upgrade the room and arranged it together and gave him a thumbs up. Others are very good. It feels that the shuttle bus service is a bit less frequent, and the car going back is at 2 pm. You need to check out late to match the time (normal check-out is 12 o'clock) otherwise it is a bit inconvenient to wait, I hope it can be improved.

msg:This time staying at the InterContinental Qiandao Lake Resort, the feelings are as follows:

The first thing is to book the hotel's high-speed rail shuttle bus. Because this Mid-Autumn Festival is afraid of crowds and cars, I don‚Äôt want to drive by myself, so I want to make an appoin**ent when I come down from the high-speed rail. I bought a high-speed rail ticket at 12 o'clock. I wrote about a car appoin**ent at least 24 hours in advance, and then 72 hours in advance, I actually said that Batu at one o‚Äôclock was full. After a phone call, the hotel later changed to a larger bus. This also made me very satisfied, indicating that the hotel Batu It is not a dead brain. They were picked up by a mini-minibus. Later, they were picked up by a travel bus. There were ten adults and three children in the bus. Also like the InterContinental Hotel üëçüèª.

The second is that the service attitude of the aunts in the guest room is super good.

The third is the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. It‚Äôs so-so, the variety is not as rich as I imagined, but it‚Äôs okay to eat. The service staff who ate the breakfast felt very tired, as if they didn‚Äôt sleep well, so I was embarrassed to call her, because When I was in charge, I asked for two cups of American coffee. I almost finished my breakfast and haven't come. Maybe I was too busy. Later, I reminded the staff that they were very enthusiastic.

The fish head at Xian Restaurant is actually better than the Xianshan Restaurant outside. Xianshan Restaurant really lacks service. I ate there twice and I didn‚Äôt think it was delicious. Service charge, but it is about the same as the Xianshan restaurant where I eat out.

The scenery of the 4th InterContinental Qiandao Lake Hotel is quite beautiful, and the hotel rooms are also good. Although the air-conditioning vent is not facing the head of the bed, but the wind is circling on the head again, I had to turn off the air-conditioning and close the screen windows. It was still cool at night. I was bitten to death by a mosquito in the evening, and I got a lot better with mosquito-repellent repellent in the back. I woke up in the morning and found that at least eight to nine mosquitoes were flying in the room.

By the way, if you don‚Äôt bring children, don‚Äôt take that little train. Just drive around the facilities outside the InterContinental Hotel and you‚Äôll be done. It takes less than 20 minutes. It‚Äôs so boring and nothing to look at. I began to think it‚Äôs the same. Looking at the Thousand Island Lake on the hotel island, drive around the lake to see the lake view. Actually it is not, but it‚Äôs okay to take the children‚Äôs parents and the baby to sit around outside the hotel.

Outdoor swimming pool for sunbathing, swimming is good, you don't need to bring towels from the room to go swimming, there are specially equipped swimming towels. Hotel gym, there is no one in the morning, I am alone every morning, it is good, towels and water are provided.

Will go live next time!

Thank you. The restaurant service is also great. A big-eyed brother may be a foreman and is responsive. For breakfast, there are freshly baked bread tarts and freshly hand-made lattes, which are relatively rare in hotel breakfasts, and the taste is not bad. The overall service is very good, even the cleaning aunt will greet you very kindly. It's the children's paradise where the waiter named Hu should be most enthusiastic. The attitude is cold and he has never laughed. It coincides with Halloween and the hotel also engages in trick or treat activities. Although the ratio of knocking and being knocked is a little bit different, the first time it is fun, it should be better next time. The hotel has beautiful scenery, osmanthus is in full bloom this season, and there is a refreshing fragrance in the air. The oranges were also ripe, and I picked a lot of sweet oranges and went home. The entire hotel is the big garden. It‚Äôs the central lake area where you lived in Greentown two days ago. It‚Äôs enough to live here in Qiandao Lake. You can also take part in the hotel‚Äôs Huangshanjian yacht half-day tour. The hotel called twice to ask about the service evaluation. Honestly, I really felt at home and must be praised. Will recommend more friends to come.

This is easy The car was called, but the person in the concierge said that there was only a 2:30 p.m. shuttle bus that day. I thought there were fewer people who took the bus at 11 noon. The bus was cancelled or the reservation was full, but we saw the bus at 11 o‚Äôclock at the door. The car is quite empty, so why tell us that there is only one in the afternoon. I really don't understand! It doesn't make sense to talk about it anymore. The car has been notified to the next hotel to pick it up, which is costly and time-consuming! Neither the consumer nor the hotel benefits anyone. Why bother?

The hotel is located in the southeast lake area of Qiandao Lake. It is very quiet. Before I went there, I was still entangled in what kind of ferry ticket to buy. After the introduction of the lady at the front desk, I found that there is no need at all. The hotel is full of scenery

There are not many restaurants around the hotel. It is recommended to book meals in advance. It may be because of the off-season, the catering and SPA services are a bit indifferent.

The overall feeling is very good. I haven't stayed enough and I have a chance to come again!

Originally booked a view room, and then upgraded to a parent-child view room. Although it is not a lake view room, it is also great, with two extra-large 2-meter beds. There is a partition in the middle, which is really great! We are not affected when the baby sleeps outside. The bathroom sink is a bit small, and the cosmetics are not enough, hahaha. The disposable bath bag I bring is so comfortable to take a bath once a day. The bath water is not too big, but it is not bad. The first thing I leave the house every day is to see the lake view, it‚Äôs super beautiful
I originally planned to go to the Central Lake District one day, but I didn't have enough fun at all. The hotel is enough for you to play, and I took my baby to lie down and play.
The baby brought on the first day goes directly to the swimming pool. Just change your bathing suit in the room and wear a bathrobe, but be careful to get lost. Haha üòÉ sent the net celebrity lifebuoy in advance, you can inflate for free here.
Then I had a buffet dinner, with my favorite crab legs. Breakfast seems to be quite a lot, and there are five-star services, but it may be due to the lack of variety, but in fact it has reached the five-star standard, which seems to be less, not as good as some of the five-stars in Shanghai.
Then you can go to watch the sunset, take a walk to see the internet celebrity lighthouse, there is a large children‚Äôs playground on the first floor, it‚Äôs really enough to take your baby to the hotel
Eating Chinese food, Western food, Western food all day
There is an additional service charge, but the buffet (not enough people clearing the plates) may also be too much for me. But I have tried my best to continue to get the dishes, mainly crab shells. The buffet has grilled giant prawns that Jiangsu people have never eaten before. You can try it. I also like crab legs, and ice cream after eating.
In addition, praise the concierge depar**ent, help me collect express delivery, make an appoin**ent for a bus to go to the high-speed rail station, and help me push my luggage with a luggage cart by the way. Thank you for the little brother who carts the concierge.
Will come next time, in the off-season in winter, hahahahaha.

msg:I have been planting grass in Qiandao Lake Intercontinental, and wanted to bring my baby to play, but this time I finally pulled the grass. During the epidemic period, I chose this time specially, the weekend of the first week of the fall term, so there are not many people, and the experience is great!

Location
Intercontinental location, exclusive Xianshan Peninsula, so there is no other choice besides him. Those who like liveliness will find it a bit biased; but those who like to play quietly will find it better. What's more, the food here is so delicious and the activities are so rich. Staying for two days will make you completely useless.

Beauty
The scenery of Xianshan Peninsula is still very beautiful, you can climb Xianshan, check in the net red lighthouse, and take pictures of the beautiful sunset. You can walk by yourself, or you can wait for the hotel staff to lead the team every afternoon.

delicacy
The buffet at InterContinental is very good. Every dish has the taste of small pot dishes. The addition is timely and the time period is long. The stir-fried dishes at InterContinental Xian Restaurant are also good, so you don't have to worry about eating here. The set meal we bought comes with a buffet every night, so two buffets in the morning and evening a day, lunch is just casual.

Activity
Intercontinental activities are very rich, and the parent-child paradise is particularly large. The time we arrived was very good, it was hot, so every day from 4pm to 5pm, there are special activities in the outdoor swimming pool. One hundred and fifty-seven is a challenge on a floating mat, and two or six is a bubble party. The child had a great time.

service
The hotel staff are very serious and enthusiastic, both the receptionist and the cleaning aunt Liu Xia are very serious and responsible. Live comfortably.

So, if you haven't been to InterContinental, you can really come and have a weekend. Two or three days is enough.

The 10-km scenic road is so amazing that there is absolutely no need to go around the lake. Internet celebrity attractions one by one punched in, still hot and sweating under the big sun. The lobby bar of the hotel really needs to strengthen the air conditioning. The day I arrived was 35 degrees high, although the lobby bar had blackout curtains, it was still not in the sun, and there was no way to enjoy afternoon tea.

The hotel floor is not high, the lower floor is relatively humid, and the indoor swimming pool is more There are not many wardrobes.

msg:Due to the epidemic, I took a family outing on the last weekend of the summer vacation and booked 2 luxurious lake views + breakfast and dinner for 2 days. After arriving at the hotel, I was told it was a side lake view, so I added money to upgrade to an administrative lake view. The Qiandao Lake facing the lake is full of perspective.
1. Service: The hotel's service is satisfactory and meets the 5-star standard, and the bellman can take the initiative to help carry luggage into the room. The room was cleaned promptly and tidy, but there was no turn-down service. The hotel does not take the initiative to provide disposable toothbrushes. You can ask for them when you check in. Children's toothbrushes are available.
2. Room: Very spacious, with cloakroom. There is no smart toilet, and the hair dryer has not been replaced by Dyson. It has been renovated for some years. It may be that the lake is damp and there is a smell in the room. And the light in the room is a bit dim, so I can't read books at night.
3. Executive Lounge: Normal afternoon tea, few drinks and snacks to choose from, a three-layer birdcage cake per table, no fruit.
4. Buffet dinner: The place is not big, you need to book a seat in the lobby in advance, otherwise you need to wait during peak hours, and some seats are outdoors. Now the weather is really overwhelming. There are not many meals, but the beef noodles on the first day were really good, but on the second day, there was no beef, only clear noodles. Restaurant service is good when there are few people, active and enthusiastic. However, there were more guests dining on Saturday the next day, and the ratio of waiters was slightly insufficient. In addition, I don‚Äôt understand that the dinner buffet does not provide coffee.
5. Swimming pool: The hotel has 1 indoor and 2 outdoor swimming pools, but only one swimming pool and two doll pools are open outdoors. There are different activities for children every afternoon. The children at the bubble party on Saturday were crazy. However, there are more people, and you can't swim in the pool, you can only play in the water. If you want to swim, it is recommended to go in the morning.
6. Hotel location: After getting off the expressway, you need to drive about 9 kilometers to reach the hotel. Basically, you will move around in the hotel after you check in. It would be troublesome to go out if you are not traveling by car. Suitable for pure vacation.

In addition, the hotel has insufficient air conditioning. Especially the room, because the room faces west, the glass windows of the room under the direct sun in the afternoon feel hot and hot to the touch. As a result, the sofa sitting next to the window was like sitting next to the stove. The air conditioner didn't work at all. We didn't feel the coolness after entering the room for a long time. I really don‚Äôt plan to go to the executive lounge to cool off, but the air-conditioning in the executive lounge is cold only at the entrance, and the seats, especially the window seats, are still hot, and I keep sweating while sitting. You have to wait until the sun is going down in the evening before you can feel the cool breeze from the air conditioner.

The entertainment facilities are slightly less for older children over the age of 12, and more development is expected in the later stage. To be ready for self-driving, you need to climb up the mountain. The hotel is built on a peninsula and is basically isolated from the world. Takeaway services such as Star Daddy are beyond the scope of delivery. Vacation‚õ±Ô∏è=Retreat, lake view, sunset, negative ions, just lie flat.

I have stayed in many luxury hotels at home and abroad, but I still want to give InterContinental a compliment. The first is the natural scenery, the only one on Xian Mountain, the landscape has nothing to say. I stayed in a deluxe double bed room with lake view, misty and rainy, lakeside waning, beautiful views of the south of the Yangtze River, intoxicating. The second is the hotel hardware facilities, as always, intercontinental standards, with a sense of design and comfort. The hotel focuses on parent-child style, with a large children‚Äôs playground and indoor and outdoor swimming pools, as well as the hotel‚Äôs own Huangshan Jiandeng Island tour and various parent-child projects. The cafeteria is a bit small. When there are a lot of people, you have to sit outside, but the serving speed is very fast. Finally, comment on the software service. Our auntie, "Yao Meiying", is very caring. She often asks us what else we need. The cleaning is also very clean, and the clothes are neatly folded. Our room is a mini bar. The child likes the potato chips in it. On the day of check-out, the aunt also sent a can of it. We stayed for 6 days and 5 nights, and it is considered as a long-term guest. I still feel that we haven't had enough and hope to come again if we have a chance.

Even if the infinity pool has a concave shape, there are too many people. Those with children can play Ari Paradise, which has a lot of content. In addition, there are yoga studios, fitness studios, go-karts, small trains, etc. to choose from.
Don't go out when you go to the hotel, because the traffic is really inconvenient. After all, the hotel is on the mountain. Of course, you can ignore this if you drive by yourself.

My wife is delicious! The egg custard is smooth and tender, the braised pork is soft and waxy, and the fish-flavored shredded pork is delicious. These dishes in this restaurant are on our taste buds! For the sight and deliciousness, this trip did not come in vain.

But the only thing that is not very good is the desserts. No surprises. As a five-star hotel standard is not amazing enough. I hope I can do more and better! The environment is really nothing to say, it's so beautiful. The air is fresh and pleasant, and the lake view room is absolutely top-notch. Next time you will choose to stay

After check-in, I will tell you what activities are scheduled for the day, and the hotel has a good service attitude. There are two infinity swimming pools, swimming and watching the lake view, the experience is very good. At two o'clock in the afternoon, there is a boat from the hotel to Huangshanjian, and you can see the word ‚ÄúThe World is the Public‚Äù on the island. The charter boat is also very good, and you can buy lift tickets on the boat. The view of the lake view room is excellent, and the sweet and sour pork ribs and sauerkraut fish in the Chinese restaurant also taste great. I stayed at Sheraton, Hilton and InterContinental in Qiandao Lake this time. InterContinental is the best experience and will come again.

msg:A hotel suitable for vacation! (I was told to upgrade the room type as soon as I went, and the holiday mood value instantly improved!)
Pleasant scenery: I was amazed by the afterglow of the setting sun at first sight!
The location is right by the lake, and you need to drive a section of the road around the lake to reach the hotel. It should be said that this section of the road is set up for the hotel, so it is more convenient to drive by yourself. But I heard that there is also a shuttle bus from the high-speed rail station to the hotel.
For parent-child travel, the swimming pool is standard in summer, both indoors and outdoors. In addition, if you are afraid of heat, the hotel has its own "Ali Parent-child Paradise", which is free for hotel guests, which can meet the basic needs of children.
For meals, the quality of the food in the hotel is good, especially the fish head soup at Xian Restaurant, which tastes very fragrant.
For activities in the hotel, you can choose to cruise on the "Huangshan Peak", climb up to appreciate the "world is for the public" (I chose to climb the mountain on a hot day and I was defeated by my physical strength, and I chose to take the cable car when I went down the mountain); You can also cycle around the hotel.
In addition, an extra bed is available, parking is free, and you can have a full breakfast. I like the tofu flower, fried dough sticks and spicy pork noodles inside.

The indoor swimming pool is relatively standard, and the outdoor swimming pool has a good view. You can enjoy the lake view while playing in the water. The breakfast is as rich as always, the taste is better, and it is more Chinese. The farmhouse outside the hotel tastes very good and the price is cheap. The room is very large and has a small balcony. The sofa on the balcony can enjoy the lake view while reading, which is very cozy. The sofa in the room can definitely be used as a single bed, avoiding an extra bed. The hotel has a comprehensive selection of pillows, which is very convenient for those who have requirements for pillows. The hotel service is good, there are fruits on arrival at the hotel. However, the hotel room lights are dim, so if children do their homework, they can only rely on the sunshine during the day.

The photo taken by the internet celebrities entering the door is very beautiful, and the outdoor swimming pool is also very nice, but when I checked in, because the Ctrip member gave a welcome drink, the welcome fruit said that it would be delivered to the room. I asked if it was not delivered after 8 o'clock. I said that I would send it, and I asked about it at 9 o'clock that I didn't talk about sending fruit, and then I said it did. Although it doesn't matter whether there is fruit, it feels like asking for it. The sanitary condition of the room is worrying, and there are dead flies in the room. Stayed for one night and was bitten by mosquitoes! After reporting to the front desk, his face was expressionless, and once again reflected that the manager gave some comfort! This kind of service is completely inconsistent with the quality of the hotel. The details really require some thought.

Although there were a lot of people when we checked in, we basically didn't feel the crowd and noisy behind. I don't know if it was because I checked in at a staggered time on Monday. Fortunately, I was upgraded to the room. I was so happy. We booked afternoon tea for two on Ctrip, and the meal was very good. However, it seems that bookings made through Ctrip cannot accumulate ihg. The breakfast is very rich, and the cruise to Huangshanjian is also very good.

It is very suitable for relaxing and relaxing! I paid a fee to upgrade the lake view room at the front desk of the hotel. Because I wanted a lake view room facing the AB area, the hotel carefully arranged for me a room on the high floor facing the lake. The guest relationship Monroe received me. The little girl was very happy. Enthusiasm, answered a lot of questions for me, like this! Qiandao Lake Tourism is still very recommended for all travellers to come and experience!

msg:The environment is good, the service needs to be refined, and the details need to be strengthened.
The environment is the best one of several thousand island lake tours. It is exclusive to Xianshan Peninsula. There are bayberry forest and fish pond in the park. The children also saw the little rabbits, but although the room was booked with luxurious lake view, it was given to the corner For the semi-lake view room, the front desk admits that there is a difference in scenery, but the basis for dividing the room is unclear, but emphasizes that this is a lake view room. Since the scenery is different, it is recommended to sell it as a lake view and a deluxe lake view. Leave it to the customer, not the feeling of the front desk.
The service is average. After the check-in is completed, a lot of cards and coupons are just let you hold them directly, aren't they all in an envelope? I even saw that she took out the coupon from the envelope, can't I put it back? I booked a dinner in a Chinese restaurant. When I made a reservation, the other party asked if the number of people needed baby chairs and baby tableware. When I went there, they didn't arrange seats, and asked again if they needed baby chairs and tableware. What's the significance of the reservation? On the first night, there was a Dragon Boat Festival event to pack zongzi in the hotel. It was said that the zongzi packaged by myself would be delivered to dinner at the Chinese restaurant that night, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. I don‚Äôt know the meaning of the activity. . .
Facilities and other details still need to be perfected. For example, a hotel that focuses on parenting and children does not know if it has been observed that the height of the dining chairs and the dining table is actually slightly mismatched. The table is a bit high when children eat; the children‚Äôs playground is indeed relatively large, very good, and management It‚Äôs not bad, but I still haven‚Äôt investigated what the children‚Äôs real preferences are on the project. It is recommended to add some simulated kitchens, Lego and other toys.
In short, I hope this InterContinental, which sells parents and children, can truly "squat down" to get close to the demands of children, and can find the location of the resort hotel and improve the quality of service~

The hotel provides a shuttle service from Qiandao Lake High-speed Railway Station at 25 yuan per person, which is very convenient. The outdoor infinity swimming pool is a highlight, right by the lake, with beautiful scenery. In the morning, there is an outdoor sketching class next to the swimming pool. It is very pleasant to watch other people's paintings or stare at Qiandao Lake in a daze.

Check-in efficiency is high, the hotel has carefully arranged the room in advance, and sent a welcome fruit. The overall decoration style in the room is a holiday wind, the area of 135, likes the living room and the outdoor double balcony, and the Dyson hair dryer is more than expected. The hotel itself is large, you can spend a whole day without going out, skating, fitness, riding around the lake, watching the sunset together. Enjoyed the tour, it was a pleasant journey.

In addition, the hotel provides various travel and play ways, all near the hotel, we participated in watching the sunset and the yacht to Huangshan Jian, all good

msg:The first time I came to Qiandao Lake, I chose the highest-level Intercontinental Hotel in the area, and the result was a complete mess. Share the following points
1 The air-conditioning in the public areas of the hotel is poor, and you sweat every minute. The most outrageous thing is that the elevator from the underground parking lot to the lobby has no air-conditioning, which is hotter than the ba*****t.
2 Going to the gym at night, the gym said that it can be used after 11:00 at night, but there is no service staff. As a result, at 10:45, I was notified by the staff: Can the handsome guy come tomorrow, we have to rest......
3 The package includes a daily seafood buffet dinner. It is reasonable for a hotel of this level to have some dishes updated every day in the buffet, not to mention most of them, at least a small part will be changed. As a result, I went for two days, and the exact same dishes were really not changed at all.
4 At 12 o'clock in the night, I wanted to ask the front desk some questions, but no one answered the call
5 The overall decoration of the hotel is outdated, it really does not match the price
6 The most important point is that the location of their home is really not next to the important local attractions, because I am traveling by car, so I come by car. It takes nearly ten kilometers to get out of his hotel to the main road, and all of them are winding mountain roads, and it is very tiring to drive. Just go to any scenic spot and start 20-30 kilometers. It is too inconvenient to go back and have a rest when you are tired from playing at noon. If you say that you are a mysterious fairyland, I also recognize Xanadu, this scenery is really better than any city Linhu.

msg:This summer, I will bring my whole family to stay at the InterContinental Qiandao Lake. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and rivers. Needless to say, the scenery and facilities are in line with the consistent standards of InterContinental. It is worth mentioning the service. Before arriving at the hotel, the housekeeper has added WeChat intimately to inform the hotel of activities in advance. It happened to be my birthday during my stay. The housekeeper Xiao Niu not only let the housekeeping depar**ent decorate the room carefully, but also presented cakes and small gifts, which was a big surprise on the birthday. The afternoon tea in the lobby every day is also very rich, and the fish head soup in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious. Next time I travel to Qiandao Lake, I will choose to stay here!

msg:I chose InterContinental on the recommendation of my colleagues. I walked along Panshan Road to the hotel. The scenery along the way is very beautiful.
I am very grateful to the housekeeper Xiaosu for this stay. After adding me on WeChat, he pushed me the hotel's summer activities. He was also very patient in dealing with my problems, and he was able to help me contact the restaurant and the concierge depar**ent in time according to my needs. Finally Before leaving, I also arranged luggage service and souvenirs very thoughtfully, thank you very much.
Basically, the hotel staff you meet are very nice. Everyone will greet you warmly and help you solve various problems. Because the child was riding slowly, the staff at the bicycle rental office was delayed from getting off work. The little girl was not impatient, and she smiled and told me that it was okay; the lifeguard by the swimming pool basically stared at the swimming child. I want to know how to get to Peninsula Lake. , the lifeguard was afraid that I couldn‚Äôt explain clearly, so he wanted to ask his colleagues to take me directly; the uncle at the main entrance saw the child alone, and would also care about where the parents were; the aunt who drove the small train would remind me which way to ride is smoother ; Every time I ask for directions and every time I call the customer service depar**ent, I get an immediate response.
The hotel exclusively occupies the Xianshan Peninsula, with a large area and unique scenery. There are many options for cycling, car rental, garden trails, outdoor swimming pool, children's playground, and various activities. Because there is only one hotel, you can only feel that there are more people when you are eating. The whole is quiet and comfortable, and it also has its own internet celebrity attractions that you can check in. If it is not because the weather is too hot for this trip, it will definitely be a perfect vacation trip.
Overall, the only regret is that the restaurant did not meet expectations. The overall taste of the Chinese restaurant is salty, and the dishes in the cafeteria are relatively small.
I will come again if I have a chance in the future.
