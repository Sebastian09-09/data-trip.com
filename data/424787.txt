The mattress is very comfortable, but there are few sockets in the room and the refrigerator is a bit loud. I don‚Äôt know if there is a leakage in the elevator, but I feel an electric shock every time I press it!
The overall hygiene is very clean. The staff's service is very good. They take the initiative to help with luggage, open the door when getting in and out of the car, and respond quickly to room requests.
There are embassies nearby the hotel. It is very convenient to take a taxi to Tiananmen, Wangfujing and Guomao business district. It is also very close to the subway station due to traffic jams. You can also see the nearby scenery outside the window.
The hot spring in the hotel is great. When you are tired from shopping every day, you can go and soak in it to relieve your leg pain. The only drawback is that it is a bit far from the room and a bit of a walk.

The best thing is that the view from the room can see Ritan Park and Chaoyang CBD. It is much more open than the magnificent scenery, which is very pleasant. The ventilation situation is also much better than that of Conrad in the same area. If the Belt and Road Initiative hadn‚Äôt tripled the room prices, I would have chosen this cost-effective and energetic hotel when visiting Beijing in the future.

Although the hotel facilities are indeed a bit old, the service is really perfect. The concierge at the door, the lady who checked in, and the aunt who cleaned the 19th floor were all enthusiastic and professional! In particular, our housekeeper manager Sophia arranged for a room with a great view on the top floor and had it arranged early. Birthday cake and red wine for the husband, check-in gifts for the children, and it was a special honor to be invited to participate in the evening ceremony with a saber and champagne. Everything makes us feel very warm! Next time I come to Beijing, I will continue to choose St. Regis!

It was later upgraded to St. Regis, the first St. Regis hotel in China. The hotel facilities are very old and have not been updated. The socket in the bathroom is broken, and the mattress is very uncomfortable. It feels like a very old hotel. Very old mattress with very strong spring feeling. But the linen experience is very good. The spare parts are the remede used by St. Regis. The highlight is that in the current trend of environmental protection in hotels, this St. Regis can still keep small bottles of spare parts. It is really great. And the soap is Ritz-Carlton Asprey. The room decoration is old, but the service meets the St. Regis standard. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, the service is very good, the recreational facilities are very old and not well maintained, and the walls and countertops in the shower are moldy. This hotel really needs a facelift.

msg:Although the hotel is very old, the elaborate and luxurious materials used in the decoration and design of that year can still be glimpsed.
This kind of luxury is beyond the reach of many so-called new five-star hotels today.
It is worth mentioning that the service, from the doorman to the check-in, and the exclusive butler service, all make the guests feel meticulous and thoughtful.
Members also gave breakfast to children under the age of 11. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, the taste of the ingredients is still excellent.
Swimming pools and hot springs are the best hotel options for those who don't want to go to scenic spots on a hot day.
This is my second stay at St. Regis, and it should be my first choice next time I come to Beijing.

msg:The hotels in Beijing all have their own characteristics. The St. Regis Hotel attracts me in many ways. First of all, it is very close to the Guomao business district, so it is convenient to go anywhere for business or leisure. The scenery outside the window is superb, and all the distinctive landmark buildings in the CBD are within sight. Taking a random photo has the feeling of Chinese Manhattan. Furthermore, they have natural hot springs on the ba*****t floor. The hot springs not only have hot water pools but also cold water pools. It feels good to soak in hot springs alternately with cold and hot water. The kaiseki cuisine in the Japanese restaurant is very delicate and tastes very good. The design style of the room has a quiet old-fashioned luxury. The small bar has a richer variety of drinks than other hotels, and the staying experience is very good! Whether it is a business trip or a family trip, you will not feel bored staying here. I highly recommend it.

msg:I feel that it is very difficult to choose a hotel in Beijing. Many five-star hotels have been open for a long time. This time I chose Beijing St. Regis because of the comments that the butler service is very good. I arrived at the hotel in the morning and checked in smoothly. Although the room is It‚Äôs not too big, but it‚Äôs well-equipped with all the details. The decoration is retro and tasteful. As soon as I arrived in the room, the butler called to introduce the hotel‚Äôs situation, but the phone was disconnected and I didn‚Äôt quite hear it. üòÇ When I said I needed children‚Äôs products, they would deliver them quickly Arrived, every day when I go back to the room, it is cleaned neatly and I am very satisfied~ The only thing I am not satisfied with is the hair dryer, which is a bit old-fashioned, and the air volume is relatively small~ In short, this is a hotel that will be given priority for my next visit~

The mattress is very soft, please choose carefully if you bring the elderly or are used to moderate mattresses. The mattress was so soft that I couldn't fall asleep all night when I opened my eyes. Even if the mattress was turned over after reflecting, it can only be said to be passable. The sanitation is average, there is dust on the toilet glass, and there are cigarette butts in the public area. The sockets in the room are mostly foreign sockets. There are only two sockets in China, and all of them are broken. In the end, I had to call a power board to line up for charging in turn. The basic living functions are not guaranteed, and even after reporting to the front desk, they did not propose to change the room. The only salvage is that the service is ok, but it's just a good attitude but no improvement measures or any idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãremedial. . . I will definitely not live again, such a big brand has been ruined by this hotel in Beijing

I can't go out of Beijing this holiday, so let's go to St. Regis outside Jianguomen! The service is good, the room size is large, and coffee and tea are unlimited. Both breakfast and lunch were eaten at Jingyuan Cafe. Looking at the beautiful garden behind through the glass window, it felt very good!
The location of the hotel is very good. You can swim and take a hot spring. There are several pools of different temperatures to choose from.
There is one thing I don't understand, that is, there is a charge for parking. You can stay at a hotel at half price, but this is the first time that you have encountered it. Even half price is 6 yuan per hour, and the price is calculated 24 hours a day. Living for two days, the parking fee is a lot, which is very incomprehensible.

The two doormen and the girl at the front desk must give a bad review! After staying for three days, the doorman did not open the door even once. Maybe St. Regis' doorman is only responsible for standing guard. I didn't see a smiling face during check-in and check-out. Maybe the hotel has a rule not to smile? The attitude when handling the renewal business is also very bad. Maybe everyone wants to check out quickly!

msg:Counting the fifth St. Regis hotel in Macau in China, I am very satisfied with the standard quality control of St. Regis, but it feels wrong when I enter St. Regis Beijing. The lighting in the lobby is dim, and the butler service basically disappears. I am completely disappointed when I enter the room. The decoration is outdated , The beige specialization brings me back to 20 years ago, the shower room is completely in the bathtub, is it an express hotel! I hope that the quality control of St. Regis can be unified after the renovation.

He also gave the hotel Spring Festival couplets when he left. I have brought them back as a souvenir. The hotel is surrounded by embassies of various countries, and there are many western restaurants where you can taste delicious food; the hotel is also very close to the train station, half an hour away, and you can also visit Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City on the way. I will stay again next time I have a chance.

msg:The hotel is really too old. The female manager at the front desk is very pushy and has a proud attitude. She doesn't give any discounts for booking two suites for 5 or 6 days. It makes her look ugly when she upgrades. Later, I told the housekeeper that the room was a bit small, and it was immediately upgraded to a larger room. The attitude of the other waiters except her is very good. We thought that everything was in the hotel, and all the waiters were looking for us, thank you very much.

msg:St. Regis has always been my personal favorite hotel brand.
‚óèThe location is not evaluated. It is located near the embassy area, close to Chang'an Avenue, where an inch of land is worth a lot of money. It takes less than ten minutes to walk to Metro Line 1 and 50 minutes to Tiananmen Square.
‚óèThe hotel lobby is magnificent, revealing low-key luxury and luxury everywhere. Although the room is small, the overall feeling is very good. In particular, the bedding is very comfortable, and I can study and buy a set to go home.
‚óèBecause the hotel APP always reported errors, this time I made a reservation through a third-party platform. The front desk recognized my platinum membership and immediately notified the butler to go to the room to introduce the hotel's facilities and services.
‚óèThere are fewer types of happy hour in the executive lounge, and there is not much choice. The breakfast is really good, the service is also online, and the experience is super good. The swimming pool is on the first floor of the hotel apar**ent and is 1.2 meters to 1.8 meters. There are many guests with children. It is recommended to go to the peak.
All in all, this hotel is a good choice for business trips and family vacations.

msg:Overall okay, not as good as the pictures. I booked an executive room, the whole room has a writing desk and sockets at the head of the bed that can be charged, but the one at the head of the bed is still broken. Finally, I was given a plug board, which was barely enough to charge the phone on the sofa or bed after connecting the power supply of the writing desk. . I tripped over this power ***** countless times in the middle of the night (who would have expected such a long power ***** in a hotel?) The air outlet of the air conditioner made a loud noise, and I fell asleep with earplugs plugged in all night. The reading lights, two in the sofa area and two at the head of the bed, can't be controlled separately, either they are all on or they are all off.

The hygiene is also average, the bathtub is not brushed at all, and there is a layer of white powder on the hand. The toiletries provided by the hotel are the best. The soap sticks directly to the sink after using it once, and the buckle can't be buckled. The dandruff on my head has been used up after shampooing (I have never had dandruff), and my hair still smells bad.

What I complained the most was the New Year's Eve buffet. I didn't say that I had to book a seat in advance. I didn't have a seat when I went there, so I found a seat in the lobby temporarily. The food is really average, it‚Äôs about 200 yuan for a buffet, and 488 for New Year‚Äôs Eve. The only good ones are oysters and lobster.

The attitude of the service staff is not bad, and the response is also timely. It is the only advantage.

The hotel service is very good. They gave me a free upgrade to the diplomatic double room, extended the check-out time, and gave me a gift when I left the hotel. Miss Zhao Shuyi at the front desk was warm and thoughtful. The breakfast was mediocre, with my favorite smoked salmon. The swimming pool has a large pool, a hot spring massage pool, and a small baby pool. Several swimming pools are switched back and forth. My children are overjoyed and spent two and a half days by the pool. There are Jinhu Tea Restaurant and BLT American semi-buffet restaurant in the hotel yard. You are hungry after swimming.

In 1.1, the central air-conditioning of the entire hotel was no problem, which was sufficient
2. Breakfast is very good, both Chinese and Western, and there are many varieties
3 There is also a small TV on the bathroom mirror, which is very fresh for children
4. The parent-child room is booked, so there are small snacks in the room, but not every day, I will give you a supplement after asking...

Unsatisfactory
1. Before check-in, I would like to say that Ctrip can only check in at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, so check-out can be delayed. I called 64606688 and the switchboard answered the phone. I was very impatient. I raised my voice and didn‚Äôt talk to me. Speaking to me, let me ask the front desk not to ask her, and said that it is recommended to check in at four or five o‚Äôclock when the clean-up is the most secure. Why don‚Äôt you let me check in at midnight to be more secure? I resisted letting her turn to my front desk. The attitude of the front desk was better and promised to check out at two o‚Äôclock. At the same time, I said that I would complain about the one who answered the phone before. Only then did I know that there is another switchboard who did not call the front desk directly. I wanted to cancel the reservation. I was in a bad mood. My wife said nothing but I had to give it up because the afternoon was over.
2. Went for a buffet dinner after check-in. It was scary with little stuff. It was basically the worst dinner at a five-star hotel in history. It charged more than 360 for one person. It was so bad that we never stayed outside of breakfast for two days. Eaten again on the first floor

3. There are no hot springs, just two small heated swimming pools, and there are no children's facilities

4. There is static electricity in the elevator and it gets electric every time, indicating that this is a very old hotel

In short, the price/performance ratio is too low, and it is also a lesson to spend money to buy

msg:Reservation: Suddenly I wanted to soak in a hot spring. My child chose a hotel in the city late after school. The hotel was temporarily booked on Friday morning. The waiter at the front desk was very enthusiastic and attentive to help me solve the problem and try to meet my needs. One of the rooms also helped me upgrade the room type, but I forgot to ask her name, thank you again here !
Arriving at the shop: It was already 6 o'clock in the evening when I arrived, and the hotel entrance sign was not clear at night, and I followed the navigation in the dark. Only I checked in, the speed is very fast, the hotel facilities are introduced in detail!
When I arrived on the floor, I didn‚Äôt expect that the butlers were already waiting for us at the door of the room. They introduced the room facilities enthusiastically and in detail, and asked me about my personal washing preferences and needs again. The child also received a card. The child likes to leave the store. You want to take it home, but even if you book an executive floor room, there is no executive floor courtesy. Only some soft drinks are available until 17:00. Happy hour is only for gold card guests and it is not convenient compared to other Marriott brands.
During our stay, the butler, alp Yu, provided us with a lot of help. He also went to work early to help me print. He also prepared small gifts for the children when we checked out. Unfortunately, we checked out early and asked us again after we got home. For the check-in experience and the problems encountered, I also want to thank him especially here!
I also encountered some problems during my stay. For example, there was basically no heating in the rooms at the corners. I hope that the front desk can be more careful when making arrangements and adjust the room temperature to a suitable temperature in advance. In the changing room of the hot spring area, bath towels are no longer provided at night. After the child comes out of the bath and communicates with the waiter, the bath towel is given, and the child waits in the cold. The breakfast is slightly less rich than the hotel brand. There are fewer large tables suitable for families, and the service speed of the waiter needs to be improved. I asked for baby tableware but only provided dinner plates and water glasses.

I hope these problems will have a more pleasant experience when I return to stay next time!

Special thanks to Luo Huan in the lobby bar for helping us receive us before get off work, giving the children more biscuits and introducing St. Regis's characteristics. I am also very grateful to Yang Jie of Tianbao Pavilion and her partners for their enthusiastic care. The dining at the St. Regis in Beijing is really good, and the breakfast is particularly delicious among hotels of the same level. Not to mention the swimming pool, it is very large and the hot springs are also very comfortable.

msg:The hotel is considered to be a veteran five-star hotel in Beijing. The hardware facilities are relatively outdated. The window seals in the room have been falling off. The overall design style is very European and the hotel swimming pool is great. The butler service was very jet lag, and I renewed my stay on Sunday night. The waiter who cleaned the house the next day didn't even know, thinking that I was going to check out, and the cleaning was not careful. After the renewal, there is no butler actively contacting whether the room supplies need to be added, and the free mini bar has not been renewed. The breakfast is considered exquisite and there are not many varieties, and the dishes are basically the same every day, and the restaurant service is not bad. I hope that since there is a feature of butler service, the details can be kept, after all, the St. Regis feature is also the core point.

Because I didn't get a clean room in time after I arrived at the store, I also specially gave breakfast as a gift. The service attitude is super good and very professional.
The room is huge, the bed is a bit too soft, I am almost stuck in it. The TV is not directly facing the bed. Although it can be pulled, the angle of rotation is limited. It looks awkward. Fruits were also provided every day. Seeing that we drank a lot, I gave me many bottles of mineral water.
The breakfast is also rich in variety, high quality, very comfortable and satisfying. There are special snacks in Beijing every day, but they are not the same.
Next time I have a chance, I have to live here, and the baby is quite satisfied!

msg:The concierge can't talk about the service. The quality of the staff is extremely poor, scolding the staying guests, and the management staff has a bad attitude. I think it is tall. The front desk service is excellent. The customer service is excellent. management team! Worst concierge team ever in a 5 star hotel!
