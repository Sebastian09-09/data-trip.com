Chose to stay two nights for our wedding anniversary and it was absolutely worth it. 
Great service, great food, beautiful decoration and amazing location. 

They have a table filled with candy for you to take from any time you want - do I need to say more?

The room had a massage chair and a couple of cool extra tech things like a plastic pistol that turns off the lamp next to your bed..

Staff were super friendly, helpful and a pleasure to talk to.

Tip - get the room with a balcony - it‚Äôs fantastic. 

Thanks Eclat for a great stay. Hope to visit again soon!

When I checked in, the girl at the front desk couldn‚Äôt remember the breakfast time and when she took me to my room she couldn‚Äôt remember how to go. For the price I paid I expected much bigger choice of food and much better service for breakfast. The second day I ordered one portion of ÊãÖÊãÖÈù¢ with the request of having hard noodle, but the waiter replied that the chef was busy and didn‚Äôt have time, even if there were only 5 or 6 other guests, then I understood that they already prepared few bowls of noodles and didn‚Äôt want to cook more. I met the GM and he was so kind to give me the opportunity to check out whenever I wanted, but then the front desk asked me to leave my room maximum within 2pm. I paid almost 6000 RMB per night and I think that for this price the hotel should offer a better service. Anyway I strongly recommend to book the pool suite and to enjoy the comfort of the room!

The hotel manager was very kind and personally took us to visit the hotel's art collection, and explained in detail the origin and meaning of each piece. This is not just a simple stay experience, but also a cultural journey to deeply understand art and design. The location is very convenient and the hotel's gym is also very good.

Every corner of the hotel reveals a unique artistic a**osphere, making people feel the perfect combination of art and life. Thanks to the hotel team for their warm hospitality and professional explanation, this stay experience is particularly memorable. The family is very satisfied with the arrangement this time and will come again if there is a chance in the future!

The candy table on the 16th floor is the favorite of children. There are different small sofas in each elevator, and the murals and collections are also collected by the owner.

The entire hotel is full of art, and every corner feels very thoughtful. The staff has good service and proactively asked questions about room upgrades.

In addition, the shower water is very good and the beds are comfortable.

When I arrived at the front desk, the waiter brought hot tea and warm towels. Mr. Zhang at the front desk received us warmly and professionally, and sent us to the guest room to introduce the facilities in detail. When I checked out, I asked to leave the room card as a souvenir. Mr. Zhang not only responded but also specially selected a new room card for me, which made me experience five-star service. The front desk introduced the hotel's art brother. I forgot to ask his name. The introduction of the hotel's large number of artworks opened our eyes and made us feel that staying at the Yiheng Hotel was a great value. Although the hotel has been open for ten years, it has been well maintained in all aspects, and it is located in Parkview Green, which is very convenient for shopping and dining. It is worth recommending!

The hotel has been open for a while, but it is well maintained in all aspects. The interior decoration is full of design and art, and the smell is very good.
Dyson hair dryer, smart toilet, smart speaker, whiskey bar, and independent heated swimming pool! ! ! The boss really spends a lot of money to build every room.
This time we stayed in a Harry Potter themed room, and every detail of the room was exquisite. Thank you to Brother Will for arranging fruits and children's supplies, which made us feel at home.

The breakfast fruits are good, semi-buffet style, the place is slightly small but very exquisite.
I didn‚Äôt go to drink. The afternoon tea was all buffet, not as nice as expected, but the desserts were delicious.
It is not recommended to go to the hotel gym, it is too small and there is really nothing to do except running. The gym that cooperates with the shopping mall is really good. It should be among the best in Beijing.
The facilities are very good, you can go to the shopping mall to eat, and the World Trade Center is within easy reach.
The mini bar can basically be ignored, it‚Äôs nothing.
I encountered a problem with the coffee machine, but the service was very good and it was immediately replaced.
Overall it's very good, I will visit occasionally.

The shower was so powerful that my child felt pain like pins and needles. There was glass between the bathroom and the bed and there was no curtain. It was not convenient to take a bath with the child, and the sound insulation was not good. I could hear the sounds from other rooms clearly, and I couldn't sleep well all night. I bought the New Year's set meal at the George Restaurant on the second floor after listening to the waiter's suggestion. The result was so disappointing. The food was served very slowly. The main dish, the Beef Wellington, was unpalatable. The maturity was not the same. The steak meat was like mud. Same, the response from the chef was that the part of the meat may be different. The most annoying thing is that the waiter asked us to park the car in the underground parking lot of the mall, and did not inform us that there would be a fee. When we checked out, he told us that it would stop last year. We cooperated with the mall, which resulted in us paying a small parking fee of 200 yuan. There is no hotel where parking is not free. I will not come again in the future.

msg:I checked in on a Thursday and the overall experience was very unsatisfactory.
After checking in at the hotel, I arrived at the room and found that the room was not prepared at all, including slippers and fruit plate. The floor drain of the bathtub was not pressed smoothly, causing the water that I had left for a long time to drain away. Even when my aunt came, she had to press it several times before closing it. She also pressed the fruit plate that had not been prepared for an hour.
After lying on the bed for a while, I noticed that my fingers were swollen. I suspected that the sheets were not cleaned properly, which caused my skin to react to dust mites. As an adult with such a major allergic reaction, I think children may be more sensitive.
The room phone was very quiet when I called and the front desk staff could barely hear me, making it difficult to communicate. I called the second time and tried to communicate, but the front desk clearly had the room number of the caller on display, but hung up after listening to it twice. The phone couldn't be reached. As a guest, I had to go downstairs and find the front desk myself when I needed help.
After the front desk staff hung up the phone for the second time, I had no choice but to change my clothes and go to the front desk to communicate in person. However, the manager on duty that night, Manager Wang Tony, took his time and did not help me solve the problem. He glared at me in a very condescending manner. Look at me. When I called twice, the voice was very low and I couldn't communicate normally. It was also very inconvenient to take a shower. The facilities were very old. Manager Tony Wang's reply to me was: How about we fix your phone? This is very inconsistent with the charter of a five-star hotel. If every guest who stays is served with this attitude, it is clearly the hotel's problem but he does not sincerely apologize to the guests. As a guest, I don't think such behavior is in line with the standards of this five-star hotel.
In addition, I met the hotel general manager Dany in the elevator the next morning. In a polite manner, I did not choose to complain to him directly in the elevator, but hoped to let him know through his subordinates, but the front office and defense depar**ent The manager Tony (another Tony) took the liberty of coming to deal with it when I made it clear that I wanted to talk to Dany face to face. It seemed that he was obstructing my meeting with Dany. I think these are very unprofessional behaviors.
    In the price of such an expensive hotel, I think it is not worth spending 5588 per night here.
    At the same price, you can stay in more hotels with better hardware facilities, better locations, and better services in Beijing, such as Cultural Oriental in Wangfujing, Waldorf Astoria, Aman Summer Palace in the Summer Palace, Rosewood Hotel in Guomao CBD, etc. Etc., as a guest who has stayed in almost every super five-star hotel in Beijing, I think my experience in this hotel can be said to be extremely poor. There are many other good options at the same price. This time I booked a deluxe Lanchi Suite, the price was 5588. Even I was treated like this. It‚Äôs hard to imagine how indifferent a guest in a basic room would be.
      In terms of facilities, the room is large overall, but it always feels a little unclean, and the furniture is a bit old. In addition, several major brands in the Parkview Shopping Center, IWC, supermarkets, I.T., etc. have all withdrawn their cabinets. The hotel's The service is unbelievably bad.

I forgot to take pictures, so I won‚Äôt post them here. Please book this hotel with caution, don‚Äôt spend such an expensive price and have such a bad experienceüôè

msg:A senior hotel player who likes to experience good hotels all over the country and all over the world, and came to Eclat because of its main focus on an artistic a**osphere, so I booked a hotel for my husband's birthday to experience it. I came to check in first in the afternoon. The butler service was very good, but after entering the room, I found that the air conditioner was dripping. I almost slipped when I stepped on the water. After communicating with the hotel, I changed to the next room. Fortunately, I came to the spot in advance. The birthday decorations booked in advance are balloons and a bear cake. I feel that this piece is average. Compared with high-end hotels such as Park Hyatt, the birthday decoration is lacking in detail. I booked a deluxe terrace double room. I wanted to have a drink outside on the terrace. However, on the night of check-in, I found that the terrace was very special, but there was no air conditioning. It was very hot in summer. I would sweat after staying outside for a while, and the terrace was occupied. The overall size of the room is not small, making the interior space feel cramped. The overall feeling is moderate. Due to time constraints, the afternoon tea and breakfast in the suite were not eaten, which is a pity.

msg:I felt pretty good when I came to Eclat before, so I chose to celebrate my birthday here, but this time the experience is really hard to describe. This is the first time that a five-star hotel has such a poor management and service.
I ordered a few friends to come and play in the terrace room. First of all, the hotel‚Äôs design is that there is no sound insulation between the terraces. After we were reminded by the hotel for the first time, we didn‚Äôt want to disturb the rest of the surrounding guests, so we immediately lowered the volume and talked on the terrace. All suppressed the sound. Even so, a male night manager knocked on the door at 11 o'clock and told us not to use the terrace, otherwise the neighbors would call the police because of the noise. Firstly, you didn‚Äôt ask whether we made any noise; secondly, you said to the guests who specially booked terrace rooms and paid a premium for using the terrace that you can‚Äôt use the terrace, which is very unreasonable and tough; thirdly, whether the visitor regulations you presented Specifically targeted, I can still hear people making noise around me on the terrace at one o'clock in the morning, and I haven't seen you chasing people from door to door? A certain male night shift manager insisted that all our friends leave within ten minutes, and there was no room for negotiation with our suggestion of "all of them go back indoors, and leave immediately if there are any more complaints from guests". It was half an hour before 12 o'clock, and we wanted to let our friends go after blowing out the candles, but we spent the last time arguing with the manager about it.
I don't even want to say how disappointing it is to have such a show on such a special occasion as a birthday, but we and the friends we invited were not even treated with the most basic respect and equality. Although the lady at the front desk expressed apology to us when we left the store, but after this happened, I will not come back again. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to live in Beijing for two or three thousand? I am not targeting a certain manager on duty. Since Eclat‚Äôs feature is the terrace, and the sound insulation between the terraces is not good in the design, then the hotel should think about the noise problem in advance and make a plan, instead of letting the guests bear the high price , While chasing people at the point and threatening to call the police, don't eat too ugly.

msg:I'm sorry that our employees don't wear name tags, so I don't know the name of each employee. The girl who checked me in and checked out was very, very good. The concierge was very enthusiastic, greeted me, and asked for feedback on the experience. When she knew that the room was a bit noisy, she even gave me some feedback. Give a gift to express your apology
But there is a girl who really makes me feel that she is not suitable to work at the front desk of this hotel. Her skin is very good, her makeup is very delicate, and she is young. Around 17:50, my child went to the front desk to ask about the location of breakfast and afternoon tea. The girl was talking to a guy wearing glasses. The boy spoke and glanced at my child. He ignored me and continued talking to the boy. When the boy saw me and came over, he immediately asked me, hello, do you have any questions? I felt that I didn‚Äôt want to ask any questions at the time. The girl kept looking down at the computer and didn‚Äôt look at us from beginning to end. You don‚Äôt know how to use the OPERA system and you are still learning, or you are a little self-aware and don‚Äôt dare to look at me? I am aloof and not suitable for hotel service and front desk training needs to be improved.
The room happened to have a swimming pool room upstairs where a family stayed for a swim at 11pm. They swam again at around 9am. Two children kept shouting and running around the room. The floor felt very thin and the sound was loud. The children must have been injured. Mom and Dad were crying and blaming each other. We both have children, which I can tolerate, so I didn‚Äôt go to the front desk to change rooms. The facilities in this hotel are just cosmetic projects. They look unique but are not very practical.

msg:An artistic hotel. The terrace room is the highlight. The decoration of each terrace is different, and the privacy is very good. The downside is that due to the design of the building, the terrace gets as hot as the conservatory on hot days, but at night it's fine. A few bottles of drinks were delivered from the minibar, and the smart toilet and shower equipment are the highlights. There are few types of breakfast, which is understandable considering the size of the hotel.

One small flaw is to pick up takeaway at night, because I ordered a bottle of wine after watching the game in Gongti. It‚Äôs already past ten o‚Äôclock. There should be almost no takeaway ordered by other guests at this spot. I thought I‚Äôd just pick it up in the lobby and leave. , As a result, the takeaway was received by the staff, and then it was a simple takeaway. They came in and out and asked me three times, including the room number, mobile phone number and what I ordered. It took two or three minutes to bring it out to me. I was wondering, when I checked in, I asked that it would be placed at the front desk, and then I got off the elevator in two minutes for the takeaway that was just delivered, and I had to ask for a long time to determine which one was mine? Not to mention the price, 99% of five-star hotels will not be so troublesome.

There is also an afternoon tea on the 16th floor, and my room is also very close to the 16th floor. I just want to take a drink and go back to the room. Then the waiter told me that I can‚Äôt wear hotel slippers, and I must know how to wear shoes in the room. Change it and come back. I have never seen such a requirement for "well-dressed". I am wearing a shirt and casual trousers, but I just slept in the room, and it is only a few tens of meters away from the afternoon tea. Can I walk here in slippers? Is this a domestic boarding school?

Another fly in the oin**ent is the free parking registration when checking out. There is a time limit, from 13 minutes to 1:10 after checking out. Then I wanted to buy a cup of coffee but I didn‚Äôt buy it. I took my luggage and went downstairs to b2 Then go through the shopping mall to find the correct elevator and walk to the car, get on the car, set the navigation, reply a message and drive to the exit of the parking lot, telling me that the time is over, and I have to pay two yuan? Just kidding? I have never encountered such a hotel parking reduction before.

For a non-business hotel worth 2,000 yuan a night, the guests who come to stay will definitely not be short of this money, but they will pay more attention to the details of the service. The nearby Sanlitun Intercontinental at the same price treats me like an uncle, because it is normal when they are all at this price, rather than imposing various restrictions.

The elevator behind me had a relatively narrow space, and my bag was probably blocking the door of the elevator. He could have said to let me lean in. But this front desk directly picked me up. Pretty ****ing. It is also very impatient to order a takeaway to be delivered. Name the short-haired man with glasses at the front desk. Really sucks.

But what attracts me the most is the many artworks all over the hotel, allowing guests to enjoy them without any distance. And this time the hotel also arranged a hotel art guide, which can better appreciate the essence of these contemporary arts.

The texture of the slippers is super good, very soft to step on, matching the quality of 5 stars. The bedside üî´ I researched for a long time, I don't know what to do, it was weak, and I didn't know the control of the bedside lamp until I left ‚úÖ

üåøThe terrace can fully accommodate about 4 people to drink tea and drink, which is a waste for me. I only sat for three seconds and took a photoüòÇ, I will definitely bring friends next time. I didn't have afternoon tea due to time constraints, unfortunately üòî

üåøThe restaurant is on the second floor, you need a straight ladder to go down to the first floor and take the escalator to the second floor. Semi-buffet, you can order food or take it yourself. I don't know if the epidemic is because of the epidemic. At 8:00, I was the only one who dined, and the staff were very enthusiastic.

üåøThe hotel can enter the license plate to avoid the parking fee and save nearly 100 oceans~

Love it, will come again!

Adults and big children can swim in general, but the water temperature is very good. The unsatisfactory thing, no one stayed in the Harry Potter room on Monday and still did not get the Harry Potter room. It is suspected that it was deliberately not given. The child is very disappointed. The minibar in the room is free except for alcohol products. In fact, there is nothing. I wanted to ask for another pack of potato chips and was rejected. Afternoon tea and fruits were sent, as well as some snacks, all of which were quite average and did not match the grade of the hotel. The breakfast is not a buffet, you can order it casually. The egg banquet is not bad, and the others are average. In short, it is too expensive and should not go again, just experience it once.

If there is no way to satisfy customers in terms of service, no matter how good the environment is, we will not be able to retain customers. , I think staff training needs to be strengthened. The service staff gave me a very uncomfortable feeling. They would not consider the problem carefully for the guests at all. My wife is pregnant, and the occupancy rate is not very high. Gao, the service staff will not consider these problems at all, how can we make it more convenient, and the service staff does not know how to actively greet the guests and ask about the situation, and I want to wear hotel slippers to go out of the hotel to smoke, and the service staff Stop and say "no slippers allowed in public" OMG! I've stayed in so many hotels and the "first time I heard" is really bad in this regard!
üöó Transportation: There are basically reserved parking spaces on the ground. There are only four or five parking spaces. If you need to park, you need to contact the front desk in advance. Otherwise, you need to park underground. The reason for being in the mall, the only good thing is that I got lost when I parked in the garage, and there was a service person who made us wait to come and pick us up in person, which is still very good, I remember it was a lady, I forgot to leave the name span
üßπHygiene: It's ok if it's hygienic, there is basically no dust. I think it's ok for the cleaning staff. The staff who cleans the room will take the initiative to say hello when they see the guests, which is very good
üçÉEnvironment: I have to say that the boss is still very tasteful. I like these artworks he collected very much. He can indeed take a lot of good photos. He has also put a lot of effort into it.

msg:The second time I stayed here, I really have nothing to say about art. I looked at the 16-20 floors carefully. In addition to the regular art display, there are sculptures or paintings in every corner of the hotel, and the overall artistic a**osphere is particularly strong. It's not the kind that has only the key points but no details, and Mr. Huang's distinctive collection style can be seen; the balcony of the suite is very comfortable and unique for a party and a micro vacation. The service is within the normal range. It is worth mentioning that the waiters in the restaurant are particularly warm and polite, and the PA/FO nicole is also very good; saying that the service is normal is that I met passing by in the corridor of the guest room and ignored and did not greet us in a suit when there were no other guests. The uniforms look like management boys. The art and facilities of the hotel are particularly outstanding and value for money, but the service and food products are indeed somewhat incomplete, and the desserts/breakfasts are generally more semi-finished. If I come to Beijing for art, I will come to live there. If the service and meals can continue to be strengthened into a complete system, I believe the price and occupancy rate will be higher.

üöó Transportation: It is very convenient, just in the Parkview Green Shopping Center, very close to Sanlitun, World Trade Center and China World Trade Center, where you can eat, drink and play~
üçÉEnvironment: There are many artworks and paintings in the hotel, and each floor is different. If you take a picture, it will be very popular~ The Lan Chi suite ordered this time has a large area, and I like the interior and exterior design very much~
üßπHygienic: Every day there will be an aunt who cleans it carefully. After living for three days, she will also provide different snacks every day, including blueberry tarts, coconut balls and Chinese pastries~
üîîService: The little brothers and sisters at the front desk are very enthusiastic, knowing that I am celebrating my birthday, they gave champagne and cakes, and a set of toiletry set as a gift when I checked out~

Finally, I would like to say a few points for improvement:
The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is semi-buffet, the √† la carte meals are well done, and the dandan noodles are delicious~ but there are very few choices in the buffet part. For such a high-end hotel, you can have more choices.
The use of bathroom equipment in the guest room can be specifically introduced to guests. The shower has no cubicles and is open. The shower is a push button switch. There are three types. One is flushing. If you accidentally press it on, the water sprays out horizontally. It hits the sink mirror and gets a lot of water. The marble floor is easy to slip. , I have to wipe it myself, I don‚Äôt feel very good.
Many guests book the hotel suites for parties. Although there are barriers outdoors, after all, the sound of the surrounding rooms can be heard in the open air. The hotel will ask guests who do not stay overnight to leave before 11 pm, but when I checked in, there was a room that was hi until 3 am. I could hear the sound of "Drink! Drink! Drink!" in the room, which affected my sleep. , I hope the hotel can strengthen management.

The location is very good, because it is the hotel in Parkview Green, it is very convenient for shopping and travel.

service:
The front desk service is not bad, but there is no doorman and no one helps to carry the boxes.

Room view:
There is a large terrace, which is very beautiful, and it has its own swimming pool. The temperature is OK and quite comfortable, but it is a bit hot outside, but daylighting is a problem.

parking:
Parkview Green Park parking lot üÖøÔ∏è, parking is fairly convenient.

health:
The sanitation is good enough, the cheap floor tiles feel dirty, and there are southern cockroaches in the room, which is terrible.

Room facilities:
The living room is very large, with a four-seater dining table, and the leather sofa is quite comfortable. The cheapest Chunyue was delivered, which was too low to accept. The bathroom was facing the toilet, and there was a bat in a cage above it. The sculptures here are too scary. What is particularly funny is that there is a urinal in the toilet... The bathtub is electric, which is quite magical; Dyson hair dryer, TOTO electric toilet, the overall configuration is fair.

wifi:
The Wi-Fi link is quite troublesome, but the internet speed is OK.

bed:
The soft princess bed is comfortable to lie down, but it will be tiring to sleep.

swimming pool:
The hotel does not have a swimming pool, only in the room, which is not too big and can only be used for fun, and the water temperature is reasonable.

breakfast:
Semi-buffet style, not many things, not many dishes to order, not big quantity, good taste, you can eat until 11 o'clock, and then continue afternoon tea in the afternoonü´ñ.

Cost performance:
There are more than 6,000 hotels in one night. This kind of service and facilities is really not flattering. It really feels like nothing else except the slow art and the breath of RMB. I booked it for two nights this time. It‚Äôs impossible. Choose to stay again.

Let's rectify and reflect on the hotel's kitchen hygiene and the depar**ent manager's ability to handle problems! As a five-star hotel, the health and service are really worrying!

Unspeakable uncomfortable ~ Service training may not be in place, not meticulous, and the front desk staff have a sense of arrogance and superiority that they don‚Äôt know where they come from.

As far as service is concerned, it is far inferior to Atour~Qiuguo hotels, which requires deep thinking by managers

If parents do not pay special attention, children are easy to touch with their hands, whether it is to damage the exhibits or bruise the children is not appropriate. But the hotel‚Äôs welcoming macaron kids liked it very much and it was delicious! If you are a couple or older children, staying here is still very good and unique!

I will definitely go there again, and I think the number of hotels I want to introduce to my friends has increased. Thank you so much.

Don't eat breakfast in the hotel, basically there is nothing. But the worst part is that you must never drive there! Because the parking space at the door does not allow you to park, if you stop, the security will not let you get off! You have to stay in the car like a Didi driver. The security guards are basically bludgeoning to stop you! You ask the staff of the hotel, they are as if it is okay, tell you, just move a position. As for the handling of apologies, there must be none! You said that your hotel has been opened to Fangcaoyuan, the service is so poor, don't you feel bad about it! This service is especially suitable for small hotels in Hutong! Few reviews! But this hotel! Give extremely bad reviews! If you don't believe me, drive and try it!

msg:Don't live, it's very bad. It's a one-off deal. The hotel toiletries are on an ad hoc period. The moisturizer expired on September 15th. Is such a high-priced hotel so economical? The waiter didn‚Äôt know the exact location of the house, and took me around twice to find it. It‚Äôs obviously not far from the elevator, but I went around to the inside. I saw that the room number was wrong and then turned to look for you. As soon as I got out of the elevator, the carpet in the corridor was black, smelly and tattered. The old tangy smell of musty, the so-called free afternoon tea taste and hygiene are really not flattering, like the desserts at the small stalls in the vegetable market, does the hotel want to be nostalgic and sweet? The hotel does not have an independent hotel entrance. It is from the shopping mall to the hotel. The staff is noisy, and the hotel attendants don‚Äôt laugh with zombie faces. They are not only enthusiastic but also pretend to be superior and narcissistic. Obviously there is a parking space at the door, and parking is not allowed, but the 18th bend of the ba*****t mountain road is not allowed, which is very inconvenient. In short, the experience is very poor, don't believe the recommendation of Xiaohongshu.

msg:I often go to Fangcaoyuan to eat and drink. I stumbled upon this hotel and thought about the opportunity to live in. I saw the introduction of various artworks. The design is also relatively new, so I went, and it was thundered. I have a few comments. There is no problem with the room facilities. There is a hotel-exclusive pad at the bedside. I want to order something at the hotel later when I come back. The front desk tells the pad to order directly. As a result, the pad was broken after a long operation. . I can only order the food from the public comment. I ordered two kinds of takeaways. After the takeaways were delivered to the front desk, I called me to go down and get them. When I arrived at the front desk, I only gave me one item. I thought the other one hadn't been delivered yet, so I called the takeaway guy. , Told me that I had handed it over to the hotel staff, and then I went to the front desk to ask, and the front desk went to look for it again. This second item was given to me, saying that there were too many people ordering takeout, and I didn't find it for the first time. I!
The next morning, I woke up and went to the hotel‚Äôs supporting restaurant for breakfast. There were a lot of people, understandable. After I sat down, I ordered two cups of iced coffee. There are too many people, I can understand, as the service of a so-called high-end hotel? ? ? When I checked out, I pulled the data cable in the room. I called the front desk to find it and sent it to me by express delivery. Later, the courier called me. When it comes to the hotel asking who placed the order, all the staff said they didn‚Äôt know, and no one helped to ask. Later, I contacted the hotel front desk and found it after searching. I was convinced that the front desk handover was not informed. Is there anything a staff member needs to pay attention to? Can't all the front desk staff ask each other without knowing it? This hotel is really nothing new. no more chance.

The entire lobby of the hotel is filled with various works of art
There are more than ten rooms in the hotel with terraces and private pools
and each theme is different
I've heard about his pool suite
Just in time for a friend's birthday, I booked a room
I didn't expect the kid to have a fever
can't swim
The child is depressed
The water gun I brought can only be played outside
The room I selected before is gone
The last old student club
The hotel sent fruit cake and red wine
The overall environment is good
But the facilities are relatively old
There's no one left for a deposit of 20,000
Jessica, who has been in touch with the hotel to make reservations, is very enthusiastic
excellent service
If you need anything, just talk to her.
Overall, it is quite good
It is still worth living with children in the future
