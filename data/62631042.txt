msg:The location is good. The service from the front desk and other members is good in general. 
But I feel that this hotel is overrated on trip.com. It's probably just because of the great location and view! I requested a non-smoking room. The front desk confirmed my request on the booking during check-in, but I could smell smoke throughout my entire stay, even with the window open. Trip.com indicates that the hotel opened in 2020, but the decoration and hardware already look old! The room is big, though. While the food selection at the breakfast buffet was good, the quality was below average. Don't be fooled by the afternoon tea. I cannot believe the coffee a 5-star hotel restaurant served was from instant coffee power! I end up getting one from a nice coffee shop next to the hotel. There are many better hotel options in that area unless the only thing you care about is the view of the river and Canton Tower!

But for international travellers it would be quite hard to contact guest service due to language barrier, most of the staff isn't fluent in english so it's probably better to learn a bit of mandarin so you can get the things or requests you need! Overall a very good hotel!

Breakfast was pretty mid. Beware if youre sensitive to cigarette smells. We were at the non-smoking level, but there was still a strong cigarette scent. We changed rooms twice, but the one we ended up in still had a faint smell. But other than that, the rooms were quite clean and spacious. They also have dyson supersonics, which is pretty cool.

msg:I recently stayed at a high-end hotel in the city center. This time I booked a deluxe bay view king room, thinking it was for seeing the slim waist. Fortunately, I met Miss Mary at the front desk and told me that the room type was wrong. Later, she helped me change the room type and stayed in a deluxe river view king room. This is quite considerate; overall, my experience was very pleasant. Here are my comments on this hotel. First of all, the location of the hotel is very ideal. It is located in a busy area in the city center, just a few minutes away from major attractions and shopping malls. This location is very convenient for me to travel, and there are many restaurants and cafes nearby to choose from, so I can taste a variety of food. Afternoon tea and supper are free when checking in. They are all self-service, and the breakfast variety is also rich. Free parking; it is only 10 minutes away from the subway station, the nearest is Liede Exit B, and there is a Tianhui Plaza nearby for shopping. Secondly, the hotel facilities are very complete. The room is spacious and bright, and the furniture is well organized. The bed is comfortable and soft, providing me with a good sleeping environment. In addition, the room is equipped with a large LCD TV and free high-speed wireless network, so I can enjoy the fun of TV and Internet in the room. The bathroom facilities were also great, with plenty of shower water and good quality toiletries. In addition, the hotel's service quality was first-rate. The front desk and customer service staff were very warm and friendly, always greeting guests with a smile. They were able to give detailed answers to all my questions and tried their best to meet my needs. The staff was also very efficient and quick during check-in and check-out. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of services such as self-service laundry and luggage storage, which made my trip more convenient. Of course, the price of the hotel is relatively high. As a high-end hotel, it is natural to invest in quality and service, so it is understandable that the price is high. But compared to other hotels, I think this price is good value for money. Overall, I rate this hotel very highly. Its location, facilities and services are excellent, which brought me a very satisfactory stay. Although the price is high, I think this price is good value for money. Next time I come to this city, I will definitely choose this hotel again.

The deluxe river view room is five-star recommended. It is on the 38th floor facing the Xiaomanyao and Liede Bridge, and the view is first-class. The food is very good, and the afternoon tea, midnight snack, and breakfast are all very rich.

msg:I had been selecting suitable hotels before staying in the hotel. After arriving in Guangzhou, I wanted to choose a Four Seasons or something. But I didn't expect to find this elegant hotel. I also investigated on various softwares that this hotel is a new Internet celebrity hotel and there are many room types that can be photographed. After booking. I was really tired when I arrived at the hotel. After entering the hotel, I felt that the design style was very fashionable and attractive, and there were artificial intelligence robots. It was so interesting! I was full of expectations and prepared to check in. Then I went up to the 28th floor to check in. As soon as I got off the elevator, I heard a lady enthusiastically say good afternoon, welcome home, you have had a hard journey. This sentence is really not heard from any five-star hotel except this elegant hotel. Such heartwarming words make people have a good and warm overall impression and feeling. When I started to check in, there were really a lot of people in the lobby and it was very crowded, but I didn't expect that in this situation, someone would come to take care of my feelings, because it was really crowded at the time, and they came over to greet my needs. Then they kept chatting with me and told me all the value-added services and some basic information of the hotel. They were very comprehensive and afraid that I couldn't remember them, so they added WeChat and gave me detailed information. On the second night of my stay, because my wife and I didn't eat, and the child was too tired to fall asleep, it was inconvenient to go out to eat with the child in my arms. But it happened to be a holiday and I wanted to have a drink with my wife. I asked Xiao Zheng if he could help look after the child, and Xiao Zheng quickly replied that he could. It was really great. We could have an hour, but something delayed the time. I didn't expect Xiao Zheng's housekeeper to work overtime to help look after the child. I really thank Xiao Zheng. My family and I were moved. I felt the warmth in this hotel and the dedication of Xiao Zheng, the customer service housekeeper. I didn't expect that there was this service in the hotel. This trip was very touching and brought me the warmth of home. I will stay in this hotel next time. The staff are very considerate. I would also recommend the location and scenery of the hotel. The hotel decoration is very modern, the room lighting is very warm, charging is very convenient, there are sockets at the head of the bed and the sofa, and there are several kinds of drinks in the refrigerator are free. The room is very clean, the pillow is a latex pillow, which is super comfortable, and the quilt is also clean and comfortable to cover. The Canton Tower is right in the middle of the room. It is probably the best hotel in the busiest area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuangzhou. The whole hotel is brightly lit and worth staying in.

I listened to the advice and didn't stand at the foot of the Guangzhou Tower to see the scenery.
I chose the elegant hotel on the other side of the riverüè®
The river view is amazing!!!
The large glass window, sitting by the window, you can see the "Liede Bridge" and "Guangzhou Tower" and the boats cruising the Pearl River at night.

The room is about 40 square meters, with a reasonable layout, a cloakroom, and regular toiletries are all from L'Occitane. In addition, they also thoughtfully prepared lotion, makeup remover, facial cleanser and perfume for the ladyüë©üèª‚ù§Ô∏è

The small bar in the room has a coffee machine, refrigerator, drinks and teaüçª
It is especially suitable for a day of shopping, and returning to the room to quietly enjoy the river view.

It is located in a bustling area, but the high floor is very soundproof, and the automatic curtains also block light, so you can sleep well.

The service staff are very considerate, and the receptionist Xiao Zheng has good service. If you bring children to check in, the robot will also send children's products [candy]

In short, it is a great stay experience [amazing]

It rained heavily that day, and the concierge even gave us an umbrella in the rain! It was so touching. She is a beautiful and kind person! The service attitude was very good, the room was very clean, and the view was very good. You can see the Guangzhou Tower directly. In general, it is a good hotel. I will choose it again next time I come to Guangzhou! (I forgot the name of the concierge, but you are really beautiful!)

msg:I have to say that the service at the Yazhi Hotel is excellent. This is my first time staying here. The hotel is conveniently located and close to shopping malls for dining and shopping. The service staff here are very friendly. I booked a city view room for three nights, and the staff gave me a different feeling. They were all in good spirits and had sincere smiles. I went drinking with friends on the first night. I was a little drunk when I came back and I had blackouts. When I woke up the next day, I found that my cell phone was missing, and my ID and other documents were also in the phone. I was confused at the time. After I came to the front desk, I was going to go to the police station to get a temporary ID and then buy a new cell phone and replace the phone card. I thought my phone must have been left at the bar and might not be found. After informing the waiter, I asked her to help me contact the bar where I drank that night. I looked for the phone number on the **, but it was not open yet and no one answered the phone. I called four or five times in a row and was almost desperate. It was the first time I experienced what it was like without a cell phone and friends around me, and I didn't have any cash on me. The front desk receptionist Fenfen told me not to worry and offered to lend me her cell phone. With her help, I contacted my mother, and then logged into WeChat with her phone. My family assisted in the WeChat friend verification login, so I immediately made a WeChat voice call to the bar girl who sent me back yesterday. She said she clearly remembered that I had the phone in my hand when I went back, but I couldn't find it when I searched the room in the morning. , I was about to buy a new phone. Fenfen told me that she would help me check the surveillance video of my return that night to find out the time I returned to the room. After waiting for five minutes, the surveillance results showed that I really took the phone back to the room. Fenfen patiently told me not to worry and accompanied me to the room to check together. After helping to look for it, Fenfen found that it had really fallen under the sink. It took more than 40 minutes to deal with it up and down. In short, I am very grateful to the hotel staff this time. I advise everyone to pay attention to their mobile phones when drinking, otherwise it will be really troublesome if it is lost. I feel like I have taken a lesson on a business trip, especially when I am alone outside. Thanks to the receptionist Fenfen for patiently analyzing how to deal with it for me, and give a thumbs up to the elegant staff. I will choose this place again if I have the chance. In short, I am very moved. This time I left with gratitude. All the staff are very sincere. I don‚Äôt have to worry about safety issues when I go out on a business trip alone. It feels like I am back home. This wave of safe, secure and warm service must be praised with five stars!

msg:I plan to travel to Guangzhou recently. After a long time of selection, I finally found a hotel that suits my taste!
The hotel is located in the prosperous Zhujiang New Town. It overlooks Liede Bridge, Pazhou Tower, and Convention and Exhibition Center in the east, and Guangzhou Tower and Haixinsand in the southwest. There are all kinds of restaurants and entertainment venues nearby, and it brings together various cross-border Internet celebrity stores for "eating, drinking, playing, and having fun". The location is very convenient. The No. 1 nightclub in Asia is right next to it.
As soon as I entered the first floor, a handsome concierge brother immediately ran over to help with luggage and consult about pressing the elevator. The service was thoughtful! When I checked in at the sky lobby on the 28th floor, the customer service butler also ran over to receive and help with luggage. The front desk staff handled it quite quickly. I checked in because of the night view, so I had said in advance that I wanted a room on a high floor. After checking in, the customer service butler Xiao Qiu helped to carry the luggage to the room. He was considerate and attentive, and also introduced the facilities in the room. The mini bar in the room has 4 kinds of drinks, tea sets and tea leaves for tea, capsule coffee, etc. These are all free to use and drink. The hotel also thoughtfully prepared makeup removal and skin care products for free use, which is very thoughtful. The hotel also gave away morning and afternoon tea and midnight snacks. You can enjoy morning and afternoon tea and midnight snacks by registering your room number. There are simple desserts, pastries, coffee, etc., and the midnight snack is simple porridge, noodles, and hot dishes.
The elegant river view room is really good for taking pictures. As soon as you open the door, the viewing floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, the automatic curtains are opened, and the city scenery and the small waist are unobstructed. And when I chose the hotel, their Internet celebrity bathtub pictures were also super beautiful. The large bathtub is equipped with a panoramic floor-to-ceiling glass window, which washes away the fatigue of the day, lies on the bed and watches the hustle and bustle of the city, and feels the unique tranquility. It really, super love! Whether it is day or night, the river view is super beautiful, and the photos are super good! If you have requirements for the environment, you must choose a high floor, where you can overlook the entire night view of the Pearl River. This time it was a parent-child tour. The customer service butler Xiao Qiu saw that we brought children and gave us children's toiletries. In the evening, he also gave us good night milk, facial masks, and children's toys. The service is really thoughtful.
I have to say that the hotel price is really affordable! You can stay in a five-star hotel at the price of an ordinary B&B! As a five-star hotel, although it is a domestic brand, its standard is not inferior to international five-star hotels! As patriots, we absolutely support this domestic brand! The price-performance ratio is super high! 
Promise me! Whether it is a business trip, a family trip, a gathering with friends, a girlfriend, or a romantic couple, you must come and experience it!

msg:I took my elderly to Guangzhou during the Labor Day holiday. Since it was just a leisure trip, I chose a hotel in the city. Guangzhou Yazhi Hotel is in a moderate location, opposite the APM line, and the ground green coverage rate is also high, which is very suitable for the elderly to walk. It is also convenient to eat nearby, especially the food street next to the hotel, with Cantonese, Hunan, French and Italian food. The hotel gym is also OK. Although the facilities are a little less, it is also fully equipped, and you can exercise in any position you need. Check in and check out are also very fast. I landed late that day and booked the hotel in a hurry. I actually received a call from the hotel. It happened that I found that the bed type was wrong. I asked if I could change it to a big bed, and they promised to help me coordinate.
When I arrived at the hotel in the evening, they really helped me change it to a big bed. Here I have to thank the Bubble Butler who visited the phone. I thought it was a routine call at first, but I didn‚Äôt know that it was really doing something. Style I like the lobby is very high, on the 28th floor sky lobby, together with the lobby bar for afternoon tea. The food for afternoon tea is also very delicious, the cakes are moderately sweet, and coffee and tea are all available. The half-checked front desk staff are very stylish. The concierge downstairs is also very tall and handsome. As soon as you enter the hotel, he immediately asks if you have made a reservation. He carries your luggage to the 28th floor. Even the cleaning lady on the road will greet you kindly. The room is fully automatic, and the toilet curtains are all automatic. You don't need to insert a card to get electricity. Every day, the bed is made very comfortable. The fragrance in the corridor is good, high-end and elegant. The breakfast buffet tastes great. I love this buffet breakfast. A cup of pure American coffee, with crispy bacon, yogurt and organic oa**eal is very clever. I go to the gym to exercise after work. The little brother here is very shy and honest.
During my stay, if I caught a cold, the Bubble Butler would ask me what was wrong with me, and prepare cold medicine and brown sugar ginger tea, and bring them to the door of my room. If I stayed for several days, the child would also tell me that there was a self-service laundry room on the 35th floor, and I could take clothes there to change and wash if needed, and there would be an aunt to collect them for me. When I needed to send a courier, the child would also help me take it down to the first floor to send it. The most impressive thing was that I wanted to send stamps, but there was no postage downstairs, and the child would also help me collect it and take it to the post office to send it. With a good butler, every detail can really touch your heart, and I will still choose this place next time I come.

msg:I have been to Guangzhou many times, but this is my first time staying at the Elegant Hotel. The sky lobby for check-in is on the 28th floor. When I got off the car, the concierge brother enthusiastically helped me to carry my luggage. Free mineral water was provided as soon as I entered the 28th floor. There were also many emergency and seasonal small medicines in the lobby on the 28th floor, such as 999 cold medicine, Weitai Isatis root, etc., which gave people a particularly warm feeling. The hotel decoration style is unique. When checking in, since Fenfen at the front desk learned that we were here for tourism, she took the initiative to add WeChat when checking in, and also sent me a map of Guangzhou with surrounding food recommendations and scenic route recommendations. It was very thoughtful. I brought my big baby with me this time. When I just checked into the room, it was a bit stuffy and a bit cold. I was worried that the child would catch a cold. After telling her, Xiaofen immediately came to the room to help me open the window of the room and adjust the air conditioner to ventilation mode. I was really satisfied with her service. To be honest, the plane journey was a bit tiring. Fenfen arranged to give us seasonal fruits and a small car for the child. The child immediately behaved well and played with the car in his arms, and loved it very much. Fenfen always responded quickly, which made me feel at ease. Because we heard that Guangzhou's Chimelong Safari Park is a must-visit place for every child, we arranged to take the children to play the next day. We forgot that the room we booked for the next day was different, and we took the children out early in the morning. At noon, she took the initiative to send me a message to ask me when it would be convenient to arrange a room change. I could only ask her to help change the room and pull the luggage to the new room. The things in the room were in a mess and had not been cleaned up. I was a little worried about missing items. I didn't expect that she would take a video for us after she cleaned up and moved to the new room to confirm whether there were any clothes or items missing. After Fenfen learned that it was the child's birthday, she also decorated balloons and birthday cards after changing rooms. The children loved it very much. This point must be said to be very worthy of praise. It has been raining in Guangzhou these days. The children are always jumping around. Because they caught a cold from the wind, they sneezed a few times on the way back to the hotel, and it seems that the children have a fever. After Fenfen learned about it, she arranged for the guest room to send us a thermometer and fever-reducing patch as soon as we returned. After the child came back, he had a poor appetite and didn't eat. Fenfen had already gone off work, but she was very attentive and responsible, and arranged for the housekeeper to deliver white porridge and sugar water. It is worth learning from such warm service when staying in the hotel. Fortunately, the child was fine the next day, and he was still jumping around and said he wanted to go on a night cruise on the Pearl River and take a boat trip. I had never been there before and didn't know how to buy tickets. The statements I saw on the Internet were different. I consulted Fenfen again, and she patiently helped us point the way to the Haixinsha Pier, and also introduced us to what fun and delicious food there was nearby, such as Guangzhou Restaurant Bingsheng... etc. It was also because of their guidance that we quickly bought tickets for the Pearl River Night Cruise. Fenfen said that she had been to the Pearl River Night Cruise, and it was windy at night, so she suggested that we bring a thin jacket for the child. I didn't think it was necessary at first, but later I thought it was safer to bring one. Fortunately, I brought it. The wind was still strong by the river at night, and the children had a lot of fun. After they came back, they arranged for the guest room to send a foot bath bucket. The children were reluctant to leave after checking out. If I have the opportunity to come to Guangzhou next time, I must choose the Yazhi Hotel. Although it is not a five-star hotel, the service can meet such a super five-star service standard. It is really worth my time to write this review. Yazhi is worthy of its name. It is a hotel with warm service and beautiful scenery. Recommended for luxury super five-star hotels!

msg:I am quite satisfied with this stay. The location is very good, facing the Guangzhou Tower and on the riverside. You can see the Guangzhou Tower and Zhujiang New Town from the lobby room window. The environment is super good, surrounded by the river on three sides. At first glance, it has a sense of vacation in Chiang Mai, and it is also somewhat similar to the Murray Hotel in Hong Kong. The island is lush with green trees and there are many birds, which gives a sense of vacation. The room is very new (probably because it is newly opened). I prefer to live in their deluxe river view room. The deluxe river view room has a large bathtub, and the guest room will also be very considerate to prepare a disposable bathtub cover, which I think is very friendly to people with mysophobia. I could feel the service attitude of their housekeepers even before I checked in, especially the little boy in the customer service depar**ent. I contacted them in advance to see if I needed to be picked up. There were special requirements for check-in. When I checked in, I could enter the room directly with my ID registration number. Then the concierge brother helped us carry our luggage along the way. The concierge brothers were all very handsome. The brother at the front desk also helped the children with grape juice and small towels to wipe their hands, and sent welcome fruits to the room. He also sent me food, drink and entertainment guides during my stay. At night, he also asked about the quality of sleep, and provided a nighttime bed service to create a night a**osphere, and sent milk and facial masks. Everything was done very carefully and considerately... When I checked out, the flight was delayed, and the little housekeeper was also very nice to help delay the check-out. There were services everywhere, and the hotel was super beautiful and very photogenic. Every shot was a blockbuster. The room was also large. The deluxe river view room was about 60 square meters, which was the hotel's internet celebrity room type. Many internet celebrities would come here to check in. It can be said that it was super cost-effective in this location! The buffet of this hotel is said to be one of the best in the buffet industry. I tried it specially. There are as many as 200 varieties of buffet, including lobsters, salmon, and seafood that can be caught by yourself. The boss is really generous. I really want to ask, is it opened by a rich man in Liede? Haha! I stayed in many hotels in Guangzhou before, big and small, all five-star hotels, and I feel that this one is the best, and the service is really extreme. How to say it? The renovation of Guangzhou's old city is really the ceiling of the world. Although it is a renovation project, it is not old at all. If Zhujiang New Town is the commercial ceiling, Liede belongs to the ceiling of the ceiling in the renovation of urban villages. Finally, I want to say that those big-name hotels that have been open for many years need to have a sense of crisis, otherwise they will be swept to death. Try to catch up with the elegant hotel!

msg:The hotel is located in the prosperous location of Zhujiang New Town, with convenient transportation. It is a very good choice whether it is to watch the city view or the river view. This hotel opened in 2020 and is relatively new compared to other hotels. The surroundings are quite convenient, and there are many morning tea or authentic food nearby, such as: Bingsheng Taste, Guangzhou Restaurant and other specialties. It is also relatively close to the "Little Waist" Pearl River Night Cruise Wharf, a landmark attraction in Guangzhou. This time I came to Guangzhou on a business trip and chose to stay in this hotel. Because there were a lot of people during the Canton Fair, there were many people at the front desk, and it was the customer service Xiao Li who received the check-in. When checking in at the front desk, I was also very enthusiastic to introduce the hotel's dining time and location. The hotel is also equipped with a gym and a self-service laundry room. Afternoon tea and supper will also be given upon check-in. Afternoon tea is some simple Western-style cakes, fruits, drinks, etc. It is also convenient to talk to friends about something. If you are hungry at night, you can also go to the 4th floor for supper. There are porridge noodles and some hot dishes. They are all self-service choices and taste very good. There is also a minibar in the room, drinks and tea can be made, all of which can be enjoyed for free. The most convenient thing is that you don't need to insert a card to get electricity in the room. It uses smart induction, so you don't have to worry about putting the card back after going out for a day. A superior geographical location often means that there are abundant commercial facilities and living facilities around the hotel. Shopping malls, restaurants, entertainment venues, etc. are all available to meet the diverse needs of guests. In such an environment, guests can enjoy a convenient shopping experience, taste authentic food and delicacies, and enjoy leisure and entertainment time. This all-round life experience makes the guests' stay more colorful. Beautiful scenery: Many hotels are located in scenic spots or have unique city views. In such a geographical location, guests can enjoy the charming city scenery in the room, or open the curtains when they wake up in the morning to welcome the first ray of sunshine. If you have any questions during your stay, you can directly contact the housekeeper Xiao Li, including travel guides near the hotel. It happened to be during the Canton Fair to attend the exhibition. The hotel also has shuttle buses, which are really convenient. There are 2 buses for both ways, and there are many snacks and drinks on the bus. The staff are all polite and answer any questions. In terms of security, the hotel also did an excellent job. From check-in to check-out, every link is strictly controlled to ensure the safety of every guest. The hotel's monitoring system covers every corner, and security personnel patrol 24 hours a day, allowing me to spend a safe and secure journey here. The hotel's service quality is also a highlight of my stay. From check-in to check-out, every employee is smiling and providing me with warm and thoughtful help. Whether it is asking for information about attractions, booking a taxi, or solving small problems in daily life, they can answer me quickly and accurately, making me feel the meticulous care.

msg:Guangzhou Yazhi Hotel is located in Zhujiang New Town CBD, which is the downtown area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuangzhou. It is very convenient to go anywhere. There are many delicious food choices nearby. There is a food street downstairs, IGC Tianhui Plaza, OLE supermarket on the second floor, etc. It is very close to the bus and subway, a few hundred meters away. I learned that it is a newly opened hotel in 20 years. The decoration style is very young, fashionable and full of vitality. From the lobby to the guest room, every corner exudes a sense of modernity, in accordance with the standards of five-star hotels.
The room layout is reasonable, and you will not feel depressed even if you stay for a long time. Hygiene: The overall hygiene is good and clean. There are no obvious hygiene problems. There is comfort, but the details need to be strengthened. There is no problem with the bedding. If you think the pillow is too soft, you can also ask the guest room to change to buckwheat pillows, latex pillows, wormwood pillows, flat head pillows, etc. The toilet and shower room are separated, and the dry and wet separation is in place, meeting the needs of simultaneous use. The free-flowing minibar in the room has four kinds of drinks to drink at will, and the skin care products on the dressing table can be used at will. There is also a three-head charging cable at the head of the bed in a small cloth bag. Such small details feel very considerate.
The hotel's service is in place, and the attitude is friendly. The concierge downstairs will also help to carry the luggage. During the stay, I added the WeChat of Xiao Jing, the housekeeper. Knowing that there are elderly people staying in the hotel, they also thoughtfully arranged foot washing buckets and medicine bags. At that time, I was really tired when I came to the hotel. Xiao Jing, the housekeeper, was very attentive. Then the cleaning of the extension can also be arranged in time. When leaving the hotel, they will care about the stay experience. During the stay, the children covered the quilt and felt that the quilt was too thick and too hot. Unfortunately, there was no thin quilt. Xiao Jing, the housekeeper, was very considerate and sent good night milk to the children and sent facial masks to me and my wife. Hahaha, the preparations before going to bed were arranged very well. It's really as comfortable as at home. My child's school documents need to be printed out and need parents' signatures. Xiao Jing can reply in time at night and print the documents and send them to the room.
The hotel's service is really good.
In general, the price-performance ratio is good, and the facilities are also complete. There are spas, self-cultivation halls, gyms, Chinese restaurants, etc. on the 28th floor, and self-service laundry rooms on the 35th floor. Except for the lack of a swimming pool, everything else is good. I will consider it next time.

msg:Before Labor Day, I took my parents and children to visit Yangcheng and stayed at the Guangzhou Yazhi Hotel. Since the hotel opened in 2019, except for the normal wear and tear of the guest rooms and other renovations, basically all the layouts and furnishings have been maintained for 4 years; in the Linjiang Pavilion on the 4th floor We had breakfast in the restaurant, breakfast is from 7:00-10:00, afternoon tea is from 11:00-18:00, we had dinner in the Chinese restaurant, supper is from 11:00-02:00 in the evening, the taste is also very good, really It‚Äôs really nice to have enough control! I chose to stay in a river view room this time, and my children danced with joy; the customer service butler Pao Pao introduced many of the hotel's facilities, as well as nearby attractions to visit. Generally, hotels cycle every five years, and Yazhi Hotel is also very well maintained. The facilities and equipment are kept quite new. The hair dryers are all from Dyson, and even the toiletries are from L'Occitane. This boss must be extremely rich! The carpet in the corridor room is made of wool, the round marble table is made of very simple wood, giving people a cozy feeling. The room has several styles, dynamic, simple, and business. My favorite is the business style. It may have dark spots, but the saturated colors give a sense of security. My parents usually rarely take photos, but I didn‚Äôt expect that they took all kinds of photos this time. I couldn‚Äôt stop. It was a change from my usual style of staying in a hotel. The last thing that surprised me was the built-in gym. Looking down, I saw Liede Village. As well as the scenery of Zhujiang New Town, I was very impressed. There is also a hotel with 387 rooms, and the service staff provides various attentive services, whether it is the restaurant, the front desk, or the operator, it is really good service that makes people more willing to come back. The location of the hotel is also unbeatable. There is a food street just outside the door. You can check in at various Internet celebrity shops. It can be described as a scenic spot. There are many milk tea shops and coffee shops downstairs. The subway station is the famous Liede. , the very famous Canton Tower, Pearl River Night Tour, and Haixinsha are all nearby. It is really convenient to travel. Whether you are bringing the elderly or children, it can be said that you can do it with ease. It is worthy of the title of hotel benchmark! Paopao also gives away free gifts. I brought fruits to the room, helped deliver the luggage to the room, and also interacted with the children. Seeing the happy smiles of the children made me feel a sense of warmth after coming from afar. I think the trust is probably nothing more than this. This praise must be given Check out the customer service butler at Guangzhou Yazhi Hotel. I will stay here again next time I come to Guangzhou!

The sound insulation effect is very poor. There is a bar in the next building. I can feel the vibration when I lie in bed in the middle of the night. I can also hear the bar. There is music and the sound of shouting, and there are very few things for afternoon tea. Anyway, apart from being able to see the small waist, it is really not worth it.

msg:I learned online that the hotel was opened in recent years. The decoration style is very good. It feels fashionable and grand as soon as you enter. The sky lobby is on the 28th floor. The front desk and butler are polite and the check-in is very fast.
The hotel's internal facilities are very complete, whether it is a gym, VIP room, morning and afternoon tea, self-service laundry room, Chinese restaurant, etc., the only shortcoming may be that there is no swimming pool. There is also a small children's playground next to the gym, where children can have simple fun. It's really user-friendly. As soon as I enter the room and open the door, I can turn on the electricity and open the windows. There is no need to insert a card to get electricity in the room. It feels very smart. The room is hygienic and the seats are good. The bed is very soft and comfortable, and I can feel stable when I lie down. When you fall asleep, it feels like home. There is plenty of light during the day, the window glass is transparent, and the lighting is okay. If you are traveling for many days, there is a self-service laundry room on the 35th floor. You don‚Äôt have to worry about dirty clothes if you stay for many days. It has an integrated washing and drying function. For special clothes, the waiter can also help with dry cleaning. It fully considers the needs of the guests and is very user-friendly. .
I enjoyed afternoon tea in the lobby bar on the 28th floor here. Although the taste of the snacks is not the best, it is also very interesting to take photos and check in here. In addition, you can not only taste it but also enjoy the first-line scenery of the river, which is a great experience. It's okay, I feel like home here anyway. The customer service housekeeper Xiaojing was also very considerate and considerate. Because I came back late during my stay, I explained the situation to housekeeper Xiaojing and thoughtfully extended my stay. She also gave me a welcome fruit. If I have any questions, I can tell housekeeper Xiaojing that she will reply in time. and resolve. I feel that every waiter in the hotel is very enthusiastic and always greets every guest with a smile. Whether checking in or checking out, the bathroom is also very clean, and they can help me quickly and enthusiastically. Their service attitude made me feel very comfortable.
When I left the store, the customer service steward Xiaojing helped me pay the bill and delivered the car in a timely manner. I accidentally left a ring behind when I left. Fortunately, I added Xiaojing steward wx and immediately contacted her to find my lost ring. , kindly asked me to run errands to deliver it to me. I am really grateful to every staff member of Yazhi Hotel. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in with good service and complete facilities. I will stay here again next time I have the opportunity.

msg:I stayed at the Elegant Hotel (Pearl River New Town Canton Tower) for four days and three nights (29-1/4/2024) during the Easter period at a five-star price, but the service quality was only four-star. When I checked in, I changed the deposit into I wasted 20 minutes to get a refund. I couldn't get a room on the third night, but later I found out that I had to check out because my friend who had another room only stayed for 2 nights. They checked out on the third day and even us. The rooms we stayed for three days were all returned. Once again, there was a mistake. There was only one clean table where we could sit and eat during the night out. Because no one cleaned it after all the ********* guests had finished eating, it felt unhygienic. The bathroom design is not very convenient. The towel storage area is separated from the shower area. You must prepare a bath towel before showering.

The WiFi in the room is very strong, and the scenery outside the window is beautiful. Fruits and biscuits are often prepared in the lobby for guests to enjoy, which is very considerate. The attitude of the waiters in the lobby is very good, which is worthy of praise. There are often many taxis outside the hotel, and it is close to the subway station, so transportation is very convenient.

When we checked in, the concierge helped us push the large and small luggage directly to the room with a luggage cart.

We ordered "Dian Du De" morning tea for breakfast. The only regret is that the weather in Guangzhou has been foggy these two days. In addition, there are people singing loudly by the riverside at night. Of course this is not the hotel's responsibility.

I couldn't help myself and changed to a room that was less noisy but still quite noisy. , think about enduring it for one night. As a result, something even more speechless happened. The light switch on the washbasin in the room was broken, making it impossible to turn off the light. This meant that if it was not turned off, the room would be lit all night, so I called the front desk for consultation. The first time the front desk called a waiter, the waiter actually lied. I said that the lights cannot be turned off manually, they can only be turned off automatically. So I waited. After waiting for a long time, the light stayed on. I looked around in the room and found that there was a switch, but it was broken, so I called the front desk. . .

But it was already past one o'clock in the evening, and I didn't want to bother with the small lamp under the sink, so I said there was no need to remove it. . As a result, I stayed up all night in a bright room and couldn't sleep at all. . . . . Never experienced such bad hotel and service. There are a lot of hotels in Zhujiang New Town that cost more than 1,000 people. Unless it is a last resort, everyone should avoid lightning. . . It was really bad. Even though it was as bad as the picture, the hotel didn't forget to call after 12 o'clock to remind me to check out. I complained twice and reported it to the manager before he said the check-out would be postponed to 3 pm. But I couldn't help it. It was after 1 o'clock. Pack up and leave immediately, change hotel!

On the first day I checked in, it was very cold in Guangzhou. After checking in, I found that there was no heating in the room. After contacting the waiter, there was no reply for a long time. After contacting the staff for the second time, they said that the room was being cleaned and that the room could be viewed after an hour. It was clearly stated that the room would be inspected and cleaned. There was no conflict. After taking us to see the house, we found that there was no cleaning. In other words, the cleaning was just an excuse. Maybe if we didn't communicate forcefully, the matter would have been prevaricated. The cleaning and other things were all lies and excuses. And when we went in to look at the room, we obviously heard the sound of the toilet flushing. A waiter was using the toilet inside? Is it available to the room attendant where the client is checking in? ? ? She said it was a bit disgusting ü§¢, and the takeout could not be delivered upstairs. No one answered the call to the customer service desk in the middle of the night. It was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in at this level.
Afternoon tea for two people: On the day of departure, I asked if there was American style afternoon tea. I didn‚Äôt want anything else. I packed a cup of American style and left. I couldn‚Äôt explain clearly, and the training was not in place.

Xiao Zheng very thoughtfully introduced us to the delicious food in the surrounding area. The room also provided a fruit mask and Lantern Festival. They were very considerate and the stay was very comfortable. After leaving the hotel, Xiao Zheng even helped to issue an invoice, which I was very satisfied with.

msg:Can you say that I think it is the best and best hotel in Guangzhou... You must stay in a river view room, the view is particularly good. I feel like my window is facing my waist ~ The sky lobby is amazing. Everything in the lobby bar on the 28th floor is very good. It would be perfect if there is a fresh coffee machine for afternoon tea, even if it is limited to one cup per person, instead of instant coffee. Instant is too cheap for a hotel. The hygiene is perfectüòçFrom the moment you enter, every corner of the room is neat, clean and of high quality. As soon as I opened the door to the room and the curtains opened automatically, I felt great. Every detail and service is done exceptionally well. The toiletries are all L'Occitane. There are even facial masks and hot eye patches before going to bed. Add 100 points... Finally, I would like to say that I will still choose Yaya next time I come to Guangzhou.

msg:The services and facilities are quite satisfactory. I don't think I'm considerate and I'm not dissatisfied. During the Spring Festival, the occupancy rate is high and check-in is a bit slow.

I went there for the scenery, and I was really surprised by the scenery! The views of the Asian Games Park + Liede Bridge + Canton Tower are really great, both during the day and at night. When we checked in in the afternoon, we were very tired, so we took it by the window in the room and took pictures of the scenery. As I was taking pictures, I suddenly discovered that the weather was cloudy and a red sunset appeared on the horizon. It was a big surprise. This is the meaning of travel ~ those unexpected and beautiful encounters.

If you are paying for the landscape and are not too particular about other aspects, I would highly recommend it.

It is very photogenic and travel is very convenient. There are many taxis downstairs. , the surrounding consumer facilities are very complete. There is a square downstairs where the food and drinks are very good. There is also a large shopping mall Tianhui Plaza behind, with luxury accessories, clothes and other items available. The environment is very good. It was my first time to stay at a Yazhi hotel. I had a very good experience and felt at home. Check-in is on the 28th floor. The customer service butler Xiaoqing is very warm and thoughtful. During the check-in process, he mentioned that the child was not feeling well. After the check-in was completed, he enthusiastically helped deliver the luggage to the room and then took the initiative to contact him. We went to the lobby bar and thoughtfully sent lean meat porridge, white porridge and cut fruits to the room for the children. The service was very good. Thinking that the child was not feeling well, he asked the customer service housekeeper Xiaoqing to send a quilt to the room and let the child follow him at night. His mother would be more comfortable in bed. It didn't take long for the room attendant to bring it to the room. Xiaoqing also took the initiative to ask if he needed turndown service at night. This was a bit of an unexpected surprise. He gave the room a facial mask, chocolate, and milk. There is also a very beautiful small pendant keychain, which makes the child very happy. The room assigned to us was in a very good location, with a relatively high floor. It had an unobstructed view of the riverside. You could see the Canton Tower and Liede Bridge. You could also see the night cruise ships coming and going on the river at night. The scenery was amazing. good. The room configuration is also very good, with free mineral water drinks and free skin care products. I told the customer service Xiaoqing that the child may drink more water if he is not feeling well, and they gave us a few more bottles when they brought the quilt. Mineral water was provided to us and the service was very considerate. There was a coffee machine, coffee capsules, and tea in the room. The hotel also had a gym, a seafood buffet hot pot, and a Chinese restaurant. You could eat delicious food without leaving the hotel. The hotel provides free morning and afternoon tea and a late-night canteen (late night snack), which are very good. The staff encountered in every area entering and exiting the hotel were very polite to say hello, the service was enthusiastic, and they were able to answer questions in a timely manner, and their business skills were very professional. In general, Yazhi Hotel deserves to be the first in the luxury list. It is worthy of its name and the experience is very good. I will continue to choose Yazhi Hotel next time I come to Guangzhou.

Stayed in a city view room on the 38th floor and the view was pretty good too.
The hotel butler boy welcomed us in, and the concierge Liang helped us deliver takeaways. The service was really attentive, and I had a very happy trip.
The complimentary cocktails are also good, the only thing is the comfort of the pillows

The waiter cleaned it, implying that it was the lady who was traveling with me who put it there, which made me so angry... , there is rubbish on the ground at the entrance... In short, the hygiene is poor. I strongly recommend not to stay in this hotel! Moreover, the toilet sensor light cannot be turned off after it is turned on, which seriously affects sleep. There are two detection sensors on the roof, and the red light flashes from time to time in the middle of the night. There is nothing I can do... The hotel that most affects your rest‚Ä¶.

The scenery is great, and the transportation is also very convenient, just near Liede Subway Station. We booked a dynamic river view room.

Both the guest rooms and public areas are kept very clean and tidy. They have strict hygiene measures, which gave me a sense of peace of mind and comfort. The hotel offers a variety of choices and the quality of service at check-in is excellent. The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic. They responded promptly to my needs and questions and provided effective assistance. The hotel also provided thoughtful services such as luggage storage and travel consultation, which made me feel at home.

The location is convenient, the facilities are elegant, the service is excellent, clean and tidy, the food and beverages are abundant, and the value exceeds expectations. If given the chance, I will definitely choose to stay at this hotel again.

As for facilities, the check-in lobby is located on the 28th floor. It is a very small space. The room layout, furnishings and materials are not up to five-star standards. The most puzzling thing is that there is no place to hang clothes and towels in the shower room. Liang wants to go out naked and put on clothes. Hygiene is even worse. The electric kettle is leaky and there are water stains on the water pipe. I stayed for 2 nights. On the first day when I checked in, I had to use only half a roll of clean toilet paper. On the second day, the housekeeping did not come to take out the trash and there was no refill. As a result, we returned to the hotel and there was no toilet paper. As a five-star hotel, This is unacceptable for a hotel. Low cost performance.

The curtains opened automatically when entering the room. The large floor-to-ceiling window glass was dirty (my wife had to pick a clean glass angle to take photos of the Canton Tower). Looking at the carpet on the floor, it was dirtier than the doormat at home.
What disappointed me most was their service. I came back from shopping on the first night to take a shower and rest. Halfway through washing, the water ran out and I found that the shower hose was broken (after turning on the water, water came out from the side of the hose and the shower water The amount was very small and could not be used normally) After washing with the shower above, I quickly came out and called the front desk to report repairs. The front desk said that they would arrange for a technician to come and take a look (at about 11:30 at this time). Considering that I was tired after a day of playing, I asked the hotel to arrange it tomorrow morning. Come and fix it.
Let's turn on the TV and have a look, but the remote control didn't respond after pressing it for a long time. After finally turning it on, I still couldn't change the channel, so I called the front desk again. I sent someone to take a look. The gentleman also played with it for a while and told me that the system might be stuck. The operation was good and bad sometimes, so forget it, just don't watch it. I told him about the shower head, and he said that we should ask the master to replace it now, it would only take a few minutes. Then change it. After a while, the master brought a water pipe to replace it, and it was agreed after a few minutes. When I saw that the middle of the hose was broken (the internal rubber pipe was exposed outside the metal pipe), I said that I could not accept such a replacement. The master told me that it was ok and it would not affect normal use. He turned on the water as he said it, but the water leaked directly from the middle of the pipe and made him wet. He turned around and told me that this accessory is the last one. Why don't you check out before you check out? Working on it. I rejected it on the spot. Could it be that if it doesn‚Äôt work before I check out, and if it can‚Äôt be repaired, I will change rooms? Please report the current situation to me. He said give me 10 minutes and I'll think of a solution, and I agreed. After a while, I took the accessories and replaced them and left. When I came back to take a shower the next day, the problem was still the same. The shower head was still broken. I had been working on it for more than an hour the day before, and my relationship was so lonely! Considering that I was leaving tomorrow and needed some rest, I didn't say anything more.
When I checked out, the front desk asked if I was satisfied. I told him that it was the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. Then I told the story again and he apologized. Did any of my colleagues ask you to change rooms? I said that other hotels have raised issues before, but your hotel has not!
Summarize
Hygiene: The carpet is dirty, the glass is dirty and there is mold behind the sink.
Service: The guest's problem was not solved until the end. The maintenance man said that it could not be solved until after check-out. The room was not cleaned properly.
Equipment: TV remote control does not work properly
Environment: average

msg:The soundproofing of the hotel is very poor. You can hear the DJ playing in the bar downstairs in the middle of the night. You can also hear the music playing in the next room in the morning. The air conditioner has no heating. I only went to see the tower at 1900 and take pictures. There was no takeaway. , even if there are robots, they won‚Äôt let the robots help deliver. Apart from the view of the Canton Tower, there is no place worth staying. Downstairs, there are a lot of marketing people asking you if you want to go to the bar at night. It‚Äôs very chaotic.

They introduced popular places in Guangzhou and arranged check-in immediately. It was very efficient because I arrived early. Wait until 2pm and it will be worth going again. The price/performance ratio of this place is higher than other five-star places. There are many food places nearby.

msg:The hotel has convenient transportation and a comfortable environment. The rooms are clean and tidy. The front desk service is very good. When you enter the hotel lobby, it feels very classy. The decoration is very exquisite. The room is large and sunny. The supplies are tidy and everything is clean and hygienic. If you have the opportunity, I will come here again, with good service attitude and elegant environment. This is a hotel that makes others feel relaxed. The hotel design is very good, the furnishings and layout are relatively comfortable, and it is quite stylish. The main reason I came here was to give my fianc√©e a surprise: propose to her! So I came one day in advance to take a look at the hotel's environment and rooms. As soon as I entered the lobby, I saw Butler Yang. He came up to me very enthusiastically and said hello. After understanding my needs, he took me up to see two rooms. Which style do I prefer? They also introduced me to the facilities in the room and the matching cosmetic bags. They were really professional. Then they took me to the lobby bar and introduced me to the complimentary afternoon tea in the room because I wanted to join my fianc√©e. My best friend gave her a surprise, but there were not enough people to enjoy the free afternoon tea in the room. Xiao Yang recommended us to buy a set meal online. It was very cost-effective. Then the next day, I was given an arrangement where I could see the Canton Tower as soon as I entered the door. The room was very warm and tidy, and it was very nice in every aspect! The scenery is directly connected to the Canton Tower. The waiters are very hospitable and solve any problems quickly. The front desk service is good. The hotel also has free parking. It is very close to the shopping mall and there are many local late-night snacks. It is good to stay here. comfortable. Facilities and equipment: The room facilities and equipment are super complete. I still prefer the toiletries in this hotel. There are eight sets of toiletries in total, including facial cleanser and makeup remover. As for the elevators here, although there are 6 elevators, there are I had to wait quite a long time because the floor was a bit high. I heard that there is a spa and KTV upstairs. There were a lot of people coming and going at night, and there was a lot of alcohol smell in the elevator at night. I thought we should send someone to the elevator from time to time at night. Or check the 1st floor. However, you can rest assured that you need to swipe your card to go to the hotel room in the elevator. If you want to order takeout, you need to go down to the 1st floor to pick it up. It is a bit inconvenient. I hope that a robot can be arranged to send it upstairs so that guests can get it. Better enjoyment, the cleaning is quite clean, and the water will be refilled for you every time. Thumbs up to the cleaning lady. The price-performance ratio is so high!! I really want to give you a crazy Amway. Next time you come to Guangzhou and want to stay in a hotel, you can check out this hotel!! In addition to the good service, the breakfast is also very good among hotels in the same price range! !First of all, there are many kinds. You can choose what you like to eat. There will always be one that suits your taste. For example, I got a rice roll, fried egg, milk, small pumpkin for dessert, etc. The second is the quality. The dishes all look very fresh, including Cantonese breakfast tea. Rice rolls, soup noodles, and fried eggs are all made by dedicated personnel. The buns are kept warm in the drawer. These are all hot in your mouth! !The last one is taste. Yes! Many of the dishes in the restaurant are very suitable to my taste. Although the rice rolls are not that authentic, the price/performance ratio is still very good! Another thing I want to talk about is hygiene. People who stay in hotels generally pay great attention to the hygiene of the hotel. The sanitation of Yazhi Hotel is really good. The overall feeling is that it is very clean and tidy. The style of the room is also very simple and generous. The bed is neither soft nor hard. It feels very comfortable to lie on it. Comfortable!! Finally, I would like to praise Xiao Yang again. His service is really attentive. Not only did they help me arrange a room facing the Canton Tower in advance, but they also gave me fruit, milk and steam eye mask after check-in. The whole stay was great!! I will choose here next time, highly recommended!

You can enjoy the unobstructed view of the waistline on the first floor. The lobby on the 28th floor even overlooks the invincible river view, where the colorful lights at night complement each other. ‚ù§
It is about a 15-minute walk from the Guangdong Provincial Museum. The square in front of the museum is an excellent place to take photos with the illuminated Canton Tower and show off your long legs after nightfall‚úå
Downstairs of the hotel is Hunter Square (mainly catering, creative Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese seafood, French and Western food, lovely Western pastry afternoon tea, coffee and tea, everything you want) üçª
This check-in experience was relaxing and pleasant. The butler Amy's service was enthusiastic, gentle and generous. She thoughtfully gave welcome fruits and late check-out. The concierge guys I met during the two days of check-in and check-out were also very nice. I will stay here again when I come to Guangzhou again. Will choose eleganceüåü

It was just like the promotional picture. The hotel is in Chinese style. The room is large, beautifully decorated and smart. The view from the room is really great for seeing the Canton Tower. You can see the Canton Tower as soon as you enter the door. You really don‚Äôt need to buy a ticket for the Canton Tower. There are a lot of delicious food downstairs in the hotel, so you don‚Äôt have to go far to eat. There are a lot of things to play in the square downstairs during activities. The only pity is that the weather has been bad these days and I can't see the sunset. The sunset pictures sent by the housekeeper are very beautiful. After checking in, you don‚Äôt have to worry about anything. Basically, someone will do it for you silently. The snacks and fruits given are really delicious. They will also help organize the bathrobes, towels and sheets when they are brought in, and provide some milk. In the evening When I come back and finish drinking, I feel sleepy and can relax very well. When I checked in, I added a butler, Xiao Zheng, who would arrange these very thoughtfully. They also remind you of the recent weather from time to time, and the service is very attentive. When I checked in, I saw a lot of small items in the lobby, which were very convenient and showed that they were very thoughtful. Their home also provides a spa, so you can go and enjoy it when you are tired from traveling. The night view outside the window is a combination of tranquility and bustle. Looking at the endless traffic, towering towers, and quiet river water, watching it quietly in a daze is particularly healing. The hotel overall is very good. There are many opportunities to relax and I will continue to choose this hotel.

It is said that afternoon tea and supper are provided, but it is better not to provide it. The cakes for afternoon tea are just okay and not very rich. The skin care products in the room are said to be for guest use. They look high-end, but in fact they are not that good. It feels like they have all kinds of gorgeous packaging. I think this hotel would be okay if it sold for more than one thousand, but more than two thousand is too high. Objectively speaking from a sense of value, I am willing to spend a little more to live in the Park Hyatt next door.

msg:I would like to share an unforgettable experience I had at the Elegant Hotel. I am a Belarusian and my family of three came to Guangzhou to travel. As a foreign traveler, I came to this strange city and was a little worried about the language and cultural barriers. However, my stay in your hotel gave me great comfort and touch.
  First of all, I would like to commend the staff at Elegant Hotel. From the moment I stepped into the hotel lobby, they showed me extremely professionalism and warm service. Despite language issues due to geographical reasons, they always patiently listened to my needs and tried their best to communicate with me. Their friendly smiles and cordial gestures made me feel the warmth of home, which is particularly precious in a foreign country.
  Secondly, I would like to make a special mention of your hotel's room facilities and attentive service. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and everything was carefully arranged. The bed is soft and comfortable, the bathroom facilities are fully equipped, and professional cleaning staff take care of my room every day to keep it tidy. What is touching is that when we checked in, the customer service butler Marson gave my child a car toy. When we left the front desk, he also gave me some cookies and snacks. We were very happy about this and felt very warm. Marson, the customer service butler, took the initiative to add me on WeChat, which made it easier to communicate with hotel staff. He immediately sent me the schedule and location of breakfast, late night snacks, afternoon tea, and SPA in my room. I have to say that this was very useful. , sometimes when I can‚Äôt remember, I will open the dialog box to view the information.
  The room I stayed in has a very wide view, and I can see the beautiful scenery of Zhujiang New Town. I like the large floor-to-ceiling windows very much. All the scenery is unobstructed. The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very prosperous, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about running out of food, Thai food, Japanese food, Chinese food, Cantonese-style morning tea, you can eat everything. There is Tianhui Plaza IGC nearby, which has many products and delicious food. The shopping mall is very high-end and gave me a very good shopping experience. This hotel is located in Liede, in the CBD of Guangzhou. There are many high-rise buildings nearby. I have stayed in many hotels. This is the first hotel where I can observe landmark buildings at such a close distance. It is very shocking to me. The hotel environment made me want to stay a few more nights, but I ran out of time and needed to catch my flight the next day. The next day, the butler Marson helped me book a taxi to the airport. When the taxi arrived, he helped me carry my luggage and took me to the taxi. I was very grateful to him.
  It is commendable that the hotel has a free shuttle bus to the Canton Fair Center, and it also includes pick-up and drop-off services, which are free for guests. Fruit snacks are given as gifts on the bus, which is very considerate! I think a hotel with such excellent service deserves more attention. It is not just an ordinary five-star hotel, but a very humane hotel that makes people feel different from other hotels. This is rare. .
  My family and I had a very comfortable stay in this hotel. There were three different kinds of tea in the room and I made tea with my family in the evening. I have a soft spot for this hotel and if I have a chance next time, I will bring other friends to experience it.

Thank you Marson very much!!!!

It was really troublesome. Then we chose Guangzhou, which has a more convenient location. Yazhi Hotel, it only takes 6 minutes to walk to Liede Subway Station and there is no need to turn around. It is very easy to find the place. Then, if we stayed here for one night, it was quite good. First, let us take a taxi to Guangzhou Yazhi. The location of the hotel is quite easy to find. Then go to the sky lobby on the 28th floor to check in. The staff are very polite. The nearest subway station is Liede Exit B. When you get out of the subway, you can go through Tianhui IGC Plaza. We crossed a Lieshui Bridge and saw the building. We took the elevator on the first floor of Tiande Plaza to reach the 28th floor. As soon as we entered the door, there was a concierge guy who helped us carry our luggage and guided us to the 28th floor to check in, and then we arrived. When the front desk stepped out of the elevator, the hotel customer service lady would come up to greet me, and then take our luggage away. Since we were receiving foreign guests, the front desk was very patient and handled it for us. Then when you check in, you will be greeted with a smile, and you will not feel downcast. Although they work for a long time every day, they are still very dedicated, and it still takes a few minutes to check in with a smile. Before arriving at the hotel, my dedicated butler, Xiao Li, called me in advance and asked me about my room requirements and whether I would come here for business or pleasure. Xiao Li also arranged very well and all my requirements and problems could be solved. When we checked in at the front desk, Xiao Li had already introduced us to the complimentary afternoon tea and late night snacks in the room. He also introduced us to the food streets and shopping malls around the hotel. After checking in, the customer service lady would guide us to the elevator. Because the room type we chose is a city view room facing Zhujiang New Town. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room can see the bustling city night view. It is really comfortable. When we open the door, it is very clean and has no odor. Then the girl helped us arrange the room. It is very convenient to be adjacent to each other, and you can move around at any time after several rooms. For breakfast, I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it because I was in a hurry the next day. I hope to experience it again next time. For afternoon tea, there are some Western-style pastries, sugary water, fruit drinks, because after all, for afternoon tea, there are croissants and the like. The small cakes and the coffee are all good. You can enjoy the beautiful river view and the landmark waist while sitting and enjoying afternoon tea. For late-night snacks, there is a late-night canteen. There are porridge, noodles, and other hot dishes that you can choose from. There are both meat and vegetable dishes, and there are also sauces to choose from. I really like it. My experience after checking in was quite good. I felt that the service was very warm and all aspects were very good. It was very good. After the butler Xiao Li added vx, he could reply in time when asking about places to visit nearby, and any questions could be solved. It's really convenient here overall. It's very convenient to go anywhere. There is a food street downstairs, which is very lively at night. There is also a quiet bar where you can communicate with customers and chat about things. The hotel staff are warm and friendly, and Xiao Li provides thoughtful and meticulous service. Services can meet the various needs of guests. Overall cleanliness: The hotel rooms, public areas and facilities are all kept in good cleanliness, giving people a comfortable and secure feeling.

The large bathtub was certainly great for taking photos. I checked in on the National Day. China won a medal at the Asian Games that night, and with the beautiful scenery outside the window, I was in a great mood. The breakfast is also very good, and you can clearly see your waist from the window seat in the restaurant.

The photos of Canton Tower in front of the hotel and in the cafeteria are very photogenic.
Morning and afternoon tea for two: any dessert
Late-night canteen for two persons: hot and boiled as you like
One free drink at the Mini Bar in the room: any 5 bottles of drinks

We have an elderly person in a wheelchair and a baby in a stroller. The waiters will help us carry our luggage to the room and take the initiative to push the elderly and children. The service is very good. Perfect stay experience.

There is an old street along the water behind the building. There is a concert. There are Thai certified restaurants and various bistros. If you like the excitement, don‚Äôt miss it.

msg:I had seen this hotel online before after being recommended by a friend. During this period, I wanted to take my children out to play and experience the customs and customs of Guangzhou. Haha, we booked a city view room. Looking at their promotional pictures online, I thought it was super beautiful. The large floor-to-ceiling windows are great for taking photos, and it feels like a great place to take photos. The room is quite big, the decoration style is very fashionable, and it is a relatively new hotelüè®. It seemed pretty good, so I made a reservation.
It was already afternoon when we arrived at the hotel. After entering the hotel, we found that the environment is really nice. There are cute dolls on the first floor. The concierge guy guided us to the 28th floor to check in, oh! It turns out to be the sky lobby. This sky lobby is very spacious and bright, and you can directly see the beautiful view of the Pearl River. When we checked in, the customer service lady served us tea (the special lemon tea was quite delicious. Ice cold, sour and sweet, it quenches thirst and relieves tiredness). After being introduced by the front desk, I learned that the room also has afternoon tea and late-night canteen. It is really great. You can eat all day long, because I brought children. The young man at the front desk was very considerate and asked if he had brought any toiletries for the children. He indeed did not bring them~ Then the customer service lady next to us also informed us of the location and time of the afternoon tea and late-night canteen provided by the hotel, and Miss Xinxin took the initiative to add us to WeChat, saying that if you have any questions or needs during your stay, you can contact her in time, and she will help follow up in time. She was also afraid that we would remember the time and place, so she edited it and sent it to me. This service attitude is also very good. So attentive and considerate~
       Miss Xinxin saw that we had luggage and took the initiative to help us carry our luggage to the room, and introduced us to the food, drink and entertainment around the hotel. She was really enthusiastic. After we arrived in the room, we just finished putting our things away. After a while, there was A little robot delivered something. Wow, I was really surprised. The toiletries for the children are so fast. The children like it very much. The little robot is also very cute~
      Room facilities: modern and fashionable style, very new and complete facilities, very satisfied! Room view: The view from the river view room is amazing. The floor-to-ceiling windows are huge and the view is wide. You can see the Canton Tower opposite, which is quite shocking! The oversized bathtub in the room is much bigger than I expected, and there is also a couch. Wow, it‚Äôs beyond imaginationü•∞ü•∞ I‚Äôm very satisfied.
       Miss Xinxin heard that we were out for fun and prepared a guide for us to visit the surrounding area. It was really timely. This guide is really complete. The shopping malls in the surrounding areas are marked with convenient shopping, and even the special delicacies. There are snacks too, which is great! It helped us a lot when traveling. The area around the hotel is indeed very convenient and very popular. I saw that there is a commercial street behind the hotel and there are activities going on, and there are taxis in front of the hotel. It‚Äôs really great. convenient! Because the hotel is right on the edge of the Pearl River, I went for a walk by the Pearl River after dinner. The weather is cooler now, which is really pleasant~
     This stay is a great experience. Every aspect of the hotel is very good. I must strongly recommend it to everyone. I am also very grateful to the service of the housekeeper Xinxin and other staff. If I have the opportunity, I will stay again next time ~

This hotel only has a river view. The room environment is okay, but the towels are not clean and worn, and the bathrobes are also very worn! For such a luxurious hotel, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price! Moreover, this hotel did not have any festive decorations. I made a note on the special request before checking in. Afterwards, I called customer service and the reply was not very polite. This kind of service quality needs some training! Later, when I checked in, I was given a cakeÔøº!

msg:If you want to spend a high price to buy pleasure, go to Yaya!

1. The room is ‚Äúnot clean‚Äù
1. The carpet in the room is stained and has not been cleaned for a long time.
2. I heard loud criticism at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night and found that the toothbrush next to the sink fell to the ground. It was really weird. The hotel explained that there was a KTV upstairs and the sound was so loud that my toothbrush dropped to the floor. If a KTV can shake a toothbrush like this, then it‚Äôs really an earthquake level, right?

2. Poor sound insulation in the room
I was woken up in the morning by a sound similar to a cell phone vibrating, and found a vibration that did not belong to any cell phone in our room. This vibration occurred intermittently from 6 a.m. to 12 noon. After searching for a long time, I found that it originated from the wall behind the TV that connected to the next room. Then I immediately called the housekeeping depar**ent to check, and it took nearly 20 minutes to come up. After coming up, the staff admitted on the spot that the sound insulation of their hotel was very poor! ! ! At a hotel that costs 2,000 yuan a night, the staff casually admitted that their hotel has a problem with poor sound insulation, indicating that the problem has existed for a long time, but the hotel did not take the problem seriously at all and did not care about the negative reviews from customers! The vibration that lasted all morning caused great trouble to us. You can imagine how poor the quality of the hotel's hard decoration is. Does the hotel deserve such pricing? ? ?

3. Hotel solutions are perfunctory
After reporting the problem to the hotel, the plan given was to upgrade the room next time we stay. We have made it clear on site that this is not acceptable. The hotel manager, Ms. Amy, was very nice and didn't want to waste our time and asked us to go back and wait. But after three or four hours of feedback to our superiors, we were upgraded next time.
Isn't this funny? Why should I spend 2,000 yuan to come to such a bad hotel to listen to the noise? Is this the attitude to solve the problem?
After sending us away, you then tell us the same plan and treat us like monkeys, right? Do you think that since we are not locals, we can‚Äôt go to the store to complain?
Hotels provide customers with a place to rest. You can't even provide the most basic quiet environment, and your services can't keep up with the price at all. It is said that all customers are treated equally, but the result of treating them equally is that there is no solution and forces others to go to your store to spend again.

msg:A very unforgettable stay experience. This trip was to celebrate my husband's birthday. I compared many hotels and finally chose Yazhi Hotel. On the day of check-in, the hotel housekeeper Amy called in advance and helped arrange a high-rise river view room. The room is very large, with first-class views from the bedroom and bathroom, and a panoramic view of Xiaomanyao, Liede Bridge and the Pearl River night view. It is worth mentioning that after learning that we were here to celebrate a birthday, Amy helped decorate the room and prepare a birthday cake in advance. Full of surprises, prompt and warm service was provided throughout the entire process. The hotel's service is very attentive and meticulous. Both the bedding and supplies are very comfortable. There is an oversized round bathtub in the room, where you can take a bath while enjoying the beautiful scenery outside the window.
Let me recommend the hotel services to the excellent Amy: the hotel provides free laundry rooms for guests, an afternoon tea lounge area on the 28th floor, and free drinking water for guests on each floor, which is a very humane service. The hotel is conveniently located. Downstairs is the Tiande Food Street, where many gourmet restaurants are worth trying.
I will choose Yaya again next time!

These are completely unnecessary! The location is good, right next to Liede Plaza, where you can find food, drink, and shopping. You should stay in the commercial area for accommodation.

msg:At that time, I was hesitant among several high-priced hotels, and I also looked at those in the Four Seasons. Although the evaluation of Yazhi was different, I finally chose Yazhi. Xiao Song at the front desk helped me choose a room facing Xiao Man's waist, thinking that she just agreed casually and didn't really face it. In the end, the view was really amazing to me, thank you Xiao Song. There is nothing to say about the view, the hotel is also very comfortable, there are bluetooth speakers, a big TV, the TV sound effect is also very good, you can watch premium channels, the children are very happy. The bed was also very comfortable. The key point is that the shower is also very comfortable (this is really key, some hotels look very high-end, but the shower water is hard and sprays randomly, and the experience will be very poor). The water temperature is just right, and the shower water is very large and gentle. There is also free afternoon tea and supper. The Liede Village downstairs is also very good to visit, and there is also live music. Really no choice! Five-star praise!

Worst of all was the cleanliness, half dry urine behind the toilet seat and the shower head was full of grime. The sound insulation of the room is also poor, and the sound of traffic on the street can still be heard at night in the 30-storey building. The room rate includes special items and free moon cakes. When I checked in, the front desk said with a cold face that I would mail it to the registered address when I checked out, but I didn‚Äôt mention it at all. I didn‚Äôt ask because I decided not to ask for bad reviews, but I could see the hotel No sincerity. I just read the comments and found out that the previous customers had already made bad reviews on it. I just stepped on the thunder that others stepped on. I will detour when I see the elegant signboard in the future.

The surrounding supporting facilities are complete, and there are many commercial areas. Unfortunately, we only found out before we left, which is a pity. The Guangdong Provincial Museum is within one kilometer, and there is a Liede Paradise Street downstairs of the hotel (I couldn't visit it). The afternoon tea provided by the hotel is also good. The supper is similar to Malatang, but unfortunately there are only some vegetables when I go late, and the taste is not bad. The customer service butler Xiao Zhang has a very good service attitude. He delivered children's products when he arrived at the hotel. The toiletries are from L'Occitane. It is indeed a high-end hotel. The only fly in the oin**ent is that it is located in the CBD and the hotel does not have its own swimming pool. The overall hotel is more business-like, clean and hygienic, and slightly inferior in parent-child aspects.

Let us pay according to the new room price. May I ask what you gave at that time? We took the initiative to upgrade the room. Secondly, we have already said that if we upgrade the room because of complaints, we can not use it. The hotel said that it is because it is an old VIP guest. Okay, then why do I continue to complain to your hotel and ask me to pay the original price? Even the agreement price given to me is higher than that of Ctrip? In addition, why do you call your front desk and switchboard in the middle of the night to ask for things? Your hotel and people are not in the same place. You deliberately don‚Äôt answer it. I made many calls. The most outrageous call to the restaurant was answered in seconds. It‚Äôs the first time to ask the hotel to clean and change the bed sheets and pillowcases. If it is not cleaned cleanly, it is broken the second time? You guys are too much, because we continued to stay at the original room price in the middle of the night, we didn't give the room card, and we had to ask the manager! ?

Yazhi is a high-end love hotel! It is several floors of a commercial building.
The decoration of the express hotel: You can hear slight voices in the room in the corridor; the room is made of cheap composite floors; all furniture, doors, etc. are made of cheap stickers, and the formaldehyde content will not be low; the faucet will fall off when you touch it.
There was some water from the previous occupant in the kettle; some towels were torn; hangers were painted plastic.
The only consolation is that the service staff are Guangzhou people, and they are enthusiastic.
When I inquired today, this elegant hotel is a hotel owned by an ordinary hotel group in China, no wonder it is a bit wild.

Check-in is on the 28th floor, but there is no service staff on the first floor, so you can only know it through the signs on the wall of the lobby.
The only room available is the river view room. Liede Bridge and Canton Tower are lit before 11:00 pm. But if you enjoy it at Huachenghui at night, there is no need to go to the hotel to see it. After all, it's okay to turn off the lights after 11 o'clock.

The price/performance ratio is still high, and the room is relatively large , There is a sofa for one person and a sofa that can be used halfway.

msg:A chance to come to Guangzhou for a business trip suddenly made me fall in love with a hotel, which is the elegant hotel in Guangzhou. I often need to travel on business, and I have been to many places across the country. For example, there are many international high-end five-star hotels, economical ones, and boutique ones. Only this domestic five-star hotel (Guangzhou Yazhi) left a very deep impression on me, a feeling of going home. The style of the hotel is quite unique from traditional luxury hotels. The elegant decoration is more toned and incorporates many modern elements. It is different from the tall lobby of traditional hotels. The lobby is placed on the 28th floor in the air. The aerial scenery in the lobby is amazing. It is different from the magnificent angle of the four seasons. The elegant side will be closer to Xiaomanyao and the Pearl River. Moreover, the design of the aisle from the elevator to the room and the Chinese style in the room reflect the design. In terms of service, everyone in the staff is of good quality, and they will greet guests when they see them. This is a butler-style service, and guests will be equipped with a butler. How can I say it is an honor. Little beauty Xiao Cao, listen to her introduction, this is the main service feature of the hotel, caring + humanized service. Indeed, I received a call from Xiao Cao before I checked in to confirm the check-in time, travel method, number of people, etc. I remember that it happened to be raining that day, and the welcome boy on the first floor of the lobby ran out against the rain to help with the luggage, and felt the enthusiasm of the hotel staff before entering the door
In the lobby on the 28th floor, Xiao Cao greeted me personally at the elevator door. After meeting us, he asked me warmly and led me to the front desk to check in. He also warmly handed me hot towels and tea. This kind of considerate service really made me feel the warmth of the care of relatives back home. From entering the door to checking in, it was a very pleasant process. My friends and I wanted to have fun in Guangzhou after work. After learning this information, Xiao Cao took the initiative to introduce the scenic spots and food in Guangzhou to us. Although Xiao Cao is not a local, he still has a special understanding of Guangzhou with his heart. According to our time, he also specially formulated a travel plan for our reference. It is very attentive. Xiao Cao can be found for all the arrangements inside and outside the hotel. I am really surprised how the hotel can achieve such a service chain system, which is simply Haidilao in the hotel industry. I won‚Äôt go into details about many other details during the stay. For example, the cleaning ladies will put the slippers by the bed when they clean the room for us, and they will also help to organize and fold the messy clothes. It will also write a small card to remind you that it may rain and you need to bring an umbrella, reminding you of the location of the umbrella. Every person at the front desk is enthusiastic and active towards the guests. You can feel that everyone is from the bottom of their hearts. They vividly reflect the feeling of "Welcome home" that they often say, and they have achieved a unique feature. You can see the corporate culture of the hotel, and what kind of charm the managers use to make the employees reach such a level. Under the current economic situation, the service industry is close to saturation. Don‚Äôt forget the original intention. The original intention of the service industry is to provide good service. I can only say that the elegant brand has given our people the hope of domestic hotels, and it will definitely be in the future. Shining on the international stage, all in all, it was a good experience! Amway was indeed welcomed by the elegant scenery and Xiaocao's considerate service

msg:If it's a few hundred dollars, it should be fine. But it cost close to two thousand.
Let‚Äôs talk about the bathtub first, I put a small bottle of shower gel, and then there seems to be nothing, not even a headrest.
The supplies in the bathroom, to be honest, should not be equipped with a high-end star hotel. The mouthwash cups are different in size, and the quality is only a few dollars on Taobao. The hair dryer has no brand, and the lotion is poured in after feeling it, which is really bad.
Floor-to-ceiling windows in the bathroom, electric curtains, the curtains are not the right size, and they are not tightly covered. In the early morning of the next day, the strong light hits the bed from the bathroom curtains, so you can sleep and enjoy the sun!
A high-end hotel, nearly 2,000 yuan, with a big hole in the sheet.
After complaining, I said I'm sorry, and I'll give you a small gift. I... This attitude seems to be very sincere? ?
It's really not for anything else, but to spend so much money, this kind of experience makes me feel uncomfortable!

msg:It was my first business trip to stay at the Zhujiang New Town Elegant Hotel, which left a deep impression on me! After a while after check-in, a staff member served us tea and asked us what room type we needed. Since there were a lot of people on that day, we I placed an order online, and when we checked in, Xiao Cao, the customer service manager, introduced us to some value-added services of the hotel. The high-end express hotel with a great view has an excellent location, just across from Xiaomanyao. You can enjoy the night view of Xiaomanyao and the Pearl River. It must be a proper place for online celebrities to check in. The room is very clean. The lighting is excellent this time. The room There is a large full picture window. The customer service butler, Xiao Cao, has a good service attitude and speaks softly and pleasantly. He took the initiative to add WeChat, introduced the meal time, etc., and helped me patiently guide the hotel room. The hotel service is very good. From check-in to check-out, there are butler-style services. And each floor is actually equipped with free mineral water, so that even if you leave in a hurry and forget to bring water, you can take it. Small actions, if you stick to it, it's really amazing! There is also L'Occitane used for room amenities, which is not bad, and there are plenty of welcome fruits. Room facilities: Modern and stylish, the facilities are very new and complete. Satisfied! Room view: The view from the river view room is amazing. The floor-to-ceiling windows are huge and the field of view is wide. You can see the Canton Tower on the opposite side, which is quite shocking! Location and transportation: good location and convenient transportation! Restaurant: After lunch, it is a self-service style. There are many styles, such as seafood, hot pot, barbecue, snacks and desserts. The restaurant uses good ingredients and tastes good! Parking: There is a special parking lot in the hotel, which is free. If you drive out, you have to go to the hotel lobby to report the license plate number or tell the customer service Xiaocao to get out of the car. The response speed is also very fast. The whole journey is very pleasant. If the next time Come here, this hotel is definitely the first choice! Thank you Xiao Cao for your care!

msg:Yazhi Hotel is located in Tiande Plaza. The lobby is on the 28th floor. The first floor is the concierge depar**ent. The elevator does not need to swipe the card. From the first floor, you can go directly to the sky lobby on the 28th floor. The parking lot also goes directly to the first floor and the lobby. It is very convenient, and the parking lot is large. During the stay, one car can be parked in one room for free. The front desk that checked me in this time is called Xiao Pan. When I came to the front desk, the handsome guys and beautiful women at the front desk greeted me warmly. The colleagues next to me poured tea and sent hand towels. It can be said that the first impression was very good. Xiao Pan patiently introduced to me the room type I booked, as well as the dining time and place for breakfast, afternoon tea and a bowl of noodles at night. You can see the river view, Xiaomanyao, and the room of Liede Bridge. Xiaopan chose a quieter room for me. The room is made of floor-to-ceiling glass. There is a tea set and a couch next to the glass. The sun shines in in the afternoon, so I can watch it on the couch River View, you can have a cup of tea or coffee with your friends, and you can enjoy it until the evening. The Canton Tower lights up at seven o'clock. It's no problem to stay in the elegant hotel. You can see the moment the Canton Tower lights up. It's really very comfortable. In addition, the room does not need a power card, smart sensors, lights, TVs, curtains, etc. are all sensory. Other room types include smart toilets, Dyson hair dryers, bathtubs, etc. Next time I come to Yazhi, I want to live in a dynamic room, next time I come to live in a room with a bathtub, and experience them all. In addition, Xiaopan‚Äôs service is very good. He answered all the questions I asked. I also answered and solved the problem as soon as I called. It is worthy of praise. He is also very familiar with the hotel‚Äôs products and nearby eating, drinking and entertainment places. Pan said that you can always find her if you have any problems in the room or need items. During the chat, I feel that Xiao Pan is a very honest and reliable little girl. She added WeChat and has been patiently introducing and recommending me and talking with me. For people who come to a strange city, it is really touching. I feel that I have a friend who can talk to me in this lonely city, so that I no longer feel strange and lonely, and let me have a new understanding of the first-tier cities, not imagination Instead of the indifference and fast pace in the movie, she is kind and sincere, and I am very happy to be friends with her. Except for Xiao Pan, the service of other hotel staff is also very good. The eldest sister who cleans the room heard my voice and immediately ran over to say hello and asked if I needed help. The concierge brother on the first floor came to give me a bottle of mineral water Water, pulling suitcases for other guests and other actions make me feel that the service is very thoughtful and I am very satisfied. Downstairs is the river, where you can walk, run, picnic, play badminton, etc. In the evening, you can go to the Haixinsha Bridge to see the Guangzhou Tower, take a night cruise on the Pearl River, etc. There are taxis downstairs, and it is very convenient to take a taxi. The hotel has a gym, seafood buffet, Chinese restaurant, SPA, etc. The seafood buffet is really popular, and it is recommended to book in advance. After checking out, you can go around and park for free until two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. There is a food street downstairs, there are frogs, and you often come here for small gatherings, Rongyi, bars, etc. The convenience store is also very close, just behind the hotel There is a shopping mall, which is very convenient for shopping and one-stop for eating, drinking and having fun. What impresses me the most is that their greetings are not the usual hello, but the time slot, and the concierge salute is very standard, great, and has a good sense of experience. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will choose Yazhi Hotel, and Xiaopan said that he can arrange a room for me in advance and follow up with my service throughout the whole process. It feels really great. This hotel can make me feel not only the superficial service, but also the depth of service. Like it, recommend to stay.

msg:This dynamic city view room feels very empty, like a semi-finished product. The drawers of the water bar are empty. There are also tea and coffee machines, but there are no cups and teacups... The sanitation of the sink is also poor, and there are water stains, washing cups There is no coaster underneath and it is directly buckled, the countertop is still dirty, and the daily skin care products that come with it are all copycats, and you dare not use them. It's a counterfeit product... For such an expensive price, I completely choose a hotel of another brand. I chose this hotel because it was relatively new after it opened for a long time. I didn't expect it to be so bad. Please choose carefully, and you won't believe the so-called "net celebrities" in the future The products are still old-fashioned hotels, so I feel much more comfortable. In addition, the front desk was tricked into adding money to change this room, saying that there was a Dyson hair dryer and a coffee machine, but the coffee machine didn't seem to work well... and the price at the front desk was twice as expensive as the price difference on the Internet. At that time, I raised the price difference It‚Äôs not the same. They will ask you to scan another coupon saying it can save money. The people downstairs are very messy at night. There are all kinds of drunks and night ladies. There is no security at the door. As long as people follow, you can come up casually. In short, I will not come for the second time.

You can‚Äôt see other bay views and city views. You can see all the rooms with a river view. The night view is really invincible. The front desk of the hotel is on the 28th floor, and the elevator is very fast. The price of the room can only be said to be average. You can see a lot of hair left by the previous (maybe I don‚Äôt know the first few) guests with the naked eye. This is a hotel of this level. The health situation is really never seen. There are strands of hair on the toilet that have not been cleaned. The toilet paper is almost used up and no new ones are given. The service can only be described as mediocre. I stayed at the old Guangzhou China Hotel two days ago. I can add WeChat to call in advance to confirm the itinerary and The room arrangement, accommodation preferences, and the whole service are very enthusiastic. I really need to learn how other old-fashioned hotels do. The price is more than three times that of others. The service is not as good as some low-end hotels. I can only say that the location is the best and the view too.

1. Scenery: I live in Wangjiang and Xiaomanyao. The lights at night and the sunshine in the morning make people linger and forget to leave. There is a feeling of relaxation and joy.
2. Food and lodging: There are many options for breakfast, and you can basically find your favorite food. The downstairs is adjacent to the shopping mall, so people don't have to worry about finding something to eat.
The above are good aspects, but there are two bad points.
1. Service: If you check in at night, the guy at the front desk is more serious. It still takes a lot of time to check in.
2. Facilities: This is the biggest problem. The floor of the shower room is too slippery. Everyone should be careful during the bathing process. If you accidentally fall down, it will be a disaster. The hotel still needs to consider this.

msg:The price is seriously inconsistent with the grade, and the distance from the five-star gap is too far!
Objectively speaking, the scenery is amazing and the bedding is comfortable. Other than that, it doesn't meet the specifications of a five-star hotel.
üåüThe first is the facilities. The aromatherapy of an unknown brand in the toilet is completely dry. There is no paper towel holder, and there are two rolls of paper that have been mostly used (other guests have not used them up), and they are still very rough. The raw wood pulp paper (the beige kind), I don‚Äôt recognize the brand of the shampoo and conditioner, and the bottle of hair conditioner is not full. It gives people the feeling that other guests use leftovers. The hotel also has L‚ÄôOccitane shampoo, but it costs 100 yuan to buy a set. The hanger is very expensive. The old color has faded. May I ask the first four pictures, which one can be associated with a five-star hotel?
üåüPaid items: The price is 2200, a luxury room with a bathtub with a view, audio and bubble bath will cost money, I accept it, the audio is 30 yuan to rent once (I asked what brand the answer is Bosch, sent It is a miscellaneous brand, I asked why, and replied that Bosch was rented out)? ? Two packs of bubble bath cost 30 yuan. I was surprised when I got it. The domestic pheasant brand, I wonder if the cost should be 1 yuan. I regret that I should take a picture of the audio and bubble bath products.
üåüService: The most surprising thing is the service. The communication method of the waiter is very uncomfortable. I checked in two days before my birthday, and I wanted to celebrate my birthday early on the weekend. I asked if there was a birthday gift, and I replied bluntly, "We only have it on the day of my birthday. ", I didn't answer the call because I didn't understand it, forget it; the room service asked if there was any tape, and the other party said to look for it and reply us, and then there was no more; accidentally dropped something at the door by hand, and was taken away by the aunt Yes, I asked if it was possible to get it back with the mentality of trying, and the other party replied, "The ones who left the door would have been cleared away." The premise is that my boyfriend did not blame or question during the whole process. It is very uncomfortable to say that it is our responsibility. Some facilities in the room were broken and people were smashed. I was actually very unhappy because of the backlog of things before. I went to the front desk and asked why the things were broken. The first sentence of the front desk was "Did you break it?" all over! ! The third sentence is sorry if I got hurt! However, the subsequent manager made a special trip to apologize for this and gave a souvenir. The attitude was good and the handling was positive, so I will not elaborate on the specific situation. However, after several contacts, the communication method of the staff still needs training.

In general, I think that if you live in a B&B with a first-line view, the inflated price can only buy the view, but not the home away from home and five-star facilities and services.

When I checked out, I happened to pass by the cleaning lady cleaning the room, so I asked if I could give her two disposable slippers. The cleaning lady replied: I have to pay for this. Well, a service person replied to me like this. I think the service of this hotel is probably like this. I told the front desk, and the front desk said that it was not easy for part-time workers. They might think that you want to take away the slippers, so... a room of more than 900, take away two disposable slippers to rest your feet in the car. Is it a loss of ethics? I need you to treat me like this. Hahaha, I have stayed in many hotels, and this is a hotel where details can make all the beauty lose. At first, I was entangled with the Mandarin Oriental Taikoo Hui and this one. Now, compared with the Mandarin Oriental, this hotel is probably not even qualified to carry shoes. Although I have never stayed in the Mandarin Oriental Guangzhou, I dare say that the Mandarin Oriental does a better job than him. Bad review!

msg:I stayed at the hotel for the first time today, and I felt really good. This time I booked a big bed room with a city view. When I checked in, Xiaojiang's service was really good. I introduced the difference between the hotel room types and the city view can only be seen. To the urban landscape of Zhujiang New Town, you can see Liede Bridge and Guangzhou Tower Pearl River Night Tour in the river view. After staying for one night, it really doesn't feel too good. In addition, because of masks, the hotel canceled the breakfast for dine-in. Everyone can live with peace of mind. We will deliver breakfast to our room one by one. It is really thoughtful. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western styles. Very understandable, the hotel also gave morning and afternoon tea, from 11:00 noon to 10:00 pm. I woke up this afternoon, and I must get up to have afternoon tea. It is full of ritual sense. I went to the lobby on the 28th floor, Miss. The warm hospitality, introduced fruits, desserts, coffee, drinks, etc., as well as some porridges, all of which are self-service, sipping coffee, chatting with friends, and drinking afternoon tea in the sky is really yyds, you can take a shot. It‚Äôs a blockbuster. Let‚Äôs go to clear it in the evening. From 11:00 to 2:00 in the morning, you can also invite friends to have a drink. The scenery at night is even more pleasant. The colorful lights illuminate Guangzhou. It‚Äôs so beautiful. !
The hotel has a beautiful environment and a good location. It is located in the Liede Bridge in the center of Guangzhou CBD. It is close to the best location of the Canton Tower. The transportation is also very convenient. There are rows of taxis downstairs. The second stay is the big bed with city view, the room is comfortable and hygienic, Xiaojiang is very enthusiastic and willing to provide all kinds of help, the breakfast is also rich, the facilities are very user-friendly, the hotel's network wifi signal is also very fast, lying down and watching dramas, really Don't be too comfortable, the scenery outside the window is particularly beautiful. The TV in the room can enjoy the same visual effects as a private theater when you can't sleep at night. The facilities of the hotel room are very advanced, and the sanitation in the room is also clean. The large floor-to-ceiling windows can see the whole city. The bed in the hotel room is also very comfortable. When I come back at night, I open the room and send good night milk very intimately. And fruit plate, full of warmth! There are many data cables at the head of the bed, which are quite in place. The minibar and some drinks are free, and the skin care products and masks are free. It is conceivable that the elegant details are done in place, and the hotel parking is also free. Yes, I have everything I want to eat and go shopping. It is really unexpected and the price is very high. Xiaojiang also introduced me to the surrounding attractions. Downstairs is the igc commercial center, Tiande square food street, and it is also a short distance from the Pearl River Road. A road, a bar street is really too a**ospheric! There is also a gym on the 28th floor, feel what it is like to exercise in the air! There is also a self-occupied laundry room on the 35th floor, which is very considerate. The hotel environment is clean and tidy. The room layout is perfect and elegant without losing the sentiment, and the service is thoughtful, which makes people extremely comfortable. It gave me a feeling of home, no matter how big or small it is so impeccable, the price is also very reasonable, it is worth recommending. It was a very good stay experience.

The bedding and pillows are quite comfortable [proud R] The room hygiene is still very good and standard, the Internet celebrity hotel is really very Internet celebrity, the photos are very good, and the pictures are very good, but I didn't see it at night Many internet celebrities [crying to provoke R] Maybe they don't come here now haha, but the service lady and brother are both very good-looking, and the service is really good. I will say hello to you when I see it. The toiletries are all L'Occitane, which is not bad. There are also skin care products on the washstand. I usually hear people say that the sound insulation is not good. Hahaha, the 36th floor has not heard it yet. It's a big movement, but it's not a big problem~ I still like the feeling of tranquility, and the night view is beautiful. It's just that the TV can't be turned on. Emm, the refrigerator has drinks, but it's all soft drinks except water. I have to pick it up on the first floor to order takeaway. There is a Space bar downstairs, downstairs, and upstairs to sleep hahahaha, the 28th floor is the lobby bar and there is free morning and afternoon tea. The afternoon is relatively simple. If you want to look better, it is recommended to buy afternoon tea separately. ‚òï A bowl of noodles is in the middle of the night The fourth floor is open from 23:00 to 2:00. The robot does not send the room, and you have to go down to eat, drink porridge and noodles. The taste is really good, and it means that you must be cheeky and increase the amount! So delicious üòã Overall not bad. More than 1k is still satisfactory, if these facilities are intelligent

The children's products only had toothbrushes, no body soap, shampoo, and no children's bathrobes. Toilet paper is half roll....lunch is ok. . The morning and afternoon tea for two people seems to be complaining in the comment area... It's too pitiful. Luckily it's free... just fine. The only biggest highlight is the self-service free laundry room, which is not available in other hotels. It is very convenient if you go out for a lot of time. Automatic drying. It just takes a long time. The rest, oh yes, there is an eldest cleaning lady, I didn't write down the name. As soon as I checked in, I asked for a toilet seat for the children. I had to wait a while. I said that the child was in a hurry to go to the toilet, and they ran to the downstairs to get it. Thank you. . In short, the price is reasonable, just did not enjoy the room upgrade. City view room is very general,
No bathtub.

msg:This is the first time to stay in the elegant hotel. Before making a reservation, I came to see the room half a month in advance in mid-to-late August. I came to the front desk on the 28th floor to inquire at the front desk, and patiently answered my doubts and followed my instructions. I recommended a room type for my needs, and the front desk arranged a customer service housekeeper Xiaotang to take me up to visit the room. Xiaotang carefully introduced me to the room and hotel facilities and equipment, and introduced me to the difference between different room types, so that I can judge Which room type is more suitable. Later, I told Xiaotang that I was planning to propose, so the scenery and scenery must be good, and I could not regret the proposal, because I had the need for venue layout, Xiaotang kindly recommended me the company that arranged the venue. Later, I saw the room type of the deluxe river view room on the Internet. I felt it was not bad, so I booked the deluxe river view room. After booking the room a few days before the check-in, Xiaotang was very considerate and gave me a few days in advance to help me remark my row room needs. , because I needed to arrange the room, Xiaotang had already arranged the room for me in the morning on the day of check-in, and contacted the company that arranged the venue in advance. In the morning, Xiaotang had not yet arrived at work time, and notified the hotel's concierge and front desk to help with the luggage cart and Prepare the room card for the decoration company to arrange the room. I really appreciate Xiaotang's help so that the process is not delayed. The room arranged by Xiaotang is really good. The room is facing Xiaoman's waist, and the view is very good. You can overlook the Pearl River and Liede Bridge. You can see Xiaoman's waist outside the ring glass window when you push the door, especially the night view. is so beautiful. The deluxe river view room is quite large, the curtains are electric, there is a dressing room and a minibar, the toiletries are all from L'Occitane, there is a gift mask, and a full set of skin care products, makeup remover and styling products. The bathtub is a big round bathtub, watching TV while soaking in the bath, with a small waist outside the window, very comfortable!! And the pictures are also very beautiful. The hotel offers afternoon tea next to the hotel lobby, with coffee and snacks. The view of the room is really great. It is highly recommended for friends who come to Guangzhou to stay. You can see the beautiful night view of Guangzhou. It is also very suitable for couples to stay, very romantic. It's also advanced, and the key to taking pictures is really nice. Later, because I needed video projection, I contacted the housekeeper Xiaotang. She quickly helped me contact the engineering depar**ent to come and help. I have to say that the hotel's linkage service is really good, including the front desk of the hotel. The staff cooperated with me. To the final withdrawal of the venue, Xiaotang and the hotel staff arranged it very well. The check-in experience this time is really good. I would like to highlight Xiaotang here. From the first visit to the room, to booking the room, arranging the room, to check-in and check-out, the service details are well done. Of course, this is inseparable from the hotel. The management and Xiaotang's personal professional qualities are very dedicated. If you want a better view, remember to ask for a high-rise when you book. The front desk on the 28th floor is faster for check-in and registration. The housekeeper speaks very softly. If you like butler-style service, you can really choose Guangzhou Elegant Hotel. The location and scenery are very cost-effective. I recommend it to friends who are traveling or on anniversaries! Downstairs of the hotel is Tiande Street, Tiande Square. It is convenient to eat, play and drink. Of course, the location of the hotel is also Very good, it is more convenient to go anywhere, and I will choose the elegant hotel next time if I have the opportunity.

msg:This hotel's stay experience is perfect. It is definitely one of the best hotels in Guangzhou. It is very suitable for tourism or business trips. The layout of the rooms is reasonable, the hotel facilities are very new, the hardware facilities are very complete, and the software facilities also meet the needs of guests. , The overall design of the hotel is low-key and luxurious. This decoration style is also my favorite. There are also many works of art in the hotel, especially the panda on the first floor. I can't help but want to take pictures and punch cards.
Location: Next to the hotel is the igc Tianhui Square, the environment is very clean and beautiful, and there is a taxi stop downstairs, so I don't worry about travel problems at all. And the surrounding facilities have everything, really unparalleled.
Service: It can be called five-star, and the most important thing is service. This experience also made me feel how well the hotel has trained staff and helped me solve various problems. Every time I meet, I will say hello and check in. Afterwards, I gave a welcome fruit to the room. When I saw that I had a cough, I took the initiative to send 999 to the room, which made my heart warm. Because it was inconvenient to go downstairs, I helped deliver takeout to the room. It will ask me about my stay after I leave the hotel. I can only say that I am very satisfied! I would also like to express my special thanks to Amy and the front office staff for their warm service. So high, it feels like home.
Room entrance: The room design is very warm, the sanitation is very clean, and the room landscape is really perfect. At dusk, I can see the a**osphere lights of various buildings light up, which makes me feel very comfortable and has a great experience.
Food: The food in the hotel, I prefer Ya Yue Xuan Chinese Restaurant, because it is more inclined to Cantonese cuisine, and the standard is worthy of being an Internet celebrity punch-in restaurant. The environment and taste are very good. In addition, the bar on the 28th floor of the hotel has a great view. Jia, condescending, an impeccable feeling.
The stay experience this time will make me the first choice for the elegant hotel when I come to Guangzhou again. Luxury brand, real service, first-class level, Guangzhou Elegant Hotel deserves its name.

What I want to complain about is the cafeteria. We are three big and one small. The front desk asked how tall the child is. I said that it was just over 1.2 meters. As a result, the waiter at the door said nothing and answered without any negotiation that we started to charge the full price for 1.2 meters... Well, blame me for being too honest and bullying honest people... Hey, it's simple, I don't care about paying this extra money, but I feel a bit wronged! And the waiter's tone without a little discussion makes people feel particularly uncomfortable!

msg:This is the first time I stayed in this hotel, and I feel very good. Let me share my feelings next. The hotel is close to the Guangzhou Financial Center. After leaving the hotel, you can see a shopping mall and go shopping and go straight through a Liede Arch Bridge. It is very convenient. When you enter the hotel building, you can see the concierge front desk on the first floor (due to the epidemic, all passengers enter from the main entrance of the building). When you arrive at the concierge front desk, a staff member will come to say hello, help with luggage, and give directions. This hotel is on the 28th floor for check-in. When you enter the lobby, you will be greeted by Guangzhou's landmark building - Canton Tower. The staff working here are really happy! Because it was the first time to stay at their hotel, Xiaolin at the front desk also took the initiative to add my WeChat, and specially arranged a room with a very good location for me. I also understand that if they drive over to their hotel, they must park at the negative one and On the negative second floor, do not park on the ground, because the ground is a property, they will charge a fee, only the negative first and negative second floors of the hotel are free. Xiaolin heard that I came here for the first time and was afraid that I could not remember the content and location of the hotel's value-added services. He even edited a text and sent it to me, so that I could open it at any time. The weather in Guangzhou has been quite hot recently. When I checked in, the young lady brought me tea and towel. The cold juice and cold towel made my tiredness dissipate a lot. I feel that their working a**osphere is also very good. My little sister and brother, and Xiao Lin is really a woman like the wind, so it makes people feel that there is no sense of distance, and she is very kind. Not long after I checked in, Xiaolin also helped me prepare a fresh fruit plate. He said that the weather is hot and can replenish water and vitamins. I was really moved again. It turned out that friends recommended it for a reason. There are many more around the hotel. You can go shopping in the shopping mall. If you don‚Äôt want to go far, there is a Tianhui square nearby. There are many things to shop in. There is a lot of clothing to buy on the negative floor, as well as other large and small jewelry boutiques. , For example: Swarovski, Bubble Mart, etc. Of course, what I have to say is the Hey Tea shop, which is really unique. There are queues every day, and there are really a lot of people. Another is that Xiaolin said that if anyone wants to do nucleic acid, he can go to the nearest Liede Community Service Center or Maternal and Child Health Hospital. These two places are currently relatively close to nucleic acid sites. Send me the location and time. Now, I went to Xiaolin in the evening and recommended a Cantonese restaurant. The taste is really good and it feels very authentic. The hotel is downstairs close to the Pearl River. Take a walk at night and see the night view of the Pearl River. It's beautiful. There is a food street downstairs of the hotel. There is a lot of traffic and it's lively~ I came back to the room very late. When I walked into the room, I saw the steam eye mask and the warm reminder card on the table~ After taking a bath, you can bring a comfortable sleep, really I have prepared a lot for my sleep quality~ Hahahahahaha, I am very happy, there are some free toiletries in the room, it is really a lazy person's benefit, and I tried it and it feels good, and finally, it is really good. I am happy to meet Xiaolin, a warm little girl. I will continue to choose this hotel next time I stay, and I will also recommend it to my friends. The service attitude of the staff is serious, thoughtful and attentive! I really recommend it ~ value for money! Give them a like and comment! Hope this hotel can get better and better and provide us with better service and living environment!

msg:I came to Guangzhou to play with my girlfriends and chose the elegant hotel. The location is very good, and it is convenient to go anywhere. When I get off the hotel, I see a sign on the first floor, because during the epidemic, the concierge on the first floor saw the health code after reading the health code. Only let us in, we did a good job of epidemic prevention, and then went to the air lobby on the 28th floor to check in. As soon as I arrived in the lobby, a tall and thin girl greeted me and said to me good afternoon, madam, welcome home, and when I checked in, I brought towels and tea to my girlfriend and me, and introduced the hotel's additional services to me. After checking in, the lady saw that we had a lot of things, and she kindly took us into the room and introduced us to the facilities of the room. Knowing that we came to play, she also introduced the nearby specialties, places to play and places to go shopping. The introduction was very comprehensive, and it was only in the later conversation that I found out that the young lady was called Xinxin. The young lady was afraid that we would have a hard journey, so I went back to work after the introduction. After the young lady left, my girlfriend and I took a serious look at the room. The decoration style is also very elegant, which is in line with the elegant name! Especially in the room, the hotel will prepare a disposable face towel, makeup remover, and a lotion mask, two sets of pajamas and robes, it really feels like coming home! Moreover, the curtains are movable, and the room does not need to be plugged in. It is really smart and convenient. After a rest, I went out to play with my girlfriends. When I came back at night, I saw the fruit, coconut milk and mango that Miss Xin Xin in the room gave us. Ximilu, the weather in Guangzhou is relatively hot these two days. I came back from playing for an afternoon and saw the fruits and desserts in the room. Is there any ice that can be used to apply ice? After she learned about the situation, she did not expect to bring not only ice, but also Yunnan Baiyao spray. I don't know where she bought it in such a short time. After spraying medicinal ice for a while, My best friend's feet were swollen slowly, and it wasn't that serious anymore. She also left the spray for us so that we could take the medicine on time. Before leaving, the housekeeper Xin Xin said that you can contact her on WeChat at any time if there is anything. They are all in the hotel. If they are not, they will try their best to help solve the problem. The service is really good! In the evening, Xin Xin asked on WeChat if her best friend's feet were any better. It was really heartwarming to be cared about so much when she was out of town. Later, she even sent me and my best friend good night milkü•õ, let's be fine Fall asleep, ask which hotel can do such a caring service? Special thanks to Miss Xin Xin for her thoughtful consideration and thoughtful arrangements for the guests. I am also very grateful to every employee of the hotel for making our trip very meaningful. We will definitely recommend it to those around us. Friends, I will definitely stay again next time!

As soon as we checked in on the 28th floor, the butler warmly received us, took our luggage, provided us with tea and towel service, and reminded us that we need to show our health code and itinerary card due to the epidemic. During the chat during the check-in period, I realized that this is Xiaoyan, the customer service housekeeper.

When the room was full, I saw that I could book various room types on Ctrip. I had no problem with my attitude, but I felt a little uncomfortable being cheated. Also, when I checked in, I told me that I would say fruit at night, but I waited for a long time. I asked the housekeeper on WeChat, and the housekeeper said that you don‚Äôt have any in this room. I‚Äôll send you a private copy. The last problem is that the morning and afternoon tea in the package is basically nothing to eat, and the awkward plates of cakes and fruits have no quality at all.

msg:I booked a river view room. I took the elevator directly from the underground garage to the lobby floor of the 28th floor at about 2:30 in the afternoon (convenient parking and convenient transportation). The front desk felt a bit crude and did not match the grade of a five-star hotel. The staff told us that the room has not been cleaned, it is estimated that it will take 40 to 50 minutes and suggested that we wait in the lobby bar first, and there is a free coffee break. The lobby bar is a bit chaotic, the staff did not clean up the carpets that were soiled by the guests in time, and the afternoon tea snacks were extremely common and there were few varieties. Regardless of the front desk and the afternoon tea area, the place was cramped and not comfortable enough.
The gym is very small, not half the size of the four seasons, and there is no swimming pool.
After waiting for the room to be cleaned for more than 40 minutes, after negotiation, another room was arranged. The area should be about the same size. Maybe there is no one who is still cleaning the room. The sand, Linjiang Avenue, and several bridges next to each other are very clean under the scouring of the rainy day, and the small waist has been shrouded in the haze of smoke and rain. I hadn't slept well at night for a long time. Although the hotel mattress was too soft, I fell asleep and fell asleep until the lights on the riverside gradually came on around 7:00. The biggest highlight of elegance is this invincible river view. If the weather is good, it is estimated that the sunrise and sunset landscape will be more charming. The 68-square-meter room is quite comfortable, with a cloakroom, changing shoes and chairs, a small living room, a comfortable viewing couch by the window (you can lie down with your husband and watch the landscape for a long time), the bathroom is reasonably designed, spacious enough, and a smart toilet Not bad, the room has a window.
In the evening, no one delivered the late-night bowl of noodles mentioned in the order. My husband went downstairs to the convenience store to buy something to eat. When he came back, he said that he saw a lot of people coming in and out of the bar next to them without masks. Some people did not wear masks when they entered the hotel elevator. , a little scary.
Miraculously, I slept until after nine in the morning, and I only had half an hour to go to the restaurant for breakfast, so I didn't have many choices, so I just wanted to eat something.
After breakfast, I walked downstairs. Although the entrance of the hotel is not too tall, the square in front of the hotel is quite big.
When you are tired, go to the elegant daze and watch the sunrise and sunset of the river view and the lights at night. Shopping in Tianhui Plaza next to it is very healing.
By the way, the service is very good, this is to be appreciated.
a nice weekend.

Having stayed in so many hotels, I have never stayed in one with such poor hygiene!
The experience of staying for almost 2,000 yuan a night is simply too bad!
On Friday, June 10, I picked up the room after 3:00 pm, and when I opened the door, I found a pile of dust and hair on the ground, and then there was a used toothpick on the ground! And when I made a reservation, I already asked the hotel through Ctrip's customer service, saying that they would arrange a crib, a baby bathtub and a baby bottle sterilizer, but when I got to the room, I asked the service desk, they said there was no baby bottle sterilizer at all, and then I called the service desk. You can't ask a single question even if you stop and turn around. In fact, the customer who called the service desk has already explained the question again. Why can't the waiter tell the relevant depar**ent again? Is it annoying to have to ask the customer to repeat the question every time after finishing the question and then transfer the line to another depar**ent? Later, when the service provider brought the bath tray, a cleaning aunt passed by. We told her that the ground was dirty, so she picked up the toothpick, dust and hair with her bare hands and left. At that time, we thought it was just a one-night stay, and then I was sitting on the sofa by the window to rest, but then I smelled the odor of acid soaking. It turned out to be from their pillow. When I opened the folder on the stage and looked at the hotel information, I found a first-hand letter. The letter left by the guest, I felt very disgusting after all these things happened. I didn‚Äôt want to stay in the room anymore. Take us to another room. At that time, they also sent a bubble machine to my child. They wanted to appease us. After we accepted it, we went out, but when we returned to the room at night, we found that someone else was using it on the countertop. The used double eyelid was stuck on it. At that time, I was too tired to contact the hotel. Then, when I was packing my luggage the next morning and planning to use the reusable bag provided in the room, I found a used mask inside. In fact, the opportunity has already been given, and the room has been changed, but the changed one turned out to be very dirty. The room of about 2,000 yuan should not have such poor conditions. Even if it happened once, it should never happen again, especially Now during the pandemic! When I finally checked out, I told the check-out waiter, she was just helpless and didn't say anything and gave no comfort. Finally, another waiter came over and took a bag of snacks and said she wanted to give it to us. On the way, we always hope that we will tolerate their mistakes this time, and then tell me that these mistakes are made because their interns are cleaning the room these days. Next time we book a room, we will give us a better price. Let me ask this Would anyone want to live with poor hygiene? Will the customer accept such an answer? When so many things happened, I just gave us a bag of snacks and wanted to settle the problem. If you really want to live, you have to be mentally prepared. It's really 10 points dirty inside!

However, the hotel does not have a swimming pool, which is a bit of a flaw.

msg:The first time I stayed at this hotelüè®The overall environment is not bad, the main location is good, the best location to see the Canton Tower. Children are also very happy to play with water on their waists. The robot ü§ñÔ∏è that delivers things in the hotel is the children's favorite. But what makes me a little scared is that during the two-day stay during the epidemic, I didn't ask to see the health code üòÇ, (my family of four checked into the hotel with a 24-hour health code) ü§¨. I saw a lot of young internet celebrities walking through the hotel, and downstairs is the hottest bar in Guangzhou! The flow of people can be imagined. However, since going up and down the stairs is free to come and goüò†, you can directly reach each floor by entering the elevatorüõó (staying in a five-star hotel is particularly insecure).
When talking about the so-called afternoon tea package in the hotel, there are very few snacks and the taste is very ordinary. Apart from the advantage of seeing the scenery, this is the worst hotel snack I have ever eaten.
There is also the hotel buffet breakfast, there are too few varieties, it is not like the five-star standard at all üòì, the noodles are doll noodles and they are not delicious üëé bean curd and double skin milk are mixed, not fresh products made by the hotel chef that day at all , This is in Guangzhou, how can dim sum desserts be so foolish ü•µ. There are also very few other things. We went downstairs at about 9 o'clock and had nothing to eatüòÖ, the room is almost 2k, and the most basic five-star breakfast can't be satisfied, which is disappointing. If you just want to take pictures and see the scenery, it's really goodüëå, but don't think about what to eat, it's better to buy breakfast at the bakery downstairs.

msg:The first room had a strong smell of smoke, and the front desk on the phone came up immediately to change the room;
The tea in the room turned out to be moldy. There are two capsules of coffee in the room (expiring soon), but there is no capsule coffee machine. The snack bar at the front desk brought a latte.
There were two very old "pajamas" hanging in the closet, almost scared to death, thinking that the room was already occupied by someone else;
Half of the makeup water and makeup remover lotion is used on the sink. Under such a serious epidemic situation, I can't believe that this is the equipment provided by a star-rated hotel. I called to verify and asked for a small bottle and said that it could not be provided. How many people have touched it.
The whole room makes people feel like there are still people living in it and not checking out.
Someone in the room is watching TV, but the second person scans the room card and comes in, the system restarts directly, and the TV closes and opens the curtains. This "smart" is a bit out of time and affects the experience.
Sanitation and facilities are really not keeping up, not worth the price.

The hotel is located near Zhujiang New Town, in Tiande Square, and downstairs is Tiande Commercial Street. It is very convenient to eat. The location is very good and very popular. The SPACE PLUS nightclub is downstairs, which is very suitable for young people to play. There is also IGC Tianhui Plaza around, shopping, eating, drinking and playing. Before checking in, I received a call from the hotel customer service manager, Nini, to know my arrival time and help arrange the room. I specially upgraded the river view room, and added WeChat to get any questions in time. What was especially surprising was that Nini knew that today was my birthday, and arranged for a birthday cake to be delivered to the room at night. Check-in is in the sky lobby on the 28th floor, LOBBY can drink afternoon tea, and there is an afternoon tea package that can be purchased for a fee to take pictures and punch in. Very NICE! There is a complimentary afternoon tea buffet, including porridge, bread cakes, biscuits, fruits and so on. Canton Tower and Liede Bridge have a panoramic view. The hotel lobby also provides guests with ladies rubber bands, issuing cards, brown sugar ginger tea, beauty contact solution, disposable raincoats, steam eye masks, etc. The hotel service is very considerate! The butler will also provide towels and drinks during check-in. The check-in efficiency at the front desk is also very efficient. There are also fluid bears sold at the front desk, and the price is also very affordable. There are two types of dyed and dyed available for purchase. There is a gym and spa on the 28th floor. The gym has just been upgraded and expanded for free use. The elevator needs to swipe the room card. The curtains open automatically when you arrive in the room, and Xiaoman's waist comes into view. There are welcome fruits and snacks prepared by Nini on the table. In the afternoon, Nini also delivered sugar water to the room. Very practical and hygienic! There are also bathrobes and pajamas in the room, and there is a cosmetic bag in the washstand, which contains all kinds of facial cleanser, water emulsion, perfume, gel, etc., because I mentioned to Nini on WeChat that I will spend the evening with friends at the livehouse next to me. On the birthday, when I go back to the bedside of the room, I have the good night milk and honey water specially prepared by Nini, as well as the thoughtful turndown service, and I have prepared a foot bath, which is really super thoughtful! Really experience what it's like to be home at the elegant hotel! The mattress is very comfortable, and you can sleep very well. There are two types of pillows, one is a down pillow, and the other is a latex pillow, both high and low! When I woke up, I also saw Nini's message on WeChat, reminding the weather conditions, UV level and helping with late check-out. She was very considerate and meticulous. I am very grateful to the housekeeper Nini for her thoughtful arrangements and care during the stay. I really experienced five The professional service that a star-rated hotel should have, I will definitely recommend it to my friends to come and stay!

msg:I came to Guangzhou with my boyfriend to play for five days. I heard from friends that the elegant hotel has good service and a good location. It is across the river from Xiaoman Yao, so I specially booked the elegant hotel to experience it. The hotel is located in Tiande Square, the core area of Zhujiang New Town CBD, facing Guangzhou's landmark Xiaomanyao, overlooking the Liede Bridge, and sitting on the first-line river view. Downstairs is the nightclub SPACE PLUS, surrounded by IGC Tianhui Square, K11 , AutoNavi Land Plaza, etc., are very friendly to babies who come to Guangzhou to travel. Check-in is in the sky lobby on the 28th floor. Once we arrive at the lobby, the staff warmly greets us. The housekeeper Shirley receives us. Towels and hot tea are prepared when checking in at the front desk. Warm to the bottom of my heart, I very enthusiastically introduced the afternoon tea and late-night snacks provided by the hotel, as well as the time and place of breakfast. The lobby also thoughtfully prepared emergency medicines, masks, girls' hair ties, issuing cards, cotton pads, disposable raincoats, etc. , I have stayed in five hotels in Guangzhou, and I have not encountered such attentive service. Because I came early, the room was not cleaned at that time, I added the WeChat of the housekeeper Shirley, and helped us to send the luggage back to the room first, and recommended the surrounding shopping districts and shops for food. I have to say that the location is excellent, downstairs It is the food street, there are many Internet celebrity check-in points, and the recommended food on the Guangzhou must-eat list, which is very convenient for shopping and leisure. The room has a large area of floor-to-ceiling windows, the sunlight can directly pour into the room, and the a**osphere of a bustling building can be seen through the window. In the minibar refrigerator in the room, there are free Wanglaoji, apple cider vinegar drinks, cola mineral water, etc., as well as coffee machines and coffee capsules, etc. In particular, free facial masks, skin care products and perfumes are also prepared, even face towels It is a one-time non-woven fabric. When the TV is turned on, it will display the words that welcome XX to go home. It is a very distinctive hotel. It can be seen that it attaches great importance to customers! The bedding is very comfortable. There are two types of pillows, one is a high soft pillow and the other is a relatively flat latex pillow. It is very comfortable to sleep in. After checking in, I also received welcome fruit and welcome sugar water specially arranged by the housekeeper Shirley. Nice! There is a self-service laundry room on the 35th floor. Thick clothes take a long time to dry. During this period, Shirley, the housekeeper, has arranged to follow up, and they will not be sent back to the room until they are dried. The service is particularly considerate and thoughtful. The breakfast is rich in variety, both Chinese and Western, and there is a riverside location where you can see Xiaomanyao. What is worth mentioning is the service. When I checked out, I left things in the room. Shirley, the housekeeper, helped to send them back in time. Thank you very much. I was very happy this time. The service of Shirley, the housekeeper, was very warm and caring. Help to solve, the price is very high, it is worth living!

The elevator is also very advanced. I admit that I am low. It's small and the layout is not very good. Maybe Guangzhou, a place with an inch of land and a lot of money, can only do this. The front desk staff are more enthusiastic, and the butler service may not be as intimate as Sanya. It's not a resort hotel after all.
The epidemic is serious, basically staying in the hotel, not daring to go out, the facilities and equipment are relatively complete, there are all kinds of facial cleanser, makeup remover, and lotion,
A bowl of noodles for a single person late at night is really a bit unpalatable. Not as good as porridge.

msg:In Guangzhou, Elegance Hotel is one of the few new hotels among the brand hotels; it is located in Tiande Square in Zhujiang New Town, facing Xiaomanyao across the river;
The style of the hotel is modern and fashionable, as its name suggests, elegant and delicate, with nearly 50 square meters of bays and spacious floor-to-ceiling windows, on the one hand, you can easily enjoy the invincible river view and the rotten night view, and at the same time make the room refreshing and bright;
Needless to say, the hotel's service is polite and warm, and it is also very considerate;
In short, the experience is very good, and I will definitely book here next time;

msg:Housing experience: extremely poor, one of the worst star hotels I have ever stayed in, no one.

First of all, before checking in, I called the hotel's customer service FAQ, but the hotel customer service refused directly. Later, the Ctrip housekeeper called and apologized, saying that the customer service did not know much. I really wanted to ask how the hotel was trained. After all, staying in the hotel is for your enjoyment, not to be angry, to put forward a demand for occupancy, I hope the upper floor is a little higher, the lobby is 28th floor, and I live at 29th. Is it high?
2. On the day of check-in, the lobby is not big, and there is no clerk upset. It is very disordered. Whoever is quicker will rush over and come to the top. During the check-in process, especially the guest communicated with the front desk, and the result was blown up. After another round of observation, nothing happened. Seeing how polite the front desk was, a female clerk came to the rescue later.

On the day I left the store, I saw a female customer making noise again, saying that she was not honest

3. The dining table in the lobby for guests to rest has not been collected. It is very dirty. It looks like a five-star. After observing for ten or twenty minutes, no one has cleaned it.

4. When we entered the gym, there was a cleaning aunt who opened her mouth: where did you come from? You have to live in the store to enter. I am really curious to ask, how did you train? Have a firm foothold in Guangzhou CBD? ! If we don't live in the store, what are we doing in here? If you are worried that an outsider will come in, should you find someone to register at the door instead of speaking rudely.

4. There are handprints on the windows of the room. We arranged some small balloons on the ground. When we left, the front desk said there was no problem, so we just left. We called after half an hour and said that we needed to charge 200 yuan for cleaning fees. Do not say it? What is this operation? After we went to the store again to respond to a series of situations, we said it was ok.

5. Before leaving, I saw a staff member pushing a dining car in the passenger elevator. There were at least ten dishes of dishes in it, without any cover. The food was placed on the passenger elevator and there was no protection. The hygiene and epidemic prevention of your hotel also made it difficult. I'm worried. Fortunately, I didn't eat in the store. During the epidemic, I could be so negligent.

The only feature here is: the river view, it's really good, I really can't find any good places in other places

The picture of the room is also in line with the actual situation. It was supposed to have a bathtub, but it turned out not to be.

There really won't be a second time! ! I should believe the reviews. Some reviews say that the reviews are bad. I'm too naive.

The stay experience feels good, the room is big, the night view is quite good

Here are the points where the details are added
1 The hotel housekeeper will personally deliver fruit and sugar water to the door if necessary.
2 bedside with free mask
3 more than other five-star hotels, perfume, makeup remover, water lotion, gel cream, face towel (this is the gospel of the delicate pigs who are oblivious, hahaha, but I personally recommend that you use your own if you have it. [laughing])
4 Hahahaha, there are 6 bottles of mineral water [break the tears for a laugh] [break the tears for a laugh], I can't finish drinking it. Normally I see 2
By the way, there are also free late-night pasta (22:00-2:00 on the 4th floor), and free afternoon tea in the sky‚òïÔ∏è (10:00-22:00 on the 28th floor) The scenery is beautiful, it's really good, [ Tears are broken for laughter] Afternoon tea is normal, and taking pictures is great.
Pretty much everything else
Final experience summary report
It just feels normal, mainly because of my boyfriend's intentions and the super VIP service he gave me throughout the whole process, so that my experience will not feel so disappointing. Anyway, I won't live there again.

By the way, the smell of this hotel, I don't know how to describe it, it really doesn't smell that good.

Sister Xiaofen at the front desk is good and deserves praise! I will definitely poach her when I open a hotel in the future.
There is also the buffet ceiling that the public commented on on the fourth floor. I think it is to shoot the team to eat food that is usually not eaten on the street. 398 yuan, 300 yuan per person is the fee for viewing the tower.

I think the publicity is very good, but in fact, except for the very good service attitude when checking in, it seems that the attitude started to change.

A bowl of noodles late at night is just a bowl of noodles. I don‚Äôt think there are so many delicious afternoon teas posted by ** bloggers. The afternoon tea is just average. The locations with good views are all reserved. I think they are just for the consumption crowd and there is no room for us housing crowds to enjoy them. The seats are a bit internet-famous. The hotel is opposite the IGC. It is very convenient. Now you can use your room card to go to the buffet. In the evening, there is a bar where you can exchange for two cocktails to feel the a**osphere. When I checked out, it was like chasing people away. I enjoyed it after checking out. A man at the afternoon tea front desk said that the room has to be checked out at 2 o'clock and parking is only free until 2 o'clock? ? ? It's really big, but it's not necessary.

The hotel is relatively üÜï, the environment and room design are very satisfactory to my heart, the river view is booked, the view of the room and the bathtub are very open, and you can see the Liede Bridge. There is no need to talk about the hardware facilities, but the management part needs to be talked about.

The hotel lobby is set on the 28th floor. After check-in, the elevator can pass through any floor above the 28th floor by swiping the card. According to the day before yesterday, except for 2 when you checked in, you were asked to read the itinerary code. The rest of the time was free to enter and exit. It was all on your own initiative (for example, when you checked in for your girlfriend later, you did not actively ask to show the itinerary code). During the epidemic, at least the green code must be shown at the entrance and exit of the hotel, and the reception at the entrance and exit on the first floor needs to be more careful.

For the dining part, the booked package includes buffet afternoon tea, two supper and buffet breakfast. Supper did not go. Afternoon tea and breakfast are also the guests consciously. Afternoon tea is on the 28th floor. The dining period is from afternoon to night. No room registration is required for entry and exit. Yes; breakfast on the 4th floor, 7-10 in the morning, a room card registration, when I entered the restaurant, I was seated quite full, no one took a seat to rely on self-reliance, we wandered around the dining area for two rounds to find a place, when we were hesitant, we were caught by a hotel The staff found out and gestured to go the other direction, only to realize that because there were too many people, they used the hall next to it...the embarrassment and chaos of no one to take a seat, the management of star-rated hotels might have to be added. Hard work.

Other details, such as calling the service desk and asking about the bathtub cover, the other party does not seem to know which room the demand comes from; for example, "Pretend to be Jinsha" in Figure 4 welcome snacks. Btw's birthday check-in usually has intimate details, even if it is warm greetings and congratulations, there are points. Stars are not just hardware facilities, hotel management directly determines guest experience, and there is plenty of room for elegant improvement.

As soon as you enter the lobby, the young lady at the front desk and the younger brother are very friendly, especially Comrade Xiao Luo. I introduced us to the surrounding environment, the fruit and milk drinks were delivered to the door in person, the special enthusiasm, the feeling of being at home, and my girlfriends recognized the elegant hotel, and I will come to this hotel when I stay in Guangzhou in the future, and there is free breakfast and supper in the morning and afternoon. Tea, the check-in experience is very good, one word description value

msg:üöó Transportation: Located on Tiande Square, with a small waist and a view of the east and west towers

üçÉEnvironment: You can see the waist in some rooms. This time I stayed in the deluxe bay view room. The bedroom is diagonally opposite to the east and west tower, and the waist in the bathroom can be seen at the very edge.

üßπHygienic: Although it is open in 2020, some facilities are obviously old due to materials.

üîîService: When entering the check-in lobby, a waiter took the initiative to hand over wet face towels and drinks, but did not take the initiative to help with luggage. The cleaning aunt is very polite and will greet her when she passes by.

I have never thought of staying in an elegant hotel, but I can‚Äôt help Dianping and Ctrip‚Äôs beautiful pictures of Meitu, so I chose to experience it on the weekend.
All the beautiful longings stayed in front of the door. The first impression was a sigh of the hotel, which was only over a year old, why the facilities are so old, the watermarks on the glass coffee table at the door, the whitening of the upturned sofa on the windows... Then proceed to the bathroom and bathtub. The design and landscape are indeed impeccable, but when you turn around and look closely, you will find many reusable care products (which can be called public goods), even cotton towels can be used continuously (although environmentally friendly but not hygienic), mirrors The above time is wrong, and the hair dryer really does not want to complain. Even the Express Hotel uses at least Panasonic. This... the toilet roll paper is placed directly, so if you use it, you must have used the previous guests. The whole roll of paper is used in your hand.

Borrowing a customer‚Äôs comment, this hotel has a five-star location, but it does not have a five-star configuration. Previously, I felt that the most decent hotel in Guangzhou was the Ritz-Carlton, until I stayed at Jumeirah last time.

Now that I think about it,
Jumeirah is really comprehensive, and the elegance seems beyond reach.

üßπHygiene: I think hygiene can still be given a score of 85 or more
üîîService: The hotel staff service is very good,
üöó Transportation: The traffic is particularly convenient, but the bustling city center must be traffic jam during peak hours. It must be okay to stay before the traffic jam.
The downstairs dining street, eating street, bar, convenience store are all very convenient. Young people have fun
Facilities: As for the Dyson hair dryer, a person with long hair has always felt that it is not that important and it is not commonly used at home. I think it is not a disadvantage that star-rated hotels do not have Dyson. The only downside is that there is no swimming pool. This is still a pity, otherwise, I might stay one more night.
Overall, I will choose this hotel next time.

If you don‚Äôt see the small waist in a straight line, there are more than 2,600. I think the elegant room type depends on the small waist and The night view of the entire Zhujiang New Town is more three-dimensional and shocking, with a panoramic view! The hotel also offers free afternoon tea, supper, bar drink experience and other items. The value of more than 1,700 is simply superb, and the equipment and facilities in the room are modern, clean and tidy, and the service is very user-friendly and considerate. There are free drinks and fruits. , Xiao Zheng, the special housekeeper, will answer all questions and reply promptly. There is a food street below the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping and foraging. I will continue to choose to stay in this hotel!
Ps: The only regret is the breakfast, the variety is a little less, and it ends too early, I hope it needs to be improved!

The five-star price only comes with a five-star location ‚≠ïÔ∏è
The rest are one-star service and one-star configuration ‚ùå

üçÉEnvironment: The geographical location is as shown in the figure, it is indeed very advantageous. The hotel lobby is on the 28th floor and there are only four front desks. There are a lot of people crowded in there. The afternoon tea place is next door to the front desk: dirty and messy. The configuration of the room: hair dryers, TV sets, so-called intimate skin care products, etc. are all miscellaneous. Fortunately, I booked a deluxe river-view big bed room. The bathroom is separated from the next room, otherwise the clear dialogue in the next room can be heard all night. No soundproofing was done at all, it was so noisy.

üîîService: The five-star standard of your hotel is really low, and the service standard of each employee is different. It is clear that the check-in is three o'clock, but the check-in is only half past four. I asked four or five front desks and the answers were different. One of them was too much to shirk responsibility to colleagues in other depar**ents.

üßπHygiene: Following the topic of late check-in in the previous paragraph, the hotel front desk replied to me because "our hotel has a set of standard hygiene procedures". As a result, when I entered the room, I smelled a strong smell of tobacco. The tenants smoked in the room without deodorizing, and the tables, stools, and bedside tables were covered with a thick layer of dust. This is the so-called standardized hygiene process of Yazhi.

The "bowl of noodles" for supper in the evening is really a bowl of noodles without any side dishes. . . Such a mediocre diet made me unable to appetite for breakfast the next day, and I was very disappointed.

For the same price, I advise you to go to Jumeirah, Four Seasons, Magnificent, and Ritz-Carlton next door. The five-star price of Home Inn is better than its experience. It is not worth the waste of money, and it is not worth the money.

The butler Ronaldinho was really great, responsive and very attentive. He asked about the decanter and ice cubes last night, and it came quickly. In the end, he was afraid that there were not enough ice cubes, so he sent a big bag of ice cubes again. In general, next time I will still choose elegant, and give the housekeeper Ronaldinho a big praise

msg:The service is very good, worthy of the standard of a five-star hotel or above~ The service staff is humane, friendly, and full of service.
The hotel facilities are also good, clean and hygienic. The only complaint is that the accessories in the bathroom are too poor. Only the body wash, shampoo, and conditioner is L‚ÄôOccitane, and there are a lot of other large bottles of makeup remover that can‚Äôt be taken away. Milk and other things are all messy names. Really, such a good hotel shouldn't be equipped with such low-grade supplies... The grade is lowered a lot at once~ And the mattress is too soft for my wife, I don't know how other people are.
In general, it is worth staying again, because the view is indeed perfect, and the dinner buffet is also perfect! It should be almost the most cost-effective in the five-star hotel I have eaten, it tastes good, and the variety is OK~
Finally, let me talk about their services. When you check in, a hotel butler will contact you. If you have anything, you can consult her to find out and solve it. This is a very humane and authentic thing, which makes me feel a little homestay style. ~Call my housekeeper Huang Yuan~ It solved some of my small problems very well, ok~

msg:I am very happy to choose to stay at Guangzhou Elegant Hotel. The location is very good, mainly because I came here and stayed in a river-view big bed room, which I used to propose to my girlfriend. I called the hotel for consultation before I first came to check in. After a while, I added it to the WeChat of the housekeeper Annie. I consulted in July and moved in in September. During the period, the housekeeper Annie was very attentive and intimately told me how the room layout should be designed. Bring a friend to the room. Arrange together. During the whole process, I have encountered some difficult things with my friends. Haha, but in order to give my future wife an unforgettable memory, the hard work is also worth it. Our common good memories, Annie She was very careful to tell us how to arrange and display. She was very warm and cheerful and provided various tools. In short, it was great. My girlfriend and I had a romantic marriage proposal. The hotel is near the Guangzhou Tower. It‚Äôs great, I especially recommend staying in. You must remember to contact Annie butler, because she really helped us very hard. Unfortunately, she missed our marriage proposal and said to take a small video to help us record it. Haha, breakfast is on the fourth floor. The restaurant is a combination of Chinese and Western self-service, and the room is also very intimate. There are women‚Äôs skin care products and makeup remover. The theme of this hotel is to feel at home. We have experienced it. It is very warm. Annie said that you can come here when you get married. , There is a special memory, in short, a very good experience and experience!

msg:I booked the 1171 package product on Ctrip (one night city view room, afternoon tea, late night and one evening meal). My wife arrived at 2pm on Friday, but failed to talk to the front desk and failed to give a room with Guangzhou Tower view. Instead, it was arranged in a room facing the ancestral hall of Liede Village on the other side. I didn't get the view of the Canton Tower. Basically, this journey was broken.

When I arrived late at night, Tiande Square was crowded with people. The doorman at the door of the hotel might not be able to distinguish the special car to send off the passengers.

There is a view on the first floor of the hotel to take pictures of the Guangzhou Tower. It is very good. You can refer to Figure 8. The bad experience is that it takes a long time to wait for the elevator.

Go to the air front desk on the 28th floor to check in. The waiter said that he could help deliver the luggage to the room. The view on the 28th floor is still good, you can take part in Picture 4. But many girls take pictures, if you are willing to wait, you can make a film. If you are impatient, it may not be suitable.

Let‚Äôs talk about the room itself. It may be because of the basic room type. There is no bathtub. The panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows have a very good view. The sofa is equipped with tea sets. The room provides three kinds of tea, which is very pleasant. The bathroom accessories are L‚ÄôOccitane, which is very good.

The robot is very busy, it can help deliver food, and can also help pick up the spare parts, the waiting time will not be too long.

Finally, make a small complaint, because my wife left first, I packed up before checking out. The standard toiletry bag on the wash table and my wife's toiletry bag are very similar in color and style, and they were accidentally packed into the suitcase. .
So later, when I met my wife again in the next hotel to pack the luggage together, my wife realized that she had brought the bathroom bag from the elegant hotel. Although the room was refunded and the deposit was refunded, there is no loss even if we don‚Äôt return it, but none of us are people who love to take advantage of it. It‚Äôs too low, so I called the hotel specifically and I said sorry, but I didn‚Äôt intend to put the toiletry bag. Take it away, do I need to send it back? Okay, weird response came... First, the hotel switchboard said that they are not responsible for this, and help you transfer to the housekeeping depar**ent, and you can ask yourself (I have 10,000 horses in my heart üê¥ rushed past... Could it be me? I beg you to return such a worthless toiletry bag...), and then, the housekeeping depar**ent said on the phone that it would be delivered by express. The toiletry bag items can only be used in the room, as it should be... .. I was also convinced enough, and I was treated directly from a customer to a supplier... No one from the two depar**ents said thank you...

How do I feel? It's definitely not too good

msg:Choosing an elegant hotel for the first time, the experience of staying is quite happy. Before I checked in, I called to ask if there is a cake gift. If you want to bring the elderly over for birthdays, it will make the elderly happier. The front desk told the housekeeper that he would call back later. There was a delay in the process, but Xiaoliang, the housekeeper, contacted us. Xiao Liang knew that we had waited a long time for the call, apologized to us, and explained that there might be omissions in the busy Friday, and added WeChat to follow up as soon as possible, a very kind girl. After checking in, I found that Xiaoliang had selected us rooms with good location and scenery, all facing the Canton Tower. He also coordinated to help us simply decorate the room and presented small cakes to the elderly. It was really hard. After adding WeChat, the docking is very convenient. Xiao Liang will send me the time and place of the meal in text. The rules of the gym, the laundry room, and the driving license plate are clear at a glance, and he is very careful. I learned about the barbecue package before and learned that this package is newly launched. It feels good to watch the menu and video. Come and experience it next time. Their buffet is also quite popular. I haven‚Äôt eaten it yet, but I heard that it is good, with many varieties and freshness. It looks very appetizing. The trouble is because it‚Äôs too hot, and you need to make reservations in advance, especially on Saturdays. The Japanese position is basically full. The check-in day is Saturday. I heard that the room is full of Elegant. Xiao Liang reminded me to have breakfast earlier, otherwise there will be a lot of people. This is very considerate. A friend recommended me to come here for a newly opened hotel. Although it has some shortcomings, it is good overall. Classmate Xiao Liang is careful and conscientious, and answers every question. She is very good in all aspects. I like her service!

msg:There are many advantages, and everything a five-star hotel should have is basically equipped. Two points stand out: 1. The geographical environment is too superior. Zhujiang New Town is prosperous, with invincible river views, with panoramic views, just within walking distance. 2. Pay attention to details and provide considerate service.
Disadvantages: 1. The lobby on the 28th floor of the hotel is full of Internet celebrities who come to check in and take pictures. All kinds of exposed clothing, scratching heads and posing, chaotic order, make people feel like entering the nightclub, directly lowering the positioning and quality of the hotel. I understand that the new hotel wants to start a brand, but I hope not to position itself as an Internet celebrity hotel, especially not to rely on Internet celebrity live broadcasts to hype, you have the capital and the strength to become a high-end luxury hotel. 2. The sound insulation is too poor, which is definitely a flaw in the design and decoration. The voices of the people in the corridor were clearly heard, and I kept hearing the sound of the TV in the next room at night, and couldn't help but call to complain, and then turned off the TV next door. Understand that others have the freedom to watch TV late at night, but good hotels should ensure that every guest can be comfortable in their facilities.

msg:Choosing to stay at Guangzhou Yazhi Hotel at the age of 25 is really full of surprises!
During the epidemic, I dared not go outside for my birthday, because I was a native of Guangzhou and knew better about hotels around Guangzhou. I stayed in many hotels in Tianhe business district and finally decided on an elegant hotel. The reason was to invite friends over. Of course, I had to choose. A place with great views!
The scenery of the elegant hotel is famous. Although it is not surprising to be born in Guangzhou, the a**osphere must be in place and the scenery must be selected. My boyfriend booked me a river-view big bed room. We called in advance to ask if there is a free decoration. The front desk told me that there is no free decoration starting this year, but this is understandable. We later invited a professional team to arrange it, and the cost was acceptable.
After I came to the hotel and checked in, my friends came with me, and when I opened the door, I was full of surprises! Friends from other places like the scenery of this hotel very much. There is a small waist in front of you. The Pearl River cruise ship is also in front of you. You can also see the Haixin Bridge just built a few months ago. The scenery is really good. Real satisfaction!
Besides service, the service is also impeccable! Our luggage was delivered to the room by the butler's handsome boy Ronaldinho. He learned that it was our birthday and gave me a small cake and a delicate fruit! And after adding Butler Ronaldinho's WeChat, it is especially convenient to connect! Our takeaway arrived on the first floor, because the delivery staff couldn't come, so Ronaldinho helped run errands to the first floor to get it and sent it to our room. My friend bought me a small cake, Ronaldinho also helped to store it on the 28th floor. I sent him a message when I needed it, and he delivered it quickly. The efficiency is very high!
I also heard that the buffet at Linjiang Pavilion on the 4th floor of Yazhi Hotel is very good. The buffet + small hot pot sounds very appetizing. My friends and I want to eat it. I called on the 4th floor, and the restaurant on the 4th floor said that I was not sure if there was a place, and it would take a while to answer the call. I sent a WeChat message to Ronaldinho again, and asked Ronaldinho for help. It didn't take long for Ronaldinho to tell me that he had booked a position for me, and he was really happy!
Their buffet on the 4th floor is really hot and there are many people, but with a conscience, it is worth a visit! The products are good, there are many varieties of dishes, all kinds of meat are dazzling, and the supplement is also very timely. There is also an episode. I don‚Äôt know if Ronaldinho told the restaurant that it was my birthday. The staff at the restaurant brought small cakes, lit candles to celebrate my birthday, and put on my birthday. Cap, inexplicably touched, a little surprised.
For this 25th birthday, choosing an elegant hotel as a birthday venue is still very good. But if you want to have a surprise, it is best to say hello to the hotel in advance, the service is still very good.
When we left the shop that day, Ronaldinho helped to delay the check-out of the room until 14.00. We slept comfortably until noon. Although we missed breakfast, fortunately there was afternoon tea. We went for afternoon tea again before returning to the room to clean up. Check out.
There is also a staff member, Xiao Liang‚Äôs beauty, which is also very good, because my friend went out in the back, my dress couldn‚Äôt be zipped, it was not convenient to call a boy, she came up to help me fix it, and helped me take some pictures. Beautiful photos and videos are used to record the beautiful 25-year-old. The service attitude is really good!
I have already told my friends around me that you can‚Äôt go wrong to choose an elegant hotel to see the river view on your birthday!

msg:As soon as the door is opened, the curtains are automatically opened, and the TV is also turned on. It is very warm and the location is very good. It is opposite to Xiaomanyao. There is a park next to it. You can go to the Pearl River Night Cruise on foot. The Guangzhou Museum and the library are all in the surrounding area. Convenient, the hotel's environment and services are also very considerate, there are women's skin care products, and 2 facial masks are prepared. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very rich and well worth it.

msg:The breakfast type and taste are average, and the waiter is a bit indifferent. I ordered a set menu with afternoon tea. After I ordered it, I realized that it was a self-service. The variety is small and the taste is average. It is not recommended. You can book a room with breakfast separately.
Room facilities: To be honest, the bay view room is a bit tricky, the door is connected to the bedroom, it seems that the room is small and monotonous, and there is no sense of design. The bathtub next to the window is bare and decorated with flowers, which is a bit different from the photos uploaded by the hotel. Oh... the outside window is a bit dusty, plus the backlight in the room, the photos are not so good, so I can only take pictures at night... I ordered this elegantly for this window bathtub, or I would choose magnificent, the price is not There is not much difference. I was really disappointed when I entered the room... And the minibar soda at this price should be standard, but only Coke and apple cider vinegar are not friendly to some travelers.
Praise the hotel service. The staff restored my mood with their service attitude. The room smelled bad, and immediately sent me an air purifier and fruit plate. I was patient and polite in answering my questions. Takeaways can also be delivered, which is very convenient.
Little surprise: the room is actually equipped with a fascia gun, which is simply a white moonlight for fitness people and frequent travellers! I also gave a facial mask. The front desk on the 28th floor also prepared hair clips, baby warmers, earplugs and other practical small items. The small details add points and are very considerate.
The location is good, there is river view, you can see Xiaomanyao, close to Grandview Plaza, and there is a food street behind the hotel, which is more convenient.

msg:A great experience! ! ! Added money to upgrade the Bay View King Room, the original City View King Room does not have a bathtub~ The bed is very soft and comfortable~
The hotel service is very good! The price/performance ratio in the hotel at the same price is super high. The new hotel is modern and suitable for young people. The breakfast is rich and delicious!

msg:Compared to a five-star hotel with a radius of one kilometer, similar room types and packages, elegant prices are about lower than the market. Perhaps because of this, we felt that the lobby and restaurant were a bit hectic during the weekends and Sunday mornings we ate.
The gym is very sunny and it is completely unmatched by the nearby five-star hotels. Although the lobby provides free refreshments, the quality is not attractive enough, but based on the overall price, the hotel has this service and is highly affirmed.
The river-view suite we stayed in has a first-class view. This is impeccable. The room is decorated in comfortable colors. The air-conditioning system is quiet and the temperature is suitable. It‚Äôs just that the sofa‚Äôs back is facing the window view, so I have to lie on my side to face the view and then reading and listening to music. The bathroom sink has specially prepared skin care products for ladies. Very intimate!
Overall, if you want to revel in the beauty of the Pearl River and Xiaomanyao and enjoy the comfort of the room, it is recommended to stay.
The breakfast is rich in variety, but it is recommended to avoid the crowds so that you will not be disappointed.

msg:I think it‚Äôs super good. It‚Äôs better than the same room types in Four Seasons Hotel. The bathroom kits are brand-name. Give back the facial mask and cosmetic bag, which I have never had in other five-star hotels. There are also breakfast, supper, and afternoon tea. Although we only had afternoon tea, I have never seen so many meals in other hotels. Special thanks also to Steward Liang. I knew Steward Liang from other reviews. She was really good. She helped my husband decorate the room, arranged a room with a very good view for us, and booked the river view location for dinner. The service attitude is very good, very caring, and the people are beautiful! It is recommended to find Steward Liang to stay in. The only flaw is that there is a problem with the navigation of the hotel when I drive by myself. I went around that section of the road four times and ended up not eating the buffet. It is recommended that you navigate to Tiande Plaza by driving by yourself, and when you call to the front desk, it is recommended that the answering staff should be polite and patient. Praise again the beauty of Steward Liang. Do not

msg:I booked an elegant hotel on my friend‚Äôs birthday last Friday. This is not the first time I booked it. I also booked it in December last year. The origin was an elegant buffet. I thought it was cost-effective (Ignore 10,000 words here). Later I heard that there is a lady in the reservation I can help decorate the birthday set, so I booked an elegant hotel for my friend‚Äôs birthday 2 times!
Service attitude: there is nothing bad, from the moment you enter the door, all the hotel service brothers and sisters and even the cleaning aunts have a very good attitude!
Guest room: The guest room is relatively clean, no hair and cigarette butts are seen, the floor is tidy, and the bed is fresh! The hardness of the pillows and mattresses is suitable, but the length of the bed is a bit puzzled. If you have a taller figure, you may feel that there is nowhere to put a part of your feet!
Washroom: The details of the toiletries are in place, but I am puzzled that some of the cosmetics and cleaning products are public! The bathtub part is also clean!
Highlights: Robot delivery service: Just write the room number, and the takeaway will be delivered by the robot! Be sure to write the room number!
Finally, I would like to thank Miss Peng Jie, she helped me decorate it twice, the last time was the red depar**ent, this time it was the blue depar**ent, simple and grand, the communication process was very patient, careful and dedicated!

msg:The price is more expensive than the surrounding international five-stars. I thought it would be a pleasant surprise. Which is all kinds of shocks. 1. There is no bathtub for the price of nearly 1,000 yuan. When I check in, I asked if there are bath salts and disposable bathtub bags. When I arrived in the room, I found that there was no bathtub at all. 2. The so-called afternoon tea and noodles were three kinds of dry cakes sold by catty at the door of the vegetable market. The beverage was concentrated saccharin mixed with water. Don‚Äôt pretend if you don‚Äôt know afternoon tea. no appetite. 3. The air-conditioning in the corridor does not turn on, a disgusting smell of inferior perfume and musty mixed together, and I almost vomited when I walked to the room. 4. Breakfast seemed to be arranged in a row. Except for yogurt and freshly squeezed juice, the others are all produced by Express Hotel Standard, putting up a so-called cheese is like chewing flour. 5. The gym can be described as "poor." Just set up a few equipment to cope with it, and there is no swimming pool. There is nothing remarkable, it is a "national standard" wild five-star hotel with a quality of 400 or 500, using all kinds of fake marketing routines to increase the price, and the added value is the cost of 20 yuan. There is no sincerity and unprofessional hotel.

Free afternoon tea. A bowl of noodles late at night is also good! The washing supplies are also great. There are a lot of free drinks and the pure water at your fingertips is also very considerate! Comfortable real experience. The breakfast is also very good, unfortunately I don't have time to try the buffet, it is said to be super perfect! Definitely next time

msg:When I came out to play, I wanted to choose a comfortable hotel to rest. After comparing with Ctrip for a long time, I finally chose this elegant hotel that has just opened. I originally looked forward to it because I also watched a short video and recommended that it is very cost-effective. But as soon as I enter, the lobby is very general. There is no concierge service on the first floor. The reception lobby on the 28th floor is also very crowded. The breakfast is also very general. The room is not as stunning as the photo. The aisle is a bit like an express hotel. The afternoon tea is simply not I know how to describe it. They are like overnight food. There is only one movie in the room. There is no signal to fool me at the back. There is no signal on TV live broadcast. The water in the bathroom always seeps out, and the wash basins are all It‚Äôs some cosmetics that others have used. It‚Äôs better to leave them alone and dare not use them. They are all three-no products. There are coffee cups and no coffee spoons. It‚Äôs really funny. Compared with the Shangri-La, Mandarin Oriental, this Meihao‚Äôs. Yazhi is really sorry for the luxury resort hotel linked to Ctrip. I couldn‚Äôt help but complain all night. There is also a self-service laundry room in the hotel. It is really funny that only very convenient hotels have self-service laundry rooms. what.

msg:Why should I choose an elegant hotel? Why should I give this hotel good reviews?
Location: Located in the center of Guangzhou-Tiande Square, downstairs there are food courts, bars, clear bars, and various attractions are very close, within 30 minutes by car, such as Haixinsha, Guangzhou Tower ,opera
Room: I chose a stylish room with a brighter decoration. It is equipped with a lot of skin care products and is gentle to use. If I feel elegant in the future, I don‚Äôt need to bring a cosmetic bag. Hahaha, yes, really If you want to experience the river view room and fall asleep with the night view of the small waist of the Pearl River ship, you can definitely have a good dream (you can dream of the lover if you can't dream of Zhou Gong)
Facilities: All kinds of facilities can only be modernized. There is a food delivery robot in the lobby on the first floor. The rooms are equipped with Dyson hair dryers, automatic curtains, and the gym facilities are well maintained, except for a swimming pool.
Food: There are many kinds of food. For my colleagues, it must be a domineering circle of friends. It has all the colors and flavors. But for this, I am personally picky and I won‚Äôt comment on it.
In fact, in my work and life, I rarely give feedback. Before I check in, I have compared several hotels on Xiaohongshu and Ctrip, because I want to shoot products in the hotel, but the staff of several other hotels don‚Äôt allow it. After shooting my product, after a friend‚Äôs strong recommendation, my colleagues and I came with the mentality of trying it out. After exiting the elevator, the elegant staff greeted us very kindly and brought tea and towels. We were still a little flattered, and the butler Shanshan took us to compare which room type my product is suitable for, and patiently introduced us to the differences in several room types. After confirming the room, during the check-in process, ladies and sisters I also warmly informed the hotel that the breakfast, afternoon tea and supper are provided by the hotel. I am very friendly to me who don‚Äôt know about the meal after I‚Äôm busy. My products add up to be very big and heavy, Ms. Shanshan She also took the initiative to help me deliver the product to the room, and after we put down the product, we picked up other friends. The young lady quietly sent me a fruit plate to the room until I checked out and she returned home. The warm-hearted care has given me a very different feeling when I get home. It is similar to the care of my relatives and friends, which is really great.

Attentive service, birthday surprises, breakfast was delivered to the room during the epidemic period, and the service was enthusiastic. Both the security staff and the front desk staff were very polite. I especially praise Miss Huang Yuan, the service is super good, and I help with luggage when I check in. When I got to the room, I also helped deliver cakes.
