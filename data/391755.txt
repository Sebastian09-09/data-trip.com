It is in a great location to enjoy some time in the Lingnan Tiandi area for food and coffee, but also not far from other attractions of the city including the ancient Kilns (but need a taxi to go there). The room was spacious and had a big desk and sitting area, so it was convenient for us to spend time there. The room service was a bit less great, not a big selection and some items sold out.

They had a Honda conference and had quite literally run out of beer.   We gave up and had a Cocktail (it took quite some time as they had to get the bar staff downstairs to make it) and some dinner in the restaurant and then ended up downstairs in the lounge bar to teach the staff how to make a cocktail.  No porters we’re around to assist with bags and the beds were extremely hard.  We won’t be back.

The only downside is that, at the moment, the Western menu is reduced, due to not many Western guests come to visit.
In another hand, hotel helped us to order from a nearby Western restaurant, and it was even better.

Second time staying at this hotel, definitely coming back again.

We checked out at 1:00 noon to catch the high-speed train. We missed a mobile phone in the room, so we rushed back to get it. Thank you to the lobby manager Sarina (who is Japanese) for helping us expedite the processing. She went to the floor to take it out in person so that we could catch the high-speed train.

You can be frugal or even simple, but charging full five-star hotel prices without any ambiguity is unethical. It's just because of the convenience of being located in the city center that it's a bit unreasonable for the emperor's daughter to worry about getting married.

When I checked in at 12 o'clock in the evening, even the lights in the toilet on the first floor were turned off. I had to go to the room to use the toilet after checking in. It was really frustrating.

The traffic police point a finger at you and you have to get out. The car is parked in other paid parking lots. There is a surprise on the balcony after check-in: a cigarette butt left by others. In the bathroom, you need to study which side of the faucet is heated, and be careful not to fall when your feet slip.
The highlights are indeed: the heated toilet seat, I guess in addition to the location, the five stars are all due to it, but you have to slowly find the flush button, which is a test of observation!

Logically speaking, I had been told that I wanted it after 11 o'clock. After checking in, shouldn't you clean up first?

First of all, the front desk has no understanding of the basic situation of the hotel, gives random directions to the equipment and facilities, and has a bad attitude, as if he was offended.
2. Ask the front desk if hotel supplies are available. Children's slippers and children's bathrobes are provided once. If you ask housekeeping, they will bring them directly. The attitude of housekeeping is worthy of praise in all aspects.
3. As a star-rated hotel, the experience is very poor. Both the rooms and the so-called complimentary supporting facilities are very old. The rooms have a musty smell and the hygiene is average.

msg:Excellent hotel! I booked twice during one trip. Moreover, the first time he was still in the Marco Polo network, and the second time he already moved to the Cordis network.
Everything remained the same, it only spoiled the impression that in the kitchen in the room there are now no dishes and good mugs for tea, there are only glass cups, but maybe this is temporary, due to a change of company.
I booked a Premier room with a kitchenette.
I really liked the room - a full apar**ent: kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom with shower and bath, large balcony.
Everything you need is there: hygiene products, drinking water, coffee/tea, sugar, dry cream.
Good, varied breakfast.
Responsive staff, always ready to help whenever possible.

msg:The location is good, the service is patient, professional and courteous, clean and tidy, and the breakfast is rich and good. These are all things that a long-established brand hotel should have. However, because it has been in business for a long time, the facilities and supplies are old, the drainage is not smooth, and the carpets and sofas have a slight stale smell. The bathroom sliding door cannot be locked (blocking the door opening), there is a lack of privacy, and the design intention is not understood. Overall, the service is attentive, but the hardware is old, so I personally think the price is too high. If you choose location, service, and catering, it is still worth recommending.

The hotel was supposed to be close to Lingnan Xintiandi, but after checking in, I discovered that the air conditioner in the room was loud and there was a problem with the design of the hair dryer plug in the room. The plug came loose when I used the hair dryer. The room also smelled bad and I couldn't sleep well all night.

     However, the breakfast was a bit messy - there were too many people and there was no waiter to guide me. It took me a long time to find a seat. The breakfast presentation was not in good taste and the quality of the fruits needs to be improved. It would be best to add a VIP floor breakfast to give VIP floor guests a better experience. !

Although the facilities are not too new, the service, catering, and location are simply great.
Because my flight was delayed and I was expected to arrive very late, I asked the front desk to reserve a non-smoking room for me, preferably a shower room instead of a bathtub. The front desk arranged it properly. It was already past 11 o'clock when we arrived, and the food stalls recommended by the guy at the front desk were great... but there is so much to eat in Foshan.
The hotel's own breakfast is also great. The Western dim sum is very good, not to mention the Cantonese style.
Just outside the door is Lingnan Tiandi... 5 minutes walk to start the nightlife...

The bed was very comfortable, and it actually gave me a good sleep for someone who often suffers from insomnia. Before having breakfast in the morning, I went to swim in the indoor constant-temperature swimming pool on the fifth floor. Unexpectedly, even the changing rooms are very large and fully equipped, and there are dry and wet steaming options. The food quality of the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is very high, and the iced sweet and sour pork is very delicious. I will definitely come back to this hotel next time I go to Foshan.

It is very convenient to go downstairs to visit the ancestral temple or go to Lingnan Tiandi to eat and shop. Even if you walk to Liangyuan, it only takes 15 minutes.
The hotel is a bit old, but the hardware is well maintained. The room is a little smaller, but it has a large balcony where you can drink tea, read a book and sunbathe.
There is an underground garage for parking which is very convenient. The concierge and front desk services are very good. When I saw someone approaching the door from a distance, I immediately opened the door enthusiastically. This is a well-trained person.

msg:This time I stayed in Ma Ge for two nights. The first night was a luxurious double bed room booked by the bank. I was satisfied as always, because when I go back to Foshan to visit my parents twice a year, I always choose Ma Ge. The room is clean, the swimming pool is clean, the gym is 24 hours, and the buffet breakfast is rich. The location of the hotel is very good. Downstairs is Lingnan Tiandi, Zumiao, and Lingnan Station. It is convenient for eating and shopping. Xianxing Bookstore, Chuihong Park, Youji Restaurant, Faiji Dessert, Beixiangyuan, and Minxin are within two kilometers. You can walk or cycle.
The second night was a superior twin room booked through Ctrip. There was no problem with the room type and the facilities, but I always felt that the room on the fifth floor would cover most of the hotel's negative reviews. So I sincerely suggest that you do not arrange rooms on the fifth floor of the hotel. Because the rooms on the fifth floor are connected to the back kitchen of the Chinese restaurant, the noise and smell of the back kitchen will affect the experience of the guests living in it. There is also a banquet hall next to room 508. The staff preparing for the banquet walked around the door, which felt a bit awkward. There is a small courtyard outside the window of the room. There is no small balcony in the standard room, but when I opened the curtains in the morning and saw the hotel gardener working in the courtyard, I was more shocked than surprised.

Although I live on the 9th floor, I can still vaguely hear K😅 singing on the street at night (fortunately it stops after 22:30).
In terms of facilities, we only used the swimming pool (indoor), which was decent and acceptable.
The children most look forward to having the breakfast buffet in the western restaurant every day, because it is really rich, with many choices and delicious taste, really👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
On the last day, we went to the Chinese restaurant for lunch. The environment was quiet, cost-effective, and it was another enjoyable meal.
What needs to be improved may be the shower in the bathroom. The three rooms have different strengths (the intensity cannot be adjusted).
Overall, it's pretty good. The location is convenient. It's close to Zumiao Station and Lingnan Tiandi. You may consider staying here again.

Generally, the air conditioner has been turned on to dehumidify part of it. What I am more concerned about is the bad smell in the toilet. After closing the toilet door, there is a strong smell. Basically, you need to open the toilet door and rely on the room air conditioner to solve it. But when you think of bacteria coming out of the room... just close it. There was a door in the room that led to the next room. Although it was locked, it made people feel very insecure. The mirror in the bathroom is too dark, and the light is cold blue. I read the comments before and no one mentioned it. I was shocked. I don’t believe that no girls mind. Makeup is completely invisible. The advantage is that it is really the closest to the Ancestral Temple and Lingnan Tiandi, which is convenient. The lobby is dark and the rooms are dark. The balcony is large and has a good view, but there are no tables and chairs, so you can't sit on the balcony. The attitude of the front desk service is not friendly, very cold, it seems that they owe them money. However, Ctrip placed an order and said that they hope to arrange a good view, and the floor is not bad, and there is no room type upgrade for consecutive stays on weekdays, for reference.

The guy who checked in at the front desk was professional and polite, and helped upgrade the room type. For me alone I feel very caring and heart-warming when I bring a small month-old baby to stay in the hotel

Hygiene: I checked the floor tiles around the toilet, there is no water stain, I believe the last guest wiped it very clean after checking out

Environment: Located next to Lingnan Tiandi in the center of Chancheng District, the hotel is 16 floors high. The room has a large balcony with a good view, clean and hygienic, and no peculiar smell. This location is specially chosen for the convenience of ordering takeaway, and the surrounding facilities in the central area comprehensive

Ranked second in the high-end hotels in Foshan, the experience after check-in is really high-end, the service is considerate and excellent, and you can live in a better hotel with comfort and peace of mind! !

msg:The Marco Polo Hotel came out of the Ancestral Temple Station, and passed by the Ancestral Temple and Lingnan Tiandi like a walk. The Lingnan style along the way has rendered the a**osphere of travel. The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us check in early, and found that each room in the hotel has a large balcony, which can be a window full of Lingnan scenery. The time I traveled was the summer rainy season. Sitting on the big balcony, the air conditioner in the room was blowing a slight breeze. It was very pleasant to listen to the unique summer rain in the south with a cold beer. The hotel room is large and fully functional. It is a hotel where you can relax your whole body. The price-performance ratio of the 5-star hotel is very worth recommending. It is just opposite Lingnan Tiandi, directly opposite the Ancestral Temple, where you can eat, drink, and take pictures leisurely for a day.

Sure enough, his body temperature rose after a while. We arrived at the hotel around 11:30. In fact, the hotel The cleaning has not been completed, only one senior suite has been withdrawn, and it is still being cleaned. Since my father is very uncomfortable at this time, he wants to lie down. After communicating with the front desk, he agreed that we should go to the room first, so as not to affect the cleaning work. . After noon, I went to the front desk to open the second senior suite, and communicated with the little brother Sivan at the front desk, can we arrange for us to be on the adjacent floor as much as possible, because I am afraid that my mother will not be able to take good care of me alone, and I need to run up and down to take care of my father. But the nearby suites have been arranged, I reluctantly said forget it, there is no other way, but Sivan saw that I was anxious, and there was a reason, communicated with the superior many times, and helped us upgrade two suites to garden suites for free. In the big house with a garden, there are two big bed rooms, which saves me from running around and makes my sick father live more comfortably. I am really touched, thank you Sivan! Because of illness, my parents didn't go out for two days in the hotel. I felt all kinds of meticulous services, such as water shortage, buckwheat husk pillows and mosquito coils were delivered in time. I didn't have much fun in Foshan this time, but downstairs is the Ancestral Temple and Lingnan The world is very convenient. Although the old five-star hotel is a bit old, the service is very good, the cleaning is also in place, and you feel at home. So, next time, we will come to Marco Polo to continue to experience the customs of Foshan!

It feels quite far from the Ancestral Temple Subway Station to the hotel. It feels a lot better if you have something light to carry with you and the weather is sunny. This hotel is very popular. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a room with a balcony. The space is large, the facilities are not too old, and the overall is clean. I stayed at this store just to visit the Zumiao Temple. By the way, there is a high probability that the Ancestral Temple will not be able to see the lion on a rainy day. It rained all the time during our stay. We passed by 3 times before and after, and went in 2 times. You have to pay multiple times to enter, and finally saw it before leaving. . It is recommended to pay attention to the Zumiao public account in advance, and the specific time of the three games a day is available on it. When the weather is bad, you can go to the exit of the ancestral temple closest to the lion dance to take a look, ask the security guard if you have high hopes today, and see if there are many people in the auditorium. It can even be confirmed that there is a performance before entering. The first few minutes are martial arts performances, and there will be no lion dances.

Disadvantages: The biggest disadvantage should be the design of the shower, the temperature and size are integrated, it is very difficult to adjust, and the toilet button is not very effective.

You can see the Ancestral Temple when you look out. The dim sum is very good. It takes a little time to order and steam. If you are not in a hurry, you can eat slowly and watch slowly.
The service is good and polite.
If there are too many people, you need to wait for the check-in procedure.
The trash can in the room is too small. I ordered three lemon teas, and the box was full of trash.
Overall I am very satisfied. Will still choose it next time. It's a real peace of mind.

The variety in the buffet area was pitifully small, and the hotel did not arrange it for the New Year's Eve. There are a lot of varieties, and there is basically no timely replenishment of dishes after the first round of panic buying. Therefore, the evening buffet can't be full at all, so you can only order takeaway by yourself, and you can eat a full New Year's Eve dinner.

The front desk of the hotel had a bad attitude and said that the Ctrip platform had not communicated with the hotel, and the check-in would be arranged after 15:00, which caused unpleasant experiences and feelings.

The variety of breakfast is relatively average. I think hotels of this level can still do better. Generally speaking, the geographical advantage is too good, I think it is recommended.

msg:I booked two twin rooms for the Dragon Boat Festival. The advantage is that the location is good, close to the ancestral temple and Lingnan Tiandi, and it is convenient to travel. However, the service attitude really needs to be improved. Among them, a tall curly-haired guy who left the luggage at noon on June 23 When I was picking up my luggage, I tied the rope too tightly and couldn't untie it for a while. I urged him to hurry up, but he actually yelled at me, yelled at me, yelled... It really opened my eyes. I have lived in all kinds of places, big and small. This is the first time I have encountered this kind of yelling at customers in a hotel. It is still a five-star hotel. What is the service quality of the staff?

msg:When I held a company conference at the end of a few years ago, I thought the hotel was good but I had never stayed there. After staying this time, I really felt what service is. When I came back the next night and saw that the hotel had not been cleaned, they said I might have pressed the do not disturb button by mistake. I go……. It seems like a curse. Wouldn't you ask the front desk to confirm with me? It’s not like I don’t have my mobile phone number, otherwise what’s the point of logging in with my mobile phone number? What's even more annoying is that the next day after checking out, I found that my pajamas were left at the hotel. So I called to confirm. The front desk said he didn't know and had to ask the concierge to confirm. He came back a while later and replied that he had found pajamas. What I want to say is that if you, the person who cleans the room, found something left behind by a guest, why didn't you take the initiative to contact him? NND, if we have to call ourselves to confirm, is this a service?

msg:I am a frequent guest of the hotel. If I want to stay in a hotel in Foshan, I will recommend this hotel to myself, friends and family. However, this stay was really disappointing and I will not stay again in the future. The booked room type could not be arranged 2 hours after the agreed check-in time. I took my two children with me and fully expected to stay in the parent-child suite, but I didn't get it. The parking lot was like a maze, and I couldn't find my car after searching for half an hour. The next morning I ordered room service for breakfast, but the menu only stated the service charge, and in the end there were other charges that were unclear. There is no service at all. The hotel facilities and rooms are inherently old. If it weren't for the location and past feelings, I wouldn't have chosen this hotel. Now it's better. After this experience, I don't have to choose this place again. Marco Polo, goodbye!

It seems to be a very old-fashioned old hotel, the facilities and the interior of the room are very old. The toilet was very smelly and the room had a musty smell. The toilet water is not enough, the toilet paper is very thin and poor, the quilt is very thin, and the pillow is uncomfortable. I really didn't expect that a star-rated hotel would have such a bad experience, and I was very disappointed.

Although I didn't drink much, the experience was pretty good. Because I got the room late, I could delay it until 2 o'clock on the second day. Check out as it feels extra human on holiday.
Called upstairs and went downstairs to Lingnan Xintiandi for dinner. There were many people during the National Day. The food was Yueya Vietnamese food, and the taste was very positive. When I booked the hotel, I saw that it was in a busy area.
The buffet breakfast after drinking is good, and it is still very rich at more than nine o'clock, and my husband is also very satisfied. The children play in the wave room is not very big, the swimming pool is not bad, not constant temperature, the daughter likes it quite, adds some fun in the hotel, and towels are in sufficient supply.
If you park your car, you can sign up for two days of parking in the lobby, and it is very user-friendly to enter and exit at will. The downside is that the hotel is not particularly new, the room is not like a sofa, it is a little empty, and there is no balcony. But the service is very good, a wonderful National Day hotel experience.

In terms of facilities, the rooms are divided, and if I want to eat, I have to go to another building. I get the first floor, and then go to the third floor to eat in another building, which is really inconvenient. The pool is also open for a short period of time.
The most uncomfortable thing is that the bathtub and shower are in the same space, that is, you have to step on the bathtub to shower, so I don't feel uncomfortable. In fact, if there is only so much space, there is no need to make a four-in-one bathroom!
On the other hand, looking at the layout of the whole apar**ent, the kitchen part is very large, but it is not used at all, and I don't understand it.

Because the members have to automatically upgrade the room type for free, I booked 557 Haoda one day in advance, but when I checked in, the front desk never took the initiative to prompt the upgrade, that's okay, I took the initiative to propose, okay, the front desk helped me upgrade the value of 700 Many premium room types. I regretted going to the room. I don't know if it was because of the free upgrade. The so-called one-bedroom, one-bedroom, only the sink has a tissue holder, so yesterday and today I used a tissue to walk around the room to get the tissue. My hair is blond, but I found long black hair on the dresser. It's impossible that my husband hid other women while I was going to the toilet, right? ! And I seriously doubt that this room has not been occupied for a long time. The bath towel is dry and hard. I later asked the room service to send two more bath towels. Then one of the spotlights in the room was broken. The decoration and other items were very old, and there were more than 700 rooms. I was completely disappointed with Ma Ge. Ma Ge was well decorated, but the room was very poor.

msg:Good location and very convenient travel!
The sound insulation of the room can also basically not hear the noise of the road outside! This is commendable.
The basic sanitation environment I have seen is still in place! This is also worthy of praise!
I really want to complain about the toothbrush in the room. It bleeds when I brush it. I don't think the hotel should choose such cheap cleaning supplies for guests to use!
The bathroom is equipped with a hairdryer but I didn't see an electrical outlet for a hairdryer which is kind of weird!
Breakfast is also a place where I want to complain, no one leads the way in, and no waiter comes over to ask for coffee or tea after sitting down. There are children but no children's tableware is provided. There were not many diners at that time, and I didn't see the waiter coming to change the dishes. This is where the hotel restaurant training management is insufficient and needs to be improved. There is also a little breakfast variety, and I was a little disappointed that I did not find that there are local characteristics of Foshan for breakfast.

There are too many special food and snacks in the surrounding Foshan. Lingnan Tiandi and Xinghua Plaza are all within walking distance. We arrived at noon, and the double room was not available yet. The lady at the front desk thoughtfully upgraded us to the small suite. The balcony is facing the ancestral temple. There are three games a day by Huang Feihong martial arts team (one in the morning and two in the afternoon). The performance is worth seeing. If there is still time, it is recommended to take a few bus stops to Zhongshan Park for a stroll, full of local cultural fireworks.

First of all, the separation between the bathroom and the dry and wet outside is not in place. After the shower, the water is flooded on the floor of the toilet outside. It is also very slippery. I can only find a towel and wipe it on the floor. Then I found that the towel after bathing was not stored. Box can be put
Second, the balcony is designed with floor-to-ceiling windows, but there is no screen window. After watching the scenery on the balcony, there were mosquitoes while sleeping at night, and the crushed mosquitoes and the dead mosquitoes were found the next morning.
In addition, the toilet flushing power is poor, and the room does not provide other paper towels except for the toilet.
In general, it’s not worth the five-diamond rating

In addition to Lingnan Xintiandi, there is also a big shopping mall with a family. The location is perfect. Breakfast is also abundant. Many business people stay free to upgrade. The view of the room is very good, and the parking is convenient to the temple. It is suitable for self-driving. The service of the old hotel has no need to say the only downside is that the facilities are relatively old and it is the only downside.

msg:The hotel has a good location and good service attitude, so I am quite satisfied.

However, I was not satisfied with the Super Wings Suite I booked. I thought that the 82-square-meter suite had two bedrooms and one living room, but it turned out to be a large single room. First of all, the introduction was misleading. I saw that the hotel manager answered the guest in the question and said that the Super Wings Suite had two bedrooms and one living room, but did not mention that only the deluxe suite had it. It completely misled me... It made the three adults and one child very uncomfortable 😔 and there was no privacy at all.

In addition, this is a parent-child suite, which must be for children. The hotel did not even have a bed fence. The 1.8-meter bed did not lean against the wall on both sides. The three-year-old child could only sleep between the two adults, causing the two adults to almost not sleep all night. It was too crowded, and the child drew circles on the bed and could not sleep well at all.

Foshan is 35 degrees. I haven't been out for two days. It's too hot... It is recommended to wait until the weather is cooler before going.

It is the breakfast of the hotel. The breakfast at Marco Polo Hotel meets my basic needs. There are many types of breakfast, the environment is good, comfortable, clean, and the service staff are very good. They will ask you if you need coffee or tea, and they will deliver it to you. In front of you, it would be better if you have yogurt! The accommodation environment is popular because we are a twin room. There is a small balcony where you can see the Lingnan world downstairs. We also sent us fruits, thank you! The swimming pool on the 5th floor is clean without the smell of disinfectant water. There is a children’s playground on the 1st floor. She is the only child to go to. The room needs improvement: 1. There is no three plugs for the hair dryer in the bathroom, and the room is changed. The air dryer is not suitable and needs to be taken out of the room to use, and the air duct is extremely noisy. 2. There are sockets on one side of the bed and not on the other side, so you need to go to the TV for charging. 3. It is recommended to change the comb to a flat ordinary comb, as the gear is not very convenient.
Overall, cost-effective, good location, will go again. Thanks for a nice two days!

Go to the front desk later to make up the difference and upgrade to a deluxe double room, the room is indeed much better. But the sheets and quilts are also very humid, so you have to dry the quilts yourself. It is shocking that a five-star hotel can show such facilities!

msg:必須點名吐嘈的一间酒店
入住那天下午1點多，在那位前台辦理入住那位小姐完全是發夢一樣，完全令酒店大扣分，我不會再選那間酒店
1. 辦理入住手續後，忘了把早餐卷給我，竟然給我了，一面懷疑我騙早餐似的，最後發現自己枱上有寫到一半的早餐才默不作聲給回我，也沒跟我們說早餐在哪用？我們房間可使用行政酒廊等等任何細節
2. 我們親子遊，因小孩有個藥水需要冷藏保存，但我們房間未收拾好，我請那位小姐幫忙處理，這麼大的一間酒店，那位小姐竟然說她们沒有這個服務，叫我自行去大堂吧詢問，我到大堂吧後，大堂吧又叫我到前台，最後真的有點生氣，才有另一位員工安排先放我们房間的雪櫃，其實那位小姐真的應該一早就這麼處理
3. 我們下午一点多辦理入住，同行還有另一個家庭和我一同辦入住，得知房間未有收拾好，已經叫那位小姐盡快處理，然後我們到附近逛逛，結果五點多回来，只有我同行的那個家庭有房，說我那間房沒安排趕房！那位小姐竟然只趕了一間房？一點多辦入住，五點多还沒有房，真的太無言了，小孩困了沒法午睡
4. 拿房後，那個需冷藏的藥水竟然給收拾房間的員工收走了，打電話才拿回来，那時藥水已經常溫不能用了，竟然沒寫張紙在藥水上或特別和收拾房間員工溝通

總結而言，以上所有問題，那位前台員工均可妥善處理，但她沒有做，令我們对酒店服務大打折扣！

👍值得稱讚的是服務態度確實一流。無論遇到的門僮，前台，服務員，酒吧，清潔阿姨都非常熱情，耐心。孩子生病了，臨時取消住宿的第二晚，加付了差價。辦理過程非常順利。餐廳還讓我拿了兩個熱饅頭上樓給孩子。這份關心確實讓人覺得温暖。

msg:Stayed in Guangzhou for four nights, stayed in Foshan for two nights,
I picked Marco Polo among the few options,
The main reason is that it is next to Lingnan Tiandi.
Why choose the one near Lingnan Tiandi?
I don't know, the lady said.

After checking out from Guangzhou W Hotel, I came to Foshan without taking a taxi.
I chose the subway transfer method.
It takes about half an hour, and the cost is saved by 90%, only 14.
Sometimes I save money in some inexplicable places,
Just experience it yourself.

The exit of the subway station is only a few minutes' walk from the hotel.
The Foshan Ancestral Temple is almost on the middle line of the two.
Smartly pass through the hall through the back door, avoiding the scorching sun.

The front desk is handling the check-in of several conference teams, and the counters are fully open.
The sister who received the reception smiled like a flower, and the spring breeze was blowing on her face.
It seems to make people ignore the heat of the hot summer.
Isn't this the front desk that a high-end hotel should have?

The balcony of the suite faces Lingnan Tiandi and is called a "view room".
However, different people have different opinions on the understanding of landscape rooms.
At least I saw the night view from the day view, and I didn't see much of it.
Fortunately, there is not much traffic at night, and it is not noisy, so I can fall asleep.

The facilities in the room are also a bit old.
It matches the price of more than 700 without breakfast.
The biggest problem is sleeping dry at night,
With the experience of W, relieved with a soaked bath towel.
Didn't choose breakfast buffet, didn't go swimming,
These two regular items cannot be commented on.

As far as the convenience of shopping alone is concerned, the location of the hotel is quite good.
Go downstairs and go out, just cross the road, get into any alley,
Can spend the whole night.
Lingnan Tiandi has a large area, roughly equivalent to five or six Chongqing Tiandi.
It may also be aesthetic fatigue. We had zero seats and zero consumption in two days.

After going out for a week, even if it is a vacation, I feel tired.
From the hotel to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport,
Take a taxi 🚖, no more fussing.

msg:酒店真的好老
有的房型還是浴缸配置
來這裏住過很多次了
但是每次來佛山大概率還是住這家
為什麼呢？
地理位置好！
祖廟隔壁 嶺南天地對面
附近好吃的老字號也都是步行距離

服務人員從前台到客房都很nice

但是住宿條件真的有點差
可是佛山太大了 好的酒店少
有一些酒店就離市區超遠
所以這家性價比還是高的

畢竟有時候 魚與熊掌不可兼得

整體酒店不新，服務熱情不夠，前台沒有笑臉。停車場與景區公用，很擁擠。衞生狀況一般。浴缸內淋浴的古老設計，打滑危險又麻煩，沖涼體驗不佳。

總體價位不低，但是能省心玩還行吧。

msg:首先設備陳舊，其實陳舊欠保養對出行的心情沒太大影響，主要是服務達不到星級酒店服務，前台眼睛長在頭頂，拽拽的。我在預訂後打電話到酒店諮詢，接電話的態度很冷淡，一口所謂的英語，在佛山扮乜叉燒呢？一問三不知，還直接讓我找攜程客服，到店後，我因為住在附近，訂酒店是為了好好度過週末，就穿着較隨意，那裡的前台人員那個嘴臉，好像住他們酒店要盛裝出席一樣，擺着個臭臉，尤其是前台穿黑色衣服的所謂經理，看到我後面的客人，像狗一樣迎上前。這個酒店的服務真的噁心，而且設施也不達到五星水平，連酒店的冰箱居然什麼都沒放，但把價目表貼上去了，還收了我500按金，反正很噁心，如為了不想影響你的出行心情，自己看着辦吧。

房間又小格局又奇怪。
房間大概有10隻蚊子，特別糟糕的體驗！
前台全程無笑容，7天的前台都比他們熱情。
完全是砸馬可波羅的招牌！
不推薦入住。

如果酒店和平台不願意我用禮品卡付，也不願意我付特價房，可以直説，而不是一直打電話，前台撒謊最後拖到一個半小時逼我同意。 玩不起就不要玩。

msg:先説優點，地理位置絕佳，步行到嶺南天地和祖廟都在5分鐘之內，房間衞生乾淨。再説缺點，房間佈局不合理，第一次住的大床房床居然靠牆放，住裏面的人得從床尾爬進去🙄。衞生間沒有單獨沖涼房，浴缸太舊也沒有泡澡的洗浴用品，估計正常人都不會泡。沖涼得站在浴缸裏，進去的時候跨過浴缸邊也是個大工程，太高了，這是設計給巨人用的嗎？蓮蓬頭也不是很靈光，經常要按住龍頭才能出水。洗完整個廁所都是水，設計相當不合理。再來説説吹風機，確定是用來吹頭髮的嗎？用嘴吹出來的風都比它大好嗎。還有又不是公寓，為什麼要浪費地方設計一個L形的操作枱，還有電磁爐和抽油煙機，是可以炒菜嗎？去佛山這種美食之都還會有人帶帶鍋出門自己煮？前台服務意識不強，入住和退房的時候都沒有提醒辦理停車免費服務，車開到出口又回大堂辦理😫，五星的收費平價的享受。
