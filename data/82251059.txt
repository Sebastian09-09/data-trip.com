msg:The hotel is very beautiful, with Taihu Lake outside and the internal gardens are very well maintained, at a superb level. The room I was assigned on the second floor was very good, brighter, and I couldn't find any fault with the facilities. There is no butler service. Miss Gao contacted me on WeChat, but it would be better not to contact me. I assume that it is better to have no butler. I have never seen or greeted her, and she has never done anything for me. There is only hardware but no service here! The service is limited to greeting and carrying luggage. I have been playing in Hangzhou and Suzhou for more than ten days. Xiao Qin, the butler of Fuchun Mountain Residence for 20 years, asked me what time I would arrive to greet me, arranged a boat tour for me, copied scriptures, and sent me a full-priced cloth bag to the car when I said goodbye. The process was smooth and professional. My friend and I were very happy. I called the front desk of West Lake Villa and said that I had acute gastroenteritis while traveling alone. The girl at the front desk immediately reported to the leader and immediately arranged an employee to accompany me to Zhejiang Hospital for trea**ent. I went there at 8 o'clock in the morning and had an infusion at 12 o'clock. I was patiently with me and I was fine in the afternoon. Compared with its excellent peers, the service level of Hanyu Xiaozhu is like a kindergarten. The food was even worse, I almost got choked by a knife fish bone. It could have been the ceiling of a Chinese hotel, but the service and catering were terrible. The breakfast was all carbohydrates and no protein. They even asked me why I didn't tell them myself, is this the level of food you serve? The staff of the 10-room Youxiong Changyuan gave a brief introduction to the hotel's cultural characteristics, but there was nothing here.

msg:Very much looking forward to this hotel for vacation. Not cheap. Because of the Golden Diamond Hotel, the requirements will naturally be higher, not compared with traditional five-star hotels. Give me some suggestions, I hope the hotel will be better.
First, the hotel is a membership system. I heard that it is more polite to members. After experiencing it, I am generally satisfied. This is the only one in the country, unlike many chains such as Four Seasons, Marriott, and Park Hyatt. Therefore, it seems not cost-effective to become a member.
Second, the hotel service is acceptable, but not amazing, and overall stable. Will take the initiative to say hello, not the kind of chain brand hotel that is a bit standardized, a bit casual, and has a rustic feel.
Third, I am very satisfied with the environment, room facilities and hygiene, and give it full marks.
Fourth, the hotel facilities are defective. The swimming pool is at room temperature, which is very cold. It is basically not used in winter. For the Golden Diamond Hotel, people come here specifically to swim. It is not a constant-temperature swimming pool, which is lacking.
Fifth, the hotel breakfast is not cheap, but there are very few varieties. It is more exquisite and tastes okay. I hope to expand the varieties appropriately.
Overall a pleasant hotel, better than the environment and cleanliness.

Because it was the last stop of the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, I only stayed here for one night.

I came to the event with my friends before, and I was already amazed by their meals. Each dish was presented in front of me like a story, which was incredible. This time I came here to experience the accommodation by myself. I didn't expect that the accommodation would also amaze me. The Soviet-style garden architecture and each courtyard design are different, and each step leads to a scene. The room is spacious and very clean. Not only are there exquisite snacks, but also seasonal fruits are delivered to the room. The toiletries are from Ferragamo and they smell good, which I like. The lady's service attitude was very good. She smiled throughout the whole process and patiently introduced me to me.
I am very satisfied and it is worth staying. I will come again if I have the opportunity and recommend it to my friends.

2023年10月19日晚上 酒店門口站崗的人很勢力 希望酒店能夠對他進行相關處理
我帶我家家人出去遛彎 散步回酒店
他在門口説 你們看看就得了 不能進去
我告訴他 我們是住客
他説話時 就那種 很勢力的小人
我們如果開個賓利進去 他不會這種態度
那個態度就是 看不起你 覺得你住不起 趕緊哄走的樣子

我就很想説 你的位置偏僻 空房間達到99%了已經
你哪裡來的底氣那麼牛呢

告訴他我們是住客 也不道歉 還一副質疑的樣子
人的素質啊～ 大概是文化水平決定素質 決定是不是對別人尊重
你問一下是不是住客就好了 上來就驅趕
這種態度 勢力
給這個酒店大大減分

有這樣的門衞 感覺酒店很難很好了呢
本來定的不止一晚
這樣的體驗後把後面的退掉了

再提兩個小意見，
第一，因為颱風關係，又是湖邊，氣候比較潮濕，導致通往停車場和餐廳的電梯裏的地毯黴味非常重，雖然乘坐時間很短，但是味道確實非常不舒服，尤其是老婆懷孕比較敏感，建議把地毯換掉或時常更換。
第二，因為到房間時空調是打開的，當天天氣較冷，導致房間温度很低，想打開暖風發現空調製熱功能好像有問題，因為這幾天不開空調温度正合適，也就沒有和前台反映，希望儘快修復。
第三，浴缸應該是因為許久沒有人用，打開水龍頭以後是流了很多黃水，放了大概十分鐘恢復正常，希望可以安排工作人員時常檢查放水，避免類似問題。

總體來説，問題都不算硬性問題，周邊風景也很宜人，是度假的好去處，也是太湖邊目前最值得入住的酒店，希望下次帶父母朋友再來。

msg:雖然是中秋節假日，但酒店的空關率卻是肉眼可見的高。前天給安排的房間讓我們不是很滿意，問其緣由，得到的答覆是他們是會員制酒店，服務的人羣主要是付款了20萬或50萬年費的會員。而我們衹屬於體驗客户，已經給我們進行了妥善安排。於是，我們找酒店的管理人員要個説法，得到的卻是一副盛氣凌人，你愛住不住的態度。在辦理入住後沒多久，我們就退房換酒店了，就沖你們這態度，我建議你們還是安心做你們的會員吧，就不要對外營業了，我們小老百姓高攀不起呢
