The taste of the restaurant is comparable to that of the Leath Carlton Hotel. The location is right by the lake and the view is great. The garden landscape in the hotel is also carefully crafted. The only thing that is lacking is a little bit. It's a bit old but I generally think it's right for the price starting at 4800 a night. If I have any shortcomings, it is that it is not very friendly to family travel because the sofa in the room cannot accommodate children, and an extra bed fee of 600 must be added.

It was the first time I stayed at Park Lane, and I really understood why it was more expensive than Banyan Tree. I have stayed at several Banyan Trees and to be honest, the details of the rooms are much worse than Park Lane. I can feel that a lot of money was spent on the decoration at that time. Only after ten years can it still be this good.
The service is also great, except for the catering. Since the hotel was opened in 2013, there is only one restaurant and there are too few dishes to choose from. It is okay to stay for one night. However, after staying for two nights this time, I really got tired of eating. Hahaha.
But the scenery and everything else are great

This three-night stay at Kunming Bailian proved that my idea was completely correct. First of all, Kunming Bailian's housekeepers Xiao Liu, Xiao He and Dashan were very enthusiastic, meticulous, thoughtful and polite from airport pick-up, hotel activities, and catering arrangements. For young men to be able to do this, it shows the level of brand training of Bailian. The girls and waitresses in the restaurant were equally enthusiastic and attentive, which moved me. Especially when I was very embarrassed that I forgot to bring my belt, the housekeeper Xiao He promptly delivered his unused belt and solved my inconvenience. I will always remember this warmth. When I wanted to use a car to go to Lijiang, the front desk helped me contact and implement it. The service quality of the vehicle and driver was also satisfactory and in place. The three nights at Kunming Bailian will become an unforgettable memory in my life, and at the same time it inspires me to look forward to other Bailian!

If there are any shortcomings, it is that the hardware facilities are a bit old and damaged in some places, and the lights in the room are also relatively dim.

If they don't apply waterproof paint, they will corrode in a short time. The joints in the bathroom are also missing. Yes, if the hotel wants to continue operating like this and selling at this price, it should consider renovating it, right? Let’s talk about service. Guests are guests, and waiters are waiters. In short, come over at 6pm to open the bed, check whether your guests are there, and complete your own work. In fact, I don’t want to give a bad review, but the details of your service are really problematic. , it was kind of you to put hot spring water for us, but you should first feel whether the water you put is hot or not. It should have both hot and cold water. As a result, we were very hot when we went in, so we had to put cold water in but the plug could not be pulled out. At night The wind was blowing extremely cold, and the breakfast was speechless. The hot vegetable was okra, and the cold dish was cold okra. You really saved money. The coffee machine should be replaced with a smart one. The waiter spent a long time talking about coffee. The machine broke down and the coffee was full of coffee grounds. Overall, the space design and environment are very good, but these personal experiences of the service really don’t make people want to come back a second time!

msg:剛剛入住過泳池別墅，逐條説明：
房間衞生：客房打掃的很乾凈，但是沙發上有些不明顏色的污漬，不知道是什麼年代遺留下來的，浴巾有的也有黃漬。
周邊環境：進程打車150-180。酒店公共區域不大，但是環境很好。下排別墅區私密性很好。
酒店服務：基礎服務很好，接駁車，spa和温泉接待，餐廳接待等，都很好。但是，客房服務時間不穩定，除了第二天有按時，接下來兩天整個上午都沒人來打掃房間。此外，標準化服務很好，但是核酸政策服務差一點，現打電話問，問也問不到，做核酸要自己叫車到衞生院，主要酒店偏僻不好叫短途車。另外，早餐太差了，基本就是一個二三星的水平。晚餐不錯，除了貴沒毛病。mini bar免費，但是聖培露氣泡水一天衹有一瓶免費，其餘都要自費，20塊一瓶。
設施設備：別墅設計很好，但是年久失修，軟裝趴窩，比如馬桶自帶顏色，衞生紙都沖不下去。兩個洗手池，一個不下水，叫來維修也沒修好。露天淋浴，調節温度的旋鈕是壞的，叫了維修也沒修好。
其餘都不錯，酒店本身設計好，密度低，非常適合度假。所有問題基本都來自於年久失修。

msg:昆明泡温泉和私湯酒店的最佳選擇
因為降温選擇去柏聯泡温泉，泳池別墅房型，公共温泉無限次，因為大雪，住了兩天，也看到了不一樣的柏聯。
設施：東南亞風格建築，90%柚木傢俱，帶一個泳池和一個温泉泡池。
温泉♨️：真温泉水，房間私湯不夠泡也可以選擇公共温泉池。
服務：標準制式服務，但還可以向有些連鎖五星學習，有空間。
雖然有些人覺得房間設施老舊，但我覺得這是柚木獨有的感覺。
兩天的體驗很棒，導致我想繼續打卡其他柏聯温泉酒店。
