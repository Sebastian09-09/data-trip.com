msg:The most average Marriot I ever been ‚Ä¶

The rooms are good and well designed, but the F&B breakfast is overcrowded! Too many extra tables in the restaurant to cope with such huge demand...the food is ok, but the vast majority of guests are not so well educated, which negates any good intentions by management to provide better service. 
The staff is not at the level of professionalism and courtesy of other Marriott/Sheraton/Ritz-Carlton.
The outdoor pool was closed for maintenance. We went to the beach just outside, which is nice, the sand white, the water clean and peaceful, but the security guard would not let you go in the water or swim!!!
Not interesting for international travellers as the guest experience is not at the level of other Marriott around the globe.

msg:We stayed the first time at the Marriott Resort Dapeng! It us a more expensive Hotel Resort, but Overall you see the difference to cheaper Facilities. The Rooms are good and clean! We liked that they used a lot of real wood inside of it. The hallway carpets to the rooms are little bit old and dirty. Also at 1st Floor hallway to the maintenance the jealousies from the Windows are damaged and makes the Hotel look more like a cheaper brand. Outside from this hallway there is a ugly garden where animals live- this fits not into a 5 Star Marriott Resort. The Breakfast was good and enough choices for everyone. The Pool Area is not very big but clean and good for Children. No swimming caps are needed. Its a little bit disappointing that you can rent there inflatable Animals for children for extra money. In my Opinion for a big brand like Marriott it shouldn't be necessary to charge extra money for things like this. You pay high prices for higher standard and such things should be included. The Outdoor Area and Beach are nice. You can‚Äôt go directly in front of the Hotel into the Ocean and must walk 100m to a separate swimming section where it is allowed. At check-in there is no priority line for Marriott Bonvoy members. The Stuff everywhere was friendly and competent. There is no shopping possible like supermarket,‚Ä¶ nearby. For making Covid Tests you must drive 10min with car: Overall it was nice Holiday and we enjoyed it. We can recommend this Resort and come back for sure‚Ä¶

Peaceful location and even with typhoon weather it was still a relaxing stay and spent plenty of time on the balcony for the sea view. Excellent choice of food for breakfast, enough to keep all appetites happy. Only used room service once to order a pizza but it was reasonably priced and came pretty quickly. Unfortunately the beach was closed due to the typhoon but the grounds of the hotel were pleasant to walk around.  The room was clean enough but looking a little worn in the shower room. The bed was comfy and bed sheets were of good quality (high thread count).

The comments are intended to help people make an informed decision. I arrived a bit after check in time and queued for almost an hour to check in. The lobby was filled with families and screaming children. I did not realise this was a place where families stayed. The corridors were noisy too. The spa is fantastic - I had a wonderful massage here. Everywhere else was filled with noisy kids. Breakfast each morning was chaos. The hotel runs activities for kids, so I am sure that if you have children it is a great place to stay. I have heard from friends that it is not always like this, but I will be trying a different location in the future so I can find some relaxation.

msg:I have been to several Marriott resorts. One sign is big enough! This hotel is located at the southern end of Dapeng Peninsula. It has an excellent geographical location, soft sandy beaches in the south, beautiful ecological environment, large public space, reasonable design, and many places to check in and relax, which can meet the needs of adults and children. The garden view room we booked was upgraded to a sea view room for free. The invincible sea view, beach, sea and sky are in full view, and the room facilities are neat and clean. In addition to swimming in the sea, there are two outdoor swimming pools and a heated indoor swimming pool. For people like me who like to swim, there is no need to worry about heavy rain. The hotel breakfast is worthy of praise, with rich varieties, especially the authentic rice noodle rolls, which is a must. It is one of the most satisfactory hotels I have stayed in for vacation in Shenzhen!

msg:Traveling with kids, I chose Marriott because it was close to the beach. It was unexpectedly good. Milly and Raymond provided great service, answered all questions, and prepared a birthday cake for the child. The hotel facilities are very good for children. The outdoor swimming pool is 0.6 meters deep, which is just right for my child. There is also a cute pet park. The little brothers and sisters there are very friendly and will teach the children the names of animals very patiently. The facilities inside are also very clean. There is also a wave pool and a small train. It's a pity that we have other trips next, otherwise we would stay one more night.

msg:I came here for the third time. I had a lot of fun every time. Thanks to Claire and Milly for their five-star service. They prepared children's toothbrushes, bathrobes and slippers for the children and helped me apply for late check-out. The surprise was that Marriott members gave free children's breakfast.
The scenery here is still well maintained, and the trees by the swimming pool have grown up. The first time I came was in 2018, and the two trees at that time had grown a lot. There is a heated swimming pool indoors and a children's swimming pool outdoors. I didn't expect it to be open now. It was still very cold when I first got in the water. It took a while to adapt before I could swim. The children swam happily outdoors. Most of the outdoor swimming pools were children swimming. There were several lifeguards, all of whom were very dedicated. The indoor swimming pool is warmer, and you can go indoors if you are afraid of the cold.
You can also go to the beach to dig sand and watch the sea in a daze, which is very convenient. The hotel also has a cinema, and I watched Frozen. There is also a large children's playground outside, with a very cool slide, which can't be played in one day. The child said that he liked it very much because it had her childhood memories here, and he was looking forward to going there next time.

First of all, the room was very clean and tidy. The lobby was also very orderly during the weekend peak hours. I would like to thank the receptionist, Manager Chen, for arranging a good room and recommending the small zoo. The children had a lot of fun. The swimming pool also has two indoor and outdoor swimming pools, which is simply a paradise for children. The back garden of the hotel is the beach, which is also very fun.

However, as soon as I swiped my card from the hotel lobby, the front desk called and told me that I had not been given a QR code for food and beverages and that I needed to redeem the QR code. Vouchers, so what I just spent in the lobby was consumption based on my strength. If I want to use the vouchers again, I have to spend again! The air conditioner in the room is very noisy. I can't sleep without turning it on, and it's so noisy that I can't sleep if it's turned on. There is no mosquito repellent liquid. Call the front desk and tell them directly that there is no mosquito repellent liquid. It‚Äôs ridiculous! And when I went to the front desk to ask about the opening hours of the children's paradise, I saw other people's check-in explanations in detail. I didn't say anything when I checked in, so I had to figure it out on my own. There are no bath towels in the room. Children's supplies in parent-child hotels need to be purchased separately! Children's playground üé†The coin-exchanging rocker is marked with 3 coins but is actually 2 coins. Those who put in extra coins also swallowed it. I don't often take my children to play with these things. This is what my father discovered the next day when I played with him. Co-author I spent 20 more on the first day in vain! On the first two days when going to the children's playground, only children were required to wear socksüß¶, but on the third day it changed that adults were also required to wear them. What a sudden change! Moreover, the ground next to the rocking car in the children's paradise was full of water. No one cleaned it from time to time. It was very slippery! The only thing worth mentioning is that the concierge service is very good!

     The room was pretty good, relatively clean, and the bedding was relatively comfortable. I had a good sleep during the heavy rain holiday.

msg:I have collected this hotel many times. I used to take my kids to Le Meridien in Trail Bay. I saw a package for sale some time ago. It was more than 800 per night, including breakfast and many amusement projects, so I quickly bought it. After experiencing it for one night, I felt it was still very good!

üè®Room facilities
The room is average, not as good as Le Meridien. Le Meridien is all sea view room. If you are lucky, you can get a 270-degree balcony room in the corner. The basic room type here is garden view, the area is not large, and the facilities are relatively new. The most complained thing is that the toilet is hollow without curtains, and the doors are almost transparent. It will be embarrassing if friends come.

üõùEntertainment facilities
It is the most commendable part of the hotel. There are many children's play projects. First of all, the package comes with a travel photo shoot, with 5 free original photos. The young man took good photos and was very patient. Then he also gave a small train, which will go around the hotel. The hotel has a small cinema, which will show different movies from morning to night every day, for both adults and children.
The hotel has a small cute pet park with rabbits, cats, lizards, snakes, small fragrant pigs, parrots and other small animals. It should be outsourced. The staff is a Northeast auntie with a good attitude. She will take the initiative to bring small animals out to interact with children.
Opposite the hotel gate is a large water park, and there is also a non-powered park next to it, with rich recreational facilities. In addition, there are standard indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a small playground in the hotel. If you only stay for 2 days and one night, you may not be able to play all of them [laughing and crying R], which is indeed very suitable for walking the baby. There are also foreigners singing in the lobby at night, and it is quite comfortable to have a drink after the baby falls asleep.

ü•ûFood and Beverage
The set meal comes with coffee and snacks, and the taste is pretty good. The breakfast is also great, with a wide variety, everything you should have, and the taste level is also online, especially the rice noodle rolls are very delicious.

üíÅService
Before departure, the butler will contact and add WeChat to help make an appointment for travel photography, and you can also tell him if you have anything. The attitude of the staff encountered in the hotel is pretty good, and they will greet warmly.

In general, although the room hardware is not as good as Le Meridien, the supporting facilities are much better than Le Meridien. It can be said to be the leader of holiday hotels for children around Shenzhen. It is highly recommended for those with children!

They recommended the surrounding routes to me as I was traveling alone. The hotel garden leads directly to the beach. The sea in Shenzhen is still very blue. The only drawback is that the beach closes at 6 o'clock. It is really healing to come here to relax alone.

The room is so big, with a terrace and a bathtub, perfect for children to take a bath.
There is an indoor pool, so remember to bring a swimming cap.
There is a children's room for free, where children can play until they don't want to leave.
The beach environment is good.
You can go to Nan'ao to eat seafood in just ten minutes' ride.

msg:During the Easter holiday, I wanted to find a hotel overlooking the sea, but I didn't want to take a plane. I finally decided to leave from Futian and arrive at this hotel in an hour and a half.

The hotel is located in Dapeng, a resort-style hotel. The first feeling after arriving at the hotel is that it does not feel like you are in Shenzhen. It feels like you are in a resort hotel in Southeast Asia. The place is very big. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will see a large lounge. There are people there at night. Live Band, on the left is the check-in area. The staff who helped me with the check-in process were very friendly.

The room is convenient. As a Marriott member, I am honored to upgrade the hotel to a room on a high floor facing the sea. The room is fully equipped and has sufficient air conditioning. You can look at the beach as soon as you step out of the terrace.

The food in the hotel restaurant is also very rich. After arriving at the hotel, the environment is very comfortable. I don‚Äôt want to leave the hotel anymore, so I enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food is convenient and diversified, including hot pot, buffet, and Western food. The taste is also very good and the price Also very good value.

You can go directly to the beach from the hotel. There are not many people on the beach. You can also go to the beach in the morning to enjoy the sea breeze.

The hotel also has an outdoor swimming pool, but due to the time limit for this trip, the hotel's outdoor swimming pool was only officially opened on April 30 this year, so I was unable to use it this time.

In addition to the outdoor swimming pool, the hotel also has a fitness room, indoor swimming pool, children's activity room, public cinema, etc., so you will not feel bored even if you don't leave home. Ôøº

I will also plan to stay here again during my next vacation.

msg:Very satisfying and amazing stay experience!
First of all, the hotel is in a good location, close to the highway, but there are not as many tourists as in Meisha and Meisha. The hotel occupies a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãfine sandy beach and blue water. When the weather is good, it feels like Sanya, Hainan! But it is quieter and more comfortable than hotels in Sanya, and the transportation in the Greater Bay Area is much more convenient.
Secondly, the hotel's design is both resort-style and elegant, which is in line with most people's aesthetics. The facilities are very good, the furniture in the room is very new, and the bathroom design is very nice. The beach is very well maintained. There are no garbage barbecues, beach carts or the like (compared to the beach in Shuangyue Bay). There are searchlights and dedicated personnel on duty at the public beach at night to prevent accidents. This is a level of management only found in Shenzhen.
The last thing is the service. Before check-in, the housekeeper added WeChat. When checking in, the housekeeper Claire at the front desk was very enthusiastic and attentive. She helped upgrade the room type and let us experience a room with excellent sea view. In addition to the front desk, all the staff are also patient and high-quality. When we went to have breakfast, it was almost time to close the meal. Every staff member quickly helped us with instructions on how to quickly pick up the meal, and someone helped me get coffee. The overall experience was great! This level of service is also excellent for a Marriott hotel.
It is highly recommended to choose a room with a frontal sea view. It is so comfortable to sit on the balcony and watch the sea and drink coffee.
Final tips: There are many places worth exploring in the entire Dapeng Peninsula. The seafood restaurants near Nan'ao Beach are delicious and affordable. Moon Bay has the feel of a fish port. There are also fireworks to watch during the New Year, so it is worth a visit. Hiking can go to Xichong and Tung Chung. The scenery along the way is very good, but the hiking route is relatively hardcore, so be prepared and protected.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I wanted to find a warmer place to take my kids digging in the sand, but I didn‚Äôt want to go to a crowded place in a popular place, so I chose Shenzhen after a long time. When I was doing some hotel research, I found that it was quite difficult to find a hotel near the sea. I personally have high hygiene requirements and don‚Äôt really like B&Bs. So after searching a lot, I found Kaisa Marriott. The hotel is located by the sea, and the surrounding area is relatively primitive. It takes 1 hour and 20 minutes by taxi from Shenzhen Airport. The advantage is that it is far from the city and public transportation is not that convenient, so there are not too many people and it is very comfortable overall. The hotel has a very nice view and good hygiene. Originally we only booked it for four nights, thinking we would leave on the second day of the new year and go shopping in the city. However, the hotel is too friendly to those with children. The children had so much fun that they couldn't miss home, so we stayed for two more days and stayed in the same hotel for six nights and seven days, which set a record for us staying in a hotel outside. Needless to say digging for sand is a compulsory course every day. There are not many people at the beach and it is very comfortable. The sea water is very clear. The sand on the seaside is not fine sand, but the shells and stones are polished by the sea water and will not be scratched. There is a welcome robot at the entrance of the hotel, which my child likes very much. Every time he passes by, he asks the robot to dance. The cinema plays movies all day long, and the movies are also suitable for children. There is a dedicated children's playground on the first floor below, where the child can play. You won‚Äôt be able to pick them up after playing all afternoon; there is also a cute pet paradise next to it, the little animals in it are very clean, and the young lady is also very friendly and good at entertaining children. On New Year's Eve, the hotel also made dumplings and watched the Spring Festival Gala activities, which was very good. On New Year's Day, I was lucky enough to watch the hotel's lion dance performance. During the lion dance, my kid was lucky enough to receive a red envelope; during the Spring Festival, the hotel also has Although we didn't understand other activities, such as folk performances, we could still feel the hotel's intentions. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic and patient, especially Claire, the beautiful lady at the front desk who we met on the first day. She is very nice, enthusiastic and patient. At that time, we bought a one-night garden view package and booked a sea view room for three nights on Ctrip. Claire upgraded our room and patiently extended our stay directly, saving us the trouble of changing rooms. , if you have any questions later, contact Claire, and she will answer us enthusiastically and patiently. Thank you Claire! Overall, this trip to the seaside was very enjoyable, and this hotel is very suitable for bringing children.

msg:I brought my children to stay. The overall environment of the Marriott Hotel is beautiful and comfortable. My children were very satisfied with the room. Especially Manager Wei from the customer depar**ent. Hearing that I brought my children, he transferred me from a sub-sea view room to a front sea view room for free. He also arranged it for the next day. The children took a small train ride and applied for afternoon tea, which was really considerate! The service at the Marriott is first-rate and the staff is friendly. The Chinese restaurant on the third floor has very authentic food and is worth trying. I‚Äôll stay at Marriott next time!
I am very happy about this trip. Thank you Manager Wei for your considerate service!

msg:The hotel has a beautiful environment, the seaside lawn is beautiful for photos, the beach is clean, and the sea water is clear. The hotel service is very user-friendly. Considering that we have a baby, we were allowed to check in early and check out late. The family of five was very satisfied with this trip. We chose a relatively warm day in winter to see the sea. There were few people and beautiful scenery. It was great. Got it!

üåü Kaisa Marriott Hotel, a name, a legend. üåü
üåÜ The moment I stepped into the hotel lobby, I seemed to have entered a colorful dream. Elegant decoration, dazzling crystal chandeliers, every detail exudes unparalleled luxury. What moved me the most was the caring housekeeper-Nicole. Her smile was as warm as the spring breeze, making me instantly forget the fatigue of the journey. üåÜ
üè† Under Nicole's guidance, I stayed in a room with a great view. The beautiful scenery outside the window is like a beautiful picture, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. Every decoration in the room reflects the hotel's intention and quality. Nicole introduced me to the various facilities in the room in detail, and thoughtfully prepared hot tea and snacks for me, which made me feel the warmth of home. üè†
üçπ Here, food is also a kind of enjoyment. Nicole recommended many of the hotel‚Äôs signature drinks and special dishes to me. Every bite seemed to bloom on the tip of my tongue, making me intoxicated. And Nicole's professionalism and enthusiasm made me feel even more cordial. She will carefully inquire about my tastes and preferences, and tailor a food plan for me, so that I can feel the taste of home while enjoying the food. üçπ
üì∏ Of course, there is a little surprise during this stay. The hotel photographer captured some beautiful moments for me. Those photos recorded my interaction with Nicole and the moments I took while strolling through the beautiful scenery of the hotel. Every photo is full of emotions and stories and has become a precious memory of my trip. üì∏
üå∫ In addition to the professional services of Nicole and the photographer, the hotel's SPA area is also a paradise for relaxation. There, I enjoyed a soothing massage that completely relaxed my tired body. üå∫
üéâ On the day of departure, Nicole also prepared a special gift for me - a hand-drawn hotel map with my memories of this trip marked on it. This is not only a gift, but also an emotional sustenance. üéâ
üåü Thanks to Kaisa Marriott Hotel for providing me with an unforgettable luxury experience; thanks to the housekeeper Nicole, who warmed my journey with professionalism and enthusiasm; thanks to the photographer for capturing the beautiful moments between me and the hotel with the lens. üåü

First of all, the location is good, with perfect views of the sunset, beautiful coastline, clear water, and the nearby restaurants are great. It feels better than Sanya. The transportation is convenient from Shenzhen. If you rent a new energy vehicle from Bao'an Airport and play for two days, the electricity bill will be less than 100. Secondly, Marriott guarantees breakfast. Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to Claire, the guest relations director. She took good care of her and upgraded her to a sea view room. She was very considerate... I had never met her before and felt like I was at home.

Claire from guest relations added WeChat a day in advance and was responsive to requests during the stay. She helped upgrade the sea view room on the top floor and met the request to delay check-out until 2 o'clock.

Areas for improvement:
The sand on the beach is too co**** and very scratchy.
I feel uncomfortable in my stomach after eating at a Japanese restaurant. The ingredients may not be too fresh.

I would like to mention in particular that Claire, the guest relations director of the hotel, is very nice, gentle and patient. From the moment I booked the room, she has been enthusiastically introducing the hotel's features and various facilities to me, helping us solve all my needs and making me feel It feels like home, thumbs up.
I would also like to highlight the hotel's breakfast. It has many categories, both Chinese and Western, and tastes great. Due to our schedule, we only had breakfast at the hotel, but even so, my parents were full of praise.
In addition, the hotel has superb garden and sea views. It has a private beach and a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery. An unparalleled wonderful hotel experience!

msg:Not only is it the worst Marriott I have ever stayed in, it is also one of the worst luxury hotels I have ever stayed in.
In a sea area like Dapeng in Shenzhen, which is neither blue nor transparent nor beautiful, it is not even a first-line sea view. The price is more than 2,500 per night, which is about the same price as the most expensive first-line sea view B&B in Erhai Lake in Dali during the peak season.
But what is the specific experience:
1/ Room: Very small and poor, the bathroom has a damp and musty smell.
2/ Meals: I bought breakfast at an extra price for two nights, but I had to wait in a long line for breakfast for more than half an hour, and had to fight for food with a bunch of noisy mothers and children. It shows how poor the hotel's diversion and seat control are, and the experience is not even as good as that of a fast hotel.
3/ Noise: Super noisy. The never-ending sound of children screaming and playing outside the balcony, the numerous loud slams of doors closing in the corridor, and the sound of children running around screaming and crying will wake you up from seven o'clock in the morning, and it will never end. . This place is really not suitable for people who like peace and quiet.
4/ The so-called housekeeper service: Every day I ask about my check-in experience in vain. I told her about the bad experience and the reasons for the bad experience. She didn't have any solution or compensation, she just apologized. If an apology is useful, what should the police do? I have to waste a few more minutes of my life replying to your message, but you obviously don't want to focus on improving the user experience, you just want to complete the work task. Asking questions that don't actually solve the problem will only make the guest experience worse.

Above, if your hotel has some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour stay experience and doesn‚Äôt charge 2,500 (worth 500 at most), I won‚Äôt give a bad review. But you know that all the experiences are not worth the price, but you still have the nerve to charge such a price, so I have no choice but to evaluate it truthfully.
The summary is that virtue is not matched and the price/performance ratio is extremely low.

Shortly after I booked the room, the hotel housekeeper Xiao Wei contacted me and enthusiastically introduced the hotel facilities and environment. He also helped us upgrade from a garden view room to a sea view room, and helped us apply for a late checkout the next day. thank you very much. The hotel room is clean and soundproofed, and the curtains are very light-blocking. Disposable bath bags are provided at the front desk. The accommodation experience is quite good.
The room I booked included breakfast and buffet dinner. Both meals were very enjoyable. The buffet dinner included steak and lamb chops, fish and shrimp, small hot pot, etc., as well as rich desserts and ice cream that the children especially liked. The hotel has an outdoor children's swimming pool, which is convenient for children to play in the shallow water area. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon, there is a half-hour bubble show in the children's swimming pool, and many children go to play. The hotel is also very close to the beach, making it convenient for children to play in the sand. There is also a cute pet paradise. Although there are relatively few animals (only three geese, two sheep and two peacocks were seen), it is not a specialized zoo after all, which is okay. Children still like to feed animals up close. An experience.
Finally, I would like to thank the front desk and housekeeper staff for being very nice and with a strong sense of proactive service. Overall a good review, I will come again next time if necessary~

            Hotel service is good. It turned out that the out-of-town car came to Dapeng by appoin**ent, but we found out when we arrived at the destination. We called the front desk and immediately helped us deal with it. I read online reviews that the hotel buffet is nothing to eat, but I personally don‚Äôt think so, it‚Äôs okay. When I arrived, I bought a lunch buffet from Dianping. It was said to be half price for children. In fact, the requirements are not so strict, and breakfast is also the same.
         There are many waiters in the restaurant and the lobby, so the service is very good, what needs to be cleaned up, what needs to be prepared, and it can be handled even if it is a Saturday. It may be the Saturday of the summer vacation, the price has increased a lot, the occupancy rate should not be full, because the price is there!
        We booked a double-bed garden view, and the front desk gave us a free upgrade to sea view. The decoration of the hotel feels average. The selling point of the resort hotel is the beach. It is just outside the hotel. It is very beautiful and convenient. I took two children to play in the sand. I was very happy. Then there is the hotel's swimming pool. I went swimming for two days, and I was woken up early in the morning to swim. There is also the Beiqu House, which I only went to after I checked out. The children also like it very much. There are bobo balls, slides and so on. Ctrip ordered afternoon tea, which is very delicate.

I had breakfast the next day, and the restaurant told me that breakfast was not included, so I was puzzled. She said that she called the front desk to check and reported that breakfast was not included.
Then said give me one, somehow
Afterwards, I showed them the order and explained to me that it was not entered into the system at the front desk. It was very strange. Could it be my problem?

The beach is average, the lobby is very noisy, the breakfast room is also very noisy, and the dishes are average. It is recommended that if you want to live in a sea view room for vacation, you should not choose this

msg:Pros: The hotel is within a 3-5 minute walk from CITIC Jinshawan Water World. It is very close to the beach. The landscape pool and greenery are well done. Cons: The beach seems to be managed externally, and there is a time limit for its opening, even if it rains It is not open, and it is not open at night. For example, after four o'clock in the afternoon, when the rain stopped and the sea was calm, a few guests went down to the beach. As a result, a security guard called ten security guards to drive the guests ashore. Note that stepping on sea water is not allowed , but the beach is not allowed to enter. I have never encountered such a situation on the beaches of Sanya and Huizhou, even the free Dameisha in Shenzhen. The only time I was in Sanya Bay was when a typhoon was coming. The local security was only available under the risk of extreme bad weather. The staff urged the guests to leave. There are no beach chairs on this beach, maybe because tourists are afraid that the experience of the beach will be too good to leave. This may not be a problem with the hotel, it may be a problem with the surrounding management, so I still give the hotel five stars, but tourists who value the freedom of the beach may need to know more.

In addition, I hope that the hotel will not use large bottles of shower gel and shampoo for public use. There is news that some people will add foreign objects to it, so that we dare not use this large bottle for public use, and have to buy it ourselves. The beach is considered very good, of course, there is still a big gap with Sanya.

Very happy and happy stay experience! Daneil at the front desk knew that I was staying with the two elders and even gave me free breakfast! So caring! We are very moved! Feel extremely warm! This Marriott trip was worth it! Looking forward to seeing us again at the Marriott soon! There is also a rich breakfast in the hotel ~ various varieties ~ warm and thoughtful service! The products of the Chinese restaurant are also remarkable~ Shredded salt-baked chicken, fried mixed fish, mixed vegetables with fish eggs, and hooves are all worth recommending!

I thought it was an upgrade to the supreme sea view.
Regardless of the balcony view, the room is very nice.
There are 4 canned drinks in the refrigerator, but unfortunately I didn't take pictures. I like to soak jasmine tea bags in 7up, jasmine sparkling waterüòÅ

There are not many animals in the zoo. There are 2 sheep, an alpaca and a few rabbits. The visit is free. When I went there, the alpaca was sick, and they were fed stale lettuce and carrots, which cost 38 yuan a piece.
In addition to the relatively large outdoor swimming pool in the hotel, there is also a blue whale swimming pool with a depth of 1.5m. It is an infinity pool, but you can't see the sea very much. It is recommended to bring children to the outdoor swimming pool or indoor swimming pool downstairs.
Swimming in the sea is very clear, and you can see many small fish, especially near the float net.
If you come for a swimming holiday, it is recommended to bring a swimming ring, swimsuit, goggles and a swimming cap, and children's toys (such as sand digging tools.) After all, seaside things are quite expensive. A rest table by the sea is 120 yuan, and a single chair is 20 yuan. There are also water sports such as jet skis, which you can play if you like.
The hotel facilities are pretty good, but we need to talk about the buffet in the morning, only one pastry window and one porridge window belong to Chinese food, and there are very few kinds of steamed stuffed bun dim sum. The others are basically bread, different breads and jam cheese. . . Sorry for the price.

It was a bit noisy at night when there was a lawn wedding, and it was resolved quickly after reporting it to the guest center.
Because I left late and needed a late check-out, Daniel at the front desk was also very enthusiastic to help.
Overall positive.

The breakfast is very rich. Ctrip guests also have a special drink. Forgot what it was. The taste goes well with the summer heat.

Living in a deluxe sea view room, sitting on the balcony of the room, sipping your beloved afternoon tea, and looking at the endless sea, you feel like you are living in a fairyland on earth.

Service: There is a housekeeper, add you on WeChat, it is a must for those who are socially phobic, basically just tell the housekeeper and he will help to solve it. The takeaway is delivered by a robot to the door, which is very convenient.
The hotel has a beach, the sea is clear, blue-green, and the sand is rough, but it will not hurt your feet. There is a footbath on the shore, and the design is humanized. The children had a great time playing for two days, and every day they said they would come again tomorrow.
A little shortcoming is that there is no toilet seat for children. After all, it is a parent-child hotel, so you can consider matching it. But the quality of the toothpaste, toothbrush and bath gel in the hotel is really good
Thank you for leaving some good memories for our family

msg:Objective evaluation, the advantage is that although there is a gap with Sanya, the hardware is acceptable. But a hotel that is calculated and even fraudulent in terms of price cost. Let's get straight to the facts:
1. Vegetable prices fluctuated repeatedly, and finally overcharged. I have complained to the Consumers Association: First, the Chinese restaurant scanned the QR code to order less than 600 dishes, and it was almost 700 when I paid (the reason is that the prices seen are member prices, including the sum. , the regular price is shown in small print, and the payment is the regular price), at this time you are attracted to join the membership, I quickly add a member, because the system always makes mistakes and it takes 20 minutes before and after, and the food is cold. At the final checkout, not only was the price not cheap, but I went back, and it was still almost 700. This time I didn‚Äôt explain whether it was a member problem, but directly said that it was service fees and taxes. The evidence is solid. had to pay. The service charge is 10%,
2. Because the Consumers Association complained, the shopkeeper had no choice but to refund the overcharged money, saying that there was a mistake and there was no service fee, but it was just written like that, and it was the regular price.
3. Can the merchant understand this explanation? If there is no accident, there is an overcharge, and if there is an accident, just explain that the membership discount is expected to be reduced. But why should it be written as a 10% service charge? This is the key point, not a misunderstanding, but a misleading one. You can‚Äôt overcharge for membership discounts, and we have to pay for service fees unless you complain.
4. Then we also ate their seafood buffet. There are chat records to prove it. You can also see that the seafood buffet restaurant does not have any service fees and taxes. For restaurants in the same hotel, one menu fee includes service charges and the other does not. Isn't this misleading? It's because people who order food in Chinese restaurants are richer, so you think it's okay for them to charge more.
5. Seafood buffet, please pay attention, there are no more than five pieces of salmon at a time, and the vinegar dish is so big, if you don‚Äôt want to do it, don‚Äôt engage in seafood buffet. There is also Corona beer for seafood buffet, there are only a dozen bottles, that is to say, Corona is gone at the beginning of buffet, only Tsingtao beer.
6. Finally, for all breakfast buffets, seafood buffets, and hot dishes, basically those who come in 1 hour after the buffet starts will not be able to eat very hot dishes. The meat in the seafood buffet is basically cold when it is seated, that is, there is nothing hot. In the end, I can only order a hot pot, which is considered hot, but everyone understands the hot pot of the seafood buffet, right? You use the money from the seafood buffet to order Haidilao takeaway, you can eat it, and there is nothing in the seafood buffet. We asked for takeout from Seabed next door.
7. The ice cream in the seafood buffet is extremely unpalatable. Jushui, a seafood buffet that is basically cold dishes, has little salmon and the ice cream is unpalatable. I really don‚Äôt know where the money I earned is spent.
8. The scenery and the seaside are closed at 6 o'clock, but the biggest problem is that the private beach is too short, there are no deckchairs on the beach, and the deckchairs on the platform cannot see the sea, so you can only sit on the sand. But because of the length of our own beach, maybe the length of a basketball court, I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too much. There are other hotels in other places, and sometimes it‚Äôs blocked. But the width of the beach is not wide, it is several meters, as wide as a large truck or a medium truck. It is a short and narrow beach, especially on Saturdays when there are many people, and when the beach next to the hotel is closed, it is like dumpling, so it is impossible to put deck chairs, which is why there are no deck chairs.
9. The biggest disadvantage of the deluxe sea view room is the choice. There are huge differences. Our location is surrounded by three trees, which are very obstructive. I live in 7017. You must live in the deluxe sea view room opposite to 7017 to see the better view. complete sea.
10. Suggestions: (1) If you eat in a restaurant, you must confirm the price with him in advance, otherwise you may charge more service fees, and some restaurants do not, which is confusing. (2) The supreme sea view room is the front sea view, and the deluxe sea view room is the side sea view. If you book a deluxe sea view room, you must be on a high floor and you can only see it opposite 7017. The supreme sea view room is farther from the sea. If the price difference is large, it is not recommended. (3) The breakfast buffet is mainly noodles, and most of the meat in other regions is cold, and most of the meat is cold. (4) Do not go to the dinner buffet, except that most of them will be cooled, and the salmon can only be the size of a vinegar dish at a time. The price is not as good as a takeaway. Although the seafood buffet has hot pot, it is very difficult to eat. The key is that there are few items. It's better to order a hot pot takeaway. (5) The biggest selling point of this hotel is the sunset on the beach. The sunset is not bad, but customers who want to lie down on the beach for an afternoon may not come, because the beach is small and short, and there are no deck chairs on the beach. If you want to walk on the beach at night, don't come, because the beach closes at 6 o'clock. Those who want to walk on the beach don't have to. The length of the private beach basketball court, other places are sealed off by other hotels, it depends on whether other hotels will let you in. (6) Let‚Äôs talk about the cold drinks for afternoon tea, for example, the chocolate milkshake in the photo, everyone typed in to have a look, it‚Äôs all layered, it‚Äôs all water, where‚Äôs the chocolate? As for the milkshake, this is the price of 80 cups. Isn‚Äôt a random takeaway milkshake higher quality than this?
11. Finally, general advice: not recommended!

msg:I came from Wuxi, and it was my first time to stay in this hotel. It gave me a really good experience. I booked a deluxe sea view room. The night before I checked in, the manager called me and said that if there is a supreme sea view room, he will reserve an upgrade for me. Later, I got a free upgrade, thank you very much. I came here for the Chinese New Year. The layout on the first floor of the hotel is full of the joy of the Spring Festival. The room is very clean and large, with complete facilities, including an iron. The outdoor scenery is beautiful, it is very suitable for taking pictures and checking in. The hotel has a travel photography and photography service stationed in the hotel, which is very convenient. There is an amu*****t park in front of the hotel, it is very good to bring children to play. There are gardens, swimming pools, beaches, lawns, and a small zoo at the back door. The beach is very clean, the sea is very blue, not inferior to the sea in Sanya. Away from the hustle and bustle of the big city, the quiet and beautiful place here makes me feel very healed, I like it very much, and I will stay again next time I come to Shenzhen. There are also a variety of buffets, and the environment is very clean. The service staff of the hotel have a very good attitude. When getting on and off the bus, they will come to help open the door and carry the luggage. In short, all aspects are very good, which makes us feel very warm when we come from afar.

msg:It should be the third time to stay, and it is indeed the first time to write a review. I used to think it was very slow to check in every time; the buffet taste is very average, and some ingredients are not so fresh; the outdoor swimming pool opens too late in summer...but who makes him one of the few parents around Shenzhen who have a good sea view and are close to the beach What about the hotel? But this time, it was really disgusting. As soon as I entered the bathroom, I saw blood clots in the sink! At first glance, it looks like the kind of blood clots shed by my aunt! It's so obvious, and there are more than one places, can't the cleaning staff notice it? It's not the peak season yet, the sanitation is so perfunctory. Although someone was arranged to clean up after calling, the hygienic situation is really disgusting. Look at the "guarding with heart" in the room, it's really ironic

The hotel has upgraded the sea view room, you can watch the sunset from the balcony, the hotel beach is very clean, and there are not many people there on weekdays, it is very comfortable to go this season, neither hot nor cold with the sea breeze.
The hotel has large rooms, complete facilities, several restaurants, rich dishes, a wide view of the hotel planning, and a sense of design in the garden, which is very suitable for leisure and parent-child vacations.
Will recommend to friends and come again next time!

On the day of the trip, the owner of the hotel's guest relationship, Xiao Xi, took the initiative to contact me and gave us a small train ticket. When we arrived at the store, he gave us a free upgrade to a parent-child room with a high-rise sea view. He also gave us a child's breakfast ticket, which is really full of cuteness element. The sunset sea view at night is infinitely beautiful. There are cute animals in the park that can be fed, as well as beach delicacies. This trip is very satisfying‚úå

The whole hotel is backed by mountains and facing the sea, and it feels like a vacation by the sea in Southeast Asia. It takes nearly 3 hours to drive to Dapeng Island from Guangzhou. It is a bit far, but it is very close to Huidong, but it is worth it! The design of the hotel garden is beautiful and a**ospheric, similar to some of the original Sheraton resort hotels. It is good to take a walk in the garden after dinner. There will be singing and saxophone performances in the lobby bar at 8:00 pm. The performers are a couple from Venezuela, and you can order songs. Drinking beer, eating French fries, and listening to music can be considered a light drink. I heard a rooster crowing in the corridor of the guest room, and later I realized that it was a rooster raised by the hotel. There are alpacas, goats and peacocks on the side of the garden, and they can be fed at specified times. The children of Beiquwu went for a while, and went back to the room when they thought it was not fun. The Western-style pastries for breakfast are more delicious, but the Chinese food is really not good. Jiameixuan Chinese restaurant mainly serves Teochew dishes. Although the price is high, the portions are substantial and the taste is authentic. There is no additional charge for BYO drinks. The water temperature of the indoor constant temperature swimming pool is about 28 degrees, and it is very comfortable to swim. There are some bad things, I hope the hotel can improve it, the shampoo bottle in the room is empty, it should be replaced in time during cleaning, otherwise you can't call to add shampoo when you take a shower! During breakfast, I heard staff chatting and swearing. These may need to be strengthened. I am very grateful to Jessie for contacting in advance and helping to prepare the children's toiletries, and also upgraded the room, which is very considerate!

environment:
There is a sandy beach outside the hotel, which is very suitable for leisurely walks, and you don't need to go to the scenic spots to be crowded. It has a Southeast Asian flavor and is very beautiful.
You can watch the sunrise and sunset from the balcony of the sea view room, which is great
Service: It's ok, maybe it's because there are so many passengers during the Spring Festival and I'm tired. I didn't take the initiative to tell where to eat when I checked in, and I didn't notice that the order included breakfast. But it can also be understood during the Spring Festival.
I will consider bringing my family to live next time!

The little brother at the front desk (forgot to ask for his name politely) was very enthusiastic and helped arrange a family on one floor (helped upgrade a room type for free). He also thoughtfully and proactively set up free parking for vehicles. During the period, the "orthodontic retainer" was lost in the restaurant, and the manager of the restaurant tried his best to help find it (although it was never found). The buffet dinner is recommended, with a wide variety of varieties, and the children enjoyed it very much.
Beiqu House: It is relatively small, and the young lady inside is not very enthusiastic (as well as patient and gentle with children). The impression is not particularly good.
Breakfast: good. Desserts are plentiful.
Service: Add chicken legs to the younger brother and younger sister at the front desk.

Service: Before check-in, the hotel housekeeper contacted in advance to confirm the check-in situation. During the stay, if there are any questions or needs, the housekeeper will also serve in a timely manner and help communicate, which is very comfortable.
Room: The room was lucky, and it was upgraded to a room with a good view. It was very spacious and the balcony had a beautiful view. It is also very quiet at night, you can blow the sea breeze and listen to the waves on the balcony. It is much quieter than the lively one at the end of the field.
Beach: There is a hotel beach, unfortunately you can't go into the water on this day, but you can take a walk on the beach and take pictures. The sea view is average, but the sunset is still beautiful, suitable for sunset photos.
Dinner: Had a dinner buffet and breakfast buffet. The dinner buffet is similar to other Marriott's I've been to before. There are not many people during the week so the a**osphere is also good and quiet during dinner. The self-service desserts are very rich. I ate a lot of them without stepping on the thunder. Maybe I ate them after swimming and ate a lot of them in one go. Salmon sashimi is fresh. There are not many types of seafood. For personal reasons, I only ate shrimp, which are very fresh and sweet. Some hot dishes can be improved, and the taste can be richer.
Garden: The biggest feature of this hotel is the garden. The garden design is beautiful, and many locations are suitable for taking pictures. Catch up on taking pictures when the weather is good, the film is really good.
Breakfast: For breakfast, praise bread, there are many choices, and the taste is not bad. The overall restaurant's baked goods are outstanding.
Swimming pool: It was mid-week and off-season, so there were very few people. The water is very clean, and no one is very cool.
Golf: I experienced a round of mini golf. The venue is limited and I can only push the ball. It's good to play for half an hour. Good for relaxation.
There are not many entertainment facilities near the hotel, and the nearby water park is not open. Basically, it is played in the hotel. It is more suitable for one or two days' stay, and it is more suitable for relaxation. In the off-season, the price/performance ratio is quite good, and there are many fewer people.

Facilities: Parking is completely free, and parking spaces are always available! We also went to visit the infrastructure, gym, swimming pool, etc., which are generally quite complete. If we can jointly create a package with the water world next to it, I believe it will attract more tourists to come and play!
Sanitation: Cheney helped us upgrade the suite. The suite has almost no dead ends, and there will be no dust and occupancy marks. This is worth praise!
In general, it is worth paying for this room fee if there is a small corner in Shenzhen that is vacant! I don't know if it's because of the off-season, the lack of people actually makes me feel like I'm getting back to Chiang Mai's vacation. This experience is totally worth the price~

There is nothing near Sofitel, the bedding is similar, and the decoration of Sofitel is strong, but there is no comparison. After all, the cities are different. In general, Marriott, Sandalwood, Sheraton, Jiahua, and Marriott are the strongest. If the year is new, try Judiaosha and Amy some other day. Marriott is cost-effective, with strong gardens and privacy, and it's OK to bring children. For more breakfast buffet items, please refer to Sanya Autograph

This Marriott is a hotel that I have been thinking about for a long time, and I finally checked in this vacation. The environment is very beautiful, the little brother at the front desk is very good, we arrived early and upgraded us to the care room. But the care room is not so loving. There is no door in the bathroom, and the wet and dry cannot be separated. The breakfast is very rich, this is the most interesting hotel I have ever seen, Sydney is actually a whole one! If you want to eat, you have to ask the manager of the restaurant, and the manager will go to the chef to peel the pears. After breakfast, the pears have not been peeled. There is a cute pet garden where two sheep and one alpaca live, which can be fed. The children like it very much. As for Beiquwu, I didn't find the fun. The child walked in and said, "Mom, let's go." More than 3,000 hotels a night! to be frank! This is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in! Maybe we are not advanced enough! Should have stayed in a better room!

The pool and the beach are children's favorites and worth a day's vacation.
The service is overall satisfactory. When checking in, Mike at the front desk presented two breakfast coupons for the children, which was especially praised. However, breakfast is generally early, preferably before 9 o'clock, otherwise there may be a long queue to enter the restaurant during the holiday.
Two small suggestions, the consumption order of the mini bar can be put together with the small freezer. In addition, if the facilities of Beiquwu (Kids Club) can be more abundant, it can be more divided.

The location of the hotel is excellent. It is opposite to the beach. Although it is not a private beach, there are not many people and it is quiet and comfortable. The water quality of the beach is crystal clear. The happiest time is when the tide is high in the evening. Children are surfing with their beloved swimming rings, and adults are listening to the sound of the waves while blowing the sea breeze.

Especially the hotel beach, the sea water is relatively transparent and clean, you can rest assured that children can play in the water (I took the children, it happened to be a rainy and cloudy day, so the photos could not be seen), the only shortcoming is that it is an inevitable common problem in summer. ,too many people! If you come to avoid the summer vacation, I believe you will have a very good experience ~ I will come back when my children start school

Just a paper cup costs 68 yuan. It's too scary. , to put it nicely, it is a gift, but in fact, all residents can enter.
There is also a children's playground, and the fee is 68 an hour!
Hygiene: I dare not say, the floor is still a pile of "goose feathers"
Service: Check-in is at 16:00, but the next day it was raining heavily and yellow torrential rain. We couldn't go out all morning. The children watched TV in the room all morning.
Environment: From the balcony, the environment should be good! But because of the heavy rain, we haven't been to their gardens or their beaches, we can't take pictures, and we don't even have a small train, so I haven't seen their "beautiful environment"!
You can send photos in every room, but on Ctrip, it is said to be a gift, which is a great gift! I don‚Äôt have to take pictures on rainy days. I‚Äôm begging to take pictures indoors or outside where the rain is covered, but I don‚Äôt agree! !

First, at 14:45, I checked in to the room being cleaned, and I had to run up and down the stairs to change the room card. The room was said to be a sea view room, and the sea was only in a small area of sight in the distance. I seriously suspected that the room was downgraded because of the adjus**ent of the room. Because I have children with me, I don't care about it anymore. Then after checking out, the deposit will not be refunded until the evening. If I don‚Äôt call to remind me, I don‚Äôt know if the deposit will be refunded! The price/performance ratio is extremely low. Will never stay again.

msg:Summary: The hotel is dirty and messy, and the possibility of the new crown will be higher, because foreigners are not required to wear masks at all, and friends who go there should go home for three days. Not recommended, will not come again. The reasons are as follows:
1. Dirty. A lot of dust can be seen on the head of the bed; the toilet floor is full of urine. The room was filled with the smell of a big sewer, and after a night of sleep, the whole body was bitten by unknown insects. Nothing like a 5 star hotel
2. Chaos. It takes a long time to check in. The staff said that someone will inform you that you can check in, but no staff will notify you after waiting for a few hours. During the epidemic, foreigners are not required to wear masks at all, while Chinese do, which is a real double standard. When refunding the deposit, the hotel will charge an additional service fee of a few cents.
3. Poor. Poor sound insulation, can hear sounds from corridors and upstairs. Facility is outdated. I booked a double bed room and gave a double bed room. I wanted an extra bed. The small bed provided was seriously sunken, so that three people were required to squeeze a bed. The buffet dishes for breakfast and dinner are also not up to the standard of a five-star hotel.

msg:We booked for 2 nights, and we got the room quickly on the first day. The receptionist was also very polite. Maybe because of the epidemic, the beach was also closed, and there were not many people. There are 2 wave pools for young children in the hotel, one is charged and the other is free. In addition, the swimming pool is very thin, and there are many small sand and stones at the bottom of the pool, and there are 3 steps of stairs under the bottom of the shallow water area and deep water area. This design is no problem, but why is there no colored mark on the bottom? You know, I almost got hurt üò§.
I also learned two days before check-in that the hotel beach is not for swimming, only to play in the water, emphasizing that the hotel stipulates that their beach is absolutely not allowed to swim, so friends who want to book should think clearly. We bought water park tickets the next day for 198 yuan on-site and 30 yuan for lockers! Although the park is a bit smaller, it can be played for 3 hours, and the hotel is not far away by walking, about 5 minutes.
Breakfast is ok, lots of choices, for lunch and dinner we drive to a nearby seafood restaurant.
All in all, I feel that the hardware facilities of this hotel are average and need to be improved. Compared with Dameisha Intercontinental, we will choose Dameisha Intercontinental again. The swimming pool is large and there are activities for children, and the beach can swim freely.

msg:Because of the epidemic, I still chose to take a vacation in Shenzhen this year, and I specially booked the Shenzhen Kaisa Marriott Hotel, which has a good reputation in terms of environment and reputation. After checking in, I feel very good, the waiters are very professional and very polite; the exterior scenery of the hotel is very charming and suitable for taking pictures; the outdoor swimming pool is small but very clean, and the children swim very happily. But what can be borrowed is that the beach is temporarily closed because of the epidemic, and you can only look at the clean and beautiful beach from a distance. In addition, the bed is a little small and it seems that it is not as big as 1.8 meters. The most unsatisfactory thing about this stay is the cost of the Chinese restaurant and western restaurant in the hotel, which is really expensive. The breakfast is 198 yuan per person, and the evening buffet is 358 yuan per person (this price is equivalent to the dinner buffet cost of two large and one small at the Sheraton Guangzhou Aoyuan Hotel last year). The three of them have not yet eaten at 198 yuan üò≠ A green vegetable in a Chinese restaurant is priced at 88 yuan. As a native of Shenzhen, I am thinking that the price of Shenzhen has far surpassed many big cities in the world. Unbelievable üò± The price of the hotel is understandably higher than usual, but it cannot be unacceptably expensive. Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip customer service staff Feifei, who is very professional and quickly solved the breakfast problem for meüëç

msg:When I first arrived, the first impression of the environment was ok, and the porter service was ok, which fully conformed to the image of Marriott.
When I was queuing to check in, I suddenly felt the speed of Southeast Asia. In fact, it didn't matter. I was originally here for a vacation, and a slow pace was acceptable. After checking in.
After arriving in the room, oh my god, the service line and the "0" service call have always been able to get through, and no one has ever listened to it, so forget it, here, it has already deviate from the standard of a five-star hotel.
In the bathroom of my best friend's room, even the pee from the previous resident is still on the toilet boardü•≤.
I live on the 6th floor and my best friend lives on the 5th floor. I want to go down to find my best friend. I ask the staff, can my card "di" go to the 5th floor? The reply is, you have to take the stairs of the safe passage, ok, then I will go down the stairs, but this is an anti-human design, as long as you enter the stairs, you cannot open the door to enter any floor, I can only keep patting the door, Make a sound and wait for my girlfriend to find the safe passage door where I am to open the door and let me out.
Then the next day, I didn‚Äôt go downstairs to eat breakfast and slept until 10:00, then I wanted to call to order food, but the service call was still in a state of being able to get through and no one answered. I contacted the front desk, and told the book that the breakfast order that ends at 11:00 will not be accepted. I can only order the full-time meal that starts at 11:00. This has puzzled me, but I choose to cooperate with the order for the whole day. Meal, after all, I was hungry. After ordering, I told you that all-day meals can only be made at 11 o'clock, so I can't make an order now, because it is not before 11 o'clock, well, I really can't understand.
By the way, the service line has never been answered. Since I checked in, no one has answered it. Then the lady at the front desk replied me fiercely, "We don't have enough staff, so we can't be busy to answer the phone." The provision of services is not the end of the charge, and the lack of manpower is not a reason that guests should know and understand.
She said this, I feel that I don't understand them now. Living in so many five-star hotels, different places and different countries, it is not only this Marriott that will be full of rooms, but only this Marriott can give me such an attitude of service. , This is the first time I have heard such an explanation. Marriott has lived in other cities and was once a member. I have never experienced such fierce service.
A first-tier city, a five-star brand, a must!

The room service speed needs to be improved, and it takes a long time to deliver things! We stayed in an executive room, which included simple meals. Although it was a simple meal, it couldn't be done in such a simple way. There was nothing else to eat except fried rice! Unlike other five-star hotels I have stayed in before, there are many choices! I hope this hotel will improve! Everything else is fine in my opinion!

The children had a great time in the swimming pool and said they would come again next time. Environment Beach pool renovation services are nothing to fault. Excellent!
The only trouble is that people who live in such high-end hotels are still stealing other people's things. I went downstairs to play in the water with the child, took a bathrobe and put it in the bag, along with the swimming goggles and the water gun. wing and fly. I really convinced this guy who took care of the sheep. There is a large towel provided by the swimming pool next to it. As for taking other people's things. Fortunately, the housekeeper said it was okay to lose it, and he comforted me to send another one over.
Thank you, butler, come back next time!

There are decorations around, and there are messy decoration spots outside the garden room; third, the beach is only open from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, which is very inconvenient, and it is very unpleasant to bring children; fourth, this hotel does not know the mentality, The whole line circled around and stopped people from passing and taking pictures; fifth, the breakfast place was too small, and if you didn‚Äôt go early for breakfast, you would have to queue for a long time. There was a problem with the management of the entire hotel, and the overall feeling was very bad. Won't be going again!

Due to the epidemic, we can only play around Shenzhen, and there are no marine projects. It is said that Shenzhen has banned the sea. It means that there are more family trips. It is not because there are fewer people on holidays, and the service is particularly in place.
The only thing to avoid is the lo-mei platter (268 servings) in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. The goose meat is really hard and woody. I can't believe the level of this chef is Chaoshan Luwei.

There are two rooms on different floors in the area separated by 108,000 miles. . I asked him to arrange a more convenient room, or they said that they had to wait for more than an hour if they wanted to have a room with a good orientation... just think about it! During the May 1st period, there were still quite a lot of people. The overall holiday feeling was quite satisfactory, and the environment was very beautiful! Especially the blue sky and white clouds on the second day of 5.3, the beautiful garden leading to the seaside, the light and shadow effect is very intoxicating! But from the design of the hotel, the space is not transparent enough. The design of the corridor really has the feeling of a guest house. The decoration of the room and the overall texture of the hotel are not as good as other five-star hotels. This hotel is better than the location, good location! The variety of breakfast service is ok. The price during May 1st is inflated. Nearly 4,000 a night for a garden view room. The scenery you see is not comparable to the scenery downstairs in my community. This kind of price/performance ratio is not worth it.

Although it is a foreign brand hotel, don't forget that it is operating in China. The double standard attitude of the hotel towards Chinese and foreigners is very annoying! Strict management during the epidemic in Shenzhen is true, but it should not only be aimed at Chinese people. Foreigners gather in the hotel lobby, do not wear masks, laugh loudly! Tell the front desk to reflect the situation in exchange for a blank eye! We check in and out of public places on the beach and remind us to wear masks. Can foreigners be special? The food queue guide had already guided us to our seats, and the staff behind insisted that we vacate our seats for the foreign families behind! The big four and one small are not counted as 5 people, are the big three and two in foreign countries only 5 people? It is required to wear masks in the public areas of eating and drinking, and children are required to wear masks when they pick up their meals. My old lady asked the staff where the hot milk was, and the waiter asked her to ask the chef, which really made me speechless! Stay for two nights, only make a bed in the room, the floor is not cleaned, the used coffee cup is not cleaned, even the coffee spoon is not washed, free coffee, toiletries are only given for one night, empty bottle None! The service is not as good as that of a business hotel. If there is a next time, the reservation has to be booked for one night and one night. If you book an extra night, you will suffer. In short, except for the beautiful scenery, everything else is not good! The worst of all 5 star hotels! correct! Don't be fooled by Beiqu House, it's not open at all

There is a small sofa on the balcony, you don't have to do anything, it is very comfortable to sit on the sofa and enjoy the scenery and the sea breeze! Also a special thanks to Bessie for sending my daughter a breakfast buffet! Maybe these few days are the off-season plus the epidemic situation, there are fewer people, and it feels like a private venue wherever you go! Not crowded at all! For dinner, we drove to the nearby Dapeng Center for dinner. The hotel also has a buffet and a Chinese restaurant.

It felt far from the first eleven, and the night might be terrifying and peaceful. The hotel communicated and changed the room, but it took half an hour to wait, because some rooms were under maintenance. There should be few guests in the hotel during the recent epidemic, and more convenient cakes should be provided to the guests. For example, upgrading the room type and late check-out can give a relatively good experience.
Breakfast and dinner at the hotel are not too comfortable, especially at night. It is very good to sing on weekends, and I will interact with the children. The children are very happy to play with paper airplanes. My little ones also had fun in Beiquwu, but they were quite small. You can pay more attention to the hygiene of the room, the outdoor facilities are comfortable and the weather feels good, and the balcony is also very comfortable.

msg:Service: Service is not ideal!
Having lived in many Marriott series, this "Kaisa" has discredited the Marriott series. Very disappointed! Just a few words.
‚ë†Check in on the 23rd, and the guy at the front desk completes the formalities. There is no guidance on where to get to the room, where to eat breakfast, and when to eat it. If you ask one question, you will answer one, if you don't ask, there will be no response. This is completely inconsistent with the brand's positioning, and I don't know if the young man is tired.
‚ë°For breakfast in restaurant No. 24, I asked an aunt who was hot with soup noodles in the dining area whether the buns in the cage were meat buns or vegetable buns. He actually replied: I haven't eaten it, I don't know. Really shocking.
‚ë¢I don't dare to praise the sanitation of the open-air swimming pool. It is really average, and it cannot be called a swimming pool. It should be a leisure pool.
‚ë£The typhoon came on the 25th, the beach was closed in the afternoon on the 23rd, and the beach was not opened on the 24th. The other two hotels with exclusive beaches in the same Shenzhen area were closed on the 25th. Maybe Marriott cares more about tourists than the other two. So the next day I decided to switch to another one.
The first time I commented on other people's bad comments, I probably spent more than 3,000 yuan. I didn't expect to get such an experience in order to bring my baby to experience. I feel a little angry. During the two days of staying, I also saw and heard countless complaints at the hotel...
Before choosing a hotel, I also read everyone's comments, this time it's a return to see everyone's comments before.
Hope to give Kaisa's positive suggestions for improvement!

The deepest impression of this trip is that Bessie, the staff member, called the room in advance and asked for the room in advance, and quickly upgraded the deluxe sea view double room to the supreme sea view twin room. The fly in the oin**ent is that the breakfast is small and expensive. The height of a child of 150cm is 198 yuan per adult. Of course, the breakfast food is still relatively rich.

Compared with the Dameisha Intercontinental the night before, the gap felt a little obvious. I took a shower after ten o'clock in the evening, but there was no shower gel, and the big bottle was empty. The bath water was either scalding or cold, and it was difficult to adjust. After finally adjusting it, it suddenly became cold in the middle, which is quite speechless. The bed was also very uncomfortable. The breakfast the next day was also sp****. In addition to the good natural scenery, the hardware and software of the hotel really do not match the price of 2315 per night. Basically no bad reviews, but this time it was really unpleasant.

Ask about luggage storage, and the answer is to put the luggage against the wall...
In addition to the 48-hour nucleic acid requirement for check-in, 48-hour nucleic acid is also required to leave the store, inquire about the nearest nucleic acid point, and answer your own online search...
The waiter camille communicated with a high tone throughout the whole process, and he looked like he was a luxury and very noble...
The most exaggerated thing is that at 10:40 p.m., when the elderly and children were already asleep, the waiter suddenly opened the door and came in and said to deliver water to us, but we did not want water delivery service...

After all this series of events happened, the hotel did not take any measures. The hotel told me that the waiter knocked on the door with water and no one answered, and then entering the door was in compliance with the hotel regulations. As for the wrong delivery, the hotel smeared the door and scared the customer. The hotel said that the waiter remembered the wrong room number. ...
The whole communication process in the hotel was like I was wrong, but how do you take my attitude, interpreting arrogance and unreasoning to the extreme...

msg:During the epidemic, I couldn‚Äôt leave Shenzhen, so I brought the elderly and children here for vacation. I informed the hotel through Ctrip that it was my family‚Äôs ***** birthday in advance. The hotel quickly provided memorial service and applied for late check-out. On the day of check-in, Daniel at the front desk was very attentive. He confirmed the check-in details with me one by one, and took the trouble to modify the delivery time of the birthday cake. The housekeeper Bessie gently informed the opening hours of the hotel's facilities, and helped us take the elderly and children to the elevator. It makes people feel like a spring breeze, showing a good professional quality. The hotel room is clean and hygienic, with five-star facilities, especially the bed and quilt, which are very comfortable, and I slept very well here. The beach is clean, the children played all afternoon, the old man was basking in the sun, in a daze, and playing with his mobile phone, it was very pleasant.

[Facilities] The swimming pool is not open due to the epidemic. The so-called free Beiqu House is actually a coin-operated charging item. The other Pengpeng Club is more like a hotel children's playground, but the hotel guests only play for free for half an hour. It's not very friendly to parent-child families, but the little train children are happy, but the price is not high
[Room] This time, the hotel helped to upgrade the room type. Thank you very much. The room is relatively large. Compared with the nearby Internet celebrity homestay, I prefer to live here. Sleeping is not very stable, it is recommended to prepare another pillow for guests to choose
[Breakfast] It is quite satisfactory, there is not much bright spot, but there are all the things that should be there, and the environment is comfortable

msg:The beach security of Kaisa Hotel is simply a *** nature, with collusion in every link: as a guest during the epidemic, you have to cooperate with scanning the code and showing the green code nucleic acid to enter the beach. These are the responsibilities and obligations of citizens. However, on July 14, 2022, my husband brought his children to enter the beach and was required to show the room card. My husband asked: Can I register with the room number? The other party said no. So my husband still abided by the hotel regulations and waited beside him with his children under the scorching sun, waiting for his daughter to give him the room card. When he got the room card and handed it to the security guard on duty, the security guard did not take it at all and did not register anything. He just said it was okay, go in. Excuse me, why can the guests before and after my husband enter the beach just by scanning the code and handwriting the room number to enter? No need to show room card at all? Please explain! Okay, then after playing on the beach, we wanted to return to the hotel. The security guard on duty at that time intercepted my husband and children and asked them to scan the code again. My husband said that we had already scanned it when entering. The security guard said that we had to scan it when we returned. My husband asked them to show the document that required scanning the code when entering and leaving the beach. The other party could not produce it. Then my husband said that the leader‚Äôs notification on WeChat would be fine. The other party could not produce it either. There was no notice next to it saying that the code had to be scanned when returning to the beach or the hotel. The other party restricted and intercepted my husband and children. May I ask again, why don‚Äôt you let other guests scan the code twice when returning to the hotel from the beach? These can be proved from the surveillance video. First of all, if you want to perform this second scan, then the hotel should issue a notice to inform, and all guests should do this equally. Why did you not let my husband leave the beach without scanning the code? And you didn‚Äôt ask other guests to do so? What‚Äôs the reason? Is my husband a criminal? Or are you jealous of his handsomeness? Or is he a positive carrier? Please explain to the hotel why you don't treat all guests equally. This is proven by the 110 monitoring on that day! You later had the so-called security captain and hotel coordinator. These people in the hotel have not figured out their mistakes and realized that their epidemic prevention policies are not in place. They are there to forcefully protect a small security guard who does his job well every day. This security guard also called his mother, wife, and children to the hotel. Are you still ************? Or are you preparing for a group fight? This incident of Kaisa restricting and intercepting guests and children is very bad. The hotel has not made any explanation so far. I will further expose the incident to the TV station and the relevant departments to intervene in the progress of the incident...

On Saturday, there will be more people, and there will be Lexus events again. Breakfast has to be queued to enter the venue. It is the same as Liz in Shanghai on New Year‚Äôs Day. It is too difficult to be artificial, but there is no way. All the little brothers and sisters are already very hard.

The best thing about the room is that there is a small door that can be opened between the two rooms. It is very convenient for children to come in and run around without having to open the door. I am so happy.
There are not many people in the hotel, and the beach is beautiful. It is the first time I watched the sunset on the beach with my baby. This season, the sea is slightly cool, but it's not too much sun. Don't worry about sunburn.
It is worth mentioning that the Chinese food in the hotel was delicious after three meals, and the service was very meticulous. I liked almost every dish we ordered.

msg:The five-star Binhai Resort Hotel in Shenzhen never disappoints. I have stayed at Judiaosha and Dameisha Jingji Intercontinental, every time I feel full of happiness. The environment and service are all five-star. What surprised me most this time is that the beach here can dig out a lot of seafood haha. I can pick up shells here for two days, which is so fun. I plan to go again next month.

msg:Go to the hotel early in the morning to register a note in advance, saying that the child is allergic to dust and needs to ensure hygiene. After waiting for a few more hours to do the sanitation trea**ent, the result is as shown in the picture. After calling to complain, no one came to clean it after waiting for more than half an hour, and only after the second call did someone come to change the pillow and clean it briefly.
It was 11:30 in the evening, and there were always children making noise in the corridor. Complaints were fruitless, and the sound insulation was poor.
Overall it is quite disappointing and the service attitude is average. There are no food delivery robots for food delivery üòÇ~ Apart from the large area, I really don't think there is anything outstanding in terms of hygiene and service with Aloft.

I went to see it on the spot. I was a little disappointed that the homestays were too dense and the beach was occupied by a lot of homestays. I temporarily booked Marriott, but there are actually no rooms left. The butler Bessie contacted me soon and sent me the location and the children‚Äôs play schedule. The check-in was also very fast.

The service staff of the hotel are very polite and feel good whether it is the parking lot, the front desk, the restaurant or the cleaning.
The rooms are relatively spacious and the facilities are well maintained except for the carpets. However, the difficulty of maintaining the carpets used in resort hotels by the sea is understandable. There is also a deluxe sea view room in the side wing, and there is not much sea view, so the word "luxury" does not describe the sea view.
After eating the buffet dinner and breakfast, there were many people but orderly. I would like to give a thumbs up. There are many types of food, and supplements are considered timely.
The beach has a general sea view and you can watch the sunset. The waves are larger and the sand is thicker, but the children's world and water world have been newly opened around it, and it has become part of the largest amu*****t center on the east coast of Shenzhen, which is still very promising.

msg:This time I came to Marriott as a very temporary itinerary. When I arrived at the hotel at 1:30 in the afternoon, luckily I met Bessie, a great lobby attendant, who helped us check in in advance, and then let us go to the beach and wait for 3 o‚Äôclock to check in after sending our luggage ( Housing is still quite tight on weekdays, it is recommended to make an appoin**ent in advance).
Arrange the supreme big bed room with frontal ocean view. The room has the usual Marriott style and is very comfortable. However, it is not easy to maintain the sanitation and equipment of the seaside hotel. Some rooms have a slight trace of age and the flaws are not concealed.
When you enter the room, you can feel relaxed and vacationing. The garden view + sea view from the balcony makes people travel to Southeast Asia in a second. The hotel‚Äôs beach (from 9:00 to 19:00) suggests that you can go for a walk in the morning or at sunset. It‚Äôs a good experience to relax with the sea breeze.
The beach is filled with small shells entrained in sand, and the stepping feel is not so detailed. It is a pity to enter the sea because the danger circle is relatively small (you can touch the ground at the farthest buoy).
When I went this time, the infinity pool was not open, and there were some constructions in the surrounding area, but it can be seen that this hotel will have more facilities inves**ent in the future, and I look forward to having more good memories next time.
Overall, if you like a hotel-style leisurely vacation, apart from the slightly higher price, this hotel is really a good choice.

1. The quality of the door may be the level of the guest house. I really don't know how it was checked and accepted when it was constructed. See Figure 1-3
2. There is almost no cave under the bed, garbage and some sundries visible to the naked eye. See picture four
3. Known as a sea view room, can you find where the sea is in Figure 5? Isn't this foolish consumers afraid of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to investigate? Ctrip can't help the abuser.
4. The courage to charge for the little train and Beiquwu really does not know where it came from. I beg you to learn about the entertainment items at the same price in Macau.
It's a pity that there is such a nice bay. I have been there when I first opened. There were a lot of problems at that time, and it can be said that it was a trial period. Now this quality really insults the Marriott brand.

msg:Negative Ratings! The worst Marriott I have ever stayed in! Especially the service!

Especially Justin Hou at checkin! !

  1. I booked the Supreme Ocean View Room, but I gave it to a construction site view room. See picture 1. After the complaint, another female duty manager changed the room for me. She was indifferent and didn't apologize. She said lightly, "Because I didn't clean up just now, I gave it to that room." That is to say, if I don't ask for it, I will spend the money of the supreme room to live in a standard room on the construction site!

  2. Here comes the most outrageous. Because my two children need an extra bed, their extra bed is divided into two types, including breakfast and without breakfast. The price difference is more than 100. When I called the customer service hotline, I said to order breakfast first, but I don‚Äôt Determine if you can get up for breakfast. We really couldn't get up for breakfast the next day. When I checked out, it happened to be this Justin again. I said that I didn't have breakfast. If you want to change the extra bed, it doesn't include breakfast. He said, "You just said it now, it's very troublesome"... I was shocked at the time. Is this a five-star hotel? Is this a Marriott? Is there anyone who talks like this? I said, what did you say, he might realize that he had said something wrong, and he quickly helped me check out. How troublesome is this then?

  3. When parking at the hotel, you need to register your license plate at the front desk. He didn‚Äôt tell me at all. It was not until I was told that I would charge 120 yuan for the parking fee when I got out of the car that night. Go to the front desk to register on the field.

  4. When checking in, he suddenly yelled "that auntie, don't block the robot". It turned out that it was 5 meters away. An aunt who was waiting to check in was curious about seeing the robot delivering things. She looked at it and blocked its way. Why is there such a big deal? Is there anyone shouting like this? You can let your colleague go over and speak softly, yelling from so far away, and everyone looks at the aunt for an instant, with no basic politeness.

Other service staff are not as bad as him, but they feel that they are not well trained and have insufficient service awareness.

Let's talk about the hotel environment. There is an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor swimming pool. There is a distance from the beach, and the sand on the beach is transported from other places, it is very thick.

In general, will not go again.

msg:Overall it is good, the sea view is really beautiful, the water is very good, the beach is OK, much better than the one in Huizhou, and the service is also good. The rooms are also good. The layout facilities are similar to those of the big hotels in Macau. They are very comfortable. My favorite is the air conditioning in the rooms. It is really quiet. I have stayed in many five-star hotels at home and abroad. This is the quietest hotel, so I sleep at night Very good. However, some of the amu*****t facilities have not been built and there are not too many things to play. People from the hotel have said that there are large shopping malls and water amu*****t facilities under construction, and then they can continue to go there. It can be seen that a large area is surrounded by the Kaisa Group under construction. It is estimated that it should be relatively large in the future. But that cafeteria is really awful, not cheap, breakfast and dinner are not delicious, the products are not complimented, and the food is not up to grade, I will not eat this buffet again next time.

Because we came to the breakfast restaurant during the summer vacation, there were a lot of people, and we had to queue up late to go.

I just met a small peak on the day of check-in
So many people

Check in waiting for a while, it's pretty efficient
We went to celebrate our birthday and upgraded the room type
But I want to talk about it here
The layout is really a bit deductible
I called in advance to communicate
I wanted to let the birthday star open the door and be moved
Unexpectedly, nothing
Called to chase, said we can get it when we go out for afternoon tea
After afternoon tea, I still have nothing
Call me again
At the end, I feel a little complaint.
I immediately called Auntie over to arrange
Actually put a few words and make some balloons
My understanding is that it does not take 5 minutes
I can understand that many people were really busy that day
But I have communicated a few days in advance
Can't it be prepared in advance?

As for other scenery facilities
The service other than this birthday decoration is also good
Just what Marriott should be~
Seriously, I'm still willing to go again
The view of the sea is so beautiful
But I only hope that the service can be a little more thoughtful!
