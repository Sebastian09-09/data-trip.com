Only cons were that the lack of food choices onsite, it‚Äôs not a problem if you drive, and some of the facilities were not open in the colder months. Hot spring and animal farm were really enjoyable. Staff were all very kind, friendly and helpful. My kids enjoyed it so much we extended by an extra day. We will love to visit again during warmer months in summer to enjoy the beach.

 Just one suggestion of improvement is the bouncy playground beside camping area. It would be great if is clean and sanitized.

There are many activities in the resort, including children's playground, cute pet park, water projects, small train, carousel, and Nian Gao didn't want to go home after playing. The parent-child suite has an exclusive parking space, and the door of the room is right at the door when you get off the car. It couldn't be better. The slide in the rainforest parent-child suite may have been slid 50 times, and there is also a tree house for the children to take a sweet nap on it, which is so happy. In addition to dining in the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant, you can also deliver the food to the house, which is still hot when it is delivered. In the middle of the night, when the babies are asleep, mom and dad can have a midnight barbecue, which is comfortable. The service staff are also very patient and kind. Special thanks to the housekeeper Zhang Xiaoli, who took the initiative to contact me the day before check-in and informed me of various consultations so that we can arrange the time in advance. The whole trip was great, and Nian Gao said he would come to experience the Star Suite next time.

The aunt from the housekeeping department took the initiative to help us move our luggage when she saw us check in, and also lit the mosquito coil tray for us at the door, which was very considerate. There are many parent-child facilities, both free and paid, and you can play here all day. The only thing that can be improved is that the breakfast area is too compact, and you have to queue up to get the dishes. The breakfast room is actually quite large, and it can be placed a little more dispersed, so that the crowd will not be so crowded.

The security uncle near the lobby is particularly professional and enthusiastic. He reminded us to bring our ID to check in and not to take our luggage, because the check-in place is not in the lobby. We stayed in the first row of parent-child suites. There is a lake view from the balcony, which is pleasing to the eyes. The slides and Lego in the room are enough for children to play, and the projected cartoons have never been turned on. The hot spring is a real spring, and the skin is so smooth after soaking. The small ranch is really mini, and there are many small animals. Except for a kangaroo that is a little lonely, the others seem to live happily. The peacocks are working hard to spread their tails, the piglets are racing hard, and the alpacas are strolling around to hook up with children. I also saw capybaras at close range, which are known to be emotionally stable, friendly and harmless [snickering] I booked a barbecue table next to the sand pit. The price is much more expensive than usual on May Day. The a**osphere is good and there are few people. The ingredients are also okay. I grilled and ate while not affecting the children building a "city" in the sand pit next to it. I am very satisfied.

I couldn‚Äôt book the popular Rainforest Parent-Child Suite for weeks in advance. A week before departure, I suddenly found a room available, so I decided to get it. The recent weather in Shanghai The weather is getting warmer and everything is recovering, so it is very suitable for travel. The resort is about an hour away from downtown Shanghai. The resort is very big. It takes about 2 kilometers from the entrance to the hotel lobby. Remember to pull out the etc card in the car before entering the resort. Otherwise, fees will be deducted when you go out. The resort has many entertainment projects, such as go-karts, small ranches, hot springs, adventure kingdoms, horseback riding, etc. There is also a water park in the summer. Although each project has a separate fee, it is good to book a hotel now. The basic room rate includes several tour packages. If there are no special requirements, two days and one night are enough. The package also includes small hot pot and children's pasta, which just solves the lunch problem at noon that day. The Internet celebrity parent-child suite I stayed in this time has a treehouse slide, projector, chess and cards, tent, Lego blocks, etc. The room faces the river and has a good view. There are also various children-specific facilities such as a children's-specific washbasin. It can be said that even The kids can play in this room all afternoon without going anywhere. After checking in, you can scan the QR code on the map and enter the room number to navigate to your room. There is an exclusive parking space at the door of the room, making it very convenient to pick up your luggage. This time, special thanks to Zhang Li, the account manager of the resort, for contacting us in advance and arranging a room near the outdoor children's play area. After checking in, he personally took us to the restaurant to dine and gave the children drinks. After the meal, the room was not ready yet, Zhang The manager arranged for us to go to the small ranch. When we learned that we were here to celebrate her child's birthday, she specially prepared a birthday cake. She had a rest the next day but was still concerned about our stay experience. The hotel staff are all very polite, whether it is the cleaning lady, the restaurant waiter, the chef, or the shuttle bus driver. Looking forward to coming to Sun Island Resort Hotel next time!

It is suitable for self-driving, but it is also very convenient to transfer to the shuttle bus in the park. It is estimated that it will take about 5 minutes. You cannot directly get the card at the service desk registration, which is a bit magical. However, the other places to get the card are concentrated in the accommodation. The room is a bit old, with the shape of a superimposed villa. The second floor is not friendly. There is no elevator, and it is easy to step on the corner. As a parent-child hotel, there are no basic configurations such as slippers and bathrobes for children. There are only stools in the room. The room service and butler are very good, actively responding and handling in a timely manner. The cleaning staff in the park can greet each other in a friendly manner. It feels very good. There are many places for activities in the park, and the small ranch is also great. The staff inside are very enthusiastic. The horse skating business is generally at the gate. The only thing to complain about is that the children's playground in the lobby is charged for children over 6 months old, which is too exaggerated.

There are children's gifts when they check in, such as pinballs for children to play with. There are also two mosquito coil patches on clothes in the room every day, which is very thoughtful. In addition, the lemon juice delivered in the room is invincible and delicious. I don't know if it is sold in the city. Overall, the park has everything you need to eat, drink and play. If you want to eat a barbecue buffet, you must make a reservation two days in advance. The location is at the Mermaid Pier. Three days and two nights is still enough. I will come again next time if I have money and time.

The transportation on the island is convenient. There are exclusive parking spaces.

The customer service of Red Mermaid is very good.

After eating, I searched and found that Sam's Club sells shrimp chips for 29.8 per bag. In comparison, Star has a better sense of design. I personally feel that it is newer or more modern. The breakfast is so-so, not bad. The fried eggs and noodles are delicious. The children's playground and hot springs are very good, but the cute pet park feels so-so.

It can be said that each has its own characteristics, and the children like it very much. We adults also felt very happy to stay here, and we had a great time eating, entertaining, and playing there. Next time I will go to experience different room types.

It is very considerate ‚ù§Ô∏è You can call a shuttle bus in the room to pick you up when you go out, and the minibus will drive to the door and wait. I actually forgot to bring ******** this time, so I asked the staff for emergency help and the problem was solved quickly. I have experienced many pet-friendly hotels, and Sun Island is the most worry-free. There is an area for pets in the room, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about them running out and destroying the house when you leave the room. Although there are many people during the festival, the staff are very enthusiastic, and the breakfast queue is very orderly. The children are already looking forward to playing in the water again in the summer.

The only drawback is the accommodation conditions. The room is really old-fashioned and the sound insulation is very poor. The sound of people talking next door can be heard clearly, but this is only temporary. The most unbearable thing is the paper curtains. The wind blows the paper and makes a rustling sound all night, which really affects sleep.

The ostrich was so cute. It only ate carrots. I also played the forest train. The train passed through a place with four projects to play. After playing, I took the train back. There was a camping site next to it. If the weather was good, I would make an appoin**ent with friends to have a barbecue. If you stay in the hotel, you will also get free sand digging tools. The weather was not very good the next day. It rained, so we played the hotel's small adventure camp. Throwing the children in it, you can relax for a few hours. It's a pity that I didn't experience horse riding. I will come again next time I have the chance.

msg:I don‚Äôt remember how many years it was last time, but I feel much better this time than last time. First of all, there is the traffic. Last time I went there, it felt like there were all muddy roads. This time, the road was smooth. Although it was not very spacious, there was no traffic jam after getting off the expressway. The two-bedroom villa we booked has a small yard on the first floor with a swing and a deck. The children can also have a place to run wild in the accommodation area. The room is also very large, and the two bedrooms have separate bathrooms, one with a shower and one with a bathtub, to meet different needs. Then let‚Äôs talk about Sun Island itself. There are many more recreational facilities than before. Unfortunately, the weather was not very good. I didn‚Äôt expect it to rain the next day, so I didn‚Äôt arrange outdoor activities for the next day. So in the end, the outdoor activities came first. One day I went to an event on the lawn opposite the lobby, and then spent the next two days playing in the indoor play area. I am planning to go there again in the summer to enjoy the outdoor projects. Thanks to the Red Mermaid customer service and Zhao Jing, they were all very considerate, from the traffic reminder before check-in to the introduction of various entertainment projects and services after check-in. ü•∞

There are various small animals, and the alpacas are the most lively and cheerful! Horse riding is also very good. Compared with the long queues in the forest park, there are fewer people here and the air is good. It is very suitable for a family to relax on weekends.

msg:The hotel covers a large area and has a variety of room types. There are shuttle buses throughout the resort, which makes it very convenient to go to any entertainment area.
This time, due to the temporary modification of the itinerary, the booking was late, and there were no various special suites to choose from, so I could only book a deluxe king-size room. The room is relatively small, but fortunately it is clean and tidy, and it is comfortable to stay for two days. The only thing I think is a flaw is that the hot water comes out a little slowly, and I need to put more cold water, which is a bit of a waste of water~ The location of the faucet in the washbasin is a bit unreasonable (maybe the washbasin is too small), and I always hit my head when washing my face~
The green plant coverage rate inside the resort is very high, and I also saw little squirrelsüòÄ~ The living area is very quiet and the air is very fresh. When I walk back to the room at night, I can see many stars and airplanes in the night sky~
It happened to be a holiday, and the hotel was full, so there were more people at the breakfast peak. Fortunately, the breakfast was rich and replenished in time, and the taste was not bad~
There are really many entertainment facilities, which are very suitable for parent-child travel, and children like it very much. Most projects are charged. Although some are a little expensive, it‚Äôs rare to come out to play once, and having fun is the most important thing!
The service provided by the Red Mermaid customer service and hotel staff was great, meticulous and enthusiastic.
Overall, this trip far exceeded my expectations and the experience was very good. I look forward to experiencing more other room types and checking in more entertainment facilities next time.

The night before, there was a caring customer service WeChat, sent some precautions and important information and other tips, and responded to any questions in time.

When I arrived on the island, I went to the lobby to check in, and then drove to the small villa where I lived. There is a dedicated parking space in front of each villa, which is very convenient for traveling and moving luggage.

The room is very large and there are many children's entertainment facilities (small tents & flying chess & slides). The baby especially likes to play on the slide, which is really endless. The baby also has his own crib, climbing up and down and never tired of it. Before leaving, he kept clamoring that he would book this room next time he came here.
The room has children's products. Surprisingly, there is a toilet seat and a special washbasin for the baby, which is very friendly to families with children.

There are many entertainment facilities on the island. Due to limited time, we played the parent-child exploration park, the small ranch and the forest hot spring.

Next time I have time, I will plan to visit Sun Island again.

They will help you arrange everything you want and can't think of. My housekeeper is Ms. Yang from the membership depar**ent. She can really respond to your requests and solve them quickly.
The entertainment facilities in Sun Island are really suitable for parent-child play. The children are still not satisfied with the play. I will definitely come again when the water park opens in summer.

She also helped to add quilts at night, which was so heartwarming! The starry sky room we stayed in was really great. The children had a lot of fun. The outdoor hot spring was amazing.

It had fresh air and floor heating. I experienced the hot spring spa this time. Although there were not many steam rooms, there were outdoor hot springs to make up for the regret. The second floor of Leyuan Amusement Park is very suitable for children, and the first floor rock climbing, shooting, and go-karts are suitable for older children. The most fun thing is bowling, which is really fun. I also went to the equestrian base to ride horses, the small ranch to feed small animals, and the lakeside BBQ. It is rich in content, with exclusive customer service, meticulous service, and attentive and thoughtful. The hotel has a buffet dinner with rich variety. The Chinese restaurant mainly serves local dishes, and the taste is also very good. I will go there again next time

If you like horse riding, you can experience wild riding, as well as off-road karts and small trains. When you are tired, you can take a bath in the hot springs. The hotel also has an indoor playground. If you collect all the stamps, you can get small gifts. We got dinosaur eggs! The hotel breakfast is also quite rich and delicious!

msg:Take the kids to play on the weekend. On Friday, after the children got out of school and had a light meal, we set off from the city. It was already dark when we arrived. Driving on country roads at night is already a part of travel and full of fun. After checking into the hotel, the children couldn't wait to play in the small green space for an hour. The next day, Saturday, we played in the small ranch in the morning and soaked in the hot springs in the afternoon. It happened to rain on the third day, so I played in the main building of the hotel. When the rain stopped, I also went to walk around the walkway behind. On the way back home in the afternoon, we visited the small ranch again and then rode horses. When we got out of the hotel, we saw strawberries being pickedüçì, and we went to play in the fields again.

The children were very happy late at night. Breakfast was also good. Children also like the children's set menu in Western food. What‚Äôs more puzzling is that there seem to be very few people eating during lunch and dinner. Where do they eat?

By the way, the butler service is great. This must be praised.

In the cute pet room, you can adopt a little guinea pig, which is equipped with food and large and small gloves. The breakfast buffet and Chinese restaurant are both good, and you can also eat in the room, which is very convenient. Aunts Zhang and Yang from the cute pet room and Aunt Wang from the star room are very nice. They will also take the initiative to ask for the missing items in the room and make up for them in time. The children all had a lot of fun. There is also a restaurant and a sand pool in the small pasture. The children can play there for a day and watch the piglets racing. The shepherd's purse and fresh meat wontons handmade by the local aunties in the restaurant are particularly delicious, and the service is also very enthusiastic. There are also sausage fried chicken pizza, etc. Adults can also order hot drinks. Overall, it was a very happy day. There were a lot of fun things inside and outside the room, and both adults and children were very happy. Will definitely come again

msg:A family of three came to Sun Island. The hotel environment is very good and the service staff are also very enthusiastic...
You can pay extra at the store to upgrade your room to a club room, which is much larger than the original room...
There are a lot of play items inside. My baby especially likes the exploration park inside. Let the children play in it and adults can free their hands. Haha, it is still very good.
The Chinese dim sum for breakfast tastes very good, and there are many options to choose from.
Their island is very big. If you don‚Äôt want to drive, you can take a walk or call their free island bus, which is very convenient.
The cherry blossoms are in bloom now, and the scenery is nice...

Let‚Äôs talk about a few minor shortcomings:
Because it was a working day, the opening hours of the amusement facilities were slightly shorter. The small ranch and the indoor children's playground were closed at 1630 in the afternoon. Only one hot spring was open in the evening. For our family who stayed for several days, the evening Entertainment is a bit lacking‚Ä¶
There are only set meals for weekday dinners, and there are fewer choices. The Chinese set meals are obviously better than the Western set meals. The Western style meals feel like frozen food that is reheated... although the price is 288...
The room service aunties have a loud voice, maybe because they are locals, but they are usually fine. Children are sometimes disturbed when they sleep in the afternoon, but the people are nice and the service is very enthusiastic...

Overall, the flaws outweigh the flaws and I would definitely go there again...

msg:I stayed there on the 7th and 8th of the first ***** month. I have time to write a review today.
Let me start with the advantages:
1. From the entrance to the front desk, and all the staff I met, the service attitude was very good. After checking in, there was an exclusive customer service WeChat contact. If there were any questions, the reply was also very fast. Wang Fang from the housekeeping department sent a gift bag for the baby and solved the problem very quickly!
2. I bought a small hot pot for two that night, and then it was upgraded to a buffet for free. I didn't expect much from the hotel's buffet, but I was surprised. The buffet was great, not perfunctory at all, and the restaurant staff was also very good!
3. The hotel's forest hot spring is also recommended. There are many outdoor hot springs, not crowded at all, and the environment is also OK. The only drawback is that the rest area is a bit small. The restaurant in the hot spring also has free fruit snacks and tea, which is very humane! If you want to eat something else, you can pay and order it separately!
4. The whole resort is very large and the environment is very good. Basically, there are all the entertainment projects you can think of. Each building of the accommodation hotel is separated in the middle. It takes about 3 kilometers from the gate to the front desk. There is a free shuttle bus inside the resort, which is very convenient. Just make a phone call and you will arrive in a few minutes.
5. The room has a special footstool for babies, special toothbrush sets, and a welcome gift pack for babies, which is very considerate!
Here are the disadvantages:
1. The room is a little small and the air conditioner is a little noisy. But considering the tight room situation during the Spring Festival, the hot spring package and buffet included in the package are really a good deal.
2. In addition to the included items, other recreational items have to be paid for separately. The small ranch is 248 for two adults and one child, which is really a rip-off! Not recommended, you can choose other items to play.
In summary, I will go to Sun Island again next time, and wait until the off-season to bring my baby to experience the room with a slide

msg:This is a family hotel. It is very large inside and is easy to drive there. You have to drive 2.5 kilometers from the hotel entrance to check in at the lobby. There are many recreational activities for children. We went there on a weekday and there were slightly fewer guests. The staff said that the rooms are almost full on weekends and holidays. The most impressive thing about this hotel is that the waiters have a very good attitude. They stayed at the door of the building to help with our luggage. They always smiled when they talked to us. They always responded to the guests' requests in a timely manner. I would especially like to praise the room service staff Wang Fang. On the first day of our stay, One night, midway through the shower, there was no hot water. I called the customer service center and she came immediately to help solve the problem. She also apologized for upgrading our room. The disadvantage of this resort hotel is that it has been open for more than ten years, the decoration style is a bit old, and the hardware facilities are also aging, but the software service is better than it is. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, but the taste is average, mostly Chinese style. If you think hotel dining is expensive, you can go to a farmhouse 100 meters outside the resort. The farmhouses there are delicious and cheap. We stayed for two nights and went out to eat at the farmhouse next to it every day.

This time, a two-bedroom suite was arranged for the elderly, and the children experienced the newly renovated parent-child pet room. The cute pet room should be the previous pet suite. The layout has basically not changed. It has changed from bringing your own pets to the hotel providing a pet-raising experience. There are three options: rutin chicken, lop-eared rabbit, and inverse guinea pig. It is also a good experience for children who have never had pets, but the rooms on both sides are too far apart, which is slightly inconvenient. The two-bedroom suites are relatively close to the standard rooms. After watching the New Year fireworks, we also received a lot of fairy sticks. There was also a lottery at dinner in the evening. Although they were all small prizes, the children were still very happy. We will arrange it next time during the summer vacation.

There is no comparison in terms of accommodation, and the facilities are average. However, the service attitude of the hotel's front desk, guest room, Chinese restaurant and other staff is really good, and they are all greeted with smiles.
There are many indoor and outdoor entertainment projects on the island, including small ranches, hot springs, exploration parks, equestrians, off-road vehicles, indoor video games, etc., but most of them are charged and a bit expensive compared to outside entertainment projects.

The children loved the Rainforest Parent-child Room as soon as it opened. There are slides, carpet flying chess, wall Lego, etc. The hanging high bunks with a rainforest a**osphere are all factors that excite children~
The room service was also very considerate. Not long after check-in, the housekeepers (Li Qin and Liu Cuiyan) came to ask if they needed anything. Knowing that there was a child, they even gave me a set of stationery. The hotel also provided drinks and small toys when checking in, which was very considerate!
The old duck vermicelli soup and pancakes at the buffet breakfast are good, the bread is a bit subpar (it doesn't feel like it was made on the same day, the cakes and breads are very dry), the western restaurant is good, the pizza, pasta, French fries and chicken wings are all delicious!

msg:I visited Sun Island more than ten years ago during a company team building trip. This time I took my whole family to visit the place again during the Spring Festival. The experience was completely different from before.
Environment: For this family trip, two adults and two children chose the Rainforest Family Suite. It was great and the children loved it. There are slides, flying chess, and building block toys in the room. Compared with the interstellar suite, the rainforest suite has floor heating, so children don‚Äôt have to worry about getting cold when they go barefoot in winter. The biggest advantage of Sun Island for us is its tranquility, because Sun Island is big enough that it won‚Äôt feel particularly noisy even during the Spring Festival. It is also surrounded by woods, and we can hear the chirping of birds from time to time, which is very harmonious.
Facilities: Compared with other tourist reviews, I think it is objectively quite good. It is not particularly new but certainly not old. For a hotel of the same price, it is acceptable. After all, the environment is different and some entertainment items are provided. Moreover, there is a DolceGusto capsule coffee machine in the room. For heavy coffee drinkers, it is a good choice when there is no way to buy freshly ground coffee nearby. Those who like coffee can bring their own capsules.
Hygiene: No highlights and nothing to complain about.
Entertainment: The only thing worth complaining about is the children's ticket price. Outside attractions are based on age, but on the island, height is based on height. 140 cm is the baseline. Even if you are 6 to 7 years old, if you are taller than that, it will be considered an adult ticket. Some children are just too tall. Is this wrong? It is necessary to adjust the attractions, otherwise they will not be able to attract mothers and fathers.
Because for us, children's entertainment is not the main point, so overall I still give Sun Island full marks.

The animals in the small ranch were in high spirits to welcome the guests. There was also a lot of fun and food in the hot spring. There are also fun activities in the evening. The most considerate thing is that the entire park is convenient to use. Just tell the staff and a special car will arrive immediately. A five-star rating is a must.

msg:This is a long-established resort in Shanghai. I have to admire the developers in the early 1990s for their great vision and ideas. Now it is quite mature and large-scale. A middle-aged teammate said that Sun Island is very different from when he came as a child. He would just treat it as his first time here. Many things have been gradually improved to keep up with the changes in the new era. Personally, I prefer the hotel's butler service. The Red Mermaid butler will contact the guests the day before check-in to remind them of the precautions. It is indeed a considerate service. Since this time I came to Sun Island on an impromptu basis and it was during the Spring Festival holiday, the good room types were basically booked and the facilities in the rooms were very average. However, the children really liked the various paid entertainment items in the hotel: especially the hot springs, horse riding, and small animals. interactive. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs fireworks show at 7:30 pm is really shocking and beautiful. I wish everyone happiness in the new year, just like these brilliant fireworks, a happy and colorful life! ! !

The service is also good, the room service responds quickly, and the battery car is basically on call.
It also comes with a hot spring, a small ranch, a water bike, and fairy wand fireworks, which are also available for fun.
What I must complain about is the buffet dinner, each adult has one Buddha Jumping Over the Wall. On the first day, I went to pick it up several times but they said it wasn't ready yet. I asked how long it would take to wait, but the answer was that I didn't know. The next day, I got it successfully, but one cup was spoiled and had a sour smell. I was happy to replace it, but the waiter didn't even apologize.

It takes an hour and a half by car and is very convenient. The customer service of Sun Island will contact you one day in advance and add WeChat. If you have any questions, you can contact me at any time. They also helped me waive the bathing fee for my children. The service is very good! The island is quite large, with small single-family villas and beautiful scenery. The weather has been great during the past two days. If I checked out before ten o'clock, I was given a family ticket to Little Ranch, which was an unexpected bonus. All in all, I was very satisfied with this trip and will come back often in the future.

msg:My daughter's kindergarten was on vacation, so I took her to stay at the Sun Island Resort Hotel, which had good online reviews before the Chinese New Year. After this experience, it is highly recommended. I booked a rainforest suite this time. My baby can play on the slide, swing and tent in the room for most of the day. The package also includes tickets for two large and two small hot springs. Basically, the one-day trip is completely completed. The next morning, I experienced feeding animals in a small pasture. The baby was so happy that he refused to go home. Overall, I can give it a five-star rating. Except for the fact that the food in the hotel is not very delicious, you can only have a set meal or a la carte at the waterfall restaurant for lunch and dinner on the first day. The variety is small and the taste is average. However, the buffet breakfast on the second day is still OK. This time I would also like to thank the housekeeper, Ms. Yang, who arranged the whole process very thoughtfully. Finally, she gave the children gifts and toys. I will definitely visit his hotel again next time.

The floor heating in the whole house is also very comfortable, but when I go to bed at night, I feel it is too hot, and I can‚Äôt even cover it with the quilt. I am afraid of catching cold without covering it, so I turn off the floor heating and turn on the air conditioner, but there is no way to cool down immediately. The basic facilities of the bathroom are complete. If there is not enough, you can call us. The delivery speed is very fast and generous. We were given 8 more bottles of mineral water at once. The hotel's breakfast was not sloppy because there were not many guests. It had a full range of varieties and tasted good. The pancakes, rice balls, noodles and wontons made on site were all good and delicious. The soy milk was also made in the morning and was rich and delicious. It's not brewed from powder. It is quite cost-effective to play four kinds of sports for 200 yuan. The bowling, archery and bumper cars are also available for 98 yuan per person at 7:30 pm, which is very cost-effective. The Chinese restaurant is under renovation, and there is only one Western restaurant open at night. There are several good farmhouses at the door. There are more animal species in the small ranch than I thought. The capybaras are very cute and you can buy carrots to feed them, but the price is a bit high. A horseback ride can also be a great way for kids to experience the experience.

I booked a one-bedroom interstellar room in this resort on Ctrip. The room is shaped like a spaceship. I stayed in No. 3001. When entering through the entrance door, there is a play area in the living room where the little ones can have a lot of fun without going out, eating, bathing or sleeping. Across the living room is a bedroom with bunk beds, with adults sleeping underneath and children sleeping above. The mattress is good and medium-hard, and there is a small balcony outside the bedroom. The bathroom is divided into a bathtub and a shower. The shower head has a good water output and a large water temperature, which is suitable for washing. It is comfortable, the toilet is also smart, and disposable toiletries are provided in the resort. The whole house is also equipped with floor heating.

3. There are quite a lot of recreational activities. We did horse walking, archery and rowing. Half a day was a bit tight, especially horse riding.

msg:I took my family on vacation during Chris**as. The environment was very good. The hotel lobby is in the center of the island, next to the European-style villas. I saw many foreign families staying there. There are indoor and outdoor hot springs and indoor constant-temperature swimming pools, and there are many entertainment projects. It is very cost-effective to buy a package ticket. The staff enthusiastically reminded that the package ticket cannot be used on multiple days. The food on the island is a little expensive, and there is an additional service fee. We tried Chinese and Western food, and the taste was good. The hotel has a 24-hour shuttle bus to pick up and drop off guests. Just call and wait downstairs in the room. Each building has a corresponding parking space. Turn right from the hotel entrance for 5 minutes and there are farm dishes to choose from. Don‚Äôt order too many dishes as the portions are large. It is inconvenient to call a taxi on the island. Guests who do not drive can take Zhujiajiao No. 3 directly to Zhujiajiao Subway or Zhujiajiao Scenic Area. There are more activities in summer, so those who want to play should book as early as possible to avoid being full.

Let‚Äôs talk about the catering depar**ent. Because we have been soaking in hot springs in the afternoon, we could not make it in time for afternoon tea. The waiter was very considerate and helped us reserve the afternoon tea for us to pick up at any time. As a result, we went too late and the coffee was cold. I thoughtfully made two cups again, and the service was impeccable.

I can prepare in advance and not be in a hurry. From check-in to hotel meals and room service for three days and two nights, I felt like I was being taken care of, which was heart-warming.
Our room type has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, which is suitable for three generations. There is also a small yard outside with a swing. Baby likes it very much. The most surprising thing is that the next day was my father's birthday. The hotel manager Yang secretly arranged for staff to help decorate and prepare a cake, making it an unforgettable birthday.
The latte art at the hotel's Waterfall Western Restaurant is both beautiful and delicious. I tried it twice. It tastes good and the service is attentive. I also experienced Changmao Buffet Restaurant and Sunshine Chinese Restaurant on the third day. It tasted good, the price/performance ratio was very high, and the portions were so large that I couldn‚Äôt eat anymore on the third day.
The entertainment facilities were relatively short this time. We went to the Mermaid Pier, a small ranch, a forest train, a boat ride, and a small world. Next time I have the chance, I want to play something else.

The decoration style of the club suite is rather old-fashioned. It is reserved for parents.
Parent-child cute animal suite. You can rent a small animal and take it back to the room when you check in.
Both rooms come with free drinks, snacks, toys for children, etc. They even have anti-mosquito tools, which is very considerate. However, the hotel is very clean and there is no odor or mosquitoes. You can rest assured.
Two days and one night are a bit of a rush and I didn‚Äôt have time to play many projects.
The restaurant and indoor children's playground are at the front desk of the hotel. The horse farm and small pasture are at the door of the hotel.
The small ranch is not cost-effective. There are not many animals. There is a barbecue area at the door.
Going to the beach in this weather is afraid of making the child sick, so I just let him dig in the sand and kick in the water, which is enough for a four-year-old to play for most of the day.
In the end, I didn‚Äôt have time to soak in the hot spring. It‚Äôs a pity. I‚Äôll go there again if I have the chance.
Special thanks to Sun Island Customer Service - Red Mermaid. She added WeChat before traveling. She was a big help this time~ The service is first-class

msg:Facilities: Especially suitable for parent-child outings. Every place has facilities and supplies that are convenient for children. The three restaurants have baby chairs, children's meals and bibs, which are very friendly to families with babies.

Environment: The environment is very cute and joyful. They are all single-family villas. There are parking spaces at the door, one for each household, which is very convenient. The rainforest room type booked this time has the most popular slide, and there are also building blocks, flying chess, and tents for children. Had a great time.

Service: As an old family resort hotel, the service concept is very mature. Shuttle buses can be picked up and dropped off at any time on the island, and there is 24-hour butler service. What makes our family feel most at home is that the staff in every link and position treat guests like family. When booking the trip, the young man at the front desk, Dong Qinghui, took the trouble to answer all my questions and arranged two rooms for me together. On the day of the trip, Ms. Yang, the customer service representative of Red Mermaid, added me on WeChat, sent me the precautions in advance, and kept in touch from morning to night. What was touching was that the children missed the time to catch ducks, and Red Mermaid specially communicated with the staff. , added a duck drive to let the children get what they wanted. Miss Chen Ping in the breakfast room took special care of the children for two days in a row, pouring water and milk for the children and bringing them snacks. We dined at Sunshine Restaurant three times. Every time we went, Miss Wang Haizhen, Wei Yuqin and Li Sumei took care of the children very enthusiastically. The children especially liked them. There are also Miss Ruan who teaches children how to make biscuits from Little Ranch and Miss Huang Weiying from the housekeeping depar**ent. They are both kind and patient, which impressed the whole family. Thanks to all the staff of Sun Island Hotel, it is you who have made Sun Island firmly ranked among the best family hotels in Shanghai! This holiday makes our holiday happier and more meaningful because of it!

Before I even entered the island, the Mermaid customer service staff informed us about the relevant matters and attractions on WeChat, so that we had a clear understanding of it even before we arrived. Their place is really too big, but although the place is large, the management is very good, and the staff at each service point are also very enthusiastic. Let me talk about their entertainment projects. The hot springs are very good, and there are many hot springs outside. If you feel crowded, you can go to the steam room when you are tired. Children can go to the playground to play, or go to the rest area to have some free snacks and tea. You can play for a long time. There are many animals in the small ranch, and there are animal competitions, which is very good. Breakfast and dinner are also good. The food is all buffet, rich and delicious. This is a place where I want to come again after visiting once [pleasant]

The room service aunties Liu Cuiyan and Li Qin were also on call and very enthusiastic. Generally speaking, if a large family goes out to play together, Sun Island is still a good choice, but the activities there are really too expensive. A duck boat costs 100 for half an hour. The room rate is so expensive. How can you pay for the facilities? So expensive, a bit of a trap

msg:I went to Sun Island during this vacation. The last time was many years ago. I chose two villa room types. The children love Peter Pan so much. They keep sliding down the slides and crawling on the net. They want to sleep in the net. Auntie Hang Kailiang and Auntie He Dong who cleaned the room were very proactive and enthusiastic. The room was clean and tidy, and they even prepared extra children's bathtubs for us. The holiday gift packages in the room are all complete. There are new ones every day, including fruit snacks and red wine.

The second room type is the forest villa. The room was super new and beautiful. I decided to stay one more day after seeing it. There is an electric car in each room for self-driving on the island, which is very convenient. A small hot spring pool is very comfortable, and you can stay in it longer than the swimming pool.

Entertainment items on the island: archery, bumper cars, equestrian off-road karts, water bikes. Must-experiences include small ranches, beaches, and kayaking.
Mermaid customer service is very dedicated and will reply every time you have a question as soon as you send a message. Solve the problem.

Hotel room: We booked two deluxe island double rooms in 1472. It felt quite clean and hygienic, and the service was good. We were always responsive to requests. We called wherever we wanted and the hotel car picked us up in five minutes. It was very convenient (but my husband I like to drive myself, so I didn‚Äôt ask for a hotel car)
There are so many things to do, one-stop baby walkingü§≠
Go-karts, small trains, horse riding, small ranches... beach swimming pools, water parks, free tickets when booking a room, choose one of the water park and small ranches
I personally recommend the beach swimming pool. Children love it so much. The sand is very soft and there are many play areas. It is a great experience for taking pictures! There are also many white lounge chairs, as well as pink ones, which are very beautiful!
Rainbow Surf Slide, artificial waves every half hour, very exciting! Inflatable water park, adults and children have a lot of fun

WeChat customer service will add WeChat to remind you of some precautions in advance, and you can consult at any time if you have any questions about check-in. I have experienced both the beach swimming pool and the small pasture. Children especially like the wave making in the swimming pool. Although the weather is a bit cold, it still does not hinder their interest in digging in the sand and playing in the water. It took a long time to dig sand in the pasture. There were also small animal competitions and close interactions with the small animals.

The room layout is very reasonable. The place is large, with capsule coffee, slides in the room, and swings on the balcony. Meets the requirements of adults and children. There is sunscreen and mosquito repellent on the table. There is mosquito repellent incense at the entrance. All of this reflects the thoughtfulness of the resort. Humanistic care is also done well. Almost every staff member is very welcoming. There is a shuttle bus in the park, and it's just a phone call away. The response speed is very fast. Restaurant and room staff are very nice. When checking out, I specifically asked if I would like to bring some water to drink on the road. It was very warm. Special thanks to WeChat Sun Island customer service Red Mermaid-Ms. Yang. What a beautiful person with a kind heart. Perfectly solved the breakfast problem. Because the room is so soundproofed? Because of the sweet osmanthus fragrance outside the house? Because the bed is too comfortable? So I woke up until 10:00 in the morning... Special thanks to the ladies in the restaurant for causing them trouble. What a wonderful holiday, looking forward to coming back next timeüòÅüòÅüòÅ

This time I booked a pet room and a regular room. The customer service staff of Red Mermaid and Wangtopang respectively added WeChat and gave various reminders and itinerary guidance before traveling.

Although the pet room is expensive, it is worth it. There is an exclusive parking space at the door. It is easy for dogs to enter and exit. The space is large. There is a round hole connected to the master room. It's just a bit noisy when it runs in and out in the middle of the night. There are also many pet-friendly places, both for dining and entertainment. There are also several farmhouses on the road in front of Sun Island, which are cheap and delicious. You can also park and bring your dog. The first time the dog swam, the first time on the swing, there were many firsts, it was such a wonderful memory. Other recreational facilities are also good, including a large beach and swimming pool, as well as water bikes. It's very comfortable to walk along the tree-lined avenue. Even during the National Day, the prices on several leaflets are a bit inconsistent, and there is nothing you can do about it, so you have to ask clearly about the time and price. The place where pets check in is the first attraction after entering the island, so you should check in first. Wang Tuobang didn't say anything at first, thinking that the accommodation was here in Wang Tuobang, but it turned out that it was in a large area with the ordinary rooms, and it was a waste of time running around. The customer service of Red Mermaid is good, basically all kinds of reminders after check-in, entertainment, games, breakfast time, etc. After checking out, I asked if I had arrived home [palming my face] Overall, it is highly recommended. You can play with or without pets.

msg:I booked an island courtyard room for my child's birthdayüéÇ. The room was large and spacious, and the courtyard was very comfortable. The island has complete facilities and is especially suitable for bringing children with you. After soaking in the hot spring, it was very comfortable. There is a lounge with snacks and drinks, which is especially suitable for people with low blood sugar like me. The breakfast has a variety of varieties and tastes very good. After the meal, we even took a ride on the mermaid train. All in all, it‚Äôs highly recommended and I‚Äôll definitely go there again if I have the chance!

msg:Taking advantage of the end of the summer vacation, I took my baby and dog to the pet room in Sun Island. There are not many hotels in Shanghai that allow you to stay with pets, and the pet room in Sun Island is very, very friendly. Not only is there a separate room for pets, but also for dogs. There are a lot of snacks in addition to the room facilities and the pet swimming pool and the pet park. The supporting facilities are very complete. The hotel service is very good. The staff I met are very enthusiastic, especially Zhang Qingxia and Yang Dingmi from the room depar**ent. There are more ranch off-road vehicles. The most famous ones must be the beach and the wave pool. To be honest, they are cleaner than I expected, but after all, they are a bit old after a long time. The food in the hotel is relatively monotonous. Chinese and Western food, but the end time is relatively early. When I went there, I said that the buffet was the last day. It seems that the buffet is not always available. There are quite a lot of breakfast categories, but there are too many people. Most of the meals are in one area, and many people have to queue up. In conclusion, the pets are very friendly and the facilities are full of things for children and pets to play with. There are quite a lot of rooms. The overall price is not cheap, but it is considered a one-stop shop. It is suitable for a short stay on weekends. It would be better if there are more food choices. In addition, the barbecue provided by the customer service is really good üòå

It is a tomato pot bottom, and the taste is quite good; the next day we changed to Western food, grilled chicken wings, and grilled ribs taste very good, my daughter likes bolognese noodles, and ordered it for 2 days in a row;
At noon the next day, we went to the Sunshine Restaurant on the 2nd floor. Although the price was a bit expensive, the taste of the food was okay. The fried rice with soy sauce tasted very bland at first, and after talking to the waiter, they made it again. The watermelon delivered after the meal was super sweet, we ordered another one later üòÖ
There are really too many options for breakfast! ! Laoya vermicelli soup, I added some chili oil, a little spicy, I think it is quite delicious; then there is a cold dish called Anji Wild Vegetables, very refreshing taste with a little spicy taste; and Chicken curry, although it is a bit oily in the morning, it does not hinder the taste üòÅ
Generally speaking, the food is good, and the fun is average. Maybe the weather is too hot, many activities are not suitable, and the indoor activities are very ordinary, but I am interested in the beach. I will wait until the weather is cooler next time. Come again!

Her family's children's set menu is also good. After the children eat the B set meal at noon, they will never forget to eat another one at night.
Entertainment: There are many overall entertainment items. For children, you can make handmade soft pottery. If you like water, you can play surfing on the beach. You can interact with small animals in the small ranch. The larger ones can be water bikes and exciting off-road karts, and there are many people who can barbecue together.
I feel that I need to form a group with more people in the future, or use it again and again during the winter hot springs.

If there is any need to contact her, the service is really good, thank you very much. The four of us, the elderly and a child, also gave eight coupons for the small ranch and the beach swimming pool. It was really warm. The granddaughter refused to leave after playing, and said that she would book a room with a slide outside next time.

There are two main attractions in the hotel, one is a small ranch and the other is a beach swimming pool.
The small ranch is mainly to see small animals, there are many kinds, as well as snakes, kangaroos, and raccoons. But the tickets are very stuck, and if an adult takes the children in the afternoon, they will not be allowed in. Can the adults take a break?
The beach swimming pool is very good, you can play for a day, come out at noon and go back to the room to sleep, and continue in the afternoon, and you can change adults to take the children there, which is more humane.
There are basically no shops around, so you can either eat in the hotel, or bring your own, or order takeaway

msg:The last time I came here was 14 years ago. This time I came here because my child likes the slide room, and I had some predictions before I came. After all, the year is there, but the parent-child suite belongs to the relatively new part of the hotel, but once you enter the room, the room is smelly. Especially the bathroom has a bad smell, because the bathroom is still facing the big bed, and the hotel phone does not know how many times to dial, unlike other hotel phones that indicate the front desk switchboard, etc., I asked Ctrip customer service to contact the hotel staff. After I came, I expressed Willingness, we changed rooms if the smell couldn't be eliminated. Then the staff made a phone call in the room and repeated what I said to the other party. I don‚Äôt know who I contacted, and said in a very unfriendly tone: "There is no room for him!" I think I can also understand the popularity of parent-child suites. If it can be handled properly, we are not willing to toss about changing rooms. As a major in aviation tourism, I feel unprofessional to hear such a tone. Then the staff told me to do a deep cleaning for me. I replied that we will go out to play first, and if the bathroom is available, we can put an aromatherapy diffuser to diffuse the smell, and we will see the situation when we come back. Fortunately, the smell is less. The living room of the suite feels that a sofa can be added. Since there is a projector, you can sit on the sofa and watch movies and TV shows at night. The toys provided in the room can be asked about the gender of the child before check-in, and they will be given according to the gender. Otherwise, it would be a waste if they are not useful, and we basically did not take them away. It is understandable that the entertainment on the island is charged. The one-hour battery tour bus for two people is basically enough to go around. 88 for a pasture, 16 yuan for a carrot. Personally, I feel that the tickets are not worth it. You can go to the Shanghai Zoo at this price, and there are fewer animals here. Generally, the hotel and ranch merchants I went to in the past only charged for carrots. At that time, the beach pool asked the staff to tell them that it would end at 20:30, because the rainy season was sultry during the day, and we were informed that it was over after 17:00, and a notice outside the door also said that it would end at 18:30 on weekdays, which was disappointing. Good merchants agree to come back the next day. The entire beach has a nice view and is very exotic. Then I went to the Chinese restaurant for dinner. Although the variety is relatively small, the overall taste is not bad. Friendly staff. The facilities in the entertainment center are relatively outdated, the billiard balls are moldy, and billiards lovers can't play... But there are quite a lot of children's programs, such as racing cars, bumper cars, archery, shooting guns, horseback riding... The next day's breakfast is okay, and Qingpu local pastries are very good. It's just that the taste of yogurt is relatively bad, and I asked for an ice cube, but it has been delayed... The scenery around the entire resort is still good, with small bridges, flowing water, and willow trees. It feels the same as ten years ago. Thanks to Ms. Zhang Xiaoli for her warm and thoughtful service throughout the check-in experience, which made me feel like a five-star hotel chain. In fact, Sun Island, as a rare comprehensive resort hotel in Shanghai, can do better in all aspects, renovate the old facilities, improve the service quality, and there will be more customers.

When booking, it was noted that it was the birthday of the baby, and the hotel put a lot of balloons in the room, as well as a happy birthday sign, and a birthday cake! Full of ceremony! The staff has a strong sense of service and love, taking care of the baby. At noon, when we learned about the baby's birthday, the waitress gave us a bowl of noodles and a bottle of juice. During dinner, the baby suddenly wanted to eat bananas, so the waiter "changed" a banana for him. Before leaving, he even gave him a handmade balloon flower. The baby liked it so much that he took it home!
There are many projects for children to "discharge" in the park. We went to the small ranch, saw alpacas and peacocks, and the baby even touched the lamb. At night, I would chant "baa the lamb"...

msg:Baby's birthday is the most worthwhile day to celebrate. It's hot weather and it's best to have beaches, swimming pools, and parent-child activities. In the end, we chose to come to Sun Island for vacation. This is our first time here. What surprised us was that it was a one-story townhouse. The hotel learned that it was our birthday, and the exclusive butler specially prepared birthday gifts and birthday cakes for us. It was an unforgettable 5th birthday for the baby üéâ
The three days passed quickly, and our festival arrangements are very rich. Next time we come, we must stay for a few more days and have a good time.
The hotel room was cleaned very clean, the food in the restaurant was surprisingly delicious, and the service staff were very enthusiastic and helpful. It can be seen that the hotel attaches great importance to service quality!
Looking forward to coming back next time!

msg:I came to Sun Island on a rare free day, because there were not many people on Sunday and Monday, and there were many activities on the island, which was very suitable for parent-child activities and group building activities. The guest room is very clean and hygienic, without any peculiar smell. There is a refrigerator and a safe, as well as a gift bag of water and snacks. Basically, it has all internal organs and everything. You can order food for takeaway or order to your room, or you can go to a restaurant to eat. If you have a car, you can also drive to a farmhouse near the door.
I came here for a wild ride with my boyfriend. I was lucky that it didn‚Äôt rain, and the experience was great‚Äîthe 12-kilometer ride was fun, and I established a link with the horse during the ride. Walking, trotting and running in a picturesque natural environment, running into the rhythm and pace of the horse, and finally being able to breathe with the horse feels really good. Breathing fresh air, relaxing and relaxing, this feeling is really good and I like it, I want to come again next time.
Now that the hot springs and beaches are not yet open, the entertainment activities are a little less, but it‚Äôs not a problem, just walking around in this forest surrounded by green trees is very comfortable. There are also many small animals on the island, such as alpacas, ostriches, peacocks, etc. in the small ranch, and kittens passing by from time to time. Animal lovers really like this kind of place close to nature hahaha. There are also many activities indoors. In short, if you want to be idle or want to play, you can satisfy it here.
Then we must mention the service. It is really caring and enthusiastic. The staff passing by will greet you and ask if they have gone out to play or have a meal. When they first entered the island, they joined the Red Mermaid and helped me. Answered some questions and provided convenience for this trip. Let me mention our housekeeper, Auntie Huang Weiying, who knocked on the door to ask about our experience and needs. She also enthusiastically brought us some water and patiently answered any questions. It was really warm! I left a little graffiti in the room, I hope the staff who tidy up the room will be in a good mood when they see it, thank you for meeting~
The shuttle bus is also very considerate. If you need it on the island, just make a phone call and it will be picked up soon. It is very convenient. Including the last time we left the island, we asked the lobby to help us take a taxi. I am really grateful hahaha. The service is really great, thumbs up~
That's it for now, I'll fill it up when I think of something free, I'll come again next time‚ô™

1. The island courtyard suite we booked has a unique small yard and swings, and the children have a great time playing. The room is clean and there is a bar where the whole family can sit around and chat and eat supper.
2. Our room was given an admission ticket to the small ranch, which is also a paradise for children. You can buy food and feed lambs, alpacas, pigeons, and ostriches. But the food is really too expensive, 16 yuan for a pack of pitifully small grasses, with only a handful of roots. There are quite a few radishes.
3. The Little World and Ingenuity Hall are for children to pass the time, and adults can sit and have a coffee break.
4. The best thing about the resort is the transportation. It is very free to drive by yourself. There is a parking lot in front of each project, with sufficient parking spaces, and each project location can be navigated in the mini program. Tourists who do not drive can choose the free battery car pick-up in the resort.
5. After booking the room, a housekeeper will contact the tourists before the trip, and can arrange some items that need to be reserved. Our butler is a mermaid, very enthusiastic, answering questions, very patient and caring, and helped us make an appoin**ent for a lakeside barbecue and tea making around the stove.
6. The staff at the barbecue by the lake and making tea around the stove are very enthusiastic, which makes people feel like a holiday. They will make full preparations before the appoin**ent time, distribute the dishes on the stove, and start roasting directly when you sit down. During the barbecue, several staff will patrol the venue, if you have any questions, please ask them for help. There are many beautiful plants and small animals in the hut for making tea around the stove. It is so comfortable to watch the scenery and drink tea!

In fact, generally speaking, it is a resort suitable for taking the elderly and children to spend leisure time on weekends. It is worth everything for children to have fun!

msg:On April 13th, I took my parents and children to stay in the parent-child suite of the Sun Island Resort Club. In fact, a few days ago, I read Xiaohongshu's comment on the room facilities of Sun Island. The room facilities are old and the experience is very bad. The check-in in the main building was very smooth, and the attitude of the receptionist was also good. I checked in to the suite early at 2 o'clock
Unexpectedly, the service aunts Li Qin and Liu Cuiyan in the room depar**ent greeted us very enthusiastically, introduced the room and asked about the cleanliness of our room. If you are not satisfied, you can respond to them, and you can also ask questions. When we opened the suite room, we didn't expect the room to be so big and super clean. It can be seen that Li Qin and Liu Cuiyan, the cleaning staff, are very serious about cleaning services! Fruit snacks and drinks are welcome, and the parent-child gift packs for children are abundant. Children like fried chicken, so excited! The suite exceeded our expectations in every way!
There is also the exclusive customer service Sun Island Red Mermaid. When you arrive in the room, you will receive a WeChat reminder. WeChat reminds you of the precautions for the Sun Island vacation. Our family is very comfortable!
Of course, there are also disadvantages, such as the network, which is still a bit stuck, and the mobile phone is a bit inconvenient to handle things, and it is a little better at night!
In the afternoon, I went to the small ranch provided by the accommodation package. Because it was going to rain, I felt that the service staff at the gate was very cold, and there were small flying insects everywhere. The smell of the small zoo was really bad, and the environment was not satisfactory. However, the play facilities for children are still good. It started to rain lightly, so we went in for 10 minutes and left in a hurry
Dinner is eaten at the Baimu Farmhouse opposite the resort. The taste is really not good, and the price is not cheap. There is no advantage except for the large quantity. Xiaohongshu or Dianping are definitely reviews that charge money!
On the morning of April 14th, the buffet breakfast was very rich, and the children were very satisfied with what they ate, and the service aunts in the restaurant were very kind and enthusiastic.
I went back to the room to pack my luggage. I was going to take the baby to Xiaotiandi at 9:15. The children had a great time playing and didn‚Äôt want to go back to the room. At the door, I met Aunt Ruan Xianghong from the housekeeping depar**ent. She reminded us very warmly and politely whether we had called a car. We are very satisfied with the room cleaning and sanitation of the housekeeping depar**ent. It is a great job! The service is also great!
Check-out service was done at 11:30 noon, and we ate at Sunshine Chinese Restaurant. The waiter service in Sunshine Chinese Restaurant was a bit lax. The three of us, one big and one small, went to the toilet by staggering, and went downstairs without paying the bill. I asked my parents and found out that there was no checkout. I hurried upstairs to check out, and almost missed the car. The waiter didn‚Äôt respond [cover face], and didn‚Äôt know that we could actually eat the overlord‚Äôs meal [laughing], this The sense of experience makes us not very happy! I hope the restaurant can carry out training in all aspects of service, and don't expect tourists to pay consciously.

msg:For children‚Äôs birthdays, the designated room must have a slide. I have been to the three-story villa in Sun Island and was impressed by the slide inside, but now the price has skyrocketed and I can‚Äôt afford it anymoreüòâ.
I chose the club parent-child suite, and there is also a slide. The birthday also made a birthday arrangement and sent a cake.
Compared with the last time, I feel that the service has been greatly improved. Every waiter is very enthusiastic and proactive. Even if my shoelaces are untied and walking on the road, some waiters remind me that they feel that there is something alive in their eyes! When we first checked in, the room attendants Li Qin and Liu Cuiyan came to ask us how our stay was, if there was anything we needed to improve, and if we had any other needs. The next morning, he took the initiative to come to ask us if we needed anything.
I originally took the little boy to the hot springs, but I was afraid that it would be inconvenient to change clothes. When I got there, I immediately arranged for a male waiter to take him in and change clothes.
The facilities are much richer than last time. Hot springs and small animal clubs are good places for children to spend time.
Everything in the package is great. The weather is also very strong, it is really nice to come here for a picnic if you have time.
If you want me to make suggestions, I think the greening here can be improved, there are really not many flowers in it!
At the gate of Sun Island, a large field of rapeseed flowers was found.

msg:Sharing of accommodation experience: What attracts us to stay is the pet room and hot spring pavilion. Let‚Äôs talk about the pet room first. The townhouses are very beautiful, and the parking space is very convenient in front of the door. Unfortunately, the wooden house arranged for us is at the corner, and there is no parking space in front of the door. Later, I found that the wooden house in this area was not occupied. It is completely possible to arrange a more suitable room number, and I hope it can be improved next time; the room is quite large, with a pet compar**ent and a whole wall for cats to climb, pet supplies are thoughtfully prepared, and drinks and fruits are provided as gifts. The air conditioner and floor heating are powerful and very warm. If I have to talk about the disadvantages, it is probably that it is difficult to use the phone under the TV cabinet, which is unreasonable, and the pillows are too soft. I am not used to it~
Come to Pinpin Hot Springs again, a friendly reminder is that you need to wear a swimsuit when mixing soup. There are several outdoor pools with different water temperatures. In the afternoon, the crowds are not too crowded like eating dumplings. If you go in the morning, you can monopolize one of the pools. The indoor pools are a little smaller than the outside, and it‚Äôs not bad. There are a lot of rooms, and it will take some time to go around. It is recommended to go to steam after soaking and eating. Is there any ice cream, snacks and drinks in the canteen? Children can have fun.
In particular, I would like to praise the food and beverages in the hotel. They are all delicious, especially the Sunshine Chinese Restaurant, which tastes much like ours and has a large serving size. When it comes to service, the room service and bus pick-up and drop-off service are also very good, the Red Mermaid butler is very good, Xiao Jinger from the reservation depar**ent answered many of my questions very well...
Generally speaking, this is a very good outing. Compared with the previous two times, I am much more satisfied. Xiaobai also likes it very much (he is tired of jumping up and down in the pet paradise), looking forward to the next outing~

The only downside is that Mrs. Bathwater is too small, see the last picture
The pressure of the bath water is not enough, the water heater is still burning
sometime cold and sometime hot
Putting the bathtub water next to it will affect the flow and temperature of the shower water
Since the water heater is set to the highest temperature, the hottest water is not very hot, so the water in the bath will get cold after a while, and it‚Äôs useless to add hot water, or unless we add some boiling water ourselves, so we didn‚Äôt soak much

I have been thinking about it for a long time, and this time I came here to experience my dream during the Spring Festival holiday. The enthusiasm of the waiters at the front desk made us feel warm when we first entered the hotel.
We stayed in the ***** New Year package of the deluxe room. Red wine and snacks were already waiting for us in the room. The room is quite big, with a small terrace where you can open the door to welcome the fresh air. Due to the large size of the resort, a free car-calling service is specially arranged. In just a few minutes, a car will take you to where you want to go. There is also a small green area in the accommodation area, where children can have fun during the day, and fireworks at night.
The hotel's buffet dinner has a variety of varieties and moderate tastes, and a children's snack area is carefully set up, which are all children's favorite snacks and drinks.
The price of forest hot springs is similar to that of urban areas. It includes tea breaks, 6 kinds of ice cream, dozens of biscuits and snacks, drinks and teas, and there are performances and lucky draws in the afternoon during the Spring Festival. There is also a children's playground, so that parents can completely let go of the restraints, and half a day passes in the blink of an eye, and the overall experience is very good.
The little baby said that next time I will try the most expensive parent-child room with slides, there is a long way to goüòÇ

This time I stayed in the Forest Villa and Sunshine Garden View Room. They are newly renovated and the facilities have been upgraded. Floor heating and smart toilets are all available. The experience of staying is very good.

Forest Villa is equipped with butler service. Butler Tan Zhengguang is very enthusiastic, serious and responsible. After checking in, he took the initiative to add WeChat. You can contact him through WeChat for anything. He is always on call and will respond to your needs.

Considering going again in the summer.

I thought the equipment would be very old, but the room was redecorated. All the equipment is very new and user-friendly! During the Spring Festival, there are a lot of activities, not only small pastures, forest hot springs, praying, writing blessings and setting off fireworks, but also equestrian and water bicycles. The scenery on the island is also good, and the waiters are very enthusiastic. Happy Spring Festival holiday, I didn't stay in the parent-child villa this time, I look forward to coming again next time!

msg:Taking advantage of a few days of holiday before the Spring Festival, I hurriedly booked Sun Island. After the opening, I really wanted to go out. With the baby and parents, basking in the sun, drove a car to the beautiful Sun Island. For three days and two nights, the baby ran on the big lawn, fed the small animals, soaked in the hot spring for the first time, and had a lot of fun. The parents who worked hard to bring up their children on weekdays also got a good rest, and the old people were full of praise for Sun Island.
Let's talk about the hotel again. The place is really big. The room facilities may be old, but they are very spacious and clean. Snacks and drinks are also provided, which is very considerate. There are shuttle buses on the island, and you can call for a shuttle bus to go anywhere, which is very convenient. There are not many restaurants on the island, the Chinese restaurant is not bad, and the fish head soup is highly recommended. The breakfast is really good, there are many choices, the mutton soup is super delicious, you must drink more bowls.
We played several projects this time and were quite satisfied. The small ranch is the children's favorite place. There are sheep, goats, alpacas, ostriches... There are quite a lot of animals. Feeding is really interesting, the baby is afraid and wants to feed, it's really laughable. There is also a small world, which is an indoor children's paradise. Once you go in and play, you don't want to come out. Baby can play by himself, very safe. Although the hot spring is not particularly big, it can't be better for children to play with water.
Our whole family is quite satisfied with this vacation. After returning home, my baby has been nagging about going to Sun Island. Hahaha, we must try the parent-child room next time. My baby has been looking at the door of the parent-child room for a long time now. The slide is so attractive.
By the way, I would also like to thank the Red Mermaid butler here for caring about our itinerary on WeChat every day, giving us suggestions, and answering various questions. Must like manually üëç
Well, Sun Island, see you next time.

msg:The club room type has its own indoor slide (as shown in the picture), and the bastards probably played it dozens of times, haha!
Although the cute pet paradise with free tickets is small, it is still the favorite of children to interact with small animals.
As soon as the short-footed horse in the horse-walking field came out (only on weekends), the children were overjoyed and cute. They sat on it alone, and the master led them (I dare not) walk around, and even posed for pictures. Children We are not so afraid of heights at this height, and the pony is very docile.
The butler added WeChat and almost responded to messages in seconds, answering every question, even during the busy New Year's Eve time period, it's still okay, it's already super good! In addition, before leaving, the housekeeper recommended that I take the elderly or friends to try the Forest Exploration Room (with its own climbing frame + slide) next time, and it is a single building that is less disturbed by neighbors.
The most practical thing about room facilities in winter is the whole house floor heating. The temperature of 28 degrees is really warm as soon as you enter the door. In addition to the basic configuration of the bathroom, there is an additional children's washbasin (the height is just right) which makes the children happy for a long time , Others such as children's toilet seats, children's toothbrushes, children's towels, and children's toiletries are all available.
To stay in this place, you must drive by yourself. The car is parked in the parking space with a fixed sign in front of the house where you live. The daily breakfast and the check-in place at the front desk and the accommodation area are about 2-5 minutes away by car. There is some distance, in winter It was a bit cold to walk there in the morning, and there were basically all kinds of breakfast, and the taste was not bad. I dragged two of them to eat breakfast, and the children ate very well. It was close to 13:30 in the afternoon that they said they were hungry and wanted to have lunch , You can see how much you have eaten for breakfast.
On the whole, winter must be regarded as the off-season, but the off-season has the taste and advantages of the off-season. Compared with the huge crowds of people who have to queue up for breakfast, I still prefer the less crowded off-season. In the warm winter sun, I bring the children close to nature~

üéÑHotel room‚Äîcheck in at 12.25, we arrived at around 3 pm, the entrance of Sun Island is a certain distance from the hotel lobby, drove in, check-in went smoothly, and the child went crazy after entering the room~~ slides üõù, tents ‚õ∫Ô∏è , flying chess ‚úàÔ∏è, rock climbing wall üßó can be played all afternoon. The hotel also sent welcome gift packs and fruit drinks for children, which is very considerate~ There is floor heating and air conditioning throughout the room, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting cold, it‚Äôs very warm! The room is big, and the car is parked outside our "villa", which is very convenient. We booked a parent-child room. There is a big bed below and a small bed upstairs. They are very comfortable and the design is ingenious. It is very popular with children. It is fun to climb up and down.
üçΩÔ∏èFood - The hotel has Waterfall Restaurant, Sunshine Restaurant (not open during the epidemic) and Changmao Restaurant which has buffet in the morning. In addition to breakfast, an additional 10% service charge will be charged for consumption at the Waterfall Restaurant. We ate at the waterfall restaurant on the first and second nights, both Chinese and Western food. There is a children's set meal for children, which is delicious~ I like their laksa, which tastes quite authentic, and there is also roasted spring chicken, which is large in quantity, delicious and tender. üòãThe service is also very good, the waiter is very enthusiastic. There are also a lot of buffet meals in the morning, and there are many types. Some of the meals are changed every day, and I am very satisfied. There are not many people. So the experience is relatively good [smile R].
[Rainbow R] Playing‚Äî1. Painted pottery was made in the Ingenuity Pavilion. There are other handcrafts to choose from in the ingenuity hall, and you can choose what you like.
2. Little ranch. Small animals include üêëüê∑ü¶ô ostriches and other outdoor ones. There is also an indoor zoo, which contains tropical fish üê†, hedgehogs ü¶î, Angora rabbits, Timon, lizards, snakes, raccoons ü¶ù, capybaras, Kodak ducks, etc. Small animals can be fed, and the canteen sells feed. It is worth mentioning that there are 4 geese (2 big white geese and 2 lion-headed geese) on the road passing by the small pasture, which are super fun. They will call loudly, and when you walk close to them, a lion-headed goose will come to chase you~ Territorial awareness Very strong! But children, be careful~ Among the alpacas on the farm, there is a buck-toothed alpaca, which is very fierce and will spit at you...
3. Experience horse riding üêé. Sun Island has a professional equestrian training venue.
4. Boating üö§ When we went, there was no one there. We were the only boat in the whole lake. It was quite pleasant to swim slowly and chase the big geese.
5. Shooting üèπ I didn't expect archery to be so tiring... I can't hit [Shame R] after experiencing it.
6. Parent-child bumper cars, we are private again, the bumper cars feel like a slow go-kart ~ hahaha [laughing R]
7. The hot spring‚ô®Ô∏è is divided into indoor and outdoor, and the outdoor hot spring feels very good! but! Remember to bring your own swimsuit! Take a good bath and have free ice creamüç¶fruit and snacks. There are also steaming~
üõéÔ∏èThere are not many people going there on weekdays, and most of them are reserved for play. Children like it, but it‚Äôs good to play things once. In the future, if you have a chance, you can invite friends and family to book a bigger villa to play~

The breakfast is rich in variety and many choices. It would be better if the juices are freshly squeezed. In addition, I went to the western restaurant and the Chinese restaurant. The western restaurant Zhu Hong served very well. I also cooked the dog's meal, which looked very delicate. The pizza and beef noodles tasted better, the better.
In general, this place is very suitable for bringing dogs to play. There are many dog entertainment, swings, brave roads, dog swimming pools, and large lawns. I also ran into pugs and saw a lot of pugs. They are so cute. I will choose this place next time.
If there is room for improvement, I hope the room facilities can be better, toilets and the like, and the food and beverage taste can also be improved.

msg:„Äêeat„Äë
The buffet breakfast time is 7:00-10:00, usually after 8:30 is the peak. If there is no seat on the second floor, the restaurant on the first floor will be opened to customers. Although the space on the first floor is not as big as that on the second floor, there are no meals. The second floor is neat and relatively scattered. But I prefer to dine on the first floor. The tables and chairs on the first floor are more Chinese, and there is an outdoor area, which feels more comfortable and comfortable.

The breakfast variety is quite complete. Because it is a parent-child club, there are many cakes and cute steamed buns suitable for children. I think Noodles and Little Chaos are pretty good. My husband actually ate egg pancakes for 2 days, which must be very delicious. Overall the food tastes good and delicious. The waiter in the restaurant will greet us friendly when they see us entering the door, and will take the initiative to clear the plate. The waiters are named Shi Yuqin and Zhu Fengxia. Their service is very nice, and the chef Zhao Yabin is also very polite.

Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants, I personally prefer Chinese restaurants. The western food we ordered at noon on the first day was delivered to the room. The taste was good, but the environment was unknown. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor recommends youtiao fish head soup. There are 7 of us, enough to eat, and the price is cheap and good. The eel and chicken are also very authentic, I recommend everyone to try it. At noon the next day, we took out the big wontons, pickled pork noodles, and fried rice from the Chinese restaurant. Because I was too busy packing, I forgot to give us toppings, and when it was delivered to our room, I saw that our glossy surface had been pasted, and made a few new ones for us. The service is good and makes the family feel good.
The buffet dinner room includes 2 adults and 2 children. The supplement is 228 per person. 2 children can be exchanged for 1 adult ticket. The front desk staff said that not everyone can do it, and I don't know if it is related to the National Day holiday. I used 4 tickets. The child ticket was exchanged for 2 adult tickets, compared to my 7-month-old child who can't eat anything. It should be noted that there are many spicy foods in the buffet dinner, such as shrimp, which are not marked and not suitable for children. There are also spicy and spicy Xiao Long Bao. I like to eat them, but they are not suitable for the elderly and children.

In addition, because I also brought my 93-year-old grandmother this time, she needed a wheelchair for the whole process. When you encounter steps during the meal, the restaurant waiter will come over to help lift the wheelchair, especially the restaurant on the first floor, and also give the grandma sitting outside. A blanket to keep warm. The 93-year-old grandmother laughed happily. My name is Zhu Hong. I forgot my name. She has short hair and is very friendly.

„ÄêRoom„Äë
We stayed in a big bed room on the first day, which is similar to the one we had a few years ago. The bathroom space in the big bed room is very large. I also brought a bathtub for my son to bathe. My toothbrush, why is it so easy to use, the bristles are very soft, hahahaha. Better than mine, hahahaha. The next day we changed to a parent-child suite, one bedroom, one living room and one bathroom. The layout is really suitable for children, there are tree holes and slides, and there are two floors below the bed with Tata rice, but it is not suitable for the elderly. My father is 70 years old and he fell in the room. Fortunately, it is fine because the mattress There is a step underneath, and it is easy to trip over. It is even more inconvenient for the elderly in their 90s, and it is very difficult to climb up. Young parents and children are of course heaven, but everyone still needs to pay attention to the steps. There are still safety hazards in the steps in the room.

The bathroom of the parent-child suite is very user-friendly, with a water bucket for children, as well as hand towels and mirrors for children. The shower room also has a shower head suitable for the height of the child. My son is too young to understand. Anyway, I liked it very much and decided to bring him often, hahaha.

„Äêoverall„Äë
After Sun Island has transformed from a business club to a parent-child club, I think the transformation is a success. The facilities are also relatively complete. In terms of price, I think the price of 4,800 yuan per night for a parent-child suite is still expensive. I hope it can be discounted. After all, other playgrounds have great limitations. The transportation on the whole island is very convenient. Shuttles and buses are always on call. Even when my 93-year-old grandma gets on and off the bus, the driver will get off to help. My grandma told me that she will come again in the future. . . . Very moved and happy.
In fact, the most satisfying thing for me and my family is the service. There are 7 people in total this time, including babies and elderly people. Grandma's wheelchair was rented on the island, but the wheels and pedals are not very easy to use. A staff member surnamed Wang at the front desk will give us to go immediately after learning about our situation. I bought a new wheelchair, with such a service concept, I believe that Sun Island will get better and better.
Our family has said that we will be staying for a week in the new year. .

The service staff, Wang Haizhen and Wei Yuqin, are warm and friendly, making people feel at home!
There are two single beds in each room of the two-bedroom suite, but they can be combined to form a queen-sized bed, which is enough to sleep two large and one small. The room is equipped with an air purifier, and there are also free fruit drinks and red wine. Equipped with relatively complete things. The garden is quite small, but it is quite comfortable to swing and drink coffee.
After a short rest in the afternoon, I went to experience the forest hot spring. There were not many people in the early days. Children can swim in the big pool with a swimming ring. After soaking in the hot spring, you can eat snacks, fruit refreshments, chat and kill time. There are also private rooms for the tea room on the second floor.
The breakfast the next day is a buffet, which is quite satisfactory, but there are all the things that should be there. I like the homemade yogurt and it tastes good. If the weather is good, the small ranch can also see small animals.
In addition, the red mermaid housekeeper is also very good to add WeChat in time to inform some precautions. Generally speaking, it is a good choice to come to Sun Island for vacation as a family trip.

Maybe it was 10 years ago, but now all the facilities are too old, and the various projects are small but expensive. Only the lawn is a bit bigger. I brought my children and tents for the sake of the sun, but I finally set up the tent and was driven away by the staff, saying that the lawn here is rented out and charged by others for group building. The sunset scenery by the lake is good, but the barbecue by the lake is very expensive. Even the aunts of the staff persuaded me that it is better to eat farm food at the door. The 699 set meal for 2-3 people only includes chicken and a plate of mixed vegetables, plus a bottle of drink. There is another tent club inside, renting the canopy + tables and chairs is 699, not overnight. The room was small and old, and my daughter didn't want to live in it. Fortunately, the breakfast was okay, so I left in a hurry the next day. However, there is a children's slide room, which looks good from the outside. If you are curious, you can go and have a look. I will not continue to step on the pit. .

Due to the late booking, there was only a standard room. Drive more than 50 kilometers to an island far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, where you can soak in hot springs, eat farmhouses, and slow down the pace of life. The first meal was at the Sunshine Restaurant on the second floor of the hotel. Although I felt a little expensive after reading the menu, I was moved by the enthusiastic waiters and decided to sit down and experience it. We were two big and one small. We ordered four dishes: shrimp dumplings, stewed egg, mushu meat, and beef fillet, and we were very satisfied. Finally, I would like to thank the waiters Wang Haizhen, Wei Yuqin and Huang Guangjuan of the restaurant for giving us drinks, and carefully prepared bibs, toys and cute baby tableware for the baby, which made our tired body feel comfortable. Next time we have the opportunity to go again Try other dishes. After taking a dip in the hotel's forest hot spring, the nose sweats, and the night sleep is very good. It's really a pleasant trip. There are also outdoor tents on the island to experience, and friends who like camping can try it out. In the video, the baby entered the room and walked around curiously.

msg:During the epidemic, I cannot go out of Shanghai and bring my family to Sun Island Resort Hotel. The choice is the club suite, which has one room and one living room. The hotel has thoughtfully arranged the rooms in an adjacent location, which is convenient for the whole family to travel. When you go out to play, you can call the resort's shuttle bus, which is convenient and fast. The room was clean and tidy and also equipped with a capsule coffee machine. The whole resort has a beautiful environment and fresh air. The children experienced horseback riding and feeding of small animals. The service staff of the resort are very enthusiastic. The one who left a deep impression on me was Aunt Ruan Xianghong. She was kind and friendly, and offered to drive the shuttle bus to take her family around the resort, and even gave the children a Frisbee.
If there is time in the future, I will come to Sun Island to have close contact with nature.

msg:N years ago, the company came to build a team. This time I saw the newly launched two-bedroom courtyard house, and I was immediately moved. Bring your baby and parents together, which is very suitable for family parent-child travel. The car can drive to the area where you live, and you can use the navigation wherever you go, which is very convenient.
The room is newly renovated, next to the villa area. The facilities are very new. Fruits and drinks are provided in the living room. There are also a lot of bottled water. The courtyard is not large, but the large round chairs and rocking chairs are very good, suitable for basking in the sun and drinking afternoon tea. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the floor of the room is estimated to be infrequently mopped, dust accumulates, and the wet towel is smeared on the floor. . .
There are many parent-child projects, just pick the ones you are interested in based on the map, and I won't describe them here.
I was too lazy to go out for dinner, so I chose the waterfall western restaurant, which was a little pleasant surprise. There are not many people, the service is very thoughtful, and we saw that some of our children sent balloons. The amount of dishes is very large, and the key price is fair, which is in the early 100s per capita. Impressed with lamb chops, bak kut teh, delicious!
Breakfast also has a lot of varieties. It is peak at 8:30, so you need to wait in line. Suitable for Chinese tastes, pancakes and Roujiamo are available.

msg:It should be regarded as the city's Internet celebrity check-in hotel, and it can also be called a rare "one island, one hotel". In fact, it is a Jiangxinzhou in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, which has been famous for a long time. After renovation and upgrading, the current highlight is the environment and entertainment facilities. The hotel is built with all villas, but the rooms are relatively small, which may be the biggest drawback. The amu*****t facilities are super complete and it is a paradise for children, so it should be the best place for a family vacation. You can play here for a few days without being bored, only you can't think of it. The area is super large, and it takes more than 1 km from the lobby to the villa to each play point, but the car can travel on the island, and the parking space in the villa area is also very sufficient. The hotel shuttle bus is also available on call and stops at any time, which is very convenient. The equestrian club occupies half of the island, and the scenery is so beautiful that you can come and experience it. There are beach wave swimming pools, small pastures, mermaid piers, water sports fields, pet parks, indoor entertainment centers, horse walks, children's green space parks, ingenuity halls, wild riding pastures, lakeside barbecues, forest hot springs (open in winter), etc. . . Every place can be played for most of the day, which is really rich. Don't be afraid to get lost, adding a public account can solve any problem. Although there are so many entertainment facilities, the management is very good and they are all so well organized. The hotel service is also very good, the air conditioning in the room is sufficient, and the check-in sent a lot of things, which is very considerate. Although it is not a five-star, it is in place to respond to requests, and the WeChat housekeeper provides real-time service, which is warm and caring. There is basically no queue for breakfast, and the dining environment is also very good. Lunch and dinner are also ok. If you don't want to dine in the hotel, there are two farmhouse dishes at the gate that are also very good. The online review is four and a half stars. Overall a great, family-friendly experience.

The only downside is the food. There are not many dishes in Sunshine Chinese Restaurant. I ordered pickled cabbage fish, tea tree mushroom, white chopped chicken and a bowl of noodles for more than 400 yuan and a 10% service charge. Expensive is not a problem, it is worth it, the taste is average, and the service fee is not worth it. Western restaurant a pasta 88 yuan.

In terms of play, beach/karting/paddle horse/archery/water bike are all N brushes. The lawns in the entire resort area are very thick, which is really praised. Frisbee and children are very comfortable to play. There is also an accident that the mattress of the hotel did not let me recognize the bed.

The service here is really first-class, and it is one of the important reasons why I linger here‚Äº Ô∏è
Let‚Äôs talk about room service first üè†
Although I can only book an island twin room during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the services provided by Zhang Xiaoli and Aunt Ruan made me experience the feeling of suite service. Not only are they responsive and enthusiastic, but they also care about us in every possible way. After learning that my father had a cold, he delivered them immediately. Come to Brown Sugar Ginger Tea, and see that it is going to rain and even give us umbrellas. It feels like home here, almost all requirements can be met, I am really happy and comfortable, and I have no worries about bringing my baby
Breakfast ü•£
There are many varieties and they are very distinctive, including Zhujiajiao's special cakes and multigrain pancakes ü•û This pancake is my favorite. Although I have to queue up to get it, it is worth the wait haha. Thank you Zhu Fengxia for your hospitality. Your hospitality makes us feel so goodüëç
Restaurant üç¥
Every time I come back, I like to eat at the Sunshine Chinese Restaurant inside~
Eat here almost every meal except breakfast
Because the dishes here can be suitable for all ages, to meet the needs of adults and children, and the amount here is very large üòÄ
The first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival came too late, the roast duck was gone, and I finally got it on the second day. I strongly recommend the soy sauce rice here.
Special thanks to Wang Haizhen, who specially asked the kitchen to boil a large pot of ginger tea for us. My husband drank it a little more comfortably. The next day, the cold was much better. The service here is very good, and I can take care of the old and the young. It‚Äôs really fun to play here. Peace of mind at ease!
Looking forward to playing next year~
Forgot to introduce the focus is the beach üèñÔ∏è
This place is really comparable to Little Sanya~
Look at the pictures I took, it's a blockbuster hahaha
There are artificial waves üåä, the waves are quite big, adults and children are very happy to play hahaha

The waiter Zhu Hong warmly received us and provided us with services. really thankful! Dinner was received by Huang Guangjuan, a Chinese restaurant, who reserved a large table for us before, and also provided mosquito repellent water, which was very considerate. It's just that the choice of dishes is not much, and the taste is okay.

msg:I stayed in the parent-child room and played in the beach pool on Sunday. The weather was not very good. It rained intermittently. It was a little cold at the beginning to play. Fortunately, the sun came out later. The next day was also because of the typhoon and many facilities did not play, which is a pity.
The beach swimming pool is a different channel from the FIT. I took my son, a 4-year-old boy, alone, and the boy could not enter the women's changing room. It was inconvenient to change clothes and take a bath. The aunt was very enthusiastic and helped me to call a male lifeguard. After taking a shower and changing clothes, I said it was okay to wipe it, but I washed my son's hair and dried it, and put the wet swimsuit in a plastic bag for me! Really moved!
There is a dedicated customer service throughout the entire stay. I forgot to ask her name and added WeChat. The WeChat name is Red Mermaid - Membership Depar**ent Yang. If you have any questions, you will always reply in seconds. I forgot to bring the room card at night. Don't worry, after all, it was raining at night, but he helped me open the door within 5 minutes, and said I'm sorry for being late... This service is really excellent hahaha
When we got up in the morning, the staff passing by greeted us warmly. An auntie surnamed Ruan came to ask us if we had called a bus to pick us up. She would call a car for us if we needed it.
The Chinese restaurant felt that the price was a little expensive at first, but the taste was good, the quantity was large, and the menu did not have broccoli. The waiter asked me if I wanted vegetables. I said that children like broccoli, and other vegetables are average. I specifically asked. In the kitchen, I consulted the method I wanted, and made a special fried broccoli! üëç
I am satisfied with the whole process, but unfortunately the weather is not as good. If you have time, you can come to the hot springs when the weather is cold! !

There are shuttle buses on the island, which are always on call. convenient. There are also many play items. Small pastures and beach swimming pools are children's favorites. The small gifts sent are also very warm and practical. In short, it is a perfect experience. It is recommended to come here on weekends, the price will be cheaper, and the holidays will indeed be much more expensive. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are too many private cars on the island. If private cars can be banned and more open-top shuttles, the experience will be better. Also safer.

msg:At the hotel I stayed in before the typhoon in early September, the housekeeper was very enthusiastic to help me with my luggage, and went straight to the beach after a little tidying up. It was a bit windy in the afternoon, and it was a bit cold after getting up in the water. It is recommended to bring a bathrobe. Children can dig sand on the side. You can bring your own tools. A single swimming ring is 45 yuan for an unlimited time. After coming out, there is a bathroom, which is quite clean and tidy.
After swimming, I got a little hungry. I went to the western restaurant on the first floor of the lobby. The pizza was amazing, and the skin was thin and soft and glutinous. Ms. Fang Min, who served, also coaxed the children intimately.
Go back to your room to rest at night. When closing the window, you should pay attention to whether small flying insects and small animals are lying on the window, or they will fly in as soon as the screen window is opened. Call the front desk, and the staff will help with processing and disinfection within 2-3 minutes, and the efficiency is also great.
When I came back from breakfast the next day, the housekeeper gave the baby a small gift, Kaisen.
In the morning, I went to the small ranch. It was sunny and rainy. A small bag of carrots was 16 yuan. I wanted to feed the pigs, but the beard was cut off by the lambs wandering around. The children still suggested to come here and play for a whole morning.
Before coming by the typhoon and heavy rain, check out and go home~~

msg:Sun Island has always wanted to go, and this Mid-Autumn Festival, I finally succeeded in traveling.

The environment of the entire resort area is still very good. In addition to the villa accommodation area, there are also entertainment centers, small pastures, water pedal boats, barbecue areas, camping areas, wild riding pastures, beach swimming pools, and hot springs. The most characteristic should be Their Wang Tuobang can bring pets in, as well as a pet play area and a cute pet restaurant. It is really a vacation with a family and a pet.

For travel in the area, there are special shuttle buses for hotels. There are many trains. Basically, there is a car if you want to go out. There are children's play facilities, sand digging area, and a large lawn in the villa accommodation area, which is suitable for running and running for the dolls.
There are various types of accommodation in the villa area, the most dazzling should be the parent-child villa, which has its own slide type, which can accommodate three families, two large and one small. In addition, the one-bedroom and one-bedroom for parents and children is also a good choice. The most basic house line is their twin or double bed standard rooms on the island, which are distributed in large villas in the accommodation area, and a villa should have 16 standard rooms.
Plan to experience the one-bedroom, one-bedroom room type next time.

The small ranch in the area is also worth visiting. During holidays, the ranch will arrange a series of activities. We just came across the parade of animals, in addition to the regular alpacas, little pigs, there are little raccoons, slender mongooses, angora rabbits, and kel ducks. You can have close contact with children, and children like it very much.
In the ranch, there is also an indoor pavilion, which is similar to the now popular indoor zoo, with marine animals, reptiles, mammals (and kangaroos), two little goats are kept in the ranch, and children can feed them in the ranch. purchased feed. There will also be a program arrangement, I watched the pig race today.

There are several options in the water boating area, single, double, and four-person pedal boats, and the range of the lake that can be moved is not very large.
If you have a lot of friends, it is also a good choice to have a barbecue meal together in the barbecue area.

Individuals would choose to try camping in April-May or October-November.

We have limited time and did not play all the facilities, leaving it to continue to explore in the future.

The overall experience is still good.

msg:Sun Island Resort Hotel is really a good family hotel! It has been on my wish list ever since the hotel renovated the room with a rotating slide! Finally had the opportunity to come, and found that the hotel has really changed its old and shabby image and has a new look! The room I booked is a parent-child one-bedroom, one-bedroom suite, which is a log cabin. The one-bedroom, one-bedroom design room is very large, very new and clean. One is a tree house + bunk beds, and the bottom bunk bed is 1.8 meters. 1 meter on the upper bunk can sleep an adult! There is a mattress next to the big bed, and it can also sleep an adult visually! There is also a tree house that is a slide, which can be rotated to another room, and the other is the design of an audio-visual room, with projection, flying chess, Lego, and a small tent. The baby is so happy to see it! There are also tables and chairs suitable for a family to sit together. The toilet room is equipped with a washbasin and a children's toilet seat suitable for children's height. There is also a hanging chair on the balcony, which is very suitable for watching the scenery. You can park your car! The overall layout is spacious and warm, very child-friendly, very suitable for a family of three generations, I like the room very much! It didn't disappoint me!
The service also amazes me! I was thinking of looking for a salesperson to ask, but Yang Xiaorui, the butler of the red mermaid, took the initiative to add my WeChat account to tell me about the hotel's various situations. I thought about everything in front of me, and even provided earplugs, which is really quite Thoughtful! Self-driving in the park is very convenient. If you don‚Äôt want to drive battery cars and minibuses, you are always on call. The waiters are very simple and enthusiastic. I was mentally prepared for the service of such a celebrity hotel, but I didn‚Äôt expect the service at all. The price is really worth the price!
The hotel has swimming pools and beaches in summer and hot springs in winter. It is suitable for all seasons! The water in the swimming pool looks relatively clear. The children are very happy to make waves every half an hour. There is also a hand-cranked boat in the children's paddling pool. The play facilities in the children's world also have a certain scale. The island is rich in greenery, and the Chinese restaurants on the island can also eat and eat. , a large amount of taste can be, the whole place is very suitable for baby vacation!

msg:Although it belongs to an old-fashioned resort hotel in Shanghai, in this special period, when I dare not travel far, I can make up for all the assumptions about this summer's fun here. We left at 9:30, and it was almost 11:00 when we arrived at the hotel. Drive directly to the hotel check-in building, there is no waiting in line, after checking in directly, it is noon. It seems that you can't go to the beach in this 40-degree+ weather, it must be "roasting people dry" üòÇ. So I went directly to the Sunshine Restaurant on the second floor to have a meal. After eating, I went to Xiaotiandi Children's Paradise to immerse myself in the world of ocean balls. Here, the indoor temperature is a bit high, the children are sweating profusely while playing, and the parents are sweating profusely. At this time, it was almost half past two, and the child was obviously sleepy. I called the front desk and the staff were very positive. Said that he would remind us, and he would call us immediately when the room was vacated. So, at 2:30 we got the call and could go straight to our tree house slide room. Scan the code applet for us, you can navigate directly to the villa area. The moment the door was opened, the two treasures wowo~ rushed in to find the entrance to the slide, and the sleepiness at that time disappeared immediately. The adults quickly packed their luggage, and everyone took a shower to wash away the exhaustion and hot sweat of the morning. After a short rest, the children played directly until 5 pm. When they were ready, they went to the second floor of the building to have a buffet dinner. Since we were three adults, we paid an extra adult fee of 268 yuan/person. The overall buffet situation is good. The child accidentally knocked over the ice cream on the carpet, and the staff hurried forward to help him deal with it. I talked to the red mermaid housekeeper to see if there is a cake for the child's father's birthday on the day of check-in. He arranged for us a whole birthday cake to be delivered to our room after our meal. Thank you so much! There is a campsite near the dinner building. You can punch in. It is very pleasant to take a walk and take pictures in the evening breeze. There are still childhood memories in the room, flying chess üòÇ The three adults had a great time playing. Children can play slides while playing with blocks. It is really possible to enjoy the moment from old to young. There will also be a lot of snacks and toys in the room. Very sweet. We planned to go to the beach pool the next day, so we arrived at the cafeteria yesterday at around 8:40 for breakfast. Although the red mermaid butler reminded one night in advance that 8:40-10:00 may be the peak period. Sure enough, it really is. You can only go to another dining area on the right side of the door. There are quite a few types, and overall it's good. After eating, I went to the beach, and the surfing time started within five minutes of entering. The children were excited. Bought mermaid ice cream and drinks to relieve the current heat. Because in Shanghai's hot weather with a body temperature of 50 degrees, it is not very suitable to continue to bask in the water. After all, the child is still very young and can easily get sunburned. Look at the time at 11:15. Hurry up and send a message to Hongmei to say hello, the two children are afraid that they will not be able to check out at 12:00. It might be 10-15 minutes late, but I didn't expect the red beauty to say that it's okay, so you can call the guest room directly. After washing quickly, I rushed back to the room, changed the child's clothes, packed my luggage and prepared to leave. The children were still reluctant to say goodbye to the slide room. The next event is the long-awaited go-kart for the kids, probably on Monday, with not many guests. That's four or five pairs. The attitude of the staff is also very good. We drove a double bed, made up the price difference between the two cars, and started the metal kart tour üòÇ After the end, the children didn't want to come down. The staff said it was okay and let them sit up and take pictures. Then went to the bumper car project. Finally, we passed the excavator entertainment area, but we were only three years old and could not play completely alone, and we were unwilling to leave. The little brother of the staff immediately sent a few small toys of the excavator and car to soothe the mood of the younger brother. Overall throughout the whole day, I feel that the service is really online. Although there are shortcomings, for example, in Xiaotiandi Children's Paradise, there are children who are less than 100cm in length, and there are also a few children who are 180cm in height, and there are no staff to manage them, so there will be dangers. If a 180cm super-good child slides from the third floor What is the impact on the children in front of you when you go down the slide! This may require a limit on height. All in all, I would choose to come again. That is, the price is close to 4,000 per night. It would be more perfect if the price could be lowered a little more! ! ! üëç

There are many activities on Sun Island. This time I took advantage of the summer vacation to play the water park. It is in the same place as the swimming pool and hot spring. It is very convenient and has complete facilities, especially the wave-making project.
Sun Island is also very convenient to eat. In addition to the included buffet breakfast, I bought a buffet dinner on the first night, which has a lot of children's food and balloons. The next day at noon is the room ordering service, and there are also several restaurants to choose from.

msg:The hotel is located on the Sun Island in Qingpu. The so-called island is a piece of land surrounded by water. The Sun Island is surrounded by the concept of a river, but it is indeed an island. The whole island is a hotel, a bit like the feeling of one island and one hotel in Maldives.
The rooms on the island are distributed in two-story villas, which are a certain distance from the hotel lobby and various activity centers, so it is more suitable for self-driving tours and convenient parking. You can also take the hotel's battery car, which may be less free.
The hotel is equipped with an indoor swimming pool, etc., but only the outdoor beach swimming pool is currently open.
The little ranch is really small, and the small animals inside are very cute. There are two lambs scattered outside to play with the children.
There are pet suites, parent-child suites and family rooms, etc., which are very suitable for bringing your own pets and children to play with the whole family.
Due to the epidemic, dine-in is not currently open. The buffet breakfast is delivered to the room, and the lunch and dinner are also delivered after scanning the QR code.

It is true that three days and two nights have plenty of time, and the children have fun. Several attractions in the hotel can be called free shuttle bus at any time, and it will arrive soon. Beach surfing, hot spring swimming, children like it very much, and I went to play for a long time in two consecutive evenings. When I checked out and went home, I just left the hotel and asked when I would come back next timeüòá

Sun Island has naturally become a must-visit place. As a result, I have visited it again and again. The accommodation is comfortable, the food is convenient, the villa can also order takeout, and there are many things to play. Play in the water in summer and soak in hot springs in winter. You can ride horses, go karting, and shoot arrows. Now there are also close encounters with small river animals. The transportation on the island is just a phone call away. I'm planning a hot spring tour this year.

msg:I took my children and dogs here last year and thought it was pretty good. I came again this year, but I was very angry!

The first thing is to check in. We arrived at 2:50 pm and were told that there were no rooms and they were still cleaning. We asked how long the cleaning would take and they said it would take ten minutes. Note that the hotel actually had vacant rooms with the same bed type at this time, but it was Why would we know if they weren't given to us, because the room next door to us, as seen from the balcony, was a twin room, and there were two empty rooms, and no one checked in for the next two days!

Since you said the cleaning would only take ten minutes, we said we could drive there and wait at the door. However, we actually had to wait at the door for half an hour before we could get in, and it was not cleaned thoroughly. The urine in the pet area was not wiped off. There was a clear smell of urine on the bedside, and the smell was particularly strong when we lay down! Why didn't we ask to change rooms? We brought a lot of dog's belongings and we didn't want to move them after they were arranged.

Then the next day I went to Wangtopang to take a self-service shower. The curly-haired men at work had a particularly bad attitude. They basically didn‚Äôt want to talk to you and would annoy you if I asked you more.

Now that the epidemic has come to an end and all places are open to the public, the location of Sun Island is already relatively awkward. Although the hardware has been improved, such as replacing it with a smart toilet and adding a fenced activity area to the pet area. But the service is like this and we won't come again in the future.

msg:In view of the current situation in Modu, we still dare not make out-of-town arrangements for the summer vacation, so we arranged the Sun Island Resort Hotel in Ciqingpu to let the children play in the water.

The hotel is a villa type, there will be multiple suites in a regular room type, and there are special villa room types with indoor sliding and animation themes, which are very cool, but the price of summer vacation is a bit wolf, so I still choose the ordinary room type

The general decoration of the room facilities is also a little bit old. The phones of the three families and two families who went together can't use the toilet. It is also super small. When we check in at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, each family is given a welcome gift bag, which is more intimate. Small snacks, small toys, and mosquito repellent fans The anti-mosquito ring on the island does not require additional preparations for these anti-mosquito and heatstroke prevention.

There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, which are connected together. Outdoors, there is a wave pool and a big slide. Make waves once every half an hour. The big and small basins are very happy. Applying sunscreen is the only way we can be lazy. We only applied it once in the morning, and all our skin was red in three hours. In addition, the large swimming laps where we played waves on the spot needed to rent another 64/piece without time limit. On the first night, there were many swimming laps on the shore. So I don't know that the swimming ring needs to be charged additionally, which is equal to the wool [smile R]

There are two dinner coupons and two breakfast coupons in the package, so children over 120 need to buy additional child coupons for the swimming pool and only two adult tickets are given. Children need to buy additional tickets 99/sheet/day as a parent-child hotel relative to the nearest The price of 2400/night is really not intimate enough

In addition, I gave a play coupon that contains four items, one of which is Xiaotiandi, which is suitable for children under 130. The small ranch is very small and the merry-go-round is also suitable for young children. These free items are generally paid for a 200 coupon package to play archery, bumper cars and karts. Go-karts need to pay an extra 80/lap. Children under 150 can't drive independently and have to make up for a double car, but the venue is very large. The speed of gasoline karts is also very good. Boys like it very much.

The food on the island is really average. Every time you play in the water for a long time, after 13 o‚Äôclock, only the waterfall restaurant can choose. Only pizza, pasta, roast chicken and other choices are available. The evening buffet is also lackluster. The breakfast is relatively rich.

The overall summer sun island hotel room rates are on the high side. Many front desks ask for a new mask, and they also ask them to go to the small supermarket to buy them. If you can't live without Shanghai, it's a good choice for a vacation

It's very close to Zhujiajiao Ancient Town. If you haven't been there, you can go for a walk. It's quite interesting to do a hand-cranked boat tour of the ancient town at night and eat Qingpu farm food.

I have never been to Sun Island before, and this time I temporarily booked a room. The process was very pleasant. I encountered some small problems. The customer service mermaid also solved it in time. The attitude was very good and the solution was very timely! The most important thing is that the children are very happy, surfing and playing in the water.

It's not easy to play with the old mother and the puppy
Hotel self-service variety is more
Adults and children have their own choice of food
The pool water can be said to be very clean

It's so good that it's my little friend's birthday, and the hotel also gave him a birthday present. We stayed for three days and two nights and the children did not want to leave after playing.

msg:Looking at the weather forecast, I thought it would be cloudy for the past two days. Unexpectedly, God gave us two sunny days, blue sky and white clouds, and the scenery on Sun Island was extraordinarily beautiful.
Didi arrived at the front desk of the hotel. From the perspective of epidemic prevention work, it has done a very good job, but the hotel check-in is a little delayed, but at this time, you can go to have lunch first, and then go to other attractions on the island to play. During the process, a dedicated customer service will give you a WeChat or phone call to inform you to go to the hotel front desk and then check in.
Therefore, we first came to the Sunshine Chinese Restaurant, had a full lunch, and then went to the small ranch (two large and one small 168). The small ranch is very suitable for children to play, with a variety of indoor and Outdoor small animals, especially lambs, can be hugged by children at will. The pig race is cancelled because the pig is pregnant. There is also a place for children to rest and do handicrafts in the small ranch. , we made butter biscuits in it, 30 yuan, the children are very happy!
Between all the attractions and hotel rooms, as long as a phone call, there are shuttle buses to pick you up, even if you don't drive a private car, it doesn't matter, it's very convenient.
It has to be said that the features of this hotel are as follows:
1. There are rooms for parents and children, but unfortunately we booked the hotel during the peak period of July, and there are no longer available. It‚Äôs a pity (¬¥;Ô∏µ;`)
2. There are pets sharing the room with the owner, but unfortunately we didn't bring our cat
3. There is an independent parking space, which is very convenient; shuttle bus on call
4. The beach pool in the hotel has unique artificial waves, which are very fun and exciting
Here I would like to recommend and praise our exclusive customer service, Miss Zhang Xiaoli, we took the wrong take-out box in the waterfall restaurant, and we got it home. I contacted this lady, she helped us with enthusiasm and enthusiasm , solved the problem, no regrets. I am very grateful to her here, especially the considerate after-sales service, which fully represents the service corner of Shanghai Sun Island Resort Hotel.

The price of the charged items for children to play is also reasonable. Jiabao is serious about cleanliness. He really doesn't like the smell of animals, so he has no choice but to make small biscuits. Only the beach may be disappointing. It is indeed not suitable for playing with small children. It is open, Xiao Xiaobao can also bubble, and divert some people. I am lucky to resume dine-in. The children have a long-lost hearty breakfast, and the rest of the meals are delivered by meal service, which is convenient to eat in the room. , We have tried both Western and Chinese food, and they are all delicious. It can be seen that the chef cooks very carefully. There will be a service charge of 10% when ordering.

When I checked in, I was asked to choose the breakfast delivery time at 8:30. As a result, it was 2 hours late, and it was delivered to the room at 10:30. After urging N many times, there was no explanation. Reminder, it will be delivered in two hours, and this can be considered lunch.
Other sanitation and environment are worth affirming, the pet room has no smell at all, the dog is very happy in Wangtuobang, and also sees the beautiful sunset. If the hotel service can keep up quickly, I will still be willing to come to play often.

Every day in the room, a pet gift bag & a bottle of red wine & fruit snacks will be prepared intimately, which is very good value for money and a refrigerator drink, very caring
The most worth mentioning is the Wangtuobang Park set up in the hotel. On the lawn, there is drinking water and a toilet for the shovel officer for the furry child. My furry child and baby girl are running crazy, hahaha...

In general, our whole family is very satisfied with our stay at Sun Island Hotel this time. We booked one month in advance. Because our husband, mother, dog, and the whole family travel, we chose an extra bed to save money. It's still very affordable, and the family is very happy to live together. The big bed room has a door, so don't worry about privacy! Also, the pet room check-in is another place. It is not a hotel lobby, and there will be staff guides when you drive in.

üçÉEnvironment: Both the island environment and the room are very good, the pet room is very big, the dog has a separate room and a big gift bag is super happy, haha, there are a lot of snacks, as well as poop bags and wet wipes, in short, very caring~ Yes Hey, red wine, drinks, snacks, and capsule coffee are delivered in the room. Good reviews again!
üçöMeals: We basically rely on breakfast for brunch and afternoon tea at the pet restaurant because we can bring dogs. Dinner: On the first night, I ate at the farmhouse next to the gate of Sun Island. It was cheap, but it was too oily. Haha. On the second night, I ate at the Sunshine Chinese Restaurant in the resort. It was 198 for three people. The taste was also good. I think it was very üâë. The waiter Wang Haizhen was kind.
Play: I also went to experience the hot spring tickets given by the hotel. It feels good to soak outdoors in winter. Others are ordinary. We also went to the pet park. There are pet rides in the pet park. The dogs are very happy~ Go-kart, horseback riding, archery üèπ, very happy ~
For three days and two nights, our whole family had a pleasant trip to Shanghai!
Oh, I will definitely come back when I have children! Because I found that the slide in the parent-child room is very good.

msg:Went for pet friendly and liked it very much. To book a pet room, you need to go to the exclusive check-in area. That area is a pet's paradise with paradise, swimming pool, washing and so on. Take us to our room when we're done. Each room is a townhouse. Loved it as soon as I walked in. The whole design is specially designed for furry children, there is a separate bedroom for furry children, with fences, changing mats, beds and food bowls. The key thing is to warm the whole house! Comfortable home. A pet gift bag is also given to the furry child every day, including food and washing. So sweet.
The whole hotel is very big, you can call for a free shuttle. In addition to the restaurant where people eat, there is also a pet restaurant. You can order a big meal for the furry child. Our family is very happy to eat.
There are a lot of things to play in the hotel, including go-karting, horseback riding, archery, and a large dog park. You can drill holes for dogs, slides, etc., and there are üí© bags everywhere, which is very hygienic. You can also go to the forest hot spring at night, which is so pleasant.

Food tastes good too!

msg:Check in Sun Island Momo Haw on Sunday, I was so hungry after 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I immediately went to the restaurant to go to the hotel's western restaurant. The children's set menu is surprisingly delicious. The fries and pasta inside really surprised me and the outside The taste of the western restaurant is almost the same. The tomato, beef and cheese are very rich. The drinks and cakes are all finished. The service is also surprisingly good. Very enthusiastic and add tea from time to time. Staying at this hotel in the back is even more brilliant. A small hot pot with good taste at night, a long-lost beer, a leisurely drink, a lakeside townhouse with a tree house slide, and children who refuse to sleep at night and refuse to go home during the day üòÖ Leisurely horseback riding Super cool go-kart mini The version of the real excavator takes a cup of Lekoufu after soaking in the hot spring. There is an indoor children's paradise in front of the restaurant. The room where I live is the terrace paradise. This hotel is a hotel for our parents to recuperate. It's too relaxing. I think it's easier than Disney! Play in the water again in summer! !

There are also many entertainment items in the island. The most profound thing is that there are quite a lot of alpaca animals in the ranch. The unique flavor of old Shanghai is rich in fruit and tea. The parent-child suite is really good in all aspects. The service here is very good!

When the weather is good, there is a small climbing frame in the parent-child area, and the paid outdoor activities include small ranches and boat rides, as well as horse farms and go-karts. But it's all fun. There is a small ranch and a pig race. The budgerigar will fly to you when feeding the parrot. The experience is very good. If it rains, there are also many fun indoor projects. The entertainment center next to the horse farm at the gate and the kart can play bumper cars, treasure hunts, and archery. There is also a hot spring pavilion, a small world on the other side of the lobby, the game area is not large, and it is enough to play for a while. It is worth mentioning that no matter where the location is, the service of the staff is very good, cheerful, especially the red mermaid. As soon as I arrived at the store, I added my WeChat to provide the introduction and guide of the hotel. The needs in the room are the first. Time to respond and make us feel great. It's very good here. You can also come to the beach in summer. It's worth taking your baby to brush a few more times haha.

msg:üåû This is the second time to stay in Sun Island. The last time was an island room. This time, I booked a parent-child suite, and I specifically wanted to take a hot spring. The last time I came, there was no hot spring. The baby is very happy to see the parent-child room. There are slides, flying chess, and small toys. They are exactly the same as in the picture. I really think that when I come to the resort, I still need to book a slightly better room. The previous island room was really average. üöó Transportation: It is most convenient to travel by car. There are also buses on the island that can take you to restaurants, entertainment spots, and back to your room. Basically, it takes about 5 minutes. üßπHygiene: Overall it&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t see any messy places, a resort is all about making guests feel comfortable. üçÉEnvironment: The air is very good, the view is very wide, and the whole resort is very big. üîîService: In the end, the service is good and bad. I read the reviews and said that the service of the western restaurant is very warm. I feel it is okay, and it is not so exaggerated. I made a reservation for the small hot pot in advance. For reservations, if we do not include gifts, we need to make reservations in advance. The western restaurant has a service fee. This time, we did not charge us, maybe because my small hot pot is at my own expense, 158/person. You can also order other pizza pasta and so on, the price is ok, cheaper than I thought. There is also a small hot pot in the hot spring health center, which is semi-self-service, just eat it directly. The restaurants are all in one place, and the check-in hall (except for the hot spring hot pot) is clearly written for those who go to the resort for the first time. The Chinese restaurant Sunshine Restaurant has not been tried this time. If I go again in the afternoon, there is also a service charge, which seems to be 10%. The room service is the most satisfactory. The people who answer the phone are very patient and polite. I am more dissatisfied with the reception in the front hall. The front desk is the facade and needs to be improved. In addition, I took the baby alone at breakfast, and no one took a baby chair. I still did it myself. I feel that the catering service needs to be improved. The price of the hotel is so much higher in the peak season, so the quality of the service must be equal to the price. Recreational facilities, this is the second time I took my baby to play in the small ranch. It has been expanded and the playability is higher. A child on a slide inside is very enjoyable, and I will go next time! Archery is nothing special, similar to the outside, the merry-go-round is quite small. . . The others will not be discussed one by one, and next time I will play a water project. Looking forward to a better stay experience next time!

msg:Overall: an old-fashioned resort. The last time I came was in 1998 when I was a child. My children have grown up this time. The environment on the island is very quiet, the land area is large, and there are few people on the working day and it is very leisurely.

Travel: Compared with more than 20 years ago, private cars can be parked at the door of the house, and you can also ask for a shuttle bus on the island, and the speed is very fast and praised. It's a bit difficult to walk a field road before reaching the resort.

Service: This trip is for the birthday of the child. The staff also thoughtfully made a simple arrangement, gave small gifts, ordered a private room dinner, and also sent small cakes and longevity noodles. The experience is very good.

In terms of entertainment activities: Although there are not many projects such as small ranches, small worlds, horse farms, and bumper cars (compared to the area), there are places to go on rainy days and sunny days, which is very good. A suggestion is to expand some activities to meet the needs of different age groups.

Accommodation: This time, I booked the explorer villa and deluxe double room, and the photos on the hotel reservation page, what you see is what you get, the children have a full sense of experience, and it can better meet the travel needs of large families, with welcome fruits and drinks. The fly in the oin**ent is that the villa's sound insulation is slightly poor due to the empty design, the bath water will be a little cold after washing, and the shampoo and shower gel are not disposable (slightly clean obsessive-compulsive disorder patients are not very satisfied).

Price: The price of Explore Home is slightly higher, and the cost performance is not as good as the parent-child suite. Each has its own merits.

staff member:
Zhao Jing works meticulously
The red mermaid has a good attitude

Looking forward to the next vacation

msg:The old-fashioned villa-type resort covers a large area, and now the rooms have been renovated.
[Room] The floor heating and air conditioning are complete, the overall decoration is simple, the rooms are very large, the pet room is very spacious, there is a water bar, and the dog also has a separate room. The design is more reasonable. The pet room provides a full set of dog cots, food and water bowls, and even the toilet pads are changed every day, which is great. There is also a rich dog spree every day, ******** snacks, poop bag shower gel, etc. There is also a guardrail at the door to prevent the dog from going out when the door is opened, which is very considerate
[Service] The staff are very polite and actively improve if there are problems. Special thanks to Xiao Qu at the front desk of the pet room, Tan Zhengguang, the housekeeper, and Wang Haizhen in the Chinese restaurant. The service is meticulous, the response is fast, and the customer is at heart. When I learned that my birthday was on the day, I prepared flowers for me in a very short time, birthday noodles with exclusive lettering, and a heart-warming supper... Thanksgiving, it is really warm
[Pet entertainment] The villa area is wide apart, with few cars and wide roads. There are various small lawns and a large lawn in the southern area. The dogs are happy when they run and roll and play with each other. There is also a special pet pet park. The place is very large. There are tunnels, slides, swings, the road of the brave and other projects, but more suitable for big dogs. You can also make reservations for swimming, provide foster care, and more. Truly a dog paradise
[Entertainment] Went to the hot spring, 8 outdoor pools, 4 steam rooms, towels, bathrobes, slippers, complete facilities. The overall area is not large, and it is not high-end, but there is such a place to live and hot springs around Shanghai, which is very content. I also went to a small paradise, the place is not big, but there are many animals. Can get close contact with animals, feed freely, still very humanized
[Transportation] It is strongly recommended to drive by yourself. The island is vast, the guest rooms and restaurants are entertaining, and the distance between each place is not small. It's convenient to have a car, anyway, there are parking lots everywhere

Although the rain in winter is not large, it is cloudy. Hatched in the room on the first day. The next day, while the rain was light, I went out for a walk. Sun Island is really big. I googled it, and it's bigger than Century Park. There are cottages with sloping roofs in English country style. A few buildings also have an outdoor plastic slide that leads from the second floor to the first floor. It's a pity that the weather is not good, and I don't have much fun. I went to see the cute pet zoo and left. If you come again next time, you must choose a day with good weather.
If there is any highlight of this visit to Sun Island, it is that the food here is really delicious. When we came, it was just about lunch time, so we went to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor to eat. The environment is more elegant and clean, and the dishes are more like farmhouses. But the level is definitely higher than the farmhouse. Bai Zhan chicken is special on the day, authentic three yellow chicken, chicken taste is very rich, fresh and delicious. The fragrant egg is fragrant, I don't know how to get it, it is very fluffy and tender. The mutton and tiger preserved eggs are very in line with the style of the local dish with thick oily red sauce. The lamb was delicious and the quail eggs were fried into tiger-skinned eggs. But the most delicious is the bean curd inside, soaked in the soup, the taste is very good. Osmanthus pear is sweet and crunchy, full of sweet-scented osmanthus. The waiter Wu Xueying is gentle and kind, the kind that makes people feel just right. Hope to eat again next time.

Just leave a message on WeChat and a waiter will deliver it to the door soon. The aunt in charge of cleaning the room was also very polite and answered all our questions with a smile, but unfortunately forgot to ask her name. The room is very clean and has an air purifier. The small balcony is also very romantic. After checking out the next day, we also bought the hotel's 200 yuan play package. The children's theme karaoke sang for 2 hours. The two little friends also painted hand-painted T-shirts, playing and souvenirs, for the hotel experience. Perfect ending!

If there is a dog quarrel, they will be separated in time. The breakfast is also rich, which is very good as a weekend vacation in the city.

There are a lot of play facilities, but unfortunately it rains a lot of outdoor ones and can't play, so I'm ready to come back in the summer vacation. In terms of food, both Chinese and Western restaurants are very good. I especially commend Fang Min of the Western restaurant for his warm and thoughtful service. I look forward to seeing you again next time.

msg:The epidemic situation is very popular here. I have been brushing it all the way to Sun Island. I wanted to play in the water during the summer vacation, but it was postponed to the winter vacation to try the soup.
It's still suitable for children. The small ranch is good. There is also a small zoo inside. It will tell you some knowledge about small animals. If you buy feed to feed small animals, children like to interact with small animals.
In Shanghai, the outdoor hot springs are quite big. There were not many people who went to the drizzle that day. However, the weather was good and the weather was comfortable. There were 200 sets of tickets including four items in the entertainment center, but it didn‚Äôt seem to be a discount. Maybe it‚Äôs just convenient to buy. It's a pity that children can't ride a horse when it's raining. There are few outdoor development projects. It's the kind that children like to drill and climb outdoors. If there is such a venue, it will be better.
If you don't have a chance to taste the restaurant in the hotel, the price/performance ratio may be lower if you have to add a service fee, so I found a farmhouse at the door. It's quite convenient and the taste is good.

msg:I knew about this resort a few years ago, but at that time I had no choice because of the location. Now I just came to experience it because of the epidemic.
Before coming, I went to an internet celebrity hotel in Changxing Island, and came here with disappoin**ent. On the way, we also passed various country roads... and finally came to the island through a bridge. The result was quite astonishing! There are quite a lot of people in the hotel lobby, but it is also orderly. Three families stayed, so I booked an island villa with three bedrooms and one living room early in November, and delivered 6 hot springs every day, which was quite affordable.
The villa has 2 rooms upstairs and 1 room downstairs. Children can play in the downstairs hall. Comes with its own kitchen, all kinds of pots and pans are complete, you can do it yourself if you are interested. All kinds of facilities are ok, not as old as some people say. Fruit, water and beverages are provided daily. But it should be noted that the water used upstairs should be electric heating, and the bathing time should not be too long. Called room service and it came quickly. There are free buses on the island, just a phone call away.
The hot spring area is not too big, but it has everything. Remember to bring a swimsuit, of course, they are also sold at the door. There are about a dozen pools inside and out, and it was drizzling when they came, and the soaking is also a unique flavor. When you are tired, there are free fruit biscuits, ice cream drinks, etc. to replenish your energy. There are also places to eat, semi-self-service small hot pot. There are also steaming areas and children's playgrounds. The upstairs seating area can rest or watch a movie. It's a pity that I met a group of children in the winter camp the next day... 40 of them rushed in at once, and they really used "rush". We were speechless in the pool...
There are several restaurants in the resort, Chinese and Western restaurants. The food in the Chinese restaurant is good and the price is not too expensive. Breakfast is in the Changmao buffet restaurant, and the variety of dishes is quite rich. The most amazing thing is that there are also mutton soup and roujiamo‚Ä¶
The small ranch is also quite fun, and you can also get discounts on tickets on a review. The same goes for going in. Although the sparrows are small and complete, all kinds of small animals can be fed, and there are pigs racing... When feeding the budgerigars, they will fly into their hands, which is very cute.
There are also go-karts and wild animal husbandry are also highly recommended, you can bring children to play. The resort is also very friendly to pets, and has set up a club for pets... It is also a good choice to book a private room ktv when you are bored.
It needs to be emphasized that although the resort area is very popular and the area is large, the overall service is still very good, especially thanks to the beauty Zhang Xiaoli and the cafeteria Fang Hongyao Xinghua. The attentive and warm service made us feel warmer. The resort area is indeed one of the most family-friendly hotels in Shanghai, and we will still choose it next time.

msg:The itinerary planned early, all the relatives and friends want to go together before the trip, but unfortunately all the rooms are sold out. Unfortunately, after a little hesitation when booking, I booked an island villa. Fortunately, I was upgraded to explorer on the first day. Although it was only one day, it was also a highlight of the itinerary.
Food: The Chinese restaurant on the island tastes good, and it is eaten almost every day. The room service needs to be booked a little in advance, otherwise it will be made and delivered for half an hourüëÜüèª. The breakfast buffet tastes good and has a wide variety, that is, there are so many people every day. Lamb soup really üëçüèª
Accommodation: On the first day, the Exploring Family Room was very good. The whole house was heated, and the entertainment facilities were complete. The children couldn't sleep. The fly in the oin**ent is that it is too hot, and I can only cover the bathrobe at night, haha. The island villa is not successful. The facilities are aging, but the room is relatively clean. The service staff on the island has a good service attitude and handles problems in a timely manner. It is indeed worthy of praise as the comments say.
Play: There are many play items, suitable for children's small world, small pasture... Although the place is not big, it is already very good as a hotel. Hot springs and swimming pools are also popular among the elders. Going out to play, as long as the old and young at home are satisfied, I am satisfied too?
The only regret this time is that the god of heaven is not beautiful. When the spring flowers bloom, I will bring my grandmother to come again.

I feel that Sun Island is one of the few hotels in Shanghai that are really dedicated to pets, and the pet restaurant is the highlight. After checking out, you can also stay for a while to rest and take the dog to run, and make a little suggestion. It is best to open a green space in the villa area, so that the Mao children can run and play freely without worrying that they will not be able to catch up after running awayüòÖ

The 180 yuan/person forest bath is good and cheap, and it is also very affordable when included in the room rate, plus a very diverse breakfast~ The prices of other facilities and catering are actually just right, and I don‚Äôt think it is particularly expensive.
More importantly, the service attitude is excellent! The response speed is very fast. You can go in the park if you want. If you want to call a car, the free golden shuttle bus will arrive in front of you within 10 minutes. What is especially commendable is that even if the service staff you asked doesn't know how to answer your questions, for example, we asked the conductor of the little ranch about the habits of alpaca, and we also asked the hot reception lady what kind of cuisine the Chinese restaurant is. , although they don't know, they will immediately call you to ask the relevant staff and give you a satisfactory answer.
Before leaving the store, I also met Ruan Xianghong, the housekeeper, who warmly and thoughtfully sent us from the villa area back to the lobby, and introduced us to a more convenient and cheap way to return to the city without driving.

I hope the store will do more fun theme activities suitable for young people, such as music festivals, summer parties, open-air movies, etc., to make this resort lively and lively, and I will definitely go to play next time!

In addition, I would like to remind you that I took a look at the Mao Tower in the Tang Dynasty. It was a bit rundown. Since it is a first-class cultural relic in the park, it must be well maintained!

msg:Because the epidemic cannot leave Shanghai, I booked a parent-child villa one month in advance. I made a detailed strategy and chose a villa resort suitable for the three families to play together. Really great experience!
Especially when I choose to go on Friday, it‚Äôs really wise to travel on a staggered peak. Not many people can experience all the items. For example, the hot springs are already open. We used to rent out on Fridays. The environment is very good. Both adults and children have fun. The bathing place is also connected to the swimming pool. If you send a hot spring ticket, swimming is free. After swimming, there are free food and drink, as well as all kinds of steaming that men love, and a paradise that children love.
The bedroom downstairs in the room we stayed in was relatively large and could accommodate an extra bed, and there was a tatami upstairs. The children really liked watching TV together, so they just had fun in the room. The weather was so good that day. There is a terrace in the villa area where you can bask in the sun. It is so cozy. Watching the children running and playing sand climbing ladders under their noses, the old people basking in the sun and drinking tea to enjoy the afternoon sun. It has a taste of slow life in a small European town. There is no kitchen in the parent-child room, everyone knows, our dinner is our own hot pot and wine, tableware is in the room.
On the second day, you can park for free until six o'clock in the evening. We are not in a hurry to start taking our children around the park. It is too big to be picked up by a courtesy car. Children prefer to play go-karting and horse riding. The experience is very rare, and the child loves it too much. Then I finally had a barbecue here at the pier. I ordered a barbecue package of about 1,000 yuan and dried up the rest of the food the night before! so perfect! There is a sand pool next to the barbecue area. There should be a bonfire at night, but the children can‚Äôt walk when they see the sand. They can roll in the sand without eating, haha! So those who bring the children must prepare a few more sets of clothes!
Very fulfilling and satisfying for two days to play. I wanted to go to the ancient town of Zhujiajiao when I went back, but I gave up when I didn't have enough time to play here.

The room has only a small balcony, which is considered to have a window, but there is no big window, which is a bit unexpected.

msg:After reading a lot of reviews on the Internet and looking at many places, I finally chose the Sun Island Natural Ecological Hotel in Shanghai. The environment is very good. There are many fun here. We arrived early that afternoon to check in and we went to the small ranch. The piggy races and competitions are particularly interesting. I heard that there is a small theater after feeding the alpacas. Unfortunately, we missed the time. There are really no fewer animals than the zoo. The ranch staff have a very good attitude and go to the room to rest when tired. The guest room is very clean and tidy, and there are fruit drinks in it. We took a break and went for a kart ride to ride a kart. In the evening, we used western food and ordered roast chicken. A good and rich day passed. Just go to Batu, where the call is free, and there is a dedicated customer service who reminds us how to play during breakfast, and also made a recommendation based on the items we want to play. On the second day, the breakfast was quite rich, with many varieties, including Chinese and Western styles. It's a pity that the time is too short and there is not enough. I am going to experience the new room type they renovated during the winter vacation.

The fun of Sun Island Hotel far exceeds expectations
Serve
1. The most thankful person is Aunt Ruan, the housekeeper of the hotel housing depar**ent
Aunt Ruan helped us a lot when we checked in on the first day. Her enthusiasm and simplicity touched us deeply, from helping Xiaobao prepare toiletries to helping us take Xiaobao for a ride. Let's have a good time in Sun Island, Xiaobao also likes Aunt Ruan very much, and talks about finding her to play with.
2. The breakfast buffet at Changmao cafeteria is also very good. There are mutton soup, steamed buns and pancakes with fruits. I can feel the sincerity and seriousness of the old hotel. Thanks to the little sister Xiao Xu who met at the Changmao restaurant. She knew that we were going to the ranch later and she thoughtfully prepared drinks and fruit biscuits for Xiaobao.
stay:
Although the hotel rooms in Sun Island are a bit small and the decoration is a bit old, but the sanitation is very clean. (Our aunt Qingpu is really hardworking [naughty])
The resort continues to be renovated by area, and many rooms have slides.
Fun:
There are also a lot of fun in the resort. The ranch can feed the little animals to watch the pig races, drive karts, ride horses, and soak in hot springs.

As mentioned above, the first choice for walking the baby in the surrounding areas of Shanghai, you can still have fun with your baby for a day or two, and the service and catering are still in place.

Our family of three booked an island standard room and a parent-child suite. The rooms are available. Free drinks and fruits. The room has a free hot spring or a small ranch. The hot spring pavilion in Sun Island is decorated with unique characteristics. It is also interesting to rent a Hanfu to take pictures. I heard from the waiter that there will be old Shanghai shows on weekends. It‚Äôs a pity that we have seen it in the past, but there are not enough people on weekdays, so it‚Äôs suitable for us, so we can enjoy the beautiful scenery by relaxing in the hot springs. There are also snacks available for free. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the hotel‚Äôs Chinese restaurant tastes good, which surprised me. There are some special dishes of the hotel, and the amount of dishes is quite sufficient. The three of us are very supportive. , Satisfied, and full of happiness. Seeing that there are decorated rooms and new room types next to it is more fun than our stay this time. I am going to experience it next time.

In order to stagger the peak, I came to Sun Island Resort for the first time.
The club family room fully meets the needs of a family of three, the room is also very spacious, and children‚Äôs toys are not afraid of being bored.
It‚Äôs very convenient to have your own parking space at the door. It‚Äôs about 1km away from all places of play. It‚Äôs a bit hard to walk, but if you have a shuttle bus, you can rent a battery car or bicycle by yourself, which can solve the problem.
Sun Island Resort has a small program that is very useful. If you are confused about the surroundings, you will understand it. The front desk also has a map of the entire resort to pick up. Check in with tickets for swimming pools and hot springs, and there are places where you can play in the water in spring, summer, autumn and winter.
It should be very refreshing to play in autumn, preferably in the mosquito-free season. After all, there is a lot of wood here, but there are no insects in the room, and the mosquito repellent comes with it.
Next time I will choose the island villa to come with more family members. On the whole, the service at the resort is still good. The doll in the parent-child room can't be taken away (I thought it could be taken away like Disney...)

msg:Nice hotel, suitable for traveling with pets, friendly to customers, shuttle bus is also very convenient, on call, there are beach swimming pool children have fun, and various indoor and outdoor hot springs, although there are not many pools, but to play It‚Äôs not bad to have a bubble hot bath all day long. My favorite is the various saunas, char-grilled, rock-heated, stone-steamed, rounded down and properly "steamed meat". There are also free fruits and ice creams, but the various types of tea provided in the evening are too weak. It is estimated that I have been adding water all day. In addition to swimming, dogs also have a big playground where they can run freely. This is the favorite of city dogs.

There is one room on the first floor and two on the second floor, which solves the problem of leg and foot inconvenience of an old man. There is a formal kitchen in the room. Tableware and dishes, induction cooker, large refrigerator and even bath towels and detergent are all available. Soft drinks and beer in the refrigerator are free. The service staff are very kind and welcoming, especially the aunt who cleans our room is responsive. The breakfast is also very hearty. The Chinese and Western restaurants are upgraded versions of the farmhouse and Western-style simple meals. You can rest assured to try the dinner. Because it‚Äôs a working day off peak trip, the price is very high, the entire hotel park is also very quiet, Mao Tower is quieter. The four old people all said that the scenery is great, and living in a large villa is also very warm, and they can come again next time.

For the first time, the furry child has his own room, although he still only wants to sleep with others. There are also pet rooms around the independent suites, so you can go out and socialize.
The only downside is that the petting park is too far away. Although shuttle bus is provided, it still feels a bit inconvenient. The breakfast is farther away.
Warm Tips Do not go to the hotel reception to check in directly to the pet park Wangtopang.

Unexpectedly, not only the room is full of fun, but also a variety of food and entertainment for adults and children. The butler service is particularly meticulous and responsive. The catering is also super cost-effective. The waiters have a very good attitude. The whole amu*****t park is made with "intimate" and "parent-child" features. Very well in place, all three adults and children are very satisfied, and decided to come again in the future! Moreover, the place is very large and the environment is very comfortable. Two days and one night of various kinds of fun are not enough. I hope to come back even if I live in an ordinary villa in the future~
Call the waiter and the housekeeper at our table by name and thank them for making our experience extremely happy and satisfying!

msg:3 days and 2 nights to take a baby tour, the 10-month baby has too many trivialities and facilities to play. I did not expect that the butler Tan Zhengguang and his team here have thought about it for us. Don't dislike me being wordy, listen to me slowly to share.

A group of 5 big and 1 small. My parents, my friends just married a young couple, and my 10-month-old baby with me.

Live: Single-family island villa. 3 rooms. 2 halls and 3 bathrooms. On the upper and lower floors, everyone can communicate with each other and ensure their privacy.
I saw a lot of pictures of the room structure. To be honest, it‚Äôs 120 square meters. It doesn‚Äôt feel big, but it‚Äôs very comfortable. Miss Ruan Xianghong also took out a bubble machine to coax my baby and taught it to me. They succeeded. Give your baby a way to overcome eczema.

üöó Transportation: Recommended for transportation by car! Really, the facilities inside the hotel are super convenient to the scenic spots outside the hotel
So we had a full schedule, not only visiting the ancient town of Zhujiajiao, but also to Qingxi Country Park.

üßπHygienic: The room is very tidy, because I have a baby, so I searched both inside and outside the tatami room. The ladies of the room service are also very friendly. They learned that the children often need to change the smelly diapers. They intimately left me a lot of tissues, nursing suits, shower caps, and even garbage bags.

üçÉEnvironment: The villa area is very beautiful. Room 1003 is just next to the pet room. Dog lovers can be seen walking around with their pet dogs. Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Shiba Inu are the majority. Small tea cups are rare, and they are also super cute. There are clusters of houses, dense lawns, and neat low trees, so a few small pets are refreshing.

üîîService: I don‚Äôt know why Ctrip says that the service is not good. When I went there, I made two mental preparations. First, I heard that everything in the resort costs money, and second, it is said that the service is not good, but For three days, all the waiters smiled at me, greeted the baby kindly, and made the baby laugh. Warm and friendly introduced me to play items, and chatted with me. Sun Island made my trip very warm. When I entered the restaurant, I immediately arranged a seat and brought a baby chair. Passing by the door, there will be a customer service staff who will call you warmly and ask what you need. The little brother in the small pasture will guide you all the way. Every small animal will be introduced carefully, and the children will be asked to pet them.

Finally, let‚Äôs talk about eating. There is nothing to eat near Qingxi Country Park.
There are too many in Zhujiajiao Ancient Town, the taste is good, the price is a bit expensive
There are also farmhouses near the hotel, the price is beautiful, but the taste is average.
We ate breakfast for two days in the Changliu buffet restaurant. It was delicious. It was a bit expensive for 88 people, but it was great if it was included in the accommodation. The 10-month-old baby also drank white porridge + egg yolk + a handful of vegetables or yam every day.
The Chinese restaurant just forgot some special dishes. So it's very cost-effective. The pork noodles with pickled vegetables are super large and delicious. The local eggs are the most authentic since Qingpu came!
Western restaurants are relatively expensive. The beef is thunderous, and the fragrant spring chicken is average. Braised pork rice and Hainanese chicken rice are super delicious

We ordered a table for 6 people, 996, with 3 hours of barbecue time, including a special roasted whole chicken. , Steak, vegetable platter, charcoal and oil, and some seasonings can be provided. After eating the buffet the next day, I went to the small pasture, where the three children spent half a day and made small biscuits. You can call a shuttle bus anywhere on the island, which is very convenient. Overall feels good

Day 1: Arrived on Wednesday afternoon, check-in, go around Sun Island and have dinner. There are not many people on weekdays and it is very friendly to the kindergarten children.
Day 2: In the morning, I went to the Changmao cafeteria for breakfast. There were a lot of things and they were fresh. The fruits and juices in the hotel are at room temperature because of the children. This is a thoughtful consideration. Named and praised the waiter Fang Hong and manager Chen Ping, the service attitude is very good! After eating, I went to the beach. The tickets included in the package are recommended to wear swimsuits, slippers, goggles, water guns, swimming rings, and bath towels. It's a pity that the cold spring is not open during maintenance, but the surfing and beach children also have fun, and they are quite clean.
Same as above on the third day.
On the fourth morning, I checked out and called the guest room depar**ent, Ruan Xianghong, who was responsible for our room service. The room was cleaned very clean. Every time I saw our children, they greeted us warmly and gave them small gifts.
I asked the children that they would come next time, when? Next week! Have you considered such a high consumption on the island? [Laughing and crying]

msg:See the thunder in my hand! I don‚Äôt know how to rely on this comment. The price is luxurious enough, but the price/performance ratio is super poor!

üöó Transportation: Basically it is self-driving, and the shuttle bus on the island is fairly convenient. Except for a picking garden and a few farmhouses, the surrounding area is the countryside.

ü•≤The room is really old, and the whole is secretly small and depressing. The facilities are also rudimentary. The two toothbrushes I gave when I got the room card were really speechless. The quality of the hotel is not of this kind anymore. Slippers are also the kind of reusable ones. If you have a cleanliness habit, you will feel uncomfortable. Although it is not a summer vacation, the price is still not cheap, living in such an old room, I don't know what the picture is, everyone's money is blowing in the wind.

It might be said that Sun Island is so expensive because there are so many attractions, but it's too naive! Except for horse riding because there is a racecourse (the taste is quite big, it feels better on the top floor of Yuanzu Dream World), the other facilities are the gap between the seller show and the buyer show.
Archery is the kind of night market stalls; bumper cars are in an indoor room, and the cars are also very rudimentary; go karts are next to the racecourse, and a rack with a diesel engine; water bikes, most of which are small yellow ducks, plus 20 for the coupon. The carousel is so small that no one can play at all. There is a free children‚Äôs area next to the front desk, which was changed from a conference room box. There are several tables, a few pieces of colored paper, and a few boxes of colored pens. Some ponies and a small slide, seriously? Is there really nothing to play anymore?

ü•∂Almost all projects cost money, and the facilities are all capitalized perfunctory, the price is not cheap, you have to add money at every turn. The hotel guests gave two beach swimming pool coupons. Not to mention the rough and dirty sand and the service desk that costs money for everything. The coupons turned out to be a one-time entry. What's the use of the hotel? Forget what to take, either buy it on the spot or spend money to come in...

The only thing that was okay was the small pasture, where two goats chased guests everywhere for carrots. There are peacocks, pigs, alpacas outdoors, birds, rabbits, and Cole ducks indoors, one baby raccoon, and one capybara is very cute and silly. Even the dark environment is lonely and pitiful. „ÄêThe small pasture has a larger number of customers for the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day. Five or six carrots and 16 pieces. „Äë

The breakfast is okay, so it‚Äôs okay. Let‚Äôs have enough. Many people in the pancake line are slower. In fact, they can be one and a half people. If necessary, one can be given. This is efficient and avoids waste.

After eating a Chinese restaurant, the environment is okay, the dishes are expensive and unpalatable, not too fresh, and there is a 10% service charge...

There is almost nothing to play around 6 o'clock in the evening, except for the chess and card room and KTV, not very good with children. It was dark and mosquitoes, and the TV signal was not good when I returned to the room. I really cried.

Which resort hotel is at this level with the parent-child label? Will not go again and do not recommend anyone to go. In contrast, Amy Sheshan and Kaiyuan Senbo are much better...

From top to bottom, it rushes directly to the head and face, and the children can only hold them in their hands, which makes it very difficult for the parents. There are many amusement facilities. I played go-karting and horse-strolling, and I was very happy. Due to the limited time, many of them didn't have time to play. I will go again next time I have a chance.

The room service is very good, the room is equipped with anti-mosquito equipment, and the housekeeper Tan Zhengguang is warm and thoughtful.
Passing by the barbecue site by the lake, someone booked a roast chicken, which was fragrant, because the weather was too hot to experience the lakeside barbecue, so let's stay next time.

The parent-child suites are too popular, so it's great to be able to book a club suite. Especially the various eating, drinking, and fun in the set menu is very comprehensive, and children of all ages can have fun. Welcome fruits, small gifts, minibars and red wines in the customer service are all pleasant surprises. The hospitality is very attentive, the service is very attentive, I feel very comfortable, live at ease, play at ease, and give us five-star praise from the housekeeper Ruan Xianghong who is in charge of this stay!

The overall feeling is a bit like Clubmed. The price of meals on the island is also very affordable, the taste is good, there are many things for children to play, horse riding and go-karting are very cost-effective.
Although this time I only booked a common room, the children can't wait to see a friend to live in a suite next time.
It would be better if there were more activities in the evening

We arrived at noon, and check-in still required three o'clock, so it was useless to give us the room card in advance. Cleaning was slow. We gave our license plate number to the front desk when we checked in, but we still paid the 20 yuan parking fee when we left. The pet room we stayed in was not given a pet gift package. I thought it was just small things and it was too hot that day, so I didn‚Äôt do these things. The scenery of the resort was okay. We are older children and the bed in the twin room was still too small. This is not user-friendly. We should introduce some twin rooms with larger beds. Apart from swimming, the entertainment facilities are no longer of interest to older children!

The villas are well-equipped, clean, tidy and comfortable, and the mothers who are obsessed with cleanliness feel very good. , The two children had a great time playing, the trampoline and slide in the villa have already made them happy. The three-room layout is very suitable for the whole family to stay together. There is also a beach bathing area for Internet celebrities.

Because the island is so big, you have to call for a shuttle bus wherever you go. In this peak season, with so many people staying, a regular shuttle bus shuttle mechanism should be formed. There are still a lot of things for children to play, suitable for parents and friends to barbecue on holiday. The eating situation in the neighborhood is so-so, there are several farmhouses, basically the chefs are off work after 8 o'clock in the evening.

msg:Because of the epidemic, you can't leave Shanghai, so let's take an in-depth tour of Shanghai! Two days after grabbing the Qingpu Sun Island and bringing the children, it‚Äôs a joy! On the same day, I drove on the wrong highway and arrived at Sun Island Resort at about 13:30. The 14-day itinerary code + temperature measurement at the gate, drive directly to the hotel lobby, fill in the form, there are not many people, check-in is fast, the little sister at the front desk is very enthusiasm! (No need to take luggage off the car, because the room is a little bit away from the lobby)
Drive to the room, put down the luggage, can‚Äôt wait to go out and play, choose the shuttle service, the car comes incredibly fast, a minibus is for the three of us, and then we found that parking at various attractions in the resort is very convenient, and then we opted for self-driving Horse riding, archery, sand digging, go-karting, and the soft pottery of the Artisan Pavilion are all gift items. The children are very happy. Dinner is also a small hot pot in the package, which is better than expected. The waiter is very active and adds soup. , Replace the pelvis in a timely manner. After dinner, the father took his daughter back to the room to play PS5, relax, and then went to the indoor swimming pool, the father and daughter swimming pk, and the father gave up. The bathroom in the swimming pool is in good condition, and all the young and old are taken care of. My daughter washes here for two days. It is a perfect day.
The next day we welcomed my younger sister‚Äôs family, because the room was so popular, the younger sister‚Äôs family only grabbed a room for the day, checked in (the specific room is not yet known), put down the luggage (our room), and went to the beach pool at 10:30. , There are not many people, there are not many lounge chairs and umbrellas, but they are all free. Starting from a small water park, slides, surfing (compared to the charge of 100/30 minutes for an inflatable boat in a large hotel in Sheshan, here is 50/day for single swimming, 80/day for two, and 45/day for small tents, here The price/performance ratio is still very high) The children have a lot of fun. Until lunch, I was still reluctant to give up. Fortunately, I was very friendly to hotel guests. I checked in with the front desk before going out and I could re-enter.
According to yesterday's investigation, I wanted to go to the Sunshine Restaurant to eat drunk crabs, but I went late. I finished my order at 13:30, so I would go again tomorrow! I moved to the western restaurant, Fried Niuhe was amazing to me, and the taste was very good. I ordered pizza, seafood noodles, roasted spring chicken, salad, and western food. Everyone knows that it tastes good overall, and the kids enjoyed it. After the meal, the little sisters went to the Ingenuity Hall to continue making t-shirts, soft pottery, and kites, leaving an adult to accompany them, while the others returned to their rooms to rest. Dinner is still a small hot pot, three people become six people, the gift can not be wasted üòÇ.
On the last day, after the breakfast buffet, the children took their fathers to boating, horse riding, archery, and go-karting, while the mothers packed their things and prepared to check out. Check out is very convenient, just hand in the card and report the room number. The children were still playing in Xiaoxiaotiandi, while the mothers went to the Sunshine Restaurant to order food. I ordered the drunk crab that I missed. The drunk crab tastes good, and my daughter likes it. The Shanghai soy sauce fried rice is fragrant, the stewed egg is tender, the white sliced chicken skin is delicious, the three fresh soup and the fresh crab fat, the tea tree mushroom does not seem to like it, the dessert crystal fairy grass The frozen portion is very sweet and delicious. The key to the resort is not too expensive.
Finally, there was another family ktv, and the children turned into Maiba! A local tour in Shanghai ended perfectly!
Generally speaking, Sun Island gives me the feeling of a treasure island, convenient transportation, warm service, beautiful environment, and all people of all sizes are satisfied and happy! Children are especially looking forward to the adventure villa with slidesüè°

The one-bedroom and one-living room is very suitable for bringing a baby. It is big enough. The minibar in the room provides 6 cans of drinks for free, and also comes with a bottle of red wine and capsule coffee. The air-conditioning is adequate, I think there is floor heating. The bathroom has an electric toilet. The air volume of the hair dryer is large enough. The best thing is that you can park the car at the door of the house, which is extremely convenient for self-driving tours.
Played in the small paddock, fed animals, watched piggy races, and made biscuits. Also played indoor swimming pool and outdoor beach bathing. It's still an outdoor praise, for surfing and sand digging. The only reminder is that the dressing room and shower room of the beach bath are separate. It is best to prepare a swimsuit bag and a change of clothes bag in advance, and remember to bring a towel.
Eat in the Chinese restaurant and the western restaurant, they can produce it, and it is not expensive. It's on the first and second floors of the lobby.
So the waiters I met are all online, and they will do everything they need to do. They are not busy and are very willing to communicate with customers.
Next time I want to book a villa with a slide!

I actually spent more than four hours inside the project, and I still enjoy it. If I didn‚Äôt rush to eat pizza before the waterfall restaurant closed, I could still play for a long time.
The waterfall restaurant is highly recommended. It is open from 11:00 to 16:00, and there is no in the evening. Its pizza is very delicious~

There are many entertainment items in the hotel. We bought a 200 yuan to choose from four entertainment items, riding a go-kart and rowing a boat at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf. I took lunch on the second floor of the hotel and got the room card. The room was also very clean. I changed into my swimsuit and went to the beach swimming pool to play until the evening. The beach swimming pool generates waves every half an hour for 5 minutes. It is very good. There is also a duck and duck pond, a bubble pool, an infinity swimming pool, and a hot spring pool, which is especially suitable for children. It was quickly resolved. I have to say that the after-sales processing of the hotel and Ctrip is still very good. On the second day, although the hotel‚Äôs breakfast buffet was not too many, it was enough to choose and eat. Then I took the children to play for a whole morning, and the children were particularly happy. It was a very good two days and one night. By the way, the hotel's taxi-hailing service is particularly good. As soon as the phone is hit, there will be cars to pick up and drop off. In order to protect the privacy of the children, the pictures are all posted.

Checking in coincided with the weekend peak time, the room has not been cleaned yet, the cleaning staff on a hot day apologized very hard and said that we had been waiting for a long time. The battery shuttle is very convenient. Tell the front desk by phone and the car will pick you up to the playground. Every staff member has a smiling face, and there are questions and answers. The only bad experience is that there are too many people in the locker rooms on the outdoor beach, almost crowded, not to mention showers and locker rooms. I personally suggest that the locker rooms for in-house guests and foreign tourists should be separated.

It was in a small state, but the hotel‚Äôs customer service Red Mermaid was attentive and enthusiastic, helping us to solve the problem. The children played in the beach pool.

msg:Parent-child outing during summer vacation, all eating, drinking and having fun on the island is very worry-free!
Swimming pool: divided into indoor and outdoor outdoor surfing. Kids especially like it (it ends at 6:30 in the afternoon, and it seems to be late on the weekend). The indoor pool attendants are very kind and attentive. It may be because there are outdoor swimming pools and there are not many people in the indoor pool. It is open It's ten o'clock in the evening, and the water temperature in the indoor swimming pool at night is still a bit cool (it is recommended to bring your own swimming ring and water gun toys in the beach outdoor baths...the purchase price inside is expensive!)
Other children‚Äôs entertainment: horseback riding, ranch, archery, bumper cars, engineering vehicles...Basically all are in place, you can consider a 2-3 day trip
Housing: There are more room types in the villa area. Free shuttle bus is very convenient. I checked in on Tuesday and booked two nights on Ctrip. Check-in and check-out were very fast. I also gave gifts when I left the store. Thank you! The only unfortunate thing is that I met the summer camp team. The children in the building I stayed in were quite noisy. I was woken up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and my daughter did not rest well.
Dining: Chinese food is not bad! Western food children like, there are children's packages
I don‚Äôt know what's going on for a hot pot, I didn‚Äôt make an appoin**ent twice...
So I wanted to change my taste and went to the farmhouse outside the island to have a meal. "Gucun Farmhouse" is very good, the price is very cheap, the taste is good, the business is booming, and the hotel shuttle bus to the gate of Sun Island

The service of the housekeeping depar**ent is very good. First, because it was inconvenient for me to take the elderly, I helped me change the room near the parking lot. Because I take the elderly and children on vacation and need to live for a few days, moving things is a headache for me. I lived in Building 53, and the housekeeper saw me with the elderly and children. He took the initiative to help me move things, and also helped me to support the elderly. The service was super caring! Second, the Chinese restaurant. The deliciousness of the dishes in the Chinese restaurant is something I didn't expect, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good, especially named and praised: Wang Haizhen, for a few days on the island, all meals were served in the Chinese restaurant. The Chinese restaurant also has takeaway! At noon in the scorching heat, ordering takeout to the room is also very comfortable!

This time I mainly wanted to give the children a unique tenth birthday, and invited their parents to go out together. The hotel is very different from twenty years ago, and has been completely renewed after renovation. Because it is an island, the humidity is relatively high, the hotel is very considerate to each room house with a dehumidifier. There are bus transfers from the guest room area to any scenic spots and amu*****t facilities. The Mermaid Wharf can also rent bicycles (double or single) and electric vehicles (driver's license required). Have a great time and will come next time. Will also introduce and recommend friends.

A family of three, this time there was no appoin**ent with friends or family members, and came to play alone. At first, I was worried that the child would be bored without a companion, but the worry was unnecessary.
I drove to the resort at noon on the first day and went to the front desk to check in. It was too early and the room had not been cleaned, so I went to the beach swimming pool to play. This time the kids didn‚Äôt want to come out. My father accompanied me to dig sand and soak on the beach. Soaking in the swimming pool and playing in the pool three times to make waves, it was a lot of fun. Mom was very happy when she lay on the beach chair and watched them rush into the waves. After a little bit, the front desk called to say that the guest room could go in, but it was quite fast.
I went out to the front desk to get the room card when it was almost four o'clock, and found that there is an indoor playground on the second floor of the front desk, which needs to be paid separately (two large and one small 80 yuan). The children went in for more than an hour to play, and my father and I were right next to the point. Take a drink and sit down for a break.
I finally entered the room after five o'clock. The room type of the club is a separate townhouse. The living room and room are very large. At first, I was worried that there would be bugs and mosquitoes, but I didn‚Äôt find them until I left. insect. This room type also presents minibar drinks and beer, as well as a bottle of red wine! Drinking and watching TV at night is just so hehe üòú
Dinner was eaten at the farmhouse restaurant at the entrance of the resort. The taste was good and the price was affordable (Gucun people).
The softness of the hotel bed and pillow suits me very well, so I slept well this night.
The next morning I went to eat breakfast, called the shuttle bus in the resort, waited for a few minutes in front of the house and the shuttle bus didn't come. A small battery car came. The aunt who drove heard that the shuttle bus didn't come. Just say to send us there, here I want to praise the staff encountered in the resort, all of them are very enthusiastic and very nice! The breakfast is simple, but there are all Chinese and Western styles. After eating, you can take a shuttle bus in front of the building and deliver it directly to the front of the house. It's so convenient!
I plan to come again this autumn and winter, when you can experience the hot springs.

Thank you for the warm reception of the service staff of Sun Island. The island is very large. You can drive or call the shuttle bus on the island, which is very convenient. This time I lived in the newly launched Tanxiangjia Family Villa on Sun Island. The children had a great time and were very satisfied. I especially want to thank the Su Mei from the restaurant, Xiao Xu from Western food, Manager Chen for Breakfast, Xiao Lu, etc. for their enthusiasm. The manager Jing in the lobby received warm reception and will come again. [Strong] [smile]
