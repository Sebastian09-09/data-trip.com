msg:A very satisfying vacation journey. Before checking in, the butler Lulu contacted me in advance to confirm the arrival time at the hotel to ensure smooth check-in. Although there were not too many popular rooms recently, they tried their best to coordinate with me to the appropriate floor. The room is very clean, and the hotel environment is very good. The large swimming pool is very clean. Adjacent to the beach, breakfast was also very rich. After staying for two days, we promptly cleaned our room. It was very embarrassing that I lost my room card while dining at the beach restaurant at night. I sent a message to Lulu at the door and helped me get a new room card within 5 minutes. The efficiency was very fast and the process was very timely. Thank you very much to Lulu. Unfortunately, this trip was quite rushed and I didn't have a deeper experience! I hope to have more time to check in again next time! Overall, I am very satisfied. Recommended!

msg:At Westin Hotel in Haitang Bay, Hotel housekeeper Damon added Wechat to help arrange rooms, went to the hotel to help check in, introduced hotel information, booked airport buses, and served very enthusiastically. The hotel's river pool is worth signing in, can canoeing, adults and children can play, very fun. Next to the hotel is the duty-free city, where shopping is convenient, walking can be reached, very convenient, but also by ferry to the side door of the hotel, the overall stay is satisfactory. 海棠湾的威斯汀酒店，酒店管家Damon添加了微信，帮忙安排房间，到了酒店帮忙办理入住，介绍酒店信息，预约机场巴士，服务很热情。酒店的河道泳池很值得打卡，可以划皮划艇，大人小孩都可以玩，很有乐趣。酒店旁边就是免税城，去那里购物方便，步行就可以到，很便利，也可以坐摆渡车到酒店侧门，整体入住满意。

The breakfast buffet was one of the best we’ve had in China. Not so much the breadth of choices (which was very good), but the quality of the ingredients and food itself. Excellent! The large main pool was fun and full of activities. Also, it was nice to be so near the duty-free mall.

Upon check-in, there was an English speaking employee named Jason who helped me check in and added my WeChat to make sure my stay went smoothly. I was upgraded to an ocean view room that was beautiful. The hotel has a bunch of different pools and areas to relax. There is also a quiet beach if you want to get your feet in the sand. I don't think swimming is allowed. My room was very clean and I loved the walk in closet because it didn't clutter my room. The employees were all very polite and helpful, even the ayis. I got a free photo shoot and a bunch of other perks with my stay. I always appreciate the little things, like lavender oil during turn down service, that make your stay more enjoyable.

Wi-Fi is very slow, breakfast buffet is quite complete but need to be earlier otherwise there could be waiting line. Rooms are spacious and clean.  Infinity pool on the 9th floor is not easy to find and very few seats to enjoy the view that need to be booked.Overall, being only 7 years old, the resort looks much older than it is. I would say that 5 stars are a bit overrated.

msg:Took my parents and friends to play in Hainan. From Haikou to Sanya. Stayed at the Westin Haitang Bay in Sanya. Booked a 3-day 2-night package online. Very favorable. Free 2 breakfasts and 1 night barbecue buffet. Enjoy the trea**ent of Maldives hotel. The hotel provides a butler for each guest. The butler contacted us one day in advance. Although the online said check-in time was 15:00. But the butler said that if there was a vacancy, he could check it in for us in advance. It was much better than in Maldives. Very humane. Thanks to the butler Luna. The hotel is very big. There are multiple swimming pools. You can play with your family. You can also paddle board, which is suitable for young people who like to take pictures. The waves at the beach are very big. Not suitable for swimming. But suitable for playing in the waves. So happy. There are also security guards who will remind tourists to pay attention to safety. Bath towels can be provided by the beach and the pool. Very thoughtful. The hotel upgraded our room. Fruits were delivered when we arrived. There were so many that we couldn't finish them. I like to eat mango. I asked the front desk for it. As a result, a pot was delivered. It was great. Stayed in the invincible sea view parent-child suite. They are all very big. Two bathrooms. No need to force it 😂. There are bath salts with fragrant smell. You can take a bath when you are tired. There are also toys and dolls in the room. Children's toiletries. Very satisfied. The hotel package includes a night buffet at the seaside Shuite restaurant. The waiter Aria Huang is very warm and thoughtful. Seeing that we ordered online, she sent us the lobster and coconut jelly that are unique to the Internet. It is very delicious. A very perfect stay. My parents and husband are very happy. There are also foreign singers to entertain us during the meal. 👍

msg:24.5.13-5.18 I stayed at the Westin Haitang Bay for six days and five nights, and booked a premium sea view king room.
The purpose of this trip was just to relax by the sea, not to play any games or do anything. I just did nothing every day lying on the beach, listening to the sound of the sea and relaxing. I chose this time and place with this vacation purpose.
Before coming here, I looked at the Westin Haitang Bay Hotel after a friend's recommendation. After that, I also did some hotel guides on Xiaohongshu and read the enthusiastic recommendations of netizens. To be honest, if I hadn't seen that there were lounge chairs on the beach of Haitang Bay where I could lie on the beach all day, and this was what I wanted to do most on this trip, I would probably not have booked this hotel.
However, it was because of these reviews that I personally didn't have a particularly high expectation for this stay. So there was a little surprise.

Okay, let me talk about the points that I think are OK

1. It's off-season, there are fewer people and fewer children, which makes me feel very good. The hotel is well landscaped. You can see various swimming pools from the lobby, including children's, central axis and Westin's famous river pool, and then the pool where the dinner BBQ is. You can walk to the beach. Because I have done a guide, some people say it is far away, but I think it's okay. I took some photos along the way and it was actually quite fast. It took about 7 or 8 minutes to walk.
2. The room is very large. I read other people's guides before staying in the sea view room. When booking the room, it was also stated that it was a side view of the sea, but after staying in, I found that the sea view was very good. Of course, it can't be compared with the hotel with the seaside as soon as you go out, but I am also very satisfied (illustration in the picture above). The view on the balcony is very good and open. You can see some other hotels opposite, such as the most conspicuous Atlantis. The hotel is quite quiet. There is a swimming pool downstairs. Occasionally, there will be the sound of children playing, but the balcony glass door can basically isolate it.
3. There are lounge chairs on the beach! ! ! ! It's great! ! ! ! ! ! This is my favorite because this is the purpose of my visit! The sea is very open and the scenery is very good. The sea water is not particularly blue, but mostly green. The color changes with the color of the sky. The sand is very fine, the wind is very strong, and the waves are also very big, so there are safety guards at the beach. As long as they find someone walking into the sea to swim, they will sound the alarm and shout. Because it is the off-season, there are really few people. Compared with the Yalong Bay beach I saw, this beach is really satisfactory. I am very happy to lie on the beach every day. The scenery is very good. The sea, the sky, various tropical plants, white clouds, and dark clouds are all very good even if it rains a little. There are also young couples, small families, or young sisters and brothers who come to travel and take photos, as well as uncles and aunts. They all look great! That kind of happy mood can affect many people! Many young ladies on Sweet Potato said that when they walked to the last 100 meters of the beach, they really felt great the moment they saw the sea! It’s really happy for an inland kid like me! ! !
4. When I checked in, I was assigned a housekeeper named Cassie. She was very enthusiastic. Because I didn't check in at the time, the housekeeper helped me with other formalities and stored my luggage. Then she helped me choose a room according to my accommodation requirements, and then I went to the beach for a stroll. I was notified in time that I could check in, which was a little earlier than the normal check-in time. Usually, she would take the initiative to ask me if I needed anything, and she would respond immediately and solve the problems that needed to be solved effectively. When I checked out, it was Saturday and there were a lot of people. Because I booked the hotel's shuttle bus to the airport at 2:30 pm, she also helped me delay the check-out for an hour in this case. I am very grateful.
5. It is really close to the duty-free shop, super close, just a few minutes away! ! ! This is also the reason why my colleague recommended Westin to me at the first time. Although I didn't have this itinerary at the beginning, it was too close. I went for a stroll on two nights and spent some money unplanned. Then because it was off-season, the speed of picking up the goods at the airport was smooth and fast. Now there are coupons for booking air tickets on Ctrip in June. Everyone can try it, but it seems to be limited. Please consult Sweet Potato for details. 6. The first round of drinks in the mini bar was given upon check-in. But I didn't drink them. There was really a lot of water. When I saw Sweet Potato for breakfast, many people said it was not good. I think it was pretty good. There are both Chinese and Western food, and there are many categories. I ate it for five days and felt it was OK. As a Hunanese, I think the taste is very 🉑. It can be spicy if you want it! Except for queuing for a while on Saturday, there was no queuing at other times. It was smooth to sit down, but you may sit outside when there are many people. Except for the last day when I felt a little hot, I felt it was quite cool at other times. The attitude of the restaurant staff is very good. 7. There are several swimming pools. When you check in, you can rent swimming props for free for one hour and experience it. You can also take a travel photo. Parent-child activities are given. There is a children's play area on the underground first floor, and there is also an outdoor one. Although it is not known as a parent-child hotel, it still has the necessary facilities and equipment. Of course, it cannot be compared with parent-child ceiling hotels. Because the wind is really strong and there are a lot of green plants, there will be leaves and petals in the outdoor swimming pool. I think this is inevitable. There will be lifeguards on the side, and they will clean the leaves in the swimming pool from time to time. I saw that many adults and children rented beautiful swimming props, especially those who wanted to take pictures in the river swimming pool, and basically rented rowing boats. I soaked in the swimming pool for 2 hours on two days. There were not many people, and it was really a bit cold when the wind blew. There are lounge chairs by the pool, and there is a place to rent swimming props. There are also free boxes for storing valuables in the back, which scan the face. By the way, the passage to the duty-free shop is next to this swimming pool. There is also an entrance to the elevator upstairs, which is very convenient.
8. Finally, when I was about to leave the hotel, I communicated with the housekeeper Cassie about my feelings during my stay and made some small suggestions. I felt that the housekeeping department attached great importance to it. A supervisor called me to communicate and found me to talk to me about this matter in person before I left the hotel. I think their attitude and awareness are still very good. I hope it can really help them.

Then let's talk about some minor problems

1. The distance from the airport is indeed a bit far. I took the airport pick-up service provided by Ctrip, which was based on the distance. Because it was the off-season, there were only three groups of people on our bus, and I was the only one from Haitang Bay. It took about 1.5 hours from the airport to the Westin. In fact, if you don't send other guests, it takes about 50 minutes from the Westin to the airport. It takes about 30 minutes to take a taxi from the Westin to the Wuzhizhou Island Pier.
2. The service is indeed not in place. First of all, when I was sent to the airport, I was sent to two other hotels in Yalong Bay. Other hotels would have staff in the lobby to open the door for reception, but when I got to the Westin, because I was the last one to get off, even the driver who sent me said that there was no staff to receive people here, really no; I went to Atlantis one night in the middle, and the contrast was also quite obvious. Whether it was picking up or sending people, the service of Atlantis was obviously better; the second was in the room. After I checked in, I found that the glass in the drawer was broken. As soon as I opened the drawer, I heard the sound of breaking. Then I checked in on Monday, and it wasn't until Tuesday or Wednesday that white slippers were placed in the room. There were no slippers before. Because I brought my own slippers, I don't think it's a big problem, but if it's other customers or people who pay more attention to this aspect, I think they might still mind it; thirdly, when I washed my hair on the first night, I found that the conditioner was gone. Maybe the cleaning staff forgot to check and replenish it. I replenished it after telling the housekeeper the next day; finally, some cleaning details, including some other things, may still need to be more detailed. Two rounds of cleaning every day are quite in place.
3. When booking, Ctrip reminded me that there are benefits for consecutive stays, and I am a gold card member of Marriott, but when I checked in at the front desk, I didn't actually enjoy the benefits such as room upgrades or other services, and the day before I came, I found that the room price of the same type on Dianping was hundreds cheaper. I explained this problem at the front desk, but it didn't seem to be of any use. However, during the communication process, the front desk lady gave me breakfast, one a day, and I was very grateful. But when I went to have breakfast on the third day, the staff found that there was no breakfast in my room card. At that time, because the housekeeper was resting and I couldn't contact him in time, I went to the front desk to ask. The front desk replied that I needed to contact the staff who received me at that time, but I was given a note to go to dinner. During the meal, my housekeeper called and explained the situation and quickly helped me solve the problem.
4. The facilities in the room can be upgraded a little. For example, you can add a USB port. Because the panels I looked at are relatively old, and some are even loose ＞＜ In addition, the TV is a little small, and the sound and picture are a little out of sync with the screen. The bathtub in the room is indeed in the middle of the room. I think it's OK because I live alone. There seems to be a dragging partition on the side, but if it is a family of several generations, I think it may be a little bit not OK. Give you a reference.

The room does smell like white tea, and the whole hotel is white tea. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the lobby, please pay attention!

In short, although this 6-day, 5-night trip was a little bit imperfect, I am still quite satisfied. If I have the opportunity to lie on the beach again in the future, I will probably still choose the Westin Haitang Bay Hotel. I hope the hotel pays attention to the operation of Xiaohongshu. I hope you will get better and better!

ps: Don’t believe the weather forecast in Sanya*^◎^* I checked it before and it rained for five of the six days. As a result, the first three days were sunny during the day, and it started to rain heavily at five or six in the afternoon. There was no rain in the last three days. However, after the rain at night, the sky was really blue and beautiful the next morning.
Another ps: Haitang Bay is relatively close to Wuzhizhou Island. You can see Wuzhizhou Island on the beach, and Xi Island is a little farther away.

Luna, the housekeeper, contacted me one day in advance and added WeChat. She also helped us book the airport bus, which was super convenient. Our time just matched the airport bus, which saved the taxi fare.
During the entire stay, Luna would contact me to see if I had any requirements. She was able to meet all my requests, which was super great, and anything I needed would be delivered quickly.
The front desk guy was also very nice, and he was the type who would meet all my requests.
The hotel is super big, and there are electric cars to take you wherever you want to go.
Come to Sanya to experience a five-star hotel, with beaches and swimming pools.
We booked a family room, three adults and a baby. I am more than 1.6 meters tall, and it's not bad to sleep on a round bed, but my feet would be outside the bed in the middle of the night, but it didn't affect it.
The overall environment of the hotel is very clean, the swimming pool is also super big and clean, and there are mosquito repellent bracelets for babies.
I will choose here next time I come.

Although it rained for two days, it did not stop our enthusiasm for kayaking. Moreover, the location is very advantageous. We can go to the duty-free shop directly from the side door. In short, the experience of this stay is very good. I have recommended it to my family and friends. I will stay longer next time because I don’t have time to arrange many activities. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Cassie for her good attitude and timely help me solve problems. I love you!!

msg:2024/05After May Day, during the off-season, I stayed here:
The beach seats in the public area are closer to the sea, which adds points to the whole trip. There are no beach seats in the hotels to the right of Haitang Bay Beach, or they are hidden in the hotel park, far away from the sea. So if you want to lie down, some room types in this hotel are very cost-effective.

There are Aedes albopictus in the hotel park, especially near the villa area and the swimming pool.

The Chinese food is OK, the breakfast is average, like the common parent-child cost-effective hotels, the vegetable market, this one receives many tour groups.

During the stay, the rooftop infinity pool was not open, and the lounge club was not open (there is also a rectangular swimming pool hidden inside).

The service attitude is average, the breakfast level is average, the hotel environment is superb, very beautiful, close to the beach, the sea view is superb, the sand is very fine, and there are many children's activities. The disadvantage is that the children's paddling pool has been in disrepair for a long time, and the tiles on the bottom of the pool are falling off, which is easy to scratch your feet. Reminder, the deluxe twin room faces the back of the duty-free shop, and it is possible to be given a room facing the construction site next to the duty-free shop. When I first checked in, I was given a room at the end of the corridor facing the construction site. Later, I asked to change it. It took a long time. Please ask more when checking in.

msg:Overall, I was very satisfied with this trip to Westin. At first, the butler who arranged the connection was not very responsible. We had agreed in advance that there were elderly people and children who needed child guardrails and toiletries. The other party promised very well and said very nicely that they would arrange everything and try their best to arrange a room. As a result, when we arrived at the hotel, we found that the room was very bad, the floor was aging, and the corners were moldy (other rooms in the hotel were not like this, but the one we stayed in was very bad, facing the north, usually there were few guests, and there was a large construction site outside the balcony); in addition, the promised child fence was not arranged, saying that if the fence was not enough, it might not be installed for us (I guess I made an appoin**ent in vain), saying that they were not a parent-child hotel so the fence was not enough; it rained that day, and the room was very humid at night. The child was scratching all night and didn't sleep well. In short, the initial experience was very bad. After reporting to the hotel, the hotel quickly upgraded the service. We were served by the excellent Miss Erin. Erin was very professional and tried her best to understand our grievances and needs. She understood and solved the problems from the perspective of customers and kept apologizing to us for the hotel's previous service. She not only took the initiative to change and upgrade the room, installed the fence, but also thoughtfully re-dried the bedding. She has been doing everything she can to make us feel the joy of the journey, arranging travel photography, afternoon tea and dinner. We can feel that she is doing everything she can to serve us, which is very touching. The subsequent journey was very safe and comfortable because of Erin's arrangement. Thank you very much! Next time I go to Sanya, I will still choose the Westin Hotel. I hope to see Erin again [smile]

The only drawback: the breakfast reception capacity is relatively saturated, and you need to queue up to be seated after 8 o'clock. If you go early, you can skip the queue.

1. The upgraded room experience was great! The hotel upgraded the room based on the room status of the day when I brought my child. When I opened the door, I saw the park landscape, which was a perfect visual experience.
2. The check-in experience was great! I was sent back to the room all the time on the same day, and introduced the hotel settings and baby's play in detail. I was very patient and gave so many welcome fruits that I was surprised.
3. The rich breakfast experience was great! Chinese, Western and Hainan specialties were all available, and there were special tableware for babies. Every day, various staff would greet you, and you would have the illusion of being in Bali.
4. The beach buffet for dinner tasted good and the service was great! The lobster was super delicious, and the staff also patiently distributed mosquito repellent.
5. The Chinese restaurant tasted super good! The foreman sister came from Sheraton and always recommended her apprentice Qiumei. The service was really good and she got full marks! The beef cubes and Wenchang chicken fried chicken were delicious, and they also gave me mango sago.
6. I highly recommend paddle boards and surfboards. Both children and adults had fun playing with them.
7. Things that touched me the most during my stay:
(1) I choked on water in the swimming pool and got stuck on the swimming ring. The lifeguard helped me immediately and paid attention to me. He was professional and considerate.
(2) My family member was unwell during our stay. The hotel kindly provided a thermometer, helped deliver medicines and takeout, and helped delay check-out. They were thoughtful and considerate.

msg:I checked into this hotel on April 26, 2024, and was about to check out on the 28th. My child wanted to play in the hotel's swimming pool again, and after playing for a while, he wanted to change a swimming ring, so I went to the service station next to the swimming pool to rent a swimming ring. During these few minutes, a terrible thing happened. The child actually drowned. At the time of the incident, there were three lifeguard positions next to the swimming pool, and no one was on duty! The child had been drowning in the water for a long time, more than two minutes! One of the lifeguards was positioned opposite the child's drowning position and was less than five meters away, but none of the lifeguards who were supposed to protect his life were there! Later, the child's mother found him and shouted, and the hotel lifeguard ran over. Finally, he was rescued by a kind-hearted guest staying in the hotel. The child cried for half an hour, and no one from the hotel cared about him during this half hour. Afterwards, we asked to check the hotel surveillance to understand what happened. The hotel first said that the surveillance was blind and then refused to provide surveillance because of regulations. We found the camera that could see the pool by ourselves, but the hotel claimed that it had privacy regulations and could not show it to us. It could not provide relevant regulations. It took four hours. We called the police and saw from the surveillance video of the incident provided by the police that there was no lifeguard on the lifeguard seat to protect the guests' lives during the whole process! The video shows that the child drowned for more than two minutes! If it is not discovered in time, it will definitely pay the price of life. In the more than four hours of asking the hotel for surveillance, knowing that he had left his post without permission and almost caused a life accident, we went to the swimming pool many times and saw that the lifeguard was still off duty on the seat! It is simply treating the lives of tourists as worthless! The hotel's disregard for the safety of tourists' lives and the serious problems of safety management! When a safety accident occurs, the attitude of refusing to investigate and the attitude of not making timely rectifications, once such a hotel is in danger, it is not only a family tragedy! It is also a social tragedy! As the leader of the national tourist city, such a situation should not happen! Do you still want to go to a hotel like this? If you bring children, I advise you to think carefully. Would you stay in a hotel without such security?

msg:I had a great time in the hotel for two days. The hotel environment is good, the breakfast quality is also good, the housekeeper service is good, and I was pleasantly surprised to be given a free upgrade to a room with a sea view. All my requests were met. There are a few shortcomings: The next day after breakfast, I returned to the room and found that the cleaning lady had opened the door, and I did not ask for cleaning. This does not respect privacy when there are people in the room. In addition, the hotel security is not strict enough. There is no staff at the hotel entrance to ask or register people entering the hotel. Anyone can come in. The beach can also be entered at will. The elevator does not require a room card. It feels unsafe. I hope the hotel can pay more attention to security.

The hotel facilities are complete and it is also close to the duty-free shop. The nearby Houhai is also very good. The greening of the park 🌴 is very good. There are also a lot of fun things to do in the swimming pool. There are also sofas to rest by the pool. You can experience kayaking in the river swimming pool, and you can also make an appoin**ent for travel photography. It's great. Miss Luna's warm service is very nice. She introduced the hotel information and praised the overall service. This trip was so happy~👍👍👍

It is separated from the duty-free shop by a wall. It is very convenient for shopping and eating. You can also visit Houhai nearby. Highly recommended. The location is good, there is an underground parking lot, and the hotel is also very large. I like the paddle board in the river pool and the rooftop bar for taking pictures! The hotel staff has very good service and is very enthusiastic. Thanks to the housekeeper Miss Ella for her attentive service.

She also helped us book meals and buses, and gave us a small gift when we left the hotel 🎁 Thank you very much for ella's care. I look forward to staying a few more days next time. I like the hotel bedding and toiletries. The outdoor environment is full of tropical style, with coconut trees, beaches and the sea. It is very comfortable to blow the breeze at the beach. The beach sand is very fine. This time, all three meals were eaten in the hotel, and they were all very good!

The hotel has complete facilities and is equipped with a large conference room and lecture hall, which is suitable for hosting large conferences. The hotel's outdoor activities are also very amazing. The artificial water system is so charming that it is the best choice for parent-child travel. The hotel has its own beach, where you can lie leisurely for a day and enjoy the pleasure of slow life... Especially the beach buffet in the evening. In addition to the sumptuous meals, the performances of several overseas musicians on the scene can be called a perfect life music show, a super value experience! The infinity pool on the roof garden is a blockbuster with just a casual shot... Of course, we also have to talk about the shortcomings. It is said that the interior design of the hotel rooms is a team with the 08 Olympic Games Hotel design. The interior design is a bit boring and outdated... But it is understood that it will be renovated soon... Looking forward to it! 
It is especially worth thanking that the hotel service butler Ella's service is very meticulous and thoughtful, making the stay experience more convenient and comfortable. 
It is highly recommended

msg:The hotel is very big. From the moment we entered the store, the concierge was very enthusiastic to help with luggage storage. It was not the check-in time yet. We arrived at the store at 11 o'clock and there was an empty room, so we were arranged to check in. The experience was good, just in time for the baby to take a nap. The dishes in the Chinese Elements Restaurant in the hotel taste good, but they are a bit expensive, and the portions are not large. You can buy coupons and packages in groups. There is no service fee for the packages. The hotel has many swimming pools, and the water park is also very suitable for parents and children. Kayaking is OK, and it is more fun to play with several people 😁. It is recommended to choose breakfast when booking a room. It is not convenient to eat outside, and it is more expensive to buy it separately. Overall, it is still good. The only thing is that the waterproof measures next to the bathtub in the guest room are not enough, which is a bit worrying for those with little babies (I always go to drain the water. I wrapped it with a bath towel,) The ground is wet and cannot dry quickly. Little babies are prone to falling without shoes. I didn't watch them fall before checking out 😓, but it is suitable for my big baby to play 🤭

Overall evaluation: The breakfast is delicious, the environment is Southeast Asian and comfortable, but the room layout is average and the swimming pool is too cold in this season.
I would like to express my gratitude to the housekeeper Amy for her thoughtfulness and thoughtfulness starting a day in advance. WeChat reminded us in advance and responded to all our needs as soon as possible. This is very heart-warming for families with children.
There is a takeaway cabinet in the hotel lobby, which is very convenient for picking up food.
Children's activities in the hotel are quite comfortable. The breakfast is rich and Southeast Asian style. This season is neither cold nor hot, and I feel full of happiness.

msg:Service: The service is superb. From check-in to check-out, every step is just like the "peak-end law" described by Daniel Kahneman in "Thinking Fast and Slow". Although the service manager does not understand behavioral psychology, he To truly implement this concept, the essence of a hotel is service, and all services revolve around people. This is something Westin Hotel has done well.

Environment: The sand of Haitang Bay beach is finer than Yalong Bay, with less impurities, making it suitable for parent-child activities. However, it should be noted that the waves here are generally larger than those of Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay. Children must pay special attention to safety when playing! If you go to the beach at night, you can consider digging for sand crabs. You don’t need to be taxed by people on the beach who claim to be digging crabs. Just be sure to bring a light.


Facilities: The Westin Hotel belongs to Haitang Bay. It was developed in Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay. The overall facilities are newer than those in Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay. Free family bicycle tours are provided when you check in. There are also parent-child club activities, so you want to save worry and effort. Young parents can consider half-day care or full-day care to liberate their parents. The overall decoration style of the Westin Hotel is youthful, simple and fashionable. It is not parent-child style or luxurious style. I personally like it, but this is not hinder parent-child activities

Hygiene: The bathroom is divided into toilet, shower and bathtub. The dry and wet separation is better. The cleaning lady cleans it in a timely manner.

I booked a Supreme Sea View Room, and was upgraded to a Sea View Suite for free when I checked in at the store. The room is very close to the side door. The infinity pool and river pool are very good, and you can experience kayaking and glass boats. The environment of the hotel is also very quiet, with very good greenery. The hotel's private beach is sp****ly populated and quiet, and it is very pleasant to vacation. I nominate and praise the butler Damon, who introduced the hotel information and helped to bring the luggage to the door of the room. The service is very nice. There is also a "good night service". After shopping, water and lavender essential oil are placed at the head of the bed, and a pair of slippers are placed on the towels laid by the bed. When you arrive at the restaurant for breakfast, the waiter will ask where to eat, and will lead you to the dining table in the house, so you don't have to find a seat yourself. I am very satisfied overall and will come again. 👍👍👍

You must go to the hotel's river swimming pool to take photos and check in. You can kayak and take photos. It is very photogenic. The hotel's infinity swimming pool is on the top floor, and the filming rate is 100%. Remember to make a reservation for afternoon tea before, so you can go up to enjoy the food and check in (it is recommended to bring a swimsuit to take photos). The hotel's environment and facilities just met my requirements for a vacation. The location is excellent, very close to the duty-free shop and can be reached on foot. There are also many restaurant choices. I will choose them next time. Recommended! If you book with Ctrip, you can also enjoy value-for-money services such as free first-round minibar in the room, carpool pick-up, shuttle bus drop-off, and travel photography. The bedding in the room is very comfortable and the light blocking effect in the room is also very good. Finally, special thanks to front office manager Guo for the arrangement, room attendant Zhong Yanyou, and restaurant manager Scortt for their considerate care. After knowing that I am pregnant, they will take the initiative to greet me and provide considerate services. Make people feel at home!

Thank you to the kind-hearted Ella for such considerate service. In addition, the beautiful woman at the front desk who checked me in also gave me a deposit-free check-in. (Since the first hotel in Yalong Bay was a failure, I have been feeling uneasy about the second hotel. I also recommend that everyone not to change hotels at will, which is a waste of time and energy)
1. Westin is so beautiful! Really, the picturesque scenery is intoxicating!
2. Kayaking is fun and very exciting!
3. The children’s play area is also very exciting! The color matching is unique, you need to play with bare feet, otherwise it will not be beautiful if you step on it! Remember to bring a pair of non-slip socks for your baby to prevent your baby from complaining about foot pain.
4. The room is also very clean and tidy with a balcony. There is a large round sofa in the room and a long sofa on the balcony, which is very good! The bathroom has two mirrors to create a sense of large space! Seriously, very attentive! There is also a flashlight in the cloakroom, which is very thoughtful! (It seems that all hotels do not have screen windows. You need to close the glass door and turn on the air conditioner to sleep at night, otherwise there will be mosquitoes)
5. The staff in the housekeeping depar**ent are very professional, courteous and courteous. They are worthy of being a five-star hotel!

Watermelon and corn are very popular. Huaxi beef noodles are also delicious. There are also pumpkins, potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables. One day at noon, I saw the staff throwing away the leftover food in a western restaurant, which shows that quality control is very strict. It is also recommended that you take as much as you can eat and don’t waste it.
7. The hotel staff are very attentive: during meals, the staff will promptly take away unused plates, etc., and will take the initiative to help guests if the situation requires it. Really, I would like to express my special thanks to the waiters, girls, and housekeeping staff that I have come into contact with. Thank you for your attentive service and serious work! Your politeness, professionalism and conscientiousness prove that staying at the Westin is the right choice! The Westin is not only visually beautiful but also feels like home!

msg:This is not my first time to the Westin in Haitang Bay. If you want to take good photos and have fun, Westin is the right choice! The infinity pool on the top floor is very eye-catching, and the unique tropical rainforest pool downstairs winds from the hotel to the seaside pool.
If you go for a walk on the beach in the morning, jump in for a swim as soon as the sun starts to get stronger
There are coconut trees on both sides of the pool and river pool. The swimming pool under the shadow of the coconut trees has a cool water temperature in the afternoon and is so comfortable that you won’t want to come out when you soak in it.
The hotel has different children's entertainment activities from Monday to Friday, suitable for bringing children, and many couples come here for vacation.
❤️The most noteworthy thing is the service of Westin. The butler Nike (Yang Zerui) will call in advance to understand the guests' needs and help solve many problems during the stay. Thank you very much. There were some problems. Hu Jing, the lady from the housekeeping depar**ent, also came to help solve them and gave them aromatherapy humidifiers. On the way to the airport, I saw the refrigerator magnets given by Nick. I was very impressed. In short, everything was perfect and I will come again. .

It only takes 5 minutes to walk to the duty-free shop, eliminating the hassle of finding a parking space.

The private beach 🏖️ is great, quiet, and there are not many people, but the wind is strong and the waves are big, so swimming is not allowed.

The hotel has free airport shuttle bus, which runs 4 times a day and requires a reservation one day in advance.
I personally think the breakfast could be more substantial.
There are many children's play areas and daily activities for children, and many people come with children. Recommend it!
The duty-free shop is right opposite the hotel, just go out through the small door of the hotel. Recommended for everyone to stay.

What I like the most is the quiet environment here. The hotels are widely spaced apart. There are few people on the beach. The Coconut Grove Beach has a tranquil feeling like a vacation. Haha.
The airport pick-up bus was very comfortable, the room design was very spacious and comfortable, wet and dry areas were separated, and the cloakroom was also great. The hotel is very beautiful, with a wide view. The river swimming pool in the park is clean and beautiful. You can go kayaking. The environment is very beautiful and there are many green plants. I chose the Chinese-style set meal. The children especially liked the beef cubes, rice, steamed eggs, and chicken. The room has a large bathtub, which the children love very much.
I am also very grateful to the VIP service for receiving Miss Cassie. If you have any questions, please contact us at any time and respond in a timely manner. I plan to stay here for a long time next time I come to Hainan.

msg:I've always wanted to check in at Westin, and it's really good. The housekeeper Grace contacted us in advance to inquire about the check-in time and needs. Since my room type was being renovated in the third phase of the duty-free city opposite and there was a spare room, she upgraded us to a sea view suite for free, which was great!
The hotel has indeed seen its age, and the room decoration is quite old-school, and you can still see the traces of time, but the service is very good, there is also evening and night cleaning service, and lavender roller balls are given to help you sleep.
There are too many activities in the hotel. The 24 hours spent in the hotel are very fulfilling and busy. The hotel is very big. From the concierge, you can ask for a shuttle bus to the beach and duty-free shop. You can also call the staff at the beach water restaurant and the side entrance of the duty-free shop. The car will pick you up and take you back to the lobby, which is very convenient! !
In the afternoon, we tried paddle boarding and travel photography in the river pool. The paddle board is ¥100, free for those with the big player package, and the swimming ring is ¥30 (you can pump it up for free if you bring your own swimming ring). In the evening, we had a buffet dinner at Shuiting Restaurant. It was very a**ospheric and the food was rich. I went shopping again before the CDF duty-free shop closed at 22:00. I once again felt that it was so convenient to be close to the duty-free shop!
The buffet breakfast the next day was also very good. It was very comfortable to sit outside, but there were really many people. I went to the beach and lay down for two hours. The hotel's private beach has more than ten deck chairs and three hammocks, which is great! Then I went to the infinity pool on the 9th floor to take photos and check in (opens at 10:00). You need to buy a drink per person (¥35 per coconut) to enter. The water depth is 1.5m, which is a little scary haha. By the way, the hotel has five Swimming pool (central swimming pool, river swimming pool, children's swimming pool, beach swimming pool, rooftop infinity swimming pool).
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Grace again for helping us handle the late check-out at 13:00, and then made an appoin**ent for the airport bus at 14:30, so we went to the duty-free shop for a quick shopping trip from 13:00 to 14:00. It was so convenient! !
If you like hotel activities and duty-free shop shopping, you really shouldn’t miss his home. There is a side door of his home facing the entrance of the first phase of the duty-free shop, which is super close! ! ! ! !

The river swimming pool can be recommended to everyone to experience kayaking, and you can also take photos.

The day before I checked in, the hotel manager, Ms. Ella Chen, took the initiative to call me and asked about the number of people and age groups in our group. She also asked if we had any special requirements and took the initiative to add them. WeChat also posted a lot of travel and shopping guides. On the day of check-in, because we arrived a little early at noon and the room had not been cleaned, we went to the Chinese restaurant to eat first. Maybe it took a long time in the car. My father suddenly became flustered and had symptoms of collapse. I hurriedly contacted the housekeeper Ella Chen to explain that the situation was okay. She immediately took us to send the old man to the room to rest, and she was also busy. During the stay, Ella Chen was responsive to all requests. No matter what time it was, sometimes even 12 o'clock in the evening, she would reply as soon as possible and make proper arrangements. Because this time we were traveling with two elderly people who were in poor health. He is also the butler of all kinds of troubles. But I have to say that because of her attentive service, I not only visited the duty-free city, played in the water with my children, but also took the elderly to the 301 Hainan Hospital to get medicine, and also made an appoin**ent with friends from Hainan to gather at the hotel. , nothing was wasted, it was such a fulfilling vacation. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Ella Chen. I also hope that such excellent management talents should be reused in your hotel. Finally, I wish Minsheng Westin a prosperous future and a large number of guests. .

The Internet celebrity river channel is very beautiful! ! ! There is also kayaking available~
The only drawback is that it has nothing to do with the hotel.
The complimentary travel photography skills are mediocre, and the scenery of such a beautiful river is completely useless, and it only comes with a paper version. You have to buy it electronically, but after buying it, you find that the problem with the framing cannot be repaired. It's a bit of a waste of such a beautiful scenery. When you can take pictures, ask someone who is traveling with you to help take pictures together. It may be more beautiful! (P12 was taken by myself, haha, it’s so beautiful!)

I made a guide in advance and compared many five-star hotels in Yalong Bay with the Westin, and finally chose the latter, hoping to help my parents who are usually frugal. A different experience!
The overall experience this time was very good. The river swimming pool and infinity pool in the park are highly recommended. I took my parents to experience kayaking in the river swimming pool. In addition, the hotel's own beach is also very good, with fine sand and flexible coastline. The family likes to enjoy the quiet breeze. It is very pleasant to listen to the sea breeze and the waves. . .
Special thanks to the butler Damon for his sincerity and attentiveness. All questions were answered patiently and clearly as soon as possible no matter how late it was. All reminders and precautions, including all coordination appoin**ents, were arranged with every detail in place, especially during the Lantern Festival. The beach buffet helped arrange a particularly good location; and he also tried his best to upgrade the preferential trea**ent for my parents, which made my parents' experience even better, an unexpected surprise, and to be honest, I was very touched. . . His service quality reflects the "pattern" and "temperature" of Westin. Thank you again!

I give her a five-star rating. There are many entertainment items in the hotel, and they are all free in the package, unlike many hotels that require additional consumption. The playground is large, the staff are very responsible, and there is also a nightclub to play in. There are many pools and boating is fun. The beach has good sand and is a good place to close your eyes and meditate. The breakfast is sumptuous, and the beef noodles are so delicious that you have to queue up. There was a foreign band on the beach for dinner, and they sang very well. There is a walking path to the duty-free shop directly. In short, if you come to Haitang Bay in the future, this is your first choice to stay. It is very hands-free when bringing children.

msg:Minsheng Westin Hotel is located in Haitang Bay, next to the duty-free shop. The hotel will call you in advance to ask if you are bringing children and your arrival time. However, when I arrived to check in that day, no room was available. After waiting for 2 hours, I got tired of waiting and contacted Ctrip to report the situation. They called me within five minutes to say that a room was available. I was speechless. I advise you to be careful when choosing this restaurant, as they will meet people to order dishes.
When I checked in, I was told that I would be given a room upgrade, but at first glance I was given two rooms, one of which was a suite with a double bed in the living room. After refusing, the service staff said that I still needed to wait, and they didn't say how long I would have to wait. For a long time, that attitude simply looked like you couldn't help it.
It's your hotel's problem that the rooms are overbooked and it's your hotel's problem that the cleaning staff can't clean the rooms at designated locations. It's not our consumers who have to pay for these problems!
Advantages: Close to duty-free shops, free one-hour swimming lap and boating experience coupons upon check-in.
Lightning protection:
Hotel staff have poor service attitude and are treated differently!
The check-in efficiency in the hotel lobby is low, and the room cleaning is sometimes slow during holidays!
I would like to advise you to go to another bar if you are planning to bring your family with you. They really can't afford it. They will wait for 30 minutes at best, or put you in the water bar for 2 hours to cool you down. They won't tell you when they can give it to you. house!
Never come again, bad review!

If you go late on the first day, the food will be colder. If you go early on the second day, the food will be better. The travel photography was also very good.

1. The hotel has complete facilities and a beautiful environment. It is an attraction in itself. There is a beach and swimming pool on site, and free travel photography and paddle boarding are also highly recommended. Walk to the duty-free shop and 1.5km to Atlantis Aquarium.

2. What I want to say most is that the service here is super good. It feels like home. We stayed for four nights in a row and they gave us a handwritten welcome card. We were cleaned twice a day. There was also housekeeping service. Our housekeeping service Grace was very considerate and would They told us the weather, opening hours of hotel facilities, and common attractions in advance. They were like "know-it-alls" and all our questions were answered very quickly. What was particularly touching was that my husband suddenly suffered from appendicitis during our stay. We were all panicked. After Grace found out about it, she showed her concern as soon as possible and even brought us some rice porridge. Before leaving, the little kid missed the "little fruit" toy we picked in Sanya and cried all the way. Grace thoughtfully helped us with everything and finally returned the toy to the kid via express delivery, which made the kid happy.
The most important thing when traveling is to live well, eat well, and have fun, and make your family happy and your children happy. Westin is simply the best choice in Sanya. Especially when encountering unexpected situations, the service is in place and professional, which also calms our concerns. Anxiety and tension among foreign tourists.

Special thanks to Alla, the hotel housekeeper, for contacting us before departure and helping us upgrade our room for free, give us free fruits, and provide warm and detailed tips in a timely manner, allowing our family of three to have a perfect vacation.
The Westin Hotel has a beautiful environment with white sandy beach and clear water. The biggest highlight of the hotel is the paddle board pool ~ we played with paddle boards and canoes for three days, and both adults and children loved it. The second highlight is the infinity pool on the top floor, a great place to watch the sunset. The room is very spacious and well-equipped. Looking out over the sea from the balcony on the eighth floor is really refreshing. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and tastes quite satisfactory. It would be perfect if the hotel had a heated swimming pool. The water is still a bit cold in this weather.
The duty-free shop is right next to the hotel. It is very big and has many places to eat. The night view is nice.

msg:I come to Sanya often and stay in many hotels, but the Haitang Westin left the deepest impression on me this time. Everything is above your expectations. I would like to thank the butler Damon for communicating with me one day in advance, asking about my needs and personal preferences during the trip, receiving us gently and cordially, and proactively solving and coordinating various problems from the customer's perspective. You can completely relax. There is no need to worry or be embarrassed when enjoying your vacation. What can win over hardware is this kind of heartfelt service that cannot be standardized. This is also a careful management that cannot be measured by standard values. Talking about the hardware, the hotel is located next to the duty-free shop. It is very close door to door. It is convenient for eating and shopping. The hotel park is also very large. The beach is very clean. You can paddle board in the river. There are many children's activities to participate in. The gym is 24 Just swipe the room card every hour. Service staff will take the initiative to greet guests when they see them. Customer service process standards are implemented in place, and all guests come first. It would be better if the breakfast were richer. It is a very good hotel in Sanya. I will choose this hotel next time.

He went to the receptionist and asked us what we would like to do. 😂The most disgusting thing is that after finishing the meal, a big bug came out of the soup🐛! The hotel waiter said that because it is outdoor dining, it is normal to have bugs😓Okay! In the evening, the housekeeper arranged for a bottle of red wine costing 100 yuan to be delivered to the room. I didn’t understand what it meant! I just want to say it's disgusting!

The infinity pool on the top floor is also good for taking pictures.
There are plenty of children's activities in the hotel, making it suitable for parent-child travel and keeping you entertained all day long.
The most important thing is that the location is very good, close to the duty-free shop, and there are discounts and reservations, making shopping convenient.
Thumbs up for Damon’s service, helping to arrange rooms and introducing hotel information. Must like 👍🏻

As an old five-star hotel, it has complete supporting facilities, service details, and first-class service awareness! The hotel was full on the day of check-in, but the breakfast arrangement was very organized, and there was no confusion or waiting due to the large number of people. And Cassie, who received us, was able to solve any problems in a timely manner from the day we moved in to the time we checked out. She also took the initiative to ask us if we needed help every day. It was a great trip, thank you Westin, thank you Cassie👍

Check-in went smoothly. When we arrived at the hotel at three o'clock, the child immediately rushed into the Beiye Planet care class of the great children's parent-child player.
It was my first time to participate in this kind of paid care. The teacher was very enthusiastic and kind and took the children to climb coconut trees and pick coconuts. It was very unique. The children gave good feedback and said they would like to participate in the future. And adults are suddenly liberated and can go for a walk on the beach or shop at duty-free shops. It’s so cool!
The next day, I participated in the hotel's own travel photography "Manmo Image" and the experience was also very good. The appoin**ent process is simple and smooth, the photographer leaves on time and is very efficient. The river inside the hotel is beautiful, and the paddle boards or glass boats are really amazing. The shooting effect was good and the charges were relatively reasonable. I accepted the package directly and was super satisfied.
This stay was good in every aspect, cost-effective, and it was very close to Atlantis by taxi, but not noisy there. I loved it😊😊😊

On the day we took wedding photos, the considerate butler knew that we worked hard to take photos and specially sent coconuts. If you left something behind after checking out, you can just ask the butler to arrange it. The service is professional and in place. The most unforgettable thing for us was the night of my mother’s birthday on the 10th. Originally, there was no drone show on that day. Unexpectedly, the housekeeper had already greeted her a day in advance and recorded a "Happy Birthday" drone show, and also made a video. The number was sent to me in the evening. The video is also very good. The layout of the guest room is also very beautiful. The fruits arranged are delicious, but the time is too short. I will come back next time when I have time and give the housekeeper a thumbs up again!

These are all excellent, and the contrast in the breakfast is particularly noticeable🥲. I think the variety is sufficient, but the quality and presentation of the dishes are very lacking. Especially the Chinese fried food, hash browns, spring rolls, shrimp cakes, etc. smelled of oil consumption and were completely cold. I was quite disappointed. I don’t know if many of Hainan’s distinctive fruits are out of season or for some other reason. Types It's quite small and the taste is average. But I still love their hotel.

We chose Westin for our honeymoon without hesitation. We were informed in advance that Westin would arrive at the hotel earlier. When we arrived at the hotel before 12 o'clock in the morning, the front desk already informed us that the room was ready, which was very considerate. The room is arranged on the 8th floor, the highest floor of the hotel guest room, downstairs from the Starry Sky Bar.

msg:I took my mother to Sanya for vacation, and chose the Minsheng Westin where I had stayed at the company's annual meeting. The design of the Internet-famous river leading directly to the beach left a deep impression on me that year. Staying again, the river is still so beautiful, and the infinity pool is even more amazing. It takes 5 minutes to go downstairs to the beach, which surprised my mother. When I get up at 6:30 every morning, the first thing I do is go straight to the beach to watch the sunrise. Sitting on the soft sand of Haitang Bay and listening to the sound of waves rising higher and higher, my mood becomes much more relaxed! In addition to the convenience of going to the beach, there is a duty-free shop next door, and there is a special passage that leads directly to it in 5 minutes. It takes half an hour to walk to Atlantis, which is very convenient for shopping and food.
This time I also felt the attentive service of the hotel housekeeper. Amy took the initiative to add WeChat one day in advance to inform her of arrival and check-in, arranged a room with a great sea view, introduced the hotel's dining, entertainment, surrounding facilities, nearby night markets, etc. Fruit was delivered to the room as a gift and a return airport shuttle was arranged. If I had any questions, I asked Amy directly on WeChat. The reply was very prompt. The service was thoughtful and considerate, making my stay a pleasure!
Staying guests also have the opportunity to rent water play facilities for free for one hour every day. The package also includes the hotel's "Manmo Image" travel photography, so I arranged for my mother to take photos of the internet-famous river channel and the infinity pool on the top floor. The photographer was very professional and patiently guided my mother in posing, and the result was very good. I really couldn’t bear to delete any of the negatives, so I simply bought a travel photo package and took it all in one go, helping my mother fulfill her dream of taking photos!
This time I also tried the Chinese restaurant and Shuiting Beach Restaurant in the hotel. When there are not too many people, you don’t need to make a reservation at the beach restaurant. Just go there and ask if there is any space on the day. The taste is still very good. There are also many types of breakfast in the hotel, reflecting the five-star standard.
All in all, this stay left a deep impression. I will probably choose the Westin next time I come back.

During this trip, alla provided attentive service that exceeded expectations. His enthusiasm and professionalism made us feel warm. The infinity pool here is also a highlight. It provides an excellent view, but it is not heated, which is not good. The hotel's breakfast has a wide variety of options, providing tourists with a wealth of choices. The hotel's campus environment is very beautiful. The beauty of the park environment added a lot of color to our journey.

It is great for taking photos. The room is comfortable and has a spacious balcony. Separate, the Heavenly Bed is very comfortable, close to the duty-free shop, and shopping is very convenient. Damon's service is also very good. He helped arrange the room with a great view and a 270-degree view of the sea. It is worthy of praise.
During our stay, we made an appoin**ent with Manmo Image. The photographer was very patient and knew that we wanted to take a family photo of three people. He always made suggestions and styling. The photo of the three of us turned out great!

msg:⚠️Room: It is quite spacious. If it is next to the duty-free shop, it will be noisy! Because the air-conditioning exhaust hosts of several buildings are on that side! You can clearly hear the beeping sound of the big car reversing in the hotel at 11:00 in the middle of the night and 5:30 in the morning!
⚠️Service: The ladies in room service are very nice and hardworking! But wait for what the housekeeper wants to give you! Starting from 20 minutes, at least an hour! The communication is quite poor, and the service concept of not putting customers first is fully reflected!
⚠️Comfortable: That bed is so soft that it’s impossible to sleep on it! It’s so uncomfortable! There are bugs on the round bed in the parent-child room! That is really not a challenge that ordinary people can challenge! The parent-child room is actually arranged on the side near the duty-free shop! Speechless! The only cold drinks in the refrigerator are Coke 7-Up, Coke Zero and beer! A glass of milk costs 28 and a coconut costs 35!
⚠️Check-in: We informed in advance that there were pregnant women and children, and we had to wait for 1 and a half hours to check in! I asked about the check-in time and got a 3 o'clock reply. After communication, I checked in around 14:00!
⚠️Summary: During the stay, the service did make up for it, but it was not enough to eliminate the customer’s dissatisfaction during the stay! There are too many local five-star hotels! There is no best, only better! But it seems that Westin Sanya doesn’t think so and is very satisfied with their current business situation! But it is true that Sanya is a place where people will come even if you don’t come, and people will live in Sanya even if you don’t stay! This hotel specializes in corporate activities and is convenient for duty-free shopping. I really don’t recommend anything else! Especially with children... This hotel may have a misunderstanding about the concept of parent-child care. The rooms are not disinfected, cleaned after check-out, and checked in after check-in! Great!
This time I stayed with friends, and it was the first and last time... bye
What’s more classic is that among so many hotels, this is the only hotel where the housekeeper actively deletes customers’ WeChat accounts. Can you believe it? Stop creating stewardships. It’s hard for your employees!

First of all, the hotel is in a strategic location, with the 70,000-square-meter duty-free shop next to it, which is very convenient for shopping. Secondly, the hotel park environment is very beautiful, and you can take photos casually. The view from the room is also very good. The room facilities are complete, clean and tidy.

It was quiet and comfortable. Any problems during the stay were solved immediately. The hotel garden area is beautifully designed, and the river swimming pool is very good. You can also kayak and paddle board, and take photos. Very good. The hotel is fully equipped with catering, gym, and children's center. Overall, I am satisfied. I will come back again. I lost my handbag when I went to the garden to take pictures. Zhang Chaozhong (transliteration and Damon were both helping me contact me to find it) finally found it with the help of Zhang Chaozhong. I hope the store manager can add chicken drumsticks to the two friends. Damon and restaurant manager Liu Yong arranged Wenchang chicken rice and braised beef slices, and also arranged for two coconuts with logos to be delivered to the room. It was so warm. My mother was very satisfied with their careful arrangements! Five-star recommendation for taking the elderly and babies on vacation, I really love it.

msg:🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟I am very satisfied with this vacation experience. When I came to Haitang Bay before, I was attracted by Westin's famous river channel and its consistent service.
1. After this reservation is completed, customer service will contact me as soon as possible to inquire about the arrival time and make arrangements in advance;
2. When checking in, the housekeeper Cassie started to arrange the whole process, including the arrangement of children's entertainment programs, duty-free shop services, etc. After check-out, she was always caring and caring, so I must give CAssie six stars this time.
3. It is estimated that the peak season has not yet arrived. This time, on the premise that the room is sufficient, we upgraded to a villa room for free, which just solved some practical problems. The children upstairs and downstairs will not affect each other.
4. This time, I would like to praise Westin's considerate service. The weather is a little cooler and when swimming is not possible, the butlers set up a group to provide children's entertainment programs in real time, which is very considerate. This is a better service than other hotels, I highly recommend it.
5. Special thanks to the housekeeper Cassie for her concern throughout the whole process. She provided greetings in the morning, noon and evening, including room service, and was responsive to all requests. She was also able to explain other issues clearly.
I rarely comment on hotel services, but this time I need to take a moment to comment on all the staff at Haitang Bay Minsheng Westin, especially Cassie, the beautiful butler.
Attentive service, six-star praise, keep working hard, and make an appoin**ent with Westin next time👍👍👍👍👍

msg:Save money: Upgrade to cheat the full room. The air conditioner didn't cool down and it took a lot of time to change rooms. Customers who return visits are heartbroken when they say they can’t do it.

The Ctrip package I booked is 2,199 for a deluxe king room for 2 nights. Only this package includes a paddle board. Because when I went there in April, there was a hotel waste dump area under the window of the deluxe room, so I called the front desk and wanted to pay to upgrade the room type. The front desk told me that the deluxe sea view was fully booked that day, and asked me to book a premium sea view. I said that I could accept the supplementary fee of 360/ Night. After hanging up the phone, my husband said that luxury is still available. I found out that the room was not fully booked and felt cheated.
After that, the hotel housekeeper called me and I directly asked if I could upgrade. She said yes, so I upgraded to deluxe sea view for free and gave up the paid upgrade.
After checking in, the air conditioner in the room was very hot. Since we only had one weekend, we wanted to turn down the air conditioner and go to the duty-free shop first. When we came back, the indoor temperature was even hotter than the outdoor temperature. It took more than an hour to check and change rooms. Finally, Didn't change to a cooler room.
I arranged the place for breakfast, but after taking the things, I actually arranged them for someone else... This is really speechless. There is a little too much garbage in the hotel swimming pool area, but I really like the paddle board. Will come and stay here for the second time.
After returning home, another hotel manager contacted me to apologize. After saying that he would mail the best hotel to me, the address I gave him on November 22nd had not been received today on December 4th. To be honest, my husband and I didn’t really want a hotel. A gift is just an attitude. I didn't want to write a review at first, but now I think it's better to evaluate it objectively.

msg:This time we came to the Westin Hotel again. The hotel's river swimming pool is very unique. You can row and swim. It feels like swimming in the coconut grove. Our butler Amy Chen provided very attentive service and introduced hotel information. I helped arrange the room and prepared a lot of surprises.
Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities and equipment. The rooms are separated from dry and wet rooms, all have balconies, and the first round of drinks in the minibar in the room is free. This stay is overall okay, and I will come again.

msg:This time it was a parent-child trip (family room), with a 3-year-old boy (Tao), so you can imagine the difficulty! Choosing Minsheng Westin is firstly for LP shopping (exclusive channel leading to the duty-free city), and secondly, for children, there are different free parent-child activities every day (except for child care)! I was too lazy to move around with my baby and stayed for six nights in a row. The overall experience was pretty good. The hotel is close to the beach (sand digging tools are provided for free). You can go shopping on the beach and experience water entertainment such as paddle boards (travel photography is also good, if it is included in your group purchase). The butler parker has added WeChat to help arrange the room. Coordinate various activities with history, the software and hardware are good! Will come again if I have the chance!

msg:Let’s take a quick trip, Sanya is here for us.
I like the sea, so I booked the Westin Hotel in Haitang Bay because the hotel has the sea. I booked a deluxe sea view room (breakfast included). Before the person arrived, the beautiful butler Alla arrived on the phone and added WeChat for details. I sent an introduction to the hotel's services and the discounts in the duty-free city. We thoughtfully arranged a 9th-floor sea view room. The room was very large, 65 square meters. Standing on the balcony, you have a panoramic view of the hotel. In the distance is the sea, and diagonally opposite you can see the sailboat-shaped Atlantis Hotel. The oversized bathtub in the room is perfect for taking a bath. When you are tired from shopping, take a hot bath to relieve your fatigue. It is worth mentioning that after calling the front desk, disposable bath bags were immediately provided, which was convenient and hygienic and relieved worries about hygiene. It was absolutely considerate.
The room is clean and tidy, the bed and pillows are very comfortable, and the quality of sleep cannot be overemphasized. The housekeeper Alla also brought a fruit plate, which was great [ThumbsUp]
In addition to the ocean, the hotel is also separated from the Sanya Duty Free City by a wall. Shopping and eating are extremely convenient.
The hotel covers a large area and is equipped with a shuttle battery car that can go to the beach, lobby, and restaurant.
The hotel's breakfast is rich and varied, from 7:00-10:30. The time caters to the habit of young people who can’t get up. There should be applause [Clapping] here. The hotel has Chinese restaurant, Japanese restaurant, and open-air buffet restaurant.
It is also equipped with a children's playground, so parents with children can let their children play there without any worries.
It's off-season now, so there aren't many people. The environment of the hotel is quiet. The hotel's garden landscape design is unique, with coconut groves, green spaces, swimming pools, and villas cleverly arranged. Especially the big banyan tree in the middle of the swimming pool, with its lush branches and leaves, adds a touch of dark green to the blue swimming pool. Even if you go swimming at noon, you will not be afraid of the sun [Grin].
The hotel has 4 swimming pools. The largest swimming pool is connected to the river swimming pool where you can paddle board. These swimming pools do not have deep water areas. It is very safe to bring children to play. You can also rent big yellow ducks, swimming rings, life jackets, and waterproof in the service area on the shore. bags, and you can even rent pedal tandem bicycles. The swimming pool and river paddle boarding are one of the features of the hotel. There is also an infinity swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel. The hotel has a travel photography service. You can make an appoin**ent with the butler. Each photographer has different skills, so I won’t comment here.
Paddling in the swimming pool river, the sun shines through the straight coconut groves on both sides of the water on the clear water. The eyes are full of green, and I can't help but take a big breath. The coconut groves are reflected in the water, and the top of my head is like the snow-white cotton in the cartoon. The clouds in the water were drawn into circles of white ripples, adding a touch of agility to the tranquility. The beauties in bikinis on the paddle board were posing in various photo poses. The photographer kept pressing the shutter, and couldn't help but say "so beautiful" in his heart.
When we came to the seaside, we saw clean sandy beaches, endless light green, light blue to dark blue sea, and the waves were hit by the sea wind and slowly retreated to the shore.
People in twos and threes are scattered on the beach. A child ran towards the sea, his father chasing after him, and his mother behind him holding up a camera to take pictures. Young lovers held hands and chased the waves; a little girl dug sand from the shore, and her father brought water in a small bucket. We just walked on the beach, treading water. The beach on the shore was soaked by the washed up sea water and actually reflected
Blue sky, white clouds. Come and take a picture of the Sky Mirror, it’s very photogenic here. The waves were roaring, and seabirds occasionally flew by. Although the weather is still a bit hot and humid, you can feel the cool sea breeze from time to time. Lying on the comfortable beach chair, you are actually hypnotized by the sound of the waves.
The 4-day trip went by in a blink of an eye. As the saying goes, good times are always short.
In the past few days, we paddleboarded, swam, the sea breeze blew, stepped on the beach, visited duty-free shops, ate refreshments, took photos of the hotel, and left our footprints.
The beautiful housekeeper Alla thoughtfully helped to reserve the airport bus and also applied for an extended check-out. I am very grateful to her.
The pleasant and comfortable trip is over, see you next time at the Westin Haitang Bay...

msg:Entering the hotel, from the moment I parked my car, I could feel the meticulous attention of Sanya Minsheng Westin Hotel. Welcoming guests presented us with Hainan-style coconut carving pendants and the most distinctive welcome tea. The concierge staff will pick up our luggage as soon as possible and guide us to the hotel's front lobby. The enthusiastic reception staff will provide us with the most attentive service. Whether it is checking in or asking questions, we will receive patient and meticulous responses.

On the way to the guest room, we met the room attendants who all smiled sincerely, which made us feel warmly moved in our hearts.

Open the curtains in the guest room, and you can have a clear view of the sun, beach, waves, swimming pool and garden landscaping. Comfortable beds, spacious space and complete facilities create another warm home.

The hotel is close to Sanya Duty Free City, allowing our family to enjoy shopping while enjoying the sunshine and seaside. The hotel is closely connected with the 400-meter tropical rainforest river swimming pool. The garden design with small bridges, flowing water, and changing scenery with each step makes us feel surrounded by poetry and distance all the time. Afternoon tea at the infinity pool is even more comfortable, beautiful, and noble. In short, in Here, every shot randomly captured by the mobile phone is a poem or a painting, a check-in point that is so beautiful that it makes you cry.

We participated in the hotel's carefully planned parent-child activities, and we left wonderful memories while sharing joy. Here, children can exert endless energy in the fun-filled children's paradise; they can also show off their gifts and talents on various talent show stages; whether they are playing on the beach or playing in the swimming pool, It allows us to indulge in unparalleled moments of joy.

When night falls, the romantic and warm beach swimming pool sparkles charmingly under the stars. We also enjoyed a sumptuous dinner buffet, with hundreds of varieties to choose from, including seafood, Chinese and Western dishes, barbecue, fruits, drinks, and desserts, all top-notch delicacies on the tip of our tongues.

In this romantic, warm and fashionable resort, we enjoyed a wonderful time of 4 days and 4 nights that exceeded our expectations. The Westin Sanya Minsheng Resort will become the best memory in our family's life.

The most convenient thing is that it only takes 2 minutes to go to the duty-free shop, which is across the road. I stayed for three nights and spent two and a half days in the duty-free shop, buying everything I wanted to buy. There are also many restaurants in Zone C of the duty-free shop. When I checked in, the hotel front desk not only took the initiative to upgrade my room, but also readily agreed to my request for a late check-out. There was a waiter to help me carry my luggage when I arrived and left the hotel. So I highly recommend Westin!

It has been raining these days, and the housekeeper is very helpful in reminding me every day! The store is in a strategic location, next to the duty-free shop, only separated by a wall, very close. There is also a shuttle bus to the side entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient for going to the beach. There is a river swimming pool for boating, which is great for taking pictures. The hotel also has four buses to the airport every day. Just book it one day in advance. The hotel also has travel photography. The garden scenery is beautiful and very photogenic.

The suite I changed to was incomparably larger. During the three days and two nights in the hotel, I didn’t go anywhere except the duty-free shop right outside my door. I ate, drank, and slept. It was so comfortable.

Some of the activities we wanted to play were also available on this beach. ;The barbecue party and pool party in the evening bring countless happiness to the children!

msg:For travelers like me with children, I was quite satisfied with the Sheraton and Hilton hotels in Yalong Bay. It feels inappropriate to come to the Westin: next time there is no concierge to help push the luggage, I will push it myself; the lobby is not as open as other resort hotels, and it is not too conspicuous to find a chair to sit on; the entire garden is relatively large, but compared to the Hilton, It seems rather disordered, not refined enough, and has no organic unity and integration; the children's activity center is also passable, with no success or failure; the lounge chairs on the beach are relatively random and neglected to be tidied up, and there is no desire to lie down. The room was just fine, nothing special to say. The housekeeper Amy still did a good job and reminded more. Generally speaking, for people like me who are raising children, I personally feel that the comfort and intimacy are not as good as those of Sheraton and Hilton. I personally would not go there again.

msg:After landing in Sanya, we took the hotel bus to WESTIN in one stop. 🚌Only 7 people including the driver😹
When staying in a hotel, you will basically choose 5🌟. After all, the environment, facilities, and hygiene are all very important. My family and I are on vacation in hotels, so our requirements for hotels are relatively high.
The breakfast is very good, with many varieties. I just eat it every day and forget to take pictures😹
Key points♥️The hotel gym is very good, quiet, the equipment is new, and water and towels are ready
🏊The swimming pool is also clean. Because it was cloudy and rainy this time, there was no water.
Thank you to the housekeeper Sophin for your daily care, she is really considerate🫰I will choose Westin again when I come to Sanya again

There are two large beds in two rooms, so we can easily leave the children behind and sleep peacefully for a night. The hotel is very clean and a**ospheric, and the rooms are also very tidy. Children's bathrobes and toiletries are also specially prepared. Next to the hotel is the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, which is very convenient, and you can also take a sightseeing bus there, which is great news on a rainy day like today.

msg:My good impression of this hotel disappeared as soon as I entered the lobby. It was hot and humid, the check-in process was super slow, the system was chaotic, and my order could not be confirmed for a long time. The hotel actually requires a deposit for the room. Is this okay with a credit card? No, I have to pay 2000 to the hotel. What age is it? I'm speechless. I always have no deposit and pay when leaving the store. The hotel signage was not clear, so I got to the room by mistake. As soon as I opened the door, oh my God! 80s nostalgia? The decoration is old and lacks maintenance, the sanitary details are poor, the bedding, toilet paper, etc. are all in poor quality, and the quilt is very damp, which makes my back hurt when I wake up in the morning. Except for our butler Xiaoyu Parker, who was more enthusiastic, the lobby waiters were all indifferent. The catering depar**ent and room attendants are quite polite. The greening of the hotel is good, and the swimming lanes are also very long, but there is too much sediment at the bottom of the pool and it is so dirty that I dare not go into the water. The hotel buffet costs nearly 400 per person, and I didn’t see any of the dishes available. Is it just this frozen little green dragon? Regardless of breakfast or dinner, the air conditioning was not turned on, and we were all sweaty after eating. After dinner, I wanted to take a walk in the hotel, but the lights were dim and it was impossible to walk with a baby stroller. It was a huge safety hazard. Finally, I went back to the balcony of the room to enjoy the breeze~ The worst hotel I have ever stayed in at the same price, five stars? Do you want face? Blacklisted.

msg:The staff at the Westin Haitang Bay are very reliable.

The young man at the front desk is tall, white and handsome. He looks like the celebrity Ren Jialun. The check-in process is very smooth.

The maitre d's and waiters in the Chinese restaurant are also very reliable. They offer discounts and desserts if the food is slow in serving. They are very flexible.

The beef ramen in the breakfast room is really delicious😋. The soup base is delicious and the chili oil is flavorful. The ramen is strong and the cooking time is well controlled. Green garlic and coriander are rich in various ingredients. I ate one bowl on the first day and two bowls on the second day. The beef is particularly fragrant, and the more you chew it, the more fragrant it gets. Add chicken legs to the chef at this level🍗! ! ➕10 chicken drumsticks🍗.

The room attendant worked quickly and gave me a lot of mineral water. She said it was a hot day and asked me to drink more water.

There was a small problem with the air conditioner. The engineers from the engineering depar**ent quickly checked and solved the problem.

The food delivery guys are also great👍🏻

The housekeeper, Pepper, is very cute, taking care of us throughout the whole process, and is very considerate. Looks like a guest assistant.

The guy who drives the battery car in the yard is also very nice👍🏻.

It’s not just one or two employees who are reliable, it’s the entire team that is reliable.

Hotels like this are rare.

The hotel facilities are generally OK. Water sports are particularly abundant. The toiletries are useful, the slippers and the bedding are comfortable.

Three suggestions are:

1 Go from B1 to the beach restaurant. The road on the right is the road with many villas next to it. The lights are too dark at night and it is a bit eerie. It is recommended to ➕Light, ➕Brighten. It was really scary for me to walk there alone. (It was so dark that I got lost on the first day, so I didn’t dare to walk there alone. On the second day, I went to explore the way during the day, and went there for dinner at night. When I walked there alone, I still felt that the unoccupied villa area on the right was eerie.) When I came back, I walked from the left Came back on a sidecar. I don’t dare to go to the right anymore.

2. The ice cream at the beach restaurant in the evening could be better. Not enough milk flavor, too sweet, too sweet, lacking the mellow and layered texture of ice cream. Buffet desserts need a little more thought. The oysters at the barbecue stall are grilled slowly, so you have to queue up for a long time. Be generous and bake more at a time. (I suggest you go to the Fairmont Haitang Bay Hotel to learn the "pai noodle" and "generousness" of barbecue)

3. The papaya for breakfast should be peeled, but it was not peeled. For a hotel like the Westin, breakfast fruits, such as papaya, should not be served with the skin on. Even if it is washed, the skin should not be left on. I peeled it early on October 6th, and took the skin off early on October 7th.

Overall it's a good hotel. (over)

The swimming pool is designed as a river, and you can row and swim. It feels like swimming in the coconut grove. Went to the beach for a run in the hotel park, one lap was about one kilometer, it was very comfortable. The Westin is right next to the duty-free shop, so there is no need to queue for parking. It’s just a quick stroll away. Parking is free when staying at the hotel. It’s very convenient to rent a car from Ctrip at the airport.

Special praise to the hotel housekeeper Ella for her thoughtful service and timely handling of problems. Always very patient and meticulous. The breakfast is still very rich, and I feel full every day. Then I go out to play in the garden~~ I like it🏊. There is an infinity swimming pool on the roof, which is amazing, and swimming is also very refreshing. The btw gym is a 24-hour self-service facility with very good equipment and complete facilities for both exercise and fun.

The travel photos provided by the hotel are good, 5 photos per room, blockbuster quality. The store is right next to the swimming pool, called Manmo Image. I ordered makeup from two aunts for NT$99 each. The two aunts were very satisfied and the photos were beautiful. , you can choose additional photos by yourself, there is no forced consumption, and communication is smooth.

The last time I came to Westin was for my honeymoon. This trip was the last freedom of being pregnant at 6 years old. Overall, I was very satisfied. It left great memories for our family. We look forward to revisiting Haitang Bay again after the baby is born next year. , spend happy time~~

The housekeeper Ella actively contacted me before the trip started, gave me suggestions, and solved all my questions and answers immediately. There is a feeling of being cared for. The housekeeping staff Meng Xianmei who came to clean the room (I specifically checked the work ID card) really left a deep impression on me. She tidies the room neatly and meticulously, speaks softly and has a sweet smile. When I see her, I feel particularly cordial. The room manager Wen*li (I took a quick glance and didn't remember her full name) also came to the room and asked me about my stay experience and hoped that I could give my valuable opinions. I felt that she attached great importance to the guest's experience and needs. The service in the hotel is really disappointing. I always wanted to find the concierge guy who helped me carry my luggage on the first day but never had the chance. I really wanted to say thank you to him. By the way, don’t miss the hotel’s beach seafood buffet. There is a band performance and the food is very rich and delicious. After four nights of enjoyment, I couldn't bear to leave the Westin.

I believe many people are also rushing to stay at the Westin because of this, and shopping is very convenient. There is also a faint scent of Westin's characteristic white tea in the room ~ it smells very good. Lucy, the VIP receptionist at the hotel, is the housekeeper who received our stay. We contacted in advance, and the room was upgraded. Lucy responded very positively to everything during the stay and helped to solve it in a timely manner. , greatly improved the stay experience, my family and I stayed for another day✌️

msg:The environment is good, big, comfortable, and beautiful. The breakfast is rich. The facilities include a gym, swimming pool, and infinity pool. The hotel will also organize some workshops and activities for children. But the front desk service was average. When we checked in, the waiter gave us the room card directly after registration. He didn't say anything. He didn't tell us the breakfast time, wifi password, etc. He had to ask us before asking. The hotel is basically hygienic. Yes, but the swimming pool feels a bit dirty and feels a bit muddy and slippery when you step on it. I understand that the swimming pool is big and the water should not be changed very often.

The hotel provides free travel photography, including 5 7-inch photos + 1 photo frame, electronic files are $40/photo, and intensive photos are $60/photo. You can rent 2 sets of clothing for free in the photography studio (swimsuits, skirts, and props can be borrowed)

Booking on Ctrip, there is a shared car pick-up on the 5th domestic departure from the airport, which runs every half hour, but if you are in a hurry, it is not recommended to take it, because the car-pooling is for passengers from different hotels to share the car together. There are guests from Yalong Bay that day, so the car arrives first. We dropped off guests at Yalong Bay and went to Haitang Bay last, so it took us 1.5 hours to get to the hotel by carpooling. If we took a taxi from the airport, it would have taken us 40 minutes.

msg:Facilities: As a resort hotel in Haitang District, it has complete facilities
Hygiene: I am very satisfied with the hygiene of the room. Although it is not too new, there are no hygiene problems found!
Environment: The hotel environment is excellent. The rooms and balconies are very spacious and well designed! It's just that I didn't get a room facing the sea this time.
Service: Butler Cassie provides attentive service and responds quickly to any questions in or around the hotel! And on the first day of our stay, when we returned to the room after dinner, the room prepared sleeping essence for us, and slippers were placed beside the bed; in the afternoon of the second day, we prepared exquisite afternoon tea meals and fruits for the children, and there was fruit mousse after dinner. The children had no idea how happy they were when the cake was delivered to the room!
Cool Summer Adventure Summer Camp Theme Activities: Another important reason why I chose to stay at Westin this time is that their children’s summer camp has a lot of theme activities, and there are many suitable for older children, such as handmade wood products, cake making, and Surfing and paddleboarding learning experience, etc. My children are very satisfied with the arrangement of this activity!
Catering: The rooms we booked all include breakfast. The quality of the breakfast is pretty good. If you go on weekends or holidays, it is recommended to have breakfast before 9 o'clock. There are fewer people and you don't have to queue up, and the experience will be better!
For lunch one day, I chose the Japanese restaurant in the hotel. The quality of the food was good, relatively fresh, and tasted great!
For dinner, we chose the hotel’s seafood buffet restaurant, which is set in a garden near the beach and next to the swimming pool. It's better to go when it's not raining and sit in the sand area to dine, accompanied by beautiful singing. There are not many varieties of dinner, the taste is average, but the environment is better!
There is a duty-free shop right outside the side door of the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping! The night view is also super beautiful!
All in all, it was a great vacation experience! The price/performance ratio is also very high!

msg:Let's put it this way, this is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in in Haitang Bay. The price of 1,200 per night can only be accommodated on the 3rd floor or below facing the road (it is very noisy with cars). The room facilities are old and seriously aged, especially The front desk staff had a very bad attitude, as if you couldn't live here if you loved it. The package I bought included 6 items in the swimming pool, including a one-hour swimming ring. But when I went to swim, I was told that I had to pay to rent the swimming ring. It’s also very bad. Can you imagine that a five-star hotel provides a swimming pool and has to pay to use it? In terms of cost performance, it is not much better than Haitang Bay. In terms of service, there is almost no service. It is said that the sea view room is actually far away from the sea. If you feel bad, go to the front desk and report that there is no room change. This attitude is really bad. The face of a five-star hotel has been lost by you.

Service: Maybe it’s because all aspects are good, so there are quite a lot of people living there. It’s too late to get a room. I can only go to the duty-free shop for a walk. Later, I took my luggage to get the room card at four or five o’clock. You have to walk a long corridor to get there, and the feeling here is not good. There is a room card that I can’t swipe when I come back at night. Fortunately, my family is there, or I have to go a long way to the front desk. In addition, at breakfast the next day, the younger sister actually said that someone has already visited my room. Fortunately, another level is higher. A little girl said to let the guests eat first, which is not a good place... All in all, it is a five-star hotel, but it is not recommended in peak season, and it may exceed the reception capacity and cause a decline in experience.

It's all about the butler's dealings
If you have any questions, go to the front desk. They either have a bad attitude, ignore you, or look down on others. The personnel management is very chaotic, and the information is not handed over in a timely manner.
A woman who was feeling unwell and on her period asked the hotel if she could send sanitary napkins upstairs. The front desk said very forcefully that she must go down and buy them herself.
When I first checked into the hotel, I asked the front desk if there were any high floors to choose from. He looked down on you and told me that the high floors were all suites. As a couple, if we can’t live in a suite, don’t we deserve to have a high floor with a good view?
I think the service in a five-star hotel is unqualified. There is no basic sense of respect for customers. This stay is very disappointing.
I hope the hotel will improve in the future.

msg:This Westin experience was very bad. 1. The package voucher I bought, the room I was given had to be suspected to be Ctrip**. The room was on the same floor as the lobby on the second floor. The room faced the Duty Free City. I have to say that there was an unpleasant feeling of being dismissed and discriminated against. This time I booked a total of three rooms, one of which was a package with the same price on a certain pig, and that package was for a sea view room on the fifth floor. Ctrip should really hold the hotel accountable, why do you always give your guests such poor rooms. When I checked in, I asked the three rooms to be arranged together as much as possible, but was rejected indifferently. 2. Check-in was very slow, and I didn't know what the front desk was doing. It took more than an hour to complete the check-in procedures. During the period, the so-called butler seemed to provide considerate service to the guests, but in fact it was useless to scan the code and disturb. In the end, after repeated urging, I barely gave a room at 4:30, and got all three rooms around 5:00. Too unfriendly to bring a baby. Since the hotel does not allow early check-in, at least it should clean up the room at 3 o'clock according to the rules and allow people to check in! Our kids are waiting for the room to sleep. 3. The hygienic situation of the hotel is worrying, especially the swimming pool area, which looks very unpleasant. I don't know what's the problem. After leaving the hotel, my baby's hands and feet were severely peeled, and the old wounds of my old man were also eroded and peeled. 4. The breakfast is generally not as good as the Grand Hyatt next door, the stir-fried dishes in the Chinese restaurant are not good, and the buffet dinner is not good. 5. The travel photography experience is not good. The three groups of us are supposed to take three hours of travel photography. We have relaxed the requirements and let the photographer only shoot for one hour. However, despite this, the photographer showed extreme behavior when faced with taking pictures of my elderly. The big one has no interest and patience, and is extremely perfunctory. Five copies of the paper version will be sent for travel photography, and 40 copies will be charged for the electronic version. 5. After check-out, the butler chases you to ask for a five-star praise. This is the first time I have stayed in so many hotels in Sanya.
In short, it is not recommended to bring a baby, it is suitable for people who want to take good photos. When the weather is good, the tropical rainforest river paddle board and the rooftop infinity pool are still very popular.

msg:I came to Sanya and stayed in four hotels with different prices, including Atlantis. The overall feeling is the Westin Minsheng Hotel. If you choose a hotel with the same price, it is strongly recommended to stay at Minsheng Westin Hotel. The hotel shuttle bus can take you to the back door of the duty-free shop at any time, and you can walk to the door of the duty-free shop in 5 minutes, saving you the time of taking a taxi or taking a bus. Before checking in, I had a phone conversation with the staff of Manmo Image. The shooting scene chose the hotel's characteristic scene Amazon river and infinity pool. For those of us who are not very good at taking pictures, the photographer will also patiently remind us how to swing to find the angle . The effect of the film is very satisfactory, and it has drawn a successful conclusion to our trip to Sanya. Looking forward to staying again.

msg:The Westin Hotel is the first stop in Sanya this time. It gave us a good start to our vacation life. The children like it very much.

The hotel is right next door to the Duty Free City. It is very convenient to walk through the side door from our room.


Environment: The shadows of the coconut groves are whirling, the water in the pool is clear, follow the path beside the waterway, walk past the beach restaurant, and you will reach the beach. Westin put a lot of beach chairs by the sea, very considerate. The infinity pool on the top floor has a beautiful view, and the photos are very good.

Service: The quality of the service staff is very good and makes people feel very comfortable. Whether it is dining or children's activities, everyone takes the initiative to ask for needs and provide help enthusiastically. Special praise to my housekeeper, Xu Mingran, who is not only handsome, but also very careful. He introduced to me the hotel activities in detail, arranged room items, sand digging tools and water guns for children to catch crabs. They were all given by the housekeeper hahaha, thank you .

Activities: There are many activities in the hotel, and there are still many interesting activities that I have not had time to participate in. The activities of Beiye Planet can be free for parents and children, or they can be hosted for a fee. There are performances at the beach restaurant at night. It is worth mentioning that the drone flight performance, 500 The drones form various patterns, which is too spectacular.

All in all, this Westin makes people immediately switch to a relaxing vacation mode, and the children are also reluctant to part with it, super satisfied.

During the summer vacation, check-in is slow, and breakfast needs to be queued, but the service can keep up. The air conditioner in the room needs to be updated and maintained. After so many years in the hotel, the infrastructure and bedding are really old, and they should be replaced with new ones! The increase in income from holiday tourists to the hotel should be enough for the hotel to update the bedding, which is more conducive to the long-term development of the hotel and attracts more guests to choose to stay!

Although there will be a little episode in the middle, the attitude and service of the hotel made me experience that this hotel is worth choosing. The balcony of the hotel faces the sea. The parent-child room is very comfortable, and the children don't have to sleep in the middle. The hotel's butler, Maddie Wheat, is very enthusiastic and provides good service. Every day, she will ask me what arrangements I need, and she will contact me immediately if I have any needs. There are shuttle buses from the hotel to the beach and the duty-free shop (it's so cool next to the hotel), and the shuttle bus will arrive as soon as it is called. It was a little uncomfortable because of the queue jumping at breakfast the next day, and the response was good.

Okay, according to the hotel’s rules for checking in after 15:00, since we arrived early, we should wait chant! The lobby is really hot, and the hotel didn't provide iced drinks to the guests waiting to check in. That's all. I waited until 15:00, and no one informed me whether the room was packed. If I didn't ask at the front desk, I guess you Wait another hour and no one will talk to you! The hotel's butler service is useless, no one cares if you don't ask, and the room is available as soon as you ask. After entering the room, the room location, balcony view, and appliances and facilities are basically satisfactory. The hotel's room hygiene service is provided once in the morning and evening, which is commendable! The hotel's breakfast has fewer varieties and less taste. What's even more surprising is that the breakfast varieties on the two days are exactly the same, which is completely inconsistent with Westin's brand image and grade positioning! The breakfast is not even as good as the ordinary four-star and five-star hotels in downtown Sanya! Having dinner at the hotel's Chinese element restaurant, flies kept flying around the dining table, and the dining environment instantly became a street food stall! The hotel's beach is wide and flat, and it should have been specially leveled. It feels very good to play and walk on the beach! In short, the experience of staying at Westin for two days was very average, far below expectations, and I probably won't stay here again when I go to Sanya in the future.

I didn't think about taking a taxi. It was a bit difficult to walk back. I found a passage the next day. . Yes, when checking in, it was not reminded that the first floor is a swimming pool, the first floor leads to the beach, and the first floor has a passage to the duty-free shop. It was not reminded that you can take a sightseeing bus when traveling in the hotel. It's better to tell these little things, I think. Overall, I still recommend this hotel.

msg:It has become a habit to come to Sanya once a year in June
The reason for staying at Weistin is
1. It is within walking distance to the largest and most popular duty-free shop in Sanya. Every year on 618, I want to buy it~ June is also the off-season price when the hotel room rate is relatively good
2. It has the longest swimming lane among the five-star hotels in Sanya, and it is a super production. The travel photography service in the wine is professional, and the photographer is professional. I recommend Brother Lin who is cute, amiable, good at directing, and good at filming. He is also very professional in film editing. He will listen to personalized opinions from the group alone.
3. There are paddle boards to play. Some room packages include free 1 hour. If you pay for 1 hour (100 yuan), the water is not deep, and anyone who can’t swim can play
4. The room has a high floor height and a large area. There are many new hotels in Bialong Bay and Dadonghai, and the price performance ratio is very high
5. Every waiter is very polite and greets you with a smile
6. Ella Chen, the housekeeper, is almost responsive to every request! Very caring and thoughtful! love her very much [love]
7. The breakfast is rich, and the outside view is very good
8. Self-driving parking lot 🅿️ There are enough parking spaces, and the elevator goes directly to the lobby, so it is very convenient to enter and exit

I will come again next year~

Superb resort hotel;
First of all, the housekeeper Alla contacted me one day in advance to ask if there was any need for the room, because it was a honeymoon, and the honeymoon room was specially arranged. The butler service is really super patient! ! Alla people are super super invincible! ! When I asked about my itinerary needs, she tried to arrange it as much as possible! The service staff are very enthusiastic ❤️

Then talk about the hotel facilities, which were renovated before the epidemic, and they are still very new! The hotel's infinity swimming pool is super good for taking pictures of the sea view! The gifted travel photos are great! It is recommended to stay in the hotel directly, as there will be many hotel facilities that you cannot experience when you go to scenic spots. After breakfast in the morning, ride a bicycle at the hotel, and then go rowing on the Internet Red River. After lunch, go swimming in the infinity pool, and watch the sea in a daze. In the afternoon, go to the beach to watch the sunset, and go directly to the hotel's beach barbecue for dinner. There is a band singing, and the a**osphere is directly full!

As long as you come to Sanya in the future, you will live here!

What a pleasant surprise! The next day, I accidentally soiled the bedding of the hotel due to some small accidents. I didn’t know what to do. The housekeeper immediately helped to contact Jenny, the room manager, to solve the problem. In the end, the cleaning fee was waived. Thank you very much 🙏, next time When you come to Sanya, Westin must be the first choice!

There is an insect wing on the bed, the swimming pool is not clean, and it is far away from the beach. I personally think the layout of the hotel floor is a bit messy. There is no living room in the suite, and there is a bedroom when you open the door. The secondary bathroom is invincible and cannot take a shower. The size is about the same, the price of 2900 per night is 500 more expensive than MGM, but it is indeed much worse in all aspects, and I will not come again.

Westin's butler service is worthy of recommendation and praise👍Actually, except for the butler service, the employees of Westin's various depar**ents are very active in their work.

msg:The Westin Haitang Bay Hotel is only separated by a wall from the Sanya CDF Duty Free City. It has an exclusive passage and is within walking distance to the duty free city for shopping and dining, which is very convenient.

The butler Parker took the initiative to contact me the day before check-in and sent me a map of the hotel and related facilities, which was very considerate. The hotel has complete facilities, nice garden landscape, large and numerous swimming pools, and more user-friendly services.

The two-bedroom suite I booked this time has a large balcony and a good view of the sea and hotel. There are two bedrooms, two large beds, two bathrooms, a shower room, and no separate living room. This room type should be converted from a one-bedroom suite. The original living room was converted into a bedroom. The room is quite large and retains a couch and a dining table for four, which is enough to satisfy a family of four on vacation. The only drawback is that the bedroom transformed from the "living room" lacks a power outlet at the bedside, making charging at night a bit inconvenient. It is recommended to provide a power *****.

The breakfast in the hotel is rich in variety, especially the freshly stretched beef ramen, which is an unexpected surprise. There are many people at breakfast and there is no executive lounge/breakfast room. The all-day menu at the hotel's western restaurant is quite satisfactory. The Chinese restaurant offers Cantonese and Sichuan cuisine, both light and hot, and the beef tendon Mapo tofu is recommended.

I am very satisfied with my stay this time. It is the only designated hotel in Haitang Bay. The pictures I took are more beautiful than the official pictures, so I won’t post them.

The hotel swimming pool is so big that adults and children can have fun. The most beautiful one is the infinity pool. The hotel's Coconut Grove Beach is also super beautiful, and it's beautiful to take pictures casually. The hotel not only has a beautiful environment, but also better service. I added the official WeChat before check-in. During the stay, the official Grace has always given us enthusiastic service and helped us a lot. On the day of leaving the store, a friend forgot his mobile phone, hurried to the room to get the mobile phone, got on the bus in a panic and left the suitcase in the lobby. I hurriedly contacted Grace, who helped us take our suitcases to the airport with the taxi driver. thank you very much! Must like!

The hotel has rich food and beverages, a buffet, close to the beach, and a good a**osphere with band performances. The location of the hotel is great. There is a fast track in the park to go directly to the duty-free shop. You can walk there in 5 minutes. You can also make reservations for discounts and receive cash vouchers in advance. The overall stay this time is very good, and I will check in Westin next time.

I really like the hotel's swimming pool and river scenery, but it's a bit far from the beach. I went to the beach once after staying for two days. The hotel is relatively Big, I was a little lost at the beginning😅, there were a few signs, even though I stayed for two days, I still didn't have time to travel and take photos. At first I thought that the other party would contact me, but then I contacted me and missed the WeChat reply. I didn't have time on the last day, unfortunately. Next door is the Duty Free City, which is very convenient. Some of the temporarily booked rooms are not well thought out, leaving some shortcomings. Overall, it was a good experience. Good breakfast!

Empty and packed black garbage bags, but the hotel is really big, with 20,000+ steps per day, playing paddle boards in the river rainforest is a feature, and there are many people staying, but the hotel park is too large, it seems empty, and you can always find a place It belongs to your own location, and there are obviously more playgrounds for children than Wanning.

I think this kind of service attitude and quality is what I need to live in a five-star hotel. , a lot of staff clean and maintain, but I just think that the last thing that really attracts me to this hotel is the butler hahahahahaha, I really like this butler, he has his own domineering, everything is arranged for you clearly!

The duty-free shop is also very close to the hotel, just across the road from the side door of the hotel is the duty-free shop. The experience of staying this time is quite good, and I look forward to the next stay.

The check-in process was very fast, and we checked in at 12:00 noon. The room was clean and hygienic, the temperature was suitable, and I felt very comfortable. The little sister Zhang Tiantian in the hotel is beautiful, speaks amiably, asks for advice actively, and provides convenience for us to check in and travel, making us feel at home!

We came to check in late, and the service staff needs to be increased. After checking in, there were some problems with the room, and the bathroom door leaked. The faucet is also leaking, the facilities are a bit old, it is recommended to renovate. Fortunately, after the housekeeper found out, he changed the room the next day. The service is worthy of recognition. The location of the hotel is superior, next door is the Duty Free City.

There are two deep and shallow swimming pools hidden inside, and a mini canal about one kilometer long. The shallow pool is a paradise for children to play in water. Most of the guests come to walk their babies. There is a pair of twins, and the proud father revealed to me that they conceived this pair of babies here, and this is their blessed land. What I enjoy is boating on the canal, and the scenery on the water is much more wonderful than walking. Standing in the outer corridor of the high-rise hotel at night and looking at the adjacent duty-free city, it is beautifully decorated by the lights.

msg:If you are traveling with a baby and want to relax and spend most of your time in the hotel, you are right to choose westin!
From the outside, it is located in Haitang Bay. It takes about ten minutes to walk to Guofang, and it is also very close to 68 Food City and Atlantis by car. The environment is very good;
Secondly, let’s talk about the interior, there are free parking spaces and charging parking spaces; the room layout is my favorite among hotels of the same class/level, the cloakroom is equipped with an iron and ironing board, there is a children’s care set specially prepared for babies, and the bathtub is very big for babies You can play in the bathtub for a long time; the public supporting parts are also great, the hotel has its own children's entertainment area, coconut grove swimming lane, kayaks, beach pool and beach, the water quality is clean and the landscape is beautiful; the infinity pool on the top floor is very beautiful to take pictures, one day in advance I made an appoin**ent, I ordered an afternoon tea set for two, and when I went, the waiter reminded me that I can just spend whatever I want; I only left the hotel three times in four days, and I spent 90% of the time in the hotel area, and I feel that I can still play Five, six, seven, eight days; I also thank the vip housekeeper Ella, who sent a lot of food and play strategies before we set off. Some of the needs I mentioned about the room were also adjusted for you and the room type was upgraded for free. Help to make various reservations~
A little shortcoming: the variety of Chinese food in the buffet breakfast is a bit too small, and it is not "authentic" enough. The time is 7:00-10:30, but at 10:40 the waiter starts to quickly take away everything, which is very embarrassing... If you prepare for 10:40 It is more reasonable to just collect things than to change the breakfast end time to 10 o'clock.
Overall, I am quite satisfied with this stay, and I will come again~

The beach connected to the hotel is very beautiful with fine sand. The hotel is also very close to the duty-free shop, which is suitable for friends who want to shop. The only thing is that the hotel's shower room and bedroom are connected, which feels like a lack of privacy.

Whether it is the room, the garden view, or the seaside, the hotel is perfect. The swimming pool is designed as a river, and you can row and swim. It feels like swimming in the coconut grove. Running in the hotel park to the beach, one lap is about one kilometer, very comfortable. There is also a big advantage, it is next to the duty-free shop, there is no need to queue up for parking at all, and you can stroll around until the door closes, and go back to the hotel.

Customer Relations Ella is very thoughtful. She helped upgrade the room type and dealt with problems in a timely manner. She has always been very patient and meticulous.
I accidentally discovered that the hotel has paddle board yoga on Saturday morning. It was really a good experience, balance + core intensive training, and the beautiful teacher also helped to take hundreds of photos.
Such a beautiful hotel really needs to arrange a travel shoot. The travel shoot in the Westin Hotel - Manmo Image is very good. My photographer Alin took pictures in about 45 minutes and took five scenes of two sets of clothes. Zhang Zhang They are all blockbusters, and the two pictures that accompany the pictures are finished films that have not yet been published, which will draw a successful conclusion to this trip to Hainan!

You can also choose to have the concierge delivered to the side door, just across the road. The hotel environment is still very good, especially the river pool and infinity pool. It is suggested that the hotel can have a detailed list of hotel facilities and so on at the front desk. If there is a butler, the butler will help to introduce it. If there is no butler, wouldn’t it be ignorant of everything, and I will continue to come back next time👍

I really didn't have any unreasonable demands, just a regular check-in, and they did business with a black face! When I was done and asked them the route, my eyes almost rolled to the sky! The answer is also fast and whispered! They seem to answer you but can't hear a word! Ask again, the tone is even worse! too disgusting! It's the same in the hotel!

It is also very close to the duty-free shop, so you can go shopping at any time. However, the cleanliness of the room is mediocre. The sand and soil on the balcony were not cleaned up after several days of stay, and the cleaning of every corner of the room was so-so.

It is very convenient for shopping and eating. The river swimming pool in the hotel can be used for kayaking. It is a good experience. Thanks to the butler hannah for his enthusiastic service, he will take the initiative to ask about the needs, and if he accidentally scratches his foot, the staff will send a band-aid immediately. The overall scenery of the hotel is quite beautiful, especially the green plants on both sides of the river pool and the coconut groves on both sides of the road to the beach. It is also very close to the beach by walking. Catch up with the Lantern Festival there, and experience the beach barbecue buffet at Shuiting restaurant, which is full of a**osphere. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is not bad. It was my first trip after Yangkang, and I stayed for three nights in a row. Except for shopping in duty-free shops, I basically stayed in the hotel to eat, drink and have fun. I didn't feel bored. All in all, it was a good experience. What is a little lacking is that the room may be a bit old after being decorated for a long time, and the facilities and supplies are quite satisfactory. The Hansgrohe shower is very comfortable, but the quality of the toilet needs to be improved.

The bed in the hotel is very soft. I personally prefer a harder bed. After asking her, she also helped the front desk to add a bed board for me. I slept very comfortably. A similar level of service can only be experienced by the private butler of St. Regis Macau . On the whole, this place upholds the consistent style and standard of Westin, coupled with the location one step away from the duty-free shop and the thoughtful butler, it is indeed one of the best choices in Haitang Bay.

Besides hygiene, what does it mean that there are band-aids in the bathroom? Is the glass broken? You just fix it with Band-Aids? If the glass isn't broken, is it the last guest who posted it? You keep it for me to tear it myself?
Let’s talk about food and drink. I only ate the buffet at Shuiting restaurant. There was nothing there. No one even came to check the coupons. I didn’t rush to make the food. The fruit was not updated until I finished eating. It’s worth more than 300 per person. .
Besides the service, I understand that during the epidemic period, we don't take the initiative to clean, but I just ordered a takeaway to replenish some water, and no one came to get it for a few hours. I asked for a paper draw at night, and no one delivered it for an hour. I was really convinced. How bad is your waiter? basically no service

My friend wanted to go to the duty-free shop, so I chose the Westin in Haitang Bay. After booking with Ctrip, the butler Damon contacted and added WeChat for one-on-one service, which felt very considerate. When checking in, Damon chose a nice room for him, and gave a comprehensive introduction to Westin's various services, professional!
Minsheng Westin is next to the CDF duty-free shop. From the side door on the first floor, you can go directly to the side of the duty-free shop (not the main entrance). It takes about 5 minutes away, which is really convenient. The restaurant with Chinese elements in the hotel tastes good. The set menu recommended by the waiter is economical. The outdoor seating by the water is excellent. The swimming pools are all open. There are not many people and it is very comfortable. The river pool and the infinity pool are especially worth checking in. Many young ladies are checking in to take pictures. It is indeed very popular.
In the evening, there is a band performance at the Shuiting restaurant on the beach, a bottle of Corona or red wine, a pleasant life! There are also food courts and seafood restaurants around the hotel, especially the coconut chicken in the mangrove forest, which is definitely worth having. The hotel has a shuttle bus to the airport every day, you can book it in advance, it takes about 45 minutes by car.
Finally, I would like to thank the handsome guy Damon again for allowing us to have a comfortable weekend at the Westin. Minsheng Westin is the most cost-effective hotel in Haitang Bay. Next time we come to Sanya, we may choose Minsheng Westin.

The housekeeper, Candy, took the initiative to add WeChat after she checked in, to communicate with various needs in a timely manner, and to notify nucleic acid information. Thank you very much for your care for a few days, and I plan to continue to stay.

The whole process is a butler service, and the messages are answered in seconds. I can consult any questions. During the stay, I also upgraded the room and delayed check-out. The service is perfect. The only complaint about the breakfast is that there are not enough items, and it is understandable that there are few people now.

If you don’t want to walk, you can also take a battery car to the side door. There are quite a lot of swimming pools. At a glance, they are all swimming pools and trees, especially the river. The swimming pool is very beautiful. When I stayed at the hotel this time, the cute butler service at the hotel’s VIP reception was great. You can contact her at any time if you have any questions during your stay. The breakfast is also very rich and healthy. It is very close to the sea and the beach. The infinity pool is an online celebrity check-in point. The overall stay is satisfactory, and I will stay again and contact Mengmeng.

Amy, the young lady at the VIP reception, took care of us in every possible way and was very considerate. If you need anything, you can tell the housekeeper to help you. It’s really great. The temperature in Sanya this season is just right. You don’t need to worry about suffocation and you don’t need to wear a coat at all. It’s the best time for vacation and leisure.
The room is cleaned by service staff every day, and the hotel is quite big. You can go to the swimming pool and the beach for a walk, which is very comfortable. During the period when the epidemic is relatively repeated, the hotel arranges nucleic acid every day, and the housekeeper will notify you as soon as possible. Really remind nice! ! !

msg:1. Overview | Overview
The holiday is limited this time, I only came to Sanya for a few days, and chose to stay in Qingshui Bay and Haitang Bay for one or two nights each. In less than half an hour by car from Qingshui Bay, the hotel is next to the duty-free shop, just one door away.
The building of the hotel imitates the bird's nest style, and it is mainly white and looks elegant and generous. The hotel is adjacent to the Duty Free City, and it is very convenient to have an exclusive passage to walk directly there.
Before check-in, Hannah, a hotel lady, added WeChat to communicate in advance. This is much better than the previous Raffles. From check-in to check-out, there is no human touch.
At that time, I didn’t notice that Westin’s swimming pool suites were all double bedrooms, which belonged to the sub-top-level room type below the villa. They said they hoped to upgrade. I don’t know if it scared them. However, the young lady helped arrange a two-bedroom suite with sea view. After reading the forum, it was the best room type within the normal upgrade range, and I was very satisfied.

2. Guest Room | In Room
Westin's two-bedroom suite is different from the conventional two-bedroom suite. It has an extra bed in the living room, which is more suitable for families with two children. It is good if you can live in this room type when you bring a beast. The bedroom is decorated for a honeymoon, and there is a little Westin tortoise doll on the bed in the living room.
Compared with the Raffles Clearwater Bay Suite I stayed in a few days ago, the Westin Suite is only half the size, but I think it is more appropriate to update the room. The Raffles Suite is a bit silly.
The room is well maintained, the curtains are all electric, and the living room and bedroom are connected to a large balcony. It is very pleasant to lie on the balcony chair at night and enjoy the sea breeze and drink some wine.
The welcome fruit is definitely much better than the business hotel. Although there is no expected coconut, maybe if you stay for five nights and upgrade to titanium gold, you may have coconuts.
Because it was a third-party reservation, I couldn't choose points. I chose red wine and snacks, and I also gave a small plate of fruit, but the wine and the fruit didn't have time to move. Another eight bottles of soft drinks are free in the room.

3. Catering | Dining
Due to time reasons, I only had breakfast at the hotel, with freshly squeezed juice, which I personally think is quite rich in Westin.
In order to take pictures at the infinity pool on the top floor, I bought a drink for 30 yuan. However, this kind of upstairs swimming pool has relatively few settings for charging guests, so let's think of it as a self-operated bar with a swimming pool.

4. Facilities | Facilities
In particular, I would like to praise the hotel's swimming pool. In addition to the central large swimming pool surrounded by the main building, there is also a swimming lane extending to the beach area.
In addition, the hotel also prepared a happy gift package, including 1 hour of bicycles, 1 swimming lap rental, and 1 kayak, so that people like me who can't swim can enjoy the fun of swimming.
The hotel has a lot of children's facilities, but it's not a holiday yet, there are no children, it feels like a quiet vacation.
The beach is relatively ordinary, and the sand is slightly thicker.
5. Unforgettable moments | the Moments
Entering the hotel, you can see many young ladies in white clothes, guiding guests at the front desk, very considerate.
Thanks to Miss Hannah for her arrangement, helping to upgrade the room and late check-out.

6. Summary | Conclusion
In the current off-season, for Marriott Platinum and above members, the price is only 1,000 yuan+. If you add Q3+ flash promotion, the actual cost may be only about 700. Sanya government consumption coupons can also be used for third-party bookings from Ctrip. The price/performance ratio is very good High.

msg:I will step on the pit of spending money, don't let everyone get slaughtered!
1. The hotel needs to pay for nucleic acid at its own expense. Those who have stayed at InterContinental, Mandarin, and Park Hyatt are all free nucleic acids for a limited time every day. According to the comrade Hao Yitong of the hotel, the government does not give them free nucleic acid. In order to better serve the guests, the hotel cooperates with a nucleic acid agency, and "deliberately" arranges a 15-yuan nucleic acid for the hotel guests (Sanya). The latest nucleic acid charging standard, the maximum is not more than 15 yuan)! I asked him again why other people's hotels are free of nucleic acid and the basis for the price of 15 yuan. The Ms. Hao Yitong asked me, "Does nucleic acid have anything to do with your stay in our hotel?" In order not to affect my mood, she was still willing to "please I make nucleic acids"! Thanks to the hotel for letting me experience the nucleic acid with the highest price and the worst service attitude in Sanya.
2. In the elevator, I overheard a guest asking about the rooftop swimming pool. For the first time, I also heard that the hotel's supporting facilities need to be charged extra to the hotel guests! It is recommended that the management of your hotel carefully consider whether to add the "breathing air fee" to the guests during their stay! After feedback on the swimming pool, they told me that the price is not expensive, just more than 20 yuan to buy a coconut, and also said that it can give me "free of low consumption". I do not need!
3. One side of the hotel is under construction, and the other is close to a large construction site, which seriously affects the check-in experience, and there is no prompt until entering the room
4. Ctrip reservations, including the hotel’s official announcement that there are 2➕1 buffet dinners, only when we arrived at the store did we tell them to change to an “equivalent package” because of the “epidemic”. The funny thing is that groups can contract small buffets! The on-duty manager of the hotel surnamed Li told me that "there is no self-service, only a set menu. If you don't choose, you can exercise my right (love it"). The restaurant staff told the hotel that it was a quarantine hotel before. Because of the loss of money due to the epidemic, there has been basically no self-service since November 11, and the hotel only needs to do nucleic acid after replying to me, even if there is no self-service due to the epidemic. But the pages of Ctrip and Westin still use this as a publicity stunt to attract customers.
5. The replenishment of breakfast dishes is lagging behind, the temperature in the restaurant is high, there are many mosquitoes, and there are many mosquitoes in the room. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and the bugs that Westin sees are the sum of all the bugs! So it's no wonder why there is a "Xiaoqiang" near the restaurant.
6. Compared with the price of 1300 per night in your hotel, do you think it is appropriate to provide guests with mineral water for a few cents? Can the management of the hotel drink it at home?
7. The net red rainforest swimming pool is also shared with the villa owners next to the real estate side. It is simply to maximize the benefits of the facility!
8. The floor next to the swimming pool is not repaired in time. When you step on it, it will obviously collapse and rebound, and it is easy to scratch your feet.
By the way, I found out that except for the last month, I have to add at least 150 yuan per day to the reservation.
This kind of hotel that has no integrity and sincerely deceives guests recommends Ctrip to punish it accordingly. No one will care about the small cost of 15.20 when everyone travels, but Westin's behavior of asking for "little money" can't help but lower his position.
Thanks to Westin, who single-handedly took out all the thunder of Haitang Bay Hotel for me!
I will also exercise my right to report the problem to the Sanya Tourism Bureau and the Market Supervision Administration!

Facilities: The hotel room is simple and spacious, with a large balcony with sea view and a good view, you can see the waves in the sea. The bathroom and shower in the room are independent and spacious. The walls are dark stone and give a cool feeling. The location of the bathtub is very reasonable, you can soak in the bathtub and watch TV. There is also a large reclining chair in the room, which is very comfortable to lie on. The super big bed in the big bed room is very soft and gives people the feeling of falling asleep, and the comfort is super high. The hotel is very large as a whole, with many swimming pools. I personally like the river swimming pool in the center of the hotel. It provides flat-bed kayak (easy to operate) and transparent glass boats (beautiful photos) for the guests. vacation time. There are a lot of free semi-enclosed sun loungers with umbrellas all over the hotel swimming pool and beach. There is also a high-altitude infinity pool on the 9th floor of the hotel but need to order drinks. The Lanzhou beef ramen for breakfast in the hotel is very authentic, as well as the tofu brain and pork and corn dumplings. The barbecue set included in the Ctrip hotel package, the barbecue platter is very rich, and the side dishes taste more western. Mineral water and minibar in the room are refilled for free every day.

Service: The personal feeling of the hotel service can give seven stars. The cici of the express service center took the initiative to ask the guests' needs, and arranged a honeymoon room for free and sent a fruit and a piece of delicious fruit cake. Because the flight to the outlying islands left the hotel at night, the room was extended to 4 pm for free. This is really too much. It's so humane, it's amazing. Because the hotel is very big, you can take a free shuttle bus at the concierge to get to the beach.

3. After staying for two or two days, they brought coconuts to us every morning.
4. We went back to the room the next day and prepared surprises for us. Balloons and cards were beautifully arranged.

msg:I don't know why a lot of people complained about it on the Internet. I was worried about changing it myself, but when I came here, I found that it was actually very good. It's not what it said on the Internet. During the two nights I stayed, there were not many people due to the epidemic, so there was no such thing as a long wait for check-in. They even upgraded my room. The housekeeper ella chen was also very considerate and asked me if I needed to check out late. I think many details of the hotel are well done: all the staff have a very good attitude. I was the only passenger on the airport pick-up bus due to the epidemic and made a special trip to pick me up (that is, the time is relatively fixed), and there is free nucleic acid in the hotel. Convenience (I don't have any other hotels later), the hotel specially opened a side door that leads directly to the duty-free shop for three minutes. In the package, there are two large and one small package in the Shuiting restaurant. Since I am alone, the restaurant staff also flexibly help me change it. It is a way of eating two meals per person, and I put lavender essential oil on the bed every night. I didn't want to mention the separate cloakroom and drinks in the room, but the hotel I stayed behind didn't even have it.
If you have to make some comments, I think that the travel photo in the package sends five paper photos, you can change it to send five electronic photos, because the paper photos are actually quite blurry, of course, the travel photo has a very good attitude. I felt comfortable buying photos without paying extra.
Next time I want to bring my family it is very comfortable.

msg:The Westin at its peak must be very good, after all, it is an Internet celebrity hotel. With such a large outdoor area and a long river swimming pool, it is very suitable for a large lawn for outdoor weddings. In fact, the outdoor landscape is more worth mentioning than the room facilities. Maybe due to the epidemic, there are not many passengers in the hotel, resulting in very few breakfast categories, and the room facilities are full of the sense of age. Since the pool room is booked, there are still mosquitoes on the first floor, and the pool water is not constant temperature. So go into the water and cool down. The lady Ella of the hotel is very good. You can tell that she is a local by listening to her accent. She introduced all aspects of the hotel's facilities very intimately. As for the room, frankly speaking, it doesn't quite meet the five-star standard, but if the renovation of the hotel is a big project, It's a pity not to patronize this hotel at its peak.

When I chose the Haitang Bay Hotel, I struggled with the choice of Westin among several nearby hotels for a long time.

When checking in, the housekeeper also came to the front desk and asked the staff to give me a high floor. Praise +1
During the stay, the hotel will clean the room twice a day (with turndown service).
Due to the epidemic, there are very few guests in the hotel, and you can have fun in the pool and the seaside, and the experience is great.
Service: The housekeeper will take the initiative to send a message to inform the meal time and place, and take the initiative to remind us to do nucleic acid and go there to do it. (There is a nucleic acid point on the first floor of the hotel) It is very convenient.
Room: relatively large, our room is closer to the sea. There is a minibar (included in the package)
Package: There is a free dinner in the open air on the beach, but there are mosquitoes.
Travel photography: It costs money to take photos for hotel travel photography, but I am very satisfied with the photos, and I am willing to spend money to buy them (the price is OK)

Occasionally swiped on the boss live broadcast to sell the pre-sale in Sanya. With the mentality that I can return it anyway, I will buy it and then I will be attracted by Westin in many luxury resort hotels in Sanya. The promotional image of the hotel is really tempting. Although the epidemic situation is repeated, and there is still a week before November, we finally make up our minds to take a risk and reserve a room.
Sure enough, it was a very worthwhile trip that exceeded our expectations!
First of all, I am very grateful to Ella, the vip housekeeper. During our stay, he provided us with meticulous care. No matter how late it was, he could answer my questions in a timely manner. During the few days we stayed, unfortunately, we encountered a new epidemic in Sanya. People were panicking, Ella contacted me immediately, informed us about the hotel's nucleic acid test, and reassured us not to be nervous, thank her very much! It is really lucky to have such a butler on the journey~
As for the hotel itself, it is definitely top-notch. The airport shuttle bus is a five-minute walk from the duty-free city, and there are various experience programs in the hotel. The most important thing is that the price is very close to the people, whether it is bar drinks or restaurants. , the price is much cheaper than expected, this is definitely a plus!
Due to the epidemic in Sanya, I didn't go to any attractions this time, and I basically stayed in the hotel. This also allowed me to experience the facilities and services of the entire resort more deeply. It was really a perfect journey! If I have a chance to come to Sanya for vacation, I will definitely choose Westin~❤️

The hotel housekeeper Damon contacted in advance to arrange the room, and the service was warm. You can find him if you need it. This time, the hotel does not have an open swimming pool, and there are not many activities to play. Next time, I will experience some hotel projects. Overall, it was a good stay experience, and I will choose Westin next time.

msg:This time I stayed at The Westin Sanya Haitang Bay. First of all, the housekeeper hannah added my WeChat account to make this stay smoother. If you have any questions, please contact the housekeeper. The environment in the hotel is also very good, because most of the facilities are due to the epidemic. They are not open to help arrange rooms with swimming pools. Although there are not many occupants, the service attitude of the hotel is very good. If you have any problems, you can communicate and solve them in a timely manner. The housekeeper is very responsible and will remind you to bring an umbrella in advance because of the epidemic. 👍 Many things are considered for us, because the itinerary and check-out conflict a bit, but also help with late check-out. During the check-in period, I was very careful, and the overall stay was satisfactory.

The hotel is located in Haitang Bay, a 3-minute walk from Sanya International Duty Free City, the river swimming pool yyds. Due to the epidemic, for a better stay experience, the hotel upgraded the pool villa for free and delivered breakfast to the room. The service of the butler, Justin, was warm and attentive, meeting all our needs and making us feel the quality of Westin. Very satisfied with a stay, I will stay at Westin in Sanya in the future.

The photos are very beautiful, and it is very close to the duty-free shop. It is very convenient and suitable for me. The service has been better before I came here. The hotel management is in place, and the staff has a strong sense of happiness, which makes people feel very warm. There is also a housekeeper named Fu Huan, who is very thoughtful and caring. Fortunately, he told us, 8: I went down to breakfast at 30. There were many people after 9:00, and there was a long queue outside. When we left, he asked us if we needed a free airport drop-off service to the hotel. Very caring and thoughtful lady, thank you for taking care of me all the way 👍👍

msg:In terms of transportation, although Haitang Bay is quite far from Phoenix Airport, it is still convenient. There is a free bus from the airport to the hotel. This purchase event also provides a BMW-class private car to pick up the airport, which is very comfortable. There is a duty-free shop next to it, which is convenient for shopping. It only takes five minutes from the side door. Moreover, there are many restaurants in the newly added area of the duty-free shop. If you don’t want to eat the hotel buffet, you can easily go to eat other delicious food. The room is quite big, clean and tidy, free minibar (there are beer drinks, drinks are also divided into ordinary and sugar-free, very considerate), there are drying racks and reclining chairs on the balcony, the bathroom is large, clean and tidy, the bathtub is also quite big, and When the ground is wet, it is not slippery to step on, it is very safe, and overall it is very comfortable. Hotel environment: very good, there are many green plants, it is very happy to walk under the shade, there are often security guards on the beach from morning to night, and the beach at night, only the Westin beach is the brightest, Gives a sense of security. The set package provides kayaking, paddle boards, net red swimming rings and family bicycles. It is very fun. The children are very happy. The activities in the swimming pool are very rich, and the hotel also provides 5 laundry activities for summer clothes, which is fun and does not need to be used. Laundry is very convenient. The breakfast time is quite long and the dishes are rich. I am especially happy that the vegetables provided in the hotel in the morning are very rich and abundant! Give a big like👍🏻! Service: Special thanks to the hotel's VIP for receiving hannah, who is very friendly and responsive to any inquiries. All in all, I am very satisfied with my stay this time, and I will definitely come back next time!

On the day of check-out, the weather is good and it will not rain. Change your clothes and bring a swimsuit. When it came time to make the appoin**ent, I didn’t see the photographer calling and urging me to say that I was not feeling well. After 40 minutes later, after being urged by the hotel steward, someone finally took a photo. Later, I also ordered a package for them to take pictures.
The reception at the front desk was not very fast at the time of check-in. The first round of the minibar in the guest room is free. The breakfast can be said to be rich in variety. The TV and toilet in the room are old and not smart. The garden landscape in the hotel is very good. Boats, glass boats, kayaks, glass boats, family bikes for staying guests can play for one hour free of charge per day. I didn’t go to the infinity pool because of the rain the other day. It was noon on the third day. We went to the beach of the hotel, which was a little far away, because there were not many people at noon. The sand on the beach was white and delicate, and the sea water was clear! The biggest advantage of this hotel is about a 5-minute walk from the duty-free shop. The hotel's sightseeing car can be delivered to the security guard at the side door, and it takes 3 minutes to walk there.

msg:The hotel is next to the duty-free shop, which is definitely the first choice for shopping. The facilities of the five-star hotel are basically good, the swimming pool is very long and beautiful, and many people check in and take pictures. The sunrise in Haitang Bay is also very beautiful. There is no set package in advance. This summer vacation in Sanya is not very cheap... I booked a normal room type, but luckily it was assigned to the 7th floor, and I was able to see part of the sea view, which was a pleasant surprise. The hotel has a dedicated housekeeper, Miss Alla Tang, who contacted the service in advance and sent fruits and gifts, which was very considerate. The children's swimming pool scratched a small hole, and the manager also came to ask for care, and also sent fruit and red wine. The children are reluctant to come out in the water all day long, and there are many parent-child activities, but they did not participate. Haitang Bay Yalong Bay's peak season consumption is not low. I bought dinner in a Chinese restaurant in a group, and I feel that the price is very high in the entire surrounding hotels. The B package that I chose is really good. I originally wanted to eat this A package the next day, but my family wanted to go out and eat and experience it. 68 Food Street is recommended, and there is also a special car to pick up and drop off. The taste of a shop you choose at random is also very good. In short, Sanya is really beautiful, very pleasant trip...

…………The Chinese restaurant set meal for two, more than 300 for two people is very full, including cold and hot dishes and fruit desserts, the taste is quite satisfactory, and the ordering is more delicate and delicious.
…………Afternoon tea is not very recommended😳😒, the infinity pool is actually an independent swimming pool in the presidential suite. No need to experience this one 🙈🙊

Special thanks to the housekeeper Damon for this sudden outbreak. He was very considerate of foreign guests and helped us to change the floor and view of the same room type. He was always concerned when he stayed in the room. , sharing information in a timely manner, arranging charter flights and other affairs in a timely manner, so that we have a high evaluation of Westin. Emergency measures are in place. Worthy of praise.
The hotel is also very convenient to travel. There is a duty-free city next door, but it is closed during the outbreak of the epidemic. Kind of a pity. If you stay next time, you will continue to choose Westin Haitang Bay.
The hotel room is large and the room is very clean. The hotel's river swimming pool is really beautiful, and there are kayaking and descending boards to play. In short, Westin is the first choice to take your baby to Sanya.

Service: The service is good and the response is very fast
Facilities: The facilities are fully equipped, and some facilities are suggested to be refurbished.
Hygiene: clean, epidemic prevention and control is not bad

Service: Humane, warm and professional. The housekeeper, Mengmeng, is particularly good, and I really appreciate it. The service level of all the waiters is much higher than that of Shangri-La and Atlantis, they are very sense, and the services provided are all on point. There are also sneakers.

Environment: The hotel is very beautiful. There are Internet celebrity Moon River swimming pool, rooftop infinity swimming pool, and vegetation is also very layered, which has been carefully designed. The room maintenance is quite new, you can see the whole sea from the balcony.

Slots: We have reserved two rooms on the 6th floor and the 3rd floor. The 3rd floor is facing the roof of the lobby, which blocks the line of sight. If you live on the third floor, it is best to avoid the rooms in the middle. The water in the children's pool is a bit colder than the adults' pool.

On the first day of the hotel, the room faced the second phase of the shopping center, and there was noise during construction at night. But seeing the sunrise, I changed the room the next day and solved it. The hotel is very large as a whole, and there are many people at breakfast, but the entrance is managed and the overall is not chaotic. Swimming pool, nice. The room decoration and equipment are in line with the materials and brands of the five-star hotel. However, the quality of electrical appliances needs to be iterated. The TV is loud and noisy. The air conditioner is not too cold, and the quilt in the indirect room still feels damp compared to Tianyu. However, the hotel's mattresses are really good, and they are low-end products from small brands.

The outdoor bbq in the package is unexpectedly high quality. The chef of barbecue lamb chops is attentive, and the fish soup is delicious. In the end, the fresh Xiaoqinglong was served, which is not a compliment for Boston. The lemongrass sauce is good, and there is room for improvement. Buddha jumps over the wall, but it's not amazing.

The improvement point is that the room facilities need to be updated, the chairs are broken, should they be replaced?

If you don't have children, you can stay in a hotel for a few days.

There are swimming lanes interspersed in the hotel swimming pool, and tourists rowing boats pass by, which is very distinctive. The hotel room I booked is a family room. The room has enough space and the bedding is comfortable. If the small round bed is for two children under 6 years old, it is no problem. It is my personal habit. Usually, the air conditioner at home is 23 degrees. After the housekeeper knew about it, she immediately contacted the housekeeping depar**ent to change the room. This experience is very good. As for the hotel meals, I ordered a one-price all-inclusive package. I think this is really worth it. I have a buffet at Shuiting Beach in the evening. The feeling of melting, and then the soufflé, my wife likes it very much, I ate 4 at a time, and I also admire it. For lunch, I chose to eat Japanese food and Chinese food, both of which have their own characteristics, and they are all decent, but I still like the watering buffet, hahaha! The hotel's private beach is also very good. There are not many people. The sand on the beach is fine and the sea water is clear. Sanya is like this as a whole. It's really great! Oh, by the way, here I want to focus on my housekeeper Cindy, she is really conscientious, she took the initiative to contact me the day before coming to the hotel, and then during the three days and two nights in the hotel, I did my best. Provide us with services, take the initiative to ask us what we need, and she will do it for you. Knowing that I am here for my daughter's birthday, I also specially explained that the housekeeping depar**ent sent a small cake and a small gift. My daughter is very happy 🥳 Thank you to the kind-hearted Miss Cindy! When we come to Haitang Bay in the future, we will still stay at Westin, just for the environment and service, it is worth it!

The most satisfying thing is that it can provide a rest place for the guests who have checked out but want to take a late flight.

As for the gifts from the hotel: the big game parent-child activities are for children aged 3-12, and our children can't play... The kayaks in the big gift bag are very fun. Swim lane play. The free part of travel photography is not interesting, unless you buy its package; in the end, we took the action camera ourselves, and it was very fun.

It is very convenient to do nucleic acid. There are charging points in the hotel, and there are free points on the road opposite the first phase of the duty-free city near the hotel.

There is a battery car at the side door of the hotel to go to the first phase of the duty-free city. There are many small restaurants in the second phase of duty-free city. The Chinese element restaurant in the hotel and the level of dance and Japanese cuisine are all online. The Shuiting restaurant has no time to try this time, but the a**osphere is also very good after walking in the evening.

You can walk on the private beach, but not in the water. The security guard said that the tide is high in the morning and low in the afternoon. After the tide is low, you can go treading water. We didn't see any crabs...Although the night sky at night is not quite as bright as the stars, there are still more stars than the big cities.

The small flaw is that the air conditioner is too weak... the actual temperature can't go down even if it is turned on to the lowest level... The main building is open and the air conditioner is also very weak...

It was arranged a little, and children's toys and tents were added. The two children were very happy sleeping on the round bed. , It makes people feel that this hotel is a great value. It is very close to Westin. The battery car of the concierge can be delivered to the side door of the hotel for walking. There are also a lot of water paddleboard teachers who are very good. Our children are too small. Several male teachers took the children to swim around the river directly in the water, and they were all wet. I am very grateful!
The lunch set for 2 large and 2 small is great value, the dishes are fresh and delicious, and there is leftovers for a family of four.
The first round of free minibar in the room also saved us a lot of money on drinks.
The bad: the hotel buffet was pre-booked and no one told me. The platform didn't write it, so I had to go to dinner after 8.30. I called the front desk to ask if I could make it in advance, and told me that I had to wait for the next wave or eat tomorrow. During the period, I didn't send any snacks to the children. The children were hungry all the time. Eat fruit, the key point is that the buffet dishes are very poor. When we went there, we found that it was outdoors, and there was no service and no food. When playing ice cream, we found cones by ourselves, played by ourselves, caught small mosquitoes, and ate with our eyes closed. , and there are a lot of mosquitoes, I have to step on the sand, it's hot and itchy, the lights are dim, I can't see food at all, when I go back to take a bath, I remove the black headrest from the bathtub and find a cockroach or some small animal, almost Scared me to death.

msg:I was planted by the photos of the Westin Tropical Rainforest River in Haitang Bay. I browsed all the guest reviews on various platforms and concluded that the rooms are average, the swimming pools are the most beautiful, the water sports provided on the XC are rich, the hygiene is acceptable, and the Phenomenon Many hotels in Sanya Bay complain of mosquitoes. The price in the early 1000s is considered close to the people among the light luxury hotels in Haitang Bay.
One day before check-in, the housekeeper contacted by phone and WeChat, and was told that because of the overcrowding on weekends, the room type that the hotel promised to be upgraded was no longer available (´-ω-`) Only the rooms on the 1st to 3rd floors facing the garden can be accommodated. I was disappointed at first, but the room is quite large. In addition to a two-meter bed, there is a round sofa that can be used as a small bed. There is also a sofa on the balcony that can even fit a disobedient husband [laughs] R]
The next day fulfilled the principle of being full on summer weekends, and the buffet breakfast restaurant was still queuing at ten o'clock. The breakfast restaurant that originally closed at 10:30 is also very humanely opened until after 11:00. The variety of breakfast in the restaurant is really nothing compared to the Atlantis next to it. I just wanted to fill my stomach and I was pleasantly surprised. The food is very delicious, even the desserts that many big hotels ignore are very delicious. ԅ (¯ㅂ¯ԅ) Favorability +1
Complimentary swimming pool play items: Internet celebrity swimming ring 🏊🏻glass boat 🚤 sampan board 🏄🏻 kayak 🚣🏻 canoe + family bicycle 🚴🏻 enough for you to play here for a day. Of course, each swimming pool is a blockbuster set, and the infinity pool on the ninth floor will be released at any time (o´*`) You must not miss it.
Next time, the cost-effective hotel must be brushed twice [Come on R] and collect it

msg:The area of the hotel is very large, the coverage rate of green plants is very high, the overall environment is very good, the river channel of the hotel is also very well designed, it is very interesting to row a boat through the river channel, haha…

The sea view outside the room I was assigned is as shown in the picture. It is very positive and beautiful. The area of the room is relatively large, the hygiene is very good, the bedding is also very good, and it is very comfortable to sleep. The biggest praise of the hotel should be given to the gym. The equipment is very complete. The area is also very large among hotels in Hainan, and the experience is very good.

My housekeepers, Hannah and Damon, are also very nice, and they are responsive to my requests. They gave me coconuts every night I stayed, and I really realized the freedom of coconuts. I am very happy, hahahahaha!

The only downside of the hotel is that the facilities are a bit old. If it is refurbished, it is definitely a very good hotel, so I recommend it.

I like the five-star praise. He is excellent and caring. You can find him if you need it during the store, and he will respond as soon as possible.
The hotel has complete facilities, swimming pool, restaurant, gym, SPA, and recreational activities. The most interesting part of the hotel is that you can kayak and take pictures in the river pool. Some of them are outdoor activities, which are rich and interesting. There are many children's programs, and the children like it very much. The teachers are very responsible, such as Teacher Guoguo, Fat Tiger, Xiaoliu, Haiou, Fanfan, Ahwu, etc...Because I have lived for too many days, I am very familiar with most of the teachers. Yes, haha! The hotel is close to the duty-free shop, which is convenient for shopping. I am very satisfied with this stay. I like it, very nice, very satisfied.

msg:Due to the epidemic, I haven't been out to play for a long time. The last time I came out was on my honeymoon last October. When we came to Sanya in October last year, we also experienced 3 five-star hotels, and the one that satisfied us the most was Westin. This time we opted for 1 night Hilton and 3 nights Westin. Sure enough, the Westin service is the best!
        On the day of 6/1 Children's Day, there will be a small gift from "Snow White". From the front desk to the guest room to the restaurant and the swimming pool, the service of every service staff adds to our travel experience. Every staff member you meet in the hallway always has a smile on her face. Special thanks to sister Wu Ni from the housekeeping depar**ent. She cleans the room very clean. When I go back to the room every day, I see the clean and tidy room, and the fatigue of the day is swept away. There are also little brother Jack from the Japanese restaurant, little sister Maggie from the front desk, and little brother Mark from the swimming pool.
        There is nothing to say about the scenery of Westin, garden view, pool view, sea view, music in the garden, full of a**osphere, romantic and relaxing in the air.
        Of course, Westin's excellent location is a 5-minute walk from the duty-free shop. It is not too convenient to visit 5 times in three days.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will come to Westin again. like [strong]

The hotel covers a very large area. It takes about 6 or 7 minutes to walk to the beach. There is an independent beach swimming pool very close to the beach. I personally feel that the swimming pool is the biggest feature of the hotel. The fun of rowing~ The VIP reception manager Fu Huan was warm and thoughtful when we checked in. The room was arranged for us on the 9th floor, and the view was very good. It would be more convenient to put some handbags in the room~

The Westin in Haitang Bay is right next to Sanya Duty Free City, just a few hundred meters away. If you like shopping, you must live here! Girls who like to take pictures must also live here! The Internet celebrity swimming lane and the infinity pool are absolutely amazing, and it is a blockbuster if you take any photos! Finally, I would like to commend Miss Fu Huan, the reception manager of the hotel, who helped us throughout the whole process and helped us to check out twice for free. If I come to Sanya next time, I will stay here again! There is also jason's lobby guide to help you check out, but the room is not very close to the sea, and the view of the nearby hotels is not very good, because the resort hotel will be some distance from the coastline, if you want to see a better sea view, Dadonghai good. The swimming pool on the top floor is good, and the photo effect is good. Because the restaurant does not have many dishes due to the epidemic, it is recommended to improve it.

It is recommended to check the equipment more, and the air-conditioning is not cooling.
The breakfast is very rich and the restaurant has a wide variety of dishes to choose from. The hotel's river swimming pool is very suitable for kayaking and glass boats. There are coaches who will take you to the hands, which is very interesting. Both couples and parents and children can enjoy it. Each section of the swimming lane is beautiful, as if swimming in a tropical rain forest.
In terms of catering, the Chinese restaurant is a mix of local and Cantonese dishes, which is very suitable for my taste. Several dishes are surprising. The dishes are also designed according to the traditional Chinese 24 solar terms, which is very ingenious.

You can even take a glass boat and a kayak to assemble x-photos. The point is that there is a duty-free shop next to the hotel, no need for a taxi, so you can save time to buy it

       We chose the Westin Hotel. How can we not go to the duty-free shop when we come to Sanya? The Westin Hotel is only a few hundred meters away from Sanya International Duty Free City.
        After arriving at the hotel, Miss Fu Huan at the front desk received us and helped us with antigen testing. The check-in was very professional, and gave us a detailed introduction to the hotel's facilities. Due to the many changes in business hours due to the epidemic, she told us one by one that the service was very good. .
        The swimming pool of the hotel is very beautiful, but it is a bit cloudy these two days, the water is relatively cold, it is a pity that I didn't go for a swim, but the whole hotel environment is very good, especially suitable for vacation. The family had a great time and will definitely choose again next time. Thanks again for the warm service of the housekeeper Fuhuan.
        I would also like to commend Jason, who was on duty at the front desk that night. The child bit his tongue when he was eating late at night. Jason gave us iodophor cotton swabs and Band-Aids. Because the child cried, he also gave us two boxes of spring food, which the children liked very much.

msg:The Westin Haitang Bay we stayed at this time was originally close to the duty-free shop, but the actual check-in experience was very good, especially the service did look like a five-star big brother. Here are a few things about my feelings:

Service: The housekeeper, MAGGIE, is really responsible. He communicated with us one day in advance to confirm, and greeted us in person when we checked in. He also warmly helped us upgrade our room. After we got a foot bruise in the last hotel, MAGGIE took the initiative to help us get Yunnan. Baiyao, an ice bucket and a few pillows to raise the legs are very detailed; they also told us that the hotel phone might be broken during off-duty hours. If you need to contact her at any time, you will answer any questions. The doorman of the hotel was also very warm-hearted. It was raining after returning from the duty-free shop. After seeing it, the little brother called a battery car and took us back to our room!

Jing: The hotel is very big, and the overall environment is very good. It is very good to take a picture in the hotel. The hotel also has its own private beach, which is also very comfortable to lie on the beach.

Room: The upgraded supreme sea view suite has a great sea view, the room is also large, and there is a cloakroom, but the facilities are a bit old, it is recommended to upgrade.

Eat: The breakfast is quite satisfactory, you can DIY to refresh the cold; we temporarily tried the Chinese restaurant, and it was unexpectedly delicious; for dinner, we went to the Shuiting restaurant to try the seafood barbecue buffet, but because of the epidemic, only a set menu was provided, so it was temporary. Choose to go out for seafood.

It's a pity that I only stayed for one day because of the itinerary. I will choose it again next time I come to Haitang Bay!

msg:The hotel is completely planted by Internet celebrities. The Internet celebrity infinity pool and the rafting coconut forest river pool are the best Internet celebrity check-in places.

The hotel is located on Haitang North Road, close to Sanya International Duty Free City, with unique cultural and natural landscapes all around the hotel. Rooms have scenic balconies with stunning garden or sea views. Enjoy swimming in the tens of thousands of square meters of swimming pools, and the best experience is the happiness brought by the pulp board.

You can take photos in the hotel, you need to book a photographer in advance, and guests can play for one hour for free every day on the pulp board, and they can row along the river for a long time.

In the evening, it is very pleasant to watch the night scene and drink coconuts at the bar by the pool. The night scene is very enjoyable. There is a coconut 38 in the hotel logo. I have stayed in the row of hotels in Haitang Bay, and the experience of staying at the Westin Jingxiong in the Coconut Grove can definitely be ranked in the top three.

The hotel service is very good, Olivia at the front desk is super gentle, and we also have our exclusive housekeeper Jason, who happened to encounter an epidemic in Haitang Bay, but the service is still super good, not perfunctory because of the small number of people, reminding us to do nucleic acid and travel safety every day, it's really good intimate.

msg:#must stay hotel
This is a second trip or will choose the hotel
We took the motor car from Haikou and got off the motor car and took a taxi for about ten minutes to arrive at the hotel. The transportation is very convenient. I saw the pictures of the hotel on the Internet and it is the same as when we went there. Every balcony is light green and looks very fresh. Or the corridors are cleaned on the first floor, giving people a transparent feeling. We live in a garden-view room. It should be the sun in the west through the white gauze.
The curtains shining in is so healing. Before checking in, the housekeeper will contact us in advance to avoid stepping on the pit and finding a place.
Geographical location: Super super super super super super close to the beach, close or not, you hit me, what I said
Service whether it is reception at the front desk and concierge or meeting customers in the corridor
The room attendants or the staff are very friendly and comfortable, maybe they all have to speak in a calm and kind manner. The key point is to praise the housekeeper Merlin for meeting all kinds of needs, and trying to find a way. When we go out to play, we will also recommend places with high cost performance. It’s really sweet! Continue to choose next time! Minsheng Westin YYDS can update the room equipment

Bed: The bed is very comfortable.
Hygiene: The room is fairly clean.

Swimming pool: The swimming pool is still relatively large, and there are loungers next to it. You can lie down and rest when you are tired from swimming. There are also swimming rings you can borrow, which is more convenient.
Cost-effectiveness: The price-performance ratio is good, and the price is not high among the brand hotels in Haitang Bay.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Jason, the service is super good, and I will find him in the future.

And the swimming pool is very big, the people are scattered and not crowded, it looks like dumplings, and the photo is perfect. You can really fall in love with this swimming pool at a glance, and it takes about 10 minutes to go back and forth one by one.
There are coconut trees on both sides of the pool, so be careful when taking pictures! Spray anti-mosquito spray. Otherwise, I will kiss you silently
The pulp board is 100 yuan/hour (still relatively stable). The service of the housekeeper merlin is considerate, and there are also glass boats and kayaks. Tropical forest feeling, full of Southeast Asian style.
The hotel also has a children's swimming pool. You will blow bubbles in the swimming pool at 5-6 pm, which is simply a children's world.
: Regarding the angle of taking pictures, if there is a small bridge above the river, you can take a bird's-eye view on the bridge. But the close distances in Figures 3, 4, and 5 are not bad. In short, there is zero error rate.
The beach of the hotel is also really good. It takes about ten minutes to walk straight to the end. There are many lawn beach pools, and the standard configuration is full. The water in Haitang Bay is also very blue, mainly because there are fewer people!!!
: It is a five-minute walk to the duty-free shop Sanya International Duty Free. It is recommended to add more locations for breakfast.

Except for the sheets, everything was sticky, and after touching the sofa and the round bed, my hands were sticky. And I don't know how to make each set of sheets very uncomfortable. The balcony glass with the sea view was dirty and didn't clean at all. The most uncomfortable thing is that the sewage smells so disgusting. Also there is a smell on the towel. It's not that I'm picky, you're the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. You can't compare with other hotels of the same level. The service is not bad. The inside of the swimming pool is also very dirty, and the bottom and walls of the pool are yellow-green visible to the naked eye. And many of the shops inside are outsourced, there is no feeling of high-end hotels at all, dirty, messy, poor

First of all, the geographical location is convenient, and there is a duty-free shop next to it, which satisfies the desire to shop at any time. Moreover, the duty-free shop will be jammed in traffic, so it is very convenient to live here on foot.

If you are too lazy to go out, it is enough to spend an afternoon in the hotel, which is very suitable for taking pictures! The breakfast buffet is full of varieties, the ingredients are fresh, and the hotel service staff is also very friendly.

If you have any questions, you will answer your questions quickly, and your attitude is also very good.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is nearly 100 meters away from the Sanya Duty Free Shop. . It is also very close to the beach. The hotel has many large and small swimming pools, which is very suitable for me who travels with my baby. Alla, the housekeeper of the Westin Hotel, is also very warm and clear. Every day, he will help me push the house for fun and delicious food. If you need anything, just click alla, and she can almost help you complete it. It's great to have such a good helper! I will go again in the next year, if I go, I guess I will choose this hotel again. The price/performance ratio is relatively high. Recommended

msg:The Westin Haitang Bay Minsheng is only separated by a wall from the duty-free city, which can be reached in five minutes on foot. It has a first-line sea view and a 1,200-square-meter swimming pool, which is the largest in Sanya. Stay at the hotel to unlock a kayak paddle board, a canoe and a surfboard
Various water activities such as transparent sightseeing boats.
The 400-meter river swimming pool, the Amazon blockbuster looks like an infinity pool in the sky. It is even more deeply loved by me. The swimming pool and the sea and the sky are connected together. The blue sea is accompanied by an ocean-themed afternoon tea.
There are rich parent-child activities, such as the swimming pool bubble party ~ the jungle crossing painting class, the racing skin, and it is recommended to add some adult activities. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Damon for his warm service. You can find him whenever you need it during the store, and will choose Westin next time.

And the service of the housekeeper merlin is very good, contacted the room to arrange the sea view
The environment is very high, and the rush is more than 2 meters. There is no partition between the bathtub and the bedroom, so you can watch TV at night while soaking
Swimming pool: Compared with Hilton, the scenery is better. There are many coconut trees and tropical green plants on both sides. can take a shortcut
I happened to encounter fireworks at dinner at night, and I haven't seen the fireworks of Shanghai Disney for a long time since the previous year. I was frightened, and there was such a loud noise on the back, and I didn't know what the event was. It was very romantic to eat a buffet by the sea. It is very realistic that after eating and blowing the sea breeze, my hair is oily to the point of streaking hahaha. After eating, I slowly walked back to the room. It was a little distance along the way, so I took a walk and took a look at the scenery by the way~ It is suggested that the morning shift menu can be added.

msg:Plog|Westin New Year's Day Family Tour

First of all, I would like to thank the Westin staff for their professionalism and enthusiasm! 😘Ms. Merlin received by VIP, immediately contacted me if I was in the hotel as soon as I went to work, upgraded my room, caringly asked me if I needed any help, and gave me a small gift~❤️
The juju lin of the Chinese restaurant 🍴, and the bonnie dong of Beiye planet, and the physiotherapist Yuni of Bali. Thank you for your company in these two days, and let me and my family have a good time together. Let me share my personal evaluation 👇🏻

I took my family to celebrate the holiday on New Year's Day and chose the Westin Haitang Bay, which is the closest to the duty-free shop. The original intention was to stop by the duty-free shop for shopping during the leisure time on vacation. Unexpectedly, when he entered Westin, the children had too much fun and didn't have time to go to the duty-free shop to buy things.

I saw the very popular renderings in Xiaohongshu, and the interior scenery of the hotel is also very beautiful. I wanted to take a group of photos of Zai paddling in the jungle. Zaiwan, I completely forgot about it, it's a bit regretful.

As soon as you enter the lobby, the fragrance of white tea is very comfortable. The fragrance, soap, and shower gel in the room are all the fragrance of white tea, which makes you feel at ease and comfortable. The bed was very soft, and Zai happily jumped on the bed. As soon as I sat on the bed, my grandma said: so soft~ so comfortable🥰

I heard from my friends that Westin’s Japanese food is very famous in Haitang Bay, so I tried it and it tasted great. Those who hate vegetables most often think that Japanese-style salads are delicious! 🥗

The Chinese restaurant is the place where we eat the most times. Thank juju for recommending dishes for us and reminding me. We had a lot of leftovers at the last meal, and Juju asked if we were out of taste. I said it was delicious, but my grandma and I were full after eating the noodles. I was anxious to take our children to the New Year's Day fair on Beye Planet, so she didn't worry about it.

Because it is a parent-child trip, I will accompany my son to participate in various activities on the planet Beiye. The content is rich and interesting, including baking lessons, movable type printing, illustrations, etc. Check out today and take Tsai home. Tsai is losing his temper, saying that he still wants and doesn’t want to go home😂😂😂😂

Next to Beyeh Planet is the spa Tianmeng Spa. It’s really hard to take a child. Fortunately, I made an appoin**ent in advance. It’s really hot, the environment is high-end, the physiotherapist’s techniques are comfortable and in place, the attitude is also great, and I am very satisfied!

msg:I came back to Sanya after two months and stayed at the Westin Haitang Bay Minsheng Resort, which I liked very much. If you want to eat, have fun and take pictures, the most important thing is to buy it (it’s too close to the duty-free shop) and live in their house. I highly recommend the hotel's butler service. My butler, alla, has a very good service. The last reception was her who was still looking for her this time. She was very reliable and helped to upgrade the room. The reply was also very timely during the store. The most beautiful tropical rain forest in Sanya, the hotel's super large river swimming pool will really fall in love with it at a glance, it is so beautiful!! Coconut trees are planted on both sides of the river. This time, I brought children here to play. There are also many activities for children. Glass boats, kayaks, paddle boards, etc. can be played in the river. It makes me a little regret that there is no football in the hotel. . It is suggested that some activities on the lawn can be opened. That's one reason to come again next time. The room is clean and the food is abundant. The infinity pool on the top floor of Westin has a panoramic view of the sea, and the view is amazing!

1. This time I stayed at Westin Hotel with my family. Thank you very much Jason, the housekeeper. We booked three rooms with the elderly, and arranged them on the same floor very intimately. Satisfied, I contacted Jason. After learning that the room was full that day, Jason helped coordinate the room change the next day. He was very enthusiastic and professional. The hotel staff are very polite.
2. The hotel is located near the duty-free shop. It only takes a few minutes to walk. It is convenient for shopping and there are many places to eat nearby. It is also close to the scenic spots around Haitang Bay.
3. The hotel has a variety of restaurants to meet the needs of the holiday, as well as a gym and a spa. The facilities are slightly outdated, but the service is better than Jason.
4. The hotel cleans the room regularly every day, it is very clean, and it is timely to replenish things. There is also a disposable bathtub film, which is hygienic and worth staying in.
The trip to Sanya was served by Westin’s butler Jason, which was very satisfactory. Please contact him when you come.

There is fun every day, you can ask the waiter for children's slippers, children's nightgowns, unlimited supply of mineral water, and free drinks. There is a special shallow water area for children in the hotel, and the water is heated in the morning. You can row a boat along the swimming pool.

Many people take pictures in the hotel, and the front desk also gave gifts The voucher is really good. The environment of this hotel is really good. I recommend it, and the service attitude is excellent. The service of the housekeeper merlin is very good. Taking pictures, after all, they are public figures, and sometimes the image is very important. In the end, Freya, who checked out, helped me store my luggage, and praised the way of nucleic acid. The hotel in Haitang Bay generally has a good experience of staying, and I am busy with work. Thinking of taking a weekend vacation, I chose Sanya. Most of the hotels in Haitang Bay have passed. Because of the big waves in Haitang Bay, the hotels here are not allowed to go to the sea, but they are close to the duty-free shop. This time, I chose the Westin. There is a duty-free shop next to the hotel. My wife is so convenient.
The hotel has a U-shaped long swimming pool, which is a bit like a swimming pool in Angsana Phuket that runs through the first floor of the hotel.
On the first day of the two days, I slept until I woke up naturally, had breakfast, and went to lie down by the pool, playing with a balance board and swimming. Going to the duty-free shop in the late afternoon for shopping is basically a cheap price difference to get a round-trip air ticket.
The next day, go to the water world of Atlantis or go to Wuzhizhou Island to play for a day, and the flight back to Shanghai in the evening will not delay work~~Perfect

The hotel is located in the heart of Haitang Bay, and it is a two-minute walk to the duty-free shop. . The hotel has its own beach, facing the direction of the sunrise, the view really couldn't be better. In the off-season, there are few people on the beach, the commercial a**osphere is very light, and the feeling of no one disturbing gives the migrant workers who have been busy for a long time a rare leisure time. In the hotel, both adults and children can have a good time, and someone specially walks the baby (although the landlord comes alone)! At last! I must mention the account manager Alla, who is dedicated to contacting me, and the beautiful lady answered questions online throughout the whole process, arranged the entry, and then prepared the heart-warming souvenirs, which made the experience of this stay more warm! Anyway, in the Haitang Bay resorts, I think Westin is really a cost-effective butcher, and I will stay here next time I come!

msg:This business trip booked both Intercontinental and Westin, mainly because it is close to the duty-free shop. Here is an objective review for reference. Although the Intercontinental is more expensive, and the angle of decoration and scenery may be better than that of Westin, Westin is obviously better in service, especially the butler service. Westin's merlin must be liked, not only for free upgrades for me I got a room and arranged it on the highest floor on the 9th floor. Other services were provided free of charge. When I left, I also gave a commemorative gift. If you have any questions, you can answer them as soon as possible, and also take the initiative to care about your experience. In addition, in terms of parent-child entertainment, I think Westin is even better. While walking, I encountered staff and children playing bamboo pole dance, which was very interesting. Will choose Westin next time!

When he was ready, he informed and delivered it as soon as possible. He was very enthusiastic. I made an appoin**ent for a hotel tour. The hotel tour is very powerful and the photos are very beautiful. I especially recommend the infinity pool on the 9th floor and the river pool outside, which are worth experiencing. The activities by the pool, kayaking paddle boards are also very fun, there are many activities to play, it is better to add a beach volleyball activity by the sea. Location and transportation: There is an airport bus, and the transportation is convenient. There is a duty-free shop next to it, which is super convenient for shopping. There is also a short way to the park, which is very good.

msg:Location: The first reason for choosing Westin is because it is across the road from the duty-free shop. Buy and buy at any time, you can go when you get up, the straight line distance is not 200 meters, the door is opposite.
The second reason for choosing it is that he has the longest swimming pool in the world. In order to make a film, he played for more than an hour, which is quite interesting. The balance is not easy to master. It can be rented at the swimming pool for one hundred and one hour.
Hotel facilities and equipment: The 400-meter-long net celebrity river swimming pool is super movie. Can shoot large movies of the Mason Jungle. The total area of the visual swimming pool is 12,000 square meters, which is equivalent to two football fields. It is the largest hotel in Sanya with the largest number of swimming pools. The service center can rent kayaks, swimming laps, transparent boats with celebrities, and swimming laps with celebrities. There are also many chic deck chairs on the shore for people to rest.
The semi-arc-shaped building looks similar to a bird’s nest. It is said that the arc Yin wrote a comment, "The architectural design ensures that every room faces the sea and enjoys the garden landscape created after drinking.
The second reason for choosing it is that it has an infinity pool on the top floor. I recommend Westin if you want to be able to enjoy it in the hotel. It is too big. You have to call a shuttle bus at the hotel. It is convenient for shopping and has many items to play. , Room hygiene: The room is clean and tidy. Private beach is also ok
Suggestion: The hotel shuttle bus is a bit small, it takes a long time to wait for a car.
Service: The hotel’s VIP reception Ella has a very good service, with a sweet and lovely smile, and a good listen to Hainanese. The service is careful and patient, and the caring little padded jacket. It is too hard to work hard and overtime till late. In short, Hui is very satisfied and will contact her next time.

Let’s talk about the service first. Although I only stayed for one night, the housekeeper Jason contacted me one day in advance to ask about my check-in needs. He learned that we were coming for our honeymoon. Don't be too considerate, my wife arrived at the hotel first, check-in went smoothly, and the room was great.

Let's talk about the facilities. Although they are relatively old, they are relatively complete. There are gyms and spas. The swimming pools are great and very beautiful.

The room was cleaned very cleanly, showing the hotel's intentions in every aspect.

The hotel is close to the duty-free shop, a shopping paradise. It is so convenient. You can call a taxi at any time when you go to any place. I am satisfied.

Thank you very much for Jason's service this time. My wife and I are very satisfied. We will definitely come back in the future.

The only bad thing is that the shuttle bus in the hotel is called casually as long as it is used in the hotel, but when you go to the duty-free shop, he will not pull it to the door of the hotel, which is not good.

It can be seen that the hotel is very careful. The whole hotel is clean everywhere, there is no rubbish. Some hotels may not be kept so good. I hope that it can be kept like this and will come again in the future.

As soon as we entered the door, the staff greeted us very enthusiastically and helped with the luggage. There was a white beauty JESSIE at the front desk who knew we were on a honeymoon trip and enthusiastically helped arrange a room with a nice view. In the middle It was a little episode. There were some minor problems in the room. I met Miss Fiona at the front desk. She was very enthusiastic and patient to help us deal with it. The cleaning service staff we met during our stay all greeted us with smiles. This is a comparison. Rare. Every time I pass by the front desk, I will ask a few questions. I just ran into the handsome Dan at the front desk several times. He patiently answered me every time and provided more useful information to share with me, likes. Let’s talk about the rooms. This time I came to check in. It is obvious that the room facilities have been refurbished and the sanitation has been done carefully. I was hesitant to say whether the Westin is too old and I want to change to another hotel, but it’s The location is so good, right next to the duty-free shop. Originally, the last stop was to go shopping at the duty-free shop. I was too lazy to run far, so I chose Westin again. This time it gave me the feeling that I had chosen the right one. And I have to say that the infinity pool on the top floor is amazing. I really feel that I can lie on it for a day without getting down. I can see different beautiful scenery at every time period. It is an absolute Internet celebrity card. There is also that long swimming pool. Every day, many people line up to take pictures. I regret that I didn't prepare a beautiful swimsuit to take pictures. In short, I recommend it to everyone with my heart, and I won't lose money.

Location: This time we chose this Westin store in Haitang Bay. It is located on the international coastline of Haitang Bay. It has a private beach, a large hotel area, good greenery, and an international duty-free shop next to it, which is very convenient for shopping.
Service: The hotel has arranged a full service from Damon, the housekeeper, who is very considerate and handles all matters in a proper manner. The service is enthusiastic and proactive. Alla and Freya at the front desk are very enthusiastic. The entire hotel staff are very polite and will greet you wherever they go. The hotel’s catering is also very rich, including Japanese, Chinese, and buffet dinners.
Hygiene: The room is cleaned every day. It is very clean and thoroughly cleaned. The bed will be turned down and sleep oils will be delivered. The details are full.
Facilities: Although the hotel has been in operation for seven or eight years, the facilities are still well maintained. I never feel that it has been in operation for so long. There are also various projects in the swimming pool. It is really good to take the family with you.
In short, this trip to Sanya is very satisfied and satisfied because of the service of the Westin Hotel and the enthusiasm of the butler Damon. The Westin Hotel must be the first choice for Sanya next time.

msg:In recent years, I have come to Sanya on New Year’s Day to take a short break from the cold of winter. This is the first time I stayed at Westin, and it’s better than the one nearby. My husband and I like it very much, unfortunately The room is also temporarily booked this time, so there is no sea view room. In the future, it must be booked early in the peak period. The holidays are too popular!
I feel that these hotels along the coast of Haitang Bay are better than those of Long Bay. Perhaps Yalong Bay was developed earlier and the hotel decoration is a bit old. At least the Marriott in Yalong Bay is better than the Westin in Tang Bay, Shanghai. The difference is obvious when changing hotels. But Yalong Bay is a bit richer in food and drink, and Haitang Bay is relatively less ~ each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The hotel is still more comfortable in Haitang Bay, but I don’t know why. It feels that the sea in Yalong Bay is blue and green than Haitang Bay. Figure 12 can be compared. ～There are hotels in Sanya that can’t be finished, and I will try another one next time. Westin’s impression is still very good, and I will return to the hotel.
The hotel environment is good, butler Jason service is good, will come next time, I suggest that the hotel have more recreational facilities. The hotel environment is good, butler Jason service is good, will come next time, I suggest that the hotel have more recreational facilities.
One more thing, the duty-free shop is right next to it, the nearest hotel~

After checking in, I found that the overall environment of the hotel is good and the Marriott brand is still trustworthy. In terms of location, the hotel is close to a duty-free shop, which is very convenient for shopping and dining. But because the building itself occupies a large area, even though it is close, it takes 5-10 minutes to walk. There is a battery car in the hotel lobby that can be delivered to the hotel's front entrance, and then walk to the duty-free shop, you can take 1/3 of the road less.
In terms of catering, the breakfast is varied and complete, both open-air and indoor, which is dazzling.

🌰 Check-in: I arrived at the hotel reception early in the afternoon. The housekeeper Merlin arranged for me to upgrade the room to a high-floor ocean view room, and the room was just fine when I arrived, and the check-in speed was very fast. Butler service is very good throughout.
🏠The room is on the high floor of the hotel, and the balcony is facing the beach. The hotel’s lake pool, lawn, and beach are all at a glance. It is very pleasant to drink beer on the balcony and watch the sea view.
🧒The hotel has toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, you can call room service, and it will be delivered to your room in a few minutes. The quality of room delivery is also quite high, very convenient, and it saves you from going to other Internet celebrity restaurants in Sanya.
🥣🍹🥛Breakfast is served in the western restaurant. When you enter the door, the waiter will give one to every friend who does not wear a mask. If you are aware of the epidemic, the waiter will remind you to wear it when you pick up the meal. The restaurant has a large space and some sofas. In this area, you can enjoy the holiday breakfast comfortably. The food is still very rich. We recommend the shrimp wontons, which can be served with some green vegetables; freshly squeezed fruit juices and vegetable juices as well as various flavors of milk and yogurt are delicious. The hotel’s river swimming pool is very delicious. Great, I suggest you can add more pool equipment

The first is the intimate butler service. The housekeeper, Freya, is very kind. He started to understand our various needs the day before we moved in, and then tried to meet them as much as possible.
Then there is a hotel environment that can produce blockbuster movies at random. Especially the swimming lanes in the hotel, you must not miss the photos, whether it is swimming, kayaking or simply posing for photos. The hotel also has direct access to the sea, the swimming pool is tired, and it is also good to go to the beach to step on the water.

It was perfect. Merlin got it one day in advance I contacted us and asked about our needs. I said that I would like to have a room with a better view of the landscape, which is really good, facing the pool downstairs and the sea. It’s also really close to the duty-free shop. It’s only a few minutes’ walk away. It is recommended to walk there after dinner at night. There will be a lot of people during the day and less at night. The hotel as a whole is pretty good, but the balcony door doesn't close well, it's a bit laborious. I hope I can pay more attention to this aspect. Next time I come to play, I should come here again. I stayed for two days this time and felt I didn’t have enough. I can stay for a few more days next time! It is recommended that you come to play on a staggered peak. There are not so many people and the experience will be much better. It is close to the duty-free shop and shopping is convenient;

Many small details made me feel meticulously cared for. For example, when she heard me ask if there were any sanitary napkins for sale, she would take the initiative to send me ginger tea, etc. There are many small details like this that make me feel better. So I am very grateful to Miss MAGGIEW for her care.
Regarding the hotel, to be honest, it did not surprise me, and there was no surprise beyond my expectations. However, the facilities in the room are relatively comfortable, such as the large lounge chair and the balcony are also very large. The balcony faced the construction site on the first day, and I changed to a room facing the sea on the second day. For the guests' demands, the hotel will still try its best to meet the guests, which is also a plus.
In terms of environment, the bend has a swimming pool and an infinity pool on the 9th floor, which are both excellent. I feel that I can stay in the hotel for a day. There are also many tourist facilities for children. I feel that this hotel is more for family-type guests, so if you are traveling with children, it should be a good choice. 
In terms of location, it is very close to the duty-free shop, and it takes about 5-8 minutes to walk, so shopping is quite convenient.
As for the hotel food, the Chinese restaurant has a **limited time sale, and I bought a ticket before, which is quite cost-effective (the set meal is only 199), and the price-performance ratio is good! As for the Japanese food, the taste is very average, the lobster is not very delicious, the price is not expensive, and the food is also average. The breakfast is quite rich, with many choices.

The unexpected surprise was that the hotel was upgraded to the ninth floor. Lying on the bed, you can see the endless sea outside the window, and the scenery is infinite.
The hotel’s breakfast is rich, and dinner has a seafood barbecue buffet. There are Chinese restaurants and Japanese restaurants to choose from. The lobster soup rice in the Chinese restaurant is really delicious.
The service in the hotel is very good, the butler added WeChat one day in advance, and the various services are warm and thoughtful.
The river swimming pool in the hotel is a major feature of scenery and it is really beautiful. How can such a beautiful scenery be missed? If the husband does not cooperate with the photo, he can directly reserve the Manmo images in the hotel to leave infinite beauty. The photographer's photos are quite beautiful.

The VIP reception of Alla was meticulous and thoughtful, and all the problems were solved during the period. It was great 👍🏻 Nice stay experience, and will come again in the future.

msg:I stayed at the Westin Hotel on November 24. In summary, the hotel has a beautiful environment and the rooms are not new, but relatively clean. The hotel is close to the International Duty Free City, and there is a courtesy car to pick you up to the side entrance of the hotel, and then walk to the Duty Free City, which is more convenient for shopping. The receptionist was Miss Pingping, who had a great service attitude, and she was patient to solve problems for us. A small suggestion for the hotel: a ventilation system should be added to the bathroom of the room, which is convenient for people living together. For duty-free shopping, I recommend staying at this hotel.

The alla received by the VIP service team was really good, the hotel swimming pool is large, the photos are nice, the location is great, it is very close to the duty-free shop, and it is very convenient to travel. There are taxis and shuttle buses at the entrance of the lobby, which can be delivered to any place in the hotel. Concierge brother Tom is also pretty good. The overall price/performance ratio is very nice. Suggest that the hotel can update the room TV. The TV is so small that it can't cast the screen, and there are some problems with the speakers next to it. Everything else is pretty good. This is a bit inconvenient. Next time you come to Sanya, don’t bother to choose a hotel and continue to stay at Westin!

The hotel has a good location, close to the duty-free shop, just a few minutes walk, and the room we booked has a good view.
The hotel’s breakfast is also rich in variety and tastes good. It also provides sugar substitutes. It is very friendly to people with high blood sugar. Many hotels do not provide sugar substitutes.
The room order is also good, and the overall service is very good and in place. Just a little bit more wind in the hotel's hair dryer, otherwise girls' hair is more difficult to dry. It’s really close to the duty-free shop next door. It takes only two minutes to walk. It’s great. It’s convenient for shopping. The environment of the hotel is also great.

During the hotel, any problems can be solved by her, giving people a home away from home. The hotel’s river swimming pool is also beautiful. It’s really recommended to take children to play. The hotel also has an exclusive beach with few people. Although you can’t go to the sea, it’s very comfortable to step on the water at the beach; the hotel’s breakfast is also ok; But it is recommended to enrich it, and it is also recommended that the hotel can add some more entertainment facilities; in short, I will choose Westin Hotel next time I stay 👍

It is recommended that you play on a staggered peak. There are not so many people and the experience will be much better.

msg:I was worried for a while when I saw the bad reviews. After checking in, I found that the overall environment of the hotel is good, and the Marriott brand is still trustworthy. The most important thing is that the housekeeper Merlin contacted me in advance and upgraded the room for me. The check-out was delayed later, which was great.
In terms of location, the hotel is close to a duty-free shop, shopping and dining are very convenient. But because the building itself occupies a large area, although it is close, it takes 5-10 minutes to walk. There is a battery car in the lobby of the hotel that can be delivered to the hotel's main entrance, and then walk to the duty-free shop, you can take 1/3 of the road less.
In terms of catering, the breakfast is varied and complete, both open-air and indoor, which is dazzling.
In terms of service, the check-in time is really not short, at least 5 minutes, so be patient. Check out is quite fast. Fruits and coconut water will be provided on the day of check-in, which is necessary to cool off the heat. The waiter is basically responsive, and will give extra Hainan authentic snacks, and there will be a thoughtful note to prevent high temperature and heat stroke.
In terms of hardware, the rooms are reasonably separated, with separate cloakrooms, toilets, and shower rooms. The round bathtubs are placed in different positions according to different room types. If there is a round sofa bed in the room, it can sleep children. The diameter is 1.4 meters, pillows and quilts are all available, and children like it too. The outdoor balcony is equipped with racks for drying clothes, which is very intimate.
For entertainment, there are many swimming pools with a large area, and each swimming pool is equipped with a lifeguard. Sand dredging tools can be asked in the hotel service depar**ent. The lifebuoy needs to be rented or brought by yourself in advance. The rent is 30 yuan/hour.
For those who have a strong demand for shopping, staying in Minsheng Westin is definitely the right choice.

In addition, fruits are delivered to the room, next to the duty-free city. The hotel facilities are very complete, but unfortunately there is no one in the epidemic. The summer camp project is simply a private play, which is very enjoyable. The restaurant is not lost because of the small number of people. The overall pool view is invincible.

The hotels near the duty-free shop in Haitang Bay, such as the Edison, Atlantis, Yanlord, and Conrad have all stayed, but they have never stayed at the Westin next to the duty-free shop. This is true It shouldn't be, so this time the Sanya Bank must arrange Westin!
Purchase a one-price all-inclusive package for two nights. In addition to two breakfasts, it also includes a buffet lunch for two and a buffet dinner for two. In addition, one free mini bar, plus 6 sets of swimming pool play are free, and another 50 yuan is free of tax. The store has no threshold to reduce coupons, and the overall cost-effectiveness is still quite high
Live 🛌
The room is quite large and continues the simple decoration style of Westin. The Supreme Ocean View Room directly faces the sea, has a better view, comfortable bedding, and clean room.
Eat 🍽
Breakfast: There are more people, try to go early, otherwise you will have to line up... The food is pretty good, the soup noodles are better
Lunch: The one-price all-inclusive lunch is not a buffet, but a fixed set meal for two. You can choose to eat in a Chinese element restaurant or a Japanese dance restaurant. Each restaurant has two well-matched set meals to choose from. The set meals are generally matched The taste is quite satisfactory
Dinner: The barbecue buffet at Zhiwei Restaurant. There are not many things, but the taste is okay. There are resident singing outdoors. It is quite comfortable to sit outside and eat while listening to the songs. But what I have to complain about is that the drinks for dinner are really bad! Not as good as breakfast
Play 🛶
The most attractive part of this Westin is the rainforest swimming pool and the infinity pool on the top floor. It is indeed a film. Don't miss it if you love taking pictures.
Service🔔
Before I check in, a housekeeper will add WeChat in advance. Hannah Hao is the housekeeper for my stay this time. Before I check in, I asked about my arrival time. When I checked in, I was upgraded to the Supreme Ocean View Room for free. I took the initiative to apply for a duty-free shop in advance. A 5% discount is available. During my stay, I will quickly give feedback on some of the questions I raised. I also helped me to make a late check-out when I checked out. Hannah's service can score 120 points! Super five-star praise
In terms of staying at Westin Haitang Bay, the experience was great and cost-effective

msg:The first hotel in Sanya is mainly because of the unique location of this hotel, which is close to the duty-free shop. It is a 5 to 10 minute walk to the duty-free shop, which is really worry-free and effortless.

The resort hotels are all trying to provide services. Before moving in, Alla Tang, the housekeeper, added WeChat to understand various needs and helped to book a 5% discount coupon. On the same day, I also introduced the basic hotel facilities and shared various coupons for duty-free shops. I understand the customers very well. Take the initiative to deliver fruits to the room the next day, warm and ready. We stayed for 2 nights, and on the day we left, we applied for a late check-out. Alla also personally sent customers to the lobby to wait for the bus, and even more pleasantly, gave a small gift. Wow, the current service is great too, thank you very much.

The scenery of Westin is also very beautiful, the garden-style landscape, the river swimming pool, you can kayak, and the photos are also beautiful. Seeing many young ladies taking pictures there, it’s beautiful. The only suggestion is that the elevator signs are not clear enough. The elevator is very hidden. If you live inside, you need to walk through a long passage. It is particularly important to find the nearest elevator.

msg:The hotel is located near Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, a five-minute walk away. Then the front desk helped to upgrade to a sea-view room. The room is large and the decoration is simple and generous. The only regret is that the room facilities are relatively old. This can be improved. Besides, the overall feeling is very good. The service as a star hotel is the most important. You can experience this very well in Westin. Special thanks to the VIP for receiving alla to contact us one day in advance, take the initiative + WeChat, and be responsive. The hotel’s swimming pool, breakfast are very good, it’s close to the beach, and the playground is great for bringing kids!

msg:During the Mid-Autumn Festival, escape from the stress and oppression of big cities and come to Sanya, a place full of greenery for vacation. Westin’s equipment and facilities belong to the modern high-end heavy metal style, which is in sharp contrast with the bad reviews seen by Xiaohongshu. It is obviously a great five-star hotel, and the accommodation experience is very high. Especially the bathtub in that room is extremely friendly to the neck, with a very ergonomic curvature, which can relax the cervical spine when taking a bath. By the way, breakfast is well received, and it is well received by a 10-minute walk from the duty-free shop, but you must do good sun protection, btw, the beach hammock is very comfortable, suitable for watching the sea and listening to the waves.

msg:This time I came to Sanya and chose the Westin Sanya. I met the butler from Chongqing fellow alla. He arranged the room for me in advance. Duan Jiangjie at the front desk also helped me with luggage and introduced hotel facilities. There is a duty-free shop next to it, and it’s very close to the room. Close to the duty-free shop, there is construction noise at night, but closing the windows has little effect. The hotel is too big, a little suggestion can add some shuttle buses or signs. The hotel has a shuttle bus to the airport, there are four buses a day, you need to make a reservation one day in advance, and it is very convenient to go to the airport. There are several swimming pools in the hotel, especially the river swimming pool and the infinity swimming pool, which are very suitable for punching in and taking pictures. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose the Westin Sanya.

msg:My favorite of Marriott’s hotels is Westin. Ever since I first saw the sea and Westin in Shimei Bay in Wanning, I will never forget it. This is the first time I stayed at the Minsheng Westin Hotel in Haitang District. It was originally based on my love for this brand, so I didn't particularly understand the facilities in this Westin store before booking. The little girl Wang Xinyu from the hotel’s customer relations depar**ent contacted me one day before check-in to ask about special requirements and other related matters. I originally booked a two-bedroom pool suite on Ctrip, but the little girl Xinyu was very considerate to help me upgrade to it for free. The single-family pool villa 🏡 rooms are very spacious, the upper and lower floors are designed to accommodate 4 people at the same time, and each room has a separate bathroom and a public bathroom in the living room. The experience of staying in is very comfortable. Each room has a swimming pool upstairs and downstairs. Whether it is swimming or playing in the water, it is very comfortable and private. Recommending friends for family or business trips will really make you feel that it is worthwhile.
The overall area of the hotel is very large, and the public swimming pool area is not as cute and interesting as the children's area. The photos taken by the Internet celebrity swimming pool and river are super-feeling. It is recommended that ladies and sisters make an appoin**ent to take a trip to the hotel to experience it.
Let's talk about the hotel breakfast. The breakfast room is located near the swimming pool. My sense of orientation is a bit bad. The surrounding environment is very good. It is really too comfortable to enjoy a day's breakfast with the sea breeze, coconut trees and sunshine. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the breakfast category is a bit monotonous, I hope it can be improved.
Location: The hotel is next to the duty-free shop, and it is only a five-minute walk away. After dinner, strolling through the duty-free shop is really good for digestion and stress 😂
All in all, this Westin hotel trip to Xinyu, the little girl, really gave me a perfect check-in experience. Every detail is very considerate. I will contact the battery car to pick up and drop off the car. I will take pictures in the swimming pool and contact Xinyu immediately after falling into the water. Asking the service staff to send me a bathrobe, and intimately asked if I need ginger soup for fear that I would catch a cold, it really made me feel at home. In addition, the hotel room has a sample set of Estee Lauder. Because it was two girls staying in, I contacted the little beauty of Xinyu to ask if I could send another set. The room manager Bu Yingxiang delivered it to the room personally, and the service was very good. If it weren't for the Westin in Wanning, I would really like to stay here for a few more days. It is really a perfect hotel for leisure and entertainment. I recommend everyone to contact Wang Xinyu's little beauty when staying. It will really make your staying experience perfect ❤️

The little brother Tom from the concierge was very enthusiastic. We arrived in the room and waited for the luggage but there was an episode in the middle (my friend has asthma. There is a refurbished furniture in the room, which smells like paint. My friend wants to change a room and call the front desk. It was very considerate to change us. For the room on the higher floor, I also gave 2 to choose from 👍 too sweet) The little brother Tom who sent the luggage waited with us for a long time, and he didn’t send the card.

The character is also witty and humor. It is really a fun soul. Too warm and like it ☺️☺️☺️
The next day, when I saw me at the duty-free shop, I didn’t forget to tell me that I can get a 5% discount for reservations. Although it’s useless, but I really feel cared to be so caring. When I feel like a friend, I don’t forget to ask me if I’m having fun. Having such good staff is definitely one of the reasons why I will choose this hotel next time
In addition, the gift package of this hotel is really cost-effective. The photographer in the hotel is really awesome and took you as an ins internet celebrity in minutes. In short, next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Westin and I will love it. 💛💜💙👍 👍👍

msg:Taking advantage of Xiao Long's hypothesis to arrange a family trip, the originally scheduled Macau tour was temporarily changed to Sanya due to the epidemic, but this "little accident" gave our family a great surprise. My husband and I did not have much time to do hotel homework because of the temporary change of travel destination. After reading the little red book, we were attracted by Westin's rainforest pool and infinity pool, so we decided to book.

[Room] Five stars
Because this trip also coincides with our wedding anniversary, I made a note when booking. The hotel housekeeper, Mrs. Fu Huan, thoughtfully upgraded all three of our suites to deluxe king-size bed rooms, and prepared cribs and cribs for the baby. Gift box for children.
The room is very spacious and clean. It is cleaned at least twice a day. The bathtub is also equipped with a disposable bathtub cover, so the baby can take a bath in it is super comfortable. The Sanya westin room is designed with great care. The bathroom part adopts dry and wet separation, and the difference is that the floor is not marble, it is a kind of rock-like design, and the floor for bathing the baby is water. Don’t worry about slipping.

【Service】Five-star
The hotel housekeeper, Ms. Fu Huan, confirmed by calling and added WeChat one day before check-in, and booked us a 5% discount on duty-free shops in advance. She also recommended many places to eat for us on the first day of check-in, even during her vacation. , Is also a message in seconds, all questions are answered. This may be my best service experience in a domestic hotel.

[Breakfast] Five stars
The breakfast was very hearty. On the first day, the baby liked to eat knife-cut steamed buns. On the second day, there was no knife-cutting for the meal. He raised a mouth with the chef. I didn’t expect the chef to steam some for the baby very enthusiastically. Thank you so much.

【Facilities】Five-star
At the beginning, I was worried that the filters of Xiaohongshu bloggers would make the hotel look good, but in fact it is really beautiful! In the happy gift pack, you can play kayaking for one hour every day for free, as well as cycling, etc. Children aged 3-12 can also participate in the Westin Big Player Children's activities. Every day is different and super rich.

I highly recommend everyone to come to Sanya to book Westin.

The Internet celebrity pool is so beautiful, you can shoot blockbusters casually, and Manli's impression photography technology is also great, which is very suitable for punching in.
The hotel has a private beach with few people and beautiful scenery, so it is suitable for children to dig sand at the seaside. At night, I saw little crabs 🦀️
Finally, the hotel service is very considerate. Thanks again to the butler who received us, alla, for his thoughtful service and quick replenishment of supplies. I am very satisfied!
I just hope that the equipment in the room can be improved next time
Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Westin Hotel.

The free travel shots of Manmo provided by the hotel are very good, and free really does not mean that the provided travel shots go through the process and look like. On the contrary, the photographer is very serious. Although the gift is 5 photos and a photo frame without an electronic version, the shooting quality and service are really very good. If you are satisfied with the game, you will consume it and give it a thumbs up.

The river swimming pool is a major feature of the hotel. You can take pictures with paddle boards. How to take pictures is beautiful! The garden scenery is also pretty good, and the photos are also pretty nice. The breakfast style is complete and rich in variety. It is the sea on Haitang Bay where you can’t go swimming. You can only play in shallow places and dig sand. The hotel’s housekeeper Grace service is also very good and attentive. Recommended!

Our Ctrip order only included one breakfast (very speechless). Seeing that we were embarrassed, Grace immediately offered to help us apply for an extra breakfast, and she did what she said! After check-in, I also helped us to book a kayaking project, coordinate late check-out, let the kitchen prepare ginger soup, etc., almost responsive, very considerate. In addition, the hotel’s swimming pool is also a highlight. The typhoon can’t stop everyone’s enthusiasm. There are also kayaking and electric water skis in the swimming pool. It’s very lively. Don't want to stay in the room quietly 😅 It's also very convenient to walk to the duty-free shop at night for shopping or eating, in short, great value for money!

I’ve done a lot of things for me. I told him that the feelings and needs of staying in are basically satisfied. I feel that the hotel has a lot of training for staff services. Although Westin is relatively old in Haitang Bay, The service is still great, Westin is the first choice for a holiday

Location and transportation: The location is next to the core area of Haitang Bay and you can walk directly to the Sanya Duty Free Shop. It is very convenient to take a taxi or rent a car, but it is not so convenient if you want to go out to eat or buy something.
Swimming pool: I have to say that Westin’s unique self-built tropical rainforest and the jungle and river are very long. There are various glass boats and kayaks to find a position and angle that suits you. There are many people and many children in the afternoon. Very out of film.
Room facilities: The room facilities are not particularly new and need to be improved. Overall it is still possible. I hope that I can upgrade it next time in the off-season.

The receptionist alla contacted in advance to arrange the room the day before check-in. During the whole stay, Alla solved many problems for us, thank you very much. But one day in the middle of the night, the air conditioner will suddenly make louder noises, and I hope to improve it.

After staying one night, she will inform us of many precautions and upgrade the room type. The ocean-view room has a bathtub with a bath, and the toilet and shower room are also separated. There is also a separate cloakroom. The balcony has a good view and sunshine. The drinks in the refrigerator are also provided for free. In the afternoon, I don’t have any negatives, but I’m happy to take five photos and a table. Infinity pool It is only open from 15:00-19:00, and you have to buy a drink at the bar next to it to go in and take pictures. The curve swimming pool is open until 10 o'clock. If you need to use flamingos and kayaks, you also need 100 yuan. The hourly rental fee and the breakfast for the next day are quite generous. There are many types, but I feel that this hotel is a bit invisible, but the others are quite satisfactory.

The buffet for breakfast and dinner is quite rich, and barbecued seafood is also available. If you choose an all-inclusive entertainment package, it is still very cost-effective. The location of the hotel is very good, basically in the middle of Haitang Bay, next to the duty-free shop, not far from Atlantis Water World, just walk past it. The check-in procedure is simple and convenient, and there are many entertainment items to send. Including free drink water in the guest room, the price of charged drinks will be clearly marked, so that customers can rest assured that the overall price/performance ratio is still very good.
The hotel is arc-shaped and the corridor is very long. Although there are only nine floors, there are many rooms. The first floor is a pool room, and the top floor is a presidential suite with a fixed net swimming pool. I really like this hotel, I will choose to stay in the future if I have the opportunity.
It is recommended to press a few plugs at the head of the bed and it is not convenient at all, otherwise the charging is uncomfortable in the middle of the night. The service is very good.

But the day before I went to the hotel, my impression changed immediately. The housekeeper Alla Tang was on the first afternoon. After carefully understanding how many people are staying and what their needs are, when they know there are children, they immediately inform that there is a bedside service. After 1330 in the lobby, Alla immediately came out to guide the reservation and gave the children a toy to attract his attention. To reduce the child's discomfort, the first priority was also arranged to move in, which made people very heartwarming. After entering the two-bedroom suite, I saw two interconnected bedrooms, each with a 2m bed, enough for a family with children or the elderly. The balcony is an interconnected balcony, and the scenery is also very beautiful. A five-day journey I am very satisfied with staying in Westin, especially to call our housekeeper Alla

Because I took everyone out for a trip, I helped arrange a location not far from the same floor. Introduce nearby places to play, help arrange a free airport shuttle bus, and give time suggestions. Hanna service is not bad!

msg:Thank you very much Damon. This trip has been paying attention to us from the beginning of the reservation, asking about the time of arrival, reminding us to book a duty-free shop discount, which is very comfortable. The day passed because of the end of the game, and it was past 6 o'clock in the afternoon at the hotel. Damon had already upgraded the room type for us when we checked in. It was a big surprise! It also succinctly informed us of the opening hours of various areas of our hotel, such as the infinity pool and the restaurant. The rooms are spacious and bright, and the decoration is very good. The fruits are fresh and varied, and snacks such as chocolate nuts are also given, which is very attentive. The hotel’s Japanese restaurant and Chinese restaurant are of good level, and the Japanese set meals have too much carbon water, haha, but because of the set meals, the quality is still good. Also, the attitude of the hotel staff is very good, making people feel at home. A great experience, next time I stay at Haitang Bay, I will choose Westin.

I booked a deluxe double room. Ella of VIP contacted me in advance, knowing that we are planning a birthday outing, and specially helped to upgrade the panoramic sea view room! Also prepared a cake intimately!
During the stay, Ella also asks if there are any needs on WeChat at any time, and also helps to make reservations for duty-free shop discounts and pick-ups in time. In addition, we are going to surf and intimately help introduce which shops will be more affordable and better! ! ! For this service, I gave Westin a full mark!
At the same time, the location is great. After dinner in the evening, there is a duty-free shop next door. ! By the way, the food produced in the hotel is quite good, but now the cafeteria is not open, so lunch and dinner have become set meals. It's a pity~~ I hope I can make up next time🥰🥰

Because we live on weekdays and there are fewer guests, the teacher made margarita cookies, played African drums, drew paintings, made two small crafts, foam parties, beach guards, and a few I signed up but didn't go, the whole process was still very happy. There are slides, trampolines, and simple expansion projects in the children's area. It's just that there is really no way to stay outdoors because of the weather. It's too hot and too dry. Kayaking or canoeing for 1 hour; this project is a big love, the kayaking on the first day, four people a boat, to be honest, it was very heavy and boring to move, and then it was changed to a paddle board, it was fun in an instant, and then every day Staying on the paddle board, my sister twisted and wriggled from the beginning to later she was able to paddle back and forth smoothly by herself.

I also came to Westin Minsheng again with infinite expectations for the hotel (have been here twice). But the hotel really did not disappoint me. Before check-in, Mrs. Alla, the VIP commissioner, called to ask about check-in requirements, and applied for discounts at the duty-free shop in advance, knowing that I had arranged to send my birthday cake in advance for my birthday 🎂 (placed in the room when I checked in), the floor of the room reserved for me I like the view and the scenery 💕! Miss Alla asked in advance if I was going to check out late when I was about to leave the store. I was very touched by this series of warm and thoughtful services! More than that, the service staff everywhere in the hotel will actively greet and ask "Hello"! The concierge and receptionist were also very helpful and thoughtful. I didn't close the door because my luggage was not fastened. The enthusiastic little brother took the initiative to lay my luggage. It was really heartwarming! On my birthday, I went to the hotel for breakfast, and the restaurant gave me a birthday cake. It was a big surprise. Thank you for the warm and thoughtful service of the hotel! Although the hotel has been in operation for a long time, the facilities and equipment are well maintained, clean and tidy, the park environment is very good, the scenery is beautiful, the entertainment facilities are complete, the duty-free shopping is convenient, the transportation is convenient, and the main thing is good service. This is my current situation. I have stayed in the hotel with the best service. In short, the hotel’s various management tasks are well done. This is where other hotels should learn. There are too many places to be praised. I look forward to staying at this hotel again!

Taking advantage of the convenient stage when the child is still in kindergarten asking for leave, I want to take her to play more on the wrong peak. I lived in Yalong Bay in August last year and the unit team building in April this year. I want to try another bay this time. When I chose the hotel before, I wanted to live in Westin Haitang Bay, because the swimming pool and river channel here are really beautiful.

The cause of the epidemic + the staggered trip, the hotel occupancy rate was only 30%, and it naturally rose to sea-view rooms. Hotel reception manager Elina Fuhuan called me the day before I arrived to contact me for any needs. After I arrived, I was also warmly greeted. WeChat contact every day during my stay. Tips and recommendations of nearby restaurants, really thoughtful!

Would you go to the same hotel for the same sale? I certainly will!

Thank you Westin for giving us a wonderful holiday! !

There are also bubble pools, Internet celebrity rivers, and infinity swimming pools, which can satisfy you for all kinds of shooting. The most important thing is that the travel shots presented by the hotel are really great, professional and careful, and they are taken under the guidance of the photographer.

Elina Fuhuan contacted me at the first time, took the initiative to upgrade to a sea-view room, kindly asked me when to arrive in the store, etc., and prepared a bunch of small gifts for the children according to our needs, and encountered some small problems in the middle. Very active, serious and timely resolution.
🍃Environment: Westin’s greenery is really good. You can watch a green garden during the day, listen to the scattered frogs at night, and look at the starry sky. It is very quiet and private. And how can such a good greening be free of mosquitoes. 😄

The river swimming pool and the infinity swimming pool have excellent scenery. Although we happened to meet the river swimming pool to change the water (it takes three or four days), it was a pity that we didn't play it, but it couldn't stop its beauty. The waves on the beach are not big and there are security guards who keep guarding, which is also very good.

It’s a short walk to the duty-free shop. It’s really too close. Buying, buying and eating is absolutely nothing.
The Beiye Planetarium is still relatively large and there are plenty of activities every day. Unfortunately, there are too few people affected by the epidemic. The two activities are one-on-one 😅.
The breakfast was quite satisfactory, with everything that was supposed to be, and the taste was not bad. What's better is the kind greetings from the restaurant manager, as well as extra flower cakes, macarons, and fruit plates.

Because of the epidemic, I didn't dare to play everywhere, I can only find entertainment in the hotel, the scheduled pool room, the room opens the door to swim at any time, the children and adults are free to relax, mainly to avoid the crowd, the water quality of the pool is very clean and clear, filtering and disinfecting is very timely, The room is clean and comfortable, the hotel has all the entertainment facilities, and you can have fun in the hotel. Many are still free. The restaurant is the first day of dining. From the environment to the quality of the dishes to the service, the ingredients are very fresh and the aftertaste is endless. We are very reassured by the butler service of Westin. The VIP's Ella is accompanied all the way, and we have to answer questions, professional patience, and we have solved many problems in time. The next stay is still the first choice of Westin. I hope to maintain the standard and bring more people an unforgettable stay.

The water pressure on the second floor is small and the hot water is long. The water from the bathtub is actually yellow. Air conditioning is on the bed to blow the noise does not say very big, closet door open directly collapsed down really old enough, hotel business travel team activities a lot of meetings in and out of the staff. It is really close to the duty-free shop. I like to buy things. I hope that the hotel service awareness can be improved. The daily food is good, but the waiter will not remind you to order too much food waste. We are full of a table. Afternoon tea is good, guests can also receive the villa jas randall kit.

Because the price is also quite high, I refused. The younger brother said he would upgrade me a room for free. As soon as I opened the door, I was dumbfounded (Picture 1), what the hell was a free upgrade. Fortunately, I met Grace, the beautiful caring housekeeper, who helped me deal with the problem immediately, and then really upgraded the sea view room for free. Stayed for 2 consecutive nights, the housekeeper has always been enthusiastic service, the hotel environment is so comfortable, the children love it very much.

The environment is first class, the only need to improve is the diet, breakfast is general, may be the reason for the large number of people, the temperature inside is high, while eating while sweating, this is still embarrassing. Maybe it is the hotel's rule. At first, because there is no seat, I chose an empty table to sit down. I ate later and found that the seat next to the cold wind machine was empty. I want to say that I would like to sit in a cool place. As a result, the girl who cleaned the table told me that I had already booked it. There is no way to stay in a different seat, but it is not, because there are still people who are moving from other places, think fast eat away and nothing more, this can be improved even more perfect.

In the end, the small bed in the room was actually a sofa and it was not prepared. There are quilts for children. And there are no small tents that are still playing. The room is very simple and looks very uncomfortable. Isn't the family room also prepared for children's toiletries? I called and sent these things later. And the toilet. I was really speechless in a small cubicle. There is no exhaust fan in it. If you poop, you can't enter the toilet at all. The experience is super bad. I will definitely not stay again next time.

After adding WeChat, I arranged an appoin**ent with a duty-free shop in advance and introduced various children to have fun. There are not many people who swim during the day, and there are almost no people in the swimming pool near the sea.

The hotel specially furnished the room, delivered small cakes, and free drinks from the minibar! The hotel has a great environment, with coconut groves everywhere and swimming pools, especially the river swimming pool taking pictures very beautifully! Everyone in the hotel is very friendly, unlike some hotel staff who are ferocious and impatient! The hotel is also very close to the beach, and there are not many people. The coconut grove, sea breeze, and sandy beach made me feel like a long-lost and peaceful holiday! In the evening, I specially sent us lavender essential oil in the room, which is a good sleep blessing, which makes people feel especially intimate in an instant! The hotel butler also gave us a few small gifts when we checked out! Unfortunately, because we have booked the air tickets for the next day, we have to go back to the duty-free shop to buy something! Otherwise, you can also participate in the planetary summer camp for children there, many of which are free! Better than the parent-child hotel we stayed a few nights ago! I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Westin Hotel, thank you for making our holiday so wonderful! See you next time!

The Westin Hotel in Haitang Bay, Sanya is so beautiful, especially the river course and the infinity pool on the top of the building. It is full of sense of luxury for a casual shot!! Wall crack recommended!!
Let me talk about the most fun and beautiful rainforest river in the hotel. Rent a board or rent a kayak to take pictures. It doesn't matter if you can't swim. The water is very shallow and only about 1.3 meters, so you don't have to be afraid of falling into the water. It would be better if the hotel’s hardware facilities were more complete

He suggested that everyone go around 9 o'clock. There are few people and the light is good, so you can take beautiful pictures.

Go up and take a picture, have an afternoon tea, and relax. Remember to make an appoin**ent in advance. The paddle board of the swimming pool is also one of the must-checks.
You can choose a transparent glass boat or paddle board. The most intimate thing is that there are photographers in the hotel!
If you need it, you can make arrangements with the hotel in advance

When staying in this kind of hotel, we usually eat directly in the restaurant so that we can best experience the service and food of the hotel. The hotel has Chinese and Western food choices to meet everyone's various needs.
The Chinese Element Restaurant and the Japanese Restaurant Dance Restaurant are both very good for dinner, and you can also choose their barbecue buffet.

I stayed here for one night this time, and I will come over with my family next time~

The housekeeper Wang Xinyu gave very considerate service from before check-in to check-out. Although the hotel is a bit old, this kind of service completely compensates for this problem;
The floor attendants come to clean every day, and each time they intimately leave small gifts to the little pot friends, which brings surprises to the children;

The hotel’s children’s center and swimming pool meet the needs of children of different ages, and the hotel is very close to the beach. The dolls spent three days and two nights in the hotel happily.

Next time I come to Sanya, I will continue to choose Westin, because the children have not played enough

msg:In order to go to the duty-free shop, I found the nearest one. It was indeed very close. I walked for a few minutes. Because my time was too tight, I left in a hurry, but the beautiful and comfortable environment of the hotel left a deep impression on me. Impression, next time I come to stay for a few more days, I would like to thank the staff of your hotel, Wang Xinyu, little sister, who is kind and thoughtful. Before coming, I took the initiative to contact and help me book a duty-free shop discount, care about the itinerary, and remind me from time to time, because I am late, more than 10 pm To book the bus to the airport tomorrow, she actually arranged it for me in seconds. What touched me the most was that I was back home today, and she kindly sent greetings. I will choose your hotel next time with her.

msg:The internet celebrity swimming lane of the internet celebrity hotel is still very nice to take pictures. Children like to play, the swimming pool is clean, there are many activities for children every day, and it is good to bring the baby. For the total set of afternoon tea provided by the reservation, you must make a reservation a few days in advance by the rooftop infinity pool, otherwise you can only sit in the room below, and you can also go up and take pictures. The travel photos I sent were very awkward. I only sent paper photos. I wanted to buy 45 copies of the electronic version. Other hotels sent the electronic version. This made me lose points. The room has been upgraded to a family ocean view room. The room is good, clean and tidy, and the view is very good. It is a long time to wait for the room. The hotel arrived at 1 pm, and I only checked in at 5 o’clock. There is no air conditioning in the lobby, and the wait is super hot. There is a certain distance from the beach, anyway, I was very broken when walking in the sun, and I couldn't swim on the beach.

msg:Being separated from the duty-free shop is a geographical advantage! One side is close to the duty-free shop, and the other side is the Addison and Atlantis. Construction is underway next to the duty-free shop. The non-seaview double room booked is facing the construction site. The construction was carried out in bits and pieces at midnight on the first night. At 11 o’clock on the second night, the construction site was brightly lit and in full swing. I called the hotel reception desk and was told It was a government project. The hotel was unable to do anything. When I checked in, I did not inform me that there was construction nearby. After that, I called the 12345 convenience hotline. The relevant depar**ent responded that the project failed to obtain a night construction permit and has been suspended. The hotel was informed the next day, and then the hotel proposed to change rooms. Regardless of these noises, the hotel environment is still very good. The waiter on the floor took the initiative to add WeChat and contacted whenever needed. The hotel’s pool production rate is also very high, and the breakfast is a bit crowded, but the dishes taste good. Traveling with children is convenient and fast. The hotel is about 45 minutes away from the airport by taxi, and the hotel also has a regular shuttle bus.

The hotel swimming is convenient and well-equipped. It is very convenient to make a reservation for travel shooting. The affordable photos are all very good.

msg:After choosing a hotel in Sanya for a long time, I resolutely chose the Westin in Haitang Bay. I found that the choice was very correct. The service, facilities, and various experiences are the best among the five-star hotels we have stayed in so far. First of all, the Internet celebrity Hedao is well-deserved, and at any rate it is a blockbuster film. The children's various activities are colorful, children are happy, and parents worry-free. The name of the travel photography service is "Panda Jihua". The photographers are patient and professional. We are very satisfied with the photos. Finally, I would like to focus on complimenting our housekeeper, Chelseanh, who warmly contacted us before we set off, including children's supplies, room arrangements and other dedicated services. After moving in, we have always felt the warmth of home with all kinds of care and care. Even when we arrived at the next hotel, Chelseanh kept contacting us due to rain to see if it was safe to arrive. Our whole family was very moved. I hope Chelseanh's work goes smoothly, Panda Jihua is getting better and better, and goodbye to Westin!

The breakfast is good, there are many varieties, and I personally feel that the price is high. The taste is also good. The accommodation environment and service attitude are standard, and it is recommended. Although the decoration takes a long time, the TV needs to be updated. In addition, the room does not have a USB charging port. Very inconvenient . The waiter Wang Shuhong is very clean every time. In the evening, he will prepare essential oils and drinking water carefully. It feels so warm every time I go back. The supervisor Wang Hairong has been with us throughout the whole process from the day we checked in. Especially warm and thoughtful. Thank you every time Attentive reminder!

The hotel specializes in one-to-one butler service. Before check-in, Wang Xinyu, the housekeeper, contacted me in advance and added WeChat. If you don’t understand, you can find her directly, hehe. The environment of the hotel is great. There is a pool room and a private beach. The photo shooting is very beautiful. Each one is very suitable for the scene. I am very satisfied with this, and I am very pleased that I have not picked the wrong hotel. 😘
The hotel also gave away a lot of parent-child amusement projects, you can make an appoin**ent in advance to experience. The location is very close to the duty-free shop, only a five-minute walk away, convenient for shopping and eating👍
The hotel has a free shuttle bus between the hotel and Phoenix Airport every day, you need to make an appoin**ent in advance, or you can contact Xinyu in advance.
I stayed in Hainan for a total of three nights, two nights in a deluxe twin room and one night in a poolside pool room. The customer service manager Bu Yingxiang cleaned it very cleanly, making the trip very enjoyable.
Finally, I made a small comment, maybe because the hotel is a little old, the plug, the electric fan, and the scale are a bit broken, but the housekeeper will help me solve it immediately! The speed thief is fast.
Hope to come here again next time.

The suite also provided swimming rings and boating projects. The children especially liked swimming and would not go back to the room after soaking in the water. Let’s talk about service. Manager Xinyu started to contact me before I checked in. He still asked us what we need every day. The weather was hot and arranged to send a lot of water. Room service Zhou Xiaoxia and supervisor Sun Shuangmei are very friendly and the service is very meticulous and patient.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times and stayed in Haitang Bay for the first time. After comparing many hotels, I finally chose Westin. Although I have seen many comments on Westin that are not very good, it seems that the hotel has replaced the original management team, so the service concept and quality have been improved a lot, and the final check-in experience is very good.
1. We are staying in a family ocean view room, the room is spacious and bright, with separate toilet, shower room, cloakroom, removable partition, convenient to isolate the space when washing. On the first day of check-in, a housekeeper supervised the cleaning quality of the room, and proactively provided contact information to inform that you can contact and solve the problem in time if necessary, and gave the children a plush toy
2. The hotel swimming pool is a highlight, winding twists and turns, there are countless large and small swimming pools, kayaks or transparent boats and other items are delivered as soon as the room is booked. It is very suitable for taking pictures. Many tourists have booked trips and it is indeed very easy to take a large view. It is recommended Prepare easy-to-release swimsuits in advance! The swimming pool is 130cm deep, so it’s safer for children to play and play
3. Room service: hotel rooms are cleaned 2-3 times a day, ice bar soft drinks are provided, multiple bottles of mineral water are provided, and more water is notified; children’s bathrobes, slippers and toiletries are provided proactively; a free welcome is provided for the first night of stay Bin fruit, spring gift box, and lavender essential oil carefully prepared, the details are very careful
4. Catering: The breakfast variety is relatively rich, there are Hainan special snacks such as Qingliangbu, Lingshui acid powder, Houan powder, coconut rice, etc., and the variety is adjusted every day; the set meal comes with bbq seafood buffet dinner, we ordered coconut water hot pot, The main category is seafood, including barbecue sashimi, western food, Cantonese cuisine, etc. The sashimi is fresh, the open-fire roast duck tastes good, and the fruit variety is rich; the restaurant manager Liu Yong also personally delivered a glass of coconut water to each person, the service is enthusiastic and proactive, and the waiter Li Chunmei understands carefully Our dining experience and evaluation
5. The butler MARK must be recommended. The housekeeper MARK took the initiative to contact us one day before check-in and provided us with an absolutely considerate butler service. I prepared sand digging tools and swimming laps for us in advance. When we checked in, we took the initiative to come to the front desk to take us to the guest room. We offered welcome fruits on the first night; the children in the children's entertainment center were treated by the concierge and had a great time. Happy; because Dabao is over 12 years old, and the items included in the package have age restrictions, mark took the initiative to coordinate and solve it for us; learned that the 1:30 shuttle bus will go to the airport, in order to avoid the children's boat ride and late check-out for us, we must like it!
The hotel has a large garden area, and you can feel the island style in the hotel. It is 5 minutes away from the duty-free shop and the beach. It is worthwhile to come to Haitang Bay to stay in Westin. Recommended!

To praise the hotel again, the first is that the swimming pool is really excellent, like a tropical rainforest, you must rent a canoe for a good paddling, and then go for a walk in the water, super beautiful swimming pool.
The hotel’s western restaurant and Japanese restaurant have clocked in. The western restaurant’s evening buffet is very good, and there are resident singers. The Japanese restaurant tastes very good. It is recommended to go.
The young photographer is very good to make an appoin**ent, very good at instructing postures, very good at grasping the camera, excellent, photography customer service Sun Ce Xiaobawang, everyone can praise her, there may be surprises, she is an excellent customer service lady.

The hotel’s environment is great, the outdoor space is large enough, and there is plenty of walking and strolling. In addition to the winding swimming pool surrounding the park, there is also a separate beach swimming pool, and the private beach is also fine with sand and clear water. It is very suitable for people who are purely resting at the scenic spot, including fewer children, which is also an advantage. Basically, except for breakfast, there are not many situations where children get together, Amitabha~
The service is also attentive. The confirmation before leaving, the follow-up on the day, and the meticulous reception at check-in all make people feel attentive and comfortable!
The fly in the oin**ent is that the guest room is full these days, and the platinum room has not been upgraded.
In addition, after all, the hotel has been taking a long time, and some details of the hardware facilities need to be upgraded. For example, the bathtub and hand basin are not so good, for example, the charging sockets are loose and there are few and no USB ports, for example, the toilet is offensive.

The service attitude of all the hotel staff is very good, especially the little brother Calvin, the young lady iris at the front desk, and the cleaning aunt He Dongmei.
   🧡We brought the elderly to play, with wheelchairs and a pile of luggage. Luggage brother Calvin always helped push the luggage, unload the truck, load the truck, and walk a long distance to help us deliver the luggage to the room. Very patient, and often smiling, people are in a good mood to see. 😂
  🧡 This time I booked a pool room a few days ago, it is so comfortable and beautiful.
🧡 Push open the floor-to-ceiling door and it is the swimming pool. Very concealed. There is no need to swim with many people in the public pool. Especially suitable for the elderly and children. Because you can go back to the room to take a shower and change clothes immediately after you swim.
   🧡Special thanks to the front desk lady Iris for helping me change to a beautiful sea view room halfway through. There are many guests in the hotel, and I have a particularly good location. The room is really awesome. Iris is very reliable, good personality, and careful
🧡Procter & Gamble Aunt He also kept contacting me, asking me if I needed anything. Once I needed to wash my clothes at night, and even came here to get dirty clothes to wash for me. Thank you very much. Everyone needs to choose the house spree, because it includes the glass boat for the main swimming pool, the paddle board and the like at the original price of 100 per hour, and the house is free to play! enjoyed a lot! Take pictures too! I said that the hotel’s service attitude is not good, but I cannot understand it. The waitresses at breakfast are very nice! Help me make coffee, help me push the wheelchair! It can't be great anymore, okay!
     🧡Recommend everyone to look for the travel shots in the Westin Hotel! ! ! The scenery inside the hotel is so beautiful, especially the river near the swimming pool, it feels like Southeast Asia in a second. But my own mobile phone shots are actually not ideal. Look for the team of photographers in the hotel. They have good equipment and angles, as well as drones and the like. Everyone can make a blockbuster! ! ! When I went there, I saw a lot of internet celebrities looking for them to shoot. The photos taken are really beautiful.
    🧡The photographers are all great. The photographers who photographed me are Arlene and Xiaoyu. Both are very patient and will listen to your suggestions and find the best angle and posture for you! Very, very, very popular! Push! ! ! ! ! The photographer was very considerate. He also brought sunscreen and helped with the bag. In short, this trip was a surprise. Sure enough, the photographers in Westin know Westin best.

Invincible sea view, perfect seaside restaurant, special swimming pool and comfortable beach, as well as caring and warm hotel services. After Chen Yurong, the receptionist of the hotel, learned that this was my honeymoon trip, she not only helped us arrange a high-floor room, but also helped to contact the guest room to arrange it specially. In the follow-up, after consulting some questions such as hotel services and carrying luggage, we also answered and dealt with them in time for us, and the sense of service was particularly good. The sea view room also meets our requirements. Standing on the balcony is the endless blue sky and sea. The long swimming lane in the hotel environment is very distinctive. Because we were too lazy, we ate directly at the hotel’s open-air beach restaurant. The ingredients were fresh and the price was not too expensive. In addition, the open-air restaurant on the beach side of the hotel had a special feeling, and there were local folk singers singing. In addition, my wife went to the spa at night, and I heard that it felt good. It was a very good hotel experience, next time I want to experience the pool room or live in a villa with my family.

When we checked in, Luo Jing added WeChat to see that we were traveling as a couple. She arranged a sea-view room for us. It was very considerate. During the shop, we can contact her at any time if we need help. The service is very good.

msg:There will be a special hotel staff phone call the day before I check in. The clerk who contacted me is called Matthew. The service is very attentive. I went to travel during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. It may be quite popular. I can only check in after the stipulated 15 o'clock.
In time for my birthday, I asked the hotel to send a cake that weighs about a pound. The picture of the cake is shown in the picture. The breakfast at the hotel is great. I don’t know if it can also maintain the standard of holidays. I went to the place at 8 o’clock and it was very empty. Good seats, great outdoor environment, no mosquitoes were encountered in the morning, and there were a lot of people after nine o'clock, and there were still queues at the door.
The hotel is very big and you can walk directly to the beach. The swimming pool of the hotel is very big and you can row a boat in it. The boating project is easy to learn and fun
Overall the hotel feels good 👍

msg:The Westin Sanya Haitang Bay I gave the evaluation of yyds. Service is definitely the vane of a five-star hotel. Every employee I met with a smile on his face, to achieve the ultimate service. After getting off the bus, the concierge enthusiastically opened the door, helped with the luggage, and sent the room directly. Check out directly to the room card to exempt customers from waiting, praise. Although there are many people at the hotel’s breakfast, the hotel staff arranges the seats in an orderly manner, which is not so noisy. The dinner buffet barbecue also has singers in residence, and the environment and taste are first-class. The beach is very clean and there are many crabs at night, suitable for bringing children. The reception supervisor, Fu Huan, was attentive and thoughtful. He contacted us the first day to arrange the room. Originally, we could check in at 3pm. We checked in before 12 noon. He also booked us a 5% off duty-free shop. In addition to the daily weather notification and meal time arrangements, I also don't forget to give away a fruit platter. Answer all questions on WeChat and answer all requests. The shop also helped us to check out late. I was impressed, thank you very much! One hundred points praise. The room service took the initiative to inquire about the needs and provided a set of spare parts, and also gave a lot of mineral water according to our requirements, which was well received. Next time you come to Sanya, you will still choose Westin!

msg:I took a family of five with my in-laws for the first time on a group trip. I was afraid that I would not be able to take care of the elderly. I saw a lot of hotels. Westin’s bad reviews made me hesitate, but I accidentally read a comment saying that all aspects of the service should be improved , Is also owned by Marriott, and staying in the Beiye Planet Park with travel shooting + children is set. It turns out to be a pleasant trip➕ accommodation.
On June 10th, when we arrived in Sanya, we called the hotel and needed to be picked up one day in advance, and it was a bus, so we gave up. Jessie Fu Shubi at the front desk of the hotel explained the terms and conditions patiently and added me to WeChat. She also found us a room with a nice view. She told me that if you have any questions during the stay, you can contact her, and you need to make an appoin**ent. You can also tell her one day in advance. On the third day of our stay on June 12, we asked for a trip and a glass boat. Those few days happened to be a typhoon day. Jessie told me that everyone had an appoin**ent on the 13th. We originally came on the trip and came early on the 14th. After leaving, Xiaofu called me to get in touch, and he solved the problem as soon as possible, and the manager of the travel shoot arranged for us until the next morning. Then there was a lot of people when we chartered the boat. The staff who chartered the boat didn't notice that we were free. After charging the fee, it was Jessie who contacted me everywhere, and it was resolved quickly. I want to say three points: 1. During our stay, we were very considerate from the front desk to the guest room. Our baby wants to drink milk powder, and the director of the housekeeping depar**ent prepared more water. After cleaning the room, he will take the quilt and clothes outside to dry. Our family is very heartwarming for this kind of behavior. It's impossible for everyone to be satisfied with all the services. If you can't bear it, you still have to complain and be considerate of each other. 2. The jessie at the front desk handled the problem in a timely and efficient manner and was 100 points fast. I was really lucky to meet a good staff member. 3. Photographers on the trip,
We finished shooting, and then my mother-in-law and I couldn’t take any pictures by ourselves. When I asked a photographer for advice, they just picked it up with my mobile phone, and then volunteered to take a few pictures for us (thanks to the unknown photographer and the photographer who took the picture for us). Xiao Yang).
🌸Summary: Thank you all the staff for your caring and thoughtful service!

She understood our needs in the early stage and learned that my son had just finished the college entrance examination, and upgraded our family to the 9th floor of the highest floor of the noble sea view room. The room is large enough for activities and rest for 3 adults; the space including the bathroom and shower room is also quite large. Welcome fruits are provided on the first night of the stay. During the stay, the room attendant will also leave us with warm urine stickers, and also provide us with more bottles of mineral water. The little girl Chen Yurong also warmly told her to bring rain gear when it rained and remind her during her stay and travel. The hotel has plenty of food for breakfast and is only a few minutes away from the duty-free shop. You can enjoy a 5% discount on shopping. The hotel’s swimming lanes also have their own characteristics. The twists and turns are suitable for taking pictures. The slow paddle of the kayak feels super good, and the sand on the private beach is fine. A perfect holiday.

In the family room with sea view, the baby bed and indoor toys are especially popular with children. Baby pajamas and baby toiletries are provided. The sea view is convenient and magnificent. Particularly commendable is the VIP service Mark, which assists in quick check-in, upgrades the small refrigerator in the room, prepares baby beach toys and water guns, and provides a full housekeeping service. Very recommended hotel for a few people to vacation, worry-free and comfortable.

msg:Take advantage of the summer vacation to take the baby and parents to Sanya on vacation. In the second half of the journey, I stayed at the Westin Haitang Bay. The service was very good during the whole trip. The hotel has very rich parent-child activities, and there are fun lessons for children from morning to night. The day before check-in, Miss Dong Ling from the hotel’s VIP service contacted me and added WeChat, helped to book a 5% discount on duty-free shops, and helped to book lessons for children. All kinds of problems can be solved quickly as long as WeChat is her. On the day of check-out Since the hotel is full, we can only help us to delay check-out until one point, but we are on a 9:30 p.m. plane and plan to spend the afternoon at the hotel until the evening, she helped us arrange a VIP room in the spa for us to rest. Teacher Liuliu, who teaches the baking and handicraft courses to the children, is also very kind and patient. The children have a great time, and they still miss her when they come back. Next time I go to Sanya, it will definitely be the Westin Hotel~

msg:As a Marriott member, I stay in Sanya every year under the Marriott banner. The Westin Haitang Bay is right next to the duty-free shop. If you shop, the hotel will have a trolley to help you deliver it to the side entrance, and you will be there in two minutes.
All of them belong to the Marriott Group. The environmental facilities and services are not only a little bit higher than that of Sheraton. The pool room and VIP service Dongling called in advance to confirm the itinerary and arrange the room. I would like to express my gratitude.
The check-in was very efficient, the waiter introduced clearly, and there was no crowded queues. It was the best check-in experience for this trip (four hotels this time, Park Hyatt, MGM, Sheraton, Westin)
After check-in, the butler will take you into the room. It is very considerate to give you a general introduction. Two big coconuts will be presented to welcome guests in the afternoon. The minibar drinks are replenished every day, there is sugar-free coke, and sweet snacks are also delivered, which are meticulous and warm.
Although there are many people at breakfast, it is basically ok, and it doesn't look messy.
The overall green area of the hotel is large, but it does not feel that there are a lot of mosquitoes. It should be killed every day. The swimming pool is very good and clear. The area is very large. The service staff are very meticulous and friendly. There are experience activities every day. Transparent boats and paddle boards. , Internet celebrity swimming laps, etc.
For my birthday, I set up a restaurant by the seaside of the hotel. The location is very good and the products are average, but the service is very meticulous and caring. The restaurant manager communicated very friendly and presented small cakes.
There is a children’s playground on the ground floor. There are also parent-child activities every day. The baby can be hosted for a separate fee. There are also many places suitable for online celebrities to take pictures and check in.
Since we applied for a late check-out on a night flight, but we did not give it, it may be because the pool room type is more popular. It is the only hotel that did not make delay arrangements for this trip, nor did it arrange other things like Crown Plaza, which focuses on parents and children. Room rest (the suites ordered by Crowne Plaza are also very popular, but the hotel has arranged for the extension of ordinary room types). Fortunately, the housekeeper Dong Ling also carefully arranged a place to rest, thank you.
The whole experience is very comfortable, whether it's parent-child, online celebrity check-in, shopping all unified online

To sum up, Westin is still a hotel worthy of our visit again. The service is the most satisfying for us, and the details will be perfect if it is improved.

性價比算非常高了，唯一一點我們的房間真的離大

太好的，很是志忑）表揚管家alla很貼心，入住前一天就加了V告知了很多事項，在酒店期間也是有求必應，住店期間找客服打電話要一個創可貼，客服第一反應是問我們是有人受傷嗎，這個意識很好。

酒店側門離免税店真的很近很近 。
總而言之這次酒店訂的很滿意。給這次三亞之行一個美好的回憶。

設施：威斯汀特點是河道和槳板，還可以划水晶船，出片率高，另外小童活動區域夠大，繩網活動區小朋友很喜歡，貝野電玩也不錯，娃娃機很友好抓了好多。酒店的沙灘泳池也很不錯
衞生：説兩個細節，一個是我們有天早上從電梯下，電梯門口一灘黑色不明液體，我們進出好多次一直有，一直到晚上才清理乾淨；二是房間浴缸旁邊和廁所都有尿騷味，不知道是清潔不到死角還是沒好好清潔。此外其他客人也説了地毯臟兮兮，這些都很減分

環境：酒店背後是免税店，酒店自己的風機也在背後，所以背後的房間巨吵無比。加上近期可能是集中做優惠，人很多很吵雜，體驗不是特別好

服務：我們到達比較晚，酒店禮賓空盪盪，幫搬行李的都沒有，前台辦入住，服務員臭臉好像是欠她錢一樣，給的房間就在風機上面，一晚上睡不着。所以第一天特別不高興。好在管家還算負責，第二天給換了房間

總體來説還不錯，就是希望打掃衞生能細心點，室內廁所要麼配個高壓水槍也能解決呀，真的一打開衞生間門一股子味道太掉價了

最後，房間真的很一般，同樣是入住時間推遲，君悦直接給我升了140平的泳池套房，這一點上兩家酒店處理方式實在來去太大！！

除了管家服務很到位，有什麼都第一時間回覆努力解決，酒店其他人員配置的服務真的是一塌糊塗

酒店硬件不錯，雖然顯舊（海風侵蝕沒辦法），但還是感受得到設計感，泳池也很大，餐飲也能滿足基本需求。
軟件服務上是重點，讓人非常滿意，處處感受得到被關注被呵護，一路碰到的erin（好像是客房部的領導），我的客服需求總是有求必應，非常貼心。還有遇到的郭小姐（應該是總經辦的吧，如果沒記錯的話），雖然萍水相逢，但餐飲方面也給了折扣，在酒店遇見的所有人都非常nice，保持專業的同時又很能讓人感受到被服務，被尊重～
連住4天滿滿意意，下次再來還是首選威斯汀，因為所有的服務人員真的是太好太貼心了～🤗

可能是三亞天氣原因，我覺得房間裏很潮濕，不太舒適，因為親子小童玩具太多，顯得房間有點擁擠。

環境：整個酒店非常美，像花園一樣，後來又去了三亞的一些景點，感覺都沒有酒店漂亮😂，當然乾淨衞生是肯定的。
拍照：整個酒店超級適合拍照，大草坪，椰樹，而且泳池超級有設計，很適合拍照。
服務：我入住前管家小姐姐amy就給我打電話啦，服務非常好，有需求找她每次都能幫忙安排好，態度也特別好，工作能力也強。
禮賓：我是落地三亞後直接入住的酒店，酒店有接機服務，立省一大筆打車費。而且平時去免税店和海邊都可以坐酒店的小車車去，打電話來的很及時。
價格：完全物超所值，因為我是淡季入住的，所以價格比較低，就感受更好了。
好啦，真實感受，希望可以幫到大家。

酒店亮點：早餐種類非常多，多到吃撐。

沙灘人少，貝殼多。

其他亮點：酒店配了小祕書mia同志全程微信溝通解決各類問題（主要是隨身物品的丟三落四問題）。

電視配個高清的就更完美了。

辦完入住加了管家hong的微信，很負責任的姑娘，詳細的告知酒店園區活動，附近美食，還送了歡迎水果。因為我帶小寶入住，床圍，馬桶，洗漱用品，浴袍拖鞋都安排到位。雖不是親子酒店，物品也都很齊全。真是非常貼心。
酒店組織的晚上的抓沙蟹也很有意思，我們家沒有抓到，一起的小姐姐給了幾衹，寶寶特別開心。
到cdf中免國際免税城很近，有個門出去對面就是。購物真的很方便。

La limpieza en la habitación y en general en el hotel es impecable, tienen actividades diarias diferentes para los niños, el área de juegos también es muy agradable. El desayuno buffet es muy bueno, la comida es variada, sin importar de donde vengas vas a encontrar algo que te guste. El área de playa también estaba limpia y muy cómoda . El buffet nocturno también fue una gran experiencia, no está incluido en el precio de la habitación pero vale la pena pagarlo, las opciones son muy variadas y deliciosas, la comida se disfruta con una banda de música en vivo que es muy buena y agradable. Sin duda volveremos a este hotel la próxima vez que estemos en Sanya. Todo el personal es muy amable. Gracias especiales a Erin que estuvo al pendiente de nuestra estancia todo el tiempo, sin ella nuestra estancia no habría sido la misma.

早餐味道一般，種類也不是很多。
酒店的椰樹園林風景很不錯，從酒店到海邊走路過去也不會很遠，也可以坐酒店的電瓶車。海邊很漂亮，海水很藍，沙子很細，有遮陽傘，也有一些挖沙工具。
泳池有一些遮陽的地方就非常不錯，網紅河道也很好看。
酒店離免税店也很近，可以坐酒店的電瓶車到2號門，就隔了一條馬路，購物方便。
送的旅拍就很坑了，拍的一般般，不送底片，送的照片打印的相紙用的也很差，雖然選不出幾張能看的，但拍都拍了也想留個紀念，要買也很貴，慎重吧。
貝野星球組織的小童活動很好玩，老師也很温柔負責，還會給小朋友拍好看的照片分享。小朋友每一個都想參加，從早玩到晚不帶累的。小朋友沒那麼多，體驗感很好！還可以託管小朋友，開心去購物。
本次入住威斯汀的體驗還不錯，期待下一次的入住!

地理位置確實很好，除此之外建議慎選，不妨翻翻好評看看有幾個沒帶管家名字真心實意寫的，再看看差評看看其他崗位服務吧。
當然如果和我一樣倒黴出差訂了兩間房就住一晚上遇到態度惡劣還是對老闆的可能概率也不高，還好老闆通情達理沒怪我頭上，理解打工人不易，所以這個訂單給個好評，不能因為你讓我淋雨我撕了別人的傘對吧，其他平台避雷。

酒店管家Amy小姐姐很主動服務，我覺得房間潮她幫我送了除濕機，還送了水果，服務超優質，對我提出的一些需求和問題及時響應和解答，推薦
