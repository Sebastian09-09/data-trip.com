msg:We spent 2 nights at Sheraton hotel in Guilin. The hotel is located very centrally in walking distance to most major tourist attractions and close to Guilin railway station. The staff was very attentive and absolutely accomodating for all of our wishes making our experience very memorable. The interior design of the hotel is well thought out and gives it a simple but elegant touch. The facilities include small swimming pool which we couldn't try due to the weather situation. The gym consisted of a handful of cardio treadmills and machines for resistance training from Life Fitness with an area in the corner with dumbells and foam rollers, yoga mats. The changing room came with a sauna.
We can recommend the breakfast buffet which is a mix of Western breakfast and local specialties from Guilin.
Out of the available package options we really enjoyed the photo shoot where they provide makeup and clothes(classy/elegant and Guilin traditional) to capture the amazing moments from the trip.

msg:Sheraton Guilin is a great base for daily tours around Guilin. The hotel has a lot of choices for breakfast, beds are comfortable, and the location is perfect for exploring the food street and walking along the river. We were upgraded to have access to the club lounge — highly recommended asking for annual upgrade. 

One recommendation we have is to increase the offering of vegetarian dishes — there are plenty of dishes in the club lounge that didn’t need the addition of animal meat. 

Avon, the manager, and her team took care of all of us during our stay.

msg:The hotel location is hard to awesom!  It's walking distance to some of the best sites in Guilin and the facilities are in very good condition.

The food for breakfast is excellent! The staff were friendly and helpful, although only a portion of the staff speaks English. There were very few Americans or English speakers during my visit.  It wasn’t an issue, just of note.

I was fortunate to have a room on the top floor facing the river and got a glimpse of a beautiful sunrise one morning. At night the musicians play by the river so it isn't the most quiet location but the view is great!

One less desirable thing was they hosted a large tour group from Hong Kong on Saturday/Sunday and the group ate early and blocked access to the buffet.  The staff was very apologetic and took care of me when I returned an hour later.

The food street is just right behind the hotel and 15-20mins walk to Dongxi lane and jingjiang prince palace.

Excellent service. We left our power bank and they sent it back to me. We had a great time there.

We were abit disappointed in the hotel itself. It was very cold in the hotel and room even with the AC at 28·C. There was no cold water when we tried to shower, however they were very fast to help sort it out. The top roof terrace was closed both nights when we went up to try get a look at the view which was disappointing too. Don't think we would stay again.

The newly refurbished bedrooms were good and the beds were easily the most comfortable of our holiday. The checkin and our was easy and the staff had decent English. However the staff at the tour desk had almost no English and prices for the Li River cruise were higher than those quoted by our hotel in Yangshou area, so I booked with them instead.

It's right next to the scenic spot, and then go out for a walk along the Li River. It's very comfortable with the breeze
I have to give special praise to all the service staff of the hotel. Not only did they upgrade the room type for free and give the executive lounge treatment, but they also knew that the flight was booked late and specially delayed the check-out to 9 pm. It's the first time I have enjoyed such treatment in a domestic hotel. It's so considerate
By the way, the hotel is also very beautiful, but it's a pity that I forgot to take pictures. Anyway, it's right to stay in this Sheraton in Guilin

msg:This hotel was recommended by a friend. The hotel is in a great location in the city center, next to Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, with many snacks. The room is very comfortable overall. Manager Xiao Ding received us at the check-in front desk and gave us travel photos and intangible cultural heritage rubbings. The service was really considerate and gave people a feeling of home. The concierge took the initiative to help with the luggage, which was great. There is a parking space at the door of the store, which is very convenient for travel. After checking in, they also gave us fruits that were washed and sent to us, which was very reassuring. The bed in the room was very comfortable and seemed to be imported. The experience was great and I will recommend friends to come here in the future

The hotel is conveniently located in the city center, surrounded by many special attractions and special snacks. The hotel decoration style is simple and generous, and the room is clean and tidy. During the stay, the hotel staff was only warm and thoughtful, and introduced the local specialties and attractions very enthusiastically. I was also very satisfied with the room arranged. The service of the hotel staff was very online, which made me feel meticulous care. In terms of price, I think this hotel is worth the money and highly recommended!

From the room to the facilities, from the service to the transportation, I am very satisfied. The hotel environment is clean and tidy, the design style is unique, the room is very spacious and bright, the bedding is comfortable, and the a**osphere is full of warmth, which makes me have a good rest. The hotel facilities are also very complete, including gymnasium, swimming pool, etc., which allows me to fully relax in my spare time. In addition, the location here is also very good, the transportation is very convenient, and there are many special snacks and attractions around. The hotel's catering quality is also very good, which makes people have endless aftertaste. In terms of service, the staff are enthusiastic and very professional, and they are also very attentive and thoughtful, which makes people feel very comfortable. Especially Mia at the front desk, meticulous. When checking in, she heard that we were visiting Guilin, and took the initiative to introduce the surrounding attractions. The enthusiastic answer made me feel very cordial! Sheraton is a very ideal place to stay. I strongly recommend this hotel. I will come to stay next time and recommend it to my friends around me.

Because the location is very good in the old city, the room is not very spacious, but it is enough. Crossing the road is the Li River. There are people fishing next to it every day, and there are many singers at night. It is very lively and convenient for eating. I stayed for three nights. The first night was very noisy because the room was near the elevator. There were still people making noises after 11 o'clock. The next day, I changed the room. It was very quiet. The hotel service was very good. The room aunt was very enthusiastic. There were also people helping with luggage when checking in and out. She called to inquire about the check-in situation and sent fruits. In an unfamiliar city, the old hotel is still trustworthy.

Disadvantages: The hotel management is not good at pre-planning. There was a long queue for breakfast on May 2nd. The number of breakfast varieties is not enough, which is not worthy of the star rating of the hotel. The room hygiene and service are good. The front desk service is average, and the luggage management service is good. The hotel room is too small, which is a flaw. Not only did we not get any discounts for staying for three consecutive nights, but we were not even given a trial voucher. We probably won't come again next time.

I asked if I could change to a lake view room, and sure enough, I was upgraded to a lake view room for free again. The next day when I checked out, the front desk lady learned that I drove a long distance, and immediately gave me a bag of fruit drinks and mineral water! It's awesome 👍👍👍.

msg:I was disappointed overall. I wanted to stay in a better hotel in Guilin. After this trip, I compared it and found that it didn't seem to have any outstanding highlights. The price was expensive, and it was not worth it.
The first thing I want to say is the front desk service. I bought a package that included intangible cultural heritage production, travel photography, etc. The check-in was almost completed, but I didn't say anything unless I asked, and my attitude was very cold. Although I didn't use these two items, it was really annoying that you didn't take the initiative to say it.
The second is the impression of the room. Figure 1 is the small bar we took when we just entered. Well, as a five-star hotel, it is really not right and a bit disgusting. There is also the size of the room. It is basically the smallest room I stayed in this time. Although there is a bathtub, it is pitifully small, and the location of the toilet is also awkward.
The third is that the overall comparison makes me more and more unhappy. It is really not as comfortable as the chain hotel next door for more than 200. As the second most expensive hotel on this trip, there is nothing to show. I also confirmed with the front desk that this room is the best twin room, and there are staff who came out to ask about the check-in experience and maintain the relationship at the first time. After the comparison at the end of the trip, I still can't help but say it.
Don't stay at Sheraton Guilin, it's a disaster!

Hygiene: It was clean and tidy when I entered the room, no problem.

Environment: Located next to the Li River scenic spot, this hotel is very convenient to get to anywhere. Behind it is Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, then East-West Lane, next to Jingjiang Palace, to the right is the Twin Towers, and in front is Elephant Trunk Hill. It is a very comfortable location, convenient to get to anywhere.

Service: The front desk service is very good, and any problems are solved in time. Welcome fruit was also given. Because the location is on the two rivers and four lakes, there are many people singing and playing guitar on the roadside. They asked us if we needed to change rooms the next day and change to a quiet one, but it was generally quiet after 10 o'clock. If you mind, don't stay by the river, and if you don't mind, it doesn't matter.
A lot of services were also given, but we didn't use them because we were shuttling between scenic spots and didn't have time to use them. Overall, from the perspective of distance, appearance and service, it is a good choice

Walk a few steps to the Twin Towers. Turn left at the first intersection and walk a few steps to the pedestrian street. The location is invincible. The front desk service is very enthusiastic and introduced me to the location of their favorite local Qiufu rice noodles. The location of the Lijiang Sunrise Room is also very good. The view of the Lijiang River and the mountains in the distance are outside the window. You can also see Chuanshan and Chuanshan Tower on the right. The breakfast on the second floor is rich and the rice noodles are delicious. Because I had to catch the cruise ship at Zhujiang Wharf early the next morning, I went out at 7:30, and the breakfast starting at 6:30 was just right. If the start time could be half an hour earlier, it might be better and easier to eat. Of course, business guests may not have this demand. In addition, the hotel’s internal lunch and dinner catering is slightly insufficient. The Chinese food on the 7th floor needs to be booked one day in advance. The restaurant on the second floor is mainly Western food. The buffet is only available on Saturdays and Sundays. For guests who like to dine in the hotel, there are too few choices and it is not convenient enough. Overall, Sheraton is a good experience. The first three pictures are the views outside the window

msg:Facilities: The electric toilet seat in the bathroom is quite good. There is no conditioner in the room (I found out after washing), but the underground parking lot is really small and there is no charging pile😳

Hygiene: You don’t have to worry about the age of the hotel, but keeping it clean and well-maintained is a must. Sheraton Guilin did not meet expectations in this regard. The ceiling of the hotel is already very low and looks depressing. When you look up, the air-conditioning outlet has really not been cleaned for a while. It has reached a disgusting level. It is unimaginable to blow dust and air all night long. The cheap curtains in the room were also covered with black marks, which made it annoying when the curtains were pulled down. There was also dust on the picture frames in the room. Considering the age of the hotel, there is a smell in the room and I don’t know how to use aromatherapy. I really don’t know how the hygiene and hardware maintenance are done.

Environment: The environment is not bad, mainly because of the superior geographical location. If you are visiting Guilin near Elephant Trunk Mountain, the location of this hotel is unique. Because the road in front of the door is a one-way street, walking becomes the best choice. The hotel is within walking distance of cruise ships, Elephant Trunk Mountain and other attractions.

Service: The service is average. The concierge at the door doesn't know how to go out when he sees the guests parking at the door. It's really cold outside, but other friends can go out and greet them, but this hotel is not in place. The driver needs to get off the car and ask for parking. Where is the field?

Xiangshan Scenic Area Tour (within walking distance from the hotel): When I made the reservation the day before, I was told that I didn’t need to make an appoin**ent, but when I arrived at the entrance of the scenic area, I was told that I had to make an appoin**ent. I was also drunk.
The room is so cramped and cramped, it feels like it is on the level of so-and-so's selection, so-and-so premium product, or so-and-so's smart selection. Personally, I feel it is no longer worthy of the title of a five-star hotel.

When I choose a Sheraton hotel when I go out, I am worried that other distinctive hotels and Internet celebrity hotels will be a scam. I feel that the Sheraton brand will not be a scam. I have also stayed at Sheraton Qingyuan Shishan Lake for a long time, but the room and service were much better than here.
This Sheraton hotel relies on its superior location to overdraw Sheraton's brand reputation and lower consumers' reputation for the Sheraton brand. If I go out and choose a hotel after this, it will affect my ability to completely believe that Sheraton is not a scam.

msg:Experience a different Spring Festival in Guilin with my mother!
When traveling during the Spring Festival, what I hope most is to find a lively place and lively with the locals. I did my homework on where to stay in advance, and finally decided to stay here. It really exceeded my expectations~
1️⃣Location: The city of Guilin is full of scenic spots. The hotel is located in the city center. You can go to the scenic spots (Elephant Trunk Hill, East-West Alley) on foot if you stay here. You can go to the scenic spots after breakfast in the morning, take a nap at noon, and check in again in the afternoon. The scenic spot is very relaxing and convenient. Downstairs is Zhengyang Street, a very down-to-earth snack street. It costs only 30 yuan to eat, drink and have fun😆
2️⃣Service: Smooth communication, very thoughtful, especially on New Year's Eve, the buffet was arranged, touching and unforgettable. The most important thing is that the a**osphere is good, very suitable for family outing~
3️⃣Room: Northeasterners are most afraid of the cold indoors. As soon as you enter the room, it reaches the temperature of wearing a T-shirt. It is super warm ~ The facilities are complete and very clean. Outside the window is the Li River ~
Finally, I am very grateful to the catering depar**ent and front desk staff for their enthusiastic service. I also recommend a good place for the whole family to travel. Especially during the Chinese New Year, it is very convenient to be in Guilin city ~ the overall cost performance is better than Yangshuo!

It is right outside the Lijiang River Elephant Trunk Mountain and the Sun and Moon Tower. The breakfast is good and rich. The Sheraton Hotel I stayed at this time is an old star hotel but it has been recently renovated. The overall feeling is comfortable, the service is attentive, and it is very convenient to travel. The scenic spot is worth a visit. The rooms I booked are very good. This time I came to the hotel and also provided travel photography services. Cooperation Foxlook's professional photography team produced a very good photo shoot, which I am very satisfied with.

Facilities: Very good, the air conditioning is very powerful, and the water temperature is also suitable
Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy
Environment: I didn't feel stuffy or humid when I got into the room. When I entered the lobby, I really found that the hotel was very clean. There was a light fragrance when I walked in.
Service: The service is really good. When you enter the hotel, there will be a waiter to help you with your luggage. There are many people at the front desk when checking in, but the little girl at the front desk still serves every guest very considerately and enthusiastically.
Overall, this hotel is really good and very cost-effective!

After complaining, we were moved to another room. The hotel gives away free tickets to Xiangshan, but the reality is that the Xiangshan Scenic Area is already free of charge; gives away handmade batik, but the hotel doesn't mention it from beginning to end; gives away travel photos, but the hotel doesn't mention it either. Do the guests have to ask for it? The service is really bad and a bit misleading.

The small episode during check-in was covered by the warm service afterwards. The staff here are warm and generous, solving problems for the guests, and they really make them feel at home. The most beautiful thing is of course the elevator. Outside the sightseeing elevator, you feel like you have traveled through a century-old floating world. It feels like it’s almost ten minutes to walk out of the hotel to the East-West Alley and Haochi Street in the Wangcheng Scenic Area, which is very convenient...suitable to stay with your family.

I still like the super fresh vegetables the most, and the pumpkin tasted good, and the white porridge was also very fragrant. During the Chinese New Year, we eat a lot of big fish and meat, so it feels good to eat something light. The room air conditioner is a central air conditioner with a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius. You cannot adjust the temperature yourself. It is recommended that it would be better if the indoor air conditioner could be around 22 degrees Celsius in winter. The staff are conscientious and responsible, and the place is clean and tidy. Because there was a problem with the kettle the day before, I sent a very sincere fruit basket today. No one is perfect, and no hotel is perfect either. We booked a river view sunrise room. It rained lightly these two days, so we didn’t see the sunrise. The river view is vaguely visible. Although it is blocked by trees, the scenery outside the window is lush and green, which feels good. Taking a taxi online in the hotel lobby went smoothly today and there was no traffic jam. Maybe today is not the peak tourist season.

An old five-star hotel that was renovated during the epidemic. The facilities are useful.

The service is very good, attentive and careful. Rich breakfast.

The bedding is comfortable and there is a bathtub, which really relieved the fatigue from visiting Yangshuo for the previous two days.
The breakfast is quite rich. My favorite is Guilin rice noodles. I never get tired of it!
The lady at the front desk was very considerate and provided us with a child's breakfast benefit. She also sincerely recommended that many families with children consider the hotel under the group. For a family of three, the room includes meals for two adults. If you can send your children Yes, it’s really a plus. It’s not about how much money it costs, it’s about thoughtfulness and thinking from the customer’s perspective!

Walking about 800 meters is Guangxi Normal University, which is also the Jingjiang Prince's Mansion. The East and West Alley is right after the tour, and delicious food can be found everywhere. The hotel room is spacious, clean and comfortable, and the hotel service is very good. Seeing that we have children, we took the initiative to give us a set of children's disposable products, and the children loved it! The next day, because the children got their shoes wet while playing, I needed to go back to the room to change clothes and shoes. However, it was already past check-out time and I was given a late check-out service. It’s really heartwarming! I will stay at this hotel next time I come to Guilin.

On the day of check-in, the short-haired front desk girl who was wearing dark work clothes the day before yesterday was very nice. Helped with check-in attentively, and enthusiastically introduced nearby reliable restaurants); on the night of check-in, the accompanying child felt unwell, and the middle-aged brother in dark work clothes also worked very hard that night and attentively helped to change supplies that needed to be replaced. ; Checking out in the morning, the smile of the long-haired lady the day before yesterday made me feel that my trip was even more worthwhile~ I will choose this place again when I come to Guilin again~

There should be no problem with the sunrise, but God didn't cooperate and it was a cloudy day. The room is not big, but the design is reasonable and unique. The design of the hotel is a central shaft with corridors surrounding the guest rooms. The second floor is an open restaurant. The restaurant has become part of the overall landscape of the hotel, which is very eye-catching at first glance. But success is also Xiao He, failure is also Xiao He. During dinner, there was a rising smell of oil smoke from the part of the 5th floor corridor next to the restaurant. This must be improved. The service awareness of the staff is very good. I like it.

The hotel is right on the edge of the Li River, and the Li River is right outside the window of the room we stayed in. The hotel is strategically located. Elephant Trunk Mountain, Fubo Mountain, Diecai Mountain and Jingjiang Royal City are all within 2 kilometers and can be reached on foot. The hotel's breakfast is very good, with both Chinese and Western food, especially rice noodles and camellia with local characteristics. As a foreigner, I feel good eating it. The hotel's service is very good. As soon as you enter the door, you will be warmly guided by the greeter. The service girl at the front desk is also very enthusiastic and proficient in business. She quickly prepares the room card. We asked for more mineral water, and two more bottles were given every day. During the stay, they greeted us, asked if we needed help, and took the initiative to postpone the check-out time for an hour. They also gave us a small bag of fruit when checking out! Guilin's landscape is unmatched in the world, and the Sheraton Hotel is really nice!

Key points: The hotel has an excellent location. It is within walking distance from Elephant Trunk Mountain, Sun and Moon Twin Towers and other attractions. There are also many places to eat nearby. What I like even more is that the hotel has traditional ethnic costumes that can be rented, and there is also an intangible cultural heritage experience space next to it. It can be seen that the hotel has carefully promoted the local natural and cultural landscape and made efforts to protect traditional culture. The breakfast variety is also very rich, which is a very unforgettable stay experience.

We were very satisfied with the room and breakfast after staying for two days. Special praise to the front desk clerk Xiao Xiong (Jia Li) for her excellent service. The room we booked online was a double bed room in Building 2. We were traveling by car for many days and wanted a quiet location. She directly upgraded us to Building 1 without having to walk too far. Far, when we entered the room, we saw that it had twin beds. We wanted a double bed room, and she patiently helped us adjust it to a double bed room. However, the clutter outside the window of the double bed room facing the street was not as eye-catching as the hotel garden outside the window of the twin room, which made us want to go back. I was really embarrassed about the twin room, but in order to have a better rest after the long drive, I still mustered up the courage to ask Xiaoxiong for help. She didn’t complain at all, patiently helped us move back to the twin room, stayed with us, and gave us fruits. .
We went back and forth, and the little bear took the trouble and had a gentle attitude. I have to give her a thumbs up, and it also shows that the hotel management is in place.

Okay, so I stayed for another day, from the reservation depar**ent to the front desk and then to the concierge (there was an uncle with short hair, I didn’t remember his name, he reminded me of various pitfalls before going out, and he didn’t forget to bring water, I’m really grateful). In addition, there is cleaning, and when I see children with children, I take the initiative to bring children's toiletries, and the entertainment room attendants also play with the children in various ways.
In addition, the location of the hotel is also very good. It is on the edge of the Li River. On the left side of the gate is Yiren Street Snack Street.

Although it is lively, the hotel is well soundproofed. I can't hear anything at all. I slept well! The swimming pool is outdoor and the children like it very much. There is also a children's play area, which is very thoughtful. We had an early flight the next morning, so we didn't book breakfast included. The hotel manager called us specifically and added breakfast to us for free. In addition, the room also had a view room. The service was very satisfactory! Next time I come to Guilin, I will definitely choose Sheraton Hotel.

msg:I work in decoration, so I pay more attention to decoration details.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings first.
1. As a five-star hotel, it has just been renovated. The hardware hinges on the entrance door are not hidden, which is relatively low.
2. The return air vent at the bathroom door has been making abnormal noises and it has never stopped.
3. The parking lot in the ba*****t is too small.
4. The doorman at the door was relatively inattentive to the arrival of vehicles, and asked us to show us where the parking lot was.
5. The handle material of the window in the room is also relatively low. Very cheap feeling.
6. The bay window is not made flat, so the bay window can only be viewed but cannot be used.
Let’s talk about the advantages.
1. The service is indeed in place.
2. Before leaving, I also gave fruits, moon cakes and soda water.

Walking into the lobby, the warm lighting and exquisite decoration make people instantly relieved from the fatigue of the journey. The hotel has a superior location, convenient transportation, and beautiful surrounding environment, which makes people feel peaceful.
After checking in, I was deeply attracted by the exquisite decoration and comfortable bedding in the room. All modern facilities are available, all demonstrating the hotel's unremitting pursuit of quality. It is particularly worth mentioning that the hotel's gym and swimming pool facilities allowed me to relax and unwind after a stressful trip. In terms of service, the hotel is even more impressive. Whether it was the warm reception at the front desk or the meticulous and thoughtful room service, I felt the warmth of home. The breakfast is rich in variety, combining Chinese and Western styles to meet the needs of different tastes. When checking out, the checkout process was efficient and smooth, which made me feel better about the hotel again. After leaving the hotel, I couldn't help but sigh. It was a wise choice to choose Guilin Sheraton Hotel for this trip. It is not only a simple residence, but also a haven for peace and relaxation. In the future, I will definitely choose Sheraton Guilin Hotel again to continue this wonderful accommodation experience.

We booked three nights in a row and were told that there would be no drinks provided on the second night. Did you mean to book the three nights separately? Or who is missing those cans of Coke and Sprite? The facilities in the house are old. It was obvious that the wallpaper was re-posted. It smells old. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. There are no screens on the windows. There are a lot of mosquitoes. The room was said to be thirty square meters. I laughed. The door of the room is so small. Just look at the picture and the corridor. The aisles are not as good as those of an express hotel. The height of each floor is at most two meters. Can I reach the top without feeling depressed? The most ridiculous thing is that one night it rained and there were no umbrellas in the hotel room. The concierge said that they had run out of umbrellas. This was the first time I heard that there were no umbrellas in a hotel of this level. The underground parking lot was pitifully small. This is not a Sheraton. The ones on the side are Hanting Yaduo is better than him. The breakfast is said to be 138, but the actual rating is 78. I’m not exaggerating. The real price level of the hotel is about 200, the location is ➕100, and the brand is +100. It’s hard to bear to look at it if it’s over 400. The staff's service is okay. To be honest, if the hotel management level is not improved or paid attention to, the tourism market will give you feedback.

Ms. Hu at the front desk has a very good service attitude. She has been making various introductions. If you have anything to do, please contact me at any time and she will serve us. Entering the room, the environment is the same as the photos, clean and well designed. All in all, a very satisfying accommodation experience.

The hotel environment is clean, the room layout is perfect, the facilities are new, the bedding is comfortable, and the room service staff are also very attentive, making people feel very comfortable. Gives me a feeling of home. From big to small, impeccable, overall great value for money, a very satisfying experience. There is a pedestrian street near the hotel. There are a lot of delicious food and scenic spots nearby. Sheraton is the first choice when you come to Guilin.

As soon as they enter the lobby, there is a hand-drawn map of scenic spots near the hotel, which is very convenient to go anywhere. The room is not big, and you can see a little bit of mountain peaks. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant that night, which was relatively expensive. A five-minute walk to the right of the hotel is the snack street, which has cheap and real juices. You must try it. Since our flight was at 5pm, the hotel gave us a two-hour delay for free.

msg:We took our parents and children to Guilin, which is commonly known as the most beautiful place in the world, and started our five-day and four-night trip. We chose the Sheraton in downtown Guilin because it was very close to Elephant Trunk Mountain and the Sun and Moon Twin Towers. You can walk to these two attractions for free. Behind the hotel is the pedestrian street, which is very lively at night. As for the hotel, the room is not very big, but the windows are large. It faces the swimming pool. The view is actually okay. The room facilities are quite satisfactory. The unique feature of the hotel is that it has an inner balcony and a hollow hall in the middle. Breakfast is in the cafe on the second floor. The environment is good. The breakfast has a wide variety of dishes, and the waiters are very polite and have a good service attitude. If you need anything, call the customer service center, and you'll get an immediate response. When checking out, I was given some fruit as a gift, which was also a thoughtful gesture. The hotel also comes with an intangible cultural heritage experience as a gift, but this time because we were tired from traveling every day, we didn’t have time to experience it. If I have the opportunity in the future, I will choose to stay at Sheraton again.

msg:I rarely review hotels, but this time I really exceeded the bottom line. My flight was late and it was already early in the morning when I checked in. I washed up as soon as possible and got ready to go to bed. I felt uneven when lying on the bed. I kept wondering why the power supply and socket were in the middle of the bed. The result was... It turned out to be two single beds pushed together into a large bed. To avoid the pitfalls of night flights, I chose the Sheraton Hotel owned by Marriott. I just wanted to have a good sleep. The socket was at the top of my head and I was worried about accidentally getting an electric shock while sleeping. The bed was still uneven. I really don’t want to bother changing rooms in the middle of the night! I was extremely disappointed with the Sheraton. I checked out the next day and never considered the Sheraton again. The room was extremely small and the bathroom was compact and windowless. There was a restaurant right outside the room door. The sound insulation was extremely poor. You could hear the sound of turning on the switch next to the bedside at night. You see, the square dancing on the road and the noise of cars with honking horns! Please choose carefully, low-end business express hotels with rooms worth more than 1,000 yuan are not as good as Yipin! I must waste my time and share it with you all!

First of all, the location of the hotel is particularly advantageous, 200 meters walk from Elephant Trunk Hill.
The hotel faces the main road of Guilin, and several streets behind are pedestrian streets.
Everything to eat, drink and have fun

When the hotel front desk learned that we had to get up early to catch the cruise the next day,
They specially helped us adjust the guest room for easy access and added a breakfast spot for our children.
The next day we set off after leisurely enjoying a sumptuous breakfast
The overall service is very considerate and considers the guests' perspective.

The hotel's building as a whole has a sense of age and is generally well maintained.
The hotel has sufficient air conditioning and a fresh smell that meets the standards of a traditional five-star hotel.
The room is slightly smaller, warm and comfortable, neat and clean, the sanitary ware and bedding are dry and straight
Some facilities are slightly simple but do not affect the accommodation experience

There is traffic jam on Binjiang Road, so it is very convenient to walk. However, the service and hardware need to be improved, and there is a gap between Sheraton in other domestic cities. The food in the restaurant tastes good. I tried Chinese and Western food and they were both good. The durian pizza is worthy of praise👍Sign up as a Marriott member and get a 10% discount on dining. The hotel room is not large, the toilet is not a smart toilet, and although the curtains are not electric, this simple blackout curtain should be replaced. The first day of check-in was on Saturday and the waiting time was too long. After returning from Yangshuo and staying again, I took the initiative to upgrade to a river view room as compensation, but the lock of the room was broken, so I had to change to another room. The outdoor swimming pool is small, with a water depth of 1.4 meters, and the children had a lot of fun playing in it.

The room service we were given was very professional. This is my first time in Guilin. It is very convenient to visit the surrounding attractions. Next to it is the Elephant Trunk Hill which is far and near the civilization. Going out is the Lijiang River. Very nice scenery. The lobby of the hotel is also very spacious and bright. The rooms are nice. It is worth bringing family and friends to live here. Absolutely praise. Recommended. The price/performance ratio is also very high.

The location of the hotel is also good, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the beautiful scenery of the Lijiang River is just outside the window. A bird's eye view. Going out is Elephant Trunk Hill, the emblem of Guilin City. There are many tourists in summer vacation, but it does not affect the enthusiasm for tourism at all. Eating and shopping next to it is not
Very convenient, many special snacks Guilin rice noodles are very impressive. The facilities in the hotel are also very complete, the swimming pool is outdoor, and children like it very much. It is very convenient for children to swim and adults to exercise. I will definitely choose Sheraton next time. It is indeed an international chain brand that is trustworthy! It is very convenient to visit the Two Rivers and Four Lakes at night, and the night view is so beautiful! It is indeed a civilized city with the best mountains and rivers in the world! The staff are friendly, warm and generous, especially the front desk staff! I will definitely choose Sheraton Guilin Hotel next time!

The manager Hu at the front desk is very kind and helpful, actively helping to solve problems, which makes people feel warm and deeply felt the hotel's professionalism, meticulousness and humanistic care. The breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, including Guilin special rice noodles, porridge and hot dishes, as well as freshly baked bread, coffee, milk, yogurt, etc. The location is very superior, you can walk to the Sun and Moon Twin Towers in 5 or 6 minutes, and the landmark Elephant Trunk Hill is not far away. To take a taxi to Reed Flute Cave, you must drive to the ticket office at the entrance of the cave, as shown in Figure 7. The whole trip to downtown Guilin was relaxing and enjoyable, and I will choose Sheraton Guilin next time I come!

Let’s talk about the breakfast...very poor...no service...nothing to eat...the meal was collected at ten o'clock...I went in at 9:45 and was charged...it was still on time at ten o'clock...not a minute late...this way I was still charged. Don’t remind me…it’s a bit of a trap…

From the lobby to the room, you didn't encounter a single service staff smiling at you... Just imagine... Why does such a brand look like this...


The package also comes with a small handicraft made next to the hotel.

I checked the strategy here. The hotel has a variety of styles. In order to avoid stepping on the pit, I still believe that the brand chose Sheraton. I am very satisfied with the in-store test, and the overall comprehensive evaluation : A quality hotel! Adhering to the brand's high quality and thoughtful and polite service, we can also see the connotation and temperament accumulated over the years. On the first day of check-in, I saw that it was a one-for-two free upgrade. The children were very happy to see the river view. After returning from Yangshuo, they strongly requested to renew the reservation. The waiter helped us upgrade to the 6th floor. Here, overlooking the Elephant Trunk Mountain, three people were sent away. Buffet breakfast and light evening meals. In the Sheraton River View Room, we choose not to draw the curtains, and enjoy the sunset in the evening. At night, we fall asleep watching the moonlight, mountain and water view outside the window. In the morning, we are very satisfied to be awakened by the sunrise and morning light; the opposite side of the hotel is very beautiful, and the decades-old camphor trees grow naturally Hanging down, strolling after the rain is very artistic. Take the children to smell the camphor tree and feel the dowry of the southern lady - the camphor wood box (this section of the road is also a relatively secluded section of the trail along the river); the meal is rich in Guilin with a combination of Chinese and Western The rice noodles are authentic, the pastries are exquisite and delicious, and the coffee can be taken away; the most important thing is that the hotel is surrounded by scenic spots, which is so convenient! And the room is quiet. Next time I come to Guilin, I will choose Sheraton again!

The hotel service is attentive and warm, it is very clean, the breakfast is rich, and the food is of good quality. The hotel room is small, which is a pity.

The facilities in the hotel room are a bit old and crude, especially the floor creaks when walking on it. It’s the first time I stayed in a five-star hotel. The MINI bar in the hotel is empty. The price/performance ratio of 800 yuan for the basic room in the off-season is really not high ,Not recommended. The only thing that feels okay is the restaurant, which is relatively new and stylishly designed. There are not many varieties of breakfast but enough to eat. My favorite is rice noodles

msg:The location is very good, right on the Li River. It's a short walk to Elephant Trunk Hill, and a few steps away is Zhengyang Pedestrian Street, a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle. Sheraton is also a long-established five-star hotel, and its hardware is still good. The breakfast is not bad, including Guilin's special rice noodles and oil tea. We stayed in a room on the side of the Li River. The windows were soundproof and did not affect our sleep at night. However, the room size is small, the facilities in the room are simple and generous, and the feeling of luxury is not strong. Overall it's worth staying.

Environment: The room is so-so, the hotel is a bit old
Facilities: There are no robots, so you have to go downstairs to get them, and they are not given away.
Service: For someone like me who lives in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, it’s very poor.
Service: The room card was not ready. I went upstairs and found that it could not be used. I went down and redone it. The waiter did not apologize at all!

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied, not as scary as some people on the Internet say. If you want to stay in Guilin for a few days, I recommend you to live here. The hotel is relatively old, and the decoration and public facilities have a sense of age, but the rooms should have been newly renovated in recent years, and the hygiene is not bad. The staff are very enthusiastic and down-to-earth. The breakfast is not bad, it is quite rich, the rice noodles are delicious, and the fruits are relatively fresh. The staff gave us a free upgrade when we checked in, and the room has a balcony where we can breathe fresh air; the big brother in the concierge depar**ent also told us in detail where we can take the boat; the room service staff responded quickly to our needs. Overall it is very good. It's just that the facilities and hardware are still far behind the current five-star hotels. It feels a bit like a holiday Inn. However, in a place close to the scenic spot, it is already the best choice, and the service of branded hotels is relatively guaranteed.

There are many scenic spots in the surrounding area. It's nice to take photos and check in. The room is also very clean. Overall, I'm very satisfied! The room was a bit small, but because of the convenient transportation, it was too hot during the day, so the kids went to the hotel to soak in the swimming pool and went out for a walk before dark in the afternoon. The nearby attractions are very convenient. Electric cars are very convenient for walking.

The rooms are small in size and newly renovated. They are very clean and have relatively simple facilities. However, there is still a gap between the style of the hotel and the Sheraton. If you don't have high requirements for the rooms, it is still OK. As a five-star hotel, the breakfast needs to be improved.

Although it is old, it is excellent value for money in all aspects. The service at the front desk of the luggage depar**ent is good. Kim, Lily, Manager Tang, and Candy are all very good. They will chat with each other when they pass by the front desk. If you choose to come to Guilin in spring to experience the misty rain on the Lijiang River, staying at the Sheraton Guilin is a good choice. The rooms are also very nice, clean and of high quality. The location is excellent, surrounded by commercial areas, so you don't have to worry about eating, drinking and having fun. The Lijiang River is just outside the hotel, which is suitable for tourists to take a walk. You can walk to the famous Elephant Trunk Hill. There are many snacks around, and you can eat Guilin specialties along the way. Yes, I will choose to stay here next time.

The hotel's breakfast is rich, ranging from rice noodles and bread to Chinese and Western food. The accommodation and sleeping environment are good. You can have a good rest after a long day of shopping. The shortcomings of the hotel include: check-in time is too late at 3pm, and rooms are generally not available for arrivals at noon. The room I booked had a classic twin bed. The room was too small and the internal facilities were simple. Once I entered, I felt like I was staying in a budget hotel. Everything I could omit was omitted. The level of detail did not match that of a five-star hotel. Only the lobby and restaurant were grand. The location is excellent and the overall stay is good, but not as cost-effective as a five-star hotel.

msg:I don’t know why the rating on Ctrip is so high. If you care about the living experience, I strongly don’t recommend it.
To be honest, the only advantage is that the location is good, close to the Li River, Pedestrian Street and Xiangshan Park, making travel more convenient.
Other than that, the hotel's hardware and software are pretty much useless.
Let me talk about the lobby and front desk first. They are very simple and not at all five-star standards.
Then the elevator is slow and difficult to wait, and in a five-star hotel, you don’t even need to swipe your card to take the elevator, you can just get on as you like.
The above can be ignored, but what is completely intolerable is that the air in the entire hotel is damp and stuffy, exuding a damp and rancid smell.
Let's talk about the room. The double bed room we booked was obviously a standard room. It was a room where two single beds were temporarily put together. The mattress was hard and lumpy, and the quilt was hard and thin.
The design of the washbasin is extremely unreasonable. It protrudes from the countertop, causing water to easily spill on the floor. The bathroom floor tiles are not even anti-slip. The slightest touch of water will make it extremely slippery. You can imagine how annoying it is.
The toilet is next to the shower room, and there is no paper basket next to it. Where is the paper basket? I don’t know what the designer’s considerations were under the washbasin countertop, which is separated by a door frame and is about 1.5 meters away.
The room is really not big, and the decoration is very simple, but this is a matter of opinion, maybe it is the style of remembering the bitter and thinking of the sweet.
Just such a room costs more than 1,300, which is much worse than hotels of the same price in other cities.

A true downtown hotel, newly decorated in European style, the hotel lobby is very luxurious, with spiral staircases and sightseeing elevators, unparalleled. There is no other choice for a five-star hotel. Sheraton is also my long-term brand. The service is first-class. When I enter the hotel, someone will take the initiative to help with my luggage. Feel at home. Very satisfied with this stay. Next time, I will definitely recommend relatives and friends to come to Guilin, and definitely stay at an international brand hotel, Sheraton Guilin! ! !

msg:There is nothing wrong with saying something. The drinks in the refrigerator in the room were open, so I called room service and they came to replace them. I also gave him a few extra bottles of water, okay, that’s solved.
I had just settled down and was sitting on the sofa when I suddenly smelled a smell of urine, which was confirmed by many friends in the same group. I called room service again and said I wanted to change rooms. They agreed, but after waiting for 10 minutes, no one came to deal with it.
When I went downstairs, there happened to be a group of people checking in. Well, don’t embarrass your front desk staff. Then I said angrily to one of the front desk staff, I have something to do with your manager. He looked at me for the first time and ignored me. I repeated that I was looking for your lobby manager, and this time there was a response. He told me with a straight face that our manager was busy. I emphasized again that I was looking for your lobby manager and I wanted to change rooms. The front desk's reply was, sir, no matter what. You also have to queue up for things. There are so many people, and our manager is very busy. I said I've already checked in, doesn't my time matter? The sofa in your room smells of urine, so I have to change rooms. Do I make things difficult for you?
Finally, I called the manager who was next door. The manager didn’t say a few words to me. He called another manager who was probably from the housekeeping depar**ent. This service staff had a nice attitude and immediately changed my room. , emphasized that it is Linjiang, do I care whether it is Linjiang or not? As long as it's clean, I won't embarrass you even if you give me a room of the same level. In the evening, a plate of fruit was given. That's it.
The above facts are absolutely true. For two nights, the price is close to 2,000. for reference only.

It is indeed one of the worst Sheraton hotels I have ever stayed at. There is a swimming pool outside the window of the room, and the curtains in the room must be kept closed. There will be people partying by the swimming pool in the middle of the night, so don't even think about sleeping.
In addition, the cleanliness of the guest rooms is hard to describe. It bears the name of Sheraton but does not have the quality of Sheraton. The front desk staff and manager are also very speechless. The funniest thing is the return visitors, right? Please improve your own quality and stop harassing customers with phone calls one after another, okay?

1. Hotel service: After checking in, I went out immediately and found that the sliding door in the bathroom of the room was broken at around 10 pm. I called to ask for a room change. I asked the master to come over and take a look. After waiting for a while, the master came over to start repairs. I called customer service again and asked for a room change. The customer service asked How long does it take to repair? Wait. Reply: Do you want me to take the child with me at night and wait for the master to repair it before washing and resting? ! After some further exchanges, we moved from the garden-viewing double bed room on the third floor to the street-facing twin room on the second floor. I listened to the car alarm all night, and at around 8 a.m. there was the sound of cars driving away, as well as the sounds of singing and square dancing. ........
2. Hotel facilities: The sliding door in the bathroom is broken. The decoration of the hotel room is extremely simple. Even the curtains are very simple to draw. I thought I was staying in a fast hotel, so forget it... I found out after changing rooms. There is no dirty towel collection basket, and the hair dryer can never be lifted up... I can’t complain.
3. I mentioned a few words to the front desk when I checked out in the morning. Not long after, I received a call from the manager on duty, offering to treat us to a meal and a free stay at the hotel after registration. I just hoped that there would be no negative reviews. He said that the epidemic had just ended and there would be no negative reviews. It has a great impact on the hotel. Let's see if we can remedy this and not issue a bad review. I refused and reminded the manager on duty that it was better to do a good job in remedial action afterwards. In such a five-star hotel, why not stay in an express hotel and save the money to drink a few cups of milk tea and have a delicious meal? Isn’t it delicious? ! ! !

msg:I have stayed in hotels ranging from 200 yuan to 4,000 yuan. I can say that I am extremely disappointed with the Sheraton this time. I stayed here because of the reputation of the Sheraton. This is a room for 6.7 hundred yuan per night. Can you believe it?
Picture 1 is what it looks like right after you check in. Is this how the guest rooms of a five-star hotel are cleaned? The service is really serious and meticulous.
Picture 2 and Picture 3 The 2.03-meter king-size bed is actually two small beds pushed together. If you don’t have a king-bed room, just make a standard room in a big way. Are you fooling the customers or yourself? You really can’t believe that you are staying at a Sheraton. This will cause Is it safe to point the charging plug directly at the head? How do people sleep?

I deeply doubt whether Guilin Sheraton is using the Sheraton brand.

Picture 4 is part of the hardware decoration. You can take a look at the furry decoration. I recognize the 2.300 express chain, but is this a Sheraton? ? ? ? ? ? Please don't stretch your hips Sheraton
I don’t know about all the good reviews. Maybe we didn’t stay in the same hotel? ? Shocked. This trip to Guilin was the most shocking.
Please don’t be fooled by the appearance and decoration of the front desk.
Just an illusion
The above touches the objectivity of conscience.

It is very suitable for family outings. The service of the hotel is very good, there are people greeting you wherever you go. There is also a very beautiful back garden in the hotel that is worth checking in. Children can feed the fish, and it is very pleasant to sit in the garden and enjoy the flowers and drink tea. The bellman service is also very thoughtful and enthusiastic, the gym is also very good, and the old brand is absolutely trustworthy!

After sitting on it, your feet spin empty, which is very uncomfortable. You have to swipe your room card to enter the toilet in the lobby, which overturned my perception of five-star hotels. The free mineral water in the room is all miscellaneous brands, and has an untreated smell, which is not as good as the branded mineral water in other general hotels. The facilities are outdated, about the same as a hotel worth two or three hundred yuan, and the price/performance ratio is not high.

It is only a few hundred meters away from Xiangshan, East and West Alleys, and the scenic spots of Two Rivers and Four Lakes. Secondly, the service is even better. At that time, I only booked a room with breakfast, and I added a room for free at the front desk breakfast! Yes, the flight was delayed due to the weather, and the front desk allowed us to stay until 6 pm for free. This is something I have never experienced in any hotel before! In short, the experience is very good!

General sanitation, fire inspection has been called
The environment is not good, all you can see from the windows on the second floor are private houses
Outdated facilities

The welcome staff is very enthusiastic to help with luggage, ask about physical conditions, etc., without any sense of distance; I ordered takeaway, and the front desk actively helped me find it. The front desk will be very enthusiastic about introducing the way to visit the surrounding attractions, the surrounding food, and the eating style of the local people. When I know my next step, I will also enthusiastically introduce the way to visit, etc. I feel the enthusiasm when I enter the door.
[Guest room] 1. Landscape: Book a river view room, you can see the landscape of Guilin in the room, the view is pretty good, very comfortable. 2. Room: tidy, reasonable use of space, complete facilities and guaranteed space for people's activities.
[Breakfast] The variety is quite complete. Both Chinese and Western food are available. Gan Laofen is highly recommended. Add side dishes to season yourself, which is more delicious than outside. This is the first time I ate camellia oleifera. I said it was a local supper. The taste is quite unique. The chef will introduce it as he prepares it.
[To sum up] I came to Guilin to recommend this restaurant and felt at home.

msg:Checking in during the Dragon Boat Festival, the front desk service was extremely poor. It was after 12 o'clock when we arrived. It was raining outside. We took our luggage and wanted to settle down before going out to play. When asking about the situation, a female front desk said that the room we booked had just checked out and was being cleaned. Maybe It took more than an hour, so we ate and waited in the hotel lobby. After waiting for about an hour, I went over to inquire, and the female receptionist told me that it would take another half an hour. I asked her to call me when she was ready, instead of asking her to go there repeatedly, and she agreed wholeheartedly. After waiting for more than an hour, I still didn't get a call. I went to ask about the situation again. She was busy checking in other guests and ignored us. She pushed us to another male front desk. We were at that male front desk again. I was made to stand for a long time (yes, the characteristic of his restaurant is that it is extremely inefficient when checking things for you, and it will not tell you whether it is checking your things at the moment. The guest stood in front for a long time without raising his head, nor did he He would say "This may take a little longer, please wait"), and I couldn't wait any longer and went back to sit. At almost three o'clock, the male front desk came over and told us that the room had to be cleaned just after the last guest checked out, and we needed to continue. Waiting... emm, so the female front desk just lied to us and kept us waiting for more than two hours without blushing? The male front desk man apologized to us and said that he would give us a piece of fruit after we checked in, but he didn't deliver it hahahahaha. It really made me laugh. Is this a five-star rating? The room facilities are just like that. The air conditioner is very old and does not dehumidify. Even after washing the underwear and socks, they cannot be dried. The sound insulation is not good and it is completely protected from lightning.

msg:I went to Yangshuo to stay for one night before returning to Chengdu. I didn't have high expectations for hotels in Guilin including Yangshuo, so I chose the Sheraton because I thought it would at least be clean. As a result, this thunder made me tender on the inside and burnt on the outside.
1-The entire hotel faces the street and is very noisy, so don’t be too demanding about the environment.
2- He took the initiative to upgrade me when I checked in. Thank you, but here’s my problem. The upgraded room type is exactly the same as what I booked. I don’t know what I upgraded to.
3-The double bed room actually has two single beds pushed together. The mattress and bed are two separate ones, so the charging plug is above the pillow between the two of them. If I sleep on my side, the plug is right next to my face. , is this safety guaranteed? ? I have never heard of such an operation in a five-star hotel.
4-I put away my luggage and went to take a shower. The shower room still used non-disposable public toiletries. Halfway through washing, I discovered that the bottle of shower gel was actually empty! ! What exactly does room service serve? ?
5-The minibar was completely empty when opened. The explanation given to me was that many guests had to put their own things? ? Is changing the regular service because of the special preferences of some guests called giving up food due to choking?
6-You have to swipe the door card three times or more before you can enter.
7-2022, and there are still hotel rooms without coffee machines.
8- When the car arrived at the door, there was no concierge to help us with our luggage, and he kept urging us to hurry up and not block the back.
9-The stool in the room is worse than the sofa in our house that was scratched by a cat
I called the manager to complain about the above problem after experiencing no shower gel in the shower. Because I only stayed for one night and didn't want to bother, I didn't ask for a room change or anything like that. I just complained. But things haven’t reached their climax yet——
When I was about to go to bed and take out my contact lenses, I went into the bathroom and found that the ceiling above the bathtub began to leak downwards, dripping dirty water. The bathtub was full of dirt, so I had no choice but to change rooms. The manager was very nice and helped us change to a suite - even though the suite was right on the street, we could hear various sounds of racing, dancing and quarreling downstairs. Seriously, I don't need a bigger room to fiddle with, I just need a normal room with no hassle.
I really can't understand why a hotel like this hasn't been awarded a star yet?

msg:The hotel opened in 1988, and it has been 34 years since then, and the maintenance is OK. It used to be called Daewoo Hotel, which corresponds to English or Sheraton. It seems to be a five-star hotel invested and opened by Koreans at the beginning of the reform and opening up. Many dignitaries and celebrities have stayed here. It is a hotel with history and culture.

msg:I don't feel good when I stay in. Sheraton is an old-fashioned hotel in Guilin. It was very old when I lived in the past, and it was renovated at the back. The general style is simple. Check in after 5 o'clock in the afternoon, seven or eight people check in when checking in, but only one computer is used for check-in, which is inefficient. The platinum card was upgraded to an executive room, and when I saw the common room of my colleague, it was a different floor. Everything else is the same. The hard decoration and furniture part of the room looks cheap and ordinary. The bathroom basically retains the facilities before the renovation. The room grade is similar to that of Fairfield, and the gap between Nanning Marriott and Sheraton at the same price is drawn. Because it is located by the Li River, there is no high floor, no executive lounge, and it is shared with the lobby bar on the first floor. It only serves dinner, and there are few varieties of breakfast.

msg:The difference is unimaginable! ! ! It has nothing to do with five stars! ! ! It all depends on the location. The sound insulation is very poor. They are all tourist groups, there are many people, and the quality is low. It is very noisy upstairs and next door at night, and you can hear it clearly. The toilet wouldn't flush, so I called a worker to fix it. I didn't bring the tools, so I went back to get the tools and then came back to fix it. I kept the door open for more than half an hour. The connecting rooms have no view and face an internal garden. Moreover, there are many twists and turns in the corridor, and there is no attendant to take care of the luggage. I originally wanted to post a picture, but I found that there wasn’t even a single photo of this hotel because it wasn’t worth taking a photo at all.

msg:This hotel is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. I give the stars to the concierge uncle. First, the room is small and poorly equipped. It is said that it will be renovated in 2021. I think the facilities inside are not as good as those of old hotels that have been renovated for more than ten years. Second, the layout of this hotel is hollowed out in the center, and there is a large lobby underneath. However, their peculiarity is that weddings and banquets are held in this space, so there will be a ridiculous scene where the first floor is still noisy like a night market at 10 o'clock in the evening, and the guests upstairs are miserable. Third, the staff training is a mess. There is no welcome at the door, and the front desk will not take the initiative to greet. The hotel room price, after confirming the price twice, told me that the intern made a mistake when checking out... Well, it's just a little over a hundred yuan, you *** still have to have some face. Fourth, the location, this hotel is actually located in the city center, on the edge of the Lijiang River, but because there is a parking control for shared electric vehicles on Binjiang Road, you need to walk to the nearby pier to ride a bike, so there is actually no geographical advantage and convenience to speak of.
The above is my feeling after staying there for a few days. There are not many five-star hotels to choose from in Guilin, but this hotel has a very poor price-performance ratio. You should keep your eyes open and don’t waste your money.

msg:Service: I drove for more than 7 hours on the day of check-in. I was very tired when I arrived. I parked at the door for a long time. No staff came out to receive me. I still pulled the luggage trolley at the door to unload my luggage. After half of the unloading, I wanted to drive to the parking lot and unload again in order not to block the cars behind me. The security guard instructed me to take a very narrow path there. There was a short stone pier at the corner, which could not be detected by radar, and it was relatively dark there. , the car was scratched, and the security guard stood there watching without asking anything. Later I learned that we could turn right from the main road. Seeing that our car was relatively large, no one warned us. When we arrived at the entrance of another parking lot, the security guard's attitude was even worse. We asked him where we could park. He looked like he didn't want to answer and said he would park wherever he saw one. We asked him if there was a place in the underground parking lot, and he said no. You know, let's go in and see for ourselves. After entering, there is only a very narrow spot. Our car cannot park in and almost cannot get out. After I came out, I found a parking space in a very remote location. No one cared about it, so I took my luggage in one by one. I was in a really bad mood on New Year's Day. I have never experienced such poor service in a five-star hotel. I have never encountered such indifferent staff. I am still celebrating the New Year. I will never come to Guilin again if I have the opportunity. Check in. On the day of check-out, the staff said they would give us a few bottles of drinks to express their apology. However, the soda water expired in less than a month and was still valid for three years. There was really no sincerity at all.
Facilities: I complained at the front desk, and they said they upgraded our room. When I first booked it, I thought it was a suite with two bedrooms and one living room. Who knew that the so-called upgrade was just two ordinary rooms, and a room was opened in the middle? The door is connected, very speechless. It must have been unoccupied for a long time. The whole room was very dusty, especially the dust on the phone cord behind the cabinet. I was in such a bad mood that I didn't even take pictures.
Anyway, overall it is very poor, the price is not cheap, and the service is really not as good as some B&Bs. It is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none.

msg:Guilin Sheraton, although a little old, but well maintained. It is located on the edge of the Lijiang River with the two rivers and four lakes. It is about a 5-minute walk from the No. 3 gate of Elephant Trunk Hill. It is very convenient to eat around. Behind it is Zhengyang Pedestrian Street. Far. Next door is Yiren Road, and Chongshan Rice Noodles Main Store is only 2 or 3 minutes away, which is very convenient. The Jinlong Village recommended by the local Didi driver is also near the Sheraton. In addition, the night tour of the two rivers and four lakes personally feels unnecessary, it is better to go directly to the Lijiang River.
The check-in was very friendly. The family happened to celebrate their birthday. The front desk said that they would instruct the restaurant to make a cake and arrange the guest room. Meimeida, the cake is small, but the taste is very good, and there are fruits in it.
Forced by the epidemic, I saw Sheraton offer a group purchase of 999 yuan / 3 nights with breakfast a long time ago. I bought it immediately. Although Sheraton accepts group guests, the service has not declined in the slightest. Although the basic rooms are small, they are clean and tidy, and there are bay windows. I have stayed in the hotel for the first time and found that there are bay windows. I am very impressed. There will be two free bottles of water in the guest room every day, but due to the hot weather, Auntie Linen said that she will put two more bottles to relieve the heat, which is really considerate!
However, Sheraton Guilin also has two shortcomings. The breakfast has not changed at all for three consecutive days, and the carbs are too high. Although the bread and cakes are really delicious, the fruits are not rich enough. Lychee, yellow skin and mango season, none of these... Guilin rice noodles mainly promote mixed noodles, and Sheraton's brine is great. Why do they mainly promote soup noodles? My friend said that it is not good to eat soup noodles. I suggested to try the mixed noodles, and everyone was full of praise.
Second, it may be a common problem with Sheratons across the country. The quilt disappears when you fall asleep... I believe that friends or hotel staff who have the same experience will understand me.
Speaking of the gym, I didn’t go to the gym, but I went to watch it before it closed on the day. The opening hours are great from 6:00 to 23:00 every day. The gym is very big and well-equipped. The swimming pool is outdoor. The water depth is 1.2 meters to 2.9 meters. I shuddered when I heard this depth.
Rory talked a lot, and the overall is still very good. It was noon when we checked out. The little brother and sister at the front desk asked if you need water~ The details are great~

msg:Conclusion: It affects the mood of the trip, and the stay is unhappy, and it is strongly not recommended! ! !
Advantages: The service and breakfast of the front desk staff are in line with the level that this price should have
Disadvantages: 1. The air conditioner is very loud at night and can't sleep at all, and I didn't fall asleep all night. 2. The curtains are rolled up and the light leaks at night will seriously affect sleep. 3 There are Marriott Gold members who want a room facing Jiang and will not be arranged. The room is directly facing other hotels, and the curtains can only be closed during the day, and the privacy is extremely poor.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It is very close to the Lijiang River. You can walk to the Lijiang River Scenic Spot. It is 100 meters away from the left side of the hotel to see # Yiren Road Pedestrian Street# and enter on the left, it is a food gathering place. It is recommended to go to the tasting restaurant with the Guangxi Culinary Association certified #safety restaurant# sign outside. This avoids being slaughtered. The room is booked as a standard room, and there is a window outside near the swimming pool. Because the hotel is a little old, the air conditioning system in our room will fail. However, the hotel immediately changed the room and dealt with the problem in a very timely manner. There was not enough mineral water in the room, and the hotel also provided unlimited supply.

There is no need for a doorman at the door, and I haven't seen a single one in the three days. Booked a slightly higher priced room with a large terrace which was shabby and dirty with no furniture at all. In addition, the big trees on the roadside are basically invisible to the river view. The hotel's sound insulation effect is not good, and I can hear the phone in the next room clearly. The point is that when I can't stand it at 11:30 pm, I call the switchboard and call 3 times in 2 to 3 minutes and no one answers. Generally speaking, the general service of hardware is more general. I hope that the hotel executives who see this review can better understand and solve the problem.

It is very convenient to eat and drink, and you can also walk to the scenic spots of Two Rivers, Four Lakes and Elephant Trunk Mountain. The hotel is old, but it still feels very comfortable. The room has been renovated, the bathroom facilities are relatively retro, and other places are very new. The attitude of the staff I came into contact with is very good, and the breakfast is not bad. Because the trees on the side of the road are tall and dense, you can't see the Lijiang River well on the terrace on the 6th floor, you can only see the scenery in the distance. There are three shortcomings. First, the wifi is sometimes unstable and freezes. Second, the water pressure in the shower is a little low. Third, the switch panel on the side of the bed is a bit crooked, and you can still see it on the side of a socket board on the wall. Hole. Next time I come to Guilin, I will still consider staying at this hotel.

msg:I arrived in the middle of the night because of a business trip. There are many hotels on the riverside. I originally wanted to choose ciao. I have a Marriott member and I can earn points by the way.
Sheraton has stayed so many times. In order to be more comfortable, I chose the expensive and elegant room (high floor). I checked in at the front desk and said to upgrade the room type. I was also very happy.
Then inform that because it was ordered by Ctrip, SPG points are not allowed.
(Then I will use the Marriott app to order the same price, I'll say it early!!!)

I said it was newly renovated in 2021. I said it was the third floor. It was not a high floor. No matter if I was too tired, I didn't want to argue. I went into the room and looked at it. It was a business economy room type.
Upgraded twice for the room type? It should be less than 25 square meters, right
There is only one bedside table in the double room, and it is a double bed changed from a two-bed room.
The new decoration, the taste is too heavy to imagine,
One of the most weird is:
I actually want to charge the bedside and find that the power plug is really on the side of the bed, really on the top of the head, that is to say, there is no socket on the bedside table.
In the end, I changed to the elegant room I originally ordered, with a smaller area. Fortunately, the socket is at the head of the bed and will not sleep on top of the head.
Improvise
This design, matching. People can't imagine it is Sheraton.
I've stayed in so many Marriott hotels, and it's the first time I came across such a weird hotel.
As if fleeing early in the morning, he hurried to check out.
Never come again.

The front desk was not very happy. It was given to the building behind the courtyard. The fountain was still ringing. I thought it was raining all night, the room was small, the facilities were outdated, and the air conditioner was turned on until 30. ℃ is also cold wind whoosh. The advantage is that it is separated from the river by a road, the river view is beautiful, suitable for walking.

    Check in more than 9:00 in the evening. After seated, I found that there was no Wi-Fi and Internet TV. The safe was out of power, so I called the front desk. The front desk said for a while to ask the master to watch it, but there is no Internet TV. For hours, no one came to check, because I wanted to see the night view of Lijiang, I called the front desk at about ten o'clock and asked to change the room. I changed the room after 15 minutes, and the Wi-Fi, Internet TV and safe in the room were all normal.
    When I got up in the morning, I felt very itchy in my arms and knees, and you saw a lot of redness and I didn't know what was bitten by something.
    Overall evaluation: Although the hotel has five stars, the rooms are very small. Hardware and services are incompatible with five-star. The only thing worthy of praise is the professionalism and service spirit of the staff in black suits at breakfast.
   To add, the first picture is a hair dryer, because the hair dryer is also broken, not because it doesn't let out the wind, but the handle is always folded.
   The whole room feels that the room is relatively new, but the facilities such as hair dryer, kettle, toilet and so on are old and old.

The room, facilities and sanitation are similar to those of two or three stars. There is nothing, go upstairs and take the stairs, and there are civilian buildings and garbage stations that are not more than ten meters apart from the windows. There is no sound insulation at all. Early in the morning, the children upstairs were jumping up and down, talking in and out of the corridor and opening and closing the door. Even on the phone next door, the voice on the other end of the phone could be heard clearly. Bad enough to suspect that the hotel is pirated.

The breakfast is also very generous, the replenishment is fast, the coffee is delicious, and the beef patties are very fragrant.

I won’t say much about it. I will also give an objective evaluation of the hotel. The negative impact of the just-completed renovation is that there are still peculiar smells in the hotel, and I hope to strengthen the adsorption of formaldehyde. The bath accessories are a bit old, and I checked it is a very early version, not the standard Le Grand Bain of Sheraton, I hope it can be replaced in time. The hair dryer is relatively old, and I hope it can be replaced with a better brand.

1. The hotel staff is rumpled in uniform, there is no service at night check-in, and it's okay in the morning
2. The first time I lived in Sheraton was this kind of manual blackout curtains
3. The rooms are all facing the street, and the square dance starts at 7 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock
4. Upstairs decoration, jingle bells from 8 o'clock, call the front desk and tell: we can’t coordinate, that’s it
5. A large bed, obviously made of twin beds
6. The facilities are unusually old, yellowed toilets, shower rooms like homes, huge floor drains soaking in water, and TVs with snowflake pixels that feel extremely heavy
It's not like Sheraton at all!
Stay carefully! ! ! This environment, this service, this facility is totally unworthy of Sheraton and the price of a 700 bowl!

The biggest flaw of the hotel is the poor sound insulation. When you talk outside, you think you forgot to close the door. When you walk upstairs, you think someone has entered the room. Magic!
Don't reply by saying you value my comments and then discuss them. I will also provide a solution here. Replace and deal with your cheap doors and soundproof walls. Express hotels will not do this. As a leader in the local hotel industry, this is a must-have!

msg:This is the first time staying with my family, the environment is very good, the location is in the center of the Lijiang River, very close to the Elephant Trunk Hill Park. The room hardware is good. Guilin has been very hot these days. We didn't even leave the hotel. We just ate and drank in the hotel. The afternoon tea on the first floor was also petty. Ms. Hu at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us arrange various arrangements, very heart-warming, thank you again!

msg:體驗比較搞笑～～
喜來登是老品牌了，看得出來是很經典的5星裝修。

不好的地方：
1. 剛入住後房間內的電話線沒有插上，滿牆也找不到電話線的接口，下樓到前台前台聯繫了維修師傅，師傅到房間一看才知道：住的房間是臨時通過標間改成的大床房，原本的電話、牀頭櫃、電話線接口是夾在兩個單人床之間的，一旦把兩張床合在一起自然電話線就被床擋住了，牀頭櫃也被挪到兩一個角落了。就不是很開心了，覺得我的錢多多少少有點白花了。師傅把牀頭櫃挪到床的旁邊後把電話線什麼的都插上後，由於電話插頭和電話線插頭有厚度，床墊和牆面之間就自然流了個逢出來。最不方便和安全的是：開關和給客人使用的網電源插座都在原本的兩個單人床之間，這樣把床合併後，一旦坐在床上靠着牆面就會碰到開關和網電源插座，不但會經常不小心的開關燈，還可能有觸電的風險！
2. 房間處於中空的地方，房間的門不是非常非常隔音，二樓早餐區早上吃飯餐盤碰撞的聲音還是能聽到，感受不是很好。
3. 5月2號由於早餐時用餐人員非常多，大家要排隊進入，就是出來幾個人才能進去幾個人的情況。期間有已經用餐人員在裏面佔位置，等後出現的家人來了之後直接繞過正在排隊等侯用餐的客人直接進入餐廳用早餐的情況，引起了正在排隊人員的不滿。遇到了這個情況有位酒店服務人員還一直在解釋為什麼那幾個人可以插隊，我實在是想不通一位5星級酒店接待人員的情商怎會如此，處理方式既不公平公正、又給不到顧客情緒價值，屬實不該，有待加強呀！

好的地方是：
1. 早餐還是維持了國內星際酒店的標準，東西還是好吃的！
2. 服務人員還是很重視客人對酒店的評價的，退房前一晚特意打電話諮詢有沒有不滿意的地方啊，但是我當時腦子沒轉過來，沒提出什麼抱怨；第二天退房的時候又再次詢問了感受如何是否滿意，還提出送我一些水果作為補償，希望在攜程上幫忙給好評。

要離開前一天，因體諒我們有點年紀又無大陸電話無法網約車，吳小姐還特來致意要協助行李及車子到高鐵站事宜。臨行時，又送了一袋水果。
喜來登的早餐非常豐盛，房間設備、空間配置及服務真是沒話說。這是我們這次到大陸旅遊留下最記憶深刻之處，實在感謝！下次再來桂林旅遊，一定會再次入住。

服務：入住時前台小姐姐態度熱情真誠，免費升級了江景房，還贈送了早餐。而且諮詢購買兩江四湖船票事宜，也給了非常真誠無套路的建議。遇到的所有工作人員都很友好，讓旅遊心情愉悦不少。

早餐：早餐自助，價格不高，種類因此不多，但基本常吃的都有，也有桂林米粉和油茶特色菜品。特別之處，咖啡可以打包外帶。

凡事都有兩面性，一直覺得不可能有完美的選擇。喜來登是老牌連鎖，房間內部比較緊湊不算大沒有陽台晾曬略麻煩。最高樓層六樓，住三樓江景房也是會被樹蔭擋住。但品牌服務標準化還是有保障，下次來還是願意入住！推薦！

象山景區遊覽 （從酒店步行可達）：方便省力

我覺得來桂林想吃住舒服省力，選這家就好啦～

預訂🈯️的是當地的品牌酒店🏨——喜來登飯店！

辦理好入住前台就通知了
行李🧳生幫我到停車場拿行李🧳

早餐也是非常的自助早餐🥣

吃起來真叫一個爽！

酒店🏨的地理位置也hin便利

正陽街、東西巷、靖江王府也衹需要10min左右

愛運動的寶寶們逛累了
建議去健身房和游泳池放鬆一下
如果對桂林當地非遺感興趣的
可以去酒店一樓感受不一樣的拓印
酒店🏨還有免費🆓的民族服裝真的好貼心！

另外酒店🏨新推出的
海洋🌊主題的下午茶☕️推薦你們一定要試試
記得一定要提前清裏你的手機📲內存
要不然真的不夠拍……

msg:#桂林

因為給桂林市區預留的時間極少，

所以選擇了地理位置優越的喜來登。

所有景點步行可到，

酒店還有免費非遺項目體驗館。

30幾年的老牌5星，

經過翻新後還保留復古的味道，

還是值得一住。

最後説幾個不足。
早餐品種略少，
晚上窗外比較吵，一邊房間是靠江邊，晚上總有人唱歌，一邊房間是靠酒店泳池，晚上10點半依舊人聲鼎沸。不到10點多睡不了覺。

另外，這家店對早餐真的看得特別緊，一大早來來去去就幾個人。打包早餐也不能自主選擇，都是提前給你處理好，我付了錢，包含4份大人早餐，實際衹有三個大人下去吃了，想打包給小孩而已。桂林這種地方，一個三十來平的房間，兩個連通房將近一千四，沒讓你當我上帝但是至少服務精神拿出來，多想想怎麼做服務業吧。大部分酒店早餐都是非常寬鬆，打包早餐，打包盒隨意，自選隨意。而且人家真沒這麼閑，沒事給我打電話。算了。下次也不來了。
唯一好處，兩個房間連通，但是這個門的設計又太差，看看迪士尼的連通房怎麼設計的吧。

msg:A hotel with a lot of cultural heritage, the hotel's intangible cultural heritage activities are also free to experience! Great! The room is clean and tidy, and the facilities and equipment are very good. The location of the hotel is superior. On the edge of the Lijiang River, it is very convenient to travel around for food, snacks and sightseeing. It is within walking distance from the Sun and Moon Twin Towers of Elephant Trunk Mountain and Dongxi Lane. The service is also in place. Manager Tang at the front desk, Xiaoyu is thoughtful, enthusiastic, professional and caring. The hotel is well equipped and the swimming pool is great. The experience was very good, and I decided to stay for another night. Next time I come to Guilin, I will definitely recommend relatives and friends to stay at the Sheraton.

msg:1200+的房價，房間設施其實就是基本的四星配置吧，房間在副樓，感覺是喜來登收購了隔壁平價酒店，重新裝修了改的。

房間超級多，但黃金週可能酒店沒有做過壓力測試和緊急預案。第一天到達的時候，check in場面超級混亂，沒有人幫忙接行李，check-in 櫃枱也是各排各的，插隊的，問詢的，前台還有結婚的。第一天的早餐也是，沒有人安排座位分流，住客甚至要自己和別人協調拼桌等位。餐廳大堂有不少主管模樣的員工巡視，可就是沒人主動幫忙安排引導分流一下。第二天早餐加開了一樓咖啡廳，分流後好很多。酒店副樓有個電梯，直通停車場和側門，無人看管，堆着一些裝修材料，燈光昏暗，電梯去住客房間也沒有刷卡控制，覺得安全有隱患。

酒店位置方便，去象鼻山，靖江王府，日月雙塔，兩江四湖碼頭等都是步行可達。酒店側門有家印度餐廳，好好吃，推薦。早餐中廚的桂林米粉好吃，特別是拌粉。還有特色桂林油茶，可以嚐嚐鮮。其他餐食不功不過吧。

總之服務有點夠不上喜來登的品牌，特別是服務的差距，但看得出酒店有在積極改善和調整。

重點表揚酒店的服務，入住前就和前台溝通過，需要很安靜的房間。前台很詳細告訴我們，主號樓和二號樓的區別，還有面對酒店花園或者泳池的會比面對江景安靜很多。

我們入住的是面對泳池的，確實安靜。

第二晚因為有事情需要非常早退房，有些手續需要辦理，前台都能提前辦理妥當，還問我們是否需要提前幫我們打包好早餐，很貼心的服務。

另外酒店的早餐不錯，能吃到桂林米粉帶湯的幹拌的都有，還能喝到油茶。

地理位置優越，晚飯後沿江散步很閑適

酒店設施也還不錯，雖然稱不上是喜來登裏面設施最新最不錯的，但是也不差。由於和長者一起訂的家庭房，酒店後來還多送了一份早餐，謝謝！
當天正好有辦婚禮的，婚房就在我們隔壁，沾了沾喜氣。
需要注意的是，如果需要絕對安靜空間的朋友，好像桂林和陽朔的酒店隔音都比較一般，不過我們倒是沒有這些影響，白天逛回來倒頭就睡。
總之，很不錯的入住體驗，謝謝酒店的工作人員！

msg:人生第一次坐飛機出差迫降在桂林，因為廣州的暴風雨
猝不及防，囧途實錘
還好不是暑假旺季，臨時訂還能訂到喜來登的房間
凌晨三點終於到達酒店，前台小哥人帥心善得幫我們房間升級還免費送了早餐
第二天一大早我們又往廣州趕
雖然短短几個小時的逗留，酒店的服務設施無疑是雪中送炭

提個不足吧，房間是繞着中間這個地方一圈設定的，我住三樓，二樓是吃飯的地方，從早上七點開始就會有吃早餐盤子碗碰撞的聲音，不算特別大聲，但是能聽見，住的時候可以問下前台是否有遠離中心位置的房間（聲音大但是離電梯很近）

msg:非常愉快的一次旅途！房間贈送下午茶一套，吃到你不想吃晚飯。附近到哪裡都非常方便。象鼻山5分鐘，碼頭就在象山公園門口，酒店旁就是步行街。酒店大堂的接待員非常友好，幫助升級了房間。酒店房間是標準喜來登配置，乾淨又安靜。總之，非常滿意！下次還要來住這裏！

msg:導航給導到酒店後門，沒看到門僮，以為是訂錯了酒店，進門辦理入住手續後前台告訴我們那是後門，從前台開始感受到了品牌酒店的服務，又是一次美好的入住體驗，入住到離店三次的滿意度回訪，體現酒店對服務的品質要求。酒店周邊商業區，非常方便各種購物和就餐，象山景區走路三分鐘。

msg:酒店前台服務比較好，但是可能酒店房間太多了，我們入住的房間要走好遠繞好久才能到達。雖説喜來登名氣比較大，但是酒店入住體驗感一般。尤其是可能暑假親子旅遊比較多，房間隔音不是很好，有孩子在樓上跳的話，聽得非常清楚。衞生還可以。

msg:如果説象鼻山是桂林的招牌，那麼喜來登無疑是這個招牌上最亮的那束光。剛入住時出現一點小插曲，打電話到前台後立刻來工作人員給我們換了陽台房。必須給酒店工作人員的協調能力和應急反應能力點贊👍👍👍寒潮來襲的冬夜收到了來自喜來登人的温暖。
早起享用豐盛的自助餐後溜達到象鼻山公園，逛一圈再從容啟程。是這個春運回家路上出彩的一個片段！
