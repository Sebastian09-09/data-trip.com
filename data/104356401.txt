msg:The hotel has a loft-style design with many eclectic screens that can be seen everywhere. However, it did not meet my expectations for this brand - M Social. I did not feel any social connection. Although I received a call from the Guest Experience Manager before my arrival and provided an arrival time, there was no welcome upon check-in. The check-in process was easy, but the room was very simple with no outstanding features that I can share with you on Ctrip. The key issues are that the air conditioning did not warm the room, the combination of the bathtub and shower was not very convenient, and the bed mattress was too firm. The lobby was also too small. The restaurant did not have too many choices, but it was okay for me, if they could add more gym food and fresh juice with less sugar that would be better.. For M Social no feel the social

William at the front desk introduced the surrounding tourist attractions in detail when checking in, which is quite professional. At the same time, the hotel's dining is also very rich. As a brand under a Singaporean group, its breakfast restaurant is also a combination of Chinese and Western cuisine, rich in Southeast Asian cuisine. The most worth mentioning is that the hotel's price is very cheap, which beats the surrounding five-star hotels in seconds.

It was also stuffy, it was really stuffy inside, I felt suffocated, I thought the scenery was okay, but after staying for a day, I felt too comfortable when I came out, fortunately the front desk clerk was very nice and enthusiastic, I went there for my birthday and wedding anniversary, overall I was quite disappointed

After washing the bathroom, I found that there was no floor towel at the door of the bathroom! I asked my girlfriend to find it quickly. However, I searched every corner of the room and found it nowhere to be found. I turned on the air conditioner and my whole body was wet and felt cold. I could only wipe my whole body and walked out of the bathroom! Maybe the water on the soles of my feet was not wiped dry and I almost fell down... My girlfriend took a shower and asked the room to send a floor towel! I waited for nearly 20 minutes to send a floor towel! They said that the cleaning staff forgot to lay it, speechless! The joints of the bathroom are all floor tiles. If an old man falls, the consequences can be imagined! 
Breakfast on the second day. The category is OK. But I found that the chef in the open kitchen was looking at his mobile phone from time to time. Isn’t it working time? And it’s the high wind time of the restaurant! No one cares and no one asks! 
Check out! I like to wear leather shoes. I changed my shoes and looked for a shoe horn for a long time. I couldn’t find it! Later, I had to use the comb handle instead of the shoe horn! For a leather shoe lover, you should understand! 
Details of the hotel room! The quality of the chef. It can be seen that this hotel is poorly managed!

I am very satisfied with everything, but the only thing I am not satisfied with is that the decoration of the room has a strong and obvious smell. I felt dizzy two minutes after entering, so I had to ask the hotel to open the window to sleep, but it was very noisy at night, so I didn't sleep well.

It is adjacent to Jiuguang Shopping Center, Yuanrong Plaza and Eslite Bookstore, etc., and has a unique geographical location. When you enter the 25-story hotel lobby, you will be attracted by the beautiful scenery of Jinji Lake outside the panoramic floor-to-ceiling glass window in front of you. The hotel front desk staff is very in place and upgraded to the lake view king room courtesy, which makes me, a guest from afar, feel at home. The decoration of the guest room is elegant and fashionable, worthy of being one of the few super luxury hotels in Singapore in the country. Living in a lake view king room, tasting mellow afternoon tea, and looking at the beautiful scenery of Jinji Lake outside the panoramic floor-to-ceiling glass, it seems like you are in a fairyland on earth. The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich and delicious and inherits the unique flavor of Singapore. The hotel's comprehensive service management is of a high standard. It is worthy of being an international luxury hotel. The next time you go to Suzhou for business travel, your hotel is the first choice!

Overlooking Taohua Island, Linglong Island, watching the night view of Jinji Lake, taking a luxury cruise, riding a catamaran, walking around the lake, and cycling. Staying for two or three days, the arrangements are full. Shopping is close to Jiuguang, Yuanrong, and Fenglonghui. The hotel lobby and room decoration are modern, fashionable, and trendy. The lobby is on the 25th floor. From the underground garage to the guest room, you have to change three elevators, which shows the luxurious style. The only drawback is parking. There are few and unclear signs along the way when parking in the underground garage. It is too big and winding. You also need to read the parking space signs clearly and don't park randomly. There are many private parking spaces. If you can't park near the elevator in the lobby, it's a bit annoying to find it. Parking is not very convenient. Everything else is good.

The space is bigger than expected, very clean, and the view is very good, especially the night view after turning off the lights.
The lights and curtains in the room can be controlled intelligently, but a brighter light source may be needed at night. I don’t know if it’s because the lights are broken. The light above the TV is darker than the bedside. The smart curtains are very convenient.
You need to go down to the first floor to pick up the takeaway.
Four bottles of water will be delivered, and the water will be replenished every day. There are cola, drinks, and wine in the small refrigerator. The aunt is very good. Before going out, you can choose the cleaning scene you need on the iPad. Every day when you come back, the bed is tidy and the clothes are folded and put away for us.
The overall experience is good and I will come again next time.

Takeaways are not allowed upstairs, and the elevator needs to transfer back and forth, which is very inconvenient.
The cleaning towels fell in our room and were forgotten to be taken away.
The concierge didn't help with the boxes. When I returned to the hotel the next day, I actually saw the concierge enthusiastically helping foreigners carry their boxes upstairs. It was really eye-opening...

msg:I listened to my relatives' introduction to this hotel because my relatives were studying in New Zealand, and there was an M social hotel there, so we were looking forward to staying at the first Qianxiuyue Hotel in China. First of all, during the check-in process, the female front desk checked in with a stiff tone and no smile. She asked if we could arrange a room with a higher floor and a better view, and she refused directly. Then I arrived in the room. There was a green rag on the bed frame. The plastic water retaining plate of the shower door fell off as soon as the door was pushed. There were many grains of sand under the wooden board of the TV cabinet, and there were many hairs on the ground. I called the front desk and the cleaning staff came to the room to apologize. As a five-star hotel, this sanitary condition is really unacceptable. The cleaning staff said they would help us wipe it again, and then left. After a while, the duty manager came to the room to apologize and asked if we needed to change rooms. Since we were all very tired, we didn't change. The duty manager offered to send us two breakfasts, and we accepted the attitude of handling this issue. At about two o'clock in the morning, the guests in the next room were talking loudly in the corridor and woke up. The air conditioning was too poor, and I woke up from the heat and sweated. The experience was really bad. The next morning, we went to the 25th floor for breakfast. The front desk said that we needed to swipe the room card. After swiping the room card, they said that only one person could have breakfast. The duty manager did not make a good handover with the restaurant front desk, so we stood there and were laughed at by other hotel guests. Later, the restaurant front desk called to ask before letting us in to eat. After taking the food and sitting down, I took a fork and found that there was oil stains on it. I called the waiter to deal with it, but he just wiped it with his hand and put it back. As a hotel staff, didn’t this waiter do the most basic training? Even the express hotel would not be so bad. When I checked out, I went downstairs to pick up a bunch of luggage, but the doorman ignored me. Fine, I had to take it myself and get on the taxi. The check-in experience of the first M Social in China and the attitude and method of the entire hotel staff to deal with problems were so poor that I was completely disappointed. I came with high expectations and checked out angrily. I will not come again, and please avoid it. Any Hyatt Shangri-La nearby is better than this one.

The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant. The breakfast is good, and there are also pan-fried buns. The bar is just behind the front desk. You can overlook Jinji Lake from a distance.

The hotel called before check-in to guide parking and said that the room has been arranged.

The scenery inside was not disappointing. Although it is a Singaporean brand, the design is benchmarked against Indigo, young, fashionable and colorful.

The highlight is the fitness area on the 5th floor, which is super large. After all, they sell annual cards for more than 7,000. There are also dry and wet saunas, a 25-meter-long heated swimming pool, and a massage pool and a children's pool.

The hardware equipment in the sports area is first-class and spacious, but the waiters in the fitness area need to be trained and improved. I wanted to steam a sauna without water in the basin. The aunt and uncle were chatting at the door. There was a new employee at the front desk who seemed to have just woken up, with messy hair and didn't know anything.

I want to ask: Is your gym outsourced? The spa is also right?
The guest rooms, catering and front desk services must be praised.

msg:The first experience was great. Our room was on the 31st floor. The view from the high floor was also great, and it was facing the Oriental Gate. Although it was a bit far from the gardens and other scenic spots, I think the price/performance ratio was still very high. The environment and facilities were also very new, clean and tidy. The Shenzhen Hong Kong Hotel with the same facilities would definitely cost twice as much. The hotel service was also very good. Before departure, our exclusive butler service lady Joann called to tell us how to check in, parking matters and scenic spot services, etc. She was very considerate and the experience was very comfortable. When I left the hotel, she also gave my husband a birthday cake. It was a pleasant surprise. It is worth coming again next time.

I walked around for a long time and asked the receptionist at the door, but he said he didn't know because he was new. I called the front desk and they told us to find the yellow parking spaces and their attitude was indifferent. I really want to take you to see how many types of yellow parking spaces there are. The front desk was very good when checking in, and they took the initiative to help with things. The room environment was in line with the price.

The account manager Joann gave me detailed parking directions and enthusiastically introduced the features of the hotel. The hotel is right on the bank of Jinji Lake, and the sky lobby faces Suzhou's landmark Oriental Gate with beautiful scenery. The overall environment is elegant, the guest room area is reasonably arranged, neat and clean. The only drawback is that the guest room is too warm and the temperature cannot be lowered in cooling mode.

msg:On the day of check-in, after receiving the confirmation call and adding WeChat, I just felt that all this was the normal service standard for staying in a hotel. After arriving at the hotel, Joann took the initiative to inform me that it was the person who added WeChat, which instantly made me feel the high-standard service that I had not seen in so many hotels for a long time.
Now there are many hotel brands, and each hotel emphasizes the service experience, but loses the essence of the most basic "heart" service, and Joann really made me feel "hearted reception".
The friend who checked in later was also immediately associated with my friend when he handed in his ID card, which really surprised us all.
Such hearted reception is the essence of service. No matter how much material is, it cannot compare to the most sincere trea**ent. Thank you Joann for your heart, which may be insignificant, but it is the most impressive part of the whole journey. Even if the product has imperfections, it will be weakened because of sincerity.

It turns out that we made the right choice as far as the hotel is concerned. Unfortunately, there is infrastructure construction nearby and we can't walk directly to the lake now. The location of Qianxiuyue cannot be overemphasized. The hardware facilities and software services are excellent. Before check-in, Joann at the front desk contacted her by phone and added WeChat to tell her in detail how to park, which made the journey to the hotel very smooth. I parked my car directly and headed to the lobby. next to the elevator. This time, because many places around Jinji Lake are undergoing maintenance and construction, it is not ideal to check in. I will come back to Qianxiuyue when all the lakeside is accessible.

msg:The hotel is quite new and the location is relatively good. There are major business districts next to it, making it very convenient for shopping and dining. Because of the Chinese New Year, the room was cleaned very slowly, and we only successfully checked in around 15:30 that day.
It is relatively new that the room can be controlled with an iPad, but the bathroom design of the room does have a lot to complain about. If the movable glass door completely covers the bathroom and toilet, it will take a lot of effort to move it. Neither the glass door of the bathroom nor the toilet has a damping design, so if the door is closed lightly, it will not close, and if it is closed harder, it will crack loudly. The niche in the bathroom is too narrow and it is very inconvenient to put some of your own bath and toiletries. It can be seen that the hotel's service staff are all young and have good service awareness. The hardware design is indeed lacking in some aspects. But overall it's better and I would still recommend friends to stay here

The design of the hotel is outstanding, and it cannot be said to be a business hotel. If you are traveling with your family, this hotel looks a bit strange, because many facilities are not very friendly to the elderly at home, especially the decoration of the restaurant seats, which makes it difficult to sit and eat! Viewed before Several comments. Indeed, the hotel staff are a bit condescending and not very friendly, and the hotel service is also very average, almost at the level of two or three stars.
The location of the hotel is pretty good, next to Jinji Lake and Jiuguang Depar**ent Store. It's easy to say that the hotel's breakfast is indeed rich. But compared with the prices of surrounding hotels, I think M SOCIAL is not cost-effective! You can experience it before making a comment

msg:Facilities: Located in the core area of ​​Jinji Lake CBD, the lobby and rooms have beautiful views of the Gate of the East and Jinji Lake. The lobby and restaurant are on the 25th floor, and the gym and swimming pool are on the 5th floor. The facilities have reached the same standard as MSocial in Singapore, which is great👍
Hygiene: The room is very clean, and an air purifier is thoughtfully placed in the room. The linens and bath towels are also OK. The rhinitis star did not feel any discomfort, excellent! The only fly in the oin**ent is that I hope the bathrobe can be adjusted to an unopened one later, which will feel more hygienic.
Service: Miss Joann's service is very considerate, her enthusiasm is just right, and she can seriously meet individual needs. The happy hour (17:00-19:00) is very nice, it can basically be regarded as a simple meal, and the drinks are also very good. In addition to pure drinks, you can also make them according to your needs. The technical level of the water bar guy is online and very good.

The overall stay experience exceeded expectations. I will choose MSocial next time I come to Suzhou 🙂

msg:Booked using a 2-night group purchase voucher. It is a new hotel with a very good location. It is in the Jinji Lake business district. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the nearby Jiuguang and see the lake view. The new hotel bathroom is open, which is a bit awkward. The service was very good. Special thanks to the beautiful lady at the front desk who temporarily solved our small needs during our stay. There is also Ms. Feng Nana, the reservation customer service yvette, yvette contacted us in advance to arrange all the service needs of the room and sent us photos of the meals. The breakfast and happy hour meals are not particularly varied but of good quality. The swimming pool has a small heated massage pool, which is particularly comfortable when you are tired. The overall value for money is very good.

When the next door uses the hair dryer, my whole room will explode. I really don't know what kind of design this is. It's just a high-end hotel with a false appearance, and it's very different from the old high-end hotels. Prices vary greatly, so book with caution

The room is larger, but the pillows are not very comfortable. The air conditioning is very stuffy... Windows need to be opened for ventilation. , the hotel restaurant has a small breakfast with few choices. The Chinese restaurant is Xiyue No. 8 and is also on the 25th floor. The hotel does not have an entertainment area for children, but it is convenient for travel. There are shopping malls and supermarkets nearby.

Unfortunately, there was too much haze outside and Jinji Lake was misty. The scenery would have been nice on a sunny day. The swimming pool and gym are also very good, except that there are a lot of children in the swimming pool which affects the experience. The breakfast is not bad, but there are too many people, so you need to reserve a seat. Overall a good experience

Breakfast must arrive before nine o'clock. To be honest, it's not bad! But after this point in time, it’s like rushing to a venue and there’s no need to make up for it! Feeling bad is worse!
Many basic employees have no proactive service awareness, but to be honest, if you mention the basic employees, their attitudes are very good and very friendly! Even if he is wearing a black uniform and looks average-looking, he still won’t give way!
A manager later told me that it had just opened and it would take time!
But you are a five-star hotel, and your prices are set! Don’t have any reason for this or that! If you are below five stars today, what can I say?

Overall it's pretty good. As for the shortcomings, it is that it is a little closer to the subway station than the Hyatt and Niccolo. But I like the feeling of the lobby upstairs, although it is not like Park Hyatt and Niccolo, where the rooms have to be built upside down. For the hotel's dedicated parking space, just follow the signs, but it's a bit circuitous.

The overall environment is definitely better than that in the old city. The room was very spacious and very comfortable. All the staff were very friendly. ￼

But I think there are a few things the hotel can continue to improve:
1) There is no body lotion provided in the room; in addition, the water provided in the room is also packaged in kraft paper for environmental protection. The convenience of carrying is not considered and it is unhygienic without a lid.
2) The air conditioning and ventilation in the elevator are insufficient. When we stayed for two days and there were many guests, the elevator ride usually took a long time, but because of the insufficient ventilation, it felt very stuffy￼￼
3) We also ate at the bar on the night we checked in. Every table had signs saying no smoking was allowed, but there was a table where the guests were very drunk. When we entered, we could smell a strong smell of smoke, but no one came to that table. table guest reminder

After being given a temporary room, there were all kinds of hairs on the toilet, and I was even more speechless about hygiene. More than an hour after making a manual complaint on Ctrip, the hotel manager on duty called to change the room. The service attitude of all hotel employees can only be described as indifferent and they look down on us guests. I paid extra to buy breakfast at the hotel. First of all, it was the first time that no one arranged a seat, so I had to stand and find it by myself. Secondly, there are very few varieties and extremely poor service, giving people a messy experience. Finally, he said that he would never stay in such a "high-end" hotel again.

Before I even checked in, the housekeeper Zora called me to inquire about the arrival time, and told me that the room would be opened in advance for ventilation, and she thoughtfully sent me the garage navigation. Although I parked on the ground and didn't use it, I was still very considerate. The hotel is very new, including the decoration concept and humanistic concept. Compared with traditional hotels, it emphasizes the feeling of home: such as the copywriting written on the glass, the design on the welcome fruit plate, the cute little towels and handwritten cards. They are all dedicated to making customers feel as warm and casual as home. When we arrived at the hotel, Zora took the initiative to receive us warmly, answered some questions I was curious about, and even reminded us of the breakfast time and other specific information the next day. I was really attentive and comfortable. Although I ventilated the hotel in advance on the day I arrived, I closed the windows at night and did not notice any peculiar smell in the room the next day. The kettle and coffee pot are brand new and of good brands. Four capsules of coffee are enough for drinking. Many guests reported that The drinking water was not enough. Fortunately, I not only saw four boxes as soon as I entered the door, but also replenished two more boxes when I returned to the room at night, which was completely enough. There is also a lobby on the 25th floor. Many hotels in China, such as Suning Wanda and abroad, will arrange the hotel lobby on a different floor according to local conditions, which will not affect any check-in and out procedures... In short, I am very satisfied with my stay. , you still have to try it yourself to discover the real existence.

msg:Everyone knows that I am very picky about hotels, but I was pleasantly surprised when I accidentally discovered the newly opened M social this time. It is located close to other super 5-star hotels and has a panoramic view of the lake. I am over 1,000 and was very generous and took the initiative to upgrade during the National Day. For the lake view suite room, check-in was also very fast and the manager was very polite and eye-catching. The guest rooms are oversized, clean and smell-free, and the soft appliances inside are all new and up-to-date. Both the living room and the room can see an unobstructed view of the lake. The bathtub has a floor-to-ceiling panoramic view, so you can feel comfortable taking a bath while looking out at the open space. The view, the bathroom is large and the space is reasonably spaced. The bed is also medium firm and very comfortable to sleep on. I definitely recommend friends around me to come and experience this hotel when they come to Suzhou.

The second one told me that they were checking out and asked me to wait. No one showed up for breakfast the next day, so I had to find a seat by myself. How can I say that as a five-star hotel, the service awareness is not good, but the hotel environment is still okay, and it can be seen that it is a newly built hotel. I probably won’t stay here again next time

It is very convenient for shopping and eating. Joann, the housekeeper, had already added WeChat before the trip. Since we had a baby, she thoughtfully prepared hand-painted cards and balloons for us, and also decorated the room. The baby was very happy. The hotel's afternoon tea is also very good, both delicious and beautiful. The decoration style of the room is simple and fashionable, and the view is also very eye-catching. You can have a panoramic view of Jinji Lake day and night. I will continue to choose M social next time I come to Suzhou!

They were vague and couldn’t explain clearly, and they didn’t let me apply for them. Maybe I just didn’t want to apply for them. It was very unprofessional. I couldn’t get them until I checked out. As a courtesy, the breakfast room is very small and is on the same floor as the lobby. It is a noisy vegetable market and you have to occupy a seat to eat. There is a person who ate half of his hair out of some rice noodles. The so-called lake view rooms are all fake. Downstairs is a construction site and high-rise buildings. What kind of scenery is this? If it can be called a lake view.

The hygiene in the room was okay, but I saw this little yellow pill on the floor and I didn't know what it was. What I need to complain about is that the bath water was too cold, with only a little heat, and I felt a little cold the next day. The second complaint is that there are too few supplies. There is nothing except a toothbrush and comb, and there are only two bath towels. After all, there is a bathtub in your room. I guess this is not the case in a fast hotel. Breakfast is the highlight, the variety is really full and the taste is okay.

msg:I chose M social for this trip to Suzhou because I was initially attracted by its “newness”. It was my daughter's birthday this time, so I called the hotel in advance to make some arrangements in the room to surprise her. The hotel arranged for Ms. Joann, the manager of the guest experience depar**ent, to communicate with me. The communication was also very professional and serious. On the day I checked in, all the decorations and little surprises were beyond expectations. The child was also very happy, and it created a very important experience in her life! Thank you very much again Ms. Joann. Because of her professional service, I will choose your hotel for my next trip to Suzhou. I hope your hotel can maintain such professionalism and efficiency as always.
Rate the hotel:

Facilities: The automated curtains in the guest rooms are pretty good, but it's a pity that the toilet is not smart. I stayed here for 2 days and the water temperature didn't go up when I took a shower the next day. I later contacted the front desk and said there was something wrong with the facilities, which was a bit of a loss. In addition, some of the key panels in the hotel rooms are loose, which feels like a slight disadvantage for a newly renovated hotel. The gym and swimming pool are very satisfactory, especially for me, a fitness enthusiast, they are 10% satisfying.


Hygiene: average


Environment: Along Jinji Lake, there are all the beautiful scenery you should have


Service: The service staff from inside to outside are very professional and meet the standards of a five-star hotel, which shows that the hotel's staff training is in place.

Ps: Finally, thank you again to Ms. Joann from the hotel's guest experience depar**ent. Thank you for your professionalism and seriousness, which made our trip a perfect experience.

msg:As a hotel that advertises a 5⃣️star single-day room rate of more than 1,000 yuan, there are many deficiencies, especially in the professionalism of staff services.
First of all, the front desk of the gym, when I went to exercise early in the morning on the first day, there was someone at the front desk but no one came to ask for the room number and ask for registration. The next day, that is, I went early this morning. I first poured water to get a towel, and when I turned around, a big boy stood behind me silently, which shocked me a lot. Then, he directly asked me very impolitely, "Are you a resident or someone?" I showed my room card and told me that I was a resident, and he said very rudely, "Come with me, we need to register here. "I followed him out of the gym to check in at the front desk outside. But I was very angry. First of all, as a service person, shouldn't I say hello when it's just me in the early morning? Do I have to go with you to register? Won't you come into the gym with the form and sign it for me? Does your hotel not teach the language and attitude of the service staff?
Secondly, the man at the front desk who handled the check out today looked dull and unskilled in business. Unanswered questions. I also need the girl next door to help.
Finally, the lobby on the first floor and the 25th floor (let's call it the lobby) does not meet the standard of a 5⃣️ star hotel at all.
By the way, when I was having breakfast yesterday, I was very surprised to see the three chefs from the side of fried eggs and fried sausages gathered and chatted at the post for the first time in a five-star hotel. And the chef who cooks noodles next door can come over to visit. The counter that caused the noodles to be cooked was completely devoid of chefs. Even if there are not so many customers, you can't leave your post during working hours, and still be in front of the guests, right?
To sum up, the hotel is new, and the hardware facilities of the room are not bad. The room service spread out the tablecloth and pushed the dining car to a full sense of ceremony. But the professionalism and dedication of the service really needs to be improved. Hope to see improvement next time.

Hygiene: Hygiene is good, everything is clean on the surface.
Environment: The hotel is located in an excellent location in the industrial park, surrounded by shopping centers and high-end office buildings. As a relatively new hotel, the decoration style is also very modern, and it blends well with the surrounding environment!
The room overlooks Jinji Lake, the lake view is bright!
Service: The service attitude is very good and basically in place. Can do more comprehensive and thoughtful!
Two suggestions: 1. Hotel toiletries are not easy to use, and do not match the style and level of the hotel.
2. There is a small episode: the hotel room service staff entered the room to check in the afternoon on the grounds of counting towels. I also asked if there were any missing items, which was very baffling. Communicate this problem with the lobby when checking out, and the lobby said it doesn't know about it. I hope that such incidents will be avoided in the future!

The hotel has convenient transportation. There are many large shopping malls around. It is close to Jinji Lake and Eslite Bookstore. It is also very convenient to navigate to various attractions.
The internal facilities of the hotel are very new, and every staff member is very enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to help press the elevator, carry luggage, and prepare small gifts for the children when they check in.
The visual and functional design of the room is great, you can see the Gate of the East and Jinji Lake, and the night view is beautiful. If I come to Suzhou again, I will stay at MSOCIAL again.

con: The building is under construction downstairs, and there is occasional noise from the construction site.
The sound insulation of the floor is average, and the sound of walking upstairs is a bit noisy.
The underground car park is chaotic and it's not easy to find a dedicated parking space for the B3 hotel.
The front desk is on the 25th floor. From the room to the swimming pool, you have to change two elevators and go up another floor.

msg:Taking advantage of the summer vacation, I brought my children to Suzhou for two days. On the weekends of the summer vacation, the hotel prices are not cheap. There are many old-fashioned hotels around Jinji Lake. In the end, I chose to stay because M SOCIAL is relatively new.
Because I was in a hurry to check out, I still forgot the big fresh facial cleanser in the bathroom. In order to confirm whether I stayed in the hotel, I called the hotel late at night, and the phone rang and got connected👍, Wenchy at the front desk was very nice, After helping me to record the situation, she replied the next morning that I could deliver it for me. I would like to thank her for her efficiency!
Then let me talk about my opinions and suggestions. I have reported the problem of the air conditioner. I feel that as long as the air conditioner is set to cooling, no matter how many degrees it is adjusted, it will be the same cold. The controller panel shows 19 degrees, and it is indeed cold at night. arrive.
There is a problem with the cooling of the refrigerator in the room. It has not been refrigerated since the day of check-in, because it is not used and I have not asked the staff, but if the weather is hot, I think the small refrigerator is quite necessary.
As a relatively new five-star hotel, the facilities should also be more adapted to the new environment. Capsule machines are really available, and the water bar is a little smaller.
However, on the 1st floor of the hotel, in-house guests can have a cup of coffee (automatic coffee machine) for free. It is good to go out after taking the coffee. Because even if you want to drive to the parking lot, you have to go to the first floor to change to the elevator to the parking lot, which is the only way to go.
Other services such as check-in, breakfast, and functional pillows such as memory pillows are all good, and I am generally satisfied!

As soon as we left the hotel, I called to inform me that there was a room, too. I am delighted. The check-in waiter is a gentleman who is near the elevator. When I checked in, I happened to have a lot of phone calls. This gentleman still has a very good attitude, neither arrogant nor impatient. It's a pity that I didn't look at his badge, otherwise I can praise him by name. Another good thing is that the letters on the switch button in the room are sensory.

This time I struggled with Nigro for a while, because I stayed at this one at the beginning of the month and felt that it was quite new, so I finally chose this hotel. First of all, the room facilities and equipment are very new. This is an advantage. The hotel’s intelligent robot doesn’t know what kind of wind it is. It asks for water delivery at ten o’clock in the evening. After putting Do Not Disturb on, the phone rang again at three in the middle of the night. Do you know how it feels when the phone rings in the middle of the night? I was so frightened that I jumped up from the bed, all three people were woken up, and complained to the lobby manager, she was very polite, I hope this kind of situation will not happen again. In addition, there is nothing in the minibar, and it is inexplicable to charge a deposit of 1,000 yuan. Niccolo's service should be more considerate. Add WeChat when you check in, and you will also get fruit and chocolate when you check in. Looking forward to the next stay at M Social will have a different feeling.

It’s very rare for a room at 1500 a night for food delivery. Since there is no food or menu in the room, customers have to order food delivery. There is a food delivery robot in the hall, but it is not used. We communicated with the front desk and refused to deliver the food manually. We have to go down to the first floor to get it by ourselves (you have to transfer to the elevator in the middle). Road, the driver didn’t know that there is a hotel here; the twin room is actually a suite with the middle door locked and divided into two rooms. The door is installed with glass and there is almost no sound insulation. The sound of the child next door playing with a toy car on the ground is also very clear. After watching the concert at night, when we returned to the room, we tried to speak softly so as not to affect the rest of the next room.

The service staff at the front desk always smile and answer questions patiently; the facilities in the room are very new, basically without the taste of decoration; the TV screen can be turned, and you can watch TV even in the bath; bathrobes, toothbrushes and slippers are all There are two colors, it is very good to use it separately from your partner, I like this detail. There are free welcome candies on the first floor, and the children like it very much; I bought a dinner set from Dianping. The dishes are very good, and I enjoyed a relaxing and happy time with my family.

msg:I stayed at the M Social Hotel with my girlfriends for 3 days for the weekend, amazing amazing...Let’s go straight to the theme and summarize it. The hotel is romantic, child-friendly, and down-to-earth modern [#贵族生活酒店]

- Hardware facilities: brand new, the hotel opened in April, fully automatic curtains, 💡

- View: The hotel is right next to Jinji Lake, so you can see two landmarks in Suzhou, long johns and the opposite N Hotel. The bar also has a full lake view. The a**osphere is particularly wavering. There is also a 180-degree landscape area where you can enjoy it with friends. There is a DJ at night (but not every night, I forgot the day of the week)

- Surrounding environment: It is not possible to reach Yuanrun Square, where you can see the longest LED ceiling (refer to the picture), and it is easy to eat and drink; Moonlight Wharf is also very suitable.

- Friends who love skateboarding 🛹, the hotel is 3 minutes away, there is an area by the lake where you can play freely, some people are there every night
-Shopping: Hey, take a taxi for 12 minutes and go shopping with long johns, bought a lot🥰

- People who like to walk: After we go out from the hotel on weekends, we can go for a walk after cycling for a while, and we can go all the way to the area of ​​the mamamia restaurant. Are there any waves in particular?

- There are two kinds of sauna rooms, such as tropical rainforest drizzle🌧️, ice slag, and bubble massage😜, the water temperature is very good, it is a good friend of 【Have a baby👶】, I remember that it is open until 11 o'clock in the evening.

-Party- A suit with a prospect can host a high-end birthday party or company #团建筑

-Business trip friends: They have an area, like the rework space, where you can work quietly or hold small meetings. This is really thoughtful, because I used to travel on business and hold meetings with clients, and I had to rent a meeting room or find a coffee shop, but the environment of the coffee shop was very noisy. This service was really thoughtful for me.

In general, the employees of M Social take care of the customer's feelings. I think this is very good, and they attach great importance to the customer experience.

The hotel room will call in advance to confirm your itinerary, and this time it also arranges guests. The breakfast content is also considered rich, which is worthy of the price. I chose a lake-view room, and I can see far away without any obstructions. It's just that the parking lot is a bit convoluted. The upper floor of a building is a hotel, the lower floor should be an office building, and the underground parking lot is shared. The hotel is dedicated to B3, so you have to carefully look for reminders to spare.

Every time I go back to the hotel, I can see his WeChat service! There is a feeling of being at home ~ and this little gift and note from the hotel are also very heartwarming! It can be said that they are doing their best in service!

Facilities: The hotel is basically equipped with smart central control. There is an ipad in the bedroom that can control the entire room, and the smart toilet in the bathroom is also very good~ Although the hair dryer is not a Dyson, it still has the function of negative ions. It'll be on all the time~ but it won't hurt


Hygiene: Full marks, the cleaning lady is very good, every corner is cleaned very clean


Environment: Very convenient, surrounded by shopping centers, with everything to eat, and you can see Jinji Lake and the Gate of the East! The night view is really amazing 👏


Service: Full marks, the feeling of being at home, the front desk handles the needs very quickly! I just hope that the takeaway can be delivered by robots in the future~ hahaha

This is a very nice hotel! The facilities are new! The service attitude is also very good! Next time I come to Suzhou, I will choose again👍

When I arrived at the store, I felt an unusual enthusiasm. I put my parents and son at the entrance of the lobby on the first floor, and when I came back from the car, I saw my mother sitting there comfortably drinking milk. The hotel lobby is on the 25th floor. The customer service Yvette added my WeChat account the day before and was waiting for me.

The facilities are very satisfactory, and the room service is also in the blink of an eye. The aunts in the room were all smiling and gave me a lot of water to drink more water.

The breakfast is very rich, the views of several restaurants are very good, and the tableware is also very beautiful.

My son goes swimming every day, and there is a pool where babies can play.

The location is very convenient. Going out and turning a corner is Jiuguang.

I found Treasure Hotel. I am satisfied with the service facilities. I hope to keep it up. I will stay here next time I go to Jinji Lake

The so-called smart lake view suite can only see half of the lake view, which is still very far away. The items in the set meal are basically useless and are only used for breakfast and happy hour. The items during happy hour are very scarce, and the orange juice is in limited supply. It’s very petty and not freshly squeezed. He probably won't come again in the future.

The quality of breakfast is still good, but there are no local special desserts, such as mung bean soup in summer, red bean paste dumplings (nuojiji), and small wontons that children like. I hope it will be better if there are some Suzhou specialties

Located in the center of several business districts, it is very convenient for shopping and eating! The scenic spots can be reached by subway, but there is a distance from the subway station. As soon as you step into the hotel, you can feel that this is a hotel full of youthful vigor. The waiters at the front desk and room service restaurant are all young people who can communicate smoothly. The room facilities are mainly smart and environmentally friendly. The reserved lake view room faces the center of Suzhou, and the view is very good ! Let me complain about the lack of room layout and facilities. There are more than 1,300 rooms without coffee machines and smart toilets. The quality of the coffee and tea bags provided is average, and the toiletries are average. The conditioner needs to be requested by the guest! The bathing layout of the bathroom with wet and dry separation is strange. Next to the shower is the bathtub, which is inconvenient for bathing! The floor of the room near the floor-to-ceiling windows creaked when I stepped on it, and I felt cheap instantly! The hotel management is still not capable of dealing with emergencies, and I hope to continue to work hard to get better and better!

msg:When choosing a hotel before this trip, I have been hesitating between Niccolo and M Social. After reading the reviews, I found that Niccolo has routines in room types, so I chose M decisively. Facts have proved that this choice was very successful. With the same lake view, the price of M is more advantageous. M has complete hardware facilities, advocates environmental protection♻️, and the software service is first-class. Before check-in, Yvette from the social experience depar**ent of the hotel contacted me proactively to confirm the order information, and asked about any needs during the check-in period, which can be prepared for guests in advance. Any needs and questions during the stay, Yvette can respond in time and solve them satisfactorily. With her help, I added a lot of points to this travel experience. Next time you come to Suzhou, M SOCIAL is the first choice.

The service of the wild garden for breakfast is first-class, free coffee, free freshly baked egg tarts to taste, and the waiter will take the initiative to deliver it to the door table to ask if you want to taste various pastries? There are salmon and various sushi, and the appetite is whetted. The food is fresh and the taste is good👍In short, it was a perfect experience. Hope to keep recommending a friend.

From check-in to check-out, from breakfast to room service, everything is thoughtful and "customer-oriented".
The fly in the oin**ent is that it is newly opened. Although the hardware is new, there are still some minor deficiencies. For example, the air conditioner is too cold, and the toilet has a constant sound of water. Although it is a minor fault, I hope it can be improved when I check in next time.

All hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello and provide services when they see guests.
The hotel's breakfast has a special service, which is to ask the guests whether to drink tea or coffee when they first take their seats, and throughout the meal process, the staff will bring the meal to the guest's table from time to time to ask if they need it. Haven't had this kind of service in years.
There are eggs Benedict and croissants with pistachio sauce in the breakfast, which is very special.
Here I would like to thank Yvette from the social experience depar**ent for her excellent service throughout the check-in process.

As a result, the large and small bags that were carried in the elevator could not be swiped out. I followed other guests to other floors, then returned to the 25th floor to check in, and asked the front desk to apply for the card again. It was very difficult. It's inconvenient, and it seems very unprofessional for a 5-star standard hotel, and the experience is very poor.
The hardware facilities in the room are generally good and the environment is clean, but it is not convenient to have to drive back and forth between two elevators.
On the day of check-out, I received a call to remind me of the check-out time. Because there was an online meeting, I asked the front desk if I could check out before 2 o'clock. The front desk's attitude was very blunt and said that please hurry up. It seems that I have not received any relevant etiquette training. As a Ctrip Black Diamond Members are disappointed to receive this attitude.

When I checked in, the room was generally hygienic, and there were dirty things (hair) on the toilet floor. There was sand in the bathtub. Fortunately, the waiter sent a disposable bathtub cover later. In addition, in the early stage of check-in, there was no contact with the exclusive service personnel mentioned in other reviews, which was also a bit disappointing. But what is commendable is that the staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic, and there are free coffee and candies on the first floor. During breakfast, the head chef saw that we brought the children and sent a box of small biscuits. The children were very happy.

The check-in hall is on the 25th floor, and you can see the Gate of the East with a good view. The front desk staff spoke very gently. Before check-in, they called to inquire about the situation of the elderly and their children. They had already put the children's toilet slippers in the room in advance. There are many types of breakfast, which fully meet the needs of the elderly and children. They are very happy to eat, and the staff will come to deliver some freshly prepared meals from time to time.
The staff are all young and look energetic, and the hotel as a whole is relatively fashionable. Next time I come to Suzhou, I will consider staying here again.

The parking lot is difficult to find and lacks guidance
The lake-view rooms are divided into grades, which may not be right for pants, but the rooms facing Jinji Lake are not covered
It may be due to the rain, and the stains on the floor-to-ceiling windows at close range are more obvious. You need to contact the front desk to open the window, but the window only has ventilation function
There are robots, but takeaways cannot go to the hotel lobby
The attitude of the front desk is average, but the attitude of the manager is good

Now hotels rarely see such scenes. The huge video on the ground floor is too shocking. Unfortunately, I asked the waiter for the name of this video. The answer is that there is no one yet. I suggest you ask the guests to name it. If there is a chance, I will stay again. The only downside is that the hotel's dedicated parking space in the underground garage and the guidance for going upstairs to the hotel lobby are a little less. Everything else is perfect.

When I entered the room, I found a small bug and hit it. I thought it accidentally flew in. At night I called three more before going to bed, thinking that it would not affect my sleep so I didn’t call the front desk, but I fell asleep until 2:30, when there was a thunderstorm and rain outside, and the exhaust vents in the room started to whistle, making me unable to sleep because of the noise, so I changed the room overnight. When I checked out in the morning, I reported the situation to the front desk. I didn't apologize, and I didn't deal with the problem directly. I just brushed it off. This is a problem with the design of the hotel, but I think it's more about the attitude of the hotel front desk to deal with the problem. , if you don't pay attention to this problem, next time you will still have this problem!

There are caring butlers from I kept communicating without checking in, and prepared balloons and candies for the child when I checked in, which made my daughter who is already taller than me very happy! On the last night, there was a problem with the water in the bathroom. I reported it to the housekeeper, and someone came to deal with it within two minutes. The staff was very dedicated, and they stepped on the water with bare feet to clear it... I feel that the biggest highlight of this hotel is that every job is done from top to bottom The staff are very service-minded, and they are warm and considerate to the guests~ I like this place!

msg:On the first day of the Dragon Boat Festival, I stayed at the hotel and felt extremely bad.

Unable to check in at 15.00, told the room was not cleaned well, let us go out and go shopping again, left a call to the front desk, but no one called for more than an hour, returned to the hotel front desk to inform that the cleaning was not finished, what kind of efficiency is this, check in at 15.00 It is a public rule of the hotel. If the room staff can't complete it, don't sell so many rooms.

The water delivery in the room is finished. The hotel does not have a good daily reserve at all, and the most basic drinking water cannot be brought out at night. The water in the room itself is also 200ml of soft drink water, which is not enough to drink.

There was a long queue for breakfast. For breakfast on the second day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the hotel’s breakfast area was full. People who had breakfast after 9 o’clock basically had to wait for everyone, and the bar area next to it was not open for breakfast.

It can be said that it was a very bad stay experience, and I can't wait to ask for a check-out fee in full.

服務：管理規範，硬件達標，高空酒店有金雞湖城市景觀，晚上燈亮了很漂亮。地理位置不錯，想去金雞湖和看金雞湖景觀的網友，這家還是值得推薦的。

環境：外部環境，高空酒店很多，但是能看地標的不多，蘇州地標大褲衩，國金中心，千秀悦都能看到。

內部環境：風格年輕時尚，硬件不錯，空間夠用  佈局合理好用，控制智能化，符合當下市場。

設施：與樓下的健身房合作，可免費使用，非常棒，泳池很棒 還有泡池 桑拿 鹽浴房

早餐的服務人員很糟糕，入住第一天早餐，由於酒店規定的最後取餐時間10:30所以我們10:15趕在供餐結束之前用餐。服務人員為了12:00的生日餐會，10:45就要求我們離開。我們拒絕，
後來還說不然幫我們打包。這樣無禮把客戶當乞丐的姿態，顯示出服務人員的水平以及對於工作流程的忽視。甚至還請我們諒解服務人員…..住客付費 吃早餐，還要去諒解服務人員所以自認倒霉趕快滾蛋嗎？住宿第二天的早餐更誇張，10點整過去，食材幾乎都沒有了，也沒有補充。要求現場餐廳人員補充吐司，她才慢吞吞拿出藏在後面的3片吐司，我的天啊，早餐時段還沒結束，不補充食材，還把食材藏起來，我都要氣笑了。餐廳的人員訓練、現場的管理失能，真是貽笑大方！

退房時自己忘記帶東西回家，還麻煩體驗部的姑娘給我快遞回來。

但是枕頭過高，連續兩晚睡醒都落枕，且不是左右轉頭不便，而是低頭仰頭巨痛…希望可以多給一種枕頭供客人選擇
另外一個問題：入住當天13:15到達大堂辦理入住，被告知客房還在清掃，需要等待，15:00後才給房卡，並要了聯繫方式，説有房間空出來回電話聯繫，可能由於是春節期間，客人多，退房時間不定，我可以理解，並且也選擇了去周邊商場逛逛。然而在15:15回到酒店大堂之前一個電話也沒有，被要求排隊等待辦理入住給房卡，親眼見證了排在我之前的顧客在發火後迅速拿到房卡，難道表示理解客客氣氣等兩個小時還不如一通怒吼來得有效？酒店check in/check out的流程制度還有很大的提升空間啊

最要稱道的是最難的——服務水平，確實是新加坡酒店集團，服務可圈可點。從前台到餐廳到健身房泳池到停車場，每一位碰到的員工都很nice，主動但不過度，有很自然的笑容。尤其感謝Joann美女，提前加了微信，給升級了房型，會關心我們的行程抵達時間，為女兒手寫了聖誕卡片，還為女兒送來了小紀念品。以上小事為這三天兩夜的行程確實增光添色。
最後給予兩點小建議：1、潤膚乳若能配備，在乾燥冬日裏會更暖心；2、枕頭及備用枕規格相同，若能配備低枕適用不同人羣會更好
酒店行業我覺得最終決勝於服務，決勝於細節，祝越來越好

msg:説實話不會再住。
看似高大上的網紅酒店，其實就是粉飾後的快捷酒店。首先，硬件很一般，房間小布局很緊湊，minibar內除了水啥都沒有，給個ipad來轉換場景就是噱頭，實用性很低。不過房間很新是真的，畢竟剛開業不久。不過基礎的設施倒也都有，掛浴巾的架子可以用來曬衣服，浴缸也還行，床挺大沙發也挺長，電視還可以無線投屏。泳池很小，但是有按摩泳池還挺舒服。 其次，服務也不太行，大部分接待人員都很鬆散。早餐也不太行。衞生打掃那叫一個迅速，簡單搞搞就結束了。
房間的隔音真差，第一天入住，午睡時被旁邊房間看亞運會的歡呼聲吵醒，夜裡被另一件情侶吵架聲吵醒，根本睡不着，第二天的午睡又是被看亞運會的歡呼吵醒。酒店主打一個新潮和social，酒店裡也住了很多新潮人士，晚上蹦迪的聲音持續到深夜，住27樓根本睡不着。入住的幾天睡不好覺是真崩潰。
總體來説，是一個形式大於內容的酒店，服務也較懶散和傲慢。不過挺適合潮流人士入住。

環境：景觀房視野不錯，但是想看秋褲要住靈動湖景房，但是給我們的樓層有點低29樓，大片湖被對面樓擋住，入住需要注意，而且下面還是工地實在是美中不足。

服務：服務員很主動也熱情，非常滿意

設施：床品杯子枕頭都太硬不舒服，平板智能控制房間設施很不錯。

1.問酒店門僮附近的商場完全不知道怎麼走
2.問酒店阿姨拿毛巾掉在外面門口了繼續給我
3.房間內的燈關不掉問前台怎麼弄不知道問ipad怎麼控制房間 密碼多少不知道反正什麼都不知道房間裏的電話也是壞的打不通
4.房間燈線路板壞了阿姨説衹能拔掉插座fine 要麼全暗 要麼全亮
5.外賣可以幫忙拿上來的主要簽食品安全自己負責的協議就行但是前台一開始會拒絕很多次
6.最後真的很不能接受的是在延遲退房的那個小時裏有酒店員工直接刷卡進來了 也沒確認房間裏是否有人就進來 真的呆了 我問是誰 這位員工轉身就逃 是員工不更應該當時就和我溝通嗎

특히 동방지문을 룸에서 볼수 있는 장점도 있는데 룸마다 가격이 다르다고 생각한다면 가성비는 낮네요

所以，不在考慮再次返店！！

大年初三一家三口玩到快10點多回酒店，當天是從香格里拉酒店搬過來住的。旅行嘛，想多住幾家。看着評論和裝修都挺喜歡的。結果就是這樣，10點進去洗澡，一直是温温涼的水，反覆確認開關，還是不行。要老公打電話問前台，精彩的來了！前台回覆現在是用水高峯期，因為大家都是這個時間洗澡。所以沒有熱水。建議晚點再洗。
聽聽吧！這是1000多一晚的酒店，還是新開的。你告訴我要錯峯洗澡，合理嗎？快捷酒店也不會如此吧！
更精彩的再後面。我們從10點到電話到11點30，一共4個電話，再加發了微信給前台。直到第二天早晨10點我去吃早飯都沒有一個工作人員來看看情況。就是這麼一個態度。我不找他們，他們當啥事情也沒有發生，初三晚上一家三口洗着冷水澡。孩子等到11點30都還是冷水。我真理解不了這酒店的供水系統！
第二天是我在前台發火了，才給我想的辦法換到高樓層，從34換到了37，理由是無法保證我第二天晚上是不是還繼續是冷水。。。大家自己品吧！

The attitude of the check-in staff needs to be improved. To go to the room, you have to take another elevator. The aisle to the room is narrow and silent, and there is no air conditioning. The room decoration is like an express hotel. The refrigerator has not been empty since the beginning, and a deposit is required for check-in (the room fee has been paid by Ctrip). I don’t know what deposit is charged? The hotel gym and swimming pool are not hotels, they are buildings shared with the outside world, and the hotel is only shared. You have to take two elevators to the fifth floor, and then go to the fourth floor. The waiter didn't know what to ask. fainted.

msg:這個酒店不錯的，地段就在金雞湖久光圓融時代廣場附近，距離地鐵站步行十分鐘。上午到達的早了，沒有房間就寄存了行李箱出去逛逛，下午辦理入住很熱情給了頂層的房間，不過並沒有免費升級，可能旺季吧，酒店的房間裝修還是比較舒適的，開放式的梳洗台，雖然和床的距離比較相近，但很巧妙，並不影響睡覺。床也是比較舒服的。
説點需要提升的吧，外賣點餐放在一樓的櫃子上，並不能送到房間門口，客人需要轉兩次電梯才能到一樓，先坐電梯到25樓，出電梯再換另一部電梯到一樓。相當麻煩，很好奇樓層的送餐機器人是怎麼使用的？沒有説明和告知。
另外酒店房間的冰箱是空的，現在很多酒店都會贈送首輪飲料。
酒店附近有工地，白天打樁聲音很大，附近一家酒店我們入住的時候就會主動提醒我們致歉，並贈送耳塞，但辦理入住時小姐姐回覆沒有噪音，實際上噪音還是很大的，房間裏也沒有耳塞。
其他沒啥問題，總的來説，這家酒店還是值得推薦的。

環境：坐落在金雞湖畔，視野很好。房間正對金雞湖風景。25層的大堂和餐廳可以看到城市天際線。周邊就是園區核心商區，地理位置很不錯，逛街步行可達。

服務：可能是住過服務最周到的酒店。雖然定位在輕奢，但是和香格里拉的那種無微不至不相上下，衹是風格上更加親和、年輕化。周到、貼心貫穿了整個旅程。也特別感謝Freja的熱情接待，和Yvette周到安排，感受到了與傳統五星級酒店別樣的氛圍。

感覺真的把服務做到了細節裏的酒店，推薦！

定的湖景房,到現場才知道我們定的湖景房不是對着金雞湖而是另外一個湖……要加錢才能對着金雞湖……

房間定的大床,衹有兩個枕頭,一般酒店都是四個,晚上要睡了發現枕頭不夠就打電話要,二十分鐘還沒送來,困得不行再打才送來,結果送來一個超高枕頭,比之前兩個差不多……因為太困了就先湊合了……第二天早上問了經理才知道,房間衣櫥上面就有兩個常規枕頭,但是夜班服務人員根本不知道也沒提過這個事情。

淋雨的支架是松的,衹能拿着洗澡,第二天維修好

沒有鞋拔子!

早飯沒有人帶位,也不知道空位是走了還是繼續在用餐,找不到位置

餐食一般也沒有特別好吃的東西

電梯很不方便,從地庫到房間要換三部

停車地面位置很少,地庫要停到B3繞好久才能到

千禧集團下的酒店,整體還是蠻失望的,畢竟北京千禧我還是很喜歡的。

位置方便，隔壁和對面都有商場，對面還有久光百貨，方便購物。裏月光碼頭衹有10分鐘的距離。住了36樓，晚上能欣賞金雞湖的夜景。
到了上午11點，提前讓我們入住，還可以推遲退房。游泳池設施好、人不多，晚上和早上都能享受了“個人專用”泳池。早餐也非常豐富。非常滿意熱情周到的服務態度。
總的來説，如果想度過悠閑的蘇州生活，強力推薦！

其次，這個房間裝修沒好，馬桶間是一股下水道的味道，一定要換了馬桶間的門才好一點，一塌糊塗！新裝修的酒店搞得這樣，我是萬萬沒想到的。

酒店服務很好，應該是因為新酒店吧，整體人員熱情度和積極度是我近一年以來住的五星裏最好的
特別感謝前台的wenchy，在我訴説了遺失了重要物品後，第一時間幫我去房間找到了，以前也在別的酒店遺落過物品，跟這次的時效性不能相比，我比較懶，雖然住的次數多但是除非酒店太差或者太特別，否則不會評論，這次是非常感謝wenchy的主動迅速響應來寫下評論
