msg:Beautiful small Japanese-style hotel with helpful service and delicious breakfast buffet and Japanese set. The room was super nice. It felt like being in Japan when we were in the hotel and room. Amenities are good and they had extra amenities at the entrance to the elevator. The staff was very helpful and kind! It is about 15 mins walk to jing’an temple. We would definitely return here!

msg:Unfortunately the photos at the website are a bit misleading. The room was a total disaster. Basically no storage for anything anywhere. No space to even put shaving cream and shaver. No space to put anything at the sink and in the shower. First look when I entered it was ok but once you start unpacking or using the toilet and shower the disaster starts. The shower is so weak and not stable with the temperature. The Aircon wasn’t working the last night and it was so cold. The windows are badly fitted. Cold air and especially noise from the street is coming straight and unfiltered to your room. I am on the second highest floor.  The lights would not turn on for like two minutes after entering the room. Each button has to be pushed twice to switch on lights. Everything was making me mad. It’s the worst experience and I can’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Unless I wanna punish that person. And also can’t work in the room literally no space !  Breakfast also is just for the eyes. First look it looks ok on photos but when you are a totally sitting there and tried some of the food it was just so poorly made and tastes bad.  The only and really only good thing about this place is the coffeemaker in the lobby. But they sometimes don’t refill it. …

The staff is kind and friendly, even if many of them are not speaking English, they try there best to communicate with foreigners.
I had an early departure and the receptionist was so kind to make me a coffee and some muffins to go.
The area is full with small coffee shops and restaurants and after a short walk the Nanjing Road area can be reached.
I’m looking forward to come back again.

The location is convenient as it's in the middle of the city, a ten minute car ride to popular locations. The breakfast was average but the service outstanding. The reception was very patient with my lack of Chinese and I was able to use Google translate when needed.

msg:I recently stayed at the Ginco Hotel in Shanghai and was thoroughly impressed. The hotel's central location is perfect for both business and leisure travelers. The rooms are well-designed and comfortable, providing a cozy retreat after a busy day.

The amenities are excellent, with a state-of-the-art fitness center, a rejuvenating spa, and a rooftop pool offering stunning city views. The breakfast buffet, though small, is diverse and high-quality, catering to various tastes with both Chinese and Western options.

The standout feature of the Ginco Hotel is its exceptional staff. From the warm welcome at check-in to the attentive housekeeping, every staff member is dedicated to ensuring a pleasant stay. The front desk team is particularly helpful, offering great local recommendations.

Additionally, the hotel offers a range of extra activities like guided city tours and cooking classes, adding value to the stay and providing unique experiences.

Overall, the Ginco Hotel excels in all aspects, from its prime location and well-built rooms to its top-notch amenities and friendly service. It’s a fantastic choice for anyone visiting Shanghai. I highly recommend it and look forward to returning.

msg:Ideal location for many fine bars and restaurants, and not too far from the Metro. However, the rooms are style over substance in many ways. But the biggest negative was that on my first night the cold A/C function had been locked off, and it worked only as a fan. I discovered this too late and had a miserable night of little sleep before an important day. The next day I complained and the A/C was activated in my room, so I slept well on my second night. The hotel management should never, ever presume to know when customers need A/C or do not need A/C.  It is a completely unacceptable cost-cutting measure that can ruin the most important thing we all want in a hotel, and that’s a good night’s sleep! (And I am not interested if they claim this is to protect the environment, or a fault, or whatever). I will probably never return because their cheapness ruined my first night and the following day. On the plus side, the staff, including the cleaning staff, were really pleasant and helpful.

The hotel's design is sleek and contemporary, with a sophisticated palette of greys, warm wood, and blacks and whites. Everything is impeccably clean and well-maintained, from the lobby to the guest rooms.

Speaking of the guest rooms, they are spacious and luxurious, with comfortable bedding and thoughtful amenities. The bathrooms are especially impressive, with marble countertops, rainfall showers, and high-end toiletries.

But what really sets the Ginco Jing'An hotel apart is the service. The staff members are warm and attentive, always ready to help with anything you need. They'll happily make restaurant recommendations, arrange transportation, or suggest fun activities in the area. Special thanks to Hotel’s staff and manager assistance.

And let's not forget the location. The hotel is situated in the heart of Jing'An, one of Shanghai's most vibrant neighborhoods. You'll be satisfied with choices of restaurants, shopping malls, green alleys and short access to every point of interest ! Enjoy it!

There was no bath even though they had confirmed via email that we could have a bath. When asked, they said no rooms had baths. We were shown a slightly bigger room but minimal difference. I think there are better options for hotels in the area for the price of this one. The sink is also in the room and nowhere to put bathroom products that you bring. The bed was okay but for two people quite small and not enough bedding. 

I wasn’t very impressed with the hotel and probably wouldn’t chose to stay there again.

msg:I have stayed here several times when visiting Shanghai and I have always had a pleasant experience.   The room is clean with a sort of stylish minimalism, but it has everything that you need.  The bed was comfortable, and it has adjustable air-conditioning and a dehumidifier, which is preferable to other hotels that keep the air-conditioning locked at say 24-25 degrees that may be too hot for some.   My request for a shaving kit was promptly answered and received within a few minutes.  Overall, the service was very good. 

My one suggestion: the hotel should buy a couple of irons, so guests can borrow if they need to iron their clothes.  You don't necessarily need one in each room but being able to borrow one when needed is very convenient.  

Otherwise, I think this hotel offers very good value for the price.

There is little storage around basin and lighting was a bit difficult. Staff have limited English but are very attentive to requests. Would be nice to see the VR and digital darts elsewhere perhaps, bit of a vibe kill! Did not try breakfast - great options very close for coffee and brunch.
We’ll be back!

The room had an amazing bed however the bathroom had hairs from possibly the previous guest and also it had a weird smell. Other than that service and toilet and room was great. 

The staff were helpful and very nice and had some basic English which made it easier to communicate.

We were greeted with cute bottles of gin as well as a lovely perfume when we left too. 

By far our favourite hotel in Shanghai - we cannot wait to stay again!

Thank you Jerry and team 😁

The lobby is huge and very nicely decorated, doesn’t feel like you’re in a busy shanghai area at all! The bar and restaurant they have is also very pleasant. The staff at check in were very patient, efficient, and kind. One of them spoke English and was able to help us all run things very smoothly. 

The room is extremely comfortable, the bed is super soft and beddings also top quality. The shower was amazing and they have a Japanese toilet! The blackout curtains are perfect for a sleep in and the television is of great size. 

10/10 loved this hotel and will book again! Recommended stay!

Very convenient and most places easily accessible.  Really loved the interior,it’s as if you are not in the heat and buzz of it all ,the minute you enter the hotel it’s very serene and down to earth environment with very lovely staff. 

Nico is one of the staff contact at the hotel,he was very helpful in helping me settle and getting some additional documents after my stay. 

I also loved their breakfast,it was super filling and the breakfast snoothie thing was yummy. It was also very sweet of them to give me a little gift of tea when I left. Overall it was a pleasant stay.Totally recommend.

I’ll definitely stay here again. The only thing lacking is a workout facility.

msg:I came back from abroad with my family to visit relatives. I wanted to choose a convenient hotel. I found this hotel by chance. After seeing the pictures and reviews, I decided to book it immediately. I arrived at 9 o'clock in the morning. I originally planned to put my luggage in the lobby and go out for a walk. Unexpectedly, the front desk saw that I was carrying a child and so many luggage, so they quickly arranged a room for me to check in early and rest first. The service attitude was even better. I would like to mention the front desk Xiao Yuan, who was very responsible, patient and meticulous. Later, when I needed express delivery, he also took care of it professionally. The aunt who cleaned the room and other employees I met in the corridor all greeted me warmly. I really felt at home. I agreed with my husband that I would stay at this hotel when I return to China in the future!

I think it's so considerate!! The front desk service is also great! They are always responsive! And the overall aromatherapy smell of the hotel is particularly good!! The coffee is also very delicious! This time I used the coupon to book a suite for 700 yuan! It's really worth the money! There is also afternoon tea. Because I didn't get back in time at night, I didn't participate in the sound therapy, but I gave a souvenir! It smells very good! I didn't expect that there is such a comfortable hotel in Jing'an Temple where every inch of land is worth a lot of money! The mattress and pillow are super comfortable! The front is not big, but the inside is a big cave! Recommended!

msg:1. The location is great, a quiet oasis in the bustling city. There are all kinds of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and convenience stores just a few steps away from the wall. It has both the a**osphere of life and the fashionable a**osphere.
2. The facilities and environment are quite comfortable, pure Japanese style, and it has been carefully built. There are also many public spaces, which are much larger than the public areas of general downtown hotels, which is a plus.
3. The quality of the room is OK, there are not many furnitures, no sofas, the level is not up to five stars, but it is above four stars. The full open design is very comfortable for one person to live in, and the supplies are very good, exceeding four stars.
4. The guys at the front desk are very good. They feel like i people, introverted, but they will answer all questions and respond to all requests. They just didn't tell me that there was a cake in the refrigerator in the room when I checked in, which made me think it was left by the previous customer. It was the cleaning lady who told me that I could eat it. It's bright and leisurely, not bad. I hope the guys can take the initiative to introduce various hotel service details.
5. There are many small details. There are personal care products for self-collection at the elevator entrance, and there is a small box that actually has hairpins and sanitary napkins for girls, which is very loving! There are many snacks in the room, and the drinks in the refrigerator are also quite special. I don’t know if they can be eaten, but they seem to be free, which is very considerate;
6 I took a meditation singing bowl class. Teacher Huang was very serious and patient. I was the only guest who took the class seriously and received special tutoring, which was a plus;
7 They also gave me a forest fragrance essential oil from the hotel. I like it very much and will always remember this hotel;
8 Disadvantages: The room windows are not soundproof at all, which is a bit troublesome for light sleepers. The noise from the street is very clear at night. The room is equipped with earplugs, which is somewhat useful. Or you can use the Bluetooth speaker in the room to play some music

msg:During the May Day holiday, I took my children to go shopping and chose this hotel. It is located on Jiaozhou Road, close to Jing'an Temple and Jiuguang Depar**ent Store, and can be reached in about ten minutes on foot. It is quiet in the bustling city and there are many small restaurants around. The hotel has a Japanese style. The public area is not large but the decoration is stylish. However, the small room during the holiday season is only 28 square meters at a price of nearly 1,000 yuan. Let's talk about the room. It's okay, but such a cramped room is the kind that can only sit on the bed except for a stool... Fortunately, I brought my children to live. If a couple or a couple stays, it will be a bit cramped, so you have to book a bigger one. The window faces the residential building and cannot be opened. The sound insulation effect of the room is average, and the conversation in the corridor is very clear. The hygiene is okay, but there is still a lot of dust under the light. The aunt cleans very diligently. She cleaned the room while going down to have breakfast, and the tea she just brewed was poured out. The free items when booking the room were not mentioned when checking in, so I didn't do it. The breakfast quota is partly self-service, and there are not many things, but it is enough. The whole hotel is less than 30 yuan away from Shanghai Station by taxi, and the subway is also very convenient. In general, the overall service is good and it is a good experience.

There are also residential areas nearby that sell traditional Shanghai breakfast rice balls and sauce-flavored cakes, which are very delicious. There are also many shopping malls about one kilometer away from the hotel. It is a very convenient place to stay.
A small essential oil with citrus fragrance was given when I left the hotel. It smelled very good.

There are two sockets next to the coffee machine, one of the three-pin plugs seems to be broken and the device will not start when the plug is plugged in. The open ring of the washbasin is a little peeling, which affects the appearance. It is good to have an air purifier in the room. There is a soft pillow and a slightly higher and firmer pillow. People like me who are not used to sleeping on soft pillows can sleep on the pillow.

Hygiene: The water outlet of the pull-out shower in the bathroom is a bit dirty, I hope to focus on cleaning it. I have stayed in a garbage homestay, and the hygiene of the hotel is really very good!

Environment: The hotel is located in Jing'an District, which is convenient for travel. It is also relatively quiet. There is a small parking lot next to the hotel, but the fee is relatively expensive, 60RMB during the day, and 90RMB from night to noon the next day. There is another parking lot a little further away, and the fee is cheaper. In short, if you don't travel with children, public transportation is more convenient.

Service: Satisfied, there are free lotions and masks on the washbasin in the room, and a small gift of essential oil fragrance was given before leaving.

Overall, I am quite satisfied and will come again next time.

The service was very good. Recommend the croissant and salted duck egg yogurt cup, afternoon tea is okay. The problems mentioned in the reviews do exist. The sound insulation can be said to be very poor. (No wonder ear plugs are provided proactively.) If you have sleep problems like me, I suggest you ask for a two-story room, farther away from the road. Hygiene issues should indeed be improved. At this price, hygiene should not be like this.

msg:Staying at Jingge Hotel was an unexpected surprise. It was recommended by Ctrip when booking the hotel. The front desk of the hotel was very friendly, check-in was smooth and they upgraded my room type for free. The room is square and square, and the space is used very well. Although the overall room area is not large, the lack of obstructions and the compression of the bathroom and washing area make the whole room very spacious and bright. Although the windows are not large, the sliding doors cover up this shortcoming very cleverly. The entire room is full of details and full of design. The whole room is very smart and the bed is very comfortable. Hotel supplies are very environmentally friendly.

On the first floor, there are not only some essential oil products and special jewelry displays, but also a small yoga room and Zen room, which can also be used as a small conference room. There is a garden landscape, making it a small world suitable for meditation in the city.

msg:There is a very strong aromatic smell as soon as you enter the hotel. It has a milky woody smell, not pungent, but whether you like it or not is a matter of personal preference. The corridor is harmonious, simple and beautiful. Only when I opened the door to the first room, the smell of smoke hit my face (it was obviously a non-smoking room). Then moved to the second room. It's fine if you don't move, but if you move around or move things, or adjust the air conditioner, even boiling water in the bathroom will create a wave of smoke smell.
There may be harm in comparison. I moved here from the hotel where I worked for a weekend, so I felt that the bed, mattress, pillows and quilt were all very comfortable (but there was still a faint smell of cigarette smoke). I especially like the texture of the yukata, it's very soft and only the waistband is very short. My BMI weight is very standard (20), but the belt is not big enough for me to wear a bow tie. At one point, I suspected that it was because I had gained weight that the belt was really short.
The souvenir given by the hotel is essential oil aromatherapy. You can ask the front desk in advance to put it in the check-in cabin (although it is less than 100ml, but it is better to be careful)
The welcome drink prepared by the bar is very good. You can take it back to your room and enjoy it slowly.

When checking in, the front desk was very considerate and upgraded the suite. Lip balm and perfume were also given when checking out. The most satisfying thing is the breakfast. The staple food is divided into Chinese, Japanese and Western styles. There are also many buffets, fruit drinks and snacks.

Ctrip Black Diamond lives in hotels for most of the year, and has a high tolerance for hotels. As soon as I checked into this hotel and found out it was owned by the Jinjiang Group, I knew something was going to happen. The results also confirmed that it was most likely a tool for money laundering.
Room: fast and standard, the design is messy, the door leaks a big gap, this is the first time to stay in this kind of luxury hotel listed on Ctrip. The area is very small for a fast hotel level.
Breakfast: The specially added breakfast, hey, it’s hard to describe in a word, except for a bottle of Yoplait and coffee, it has nothing good.
I don’t know why, but the room next door keeps coming out to open and close the door early in the morning. I called the front desk, but nothing was solved. I don’t know why. I asked the waiter in the morning and the waiter said he might be drunk and didn't know the reason. There is a big gap in the room door, let alone sound insulation, there is no sound insulation at all.

msg:I have stayed at the Xingge Hotel in Guangzhou before and the experience was great!
Thinking about coming to Shanghai this time, I chose this hotel without hesitation.
⚠️But I will be a little disappointed. First of all, when I checked in, a boy at the front desk told me that the room had not been cleaned yet. Since I personally wanted to change clothes, I agreed that we would send our luggage up first. When we got there, an aunt upstairs told us that it had been cleaned. We had 2 rooms, but the aunt told us that we could change to a cleaned room and the room types were the same. Let me talk about the service attitude at the front desk: I have stayed in too many hotels, large and small, both cheap and expensive. I chose it because it was comfortable to live in your home in Guangzhou. As a result, there is no service with a smile at all. After all, it was not the thousands that I booked before. I'm just asking for one night's stay in the hotel. How many bottles of water are provided in the room every day? Your face was so pissed that it was on the ground, tell me you don’t have enough, so I can ask for it (mainly because this tone is really intoxicating) Please, no matter how noble you are, you are still a service worker. I respect you, and you must also respect your guests! It's not a big deal, but the experience is really bad.

msg:The room was originally booked as a room without a bathtub, but later the price was increased to a room with a bathtub. The room is spacious and has double-layer soundproof glass, which solves the problem of poor soundproofing facing the street.
The bathroom is equipped with bathrobes and a large bathtub. Bath balls are also provided at the counter. This is a plus. However, it is not as mentioned online that you can choose your own bath supplies. Maybe it is a periodic activity.
It was the day before New Year's Eve when I checked in, so I went downstairs to take part in the course, but was told that there was no singing bowl course that day, which was quite disappointing.
The bar on the first floor that I wanted to go to was also unavailable because the venue was lent out for blind date events. The biggest selling points were discounted, and I felt that I was only enjoying 50% of the facilities.
I chose the Japanese main course for the legendary semi-buffet breakfast, and was a little disappointed. The format was more important than the deliciousness. In the end, I ate some casually, so I decided to go out for brunch at the Italian restaurant next door, otherwise the breakfast would be empty.
Check-out time is 1:30 pm, and we thoughtfully prepared souvenirs to make up for some regrets.
Overall, the living environment is very good. Unfortunately, I didn't choose the right time to stay, and I didn't enjoy the key facilities. It's a pity.

The shower head in the bathroom was dirty and there was other people's hair on the conditioner, you can see the pictures.
The room is very small, and the quilt cover can still expose the core of the quilt. But the pillows are comfortable.
The service was very unprofessional. The price of 700 was comparable to that of InterContinental, but there was no breakfast. The front desk did not remind me and asked me to go directly to the restaurant.
Very bad experience, will not stay here again.
In addition, I looked at the ratings in detail. Five diamonds and five stars on Ctrip are completely different standards. Five diamonds are "self-proclaimed" and have no gold content.

The cleaning lady is even better. All kinds of thoughtful service and care make me feel like I live in a fairy hotel. Thank you for her.
The little brother who caters and the uncle who delivers the food are also warm and polite. Communicate well when encountering problems.
The teacher of the singing bowl is also very gentle, and it was the first time I experienced the healing of the singing bowl. Thank you for their service! Like the service of the hotel.

The dinner provided by the package tastes good. I ate beef rice and Thai seafood rice, and there is also a floating afternoon tea. It is not an ordinary dessert, but salmon and sea cucumber. Oh, unexpectedly.
What is not satisfactory is that there are only two types of essential oils and bath sets to choose from. There are also singing bowls. When you check in, you must make an appoin**ent one day in advance. Doesn't that mean they are not allowed to use it? !

The design of this hotel is excellent, and the feeling that the designer wants to express can basically be realized. It just feels like the decoration budget is insufficient, and some details have not been handled well. But this does not affect the check-in experience!
The afternoon tea meal presented by the hotel is also quite surprising. It is not surprising that salmon fillets are used for afternoon tea, but it is the first time I have seen sea cucumbers! Plus two special cocktails, really good!
There are many small bars around the hotel, all of which are very convenient. It takes only 10 minutes to walk to Jiuguang Depar**ent Store.

4The design is also quite speechless, a bit unfashionable and foreign, but this differs from person to person. Some people may like this style.
💰The house price was upgraded from more than 600 to more than 900. I think the overall quality is suitable for less than 500. The price is low and the service is not up to par. There is no one to help with luggage at the door.

On the last day, the hotel also held an event with the theme of earth food. The western restaurant was requisitioned. Breakfast can only be arranged in the room, and there is only one stool in the room. The dining experience is really not good.
It can be seen that the hotel operators have put a lot of thought into it, and there are many activities and supporting arrangements. For example, you can choose a set of toiletries every night from Galeries Lafayette, Jo Malone, New Zealand antipodes, etc., which is really attractive. It's a pity that more arrangements require more professional services. This is a bit of a lack of the hotel. The impact of hotel activities on guests is not announced in advance, and the content of the package is not explained in detail. It is even stated on the package that breakfast, lunch and dinner can be served Any one of the services can not be honored (I was told that lunch and dinner can no longer be selected at the scene). . .
Although there are some flaws in the oin**ent, the hotel's location and operational thoughtfulness are worthy of recognition. Today, because the event affected the residents' dining, the hotel also specially sent two baskets of blueberries to the room. The blueberries are sweet and big. Give it a big thumbs up!

I have already recommended friends to come and experience it. The location of the hotel is very good, and it is very convenient to go to the surrounding tourist attractions. I will book it again next time I have a chance

msg:Bad review! Bad review! The soundproofing measures are extremely bad. It can be said that there is no basic privacy soundproofing. I fell asleep at 10pm and was woken up by the sound of the door opening and closing next door. I opened and closed the door dozens of times for two hours. There were also indescribable sounds upstairs. Everyone has the right to decide what they can come in and do, so the hotel's sound insulation measures are not in place.
The hotel doesn't even know what kind of guests are staying there. Very low quality and not considerate of others at all. After dark, they frequently come in and out, opening and closing doors, which makes a lot of noise. I originally thought that people coming in and out would be over after a while, so I called the front desk at 12 o'clock. I didn't know how to deal with it, and the door was not opened or closed until 2 o'clock. If you are staying in a hotel for business near Jing'an, avoid this hotel because the probability of you encountering something like me is very high. When you are on a business trip and need to get some extra sleep, this hotel cannot at least allow you to sleep quietly.

But please note that this is "five diamonds" and not five stars.
Maybe I have a different definition of clean and tidy. I just want to say that it is really unclean. The room I stayed in, 606, smelled so bad that I couldn't breathe.

First of all, the location is more convenient near Jing'an Temple. There are many small shops along the way from Jing'an Temple subway station, which is suitable for shopping under the plane tree
The hotel facilities are also OK, the sheets and pillows are very comfortable
There is nothing to say about the service, it was upgraded to a suite, so the meditation sound therapy turned into a private lesson, and the teacher came to the room to teach; it was really relaxing for an hour and a half
I happened to have a very important meeting early in the morning on the first day. The meditation the night before allowed me to relax deeply, and the meeting the next day was in excellent condition
In short, it is a place worth living in. If you don’t live, it is also worth experiencing the sound therapy course

The room is large and the space design is reasonable. The bathroom is open, bright and clean, where you can take a bath and relax.

The bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry, and the toilet is made of Japanese brands, with functions of Japanese bathroom heating and cleaning.

The mirror is bright! You can take pictures after shopping next to it.

The bed is oversized and soft to sleep on. There are Bluetooth speakers and bed chairs beside the bed.

There is also a special drink and breakfast as a gift. The breakfast is useless, and the service staff in the restaurant have a very good attitude~

Finally tried the singing bowl! The magical experience and the sound of simulating nature are really half-dream and half-awake, losing consciousness.

The attitude and service consciousness of the service staff are very good~

Let me talk about the advantages first: good location, moderate price, complete bathtub facilities, good sound insulation, and ceremonial catering services.
Let's talk about the shortcomings: 1. The shower adjus**ent in the bathroom is very unintelligent and humane. It is difficult to adjust the water temperature, and the water pressure fluctuates. 2. The taste of the set food is okay, but the hot spring egg, I ate the egg shell... This is very careless 3. Maybe it was because I was busy when I checked out. The sister at the front desk said that it would be fine to put the room card at the front desk. When it comes to refunding the deposit and sending check-out gifts (there is one in the package, of course I didn’t give it in the end), although it’s not important, it feels more perfunctory.

Overall, it is a relatively reserved trip, I hope the hotel can do better in details!

msg:Environment: First of all, the environment is very comfortable. Many local friends said that they passed by and thought it was a meditation healing spa or yoga studio.
Service: I have to say that it is very NICE and thoughtful. The porter helped me deliver my luggage in order to catch the plane. I was so moved that I was about to cry. The service in Shanghai has become so good
Facilities: It’s a boutique hotel, so the quality of the furniture is different, but it does have a unique style; what makes me most curious is that their meditation session can’t be arranged this time, I hope there will be a chance next time; the location is also very central in Jing’an District You can check in at the two most IN CAFEs within walking distance.
Free hand companion: when I leave, I will give hand cream with essential oils, which is really practical for me in the north
Oh, and because it is an old house renovation, if you mind and have a light sleeper, you should communicate with the hotel in advance and try to arrange a room not facing the street.

I feel that no matter from the lobby, restaurant, or rooms, this is obviously a boutique hotel, not at the level of a five-star hotel.

If this was a three- or four-diamond boutique hotel, I think it would meet the standards.

However, the five-diamond standard given by Ctrip is a bit misleading. When I booked the room, I only chose five-diamond. Unexpectedly, when I arrived, I found out that it was a boutique hotel style.

msg:The operation can be said to be substandard. I spent more money to book a package, but there was no guidance when I checked in. I had to ask questions, and no souvenirs were given. I only replenished a few small bottles of shower gel and other essential oils and personal care products after leaving the store. No one was there during the whole dressing experience. I mentioned that singing bowls need to be reserved one day in advance, fixed at 8 o'clock every day. This is not a business hotel. How many people will go back to the hotel at 8 o'clock to do this? The breakfast was a disaster, not to mention whether it was delicious or not. The set meal box was all pre-made snacks, the fried dough sticks were cold, and there were several grids each with bean curd, pickles, and everything else. There were not many that were serious enough to eat, and the noodles and wontons were not stewed well. eat. Other than that there was very little food. The bathing area is not separated from dry and wet areas, and the water temperature is very strange, sometimes hot and cold. The bathroom in the room is larger than the bedroom. The window faces a large white wall. The distance between floors is very small, making the room depressing. The bedding is average and the furniture used is average. The introduction says it is a holy place for gin fans. This is an important reason for booking this hotel. I am a gin fan. I tried it. It was ridiculous. The basic skills were not up to standard. Sir Henry's base gin and tonic was an ordinary small one. Ice cubes, wine, tonic water, and yellow lemon peels were not even stirred, let alone the normal use of ice and cucumbers. The basic skills were not up to par. There were few people at the front desk at night. Yes, the attitude was enthusiastic, but it was of no use and the whole experience was very poor. Under the Jinjiang Group, you can book a non-basic room type with a traditional international high-star hotel for 1,200 per night. With such operational capabilities, there is no swimming pool, no gym, no laundry room, and even a coat rack and no laundry price list. The service staff were warm and polite, but they could hardly be called professional. The beef rice for dinner was pretty good, and the wireless speakers in the room were nice. To sum up, the form is greater than the content, which is extremely disappointing.

Hot tea is also provided. The room is very new, with Bluetooth speakers and air purifiers. Embedded TV, etc., wet and dry toilets and bathrooms are separated, and there are reading lights, which are very user-friendly, a plus point! The sound insulation is not bad, especially the pillows, which are very comfortable.
It is also located on Jiaozhou Road, the center of Jing'an District in Shanghai, and the surrounding restaurants 1 and shopping centers are all within walking distance, including the surrounding Internet celebrity street Yuyuan Road (about 900 meters on foot)
It is 900 meters away from Jingpin Shopping Center, Jingan Kerry Center and Ruiou Depar**ent Store. There are mostly western restaurants next to it. There are many Italian, French and bistros. It is suitable for friends who come to Shanghai to experience the a**osphere check in.

The biggest problem is the air conditioner. It does not use the automatic air volume mode. It does not blow left and right winds. It blows directly to the bedside. My baby and I blew it for three days and asked the hotel to solve it. The hotel said there was nothing that could be done. The room was stuffy and the air conditioner was not turned on. no

msg:1 point to persuade to quit! What a waste!
The hotel was renovated from an old dilapidated house. The photos looked interesting, but upon checking in, I found that the details were worrying. The decoration materials were very cheap, and the paint and dust on the walls were seriously peeled off.
What was shocking was that there was no separation between wet and dry, and the bath water could spread on the flat floor into the bedroom. The disposable slippers on the floor were soaked with water and felt a bit disgusting.
There is a main road outside, and cars pass by at night. If you are a light sleeper, please leave immediately and say no.
There are a bunch of fancy packages on Ctrip that make no sense.

This package comes with a floating basket, which is popular now haha, and two bottles of white wine. Anyway, the sense of ceremony is quite sufficient. The snacks in the floating basket are not bad. The salted fish in the snack is too salty and difficult to eat. It might be better to replace it.
The breakfast is one of three sets of Chinese, Japanese and Western options. Generally speaking, it is not bad. There are many restaurants around, including some Internet celebrity restaurants. There is COA next door, and it is also very convenient to walk to Jing'an Temple.
I think if you come to a nearby bar to explore the store one day, it will be very convenient to stay here.

msg:The most popular place to stay in Jing’an is Grand Swiss Hotel. I wanted to change to another hotel, so I saw that it’s not far away and the price is not much different. But frankly speaking, I was very disappointed when I opened the door. My first reaction was I regret booking here, it is definitely not a second booking experience.
Facilities: The room is much smaller than expected, and even two people feel cramped in it. There is an air purifier and a capsule coffee machine in the room.
Hygiene: It's fairly clean and tidy, with no special feeling.
Environment: There are many specialty bars and coffee shops around
Location: Just beside the Jiaozhou Road, Line 10, Line 2, Line 14, and Line 14 are not close to each other, and it is not convenient to travel by public transportation.
Service: The processing speed at the front desk is relatively slow, and there is no greeting. When getting on the elevator, a car pushing towels stops half of the elevator entrance and no one cares. When I left, I also heard some suggestions from other guests that the room was small, the parking was inconvenient, and they felt bad.
On the whole: this price➕100, you can stay at the Hongan Swiss Hotel diagonally opposite to Ruiou next door to Jingpin, just outside the subway exit, the transportation is very convenient, the room and bathroom are twice as large as this one, and the service and efficiency are also high It's very high, and the price/performance ratio is not one or two points higher.

msg:I rarely rate hotels, almost none.
But I really want to say something about this hotel.
First of all, because I stayed at Atour in Nanjing, I wanted to change my hotel experience. I chose several Shanghai hotels and chose this one among several hotels. In the end, I realized that it would be better to choose Atour.
Because there were photos of meditation and gong bathing sound bowls in the store, I thought this was a hotel with a "realm". I didn't experience the package package because I was very dissatisfied with the hotel.
Unsatisfactory service:
1. Checked in on the 26th. That night, the guy at the front desk had a very bad attitude. He was lazy and tired. He didn't feel like "checking in" at all, even though he so-called upgraded the room for me (I blindly guessed it was because I brought my room). small children), for me personally, there is no sense of upgrade. When I arrived, I hadn’t eaten yet, so I asked him about breakfast and dinner in the restaurant. His reply was that individual customers can only eat Japanese meals. They all cater more for group meals and we are the individual travelers. They didn't tell me that I could make a reservation or what I could eat. Almost the best thing I have seen in other hotels is the front desk. The service will make you feel really relaxed after a long day of fatigue. I wanted to change hotels from then on, but I resisted, thinking maybe the room would be nice.

2. The hotel does not deliver takeaways, and all takeaways are placed in the lobby. If you are a very "realm" hotel with good service and good facilities, I can also go up and down, but because the service facilities are not good, this will only Lower your favorability and make you even more dissatisfied.
The hotel can ask security to deliver its own meals, but there are no robots or staff to deliver takeaways, and their front desk is almost lazy or tired. Then please let us "individual travelers" who are not allowed to reserve meals, can only order takeout or run away by ourselves.

Dissatisfaction with facilities:
The hotel focuses on Japanese style and will be opened in 2020. It is smart. I thought it would suit young people,
1. First of all, the air conditioner cannot be adjusted. It is a central air conditioner. That is to say, if you are afraid of cold or heat, you cannot adjust it according to your temperature. In 2023, there will still be hotels that cannot adjust the temperature. I thought the one I was staying in was What a third-tier suburban hotel.
2. Hair dryer, I probably have the heavy, hot and loud one used in reception rooms when I was in college.
3. There are very few bedside plugs, and none of them are empty. If you want to plug in a charger, you need to remove the phone plug or purifier or stereo.

Dissatisfaction with the environment:
It was very noisy outside the room, next to the street, and the sound of trash being taken out in the morning and evening was very noisy. I don't blame the hotel for this.
However, the room (our two rooms) toilets and sewers all smelled bad. Even though the cleaning lady took care of it one day, there was still a smell in the shower the next day.

I saw a very profound negative review. He said that the hotel spent all the renovation costs on the first floor.
Indeed, I will not come again anyway, and this experience will be added to my public account article. I will not experience it again, and it will protect people around me from lightning.

I originally longed for Yinbo, after all, I liked it very much, but in the end, this hotel was not only disappointing, but also disappointing.
If this hotel is just opened with the idea of ​​calming down city dwellers, it would be better to reflect on the idea.

msg:It was the first time I stayed in a hotel when I grew up, and I felt cheated. They probably only used it to review good reviews, and none of the hardware and software were distracted. At that time, the price of the reservation was not cheap, so it should not be too bad. Ctrip showed the luxury type, but I was still too naive, and the society suffered too few beatings. What does it feel like to spend a four-star and five-star price staying in a fast hotel? The peeling door frame, the wall that is simply scratched and stained, the doors and locks thin, the mottled furniture, the texture is too low and the texture is unsatisfactory linen, It doesn't match the so-called Japanese style at all, like a chair recovered from a Cantonese-style tea house. The shower partition only has a glass glue on the ground to make it waterproof. Probably not afraid of water seepage. Anyway, the whole house is covered with floor tiles, yes, no The wooden floor is not a carpet, it is a hard floor tile throughout the house! Japanese-style false doors, wardrobe doors, TV cabinet doors, all the doors are swaying, 90 pounds, I am afraid that the door will be damaged by too much force. Who doesn't want to say a decoration genius after reading it? Which black-hearted developer does not want to have such a decoration team, and it can fool things too much. Maybe when I make a reservation, I find that the order cannot be cancelled after more than half an hour, so I should be more vigilant, because after more than half an hour, I can find that I have been deceived by the photo. Maybe I should have noticed it when I got out of the car and saw the standard low-rise and small door of the Express Hotel. Maybe there is no professional doorman at the door, only a security uncle sitting at the door should wake up. Maybe seeing the shabby front desk at check-in is time to recognize the reality. But it was too late. As mentioned earlier, the online order will not be refunded for more than half an hour. The price of more than 700 has hundreds of choices in Shanghai, and I chose the wrong one. All I can say is, I wish them a prosperous business, and deceive one is one, after all, 300 can't be more for this level of facilities.

The younger son has never had the opportunity to play with him. This time, I want to take my younger son to revisit it. This hotel from the environment, to the a**osphere, makes me feel very Japanese. Plus hotel guests can enjoy one hour of free 👘dressing experience. Let me get over the addiction again. The steak set in the evening was very generous. The restaurant guy who was on duty on February 5th had a good appearance and a good service attitude. I wanted to order 10 yuan of rice, and he offered it. Salads, drinks, and more were given to the children. The three of us were very satisfied. Check out the next day, the front desk also presented two small pieces of aromatherapy spray and a piece of sea salt toffee.
In short, I don't understand the 1 to 3 points for online reviews, why? In fact, this boutique hotel under the Jin Jiang Group is generally very satisfactory to me, and I give it 4.5 stars. Have recommended other friends to stay, in short, very good.

It only takes 30 minutes to take the subway to Line 2 to Hongqiao Airport / Railway Station, which is very convenient. Because it is in the Jing'an Temple business district, there are all kinds of food, snacks, and bistros. There is also an Italian restaurant on the corner downstairs, which is a good choice for brunch with friends or a drink in the evening. The environment of the hotel, the hygiene of the room is not to be said, it is very clean, and there is a faint fragrance, which is very comfortable. Because I need to do nucleic acid tests when I leave Shanghai, the lady at the front desk patiently answered my questions one by one. The hospitals around me that can do nucleic acid tests are also within a 10-minute walk. Before leaving, the hotel staff also gave them their homemade handmade toffee and aromatherapy oil, which is really very considerate! I will definitely visit this hotel next time I come to Shanghai!

1. The location is very advantageous. Most of the leaves at the door have fallen during Chris**as, but the whole road is still very charming. It is walking distance from the subway station and there are many brunch shops at the door.
2. The service staff are enthusiastic and positive, and will take the initiative to say hello when they see them.
3. The selection of bedding is very good, including coffee machine, garment steamer and cosmetic mirror.
Disadvantages: The corridor is not very soundproof, you can hear the door closing and people passing by in the corridor.
Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio for over 400 during the Chris**as period is simply too good. Highly recommended.

Ordered takeaways cannot be delivered to the room, so go downstairs to pick them up. The cause of the epidemic is understandable.
The five-star praise for the hotel is to encourage it. The hardware facilities have not yet reached, but the service can add points. At this stage, the market is fiercely competitive, and it is not easy. Please be more tolerant.

🚗 Transportation: The location is very good, a 5-minute walk from Jing'an Temple. It belongs to the core location of old Shanghai, quiet in the middle of noisy, very Shanghai, just a few steps out of the house, there are various delicious and fun restaurants, bars, and cafes. In the shadow of the plane tree, integrated into the city

🍃Environment: Partially Japanese style, simple and fashionable. The hotel’s own cafe, restaurant, and bar is located on the first floor. The open window position is very suitable for staring at the street scene or capturing passersby. There is also a space that integrates meetings and yoga. In the morning, I ran to do some stretching. It is a small luxury to create such a space for guests in such a good location. The room has a sense of scale and is not depressing. The quality of smart toilets, capsule coffee, and toiletries are all highlights.

🔔Service: Special thanks to the young lady at the front desk, Cui Cui, for her attentive service. She helped to arrange room changes, find yoga mats, and send back the leftover items immediately. Think what guests think. Make this trip to Shanghai very warm.

I feel that there are still a lot of things to experience, such as breakfast. There is also Alimentari & Degusteria (Jiaozhou Road Store), the "Must Eat List in Shanghai" Internet celebrity dining room next to it. KYO, a small cafe next to it, tastes super positive. I will stay here next time I come to Shanghai.

Hidden in the alley behind the hotel is the 98 Creative Park, a new Internet celebrity.

The washbasin is even more exotic, except for the face wash function, there is no space on the countertop to put cosmetics. A large blank space in the middle is left undesigned and unreadable.

The bedding in the room is very clean, especially to praise the sound insulation of the windows. The brunch next to it is delicious, recommended

Finally, I want to mention it. Thank you very much to the little brother at the front desk. Haha. I didn’t see him in the last check out. Although the weather in Shanghai was a bit rainy and not very good for the two days, it still gave me a very comfortable feeling🉑️🉑️🉑️

Looking at the pictures on Ctrip, the hotel’s door face is not big, and I am a little nervous after booking, but when I arrive at the hotel, I have a unique sense of thought, design, and cutting-edge feel. The hotel’s service is especially comfortable, considerate and thoughtful, and cocktails are also presented. Tasting, chatting with friends in front of the window and drinking a glass of wine, the cool night in early autumn is very intoxicating! When communicating with the hotel manager Cui Cui, I hope to temporarily store some of our work for a few days, get Cui Cui’s great help, coordinate communication between the top and bottom, and help carry it inside and outside, so that we can get a lot of warmth in Shanghai after the rain. Thank you for the wonderful and innovative design of the hotel experience. At the same time, I am more grateful for the hotel’s service and the guests are at home, thank you Cui Cui🌸

The public area is also very Japanese-style landscaping. It is a good place to change and relax when you can't leave the country.

After calculation, it seems that there are about 5 doors. The quality of the door is very poor and it accidentally became crooked. The breakfast is in a 9-square grid, one for each person. The food is too bad. , if you stay at a Marriott or something like this at this price, you can always have more freedom in food, and the accommodation fee is a waste.

There is no washbasin but only one washbasin, and the air flow inside the room is not smooth, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, it has prepared many small technological items in the room, such as a portable clothes ironing machine, but the funny thing is that there are not many places to hang clothes in the room, and it will take some time to find a suitable place to hang clothes. However, the service staff of this hotel are very good, and the initiative to solve the problem is very good.

The hotel is very generous and upgraded the room type (it feels that it will be easy for customers to become dependent). The area left for the bedroom function is actually not large. A lot of space is given to the bathroom including an entire long bathtub, so that even if it is late at night when I return to the room, I feel that not taking a bath seems to waste the goodwill of the store.

The bedding was very comfortable, it seemed to be downy, and the room was 19° air conditioned and would not be cold.
Unfortunately only stayed one night and will stay here again next time we visit.

msg:The sound insulation is very poor. The sound insulation of the room that was arranged was so poor that the embarrassing voice of the next room was clear. The aunt who cleaned before 7 in the morning started to use the vacuum cleaner and kept talking loudly. I changed the room the next day, but I couldn't hear the sound of the next room, but the voice of the cleaning aunt was everywhere~ I really couldn't rest quietly. I felt that the decoration materials were very thin, and the doors were very light and everywhere. It is seamed, not soundproof at all~ The breakfast is not rich but the service is good. After staying for three days, the dishes have hardly been changed. The only thing is that the green vegetables have been replaced by broccoli and rape, and nothing else has changed. I thought it was selected close to the company. , But the business trip is hard enough, and I won't book again after I haven't had a good rest.

msg:The very exquisite Japanese-style hotels in downtown Shanghai are for convenient transportation and clean environment.

The room is not big, but neat and clean, the sink is a very strange setting, anyway, I can treat it as invisible.

The lobby and restaurant of the hotel have a Japanese taste, especially the breakfast, which offers different choices of Chinese, Japanese and Western styles, but the portion is so large, I can't eat a big bowl of rice early in the morning. It's a bit wasteful!

The waiters are also very enthusiastic. I called when I was in the taxi and asked if my flight was delayed due to heavy rain. At least there is no such greeting in other hotels. It makes people feel that the city of Shanghai is exquisite.

In addition, there are many places around the hotel where you can check in one by one. I want to stay here next time. It is a quiet place in the middle of nowhere.

The steak set meal was very rough, with only one piece of meat, no side dishes, no salad or bread, so I had no choice but to go out to buy something to eat. The breakfast is also very average, cooked casually, and the dishes are cold. The ingredients are still not fresh. My husband has diarrhea after dinner, and I have diarrhea after breakfast.

But the room I was given was average. The outer window faced other buildings and was very close to each other. The sink was in the middle of the room. The layout was a bit strange. The lighting was high and dim. There was no sink and makeup mirror, so it was very inconvenient to put on makeup.
In addition, the soundproofing of the room is average.
All in all, compared to the price of 550+, it’s a little bit worth it.

給讚的地方是給了我們延遲退房到3點，不用拿着行李到處走👍

但是！有個缺點是在太明顯了，實在要説兩句：隔音和遮光很糟糕，我和同住人一個是對聲音敏感，一個是對光敏感，可以説是很難睡好，沒有體驗到宣傳裏鬧中取靜的感覺。
遮光 - 沒有常規的遮光窗簾，導致7點就醒了
隔音 - 房間靠馬路，不是隔音玻璃導致晚上一直能聽到車聲。
雖然房間裏貼心配備耳塞，但還是有點吵。以及建議可以也配上眼罩……

msg:這次是我住的最最最滿意的一家酒店
1. 地理位置：這不用多説，樓下就有網紅餐廳Alimentari，還有超多pub bar，嗨完回酒店睡覺超方便

2. 酒店設計：雖然我定的房型面積較小，但空間設計合理，不會覺得逼仄。本大衹星人呆得也很舒服

3. 床墊和枕頭：我要大誇特誇！！終於找到一家酒店，枕頭不是空空的也不是超級硬，而是有支撐性且枕套很舒服的！！床墊也是！不再是早上起來感覺腰背痠痛的那種軟床墊！！好睡到尖叫！

4. 不太好的：洗手枱鏡子那邊的收納空間太小，女生化粧發放東西不方便。不過瑕不掩瑜。

酒店工作人員很nice。

唯一吐槽，不能免費停車，作為這個價格的酒店沒有自己的停車場説不過去。另外贈送的下午茶和餐食挺一般的。

總之，因為有了超值的頌缽體驗課，我覺得下次還會考慮去住一下，哈哈哈哈。

第一晚住的無覺閣，好像，我覺得有點小，因為帶孩子，實在是有些不太方便，第二晚換了一間大的房型，非常滿意！如果一個人出差或者兩人住都是沒問題的。家庭住還是需要大一點的房型會住着更舒服。
服務也非常好，環境也幽靜，很喜歡！還會住！

msg:一次極其驚艷的週末酒店之旅！！週末要去靜安寺還願加許願，想着正好玩玩浦西吧，就定了這家酒店。前台很貼心的給我們房型升級成了大一號的套房。進門第一眼就被驚艷到了！厚重有質感的法式公寓款木門，簡約素雅的屋內裝修（床和沙發的色調超級喜歡），柔和温柔的燈光，還有窗外梧桐樹葉落下斑駁的光影，下起淅淅瀝瀝的小雨…覺得心一下子就安靜舒緩下來了。。在周圍隨便壓壓馬路，街邊隨便找個小店喝個咖啡，買個甜品，吃個港式茶餐廳，品質都槓槓的！！下午情不自禁靠在窗邊的長沙發上讀幾頁書，媽呀自己竟然不知不覺成了文青…果然浦西才有生活。無比美好的週末！！
