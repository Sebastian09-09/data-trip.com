msg:This is a good hotel with an amazing location.

The services are unlike any hyatt I've even been at. I wonder if it's a fake hyatt. The staff are not really nice and they don't have any restaurants or places to eat take out together.

We were a group of friends that were all staying at the hotel. At some point we wanted to eat dinner but they didn't have a restaurant. We asked if we could order take out and eat at one of their tables and they quoted us a crazy amount to sit at one of their empty tables. 

They literally have a whole empty dining area that no one can sit in. It's crazy because the alternative was for us to take our take out to one of the rooms. So at the end of the day the staff would rather clean up pizza stains off the rug in the bedroom than just give us a place to sit together in their empty dinning room.

The room size is more economical than high-end hotels or those priced at nearly 1,000 yuan, but it is enough for business trips that seek comfort. The toilet and bathroom are small, and the bathrobe and bedding are good. Compared with rooms with average cost performance, the breakfast and service are very good. The service staff in both the restaurant and the front desk are very good and proactive in helping, which is worth a thumbs up👍👍. The free coffee, tea and fruit provided in the public area are also unique.

msg:Tuanjiehu Subway Station is right across from the barbecue restaurant on the first floor, so convenient! It only takes half an hour to reach Zhushikou.
The front desk area is not big, but it still has a designated area with free capsule coffee, tea and fruits, which is very considerate. There are also paid snacks and drinks.
The room is nice and has a sense of design, but the floor height is a bit low, but this is a flaw and I don't insist on it. In addition, the wardrobe is a bit awkward to use, and the door inside is not easy to open. The bed is quite comfortable.
The layout of the breakfast room is a bit strange, but there are many choices. Children like the noodle stalls.
The service especially wanted to name the young man who carried our luggage when we left. I don’t know his name, but because we were on a long-distance flight and had a lot of luggage, the car was not pushed up against the door. There was a short section of uneven stone pavement, and the young man was afraid of bumping the wheels. He helped us carry our luggage to the car, which was really rare! So I must give it a 5 points!
A small suggestion, environmental protection is definitely supported by not providing disposable toiletries, but occasionally guests will need it, so it is best to mention it when checking in. This time I found that I only brought toothpaste without a toothbrush when I brought my daughter, which was embarrassing. , returned to the room very late, and called the guest room again to have it delivered, which was quite embarrassing.

I didn’t know it was owned by the Hyatt Group before. The overall experience is great, and it’s suitable for business trips or tourism. The hotel is within a 3-minute walk to the subway station, and within 10 minutes to Sanlitun. It is also very convenient to the Capital Airport, and is only one or two subway stops away from Sanyuan Bridge. I know where to stay when I go to Beijing in the future. It’s very convenient for people whose activities are mainly in Jintai Xizhao and Guomao 😁

Shoubei Zhaolong only takes a deposit, and if there is no problem checking out, the refund will be received in seconds. And when I came in with my travel cat litter box, rice bowl, and water bowl, I found that the hotel had reserved them in advance~ It was really heartwarming👍 and there were two floors dedicated to pets, so they would not be disturbed to other guests. The location is within the third ring outside the second ring road. It is not too crowded to go to Universal Studios in the morning. It is also very convenient to go to Yonghe Temple the next day. The hotel environment and artistic a**osphere are also very good. Anyway, my wife praised me✧٩(ˊωˋ *)و✧A very happy self-driving trip

It has specially prepared water basins, changing mats, backpacks and small biscuits for the puppies. Is truly pet friendly
After reading the introduction of the hotel's new business philosophy, it is a new type of hotel targeted at young people. Coupled with the excellent location near Taikoo Li Sanlitun, our stay this time was very good. The hotel waiters were polite and responsive, and the service was in place. Next Will choose here again for my next stay

msg:Zhaolong Hotel. It was originally the first five-star hotel built with donations from the Bao family introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s during Beijing's reform and opening up. I stayed there seven or eight years ago. Although the facilities are a bit old. But the style of the old five-star hotel is still there. This trip has been taken over by the First Brigade. When I entered the store, I was surprised. The original five-star hotel has been transformed into a convenience hotel. The lobby is gone too. Check-in procedures are done at the two workstations on the second floor. When I checked in, the filter criteria was to select five stars. After I checked in, I took a closer look and found that it was five diamonds. This is a routine of Ctrip. Stars are stars. If you want diamonds, you should be diamonds. Confuse diamonds with stars. Ctrip really has you.
Because I do it out of trust. It must be a week online. Searched last week, the price is 1,400 yuan per room per day for check-in from September 5 to check-out on September 10 (see Figure 1). I originally thought that a five-star hotel should cost this price, so I booked and paid without hesitation. When I arrived and saw the hotel like this, I felt very disappointed. Checking the hotel price again, it has been reduced to 1,283 yuan/room per day. So I complained to Ctrip. The girl from Ctrip was very nice. She immediately helped me cancel my stay for the next 4 days and then check in for another 4 days (see Figure 4). She also explained to me that the prices for two of the weekends should be more expensive, which I accepted. . When I arrived on Friday, I took another look at the price on Ctrip. The price actually dropped to 1,143 yuan/room per day on the weekend. Oh my gosh, I must have been a little too big. No wonder Ctrip rated me as a Golden Diamond member. What exactly is the problem with Ctrip? Is it because I am a leek?

Whether they are receptionists or room service, they have demonstrated professionalism and enthusiastic service. They always greet guests with a smile and are happy to help with any questions, making me feel truly at home.

Secondly, I was also impressed by the hotel's facilities and services. The room was spacious and comfortable, beautifully decorated and fully equipped, especially the bedding, which allowed me to get enough rest every night. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. There are many attractions and shopping malls nearby, and the transportation is convenient, allowing me to explore the city easily.

Highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit this city.

This location is really convenient
It is also very convenient if you fly to Capital Airport
Check in and check out are fast
The style of the hotel is relatively simple and artistic
Room audio loewe Nescafe capsule coffee moisturizing products acca
Personally like the smell, the shampoo is not greasy and not drying
 Hotel 7-23's well-equipped gym
The usb plug in the room is directly plugged into the charging cable, which is very fast
Travel is very convenient hotel
The above are all my favorite places these days
In fact, unless you often stay in the room, the view room is of little significance
Of course, if you live in a high-rise, you must have a wide view.
TV S brand is very annoying for iOS mobile phone users, unable to cast the screen and watch mainstream videos
Also, the restroom next to the gym is locked. It’s troublesome to walk back to the lobby if you can’t use it.

You need to take the middle elevator to transfer, and the wait is long during peak hours. It is said that the restaurant on the first floor will be moved back after the renovation was completed in early April. Everything else was fine. One night, when the room card couldn't be swiped, a staff member happened to be on the same floor after get off work, and properly solved the problem for us, with a strong sense of service. The elevator needs to swipe the room card to press it, and the privacy is OK. The LING LONG on the third floor is very good, it is recommended to come to eat. I saw two floors of pets on the elevator, but I didn't see it during my stay.

msg:To be honest, I really don't deserve this five-star title and price. The May Day price increase will increase the price. I admit it, but you are more or less worthy of this level of hotel. Booked two rooms for two nights, and arrived after 8:00 p.m. on the day of check-in. First of all, the parking space was not clearly marked when booking. There was no hotel parking management personnel at the scene. There was only one property management staff with extremely low quality and attitude. There are three or four parking spaces on the ground, and a five-star hotel in a prime location. I can only laugh... After all, I only allow ten minutes to check in! Is this five star service? When you reach the first floor, there are no hotel service staff or signs to guide you. You need to go to the front desk on the second floor to handle it yourself! The environment is noisy and chaotic. When I went to the front desk, the registration staff had no professionalism and the expected service attitude. I asked about the parking problem, and told me impatiently: This is how we are, and we didn’t say that there are parking spaces! Is this the right attitude to solve the problem? There is no way but to solve it by yourself. After checking in, the structure of the room, the service and the overall environment can only be described as speechless, so make up your own mind! In short, it's not as good as an ordinary budget hotel as a whole! Will never stay again! It is recommended that everyone be cautious! careful!

msg:Very poor experience, outrageous, not a bit like a professional hotel. The hall is on the second floor, the weather is 30 degrees, and the air conditioner is not cooling. The reason is that Beijing provides unified cooling, but the specific cooling time is unknown, so wait. Fast and fast decoration quality, wearing the cloak of a design hotel, to deceive people who don't stay in the hotel for a long time, there are anti-human designs everywhere, takeaway can only be delivered to the first floor, there is no refrigerator in the room, the TV cannot cast the screen, and the elevator card slot, It hasn't protruded yet. Every time you go to the elevator, you need to bow your waist, hold the card in one hand, and press the elevator button with the other hand, making it look like a big roc spreading its wings. In what age, you need to collect a deposit. You don't even have a refrigerator in your room. The quotation for the continuation of the room does not match the final deduction price. After asking, I was told that the price quoted was tax-free. You should not accept Chinese people at all. Western quotations are used to it? (Finally, the price difference was resolved)
Five-star hotels have a lot of problems, and it's disgusting to come out with the Hyatt brand? Highly not recommended unless the location is required. After staying in the hotel for so many years, the worst bad review is for you. Finally, thank you for the bad experience you brought, and thank the hotel service staff for their helpless apologies over and over again.
In short, for the overall experience, save some face for the above ratings, and I will give zero points in the comments.

You can only hang your coat behind the bathroom door. Now almost all hotels can help guests deliver food to the room. Only this noble hotel still needs to pick it up at the door...

The design of the room is definitely not inferior to that of a designer hotel.

Fortunately, it was upgraded when I checked in, and the view is really good (see picture).
The first floor of the hotel lobby is a mini exhibition hall, and the second floor is the front desk through a wooden rotary staircase.
The service girls and brothers will give you a sense of friendliness at any time. Special thanks to the little brother in the concierge depar**ent who took the initiative to help load the luggage into the trunk of the taxi when you leave the store!

The only thing to complain about is breakfast. Due to the renovation of the original restaurant, the breakfast location has been moved to the 23rd floor. Because there is only one elevator that can go directly, I waited for 17 minutes and couldn't go up. I had no choice but to take the elevator down to the 1st floor and then to the 23rd floor. The breakfast variety is really sorry for the price of 120 yuan. The place is small, there are few types, and there is no hot milk. What was supposed to be a big event for a busy day with a big breakfast will turn out to be filling.

Ctrip looked up and saw this Zhaolong Hotel. I often passed by and never came in. The gate of the hotel said To be honest, it's not easy to find, it's not obvious. Secondly, I contacted the customer service on Ctrip to reserve a parking space. When I got to the front desk of the hotel, I talked to the staff on the second floor and learned that if you are driving here, you need to reserve a parking space several days in advance. 🅿️Personally, it's not very convenient. For example, I made a temporary decision like me. Fortunately, one day I will be rich, otherwise I will spend money to find a parking space in Sanlitun. The rooms in the hotel are clean and the whole is good. The scenery is not beautiful. There is no room with a good view that I forgot to leave a message for this time, but it doesn't matter that the overall facilities are satisfied. The bluetooth speaker at the head of the bed does not understand, it can't be connected, and there is no explanation. I hope the hotel can improve other things. There is nothing more to say if the full score is 10 points, then this experience will be given 8 points!

It takes less than 5 minutes to walk west to the Electromechanical Institute, and then cross the road to Sanlitun, within a 10-minute walk.

The hotel is rich in artistic style and tasteful. The bedside is Loewe's Bluetooth speaker, and my favorite is toiletries. The white moss fragrance is small and low-key, and the fragrance lasts for a long time. I'm going to buy a set.

The gym is not big, but the equipment is very complete, and they are all handsome men and beautiful women.

The Italian restaurant downstairs is good, with outdoor seating and a large lawn in front of it, with a wide and comfortable view.

In general, it is the king of the price/performance ratio of Sanlitun hotels!

The other staff of the hotel are also very caring and have a warm and positive attitude.

The location of the hotel is very good, near Sanlitun, convenient for shopping/travel.

msg:In addition to the location may be better, although the tourist season, Beijing is also the capital, but now the bar street is not open, I don’t know why the boss doesn’t consider whether the price of your home is a bit too high, and it has to catch up with the five-star price. Would you like to ask a question?
Let’s talk about the service first, my friend sent me to the place, there are a lot of parking spaces, the security guard at the door told us that there was no space, and my friend left (I walked back in the middle of the night to see that there were still a lot of parking spaces) Check-in was a man, his attitude was like this He owns the hotel. I speak Mandarin, so I always pretend that I don't understand yes, smile with good intentions, and have a very bad attitude. Talking to him is like playing a piano to a cow, but we have to To be honest, girls are generally pretty good.
Hygiene can be said to be okay, the environment is the feeling of a better express hotel, there is no air conditioning in the elevator, the corridor entering the elevator feels like two worlds, the most important thing is that his house is too strange, and there is no room for toiletries. The front desk takes care of what they want
Consumption is nothing to compliment on. I personally like to travel across the country, and I often stay at Five Stars, but I have never seen a can of Coke that sells for 48 yuan! Few rich people spend so much. No wonder the occupancy rate is not high. Go to Soso and five stars to make more money. Even if it is a little more expensive than your home, it makes sense.

Pulling luggage, I can't feel the sincere service, but I will guide you to the elevator. I have points in Ctrip to upgrade the room type, but I didn't take the initiative to upgrade. After I asked for it, he said to have a look before I upgraded. The air conditioner in the room was wrong , the engineering depar**ent came to test and said that the air outlet is normal, but the temperature is 24 degrees, and the outdoor temperature is 35 or 6 degrees. This temperature will feel very hot in the room, especially when eating. We went out to do errands and it was not cool when we came back, because we were a little tired and too lazy to change. The child was lying on the bed playing with the ipad and his face was red, the bathroom was very small, and there was no refrigerator in the room. I really can't understand what the hotel thinks. Many hotels have never encountered a refrigerator without a refrigerator. I want to drink something cold when I go back to the room in the summer. I have to fill the sink with cold water and soak it in cold water. There are many bad reviews, but there is no way to cancel it. If you take it hard, you will have to deduct the fee, which is too unreasonable. You have to go downstairs outside. There is no robot. The advantage may be the location. The thick duvet doesn't feel like the season changes, in short, it feels a little bit thunderous

The first time I stayed at JDV, I wanted to call to inquire about the parking space. Rory, who answered the call, provided great help and determined the check-in time. Rory helped arrange the spare parts and fruits in advance, and the experience was very good.
The decoration style of the hotel is what I like, simple and clear. The equipment is the Jazz club of margiela across the board, and the taste is also very unique.
Except for self-driving friends who need to ask in advance for parking in the past, the overall a**osphere is great, and it is comfort in the busy city. The recommended index is 4.8 points~

msg:The location and cleanliness of the hotel were really not bad, and I stayed at this hotel for a week quite satisfactorily. But after checking out, the service at this hotel was really indescribable. When I checked in, I had to pay 2,000 won in Chinese money with Wechat Pay as a penalty here, and use about 900 won in Chinese money during my stay to get my money back, about 1,000 won in Chinese money. So when I checked out, the front desk asked how I could get my money back, and the front desk told me not to worry because it would automatically go back to Wechat, so I checked out saying that I would be able to come back. However, even after 3 days, the cancellation fee had not come in, and I called the hotel and asked why they didn't come in, and they said it would be because there was a national holiday. I gave up and hung up again. After that, there was no contact for a few more days, and when I called again and asked, a woman said she was a manager and added a WeChat friend to help, so I contacted her for a month. Of course, I couldn't get my money back for a month, and in a conversation with the manager, the hotel definitely refunded it, and when I said it was my problem, it dragged on for a month, and of course I had to solve it on the hotel side, so I went to the WeChat customer center. I called and went to the bank to ask, and after I looked into everything, the problem was from the beginning on the hotel side. I trusted the hotel and waited for a month, but I went to the hotel in a very disappointed state and met the manager and talked to him, and he said to me, “The money should be refunded to me by the bank, not by the hotel. The hotel has already taken only the money I spent, and the bank has to return the remaining 1,000 won. He contacted me for a month and helped me with things that had nothing to do with the hotel anymore, so why did he come to the hotel?” And after talking for almost 3 hours at the hotel, I was able to get my money of 1000 Chinese Won. I booked this hotel because of the name Hyatt, and I've been to many hotels, but I've never seen this kind of attitude. This is the first time a hotel has said that refunding the cancellation fee has nothing to do with the hotel. I trusted the hotel and paid the cancellation fee. After that, what process the hotel has with the bank has nothing to do with me. I really don't really want to recommend it.

I grabbed the Tanabata package of Zhaolong Hotel two days ago, and I brought the object to experience without saying a word.
Tuanjiehu Metro Station is next to the hotel, it is very convenient to take the subway, and the bustling Sanlitun is a five-minute walk away, the location is particularly good
When checking in, the front desk was very enthusiastic, gave us a small gift, and also helped deliver the luggage to the room
The rooms are large and the facilities are very comprehensive. As described on the website, you can see Taikoo Li Sanlitun through the window. The night scene at night is very artistic😘
The Tanabata dinner in the hotel has a lot more portion than expected, and the taste is very good. The final heart-shaped ice cream makes people shine, very romantic😍
After dinner, I wanted to go to Taikoo Li with the subject first, and asked the waiter to deliver the gift of sparkling wine directly to the room. I thought it was just a small bottle of wine, but I didn’t expect it to be such a big bottle.
I ate the hotel’s buffet breakfast the next morning. Although there were fewer types to choose from, the taste was very good, which suits my appetite.

In summary, this is really a very cost-effective hotel. The room is comfortable, sound insulation is good, the service is good, and the residents are very enthusiastic. Next to it is Taikoo Li, you can go anytime if you want to go shopping. It is a very good value-for-money experience 😝

The next day, I went out and asked the guest room to order a piece of wet tissue paper and said that he could only give 5 masks and 5 masks. The waiter was surprised. It looks like there is no bathtub and foot soaking bucket and no provision is provided. At any rate, it is inevitably too disappointing under Hyatt. The corridor is so narrow that it is too fat to walk in. Regardless of the reason of the room or the corridor, there is a sense of cheapness and convenience. Don't spend this wrong money

msg:I went to Beijing on business many times, because I was going to Sanlitun Taikoo Li to stay at the nearby Zhaolong Hotel for the first time. I really wanted to say a surprise! I am a hotel that prefers artistic temperament to business nature. It is already a Gallery exhibition hall, surrounded by cultural and creative shops and new-style restaurants. The room is small but it feels like a business trip. Staff service is in place. Noon on the second floor downstairs. The quality of brunch is also very good! Definitely stay again next time

No one even feels more comfortable than many five-star high-end hotels. Three miles near the intercontinental chao magnificent I have lived in Bulgari, and I really feel that this hotel is not inferior to these hotels. The style is a bit MUJI, I really like the location and it’s very good. It’s next to harmay and I can shop at any time at night.

As a Hyatt Express hotel, it has the same features as other shortcuts, clean but don’t expect too much service, breakfast, etc....... The location is already very good for this price, the location is really good, and there are many ratings downstairs Very tall restaurant, not to mention shopping in Sanlitun.

msg:A very bad trip. I feel that Zhaolong is no longer the brand it used to be. The first reservation was canceled for no reason. The second reservation was successful. I just wanted to change the name of the guest, but Zhaolong’s switchboard The call came. I made at least 20 calls in two hours, and got through twice. I finally got through. I just mentioned the reservation name, and the other party directly transferred me to a so-called call center. The reservation center, then the reservation center directly said it had nothing to do with them and hung up. Then I found Ctrip to change the name. Ok, Ctrip has changed the name. Then I wanted to confirm with the hotel whether the change was successful, but I typed N again. I finally got through after a phone call, and they transferred me to the so-called reservation center. When the reservation center heard that the order was from Ctrip, they immediately said that they couldn't take care of it. Neither the hotel nor the reservation center asked me what I needed to do. They only heard me say that Ctrip would do it. Just transfer it or leave it alone! As a result, the most feared thing happened. The name changed by Ctrip was different from the name at the hotel front desk, so the guests could not check in normally when they arrived at the hotel. I originally paid more than 10,000 yuan for the room, but in the end, the guests still had to pay for the room themselves. As long as I can communicate with the hotel front desk, a similar incident will not happen. We invited customers to come to Beijing to discuss business, but they were charged. I really don’t know what the result will be. Fortunately, not bad, The lady at the front desk communicated and remedied the problem in a timely manner, which prevented the incident from escalating. I am very grateful to the lady at the front desk for her emergency response. She was very professional and sincere. The customer understood our intentions. We are all defeated by a polyphonic word! But I really can’t accept the switchboard and the so-called reservation center, especially the hotel switchboard, it’s too bad👎

住了二天（開會不得不多住一天）第二天才發現一樓居然有接待人員！接待人員不是在聊天就是玩手機，不對客人打招呼，感覺非常散漫。問他地鐵怎麼走，很不願意又很不耐煩的説，旁邊.......真實演繹什麼叫什麼眼看人低！難道住酒店的人不能座地鐵嗎？感覺太差了！下雨天回酒店還雨傘，前台竟然一個人都沒有，等了一會，來了幾個嘻嘻哈哈的年輕人，這就是前台啊！也不和客人打招呼，我不得已告知要還雨傘，幾位男生嘰嘰喳喳問房間號，然後説放這就行。酒店感覺不到是凱悦酒店的影子，我是入住了感覺入住了一個青年旅舍嗎？酒店團隊是一幫志願者在運營嗎？

msg:This is really a bad review. I have stayed in many hotels, high-end and mid-range, but I have never experienced anything like Zhaolong. I have never written a review, let alone a negative review, but Zhaolong would not go too far in writing a negative review. Complaints and feedback have been submitted to relevant departments.
