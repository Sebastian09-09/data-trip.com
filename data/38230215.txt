msg:Staying at the Oakwood Hotel in Sanya was one of the highlights of my trip. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was captivated by its modern and elegant design. The warmth and professionalism of the staff made me feel truly welcome, with every detail reflecting their commitment to guest experience.
The comfort of the room exceeded my expectations, not only with its advanced facilities and expansive view but also with the natural beauty of the island that it embraced. I especially appreciated the hotel's attention to detail, whether it was the thoroughness of the cleaning or the completeness of the leisure facilities, all of which made my stay exceptionally comfortable. Here, I enjoyed true relaxation and tranquility. 
For travelers seeking a high-quality accommodation experience, I highly recommend the Oakwood Hotel in Sanya. Thanks to the hard work and warm service of all the hotel staff, you made my trip to Sanya even more memorable!

The night market was boring and lots of repeated stores selling the same stuff. Worst was the noise from the night market could be heard even when we were on the 22nd floor!! The highest floor of the apartment building. Nothing nearby. Lucky we had hired a car with driver to bring us around Sanya.

There are many shops around so we could choose eat in or at the cafe O. Most of the staff there understood English and very helpful. The ocean was walking distance and the night market was right across the apartment! We will definitely recommend to  everyone who are looking for a simple place to stay with kitchen. We were able to get the laundry done while our kids swam for few hours on the same floor. It was all in all satisfied!

msg:Overall a very good stay.   I loved the balcony and the view.  Check in & out very fast and efficient. 

Very comfortable bed, excellent shower.  Clean and comfortable room.  It is a serviced apartment so it had a kitchen and fridge etc 

Somethings missing from the room such as no slippers and no coffee which I would expect from a hotel with this rating and room wasn't cleaned until 2pm each day when I would have preferred morning 

Laundrette, and 24h gym.  Pool wasn't very good and too many kids. 

Breakfast had enough variety BUT was the same every day so became a little boring and a lack of fruit options. Breakfast coffee was dreadful 

Location around 1KM from Sanya Bay, night market outside, on a highway so easy to get bus and taxi.  Around 20 mins to the airport.  

No real complaints and I was happy enough

msg:The hotel arranged a corner room when we arrived that day. Because it was late, I didn't want to bother with my child, and the child didn't want to sleep that night. I paid to upgrade the room the next day. As a result, the child found a rove beetle while playing in the room. Fortunately, the child did not come into direct contact, otherwise the consequences would be worrying. Rove beetles carry rove beetle poison, which is a toxin released when rove beetles sting humans and animals. It can cause redness, swelling, and burning pain at the sting site; it also produces lymphangitis; but the systemic reaction is mild, and chills, fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, increased pulse, delirium, and convulsions may occur. Severe cases may even lead to death. There are tens of thousands of cases of death from rove beetle bites across the country.

Suggestion: To eliminate rove beetles, you must first ensure environmental hygiene and clean them in a timely manner, including toilets and sewers, and garbage should be cleared in a timely manner. Because rove beetles like humid environments

Stayed in the hotel for four nights. It was surprisingly good.
The front desk was very friendly and almost responsive. The lobby manager Hannah also patiently introduced us to local food.
There is a tour group for Sanya tours opposite the front desk.
You can pick up takeout at the door and there is a supermarket.
The Yiheng Night Market is directly opposite the hotel. Going south, you can walk to the Coconut Dream Corridor.
The restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is quite good. The portion is not small and seafood can be processed.
The breakfast variety is also good. Steamed pork ribs, beef brisket rice noodles, tofu brain, and various rice porridges (we didn’t repeat them during the days we stayed there) are all delicious.
For the current off-season prices, such a location, room and service are really impeccable.
I must recommend it to other friends who come to Sanya

Go to the right of the hotel and there will be a Hello QR code scanning electric car on the roadside. It takes 10 minutes to ride to the beach~ There is also a Wanghao Supermarket nearby, where you can buy Hainan specialties~ The reason for the dissatisfaction with the service is that the front desk did not tell us about the other contents in the hotel package~ Everything must be booked one day in advance, and the follow-up photo was not scheduled, and the wild photography was bought at the beach... The beach car is not available on weekends.

But! Why is the 500 deposit collected outside the platform not refunded if I don’t call to inquire 3 days after leaving the hotel? Sometimes the schedule is busy and not everyone can remember.
Complain about such a big hotel, and it is guaranteed by Ctrip, but it actually requires 2 deposits, one double the room rate given on Ctrip, and the other 500 in cash at the counter.

I stayed in Sanya for several months last year and stayed at Autugu, Banshan Peninsula Intercontinental, Haitang Bay Grand Hyatt and InterContinental. I originally didn’t want to come to Sanya this year because of the service experience I had at the hotel last year. However, due to the weather, I still came. I didn’t want to come. The sea breeze was blowing, and it was very impromptu, so I casually booked Oakwood in the city center. Unexpectedly, the service was really great! ! ! [Xiao Lin at the front desk] is so cute, he even came to the hotel to help me on his day off! And they are very patient when changing floors and so on! ! ! The concierge at the door was also very nice. He took the initiative to open the door and took the luggage to the elevator! ! The cleaning lady is also very nice! !
One thing is that the noise is really loud. But the lighting is excellent. And the room feels very transparent for some reason! ! Don't feel depressed.
The only problem is the noise, but that's not a hotel problem. Drivers in Sanya love to honk their horns too much.

The price/performance ratio is very high. We went there during the National Day. The price was 499. The hotel-style apar**ent is much better than the ordinary residential-style apar**ent. The area is also very large. It has a layout of 1 bedroom, 1 living room, 1 kitchen and 1 bathroom. The decoration standard is not low at this level. Needless to say, the hotel is clean and sanitary. I especially praise the toiletries. They smell really good. I regret not taking more.

The surrounding commercial facilities are also very rich. There is a large night market opposite. It only takes about 15 minutes to drive to the nearby shopping mall.

I especially want to praise the service. Due to the weather, we actually went out to sea that day but were unable to come back and check out on time. The hotel was also very user-friendly and allowed us to delay our check-out twice even during the peak season during the National Day holiday. Based on this , 5 star praise

(I didn’t take the photo with my mobile phone, there really is a sea view)

There is no spatula or toothbrush. Should we share a set of toothbrushes for the double bed? Before we checked in, we were asked to wait a moment. The housekeeper would check first. The plug in the bathroom was not working. I wonder if I didn't use it correctly.

I saw the room and thought it was very good. There are kitchen facilities. My younger sister and her family like to cook by themselves. , I am not used to Hainan cuisine, it is neither spicy nor fragrant, so I chose this restaurant. My sister reported that the biggest feeling of living here is the good service, the hygiene details are in place, and the transportation is convenient. It is very convenient to go to the scenic spots here, and the location is very good. Opposite is the Internet celebrity Yiheng Night Market, and it is also close to Sanya Bay. It is really convenient. The breakfast in the restaurant is very rich. After staying for two nights, I bought seafood and cooked it myself. One night, I ate coconut chicken hot pot at the hotel.

Because it was a tram trip, I had to call in advance to consult. I booked it for the convenience of charging. However, the charging piles in the basement on site were not available.

Hygiene: Hygiene is really average. Maybe it’s because business has been so good recently and my aunt is too busy!
Environment: Opposite is the Yiheng Night Market, but trust me, your city has farmers’ market + night market standard products, which are expensive and not delicious, just for the people-watching!
Service: OK! Because I said a few words when I checked in.
For parent-child travel, at this price, you can actually book a family room in a nearby hotel, so that your children can also stay very comfortable.

msg:I took my mother on a trip to Sanya and read reviews online. This hotel is very close to the airport and the location is good, so I chose this hotel apar**ent.
When we first arrived at the hotel, there was a concierge who helped us with our luggage with a friendly attitude and a smiling service, which made us feel the enthusiasm of Hainan. The front desk service is also very good, meticulous and takes care of the guests. We checked in at the front desk and received a welcome drink from the staff, which made us feel the hotel's intentions.
When we came to the room, we were even more pleasantly surprised. The room was very spacious and the sight line was very good. The garden view suite we booked this time was full of greenery. It made us feel good, and the air in the room was also very good. The big balcony is great.
My mother was attracted by the kitchen, haha, it was the first time I lived in a hotel with a kitchen, and my mother felt very happy. Decided to go big. I learned from the front desk staff that there is a very famous third market nearby, so we went to buy seafood, and when I came back, my mother made a seafood feast, which tasted very good. , You can also taste the seafood delicacies made by your mother, the main one is fresh.
Facilities: The hotel has a gym, swimming pool, wet steam room, etc., with complete facilities.
Location: The location is excellent, close to the airport, and there is the Coconut Dream Corridor in Sanya Bay nearby. After dinner, I went for a walk on the beach with my mother and watched the scenery of the Coconut Dream Promenade, which was very pleasant.
The breakfast is also great. The most recommended is their Hainan special stalls, Hainan special food, snacks, etc., let us know more about Hainan food culture.
All in all, I am very happy to stay this time, and my mother is also very happy. She is full of praise for the hotel. I hope more people can come to experience this hotel. I will also recommend it to friends and relatives~

The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus, which can reach nearby beaches and duty-free shops, which is very convenient.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with a variety of Chinese and Western food to choose from, which makes people feel very fresh and delicious. The environment of the restaurant is also very good, spacious and bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows to enjoy the beautiful scenery.
The hotel's terrace restaurant is a very good dining place, overlooking the entire Sanya Bay, the scenery is very beautiful. When the sun sets in the evening, the a**osphere of the restaurant is extraordinarily romantic, which makes people feel very cozy.
Here, the sunset is beautiful, and it feels great to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sunset while enjoying delicious food with friends.
This is a very recommendable hotel with excellent location, good service, breakfast and terrace restaurant are very good. If I come to Hainan again next time, I will choose this place as my accommodation.

msg:Traveled to Sanya and enjoyed a romantic getaway, we chose this hotel because of the great location. It is very close to West Island, Sanya Bay, and Coconut Dream Corridor.
The hotel is apar**ent-style. For young couples, the refrigerator is very good. It can hold a lot of drinks and keep it cold for a summer.
The room is spacious, with a wide view, and the overall feeling is very good.
The service is warm and thoughtful, and the staff are very patient.
The breakfast is rich, and the terrace restaurant is especially recommended. In the evening, the sunset is infinitely beautiful and the a**osphere is full. I ordered the Western-style set meal for couples recommended by the restaurant manager. I was pleasantly surprised and had a romantic setting.
Recommend this hotel!

msg:The first time I chose an apar**ent hotel, it happened that this hotel is very close to Sanya Airport, so I chose Oakwood Apar**ents Sanya on the first night when I arrived in Sanya. It's amazing.
Service: The service quality is five-star. When you get off the car, the concierge will help you open the door and unscrew your luggage. There is also a free underground parking lot, which is especially suitable for friends like us who rent a car at the airport and drive here! The front desk was also very patient and enthusiastic when we checked in. All the questions we asked were answered enthusiastically, and they also actively recommended attractions and food around the hotel to us.
Room facilities: The room is spacious and bright. It is the first time to stay in a hotel with a kitchen, which is completely amazing. Kitchen facilities, equipment and kitchen utensils are all available, a proper home in Sanya. The room also has a big balcony, which is really great!
Location: First of all, the location is very superior. It is adjacent to the Coconut Dream Corridor. Sanya starts to cool down in the evening. From the hotel, it takes more than 10 minutes to walk to the beach of Sanya Bay. The sunset on the beach is beautiful. Walking along the Coconut Dream Promenade Look at the coconut groves in Hainan, the air is particularly fresh. Walking on the beach and walking back, it is necessary to go to the Internet celebrity Yiheng Night Market opposite the hotel. There are many snacks and tourist souvenirs here, and it is very lively. I also bought fruits from Hainan, which are fresh and sweet. If I can’t eat them, I can put them in the refrigerator in the hotel room to keep them fresh.
Breakfast: First of all, the decoration of the restaurant is very trendy, and the breakfast is also very rich. What surprised me the most was that the hotel specially prepared special Hainan stalls, which are very good. Let us start to understand Hainan culture from food. In addition to Hainan special stalls, there are also many hot food stalls. There are chefs who specially prepare them for us on the spot. . In addition, bread, egg tarts, cakes and other pastries are also particularly rich.
The hotel is also equipped with a gym, a constant temperature semi-outdoor swimming pool, a steam room, etc., which are very complete.
Thank you very much to all the members of Oakwood Apar**ents Sanya for a pleasant staying experience and recommending it to more friends.

msg:As a family room for 3 people, everything is only for two people, because the time is late, the toothbrush and slippers are now required the next morning. The so-called sofa bed collapsed in the middle of sitting on it, and a thin mattress was placed on it and wrapped in plastic paper, which was not airtight at all. Because I had to catch a plane in the middle of the night the next day and didn’t want to bother to change places, I booked an extension on Ctrip for one night. After that, I asked the front desk if I needed to check in again. The reply said no, but I just swiped the room card when I went out and had a meal. The door was closed, and I went down to the front desk again to go through the formalities, and said that I needed a deposit of 500. After paying the deposit, I called again and said to pay the deposit within three hours. Do I have to do an entry on each computer? As for the welcome coffee and the like, I didn't see it at all, and I didn't bother to ask. In short, it is better than the worst five-star, there is no one.

The room facilities are well-equipped, the living room is large, and there is a complete kitchen, refrigerator, toaster, kitchen utensils, etc. The hotel is very close to the third market.

Restaurant: Breakfast is also very rich, dinner and lunch can be a la carte, and there are also set meals, the taste is great! Tried the restaurant's new coconut chicken hot pot, authentic Hainanese flavor, great!
The hotel environment is very good, with gymnasium, swimming pool, steam room and children's playground. There are also rich parent-child activities in the hotel every day, especially suitable for families with children traveling! recommended~

The hotel is very new and the service attitude is very good. The location is very good, just across from Yiheng Night Market, and close to the airport.
Breakfast is also good, although there are not many choices, but the taste is good.

The only thing I'm not very satisfied with is the breakfast, which has a variety of varieties, but I feel that the material is very ordinary, the coffee is not good, the hot milk is watered, and the ingredients and varieties are not up to the five-star standard.

There is a bus stop at the door, it is very convenient to go to the old city or the train station. Although the hotel is opposite the night market, you can't hear it when you close the windows on the 7th floor.

Free upgrade to a one-bedroom sea view suite, the space is amazing! often! big! The sea view is overlooked from the large balcony, and the blue sky and white clouds are extremely healing.

The interior of the room is as shown in the pictures, the hardware is well maintained, and there are all kinds of equipment. The elevator in the room needs to swipe the card, which is quite safe.

The only slight disadvantage is that the wooden furniture is located in Sanya, and the room has a slight musty smell, which is unavoidable, but it is not worth mentioning in terms of cost performance... Overall, five-star praise! ! !

msg:Ten years ago, my wife was dispatched to work in Guangzhou. For a while, I often lived in Oakwood behind the Sports East, so I had a good impression of Oakwood, so I chose this hotel again this time. The hotel is very close to the Mangrove Hotel, and the check-in experience is also very good. Very comfortable, absolutely cost-effective, suites are also very suitable for traveling with children.

Zhou Yongyuan at the front desk is very kind and the service is very good ~ and the road opposite the hotel is Yiheng Night Market and Yiheng Seafood Wholesale. It is very convenient to go to Huixincun food stalls in one stop! We cooked two seafood meals by ourselves~ the price/performance ratio is great! The hotel pool photo is also very good! Overall worthy of praise!

msg:I stayed for three nights in March. During the day, the hotel was constantly being renovated and there was noise. I entered the group and automatically replied that there was a free bus to Yalong Bay. Then I asked the customer service and said no, and asked me to ask Ctrip customer service. The reply was sent by the hotel customer service, and then I went Let me ask the customer service of the hotel. I thought the environment was okay, but if the service couldn’t keep up, I didn’t like it immediately. Downstairs is the Yiheng Night Market. There are many people and crowded, and there is nothing to choose from. I don’t really want to eat seafood. Yes, you will hear the music of the night market until very late at night, and it is difficult to fall asleep. There is a coffin shop on the left hand side of the hotel, and it is scary to walk through it at night. The sea view is not very good, just a little bit, there is no pick-up service, temporary living is okay, I feel that there are not many young people.

msg:This is the second time I stayed at Oakwood Hotel, this time I was not satisfied with the last time. This time I bought a package to stay in the hotel. First of all, I would like to thank the front desk for helping us upgrade the room type. Secondly, the front desk is obviously not enough. I saw several other male waiters I was joking around, and there was no reception at the entrance of the hotel. I felt that the front desk was very busy. After I checked in, I found that the kitchen supplies in the room were not cleaned. I hope the hotel can pay attention next time. Secondly, I found a little blood on the quilt, and the sofa There are other people's hair on it, and it is not cleaned. People with some cleanliness may not be able to stand it. The point is that the hotel is next to the night market, which is especially noisy at night! The sound insulation is not very good. I asked for some ice cubes at the front desk at night, but I never gave them. In the end, I went down to the restaurant to ask for it. I feel that the attitude of the waiters is relatively average, especially the male waiters. The hardware facilities of the hotel are also good, and it is a business trip Good choice! This time I would like to thank Tao the resident manager. Although he is not in Sanya, he will help to deal with any problems in time. Although the hotel cannot use the benefits of the Yaxing Club, the manager still tries his best to satisfy it, which is very good! Finally, I want to say that I hope to get better service next time I stay in the hotel. I hope the hotel can manage the personnel well and carry out more training and strengthening!

msg:It has been more than a week since I came back from Sanya, and I have been complaining and defending my rights. The originally pleasant Spring Festival trip has become difficult because of this hotel. I booked a total of three rooms and brought my beloved pet with me. Because the hotel staff is not very friendly to dogs, my family asked the front desk. After returning, I honestly commented on the hotel’s services. Unexpectedly, the hotel didn’t understand the actual situation. Reply directly, I feel that there is no problem with the service awareness and service attitude of the staff. After the family made a representation, the hotel shamelessly modified the parameters of the background to make pets not allowed. The family had no choice but to find third-party information to prove it I am not talking nonsense, I saved all the results in screenshots, and even found news that the hotel once used rodent control ***** to cause the death of pets due to poor management. Moreover, the hotel also provided a pet accommodation agreement when we checked in, and we also took screenshots Save, in this case, the hotel manager is still arguing that pets are never allowed?
       Since then, after repeated negotiations with the family, in order to avoid trouble, the hotel did not reply to our questions, and hastily deleted the previous irresponsible comments that were completely inconsistent with the facts. This is an eye-opener. At the beginning, we were objectively commenting on the check-in experience, but now, what makes us angry is the chaotic hotel management and irresponsible remarks! I hope the hotel will give us the reply and apology we deserve as soon as possible according to the actual situation!

Winter at 25 degrees Celsius, sunshine, beaches, various fruits and seafood, immersed in the blue sea and blue sky, can make the body and mind get a full range of rest and relaxation. This Oakwood apar**ent is the second hotel I stayed in Sanya this time. There is a big night market opposite, bustling with people, and various fruit, drink and seafood food stalls soothe countless tourists who are tired from the journey. The Coconut Dream Corridor next to it is suitable for walking, blowing the sea breeze, watching the ebb and flow of the tide, it is definitely a pleasant enjoyment. The apar**ent is equipped with cooking utensils. It is a better choice to purchase seafood and ingredients to cook by yourself. Delonghi's kettle looks good and has a retro beauty. A nice winter getaway. I also want to thank the staff of the apar**ent, especially Mandy at the front desk, everyone is going well, goodbye!

msg:When I came to Sanya by myself, I thought it would be more convenient to live in a place close to the city. I saw Oakwood's good location, so I decided on this hotel
The room situation is relatively tight in December, so the room was not upgraded at the beginning
The garden view room is the same as in the video, facing the community and relatively quiet
There is nothing to complain about the hardware facilities in the room. It is relatively new. The bathroom is made of Kohler Cole. The shower experience is very good. The linen is also okay. The thin duvet is more comfortable. The room is cleaned very well and the accessories are very useful
The biggest disadvantage is that the sound insulation of the guest rooms is not good. It does not refer to the sound insulation of human voices, but the sound of moving chairs in the corridors and floors. Because I am more concerned about these, I feel very noisy and the experience is not very good.
After reporting this problem to the front desk, I have been actively solving it. I have changed rooms a few times, and it has been relieved. However, it has been troublesome to change rooms these days, and I have not even opened my luggage.
Fortunately, the service of the hotel is very good. The front desk staff, including Xiao Wang who checked me in, have a very good attitude and have been doing their best. I still have to give a full five-point praise.
Will consider living next time

However, because I had to clean, there were a lot of calls. I couldn't get through to the landline, so I called the mobile phone! I told you I would clean up later and I would call you! Lots of phone calls to make! I can understand that the cleaning lady has to get off work, but I’m here to rest, not to answer your phone all the time! This is understandable. After checking out, I had something to do and delayed my time. I was going to take a shower, pack my things and leave. The front desk called me to ask if I wanted to extend my stay. I said I wanted to leave, so I took a shower and left. The front desk immediately told you to pack your things and come down quickly. It was almost time to check out. Then he hung up the phone on me. I really can't be rude, otherwise I really want to curse. All the good moods were ruined! Damn it, I'm only ten minutes late. Dogs don't even stay in this hotel.

msg:This is the second time I have booked this hotel. This hotel has a good location, very close to the Third Market, and there is a kitchen in the hotel where you can process seafood by yourself, which is very convenient. It's a pity that the hotel's front desk management is poor. I booked two rooms. When I checked in and paid the deposit for the first room, the front desk casually said that the deposit and the room fee should be collected in an integer, so the deposit would be 1,200+ (it is a number with zeros and integers, which will be charged when checking out later). It was difficult to calculate how much of the refunded deposit would be) I refused and asked for the deposit to be withheld according to the hotel's requirements. Two days later, when I came to check in for the second room, I met the same receptionist. She gave me the room above the laundry room. The room was extremely noisy. After being arranged to change rooms later, although there was no resonant sound of washing clothes, there were sounds of stools scratching the floor and doors being banged around 1, 2, and 3 o'clock in the middle of the night. What's even weirder is the check-out time on the last day. The hotel check-out time is 2pm. I just lay down and wanted to sleep for a while to check out at noon. The front desk still called me and said that the hotel rooms were fully booked. I told her that my check-out time hadn't come yet, but she said that guests were already waiting in the lobby. I don’t quite understand the front desk’s thinking. Does having a fully booked hotel room have anything to do with me? What the front desk lady conveyed to me was that the hotel was fully booked and I needed to check out early to make room for other guests.

The expatriate general manager is even more hands-on, serving in the lobby and restaurant and listening to every visitor. The room area and configuration are better than the surrounding international chain brand hotels.

msg:Too bad. This hotel is completely different from Oakwood in my impression. I have stayed in Hangzhou. It is very clean and the whole room has no peculiar smell. But here, it's really amazing. As soon as the door is opened, there is a smell of smoke. I wanted to call the front desk to ask for a room change, but it was past 2:00 in the morning. One night, the hotel is opposite Yiheng Night Market, so it is convenient to eat snacks. Let's talk about room service. I asked for two bottles of water and they didn't deliver it when I left the store. Do you think this service is good? ? ? This hotel is a little better like a home. If you come with children, don't stay here, the smell is too strong! ! !

Environment: The design of the hotel is more fashionable and avant-garde. It is designed according to the standard of high-end apar**ents. It should take into account the living needs of the three eastern provinces in winter. The pots and pans in the suite are well-equipped, sterilized and sealed. The decoration in the room is bright and simple, with good lines and lighting design. The outdoor corridor is designed with a coffee table for reading and smoking, and the city construction has a panoramic view. If you live in a high-rise south-facing room, you can face the blue sea directly.
Hygiene: The hotel's hygiene feels good, waiting for you to check in.
Transportation: Transportation, shopping, and food are all very convenient. The business meals in the hotel should look great on the menu, and they are cheap and good quality. The authentic delicacies with Hainan characteristics in the nearby Yemeng Corridor will make people linger.

As a result, when we arrived at the hotel, we said that we could not find our order. After searching for a long time, we found that there was only a room at the end of the corridor left... Fortunately, we upgraded the hotel room type for free.

There is nothing to say about the hotel's sanitation environment, which is much higher than other apar**ent-style hotels.
It is also more cost-effective to buy coupons for breakfast in advance, and the price is very high. The restaurant is exquisite in taste and presentation, and still uses my favorite Luzern utensils. Very kind.

Sea view room Ctrip has free room upgrade, upgraded to a high floor, very good

First of all, I commend the room service on the 21st and 18th floors. The cleaning is very serious and professional. Everything is carefully cleaned, and the bedding will also be changed, which is super nice.

In terms of room configuration, it has reached the five-star standard as a whole. The view of the sea is really good, and the high-rise garden view is also very good. The refrigerator is convenient and there are kitchenware available for free (30/50 for cleaning if not cleaned). The sea view has a bathtub, which looks ok.

The egg tarts for breakfast are delicious, and the fruits include Fei Zixiao and Lianwu, which are quite good. You can also pack them up for an extra two yuan.

Geographically, it is located in the urban area, and it is very convenient to go to the surrounding area. It is generally 6-10 yuan to take a taxi (Didi is a lot more expensive). The hotel has a direct bus to Haitang Bay, just make an appoin**ent one day in advance.

In the end, the palace full of Xiting is not bad, you can arrange the number in Gaode, and superimpose the 200-100 Sanya consumer coupons, which is quite cost-effective

The price is 4 times more expensive. Maybe the difference of more than 1,200 is all the beach tickets, and even in the off-season, there are still many people in Marriott. The breakfast and dining environment is average. If I can come back, I will choose Okwu Germany, the beaches of Yalong Bay can go to public beaches.

The decoration here not only chooses the high-end style recognized by the international mainstream, but also considers the comfort of the details, but it is a pity that the tableware has broken a lot of wild turtles from the countryside, and the overall hardware maintenance is quite good. The Hainanese chicken set meal in the restaurant on the second floor is very style and fragrant. I hope there are more single meals to choose from.

Under the sheets in the new room, there are still hair and body hair, and the floor is full of hair and body hair. The toilet has a card issued by the last guest, which is disgusting.

msg:I like the hotel very much. It is well-equipped and has a kitchen, especially the garbage shredder which is too convenient to dispose of kitchen waste. There are also public laundry rooms and dryers. Recently, the epidemic has repeated. After going out, they will wash clothes in high temperature mode, which is very convenient! The services are all kind of thoughtful but socially distancing, suitable for social terrorists. Staying in summer vacation for two consecutive years, I really love it. You can rent an electric car from the nearby Dianping’s Lemongrass home for 30 yuan a day, which is convenient for going to the beach, visiting the park, and going to Song of Youth. At night, the night market opposite the night market has a great fruit, five dragon fruits for ten yuan, three large mangoes per catty, and three boxes of freshly cut fruits for twenty. The unsatisfactory place is the cold water in the swimming pool, and it would be better to have robots to deliver food to the room. The first recommended room type is one bedroom and one living room on the upper floor. Xiaoli at the front desk is very warm and thoughtful.

3樓泳池，又遇21年幫我們拍照的泳池小哥凌豪，開朗熱情好客，主動介紹，交流愉快，還捧出了粉嫩可愛的火烈鳥泳圈，幫我們拍了好多漂亮照片。小哥哥特贊，五分好評！👍👍👍
前台小姐姐田女士、姜先生為人友善，熱情周到，提前安排好房間，入住、換房一切順暢，贊👍。
每年來三亞，都住這裏，對面就是億恆夜市，在房間就能看海，交通方便，位置優越。

設施：酒店的設施很完善，3樓泳池及健身中心和桑拿。
衞生：衞生環境很好，酒店的客房打掃永遠都是在第一時間趕到為您清理。
環境：酒店位於億恆主題夜市對面，吃喝一站式都能滿足。無論多晚，都有一款美食適合你。

服務：酒店員工的素質很好，從進入大堂開始，前台服務人員都是微笑服務，彬彬有禮，然後每天客房的保潔人員，也是保持微笑服務，特別是當客人在房間的時候，保潔人員打掃的時候會非常小心，聲音也非常輕，儘量做到對客人的影響最小化，這種細緻入微的服務，讓人有賓至如歸的感覺。

msg:非常良心的酒店公寓，一家老小5大2小住了5晚，兩室一廳的豪華家庭海景房，一切都非常nice～非常推薦！

首先房型是貨真價實的海景房，早上起床一拉窗簾就是碧海藍天，也很衞生。

房型上很寬敞，包括衞生間，整體裝修是我喜歡的風格，很多木質傢俱彰顯品質，設施也很新…

廚房可以做飯，該有的都有，很方便…

服務也不錯，車到樓下保安會過去主動開門，房間需要打掃也響應很快…

位置上離海邊不遠，樓下有便利店很方便，對面就是一個很大的夜市，晚上很熱鬧，房間的隔音不錯，不會影響休息…

如果説非要哪裡不是十分滿意的話，那就早餐吧，今天離開三亞提前預訂了早餐一人六十八，感覺比較一般，但也不至於説難吃，該有的都有。

我告訴大家一個選酒店的心得，看真實評價還得是在booking這類國外的app，比較少會出現刷好評的評的情況，很多不同其他國家的遊客的評價，更加客觀，國內的app好評怎麼來的大家應該心裡有數吧，那你要問我為什麼在攜程上買，那是因為攜程的性價比更高，反正多比較吧。

最後推薦樓下有一個旅行點，體驗下來覺得挺實在的，超過我的預期，特別是遠海潛水，咔咔

以上是自己的一些客觀評價，希望對您的出行有所幫助。

環境：房間也大，一個小套房，離億恆夜市和三亞站很近，都很方便
服務：感謝前台小哥免費延遲退房，送物也很快

缺點：奔着恆温泳池來的，因為帶着孩子，結果那個水又冷風又大，在三樓露天的一角。根本不是恆温。
早餐沒吃過。瓶裝水每天衹有四瓶，超過了收兩元。對於一晚一千多的房間來説屬實不行。

酒店房間的海景也是一線海景，房間還帶有廚房，自己動手，即使旅遊也能給寶貝吃乾淨衞生且健康的食物啦！三亞當地海鮮非常新鮮！
酒店還提供了多種親子活動。我們參加了diy蛋糕活動，孩子在廚師的指導下親手製作了自己的蛋糕。這是一次難忘的體驗，孩子學到了許多新的東西。
酒店服務質量高，每一位員工都微笑服務，且耐心細緻。地理位置佳，在三亞市中心，離三亞灣椰夢長廊近，對面是網紅億恆夜市，總之非常方便！
如果你正在尋找一個適合親子家庭的住宿地點，那麼我強烈推薦三亞公寓酒店。孩子們一定會度過一段愉快的時光。

msg:一家三口到三亞旅行，在網上看了很多酒店，最終選了這家酒店的海景套房。就酒店後，發現很棒。首先服務很好，我們行李多，一到酒店就有禮賓員幫忙取行李，太感謝啦。然後前台也是微笑服務，很有耐心，而且還有歡迎飲料，深深感受到了海南的熱情。房間衞生細節到位，房間大且明亮，還有大大的陽台，海景也是一線，呆在房間就是一種享受。酒店配套設施齊全，房間有廚房，冰箱，洗衣機，太方便了。早餐很豐盛，大家很喜歡，特別是海南特色檔口的海南小吃味道很贊。酒店三樓還有泳池，健身房，濕蒸房等。真的是性價比之王，我們很喜歡這裏的套房，推薦給大家。

億恒夜市就在酒店旁邊，走5分鐘左右就到，很近。
房間的隔音比較差，住了3晚，不知道是樓上還是隔壁房間的住客常常拖椅子，搬東西，到1點左右才比較安靜，較難入睡的要考慮一下這個問題。

優點：便捷，換洗衣物方便，吃東西方便，像在家裡一樣，還有人專門打掃房間，且挺乾淨。
缺點：畢竟是公寓式管理'除基礎服務外，幾乎沒有其它服務，定位在這，也可忽略不計。
但唯獨有一些落差的點在於前台與客人之間的溝通方式，入住前打電話溝通想要高一些樓層，但態度不是很友好且很不削的告知必須有人退房才能安排，事是這麼事，我不會蠻不講理，但如果您能換個語氣，或不要那麼不耐煩的説出原因，可能更容易讓我欣然接受。轉念一想，其實對酒店已經很熟悉了，外面也真沒啥景觀可言，低樓層也沒什麼不好，後期也沒有再找前台調換房間。因為我害怕，害怕他們的語言會在一次傷害我，讓我失望。畢竟我還是很喜歡這裏的，我也還會在選擇這裏過年。

msg:這個酒店住了幾次，最近3年平均每年住1周到10天。來説説體驗，管理和服務每況愈下。最近的這次入住也就是2022年底，體驗很差。因為先訂了幾天，後來又在攜程上續訂，一天晚上很累的回到酒店，前台説您續訂了麻煩再付一下按金，我説第一天辦入住的時候已經付了按金而且沒有消費就不用再付按金了，然後前台開始跟我糾纏。在客人很累很想回房間休息的情況下為了一點小事跟客人糾纏。客人不可能逃單，就算客人逃單也有攜程的擔保金，而且我也入住多次前台都認識，不知道為什麼要為了幾百塊按金跟客人糾纏不讓客人回房間休息。更奇葩的來了，因為我有幾天晚上才出門所以白天一直在酒店，客房服務一直來催問何時可以打掃（想快點完成任務這也可以理解），然後就讓她5點以後來打掃。一天中午就出門了，並告訴前台讓客房服務來打掃衞生，結果下午五點多回到酒店，房間沒有打掃。我很惱火，投訴到酒店值班經理，值班經理來了一句“我們員工都有自己的工作安排，不是圍着你轉的”，好了，我12點出門5點回酒店，特地關照前台讓打掃房間，中間5個小時，他們員工有安排沒時間來打掃。我當場退房走人，看到我要退房走人了，前台經理和客房經理都來賠禮道歉想挽留………總結一下個人的入住體驗吧，前台員工除了一二個比較成熟的比較懂得待人接物的，其他好像完全沒有受過培訓，為了一點小事跟客人拜辭。酒店值班經理更是不知所謂不清楚是不是做酒店管理出身的，衹能説上樑不正………。廚房的鍋具也不好，早餐也不好吃。應該以後也不會入住了。
