msg:It was the perfect choice for a relaxing staycation. The room exceeded our expectations, being larger than usual, beautifully but simply decorated and very clean. The toiletries provided were excellent in terms of quality, variety and quantity. The service was exceptional, even with the hotel being quite full on the Saturday of the long weekend. A huge shout out to Ian, who went out of his way to help, provided service in fluent English, and even added our WeChat to make our stay more convenient.  The hot springs themselves were well maintained, conveniently located and offered a good variety of experiences. No hotel is complete without offering up good food - and Regal resort didn't disappoint here either. The hotel has a western and Chinese restaurant. We enjoyed both the breakfast and dinner buffets very much, and even gobbled up a delicious pizza at the lobby bar. The lobby also has great live music performed by a team of Phillipino singers - we just wish it lasted longer, as 20:45 seems a bit early to stop the entertainment.

The only snag during our stay - we were refused entry by staff to the hot spring caves the night we arrived because we were dressed in non-swimwear, despite us clearly stating that we just wanted to view the facilities, not actually get into the pools. Apparently the policy states we must wear swimsuits to enter. I  saw another guest experience this too, and thought surely common sense should prevail.

Other than that, it was a perfect experience. One of those rare occasions where 5* actually means 5*.

msg:Another spontaneous trip. After thinking about it, I decided to go to Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel.
The guard saluted politely and entered the indoor parking lot. Take the elevator directly to the lobby. Miss Guan, the lobby manager, is considerate and explains in detail. She also upgraded the room for free. I am so happy!

Entering the room, it is still so clean and hygienic. Put down the power card and the window screen will automatically pull up. Wow~ advanced. The bed is a Mousse bed, very comfortable. Standing on the balcony, you can see the waterfall of Baishuizhai. Not bad~ The room has a very good mute effect. You can't hear the sound outside. For people with light sleep, it is still very comfortable.

While there is still time before the buffet dinner time, go to the hot spring. The service lady in the hot spring dressing area is still very considerate. Tell you where to change clothes and where the wardrobe is.

Entering the hot spring area, it may be in May. There are not many people going to the hot spring. Each hot spring pool is covered with tiles, so you don't have to worry about rain. This is very comfortable for cloudy and rainy days. If you are afraid of rain, it is very good to go here. There are hot springs of all sizes, especially cave hot springs. Very good.

When booking, the hotel buffet dinner was included. The food is quite rich, including seafood, stir-fried dishes, staple food, cakes, sashimi, etc. It is said that the hotel has its own bakery, so the cakes, cookies, and pastries are made by themselves. I really love chocolate coffee cookies. They are delicious and soft.

The breakfast variety is quite rich. Chinese morning tea snacks, soup noodles, rice rolls, Western bread, salad. Every time I feel that my stomach cannot be bigger for breakfast. I want to eat everything.
I hope the hotel breakfast has egg tarts for dinner, because I want to eat~

The check-out process is very simple. Just hand in the key. Parking is free.

The room is large, about 70 square meters, spacious
The decoration is also quite grand, and the facilities are pretty good
The bed is 2.4 meters, and it is spacious for one large and two small, and it is very comfortable to sleep
The service is pretty good, and every time you leave, you will be given a small gift, which makes the children very happy and the experience is very good
The water facilities are also pretty good, there are both indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and you can also go rafting and boating
It would be better if the indoor amusement park did not charge extra

Hygiene: This is my third time to this hotel. I am not picky about hygiene. There is no obvious lack of feeling in the room. Full marks.

Environment: I prefer quietness. The villa is not in the main building, and there are not many people staying nearby. I like such a quiet environment. The only improvement should be that the lobby is not air-conditioned, and I sweated during afternoon tea. But if I don’t like it, I won’t come back for the third time, so the environment is still perfect.

Service: I always say that Baishuizhai Jiahua is the best service in the hot spring hotels I have stayed in. Unfortunately, this time I was deducted one point for service by the Chinese restaurant. The doorman, reception, room service, dining, and service staff in the hot spring are all very polite and greet each other when they see each other. Very good. It’s just that the director of the ordering depar**ent in the Chinese restaurant speaks in a shady way. The low sales exceeded a lot and kept asking for more dishes and said it was not enough. Fortunately, my wife followed and calculated and found that it exceeded several hundred and subtracted some. The price for 6 people was 1600+. I thought it was not as low as 1500. What a guy, he wanted to rip me off on my birthday. This is the only point I deducted.

Service: Five stars + The waiter is very considerate, and the check-in and check-out are very fast. There are also waiters in the hot spring area who take the initiative to deliver hot drinks and towels, and the changing area. Because my parents are not familiar with how to use it, they have been attentive to guide.

Others: Baby playground, additional fee, but you can let the baby go in and play for half a day, and adults can be lazy, which is not bad.

The Western restaurant is very good, mainly because there are not many people when I go there, I feel very enjoyable

 ps: The infinity pool on the top of the mountain is suitable for taking photos and can be used for filming~
[Chinese Medicine Hot Spring] The outdoor semi-covered hot spring has various health-care effects. You can try them all!

[Southeast Asian Style] The hotel has walking trails, and the hot spring scenery on the top of the mountain is also very good. The gardening is very attentive. The hotel environment is relatively new, and there is no musty smell that is common in hot spring hotels in Guangdong.
[Raise expectations] The sound insulation effect is average, you can hear the stamping of feet upstairs, the buffet breakfast is rich, but the taste of the dishes is average.
Overall good value for money, will come again~

msg:A complete bad review, it's a big minefield!!!

The service attitude is extremely bad, they don't listen to the customer's demands. I have been to so many hot spring hotels, but this is the first time I have encountered such a strong merchant. They left the customer at the door of the hot spring for more than 20 minutes and did not let the child in. They successfully made the child cry.

I complained to the manager in the lobby and talked about a lot of irrelevant things for about 20 minutes, but nothing happened. They didn't listen to the demands at all.

The outdoor water playground is closed, there are few hot spring pools, they are small, dirty, and crowded!

Bundled sales of unpalatable buffets, and forced to order buffets to upgrade hotel rooms.

The buffet western restaurant is a joke, with few dishes and unpalatable taste. It is not difficult to understand why the hotel room is bundled for unsalable dishes. The buffet at 198 per person is very low cost performance! ! !

The game machine that hits the villain steals coins. I told the staff. The staff looked resentful and reluctantly replenished the coins!

I will not come again.

However, the attitude of the staff at the entrance of the hot spring was a bit bad, which was a small flaw.
It rained for two days in the hotel, which was equivalent to soaking in the hotel the whole time. There were some places for children's activities, and the experience was not bad. Due to the rain, only a small part of the hot spring area was opened, and there was no chance to play in the children's water park, which was a little regretful.
I will come again next time.

msg:Everything is good, but there are a few small suggestions, which only represent my personal stay experience:
1. The hot spring area is indoors and the light is a bit dim.
2. The children's water area is outdoor, and there is almost no constant temperature pool. I only found that the wave pool was warm, and the other water pools were cold.
3. The buffet is very good, but the efficiency of the raw porridge for breakfast can be improved, especially the preserved egg and lean meat porridge should be cooked in advance and put aside for guests to serve directly.
In addition, Li Limin's service is very warm and considerate, and she also gave me a doll when I checked out.

msg:It's so comfortable, I recommend it with full marks! I praise the service of Xiao Su at the front desk. She knew it was my birthday and asked the restaurant to prepare a birthday cake. She also upgraded the bed with mountain view. The bed was so comfortable. You can also see the big waterfall in the room, and there is a big bathtub. Children and adults had fun in the hot springs. The ice and fire springs are very exciting and you can experience them. Green tea soup is the most recommended. The restaurant environment is very good. Comments say that the buffet is not delicious. I personally think it tastes pretty good. The salmon is still fresh and cut thick enough, haha. Xiao Guan at the front desk was enthusiastic, the check-out was fast, and he gave the children a small gift, which made the children very happy. It was a very pleasant trip and I will come again!

msg:My colleague said that Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel has a beautiful environment and fresh air, so we decided to come here for a short weekend vacation.
Service: The service here is very good. We arrived early, and the handsome guy Wu Mingxi helped us check in and upgraded the room in advance. The environment is beautiful, and you can see the Baishuizhai Waterfall. He also introduced the various attractions of the hotel in detail. All service staff are very polite and greet everyone when they see them.
Room: Super large and well-planned, dry and wet separation, comfortable bedding.
Hot spring: There are many pools, and the mountaintop hot spring is first-class for taking photos.

msg:1. The room is large and elegantly decorated, equipped with a bathtub and private bath. The most important thing is that the bedding is very clean and comfortable.
2. There are many choices in the hot spring area. The infinity pool on the mountaintop hot spring is very beautiful, and the bubble pool and ice fire pool in the cave hot spring are also very unique. It is recommended to go to the dry steam and stone bath after soaking in the hot springs, which will be very relaxing and comfortable.
3. The hotel package comes with many additional activities. After soaking in the hot springs, you can pick strawberries and play go-karts. The breakfast options are rich and nutritious, and the lobby water bar also has many affordable options.
4. The front desk service is professional and thoughtful, and all the staff encountered have good service attitudes. Thank you very much to the manager for upgrading our room and giving us a cute doll when we checked out~

msg:I have been to the Jiahua Hotel in Huizhou Jinhaiwan before and was very satisfied. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the Jiahua Hotel in Baishuizhai this time.
Let me talk about the advantages first: the room is big enough, the hygiene is good, and the mountain view is great. The hot spring area is big enough, especially the cave area has many pools, which can be soaked on rainy days, which is a plus. The Chinese restaurant and the lobby bar have good Chinese and Western food. Although the price is high, this price and this product are acceptable in a resort hotel.
Let's talk about the disadvantages: the service really didn't keep up, and it felt like such a good hardware was wasted. First of all, this is the first resort hotel I have encountered at this price that does not have a free minibar. Secondly, the indoor children's playground is charged extra, which is also surprising. Third, although there are more people during the Qingming Festival holiday, there are long queues for check-in and breakfast, and there is basically no service in the hot spring area. It feels that the hotel's peak preparation is too poor.
In summary, the experience may be much better if I come to a low season with good weather, but I probably won't brush it twice.

Once I entered the room, I was really surprised. It was very large, clean, and tasteful. It was very special to listen to the rain and soak in the private hot spring. The buffet in the hotel was also reasonably priced, the products were very good, and there were some small surprises. Then there was the hot spring area. There was a large indoor cave hot spring, so you don’t have to worry about heavy rain. Moreover, each hot spring has a covered roof. The view was beautiful and the water was good. It was always a very pleasant experience~

The hotel is luxuriously decorated, the rooms are super large, and the supporting facilities are very complete. The view outside the balcony is superb! The outdoor hot spring and the hot spring in the room are very comfortable. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel tastes very good! It's just that it's the peak period of Qingming Festival, so the check-in queue time is a little longer. In addition, the front desk phone in the room is always busy.

I would like to thank the handsome Wu Mingxi who checked in. He was patient, kind, enthusiastic and polite. There were too many people that day and we had to queue up to check in. The brothers and sisters were very patient in receiving every customer. They were very professional! It was my husband's birthday and the first time I stayed with a young baby. The hotel sent a very beautiful cake, which was delivered on time. I was very happy! The buffet was also very good. It had everything it should have, and it was replenished in a timely manner. The hot spring was also great. Many staff members in the hotel would say hello and make the baby laugh. It was very nice! It was a very pleasant vacation and I will come again!

When checking in, Xiao Su checked in quickly and politely, and expressed clearly. He also took the initiative to upgrade our room type. The hotel is good, give it a thumbs up👍
This time, I went on vacation with my family and our little dog. Although the hotel is a dog-friendly hotel, since the dog's activity space is except for the lobby and the room, it is required not to bring dogs in, and they can only be placed in the dog house outside. Generally, companion dogs are basically inseparable from their owners. I think that dog-friendly hotels basically have few starting points for owners and dogs, so that the hotel's facilities are basically not enjoyed, and even breakfast has to be eaten separately. It is recommended that since the hotel is a dog-friendly hotel, I hope to consider sharing activity space or services between owners and dogs.

Environment: It feels like the hot spring area has been renovated, and the overall feeling is good.

Service: The waiters are always smiling, and the waiters in the Chinese restaurant are also nice.

Hygiene: good as always.

Facilities: The facilities for children can be improved. Because of the rain, it felt like there was nowhere to play.
The room has an upgraded garden view room, but the view is not as good as the garden view room I stayed in for the first time. However, the room is still large and the bed is very comfortable.
Unlimited hot spring bath for two persons: It would be better if the hot spring area is not so far away from the changing room.
Welcome fruit and good night milk: Deluxe.

I chose a garden-view king-size bed room, and I could also see the scenery of Baishuizhai from a distance. The service at the front desk made you feel like you were home, very friendly~

Outdoor hot spring area
There are more than 50 hot spring pools in the three functional areas. Different pools have different effects. After soaking, you can do a sweat steam. It’s so refreshing!
Mountaintop hot spring area
There is an endless hot spring at the top, where you can enjoy the mountain view of Baishuizhai in the distance. It is backed by a small mountain and enjoys the scenery between the rocks. It is also the best place to watch the sunset. I really love it.
Chinese medicine health care area
The whole area exudes herbal fragrance, and the water temperature is about 40 degrees or more. It is really healthy to soak in it at night. The curling hot air relaxes the whole body.
Karst Cave Hot Spring Area
You can only see its light show when you go to the Karst Cave Hot Spring Area at night. The water temperature in this area is generally 37-39 degrees, which is very suitable for the elderly and children. I especially want to mention the ice and fire pool. You must try the feeling of ice and light, which is particularly refreshing!

The water in the outdoor swimming pool is a bit cold, so I didn’t dare to go in
The buffet breakfast provided by booking a room is also very good, with everything that a brand hotel should have. The products of the two restaurants are also very good, with a meal standard of 150~200 per person. If the budget is limited, the surrounding farms are not far away, and there are many activities in **.

msg:The hotel’s new 2-night package is great! I'm so lucky to be able to arrange this hot spring trip during my mother's birthday month. In 2020, due to the epidemic restrictions on travel abroad, I started to explore hotel vacations in the province. After staying at Jiahua several times, I felt that the hotel's management and services have improved, and there are new surprises every time.


Facilities: I stayed in room 1525 this time. The view is great and the swimming pool on the balcony is large and spacious. I would like to make some suggestions. Can you reconsider the thickness and material of the pillows on the bed? The short ones are too short and the tall ones are too high.

Service: The staff in the lobby and guest rooms are very friendly and greet you proactively when you meet. The response to requests such as refilling water and changing bathrobes was very quick. The staff in the breakfast restaurant still needs to be improved. As usual, the plates and forks are clattering, the enthusiasm is not enough, and they are a bit indifferent😑

Recommended experience:
1. The recently launched 2-night package is very affordable. It comes with 500 food and beverage credit and 200 yuan spa voucher. You can sign the order after consumption in the restaurant. This time I also tried ordering in the room, and the service was great. When it was delivered, It's also hot. (I divided the food and beverage quota twice and used the excess amount to make up the price difference when checking out) This part of the experience is very good and very user-friendly.
2. The constant-temperature swimming pool on the first floor of the hotel has a maximum depth of 1.4m. It is very easy to swim. Although my mother and I were the only ones swimming, the lifeguards were also watching over us throughout the whole process, which was very reassuring. Remember to wear a swimming cap. If not, you can purchase a cloth swimming cap at the pool front desk for 28 yuan.
3. There will be a live band performance in the lobby bar during dinner time, with Southeast Asian music. You can order a drink and enjoy the comfortable time while enjoying the mountain breeze.
4. The Chinese restaurant’s gold special fried rice has received 10 stars, it’s so delicious👍, give it a try.
5. I’ve complained before about the red cap of the repellent oil that the hotel puts in the bathroom, which is really difficult to open. This time I came to find that the liquid bottles were changed, which I thought was very thoughtful.

Overall, Jiahua has improved in all aspects, from services to facilities and cleanliness, it all deserves a five-star rating. Of course, there are some details that can be optimized, and I look forward to having a better experience next time.
Thank you to the front desk staff Xiaoguan who helped me check out. He is very nice, confident and generous, and his conversation is elegant.
Also, when I checked in on the 19th, the front desk receptionist (an experienced girl) made appropriate arrangements when she learned that I placed the wrong order and wanted to change the king bed to a twin bed. There was also a multi-person team from the company that day, and the lobby was noisy. Under the circumstances, they felt that I didn't like noisy and specially arranged a quiet room for me.

I decisively decided to stay another night. The experience was great. I have recommended it to my friends and will come again. The only drawback is that there is a little less food in the hot springs, but everything else is perfect

msg:The first time I arrived at the Jiahua Hotel, I was stunned by the lobby. The roof was super high, very beautiful and high-end.
Room: I booked the most common double room. After reading other reviews and pictures, I thought there was a hot spring on the balcony. I thought this room type had a hot spring pool. Who knew there was no hot spring pool in the room? I was disappointed and went to the front desk to inquire. Miss Xie Lichun at the lobby front desk was very patient in explaining to me. It was upgraded to a hot spring room because the room was full when other customers booked it. Don't be misled, this room does not have a hot spring.
The room is as in the picture, details determine success or failure, safe, disposable slippers, ordinary slippers, children's slippers, children's mouthwash cups, toothbrushes, adult and child bathrobes, umbrellas, charging cables, refrigerators, red wine glasses, boiled water utensil, bath salts (gift), Fengyou essence (gift), welcome fruit and Deluxe milk (gift), coffee tea (gift), 4 bottles of Jingtian mineral water (gift).
The curtains are automatic and very user-friendly. There is also a shower room with super high water pressure.
The check-out time was extended to two o'clock for me, which is great!
Hot springs: The hot springs are very large, with various bathing pools, and a very large baby water park suitable for summer. Dry towels are also readily available, as are various scented teas. It's just that the hot spring area is too big and it's very tiring to walk there.
But let’s make a complaint. The cabinets that can be used to store mobile phones and valuables everywhere in the hot spring area are basically broken. They don’t respond after applying hand cards. This needs to be improved.
Buffet: When I arrived at the front desk of the buffet restaurant, the lady said that the buffet was 198 + 15% service fee. I said it was not 198 on Dianping? She said that I need to make a reservation one day in advance (in fact, the 15% service charge is not much, why should I make a reservation in advance? I hope this can be improved), and then I said that the front desk in the lobby told me that the 15% service charge can be waived when booking a room, and she said that I should go in before the meal. Then I was asked to pay the full price. Later, I used the QR code that Ms. Xie Lichun sent me before to be exempted from the 15% service fee. I ate at around 7pm on January 17th. Can you ask who was in charge of the front desk of the buffet at that time? Does she really need the 15% service fee? This is so disgusting!
Meal: The ingredients are very fresh, especially the salmon, which is unlimited and thick-cut, which is worthy of the price. But your dessert cake is really unpalatable. Logically speaking, as long as the cream cheese used is good, it cannot be so bad. I hope the quality of this dessert can be improved.
The breakfast is very good, with many varieties, including egg, milk, cereal, special sausage, Zhengguo wontons, and Western and Chinese ones. Breakfast is available until 1030, so you can come back after you have had enough sleep.
I would like to praise a tall, chubby boy with curly hair in the restaurant. He works harder than anyone else and keeps putting away dishes and things. He can be seen during dinner and breakfast. I was sitting in the area next to the window inside. He was the only one who was more diligent. The other two thin boys asked him why the coffee machine was broken. When he didn't move, he said yes, it was broken, and seemed unwilling to take any notice. Finally, the coffee machine started to work again after it was restarted. He was severely criticized, and he was not serious about his work and kept chatting.
Basically, I am 90% satisfied with this trip. I am very grateful to the staff for their warm hospitality. I recommend everyone to come and play.

However, although prices here are not cheap, the price increase is not much higher than usual, so the price-performance ratio should be high.
During the Spring Festival, there are six-minute fireworks in the evening, band performances and children’s DIY activities during the day. The children are very happy and have a festive a**osphere.
The room was so big, and the waiter took the initiative to help us upgrade to a garden view room.
The facilities and equipment in the room are very detailed and considerate, and the bathroom is very large, divided into shower, toilet, bathtub and changing area.
The visual measurement of the large bed is 2.3 meters.
There is also a clothes drying rack on the balcony.
The hot spring area is large enough, with many themes and few people. It is clean.

Before leaving and checking out, the waiter gave two dolls to the children.

msg:Facilities: The facilities and equipment are relatively new.
Food: Breakfast is rich and varied.
Hot springs: There are many types of hot spring water. The infinity hot spring pool is more popular, so it is better to go during off-peak hours. The cave hot springs are not afraid of rain, especially children. Warm water is constantly supplied and towels can be changed endlessly, which is quite considerate.
Room: The scenery in the mountain view room is very comfortable. You can see the waterfall in Baishui Village and the facilities in the entire hot spring area. You can relax and relieve stress during the holiday. The room also has an independent hot spring pool, so children are not afraid of taking a dip in it. The child also said that he must come to the water park facilities in the summer. The room hygiene is also very good.
Hotel staff: Thank you to Xiao Xie at the front desk for your warm hospitality and meticulous service. Every staff member will greet guests warmly when they see them. The corridors are clean, the lobby is very clean, especially the observation deck, the scenery is first-rate, and it's very good to check in and take photos.

The details are perfect, the laundry care is from L'Occitane, and the room comes with super laundry detergent and ax mark wind oil. Although the hotel is not a so-called star-rated hotel, the service is very timely and in place, from the concierge helping to carry luggage when getting off the bus to collecting plates in time when eating in the restaurant. This is very, very important when traveling with children. The cave hot spring is also much prettier than it looks in the photos. It is a hotel that looks much better in reality than in the photos.

The only drawback is that there are not many dishes in the buffet. It happened to be the Lantern Festival and there were so many people that the food could not be served quickly.

Although I booked a basic room type, it was very large, with a balcony, and the bathroom and dressing room were very large. Picture 5 shows the welcome fruits that can be redeemed with Ctrip points, and Picture 6 shows the buffet dinner, with many varieties and products. There are indoor and outdoor hot springs. Since I didn’t bring a waterproof phone case, I didn’t take any pictures. There are many pools. There were not many people on the day we went. The weather was a bit cold, more than ten degrees Celsius, so soaking in the hot springs was very comfortable. Before leaving, the front desk also gave me a small plush doll, which the child loved very much.

Hygiene: Very clean, a five-star standard.
Environment: Backed by mountains and forests, the air is good and the scenery is beautiful. The beautiful green plants in the hotel are well maintained and beautiful. It is a good place to relax.
Service: Very good! As long as you walk in the hotel, the staff will greet you proactively and have a friendly attitude. When soaking in hot springs, staff will come to ask you if you want tea from time to time and remind guests of the time to soak in hot springs. I would especially like to praise the young lady at the front desk (because my badge is blocked by my collar, so I can’t see your name). She was the one who greeted me when I checked in and out. She had a perfect smile the whole time, she spoke nicely, and she handled the business quickly and proficiently. Quick, I was given a room upgrade. When I was checking out, I accidentally heard that today was my mother's birthday and she gave us candy.
Small opinion: I feel that the "slate bath" and "independent hot spring pool in the room" are not hot enough, so they are lukewarm. It would be better if they could be hotter.

The decoration of the room is a bit dated, but fortunately it is still clean. I recommend the nearby Baishui Village attractions. The scenery and air are great, and it is more suitable for young people to visit. The hotel's buffet dinner has too few types and the quality is really not good. I don't recommend it. I suggest going out to eat at a farmhouse. When checking out, the front desk asked me to write a five-star review with her name and give me a bag of candies. I refused and was disgusted with this kind of behavior! ! ! A pack of candies is not worth much at all, so it is better to give them generously, which will make the customers more happy and get good reviews without you having to say anything.

It is cold because the central heating is not turned on, but the front desk also provides heaters and the room is ready for 2 Zhang thick quilt is a real plus. What I am most satisfied with is the super luxurious bathroom, and I used the British royal brand Moton Brown bath series. This experience is very good! Five-star rating!
Facilities: very good
Hygiene: excellent
first rate service

msg:The cooling Guangdong is really suitable for hot springs!
After choosing for a long time, I chose Baishuizhai Hot Spring in Zengcheng, Guangzhou to spend the weekend with my little sisters [Wow R] [Wow R]
	
📍Environment: I feel that hot spring hotels are generally located in deep mountains and wild ridges. There are mountains next to them. There are several farmhouses 1km away. There is nothing to do except around the hotel. Haha, it is almost the same in the hotel.
	
The hotel is said to be 5 stars and the experience is probably 4-5⭐, but there is no heating! The heating was on but it wasn't warm. I froze to death in the morning [Petrochemical R] [Petrochemical R]
	
💒 Room: The room is very beautiful! We were also given a free upgrade to a room with an outdoor hot spring on the first floor, but no one seems to know how to use the pool. Haha, the toilet is very big and beautiful, with wet and dry separation and a small balcony for ventilation (Picture ②)
	
💁🏻♀️ Service: The service is average. However, the lady at the front desk and the security guard in the parking lot are very nice. I recommend the lady at the front desk, Xiaozhen! ! ! When we checked in, we were given a general introduction to the hotel. We were also told that we had to go in early for the buffet dinner, which we would talk about later [Laughter and Crying R] [Laughing and Crying R]
	
♨️ Hot springs: The highlight this time is the hot springs! There are outdoor and indoor hot springs open from 8:00-24:00. We took a dip in the evening and in the morning.
	
The indoor hot spring is a cave hot spring (picture ⑥). I have to say that it is colder indoors than outside [Laughter and Crying R] [Laughing and Crying R] When I went to bathe in the morning when the sun was shining and warm outside, I didn’t know if I arrived at 10 o’clock. The indoor hot spring in the morning was only 36-37 degrees which was really cold. . . Then move to the outdoors
💡It is recommended that everyone go directly to the outdoor bath in winter. If you go outdoors wet after bathing indoors, it will be really cold to death! !
The outdoor hot spring temperature is relatively high, and the hot spring temperature is at least 39 degrees Celsius to be comfortable!
	
The outdoor environment is good, with many pools and infinity hot springs where you can take photos (picture ⑥). There are also dry and wet steams.
❌But some tourists just threw their water glasses by the pool, which really looked very untidy. The cleaning lady didn’t collect them in time. I hope everyone can pay attention to hygiene [Petrochemical R]
	
🍱 Buffet: I booked the hotel’s 238 self-service hot pot + buffet in the evening (picture ⑦). The buffet has many types and the ingredients are relatively fresh! There are just too many people! At least one tour group from Hong Kong [Laughter Crying R] plus other tourists, the popular ingredients were sold out as soon as they were put on the shelves! So the front desk kept urging us to go down early [Laugh and cry R] [Laugh and cry R] However, the restaurant was replenished in a timely manner.
	
The breakfast buffet also has two restaurants to accommodate tourists, but there are many choices! (Figure ⑦)
	
📌 In summary, I am satisfied with this trip!
Recommendation index: 3.5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
✔️The hot springs and rooms are both good! If you're staying for one night, it's perfect for a couple's date or a family gathering!
❌ Disadvantages: There is no air conditioning. The sanitation next to the hot spring needs to be cleaned in time.
	
㊗️Have fun everyone! !

At the front desk, the room next door offered an upgrade without a deposit. I was asked to pay a deposit at first, but then I was told no need. That's understandable, there are so many people.

fully equipped. The hotel room is clean and tidy, the bed is comfortable, and the air conditioning and hot water supply are good. The best thing for me is that the public toilets in the hotel lobby are really clean, which is a plus.

The environment is beautiful and pleasant. The surrounding environment of the hotel is very beautiful and pleasant, with gardens, waterfalls and other landscapes, making people feel relaxed and comfortable.

The best thing about my experience is that the sanitary conditions of hotels usually gradually decline as they age. However, after I stayed at this hot spring hotel many times since 2017, I still feel that its sanitary and facilities are very good. Good, even getting better.

Also, it is approaching Chris**as, and the decoration of the hotel is also very beautiful🎍, there is a Chris**as tree🎄, and the Chris**as decorations in the breakfast area are very beautiful.

msg:I wanted to go to Zengcheng to soak in hot springs on the weekend. My friend strongly recommended Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel, and I booked two blind box rooms on Ctrip. When we checked in at the front desk of the hotel, we were greeted by Wu Mingxi, the front desk guy. The guy was very enthusiastic. When he learned that it was our first time here, he took the initiative to upgrade us to a large hot spring bed. He also explained a lot of details to us and gave us it quickly. Complete the formalities. I was very pleasantly surprised when I entered the room. The room was big, the bed was big, the bathroom had two sinks, the whole room was very cozy, and there was a hot spring pool on the balcony. Unfortunately, I was short of time and didn't have time to enjoy it. I will definitely go there again if I have the chance. .
This time I went to the hot springs and felt very comfortable. I enjoyed the cave hot springs first, and the waiters were also very enthusiastic. Special praise to my brother Wu Mingxi. I wanted to soak in the hot springs for the second time, but my bathrobe got wet the first time I soaked in the hot springs. I asked him for another bathrobe and he sent it to us very quickly. Knowing that we were short on time for the hot springs, we also They took the initiative to extend our check-out until 1 o'clock so that we could enjoy another hot spring bath comfortably. I was very satisfied with this weekend hot spring trip and will definitely enjoy it again if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:To celebrate the child's birthday, a family trip was specially arranged. After comparing many hotels, we finally chose Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Resort Hotel ~ Facts have proved that our choice was right!
      The hotel has complete facilities, a high-end and comfortable environment, and considerate service. We were also lucky enough to meet the considerate housekeeper Jiaxin, who upgraded us to a room with a better view, arranged a birthday cake for our children, and properly arranged the food, clothing, housing, transportation, and check-out during our stay. We also provided suggestions for surrounding tours when we checked in~~ It felt like home~
      I was really satisfied with the room I stayed in. The angle of the balcony is just right so that I can directly enjoy the view of Baishuizhai Waterfall. The room is spacious and the pool and bathtub are really great! The hotel is also thoughtfully equipped with special dental kits, slippers, and bathrobes for children ~ as well as welcome fruits and good night milk ~ must like it!
      The hot spring water quality is also good, and there are many pools. There are indoor cave hot springs, outdoor Chinese medicine bathing pools, and infinity swimming pools. Although I stayed on a weekend and the room occupancy rate was relatively high, I didn't feel crowded at all when I took a bath. After soaking in the hot spring, my skin is smooth and wrinkle-free. It is indeed a certified high-quality and rare hot spring! ! During the bathing period, staff will provide tea, towels and directions for bathing from time to time~
      For dinner and breakfast during our stay, we chose the buffet at the hotel's Fengjing Western Restaurant. It has a rich variety and good products. The children's favorites are indeed popcorn and candies. We are lucky to have good weather and the scenery on the terrace is first-rate. ~It makes people forget the hustle and bustle and worries, and give the body and soul a vacation...
      As a popular parent-child hotel in Guangzhou, there are also a lot of entertainment options for children, including wave pools, parent-child crafts, children's shops, children's splash areas, small trains... There are a lot of activities, which is very suitable for walking children on vacation ~
      During this trip, everyone from elders to children praised the Jiahua Hotel! I am very much looking forward to my next stay~~I look forward to meeting Jiaxin Butler~~

Li Lizhen (the same name of the Hong Kong star 😍) at the front desk upgraded the room type 👍 The hotel level is the best in the entire Paitan Hot Spring area It is definitely first-class. The staff I met along the way greeted me very warmly. The hot spring water is changed basically every day, and the water is crystal clear. Maybe it's because I stayed on a non-weekend, but the breakfast was very rich and not crowded. It’s worth coming back to decompress next time.

msg:Super! We spent so much joyful time here. Baishuizhai Jiahua has become a regular part of our annual travel and leisure program. Since the COVID-19 era, we have visited Jiahua at least twice a year. I also tried it in Huizhou. This time I planned to experience Jiahua in Nankunshan, but it was a bit laborious for my husband and I, so we decided to stay nearby. 🎈🎉
First of all, Jiahua’s is an authentic spring soup, which is very important. Some hot spring hotels with high prices around are fake hot springs. You can tell by looking at whether the skin of your fingers and toes has wrinkled after soaking for a long time, and whether it is really soothing to your tired muscles. I like that the colleagues here are very attentive to the management and maintenance. The items are new, beautiful and very clean, both inside the hotel and in the park. I saw the internal magazine "The Voice of Jiahua" on my desk. It said that Jiahua arranges employees to "clean the road" once a month for active study. No wonder they can clean it spotlessly. Every hotel employee took the initiative to smile and say hello when they saw us. In addition, Jiahua’s buffet breakfast and other catering products are also a major factor that attracts us. They are super delicious. Several times, my husband said that he would go to the nearby Zengcheng specialty food stalls, and finally went to Jiahua’s Chinese restaurant for dinner. Since I have stopped eating meat, I order the special black bean tofu every time. It should be the tofu polished by the hotel itself. It melts in your mouth. In addition, the original leafy vegetables in Zengcheng are quite delicious, which is enough to satisfy me. I hope that a special vegetarian section can be opened in catering to be in line with international standards (many four-star or above hotels in major foreign cities will have vegetarian sections), so that I can recommend vegetarian friends to come and experience it. 😀😀

In addition to bathing in the hot springs, the green grass in the park and the green scenery of Baishui Village outside are also unique. I saw the Big Dipper at night in the first half of the year. This time I woke up early in the morning and finally took a photo of the sunrise🌅. lucky~v~~
To travel environmentally, we brought our own toothbrushes and toothpaste. Only with clear waters and green mountains can there be mountains of gold and silver.

Things that need to be improved are as follows: 1) The coffee and tea bags are a little less and not very high-end, which is more ordinary. 2) The fruit plate is much more ordinary than before. As a Guangzhou veteran, I have always felt that Guangzhou’s hoteliers should learn more from outside the province, especially Jiahua hotels with certain star ratings. In cities such as Yunnan, Sichuan, and even Changsha, which has recently become an Internet celebrity, hotel services are very good. In the evening, they will provide warm sugar water or relatively fresh and sweet fruits + cookies. I hope that we will continue to strive for perfection. By the way, the bottle of body wash and shampoo has been upgraded this time, which is great. I left a message last year about the outer packaging. The old model did not match the overall quality of Jiahua.

The hot springs are divided into several areas and are very large. There are two children's water parks for children, which children like very much. Cave hot springs are quite special.
Disadvantages: The aromatherapy in the lobby is too strong, I wish it could be lighter. Put an extra trash can in the room for other garbage, not just recyclables. The buffet can be set up in two stalls. The high-end one has half a lobster and the like. If it is not free, you should at least be able to buy it.

The room is well maintained and very big. It has a balcony where you can sit out and relax. The private pool is also on the balcony. It is clean and has a massage function.
The only flaw in the room is that there is mold in some corners of the toilet shower area. It should be renovated a little better, but the hot water flow is fast and stable, which is good.
There are many different types of pools in the hot spring area, and you won't have to worry about the crowds in each one. Because the stay is on a weekday, there are not many people. It is so comfortable to soak in. I will go there again~
The service in the hot spring area is very good. Different health teas and hot and cold water are provided everywhere. From time to time, employees will bring hot tea to guests to remind them not to soak too much.
The water park has staff who are looking after it, and no one is allowed to play in the children's facilities. This is worthy of praise.
The breakfast buffet has many varieties, and you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful scenery, but the dinner buffet has fewer varieties. I won’t eat it again next time I go there, but the Chinese restaurant’s food is really good, so I recommend it;
The location of the hotel is relatively remote and the air is good. However, the transportation to the hotel from Zhuhai is really inconvenient. It would be much better if you drive by yourself.

Hygiene: There is basically no problem with the details of the room. Because I am a bit of a germaphobe, I was surprised that the room is made of wood grain tiles, not carpets or ordinary wooden floors.
Environment: The hotel's circulation settings are very reasonable and comfortable. They have paid attention to this aspect. Everything from the parking lot to the lobby to the room to the play area is very smooth.
Service: Most of the waiters are young. Maybe this aspect needs to be improved. Overall, it is good.
Another thing that needs to be improved is the attitude of the waiters in the lobby bar. In addition, the catering service in five-star hotels is subject to an additional 15% charge. It should be better. The aroma or perfume in the lobby is a bit strong. If you change it to an elegant perfume, it will be more consistent. The tone of the hotel

The Chinese restaurant in the hotel produced unexpectedly delicious food, and I wanted to eat there again after three meals. Children love water sports and there are enough hot springs. I especially recommend the hot spring area on the top of the mountain, which has beautiful scenery. When there are many people at breakfast, you may not be able to find a seat. It is recommended that the hotel strengthen management and arrange a unified queue to enter.

I was afraid that the room would be different than expected, but I was very lucky to meet Wu Mingxi at the front desk ~ the service was considerate! They introduced the layout of the hotel and helped me upgrade to a mountain view room. I was really satisfied after I checked in. The hotel is also very suitable for walking kids! Everyone must look for Xiao Wu next time, you will definitely not be disappointed haha.

msg:Coming to Jiahua for the summer vacation may become a family-reserved item, after all, the children are already pinching their fingers and counting that they can still play the 10-year-old slide (only under the age of 18)😹.
The big slide and the mountaintop hot spring slide were newly added and opened this year. They were not opened during the summer vacation last year. It may be due to the epidemic. I hope that there will be new surprises every year when I come to Jiahua.
Still the same sentence: Jiahua is suitable for a family to vacation, everyone has their own joys, it will not be too crowded, and it will not be too deserted, everything is just right.
I would like to thank Xiao Wu who checked in at the front desk. In order to improve our check-in experience, he took the initiative to upgrade the room type, carefully introduced the hotel facilities, and check-in matters. In addition, no matter when you are in any corner of the hotel, as long as you meet Jiahua staff, you can get a face-to-face. "Hello, good morning, good evening" with a smile. This is a particularly good place to stay this time. It's like going home for vacation. I hope to keep it up and come to Jiahua next year for vacation~
I would like to make a suggestion. I hope that the shape and color of the water cups in the western restaurant can be richer. Whether it is drinking juice, tea, coffee, milk, or water, they are all the same dark blue porcelain cups. The outside and inside are dark blue. People have no appetite, it feels like a fast food restaurant...

Li Yuanli was the one who arranged the room for the hotel stay this time. The little girl was very friendly and helpful. Although there were some small episodes, she helped me change the room very smoothly.
We came on Saturday and spent the afternoon soaking in the outdoor hot springs and playing in the water. Because the weather is relatively hot, I didn't have much hot springs. The service staff at the hot spring♨️wanghongchi very enthusiastically helped my son get slippers of his size, very attentive. 👍👍👍The children prefer the water park. They basically spend the afternoon in the water park. There is an outdoor swimming pool next to the water park. (If you go to the pool, you need to prepare a swimming cap in advance, but there are also some on-site for sale.) The child said The activity in the water park is for Zhiyong to break through the barriers. Except for the slide, I didn't play, and I played everything else.
Because I was playing with my children in the afternoon, I planned to soak in the traditional Chinese medicine pool the next morning, but it happened to be raining heavily, so I soaked in the Rongdong for a while. The children in the Rongdong like to play in the big pool, which is just right for raindrops Come down, the water temperature is not that high! There are also some small organs inside, which can spray water out. The bubble pool is also very popular, bubbling 🫧.
We checked out the smaller ones under the rain. When we checked out, the front desk gave the children a small gift 🎁, which was shared by both children. ! 🫶
I didn't soak in the Chinese medicine pool this time, and I will come again when the weather is cooler!

It looks very high-end. Although the swimming lane is not very long, it is quite fun to support the glass boat. 😊 Overall, the environment is really top-notch. The only thing that did not meet expectations is that there is no air conditioning in the lobby 😂The volume of the live singing in the lobby bar needs to be turned down.

msg:During the summer vacation, several mothers took their children to the water park. They couldn't have enough fun, so they found a nearby five-star hotel and booked a room. As soon as we entered the parking lot, we felt that it was high-end. There were performances in the lobby. We were the first to take a look. We only booked a room because this hotel has a water park, and there is a cave hot spring, which we found new. Overall, I thought it was pretty good. There are also a variety of different hot spring pools in the hot spring area. The children had a lot of fun, and several of them even rowed together! The only fly in the oin**ent was that when I woke up early in the morning and turned on the light, I discovered that there was an eight-legged animal on the quilt right in front of the child. Fortunately, it was only about three centimeters in size, because the child was so scared that he wanted to cry, and he was also afraid that the insects would crawl to nowhere. I hurriedly took a tissue and strangled it to death. In fact, I was shaking. I forgot to tell the hotel staff about this when I checked out. I hope the hotel will pay attention to hygiene in the future. But overall it’s pretty good!

The roasted chicken and steamed fish in the Chinese restaurant are both great, real ingredients, and the heat is just right.

msg:It was the first time I stayed in Jiahua for two nights. I originally booked a parent-child hot spring room of 2580. Later, I upgraded the swimming lane parent-child room to +500. At noon, the public swimming pool is very sunny, and the swimming lane in the room will not be exposed to the sun. The only dissatisfaction is the swimming lane. There are many small insects in the water, frogs, butterflies, ants... It is estimated that there is no water filtration with swimming lanes. Is it because the occupancy rate is too low? But on Monday morning, the filter was turned on, and it was obvious that the water was flowing, and the water quality was very clean. I didn’t eat out for three days and two nights. I ate at the hotel. The Chinese restaurant tasted average and the price was high. I ate at the buffet in the western restaurant for two nights. There were really few dishes. Alaskan long-legged crabs are only available on weekdays, maybe on Saturdays and Sundays There are too many people. What I appreciate most in this buffet is fried rice. Hahaha, that’s right. Zengcheng silk seedling rice is crispy and has distinct grains. After eating so many buffets, I never eat rice. I actually incite the whole family to eat fried rice. Everyone said it was delicious! There are unlimited hot springs in the room, and you can watch a 4-minute firework show on the open-air balcony in the lobby at 8 pm during the summer vacation. The location is just right.

Children's toiletries are also specially prepared, which is very considerate. There is a cloakroom, which is more convenient for storing all kinds of clothes. There is a bathtub and a shower room, which is suitable for families with children. The sanitation is very good, which is rare in resort hotels.
There are many humanized designs in the room, which are reasonable and comfortable. The hotel should also have all the supporting facilities, including a hot spring area, swimming pool, children's play area (both for children and older children), and a small train for children to take sightseeing at night, which children like. A place that will be considered for the next trip.

The details of the room are not bad. There are refreshing oils and sealed bags for wet clothes. At first, I was very happy that there was a charging cable, but it didn’t work. I ended up using my own. It would be better if I can check it carefully and replace it with a new one if it’s broken. La!

msg:The first time I bought a buffet in the evening, I was very disappointed and regretted not ordering a meal. Before 7 o'clock, the place was basically sold out, and the dishes were not served. The salmon was not fresh, and there were mosquitoes stuck to the fish meat, and the crab claws were smelly. The watermelon had been oxidized for a long time, and I couldn't eat enough, let alone eat well. This time I really paid for my trouble

msg:Environment: Shortly after getting off the expressway, the road condition is good and there are enough parking spaces. The lobby of the hotel is magnificent, spacious and bright, with stylish decoration. It has a wide view and is full of greenery. Coupled with the live performances in the Philippines, the a**osphere is full.

Serve:
There are many waiters in the lobby for service and guidance. Sister Yan Xiao at the check-in front desk is pretty and friendly. The attitude is nice and cute, I like her very much, and she took the initiative to upgrade the room type to the mountain view, and even gave the child a cute doll. The service personnel of each facility have a good attitude and smiles, and it can be seen that they have been well trained. Room service was also responsive when requested. You can help to make the bed to 2.4 meters, and sleep very comfortably.

Facilities: Although the hotel has been open for a certain period of time, the management and maintenance are in place, and the rooms and public areas are very clean and tidy. Especially the guest room is my favorite design style and tonality. It is very spacious and the functional area design is very reasonable. The whole room is just two words: comfortable! I don't even want to check out when I live in it. And the personal items are prepared very thoughtfully, there are welcome fruits and milk, children's toiletries and bathrobes. Tea and coffee are also good, and there is a place to dry clothes on the balcony. The bathroom is super big, this is my favorite, the toiletries are complete, and bath salts are also prepared.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good and in place, the whole room is clean, tidy and refreshing, and the public area is also very good, there are no dead spots.

Breakfast: Rich with regional characteristics, there are Chinese and Western buffet breakfasts such as beef offal, rice rolls, etc., which is very satisfying and full.

Unlimited water park for two people: It would be more perfect if the ring-shaped swimming lanes can be played for free, and children's water facilities can arrange some facilities suitable for older children.

Unlimited hot springs for two: There are indoor and outdoor hot springs, as well as alpine infinity hot spring pools. There are many and rich pools. Very satisfied!

Overall, it was a very value-for-money and pleasant experience, and I will come again next time. I hope the hotel will continue to maintain the standard and service quality! Like 👍 Give the hotel staff and management a thumbs up 👍

msg:Although the Dragon Boat Festival is only a 3-day holiday, I still wanted to go out for a walk. I was entangled whether to go to the Internet-famous Seaview B&B or this hot spring hotel. In the end, I booked Jiahua because I felt that the star hotel was trustworthy. The road here was a bit difficult, and there was a sudden heavy rainstorm, and the risk factor of driving the vehicle was 5 stars. When I came to the hotel, I felt worthy of my hard journey. As soon as I came in, every staff member greeted me warmly. The environment in the lobby is gorgeous, and at the same time, I was holding my own Dragon Boat Festival activities.
        When I checked in, I thanked the little girl who received me at the front desk. She upgraded us to a garden view hot spring double bed room for free, and patiently asked us if we had a request for the room. Knowing that we like high floors, we directly arranged the highest room for us. Floor, we also delayed our check-out until 2 pm the next day, which is really considerate! When we entered the room, the room was very large and we could see the mountain view. It was very pleasing to the eyes when it was raining and the clouds and mist filled the mountains.
       When we checked out the next day, the little sister Xie at the front desk asked us if our stay was comfortable, and at the same time gave us a beautiful gift.
       But I feel that there are not many hot springs, maybe because there are many places surrounded and redecorated. Dinner is eaten at a farm restaurant outside. The hotel's western restaurant is not too big, and the breakfast variety is okay. In general, next time I have the opportunity to travel here, I will still choose Jiahua.

Service: The service is good and trustworthy. I went to Xiao Wubang at the front desk of the hotel to check in. He introduced the hotel facilities and equipment in a simple, quick and careful way, and upgraded the room with indoor hot spring for free. The children go to the hotel's hot spring in the morning and play in the evening. I like to take a bath in the room. I didn’t buy the hotel’s buffet dinner at first, but Xiao Wu introduced that the hotel has a different themed buffet dinner every day, so I tried it. The buffet is very rich. After eating it once, the children didn’t want to go out of the hotel to eat farm food outside. The next day Went there again, checked out and gave gifts to the children. Next time I come to play, I will continue to book Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel. (The combined check-in and check-out time is less than 5 minutes. This hotel has good training 👍 is worthy of praise)

Because I booked a water-friendly room on the first floor, I don't know what the smell is after entering the room. It may be killing mosquitoes. There are many dead mosquitoes on the bed. I told the staff on the floor that they replaced us with a whole set of new ones very quickly, which is commendable! The environment is also very quiet, and the price/performance ratio is still very good! Recommended!

1. The room design and supplies are thoughtful, equipped with children's toiletries, suitable for traveling with children, refrigerator drinks and welcome fruits are free, and the products are very good.
2. The service in the lobby and the dining bar and Chinese restaurant are commendable. The room service basically responds in a timely manner. Although the restaurant has a few dishes, the taste and service are good. Lobster soup with rice and roast chicken are especially recommended.
3. Route design: The room can directly lead to the hot spring, which is quite convenient. It is possible to travel at the wrong peak, and there are not too many people, so it feels good
shortcoming
The price/performance ratio of the buffet is too low, the service attitude is poor, the variety of meals is small, and the replenishment is slow, especially: the dinner seat is responsible for cooking the cooked food, especially the waitress who fried the steak has a very bad attitude, ignoring the customer's request and throwing her temper.
Suggestions: 1. The room can be directly connected to the waterway of the swimming pool. If the balcony door is also designed to be locked with a wristband, the sense of security will be better.
2. The quilt cabinet in the cloakroom of the guest room is 2 meters high, which is inconvenient to carry. The design can be reconsidered

msg:First of all, when we entered the hotel lobby, the waiters had no active awareness. My husband and I were confused for about a minute before a lady with a bright smile guided us to the front desk (it was the same lady when we checked out, and I didn’t remember her name). When I checked in, I upgraded to a garden-view double room. Thanks to Zhenzhen for her service, she explained clearly and politely. There are really very, very few cooked food options for the buffet dinner! Not very friendly to children and elders, hope to improve! The waiters in the restaurant are very diligent, and the Danish pastries for breakfast are of a high standard, I like it! The hot spring area is said to be open until 24:00 in the evening, but at 22:30, there is basically no service at all except for the entrance and exit, and the swimming pool has also been closed. The experience is not very good. Based on this situation, I went again in the morning. The hot spring area is not bad, the passage out of the karst hot spring has a peculiar smell...My husband and I went to the waterway in Figure 2, but that waterway can only be rented for kayaks, and the price is too high...It starts at 50 yuan for 20 minutes. Generally speaking, compared with the nearby hot spring hotels with similar prices, Jiahua did not attract me to come again.

msg:14/4 This is the first time I stayed in Jiahua, the price is very high 🫶🏻! First of all, as soon as we arrived at the hotel, before we got out of the car, there was a dedicated security guard at the door who had already saluted us🫡 In addition, we especially praised the manager Chen Yinghao for his enthusiasm for service, and offered to help us upgrade the room!

The evening buffet and breakfast were much better than expected, and the weather is starting to warm up, so there are fewer people, and the dip is so comfortable! I appreciate its indoor karst hot spring the most, it has such an a**osphere!
The environmental greening is well done, the room is large, the bathtub is large, there are complimentary fruits, four bottles of water and two packs of milk. Slippers are provided in the room! Don’t be afraid to forget to bring it~ and the most important thing is that the cleaning is in place~ even the toilet in the lobby is super clean!
There are many children's facilities in the hotel. There are VR games in the lobby, which cost 38 and 58~ Children have fun. In addition, there is a children's playground, which charges 30 for a single time and 50 for two consecutive days! There are children's high trucks outside to play ~ charge 50 / 10 minutes!
It is a pity that the children's pool is not open this time, the children are a little disappointed, and look forward to coming again next time!
I stayed in three hotels during this trip to Guangzhou, and Jiahua's service is the best. I will recommend my friends to come again.

This is the first time I came to this hotel in Zengcheng, and I brought two little boys. In order to make it easier for us to share two rooms, we upgraded them when we arrived at the store. The room is very large, with a separate soaking pool with massage on the balcony, and a large bathtub for two in the bathroom. You can also overlook Baishuizhai Waterfall. It’s very sunny in the afternoon, just soak in the soup in the room, look at Baishui Village, and go to the soup after the buffet dinner, it’s so comfortable!
The cave hot springs are very distinctive, and the hotel also has a cave-style swimming lane where you can play paddle boards. In addition, the soup pool area and swimming pool are really big. Although there are many people on weekends, they don't look crowded at all.
On the first day I came here, I found an internet celebrity restaurant for lunch, and when I left, I went to the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. I decided that the hotel was even better〣( ºΔº )〣I knew I wouldn’t bother to go out and get sunburnt.
Brother Wu Mingxi at the front desk is very considerate of the guests and very enthusiastic. I like it! Of course, every staff member encountered was friendly and offered to help! The best choice for summer vacation!

Service: The hotel gate guards are polite. The security guards and doormen in the hotel lobby are warm and polite. They will take the initiative to find a parking space for you, and even open the door to take care of the elderly and children.

Breakfast: The food quality is quite satisfactory, and the restaurant environment is elegant.


Unlimited hot springs for two people: The physical condition is not bad, but there are some unscrupulous guests who behaved uncivilized, which affects the mood of traveling a bit.

Especially the swimming pool, there are a lot of fallen leaves, you should pay attention to hygiene.

The hotel staff are still very polite, and they will warmly greet each other when they come in and out.

The living environment is okay, not noisy, the sound insulation is okay, and the sanitation and services are okay . There is basically no fun for children. The room fee of several thousand yuan is pitifully few and the facilities are pitiful, and a few of them have to be charged. The feeling of staying in a B&B is similar. By the way, Chimelong's Penguin Hotel buffet is very good, with many choices and delicious food.
Make a suggestion, the hotel does not have a shuttle bus to Baishuizhai. This is very incomprehensible. Just imagine, why should I go to live in a hotel there? Is it for the hot spring? Is it to play with the children's facilities in the hotel? No, just because there is a Baishui Village, what should you do if you let foreign tourists not travel by car? It's not easy to take a taxi, I don't understand.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at the Royal Hotel. The hotel room is elegant and tidy, and the bathroom is super large. In addition to the bathtub, the garden view room also has a small yard with its own bubble pool. The hotel's cave hot spring is also very interesting. I thought it was small according to the previous evaluation, but it turned out to be very big. There are two cave hot springs and an infinity pool on the top of the mountain. The water is also very warm. The weather is still a bit cold today, it's a pity that I didn't enjoy the children's paddling pool and swimming lanes. The half-price breakfast for children over 1.5 is only 68 yuan, which is very cost-effective and relatively rich. The fruits are delicious and sweet, and the dining environment is very beautiful. The children had a great time, and it is worth a family trip for parents and children. The hotel is a 10-minute drive from the Baishuizhai Scenic Area. After checking out, I went to climb the mountain. There is a lake at the foot of the Baishuizhai Mountain with a green road around the lake. Going back, there is a water park not far from the hotel. The surrounding environment is very good. Looking forward to the next trip.

The hotel is located in a beautiful environment with perfect facilities. The room is large and comfortable and quiet. Soaking in the hot spring at night is especially refreshing. Afterwards, it will be very fragrant to sleep. Suguo is a big bed room with a bed width of 2.4 meters, which is quite refreshing. A day or two away from the hustle and bustle of the city can be relaxing.
Although the weather has stopped raining recently, it is still a bit gloomy, but the service from Mr. Chen Yinghao at the front desk is very good, and the mood suddenly rises again. He even arranged a room with a good view for us. As good as ever, all hot spring pools are still open, which is too friendly for people like me who like to change various pools. Next time you are free, you must continue to come!

msg:It was the first time I stayed at the Regal Hotel. On Friday, a family of three bought a package that included two breakfasts and two nights.
In terms of facilities, more wood is used, and hot springs or recreational areas are okay.
In terms of sanitation, the sanitation in the room is well done. There is no dust on the head of the bed, so you don't have to worry about the baby playing on the bed.
In terms of environment, the overall degree of greening is high, and it is very good to take a walk or soak in hot springs.
In terms of service, this is beyond our imagination. I have stayed in many other hotels of the same level before, and none of them have such good service. We also have fruit delivered at the Chinese restaurant, and there is also fruit milk in the room, and the fruit is also very fresh. There are not many people at the dinner buffet, but there are more people at breakfast. A new dining area has been opened, and the service and cleaning speed is very fast. It is not bad that guests will not pile up too much garbage on the table during the meal.
The room is also equipped with a charging cable. Although it is not used, the small details are in place as a whole. We soaked in the hot springs twice, once in the afternoon of the first day and once in the morning of the second day, both of which felt good, and some of them had no time to soak, and the wave pool for children was very good.
Next time, I will bring my parents and the family dog together, and I will also recommend friends.

Whether it has been in the lobby, guest rooms or hot spring area for many years, the facilities and green environment are well maintained. The hotel staff greet each other with smiles and take the initiative to say hello; the rooms are large and the bedding is comfortable The bathing water is very large; the hot spring area is divided into open-air health pools and karst cave soup pools. There are many pools, which are very clean. The outdoor hot springs are covered by pavilions, so you don’t have to worry about the sun or rain; The chicken skin is crispy and the meat is smooth, not the kind of burnt dry, recommended! Finally, I would like to thank the beautiful woman in a light blue suit and gold-rimmed glasses at the front desk for upgrading the mountain view room for us for free. It just overlooks the Baishuizhai Waterfall. The time is leisurely and leisurely soaking in the hot spring again, which makes this journey perfect. The entire spa area is handicapped accessible, which is a bonus. A little suggestion: the road signs in the hot spring area are not clear enough, and every time you reach a fork in the road, you don't know where to go without a sign.

It is recommended to choose less More of this temperature is more popular with female friends. Because I need an extra large towel, I gave it to the main telephone station, but it didn't arrive after waiting for more than half an hour. I rushed to the hot spring and called the front desk again after the bath. The service staff took about 15-20 minutes. I don't know why, and I hope it can be improved.
All in all, I am very satisfied with my vacation at Regal Hotel this time, and I will choose and recommend friends to come if I want to soak in the hot springs again!

Nearly sixty pools in hot springs
Peak hot springs, cave hot springs, and traditional Chinese medicine hot springs are all worth soaking in
The room is 70 square meters, atmospheric, with a little luxury decoration
I have basically been to the hot spring hotels near Zengcheng
This kind of weather is very comfortable after soaking in the hot spring
The price of going on the third day of the ***** New Year is more than double that of going on weekdays

Thanks to the front desk for upgrading the room with us for free. You can soak in the hot springs in the room. There are also many hot spring pools outside, such as cave pools and mountain top pools. I have tried all the traditional Chinese medicine pools, and they are very cool. Children like the children's play pool the most. Although the water is a bit cold, the children have fun playing. I like the outdoor pool the most. It is very big, but the water is a bit cold, and few people dare Go down, so I go down to swim basically for a special event, in fact, it will not be cold after swimming for a while. The hotel is built on the mountain, facing the Baishuizhai Waterfall. The scenery is first-class, and the overall service is also very good. It is worthy of being one of the best hot spring hotels in Zengcheng.

The next day I went to Baishui Village. The four- and five-year-old children climbed faster than adults. Almost all the way was covered by trees, so they wouldn't get sunburned very much. The rest of the time I spend the rest of the time playing in the hotel: water park, swimming pool, hot spring, and I will not get tired of playing for three days in a row. There is a go-kart at the entrance of the hotel, which can be played by people over four years old. It is also extremely comfortable to cycle around the hotel greenway in the morning. In terms of eating, we recommend Chinese restaurants. There must be one meal here every day, and the products are also good. Will go to this hotel next time, it's worth going.

The room is very good, the area is relatively large, so the comfort is relatively strong. The landscape is also good, you can see the pool area and the Baishui Village in the distance. The room has a bathtub and a hot spring pool.
The characteristic of the hot spring area should be the hot spring in the cave, but I feel that the air in the hot spring in the cave is not very good. The hot spring area on the top of the mountain will be more comfortable, but there are fewer pools. The traditional Chinese medicine hot spring area is a bit more than the pool. So the hot spring is quite satisfactory.
The buffet breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the dinner is eaten in a Chinese restaurant, the taste is not bad, and the price is not expensive

msg:I originally wanted to book Forest Sea, but I couldn't. When I saw this, the ratings were high, but the comments were a bit divided. I said it was good, and there were some bad ones, but the overall was good, so I tried it
From Guangzhou, it is farther than the forest sea, but the road built by the hotel is easy to walk. It feels very a**ospheric when you come in, which is similar to that of Crowne Plaza Hailing Island. The mountain is very magnificent (on the map, it is the other side of Baishanzhai/Stone Park)
I specially took a day off to avoid the peak. It was less crowded and more comfortable. Xiao Luo at the front desk helped us upgrade the garden view room. The room can see the mountain (picture 5), which is very comfortable.

The hotel has a self-service Starbucks, which is simple and easy to operate. The price is about the same. I got a cup of coconut coffee, which costs 29 yuan (I thought it was free at first), which is similar to the taste of the store.
The hotel program is very rich. When we went there, there was a performance in the lobby. We listened to the mezzo-soprano Cantonese song, which was nice.

When booking a room, I was entangled, whether to add 300 plus a hot spring, a wise decision. There are many public hot spring pools in the hotel, but it is more refreshing to take a dip in the private pool. It is even more refreshing to take a dip after swimming.
The room is very big, there is a cloakroom, and the bathroom, toilet and cloakroom are all together. It would be better if a frosted sticker was added to the toilet door and the shower door to increase the utilization rate.
The bed is a bit small, 1.2 meters can barely sleep an adult and a kindergarten child

The hotel breakfast is delicious! ! ! It's worth the money
With so many hotels, this coffee is by far the best (better than Starbucks in my opinion), so I drank 2.
The fried dough sticks are delicious, the waffles are also good, and the rice rolls have to queue up, which is a bit like the rice rolls in Zhanjiang, Shantou (the ones in Yonghan, Nankunshan are better)
There are also many dim sum soup, noodle porridge, and even stir-fry dishes.
Sitting on the balcony by the door, the air-conditioning running out of the door, the fan above the head, the scenery in the distance, first-class
I went to eat at 8:30 on Monday and there were still a few seats. It would be hard to find after ten minutes late, and there would be another seat at 9:30.

For lunch and dinner, we all drove out to eat (picture 7). The hot spring hotel recommended many people but there were also many people who ate, so they even had to get a number. I went to the Hakka people's house (Picture 8, the bamboo tube rice is delicious) and Junji (Picture 9, both are delicious~), Junji is delicious. Zengcheng people are real, the dishes are big and not expensive

There are bicycle rides, the hotel guy gave me one free one (two-person car gave me a single car), there are many slopes, the road is short, and it is relatively general. not very romantic

On the whole, it is very good. It is very good near Baishui Village. It is cheaper than the forest sea. There are hot springs and the scenery is good. The service is not as bad as the reviews say. help to upgrade

There are also some dragon fruit picking near the hotel, I didn't try it
Two days and one night is still not enough, three days and two nights would be better

The field of vision is very broad and refreshing. The room is big and the service is very polite. It can be seen that the management of the hotel is in place. For me who likes to stay in big-name hotels, this hotel is a surprise. When I checked out, I gave a cute doll 🧸, the only thing I think about the hotel's swimming pool A little small, there are not many things to play in summer, and the hot spring in the cave is quite cool

msg:Finally got a chance to pull the grass in Baishui Village Jiahua 😁 It has been planted for a long time before!
Room decoration: Although it is a bit old, it can be seen that it is made of five-star standard materials; the room is very large, especially the bathroom, with a cloakroom
Hygiene: Overall ok, but flawed, hair in the shower, stains on the teacup.
The service was excellent. Xiao Yuan at the front desk immediately upgraded the room when he saw that we were bringing the children. The mountain view room has a really good view. You can see the Baishui Village. Above, it will be a bit noisy in the morning, but it will be cleared at 10 o'clock in the evening, which is really a plus! We checked in at around 2 o'clock. There were many people. The waiting time was about half an hour. During the period, the waiter served tea and there were performances in the lobby. It could be seen that the hotel has tried its best to reduce the discomfort of the guests.
Parent-child facilities: The room is equipped with children's toothbrushes, slippers, and bath towels; the children's playground is not big, so there is a charge, 50 yuan before check-out is unlimited, and the advantage of the charge is that there are fewer people 😁
Hot springs: There are many hot spring pools, and they are clean. The landscape of the infinity hot spring pool is really good.
Swimming pool: Two big and two small, clean, and there are more people in the children's pool.
Breakfast: There are many seats in the restaurant, and the waiting time for the peak meal at 9:30 is about 15 minutes, which is acceptable. It is recommended that the restaurant during the peak meal can help you with a seat; there are many types of dishes, and the replenishment speed is acceptable.
Others: There are many people during holidays, especially children, but the hot spring pool will not feel crowded; instant noodles in specialty shops are really expensive😂
Overall feeling: In addition to being expensive, there is nothing wrong with it, and I will consider a second brush.

A small suggestion is to open a normal room if it is for hot springs. The hot spring room is a bit of a waste (Personal suggestion), the buffet at the hotel is also very rich at night, which is worth the money. Those who want to eat dinner must book a seat in advance! Otherwise, even if you buy a dinner ticket, you will have to wait there until someone else has finished eating before you can go! Dinner is from 6:30 to 9:30. We didn&#39;t make a reservation in advance and went there at 6:40. Most of the seats have been reserved. There is a lot of nonsense. All in all, remember to reserve a seat in advance for dinner! ~ A very good experience! It&#39;s just that I only stayed for one night in a hurry this time. Next time I go, I will have to stay for at least two days to satisfy me!

msg:Overall satisfied, the biggest drawback is that the price is a bit expensive during holidays, haha~ The front desk helped us upgrade the supreme mountain view hot spring room. On the highest 7th floor, the floor-to-ceiling windows facing the mountain view are very comfortable, and the last check-out was delayed until 1 o'clock, very happy~

1 point deduction for service is due to long queues for check-in & catering. Many guests do not know that they need all adult face recognition. They delay time by calling friends at the front desk. One of the guests has been doing it for at least 10 minutes. In fact, you can put a reminder to let Everyone called Qi people to come over in advance~ As for the cost-effective food and beverages, there are still many dishes that are not available…

Forest Sea, Jiahua, Sanying, should be three relatively large hotels in Baishui Village, I have stayed in them, the following is for reference of tangled children's shoes, haha~
​
​Forest Sea’s rooms and activity facilities are definitely the best and most abundant; Jiahua’s room is comparable to Forest Sea (slightly inferior but also very comfortable), and hot spring swimming and other activity facilities are similar to Sanying’s; Sanying’s room is just Slightly outdated. The quality ranking of the three companies is consistent with their price ranking [Breaking tears]

Enter a section of the village road and then arrive at the hotel gate. Special reminder to friends who want to go, regardless of the car when entering the guard booth. How many people must be mentally prepared, different epidemic registration policies, several registration procedures, and enough to serve, and then go to the front desk and fill out forms and other procedures, and this is the first time I have seen it here. No matter how old a child is, everyone has to register and take pictures, which is the first time I have seen it in decades. But the security uncle and the front desk sister are very polite, which can comfort your temper a little. The four-digit room fake money does not include buffet dinner is indeed a bit expensive, after all, off-season and on weekdays. The beauty at the front desk automatically helped to upgrade the room. Thank you. The next morning when I saw the children's park, I asked her to send the experience coupons. The children's park in the hotel is quite big. The edge restaurant is really good, the white cut chicken is so beautiful). The children had a good time in the park, thanks to the lady at the front desk. It is recommended to install a guardrail for this piece of glass in the room, which feels safer. After all, many people take children to play. I hope your hotel will consider it carefully. The attitude of the waiter is also better, the delivery of items is also more timely, and the hot spring water is very good. It should be a natural resource, and the breakfast is generally produced. Overall, the experience is still good. I hope to do better in the future.

There are only six types of pastries for afternoon tea, (there is no fruit tower, and there is nothing else I forgot,), anyway, I counted 6 types. There should be 8 in my order!
The infinity hot spring pool has a panoramic view of fireworks, which is very beautiful and I like it very much;
The lights in the hot spring area of the cave are a bit dim at night; it is recommended to improve it;
The outdoor fish spa pool is a bit disappointing. It is a big circle with some fish and it is quite dirty. Personally, I suggest finding a bigger pool to become a fish spa pool. This original fish spa pool should be rebuilt as another pool!
The dishes in the western restaurant are first-class, the dishes are added in time, and the waiter has a very good attitude, smiling and polite. (The waiters in the hotel lobby and the cleaning staff in the housekeeping depar**ent are also very amiable). 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
In the future, I will continue to stay at Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel. When I checked out, I thanked the front desk for giving me three precious gifts.

It was a bit depressing to wait in line for ten or twenty minutes. Originally booked a Qingya twin room, the front desk Xiao Yuan offered to upgrade it to a garden view double bed for free. The room area was upgraded from 65 square meters to 70 square meters. Looking at the pictures, it should be the difference between whether there is a balcony or not. Although the difference is not very big, it is The happiness of staying has been greatly improved in an instant.
The hotel lobby is on the third floor, our room is on the second floor, the hot spring is on the first floor, and the elevator has to go down. The first time I came here, I was a bit confused, but later I found that the cave hot springs on the first floor are very suitable for such cold weather. From the guest room to the hot spring, there is no need to go outside, to avoid the cold of the little pot friends, especially suitable for families with children. There are more people taking soup in the afternoon, there are no dry towels, and there are fewer customer service staff, so the service is a bit lacking.
The guest room offers welcome fruits and night milk, and the children's utensils in the room are very complete, such as bathrobes, slippers, and children's toothbrushes. The buffet breakfast is rich, and there are more people after 8:30 in the morning. The price of the Chinese restaurant is quite matched with the environment, and the dishes are average. I hope there will be more hotel features.

msg:The day before New Year's Eve, we stayed for two nights. We stayed in a room with an independent hot spring. The room facilities are nothing to say. The large room of 70 square meters is really cool. The bathroom space is almost the size of a room. The size is very suitable for children to take a bath. The temperature of our stay is only 7-10 degrees. The outdoor hot spring has many kinds of traditional Chinese medicine flavors. . The service speed and attitude of the large cabinet and housekeeping are really good. The check in speed is very fast and the efficiency is quite high. The housekeeping speed is also in place to get the room within ten minutes. The beauty also gave my daughter a doll for the Year of the Tiger because of the first day of the new year. The only fly in the oin**ent is the western restaurant. The raw sashimi is only poor dace and frozen snapper. The quality of the cooked food area and the grilled area is really not ideal. The only thing that can be taken out is the bread and dessert area. , But for a five-star hotel buffet, I think it is only 5-6 points, and there is still a lot of room for improvement. After all, the room rate is so high, it is better to spend 50-100 expensive to improve the quality of food and various tastes, not cheap Only the ingredients can attract the praise of repeat customers. I hope the hotel managers will also think about it. The gimmick of hot pot is actually meaningless. They are all cheap and cheap ingredients. I’m sorry for the five-star label. The area and dim sum are also very average. That siu mai is really unpalatable. It is strongly recommended that your hotel change the dim sum supplier. The only thing that can be praised is the Chinese restaurant, the lychee wood roasted chicken is really delicious, the chef who cooks and marinates the roasted chicken should be rewarded! For the whole body, except for the food, the rest of the accommodation experience is not bad. I will come back again if I have a chance.

msg:A friend recommended this hot spring hotel, so I decided to bring my son here to try it before Chris**as 😂

Needless to say, the hotel environment is luxurious. Every waiter in the hotel is very polite and will say hello when we meet. The front desk lady Yan Qixia also upgraded us to a hot spring room for free because it was our first time to the hotel. In order to give us a better experience, We got the Children's Park experience voucher and extended our check-out time to two o'clock the next day. This is already the best experience for us! 😃Thank you!

The room environment, with a space of 65-70 square meters, is large and comfortable. The bed is King size. The bathroom has three independent small rooms including a shower room, a cloakroom, and a toilet. This is the first time I have seen a bathroom like this. It’s big 😂 If financial conditions permit, it is recommended to choose a mountain view hot spring room! There is a big difference in the scenery between garden view hot spring rooms and mountain view hot spring rooms. The garden view can only see the small garden inside the hotel and other guest rooms, while the mountain view has a wide view and can see the building. If you go to the hot spring area, you can also overlook the waterfall of Baishui Village (for some room numbers). Standing on the balcony, I feel that it is worth the extra money💰!

The hot spring area environment, the park area is relatively large, and the hot springs and pools are relatively abundant (there are not many pools to count). When there are not many guests, the pools are basically reserved 😂 The biggest feature of the park is the non-cave hot springs ♨No one else, soaking in the hot springs under the colorful lights, in the cave♨It’s so cool😂

As for the catering service, the hotel's location is relatively in-depth, and there are not many nearby farms. Since I have my son with me, I can easily settle it in the hotel. Although the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants are not very big, they are relatively reasonable and conscientious in terms of production, price, and richness of dishes.

Finally, there is transportation. The hotel is more suitable for self-driving travel. For those of us who don’t have a car, we can either join a group or a car, or we can only choose the subway➕Didi mode of travel! Come out of Exit B of Dongfeng Station of Metro Line 14 and take Didi, which costs more than 60 yuan, which takes a lot of time and effort, but it is also the best way to arrive!

Overall, the stay experience this time was really good, cost-effective, comfortable, warm, having fun, and well-fed! Highly recommended👍🏻

Mai Haimei received meticulous service at the front desk and was warm and thoughtful. The originally booked elegant room was upgraded for the first time because she came to the store for the first time. The problems and needs encountered during the process were all solved in a timely manner. The high-end and luxurious room design and the 180-degree garden landscape with no dead ends, like a landscape painting, made the children so excited that they immediately started a video "live broadcast". During the two-day and one-night play process, I personally enjoyed the five-star service at home. Thank you for the smile and caring of every service staff of Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel. Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel is worth staying and playing again with your family. Next time Goodbye, the five-star Baishuizhai Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel!

The overall service staff is very enthusiastic and will answer all questions.

This hotel is worthy of the four characters at the door-home away from home!

Next time bring a family to live in a big villa to play.

msg:It’s the first time to soak in the hot spring of Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel. The hotel is newer and the lobby is very magnificent! Li Shuhui at the front desk was very enthusiastic. I originally booked two garden-view rooms. She upgraded us to a mountain-view room with a king-size bed, which was very comfortable! Pack your luggage and come to the hot springs. There are special cave hot springs, various bathing pools, bathing pools for traditional Chinese medicine, fish therapy pools, bubble pools, several swimming pools, and paddling pools. Breakfast is also very good! The experience was very good! We will come again next time we have a chance!

msg:Baishuizhai hotels such as Sanying, Jinxiu, Forest Sea, Golden Leaf, Gaotan, etc. have basically been stayed in. This seems to be a little old, and it is for the Jiahua brand. The lobby is luxurious and luxurious. We have a mountain-view room on the second floor. The view is not as good as I expected. The room is spacious and bright. The decoration is a bit old-fashioned. The bathroom is oversized and not practical. The bathtub is not used. The hot spring pool on the balcony also feels old. The hot springs in the park are very good, very large, with many pools. The beauty Yan Qixia at the front desk said that we would arrange a higher floor next time and also sent a souvenir, thank you! Looking forward to the next perfect experience

msg:It was unexpectedly good, I thought it was no different from other hot spring hotels, until the moment I opened the door, it shocked me! The waiter kindly helped us get a towel decoration to celebrate our honeymoon trip, which was a little touched. In terms of hardware, there are a lot of outdoor hot spring pools. It is also good to just soak in a few. There are also hot spring boiled eggs that you can buy. The taste is very special. It is recommended to try it. The rest area provides some drinks and food, and it’s good to replenish your energy after soaking in the hot springs. We chose a room with a hot spring pool. The advantage is that it has good privacy, but the disadvantage is that the water release time is a bit long, and the room does not have heating. This is a pity. The breakfast buffet is rich in variety, including Chinese and Western dishes, and is recommended. I have a good impression of the reception staff of the hotel here, especially Comrade Xiao Wu. The service is very attentive and the explanation is very patient. I would like to give him a compliment.

The layout is warm and a**osphere. There will be live singers at noon. Thank you Wu Mingxi for the promptness of the receptionist. And thoughtful, there is an upgraded room, a pleasant stay, and a fruit gift. When you go to the hot spring in the afternoon, the water temperature in the lower half is lower. If you like the high temperature, you can go to the upper half. The night view of the park is also very good in the evening. There is also a complimentary milk before bed. .The breakfast of the next day is rich in both Chinese and Western flavors!

msg:The downtown area of Guangzhou is about 1.5 hours by car. There are plenty of parking lots, both outdoors and underground. The lobby is very large and there are many sofas, which makes it a**ospheric and comfortable. The lobby bar has a superb view. Today is the weekend, and it seems that some companies are coming to the event, and many people are staying. When checking in, the little brother Wu Mingxi at the front desk was very courteous and friendly. We booked two rooms and helped us arrange adjacent rooms on the same floor. He also upgraded to a garden-view hot spring room for free. The room is very large and comfortable, with separate wet and dry, bathtub and cloakroom, balcony with private hot spring pool, rooms are equipped with children's bathrobes, slippers and toiletries, fruit and milk are also delivered in the evening, very considerate. There are many public hot spring pools, and they are large, so they are not crowded or rushed at all. The pools are separated from each other, so it feels good. There are also cave hot spring pools with relatively low temperature. There is a small children’s pool with a temperature of over 30 degrees and a lot of balls. The children like it very much. It would be nice if the shallow water pool and the children’s play pool (the one with the slide) next to it were also warm. The current weather is really a bit cold. The staff are very polite and will greet the guests on the way. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. When he left the store, he also gave a bull doll to the children. A very satisfying trip, both the elderly and the children enjoyed it very much.

msg:The Baishuizhai area is a hot spring hotel, this time it is the second brush, because it is better to think this one is better after a round of comparison! Whether it’s the environment, sanitation or service, it’s worthy of praise 👍🏻 The hot spring water is natural and comfortable, and there are not many people on workdays. It is a vacation and leisure ⛱️
🚗 Transportation: Two hours from Foshan, you will arrive at the expressway, which is very convenient.
🧹Sanitation: The room sanitation is generally good, and the hot spring area is also very clean.
🔔Service: Li Shuhui’s service attitude at the front desk is very good. Finally, I received a small gift after checking out. The good time of the day opens~

msg:I have taken my children to live in Jiahua in Huidong in the summer. The children and the elderly have a great time and the impression is very good, so this time I chose to live in Guangzhou Jiahua and take the whole family to the hot springs. The environment is very good, the rooms are large and comfortable, and the service staff are very enthusiastic, especially Xiao Xie at the front desk who is very enthusiastic about upgrading and arranging room types. Staff passing by will greet politely. There are many types of hot springs, and overall it is a good choice.
The only shortcoming is that the weather on the mountain is very cold and the room has no heating facilities. Although the heater and quilt are added, the air in the whole room is still cold. Hope it can be improved.

In addition, the cocktails in the lobby bar at night are also good, and there is also a Starbucks self-service coffee. There are also many games for children, which is really everything, and it is not perfunctory.

msg:It's cold, soak in a hot spring ♨️.
Check in: The epidemic is not over, everyone is responsible for protection. At the entrance, each person scans the code to register, and also needs to fill in the form to register. The check-in time will be done soon.
Room: I got my room card, and when I arrived at the room, I saw that the waiter had just closed the door. It turned out that it had just been cleaned. The rooms are large, clean and odorless. The toilet is separated from wet and dry, and there is a cloakroom. The bed is not soft or hard, and comfortable.
Hot springs: The cave hot springs are good, that is, the water temperature of each pool is around 33-37 degrees, which is more suitable for children to swim. There are not many outdoor hot spring pools with high water temperature. This is very embarrassing. As a result, one or two pools with high water temperature are full of people, which is very boring. Let’s talk about the children’s pool. It’s cold water. Only a small pool is warm. It’s boring to sit with parents and children. This is far worse than the forest sea.
Meals: The dinner buffet is rich in food, the theme is roasted whole lamb, and the food used is mainly western flavor. However, the regular seafood, sushi, dessert, beer, wine, and wine will accompany you. The breakfast is also rich in variety and good. It is recommended to put a bag with a mask in every place. When taking food, guests are required to wear a mask. Now more star-rated hotels require this. To be honest, the epidemic is not over and you can't relax for a day.
Finally check out: fast and convenient. Because I had to issue an invoice with the child, Miss Fu Dainan was very patient to assist in the process, so the check-out went smoothly, and finally gave me two small gifts. The kids are so happy.
Looking forward to staying in Ultraman themed room next time.

The hot spring area occupies a large area, dozens of hot spring pools are scattered in an orderly manner. The design of pavilions and pavilions, surrounded by trees and flowers, is really pleasing to the eye! It happened that there was a company development conference and there were very few individual visitors. Every time they went to a pool, they were almost all chartered! It is a perfect holiday! I would like to praise Li Shuhui, the young lady at the front desk when checking out, the service attitude is very good!

After the National Day, I brought my parents to the hot springs, and by the way, helped Mommy celebrate her birthday, and booked in advance with Ctrip. The remarks require someone to call me and confirm again. This is good.
I arrived at the hotel at about 1 noon on weekdays, and I was able to check in. The guy at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped me upgrade my room type and handle late check-out for free.
The upgraded room type should be a garden-view hot spring bathing pool room. The room is very large with a separate bathing pool and you can see the garden view.
🚗 Transportation: About an hour and a half from Guangzhou, the high-speed is very smooth, and the navigation is directly to the indoor parking lot of the hotel.
🔔Service: Someone will pour tea for us in the hot spring, the service is very enthusiastic
In addition to the outdoor hot springs, there are also cave hot springs, which is a special feature, but it is really dark inside.
You can also give a cake for your birthday. The hard-working waiter delivered it to our room at 9pm. It was very helpful and the family was very satisfied. Thank you!
Overall it is a good place for vacation, suitable for staying here for a week to rest.
The only thing I want to comment on is that the buffet breakfast here is indeed less variety and tastes very ordinary, maybe it's just a simple environment.
I hope that next time I come, there will be an improvement in eating!

The pool is in the courtyard outside the room. The privacy is too poor. You can see it upstairs at any time. Some plants were planted in the yard next door to stop him, and he could pass by with a foot, and he felt safe.

The Chinese restaurant in the hotel produces good products, and the price is similar to that of restaurants in the city. But breakfast in a Chinese restaurant really feels different from dinner. During the epidemic, everyone did not wear a mask to take breakfast and was not supervised. The steamed buns and chicken feet in the steamer don’t even have a lid, all of them are close together. Those mouth foams are sprayed on it, which is not hygienic at all. In fact, the restaurant can use some transparent lids to cover the steamer, the guests can see Besides, it is also relatively hygienic. There are still parent-child activities, such as amu*****t parks, game consoles, and science performances during the National Day. Generally speaking, it is still passable, hoping to improve the hygiene of breakfast.

I like the hardware of the shop~ I have enough fun for two days and one night~ You can use 2 brushes and 3 brushes~
Miss Tan at the front desk has a good service, and she takes the initiative to introduce hotel offers ~ also like one 👍

I felt very grand when I entered the lobby~ the front desk helped to upgrade the room~ happy, the children were even more happy~ the bed was very comfortable. The greenery in the park is very good, and the whole landscape looks like Thailand~ You can still see the waterfall in Baishui Village when you look out of the room?

Hot springs, swimming pools, children's pools, many, large, not crowded~

Especially for the slate bed, nobody is there. (I have tried many other hotel slate beds, but they are full of uncles and aunts and cannot be experienced)

Will come next time~ ah

The toilet has a shower and a bathtub. The bed is bigger than other hotels, the pillows are soft and comfortable. We first went to the outdoor swimming pool for a while, and then went to various types of hot spring pools to soak. It takes about an hour to take it, and from time to time, a staff member comes to deliver drinks, reminding us not to soak for more than 15 minutes. I wanted to eat western food for dinner, but then I thought about looking at the Chinese menu first, but I decided to eat Chinese food after seeing it, and both dinner and lunch were settled in the Chinese restaurant. The product is very good and the price is reasonable. recommend! The service staff here are very polite and will greet us when they see us on the way.

In order to make it easier for us to live in one area, the front desk directly upgraded the hot spring room, and also gave away tickets to the children’s playground, which was postponed to two for free. Check out and gave a doll before leaving. The kids were so happy throughout! The buffet restaurant on the second floor and the Chinese restaurant on the third floor produce good products, with many varieties, and the food is also fun! The karst cave hot springs are very distinctive, and the water park is also fun. The only downside is that there are a lot of mosquitoes, which may be due to the humidity in the mountains.

🧹Sanitation: The room is clean and tidy, the bathroom is dry and there is no trace of water, even the balcony tables and chairs are free of dust, and the sanitation is in place!
🍃Environment: Baishui Village can be seen from the terrace of the hotel lobby, and the mountain view is first-rate. There is a waterway on the first floor of Building 3 (you can go directly into the water on the balcony of the room), and the first floor of Building 2 is a viewing path (you need to rent a rubber boat for rowing in the outdoor hot spring). The outdoor hot springs are divided into traditional Chinese medicine health springs and mountain top hot springs. There are about ten each. I personally feel that the mountain top hot springs are relatively cleaner than the traditional Chinese medicine health springs. There is also a slide spring that is most popular with children. Only one outdoor swimming pool has been opened, but it is a pity that the Jacuzzi has not been opened! The indoor is karst cave hot springs, there are quite a lot of hot spring pools, it may be due to summer, it feels sultry inside, I have no experience for the time being, I will consider coming back in winter!
🔔Service: Every staff is very polite, and everyone will say hello! The handsome guy in the lobby has a high check-in efficiency, and he upgrades his room for free, he must like it!

msg:Recently I wanted to find a place to relax. I have been entangled in Sanying and Jiahua time, but because Sanying has been there several times, I decided to come to Jiahua to experience it. My husband is also very interested in Jiahua and I have seen a lot on Ctrip. Comment~Amidst all the praise, I decided to book a room~ Let’s talk about my best feelings~
First of all, the location does not feel as good as Sanying, because there are more restaurants in Sanying, but they are all acceptable. The entire park is quite large. Check in at the front desk at 12 o'clock. It was received by my younger brother Wu Mingxi. This name really appears in many reviews haha, and I am no exception. Indeed, the service attitude is very good, very patient to explain, and also helped me upgrade the room with a bubble pool, thank you very much 🙏 for him 👍
The rooms are really great, with separate wet and dry areas, a large toilet, a cloakroom in it, a bathtub, a mouthwash cup for children, and laundry detergent! ! Have been pleasantly surprised! The curtains can be opened and closed with a button, and there is a bubble pool on the balcony, so there is no limit to the amount of water in the pool. but! ! The bed looks big, but when you sleep on it, you will find that two beds are put together. This will cost you points!
It is said that there are 55 hot spring pools, but several pools are out of service for maintenance, and then some pools will be more concentrated, others will be more scattered. The guidelines for the hot spring area feel that it is not detailed enough. For example, there is no way to go and there is no sign to remind guests. The hot spring area is scattered, and the hot spring pools in the mountain top hot spring area will be more concentrated, but when you want to go to another area Need to walk for a while, and there are no hot spring pools next to it. There are a lot of people on the weekends, and there are basically people in every pool. The waiter will take the initiative to provide tea, but it feels that the tea taste is relatively weak, and there is something to like, the waiter sometimes reminds the hot spring that the best time to soak in the hot spring is 10-15 minutes, get up and walk in time, drink plenty of water, and be careful to prevent slippery ~ but There are a lot of pools that are not very hot or very hot, and the most anticipated milk pool does not smell milk at all. Each area of the dressing room is planned to be differentiated. The bathing, toilet, hair blowing, and storage cabinets are all partitioned. Better ~ There is less food in the rest area.
Dinner is purchased separately. Before buying, the waiter will suggest to look at the buffet food before deciding whether to buy it. This is good. Since my husband and I only had two people, and didn't want to look outside anymore, I decided to eat at the hotel. There was no regret, only disappoin**ent. The only sashimi are sea bream and red and yellow dace. There is only one type of sushi. There are not many types of seafood. The others are also very common. The taste of juice is not fresh, but it is bland and tasteless. There are not many types of food in the buffet as a whole, and the area is not large. It’s really not recommended to eat here~
Finally, I feel that the price/performance ratio here is not high, although the room is very good, but overall I am sorry for his price.

So I went swimming with my children at 3:00 p.m., but the swimming pool was out of service. I asked a manager to coordinate. From 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., there was no satisfactory answer, the only satisfactory one. But the manager's attitude is okay. He promised many times that the swimming pool would be available at 8:30 the next morning, but he was still disappointed, and it was not resumed until around 12 noon. I don't know how this hotel got such a high score?

The hotel has exquisite a**osphere, lush gardens and complete facilities for children. The hot spring area is large and the cave is designed to make it feel more secluded. The breakfast is also very rich, especially suitable for a family holiday. When I was in Paitan Town, I suddenly engaged in a "prevention and control stress test drill", and I couldn't control whether it was a real drill or an oolong. Anyway, a good hotel changed a large-scale nucleic acid testing site. The hotel staff organized the inspections in an orderly manner, and arranged free lunches in an emergency. Thanks to the front desk brother Wu Mingxi, he upgraded the garden-view room for free when he checked in. In case of emergencies, he promptly communicated and explained patiently. The "drilling" episode ended before the evening of the second day. The overall experience is still very good, will come again.

The room card is special, in the form of a watch, so you don’t worry about losing it.

[Hot spring hot spring pool] There are a lot of hot spring pools. The most important thing is that the hot spring water is real. I haven't seen any wrinkles after soaking for a long time. It's still slippery after soaking~ Entertainment facilities are also available. There is also a barbecue bar in the hot spring pool. It's not expensive and tastes good.
[Indoor swimming pool] Without a swimming cap, I can only observe it.

To sum up~ Will come again next time!

The breakfast and dinner of the hotel have a buffet in the western restaurant on the second floor, which is rich in variety and delicious. Lunch can be ordered in the Cantonese restaurant on the first floor. The products and taste are very good.

Where there is singing, there is a halo, where there is a smile, there is a filter. The Jiahua Hot Spring Hotel is a place worth visiting!

Some commented that it is not as good as Jiahua. Just search here. Before I went, I thought the decoration of the hotel was a bit old-fashioned. Actually it is much better than the picture. The room is huge. There is a bathtub and even a coat rack. The front desk opened membership for free and upgraded the mountain view room. With the floor-to-ceiling glass of the room, you can see the entire valley at a glance, which is picturesque. Downstairs is the swimming pool and hot spring.
The children are having fun. Breakfast and dinner are buffet at the hotel. not bad. To make a suggestion, the hotel is very relaxed on buffet management. Some people took a lot and ended up eating a lot. It's really wasteful. It is recommended to strengthen management to avoid waste. Wouldn't it be better to put the cost in upgrading the dishes?

I am very grateful to Chen Yinghao at the front desk for his patient and meticulous arrangements. The summer is scorching, and it is impossible to stay outdoors during the day. The hotel room is large enough and there is enough space for activities. There is also a balcony and a large bathtub. The hotel arranges various activities. You can also have fun hiding indoors during the day. The swimming pool is open to 2 at night. Point, children are having fun and come back, an excellent choice for water play in summer

msg:I visited when it first opened 3 years ago, and the impression was good, so this time I revisit the old place. Greening and recreational facilities are much better than before. The staff is nice and welcoming. The room is very large and comfortable, the most attractive thing is the oversized bathtub. There are welcome fruits and good night milk, laundry detergent, children's toothbrushes, etc. From these details, we can see the hotel's intentions. There are many types of hot springs. The lobby has VR and game consoles, children's playground, parent-child activities, etc., with rich programs, and a rich breakfast buffet, which can be eaten as lunch. The only thing that I feel is a little lacking, breakfast and hot spring tickets are only free for children under 1.2 meters, if it can be adjusted to 1.4 meters, it would be more reasonable.

Recently, the assistant managers in the lobby have put on blue and white cheongsam, changing the stereotype of ordinary five-star hotel black suits. Mr. Li Yinghao at the front desk received a call from us to change the room and immediately put down his work. To deal with it (click 👍), every waiter is polite (👍)

msg:We checked in at the hotel almost at 3 o'clock. It is estimated that it was a typhoon ➕ non-weekend, and only we are doing it. It takes less than 10 minutes to process the membership card (membership card is free, and room reservations can be discounted). First of all, I am very grateful to Miss Yan Qixia and Miss Wei Yumin at the front desk. We were upgraded for free after knowing that I had brought two babies. I booked the cheapest twin room. There is a Bobo Pool, and a ticket to the children’s playground is also given. A baby is available for 2 days. It costs 50 yuan! The room is large and the design is very holiday feel. Of course, our focus must be on the outdoor hot spring area. After all, playing in the water in summer is a business. Although the children's playground area is not big, it is enough for children to play. By the way, there is also an indoor swimming pool. My father and I went at 9 o'clock in the evening to book the venue. Oh, I also said that I missed the karst cave hot spring area. There is no need to dry it, but the venue is not big. Haha, anyway, a family of four had a good time. I didn't take a few photos.

msg:The hotel hardware is first-class, and the external environment does not say that the overall situation is like a foreign resort hotel, suitable for couples on a honeymoon holiday, but parent-child travel must be careful, a bit pit! unreasonable! The problem that shouldn’t arise is: obviously I stayed in a twin room that can accommodate a family of three (children’s slippers and bathrobes and toothbrushes in the room). But when I went to the swimming pool to play, there was an aunt who blocked the road and said that it was more than 1.2 meters tall. No matter how old children are, they have to buy tickets to enter. We said OK, but because she didn’t bring her mobile phone, we asked her if she could hang up a room card for consumption. She said yes, but she couldn't handle it. The visitor was asked to go to the front desk to handle it (the swimming pool is on the first floor and the lobby is on the 3rd floor). We asked her if she could find a way to assist with the handling. She said no with a bad attitude, but we dragged the house. I went to the lobby on the 3rd floor to find someone to deal with it. Fortunately, I met their lobby manager, Manager Chen, who helped us solve the problem enthusiastically and actively. I am very grateful to him. In fact, more than 80 tickets should not be collected. This will reduce the customer’s sense of experience. If you must collect it, I would rather add it to the room rate.

The scenery outside the room is really beautiful and it looks very comfortable.
The balcony comes with a private bathing pool♨️, and the room also has a bathtub🛁.
Every night, there are intimate hot milk, rose tea and chrysanthemum tea.
The breakfast was okay, but the air conditioner in the restaurant didn't seem to be turned on this time. It was very hot and made people sweat while eating.
The hot spring downstairs saw a staff cleaning the pool, and suddenly felt relieved.

Thanks to Chen Yinghao at the front desk for helping us upgrade to a pool room with mountain view for free. The hotel room is big enough and the view is superb. Attentive service, free fruit and good night milk every day. Since the peak season has not yet arrived, there are not many people in the swimming pool, so going to play every day is equivalent to chartering. I like the Chinese restaurant here the most. The product is very good. I ate for two nights and I highly recommend it!

其他方面：房間很大，環境不錯，衞生也好。小童活動還是比較豐富的，大堂的活動規劃建議要考慮下動線，高峯期時會有點吵。下雨天，温泉沒去。自助晚餐海鮮刺身供應充足且新鮮，早餐也算多樣，能滿足用餐需求，就是人多了點。

住過園景房，山景房，退款山景房，可以看到白水寨的瀑布。視野超級好。樓層也是李麗敏美女推薦的，果然相信她沒有錯。

msg:設施：因為入住的是1號樓，之前跟前台的姑娘也溝通了，因為帶了小傢伙，擔心影響到別人，選擇的房間相對安靜，也幫忙給主動升級了房型，服務一直很棒。

衞生：房間衞生一直是很乾凈的，户型也大，小傢伙一進房間就玩嗨了，寵物友好酒店太感動了，希望能一直持續着，也希望帶寵物的主人能自律的約束好自家小可愛，互相理解，互相包容。

環境：最喜歡就是這邊的綠水成蔭的環境，尤其是過年期間，夜晚的燈光和燈籠直接將過年的氛圍感拉滿，晚上9點半的煙花表演真的很不錯，時間再長一點就更完美。

服務：她們家的服務一直很值得肯定，尤其是前台李麗敏和其他幾個姑娘，服務很周到貼心，給小傢伙提供了一些需要用到的東西。
不足：這個就需要説到餐飲這一塊，這個早餐和晚餐安排上確實又不足之處，如果菜品種類再豐富一些，會更好了。
總之，還是可以五星好評的！！

房間設計與眾不同，比起一般房間更新奇有趣
落地玻璃窗，整體寬敞明亮又有設計感，浴缸很大，還有獨立温泉池，看着夜景泡温泉！

當時節日，附近酒店有煙花，我們遠遠觀望，沒想到，就在温泉池裡，空中忽然炸開焰火，第一次這樣近距離看盛大的煙花，年度驚喜！

客房服務周到，前台也貼心
早餐也非常豐富，住客很多，孩子吃得開心

温泉其實很大，但指引不夠清晰，很多人會誤以為衹有一個不大的區域，有點可惜
希望改進
推薦！💝

酒店房間很大，75平的面積也是比較少見，住的很舒適，晚上還整整放了7、8分鐘的煙火，非常的漂亮，質量高的煙花對住户很有誠意。
因為身體不舒服這次沒能泡上温泉，但是之前因為公司要開訂貨會的時候來踩過點，瞭解過這個酒店的温泉還是非常不錯的，等下回身體好點了再過來玩了，對服務人員小石還有店醫都表示非常滿意。

餐飲方面:比如現在温泉區沒有提供水果，沒有伴手禮，自助餐海鮮沒有長腳蟹，沒有馬卡龍，沒有手握壽司，自助餐18點開始，我18.30到，餐區很多東西就已經清盤？而且補充不及時，走了幾趟、吃完一輪後去看還是沒補充……泳池方面:8:30下樓打算游泳但是恆温泳池的温度還是可以低於體温大概34-35度於是放棄。
温泉方面:這樣冷的天，大多池温度衹有37-38度感覺很冷，從溶洞區濕着身到露天温泉要走一條長約5分鐘的路涼風習習很冷，設計不合理，温泉區很難找到替換毛巾。
説一下好的方面，工作人員態度好，房間乾淨，設施齊全，貼心提供充電線，小童浴袍牙具和拖鞋，四支水，水果牛奶，可以看到翡翠台，洗浴用品品質不錯，叫拿東西很快送到，服務好。

公共温泉裏的工作人員也是服務很到位，碰到麪都會打招呼笑臉盈盈，泡温泉時會有工作人員端水來提醒我們要多補充水，這一點體驗很好
最後是誇一下早餐，種類算比較豐富，晚餐中餐廳的燒雞真的特別贊

1：入住第一天在房間午睡被小孩跑動聲音吵醒，聯繫前台要求處理被告知需付清潔費換房，我們決定先小睡一會兒後再決定，睡着後被前台奪命三連call（前台似乎比我們還着急這點清潔費），無奈！交錢換房。衹能發小紅書反饋評價差。
2：終於能睡個午覺，原以為就此結束，結果晚上十一點半又被隔壁拖凳子和小孩跑步聲音吵醒（隔音到底是有多差）。至此未聯繫前台，擔心他們大晚上又叫人來核算清潔費。
3：隔天攜程介入，來電後告知可以延遲三點退房，想着能睡個好覺了，一點到兩點之間被無盡的電鑽鎚子聲音吵醒，第三次被吵醒。 
ps：住店期間，活動時間共十二個小時，接了十二個電話。來自前台，攜程。想睡個好覺的不必考慮這家。最後，辛苦服務人員賠禮道歉，沒有為難你們的意思，我也知道這是你們領導沒有給到足夠的權限，因此沒辦法服務好顧客，不用感到自責。

msg:第二次入住，訂了幾間房
先説好的方面，硬件和温泉還是不錯的，房間比較新，温泉池也比較多，衹是可能因為下雨，温泉水有點臟。
不好的方面，主要還是服務跟不上：12點到酒店，前台一位姓石的美女面帶微笑，又很堅決的告知12點半才能辦入住，現在是退房時間。我們表示能否可以先辦手續，不取房卡，仍然被拒絕，再次被告知辦手續也不可以。這是這麼多年來第一次遇到這樣的情況。
      晚餐吃酒店吃自助，被告知要收15%服務費，因為沒有在開餐前提前預約，出示了**的頁面，服務員説這個不能用時間不對，但是頁面明明顯示4號5號專用，最後爭論了幾句，同意免掉服務費。
      自助餐是有配酒水，不過自己帶了酒，被告知要收開瓶費100元，十分不理解，如果是單獨銷售酒水，不允許自帶酒水還是可以理解，但是本身酒水免費，為啥還不允許自己帶酒，十分困惑。。。
     第二天退房的時候做了延遲退房申請，延遲到兩點，從12點到兩點，三次敲門，分別問是否需要洗衣，是否需要打掃衞生，甚至我開門動作慢了點，直接刷卡開門進來了。。。
       理解可能因為沒有取電卡，外面看不到房間有人，但是這個酒店本身不應該有通知服務員這個房間兩點退房嗎
      酒店各項收費對於小朋友的身高劃分很嚴格，無可厚非，但是對於親子酒店略顯不夠友好。

2. 第二天早上發現枕套上一攤暗紅色印記，十分噁心。反饋到管理層從頭到尾的意思是他們服務員不可能看不到，合著意思是我們自己弄上去的？？我圖啥？？
3. 室內温泉水質肉眼可見的不乾淨。一個幾十平方的所謂的小童樂園竟然還要另外收費？收費的設施也不維護一下？聞所未聞，見所未見。
總體來説非常差的一次體驗，價格與服務設施完全不匹配。

2、房間是一樓直連泳道房間，濕度較大，開始的時候有點粘，但空調設定到23度就變回乾爽舒適（後來阿姨送晚安水果也提醒我們不要長時間開陽台門，會潮濕）
3、房間設施能看得出來有點年份但還是很乾凈
4、浴室水壓非常好，開到最大感覺都可以用來洗車了
5、泳道常温水，剛進去有點冷，但到開闊區域有太陽就變得比較暖，下水會發現泳池邊上綠化帶後有人隨同保障遊客安全，贊
6、泳道有人清理水上樹葉殘渣雜物，好乾凈
7、小賣部零食貴但房間飲品免費，不錯不錯
8、餐飲方面要提醒，**外賣兩輪電動車是不允許進入酒店範圍的，如果叫外賣用兩輪電動車送餐，需要走到外面保安亭拿餐。大堂有自助星巴克咖啡機
9、温泉和公共遊樂設施不錯，很乾凈

msg:設施：除了房間維護好些，其他地方都明顯老舊了
衞生：室內温泉一股酸臭味，悶熱不通風，多待一會都難受，室外温泉池都不夠熱

餐飲：早餐沒什麼可以吃的，品質少得可憐，臨近10:30幾乎什麼都收掉了。自助晚餐更是除了白灼蝦，已經沒啥好吃的能擺上枱麪了，連煎牛扒也要排長龍。餐廳服務員有要求也愛理不理的態度，餐飲衹能算經濟酒店水平。

服務：很多不合理地方，服務員也愛理不理，所謂的星級酒店提供就目測這點兒大而已的小童樂園居然要額外收￥30一個人，出來脱掉的拖鞋不見了還不管。遊戲機微信充值幣進去遊戲機死機了也找不到人跟進。

總之吃玩都不爽，不會有下次了。

msg:總體來説，體驗還可以，但是覺得在酒店住宿還是總體性價比較低。因為覺得温泉景點是可以開放給所有人的，對於在酒店住宿反而沒有那麼多必要性，比起其他的五星級酒店特色相對弱了一些。温泉還是不錯的
1.衞生
總體衞生還是稍微欠缺了一點。衞生相較於民宿和四星級酒店等等來説，還是要好很多的。但是房間裏面的浴缸，洗手盆應該是沒有清潔過的，馬桶裏麪的馬桶彎道那還是有明顯污垢。房間的衞生比衞浴衞生要好一些。桌面上看上去沒有灰塵什麼的
2.設施
設施非常不錯，我給了四星，這也是五星級的標準吧。民宿和五星級以下的酒店，房間的凳子，沙發等很多有明顯污漬，這裏的肉眼看上去都是乾乾淨淨的。酒店的環境也挺好的，房間和衞浴室夠大的，比較舒適
3.服務
需要提供服務的時候除了飯點會慢，可能會出現無人接聽，其餘時候都是比較快的。遇到有些工作人員也會説新年好之類的，但是有些人不説，有些人説，覺得還是統一説或者統一不説好。
4.需要提升的地方：
4-1.為什麼不給一份介紹温泉景點和酒店總體設施設備的地圖呢？酒店內和景點到底提供什麼特色服務呢？這些設施和服務是否值得客人付出比温泉門票多那麼多的金錢呢？温泉門票對外開放，酒店需要營收，這是能理解的，但是衹提供給酒店客人的服務和設施是什麼呢？我是因為家人來遊玩，住之前才稍微瞭解一下，對於那些沒有時間和精力查詢的人，對你們酒店的特色項目一無所知，給住宿的客人提供的温泉服務人員既沒有任何介紹，也沒有任何資料可以查看，我一直想玩不屬於温泉景點的特色項目，但是一直找不到。而且進入温泉景點後，雖然有指引，沒有一份稍微詳細點的總體地圖，衹能自己一路走一路摸索，遇上什麼就使用什麼温泉或者什麼項目。
4-2.沒有提供多套浴袍更換。温泉酒店主打泡温泉，那麼住宿客人多次去泡温泉是很正常的事情，但是浴袍衹有一套，濕了的又要打電話去要更換，多換2套還要收費？集中清洗浴袍的話清洗費用一套成本也不超過4塊吧？如果一個房間客人要十幾套的話可能有點過分，2個房間4個人8套浴袍不過分吧？既然嫌棄增加成本，乾脆讓客人自備好了，主打泡温泉定位酒店不能提供多套免費可以更換浴袍的服務覺得真的是有點不人性化。對於住宿的人來説，肯定是房間更換更舒適
4-3.小童水上樂園水是涼的，整個酒店提供給小童遊玩的地方很少。因為温泉門票價格不貴，小童樂園水不加熱節省成本能夠理解，但是對於酒店住宿客人還是不認可。或者在酒店內提供一個温水小童樂園，或者加熱現有小童樂園水免費提供給住宿客人，收費衹有温泉票的客人，或者全部免費。
4-4.溶洞温泉感覺一般般，衝著這個去的，但是衹要觀賞過天然溶洞都會覺得這個項目有點讓人失望（我在泡温泉的過程中聽到4個小團隊説過這個點，都覺得溶洞挺一般的）。
4-5. 自助早餐花樣真的很多，但是沒有特別好吃的。感覺每一樣口味都一般般的（很多同類型的我都吃到過好吃的路邊小店這種）但是花樣確實多，而且綜合口味都還行
綜合這些 我下次應該不會選擇你們酒店住宿了 可能會更加願意泡温泉

環境：套房空間很大，適合一家出遊入住，小朋友在房間內也有空間可以走動玩耍，房間內陽台可以看到酒店園景和遠處青山，環境優美。
服務：這次是第三次來嘉華温泉酒店了，從進入停車場工作人員細心地停車指揮，到辦理入住時的前台熱情地接待，上樓時大堂工作人員細心地看到我推着寶寶車不方便提東西、幫我推行李上樓，再到泡温泉時工作人員暖心地送上茶水等等，讓客人有賓至如歸的感覺，這些都讓我對酒店的服務感到十分的滿意。
特別是酒店前台的小吳值得點贊！在入住前就有提前跟我聯繫，幫忙安排入住，對於我的詢問也是及時回覆、解答疑問。

首先，餐廳找不到我提前一天預訂的位子，不僅不承認是自己內部的交接有問題，反而一直責怪我打錯餐廳電話了
其次，我在耐心等待餐廳處理我的座位問題時，直接把我撂在一邊，去安排後面的客人
第三，好不容易找到一個服務員帶娃去找座位，態度非常差。後來把我們扔到靠樓台的大門口，啥也不説就走了。再去找她，就是不理睬我
第四，坐在那個大門口，露台大門一直開着，冷風不停的吹（那天增城區寒冷黃色預警），我要關門不讓，因為她們説需要去露台搬東西
第五，同行的孩子被風吹的冷得受不了，我要求換座，沒人處理。我電話餐廳投訴，説等會給我答覆和安排。但是一直到第二天我離開，也沒有任何處理
第六，當天晚上，同行有2人感冒發燒。離店的第二天就是除夕。到現在初三晚上了，我們感冒發燒的還沒好！好好的一個春節，就這麼被毀了！
第七，**評價説餐廳服務特別差，我還不信。畢竟客房的服務還不錯，不然我也不會第二次入住。
對了，當天客房的值班經理有電話到房間道歉。但是依舊改變不了兩人被凍感冒的事實，春節期間太糟心了

設施：表揚酒店的無障礙設施做得很好！

總體來説，很不錯，以後來泡温泉還是首選白水寨嘉華酒店。

1.已經第五次入住了，特地訂了園景房，卻沒帶獨立泡池的，跟前台説能不能給個有泡池的，前台白衣哥哥説要補差價。之前幾次都訂清雅房卻都被升級有泡池且房間寬敞的。
2.小童遊樂區現在也要收費。以前前台姐姐是會送遊樂票，現在白衣小哥冷漠地説現在沒有票了。
3.自助晚餐補差價，之前跟酒店提過現場買比大眾點評貴30元的問題，現在酒店改進了，直接在大眾點評寫上需提前一天預約才能198，現場買要228。
感覺就是不想老客户回頭了，行吧，以後再也不來了。

一到酒店辦理入住手續時就很愉快，心情很美麗。
1. 麗珍美女很熱情的幫我們升級了房型，2個房間每間還送了2張飲料券，nice…我們沒有定晚餐自助，麗珍美女很貼心的引導我們操作，贊贊贊。
2.早餐晚餐都在酒店自助，很方便，酒店風景一如既往的美麗，硬件設施齊全，全程不用擔心小朋友，他們自己就可以很愉快的玩耍，嘉華出品值得信賴！
3.有温泉，但小孩們覺得熱，所以這次主打泳池區。無限次來回，實際上我們就去了一次温泉，2次泳池，因有個娃1.2米了，還補了張88元小童票。
泳池的設計很合理，我們有個3歲的孩子，有個淺水區，此娃就獨自在那美麗，哈哈，其他三個大一點的帶着游泳裝備跟大人一起：）
4.孩子們流連忘返啊，都不想走了……退房時麗珍美女還給每個小孩都送了嘉華的小禮物🎁，孩子們興奮且滿足😌謝謝麗珍美女!

自助晚餐該有的都有，刺身很新鮮，吃了好多紅希鯪魚、黃希鯪魚、三文魚。

1. 外賣不能送到大堂，衹能送到大門口保安處。（因為安全考慮保安不會放行外賣騎手）
希望能分配一台小車給前台值班人員，能幫客人把外賣取到大堂。
2. 燒烤餐廳十一點就關門了，希望可以在週末適當延長營業時間或者提供客房送餐服務。（夜間送餐依舊是正餐菜單，不適合宵夜）
3. 從室內到室外温泉泡池有點遠，希望能有車接送或者在地上標記路徑讓走過去的路程更有趣一點。

服務：前台接待員李遠莉很熱情，入住手續辦理很迅速。

餐食: 早餐非常豐富，熱菜涼菜麪包麪條水果樣樣齊全，還有廣州特色的拉腸。缺點就是兩天的餐食沒什麼變化，建議早餐熱菜可以多元化些。

總結: 性價比高。 房間的空間很大，酒店環境整體不錯，客流量不大，非常適合安靜的度假。如果能增加一些親子設施就完美了。

入住定的清雅 辦入住是説第一次來 妹子直接給升級到園景房 很開心 然後就是個比較鬧心的
4點辦好入住 窗門都關好的 去玩水7點多回來 洗手間浴缸和浴室 滿滿的飛蟻 百衹起步 少量飛到房間床上 （問題解決很快速 打了房務電話 讓來看看 沒來的時候我覺得住不下 小孩也怕 就又打電話要求換房 馬上同意了 又升級了房間 還是謝謝） 
然後我估計這個原來房間可能是下水口之類的地方進蟲 希望後面改善
園內餐廳的西餐自助價格還行（不過1米2以上半價小童137每位） 價格還能接受 但是因為溝通房間進蟲問題 吃飯時間有點晚了 8點多去到的 能明顯感覺菜少了點/或者剩下盤裡些許這樣  然後到八點半的樣子 有些菜吃完了就沒再上了（出於避免浪費這個能接受 但畢竟花了錢吃到的東西感覺少了）

衞生：房間收拾的很乾凈，浴缸很明顯是打掃過的，連陽台的墊子都很乾凈，衞生沒得説。

服務：管家小駱很貼心，本來定的房型有遮擋，但是幫忙做了免費升級，升級後的房型視野超讚，能看到整個園區和遠山。因為來得晚第二天退房前還沒有玩夠，管家也幫忙延遲了差不多一小時收房，下次來也指定這個靚仔。退房還有驚喜小禮物，是非常完美的遊玩住宿體驗。

另外最最最不滿的，園區內處處都是額外收費，簡直想錢想瘋了。本來就沒啥可玩的，弄了一個小小環形漂流河，想讓孩子去繞一圈，結果告知要另外收費，在大堂裏等候辦理入住的時候看到有個遊戲機，想讓孩子玩一下，又是38元一次。 我想説，這近兩千一晚的價格，還沒賺夠嗎，就不能把其他項目都免費讓大家玩個開心嗎，永遠不會再來第二次。 這跟隔壁的幾個温泉酒店比，差太多了。
