msg:I booked this hotel for its proximity to Shanghai Disneyland and the pictures look good. And it didn't disappoint. The rooms were very modern, clean, huge and the beds were comfortable. I like the separate shower (especially the rain shower) and toilet area. The free shutter to SDL is very convenient and a bonus but the hotel is located 5 minutes away from the local metro (line 11). It's only 1 station away from Shanghai Disneyland station. It's too hard to find the bus for the return trip and the hotel didn't offer very good instructions on how to board the return bus. But the train station is only one stop away and costs RMB3. I would stay at this hotel again if I were to visit SDL but it's too far away from the city centre (I booked another hotel for the city). The hotel offers an extra service to book early entry passes into SDL which was really really helpful. The listed price was RMB189 and I paid RMB210 for this service and it was worth every cent. I entered SDL at 7am and was able to do all the rides I wanted in 1 day. Highly recommended.

Booked the free shuttle service to Hongqiao train station for travel on 2nd day was such a bonus. Save time, cost and such convenience making way to train station. 

Room is clean and modern design. Bed is very comfortable.

Advisable to book early for the peak timing. Theme suite room is provided with a "starry starry night" projector which the kids love very much. Downside is only 1 restaurant & 1 family mart near the hotel, if you do not want to wonder too far / take train out. 
Very thoughtful breakfast area with tv showing cartoon for kids while having meal.

Everything needs WeChat which being a foreigner I was not able to register, even after asking the staff for help - they referred me to a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. I tried ordering amenities via the phone which took a long time to work and once it did they were not delivered and I had to go down the next day to ask for some. I left the room for the day with a lot of personal things out and my room on so not disturb/do not clean, yet the cleaners still came through. I was surprised they also gave me fresh towels yet I had mine hanging up with the eco conscious label they have asking to care about the environment. I floor was wet which I had to dry when I returned at 5pm. It is a very run down hotel which I would not recommend.

The surrounding area seems like a technology park or light industrial area so don't expect much shopping around here. Small F&B shops are open for dinner. There is a metro station within 5mins walk too!

This may not be consistent with all travellers but we experienced some smell of smoke in the hotel hallways. We hope it is due to smokers returning from the smoking areas instead of smoking in the rooms.

We stayed one night because we were late in.   We left at 6am the next morning got back at 11pm that night and moved hotels immediately.    After sharing my info with Trip.com they were able to extract a partial refund from the hotel.   The only positive.

For me it is the most uncomfortable hotel I have ever stayed in and my room was so hot you could fry an egg 31.5 even with two windows open and aircon off you could not get comfortable until 4am.Anyway, the hotel does not have an aircon that works. It‚Äôs freezing down stairs and boiling upstairs. It is not possible to feel comfortable in this hotel at this time of year. I‚Äôm a member with Accor and this is my worst experience. If there is any intelligent person reading this you may be able to improve this hotel but it will cost lots of $ in infrastructure and staff training.

msg:The hotel facitilies, service and shuttle bus was great. Front desk tried their best to communicate in English and was helpful. Free shuttle bus to Disney and Hongqiao airport is great touch, but do need to reserve 1 day before. Breakfast was varied and great combination of mostly chinese and small western mixes. However, the biggest disappointment was the room cleanliness, our original booked room reeked of leftover food and piss upon our entry. Even though we requested to change the room, the new room was super small for us and we opted for our original room. Eventually the room was cleaned better on 2nd and 3rd day.

The truth is the hotel‚Äôs executive lounge is closed indefinitely and has been so far quite some time. After many complaints to the hotel and Trip, my family and I received mediocre compensation in the form of a meal from the hotel and the offer of some Coins from Trip. Both inadequate compared to the value I place in executive lounge access. Had I known the lounge no longer existed I would have stayed somewhere else, as the lounge was reason that swayed my decision. I urge Trip to keep their hotel details up to date so that other customers are not mislead about what they are paying for.

You can also have a bowl of warm porridge after playing in the evening
It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt reserve a foot bath this time~

The hotel was very clean and the front desk staff was able to translate for me using something like Pocketalk, so I didn't feel anxious at all even though I couldn't speak Chinese or English. It was also very helpful that they gave me two bottles of water every day.

Accessibility to Disney is excellent.
But there's really nothing around.
It's an accommodation that makes you feel like you're trapped in a room, and it's stuffy.
This accommodation is only for those visiting Disneyland.
It cost over 200,000 won per night, but the quality was not good.
The shuttle bus service was convenient.

I recommend leaving early, at 7 am - there are long queues to enter. Officially, the park opened at 8:30, but they let us in earlier; at 8:15 they were definitely letting us through. The hotel's breakfast is average, nothing special, but you won't leave hungry. In the evening the restaurant closes early, so you won't be able to have dinner after the park. But they sell good prepared food in the hall.

The hotel is about a five-minute drive from Disneyland, and there is a bus back to the hotel from Disneyland at 22:30 at the latest. I am very satisfied with the service.

The family room I booked this time has a 2.4-meter large bed, which is suitable for sleeping two adults and one child, or two adults and two children.

I booked a superior king-size room for 685, and paid 90/person for breakfast. Children under 1.2 meters tall have free breakfast. There are shuttle buses to and from Disney and the airport. They have a large bus and a minibus, which run multiple times a day. The hotel is next to the Kangxin Highway on Metro Line 11, and it is only one stop away from Disney, which is very convenient. The hotel is clean and tidy overall, with rich breakfast. The room size is average, but the design is clever, the service is enthusiastic, and there are many free parent-child activities. There are many foreigners in the hotel. At breakfast, I estimated that at least 1/3 of them were Southeast Asians, and the degree of internationalization is high.

I am very grateful to them for exchanging WeChat and helping me when I was in trouble (reserving a shuttle bus, booking a taxi after checking out, providing a toothbrush, using the laundry room, etc.). The cleanliness of the room is not so good, so if you are concerned about it, I think it would be a good idea to bring a quick wipe. The breakfast flavor was Chinese style. To use the washing machine and dryer in the basement, you would need a Chinese phone number, so I asked my older brother to operate it without any problems. It seems better to assume that foreigners who do not have a Chinese phone number cannot use it. There are no shuttle buses at Hongqiao Airport for both T1 and T2, and there seems to be only one shuttle bus to the Bund per day.
I would like to stay again.

In addition, the hotel served us different meals every day at reasonable prices. There is also a convenience store nearby. It is very first-class when going to Disneyland. It's close, but it's quite far to go to and from the city. However, the Wi-Fi reception is a bit difficult. The cleaning service is first-rate. Overall, everything is OK. If I go to Disneyland next time, I will choose this hotel.

If you open the window for ventilation and close the screen, small bugs will come in and bite you. The child is so hot that he keeps kicking the quilt when he sleeps shirtless at night. The soundproofing of the room is very poor. People talking outside can be heard as if they are talking in your room. You can also hear the sound of water in your room when you are taking a shower upstairs. The front desk was even more ridiculous. When I arrived to check in at 8pm, the first person told me to go to the very back to check in. When I got to the very back, the person asked me to go back to the first person to check in. The food delivery robot is also broken, so you need to go downstairs to get the takeaway.

The bed in the room was firm to my liking, but the pillows were not supportive enough. The first round of drinks in the fridge is a bonus. Fortunately, the room faces inward. I think the subway noise from the main road and the wewe sound of passing by at high speed are still very clear.
The shuttle bus to Disney at 9 a.m. on Saturday was so crowded that I had to take a taxi. The return trip from the subway station was about a 5-minute walk.
The breakfast dishes are rich and varied, there are enough seats before 8 o'clock, and there is also a children's dining area. What‚Äôs interesting is that when I ate two mornings, I went out to get food with my children, and the waiters were very diligent in taking everything away, so I had to get new tableware and food. There may be some signs for diners to put on the table. Shows that you are eating or have finished eating.
The facilities in the children's play area are well maintained, but some parents do not take good care of their children. Children should still be careful when playing.

It was very comfortable and allowed us to have a good rest when we were tired. It was a great surprise and touch. There are also many varieties of breakfast, which is enough to replenish your energy. After checking out, we can take the hotel's dedicated bus directly to the airport, eliminating the hassle of transferring to the subway. The gentle ladies at the front desk also gave us grapefruit tea to drink on the way. Although I only stayed for one night, I was able to appreciate the hotel's excellent service.

msg:Overall it's pretty good, but there are a few things that could be improved:
1. The booked room rate includes breakfast for two people. Because the child is over 140 centimeters tall, an additional fee is required. After paying for breakfast for the second day, I found out that the original breakfast fee for booking one day in advance was CNY80.
2. When I checked in on the first day, I learned that breakfast could be packed, but I mistakenly thought it was a self-purchased packed breakfast. That morning, I found that the scheduled breakfast for two only had three buns, pears, and water. I felt that there was a huge gap. When booking the room, the cost of breakfast for two people already exceeded the amount of self-purchased packaged breakfast. It is recommended not to buy additional breakfast.
3. The latest pick-up time at Pudong Airport is only around 1800. Is there any chance to increase the departure time around 2130?

On the last day, we arranged to have breakfast at the hotel, participate in hotel activities and then go to the airport. The hotel informed us that the host of the activity was still on vacation, so he could not participate. I reminded the staff not to put up promotional signs since they could not participate in this activity, otherwise they would mislead our guests and delay their schedules. The staff knew that the promotional signs were still in place when we left the hotel.

The hotel will provide Disney pick-up and drop-off services. The only thing is that vehicles cannot enter the lobby. I don't know what the situation is. Most of the guests go to Disneyland, and the overall service is very attentive. I will consider it again next time I visit!

msg:A particularly pleasant stay.
When traveling to Shanghai during the Spring Festival, the main itinerary is to go to Disneyland for two days. I checked everyone‚Äôs reviews on Ctrip and found that this hotel was convenient and reasonably priced, so I chose to stay at Novotel Clover for four nights. It turned out to be the right choice.
The biggest feature of the hotel is the shuttle bus with a wide range of routes, including those to the Bund, Hongqiao, etc., and the most common ones are to Disneyland. There are many buses and it is extremely convenient. Just taking the shuttle bus can save a lot of time and money.
In addition, it was the Spring Festival during my stay, and I was originally worried that there would be fewer shuttle buses. However, in order to meet the needs of guests, the hotel also added several shuttle bus lines. The hotel concierge and driver staff worked overtime to provide services, which was really touching. .
Moreover, free good night porridge is provided every night. It is really considerate to come back from outside and have a sip of hot porridge in the restaurant on a cold night.
In addition, the hotel also has many activities for children to participate in, as well as small gifts, which are really thoughtful.

msg:Very good check-in experience, very clean, rich and exciting breakfast, every service staff I met has a good sense of service, the bus to and from Disneyland is clean and safe, although I did not take it, because the subway is also really convenient .
Tell me more about this hotel. First of all, the shuttle is really good. Because I was taking my children to Disneyland, I was actually torn between the several hotels for a long time. Factors to consider include whether it is convenient to enter and exit the airport, whether it is convenient to go to the park, the surrounding situation of the hotel, hotel facilities and services, etc. I finally made the decision because I saw that the shuttle bus service was very thoughtfully arranged. It was not just a few trips now and then, but a very complete timetable. It took into account everything from Pudong to Hongqiao and back and forth to the park. There was even a midday trip in the table. Going to the Bund, although I didn't take this ride, I could see that the hotel was very considerate. The pick-up and drop-off cars are very good, clean and tidy, and very reassuring. I think this is very important. The condition of the vehicle and the driver's driving are all very good. When we were sent to the airport, because it was already approaching New Year‚Äôs Eve, it was just our family and we still had a Coaster. Special thanks to the driver, Master Lu, and the concierge Wang, who helped us take our luggage on and off. They were very considerate while driving on the road and arriving at the airport.
Secondly, the breakfast and hotel facilities are also very good. Very clean and prompt service. There are many things that children like for breakfast, such as small cakes, donuts, freshly cooked wontons, freshly made pancakes, etc. Adults and children can eat well. There is a children's playground on the first floor with ocean balls and slides, which many children like very much. The hotel also provides free sanitary socks. Maybe because it is winter, everyone is wearing socks and no one is wearing them, but this detail is very good. The lobby is large and has many seating areas where you can rest while waiting for the bus. There is also a self-service coffee machine, small snacks, black tea, lemonade, milk and sugar for guests to take in the lobby. The overall cleanliness of the hotel is very good, and I enjoyed my stay there.
Again, the whole service concept is very good. There is a dedicated service group for guests arriving at the hotel. The group will notify the bus, catering and other arrangements in detail. Guests' needs will be sent to the group, and the reply will be timely. When I went there, it was quite cold in Shanghai. I asked for an extra quilt and the hotel immediately arranged it. My husband also wanted to add an extra bed the next day. There were no quilts in the hotel, so they provided electric heaters and blankets, which was very considerate. The hotel has many free activities, such as treasure hunting, guessing lantern riddles, etc. There are also special activities that children can participate in by themselves. You can feel that the hotel is very attentive. I also saw some mineral water in the elevator hall on the floor, probably for guests to take. There is no buffet for dinner and lunch, but there is a la carte, the price is acceptable, and the product is pretty good. You don‚Äôt have to worry about lunch and dinner, and there are many takeaway options.
Finally, the hotel location. The hotel is only a seven or eight-minute walk from Xinkang Highway Station on Line 11. It's a stress-free walk with your children. One stop to Disney, even if there is no hotel bus, it is extremely convenient to get back and forth. This time I took the subway. There are many convenience stores in the Disney subway station, 711, FamilyMart, etc., as well as Zhou Hei Ya and Commander Kai. You can buy supplies at the entrance of the park. There is a small supermarket and a beef noodle restaurant downstairs of the hotel, which can also solve some problems. There is also a small depar**ent store in the hotel, which has many Disney peripherals. Opposite the Xinkang Highway subway is the Costco in Pudong. Moms who like to shop can also check it out, but you need a membership cardüôÉüôÉüôÉ
In short, this hotel is very nice, comfortable and convenient to stay in. I hope it will be useful to you.

There is a Costco opening in 2023 right in front of Kangxin Road Station, so you can shop at Costco if you have a Korean membership. I used the food court and bought a gift for a friend at Costco. Breakfast is delicious too
There was a doll claw machine and the kids loved it. The kids loved the free ginger tea service every evening and the coffee, snacks, and candy in the lounge on the first floor.

The service from the staff was excellent. I didn't ask for my name, but I was really grateful to the lady when I checked in. There is a convenience store and a local restaurant in front of the accommodation. The restaurant was clean and cheap, so we used it twice in 2 nights. I think you can enjoy egg fried rice and tomato egg rice bowl without any hesitation.

I stayed for 2 nights and moved to the Pudong area and stayed for 2 nights.
My whole family highly recommended Novotel.
It was easy to travel by shuttle bus and everyone was friendly so I experienced the best service. I would like to visit again.

First of all, when I made a reservation, I made a note that I wanted a quiet room, but I ended up getting a room next to the subway, which was extremely noisy. Don‚Äôt even think about going to bed before 12pm! No rest at all!
Let‚Äôs talk about hygiene: the room looks clean on the surface, but the details are dirty. The paper towel box in the bathroom was very dirty. After using the paper towels, I opened the box and was shocked to see a lot of dust and flakes at the bottom. No wonder when I took out the paper towels, a lot of dust and lint flew out and floated in the air. There are videos and photos to prove it. .

The most dissatisfied thing is that the front desk service is very poor! After ordering takeout, the boy put the things on the table at the front desk. The robot was next to it. There was a row of staff sitting at the front desk, all sitting there, no one in charge. We went downstairs to get it ourselves and asked why they didn't deliver the food. The front desk actually said "I don't know, I didn't see it" which was really annoying! Even if you don't deliver meals, you should at least call the room and tell us to pick them up, right? The takeaway food on a cold day is sitting there and it‚Äôs getting cold! Are you going to let people eat cold food? unacceptable! After staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I encountered one that didn‚Äôt deliver meals!

On rainy days, the hotel also provides ginger tea and porridge in the evening, which is very considerate and good! You can still swim in the summer. The heating in the room is very good. Open the window at night. It's neither cold nor hot. It's comfortable to sleep!

msg:The best hotel near Disney! ! ! The room environment is countless times better than that of Toy Story. The pick-up and drop-off service at Hongqiao Station saves a lot of travel costs. The most important thing is that the hotel service really considers the guests. After watching the fireworks, it rained heavily. In order to prevent guests from waiting in the rain, the hotel uses running water. The last bus waits until the next one arrives before leaving, ensuring that everyone can wait on the bus. This is very difficult for guests who have been soaking wet and walked for more than ten minutes in the heavy rain. , I was really moved, especially compared to the figure standing in the rain at the Courtyard Hotel next to me. Users will vote with their feet and will stay at Disney hotels in the future, with no other option!

msg:I used to come to Courtyard every year because the overall floor of Courtyard was low and I was afraid of the noise. I accidentally saw that Clover and Courtyard had the same shuttle bus to the Bund. It was a cooperative company. It should be of similar quality, so I thought I would give it a try. I booked a high-rise Clever Hotel not far away. I didn't dare to book cheap standard rooms or superior rooms. I booked a deluxe room. I specially prepared a quiet room. The hotel upgraded me to the elegant family room on the 12th floor as requested. The room is not facing the street and is very quiet. Thank you. The doorman was very enthusiastic when we entered. He helped us carry our luggage and led the way. The front desk also answered questions seriously and patiently, and the process was very fast. I commended the customer service on the 12th floor for helping me find a luggage rack. They helped me get the room as soon as they saw me. On the first day, I said they would only collect garbage and add mineral water, but not the rest. On the second and third day, I called She helped to clean up the trash. She remembered my habits and came to help me tidy up immediately. She was very kind, smiling and polite, and she worked quickly. The young man in charge of booking the shuttle bus was also very nice. He made the appoin**ent to go to the Bund and called in advance to confirm the notification to avoid delays. The same goes for the shuttle bus driver, who will confirm again after we get on the bus to prevent guests from getting on the wrong bus. They work seriously and responsibly. The restaurant prepares free heart-warming porridge from 21 to 23 o'clock in the evening. I really understand the hearts of mothers. I took my children to have dinner at Disneyland at 7 or 8 o'clock and then started playing. When I returned to the hotel, the children were hungry. Ordering takeout takes time. Secondly, we didn‚Äôt know much about the surroundings, and we were afraid of not being able to eat well and spoiling the children. So every night we went back to the hotel to have a bowl of porridge in the restaurant, and then went back to the room to take a shower and go to bed. It was really reassuring and heart-warming porridge! There is a coffee machine in the lobby, free coffee and some snacks, which can replenish your energy while waiting for the shuttle bus. There are also various handicrafts, lantern riddle guessing, and searching activities prepared for children. Children will not be bored while waiting for their mother to pack their luggage and check out. The hotel has a small butler group, and it is very convenient to help reserve the shuttle bus after joining the group. There is a baby stroller rental in the lobby on the first floor, which is very convenient. I used to rent Disney strollers, which were shallow and small and difficult to use for children to put things on. Now I rent a big one directly from the hotel, which is very convenient for putting things, and after getting off the shuttle bus It‚Äôs a long way to go, and there is a huge amount of people during the winter vacation. You have to walk around the lake for a long time before entering. Push the kids as soon as you get off the bus. You won‚Äôt regret it. I rented one and used it for several days. I haven‚Äôt refunded it since, it‚Äôs 120 a day, the price is actually cheaper than what‚Äôs sold by the vendors at the door. On the day before I left, I originally wanted to go to Disney Town to eat at Donald Duck Restaurant, but I was so satisfied with the hotel that I decided to eat at the restaurant on the first floor. The various Western-style set meals were also good. Next time I come to Disneyland, I will stay at Novotel Live. I will recommend it to my friends. It‚Äôs really good.

It only takes about ten minutes to get to Disneyland by taxi. It‚Äôs also very convenient to take the subway. It‚Äôs only about five or six minutes‚Äô walk away. When I arrived at the subway station, the guy at the front desk upgraded my room type. I only brought a mobile phone charging cable and found that the interface of the room cable was not easy to use. The housekeeper sent me a charging head for free without requiring a deposit. The hotel arranged for many children to play activities. Children can Players can take a rest here. The hotel delivers some drinks in the refrigerator for free every day. The room is clean and the hotel also has a robot food delivery service. There are many supermarkets around the hotel that are very convenient for shopping and ordering takeout. Overall, the hotel is very cost-effective and I will stay here again next time I come to Disneyland.

msg:It's particularly good. From the hardware point of view, the hotel is high-end, clean and tidy. From the software point of view, the various considerate services make people feel happy. There is a children's play area, a handmade area for older children, an independent beverage machine, and a small shop. You can go shopping. When you arrive at the store, there will be staff to help you with your luggage and guide you to the lobby to check in. After checking in, you can book a shuttle service if you join the hotel group. You can order takeout in the room. There are robots that can deliver meals. There are also various drinks in the room. You can drink for free, the bathroom partitions are clean and tidy, and the bedding is soft and comfortable. We stayed for three days in total. The room was cleaned every day when we came back. There was heart-warming porridge to drink every day when we came back. It is also close to the subway. It is very convenient to go back and forth to Disney, the airport and train station, and book directly in the group and take the hotel shuttle bus at the door. The hotel also has various types of strollers to choose from. There are also New Year activities. You can win small gifts by participating in guessing lantern riddles. Make suggestions and implement them immediately. Everywhere you go, every staff member provides professional, considerate, warm and thoughtful service, which is great. You must also order breakfast, which is rich in variety, clean and delicious. In fact, I saw some bad reviews online before I made the reservation, so I was a little hesitant. After I arrived, I found that this is a hotel that listens to advice. I didn‚Äôt notice any of the negative reviews online. Instead, the hotel provides a QR code for you to fill in suggestions for improvement. , for a small gift, I casually filled in a request for a child's footstool. I filled it out at one or two o'clock at night, and the staff sent it to me at eight o'clock the next morning. The response was so fast that I felt that this was someone who listened carefully. Guests commented that this hotel provides professional services attentively, so I must give it a good review. I have stayed in hotels of various types and prices in the past, and I just wrote a positive review for the sake of cash rebates or small gifts. This time, I voluntarily wrote a positive review for this hotel. I am so satisfied with their professional service that I took the time to write it. With this good review, I think all hotels in China should learn from this hotel. This hotel feels to me like Haidilao among hotels. It deserves encouragement and good reviews.

msg:It is recommended to stay here when taking children to Disney. It is the best value for money. Large chain hotels are more stable and guaranteed in quality than B&Bs. The hotel has shuttle buses to the airport, train station, Bund, and Disney. It is very convenient to book at least one day in advance. After watching the fireworks from Disneyland and taking the bus back to the hotel in the evening, there was free good night porridge, which was quite thoughtful. The hotel is very close to the subway station, and is only one subway stop away from Disney. On the first night of my stay, I took the subway to Disney Town to buy some peripherals. The next day, I was fully equipped to go play Disney. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, answer all questions, and are also very friendly to children. The hotel also arranges children's activities with different themes every day. After breakfast on the last day, I put the children in the activity center to do crafts with the teacher. I went back to the room to pack my luggage. It was great! It is worth mentioning that they also provide luggage delivery service when leaving the hotel, that is, you can go out for fun, and they will transport your luggage to the airport, train station, or other hotels at your next stop in Shanghai. However, it rained on the day I left the hotel. , I didn‚Äôt arrange other activities, so I didn‚Äôt experience this service. Please consult the hotel if you need it. All in all, travel friendly. There are two shortcomings: first, the lighting in the room and bathroom is not bright enough, especially in the bathroom, which makes it inconvenient for women to put on makeup; second, the function of switching the shower head between high and low faucets is not easy to operate. It would be better if there is a chance to improve. All in all, it is a hotel I would recommend and stay at again.

msg:I took my kids to Disneyland and chose this hotel, but I was so disappointed.
1. The underground parking lot is very small and shabby.
2. The service attitude at the front desk can only be said to be average. There was no greeting or smile. It just felt very businesslike.
3. I asked for a quieter room in advance, but I was given a room opposite and at the end of the linen room. It was very noisy in the morning and I didn't sleep well.
4. The room is very small, just a standard room with an extra bed.
The air conditioner in the room was turned off, but there still seemed to be hot air and it was very stuffy.
5. The sink in the bathroom is a bit blocked, it is difficult to drain the water, and the countertop is very small.
6. The water was not hot on the first day of bathing and was extremely hot on the second day. The spray head even fell off during the shower, which shocked me.
7. The robot does not deliver takeout, so I need to go downstairs to get it from the takeout counter at the door. I can only take a shower and put on a coat. Fortunately, it is not cold.
8. The wardrobe is very small and narrow, and can only hang two coats.
9. There are too few items for breakfast. For example, the side dishes to accompany the porridge are only salted eggs and preserved eggs, not even pickles and fermented bean curd. However, the wontons are quite deliciousüòã
10. There was no program on the TV. I called the main station and got a reply right away. However, during my two-day stay, no one came to repair it.
Overall, there are too many things to complain about. It's not like a five-star hotel at all. I'm sorry for the price and the brand.

msg:Staying in a family room for the first time, my first impression is that the room is very big, with a large bed, a wide single bed, and a sofa. It feels like it can accommodate 4 people. The heating in the room is fully turned on, so there is no need to worry about the temperature. On the contrary, because the temperature is too high, the air conditioner is a bit loud, so I have to turn it off to sleep at night. It is thoughtfully equipped with children's utensils and decorated with a Disney a**osphere, which the children like very much. The breakfast includes Shanghai wontons, noodle soup, pancakes and other snacks, which are affordable and comfortable. If you want to go to Disneyland early, you can also book a package in advance. There is even mouthwash in the package box. I have to admire the hotel's thoughtfulness. The hotel's shuttle bus to Disneyland is also a highlight. It starts at 5:45. Taking full account of the need to get up early to enter the park, the evening shuttle bus also runs from 8:00 to 10:30. There are people in the butler group who can answer questions and make arrangements at any time. It's very comfortable to stay here. I will choose this place next time I go to Disney. The only drawback is that it is close to the subway station, so the side closer to the subway operation time will be a bit noisy. Don't worry about the inconvenience of shopping. There is a convenience store and a small restaurant across the street downstairs.

The reason was that the previous guests had to meet their request for late check-out, but the late check-out Isn‚Äôt the room adjusted based on the occupancy situation? Since the room is full, why do we have to accommodate the later guests in order to meet the needs of the front guests? Fortunately, after I asked the question, I called the manager and solved it quickly. I personally feel that the hotel is in a park, because it is quite close to the subway. Taking the subway to and from Disneyland is much closer than driving in the parking lot. The breakfast is not bad, although the place Not too big but very rich and many are freshly made. Overall it‚Äôs good. I will consider it in the future.

The hotel has its own customer maintenance group, and any problems can be solved through timely communication. I am very satisfied!

msg:First of all, check-in at the hotel was very slow. The room was so small that the phone was placed on the floor. And it's right next to the high-speed rail, so don't even think about sleeping until the high-speed rail stops running. Very noisy.

Secondly, I went with a friend, and her order was cheaper. I forgot to return mine (this is indeed my fault). I negotiated with the hotel that I did not stay in this order, and no service or cleaning fees were incurred. At the same time, the hotel Checked in directly without any reminder. Is it possible to refund part of the unincurred charges? The hotel said that it is not possible. I asked for an upgrade, and the hotel said they could inform the general manager. I asked when the result would be available. She just said: He is on vacation. (Just these four words, not a single other word.)

Absolutely, a hotel does not have a complete solution first of all. The way to solve the problem is that the general manager is on vacation? Are you wasting customers like this? Is there no one else in charge? This is the first time I have experienced such a service, serving customers with such a condescending attitude?

Service: I ordered takeout, but no robot came. I called the front desk and asked the robot to deliver it. The front desk agreed, but turned around and did nothing. After almost half an hour, I went downstairs to get it myself, and found that the robot was there. In the lobby, there were no other takeout orders being delivered. The front desk‚Äôs explanation was that they didn‚Äôt know the room number and didn‚Äôt know who to call back? ? ? (Really doubtful) I mentioned the room number when I called, and the call was made from the room's landline.
In addition, the room was set up to do not disturb, but the cleaning lady ignored it and went directly to clean it.
Facilities: The sheets have holes, the wallpaper is lifted, the shower drain drains very slowly, and the lights are dim.
All in all, the hotel hardware and software are far from the star standards as written.

It is convenient to provide a shuttle bus from the hotel to Disneyland and Pudong Airport. 
There is a subway station just 400m away, making it convenient to get to downtown Shanghai. 
And there is a Costco across from the subway station, so you can shop and enjoy meals with your Korean Costco membership card. 

The downside is that it is a bit far from the center of Shanghai or the Bund. 
The downside is that it takes a long time to travel. 

If you are a Disney Land customer, there is free transportation.

However, I have to say that the hotel cleaning staff saw that there was no suitable place to dry our laundry, so they gave us a triangular clothes hanger, which was very considerate. So a little suggestion is to install a retractable clothesline in the bathroom.

We were upgraded to a deluxe twin room, with a south-facing room on each floor. Isn't that nonsense? The room was small and the bed was small. What kind of upgrade was it? In the end, it was changed to an ordinary room. The minibar only had a bottle of water, a bottle of Sprite, a bottle of Coke, and a bottle of Watsons sparkling water.

msg:Lightning protection, lightning protection, lightning protection! After traveling so many times, this is the first time I have stayed in such a hot hotel! We decided to go to Disneyland Commando this weekend from the 17th to the 19th (Friday to Sunday) in early November. After several considerations, we finally chose the "Novotel Shanghai Clover Hotel" which is only one subway stop away from Shangdi. ‚Äù, we saw photos and some reviews of this hotel and it is indeed pretty good (I don‚Äôt know if the hotel has bad reviews). So we were full of joy and booked a deluxe twin room and a superior king room on the Ctrip app on November 7. At this time, there were still 10 days before we checked into the hotel, and the hotel also sent us a check-in confirmation order message. However, when we arrived at the hotel to check in on November 17, the front desk informed us that the rooms were fully booked for two days this weekend and there were no rooms we reserved. At that time, we were full of exhaustion and anger. Because we had caught a flight after work, it was almost 12pm when we arrived at the hotel. What we wanted most at this time was to have a good rest, not to mention we had to get up early the next day, but we encountered such a situation. A speechless incident. The front desk told us that the occupancy rate on weekends was higher than on weekdays. When they found out that the rooms on the website (third-party booking platform) were sold out, they had no time to notify them (since you have discovered the problem, haven't you discussed the solution)? They had to downgrade our room type and even ask us to stay in a so-called superior twin room at the original market price.
What makes us angry is: First of all, we did not book a hotel at short notice. We made the reservation 10 days in advance. The hotel did not confirm and reserve the reservation information in detail. When it was found that there was no room, it did not call the customer in advance (the hotel The front desk said there was no contact information for the guests staying there, which is really funny. It‚Äôs already 2023. Since the hotel has cooperated with a third-party platform, would there be no customer contact information? It also blamed us for not booking the room using their official APP. , now there must be a lot of people using travel software like Ctrip to book hotels.) Hotels are a service-oriented industry. If even the most basic service attitude is not good, how can they serve the public? Secondly, when we checked in, they told us this ridiculous reason. The service attitude was still very poor. The hotel gave us a solution: let us downgrade the room type and give us a so-called breakfast and dinner. We made it clear that our purpose of coming to Shanghai was to go to Disney, so the hotel‚Äôs breakfast and dinner opening hours were not useful to us. We communicated with the hotel: We can accept the downgrade of the room type, but at least give us realistic compensation. After all, the problem was caused by the hotel's mistake but we are asked to accept unrealistic results. Is there such a forced buying and selling these days? We don't need the so-called breakfast and dinner at all. We just want the hotel to compensate for the room fee. They seem to compromise, but the actual price they offer is the same as the price of the same room type on the Ctrip app (which means they have no sincerity at all). We have the right to reject reasonable plans, right? Is this an attitude of offering compensation? The front desk of the hotel even acted like you can't help but accept this plan, or cancel the order and make another choice (please, it's past midnight, it's too outrageous to ask us to make a new choice). Later, we called the Ctrip customer service platform to complain and reported the actual situation to the platform (and also informed the platform of the plan provided by the hotel). The hotel still acted like you can complain and there is nothing I can do. It really made me feel sorry for the hotel front desk. The service attitude of this customer service staff was eye-opening. Later, we saw with our own eyes that the Ctrip platform called the hotel to communicate with the hotel. The hotel front desk staff also had an impatient attitude, as if we were making trouble unreasonably? What's even more outrageous is that the male waiter at the hotel front desk asked us what we complained to the platform. The platform not only demanded compensation from us but also demanded that the hotel compensate the platform. Didn't we look confident just now? Moreover, we only stated objective facts and did not add any exaggeration to say some non-objective facts. This is really annoying. After some negotiation, we asked the hotel to let us book a superior twin room at a price of 500 per night. The hotel front desk (male attendant) also agreed and asked us to cancel the order on the Ctrip platform. We asked him to book it for us first. Canceled the order (otherwise they didn‚Äôt book a room for me after we canceled it, so I would have to sleep on the street at night), and he didn‚Äôt state that it couldn‚Äôt be done or that there would be discrepancies in the system, etc., but he directly used the excuse that he couldn‚Äôt handle it. We need to find their so-called manager (she is a girl) to handle it. When the manager came, he said that their hotel's superior twin room does not have a price of 500/night. (Please don't you two negotiate clearly? Sometimes you agree and sometimes you firmly say no. There may be such a price. Is your hotel kidding you? And can you figure out that it was your mistake that caused us to have no room to stay at after 12 o'clock in the morning? We were forced to argue with you. We don't want your breakfast and dinner. What's the problem with room fee compensation for this?); Later, we were also tired, because the only rooms left in the Superior Twin Room were on the second and third floors. Our sisters who were traveling with us did not want to live on a lower floor, so we asked for a room on a higher floor. King bed room. The manager said that we would be upgraded to a Zhiya double room, which is on the 16th floor of the top floor. The price is still based on the price booked on our platform. It is really far from Dapu. Since it was too late, we really didn‚Äôt have the energy to talk to the hotel. We also I can only accept it temporarily.
One thing to say, the attitude of the Ctrip platform is still very good. After we complained, we still gave us good feedback, and the platform also gave us 200 yuan in compensation. When we compared the superior double room originally booked by our sisters, it was no different than our so-called upgraded Zhiya double room. Even our room was smaller. After comparing the prices, we were still at least 200 more expensive than them. The hotel really does a good job of deceiving customers. There really is no lower limit. Surprisingly, a hotel like this is owned by Huazhuhui. We have stayed in Huazhuhui hotels several times. Are you sure this one is not a fake one? Really? It's so rubbish.
In addition, we made a reservation for the hotel's additional service - Disney car transfer. We made the reservation two days in advance. Due to our personal reasons (because we were still arguing with the hotel the night before) we did get up late, but there was no phone notification. The hotel was Are you providing additional services like this? There aren‚Äôt even the most basic reminder notifications. So what‚Äôs the point of making an appoin**ent? We bought several couriers in advance and sent them to the hotel. The hotel actually had a storage disorder and couldn't find the couriers. The couriers from the sisters who were traveling with us could not be found. As a result, the couriers came to find them by themselves and found them all at once. The service staff Is pre-job training really passed the test? It‚Äôs true that this hotel has been in trouble all my life. I strongly discourage all the sisters who are planning to book this hotel. I step on the thunder in tears and protect the sisters from the thunder. Why should I spend money to be treated like this! If you can persuade one to quit, that‚Äôs one!

Service: Not even one star, very bad!

There are many shuttle buses to and from Disney, so be sure to make a reservation. When I returned to the hotel with my baby alone, I thought there were no shuttle buses. I was surrounded by black cars and heard bad words. I felt terrible. I took my baby and parked at Donald Duck. I ran around and caught the 10 o'clock bus.
It is recommended that there are more seats for going back and forth to Hongqiao on weekends. The bus reservations for Saturday and Sunday are no longer available. When I asked, I found out that there are only half a bus with 20 people in one bus.

You can have it as a buffet at the restaurant or they package it so you can eat it in your room. It was good. There was a coffee maker at the reception, so it was great to have a take-out cup in the morning, and it was convenient to use the free shuttle bus to Shanghai Disneyland and Pudong Airport. However, because the designated time slots were not varied, I used a taxi to go to the airport, but I had a lot of luggage and luggage, so it was nice that the hotel called a large taxi (van) directly. ‚ò∫

Because it is relatively close to Disneyland and there are shuttle buses to and from multiple places, there are many people checking in. At this price, it is better to stay in an express hotel. Obviously, the price of an express hotel is close to that of an interstellar hotel. The shuttle bus is also hard to explain. The ambient air is extremely bad. Many people are coughing.

The front desk house manager is very good, but the front desk staff is not professional enough and needs to be improved. They are not warm and polite enough. The guy who checked in didn't smile at all and was not polite. Secondly, the girl at the front desk who checked in during check-out also had a very bad attitude and tone of voice. I originally wanted to extend my stay because it was too late to go to Disneyland and I ended up going somewhere else. The place was no longer convenient. She didn‚Äôt even look at it. She refused to extend her stay in a very bad tone. Another intern girl came over and told her that other room types seemed to be available. She just didn‚Äôt hear it. Later she saw it on Ctrip There are also rooms that can be reserved. Thinking about the poor service attitude, I decided to go to another hotel no matter how tired I was.

msg:I am very dissatisfied with the hotel I booked this time. The specific reasons are as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£The light in the room is very dark: there is not a single decent light in the whole room, all are small light sources with extremely weak light when hanging from the ceiling. I wanted to look in the full-length mirror, but it was so dark that I couldn't see anything clearly, including the toilet. If you were a girl, it was very difficult to put on makeup.
2Ô∏è‚É£The noise is very loud: We were assigned to the top floor on the 16th floor. Even though we had turned off the air conditioner, there was still a buzzing sound similar to the exhaust fan. It made it difficult to fall asleep at night and I had to wear noise-canceling headphones. After contacting the front desk staff, they concluded that it was a radar sound and there was no way to turn it off. This answer is very perfunctory. It is really incredible that a hotel can have continuous noise. I had to go to Disneyland the next day, so I couldn't sleep well and was very tired all day long.
3Ô∏è‚É£The hotel landline is almost unusable: Because I was woken up by the noise in the early morning, I wanted to contact the front desk through the hotel's fixed landline to inquire about the situation. I tried many times, but either there was no response when I pressed the button, or the AI ‚Äã‚Äãturned on after being connected. In short, I couldn't contact the front desk. Finally, it took me many attempts to get through.
4Ô∏è‚É£It is difficult to adjust the hot water temperature in the bathroom: whether you turn left or right, all the hot water comes out is very hot. I still don‚Äôt know if the faucet in this hotel has cold water.
5Ô∏è‚É£ After the Do Not Disturb signal was turned off in the room, the aunt still came in to clean the room and even lost the toilet seat we brought. Moreover, the toilet seat provided by the hotel does not match the hotel toilet and cannot be fitted at all, which is outrageous.

To sum up, I hope everyone will carefully consider whether to book this hotel after reading this comment. This hotel ruined our Disney trip.

The concierge responded promptly, saying there was a traffic jam, and came quickly. At least he could give an answer in time.

Check-in took more than 20 minutes. The lights in the room were so dim that I couldn't even see my makeup. To clear myself up, I had to use my mobile phone to shine the light. The windows seemed not to be closed, and I felt the wind from outside blowing in. There was obviously a very convenient entrance and exit at the entrance of the hotel, but the online car-hailing car was not allowed to enter, so it required a long detour. , only taxis can enter, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none

However, the response to all services was very timely. I think it is the best choice among hotels around Disney that can meet my needs. I really want to give this hotel Thumbs up for the front desk and concierge service. I didn't know that I booked a room in the middle of the night because I didn't know that I had booked a different room type for two days. The front desk helped me solve the mistake without pointing out my mistake. It was a considerate service and it was very convenient to and from the airport, Disney and the Bund. It is highly recommended to stay here. , I was also recommended by my colleagues.

msg:Every time I go to Disneyland, I stay in a park hotel. This time I wanted to try a nearby hotel. I chose this hotel between Courtyard and Novotel. Although it is an Accor brand, it is operated by Huazhu Group in China. The location is a little further than the Courtyard, and it's easy to find on the street. Call the hotel in advance to apply for a Ctrip Diamond Card upgrade to a room type. The lobby is very large, and the front desk is a zigzag-shaped long table area. Check-in is relatively smooth. The concierge provides rental strollers, but the price is slightly more expensive than in the park. The room is relatively compact and can be difficult to spread out if you have children. There is a warm porridge service in the evening, with different styles every day. In the morning, you can drink freshly ground coffee from the coffee machine. It is a value-added service, not bad. What I need to complain about is that it is too inconvenient to enter the hotel. The street entrance next to the gate is blocked by the property management. Online car hailing is not allowed. Otherwise, you have to take a detour. The driver is unwilling, or you have to go by yourself next time on the roadside and take the children. It is really inconvenient to carry a stroller. I didn‚Äôt experience the airport pick-up service because the time was not right, but it was really nice to have the airport pick-up and drop-off service to Hongqiao Airport. The park shuttle bus is very convenient, especially at night when there are many buses.

The decoration style of the hotel's front desk is a bit like a library, and guests can also sit and check in, which is good. The room is quite big and clean, and the hot water is very comfortable. There is a convenience store downstairs in the hotel, which is very convenient for buying breakfast and snacks. Every time I come here, I go to Disneyland. I get up early in the morning and come back very late with the early access card, so I don‚Äôt have the chance to try other hotel facilities and services. However, I will choose this hotel next time.

There is a free shuttle bus to Disney and a shuttle bus to Pudong Airport. I was worried that the shuttle to Pudong Airport wasn't on time because my flight was too early, but the staff even made a Tidi (taxi) reservation for me. Thank you to the friendly staff.^^

Both the hotel and the rooms are very clean.
Two free small water bottles are provided in the room. There is also a water heater in the room.

The location is convenient as there is a convenience store right next to the hotel. You can go to Shanghai Disneyland by free shuttle bus. When using the subway, it is convenient as it takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the nearest station. The downside is that when you go from the station to the hotel at night, there are few street lights and it's dark, so you might feel a little anxious.

When using the shuttle bus from Shanghai Disneyland back to the hotel, the bus stops around number 6 of Donald Parking, but there are many buses with Novotel printed on them. There seem to be several other Novotel hotels, so it's a little hard to find. We recommend that you prepare a piece of paper or an image with the hotel name written in Chinese in advance, and show it to the driver before boarding to confirm the destination.

It was said to be a suite, but it turned out to be a corner room the size of a standard room. I was really speechless. Asked to change room again. The service after that is still responsive. When we left, we were told that there was a free shuttle bus to the train station and that we needed to book it one day in advance, but when we made the reservation, we were told that there were no seats available.

I did not expect to give me a very big surprise. The hotel arranges shuttles to two airports in Shanghai, as well as Disney shuttles, with many shifts. The hotel lobby is high-end and upscale. The key is that from the concierge at the door to the staff in the lobby, the service is very professional and enthusiastic.
The room configuration is also very good, the bedding is comfortable, the air conditioner is powerful, and the shower water pressure is also very strong. I heard from the waiter that the city government stipulates that disposable items cannot be placed in the room, for the sake of environmental protection, but you can ask the waiter to deliver them. I called several times to ask for things, and the lady in the guest room took the trouble and delivered them right away. The service is excellent, great! I stayed alone and went shopping in the hotel at night. I didn't expect that there is a very beautiful swimming pool, children's play area, and the items in the gift shop are also very beautiful and authentic. I had a good rest that day, and I went to Disneyland the next day, and it took 10 minutes to get there by bus. have a good time. When checking out, there is also a complimentary iced drink to take with you on the way. Although I only stayed for one day, the overall feeling is very good! If a friend goes to Disney or I go next time, I will stay in this hotel again.

The surrounding area is very close to Disney, but the hotel is located in an industrial area, which is not very prosperous. However, there are some convenience stores and beef noodle shops in the industrial area, and the surrounding area is also an industrial area. The disadvantage is that it is a bit noisy next to the light rail, but if you go to Disneyland, no one will be able to sleep. I am really tired from playing.
Room, the room is a bit small, but overall it is very considerate. The parent-child suite has a tent and dolls, and the children like it very much. The children's toiletries are still complete.
Hotel facilities, the hotel has a small playground, children can also play around for a while. There is a swimming pool but it is said to be open in the summer. There is a restaurant and the breakfast buffet is okay. A la carte lunch and dinner, and free porridge for midnight snacks. It's pretty good, right?
For other facilities, the hotel's Disney shuttle is also very good and very convenient. The hotel has strollers for rent, both single and double. If you have children going to Disney, it is highly recommended to rent one. The quality is very good and the price is cheaper than inside and outside Disney.
Service needs special mention. The hotel's service is quite good. Special thanks to Xiao Wang and Xiao Yang from the concierge depar**ent for helping us carry our luggage.

When you turn it on, the network connection is abnormal. The hotel's WIFI is also terrible. It took about 10 minutes to connect before I could do the identity verification. After the verification, the Internet speed was extremely slow. When I browsed NetEase News, pictures often failed to appear.
When checking in, the front desk will prompt you if you need toiletries, but it will not prompt you that there is no shampoo and shower gel in the room. And the most embarrassing thing is that if you don't provide them, don't leave empty bottles in the bathroom. You have to wait until you start taking a shower to find out whether they are available. Shampoo and body wash.
In the Doraemon main room for 4 people, the two Doraemon and Doraemon dolls on the bed have not been cleaned for an unknown period of time. They are extremely dusty and dirty.
I will never dare to book this hotel again when I go to Disneyland in the future. I am exhausted after a day of playing, and I have to deal with all kinds of pitfalls when I get back to the hotel.

1. The hotel's hygienic condition is average. After entering the room, I stepped on chewing gum and the floor became sticky.
2 Then I chose the late check-out service on Ctrip. I also made this request to the front desk when I checked in, but I got a call at 12 noon to urge me to check out.
3. The service is inhumane. We stayed for 2 nights. We didn't have breakfast on the first night because we had an early access card to go to Disneyland. The next day, I asked if I could let the children eat for free today since I didn‚Äôt have breakfast yesterday. The child, who is 137cm tall, refused mercilessly, so I didn‚Äôt say much. After all, it was us who didn‚Äôt have a meal on the first day. , so I paid 45 yuan.
We went to Beijing last summer and stayed at the Novotel Heping for 4 nights. We didn't have to make up the difference, which was good.

I thought I would just stay there for one night and take the subway to Disneyland the day before. We walked around the town, only shopping, and on the second day we just did not go to the shops. As a result, on the first day, there was a bus from the hotel to the park, and we could pick you up when we came back. There was also heart-warming porridge in the evening, and there was also a bus to the airport.

Very close to the subway station. We mainly go to Disneyland. The hotel has a free shuttle bus. The one-way trip takes about 10 minutes. One stop on the subway is faster. The guest service is really excellent, any of your requests will be responded to immediately.

The hotel has free buses to Disneyland, Hongqiao Airport, Pudong Airport, etc. Just make a reservation in advance. The check-in and check-out procedures were very fast, and they thoughtfully prepared small slippers for the children. It was a great experience. I forgot to take photos.

When I visited again around 6:30, they showed an irresponsible attitude and said that they could not now fulfill the request made two months ago, and there was no compensation at all. It wasn't an attitude of trying to solve the problem somehow or expressing apologies for the hotel's carelessness, but an attitude of saying that there was nothing we could do and that you should understand. The room I checked into late was not stocked with shower gel, so I requested it over the phone, but communication in English was difficult. This is a hotel where English is barely spoken, and it would have been difficult to even check in if no one in the group could speak Chinese. I was very disappointed by the attitude of the staff who answered in Chinese even when I spoke to them in English while holding out my passport. There isn't even an effort to bring in English-speaking staff to cater to foreign customers.

The front desk ordered a thermometer and it took about ten minutes to arrive. After confirming the fever, they ordered antipyretics and modified the order. After explaining the reason, they refunded me the second one. Late booking. I think the service is okay. I checked in late and only had a room close to the light rail. It was on the 10th floor. I thought the soundproofing was okay and not too noisy. Also, my child had a fever that day, so I fell asleep late, and no cars passed by. When checking in, the little brother also said that he could change it for me tomorrow. But after I checked out, he called me to confirm that the service was still in contact. The good night porridge provided tastes good, but you need to dine in. I didn‚Äôt even take the hotel shuttle this time. It seemed quite convenient to join the group. It's relatively close to the subway station. It takes about five or six minutes to walk. The bedding is also good. Disposable toilet mats are also provided. I don't need to use the ones I brought.

The service staff are conscientious and responsive, and they will do everything for the guests without request. The room attendant saw how thoughtful our laundry was and brought us a three-dimensional clothes drying rack. Special thanks! There are also a lot of breakfast varieties, the wontons and noodles are very delicious, and I haven't gotten tired of eating for four consecutive days. When checking out, the front desk also sent homemade sour plum soup. Anyway, there are all kinds of good and thoughtful things, and I will come back to stay next time I come to Disney

1 Transportation, close to the subway, 500 meters away, close to Disney, very convenient. Because the subway station is closer to the Disney entrance than the taxi gate.
2. The facilities and environment are average. You will be disappointed on the first day. There are no places to eat around. The hotel has very few meals. It is difficult to order meals that you are satisfied with when you bring your baby. The facilities in the big bed room are relatively simple, and the table is not big. Then I asked the front desk where I could go to eat and shop. The front desk was not very familiar with it, and the occupants were confused.
3 Hygiene and service, good, there is no so-called hair on the sheets and pillows, and there is no black fluff. The sanitation is relatively clean, thanks to the waiter for the drying rack and water for me. Human care compensates for the sense of loss on the first day of check-in
4. Breakfast is a plus item, rich and delicious, clean and hygienic, the last one is the key point
5. Baby carriages are charged. There are a small number of free baby carriages. Generally, you can‚Äôt rent them. Don‚Äôt be misled by other people‚Äôs evaluations.

The best thing is that it is super close to Disney, and there is a convenient shuttle bus. Don't be too considerate. Especially the masters of the shuttle bus will take the initiative to help carry the boxes. Give the bus master Zhang a name and praise. 4. The restaurant also looks very goodüëå We were not able to enjoy the food in the restaurant due to our tight schedule. 5. The hotel actually has a special counter selling Switch, which is too cute. 6. The lady at the concierge was super enthusiastic. When we arrived at the pick-up station, we repeated the video to confirm that our location was correct and there was a shuttle bus time. very warm. 7. It is very close to Bicester Shopping Village, the best shopping option around. 8. There are several convenience stores in front of the hotel, which is very convenient. Summary: It is definitely the first choice hotel for coming to Shanghai Disneyland‚ù§Ô∏è

Environment: The lobby is quite big, and a small playground is okay to play
Facilities: There are free coffee machines and snacks in the lobby, and free porridge in the evening, in the restaurant
Service: The service is really speechless. The room has not been cleaned at almost 3 o'clock. I said that it will delay my check-in. The other party said that I can delay the check-out, but not all guests need to delay it! I need to check in on time
Then I went shopping with my mother at Kaishike, and saw that it was written at the entrance of the supermarket that you can get a 5% discount at the restaurant of this hotel with the customer membership card. If we were lucky, we would miss a breakfast, so we went to ask the restaurant, and the restaurant said I have to go to the front desk to buy it, but the front desk said to go to the restaurant to buy it! In the end, I told me that you can't use 5% off for breakfast, you can only order food! I'm speechless! Can you be more professional! The service attitude of this store will never come again!

msg:Facilities: The reserved twin room can be shared, enough for two or two to take a nap. The room service is good, and the caller came in a timely manner. The minibar in the room will provide some free Coke Sprite juice every night.

Location: Very close to Disney, there is a shuttle bus to and from. We took a taxi back and forth, and we arrived in about ten minutes. It is especially suitable to get up early in the morning to enjoy the ticket. It is not far from the subway station Line 11, and it is also convenient to go to the city.


Service: The quality of the waiters varies, and some are very considerate. I commend the little girl at the concierge at the front desk for helping us receive the express delivery and patiently helping us dismantle it and take care of it. But when I came back from Disney at night and met a waiter, it was very special. It is a good thing to provide love porridge here at night. But he just had to let us eat downstairs! Don't let the packs go upstairs! This is why I really don't understand. What was supposed to be a good thing turned out to be a disgusting thing.


Environment: There are many claw machines at the back of the lobby, but no one maintains them, and no one helps to set them up if they can't be caught. The hotel has a mini amu*****t park. Although it is small, it can also waste some time for children.

msg:For a hotel in 2016, the lobby is well maintained, but the room facilities are a bit old, and the fragrance used in the corridor is pungent. It doesn't feel like a star-rated hotel. There is dust on the bedside table in the room, and the hygiene could be more meticulous. Because taxis in Shanghai are quite expensive, I chose a hotel with pick-up and drop-off services from the train station and the airport, which is indeed more convenient. However, the driver was very rude in communicating and waved his hands around to direct the guests. He was the first to meet at the station. He asked me, "Are you with that fat guy?" üò•The fat guy said that my husband wanted to train the driver's speaking skills, and that he could get the same room type ten days earlier than me by swiping it the night before check-in. The one I booked on Ctrip was over 100 cheaper. I was a little unhappy because I booked a hotel that was too expensive. When I checked in, I asked for a non-refundable price difference. I hoped to upgrade the room or give two breakfast coupons, but I was not satisfied. I gave a hotel that was said to be quieter. The room is indeed quite quiet, and the overall service experience is that the cleaning lady is quite enthusiastic. I may not book it again next time I bring my children to Disneyland.

Service: Xiao Wang at the hotel is very enthusiastic and professional. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to him at first, but I noticed him several times when I saw him asking guests about their experience. When I was waiting for the bus to Hongqiao, he even took the initiative to help me push my luggage. It made people feel that this was a warm hotel. I asked him to help me put my luggage on the outside of the carriage, and he did so carefully. The bus driver was also very enthusiastic and professional. As soon as we got on the bus, he asked us who was going to the high-speed rail station or the airport. When we were about to arrive at the station, he also told us not to go to the wrong place. When we got off the bus, we were right at the ticket gate.
In fact, not only these two, the staff who received me during the two days of my stay were very enthusiastic and made my Disney trip experience very good. I will still choose your hotel next time I come to Disney.

Disney/Hongqiao Railway Station/shuttle bus pick-up and drop-off service: the pick-up and drop-off is very good and reliable

msg:The service is relatively blunt, and the registration is done in the morning. And I stored my luggage at the concierge, and then took the children to Disneyland. At the end of the tour, after the hotel shuttle picked up a car of people and returned to the hotel in the evening, many people began to check in. There is only one employee in the front office plus one manager on duty. Those who have checked in and those who have not checked in are mixed together, and the queue is very long. The kids were asleep and check in was slow. After waiting for a long time, when we got in line, the front desk staff said, "It's been processed, you can get the room card directly", please, why don't you jump in the line to get your room card? Will other travelers have a good experience? Obviously, the management can be optimized, even if a guest notice is placed. This will also flow quickly. Speaking of the need to strengthen management, the second case is that the hotel has Disney‚Äôs pickup at night, and the hotel should have three buses. The employees reported that there are fewer drivers for large buses, and one car is limited. The signs are not issued in order, and the guests who arrive later will not be issued signs of different colors until the first batch of guests leave. In the end, they can‚Äôt figure out what comes first, which leads to a very chaotic scene. The guests were all in PK and "greeting mother" with each other before... It‚Äôs super bad sense of experience. Played for 3 days, not indoors, no room review, but the bedside table is very tasteless, takes up a lot of space, and the countertop is very small, accidentally dropped the phone... Summary: need to optimize the management process and strengthen the humanized service for family travel.

From Hongqiao to the hotel, it saves the trouble of taking a taxi and queuing up to the subway. There are buses to and from Disney in the morning and evening. We stayed for two days and played for two days. We took the bus to and from the park every day, which is very worry-free! The hotel service is also super good, and you can rent baby strollers and campers directly in the lobby! The room is also well equipped with wet and dry separation, the first round of drinks is free, and there are self-service coffee and cookies in the lobby! All the details are in place, making it very worry-free and convenient to travel with children in Disney. I will still choose this place next time I come!

During the period, the hotel driver kept calling me to ask if I was out, and kept saying to wait for me for a while I called 4 times during the hour and said it was okay, but the master still insisted on waiting for me and finally said that he could wait until 3 o'clock. Finally, at 2:55 to catch the bus, he didn‚Äôt need me to go to the P2 parking lot. The H6 area told me to go to the departure hall, and he picked me up directly. I'm going to take a taxi to save as much as I can. The hotel also has a children's play area, which is really good

msg:The room is not bad, basically the same as Yun and Yebo, I don't know if it is a decoration company. But the difference lies in the wooden floor, the room will be bigger. There are quite a lot of things on the first floor. There is a gift shop, a play area, and claw machines. There is a game area where the TV is not turned on. It is probably closed, so I didn‚Äôt ask.
The location is very close to Disney, follow his bus when you go to play, and take a taxi by yourself when you come back, and you can solve it within 20 yuan. The hotel doesn't provide breakfast, but there are a lot of takeaways nearby. After getting up, we take out the food directly, and after packing up, we go downstairs to get takeaways on the road. There are four bottles of drinks in the hotel room, all of which are free. If you stay for multiple days, remember to swipe the room card when you go downstairs the next day, it will basically become invalid.
Disadvantages, the air conditioner is so hot, it is still hot even if it is adjusted to 16 degrees, it should be uniform. Wet and dry are separated, and the shower head in the bathroom is inconvenient. It would be nice if it had a round head. I hope there is a hook in the shower, because I usually wipe my face immediately after washing my hair.

The overall experience is pretty good, the shuttle bus is very good, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about transportation when traveling to and from Disney with your kids. Unfortunately, I didn't book the shuttle bus to the train station for the next day in advance, so I had to take a taxi to the train station myself. Next time I come to Disneyland, I will consider this hotel if I don't stay in the park. I also passed Costco in the car when I left, so I plan to stop by next time.

At night, there are several stalls selling barbecue snacks at the entrance, which is smoky. As for the hotel, it is also owned by Huazhu, and it is the Hanting Hotel with slightly larger rooms. Not clean at all, honest review. The light in the room is dim, so that people can't see how dirty it is. Moth midges really flew out of the sink. There was black mold around the shower room and toilet sink, and the toilet was unstable when sitting on it. I took Xiaobao with me and was given a room next to the subway.

The hotel handles it like this: when you find a manager, the first thing is not to apologize to me, but to tell me that you are fine.

I said it was a safety accident issue. Not only did I not apologize, but my attitude was too bad. I asked for an apology first and then waived the bill. As a result, they changed two people from morning to noon. They made several calls and asked us to understand them, saying that they could not They were all free of charge, and no person in charge apologized to me, saying that the leader arranged it in this way, and I asked the leader to call me but I didn't receive it.
As a last resort, I complained to Ctrip, the booking platform, but failed to contact Ctrip for a whole day. The hotel's reply to Ctrip was: the hotel told Ctrip that the leader was not at work today, and the leader could not be contacted. Just prevarication and prevarication...
It‚Äôs amazing. It means that there is only one leader in charge. If the leader is not at work, he can‚Äôt be contacted. Is it because if I react slowly, I will stay in the hospital until tomorrow and wait for their leaders to go to work before I can be treated? !
Outrageous! ! !

Based on my many years of hotel experience, I can barely give this hotel a three-star rating. 2) I don‚Äôt know if Ctrip truly understands that the 55-square-meter small suite they are selling is actually a large one at the end of the corridor. I feel that the room is about the same size as the Kangqiao Marriott's 40 square meters. 3) The important thing is that when there is only one house for sale, what is the basis for saying that it is a suite? ? 4) In addition, the material of the furniture is equal to or worse than that of a budget hotel. The decoration is outdated. Especially the bathroom is full of stains. The toilet seat will shake when I sit on it. 5) I am really confused as to how the price of 1295/day for this room was determined! ? I hope relevant personnel from Ctrip can go and take a look at the products sold in (room number 1002). The products sold must be worthy of the name; the hotel is located in a budget hotel area. In addition, the hotel is surrounded by elevated tracks, so noise is unavoidable.

msg:The hotel is located in an industrial area. I booked a premium parent-child room and lived on the 3rd floor. I went to the hotel front desk and was told that it would be upgraded to a better parent-child room for free. I felt quite lucky at first. When I got to the room, I found that there was no tent and no walls. The decoration of a parent-child room is what it should be, and the most rubbish thing is that the room only has a very small window that can be opened. It is about 60-80 centimeters away from the window and is blocked by the wall of a house, so there is no ventilation and no sunlight at all. I called the front desk and asked why it was worse than before the upgrade. The answer I got was that after the upgrade, the room area is larger than before (it is conceivable that the previous room was very small), and they also said that all rooms in the hotel do not have balconies. Yes, because it was a bit late, I didn‚Äôt want to bother. I felt that the room I stayed in was just a 3-star standard, not a 5-star one. Don't just look at the pictures online, the ba*****t parking lot is very small and can only accommodate about 10 cars. Over 700 per night and no breakfast, so not worth it.

3. The housekeeper gave good advice and service, but there were bugs in the room, and things were hard to say how clean it was, so we changed to another room.

The store is really rare, great! There is a welcome drink when you check in at the hotel, just in the lobby, free snacks, freshly ground coffee is really amazing
Absolute child, there is also an indoor children's playground. The breakfast variety is also very rich, and there are small wontons, which are handmade by the auntie, delicious~ and
Freshly squeezed juice, healthy and delicious. The most worth mentioning is that the hotel has specially opened up a dining area for children: small chairs,
Small stools, mini bee buns, small and cute. The freshly baked bread looks like it was produced by a star-rated hotel bakery, huh! son
I like it very much, and said that I will stay here next time I come to Disney.

Distance, it is also very convenient not to take the hotel shuttle bus. Hygiene: The room is bright, tidy and clean, the bed is comfortable to sleep in, and the cleaning lady is very useful
Xin, folded our clothes for us. The mini bar in the room is free for the first round~ If you go to Disney, the hotel also has a free baby stroller
Cars can be rented, which is really affordable and saves you from spending money at Disney. Overall, it's a good stay.
Next time I come to Shanghai, I will consider staying in this hotel. I highly recommend it.

When I left the store, because something was missing in the parking lot, I wanted to call the front desk for help. After two and a half hours, I couldn‚Äôt get through to the hotel. It‚Äôs a big joke. I‚Äôve stayed in so many hotels, but I‚Äôve never encountered it. I am extremely disappointed that the hotel phone has not been connected for so long, let alone a hotel chain of this size.
Because of this store, I will not choose Novotel in the future.

msg:I am writing to share my observations and experiences about your hotel. Overall, I think the hotel's environment is average and the sanitary environment is okay, but I hope to improve the overall environment of the hotel, especially the condition of the indoor facilities.

First of all, the hotel's hygienic environment left a good impression on me. The rooms and common areas were reasonably clean, which was an important consideration during my stay. I appreciate the efforts of the hotel team in this regard.

However, I must point out that the hotel's interior facilities are a bit tired. The furniture and equipment in the room looked like they had been used for a long time and some were even worn. This gave me a stale feel and affected my stay.

Therefore, I sincerely recommend the hotel management to consider updating and maintaining the in-room facilities. This improves the overall image of the hotel and provides guests with a more comfortable and enjoyable stay.

Thank you again for your assistance and service during my stay at the hotel. I hope my feedback will help improve the hotel.

In addition, the passenger flow is expected to be heavy during the holidays, so there was no one to assist us when we got our luggage off the bus. If we go there during the summer vacation, the price is not very cost-effective compared to hotels in other areas.

But the hotel facilities are very impersonal. The central air conditioner cannot adjust the temperature. The air conditioner in the room seems to be in vain. Booked two rooms with friends. The room is very closed and airtight at night. The child was too hot to sleep. Crying blindly. The overall experience is very poor. I have communicated with the hotel many times and can't solve it. My friend also thought it was too hot. If the temperature difference is too large, I worry that the baby will catch a cold or something.
Then the child woke up the next day with various rashes on his body. It was so hot that eczema broke out. The overall onboarding experience is very poor.
The hotel shuttle bus is scheduled and scheduled, and it needs to be reserved in advance. If you are late, you will not wait for guests. Because the time of bringing children is unstable, we basically did not use the hotel pick-up function and chartered our own car.
So this price is not recommended.

2. The shuttle bus is very convenient, there are many shifts, very punctual, and it is very close to the park. Unlike other hotels, which run in the morning and evening, the time is not free, and multiple shifts are very suitable for the needs of children of different ages.
3. There are free strollers and campervans that can be rented for a fee, which is very convenient. Compared with the ones in the park, it is very necessary to free your hands after walking to the gate for 20 minutes.
4. The shuttle bus can also take you to Hongqiao Railway Station or the airport. This time we go to T2, directly door-to-door, which is very convenient and saves money.
5. When checking out, I also gave a thermos cup and honey grapefruit tea, which are warm, and the child does not worry about drinking water all the way, which is considerate.
6. The room service is timely and the cleaning is very clean. The clothes that were left unpacked by Disney the day before came back were neatly folded, and the things were neatly placed. It makes people feel that it is not a veteran who does the cleaning.

Fly in the oin**ent, the first floor is slightly cold, and the hotel should have no experience in cooling down in this wave. As a result, children's playgrounds and restaurants need to wear down jackets sooner or later.

But overall I am very satisfied, and I have already recommended it to my friends, ten-star praise.

I originally wanted to endure it until 11:30, but then I discovered that there were a few red spots on the bathroom mirror. The child found it scary, so he asked to change rooms and was upgraded to a double room. It was indeed bigger than the previous room. But the shower room was leaking. I didn‚Äôt want to replace it a second time, so I chose to endure it.

First of all, I didn‚Äôt know the location of the shuttle bus because I didn‚Äôt check in in advance. I went straight to the parking lot when I got out of Disney at 21:30. There were so many people and the signal was not good. It was approaching the time of the last bus. I was anxious to call the hotel switchboard continuously, but my mobile phone problem There was only one voice, and the gentle young lady took the trouble to answer my phone. She knew that I must be in a hurry to get on the bus, and she didn't get angry or questioned that I was a nuisance call. When she finally got through, she immediately informed me of the location of the car and comforted me. Arrived at the hotel , the sister at the front desk received her warmly and politely. I accidentally saw her thumping her waist. I learned that the New Year‚Äôs Day was approaching and worked continuously for several days, but she still maintained a very good condition to greet her. I accidentally praised the girl at the switchboard and learned that it was the daughter of the sister at the front desk who was arrested. The mother and daughter who came here to do volunteer work are very good people. They are hardworking and enthusiastic, so that they can comfort their minds after a tired day. Let's boast about the room and breakfast. Although the age is a bit old, the room facilities and space are not worse than Toy Story. Sleeping It's comfortable, the breakfast is very rich and the food is very good. It should be that the hotel management has been inspecting and discussing it, which shows that they are working hard to manage the hotel. The lady who checked out the next day was also very good. Ask about the subway station , specially led me to the door and told me enthusiastically, with a smile. In short, it is worthy of praiseüëç

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in the same hotel at Disney, and it is considered a repeat customer. I originally came here with the familiarity and better service, but this time I am very disappointed. The airport pick-up and drop-off service is really bad, not even comparable to those around Disney. The homestay is humanized. When I arrived, I didn‚Äôt come to the high-speed rail station to pick me up. It‚Äôs okay to say that I can‚Äôt make the time. I caught the plane the next day, and the bus that was scheduled to be delivered to the airport the day before drove away in front of us without stopping to open the door. Let us get in the car, the premise is that we have called and told the staff that we are waiting for the elevator, and we must wait for us. The speed of the elevator should not be paid by our customers, right? After communicating with the staff on the bus, they were not actively dealt with. They just said that the next bus would not be available until 2 hours later, that is, at 11:30. May I ask why we can‚Äôt enjoy the rights that we should have enjoyed when we booked a hotel? Even if the bus leaves, should the hotel help to find a way to arrange other cars to send you to the airport? Otherwise, how can we meet the needs of passengers from all corners of the world with only two regular buses a day? Are promises all empty promises? In the end, we were afraid that we would not be able to catch the plane, and our family of five had to find a way to get to the airport under the high temperature of 38¬∞. It was really speechless.

I booked two rooms with my family, but one was not cleaned until 4pm. Maybe the previous guest checked out late!
The breakfast was not bad. It arrived at 10:30. It was family-friendly. There was a children's playground on the first floor, but it was not cleaned in time and it was a bit messy.
The hotel is located next to the subway, so subway noise is unavoidable at night. If you have sleep disorders, choose carefully because the subway will arrive at 11-12 p.m.
The main recommendation is their bed, which is very good to sleep on. There is a layer of soft down on the spring bed, which is great.
The front desk staff are very professional in their service, but the food delivery robot is unreliable and often breaks down.
What is very considerate is that bottled water is placed at the elevator entrance every morning for guests going to Disneyland to bring water with them when they go out.

msg:The hotel lobby seems to be very good at taking pictures. I saw many people taking pictures. The rooms near the scenic spots are small. The decoration of the public area is decent, but the elevator is dark. The room lights are not too bright. It is not friendly to the elderly. There are windows, but the lighting is too general, and the windows are covered. The windows of the other rooms should not be covered. The hotel has a swimming pool. I bought a swimsuit temporarily (in the early 100s). The children had a great time. Swimming rings are free to play. The hotel is very close to Disney, and the departure is only about 20. The hotel also has a shuttle bus to Disney and Pudong Airport, which is very convenient.
The little brother who served the noodle soup and noodles for breakfast and lunch was very enthusiastic. The elder sister listened shortly, and the elder sister felt that she had returned home. But I would like to make two small suggestions, 1. Too much powder is given, eat slowly for a while and then soak into a large bowl of soup powder with only powder but no soup. For breakfast, one bite is enough. After all, I have to save my stomach for other things. Let's talk about cake and bread. The slices of bread are ice-cold, although they can be heated in the oven, but are all slices of bread toasted? What if there is someone who doesn't like to bake? The experience of picking up ice is too bad. Should have taken it out of the fridge sooner. The same is true for small cakes. I thought I had an ice cream cake at the first bite. Although the supply may be in short supply during the holidays, there are still queues for hotel breakfasts in Sanya during the Chinese New Year. I have never eaten ice cream cakes. I don‚Äôt even expect you to do it on the same day. Shouldn't it have been taken out and thawed earlier? Because I am a person who loves buffets so much, I may pay more attention to these. Hope the hotel adopts it.
I also want to complain that it is bitter to spread bread slices in the morning and eat jam. Tell the manager and the manager said he tasted the jam and it was bitter. It may be that I have tasted more than a dozen kinds of jams in Sanya Hotel, but I have never tasted bitter jams.

Tell the front desk to ask the robot to deliver the takeaway, and the front desk can say "I'm busy and I'm not free, so I can pick it up myself." The bus driver has a bad attitude. The hygiene of the hotel is not flattering, and the corner of the bathroom is moldy.

After moving in, the sink was clogged with hair. The scene had to be cleaned again, it was so disgusting! The arrangement is towards the light rail side! The sound is so loud that it lasts no more than 2-3 minutes, making it impossible to rest! Didn't tell me in advance that there was a light rail, the sound insulation was very poor!

It turned out that we stayed for three days and every time we came back, we tasted every taste. There are also rooms that have windows but are blocked from the outside. A room without light is really uncomfortable.
The highlight of their home is the bed with two queen beds, which is very comfortable for a family of four. Don't worry about your child falling to the ground. There is also a toothbrush, which is really easy to use. It is specially equipped with a hair dryer for children. These points are special üëçIt is also very close to Disney, and it takes about 10 minutes by taxi.

Service: I said that the shower in my room was broken so I couldn't use the big shower. The staff said they would confirm, but after that I didn't get any reply and I couldn't use the big shower.
Still, the reason why I gave 3 service points is because I can use the Disney Shuttle and the airport and train station shuttle system.

Cleanliness: The lobby, hallways, and rooms all smelled good, so I felt good.
The sofa, bed, and towels in the accommodation were all clean.

Facilities: The lobby, hallway, and room facilities were generally good, but the facility score was low because I had to sleep in a room with a broken shower.

Besides, I am even more embarrassed when picking up and dropping off the airport. There are also time requirements for picking up and dropping off the airport. It's really false advertising. There is also a shuttle bus to Disney. I was tired all day and said I would go back early. I ran all the way to the parking lot to find a car for fear of being late. I was so tired that the bus refused to leave. I just waited for more than 20 minutes before leaving. simply drunk

First, pick up the Disney shuttle bus, and there is no problem sending it there. Since the front desk has reservations at night, you should know the passenger flow How big is the management chaos in the Disney parking lot! I was stunned to wait until almost twelve o'clock to get on the bus. At that time, I saw a lot of children with children, and the children also suffered. The hotel management is too bad, there is no logic at all! The parking lot is empty, and we haven't left yet. Also, because we are more humble, let those with children go back to the hotel first, come back in the evening and make an appoin**ent with the front desk to take the bus to Hongqiao the next day, and were told that they have to go on their own when the appoin**ent is over, so I would like to ask, since it is an appoin**ent, why can‚Äôt Inform in advance, and since there is a quota limit, don't write about the transfer to Hongqiao Airport in the reservation! It doesn't match the facts, it's not worth the price at all, and the reviews feel like they're all brushed out.

First of all, the staff Amy is very warm and caring. She only said that she would arrange a quiet room. She helped me upgrade the room very well. Because of some special circumstances, I could not continue to live. Amy helped me contact all the follow-up matters, and I sincerely thank this kind mother-to-be. Every staff in the hotel's front desk, restaurant, etc. is very patient, polite and warm to serve customers. The breakfast is also very good. The fish-flavored eggplant in the restaurant is worth trying, delicious. I plan to live here before I go to the hospital for re-swelling trea**ent in Pudong.

The temperature of the air conditioner can't be adjusted, it's always 27.. not environmentally friendly, 23_25 is very good, and the heat has been streaking, although the room is small, it can't run.

Toiletries are complete and USB ports are sufficient.
Take the shuttle to Disney, convenient! The return journey is only at night, and it is really tired. It is less than 30 yuan to take a taxi back.

I checked a few hotels around, and they only had the shuttle from Pudong Airport and Disneyland. Only this one actually has Hongqiao Railway Station/Airport. Pick-up, because I took the high-speed train to Shanghai to get off at Hongqiao Railway Station, which is more convenient. The decoration of the hotel is generally pretty good. The important thing is that many details are quite good in a hotel with the same price. For example, there is free coffee and snacks in the lobby from afternoon to evening, and free porridge from 21:00 to 23:00 in the evening ( It should be because people who come back from Disney are hungry) because there are not many choices for eating nearby, but fortunately, you can order takeout. My parents and I are with children, so basically three meals a day are served in the hotel restaurant. The restaurant is especially praised here, Xiao Zheng, who is very enthusiastic every time. He takes the initiative to help us with children's bibs, wipes and fruits, and responds to requests. , In short, if you come back to Disney, you will choose to live here.

msg:Hotel: full of Chris**as a**osphere, children like it very much
Parent-child: There is a children's playground. We grew up and didn't like playing, so we didn't go. There is a small shop where you can buy gifts, which is quite nice. There were two rows of capsule eggs at the door, so I bought one. We can no longer wear the parent-child slippers, so we wear adult slippers. The children's toothpaste is said to be a little spicy, I guess it's mint. Everything else is good.
Features: Free drinks in the refrigerator, great reviews! I came back from Disneyland in the evening and didn‚Äôt know there was porridge, so I missed it. When checking out, the grapefruit tea provided was gone, and the child was a little disappointed.
Praise: The breakfast is delicious, I like it so much! I left my cell phone in the room, and my aunt handed it to the front desk for me. Thank you! A little suggestion: You should have my phone number when you check in. If you find my phone number and you can contact me, it will be more considerate (if you don‚Äôt have a phone number, just pretend I didn‚Äôt tell you ü§™)
Disadvantages: The front desk staff lacks a little enthusiasm and will not take the initiative if you don't ask. The boss needs to pay more to make the employees happy
p.s. I brought the blanket on the bed myself, not theirs.

Upon check-in, the front desk saw us 2 big and 2 young and gave us a free upgrade to the family room and said it would be more comfortable. But this is great, but it's not only that. Soon after arriving in the room, the aunt delivered 2 cups of warm milk to the child to tell the child that it was cold and that it would be easy to fall asleep after drinking. She also posted a warm note. There are kids playground, slippers, toothbrushes, bathrobes, and kids hair dryers too! There is also a blue Air purifier in the room. The hotel provides a Disney shuttle bus. When we returned to the room after watching the fireworks, the hotel also provided a free porridge shop-that's great! Finally, a bottle of hot citrus tea was given when checking out. A warm and warm hotel, I will definitely come back next time!

Facilities and equipment: basically have everything you should have. Regarding the room temperature, I stayed for two nights. When the first day arrived, the heating was not turned off. The room was very hot. After I checked in, I turned it off and opened the windows for ventilation. The next day I obviously felt that the temperature dropped, which was acceptable. , It is recommended that you do not turn on the heating, the windows are open, and the temperature is about 25‚ÑÉ.

msg:Let me talk about some objective facts first, so as not to mislead people who are not familiar with it here. The hotel is located on a very remote Kangxin Highway, surrounded by industrial areas and rural areas. If it weren't for the Disney Resort, there would be nothing there. For out-of-town tourists, planning should be done.
During the day we checked in, we went to the Bicester Village in the Disney Resort, the newest outlet in Shanghai. It was very easy to stroll around. I didn't want to go back to the city and lived here after shopping. I drove 5km. Then the next day, I went to Disney Town for a stroll and lunch. I only need to take one subway stop. You need to know that it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the town from the Disney car park. The subway used to walk less, so I parked the car the next day. The hotel and the subway went around for a while.
Let's talk about the hotel itself, the rooftop swimming pool is a highlight. The breakfast is fairly rich, and there are not many choices for dinner, but the products are OK, not too expensive, and better than takeaways. There is a convenience store next to the hotel, it is very convenient to buy snacks and drinks. The hotel service is very good. When I checked in at the front desk, I thought that the room rate had dropped and I was a bit dissatisfied. The staff explained immediately and upgraded the room at the same time. Thank her very much. In addition, the room mini bar is free for the first round, so it should be enough to drink. Seeing that there is a shuttle bus to Disney every day, and there are trolleys that can be borrowed, it may be more convenient for people in need than renting to Disney.

The front desk service is very good. I changed a quiet room according to my request. I read the comments of Dianping and said that the front desk talked very violently. Maybe those girls were fired. There is no complaint for this group. Check in and ask if you have brought a toothbrush. By the way, you can bring a one-time one last time. There is also free porridge in the evening. There is an outdoor swimming pool, which is cleaner than some indoor swimming pools in the suburbs. There is a canopy above the swimming pool, which can shade and block the rain without being depressed. Although the style will be reduced, it is very practical. It rained heavily when we were swimming, and the downstream of the canopy was not affected at all. You can also eat grilled fish and yellow croaker noodles in the restaurant on the first floor, satisfying the tastes of adults and children. Although the hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs playground is small, it is enough for children to splash around for a night. It‚Äôs good to have a playground, otherwise you have to find a place to discharge it. This time for the children‚Äôs birthday, the hotel prepared a cake in advance. Although it is small, the children are very happy if they have surprises. Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip for letting us have a free hotel to stay in!

        Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages 1. The room soundproofing effect is not very good. I often hear the sound of closing the door next door and then our room seems to tremble. 2. Although it is next to the subway, it is away from the center of the city such as Jing'an Road or Lujiazui. It‚Äôs a good time to come back from the subway for 2-3 times. 3.

But try to choose a room that is not facing the street. The overall service is not bad, but the sanitation is too general, there is still rubbish left by the previous guest in the room, and the food on the floor of the bed is rotten, which is particularly unpleasant. We pushed the bed to the other side. There was a layer of dust on the bedside table (look at the picture and feel it for yourself). We stayed for several days and didn't wipe it once. The schedule is very tight every day and there is no time to contact the front desk. Disposable toothbrushes and slippers have to go downstairs to the front desk every day to get them, and they will not be replaced at all for cleaning.

It‚Äôs very close to the subway station, less than ten minutes away. The subway will be available at 5 o'clock in the morning. This is only when I get up early the next morning to go to Disney. The first day to book the Disney shuttle in the hotel lobby is only 7 o‚Äôclock at the earliest. Yes, because I bought an early ticket, I need to line up at the entrance of the scenic spot at 5:30. The hotel said that I could only take a taxi by myself. I was afraid that it would be difficult to take a taxi in the morning and book a taxi. It would cost more than 40 yuan (normally a taxi was more than ten yuan), and 5 o‚Äôclock in the morning. I regretted seeing the huhu subway running not far away. The hotel price is much cheaper than that near Disney. In a park, there are 2 private small supermarkets downstairs. Everything is more expensive. A bag of fresh milk for 2 yuan sells for 5 yuan. There are no commercial facilities in the surrounding area. I eat in the hotel restaurant at night, and the taste is okay. Generally speaking, it is okay, relatively new, and the advantage is that it is relatively cheap. The lobby door is relatively concealed, and the fat female receptionist has no patience. She speaks violently, and she does not want to affect her mood and changed to another receptionist.

We are one big and one small, two beds are just right. The bed in a twin room is relatively narrow, and it will be crowded if two people sleep.
Hotel facilities exceeded expectations, as well as an outdoor swimming pool. After calling to confirm in advance, we brought our own swimsuits and the kids had fun. The water temperature was a bit cold on the evening of June 27.
The service is also very good, in the refrigerator there is Coke Sprite mineral water provided for free. During the bath, the child got the slippers wet and asked for another pair, which was very refreshing.
Come back to the location, very close to the Kangxin Highway Station of Metro Line 11. You can travel freely without taking the hotel bus.

After the Disney 8 o'clock fireworks, I walked slowly out of the park. I went to take the subway at about 9:15. It was very empty and the comfort level was perfect. Because it is close to the subway line, it is inevitable that there will be a bit of noise. Our own sleep is not affected. If we have special needs, it is recommended to communicate in advance and choose a room on the other side that is not facing the street. The bed is very comfortable, soft and suitable for me.

Room facilities: clean and hygienic, there is a small refrigerator, the side wall of the bathroom can be opened, hand washing is very convenient, no need to go around. The bedding is soft and comfortable. I live in 253, from the side, I didn't feel noisy.
Transportation: There is only one subway station away from Disney, which is very convenient. Remind everyone, to Disney, getting in and out of the subway is the least walkable way. The earliest car to Disney was 7:02. Take a taxi or go to the hotel parking lot, it will be farther. It takes about 50 minutes to get out of the park and back to the hotel. The main reason is that the paradise is too big. If you don‚Äôt want to go out of the station, you can ride a shared bicycle for 2 minutes.
Food: The hotel has a simple buffet at noon, 58 people (I heard that it will fluctuate due to the price of vegetables), which is quite worth it. There are potato cakes, opium fish head, mussels seafood balls, fried beef, fungus and water chestnuts, curry potatoes, cold chicken feet, cold tripe, fruits, and cola drinks. There is also a buffet for dinner. There are two small convenience stores outside the lobby, and the one with the word tea is better.
Service: Everyone has a good attitude.
The only drawback: too few TV programs, the baby is not satisfied
Will stay at Disney next time.

The sweltering heat when I entered the door made me breathless, and I didn't even open the windows for ventilation after cleaning the room. The heat in the room kept me from sleeping all night. What was even more surprising was that after going to the toilet in the morning, I found that the toilet could not be flushed. You can imagine the feeling of the toilet not flushing in a stuffy room. I recalled for a moment that the Express Hotel I stayed in Xiamen was also like this, but it was less than 100 yuan.
The so-called good service is not just about the colleagues at the front desk saying some polite words, but also actively solving the problems of the guests is good service. Although the whole process was polite, I didn't feel sorry at all.
I didn't accept the breakfast voucher that your hotel gave me. What I mean by saying this is not your compensation, but that you are just a hotel that seems to have good service. The direct consequence of this is that I may have a prejudice against Accor hotels in the future. Accor has done a good job, you really shouldn't have left such a bad impression in the hearts of guests because of your inaction.

msg:A luxury five-diamond hotel would make such a mistake
The hotel provides a round-trip shuttle service. I also canceled the hotel I booked because of this and chose the Novotel Hotel Clover. After booking, I followed the WeChat official account, and the hotel also pushed the shuttle bus schedule. (Show updated July 8th). But when I called one day in advance to book a shuttle bus to Hongqiao Airport at 7:10 the next morning, the staff told me that there was never a 7:10 shuttle bus to the airport. But the timetable pushed by the hotel clearly stated 7:10.
I think the hotel management needs to reflect on several issues:
1. Since there is no such time, why is the timetable pushed to the guests not changed in time?
2. The service staff insisted that there has never been a time of 7:10. Is what written in black and white a lie? The update date is still July 8th. In addition to this mistake, is the other management of the hotel also so perfunctory? We can change whatever we want based on a word from the staff. Is this the so-called shop bullying? The final interpretation right of our writing is also ours. Is the service level of seeing the big from the small is the performance of customer first?
3. If it is true that there has never been a 7:10 shuttle bus, then the hotel has a problem. For so long, the public account has pushed all the wrong information, but no one has discovered it. Where does the refined management reflect?
I have never been a picky person. I used to book hotels on Ctrip with good reviews. This unpleasant experience made me skeptical about this store and even hotels under Novotel. (Attach the timetable pushed by the official account)
Dear friends who choose this hotel, please ask carefully before booking, so as not to delay the trip and affect the travel mood.
