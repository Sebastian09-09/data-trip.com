When we arrived at hotel Ms Rihanna who is manager gave us a warm welcome. There was a lot of people who waited check-in but she helped us quickly, so we could do it. And we exchanged wechat ID and she let us know when we need help through wechat. Breakfast quality was really good. So base on positive response we were able to finish the trip with good memories

The Chinese restaurant and buffet breakfast restaurant serve good varieties of delicious food.  Due to bad weather, we had breakfast, lunch and dinner in hotel but didn't get bored.

One of my friends stayed in Banyan Tree Yangshuo last month and recommended the hotel to us.  She also introduced me to the Spa & Gallery manager Alisa in WeChat.  Alisa arranged everything for us before our trip.  Due to bad weather, we changed our travel plan and arrived hotel one day late.  Alisa applied an upgrade for us with our extra night payment.  We were upgraded to Imperial Retreat Villa which is quant and superbly decorated with nice garden and a round bathtub.  Exactly what we need to wind down from our busy city life.

Thanks to all the staff in Banyan Tree Yangshuo and especially to Alisa.  We will definitely stay here again when we visit Yangshuo next time.

The hotel room is very spacious and we have a backyard as well which is very lovely. One of the highlights of the stay is my personal assistant Emily, she’s super quick in response and helped me every day with my sudden requests of questions. Special thanks to Emily and the manager Ailsa who managed to find my lost ring at the mini golf area.

Banyan is one of my favorite brands and I loved staying there in Bali, and Bangkok. However this Banyan felt a little off, the breakfast took us a while to get a table and once we sat down a waitress told us in Chinese to “hurry up and eat quickly”, since breakfast ends at 10:30, it was only 10am when we got seated. Otherwise, The views are fantastic here, I feel like the rooms could’ve been a bit bigger but otherwise everything else was fine.

First of all, the service details of the hotel are simply amazing, from the sachets at check-in to the small potted plants at check-out, every little link makes people feel carefully cared for. Especially those ubiquitous little animals, the two cute alpacas are my favorite. The hotel staff, especially the butler Chad, is warm and kind. No matter what we need, he always appears at the first time to help us solve it. His thoughtful care really makes us feel at home. It rained for three days in Guilin, but staying in the hotel gave us a hazy feeling. In short, Banyan Tree Guilin is highly recommended. If I come to Guilin next time, I will definitely choose here again without hesitation.

Finally, I want to talk about the hotel service. I have only stayed in Yuechun before. This is my first time staying in Banyan Tree. It is indeed well-deserved. The housekeeper Vicky is very enthusiastic. From the beginning of check-in, all kinds of greetings and service details are in place. It really feels like home.

Is there any flaw? Objectively speaking, there is definitely one. After all, the facilities may seem relatively old due to the age, but you can see that the hotel has been constantly maintaining them. Unlike some hotels, you may think that it is normal for them to be damaged over time, but not Banyan Tree. Every detail is taken care of. In short, when you come to Banyan Tree, you don’t feel like a VIP who is being entertained, but feel free and at ease as if you are back home.

msg:This should be the worst experience of all Banyan Tree. 
Service: Not worthy of the name of Banyan Tree. Especially the Spa, which was originally a business card of Banyan Tree, but the waiters all looked too lazy to care about the guests and were in a hurry to get off work. I didn't know what to say even if I asked, and some things to pay attention to were not told in advance, which was really speechless😓.
Location: Very, very remote, far away from Yangshuo County. Ten-mile Gallery, Yulong River rafting, and some Internet celebrity check-in spots, West Street round trip takes 45-60 minutes. And there are no farmhouse restaurants around, and the hotel Chinese restaurant is not cheap. Two people order 3 dishes for 750 yuan+
Rafting: Don't believe the rafting provided by the hotel. It's a river at the door of the hotel. The water is very turbid and there is garbage at the dock. It takes 50 minutes to go back and forth, and there is almost no scenery. It is so different from Yulong River.
Clothing: Dissuade sisters. The so-called travel photography and clothing provided, my gosh, they are ugly and dirty, so I decisively gave up.
Hygiene: The hygiene of the restaurant is worrying. There is a smell of stinky bamboo shoots inside, and there are female peacocks walking around freely outside. The table and the feet are full of their food residues. It is horrible.

Facilities: After all, it has been established for a long time, and the facilities are slightly old, but acceptable.

Hygiene: normal five-star level

Environment: A classic location, next to the Li River, surrounded by mountains and rivers, in a small village, not next to a scenic spot, this is great. In places like Yangshuo where cultural tourism development is relatively poor, hotels next to scenic spots will drop in price no matter how good they are.

Service: normal five-star standard, butler Amanda is very enthusiastic and considerate. The guys on the shuttle bus are very enthusiastic. A single-family villa was also upgraded that day.

The only drawback is that many of our past projects have been fully booked that day. I think the hotel can call customers in advance during holidays to inform them of advance reservations. This is a better suggestion at that time.

One last point that has nothing to do with the hotel's service quality. There was a quarrel in a villa next to room 225 from 11 to 2 at night. The sound could be heard clearly. The sound insulation effect may need to be improved. After all, it was late at night. This point cannot be ignored.

After passing the winding country road, seeing the hotel gate, I felt like I was in a different world. The environment is natural and the air is fresh. Vicky, the housekeeper, arranged the room with the best view in the room type. Every day, she was naturally and appropriately cared for and paid attention to; every staff member was happy to greet you and answer your questions. Highly recommended, it also gave me a deeper understanding of the Banyan Tree brand. The only regret was that due to heavy rain, the bamboo rafting activity arranged by the hotel was cancelled due to safety reasons, but other arrangements were made to make up for it.

At first, I was worried that I couldn't take my baby with me on the double bamboo raft tour of the Li River. The hotel baby care service recommended by the housekeeper was very good. We experienced animal feeding, children's fishing, and aromatherapy candle making together. The bed was very comfortable, the breakfast variety was very rich, and the service was also great. I will choose it again if I come to Yangshuo next time.

Disadvantages: There are relatively few facilities for children to play
Conclusion: The disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages

The view outside the window is not very open, but the indoor is large enough. The breakfast tastes average, and the electric bamboo raft has a good view, but it is a bit noisy. There are many small animals in the park. The little fragrant pigs are very cute, the alpacas are a bit fierce, and there are peacocks and ducks strolling in the park. The park is very hygienic, the ground is clean, and the animals have no smell. There are many small slopes on the road in the park, and you need to wear shoes that are comfortable to walk. The area around the hotel is not much developed and is very desolate. It is very convenient to take a taxi. The car can easily come in, and the gate is generally not managed.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the hotel Emily for her attentive service during the stay and introducing the hotel's features, activities and scenery in detail. There are thoughtful reminders before various activities. I accidentally left my watch behind and took the initiative to contact me and help me mail it home. It was very considerate to proactively inquire about my needs during my stay.
   I have a great experience every time I stay at a Banyan Tree brand hotel. Angsana's heart-warming service during the Spring Festival last year was experienced again this year at Banyan Tree Yangshuo. Like this brand

Facilities: Very complete. Among the many hotels I have stayed at, Banyan Tree's facilities currently give the best reviews. The bathtub is not only equipped with bath salts but also bath oil, which is great. The hotel also provides bubble baths for a fee. Floor heating is installed in the bathroom, shower, and washing area, and the experience is very comfortable. The hotel really considers the guest's comfort here, and it is well received. The bedroom is equipped with incense that is very artistic and emotional. The hotel parking lot has two fast and slow charging options for new energy vehicles, which is very friendly. The fence in the courtyard is very short for the sake of viewing. It seems unsafe, but I found that the electronic fence is very reassuring. The room has both capsule coffee and a traditional tea table with three different types of tea including osmanthus tea, black tea and Tieguanyin. The wine cabinet also has a full range of wines and beverages. The hotel's outdoor infinity swimming pool is temperature-controlled, which is commendable. The bedding in the bedroom is very comfortable. I like everything from the pillows to the mattress. I want to buy a set for my home. The high-end leather room card holder reflects the hotel's attention and attentiveness to its guests.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good. Being on such a humid riverside, the room does not have any moldy smell. The courtyard grass is also cleaned very carefully, which is refreshing.

Environment: Guilin's landscape is unmatched in the world. The hotel landscape is perfectly integrated with the natural beauty. The raising of peacocks, koi and other animals in the hotel gives people a sense of natural harmony. The landscape of the entire hotel campus is breathtaking. The environment is quiet and it is the best place to stay in a hotel recently.

Service: The concierge in the hotel lobby welcomes you warmly, and is equipped with a battery car that can be called at any time to take you to any location in the hotel you want to go. The hotel is equipped with a one-on-one butler service to provide help, reminders and answers to questions. The turndown and small gifts were very thoughtful. Offer tea, handkerchiefs and small gifts during check-in. Welcome fruits are prepared in the room, and the hotel's exclusive Li River cruise is great. In the afternoon, we also prepared a welcome ceremony with ethnic characteristics and oil tea for the guests, which was really thoughtful. The hotel lobby also specially prepared feed for peacocks and koi for guests, which is completely free! If it rains continuously during your stay, the hotel can provide umbrellas to guests in every area. When leaving the hotel, the hotel carefully prepared local osmanthus potted plants as souvenirs. The meaning of bringing wealth and honor home is very good.

Experience of two-person bamboo raft tour on the Li River: Although the weather is not beautiful, the beautiful scenery here can still make people linger. The bamboo raft brother introduced the local beautiful scenery, customs and customs along the way.


In-store leisure activities: Welcoming guests are invited to sing and dance together. Feed small animals close to nature.

The dinner is very cost-effective and the barbecue set meal is top notch.
The room service at night is also great, and the chef's cooking skills are excellent. The stir-fried Guiyang and black truffle mushroom soup are both great, highly recommended.
The variety of breakfast is extremely rich, and the freshly squeezed vegetable juice is highly praised. The service staff are warm and hospitable.

This stay at Banyan Tree Yangshuo was a near-perfect experience. The hotel is close to nature and integrated with nature. Both the hardware facilities and the service enthusiasm are unparalleled. I sincerely hope that Banyan Tree will continue to develop better and better. I will definitely choose to return to this impressive Banyan Tree Yangshuo hotel next time I have the opportunity.

My husband and I happened to meet Guangxi March 3rd in Yangshuo. We like quietness and were disrupted by the crowds. In a hurry, we chose Banyan Tree to escape the noise. It is quiet and comfortable here. Especially our housekeeper Amanda, from checking in, to helping us suggest itineraries, arranging bamboo raft tours on the Li River and solving problems that need to be solved during the stay, has shown high professionalism, thoughtfulness and warmth. When she knew that we changed our itinerary temporarily and could not enjoy the hotel's afternoon tea on time, she helped coordinate and packed for us before we left.

The hotel was relatively remote and there were no shops in front of or behind it. It was difficult to find a car even if we had one. There was a small country road, making it inconvenient to travel to scenic spots. Secondly, the hotel costs 2,798 a night. Everything in the hotel says it is for use only. Even the drinks in the refrigerator are charged. It is too petty. The hotel is not big and there is still construction nearby. We booked a small villa with a courtyard, which is ordinary. There are no highlights and the water in the room is not big. The receptionist at the front desk was mechanically polite without any enthusiasm. I felt that the price did not match the room at all. I felt like I was in trouble for my first stay. I didn’t believe it after reading the bad reviews before, so I had to give it a try.

The housekeeper Chad took the initiative to ask if we needed a fever patch. On the last day, he helped us extend the check-out time. The whole service was meticulous. In addition, the other staff of the hotel were also very friendly. Because the child was sick, the originally booked tour itinerary was cancelled and changed to a three-day hotel recuperation. We didn’t even go to the restaurant for lunch and dinner. We ordered meals to be delivered to the room. We ordered both the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant. The taste was great and we ate them all!

The children's corner in the picture has only a small room with extremely simple facilities, suitable for a few babies. No outdoor children's playground is provided, and the mini golf course is also not provided. 
Catering: The hotel only has Chinese and Western restaurants, both of which are not large. Although the price of Chinese food is expensive, the product is good. The breakfast in the Western restaurant should be the best part of the hotel, but for the buffet of nearly 400/person, not only are there very few dishes, but also the taste is not good. Because the food is placed outdoors and the weather is cold, most of the meat is cold. Occasionally, you can eat hot food when you encounter food that is just baked. 

Ctrip bookings send the hotel Lijiang bamboo raft, which is understandable due to weather reasons. But the hotel has no other entertainment for leisure except feeding small animals as entertainment. Children's activities such as fishing will be cancelled due to rainy days. The hotel has many beautiful scenery, but except for an area in the hotel lobby, there is no other place to rest and drink tea. It is indeed less fun. 

Service: The overall hotel service awareness is very strong, and they are willing to communicate and solve problems. But unfortunately, the hotel hardware and service tools are limited, and the overall experience is average.

The hotel arranged check-in very efficiently, and the service staff were friendly and polite. Because the resort is large, you can call for a tram to pick you up and drop you off. Although there are many people during the holidays, it is still very punctual.
The infinity pool is a constant temperature pool. It is very suitable for a warm bath in the misty rain, and the whole body is relaxed. It is just a little cold from the pool to the locker room.
Banyan Tree Spa is one of the best Thai essential oil massages I have ever had. The 90-minute Paris strength is moderate. Friends who want to sleep can also choose the sleep aid package. The Thai girl Bewty is very gentle and speaks good Mandarin. I recommend it.
What surprised me the most was this hotel travel photo shoot. Our photographer Xiao Li was professional and serious. I was worried that the 2-year-old baby would not cooperate. As a result, I had a lot of wonderful interactions with the girl. The 30-minute shooting was immediate.
Finally, let’s talk about the food. The Chinese restaurant is relatively not so outstanding. You can go to the city to eat local specialties. The holiday buffet in the Western restaurant is really good. If you have the opportunity to catch up with the holiday, you can arrange it.

I felt the warm and thoughtful service everywhere, and the housekeeper Sophia was also extremely attentive and considerate. It was a very satisfying experience and I hope to come back again if I have the opportunity.
It would be even better if there is a smart toilet.

msg:Service: Thank you very much to the housekeeper Emily. She added WeChat before checking in. She really took great care of her during her stay in the store. As long as she says it, she will be satisfied.

Environment: Although it is a bit far from the scenic spot, the environment in the hotel is really beautiful. Walking through a village and entering the hotel has a feeling of "a village with bright flowers and bright flowers". The villa is very private and has an independent yard. Children like it very much.

Hygiene: The cleaning lady cleans carefully every day, and takes the initiative to turn down the bed at night. When turning down the bed, she will help clean up again and draw the curtains.
Facilities: There are not many facilities for children, and the children's playground is limited. I hope more can be added.
Karen Ding and Ronin Zhu in the restaurant are very responsible, because we raised the issue of orange juice with the housekeeper during breakfast on the first day, and took the initiative to contact them the next day and make better orange juice. This kind of detailed service is really impressive. very warm! There was also a female staff member of the Western restaurant. On the first night we ate in the Western restaurant and ordered dishes from the Chinese restaurant. One of the dishes, Sichuan-flavored five-spice beef, tasted too sweet. The girl took the initiative to help contact the Chinese restaurant and directly returned it after communication. Dishes, this move really reflects the customer-centered service level of this hotel! Finally, I have to praise Emily for taking the initiative to greet the children. After learning that the children liked the sweet-scented osmanthus cake, she quickly arranged for colleagues to deliver it. I like your thoughtfulness. I may not visit Yangshuo again next time, but I will come here again for vacation just for Banyan Tree. village!
I hope that friends who read this review must ask if they have any needs during their stay at the hotel, because these staff will really solve them and provide a perfect stay experience for everyone!
Wish all the staff all the best (🎖️¯^¯)ゞ

msg:When I went to Banyan Tree Yangshuo for the first time, I thought it was just an ordinary resort, but the reality really changed my view of excellent hotels. When I checked in, I got the latest feeling that this is a company with well-trained employees. The doorman enthusiastically guided us into the reception lobby. A few pieces of soft osmanthus candy at the front desk brought the sweetness into my heart; the hot towel washed away the fatigue of the journey. In particular, the detailed introduction by NORA, the receptionist and housekeeper at the front desk, gave us a basic understanding of the hotel quickly. This housekeeper is the most considerate of any hotel we have ever visited. When things are missing in the room, when we go out to call a taxi, when the facilities need to be repaired, when meals are arranged, etc., all of these things can be arranged immediately with just a message on WeChat. Moreover, saying hello in the morning, saying good night at night, and mentioning any difficulties by the way, it feels both meticulous and smooth. In short, I will come again in the future to experience the service here.

We upgraded to a two-bedroom villa and the room was large enough. The service is very good and meets all our needs. The breakfast is rich and there are many activities every day. You can feed peacocks, ducks and alpacas. We also participated in the bamboo raft tour on the Li River. The staff who drove the boat introduced us to the Lucky Cat Mountain and the Two Horses Crossing the River! There is also a small gift at the turndown service every day. The hotel also has a special area for fireworks, which is very close to our room. I went to the town specially to buy fireworks to set off, it was very enjoyable. Our butler Terry was also very attentive. Because I had my parents and children with me, I asked every day if we could arrange a car to take them to the restaurant. He would help us change pillows and responded to our requests. Especially kind. I really like this place and hope to stay here again if I have the opportunity.

msg:It’s not that Hua Shan Yun She is not beautiful, but Banyan Tree is even more surprising!
	
When I came to Yangshuo, I realized that it was a wise move to first go to Xingping and stay at Huashan Yunshe, and then go to Welfare Town and stay at Banyan Tree!
Emily, the housekeeper, is a sweet girl who is enthusiastic, considerate and gentle. She responds to all requests and responds promptly. She thoughtfully informs the surrounding traffic and weather conditions, and also reminds us of meal times and provides airport pick-up and drop-off arrangements. The service attitude is very satisfactory.
After transferring to the Banyan Tree, we booked a private bamboo raft at the hotel to continue rafting and check in. The bamboo raft boa**an said that one of the sections was the hotel’s private river. Sure enough, there were far fewer people than at the 20 yuan check-in area, and the water flow was smooth and slow. I will also explain the mountains by the river and the origin of their names. The most impressive thing is Lucky Cat Mountain. During the trip, the photographer also deliberately took a photo of us and the "Lucky Cat"☑️
Hotel travel photography is worth a try! The photographer will teach you various poses and framing. As for the national costumes, you can ask the hotel one day in advance to rent them for free. They fit well with the background of the Banyan Tree and have a very high photo rate. A total of five photos will be given for hotel travel photos, and an additional 30 yuan will be added. / picture, and finally selected 13 pictures in total! very satisfied!
I have always wanted to try the Banyan Tree SPA. There was a discount during the New Year, so I chose the Balinese massage, which lasted for 90 minutes. The Thai masseur worked in person, and the communication was smooth. He spoke softly and was very polite. The massage techniques were great and focused. If you want a shoulder and neck massage, the masseuse will feel a little sore when pressing. Whenever you feel pain and want to be lighter, her next technique will make you feel that the soreness and swelling are relieved a lot☑️
The nightly turn-down gift was a few pieces of small sweet-scented osmanthus cake, as well as scented candles and freshly brewed medicinal bath. What’s surprising is the Banyan Tree Zoo, which has greedy alpacas🦙 and family members’ open-tailed peacocks🦚. The hotel provides free feed to feed them☑️

After arriving at the hotel this time, the front desk upgraded us to a lake-view villa with two bedrooms and one living room because the price was reasonable. The butler's real-time docking service, as well as the hotel's tram tour and zoo feeding, are a great experience. I took my mother-in-law and brother out to play. Although my mother-in-law has limited legs and feet, the elderly family was very happy because of the hotel's attentive service. In addition, special thanks to the photographer Xiao Li who took photos for us in the housing package. She is very good at finding beautiful backgrounds, so every photo she takes is beautiful.

Here, my family and I would like to express our special thanks to Nora, the housekeeper with strong professionalism. Her meticulous and thoughtful attitude made our three days in Yangshuo full of good moods. When we first walked into the hotel to choose a room, she fully let us know the diversity of room types and introduced the hotel's various service activities in detail. They arranged the most reasonable time for us when we were cruising on the bamboo raft, helped us make reservations at the SPA center in a timely manner, and reminded us of special offers. I feel like I have her greetings and company all the time in Yangshuo. This is the spirit of Banyan Tree. I am very touched. I also want to thank Mona who served in the restaurant. Her gentleness and sweetness are unforgettable. When we left the hotel, we specially packed three small croissants and a cup of coffee from the breakfast room to drive on the road. She specially helped deliver them to the door; I also want to thank you at dinner. The chef I met, Chef Chen Fucai, the mugwort cake he gave me was fragrant, rich and sweet.
Thank you to the housekeeping staff who work hard and diligently. We go out all the time and have never met, but your work is amazing.

If we want to talk about the shortcomings, going to the hotel requires driving a country road, which is not very convenient at night when it rains. There is no takeout nearby, and the TV system in the room is also a bit outdated, so you have to put down modern electronic entertainment and concentrate on nature and people. Live by cultivating your mentality.

msg:The villa type we stayed in was very small for a resort hotel. It didn't feel like a vacation, which was a flaw. It was surrounded by a village and the environment was very dilapidated. The room facilities were old and aging, and it was inconvenient to go to Yulong River and other scenic spots. In short, the price/performance ratio was average. . The hotel's bamboo raft tour is along the Li River, and the scenery is average.

The butler Terry contacted us in advance to reserve various activities and decorate the room. He also made careful arrangements after check-in. Thumbs up! The overall service attitude of the hotel is good
The hotel environment is very nice and a**ospheric. It’s very relaxing to walk around. There are many activities in the hotel and it’s fun. You can have a good time just staying in the hotel, and you also caught up with the hotel’s New Year’s Eve activities~
Banyan Tree's spa is well-deserved, and its techniques are good to relieve fatigue.
The breakfast is rich in variety and delicious, which is very rare
I like the photos taken by travel photographer Xiao Li!

msg:Environment: The location of the hotel is average, the surrounding environment is relatively poor, and the park is smaller than other Banyan Trees. The hotel is located in the north of Lijiang River, but the view of the entire park is not wide and it is very boring.
Hygiene: The hygiene of the room is extremely poor. The sign in the room shows that it has not been wiped and cleaned for a long time. The gaps between the floor tiles are severely damaged. The small drink labels above the mini bar are shabby.
Service: The service is terrible. 1. The hair dryer in the room was not working. I was told to try another socket. The socket in the bathroom did not work. Finally, a socket in the corridor worked, but I could not blow dry my hair in the corridor. I washed my hair and did not dry it for two days after I checked in. . 2. The hotel's makeup mirror has poor contact. After reporting for repair, it will be repaired and a fruit plate will be provided. But this problem should be checked before guests check in. 3. The most annoying thing is that when we checked out on the first day of the new year, we were told that there was a Snickers bar missing from our room. We said that we didn’t eat it. During the few days we checked in, we didn’t see any Snickers bar in the hotel’s mini bar. The front desk staff Then you go and ask other people if they have eaten. I asked my friends who were traveling with me and they have never seen a Snickers bar. It was also said that we were missing a pair of flip-flops, but we didn't take them with us. We even looked at them next to the bathtub when we left. In the end, that was the solution. Although "that's it" the attitude of the front desk staff was really unacceptable. It is extremely disrespectful to the guests. The Chinese New Year is really terrible. 4. The attitude of the staff is very indifferent. When I saw the security room staff at the hotel gate, the child took the initiative to say hello, but the staff had no reaction at all. I don’t know whether he pretended not to hear or really couldn’t hear. The child spoke loudly and said it many times.
Facilities: The facilities and equipment in the room are seriously outdated, such as the hair dryer, which is old, heavy and cannot be used. The shower hose was leaking. There was a yellow stain under the toilet seat.
Turn-down gifts and snacks: Banyan Tree’s turn-down gifts are all a small turtle. The turn-down gifts on New Year’s Eve are a bit “unusual” and include a very cheap fabric empty red envelope and two pieces of sweet-scented osmanthus cake. It has greatly lowered the quality of Banyan Tree. Guests can feel whether the hotel carefully prepares gifts for guests.
All in all, Banyan Tree Yangshuo gave us a very bad stay experience. The price/performance ratio is extremely low, I will not come back or recommend.

There was a little hiccup during my stay. Manager Sophia solved the problem very satisfactorily. She upgraded the villa and also gave small gifts. She was able to raise various needs during the stay. Everyone will get good feedback, and there is no need to praise the environment. Banyan Trees in various places have their own characteristics. This time I came to Yangshuo, I am very satisfied. Banyan Tree is still the top resort!

The afternoon tea in the hotel was very nice and beautiful. Friends who like to check in recommended this option. The lion dance is in time for the Spring Festival.
       It is suitable for traveling with children. The concierge provides food for feeding fish and peacocks, and the children also experienced feeding ducks and alpacas. The room was clean and tidy. After playing all day, I took a bath and slept comfortably.

When I communicated with Lisa on the phone, she left a good impression on me and I chose the Banyan Tree without hesitation. The hotel has a beautiful environment. Because the park is so big, I have to contact a battery car to pick me up every time. Today, this guy saw that my feet were inconvenient (I sprained my feet at Ruyi Peak and it was difficult to walk) and he deliberately walked around the hotel. The facilities in the hotel were introduced, which were very good and made me very happy. During the 4 days and 3 nights we stayed, Xiaoxia came to clean the room, and she was meticulous and conscientious. And Miss Vicky at the front desk, because she was traveling to celebrate her daughter’s birthday this time, she arranged a birthday cake and afternoon tea. My daughter was very happy and likes you👍🏻 Yesterday, on my daughter’s birthday, she made an appoin**ent to make scented candles and delicate, gold products Ms. Anna from Ge is very friendly and provides careful guidance👍, which made her daughter have a happy and unforgettable 20th birthday🎉🙏👏

The location of the hotel is very convenient to various attractions in Yangshuo, and the breakfast variety is pretty good! The food served in the room tastes very good.

msg:This second time I came to Guilin, if it was Yulong River that made me like Yangshuo, then Banyan Tree Yangshuo made me fall in love with Yangshuo. Banyan Tree Yangshuo is actually next to Fuli Ancient Town. It is recommended to rent a car at the airport. It takes an hour and a half to drive there. It will be more convenient for future travel. It's the off-season now, so it's very cost-effective to stay for two nights and get one night free. However, you must first call the reservation depar**ent to find out if there is a room for the third night, and then call the reservation depar**ent once the order is successfully placed online. Implementation of the third night. I checked into the Mountain Impression Room on the 2nd floor of Building 7. The view is very good. The basic room type is more than 60 square meters. It is very comfortable to live in. Except that there is no place to store luggage, other details are well considered. And although it's over ten degrees here, it's still too hot to wear one if it's not raining, but two is enough if it's raining. There are a lot of activities in the hotel. You must check in and make a reservation one day in advance. If you complete five activities recently, you will get a non-woven bag. There are also peacocks, ducks, alpacas and pigs in the hotel that you can feed. The feed is free and is a favorite among children. If you are bored, you can drive to Xingping in the north, Gongcheng in the east, Lipu in the south, and Baisha in the west to eat and hang out. The most surprising thing is that these villages and towns have different specialties this season. Friends are welcome to explore it when you have time.

msg:A very satisfying trip. As a long-established luxury resort hotel, Banyan Tree’s location, environment and services are of course needless to say. The lady at the front desk is very considerate. She has added WeChat. If you have any questions, she can provide timely feedback and help solve them.
It is also worth mentioning that the package booked this time also comes with travel photography. Feifei's photographer is very professional and attentive. Because I personally like taking pictures and have relatively high requirements. After communicating with Feifei, he responded well to my requirements and even added his own ideas. The finished film is excellent in terms of composition, light and shadow, scene selection, and style, and the production rate is very high, which is no less than the high-priced studio photos outside. Like the photographer Feifei👍 For sisters who like traveling and taking photos, when you check in to make a photography appoin**ent, you can try to make a special appoin**ent with Feifei~~

I am very grateful to the housekeeper Emily for her attentive service, which is almost responsive to every request. It can be said to have improved the overall stay experience. There were not many people here this time, and it was open-air. The heated swimming pool is very good and very exciting! The food tastes good and the portions are quite large. The chef also came over to ask us about our experience. It happened to be my wife's birthday, and the hotel also gave me a small cake. The overall service level of the staff in the hotel is quite high, and everyone greets me with a smile when passing by. For those who want to travel on their backs, the pace here is just right. If you want to experience the holiday feeling in depth instead of just checking in at scenic spots, Banyan Tree Yangshuo is a good choice.

In particular, Ms. Joss at the front desk has added WeChat and can be said to be responsive to all requests.
Let’s talk about the activities. The sunset ceremony and the nightfall ceremony are both very nice. There is a small performance in the sunset ceremony, and you can also dance together. After playing, there is a free tea break, drinks and meals. Sitting on the steps can just enjoy the entire sunset time. During the night ritual, I lit up aromatherapy and took an essential oil bath. There was also a cute little turtle gift placed on the bed. The child was very happy. It’s really full of ritual feeling.
There are many other activities in the hotel, including Chinese painting teachers teaching fan painting. There are private waters of the Li River for bamboo rafting... and unlimited fish food and bird food to feed alpacas.
You can also put flowers. You can pick up a car on the way here and set them off before 8:30 in the evening. The hotel will be accompanied by dedicated service personnel, which is really thoughtful.
Then there is the food and beverage, which is average, neither outstanding nor unpalatable.
Although the hotel is not particularly big, it is definitely not boring to stay in the village for two days without going out. It is recommended for the elderly and children.

There is really no reason to like this brand: good location, great view, great service, and lots of food. Seven years later, I came here again, and it was still the same private pier to tour the second half of the Baili River: the river is a green belt, the mountains are like jasper bamboo, a bamboo raft is walking gracefully in it, and the phoenix tail bamboos on both sides are swaying. , breathtakingly beautiful; passing by Eagle Mountain, Maoer Mountain and other lifelike peaks, you can take in the green water of the Li River and embrace the stretch of Jinxiu Mountain.
This time I also met two particularly enthusiastic and beautiful ladies: Rihanna and Bonnie. They are dedicated, gentle and meticulous, adding a layer of spiritual comfort to the already beautiful journey.

He also very considerately accommodated our family of 7. , arranged a room in a nearby villa. In order to facilitate our entry and exit, they also gave us an extra room card. During our 2-day stay, they enthusiastically asked for warmth when we were cold. When we checked out, they also prepared a bag of fruit drinks and a small potted mimosa plant for us. They are really warm and considerate as souvenirs. This stay-in promotion also includes a free one-hour travel photo shoot. You can also borrow Zhuang costumes from the counter to take photos for free, allowing our family to leave beautiful memory photos. It is really great. According to the arrangement, there are 2 cute and clean alpacas and mini pigs in the hotel. There are peacocks walking around the street during breakfast. There is also a one-hour bamboo raft experience... there are too many surprises to mention. The bath oil in the room smells very good. It was very sweet and soothing.

The fun travel photography service provided by the hotel during our stay was great👍The photographer was not only good at taking photos, but also patiently taught us how to better present ourselves. Every photo was like a carefully crafted work of art. I am really grateful that he helped us record these precious memories.

msg:Because it is a Banyan Tree, my expectations are higher than those of an average five-star hotel. I have stayed at different Banyan Tree hotels in various places around the world. The Banyan Tree in Yangshuo has lived up to my expectations for this brand in terms of location, hardware facilities and service content. Banyan Tree has always been able to seamlessly combine and amplify high-end hotel services with local culture, providing the most high-end cultural and tourism experience. Yangshuo’s incomparable natural scenery is obviously the specialty of the Banyan Tree brand. Banyan Tree Yangshuo adopts a Chinese classical courtyard design. Although the building and courtyard occupy a small area, the close contact with carps, ducks, and peacocks in the hotel is amazing. Bonus points for photography in ethnic costumes and a one-hour bamboo raft tour. We moved in at the end of October and the weather was very suitable. For breakfast, lunch and dinner, we experienced the all-day western restaurant and Chinese restaurant respectively. There is still room for improvement in the Western food section of the Western restaurant, but the quality of Chinese food in the two restaurants is very good. The infinity swimming pool in Wangjiang is very nice, but the gym is a bit small and the equipment is not sufficient and needs to be improved. I have always believed that domestic hotel gyms do not need too many treadmills. With such a beautiful scenery, running outdoors is enough. I didn’t experience the spa this time, so I can’t comment. The considerate butler service is the highlight of the whole experience. The service of the little butler Chad was just right and made our entire stay very comfortable. We can feel the efforts put into the management and service of the entire hotel. Check-in, dining and various experiences cost 3000RMB+/night. Although it should be the most expensive hotel in Yangshuo, it is indeed worth every penny. Thank you to all the hotel staff for providing a wonderful stay experience. I will choose Banyan Tree next time I go to Yangshuo.

After checking in, the lady was very nice and helped me apply for Late Check Out due to my upcoming itinerary. Thank you so much! There are also many little messages of warm reminders! There is really no need to be careless about anything after checking in. Emily is there to help arrange everything.

Miss Li from the travel photography team is super good at taking photos! Every picture is so beautiful and eye-catching!

The service from Mona and Jolin in the restaurant was also super considerate - the weather was too hot and they brought us a mobile cooling fan! It’s really a big thank you to them~~

I almost forgot to mention that Mandy's technology at the SPA is also top-notch. The massage was completely relaxing!

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Emily Mandy Mona Jolin and Xiao Li. Your considerate service has greatly improved the experience of staying here. I will definitely choose Banyan Tree again next time I come to Guilin. 🥰🥰🥰

msg:Comments: Banyan Tree is the most satisfactory hotel for our family to stay in Yangshuo. We are so happy and satisfied that we don’t want to change hotels, but also want to extend our room and stay.
Below are some of my experiences staying at Banyan Tree for you to share. First of all, Nora, the Banyan Tree housekeeper, was responsible and responsible. She arranged everything for our check-in. When we arrived at the store, there were staff to help guests bring their travel packages to their rooms. They also provided fruits and gifts. The front desk was able to find ways to help solve any problems we encountered. , very heart-warming; all the staff at Rongzhuang are well-trained, very polite and sincerely kind from top to bottom. Secondly, the hotel's internal facilities are very unique, luxurious and modern. For example, the photo hotel is indeed very photogenic, with mountains and rivers, close to the Li River, and Hui-style buildings with white walls and gray tiles. The hotel has its own pier and bamboo raft experience, and the guest-only bamboo raft tour is great. The hotel is very quiet and comfortable. The car is parked in the parking lot and a battery car is used to transport you to your room and travel. There is a sunset ceremony in the evening and a beautiful infinity pool. There are also many activities arranged. It can be said that you don’t have to go out to the surrounding attractions in the hotel garden. Find fun in activities.
Finally, in terms of catering, the breakfast is very good and the variety is very rich. The taste of Baiyun Chinese Restaurant is good, really delicious, and the dishes are rich in styles. Chef Yang and Chef Chen can walk out of the kitchen and walk to the guests' table to ask how the dishes taste. According to the guests The taste required to make various dishes is really rare and valuable.
Overall, I feel that the hotel management system is very complete and the managers are competent and capable. The most important thing is to be attentive, serious and responsible. The employees also show their dedication and dedication, and the management is very good. I think this hotel will have a bright future and there will be many repeat guests to stay again. Overall we are very satisfied and will bring friends to Banyan Tree next time!

msg:The biggest advantage of the two-bedroom Riverside Villa in Banyan Tree that I stayed in this time is that it is quiet! Very quiet! In fact, other villas can be chosen if the price is affordable, they are all pretty good!

         Banyan Tree is located in a relatively remote place in Yangshuo. I basically spent two days in the hotel. There are ducks, peacocks, fish, alpacas, and little fragrant pigs. There is unlimited supply of feed, and I even played bubbles in the swimming pool! There is a sunset ceremony at 17:45 every afternoon, with drinks and snacks! The service is also relatively good, and travel photography is also given away. Although the travel photography service is average, the weather is too hot and the baby is unwilling to take pictures. I chose two more photos, 20 ones, and the photos are okay!

      The delivery is an electric bamboo raft. This time I went to Guilin and stayed in several hotels. Only Banyan Tree has a follow-up visit, and the leftovers have also been sent to us, thank you! Ailsa, the housekeeper, was added when I checked in. She really replied in a timely manner and the service was good! Will consider Banyan Tree in the future

Hygiene: This must be praised. My girlfriend specifically said that there were basically no bites. The cleanliness reflects the standard of Banyan Tree.
Environment: Very good. The sunset in the Banyan Tree lobby should have been considered when building the hotel. The flowers and plants inside the hotel reflect refinement and are very comfortable. There is a unique cave near the mountains and rivers.
Service: It is best to mention the service. Except for the delay for a while when we first arrived (there are many 10.1 guests, this is understandable, and they also took the initiative to delay our subsequent check-out). Special praise to our housekeeper Emily, who responded to every request, very good👍.
Suggestions: 1. Diversity of food and beverages. Banyan Tree Yangshuo is different from other places. You have to make your food and beverages better than those around you to make people willing to stay. You can’t let people eat two meals and then think about ordering takeout; 2. .Details of service, for example: for breakfast ice cream, some naughty children will open the freezer and ignore it, but the restaurant service staff must have this awareness and close it when they see it, otherwise other guests will spend a lot of money, similar to etc.
Breakfast: very rich
1 hour in-store travel photography: appropriate arrangement, professional photography
Turndown Gift Snack: Very Delicious Fruit

The hotel's gardening master basically did all the work by hand. There was no sound of the lawnmower, which gave me a good rest. Fruits and small gifts are also delivered every day. Full of heart.

The breakfast is rich in variety. I have tried both the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant for dinner, and both are of good quality. Although Bamboo Raft is not in the Shili Gallery location, I am satisfied that I don’t have to queue up in the morning to get crowded. There is also a shop in the hotel where we bought some small items that we liked in the room.

I would like to praise our housekeeper Sophia by name. She is very enthusiastic and helps arrange every detail. And when we had a cold, they took the initiative to greet us and give us medicine, etc. Will come back again in the future!

msg:I traveled to Yangshuo and stayed at Banyan Tree for three days. I had a great experience and was very satisfied. Special thanks to Terry, the butler, for making us feel at home. We received greetings from the butler every morning, asking if there were any activities we wanted to do today or if there was anything we needed him to do. He was extremely attentive and attentive, and responded to our requests. We made candles and forgot to pick them up. When we remembered, they were already closed. We just asked Terry about the opening and closing times of the Banyan Tree Pavilion, and he coordinated and brought them out for us. If we wanted to listen to music, he found them for us. Speaker; I went to Baiyun Restaurant to eat, forgot to reserve a seat, and didn't sit by the window. I didn't think I could change it. I just mentioned it to the housekeeper when we were talking about other things, and he moved us to the window seat after a while. I wanted to take my baby fishing, but I was optimistic about the time but didn’t know that I needed to make a reservation. Finally, I learned that reservations were required and I thought I wouldn’t be able to fish. However, Terry helped us coordinate the trip. In short, we thought about what the guests wanted and did their best to meet the guests’ requirements. On the day of departure, the housekeeper should be taking a rest, but he still received text messages to greet me when I got home, so I was very satisfied with the service of the housekeeper. There are many activities in the hotel, some of which require reservation in advance, so children will not be bored while staying. Feeding small animals can provide free feed. Finally, I would like to make two suggestions: 1. The fruits I send are not delicious, have no moisture, are not sweet and are not fresh, otherwise I will not send them. If you want to send a small amount, they must be of high quality. 2. There are too few meal options at the sunset event, only fried food, which is not healthy! The quality has dropped a lot from when it first opened.
Two-person bamboo raft tour on the Li River: great experience, the scenery is particularly beautiful
1-hour travel photography in the store: very good, good service

msg:Taking your parents to stay at the Banyan Tree is the most correct choice for the entire trip.
The location of the hotel is very secluded, with winding paths leading to secluded areas. Even the driver who dropped us off didn't know that there was a luxury hotel hidden here. Friends who like privacy must choose this place.
This time I chose the Jingxinxuan Villa. The room type comes with a small courtyard where you can enjoy tea with your family and enjoy the mountain view. The patio at the entrance is also uniquely decorated, making you feel like you are at home. The room turndown service is very considerate and will provide lemongrass essential oil.
The service is even more impeccable. From the moment of check-in to the round-the-clock service of the housekeeper to the random employee you meet in the hotel, it reflects the hotel's hospitality and full of friendliness.
I would like to express my special thanks to two employees. One is the housekeeper Nora. She really takes good care of her. She also takes the initiative and reminds me at the right time every time. She reminds me of breakfast at 9 o'clock and arranges a car to pick her up. She also helps in advance for dinner. When making a reservation, we will arrange a refrigeration machine if the air-conditioning is insufficient. We really think about what the customers want.
The other one is Allisa, the manager of the SPA. This time I went to experience singing bowl therapy. In just 45 minutes, I really left the hustle and bustle of the city, put aside all my worries, and completely relaxed. We even chatted for a long time after the project, about everything from work pressure to healing effects. Even my parents said it was magical after returning to the room after the project, and they wanted to experience it again in the future. Allisa’s calm energy seemed to have infected her. We are a family.
The hotel also has many activities to experience, such as feeding fish and alpacas, archery, sunset ceremonies, etc., you will never be bored. It is definitely a good choice to let yourself rest here quietly for three days.

The only things that need improvement: 1: The fruit is very average, not sweet enough, and not fresh enough. I ate one and found it difficult to eat. If the selected fruit is not good, don’t send it away. 2: For breakfast, the chicken sausage is not good, it is a bit hard. There are Cantonese dim sum, wind claws, tripe, and pork ribs. There are relatively few of these items. After the customer has finished picking them up, they have to wait for a while. Corn, coffee, soybean milk, eggs, and porridge are very good, and the others are average. , freshly squeezed juice, the fruit is not good enough, the juice is quite sour. Although the food needs to be improved, the feeling of the whole Banyan Tree is very good. Looking forward to coming back next holiday! ! !

The hotel environment is beautiful, the Huizhou architecture and Yangshuo landscape are combined together, creating an endless artistic conception. Although the hotel is not new, all the facilities are well maintained. There were peacocks playing nearby during breakfast, and the bamboo raft experience provided was not perfunctory. The hotel has a lot of projects, but unfortunately I don’t have time to participate in them all. The children also experienced four-wheel bicycles for the first time. In the past few days, the housekeepers Amanda and Nora have responded very promptly and provided very attentive services. They always answered all questions. They must give high praise. Come to beautiful Yangshuo next time!

msg:Staying in a group hotel focuses on comfort, smiling and friendly service from the staff, Soviet-style garden decoration, well-maintained flowers and trees, and first-class vacation relaxation. We booked for two nights. When we checked in, our butler Terry helped us upgrade the villa and added WeChat to help us arrange activities and book spas. Thank you very much. Because it happened to rain heavily for two days, it was very chill to take pictures in the room, rest and take a bath, and the hotel also has a lot of activities. Even if it rained, we didn’t participate in many outdoor activities. We traveled on the electric bamboo raft on the Li River without worrying about the sun and rain. The shower and spa are also great. The restaurant's products are also good. Surprisingly, they have Cantonese steamed snacks for tea. It's so small that you don't need to eat too much. It's very considerate. If you sit outdoors and dine, there will be peacocks to accompany you.
Finally, thank you to Terry, the housekeeper, for helping us with arrangements and replying to messages in a timely manner. When we checked out, he sent us a special message to say hello even though he didn’t have any gifts for us. Also, Penny, the room housekeeper, helped with laundry, cleaning, and small gifts. I look forward to following you. See you next time.

Mario, the housekeeper at the hotel, helped me upgrade my room type to a villa with a courtyard, which was very considerate ~ The overall environment of the park is very good, and the staff would greet me with a smile ~ I look forward to meeting you next time haha
Because our room type comes with free travel photography, we chose to take photos early in the morning when the light is not so strong. Xiaojing is a girl who is very good at taking photos. She doesn’t like the feeling of staged photos. The photos she gave me are all in a very natural style ~ If you have If your friends go to Yangshuo, they will definitely recommend it.

Surrounded by mountains, Hui-style buildings, green trees and white walls, peacocks walk freely and casually, and the koi in the pond rush to feed when they see people coming, as if it is an exchange condition for breaking into their living territory, hahaha
The Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant have their own characteristics. The housekeeper Lesi is very considerate and can help you make reservations and various arrangements during your stay. You can ask her to help coordinate arrangements. Lesi is also a careful girl, she even cares about whether the temperature of the air conditioner is appropriate, hahaha
There are many activities in the hotel. I participated in the bamboo rafting on the Lijiang River. I experienced a lot of local lifestyles along the Lijiang River. When I saw the cows eating water and grass, the bamboo raft staff deliberately slowed down to let the children observe closely. The day before leaving, I also booked the hotel's paddle boarding activities, which is definitely YYDS, the best experience of this trip, bar none. The coach Zhong arranged by the hotel is also very powerful. Under his guidance, my baby and I quickly learned the basic skills of paddle boarding, and we can already stand up and paddle.
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel for the small gift. This bamboo bookmark really won my heart. I look forward to going to the summer vacation again next time!

The children were also very happy playing various parent-child activities in the store, scented candles , hydrangea, fishing 🎣, swimming 🏊♀️... none of them were missed.

Let me also talk about the disadvantages: the facilities in the villa rooms are actually good, but there is a small bubble pool, and the bathtub can basically make up for it, but it would be perfect if the bubble pool is outdoors; the time for feeding animals can be adjusted. After all, if you go to the surrounding attractions during the day, if It is better to adjust it to be earlier or later; many items in the room are hung with tags "only for use in the hotel, if you need to buy, please go to 7502", if you don't feel much in one or two places, but hanging everywhere Embarrassing, is your item design a bit confusing?

A deposit is required for check-in, which can be deducted for consumption in the hotel. The bamboo raft crew booked by the hotel in the morning is very considerate and will explain all the way. It lasts for 1 hour. There is drinking water on board, and the bamboo raft at 8:40 is very cool.

msg:The reserved two-bedroom villa on the Lijiang River is convenient for the family to gather together at night. The room has an orthodox wooden structure, high ceilings, and a good sense of space. The master bedroom uses a sliding door to separate the bathroom facilities. The bathroom bathtub has a large space for washing. The matching toiletries have tie-dyed blue cloth as the base tone, which is very suitable for this wooden house. Unfortunately, it is midsummer, the master bedroom and living room are exposed to the west, and the temperature is a bit high in the evening. Hou, after repairing the air conditioner for two days, I was really drunk. In this matter, the value of the hotel’s name as Banyan Tree has definitely been lost. The duty manager has already sent someone to repair it, and it has been delayed again and again. This makes people very uncomfortable. In the huge Banyan Tree, it is absolutely impossible for the residents to spend their days with air conditioners at the price of 1w, not only the rooms, but also the Baiyun Restaurant, so I have to look here🙄️
What kind of brain circuit operator came up with a peerless idea.
The pleasant scenery of the whole manor is worthy of praise, and many hotel self-operated projects have been opened. The small number of people means good quality and experience.
The advantages of the housekeeper cannot be reflected, but the speed of room service delivery is responsive, which is worthy of praise.
The hotel bamboo raft is also a very good project, and the water area is very open, the bus time is very fixed, there is only one bus, and there are very few people on it, but it feels very refreshing to ride once in a while, the air conditioner is sufficient, and the driver is very nice.
The various feeding of animals is a great pleasure of the hotel. Children love it very much. The hotel also provides special feed. This is very good. Even the alpacas have two coffee and white ones, which are so cute.
The hotel can also rent ethnic costumes to customers, which is also very interesting.
Perhaps the many inconveniences in the mountains have caused the unsatisfactory air-conditioning system, but it should not be an excuse for the managers to shirk their resignation. Since the problem has already occurred, we still hope that it can be taken seriously and refurbished. The hot weather, the sun in the west, and the age are not what a brand should have. Excuse, if this is a homestay today, I understand, but you are sorry you are called Banyan Tree!

This point really makes people feel that the service is very good. I also gave the children a lucky bag, two turtles, and a mimosa before leaving! ! !

The lady in charge of the reception, Doreen Qin, has a very good service attitude and is very gentle. I give it a thumbs up. Staying for two nights, the experience is very good, the environment is good, suitable for parents and children or a family to relax leisurely, there are also some small activities for children in the park, the children like it very much. When visiting the park, there will be a battery car to pick you up and drop you off, which is super convenient. Banyan Tree is indeed the legendary Hermes Hotel, except for being expensive, there is nothing wrong with it. The children are also lingering, and if they come to Guilin next time, it will be the first choice hotel.
Finally, let’s talk about catering. There are relatively few eats around, and takeaway is too far away. There is only one Chinese restaurant and one western restaurant in the hotel. I have eaten at both, but they are a bit expensive, but the taste is still very good. If you don't mind the price, you can try them.

The concierge can rent bicycles for free, and you can simply ride around to see the scenery. The misty rain in Guilin is viewed from different angles, the flowers are beautiful, Beautiful architecture, beautiful environment! Thoughtful Tips Chinese restaurants can ask for snail noodles. For breakfast, Guilin noodles are delicious, and there is also hand-made lemon tea. The variety is so complete that you can’t tell if you are having breakfast at a Chaozhou hotel;
The bamboo raft experience is superb, and the master is warm and hospitable. He introduced what landscapes he saw along the way, and what he did before;
This is simply perfect for a family outing!

During the check-in process, a small turtle was given, and a sunny mimosa was also given when check-out. The bamboo rafts on the Li River are better than those in Xingping, and the water is clearer. However, the sanitation of the swimming pool needs to be improved. A child vomited in it, and the staff on the side were indifferent. The housekeeper Vicky has a very good service. He helped to inform the battery car to pick up and drop off in a timely manner. Because I arrived early, I also arranged for an earlier check-in.

My younger brothers and sisters have been patiently helping me to coordinate and settle down, so that I would not wear wet trouser legs and shoes soaked in the river. For several hours, I specially arranged a room with a better view and scenery, so I could have a good rest. Special thanks to my housekeeper, Terry, who helped me coordinate the room and arrange the pick-up and drop-off for the Lijiang River tour. He was very thoughtful and meticulous. He helped me think about everything I didn't think of. It was very convenient. After I left, I did my best to help me find The little things I left in the hotel must be highly praised. This kind of service and care really makes people love Banyan Tree!
There is nothing to say about the environment of this hotel in Yangshuo. Guilin’s unique landscape and local architectural style are very distinctive. The infinity swimming pool is also on the edge of the Li River. In the swimming pool, there is an ecologically beautiful world and a peaceful scene in front of me, especially when the bamboo raft swims to some places, it even gives me the illusion of the original Jurassic ecology in the movie~
There are local ethnic activities in the hotel that you can participate in, and it’s good to take pictures of the sunset, but the most enjoyable thing for me is to walk the ducks to tease the peacocks. This kind of free-range animals can go out at will and don’t know when they will come back. It’s very relaxing, and It's a little fun that I want to laugh out of nowhere~

I couldn't wear flip-flops and even helped me find slippers for the spa. During the period, my family was a little unwell, and Nora was always concerned. The hotel is far away from Yangshuo County, about 10 kilometers away, so it has a quiet surrounding environment. All kinds of small animals can be seen everywhere in the original ecological resort. The hotel also raises alpacas and peacocks, which is very interesting. At night, there are cicadas and frogs, which is a good place to let yourself go. However, the taste of the hotel’s dishes is average. If it’s an ordinary private room, it’s understandable, but the price here seems to be a bit out of reach. After all, the resort has nothing else to eat, and most of them are settled in the hotel’s internal restaurant. I hope to improve the dishes in the future.

Whether it is the environment, the comfort of the breakfast villa, the cleanliness and the enthusiasm of the staff, I would like to thank the handsome chad for reminding and helping me without bringing a notebook. In case of an emergency, I was reminded in time of the various activities in the hotel. It is so rich that I am very happy after playing for a day.

msg:A very satisfying trip that exceeded expectations in all aspects. The whole family travels together with two adults, two elders and two children, and booked a two-bedroom villa on the Lijiang River, with two extra beds in the living room. I called one day in advance to confirm the itinerary, room requirements and bamboo raft time. After arriving at the store, I checked in very enthusiastically, and took the initiative to add WeChat to facilitate contact at any time. The WeChat name BTCNYS Duty Manager is very 👍. The environment of the park is very good, and the room facilities are also very complete. Although it is a bit old, it is still very nice and comfortable, and it faces the Li River with a good view. The bamboo rafts are ready to sit without queuing. The breakfast is very rich. The quality is higher than the Shangri-La where I lived in downtown Guilin two days ago. I also ate at the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant. The taste is good. The cost-effective Chinese restaurant is relatively better. The battery car service is convenient. It is very convenient to be there when you are called, and the parking can be parked underground or on the ground. All the service staff I met are very enthusiastic. In the afternoon, I drove to West Street for 40 minutes, and in the evening, Sanjie Liu drove back to the hotel for more than 20 minutes after watching Impression. I will book here next time I come to Yangshuo.

It was full of artistic sense, just like a modern museum, so I was looking forward to Yangshuo. Sure enough, it has Guangxi characteristics! Surrounded by mountains, misty and rainy, it is unique. The hotel also has peacocks, ducks and koi, which the children love!
The service attitude is from the doorman to the front desk to the butler Lesi, everyone on the road is smiling and full of sincerity, and the housekeeper Lesi also responds in a timely manner and arranges properly! Concerned about the safety of the guest's itinerary, do you need help! Very caring!
The hotel's travel photography service is also good, and the bamboo raft is also fun. I went to the spa to experience it while my children were playing. Just in time for an event on Wednesday, I had a one-hour deep massage at 580. I liked it so much and it was so comfortable!
Sure enough, chain star hotels are different! Quality assurance!

The rooms in Banyan Tree are bigger and more comfortable, and Tangshe is more considerate in service ￼A**ospheric, the hotel's toilets are still flushed with side-mounted cold water pipes in the tropics of Southeast Asia, which is very inconvenient and uncomfortable in cold weather. It is recommended to change to smart toilets. The hotel has peacock alpacas and small animals. The environment is friendly and they are not afraid of people. The interaction is very good. The garden view of the hotel is beautiful, the flowers are in full bloom, and the sunset next to the Lijiang River is beautiful!

Hygiene: The temperature of the room is very comfortable, and the smell of aromatherapy makes people feel very comfortable
Environment: It feels like a manor, with peacocks (fortunately saw it opening its tail), cute alpacas, chunky little pigs, cute ducks, a lot of goldfish, and the greenery is not good Said, the whole is very suitable for vacation, very quiet...
Two-person bamboo raft tour experience on the Li River: There is a feeling that the Li River is covered by the villa
Facilities: I have to talk about the shortcomings, that is, the hardware in the room is more intelligent, it would be better

Thanks to the housekeeper Emily for the full service, and will remind you of the participation time and precautions for various activities. This time I booked a suite, but the small villa was upgraded for free, and the furnishings are still very good. The coffee machine and mangosteen in the room were well received, especially the mangosteen. The family members just had a bad throat, and they were basically fine after drinking it. I am very satisfied with the experience of various activities in Banyan Tree, and the reminders are also in place, but the bath water needs to wait for a while before it reaches the hottest state. I feel that I can remind the guests. The lead dancer for the sunset ceremony is an elderly lady. I feel the hotel's dedication to local ethnic activities. It's very good. I will consider other Banyan Tree resorts in the future~
Two-person bamboo raft tour experience on the Li River: very worthwhile, the total time is one hour, it is an electric raft, you don’t need to book the Li River after playing this, but you still need to go to the Yulong River if you want to experience hand support.

Small bridges, flowing water, pavilions, pavilions and pavilions complement each other, and the vegetation is rich and lush. Looking at the lush greenery, it is indeed a secret place to hide from the world. There are peacocks walking freely in the park, colorful koi and ducks in the pond, and you can also feed alpacas and little fragrant pigs regularly.
The location of Banyan Tree is relatively remote, which is more suitable for vacation, recuperation and relaxation. You can only drive or charter a car to visit the surrounding attractions. The hotel provides a shuttle bus to West Street.
The hotel room facilities fully reflect its sense of age, which does not match the star rating of the hotel. The facilities are relatively old, the bathroom has a peculiar smell, the mattress is very uncomfortable, and the sound is loud when you move it a little. The power socket in the room is loose and unreal, which affects the use.
The hotel's breakfast tastes very good, divided into Chinese and Western styles. There are also a lot of varieties. My favorite is small rice in bamboo tube and rice noodles in soup. Steamed short ribs and chicken feet are also very delicious. The meals in the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant are very good, and the price is very high. Every dish made by the chef is delicious and exquisite. In particular, the waiters in the western restaurant are warm and thoughtful, which is worthy of praise.
The experience of Banyan Tree in Yangshuo was not bad. All the waiters I encountered were very polite, and the battery car was also very convenient to use. Butler little beauty Lesi

The parent-child room I chose with my baby this time, the Super Wings toy is very suitable for children, but it will be a little expensive if you need to buy it. It would be great if you can give a small toy as a gift! Looking out from the balcony, the view of the Huxin Pavilion is very beautiful. There are many cute animals in the hotel. In addition to all kinds of fish in the lake, there are also groups of ducks and two cute cats. The highlight is the free-range animals. Peacock, after two days of searching, we finally met the peacock father and the peacock mother who just gave birth! Although the hotel opened early, the environmental sanitation is indeed very high standard. There are many choices for breakfast. The freshly cooked Guilin rice noodles and Cantonese dim sum taste quite satisfactory. I ordered a Chinese meal in the evening. The fried rice and tea fragrant kiln chicken were amazing! The hotel’s free bamboo rafts are not available because children are required to be over 7 years old or over 110cm to ride~ The hotel also sent free travel photos. The photographer is very professional, and the photos are beautiful! It is worth mentioning that the butler Vicky's service is very meticulous. Knowing that the baby is used to drinking Nongfu Spring, he delivered a lot of bottles on time every day, and took the trouble to answer my travel strategy questions and gave me a lot of thoughtful suggestions! In general, the hotel is almost perfect except that it is a little more expensive and the location is indeed a bit off! The only suggestion I made is to provide good night desserts like other homestays~ (The cookies they send are actually very suitable for babies)

msg:Needless to say, Banyan Tree is very suitable for taking the baby to play. Entering the lobby gate, you will be attracted by the beautiful scenery in front of you. The rainy day is gloomy but the misty rain is also beautiful. On the first night, I was lucky to meet the Earth Hour banquet organized by the hotel. All guests are welcome to participate, which is very meaningful. Banyan Tree's service has always been reliable. Thank you to every staff member we met, making our experience very close to perfect🌷🌷💐

msg:Full marks for service: Celine at the front desk and Zhang Xiaoyan in the guest room are warm and thoughtful
Full score for the environment: The front desk has upgraded a two-bedroom villa in Lijiang, with a beautiful view. The most cost-effective ones are Garden View and Meditation Villas. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and rivers, so you can stay for two days without going out.
Full marks for the activity: I experienced fishing and archery feeding pets, and the children also experienced some manual activities. The complimentary bamboo rafting is also very good.
Full score for catering: The restaurant is delicious! The breakfast is exquisite.
Full score for experience: The overall experience is very good. The battery car can also arrive quickly for pick-up.

Will go again, recommended!

msg:Facilities: The hardware facilities of Banyan Tree are still very good👍. There are Banyan Tree Pavilion, gym, outdoor swimming pool, children's corner, and various ecological supporting facilities that are infinitely close to nature.
Hygiene: The windows of Banyan Tree's manor are bright and clean, and the roads are clean and orderly. The green belt is also well trimmed and well maintained.
Environment: Banyan Tree is hidden in the unpretentious mountains of Yangshuo County, Piling is beside the beautiful and winding Lijiang River, and you can have a panoramic view of Yangshuo, Guilin.
Service: Banyan Tree's check-in service surprised me. My personal butler service lady Vicky is very nice and considerate. From the check-in and the follow-up suggested discount to upgrade the villa we felt very suitable and warm. The 1-hour free travel photography provided by the hotel is also very good. I feel that some of my blockbuster films came out of this. After all, SLR and one-on-one photographer services are rare. I was secretly happy in my heart. It is really worth it to stay in such a beautiful Banyan Tree and also provide such a high-end travel photography package, and it is free. At the same time, we can also see that Banyan Tree spends so much effort and cost to maintain the experience of every guest staying in Banyan Tree. Here is also a compliment to the 👍Miss photographer who took a trip to shoot is very good👍, in the face of the hot weather, she still communicates with customers so seriously, waits patiently and explains. In addition, the hotel also gave an exclusive 1-hour rafting service on the Li River, which was also very good. The rafting brother was enthusiastic, explained to us rich content, and communicated very well. It can be seen that these service personnel have been carefully selected by the management team of Banyan Tree to provide excellent services for every distinguished guest staying in Banyan Tree.
The trip to Banyan Tree in Yangshuo was great, and everything about the hotel exceeded my personal expectations. It must be strongly recommended as a person. If I have the opportunity to come to Yangshuo next time, Banyan Tree will definitely be my best choice.
Two-person bamboo raft tour experience on the Li River: The project arrangement in the early morning of the next day, the service is very good, and there are no shortcomings except for the colder weather.
1-hour travel photo shoot in the store: It’s great~ The hotel also provides ethnic costumes, but I couldn’t manage them successfully because it was too hot.
Night bed gift snacks: I have prepared small biscuits ~ dolls of little turtles.

She responded quickly to some inquiries, which is great. When we checked in, we were given two special hydrangeas. After we checked in, we would kindly ask if we had any fruit we liked. There would also be a follow-up visit by the staff at breakfast the next day. Any problem can be dealt with in the first time, and the Chinese food in the hotel is also delicious, and the portion is huge! !

Scenery: The Lijiang River tour is very beautiful and quiet, really like walking into a landscape painting. Please see the picture for details

It is very important to add the housekeeper's WeChat account! Very important! ! Very important! ! ! Everything can be arranged by the housekeeper and asked the housekeeper. Reply at the speed of light, send water, send slippers, be late for contact, print winter vacation homework, greet each other in the morning... is it all-powerful~ and the internal linkage is excellent. I asked on WeChat to get 4 bottles of water, but the housekeeper said yes, and then 10 seconds later There is room service to bring water. The souvenirs are also very thoughtful. The first day is a sandbag turtle, the second day is a national wallet, and the departure is an osmanthus sapling. The cooperating travel shooter is aesthetically pleasing, and the filming in rainy days is also great. The blue Zhuang costume (ask the butler for free) is very high-end. The river view room has been upgraded, and you can see the river water and Fengwei bamboo when you open the door. Even on a rainy day, drinking osmanthus tea and enjoying the smoke and rain in the lobby is a must. When the weather is not so good, I personally suggest staying in the hotel instead of going out. Every staff member is very attentive and professional. The restaurant squeezed 2 cups of juice. The fat brother saw that he couldn't finish it all at once, so he kindly helped me to deliver it to the dining table; the concierge car picked up at the lobby was also responsible for distributing feed for fish and peacocks. Polite and close. The only thing that I think can be improved is that there is no tourist map. I think it can be given (^^) five-star praise. I hope to come again~ I don’t know how many years the regular guest stay discount is valid for, hahaha!

It is understandable that there are many people during the summer vacation, but such a big brand cannot reduce the service quality just because of the large number of people. It should be solved from the moment you check in. Problems include the customer service phone not being able to get through, the large number of people having to wait for a table without informing them in advance, the guest rooms not being cleaned thoroughly, and the guest's clothes being washed... In short, the experience was too bad, and the originally good family trip was greatly compromised!

It was a villa-type room. It’s not separate. It’s different from what we expected. There are several rooms and a courtyard. If you are obsessed with the villa courtyard, I recommend Xiangzhang Huaping. It is very comfortable to stay alone. The only consolation is that the sunset is indeed beautiful, but the room It can be said that there is no view at all. There are free-range peacocks, geese and ducks in the hotel.

2. Added the WeChat account of the manager on duty, and he (she) can be contacted for all kinds of needs, such as ordering a shuttle bus, fruit, room deliveries, extra needs, etc., etc.
3. The garden scenery is my favorite rural scenery, and it can be seen that it is maintained with great care. The children left after feeding the fish by the lake, and soon there would be an aunt with a tool to clean up the fish that fell off the ground and railings
Food.
4. In the room, the landscape, layout, and layout are very good. I took a lot of water every day, gave me a fruit plate, biscuits, three cans of tea + tea set, capsule coffee, and Xiaomi's kettle with heat preservation is very useful. But the hair dryer is very old for 1 day, and it needs to be replaced by Dyson. floored bathroom
Warm, barefoot is so comfortable, the bottom of the bathroom stickers is blank, the lid of the trash can is wrapped in cloth, and the shower water is a bit small.
There are children's bed guards, toothbrush sets, and small slippers. There is Bose
A small stereo, and connected to the bathroom side.
5. Kevin Huang, the manager of Mingyue Western Restaurant, is very warm and thoughtful, and even sent us dishes. Ms. Amber Li took good care of the children. She carefully checked whether our food was cold, changed the hot water in time, and gave Lego gifts.
The overall feeling of this vacation is great, thank you for your care, I wish Banyan Tree better and better, and the Year of the Rabbit is happy!

msg:Banyan Tree Yangshuo gives people the impression that it is cheap, low-quality, and the service is extremely unprofessional. Let me tell you what I have seen and heard these days. First of all, the hardware facilities are old, not updated in time, the air conditioner is noisy, some equipment has abnormal noise, the outdoor seats are very dirty, the outdoor swimming pool is like the overall quality of Banyan Tree Yangshuo, it is very small, just dug a hole. Let’s talk about the extremely bad service experience. After making the reservation, I made a phone call before check-in as usual. I also made a reservation for dinner on the day of check-in. However, after I checked in, I went to the restaurant and said I didn't have a reservation. However, I made an arrangement in the end. The extremely unpalatable food is another story, and I don't recommend it. I took a boat from Guilin to Yangshuo. I had booked a transfer service with the hotel before. The hotel staff told me that there would be a fee. I said it was okay. Then the staff told me that they would contact me before I got off the boat, but they would not contact me until I got off the boat. They didn't contact me for 20 minutes under the scorching sun. During this period, the phone line was always busy. In the end, we had no choice but to take a taxi to the hotel. However, it was very difficult to get a taxi from the pier. There were five of us and it took another half an hour to get there. The hotel's shuttle bus can't see Banyan Tree's service and distraction. When you talk about the restaurant, he will take you to the lobby, which is normal. This gap of tens of meters is normal in an express hotel, but it is a drop in price in a Banyan Tree. In the middle, I also heard that some customers reported that they used the toiletry bag used by others. The next day after arriving, we took the hotel shuttle bus to West Street. There was no communication during the whole process. After arriving at the location, the guests on the bus asked us how to get to West Street. The driver casually pointed us in the opposite direction. A group of people basked in the sun again. ten minutes. If you choose Banyan Tree because of Banyan Tree’s attentive service, then you can’t even see the Yangshuo Banyan Tree. You should think twice about staying here.

msg:The Banyan Tree that I have been thinking about is finally launched in the Spring Festival of 2023. During the Spring Festival, the price is really not beautiful. Departing from Guangzhou, check-in was already 2 hours later than the original time at 8 o'clock in the evening. Therefore, the upgraded Bieye also arranged a spa for the family after dining in the hotel. The child was already jumping happily as soon as he entered the room, and he also informed the housekeeper in advance to arrange a children's bed and a children's bath room. The room is very warm, and the breakfast is average. In the morning, the children went to see the animals. I arranged to go to the bamboo raft by myself, and it was 3 minutes late. People swim in the painting.
Banyan Tree's service arrangement is still very good, but the catering is average for Guangzhou people, especially the sunset ceremony. . Kind of simple.

In addition, this is the first restaurant I have come across that has to be numbered for breakfast😓. The fact that so many people stayed here in January shows that everyone really likes it here. In addition, the photographer we met was not very professional, and the result was not as good as what we had previously met, which is a bit regrettable.

The special person sent it back to the room, and the small living room already had fruit ready. The most unexpected thing, I prepared aromatherapy and essential oils, I really like it! The turndown service not only prepared pajamas, but also sent a small handmade turtle, cute ☺️

The resort occupies a relatively large area and is about a 30-minute drive from Yangshuo County. It is recommended for tourists who have finished visiting the scenic spots and just want to rest for a while. And I think the hotel also has enough activities to fill 2 days, the attached Lijiang bamboo raft, you can visit Alpaca and Xiaoxiang pig in the morning and afternoon, there is a sunset ceremony at 5:30 in the afternoon (as well as snacks and drinks), chance encounters A peacock, a morning run...

The breakfast is rich in choices, and there are freshly squeezed juices. I accidentally found that there are sliced duck, champagne, and egg waffles! And I would like to praise the butler service and the service of Baiyun Restaurant. Originally, I just asked the butler to help make dinner reservations. When I arrived at the restaurant, I learned that the butler had specially helped to reserve a view seat by the window. Then, when I was about to go to the seat, the waiter asked additional questions. After a while, because there are several active children at the table next to us, they asked us if we would like a relatively quiet place. This point of careful observation really deserves a big thumbs up! !

Summary: Will come again! The whole stay experience really made us relax😌

During the meal, I happened to meet the peacocks outside the restaurant door competing to open their tails, which was very amazing. The price of the hotel is the most expensive in Yangshuo, so there are not many guests. After upgrading to a detached villa, the cost-effectiveness instantly became very high. The hotel has its own pier, and it also gave a 1-hour bamboo raft on the Li River, but I didn't take it because I was tired from the journey. The hotel garden is not big, the green area is small, there are few places to go shopping, there is no indoor swimming pool, only a small outdoor pool. In winter, the water temperature in the outdoor pool is 31 degrees. I guess it's a bit cold

Ten minutes later, the waiter knocked on the door and said to show us the room. She had no choice but to get up and decline through the door. The purpose of staying in a hotel is to rest. Can Banyan Tree Yangshuo even provide basic services such as cleanliness and undisturbed service? When I woke up, I didn't say anything about checking out early and leaving. I politely declined the room upgrade service proposed by the manager on duty and the front office manager. The above is the experience of this stay.

The only difference is that the transportation is a little inconvenient. If you drive here at night, you are a little scared. Anyway, it is very good overall. I agree very much. I will bring my children here and come again when I have the chance.

Service: Everything you need will be delivered to the room immediately. The efficiency is very high. Every staff member you meet on the road will greet you with a smile, which is very warm.

Facilities: In the room, except for the toilet, which is not smart, everything else is very good. The public area is worthy of being a parent-child hotel. If you bring children, you can really have fun and get close to small animals

All in all, staying at Banyan Tree Yangshuo is a good experience. If there is a chance, I will bring my family together~

msg:Yangshuo is guaranteed to be the only brand hotel here. In fact, the size of Banyan Tree’s area actually belongs to the resort. Because of the off-peak travel, I bought a package and upgraded the room to Lijiang Riverside Room 108². There is an independent front and rear courtyard by the river, including Lijiang rafting. , a set of travel photography, sunset activities, bus to and from West Street, etc. I chose to soak in the hotel one day and see what I arranged:
Plus spa, rafting, travel photography and night time🏊, a full day, hahahaha

Serve:
Well-trained, professional training is not a loss, Banyan Tree, especially Nora, the girl wearing glasses at the front desk, has to make an appoin**ent for everything. Due to the scheduling and the special time slot, the appoin**ent has been changed several times, and there are many people traveling. The provided ethnic costumes have also been sent and changed a few times, and she takes the trouble every time [strong] However, the young interns really still need to be improved. They are dumb and prone to mistakes. It's all old people helping to fill holes. It is recommended not to put them in key positions.

Don't miss the rafting, the hotel's private pier, and the staff in charge of rafting will also chat with you. All the locals will introduce you to the local style. The scenery of the rafting route is first-class. It used to be the scene of Liu Sanjie. This is great👍

1 hour within the scope of the hotel for the travel shooting project, including 5 general repairs, the price is reasonable and reasonable, and it is cheaper than the scenic spots in downtown Guilin.

Finally, the swimming pool is too small, so don't think about exercising! Compared with Tang She, I advise you to choose this place. Banyan Tree is fine except that it is a little more expensive.

msg:Both accommodation and leisure services are close to perfect! If I want to come back to Yangshuo, it will still be my best choice~
Banyan Tree is a certain distance from the center of Yangshuo County. It takes about half an hour by car. When I first entered this mountain road, the surrounding is very original and I was a little worried. The style is antique and should belong to the Hui style.
The environment is a small villa, and there are also suites. This time we stayed in a suite. The space design and layout are also very comfortable. There is a small balcony outside the suite. The scenery is very good and you can see the mountains, so this room is also called the mountains. impression. There are also battery cars to pick up and drop off, which is very convenient. Just make a phone call or WeChat contact, and the car will come immediately.
The buffet breakfast has a complete variety, and the food is okay. There are both Western and Chinese styles. There are many choices. It is that the baguettes and other wheat bags are not tough enough, and they don't feel good inside, which is a pity. The service tray is in place~
Then there is also the bamboo raft project, because we are going to Yulong River the next day, so we replaced it with afternoon tea. The appearance of afternoon tea is good, it is a small suitcase, and the taste of dessert is average to me.
There is also the travel photography service of ethnic clothing hotels. Haha, there are a few clothing choices, only for the Zhuang people. The better the travel time, the more 5 pictures can be given, and the rest will be paid extra. I chose 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the sun was still a little big, so I suggest that the ladies can choose around 5 o'clock, or 9 or 10 in the morning, because the morning sun in the lobby can just reflect on the face, and in the afternoon it will be Backlight, also see their options. The picture below was taken by my family's mobile phone, not by the photographer.
The first time I stayed at Banyan Tree in Phuket was many years ago. There was no epidemic at that time. This time it was in Yangshuo. Although the prices were relatively beautiful, the overall environment and service were still in place. The house continues to move bricks, looking forward to the next Banyan Tree experience, haha

msg:The overall experience of the hotel is good. I did some homework before coming, and finally chose the former between Banyan Tree and Tangshe. Of course, the result proved that the choice was the right one. After staying for two days, I felt that the whole person was completely relaxed. Let’s talk about the shortcomings first. Although the breakfast is rich, it is difficult to eat some bread. I tried fried dumplings and fried buns, and I just ate them on the principle of not wasting. Pretty big. The second is the glass of the villa, I hope to clean it up in time, there are too many bugs sticking to the body outside.
So let’s talk about the advantages. The location of the hotel is hidden in the depths of the Welfare Village, so it is secluded and undisturbed. The exclusive Li River waterway can be used for sightseeing by boat. The most important thing is that the attitude of the hotel staff is very good, especially the manager Alisa will track the guests’ check-in. The situation really gives a home away from home experience. Needless to say about the hardware of the hotel, the bedding is very comfortable, it is rare to have two good nights sleep during the trip, and you will also receive various small gifts and snacks during your stay (the guy who delivered the fruit is very handsome and sunny), although Not sure when I can come to Yangshuo again in the future, but once I come to Banyan Tree it is the only option.

msg:The swimming pool is small but the view is good. The room hardware facilities are no problem. The beds, pillows, and bathtubs are first-class. I originally stayed at the Lijiang villa for 2 nights. The restaurant is noisy and the service needs to be strengthened because of the lack of communication between the staff. We also gave feedback to the hotel and hope that the service will not disturb this piece of freehand in the future. Looking forward to better next stay

msg:This summer trip to Yangshuo with my baby, I compared the popular hotels in Yangshuo on the Internet, and finally chose the old brand Banyan Tree. Stayed here for five nights, the hotel itself is a resort in a painting, and you can lie down happily for a few days without going out. The baby enjoys feeding fish, peacocks and alpacas every day. The hotel room is also very clean. There are many choices for the buffet in the morning. The only thing I want to make is that the level of serving in the western restaurant needs to be improved. There are very few choices of dishes in the western restaurant. I hope it will be improved next time. Looking forward to the next trip, come to Banyan Tree Yangshuo again to lie down.

msg:Finally got a taste of Banyan Tree! I have always heard that Banyan Tree is known for its meticulous and appropriate service. This time, it is also well-deserved. For example, before arriving at the store, you should contact us to find out if you need rafting, whether you have children with you, etc. The children's bathrobes, slippers, and toiletries are prepared in advance. Yes, toothpaste and toothbrushes are also all quality online.
        As soon as I checked in, the housekeeper added WeChat and all questions were answered and resolved as soon as possible! For example, we asked for a bathtub cover as soon as we checked in, and it was delivered to the room within 10 minutes, and an extra one was given. The hair rope, water, and fruit were also delivered in time, and even the noisy upstairs room helped us solve the problem. Although there are not many rooms in Banyan Tree Yangshuo, the advantage is that it can serve every guest well.
        The fly in the oin**ent is that there are very limited entertainment programs for children, and there are few free programs. There are only two time periods for feeding alpacas and fragrant pigs at noon and in the afternoon. Don't do it when it's hot at noon, don't get sunburned, and don't have a place to shade. The waiting parents will be tanned. . . It is recommended to add awnings and seats and the like. Children can only make an appoin**ent for fishing once a day, and the rest of the free items seem to be only feeding peacocks and feeding fish... Others are basically charged. During the stay, I can only take the children to swim repeatedly. Of course, the infinity pool facing the Lijiang River is very good👍
        The waiters are more polite and warm, and the shuttle bus will pick you up when you travel. However, during peak hours, you may have to wait for the first-class shuttle bus and cafeteria... Note that the Li River rafting is very good, that is, a family of three will only give two rafting, and one person will spend more than 200 to buy their own tickets.

msg:After several twists and turns, I finally settled in. I booked a room last year, but it was forced to cancel due to the outbreak. This year, 618 quickly bought two sets of 4-night villas, because I only made an appoin**ent one week in advance and was told that there was no room for the summer vacation. I can only get a refund, and I feel very resentful. My family thinks that it may be because I missed the Banyan Tree and asked me to book other hotels with the same price, but I said that I want to stay in Banyan Trees all over the country, so it was more than 7,000. I spent more than 12,000 yuan in the end, but I persisted, and I was not disappointed at all. The service is very good, it is the most popular hotel I have ever stayed in. During the four days I stayed here, the aunt who cleaned me every day knew that I would do laundry every day and gave it to the parents who were drying the clothes very considerately. It is a hotel worthy of staying at the hotel with its own pier where you can sit on a bamboo raft.

Service: The service training at this Banyan Tree is really disappointing and disappointing. When checking in, the front desk, knowing that there are other guests waiting, chatted with the previous guests and repeatedly introduced the hotel's gift items. Are you sure? Are you sure you want this time?"
Having stayed in so many luxury resort hotels at home and abroad, this event reservation can allow the housekeeper to introduce and make an appoin**ent with the guests when they check in, instead of occupying the check-in time. Very unprofessional.
Called the guest service center to ask for disposable paper cups, and they replied that they didn't know if they had any, and asked me to ask the coffee depar**ent. This can be done intimately, and everything needs to be done by the guests.
When asked to pick up a battery car, the answer will take 10 minutes, and so on...
If you have no requirements for service, Banyan Tree Yangshuo is really a good choice...

I took off my shoes and walked, and the soles of my feet turned black. The carpet was old and dirty, and I felt that it had not been cleaned. The suite I booked was given a bamboo ticket of Lijiang River for two people, plus a child of 235 yuan, less than an hour, the scenery is very ordinary. The swimming pool is open air, very small and closes at 7pm. For breakfast, you have to queue up to eat in. There are many tourists and the restaurant is very small. The positive aspect is that the hotel environment is very good, children can feed the fish, and the staff are also very friendly.

This is the first time I encountered such unprofessional service! The hotel WeChat assistant is also deliberately embarrassed about ordering take-out and picking up. If you don’t want customers to order take-out, rationalize the price of the restaurant. Hotel consumption can be at a premium, but like you, because the hotel is located in a remote location, there is no business within 10 kilometers. Is it too much to put a premium on the price by 7-10 times and kill customers to death for convenience? A cup of watermelon juice is 70 yuan, fried Xiaohe is ¥300, and the market price in Yangshuo is only 38. The room environment is really good, the cleaning aunt is very responsible, but will not stay again!

Disadvantages, the equipped toiletries are too poor, especially the toothbrush, even the quality of the Express Hotel is not as good as that of the Express Hotel, it is difficult to understand!
The details still need to be improved. For example, some items in the room have been placed for a long time but have not been updated. The cans in the refrigerator are bumped and dented. This should never be done. Some corners of the room are not sanitary.

Checked in on Saturday and left on Sunday. I hesitated for a long time between this and Tangshe. Since I came here with my mother, I still think this place may be more suitable for the elderly.

🔔Service: The standard check-out time is 12 o'clock. I asked for help to delay the check-out and was told that it could only be until 12:30. Excuse me? Ordinary chain economy hotels are better than your treatment. Please open your eyes and see that I booked you at twice the price of the tour group! Generally, you can check out at 2 o'clock or even 3 or 4 o'clock. The bamboo raft was scheduled for 1:30. Where should I go if I check out at 12:30? Sit in the lobby, it's still raining outside! ! ! ! ! They also said that because the room is full, it can't be later. With so many vacancies and this price, you can obviously upgrade the room type, but you didn't. At 12:36, seeing that I haven't checked out yet, they called again to urge me! ***!
Since I didn't stay at the Tangshe, I took some time to go there to watch the fireworks. The staff from the restaurant to the doorman were all very nice. They even gave me the key to the boutique where they were resting, even though they knew I wasn't a guest. I was impressed! I strongly recommend young people to stay at the Tangshe, the atmosphere is much better (Figure 23 is the Tangshe

msg:First of all, let’s evaluate this trip objectively. Yangshuo’s landscape is really shocking, and it is a scenery that cannot be seen elsewhere. However, the prices here are too expensive, and the solicitation of customers is too serious. The society is afraid to come here carefully. Let's evaluate this hotel again. If you are willing to pay this price to stay in a hotel, his family is really not a good choice. The reasons are as follows. 1. The button of the toilet in the check-in room does not work, and the toilet tank keeps making a splashing sound. 2. The hair dryer has no hot air at all! ! 3. It is understandable that the big bed is made of two mattresses, but it is really incomprehensible that there is a groove in the middle! 4. Knock on the door for cleaning at 10 am to clean up! ! 5. The breakfast may not even be as good as a three-star hotel, so let's experience it for ourselves. 6. The general environment is really not good. It should be in a village, far away from every scenic spot. It is best to rent a car. 7. Reservation of opinions, reservation for 4 days, stay for two days, check out if something happens, the room rate for the remaining two days will not be refunded, Fangzheng I have stayed in a five-star hotel, this is the first time I have encountered such an overlord clause, it is understandable during the peak season , the holidays are over, and it's still like this, the food looks a bit ugly. In general, I am really disappointed with the brand of this hotel. If you want to stay, you should be cautious. After all, there are still many environments and conditions to choose from at this price!

msg:Banyan Tree mainly focuses on famous scenic spots and has a large number of tourists, and some tourists just need to stay at international brands. Therefore, the hotel has been used to many problems, such as talking about money in everything, and basically no longer knows what hospitality is. I really feel sorry for the status of an international brand (but maybe the management just wants to make money and doesn't care about long-term brand building). (Note: The hotel is a bit far away from the main Yangshuo scenic spots, so it is not recommended for tourists unless they stay here for one or two nights and then transfer to other hotels near the scenic spots.)

The design materials of the room are also good, and the view is first-class.
The restaurant's products are also quite good. We basically dine in the restaurant, and we are very satisfied with the environment and dishes! The daily free sunset ceremony is equivalent to happy hour, and you can enjoy the evening at the sunset bar.
What's particularly amazing is that Banyan Tree's service is very good, very attentive, you will find that they really want to solve your problems for you, and really hope you can have a pleasant stay! In addition to the quality of the brand, and because the team is very stable, quite a number of employees have been working since the opening about eight years ago, so they can be very professional!
Banyan Tree won't let you down!

1. Environment: The river view where Banyan Tree is located is very general, and there is a lot of garbage on both sides of the strait. At the same time, the swimming pool is very small, and now there are so many children in the swimming pool that it is impossible to swim at all.
2. Dining: There are a lot of people for breakfast, so you need to wait in line.
3. In the room: The overall decoration is good, but all items are hung with tags, and some supplies are required not to be taken away: such as wash bags, slippers bags, laundry bags, etc. For a hotel like Banyan Tree, it's so stingy, it's a bad experience.
4. Room service: The service phone has been unable to get through. Delivery is slow.
Summary: The price is very low, will not stay again.

Staying at Banyan Tree made our trip perfect.

They have free airport pick up service. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted professionally with local hot tea prepared in the car.

Throughout our stay, we arranged a five-day itinerary through Jack from Tourism Services. Driven by a warm and technically safe driver, Shi Bo is called Qi. Both of them are great. Professional, knowledgeable and inclusive.

Housekeeping is great. They noticed that we drank a lot of water, they just left more for us. Every night, they left little keepsakes on our beds. Needless to say, the room was super clean.

The breakfast was also impressive. So many choices and they are all delicious.

To be honest, dinner is expensive and normal, but the taste is the taste of ordinary small restaurants, and it is not worth the price anyway. The surrounding is too remote, it is the village, there is nothing, and it is inconvenient to go out to the pool to eat. The room was clean, there was a dead gecko behind the balcony sofa, and there were cobwebs in the handrail. . . At night, the air conditioner was automatically turned on and off, and the sound was loud, which led to a lack of rest all night. The manager on duty sent a small gift to express his apology.

The overall experience during the meal is also very general, sorry for the 10% service charge + 6% additional tax. The replacement of the bone disc was also called a few times before changing, and the overall result was inefficiency caused by insufficient staffing. In terms of facilities, there is no indoor swimming pool, so the outdoor swimming pool is very tasteless in winter. You can only stroll around the garden to amuse the animals. It is basically impossible to spend a day in the hotel. You have to go outside to experience it, but you must charter a car in other places. , The distance is not close.
On the day of check-out, of the three of us, only we were urged to check out at 12 o'clock. There were no other two families, which caused us to leave the room early and waited for the bus to the high-speed rail station in the hotel lobby. Compared to other Banyan Tree places, Yangshuo is not considered the worst experience, at least the breakfast is delicious. For resort hotels, I shouldn't come back to this experience of loosely requesting customers not to loosen up. Old hotels will not change and it is really hard to make progress. But the staff's attitude is still good, but the efficiency is low.

There are also their own small zoo. The children go several times a day to see the animal room. The hotel has upgraded the room type of Xinjingxuan villa. Although the lights in the room are a little darker and the facilities are a bit old, the USB sockets for charging are a little less, but overall it does not live up to the brand concept of Banyan Tree. Small gifts are given to check-in and check-out. The child is very considerate. Also, I would like to add that I usually stay in the hotel to relax and empty. I don’t leave the hotel. The surrounding area has already met my needs. I don’t know if the hotels that complain about the remoteness of the hotel are not high-luxury hotels that have not stayed in the hotel Yangshuo Which one of them was originally just to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I think it's good to make you calm your mind!

Every staff member was polite, and they called before checking in to find out the situation of the residents in advance, and they gave small gifts to the shop when they left the shop. The hotel is very suitable for parents and children, you can feed alpaca pigs, fish and ducks and other animals. If you have to pick the fault, the included afternoon tea variety is slightly monotonous. You can always trust Banyan Tree.

msg:I often go to Banyan Tree, this Banyan Tree is the worst experience! The waiters are more rigid than the other. The food in the hotel is even worse. ***Clothes. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper, there is no good meal. Stayed for four days and left the store for a bottle of Heineken to buy 49. I suggest you go rob the bank. Generally, hotels of this level will not charge money for eating and drinking in the minibar. Leaving the store on the front foot and calling for money on the back foot.

🔔Service: poor poor.

But when approaching the resort, the majestic and magnificent buildings in the Northern Guangxi and Republic of China style with the traditional Huizhou brand seemed to shine. This luxurious resort hotel was hidden in the countryside and was deeply shocked after seeing it.

I booked a villa, the room was a bit small, and the hall was very comfortable. The service is really good, I especially like the aroma candle class at Banyan Tree Gallery, and the waiters are also very enthusiastic. The SPA is as good as usual. The seats in the Chinese restaurant are too rushed, and the tables cannot be set up. Staying there, except for Xiaogui, there is nothing wrong with it.

Service: The service staff are polite and everyone will greet you; but the management really didn't feel the standard of Banyan Tree. After check-in, I was disturbed by the waiter twice, and once I came in without knocking on the door. No one is speechless. Buffet breakfast: 85 minutes, no surprises, no obvious problems. Transportation: It is a half-hour drive from the high-speed railway station; it takes about 85 minutes to take a taxi to the airport, and the fare is about 300; there is a bus to West Street, the latest one at 7 o'clock, and the drive is half an hour. Facilities: The swimming pool is too small, and it feels crowded for a dozen people to swim there. What is speechless is that I asked for a review when checking out, I called for a good review at night, and I wanted a good review on WeChat the next day. To be honest, I wanted to rate it, but it was really annoying and annoying to be chased. I directly gave my impression of Banyan Tree. Folding in half is completely off-standard, and no matter how polite it is, it makes people feel very uncomfortable.

From the moment I got off the bus at the hotel, the staff was warm and courteous. Although we booked an ordinary room, we opened the curtains and the scenery was beautiful, with mountains, waters and pavilions. The hotel comes with a variety of activities, so that we will not be bored in the hotel for 2 days. Among them, the bamboo rafting scenery is better than that of the Yulong River. The hotel’s archery and fish feeding activities are my favorite.

Finally, give suggestions to friends who are entangled in Banyan Tree/Sugar House/Huashanyunhai
-If you want a clean rest or a family vacation, Banyan Tree is the first choice
-The sugar house is cold and industrial. I passed by and saw it is quite suitable for taking pictures. It is not very warm when I live.
-Painted Mountain Cloud House, you can’t see it outside. You can go to see the sunrise and take pictures.

In the southern autumn where people can get heatstroke, too many outdoor activities will become very unsuitable, try to choose indoors , After all, you need air conditioning to save your life🤪
The rooms are large in size and have a small courtyard, which is very suitable for watching the moon on the night of Mid-Autumn Festival. The breakfast is rich in variety, and individual dishes are changed every day. Guilin rice noodles are a must-eat for every meal😋
A very favorite hotel, I will come again if I have a chance.

From the supervisor to the waiter, everyone has a very amiable attitude. , As long as there is a problem, it will be resolved quickly, and the entire hotel management is done very well. The house is very large and comfortable. There is a faint smell of essential oils in it. The sanitary products are also very high-end fragrance. Different gifts and refreshments are given every afternoon. The hygiene is also very clean and the details are well done. The breakfast in the restaurant is not only rich, but the taste is delicious. The drinks are freshly squeezed, not just bought outside. Coffee, tea, wine and ice cream are all very good. There are enough staff in the restaurant. Any situation can be solved quickly. There are so many people and the customers don’t have a good sense of experience. The most important thing is that the sanitary details are well done, and it is stipulated that masks must be used to eat. This is a plus point. Many hotels don’t care about this kind of thing. The choice of dinner is still Many, the key tastes good, not as bad as the netizens said before, there are many choices. I booked their spa and it was really comfortable. The indoor environment of the spa was advanced and clean. The bath products were also made in detail. Finally, the outdoor environment is also very comfortable, there are many activities, and I don’t want to go out at all after staying for a few days. This hotel is really suitable for bringing children. Even the photographers sent by the hotel also took pictures very beautifully. This is the hotel where I live in so many hotels in China and want to come again! Because he not only pays attention to housing, but also makes all the internal details very good, allowing me to experience a real 5-star hotel.

If you need to follow the tourist route to play for two days. The average per capita is no less than 1000~1500. There are other weird projects. For example, if you do a yoga class, it costs 500 per person. The hotel also presented a travel project as a gift. It is to give you a special outfit that you can use for one day. There will be photographers who will take pictures of you. But he only sent five photos, and the rest of the photos, if you want, only a 20 negative. But the national costumes provided are really ugly. This is not as good as Hangzhou.

[Hot search] Because I like Banyan Tree so much, I will stay here, no matter what the service is. Regardless of the location? I will not miss it. It is worth mentioning that the hotel has a sunset ceremony. It's pretty cool, you can have some snacks and drinks for free. I participated twice in a row and no one said anything.

The children’s corner is a bit small and simple. But the environment is very good, you can feed the fish unlimited times. A free tour of the Lijiang River is also good. Although it is not a classic part of the Lijiang River, it is a good place to relax and unwind for people living in the city. It’s best to go after five o’clock in the summer. We’re on the 4:10 schedule. It’s too hot. It's a pity that the child fell asleep within 10 minutes after the 4-person electric bamboo raft was driven. Due to work, I didn't take the child to the entire hotel, which is a pity.
Western food is very general, Chinese food is very recommended, bamboo tube rice children like it~ You can also make an appoin**ent to make scented candles, and children find it very fresh. The baby elephant child in the Banyan Tree Pavilion took a look, but picked it up and didn't put it down.
Although the hotel is a bit far from the attractions, it does not hinder travel. The scenery of the hotel itself is very beautiful, you can take pictures of beautiful scenery and blockbusters at will.

Banyan Tree itself is already a scene in Yangshuo. These few days at the hotel have left a deep impression on me and my family. Even someone who is so picky about my wife can't find anything to be picky! Special commendation to Master Qin of the hotel’s bamboo raft, he can see the hotel’s staff training and his pride as a hotel member.

The scenery is picturesque and the service staff are very attentive. There is also a bamboo raft tour of the Li River, which is more comfortable than the outside. There is a shuttle bus to West Street, the accommodation is very quiet, the breakfast is rich, there are ducks, carps, peacocks and other animals. It is very happy to see other children. It is estimated that parent-child travel is also very suitable

The activities of the hotel are also rich. You can also stay in the hotel for a few days at night and stay in the mountains on the first day. The suite room facilities are good. You can see the Huizhou architecture outside. There are too many bugs at the door. The next day, the villa on the Lijiang River has a private courtyard where you can see the Lijiang River. A person will come to the room to help you barbecue at night. It’s not bad. The next day there will also be someone responsible for delivery. From breakfast to the room, the overall experience is good and the service is in place. The only drawback is that the hotel’s Chinese restaurant tastes average

Banyan Tree feels nothing better than the big room. Other views are cost-effective and convenient. The general location is rather biased. It’s not a self-driving tour. It’s not friendly. It’s not convenient to eat and travel around. There is nothing to watch in the village. The current domestic development is very good. It’s a little bit of contrast.

There are many activities (reservation is recommended one day in advance), including rock climbing, bamboo raft tour of the Li River, golf practice, and sunset ceremony. , Children catching fish, etc. The hotel does not raise cute alpacas, peacocks, and ducklings, and has opened up a small nursery and vegetable planting area. The breakfast is very rich, with new changes every day, and the service of the hotel's big brands is basically nothing to say. The hotel is a bit remote. It is about 20 minutes' drive from Yangshuo West Street. You can only wait for the hotel's shuttle bus or arrange a Didi taxi in advance.

The service is quite considerate, with its own wharf, it is more convenient to take a bamboo raft. The spa techniques are in place and the environment is very good, but the charges are expensive, even though it has been discounted. Banyan Tree is a bit like Porsche, the reserve price is not too high, but you need to pay for almost everything you need for personalized items, which is not too satisfying.

msg:Compared with the general five-star resort hotel Banyan Tree is worthy of its brand, but I personally think that the brand of "Banyan Tree" itself is not doing well in many aspects. For example, when I checked in at 15:00 (the hotel check-in time is 15:00), I was told that the sanitation needs to be cleaned for more than an hour (of course, I applied for a two-hour check-out delay due to the next trip when I checked out, and the hotel was postponed because it was full. 1 hour later, because I told me to wait too long when I checked in, I was postponed to 13:30). I didn't prepare children's toiletries and slippers and bathrobes in advance, so I called to come by myself. The luggage could not be delivered to the room in advance. Only a few of the hotel staff I met would take the initiative to smile and say hello.

The room was full at the end of June. I came with a friend’s family. I only got one of the parent-child rooms. When I checked in, I upgraded the villa with the lowest price difference. The two rooms can be closer, making it more convenient for children to play. There is a simple room layout for birthdays, and a small birthday cake for gifts. We sent two people for bamboo rafting when we checked in, and the children had to make up for the difference. This is pretty good. It has a roof and no drying. The boa**an also knows our needs, so let us take pictures as much as we want. There is no indoor swimming pool. The outdoor swimming pool was closed at 7pm, so I didn't have a lot of fun. There are many kinds of breakfast, which is in line with the configuration of the resort hotel. You can also feed fish and peacocks, but the peacocks have no fixed place and have to find them by themselves. It's pretty good except that the price is expensive

msg:Compared with many local Internet celebrity hotels, Banyan Tree is still a guarantee of quality (although compared to Hangzhou and Phuket where I have lived before, this hotel is a lot less in soft decoration and artistic a**osphere) This time is the first after the epidemic with my boyfriend On the next anniversary, the hotel also made a special arrangement for us, giving us red wine as a gift, and the Swedish meteorite necklace as a gift from my boyfriend was also super romantic. Said to pick a star and give it to me. Well, share some details to everyone:
1 The swimming pool is going, but if it is summer, it is best to go after 6 o'clock, although it closes at 7 o'clock, you can continue swimming, but it is not too hot. Once I was swimming in the rain, and the rainbow after the rain felt very nice. 2 Regarding rafting, the hotel will send a rafting at the hotel. If you are on a rush, it is not recommended. Rafting the Yulong River, this service of the hotel may waste your precious time. 3 Regarding hotel dining, the breakfast was very good. On the day of departure, the plane in the afternoon also helped to pack some cakes, which was heartwarming. The hotel's Chinese restaurant tastes better than the outside West Street, although the price is about three times, but considering the convenience and environment, it is quite worth it. 4 Banyan Tree has improved sustainability in many environmental aspects and implemented many details. Although there are discounts on luxury, the concept of environmental protection and sustainable development should be supported. 5 When you go to the Shili Gallery Scenic Area, you must not go to the Jinshuiyan caves introduced by those people. It is completely boring. We were pitted. Written here to board the plane

Had two meals at the hotel during check-in time, one each for Chinese and Western, I personally prefer Chinese food.

The hotel’s infinity outdoor swimming pool can see the Li River, which makes people feel good and the hotel’s services are also very good. Yes, there are two room cleaning services in the morning and afternoon every day. If you want to take the children to the bamboo raft experience, you need to pay a separate fee. The front desk replaced it with afternoon tea. The breakfast was a bit too regular, and I felt a little unworthy of it. Luxury hotels with international links. Generally, hotels of this grade will at least provide some freshly made local snacks and some high-end fruits, which is a bit of a flaw.

There is no view at all from the hotel. I booked a villa worth RMB 6,000 a night and could only see the small trees planted by the hotel. The room was old, shabby, damp, and small. It was so rotten that the bathroom was empty of shower fluid and shampoo. Not to mention, none of the hotel's waiters have received professional training, and all the faces are fake. In short, they always bear the name of Banyan Tree. They are worse than a B&B. They have wasted the good mood of our family's vacation. We will never go back in our lives. .

離開時暈頭把隨身小包遺忘在了客房裡，酒店找到幫我快遞迴北京，感謝相關的工作人員。特別感謝林振宇幫我寄回，過程中嚴謹細緻，發送開袋視頻，相關細節不斷確認，備感安全。很幸運這次選擇了悦榕莊。

衞生：很乾凈，服務人員打掃的也很認真，點贊👍特別是酒店服務人員進入客人房間要脱鞋的細節，真的很戳我💯💯
環境：灕江邊，陽朔有山有水的絕美景色，與悦榕莊的經營理念高度匹配。人文打造的景觀與大自然高度融合，簡直賽過活神仙～
服務：服務就不用提了，服務好是悦榕莊的代名詞。特別是本次服務我們的管家Sophia Liang，特別有耐心，服務細緻周到。
決定以後衹要去陽朔 必住悦榕莊
雙人竹筏遊灕江體驗:太讚了太讚了，酒店一定要保留哦
入住期間享一次水洗衣服兩件（限普通洗衣）:潮濕的氣候環境，這個服務太單到位了，解了顧客的煩惱

餐飲：早餐種類豐富；中餐絕大多數美味，個別菜品不是很喜歡。服務一流。
親子：可以看到孔雀🦚東南風，還能欣賞到鯉魚🐟跳龍門，有羊駝🦙可以餵養，住三天都玩不過來。
特別要感謝一下管家Vicky，幫我們推薦並升級了別墅房，服務主動熱情，下次來還找她～～～

悦榕莊的酒店毋庸置疑服務衞生各方面都是頂尖的。
這個酒店很適合有小朋友的家庭，孔雀，鴨子🦆到處溜達，還可以從前台拿食物餵養，他們不要太喜歡！也讓你覺得很舒服很自然。酒店很大，不想出門住一天也是很舒服了。我們住的庭院也是很大徽派建築讓人很舒服。剛從陽朔換到張家界，顯得悦榕莊吊打級別的存在。但是對比峇里島的豪華酒店我覺得悦榕莊少了一些迎賓的儀式感，就很匆忙就入住了。要是有肯定會讓人更加印象深刻的吧？誰會拒絕熱情的迎賓儀式呢？
兩天的晚餐都是在酒店內吃的，餐廳環境不用説了非常好，一天西餐一天中餐，西餐那邊有孔雀進來散步找吃的，很有意思。口味來説更偏向於國際酒店風味！可能也因為國際遊客較多的原因？對我來説無功無過，沒有很喜歡，但是小孩子比較能夠接受。

包括了 Ailsa 小姐姐喔 🤗 由於要回國的時候，我的手機丟了。找到後是她幫着我們想辦法，安排，詢問，及幫忙將我將手機數據弄好。麻煩她了 🙏

最後的最後！也是辛苦各位工作人員了！包括前台，各位的餐廳服務員及司機哥哥們，都非常的好哦 🤗非常友善 🤗 我們也在酒店裡享受到了貴婦般的照顧。😂

非常推薦這酒店哦！風景優美，有山有水！人員專業又友善！還有許多小活動可以在入住期間參與呢！可以説旅行期間住在這酒店。。。值了！😂

    泡酒店不會無聊，可以借民族服裝旅拍，喂孔雀，逛建築，在江邊散步看日落，不用去景區人擠人，幽靜又舒服。正值春節，晚上還放了春節煙花。非常安利酒店附近2km左右的福利古鎮！非景區，是一個非常原生態的古鎮，家家户户點着炊煙，極具煙火氣！
    我提出早餐水果品種太少，小姐姐還額外送了一份甘蔗，非常感謝哈哈！

msg:先説結論。在春節的尾巴上入住陽朔悦榕莊，整體上還是非常滿意的。特別是要點贊一下管家Terry小帥哥，非常細心負責，從行前到入住再到離店，一直幫助我們協調安排各種事情和需求，體現了悦榕莊管家應有的水準。

我們是從桂林坐遊船轉場到陽朔的，帶着小孩拖着行李，又趕上陰雨綿綿、一路堵車，趕到時已經很疲憊。但一進入到悦榕莊緩緩打開的大門，就好像進入了一片與世隔絕的靜謐之地，瞬間就洗刷了身心的疲憊。前台辦理入住時又為我們提供了熱茶、熱毛巾還有喜慶的小福袋，還詳細介紹了房型升級套餐。經過一番比較，最終以比較合適的價格升級了心靜軒別墅房型，100來平米的居住空間有前後兩個小院，活動空間非常充足。

陽朔的度假酒店競爭很激烈，特色也很鮮明，最終選擇了悦榕莊，沒有讓人失望。國際知名品牌的服務水準不用多説，入住全程、每個細節，即使是面對春節期間的大客流量也沒有拉胯。悦榕莊緊挨着灕江，空間舒朗開闊，佔地面積很大，吃完早餐一家人漫步在酒店徽式建築羣中，清風拂面，欣賞灕江風光，還能帶着小孩餵魚、餵羊駝和小豬，很是愜意。酒店還有一個可欣賞灕江風景的無邊際恆温泳池，非常漂亮，但遺憾的是這次由於時間原因沒有下水體驗。

説完優點，也説説可以提升改善的地方。陽朔悦榕莊開業的年頭已經不短了，基礎設施老化是難免的，建議酒店可以進行局部翻新升級，改善入住體驗。餐飲方面，早餐的品種挺多，但和悦榕莊奢華度假村的定位還不是很匹配，另外就是早餐的甜點水準一般；中餐廳水準尚可，但在餐品供應上，春節期間除了一個900多元的本地特色美食套餐外，零點菜單上基本都是燕翅鮑之類的菜品，對於家庭出遊的住客很不友好。客房內的備品方面，整體還可以，就是拖鞋有點拉胯，不夠舒服。

整體服務規範到位，每一位工作人員都很熱情！ 從前台辦理入住的joss到我們的房間管家小莫小容，還有泛舟的Qin師傅以及泳池管理員和擺渡小哥等等。以後如果朋友來我我一定會推薦。

上海不能放煙花，臨走前一晚突發奇想在陽朔放個煙花吧！ 酒店工作人員還幫忙用接駁車幫助我們運送煙花到了附近一個安全的放煙花地帶哈哈哈！（春節期間酒店裡本身也有煙火表演）

因為酒店都是一兩層樓的房子總房數不大，所以之前擔心的春節期間早餐大排隊完全沒有發生！幾天住下來 有種在個樂園的感覺，想感歎，不愧是悦榕莊啊。

現在迴歸社畜了，懷念每一個陽朔悦榕莊的白天和夜晚。回來後和自己説：存存錢，以後帶着家人去打卡各地的悦榕莊吧哈哈哈哈

非要一個建議的話，酒店的自行車可以排查一下，有一些有點老了，每個月檢查一下的話可能不需要客人自己挑了

雖然來的這幾天趕上全國降温天氣不是很好，但是舒適的居住環境還有酒店內豐富的活動真的很適合不願意出門的人！當然也很適合家庭出行，有很多小動物：羊駝 孔雀 鴨子…. 喂小動物對小朋友來説可能有點幼稚，但是對大學生來説真的剛剛好！！ 
最重要的一點是酒店的自助早餐真的好好吃！！！！各種cheese我超愛 可惜除了第一天後兩天沒有牛肉片 要不肉片加芝士不敢想象會有多快樂。
the last but not the least, 住在這裏建議大家提前租個車 位置有點偏 在鎮上 附近沒有什麼餐廳 晚上如果打車回來還是挺不安全的 外面好長一段路都沒有路燈，或者也可以衹在酒店裡玩～

開車來時，一條大路旁的小路通往零散的村落，誰能想到在這麼村味的一隅有這麼美的酒店。
入住心靜軒別墅，有獨立的入户和客廳庭院，相比之前去的不少中式山水風，悦榕莊的細節和房間維護做的非常優秀。管家Vicky從入住到住後微信幫忙安排酒店所需，服務人員看到客人都是笑臉相迎，因為餐飲需要照顧長者，服務員小妹很貼心的備了熱茶和幫忙叮囑廚房少油少辣。
泡在酒店三步一景五步江山入畫，遠離陽朔的市井和紛亂

活動：非常適合親子，由於時間原因我們衹居住了一晚，但是參與了很多活動：製作蠟燭、小童樂園、餵養孔雀、羊駝、鴨子、小魚，還有娃超級喜歡的釣魚，唯一比較可惜就是釣魚時間太短了🤣🤣。另外還有旅拍和民族服飾提供，總之玩的非常盡興
服務：小管家NORA的服務非常貼心，酒店有嬰兒車等配套，小朋友晚上也可以加沙發床，任何事情都可以及時得到迴應。我們因為拍照耽誤了退房時間，也很友好的推後了退房時間。

另外的感受：國內做酒店運營的，有一個算一個，可以來學學，別夜郎自大的吹噓自己。沒有對比就不知道，國人自己品牌的差距，都2023年了，如此參差不齊。雖然服務人員都是中國人，有體系的以人為本的悦榕莊新加坡品牌 遠遠超過中國任何一家還賣的貴的品牌。十一在廣西，這一路住過來，對國人做酒店管理自吹自擂的印象很差。似乎有一種，我十一就是要宰客，顧客你當定綿羊了！！然而來了悦榕莊，前半程旅遊受過的委屈就好一些了。桂林、陽朔、慶幸有這樣的品牌吧，要不然，整個城市的文明建設都要被拉低了！
呼籲廣西政府部門，好好管管城市的服務管理。悦榕莊真的是給你們加分！！！

另外昨晚在白雲廳吃晚飯的服務生小姐姐也人好，提醒我們菜量有點大，兩個人可以適量點餐，沒有看她的名字，但是我記得她似乎塗著999，可可愛愛的女生

環境：滿眼綠色 眼睛休息到了 建築也很好看 有好多孔雀 還有可愛的鴨子 好適合小朋友來玩 也適合我這種疲憊的大朋友週末來休息偷閑

店內休閑活動: 有送一個來回一小時的電動竹筏，雖然這一段不算得特別漂亮，但是是酒店私人碼頭，不需要去擠，還真不錯的。 另外，昨晚的地球熄燈一小時活動唱得歌很好聽欸

餐食：酒店在福利鎮，距離縣城打車差不多20到30分鐘。酒店周圍可以選擇的吃的很少，但是酒店內的中餐廳也很好吃！芋頭扣肉好下飯，然後蒜蓉炒菜心好好吃啊！甜甜的！給廚師好評
早餐的麪條也好吃的 我拿了一份烏雞湯加在我的麪條裏 更好吃了

msg:此行，要為悦榕莊認真寫一篇評價。
本來我是打算去香樟華萍的，但是我去看了一下環境之後，覺得有些過於幽靜和陰森，覺得要去看看悦榕莊再決定。
但是一進門，悦榕莊就把我留下了，真的好美。靜卻不冷清，池塘邊嬉戲的小鴨子，隨處溜達的孔雀，竹林中黑白相間的別墅，從大堂遠遠望去，有種世外桃源般的感覺。
我的管家Rihanna是個美麗又貼心的小姐姐，給予了我恰到好處的關心和照顧，我的旅拍攝影師小靜，態度認真，技術過硬，包括門僮，服務員都非常熱情周到，讓人好感倍增。
早餐非常好吃，種類豐富，還有免費領取的飼料可以喂孔雀一家，吃完飯騎酒店的自行車逛一圈，好不愜意舒適。酒店有各種各樣的活動可以參加，非常有趣，還有來回去西街的大巴，酒店還有一個自己的那頭可以漂流，唯一的遺憾是沒有嘗試非常有名的下午茶，下次一定會試試。
好多人在網上吐槽在陽朔踩坑被騙，我完全沒有這種感覺，我希望每年都有時間來這邊一次，當然一定是要住在悦榕莊，讓Rihanna給我一個vvvvip的價格。

娛樂項目 預訂套餐以及酒店內部活動項目是很豐富的這個值得推薦。
個人認為性價比不高預訂的價格是基礎房型3k一晚。但是酒店絕大部分的工作人員態度以及專業水平是沒有達到這個標準的。甚至早餐期間觀察到大部分工作人員都是擺臭臉而且路上遇到客人也不會主動問好相較於其他同級別價位的酒店還是差很多。後來也有了解到情況是因為暑期大部分工作人員是實習生。這邊特別需要表揚精品閣的Lucy還是Lindy 10年老員工表現出悦榕莊酒店該有的服務態度以及熱情。西餐廳以及前台表現較差，不靈活，望改進！

msg:作為2014年開業的酒店 設施不算舊 可能這也是價格高的原因 維護跟得上
一家四口去酒店 覺得沙發用作床有點小 到了房間以後就打電話加床 還在電話裏告訴有兩位小朋友需要小童用品 電話裏服務人員細緻的問了每個小朋友的性別和年齡 過了一會兒客房服務員送來了兩個塑料牙杯和牙刷 這是第一天提供的全部小童用品 第二天碰到了客房服務員 告知需要小童洗浴用品 出去回來後發現兩個小朋友衹給了一套 當天下午經過酒店前台告訴服務員還需要小童浴袍 等回到房間給了兩件 其中一件沒有腰繩 這是孩子的部分 
大人的洗漱用品分別放在兩個布兜裏 挺有意思的是 裏面的東西每天每個兜都不一樣 另外652房間的花灑沒有扳手的小棍兒了 所以當你洗完頭髮或者打了浴液 需要到外面洗凈手 才能回來把滑溜溜的圓開關擰開 開始沒想到 是回家以後看到自己家的才反應過來 是壞了 
前面説的小童用品問題退房當天早上就反應給了管家 之後收到電話口頭致歉 並再三強調因為我要退房了 所以她們也不能為我們提供什麼道歉相關的服務了 
辦理退房時候 一位女士為了表示誠摯的歉意給了兩盒餅乾 當時着急走起就隨手拿上了 這個歉意的誠意 我是一點沒感受到 記得曾經有一次在三亞的君悦因為房間晚了一些 給免了兩天的加床費 我花得起加床費 在這裏説 衹是對比一下兩家酒店的誠意
好的地方是電瓶車挺周到 早餐還行 當然風景絕佳 泳池雖小 但風景也不錯 深度小孩玩合適 每天下午的祭落日活動還提供小食 挺友好的
對了定的房間有贈旅拍 我定在了入住當天 以為旅拍的攝影師可以帶我們到酒店轉一轉 結果就衹在大堂內側的屋頂平台拍了一下 我選了照片以後也並沒有精修 直接發我手機了
最後一張圖片是酒店表示誠摯的歉意的餅乾，如果房費是300的話 我可能會覺得酒店這個誠意滿滿

msg:忙忙碌碌的日子裏突然想插播假日節奏，於是臨時起意，直奔悦榕莊而來……一路上翻看酒店的各種點評，歡歡喜喜的我們就到了酒店，前台管家Nora接待了我們，得知我們行程匆匆，馬上幫我們安排入住，並幫我們聯繫漂流，酒店贈送的漂流一般都是要提前一天預訂的，我們這種臨時入住，行程又趕的情況下，確實有點插不上，在有點為難😅的情境下，我們打算放棄這個項目，準備去擁堵的陽朔西街消耗一下熱情洋溢的能量，可愛的Nora小姐姐發訊息告訴我們，幫我們聯繫到加班師傅拉，我們激動的連連調轉車頭，直奔酒店碼頭，…於是，我們看到了美輪美奐的甲天下山水下的日落…

美中不足的是餐廳衹有兩家，由於遠離市區，吃東西不方便，基本進了酒店就是吃喝都在裏面，所以餐廳選擇還是挺重要的

    悦榕莊非常神奇的地方在於沒有蚊蟲，我不知道你們用了什麼神奇的驅蟲方式，讓來自廣東的我們痛痛快快穿了幾天短袖短褲。
    早餐稍有遜色，種類還可以，但是食材品質一般，有待提高。中餐廳很多人説不好，但是我們每餐幾乎都是在中餐廳解決，個人覺得發揮非常穩定，酒店的菜系本是少了江湖菜的煙火，可以理解。
     感謝我的管家lesi每天與我緊密的溝通，分享旅途的喜樂，也解決一些入住小問題，非常完美的入住體驗。

優點：服務很好，員工都非常有禮貌，態度極佳，服務細緻周到，管家Joss也有貼心問候，及時跟進處理髮生的問題和狀況，臨走的時候還送了小禮物表達歉意，符合悦榕莊一貫水準
夜床禮物點心:每晚都有贈送，還有貼心點心，水果，鋪床服務
位置：在一個村落裏，比較隱士僻靜，晚上很安靜，度假村內環境很好

設施：第一天住的雙床房有股黴味，設施也有點問題，還有隔音不太好，一大早被樓上的小朋友吵醒，很影響體驗～反映了以後經理及時處理，給換了房型，這點好評

不足之處也有，暑假客人太滿，有旅行團接待，大堂比較吵鬧，早餐竟然需要排隊，也是第一次見～不過早餐味道還行

總體來説還是不錯，是陽朔行程裏最大的亮點了，對得起價格吧

msg:開車穿過一片池塘 看到白牆瓦片 尖尖的屋頂就知道到了 孔雀庭中信步 不時飛過的幾衹野鳥 背靠叢山 山霧繚繞在建築間 讓它增加了很多神祕

前台Leo很好 給的房間底下就是錦鯉池 隨時餵魚的快樂哈哈哈 管家服務形式 會在固定的時間問候 詢問各種需求 並且快速響應 

在這裏工作的員工一定很幸福吧 每個人都會微笑的跟你打招呼 發自內心的那種笑 樸實無華

房間設施略老舊 裝沐浴備品的容器有點過於… 不好描述的感覺哈哈哈哈 不過不影響房間很棒的風景 露台可以很直觀的看到園景 靜謐 很容易讓人鬆弛下來

無邊泳池真的太棒了 向下望去流水順勢而下與對面灕江和山融為一體 很棒

入門處有放置喂野鴨 孔雀 錦鯉的飼料 怪貼心的

中餐廳裏的啤酒魚有點不新鮮 調料味略重 魚肉口感也一般 其他的菜還好

早餐還蠻不錯了 有我喜歡的廣式早茶 種類不太多 但是足夠了 巧克力噴泉也是我最喜歡的 真的好推薦早餐！！

服務：服務人員包括前台接待，禮賓部，餐廳服務意識強，在這特別感謝Joss，對我們酒店接駁車和店內活動的需求有積極迴應，還有入住的時候耐心温柔的接待
