Eddy, the service staff at the hotel lounge where I had a complementary afternoon tea was attentive and went all out to provide his service. He made me a hot chocolate drink when I told him I could not have tea or coffee. The hotel is just next to a mall with restaurants and food court. But no much of shopping you can do around the area at the moment as they are still under construction. Fortunately, there is no noise from the construction at night.

The breakfast buffet was also really delicious with a ton of variety to choose from. The room was as advertised and spacious - giving our 4.5 year old plenty of space to run around. My only suggestion is to properly advertise the high tea offering - this way guests don’t feel let down. All in all, when going through Hongqiao, Shanghai - we will definitely stay here again. It’s the staff that really make this place. Thank you for a lovely experience

But this particular hotel doesn’t live up to the reputation of Excutive lounge.The excutive lounge nice decorated but no food. Dried pizza, dried pasta, dried mushroom soup. Some fish with no sauce. everything edible seems not right. And even there is not even a meet to eat. My kids who usually don’t like to eat were complaining that there is no food. I wish they can improve the food and cuisines at the excutive lounge.  But above all their service staff are excellent especially the English speaking one, early check in and late checkout. The process was less stressful. I also wish pet can be allowed in the future.

They allowed me to check in at 8:30am, and a late check out at 2:00pm the next day without any fees. Everything was great! A budget price, but still has the same amenities as a super high end hotel. Lots of western choices in their breakfast buffet. The cool thing is that it is literally on East Nanjing Road, a huge shopping street, with The Bund not far off. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

msg:(1) The room smelled very bad, which was the smell of the decoration. I couldn't open the window and refused to change the room. I had to accept the solution of moving an air purifier in (Figure 1). I felt like vomiting the next morning after sleeping all night.
(2) There was no trash can next to the toilet seat. I had to move one in from outside. I don't know why. The next day, when cleaning, I moved it out again. I had to move it back and forth. It was outrageous.
(3) The quality of the buffet dinner was very poor. The dishes were not as many as the breakfast. The afternoon tea set did not have the original cream cake, but only chocolate. When the tray was used up, they filled a plate and sent it to me.
(4) When I bought the package and booked the room, I could book the May Day holiday. But when I actually booked it, I couldn't book it. I called the hotel for consultation and a manager named Cai said that the room was reserved for live broadcasts on other platforms. It was finally resolved by Ctrip customer service.
(5) When the front desk checked the voucher, they said that I booked a king-size bed room. I took the Ctrip order to prove that they believed that I booked a twin bed room. I thought it was really funny.
Summary: The hotel is not of five-star quality. The whole experience is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The service and food quality of a fast hotel like Orange is not as good.

①The room is quite large, the facilities and equipment are quite complete, the room quality is very good, it is large, and the bathroom is also clean.
②The quality of breakfast needs to be improved, which does not meet the hotel's production. It is recommended to improve the quality of the dishes, especially the hot food area. There are few chefs and service staff in the restaurant, so the production is declining. Go to the Chinese restaurant for dinner in the evening: fried rice is ok.
③It is recommended to train the hotel's telephone answering staff and front desk staff, and the service needs to be improved.
The overall experience is ok, mainly the service still needs training and improvement.

msg:I stayed here for a long time for twenty days
I often stay in hotels in Shanghai and across the country for business trips.
But there are 3 things that make me feel particularly good about this hotel.
1. We will try our best to help customers solve any problems they encounter, and their attitude is more sincere. The hotel management shows professionalism from top to bottom;
2. The service awareness is very high. For example, in the evening, a customer said he wanted to drink hot tea, so two cups of hot tea were brought to him manually. Moreover, they all serve with a smile and always greet customers with a smile. It can be said that it is difficult to encounter a hotel with such a high sense of service. It’s very reassuring and heart-warming 🥰
3. Although the aunt who cleans the room was a little negligent before, she folds my clothes carefully every day, helps me arrange my cosmetics neatly, leaves me notes to greet me, and arranges my dolls every day. Put it down, it’s really humane and gentle, praise it.
Keep up the good work, I believe you will get better and better.

The windows in the room are relatively high, so they are probably not used for ventilation. Air conditioning is still used for ventilation, and the ventilation is not that fast.
The front desk service is very good and the processing is fast.
The breakfast was delicious and rich in variety.
The afternoon tea was exquisite and delicious. The waiter Xiao Yin was very attentive and asked several times if she wanted to refill the cup or fruit👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

msg:On New Year's Day, we booked a delivery at United Family in Changning, and booked a nearby Novotel hotel in Kingboard for our children and family. It's very close to the hospital by taxi, 10 minutes away. Staying in the hotel is okay and quite comfortable.

Special thanks to the restaurant manager 👩🏻💼 Lin Xiufang, who is enthusiastic in service, meticulous in work, and observant. She prepared delicious cookies for the children. I heard that someone in my family gave birth at United Family Hospital, so I specially prepared a small cake the next day 🧁 Special Be careful. I hope the hotel will get better and better, and I also hope the hotel will have more outstanding talents like Manager Lin. I had a great experience staying here and I look forward to my next stay.

You are not embarrassed to wear a bathrobe. The water depth is 1.2 to 1.6 meters, which is just what I like. It is too shallow to swim. !
Hygiene: The rooms are new, clean and professional everywhere;
Environment: Shanghai Huiju is being built next to it, which should be a big business district. The hotel thoughtfully provided earplugs, but they were not used at all. I didn’t hear any noise. It was more than 10 minutes’ walk from Metro Line 2, and it didn’t feel far away! There is a foot massage shop at the intersection next to it, and massage is convenient!
Service: The service is really good. All the staff are very warm, polite and professional. Manager Lin in the restaurant has a beautiful smile and great service. During the afternoon tea on the first floor, the service staff was also very attentive. I didn’t remember my name on the first day. The next day was Xiao Yin, both were pretty good!
The breakfast is also rich, mainly Western food, and has everything you need. There is even Oden cooking, a variety of breads, stir-fried vegetables that are not stretchy, and taste good. The hash browns are also quite delicious. It feels richer than the five-star hotels in Sanya. This time You really didn’t choose the wrong hotel for your trip to Shanghai! ! !

Afternoon tea for two/extra breakfast (choose one of two): I had breakfast once, it was good but just like that, it was afternoon tea instead. There should be a guy named Yin in the lobby.

Then he gave me a free upgrade to my room and enthusiastically informed me of the time and location of breakfast. At that time, I brought a lot of luggage. The front desk comrade took the initiative to help me deliver it to the room and told me to call if I needed help with my luggage when checking out. Phone number at the front desk. Because the check-in time was after early morning, I applied for a late check-out the next day. The front desk staff provided a free delay for me. In addition, the room was quite comfortable and the hardware and equipment were quite satisfactory. But the most important thing was the thoughtfulness of this hotel. I really need to praise the service at the front desk. Of course, the front desk staff was still very enthusiastic after check-out and patiently gave me directions to call a taxi.

The answer was reasonable. What was even more speechless was that when I checked out, I asked the front desk where the storage was, and they told me to wait.

I was a little disappointed at first, and I was even more worried that the children would feel disappointed. Conner at the front desk immediately apologized and coordinated thoughtfully. He was sincere and professional, and applied for a room upgrade for us. They also promise to bring children into the store for free at any time after the swimming pool is repaired. The children will smile and be relieved of the gloom. The hotel has a simple and elegant style and is very newly maintained. My wife thought it was newly opened. Sister Zhang Yuping from the room service chatted with her and said that the hotel has actually been open for five years and has indeed been well maintained. Because we brought two babies, the sofa bed in the room needed to be opened. She also specifically asked us to pay attention to the floor and hoped not to run or jump on the sofa bed to avoid scratching the floor and preventing the children from being injured. All in all very patient and kind. The next day, the room service aunt saw the baby playing in the corridor and enthusiastically gave her a set of toys as a souvenir. The surrounding restaurants are also very rich. Lingkong SOHO is nearby, so many shops are here. The afternoon tea on the 11th floor is also very pleasant, with self-service options. Susie helped take care of the baby's preferences throughout the process and responded to every request. When there were not many guests, she played games with the children. It was very worry-free for the mother🤭. I almost never write reviews, but I really recommend it to friends who are on business trips and short vacations to experience it. It is indeed a very cost-effective hotel👍

The front desk replied that it was just that the orientation was different, and the area was almost the same. Then I specifically told the front desk that since I had booked a luxurious king bed, I would help choose a better location. As a result, the room faced the construction site opposite, and the sound was very loud in the morning. After that, I started digging the floor upstairs again, and called the front desk. But there was no reply. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I started knocking on the floor again. The sound was very loud. When I checked out, I asked the front desk. The answer I got was that I received a call and contacted the engineering depar**ent to stop for a while, and then there was no need to reply to me. It was really I'm speechless.

If I need to rest, I will clean a room immediately. Also, I don’t know how to use Ctrip’s diamond member’s free room upgrade. I saw it at the front desk I made the reservation through Ctrip and didn't ask. Maybe I had to wait for me to show it on my own initiative. Hygiene is okay. You have to pull the curtains manually, which is a bit inconsistent with the hotel's brand positioning.

msg:I went to Shanghai for a business trip and stayed at Novotel Kingboard for the first time. I felt very satisfied. The facilities and equipment were exquisite and clean. The most important thing was the good service. Whether it was the cleaning lady Chen Yan or the cleaning lady Lu Jianling, they both had great attitudes. Enthusiastic and responsive, the front desk clerk and the fat guy at the door were patient and meticulous, and gave me a lot of travel advice. In addition, the semi-buffet at noon on the third floor is 68 yuan which is really a good deal. In short, I feel that my experience at Novotel this time is very good and cost-effective. I will come again next time! Also, the drinks in the refrigerator are free, and there’s my favorite soda, hehe

The location of the hotel is relatively remote, and the surrounding area is not too busy, but it is still very convenient to travel. Breakfast was mediocre. The service was so-so (mainly because I left early and came back late, so I didn't have much contact), but the cleaning lady and the doorman were really polite, especially the doorman who was very helpful when he came in and out, and his attitude felt very comfortable.

Although there is construction nearby, you can't hear any noise in the hotel, and the hotel also warmly prepares noise-proof earplugs for guests to use. The hotel's mini bar is free and there is enough drinking water every day. The cleaning lady will ask what time is appropriate to clean the room. Even if she wakes up in the afternoon, the room will be spotless when she comes back. I borrowed nail scissors and packing tape from the front desk. The front desk staff even reminded me that the tape was from a courier company. I hope I won't mind. It's full of details. The hotel readily agrees to requests for late check-out. I will choose Novotel Kingboard Hotel again when I come to Shanghai in the future.

On the one hand, the price of the summer vacation is reasonable, and on the other hand, almost all kinds of needs mentioned can be met. At the beginning, I ordered breakfast for one person. There are not many varieties, but the spicy meat and hot sauce toppings are worth the price. You can go to the Songhong Road Metro Mall to eat before 9:00 pm. It is very lively and recommended~

When checking in, the front desk staff happily upgraded to a deluxe room, which improved the check-in experience! The room is spacious, the bathroom layout is reasonable, and the linen on the bed is also comfortable! Although the swimming pool and gym are not big, they have everything!

        What impresses me the most is the afternoon tea provided in the hotel lobby: it has a variety of varieties, beautiful taste, and high cost performance. The service provided by the restaurant staff is also very good! Especially Yin Pengxiang (CONNOR), the restaurant intern, he made me feel right at home! Xiao Yin's coffee latte art is pleasing to the eye, and each cup of coffee perfectly meets the different requirements of my family and me. His attention to detail and hard work set him apart from the rest of the crew.

        The service of the intern Ye Ling (SANNI) and the front desk staff Cherry also made me feel the hotel's heart and care! Their professionalism and attentiveness made my hotel experience even better. Thanks to CONNOR, SANNI, CHERRY, and all the staff for creating such a pleasant accommodation environment for me, I will definitely choose this place next time!

The service attitude of all the staff here is super good, and our requests are also fulfilled as much as possible. Compared with the four-star hotels in the urban area, this place is really not very good.

There is no delicious food nearby, because when we checked in, there was construction next to it, and the opposite was an office building, which can satisfy your stomach, and there are no particularly delicious restaurants.

The aunts (Lv Jianlin, Tao Jiuxia) who clean the rooms on the floor we live in are really super nice! ! The guest rooms are very clean and tidy, and the necessary things are placed in time, and they help us fold the clothes. This is a service that I did not expect. Since I have not returned to China for a long time, the development of my country's service industry has impressed me this time.

If I come to Shanghai next time, this hotel is my first choice.

A slight improvement is that we stayed on the 11th floor. I don’t know if there are some foreign friends who stay here often or for a long time. There is a "cumin" smell. Just put an automatic air freshener in the corridor!

msg:There are potential safety hazards in the hotel, and the revolving door has no room clip measures. We entered the revolving door together. The child pushed the small suitcase and fell down with the suitcase. The revolving door did not stop, and then rolled the child's feet in. Until this time, the revolving door was still turning. The two adults used the Human power is barely enough to withstand the continuous operation of the revolving door. After the brother continued to slap the glass and shout, the staff came over and pressed the stop switch, and then the revolving door stopped. The crying of the two children did not stop, and we did not hear a clear rescue order. I was very anxious. In order to prevent the child's feet from being crushed and seriously injured, we decided to save ourselves. We still used human power to lift the revolving door. Although there was only a small gap left, the child's feet could move, and the child's feet were dragged out like this. Afterwards, the attitude of the hotel was not bad, and they gave ice cubes for ice compresses. I asked for cotton swabs and I also gave them all. They also promised to reimburse medical expenses and make follow-up engineering improvements, but it has nothing to do with me. The hurt I can't forgive. I hope that the hotel will improve the infrastructure as soon as possible, so that other children will not be hurt again.

msg:As a business traveler, let me comment from an objective perspective:
1. The decoration of the hotel is old and the hygiene is average. It feels like there is a lot of humidity inside.
2. The waiters are in good spirits and very enthusiastic. It can be seen that the hotel has begun to pay attention to service. For example, the room attendants Ms. Lu and Ms. Xu, as well as Emily at the front desk, do a good job and communicate smoothly.
3. Bad review for breakfast: I wanted noodles, but rice noodles were ordered for me, and I also had dishes that were not washed properly. The breakfast dishes were average and more Western-style, maybe because there were more foreign tourists.
4. Bad review of the Chinese restaurant on the second floor. The menu is extremely expensive and there are not many dishes. It feels like a restaurant in a scenic spot. The average price per person is about 260.
5. Objectively evaluate the location. It is surrounded by construction sites and there are no convenience stores or places to eat, which is very inconvenient.
6. At 3 o'clock in the morning, I was woken up by someone knocking on the door. I asked the waiter to check the surveillance camera and said that no one knocked on the door.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the corridors of the hotel are really long. It's tiring to go downstairs to get takeout. I hope to add a robot to deliver the room to make check-in more convenient!

I asked the waiter to send a room card, but it was still not working after a long time. The second room card delivery still didn't come, a good idea It took more than 20 minutes for the waiter who delivered the room card to find the cleaning aunt on the floor after confirming his identity and using the universal card to open the door. On the way, he and the online car-hailing driver kept saying good things and promised to give red envelopes before stepping on the spot. After arriving at the high-speed rail station, I ran all the way and got on the high-speed rail sweating profusely. Then I want to quench my anger with a welcome drink coupon😡

msg:The management of the hotel was chaotic, and they were forced to stay under lockdown. Not to mention all kinds of nonsense. I called the front desk and asked for 6 bottles of water and only gave 2 bottles. I asked for a reminder to unseal the phone. The front desk agreed at the time. Not reminding customers that the seal has been unblocked, causing customers to lose work and study. The most exaggerated thing is that once I took a bath, the water became smaller and smaller, and the water supply was restored in 30 seconds. I almost didn't catch a cold in the winter.

Finally, I would like to remind those who want to choose this hotel to sleep better. After all, it is very close to the construction site, and the construction site will rush to work day and night.

msg:Sure enough, it really deserves the name and makes people feel at home. I would like to thank the front desk staff Jason conner wesson for his warm greeting and specially upgraded the suite. The breakfast is rich, ranging from Chinese food to Western food. The taste is good. Although the afternoon tea variety is a little less, the Western-style cakes are still five-star. In addition to small snacks, there are several cocktails during happy hour. This year's break is really worth it.

Not many people staying, the experience is good, and the check-in is quite fast. However, there were not many customers who issued tickets when they left the store, and it was delayed for a long, long time...
I wanted to take my children to swim and gym, but the gym is really not a star hotel. It was the worst stay experience. The swimming pool is very mini and the gym is not very clean... In the end, I didn't go into the water. The breakfast was quite satisfactory and the service was good.
Overall, it is quite suitable for a business trip for one or two nights, but it is not suitable for parent-child travel.

There are drinks in the refrigerator, and there is an extra afternoon tea for two (although there is no time to go), but the service is very attentive, the staff is attentive and enthusiastic but very measured, which is great.

Tips: The bathroom is slightly dark, not suitable for makeup.

msg:The member's daily membership points were used to redeem the first night's free room right, hehe (yes, it's equivalent to free room), and I pretended to go on vacation with my baby who has been making noises and wanted to stay in a hotel.
The location of the hotel is a bit far, but fortunately the traffic is convenient. The underground garage is very large, and there are many charging piles. Parking is free at the hotel, as long as you register the license plate number when you check in. Usually only one room card is given (there is an electric card in the room).
The hotel is in the shape of a font, with a total of 11 floors, and there are still many rooms. I was upgraded to a deluxe room on the same day (using Ctrip's rights), the view is the opposite Kingboard Plaza, the room is quite large, very spacious, with a simple style design, there is no TV cabinet, so there are not many places to put things, it is more suitable business man. The space between the bed and the sofa is very large, children can move around, and the sofa seems to be able to be opened as a bed (not verified). Drinks in the bar area (in the fridge) are free, which is nice.
The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, which is very good, but unfortunately there is no bathtub (it is said that the bathtub is only available in suites...) The door of the bathroom has a small design, an invisible door, when it is opened, it is the overall cabinet door decoration, and the toiletries are average, But can provide children's toothbrush and disposable slippers, very cute. The overall temperature of the room was raised to 16°C, and the room temperature was still displayed at 25°C, which made the body feel a little hot.
The breakfast is in the western restaurant on the second floor. There are both Chinese and Western styles. It is relatively conventional, and the variety is not particularly large. The wontons and noodles in the noodle stall are not bad, suitable for Chinese stomachs. I didn't want to order takeaway at night and ordered the hotel to deliver the food, but I was super disappointed. It was really bad and not authentic at all. Hainanese chicken is bloody, all with knife pieces (could it be intentional), there are only two kinds of sauces, laksa is even more disappointing, there are many kinds of ingredients, but the rice noodles of the main food are super hard, and the soup base is really not at all. The taste of laksa is completely out of coconut fragrance.
There is a very simple children's playground on the first floor, suitable for young children to play, and there are not many things to play. The hotel has a swimming pool, but I dared to experience it because of the epidemic. It is also convenient to order takeout, just go downstairs and get it at the entrance of the lobby.
What I must say is that the little robot delivers things. My baby is very happy to see it, but it seems that it will only be dispatched when the front desk needs to deliver things.
In general, it's not bad, except for the dinner, after all, staying in a hotel during the epidemic is very valuable.

As a result, I went to afternoon tea after three o’clock on the first day. There was nothing to eat. Also, the hygiene is not very good. I went out for dinner on the first night, and went to have a light meal on the second night. When I waited, I could eat enough. There are a little more than afternoon tea, such as fried rice, fried noodles, fried chicken, and French fries. There are quite a lot of varieties for breakfast, and I am satisfied with the food, but the steamed buns were said to be iced at the beginning, and they were not steamed until the breakfast was finished. The room is hygienic. I went out at 8:00 the next morning and pressed the light that needs to be cleaned. When I came back after 1:00 in the afternoon, I didn't clean it. I just need to empty the garbage in the trash can. I called and told the front desk that it took half an hour to come. people. There are more guests staying on National Day. The sound insulation of the room is not good. The elderly people in the next rooms are noisy and noisy from morning to ten o'clock in the evening. I checked in and registered the license plate on the first day, but I was stopped when I went out the next day, saying that the front desk forgot to register. There is a construction site nearby, but it does not affect the room, and earplugs are also given.

The downside is that the slippers in the room are very poor, the toilet paper is super thin, and the standard of the hotel is 300 yuan. The eldest sister who cleaned the room said that during the epidemic period, she bought too much and didn't run out.
Also, don't order the hotel package in the room, it's very unpalatable. I ordered Hainanese chicken rice, from the chicken to the dipping sauce, including the side dishes that were delivered. It's basically the worst I've eaten this year. The only good thing is that the portion is small and can be eaten.

msg:The overall feeling is general. Because of the sensitive nose, I confirmed with the hotel one day in advance that smoke-free + high-rise + air purifier is required. When I checked in, I did give the high-rise + air purifier, but the room had a peculiar smell, and I reacted with the hotel. I did change the room immediately, but it was not until the sixth room. Room, there is no odor when entering the door. I read a lot of reviews when I checked in, but I chose to stay without mentioning that the room had a peculiar smell. Later, I found that the smell of the hotel corridor was the same as that in the room. It was estimated that it was the decoration material or the air conditioning system.
Dissatisfied:
1. The smell of the room and corridor is heavy.
2. The air conditioner is not working. The air conditioner was turned on at 22:00, and the cold air did not come out until about 2:00, and the air conditioner was cooled. Before, the air conditioner control panel always showed 30 degrees. Because it was too late, I was not happy to toss. I informed the hotel when I checked out the next day, but The front desk of the hotel was indifferent and answered directly: You have successfully checked out, you can leave
3. Air purifier. Change the room, because 🈶️ is in a hurry to leave after dinner, please help the staff to turn on the purifier, but when I returned to the hotel at night, I found out that the purifier showed that the filter element needs to be replaced. Because it was too late, it was also the reaction when checking out.

I wanted to have a bubble bath when I checked in, but I didn't pay much attention to the description of the room type... The manager of the housekeeping depar**ent was so excited that he upgraded me to a suite~Thank you~
I am so happy to stay here~ The facilities are complete and the hardware is very good~ I have stayed in many hotels and this time the price is very high~ So I continued for another night~
The breakfast on the first day was comparable to a war... I thought that this hotel would be a little less than the petty bourgeoisie with a family... I really underestimated the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country... The next day, I decided to go to breakfast at the latest, my lady More~ Miss Lin from the Food and Beverage Depar**ent is very enthusiastic, she helped this and that, and told me that in the future, I can deliver breakfast to the guest room without crowding people~ The French management model is really suitable for the petty bourgeoisie lifestyle~ Merci beaucoup!!! ❤️

The check-in was fast and the staff were very responsible. I specifically mentioned the remarks when I booked the room, and the staff gave me the corresponding room according to my needs. Will take the initiative to ask if you need disposable toiletries. The room is cleaned in time every day. The variety of breakfast is quite diverse, and the staff will clear the table in time to meet the continuous needs of guests in the morning. I observed that guests who asked to enter the door during the epidemic showed double codes. When I checked out, I was in a hurry to go to training. Some staff would ask me for relevant information in time and help me to check out and store my luggage alone. When picking up your luggage, you will also ask some necessary questions to avoid picking up the wrong luggage. Overall is still very good, took a night scene, looking forward to the next stay.

msg:A hotel that ranks low on Ctrip, but the quality and cost-effectiveness have exceeded my expectations. I have heard about the Novotel brand for a long time. This is the first time I stayed here. What a four-star hotel should have is genuine: beautiful lobby (big love). Water curtain wall), professional front desk staff (professional and efficient, enthusiastic and no unnecessary nonsense), comfortable room (office and rest), warm service (like Aunt Meng who helped me clean up the room, Lin from the hotel cafeteria Supervisor), the location of the hotel is not particularly convenient, but fortunately, the takeaway can make up for it. The buffet restaurant food exchange has not a particularly rich variety of breakfast (there is no omelette that I like), but the taste, quality and hygiene are very good (salad is very fresh) , In addition, I would like to thank the waiter Zhu Yuanx for his warm help, so that I can enjoy breakfast while working with peace of mind.

Summary: Four-star price, five-star quality, six-star satisfaction, and Novotel is recommended for wall cracks.

Excuse me, robots in other hotels can deliver meals, and robots in your hotel can also deliver meals to others, why can't they deliver it to me? Reject me without thinking through the brain?
2. The air conditioner of the hotel has been beeping. It is cold when it is turned off, and it is loud when it is turned on. The extremely scary and terrifying sound echoed all night, and you can try it if you are not afraid.
3. Water leaks, the hotel roof is ticking and leaking, and the sweat on the floor and walls is full.
4. There are so many good hotels near Hongqiao Airport with similar prices. I really will never stay here again. Your corporate culture and service attitude will probably close down sooner or later.

Aiming at the five-star staying in full of anticipation.
Advantages: The hall is magnificent and beautiful, and the three-story water curtain is spectacular. The attitude of the concierge is very good. I just wanted to send a gift around 11 o'clock in the morning, so I arranged it for me if I had a room. But I don’t know if it’s a system problem. It only shows that I stayed for one night. Even if I took a screenshot of two nights later, the number of days I did was still one night.
advantage
Rich breakfast, many choices;
There is an indoor swimming pool, which is very convenient.
The small round corner sofa in the room can be extended into a big bed.
With body lotion
Personal opinion: The interior decoration is a lighter wooden style than mahogany, which may be more suitable for family travel. (I prefer fashionable business style)
The working table is long and narrow, and it is crowded with a chair to sit and eat.
People like me who don't go into the laundry room but can't wait to wash a suitcase on the first day on a business trip will not hang up their wet clothes. (Compared to I prefer a pullable clothesline in the bathroom of Atour Grace)
The shower faucet is a bit loose, and I can’t adjust my head all the time.
The toiletries are really thin, and the texture of the small plastic comb makes me wonder if it is five-star.
In addition, because I was not used to the hotel’s shampoo, I prepared a bottle of the remaining half bottle and accidentally stayed in the hotel. When I received a call from the hotel to ask about the accommodation situation, I really hoped to contact me and ask me: "You have a half bottle. The bottle of shampoo is left here, may I ask if you want", not please give us a good comment.
Overall impression: Fortunately, my expectations may be too high, lower than my own expectations.

I am obviously a regular VIP guest here. When I go out, he will ask for it. The parking fee is 75. I am a guest! Poor attitude is to death, and it is arrogant and unreasonable, and it is not afraid of complaints at all. Can this kind of hotel still be rated as a star hotel? too bad

We booked this hotel very close to Hongqiao Station (2 stops)~ I was a little disappointed by the Novotel I lived in before, but this one is far away Exceeded my expectations~
[Location] Super convenient, very close to Hongqiao Airport or the railway station, direct line 2 to Nanjing Road, the Bund is also very convenient, direct line 2 to the hotel is about 800 meters away from the subway station, about 5 minutes walk~
[Hotel facilities] The rooms are quite satisfactory, there are welcome drinks, the gym is very small, the treadmill is not available, but there is a steaming room, which is superb. Due to the typhoon, the swimming pool is closed and it is impossible to check~ There is a coffee hall on the ground floor of the hotel, and ice cream is very good. Cheap, 15 balls + cone~ There is also a children’s entertainment area on the ground floor of the hotel~
[Breakfast] Breakfast makes me feel pretty good, better than a hotel starting with H~

msg:Stay in the worst hotel. The front desk ID card was given to the door, but the staff didn't say a word. The attitude was very indifferent, and he was given a room full of pillars. What I couldn't understand the most was that there was also a pillar slanted above the door, which was particularly unlucky. Going downstairs and requesting to change the room, I changed to a double room that looked normal, but the soundproofing of the room was surprisingly poor. There was always the sound of running water above the head of the bed. I never stopped. I didn't go downstairs to change rooms because I was too tired. I fell asleep with earplugs. I woke up in the morning and never stopped thinking about it. The room service staff rang the doorbell ➕ knocked on the door very early. I did not respond. They continued to knock. In response, they asked them if there was anything wrong with them, saying they needed cleaning?
what? Do you clean the guest room at 8 o'clock in the morning? And I don’t know if the guest is taking a break, do you want to check out the same day? Can't complain

msg:It is a very good business hotel with convenient transportation, and there are not few choices for eating around and convenience stores. In order to take my son and his friends to see the CUMICUP28 doujin exhibition this Dragon Boat Festival, I chose to stay in this hotel. The front desk and floor attendants were very good at check-in. The taxi that helped me book today at 6 o'clock in the morning was also very punctual. The only thing that gives me a very big opinion and no explanation has been given to me is: I have a flight at 7:50 this morning, and breakfast is opened at 6:30. According to yesterday’s communication, there is a packaged breakfast service for guests who leave early. And after knowing our departure time, promised to be delivered to the front desk at 5:50. This was originally a bonus item, but I never thought that when I went downstairs and set off this morning, the front desk brother looked confused. I checked the shift book and found out that there was this reservation. I called the restaurant and no one answered, and hurried to the second floor. Help us to see (even the shoes ran away), but we waited for 10 minutes without any news, we had no choice but to leave in order to catch the plane, this incident suddenly pulled down satisfaction. It doesn't matter if adults eat less, the key is to have two and a half children. Very disappointed, I thought I would receive an explanation from the hotel phone (because I left the phone for them)

msg:중국 방문이 105회 되고,  전국의 주요도시의 호텔에서 머문 경험이 있습니다.   우선 상하이가 디른 도시들보다 물가가 매우 비싸다는 것은 예전부터 익히 알고 있습니다.
결론부터 얘기하자면,  상하이안에서는 가성비가 매우 뛰어난 호텔이라고 볼 수도 있습니다만,  전국을 기준으로 본다면,  흡족하기 어려운 호탤입니다. 
제기 생각하는 호텔의 만족도는 시설이나 인테리어 등의 요소도 중요하지만,  호텔 직원들의 서비스마인드가 가장 중요하다 생각합니다.   
호텔 예약 후 몇가지 요청사항과 질의를 했습니다만,  일체의 회신을 빋을 수 없었다는 것이 좋지 않았습니다.  
투숙객의 요청사항은 호텔사정이나 규정에 따라 모두 들어줄 수 없다는 것은 이해합니다.  다만, 투숙객의 질문에 대한 회신은 반드시 해야 한다고 생각합니다.   그리고,  조식 부페는 요리의 갯수보다는 여러 날 머무는 투숙객을 위해서 매일 조금씩은 변화가 있는 것이 좋다고 생각하며,  매일 변화가 전혀 없었던 조식 부페는 기대를 실망으로 바꾸었습니다.    샤워부스안에서 바닥이 부셔져서 나온 날카로운 돌덩이에 자칫하면 발을 다칠뻔했습니다.  다행히 다치지는 않았고,  대응은 빠르게 해주었으나,  애초에 발생되지 않도록 사전조치해주었으면 좋았겠다고 생각합니다.  악의적인 의도는 없기에 사진을 첨부하지는 않겠습니다.

msg:第一次住這個酒店，總體感覺80分吧。房間還行，但是可能上一個人抽煙了，住進去煙味挺重的。去餐廳吃了個飯，貴的離譜，不太清楚為什麼價位那麼高，一個炒白菜快80了，😄。感覺還是應該更有服務意識，為客人多着想一些。早餐沒有中餐？衹有西餐（可能我沒找到），好奇怪的一個搭配。希望酒店能再多改進吧。

還有客房打掃蔣阿姨，打掃衞生很認真細心，服務態度也很禮貌，對待續住房間，也沒有敷衍了事，還是按新入住的標準流程打掃。

msg:酒店服務爛的令人髮指，想定酒店的朋友避開這家。具體情況如下：
1.酒店專業度低，培訓不到位。我從雙床房換到了大床房，讓前台幫我換同層房間，酒店答應了。到換房的時候給了我另外樓層的房間，我説我要同層的，酒店方讓我回房等待。過了一會前台給我打電話説房間好了，我下樓去辦理的時候另一位前台又説房間沒有好，我在旁邊等待他們溝通，這時候前台已經開始問下一位要辦理什麼了？？
2.酒店態度差，不作為。晚上點了一份外賣，一個小時打了三次電話得到的答覆都是已經送上來了。第四次電話酒店前台居然讓我自己去找外賣，説忙不過來了。既然如此為什麼第一次不説，還要欺騙顧客已經送上來。其次最令人火大的是他們的處理方式，第二天早上前台給的反饋是繼續把外賣送給我，敢問説出這話的人動過腦子沒？酒店方一直問我想怎麼處理，難道住店客人還要教你們怎麼處理客訴？你們內部培訓在做什麼？
3.歧視渠道客人。我自費通過商旅渠道續住了酒店，酒店方拿價格説事。請問不同渠道的客人享受的服務是不一樣的嗎？
最後這事也沒有解決，酒店提出的升房型、下午茶都需要我付出時間精力去獲得，絲毫沒有站在顧客角度考慮。以及外賣錢還是攜程賠付的。
綜上所述，酒店選擇千千萬，最後都是選服務。這家的服務水平令人無語，大家謹慎選擇。

要特別感謝Cherry，她真的幫了我大忙。我第一天入住的時候，房間裏有些設備出了點問題，但是Cherry非常迅速地解決了。她真的很貼心，讓我覺得特別受照顧。

早餐和其他服務也都很棒，游泳設施也很不錯，乾淨清潔，游泳體驗很舒心。Amber和Archer也給了我很好的服務。
