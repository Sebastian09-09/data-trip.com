msg:For the price paid, the hotel is good and clean. All the plugs are with universal plug so I don't even need to use my converter plug which is great! Due to the weather outside, inside can be quite stuffy as in Singapore we are too used to air-conditioning. But opening the window a little bit did help. They have a tub too.. nearby just behind the hotel there a playground and area to play with snow.. the big mall is also nearby..

During our last night the heating in our room was not working and they changed another room for us immediately. So well done for looking after your guests.

The buffet breakfast was ok with a selection of food.

I was seemingly able to turn on the AC, but I don’t believe it was actually pumping in cool air. Neither of us slept with the comforter and we both woke up sweaty one morning. The bathroom was clean, but I did notice the bathtub was dusty around the top, under the window and mirrors.

msg:Very nice rooms and good breakfast.  Location a little in the middle of new town construction sites.  The mall 10 mins walk away is great for shopping and restaurants.  The hotel restaurant only offered breakfast but it was ok to order deliveries in.  Hotel is slightly weird in that it’s also seems to be a neo natal staycation hotel with many nurses and families members hanging out in corridors at all times of night.  Main issue with the rooms was that they were 28 degrees C and there was no way to cool them down slightly to be able to sleep well.  Opening the windows didn’t help and the hotel aircon was understandably set to heating the room - maybe something they can think about.  Nice hotel and a good stay- just didn’t sleep well.

msg:I am very satisfied. Brother Ma Chao at the front desk of the hotel is very enthusiastic and meticulous. After seeing our family situation, he offered to become a Huazhu Club member and then helped to upgrade the room at the best price. It really gave people a feeling of family-like warmth and experience. Feeling at home, special thanks! The lights in the hotel lobby are very bright and a**ospheric, and the receptionist is quick and proactive in getting things done. The hotel closes breakfast at ten o'clock, which is really a rush. The breakfast was okay. The hot dishes were a bit Northeastern. I had chicken stewed with mushrooms and pork belly with sauerkraut. The pasta was too ordinary. Overall, I am very satisfied. The hardware facilities are very good, the service is warm and thoughtful, and the price-performance ratio is very high. I recommend everyone to stay here with children.

msg:The parent-child suite we booked is actually two rooms connected, so the children's room also has its own bathroom. The children's facilities are well equipped, including children's toothbrushes, shower gel, and children's bathrobes. The children are very happy. I have two children, one old and one small. I called the hotel in advance to book a room with two small beds. However, this room type was relatively rare and had already been booked. So I booked a room with the children's bed next to the wall. Once the door to the children's room is closed, it becomes its own world without disturbing each other, which is quite nice. The room is clean and tidy, and the temperature is suitable. It is not too high and makes people feel dry like some B&Bs I have stayed in before. The location of the hotel is a bit remote, not far from the Ice and Snow World, but a bit far from the Central Street. We had to take a taxi to get in and out. There is Sunac Mao Complex next to it, and there is also a bathing center that is said to be very popular.

msg:When I made the reservation a year ago, I checked the price on February 14th. It was 1,400 plus 1,600, two standard rooms for three days was 10,034, and it was 1,670/1 day. At 18:00 on the last day on 2.16, I saw that the room price for that day was 818. I asked Ctrip and she gave me an even price. Well, it changed to 2344 on the first day. The hotel is relatively clean and the service is good. I don’t know how the Songbei New District got a five-star rating. The windows were broken and the ventilation required the engineering depar**ent to tighten the screws every day. There are 2 screws on the first floor. There is a small store and an automatic receiving cabinet. The takeaway robot broke on the third day. The overall experience is quite clean and not worth the price. Fireworks can be seen outside the window. Check-out at noon is also extended to 14:00...

msg:I am from Harbin, and my home is just a 10-minute drive away. The Chinese New Year is approaching, and the brothers and sisters are gathering in Harbin. Booked two twin rooms. The children had a great time. Renting a swimming ring at the swimming pool for ¥50 was a bit ridiculous. The silly old girl may have been overseas for too many years. She just paid and brought two swimming rings back without asking. The staff helped me choose. The size is suitable for children, and the service is really good.
One room was cleaned perfectly, and the kettle in one room actually had hot water used by the previous guest... The old girl said that Harbin is popular now with many guests and the housekeeping pressure is high, so there is no need to talk about this small matter. Oh, anyway, we disagree on this point...
I came too early when I checked in. The front desk staff was very talkative and reassured me that I would give you an upgrade because the room was not cleaned yet. I have already booked an executive room, and I don’t know how I can upgrade to an executive twin room.
The boys at the concierge are also very serious about their work. There is a handsome guy who does not look like a big man from Northeast China. He helps the elder sister carefully pack and tie up all the luggage for storage. The service of this restaurant is really good. The elder sister said that she will come here again in the future. On the other side, the boss's word will be fulfilled. Looking forward to meeting again next year.
Also: parking is very good and easy to find.

The children were very happy to stay. The children's bathroom is separate and the facilities are very complete. The room Having windows is the most important thing for us southerners, because indoors in the north are too dry in winter. In addition, the front desk is equipped with two humidifiers, which are very powerful.
        When I came to Harbin for the first time, Wang Meng at the hotel front desk was the second Harbin person I met (the first one was an online ride-hailing driver). I felt particularly warm when meeting Wang Meng. The smile she gave me was sincere and kind. He was very friendly to me, a person who is afraid of social problems. He helped me book the arrangements for the next few days in a responsible and considerate manner, which also saved me a lot of money. During the three days, he was attentive and concerned about whether we had any needs, which made me feel at ease. I feel at home. I am very lucky to have such a warm person to lead me to a good start when I come to Harbin, which makes me full of good expectations for Harbin~
       I would also like to thank another hotel staff member, Li Xiaojing, for helping us check in because it takes some time to register as a member. While Jingjing was busy with other guests, she also reminded me of some matters here, so that I saw the tacit cooperation at the front desk and the meticulous care for the guests~
        Thank you two cuties~
        Of course, last but not least, we have to mention the two aunts who do hygiene work on the 15th floor. The elderly and children would often call us to ask for things, and they would go out of their way to get them for us. They were very considerate with smiles on their faces~
        I hope I have the opportunity to come to Harbin again~meet you again~and stay at Shibaige again~

msg:A relatively satisfactory stay experience.
I arrived at almost 10 o'clock on the day of check-in. The front desk staff was very patient and received me. Thank you very much.
The executive floor has a good view and is quiet.

In terms of hygiene: First, the coffee table is made of glass, so it is not difficult to see accumulated dirt and residue at the joints with the wooden coffee table. I hope it can be cleaned carefully in the future.
Secondly, there were unknown marks on the carpet. Although it was not a big stain, the guests felt uncomfortable after seeing it.

Facilities: First, the overall lighting switch design is reasonable and convenient, but the air conditioning control panel on the right hand side of the entrance will make abnormal noises from time to time. I hope it can be repaired.
Second, the bathroom and toilet are connected and share the same sliding glass door. When taking a shower, it is very laborious to pull the door to the far right. Similarly, it is also very laborious to push the door back to the left after finishing the shower. It should be due to the aging of the door track. Hope it can be repaired.

The overall stay experience was very good.

If it is a baby of one month old, a crib is provided. The children's room can sleep an adult and a baby. In addition, the master bedroom can sleep three adults and one child in total. It is suitable for off-season. The price is also very beautiful. The shuttle service is okay, but you need to make a reservation half an hour in advance. There are not many types of breakfast, but the price is not expensive. There is a fee for the kids club which is not a good thing. Everything else was pretty good. I arrived at noon and didn't have to wait for a room. The off-season experience was pretty good.

Environment: Not to mention the environment, the surrounding area is still under construction.

Service: I would like to give special praise to the concierge staff. After returning home, I discovered that I had lost one of my Bluetooth earphones. I immediately contacted the hotel staff. A young lady added my WeChat account and finally found my earphones. Really very grateful to them.
Breakfast: It was okay to stay for one or two days. After staying for five days, I really felt like I had nothing to eat. It was the same meal every day. The only thing that changed was the five or six stir-fried dishes. The stir-fried dishes were a bit overdone. Suitable for people with bad teeth.

During my stay, I encountered problems with the desk lamp and shower head, but they were quickly resolved, which is worthy of praise during the Spring Festival. If you order takeout, we can help deliver it upstairs.
The neighborhood is actually quite desolate. There is a bathing center and a 15-minute walk from Sunac Shopping Mall.
The parent-child room is actually a connected room, so it actually has two rooms and two bathrooms, which is better than other parent-child rooms. The child is very satisfied.
On the day of check-in, we even brought frozen pears as a turn-down gift, which was full of sincerity.
The hotel swimming pool is outsourced and cannot always be opened according to the declared business hours, which greatly affects the guest experience. Fortunately, the manager on duty is sincere and hopes that this issue will attract the attention of the management.

I stayed in the hotel for 12 days. The hotel facilities are great, but there is only a bad review. The auntie is very perfunctory in cleaning. She doesn't do any extra work. The clothes she took off are on the bed, and she won't fold them when she tidies up the bed. On the sofa, even if I threw it on the sofa, I brought my own sheets, and when I cleaned the bed, I only made the quilt. The sheets under the quilt were still messy, and they said that I would clean it for you after dinner.

msg:At first, the three of us booked two rooms, one with a normal big bed and the other with a cute twin room. Everything in the big bed room was normal and there was nothing to say. The cute twin room was on the 6th floor. As soon as I got off the elevator, I smelled a strong smell of dog urine. After entering the room, the smell became even stronger. There was still uncleaned dog poop on the floor in the room. The whole room smelled like that of a pet market. Moreover, the pictures on Ctrip are completely different from the actual room. The pictures on Ctrip look clean and generous, and the bathroom has a bathtub. However, the actual room only has a shower. The room is dark and humid, and the smell is overwhelming. When I contacted the staff, she actually asked me where I was. I changed rooms and they still cleaned me. Later, they changed me to a room with a normal king bed. The price difference was supposed to be 52 yuan and was not refunded to me. The price of a cute twin room was 450 yuan and a regular king bed was 398 yuan. They were given to me when we checked out. We have a broken plastic water cup. I come to Sunac because I always came here when it was Wanda. At that time, the service attitude and hygienic environment could be said to be first-class. Now Sunac is really disappointing!

Only when they were in the room did they agree to help me continue the search, but they did not notify me of the results in time afterwards. I took the initiative to call and inquire, and then they replied that the bracelet was found. I asked how and where it was found, and he hesitated. I can’t answer the answer clearly. You can imagine what’s going on here. I’ve stayed in hotels in many places. This is the first time I’ve picked up something left behind by a customer and didn’t take the initiative to return it.

There are no disadvantages
The breakfast must be a bit poor, but it’s also cheap. The breakfast is super cost-effective. You can make DIY sandwiches, my favorite.

1. When checking in, the front desk can introduce the hotel's facilities and equipment to the guests, what time does the restaurant open, what time does the swimming pool work out, etc.
2. There is no introduction at the front desk, so I want to look for relevant information on TV. The hotel’s promotional video is quite long, so you can pause a little longer on the hotel’s introduction page, or pass it without seeing it clearly
3. Strengthen the staff's knowledge of hotel products, make a phone call to ask whether the room includes breakfast, whether the suite includes courtesy, it takes a long time to wait, and the answer is not very smooth, or call back later or transfer to the manager
4. The staff of the restaurant strengthen the training of service awareness. When they see empty dishes on the table of the guests, they will take the initiative to collect them, and when they go to eat, someone will take the seat.
5. The suite is not a smart toilet, the curtains are not electric, no courtesy, pure room! Do you need to check clearly when booking breakfast?
6. There is no discount for meals for members of Huazhu Club
This housing experience score is 3.5-4 points, and the rest is for understanding points, the above is for reference only

The dinner is settled at the hotel. The buffet dinner has a small hot pot, which tastes good, and the drinks are all self-service.

Hahaha, the a**osphere of Harbin was born spontaneously, and the heating in the room was also very good. It is not at all in a hotel. It will be cold.
There are not many people in the swimming pool, the water is a bit cold, and the children's playground is not big, but it is enough for children's entertainment.
The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes great, even eating braised noodles for a few days is not greasy.
Children like the robot Bingbing the most, and they are overjoyed every time they take out food.
I should stay here again next time, it's very good.

The staff at the front desk during the holidays are very enthusiastic. Seeing that we brought children with us, we specially helped to upgrade the executive floor with a higher floor and better thermal insulation.
On the first night, I called and asked for two extra bottles of mineral water. When I extended my stay on the second night, there were four bottles in the room. Very considerate
When renewing the room card, the front desk also enthusiastically asked about the experience of check-in. Are there any deficiencies and needs to be improved? Overall, this is a very comfortable and friendly hotel. I look forward to my next stay

The temperature in the room was extremely high, as high as 28°C. I couldn't sleep at all because my sleep quality was very poor, and I had to work the next day , so very angry. But Ma Wenli, the manager on duty, solved the problem very quickly. Some small details are very touching, especially after I came back from work the next day, the temperature of the room was very comfortable and I felt good. Maybe it's because of the epidemic, the breakfast is not bright, it's quite satisfactory, but it's okay. Overall, a strong sense of service. The Wanda Hotel Group has been staying since its opening. I personally recommend the Songbei five-star hotel, which is relatively new.

Fortunately, the attitude and processing speed are very timely. This is the first time I choose this brand of hotel. I like the style and layout very much, and it left a particularly good impression on me. I would like to praise the lady who was in the lobby helping my mother back out of Room 1519! It perfectly solved my mother's problem at that time, and I had a very pleasant stay experience. I will give priority to choosing hotels of your brand in the future

The one I bought with breakfast picture one is that there are many types of breakfast in the hotel. The service is very good! The kvass in the room is very good and the cleaning aunt is very good! At that time, we were in a hurry to go out and told our aunt to clean and fold the clothes. That day, my husband was not feeling well, and in the middle of the night, I troubled the staff to open the window at 12 o&#39;clock in the middle of the night. The efficiency was also very close to Sunac Paradise! There is also a lot of food nearby. The room has a bathtub, a small refrigerator, an iron, and a safe. The facilities are very complete. I lost one and the lady at the front desk made up one and gave a total of four. Yes, I saw a bad review before and said yes The towel is not changed, it is not the one with the text posted near the sink. If you put it in the tank, it responds to environmental protection. In short, the hotel service is very good, efficient, very convenient to eat and drink, and this group purchase is completely independent! This is the first time I want to write so many positive comments, I hope it can help others to refer to 😀

msg:The cleanliness of the room is hard to describe, and the cleaning is very sloppy. After staying for 5 nights, the sheets were changed once, and the hair was not cleaned. The table looks like a layer of dust, no one wiped it. I didn't wash the bathtub either. I used the bathtub the day before, and I lost my hair in the bathtub. It was still there the next day when I came back, which means that I didn't wash it at all. I had to buy detox to disinfect it. The same is true for the water in the kettle. One night I was hungry and made noodles, and half of the water was left in the pot. It was still there on the second day, and it was still there on the third day... I think cleaning is probably just vacuuming the floor, changing towels, and adding some toothbrush or something. Those who bring children here don’t take the initiative to provide bathrobes for the children, and so do the spare parts. They keep calling to ask for them, making them look like beggars, and they are very speechless after chasing them. On the fourth day, I made an appoin**ent with Snow World to go out to play. There was a sudden heavy rain and there was no umbrella in the room. I went downstairs and asked the concierge to tell the concierge that they had borrowed all the umbrellas. As a result, the tickets were cancelled. This is very incomprehensible, even if it is Atour and the like Will there be an umbrella for each room? It also claims to be a five-star hotel, which is really incomprehensible. The attitude of the manager surnamed Wu is still good, but the whole hotel is hard to describe. As a parent-child hotel, it is not very good. It is one kilometer away from Sunac Mall. I am tired from walking, so I can only take a taxi. Next time I go, I recommend staying at Wanda Vista, which is next door and close to the park. The hotel is located in Jiangbei, a bit far from the urban area. It is more than 30 yuan from Didi to Central Street. It is inconvenient to travel. In the future, we still have to stay near Central Street. There are more dining options.

The smoke alarm in the room was right above the bed, and when I opened my eyes, I could see the red light flashing there, thinking it was a camera. It's embarrassing.

When I arrived at the hotel and forgot my mobile phone in the car, the concierge took the initiative to borrow my mobile phone to make a call. I took my mobile phone and helped to pack my luggage when I went out. When I was injured, he was very careful to explain to his colleagues that they brought me two suitcases to my room. The little girl at the front desk was also very good. The executive floor was upgraded for free, and there were thoughtful telephone return visits, express mail, and the main surroundings were next to Sunac. Mao is very convenient for shopping, I will live here in the future!

The overall feeling of staying in the hotel is very good, and it is a hotel with high cost performance. And it is very convenient to communicate, which is the kind of quiet and convenient location I like. There are shopping malls and restaurants around, and it is also very close to the expressway.
You will feel very comfortable when you enter the lobby. The service staff and managers at the front desk are very enthusiastic and can make you feel honored. The concierge is also very enthusiastic to help with luggage. This hotel is worth recommending and worth staying in.
But what surprised me the most was that I should have left a piece of clothing. I can mention that the price is definitely not cheap. Haven't heard anything from the housekeeping staff until now. Very disappointed!
But next time I will choose to stay here, but I must have left a bad impression!

Because the big bed room I booked did not have a big bed room, the little brother at the front desk upgraded the executive room. It was very considerate, but to be honest, the decoration style of the Crowne Plaza is a bit old-fashioned. If you choose it yourself, you should not live here. I have nothing to say about hotel service, but I am not satisfied with Sunac's practice of selling dog meat. The decoration should be taken off the shelves and consumers should not be deceived.

msg:First stay.
Arrive at the parking lot, there is no security guard, no concierge, just stop at will, enter at will, no one cares, and the same goes for leaving the store.
At the beginning of check-in, the attitude of all the staff was cold, and the incomprehensible sense of superiority was very dissuading. I said that the room type I booked with Ctrip was said to be an upgraded room type. The eldest sister was very cold: it was already an executive floor.
Entering the room, it is not big, and the garden downstairs is a barren meadow. Later, I observed it, and it seemed that it was only different from the ordinary room type in the floor, and the others were the same, and it was 150 yuan more expensive.
I wanted to add a crib, so I sent an iron white-painted dog cage with a mattress 40 centimeters from the ground and a railing one meter high. I said thank you, I don't need it, the waitress smiled helplessly, as if I was a **.
When you actually check in, you can hear the sound of other rooms in the bathroom; all the shampoo and shower gel are fixed on the wall, afraid that I will steal it? During the Dragon Boat Festival, I lost all my money for such an expensive hotel. Would you like some shampoo? Too petty.
In the evening, the children go to the so-called Kids Club on the fifth floor. There is nothing, just a few broken Lego books, and no game facilities. Next to it is a cat room where you can go in and play. The condition is that one big and one small can buy a drink for 28 yuan, and another parent will pay 28 yuan.
For breakfast, Ctrip paid for it together with the room rate, 51. It is said that it is more than 100 for a single purchase. I went there at nine o'clock, and I was about to cry when I walked around. What was it? By the time we left, the white sugar was gone and there was no refill, the coffee machine didn’t work twice, the soy sauce bowl next to the fried egg was gone and there was only a label left, there was almost nothing to eat, the service staff seemed to be the big boss .
After leaving the store, I sent some shampoo and shower gel, and attached a small card. I hope I will give a five-star praise, and add the name of the waiter on the card.
Excuse me, who are you? Have you ever served me? Have you seen me?
How many stars is this guest house?

I showed my itinerary code and health code when I entered the door, and walked a dozen steps to the front desk. You also need to show the itinerary code, okay, let's cooperate. The manager said what kind of room was upgraded for me. When I went to the room, it was worse than what I had booked. The strong smell of smoke hit my face, and I was not feeling well. I called immediately to change the room, but I waited for half an hour. There was no news, so I called again and waited for more than ten minutes. Finally, the doorbell rang, and the robot sent the room card, and no one helped to carry the luggage. I took the luggage to the 17th floor by myself. The same room, the smell of smoke is slightly less It’s a little bit, but mixed with other flavors, I am completely disappointed with this hotel, and I don’t want to bother. Generally, I don’t give bad reviews to hotels. This hotel is too weird, far inferior to a 200 yuan budget hotel.

服務：很差！酒店房間照片和實際不符！

裝修很新，小童房的裝飾非常好，兩大兩小的家庭套房性價比很高。娃可以在自己房間玩個把小時

離譜的是，你説他小氣吧，他自助早餐可以打包，這是我沒聽説過的。你説他大方吧，五樓的小童遊樂室是收費的。那麼寒磣的小童房竟然要收費，是我都不好意思説出口，也是聞所未聞的。

好在隔壁是銀河水世界，我寧願花二百到隔壁去遛娃啥都有。

於是就決定住它了😬
入住的時候前台小姐姐服務態度很好 
當時有問機場巴士的訊息 小姐姐很好的給我解決啦
自助早餐也很不錯 阿姨給我做的煎餅果子特香🌯
然後重點來啦❗️❗️
酒店是有提供去雪場的班車哦 去前台預約就ok
特別表揚:班車的兩位司機師傅都十分的熱情❗️
也非常的友善 滿滿的凸顯了東北人的熱情好客
希望酒店方看到我這條評價給他們好好表揚🥳
如果下次再來哈爾濱 一定會再來這家酒店🤩

設施：非常不錯 有浴缸 我真的太愛了❤️
衞生：挺乾淨的 我是一個有潔癖的 我覺得ok

酒店內部：房間寬敞，但是設施維護得不好，水池裡的堵頭都是壞的，衞生間牆紙污漬明顯，浴缸污漬明顯，淋浴區設施還行，床邊USB接口衹有一側可以用，另一側是污漬嚴重，接觸無效。
酒店服務：客房服務不錯，有求必應，另外酒店內送貨機器人很給力，幫忙送了好幾次東西。
酒店衹有室外停車場，沒有地下停車場，不過可以使用隔壁皇冠假日的停車場，晚上如果回去晚，泊車有困難。不過停車場工作人員很負責，會及時引導，幫客人尋找合適車位。這點很贊👍🏻

平時帶著狗子住店真的很麻煩
但是這家對我家狗子真的無敵友好⋯
雖然入住過程中有小摩擦
但是最終也都完好解決
希望店家能把這項亮點服務堅持下去
性價比拉滿⋯
爸爸媽媽覺得床非常舒適⋯
果然是親子酒店，去的時候發現都是父母帶著孩子來玩⋯
我們此次旅行也算是親子遊啦

衞生：衞生條件可以，未發現問題

環境：酒店設施比較新，環境不錯，風格也很喜歡，早餐種類豐富，味道也不錯

服務：服務很好，前台小姐姐幫我們免費升級了房型。有一個地方是衞生間的門鎖有問題，很容易把人鎖在裏面，雖然後來叫了阿姨很快修好，但是建議將這個門鎖的問題徹底解決一下。

總的來説入住體驗不錯，之後還會選擇施柏閣酒店。
