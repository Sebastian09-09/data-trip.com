msg:The location ist very good - in the middle of the forest next to a village and to the Great Wall. The different houses are distributed - There is a well organised driving service installed. We enjoyed the area. The promised private access to the Great Wall exist - but it stops at an gate which gives you no official access onto the Great Wall. To get on it is need to go back to the village to enter the official public area Shuiguan. As well for kids you can find a nice area. The pool was closed due to Covid prevention measures. The food was really well - barbecue buffet in the evening and good breakfast in the morning with a very supporting team. The sport facilities like table tennis,‚Ä¶.are also welcome but maintenance is highly recommended. Regarding the room I expected much more maintained situation for the high price. The A/C was hit by mud and it drops down to the ground. The included minibar contains 2 bottles of water (which is normally given always for free). The shower itself was also with lime at the shower head. If all this would be very well you can expect very well furnished and designed rooms. But from a Hyatt driven facility I expect more based on the name and high price.

msg:The concept of the hotel is very nice, different designs of houses in different styles in a big park area.

Unfortunately it's visible that the some investment in maintenance are missing. On some houses it's visible that some renovation must be done (face of building falling down), in our room big scratches on the wall, doors of cabinet not closing, AC first not working. Meanwhile the houses have no view anymore, because the trees in front became too big, some gardening work is necessary.

The service has to be improved, in the bar not all drinks were available because some  basic things (mint) were missing. I'm sure in the kitchen mint is available, pick it up there, but don't tell the costumer it's not available.
Breakfast/Brunch time is very long from 07:30 to 13:00 o'clock, we missed the explanation, that around 11 o'clock the food will change from breakfast to lunch. As we asked for an orange juice, it was told not available anymore, after some clear words we got it. I think not the right service attitude for a 5 star hotel. 
My daughter who is very interested in architecture missed the explanation which architect designed which house, what is the idea behind, a pity, the nice concept should be sold better.
Summary, investment in facility, surrounding and service is necessary, otherwise the high price is not worth it.

I stayed in Farmhouse 2, with a swimming pool and a coffee house in front. I will leave it for the next experience. From the beginning of the order, the housekeeper Miss Li Ruinan contacted to help arrange the room. She was very considerate and responsive. She helped to book a lunch restaurant and dinner could also be delivered to the room. The hotel environment is really good. There are not many mosquitoes in the early summer, and you can climb the mountain. Even during the May Day Golden Week, it is comfortable when the rooms are fully booked, and you won't feel overcrowded. There are also many farmhouses near the hotel for dining, and several Internet celebrity restaurants are also good choices. In short, it can be arranged next time!

msg:Some time ago, I bought a room at the Commune at the Foot of the Great Wall on the strong recommendation of a friend. It happened that the time of my baby's extracurricular class was adjusted this week, so we decided to come here for a weekend.
Because the reservation was late, I didn't know if there were any suitable rooms, so I called the store with a try-and-see attitude. We were greeted by a front desk receptionist named Sunny. I'm so glad that I contacted her in advance. She listened to our demands very patiently and helped us coordinate a more suitable room type as much as possible to meet the needs of the elderly and children. My parents and baby were very happy. Due to the sudden change in weather on the weekend, we also received her warm reminder before leaving, asking us to bring more clothes and keep warm. This made us feel the warmth and thoughtfulness of the hotel before we arrived at the hotel. After checking in, she paid more attention to every detail of our stay, took the initiative to ask, and took the initiative to help, so that we had a very good experience throughout the entire stay!
I was very happy during the hotel stay, whether it was the room arrangement or the warm service anytime and anywhere. The hotel environment is elegant, as if it is a work of art in nature. Standing on the terrace of our room, you can get close to the kingfisher and squirrel, which feels amazing. The architecture here is very artistic, and it is worthy of living in a work of art in the building. Especially when we checked in, it was rainy and interesting. The breakfast on the second day was well received by the elderly and children. It was nutritious, healthy and rich. The entertainment facilities in the children's commune and the gym are always attracting adults and children, and they can play anytime and anywhere.
In this mountain, whether it is the natural scenery or the hotel facilities, we can always find fun. Feel the joy of weekend leisure! Looking forward to the next stay and the next wonderful experience! Thanks again, Sunny!

msg:A commune with five-star service, five-star environment and three-star facilities. The service attitude is the most satisfactory part of this trip. Oliver Wang Yuanyuan at the front desk has a sweet voice, a bright smile, and considerate and enthusiastic service. He took a map to explain in detail the area where the courtyard where we were assigned to live is located, making people feel at home. The environment in the commune is quiet and elegant. There were not many guests on the day of check-in. It was leisurely and fresh to stroll along the tree-lined avenue. Parking is free. The sports venues are well-equipped, with badminton, table tennis, shuffleboard and trampoline, which can kill time. The half roast duck presented for dinner is quite authentic, with shiny color, crispy skin and tender meat. I ordered a few dishes by myself, which is also the level of a five-star chef. Breakfast may not be a buffet but a meal because the occupancy rate is not high. There are not many varieties but the quality is good. What I don‚Äôt like is the decoration in the room, which is minimalist style, four white floors, old bathroom facilities, and the sound of the small refrigerator after starting is loud, which affects sleep. For me who are used to living in five-star hotels, I am very uncomfortable. Of course, this cannot be blamed on the hotel. People are just this kind of design that pursues individuality üòÖ

I felt full of energy all of a sudden. It is really a treasure hotel in the suburbs of the imperial capital. I saw comments before that the environment here is good but the facilities and services are not up to par. I found that it is not the case at all after I stayed here. Maybe it is because the management has improved after Hyatt took over? üòÄ The front desk girl, restaurant service, and parking lot guy I met were all smiling and thoughtful without crossing the line. The water gate Great Wall next to the hotel is also magnificent and charming. This time I was upgraded to a courtyard house. Next time I hope to stay in the famous bamboo house to experience it.

msg:I have heard of it for a long time, and finally I have the opportunity to experience it. The hotel is truly wild and luxurious, with a whole mountain and the Great Wall outside the window. This kind of scenery is unique. The hotel has a total of 36 villas, designed by 12 young and cutting-edge designers in Asia, and each building is unique. This time I stayed in the red house, which is full of design sense. It may be to cater to friends, families, and group travel, so the public area is very large. If you are a big family or traveling with friends, it should be very pleasant to gather in the living room to drink and chat. The front desk service is super good. Kitty helped upgrade the family room. There are two king-size bed bedrooms. Compared with the original king-size bed room, the area is larger, but because the building itself highlights the public area, the guest room area is slightly cramped. The mountain villa hotel is not like a building, and the loss is definitely greater, so the hotel‚Äôs infrastructure is a bit old, but in front of the beautiful scenery, it can also be made do. The hotel also sent a picnic basket, sandwiches, muffin cakes, juice, mineral water, cakes, everything, really exceeded expectations!

The meaning of a house is not necessarily indoors. For poets, they hope to have a residence that can face nature, the sky, and the mountains. The original conception of the Commune at the Foot of the Great Wall was born. I love the bamboo house, which was designed by Japanese designer Kengo Kuma. This scene is also the filming location of Chunjiao and Zhiming. Take a walk between the bamboo house and the red house, the woods are green, and the capital is 28 degrees today, with no clouds, so nice!

msg:Finally, I lived in the commune I had been dreaming about. I was really happy, but I also had some regrets. First, I regretted that I went too late. I wanted to go there when my child was one or two years old, but she was already a teenager before I went there. Hahaha; second, I regretted that I only stayed there for one night this time. I came and went in a hurry.
To be honest, the hotel has been there for many years, and some facilities are indeed old and not so new. It is quite standard to live in, but the highlights are not outstanding.
The various villas scattered on both sides of the mountain road should be the biggest feature of the commune. The villa we stayed in this time is a forest cabin with two floors. The whole villa is divided into two. Each area can accommodate three families (a standard family of three, maybe it can barely accommodate a family with two children). There is a standard room plus a public area downstairs, and two standard rooms plus a rest area upstairs.
I didn‚Äôt have time to see the structures of other types of villas. I would like to live in them and experience them when I have the opportunity in the future.
The air in the mountains is really good, with insects chirping at night and birds singing in the morning, and lilac, mountain peach, winter jasmine, apricot blossoms, etc. in spring, which are brilliant.
Beauty makes people intoxicated. Beauty also makes people uneasy, so I didn't sleep in again in the morning. I went up the mountain road alone. In the middle, I met a kind hotel shuttle driver who took me to Mr. Pan's villa at the end of the mountain road (unfortunately, I only saw the gate)...
Oh, the essay has become a running account again, so I'll stop.
In short, the experience is great and I will go again.
I especially like the girl at the front desk "Huo Luo Mu Le" (sorry I forgot to ask her name). From booking the hotel until we left, the service was considerate and warm. I hope to meet her again next time I go.

From the beginning of the stay, Kitty at the front desk took into account that we were two adults and two children, and arranged for us to stay in the parent-child twin suite of the Red House Villa. This was the most comfortable stay during the trip. I didn't worry that the child would fall off the bed again. She was very considerate and sent the luggage to the room. Thank you Kitty at the front desk for her thoughtful service. As soon as I arrived at the villa, the spacious public space, large balcony, large dining table, and 4 living rooms were so comfortable. The children ran around in the villa and were very happy. I was also surprised when I had breakfast the next day. They were all real ingredients, freshly squeezed juice, beef noodles with large pieces of beef, mature honey, and super sweet fruits. In the park, the air is very fresh and quiet, and it is full of lilac flowers. The whole park is fragrant, and walking in the park is a pleasure. This is a treasure resort hotel, which will definitely be a big hit and I will come again. When I checked out, Kitty at the front desk helped to move the luggage to the car and took the initiative to send 4 bottles of water. The service was very considerate. Thank you again.

The whole villa I booked, there are big bags of garbage in the lobby, the door of the equipment room is wide open, the house is extremely hot, and the cleaning staff came in uninvited to clean up the things even after I checked in.
There are unfinished construction sites everywhere outside the door, and the environment is unsightly.
There is no distinction between parking spaces, and once they were occupied by others, there was nowhere to park.
There is almost no management, whether it is entering the hotel to find the front desk, looking for a room, parking or breakfast, there is no one at all, and the housekeeper is useless.
The gym facilities are few and most of them are dilapidated. I don‚Äôt know how much a few normal badmintons cost. The children‚Äôs center is full of charged video games and activities that charge multiples of those outside. Free activities are not allowed to participate even if the time is not over.

The villa is hidden between the mountains and forests, which is very interesting.
There is a Hanfu experience activity during the Qingming Festival. My wife and daughter wore Hanfu to see the peach blossoms in the garden, which was very beautiful.
The service is good, equivalent to a five-star hotel, especially COCO, and a little squirrel doll was given before leaving

We set up our own outdoor table and chairs, drank tea and soaked in the sun, listening to the chirping of birds. It was very comfortable! I ordered a hot pot set meal for dinner, which was very enjoyable for 2 people and 3 people. The beautiful and generous Olivier who received us at the front desk explained everything patiently and carefully. She was still at the front desk during breakfast the next morning. She was in great spirits and full of energy! The buffet breakfast is very rich. Many families come with children. There are also free children's crafts included in the package. In addition, the Shuiguan Great Wall, 1.5 kilometers away from the hotel, is also worth climbing. All in all a perfect weekend.

She remembered that I brought my baby to celebrate my birthday and upgraded us to a courtyard suite, which is 60 square meters in size. She also gave us a cute little squirrel mascot. The baby has been with me these two days. I like it very much! The room is very clean and quiet. It is very suitable for taking children for a leisure vacation. It would be even more beautiful if the mountains are full of peach blossoms in April! The set meal includes half a roast duck, and we were upgraded to a whole roast duck. As a person from the Pearl River Delta with picky taste buds, I can responsibly say that the taste is very good, better than the famous roast duck restaurants in the city! I have already recommended it to my friends and will come again if I have the chance!

It is very convenient and there are very few people. Climbing the Great Wall is a great experience, and the internal environment of the hotel is also good. You can walk outdoors and enjoy the natural scenery. There are also various fitness and entertainment equipment. There is also a children's commune to meet the needs of raising children. The rooms are also relatively clean and hygienic, making it suitable for families to travel with children.

msg:üé¨Opening remarks

For my last family trip in 2023, I chose the Commune Hotel at the foot of the Great Wall^. The reason is actually very simple. Because it is Chris**as, I want to take the children to experience the environment and weather that Chris**as should have, so I chose to go into the mountains. .

üå≥Environment

The hotel is located in the deepest part of Yanqing Shuiguan Great Wall Shifosi Village, which is already deep in the mountains and old forests.

The snow in downtown Beijing has melted, but here it still looks like it just finished falling.

The accommodation areas are all villas in the woods, which are a bit primitive.

So the scenery and air are very good, a bit like Gou Xiong Ridge in Xiong Da Xiong Er.

Of course it‚Äôs also several degrees cooler than the city.

üè†Room type

This time we stayed in a twin room with terrace and mountain view.

There is a quite large balcony, and the mountain and snow views are particularly spectacular and beautiful.

The room is quite large and the bathroom has a bathtub. The only drawback is that the two beds are not big.

The temperature in the room was pretty good, but the bathroom had floor heating, which made my feet a bit hot.

It's just that the room is relatively dry, so it's best to put a humidifier.

üíÅFacilities

The service is good.

It was a bit slow to check in. I found that the front desk had to manually enter the information. The system should be upgraded, which affected efficiency.

However, the service staff are very friendly and their service attitude is also very good.

There is a shuttle bus from the front desk to the check-in area, but you have to wait during peak hours.

When I left, I gave the children small giftsüéÅ.

ü•òCatering

Breakfast is provided.

The variety is not as rich as in a five-star hotel, maybe it has something to do with the snow in the mountains.

There are a few good ones, such as honey, smoked salmon fat, Yakult, etc.

It tasted good too, and the kids ate a lot.

üé≠Activities

There are not many children's activities here. There is a special children's activity center, but there are not many activities.

If some activities can be organized, I believe there will be many more parent-child tours.

üèùTIPS

‚úÖIt is not far from the Great Wall and the Wildlife Park, so you can go there.

‚úÖThe weather is good and there is a Great Wall CityWalk, but it is a bit slippery now, so be cautious.

‚úÖIt is best to eat in a hotel, which is convenient but not cheap.
Otherwise, just drive out to eat, there are also restaurants.

‚úÖIf you bring children, it is best to arrange the activities in advance. You can also play in the snow, but it‚Äôs too cold.

‚úÖIt feels more suitable for vacations, meetings, team building, and parent-child attributes. It is not too high.

The front desk service was warm and thoughtful, telling us where to take pictures and where we could see the Great Wall. There is a welcome fruit plate and buffet breakfast. The security guards will open the door for you when they meet you on the street. The expressions of the employees are all happy, which shows that the management here is very good. The restaurant is not cheap, but you get a voucher with your order, and the ingredients and chef's skills are very good, worthy of this level. In short, the facilities and services are equivalent to those of a four- or five-star hotel. Living in the forest, the air is very fresh, and the room is warm and clean. It is perfect for people like me who want to be close to nature without suffering. Not far from the hotel is the Shuiguan Great Wall. When the peach blossoms bloom, I will definitely come.

msg:For a family trip to Beijing, we had a plan to stay at the Badaling Great Wall, so we booked accommodation at the foot of the Great Wall. I learned online in advance that it is built against a mountain. The houses are not all single-family villas, but they are far apart and have a good sense of space. Although it is an hour's drive from the city, I still lost one day of accommodation in the city and added one night here.
Arrive at the store at eight o'clock in the evening. Li Ruinan at the front desk was enthusiastic and thoughtful. He gave a detailed introduction and quickly arranged check-in. He proactively greeted me every day for the next three days and provided butler-style serviceüëç. Walking up the mountain road to Shanzhai No. 2, the tranquility of the moonlight in the forest is very Well, my daughter recited the phrase "The moonrise scares the mountains, and the birds sing in the spring streams." It really fits the tranquility of the mountains. When choosing to stay here, I also considered that my daughter has a place to play outside the hotel room. The mountains, trees, fallen leaves, and autumn sun , Xingyue is her source of happiness these days.
The buildings, mountain paths, and trees in the mountain meet the needs of people walking, and they are deliberately constructed with little artificial effort, maintaining the true nature of the mountain. Listening to the caressing of leaves on the balcony every night, watching the branches and fallen leaves as far as the eye can see from the balcony in the morning, taking a deep breath of the slightly cooler air of the mountains and forests, I deeply feel the closeness between man and nature, and that man should be the spirit of nature.
The hotel's breakfast category is of sufficient quality and the rooms and services are in line with the Hyatt brand. On the night of check-in, the housekeeper arranged a small tent for the room. When leaving the hotel, my daughter got a stuffed squirrel toy from the housekeeper. These joys should make her remember this commune, and her happiness is our happiness.
We are crowded in Beijing‚Äôs scenic spots every day and stay in the wild mountains and forests at night. Should our travels be to check in at the scenic spots or to get close to the mountains and forests? This trip to Beijing was more enjoyable and richer because of the commune at the foot of the Great Wall.

msg:To celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday, I deliberately chose a commune where grass has been planted for a long time to experience the late autumn scenery in the mountains. Although it is the off-season, there are still many guests staying at the hotel. Olivier Wang at the front desk provided warm and thoughtful service, upgraded our room type, and provided us with a late check-out service in case of bad weather, which was very heartwarming. The commune is built on the mountain, and each house has a different design style. Every staff member you meet will explain patiently. There are not many types of breakfast, but every meal is carefully prepared, especially the noodle stalls. The ingredients are exquisite and the taste is very good. It is recommended to add some activities suitable for children, especially when outdoor experiences are not suitable, so that children and adults can have space for entertainment. A very good stay experience.

Spending three days on the weekend and two days in the mountains is a good choice! Climbing wild roads, playing badminton, dazing, and gaining a happy mood~
Considering that it is in the mountains, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, and it feels like it has improved compared to 2021, and it feels like there are more and more guests (of course, sharing a common area with strangers is still a bit of a social fear)
ps: Personally, I feel that summer and autumn are the two most worthwhile seasons to visit. I will come again next time if there is a discount!

It is too unfriendly to children, very unsafe, and has potential safety hazards. The second one was a farmhouse, on the first floor, but it was cold in the room! Even if the air conditioner is turned on, it won't work. My family is all cold and cold. The third is a bamboo house. It is on the lower floor. It feels like a ba*****t. The layout of the house is weird and not very good. There is no place to dry clothes, and there is no stool for children to brush their teeth. In general, the publicity gimmicks here are various award-winning buildings, and the lobby is very grand, but the design of the rooms is the opposite, all kinds of unreasonable, very inhumane, the space is small, the facilities are not complete, and the experience It feels very bad, especially for families with children! And the service is also very cold and rigid. They watched us running around with our children, and they did not recommend a suitable room type to meet the needs of customers. There is art, and it is okay to take pictures, but the most basic What about your accommodation needs? The price is not low, but what you get is a cold house instead of a warm accommodation experience with attitude! It is highly not recommended for families with young children!

First of all, I would like to praise their reception service, especially our butler Mr. Liu Jianping. When I arrived at the commune, he patiently answered all my questions about accommodation and local tourism. Their professionalism and enthusiasm made me feel at home instantly.
Secondly, I was also very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the room. The rooms are warmly and comfortably furnished, and the beds are soft and comfortable. At the same time, all facilities in the room are in order.
In addition, the location of the commune is also very convenient. It is located at the foot of the Great Wall, making it very convenient for visiting the Great Wall or exploring surrounding attractions. The surrounding transportation is also very convenient, making my travel easier.
Overall, I had an unforgettable holiday in the commune at the foot of the Great Wall. I was deeply satisfied with the excellent service, comfortable accommodation and thoughtful care. If you are looking for an accommodation option near the Great Wall, I highly recommend the Commune at the foot of the Great Wall!

msg:I was too lazy to go far away during the National Day, so I went to Chongli and Yanqing for three days with my children and elderly people. On the second night, I chose an architect and my husband always wanted to go here. The price during the National Day is quite reasonable. It is not doubled like other hotels. It is about 1/3 more expensive than usual. The hotel welcomes two large plates of fruit. It is the most generous hotel I have ever stayed in. The housekeeper Jianming contacted us on WeChat one day in advance and sent us the route, restaurant menu, attractions and hotel special courses. There is a shuttle bus available after check-in. The children wanted to take a bus to browse the park before checking out the next day. The housekeeper was also very patient and detailed while driving. He also took us to visit several masterpieces that were temporarily unoccupied. , I also gave my child a small doll as a gift before checking out. The overall experience is quite good. As an old Internet celebrity hotel for so many years, the maintenance is also very good. Apart from being slightly outdated, I did not find any hygiene dead spots. The breakfast is also very rich, but the dinner price is a bit expensive. The price of resort hotels is not very affordable in Beijing, but the taste is pretty good. Another thing that is particularly amazing is that I originally thought that the room with large floor-to-ceiling windows might have a lower indoor temperature, but the air conditioner turned out to be very powerful and the room was very warm. This is much better than a well-known five-star family hotel in Miyun that I stayed at during the same period last year. There are many, and it is also a place of great concern when traveling with children. I would consider staying again in other seasons.

msg:A pleasant and comfortable experience, warm and thoughtful service, people don't want to leave!
This evaluation is objective and true!
We arrived at the store at around eleven o'clock in the evening. As soon as the car parked at the entrance of the lobby, the concierge was waiting beside the car to help with our luggage without any rush. Lee at the front desk followed us to the door and welcomed us to the front desk to check in. He was warm and reasonable. He helped us upgrade to a single-family forest cabin and communicated with the room in advance to arrange welcome fruits. The check-in process was smooth and all questions were answered. Our requests were responded to in a timely manner, and the attentive service was not cut short just because it was late at night. The next day, they will continue to care about our needs and arrange solutions in a timely manner, making an ordinary stay feel like going home and making the stay worthwhile with friends.
The deep forest hut was also a pleasant surprise. It was very big and spacious. There are pictures below, so I won‚Äôt go into details.
The next day we went to Shuiguan Great Wall and the concierge arranged a car transfer. The enthusiastic conversations along the way gave us a deeper understanding of Shuiguan Great Wall and the commune. Song Wei from the concierge picked us up back to the commune and drove us in a sightseeing car. We visited the hotel park and introduced the twelve first-phase template villas in the park, their designers, and the four most popular villas that were later reproduced. The explanation was detailed and courteous.
The park is rich in green plants and the air is fresh, making people feel at ease and quiet.
A wonderful encounter makes people look forward to the next time we get together. This time we are in a hurry, and we hope we can take it easy next time. Thanks to the commune at the foot of the Great Wall for bringing a wonderful ending to our journey with our children.
PS: The breakfast is rich and comfortable to eat

The food in the Chinese restaurant and the breakfast room are all online. We are very enthusiastic. At night, when the mountains are cold, we will use a commercial vehicle to send them back to the room. The room package gave the tickets to the Great Wall of Shuiguan and the children experienced this niche Great Wall. The time chosen by the hotel is very good. Depart at 9:30 in the morning. It is very close to the scenic spot. Although the climb is hard, it is worth it. I had lunch at the Internet celebrity restaurant at the foot of the Great Wall and went back to the hotel. The pick-up time has passed. The hotel still sent a car to pick it up for free. They also agreed to a late check-out, so that we had time to rest when we were tired from climbing. Overall, it was great Very recommended!

Just outside the hotel are Shifosi Village, Shuiguan Great Wall, and Qinglongqiao Railway Station, where you can visit.

msg:This is the first time I write a negative review, dedicated to the commune at the foot of the Great Wall, pure and innocent, those who have money but no place to spend can choose. To sum it up in one sentence: Five-star charges, an experience worse than that of a homestay. Go for it if you can live with:

1. Hygienic conditions: extremely poor. Please refer to the bedding and tableware in Figure 1 and Figure 2. There are hairs and stains, which are very unbearable.

2. Room type: Terrace and mountain view rooms are arranged on the first floor, with cars parked in front of the door, basically no desire to step out of the balcony, let alone take pictures. There are only two floors in the mountain house, so the possibility of you being arranged on the first floor is very high.

3. Catering: The breakfast restaurant is very small. We waited for a long time for the shuttle bus to pick it up from the farthest place and told us that there was no place to wait. The dining environment is poor, full of children, crowded and noisy. The service of the small kitchen in the commune is even more outrageous. There are no choices in the barren mountains and mountains, but there are two waiters in the small kitchen. They seem to be part-time college students. Outrageous. The uncle next to me has been scolding the manager because of the quality of the food. The manager apologized while talking back. We ate very badly next to us...

4. Internet celebrity check-in: dreaming. The red house and the bamboo house are rented out as a whole, so don't even try to get close to them. They are copied everywhere, just with the word harvest written on them.

5. Others: The swimming pool in the gym is small, dirty, boring at night, and there are no activities.

If there is a negative score, this point will not be given. Right now, I just don't understand why I spent this thousand sixty-seven dollars. Outrageous!

The reference object only recorded one and it was impossible to judge. The building looks like a ******* house at night, creepy, the parking lot of each building is not specially repaired or painted, everyone parks in a mess, the facilities are backward, the room really looks like a house, not the minimalist sense of luxury . There are also a bunch of bugs lying on the glass. What I commend is the breakfast. The taste is okay. The person who looks like a supervisor is checking the quality and whether the signs are clear, and is making small improvements. If you pay attention to the quality, there is hope. Also, the shuttle bus is polite to the little brother, and takes the initiative to give way to the guests' vehicles.

msg:I took my family to live in the commune at the foot of the Great Wall for three days. Six people from three generations of the family rented a forest hut with exactly three bedrooms.
1. Overall experience: It is a rare vacation experience, where you can not only enjoy the nature and beauty of the mountains, but also enjoy the service of the five-star Hyatt Group hotel. This is definitely not comparable to those so-called Internet celebrity homestays. Hyatt's quality is still trustworthy!
2. Hotel environment: The hotel is located in the mountains and forests, with no distance from nature. You can often see little squirrels jumping and walking on the ground and trees, and various birdsong can be heard endlessly.
3. Hotel service: Butler service is very good! Special thanks to the housekeeper Li Yongliang for his warm service. He not only contacted the check-in one day in advance, but also prepared mosquito killer water for us in advance, and reminded us of breakfast time and other information every day. The service is very careful and serious. What's even more rare is that Xiao Li took the trouble to change rooms for us until we were satisfied. We first stayed in Forest Cabin No. 4. Since the three bedrooms were a bit far apart, the children were afraid of being too far away from their parents‚Äô room. Therefore, the housekeeper Xiao Li took us to see Forest Cabin No. 3 and Forest Cabin No. 5. In the end, we chose Forest Cabin No. 5. The three bedrooms are all close together, so the children feel safe. There is a certain distance between the three forest huts, and they need to go uphill and downhill repeatedly, but the housekeeper Li Yongliang worked tirelessly to serve us, running up and down until we were satisfied, he was really dedicated! In addition, the supply of mineral water is sufficient, the fruits provided every day are very fresh, and the cola and soda water in the mini bar are free to enjoy, and the service is very good.
4. Hotel room: The large floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the forest cabin are very beautiful, and the mountain and forest landscape can be seen at a glance. There are two types of rooms in the forest cabin, both of which are three bedrooms, but one is that the three bedrooms are far apart (there is one bedroom on each of the first, second and third floors), and it has invincible large floor-to-ceiling windows, which is great for taking pictures; the other is The three bedrooms are relatively concentrated (one bedroom is on the first floor and two bedrooms are on the second floor), which has a higher sense of security and is suitable for a large family. Although the large floor-to-ceiling windows are not as tall as the previous room type, they are still ok. The fly in the oin**ent is that the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room and the door of the room have no curtains and door curtains. They are all glass, with a good visual landscape, but poor privacy. There is a large dining table in the living room, which is very suitable for the family to chat together, and it feels very warm.
5. Buffet breakfast: There are many types of buffet breakfast, both Chinese and Western, and it can be seen that the quality is still good! In particular, the salads and Chinese cold dishes are very good. The smoked salmon and quinoa salad, cold pork meat, cold jellyfish, etc. are all very delicious. Even the soy milk is very fragrant. The chef's craftsmanship is extraordinary!
6. Hotel parking: You can park directly in front of the forest hut, and there is an open space in front of each small villa for parking, which is very convenient. It's just that they are all on the hillside, and you need to pay attention to safety when driving, parking, and reversing. Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to drive in the hotel by yourself, you can also ask the front desk to arrange a battery car at any time.
7. Surrounding tours: (1) It is 1.8 kilometers away from Shuiguan Great Wall. Because there are few people here, parking is very convenient, and it can almost be parked next to Dengchengkou. There are very few people on the Great Wall. It is almost the same as a private place. The Great Wall is also very steep, and the photos are very good. (2) It takes about 15-20 minutes to drive from the Badaling Great Wall, but there are too many people, so we gave up; (3) Badaling Wildlife Park is next to the Badaling Great Wall. The whole journey is self-driving, and there is no need to walk at all. In addition to seeing lions, tigers, bears and other beasts by car, there are also zebras, giraffes, sika deer, ponies, argali, swans and other animals that can be fed. Children like it very much.
8. Surrounding dining: I tasted two, one is Ji‚Äôs old shop, the cooking is very fast, the taste is good, and the portion is also very large, but the price of lamb chops is a bit high, 288, but the quantity is not so much; the other is Ah Hantai, very authentic Thai food, 150-200 per capita, the signature curry bread crab, Tom Yum soup, barbecue platter, pineapple rice, etc. are all good, and there are alpacas and ducklings in the small yard to play with, and raise alpacas The uncle is very friendly and can let the children play with the alpaca. This is also a homestay, where you can live or just eat.
9. Fly in the oin**ent: (1) After all, it is in the mountains, there are many mosquitoes, so the doors and windows must be closed. The windows are fine, with screens, but don't open and close them frequently, as flying insects will inevitably rush in every time you open and close; especially the door of the living room, flying insects will fly in as soon as the door is opened. (2) The wild Great Wall in the hotel is not allowed to climb, but that's okay. After all, the road to the Wild Great Wall is not easy and unsafe. It is better to go to Shuiguan Great Wall to save worry.

This time we stayed in a room in the third phase. Although it is not as famous as the red house and bamboo house in the second phase, the room is very spacious and has a balcony to enjoy the mountain view. This stay happened to coincide with their cross-country running activities, and I participated in the sports salon reception, which was quite special.

The hotel is located in a natural oxygen bar with lush vegetation, freshness and tranquility. You can fall asleep to the sound of crickets at night and rise to the sound of birdsong in the morning. It is a good place to get close to nature. The room is transparent and bright, the bedroom and living room are reasonably designed, and the movement and quiet are separated. The kitchen is fully equipped, including a refrigerator and stove, which can meet the needs of a family for simple cooking. Butler Chen Xiaoniu's service was attentive and enthusiastic. He reminded us in advance to wear more clothes, distributed menus, entertainment facilities, etc. when he checked in. There were two full plates of fruit and more than a dozen bottles of pure water on the table when he checked in. These were not available last time. The hotel's restaurant has a barbecue buffet and a la carte Chinese food to choose from for lunch and dinner. The restaurant's ingredients are exquisite, the taste is fair, and the price is moderate. If you don‚Äôt want to eat in the hotel, you can also take the hotel shuttle bus to the gate and walk to the nearby Shifo Village to experience the unique local restaurants. The leisure facilities take into account guests of all ages. The elderly can take a walk in the woods, and there is a dedicated amu*****t center for children. All in all, it was a worthwhile experience.

msg:It was the first time I brought my children here to play, and the front desk upgraded the family suite (located in the red house), which is very spacious. The design of the room is very avant-garde, and the public area is large. If the weather is right outside in the afternoon or evening, you can watch the stars on the terrace. There are paid handicraft projects that children can play in the children's commune (painting and origami are free). The hot pot in the set meal is very good, and the two big snacks are just right, so there will be no waste. The surrounding projects that can be visited are Shuiguan Great Wall (very close) and Badaling Wildlife Park (I feel that it is not as well managed as Daxing Wildlife Park).

In addition, the mountains are full of baldness and there is no scenery in winter. In fact, there is really nothing to see or play here. The air conditioner in the room is too hot and dry at night, and it is too cold if it is not turned on.
Fortunately, Zhao Jianying, the housekeeper of the villa, is very responsible, and consciously prepared a long wiring board for us when he knew we wanted to shabu-shabu. That's called premium service and it's great.

msg:I went to the "Commune Hotel at the Foot of the Great Wall", hoping to spend a comfortable weekend here. However, it turned out that my expectations were a little too high. Although the environment here is very good, the yard is huge, and the Hyatt Group has begun to manage it, but there are too many points to complain about. Firstly, when I entered the room, I couldn't believe my eyes when I found the chairs on the table. What the hell is this? Do you want me to climb on the table and sit on the chair? Also, the room was so dry it made me feel like I was in a desert. To make matters worse, the roof was leaking and the roof was wrinkled and weird.

Also, since I was there in low season, the restaurant in the hotel was not open. In short, "Commune Hotel at the Foot of the Great Wall" really disappointed me this time. If you have high requirements for the comfort of the room, you may be a little disappointed. However, if you are only here to enjoy the beauty of nature, then this place can still be considered. However, remember to confirm in advance whether the kitchen and swimming pool are open.

There are fewer utensils in the kitchen, the lighting in the public area is not too bright, and the floor heating is very comfortable, especially in places with carpets, which is very suitable for children to play.

Service: The hotel service is really in place! Special thanks to our housekeeper, Guo Feng, who communicated on the phone the day before check-in and sent information on WeChat. He was very thoughtful in every aspect. After check-in, he helped pick up things, delivered fruits, and checked the room equipment. He was online almost anytime, patient and meticulous. The cleaning lady is also very good, enthusiastic and quick, and responds in a timely manner.

There are a lot of restaurants around. Some of them are not open during the Chinese New Year. You can order takeaways. The hotel breakfast is OK. The bread and snacks are good. There are few Chinese dishes, the taste is average, and there are few types of drinks. Parking is very convenient. You can park at the entrance of the villa. The whole area is closed and managed. There are few people and cars, which is relatively safe.
It's a very good staying experience. When the trees and flowers are luxuriant in spring, I will experience different room types and entertainment items again.

I booked a mountain view double room and upgraded it to a suite. The place I lived in was called a courtyard house, and the room was very warm. While waiting for the room, go to the children's commune to play. There are not many people, there are picture books, paintings, Lego, table football, small ocean ball pool, etc. The room includes a meal of hot pot for two, which is very rich. Before dinner, I climbed the wild Great Wall before the sun went down. There was no one on the way, and the gravel road was not easy to walk. I climbed to the foot of the Great Wall, and the barbed wire fence was very tight, and the wind on the mountain was very strong. After going down the mountain, a hot pot meal was delicious. Play in the sports hall after dinner, there are table tennis, badminton, rowing machine, curling, table football, trampoline, mini football. After breakfast the next day, the children's commune did handwork. The two handicrafts in the morning were free, and the seeds were sent home to plant. The staff member of the children's commune was Sandy Yang Di, who was very patient. In short, it exceeded expectations, the hotel is in the mountains, and the hotel in summer must be more beautiful.

msg:When the Mid-Autumn Festival came, I chose the red house, and I always wanted to see the bamboo house. The eleventh arrangement was arranged and my wish was fulfilled. Those who have seen Chunjiao and Zhiming must be familiar with the bamboo house. The room is more than 400 square meters, with bamboo on all sides. The "tea room" separated by slender bamboo is the finishing touch of the bamboo house. The 5 Japanese-style bedrooms are simple and comfortable, and the living room activity space is separated from the bedroom. You can also book KTV, and it is very pleasant to drink tea and chat with friends in the bamboo house! The scenery of the commune in November is very different from that in September. The autumn is strong, and walking in the drizzle is even more unique. Hotel service is as always meticulous and thoughtful! The housekeeper, Ms. Zhao Jianying, was so considerate. She took the initiative to contact the day before departure to confirm the check-in time, greeted you in the lobby, helped arrange check-in, and responded to any requests. Thank you very much! There are also hotels that provide nucleic acid testing for guests to save time and effort! This time, I still booked the private room of the commune chef, and the food tastes nothing! Come here often. üôÇ

msg:I went to Yanqing on the weekend, took my family for the weekend, and felt a ‚õ∞Ô∏è single-family aesthetic, a commune where cats are at the foot of the Great Wall üí¢

‚ñ∫The choice of this hotel is mainly based on hotel standards, because even a high-end homestay in Yanqing is a farmhouse food, and many supporting facilities are still self-sufficient, so the hotel is the priority when bringing parents, and the commune is also owned by Hyatt.

‚ñ∫‚ÄãThe private collection of contemporary architectural art works designed and built by 12 outstanding Asian architects is also the first architectural work in China to win the "Architectural Art Promotion Award".

‚ñ∫The concept of the commune is to let the residents not stay in standard hotel-style rooms, but find inspiration in the spacious artistic a**osphere public area, and share it with friends and family, so the public area is designed with a unique style.

‚ñ∫üè† ‚Äñ Bamboo House ‚Äñ Red House ‚Äñ Forest Xiao Wu ‚Äñ Datong Pu ‚Äñ Mountain House and other 36 villas with 160+ guest rooms, the different scenery throughout the year can be seen in the combination of space. I set up a mountain house, a white building with a quiet wind inside. The two-bedroom is very simple, and there is an old house downstairs, which has the feeling of being hidden in the city.

In fact, what I like most here is the quiet, secluded feeling.

‚ñ∫Mealsü•ò‚ÄñBreakfast is the star standard selected by Hyatt, and dinner is a commune chef featuring a small hot pot. And the drinks in the lobby bar are not expensive. I chose 588's special hot pot package. The bottoms of the pots were all airlifted from Chengdu. There are many varieties and rich ingredients. If you don't eat hot pot, you can order separately, and roast duck must be reserved in advance.

‚ñ∫ParkingüÖøÔ∏è‚ÄñThe car can be driven to the door of the villa you booked, or you can be picked up by the shuttle bus.

‚ñ∫Location ‚ÄñThe foot of the Great Wall of Shuiguan‚õ∞Ô∏è is at Exit G53 of Badaling Expressway, 70 minutes by car in downtown Beijingüï∞Ô∏è

‚ñ∫Price ‚Äñ It is actually very good to engage in activities. There is also a hot pot package for 1,000 per person for two days and one night. You can experience everything you can experience. If you want to exercise, you can also go to the comprehensive sports ground. You can play shuffleboard, badminton, and small trampoline indoors. Treadmill, a variety of accessories.

‚ñ∫Temperature ‚Äñ The temperature in the room is very warm, but outside in late autumn, it will be a little cold in the morning and evening, the leaves are swirling, and the air is particularly good. The snow scene in winter should be good.

Climbing the Great Wall in the hotel before sunset... Tips need perseverance... Haha... It's really the way to climb the wild Great Wall... The speed of going up the mountain should be at least half an hour+... But the sunset is absolutely amazing... Although I was paralyzed for two after the end God... so tired haha...
The breakfast on the second day was also very rich... Gong Commune has regular exhibitions. It's good to walk around after dinner... Look at the buildings... It's also a pleasure...
Thanks to our housekeeper Li Jianming jay for his caring...everything is meticulous...
If there is a chance, I will play again~

The crazy premium price of Beijing hotels on the National Day holiday makes me feel that the price spent does not match the hotel hardware. The mountain view room I live in is good in size, with a simple style, which makes people feel simple and a little shabby. I don't understand that the National Day does not allow a single order to only have a set menu. We have all spent several times the price to enjoy it. Shouldn't we provide better service? busy! It's not the hotel's reason, the hotel should find a way to overcome and give customers a better experience! ! ! The environment is good, located in the valley, the valley is quiet, and the heart is relaxed and happy. The meaning of travel is to let you purify your mind and precipitate impetuous emotions in the tedious life. Not only adults are also very good for children, I hope the hotel can complete more children's projects, instead of blindly charging, after all, the confusion of not being able to go to Beijing in the future, there are attractive projects that will open up a bigger market for you. Overall is good, will choose in the future. Hope the hotel gets better and better

msg:The hotel is not far from the city, and it takes less than an hour to drive outside the North Fifth Ring Road. The hotel is very distinctive, built on the mountain, and each villa is very special. You can also drive directly there, just park in an open space. You can also take the hotel shuttle bus.

The biggest surprise of the stay is the climbing Ye Great Wall. Located at the airport, the car can be parked nearby. It takes about 15 minutes to climb to the entrance of the Great Wall. The mountain road is still steep, and the last section is a little slippery. The Great Wall is very long and has not been completed, but the scenery is very good, and there are not many people, highly recommended!

The hotel breakfast is ok, with many varieties and taste. Although it is written that children over 6 years old need to pay half price, but the waiter did not ask the child's age during the meal, which was not strictly controlled.

The children's commune is free to play, just opposite the lobby, a two-story villa. On the first floor, there are picture book rooms, crafting areas (paid), and Lego puzzles. On the second floor, there are ocean balls and large building blocks.

There is a restaurant in the hotel, and you can also eat outside. There are some homestays and restaurants outside the hotel, and there are also good reviews.

The most distinctive bamboo houses and red houses in the hotel can only be reserved for the whole building on Ctrip; if I asked the front desk if there are rooms in the off-season or during the week, they will also be allocated to individual guests.

We arrived at three o'clock and said that in order to give us a good view of the red house, we have to wait for cleaning. So we moved to the Children's Commune to play for a while, and within half an hour the room was ready, and we moved in smoothly. The one with pictures and facts, the red house is so beautiful, I think this building should be a group of familiar people living together, with a large living room and a large dining table. Not only suitable for families, but also very suitable for group building.
By the way, to answer a few questions: the breakfast is not many but the taste is ok. It is very suitable for bringing children to experience the outdoors, but they should stay for a few more days. The parking lot is not big, and there are charging piles. The nearest nucleic acid is about 20 minutes away by car.

He helped arrange dinner. When the car entered the park, he was greeted by the roadside and guided us to check in. When we arrived at 3:30, we checked in quickly and gave Mid-Autumn Mooncakes. Then I went to climb the Wild Great Wall of the hotel. There were few people in Jingmei, and I also encountered several squirrels. The road is indeed difficult to walk, but standing on the top and watching the sunset, I think it is worth it. Came back just in time for dinner, and received champagne from the housekeeper to add to the fun, as well as abundant fruit. Roast duck and squirrel mandarin fish are especially delicious. The terrace of the restaurant faces a section of the Great Wall, and the sunset is beautiful. A happy tour around, there will be a chance to come again.

About catering: The entire catering system of the hotel is extremely sound. Hyatt products must be high-quality products. Among them, the eggs Benedict for breakfast is delicious and the most impressive. On weekends and holidays, there will be an outdoor BBQ and a band, which is very sensual. There is afternoon tea, and there are many options for picnic baskets.
What about playing? There is a Great Wall in the hotel that you can climb, and you can enjoy the Great Wall alone when you travel off-peak! The activities of the Children's Commune are also very rich, such as handmade DIY, archery, and a small animation theater. There is also an indoor sports hall with a large space of several hundred square meters, where you can play badminton, table tennis, and curling. In short, my itinerary for two days and one night was fully arranged.

There are basically no people. The room facilities are simple, extremely simple, but sufficient. Hotel shuttle service is good. There are not many people for dinner in the hotel. It is good to have a viewing platform. Sitting by the window has a good view. The children's club can store children. The children made handmade coasters. Candy Yang, the service, is very patient, not bad

msg:A very good experience. Located at the foot of the Great Wall, it is like walking in a forest park. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and reasonable, especially the front office manager Sara Cheng, who encountered a little problem during check-in and immediately solved it. The hotel's restaurant is moderately priced and tastes good. There are many shuttle buses in the park, and you can call for a shuttle whenever you feel tired. The disadvantage is that there are too few signs in the park, and they are not obvious, and there is no obvious sign in the reception hall. Although there are street signs in the building where I live, the color is gray and the font is very small. The car drove by without noticing. In addition, it would be nice to have more parent-child facilities.

The fly in the oin**ent is a female customer service at the front desk. I told her that the nucleic acid situation I consulted before was wrong. I can give them a new and correct nucleic acid situation, but she just said that it was the new employee who made a mistake. She also didn't ask me to give her the nucleic acid point information, so wouldn't someone make a mistake? What's more, it's too unreasonable for a five-star hotel to push mistakes to new employees. Hope to improve it. The rest are very satisfied.

The housekeeper, Sandy Yang Di, has a very good attitude, and the problems reported can be dealt with in a timely manner, which is very good. We originally booked a forest cabin, but before we arrived at the store, they told us to upgrade to a red house. As a result, after checking in, we found that the air conditioner in the red house was leaking and not cooling, and the light in the room was not good, and the kettle could not be used. After the air conditioning refrigeration was quickly solved, the kettle was also repaired. I came back from dinner at the restaurant at night because the road was too dark and the signage was too dark to find the house. The red house we live in is in the middle of the woods. There are many steps at the door, and the lights are very dim. As a result, I stepped on the air and fell. Fortunately, it was only scratched and it was fine. The next day we finally stayed in the forest hut. We felt very good, the room was bright and clean, the bedding was very comfortable, and we were also given fruit, which was very satisfying.

msg:The environment is really good, returning to nature, and both roads and facilities within the commune have a sense of design.
There are so many bugs in the summer...the two-bedroom suite in the mountain house 2, maybe the last resident did not listen to the persuasion, opened the doors and windows, and there were big moths and flying insects in the house. The mountain house has a simple style, and the economy is a bit beyond my imagination. If you want to find a warm feeling in the room, it is recommended to choose other styles of rooms.
Not much to say about the environment, just look at the photos.
In terms of catering, there is a BBQ buffet for dinner and a buffet for breakfast. The overall feeling is that the breakfast is better. There was a team building team of 20 or 30 people for dinner, which affected the overall experience a lot. The hotel did some active care (delivering barbecue to the table, asking about the situation, etc.), but the improvement of the dining experience was limited. I think the breakfast is good. On the one hand, the group built during the breakfast period did not drink and make a fuss. On the other hand, it was because the choice of breakfast was richer than that of dinner, and the quality was also good. Recommend toast with soft omelette, croissant and freshly squeezed juice.

Although it has always been under the banner of a design award, the hotel's building can only be seen from the outside, and the hardware inside can be described as a house with bare walls. The air conditioner in the room leaked and flooded the entire bedroom. I moved to another room without even a hair dryer or remote control. The service is hard to say enough. The five-star price is a good experience, and it has the worst reviews among the hotels I have ever stayed in. There are many B&Bs near the hotel, and the environment is also good. If I have eaten there, at least the service is good. I don‚Äôt recommend coming to this place to be taken advantage of. I will stay away from Hyatt hotels from now on.

3) Ringing the doorbell in the morning should not try to force a break in
4) There are flying insects in Wagyu noodles
5) The corridor is reluctant to turn on the lights, like a ******* house
6) Reluctant to give drinking water, claiming that it is free within 4 bottles
7) There are countless excuses, "I don't know how to fix the TV" "I live alone, I have to go back alone when it gets dark" "I'm new here"
8) Bamboo house check-in point, turned into an isolation room

Overall: impersonal, weak sense of service, lived in almost all the high-quality homestays and hotels in the suburbs of Beijing, and the selection of Hyatt is the worst, no one. Ps: The communication with the hotel is still very disappointing. No effective measures have been given to make up for the loss. It is forcibly presupposed that I will come to stay next time. real.

The service has indeed improved significantly compared to before, and the service attitude is much better. In the past few years, I was a little ignorant. All the staff here are very friendly, smiling and greeting. Butler service is provided. During the epidemic, breakfast was delivered to the room, which was very attentive. However, the process and connection details still need to be improved. There are few cleaning staff, check-in is basically after 2 o'clock, we check in at 3 o'clock. Design buildings and the Great Wall are definitely not to be missed selling points. The pink part of the map is the original award-winning building. The hotel is a post-renovation. It is recommended to take a look. There is a mountain road in the middle to climb to the Great Wall. It is recommended to bring hiking shoes, climb the mountain to exercise, and the beauty of the Great Wall is really refreshing. In short, the commune is different from a homestay or hotel, and has a different experience, which is worth visiting.

It is worth improving that the barrier-free facilities are insufficient and a little inconvenient,
The biggest disadvantage is the restaurant. The environment is very good, but it is expensive and not delicious. At most, you can drink afternoon tea. For dinner, it is recommended to drive to the village for a while to eat.

msg:üè®Hotel environment: The commune at the foot of the Great Wall is quite good as a whole. It is now managed by Hyatt Regency and designed and built by 12 famous architects in Asia. It is also one of the "Top 10 New Architectural Miracles in China". The hotel is at the foot of the Changping Shuiguan Great Wall. It is very convenient to drive from the city and take the Beijing-Tibet Expressway out of the Shuiguan exit. The hotel area is very large, with 42 villas, 4 restaurants, 1 indoor sports field, 1 kids club, etc., suitable for family vacation and team building.

üõèRoom facilities: Each villa can be called the Museum of Architecture and Art - Forest Cabin, Datongpu, Bamboo House, Red House, Siheyuan...each with its own characteristics. The interior is bright and spacious, fully furnished and well maintained. Pantry has refrigerators, sofas, tables, and high stools. Everyone can eat and chat here. The room is decorated in a simple style, and the big bed is very large, enough for a family of three to sleep. The mini bar also has capsule coffee and mineral water, which are provided free of charge.

üçΩFood recommendation: The restaurant in the hotel is very good. The breakfast is rich in variety and delicious. The freshly made noodles and cakes are very delicious. The commune chef in the hotel specializes in Beijing cuisine, the ingredients are fresh, the taste is good, and the price is small but acceptable.

üëçMost recommended: The hotel staff have a friendly attitude, take the initiative to help with luggage and give directions, and the check-in and check-out procedures are very fast. The staff at the front desk are very friendly, and the warm and meticulous service made us feel at home.

üìùNote: The hotel has a private Great Wall. There is a small road next to the villa airport. Walk up for 20 minutes to the end of the Shuiguan Great Wall. The mountain road is steep, friends who climb the Great Wall remember to wear sneakers. Free parking at the hotel, the parking lot is quite large. The hotel is very popular, friends who go on holidays should book as early as possible.

The security guard at the door is very responsible for scanning the health treasure, taking the temperature, and registering the information. After entering, it feels like entering a super oxygen bar! Green trees, pretty flowers, all kinds of houses! In a great mood! Here is a review of the hotel from four points: 1. The environment is very good and suitable for relaxation. 2. As a luxury hotel, the facilities are old (the key is that the daily maintenance is not good enough or not carefully). For example, the T feet in the corners have fallen off. Although it is a small problem, it can be seen that the customer service inspection is not careful enough, and the towels in the bathroom are soft after washing for too long. And the towels still have bleaching powder that has not been washed in use! 3. The overall hygiene is very clean. 4. Each service staff who is the most critical to the service is very enthusiastic and timely to deal with our problems. Personally, I have two suggestions: 1. It is suggested that the restaurant service staff should unify their shoes, and each person wears their own shoes of different styles to lower the grade of the entire hotel. 2. There should be a dedicated service staff in the sports center (which can prevent the guests from causing damage to the use of supplies, and can also better help the guests find supplies). Finally, I would like to praise the variety of breakfast in the restaurant, the dishes are fresh, clean and taste better! Generally speaking, I will try to stay for a few more days when I come back next timeü•∞üí™

If you want to go to Ctrip, you can choose a good choice~~ We are a big bed room this time, and the design of the bamboo house is also the one in the movie that year. Scene, get up through the window, see the sun and bamboo, very fresh and warm in the morning, it is worth recommending. From the inner road of the hotel, you can climb directly to the Great Wall, and you can take a look at the landscape. The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant. There is an open-air BBQ in the evening. Although there are not many varieties, you can eat enough. Haha, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are good and taste very good. it is good.

In summer, the signs of each house are not very clear, and the flowers and plants are very high, which will cover up. If you drive in from the lobby, the road signs and house signs are worth improving.

msg:There is no trouble that cannot be solved by being close to nature. This Dragon Boat Festival, which cannot travel far, deliberately chose to live in a forest cabin. The sister at the front desk was quick and quick, and completed the cumbersome scanning and other check-in procedures for our group in five minutes. It was not the first time for many people to come to the commune and they were familiar with the terrain, so they didn't take the hotel shuttle bus and arrived at the villa soon. This is a half villa with yellow and white as the main color (independent entry and exit). Such a simple and clean design makes the outdoor green that enters the eye through the floor-to-ceiling glass more and more seductive! Isn't that the feeling of being in the forest that I'm looking for? Opening the window, a scent wafts into the nostrils, which is very comfortable. This is the smell of martin. Unlike the low lilac trees that we commonly see in the city in April, their flowers bloom later than those of purple and white lilacs. They bloom from mid-late May to early June, with yellow and white flowers. Near the roadside, the typhoon martinis is as tall as a tree, while those on the hillside in the distance are clusters of yellow and white. I had a whim: Did the designer of this forest cabin, Makoto Furuya, come here this season 20 years ago, and did these violent martin fragrances inspire him to design the "forest cabin"? Beijing is one of the places of origin of the martin incense. Badaling Forest Park, not far from the commune, has the largest natural martin incense forest in China.

The afternoon tea prepared by the housekeeper JAY (Li Jianmin) was packaged in a "thick book" and placed on the table in the living room. The food and drink during the stay were all thanks to JAY's enthusiastic guidance. Thank you very much. There is little light pollution in the mountains, and when I was having dinner outside that day, the crooked moon and the clear Big Dipper star were just above my head, which I could hardly see in the city. With the smell of the forest found in the commune, go back to the city to reminisce.

msg:There are three reasons for staying in the commune for the Dragon Boat Festival, the distance is suitable, the reputation is relatively large, and the experience is fresh. After checking in, there are three things that impressed me more deeply. One is the Wild Great Wall in the park. It is said that it is the Wild Great Wall, but it is not the Great Wall Wild, but the mountain climbing road to the Great Wall has not been artificially modified, and basically retains its original state, so don't have an experience. The second is an open-air barbecue for dinner. The style and category of the barbecue are quite satisfactory. Since we happened to catch up with the changeable weather in the mountains and encountered a thunderstorm, in this case, the person in charge of the open-air barbecue or the head chef (the details are not clear) and two barbecue staff It has added warmth to this rainy barbecue in early summer for us. Third, I would like to thank Feng Xinlan Quella, the front desk manager of the hotel. Due to the staged victory in epidemic prevention and control, and the reopening of suburban hotels and homestays, people's yearning for nature has been released at this moment, and the commune rooms are full. It is against this background that there are many things that need to be coordinated in the commune, such as accommodation, catering, and entertainment. As the docking staff of our trip, Manager Feng has thoughtful and thoughtful service, reflecting the overall service concept and hospitality of the commune from one point. I would like to express my gratitude here.

msg:üöó Transportation: We went from Shunyi, which is quite convenient and easy to find. Contact and check in. It will be more convenient to park the car in front of the door of your own type of accommodation. You don't need to park in the hotel's parking lot for check-in.
üçÉEnvironment: I just want to talk about the external environment, deep in the mountains, big oxygen bar, birds and flowers, nothing to say, maybe the epidemic is related, the occupancy rate is not very high, it seems a little quiet

üîîService: Seriously, I have chosen the commune for a long time and decided on the May 1st trip because it is a Hyatt brand after all. I feel that there is still a gap between the brand and the boutique B&B. After all, the brand is guaranteed. In other words, this hotel has brought so much to my sister and my family, which is incredible and far worse than I imagined. The service is not reflected at the star level. Very enthusiastic) On the road, we met the staff face-to-face and did not say hello. We wanted to say hello and were embarrassed to turn our heads and pretended to look at the mobile phone to send us to the room. In the evening, because of the room problem, another service boy who drove a Buick did not remember if it was the same person. He pulled us three times at night to see the room and there was nothing to say. In the middle of the night, we carried our luggage and pulled the child with him. Ignore the whole process and tell us which room to leave after leaving. The service is really bad. It is completely asymmetrical with the star hotel. Now it is estimated that the snack shop still knows to ask.

üßπ Hygiene: Why is hygiene the last thing? Because this is the fatal problem of our short trip here. At that time, we saw that the hotel asked to check in after 16:00, so we deliberately departed from Shunyi late and arrived at about 17:00. When we checked in, we arrived with the staff to our mountain house terrace twin room. We booked two rooms of the same type, four four and two. This room type was not big because there was no good choice at the time of booking. The floor of the room is a little sticky and the shoes will be slightly sticked when you step on it. It's not a serious problem. I don't think it's a big problem, so I don't take it too seriously. Then we went out to the hotel and just turned around. We took our food back to the room and ate after nine o‚Äôclock. We all had to pay attention that the child was going to take a bath. I was going to rinse the bathtub for him so that I could bathe the child. After entering, I smelled the smell of urine in the toilet. At the time, I thought it was an anti-smell from the floor drain. After several times of entering, it will become more and more serious. The traces around the hot tub will become more and more obvious as the hot water evaporates. Figure 1-2 If there is no water The smell is not very clear, and the unpleasant smell is stronger. I searched carefully and found that the bottom of the bathtub is two directions away from the toilet. That is, there are a lot of stains in Figure 3. I am not sure if it is urine, but the smell is really big. The female manager on duty also smelled it, and she also said that it smelled really strong. To be honest, I was so disgusted at the time that I sent a message to my sister about the situation in our room. My sister checked the bathroom of her room and found in the bathtub of her room. Picture 8 My sister is The super short-haired brother-in-law and nephew did not have long hair. The hygiene made us unbelievable. After communicating with the female duty manager who came to inquire, she said that she would change rooms for us. We changed our clothes and packed our luggage. The male waiter from Buick Business came to pick us up and took us to another room type, which is the bamboo house here. The waiter came to change rooms and explained that the waiter did not offer to help with luggage during the whole process. The child was also carrying things. He couldn‚Äôt see it. He only took care of himself and led the way in front of the door. After opening the door, he left the room without a word. The room is next to each other because it is a suite converted from tatami. The room is not much smaller than our original room. It can be said that we go to bed when we enter the door, and the room is very depressing. The most important thing is that we were thrown in in the middle of the night and no one asked us if we were satisfied or not. Dissatisfied with the two rooms, one has a bathtub and the other does not. For many reasons, my brother-in-law called the hotel again and asked the hotel to give an explanation. The female duty manager told us just now that she was busy with other work and ignored her. She asked us to change the room again and was waiting. When I was a waiter, I saw Figure 5 next to the pool in the living room of the bamboo house. This is really hygienic and it is a Buick business. Pulled us to the room type called Siheyuan. After entering, I went straight to the bathroom and toilet and found a lot of hair. Figure 6 The female duty manager who came with me this time has nothing to say. At this time, I am really tired and exhausted. We were so sleepy that we communicated with the manager and she promised to find a waiter for us to clean it up thoroughly. We won't be changing the waiter. I just flushed the bathroom with some disinfectant and it's not at all good for deep cleaning because it's too late and I don't want to mess around. It‚Äôs so fulfilling for everyone to rest after 0:00. I stayed in the hotel for one night. There are three types of rooms in each room. It‚Äôs really weird. I don‚Äôt know if we are lucky or sad. How else can we survive? Isn't health service the foundation of a hotel? These two points are gone. How should the hotel survive? Should the hotel management summarize whether there are problems in your management? Can't you see so many problems? Compared with hotels of the same brand and hotels of the same grade, you are not comparable at all!

msg:The commune at the foot of the Great Wall takes about an hour and a half to drive from the city. I went there for a meal several years ago. At that time, it was still managed by Kempinski, developed by soho China, and was famous for its background built by 12 Asian architects, many of whom For Kengo Kuma, Shigeru Ban, Andong and other architects. Now the hotel is managed by hyatt, only a few of the original 12 villas can be rented. Generally, tourists who choose independent room types will stay in several villa room types reproduced by the hotel.
As far as the check-in experience is concerned, I think the red house will be slightly better, although there are still problems such as poor sound insulation, small room size, and facilities that are slightly inferior to hotels of the same price. Overall, the service still maintains the standard of the Hyatt Group. It is more convenient to walk, drive or hotel shuttle bus from different villas. Compared with going alone, the hotel is indeed more suitable for renting a building with relatives and friends to play with.
Although it is a pity that the various buildings in the original villa area were not maintained in time, but when you look at them carefully, no matter how the buildings are adapted to local conditions and the materials used, it is worth exploring and playing. This time, I mainly took pictures. For houses and bamboo houses, I was pleasantly surprised by the light and shadow reflected on the walls when the sunlight was good. In addition, the hotel also has a section of the Wild Great Wall (the road up the mountain is quite trembling, it is best to wear sports shoes) for tourists to enjoy alone. It is recommended to climb it in the evening and be in a daze. There are also three options for dining at the hotel in the evening, including barbecue buffet, hot pot set, and a la carte, or you can drive to a nearby farmhouse to experience it.
Overall, recommend to visit. Finally, I remind you that if you want to live in the room type you want, you should confirm with the hotel at least one day in advance to ensure that you will not be disappointed with the room type.

Waiting for cleaning until more than 4 o'clock, dinner and breakfast are obviously more difficult.

The view from the mountain view room was not as good as expected. Walking inside the hotel, there are no pedestrian paths, and it is very unsafe for cars to come and go. There is also no Room service. Failed to understand the design style. Wild Great Wall is still good. The service is also basically satisfactory.

msg:A well-known architectural art project, the most famous buildings have copied several buildings for hotel operation, scattered all the way in the valley, neither crowded nor too sparse and desolate, and each building has rooms with good views.
It is worthwhile to go on a snowy day. It is especially suitable for people who both yearn for mountain life and have requirements for comfort (those who pursue luxury facilities and the convenience of business circles, please detour).
Heavy snow + Valentine's Day + the fifteenth day of the first ***** month, full of guests.
The huge park + scattered villa rooms + difficult ice and snow roads affected the efficiency of communication and shuttle bus transportation of guests. It took a little while to check in, but the front desk staff have been actively communicating and coordinating, and it is difficult for them.
Some people say that the service is not satisfactory, but I personally think it is not bad. It was full of guests on a snowy day, and the previous wave of guests who did not check out in time due to bad road conditions. It is not easy to handle such a special situation, not to mention the layout of this hotel. It is really special. It is not in an overall building, and the service method is different from that of hotels in the city. It is even more impossible to say that Cao Cao and Cao Cao are here 100%.
I stayed for two days and called the shuttle twice, but they were all picked up in time, and the handsome driver had a very good attitude. No matter how slippery the road was, I would try to deliver it to the door as much as possible.
The breakfast is relatively rich, located in the mountainous area, but the materials and products are not suitable at all, and the replenishment is also very timely.
There are two restaurants for dinner, one is a Chinese dinner, and the other looks like a small hot pot. The Chinese dishes are very decent, and the golden hook cabbage is also delicious!
In short, it is a relatively satisfying and surprising trip, and it is worth visiting in every season.

The hotel room is very spacious, suitable for families with children. There are many hot pot dishes for two people, and we have enough snacks for the two of us.

In the valley, various styles of buildings are dotted, and it is just right not to feel abrupt. It rained lightly at night, and the moment I opened the door in the morning, the sweet air made me decide to come again! Living in a bamboo house, the room is clean and warm, the public space is very large, chatting, eating and drinking tea are very comfortable. The unique wild Great Wall adds points to the hotel. The only downside is that there are too few service staff and the wait for check-in is too long.

It is relatively close, and it will take more than an hour to arrive.
Exceeded expectations, with a large footprint. The architectural style is quite simple and generous, with mountains and trees in and out of the windows. Different themes have different intervals, and parking is very convenient.
Taking the children to run around the mountains, there is only a section of dew on the Great Wall, and a section of the Great Wall. It's worth going again, until the mountains are full of flowers and trees are shady.

msg:The Ctrip group purchased 2 nights, which is much cheaper than direct booking. The two families spent a pleasant weekend together. The off-season experience is really good. The red house is very big and beautiful. It is recommended to rent a house. Ctrip customer service Xiaolu and hotel duty manager Feng Xinlan have never checked in and have been following up and coordinating until the problem is solved. I really appreciate it; after the epidemic has passed, the tourism industry will recover, if Ctrip customer service has always had such a follow-up speed and attitude, it would be good; the hotel From the introduction of the house to the communication and reservation, Xiao Feng was very moved. After moving in, she did not hesitate to contact her and actively coordinated. If the group purchase price is considered, the hotel as a whole must be matched and the price-performance ratio is super high, but if it is based on the hotel positioning (calculated according to the daily price), there are indeed many areas that can be improved.
Booking: Ctrip and the hotel connection problem is relatively big, many dates can not be selected when booking, but both sides said that they have no problem, they have a room, they have done the corresponding operations, and have given feedback to the other party, but the problem cannot be solved. After a day of playing football, the problem was not resolved in the end, and Ctrip's customer complaint department intervened to give a compromise solution. Although the results of this stay are acceptable, if the hotel has Ctrip related promotions, it is expected that this problem will continue to occur. In addition, the weekend orders bought by a friend were always displayed as weekday orders when checking in and leaving the store, so they asked to make up the difference. After explaining, the front desk said it was ok, and it could be solved internally, but it took time and a problem recurred, so there must be a problem internally.
Management: From booking to check-in, the overall feeling will be a bit chaotic, problems cannot be followed up, and the overall front desk and telephone customer service lack enthusiasm. For example, I have stayed for one night. Because I had children and drove to breakfast the next morning, I came back and found that the parking space under the house was occupied. I left a message to the front desk and asked the owner to move the car. There has been no reply since then, which has also caused the residents on both sides. Inconvenience and misunderstanding, both sides are wronged. The guest occupying the parking space said that the hotel asked others to park downstairs. Obviously, there is a problem with the internal management of the hotel. Some people stay and let parking, which is a big problem). In addition, I checked in on Friday and left the store on Sunday. On Saturday, my aunt came to deliver water at 4 pm. I was really thirsty and could not contact the front desk to deliver water in the morning. It took more than an hour for my aunt to deliver it. I really felt that there was not enough manpower.
Check-in and check-out: check in at 4:00 pm, check out at 12:00 noon, deduct to sleep, if you only stay for one night, you will be in a hurry. Each house is cleaned by one auntie. The workload is really heavy. We cleaned up the kitchen, and the auntie cleaned up for a long time. If there are enough cleaning equipment, we can check in earlier in the afternoon. Or open a few more houses, and you don't have to wait for the previous one to be cleaned before you can move in (but it seems that the hotel will not do this from a cost perspective). But it is true that this check-in time is the slot of most people.
Room: Open the door and close the door, the lights in the room are all on, this is the biggest bug in the world. When children take a nap, adults can‚Äôt lock the door when they leave. Once the door is locked, the lights are all on, so they can only cover the door. When they get up early to go out to exercise, when the door is closed, the teammates in the room just want to beat people. Not to mention that the whole village tripped when it was raining at four o'clock in the morning, and the lights of the whole house were switched on and off n times, thinking it was *******... The whole room didn't sleep well. Feedback to the front desk, the front desk has no solution except apologizing and expressing that there is no way. The overall decoration is also a little old, and the lights on the wardrobe door are also a little too bright. The lights turn on as soon as the door is opened, which is really not very friendly to those with babies.
Public facilities: Check in on Friday, feel good on Saturday morning, there are not many people; it will not work on Sunday, there are a lot of people eating breakfast and sports venues, and the breakfast supply will not keep up with it. Gone. In the sports venues, the shooting machine is broken, the badminton is basically short of hair, and the table tennis and curling are slightly more intact. The children's hall is quite large, and it may be off-season. There are few things to play, and the small kitchen is put away. On the second floor, only the ocean ball pool can be played. The advantage is that there are fewer people. The gym is a bit smaller than the average hotel and has less equipment. Climbing the Great Wall should be a sport that many people want to participate in. I saw trekking poles at the front desk. I don‚Äôt know if they can be rented for free. The branches picked up on the road climb the mountain.
Overall: The flaws do not hide the flaws. I will continue to live if there are promotions. After all, the house is really big and beautiful, and it is much better than the general folk experience. I hope to have a better experience next time.

msg:The commune at the foot of the Great Wall has been planting grass for many years. I personally like the place where I spend my time on the design, but I have been busy and didn't bother to experience it. Now that I have a child, I have a headache every weekend about where to go to play, so I completed this experience logically. Let's talk about traffic first, not far from the Beijing-Tibet Expressway, the overall traffic is fairly smooth. Besides the park, the entire independent park, even if the rooms are fully booked, the park will not appear crowded, after all, the park is too big. The most worth mentioning is the design, whether it is a mountain view, a lobby or a room, it can be said to be one step at a time, which is quite stylish. Speaking of service, I caught up with the on-duty manager Feng Xinlan when we checked in. He patiently explained the layout and facilities of the park with a map, and added WeChat. All questions and needs were responded to in a timely manner, and the experience was very good. This time we stayed in the farmhouse, and next time we must experience the red house or the bamboo house.

msg:The long-known place is finally here. I have to say that seeing a hundred things is better than seeing them. First of all, the price is actually good for the price. Of course, it may be because the off-season is not expensive~
Secondly, the hotel room is not bad. I stayed in the red house this time. The public area inside is very large and well-decorated. The child runs upstairs and downstairs happily. The environment in the room is also very good. The only regret is that there is no bathtub~
Thirdly, let‚Äôs talk about the overall situation of the hotel. There is a children‚Äôs commune, but it is relatively young and there are not many facilities. It is more similar to the regional activities of kindergartens. The hotel has a sports room. The advantage is that it is free, but the disadvantage is that the venue is not large. I can play badminton (1 field), table tennis (2 cases), curling (1 field) and basketball, etc. This time I went there because there were not many people, so I had a lot of fun. Going up~ Because it is winter, the swimming pool and water park are not open, I don‚Äôt know how it is~
Fourth, let‚Äôs talk about food and beverages. There is a Chinese restaurant. To be honest, it‚Äôs not very good. The food is expensive and the taste is very ordinary. However, considering that after all, it‚Äôs not easy to make a good meal in the deep mountains.
Fifth, let's talk about the surrounding environment of the hotel. The hotel is located in the Shuiguan Great Wall. There is a mountain road in the hotel that can go directly to the Great Wall. This must be praised. First of all, the distance is appropriate. The mountain road takes about 20 minutes. There is a great beacon tower on the Great Wall that can be climbed up. It is especially suitable for children to play. It will not be boring like climbing stairs, and it will not be too difficult. The long journey is too long and tiring. This time it is more interesting to catch up with the snow on the mountain. Both children and adults have a great time!
Finally, let's talk about the service of the hotel. This is really good and worthy of the Hyatt brand. The shuttle bus is very convenient on call, and the attitude is excellent! The lady at the front desk of the hotel is also very gentle and polite. Miss Heffner who checked out and Miss Olivier wang who gave me directions during check-in are all very nice, thank you very much!
In short, the overall feeling of staying in is very good, and the children also have a great time, it is a worthwhile trip!

Although I came here because of the famous name, I didn't do much strategy before, so I didn't ask for the room type, and I was not satisfied after I stayed in the farmhouse. The lady at the front desk was very friendly and replaced us with a characteristic bamboo house. The bamboo house has a large shared space, simple and clean, and a good place to take pictures. The room is tatami, which is very comfortable.
The inside of the hotel can directly lead to a section of the Great Wall. Although the Great Wall is very short, the mountain road up is a bit steep and interesting.
The overall experience is great. If you have to find something insufficient, it is that there are not many dining options, especially the hot pot set for dinner, which is relatively cheap and tastes average.

The room is minimalist, clean and neat, with few doors, sockets, and trash cans.
The door I live in is not tight, other rooms will be closed or there will be wind, etc.
The big bed is very cool. It's very comfortable to lie down without moving. The ball is over as soon as I turn over. It's loud, and the sound of the quilt is so loud, I was stunned!
In winter, it really feels like a wild country, and I can't see the sense of design. The environment in spring and autumn should be much more beautiful.
There are quite a lot of squirrels. If you want to take a closer look, you can put a nut on the balcony to attract them.
The service is very good, I live far away, and I have to take a ferry to get in and out. It usually takes about 5-10 minutes to get there. The shuttle bus is a 7-seater like the Buick commercial vehicle, which is very good.
The Great Wall is really wild, and the road up the mountain is not easy to walk. It takes about 20 minutes to reach the foot of the Great Wall. The time is not long, but it is quite steep. It is more difficult to go down the mountain. The old man should do what he can.
There are not many varieties of breakfast buffet, you can eat enough.
The price of ordering is a little expensive, about 160 per person. There are also hot pot double packages 488, 688, general. Still a decent meal.
Maybe there are few staff during the New Year, the restaurant is a bit chaotic, the serving is also very slow, and the dishes are missed. The waiter's attitude is very good, but she is too busy, so she even served a dish later.

msg:In the standard room of Mountain House 2, the room needs to be picked up from the lobby. Because of the reason of staying in winter, it is very cold and there are not many outdoor activities. It is very convenient and fast to pick up a taxi. There are two restaurants in the commune, one is a self-service hot pot (set meal), and the second floor is an ordering mode. The price of the dishes is medium and above, and the squirrel mandarin fish is a little expensive, but the taste is very good, worthy of the style of Hyatt. The room is simple and generous. Spring is very suitable for spring.

The two villas have their own characteristics. I prefer the style and feel of the bamboo house. In the afternoon, I enjoy the hall alone, reading books and drinking tea. It is quiet and spacious, and the warm sun and bamboo shadows make it comfortable and relaxing.
When the weather is good, there is a small section of the Great Wall next to the hotel where you can climb up and look into the distance.

msg:It feels like it used to be a clubhouse for real estate developers, but now it has been changed to a homestay in the suburbs of Beijing. The hotel comes with a section of the Wild Great Wall, which is the kind of path in the mountains. It only takes an hour to climb back and forth. Maybe Hyatt has not taken over for a long time, and there is still a lot of room for improvement in service. Catch up on the holidays and live in a farmhouse in the room of Xiaosanqian, and the IQ tax accounts for a large proportion. But under the epidemic, there is no choice, and it is very helpless.

msg:I stayed at this hotel for a day and encountered many problems. I feel it is necessary to say something to make a reservation for those who want to stay:
1. The room is moldy;
2. There is no place to put shampoo and shower gel in the bathroom, either on the ground or on the console of the shower.
3. The bedside table is too low, like putting everything on the ground, and it is easy to fall down when taking things at night;
4. Look for the place where the used linen is not put in the bathroom, but it can only be put on the ground;
5. The floor drain does not know where to get a pipe, and the room is full of sewage and the smell of towels that have not been dried and rancid;
6. The whole room is not an exaggeration to describe it as a family with four walls. It is not like a five-star hotel that charges 2000+ a night.

The whole room is warm enough and the bath water is hot enough, nothing else. ‚ÄãIn conclusion, this hotel claims to be a designer hotel, but can you design a hotel for people to live in? Did these people live in person for a day after finishing the design? I think if more than a dozen or 20 people come together, the private villa is ok, but the individual guests are fine, don't come, and even if you have to come, don't try the room type of the forest hut. In short, I will never come again. This hotel has made me doubt the entire Hyatt brand. I must consider carefully when I encounter a hotel selected by Hyatt in the future. I give one point because I can't give zero points, otherwise I don't want to give one point

msg:A very satisfying trip. Although I did not choose to go to Beijing due to the epidemic, this small trip in the suburbs of Beijing is still remarkable~

The commune at the foot of the Great Wall has been around for a long time, but it has always felt remote and inconvenient. The experience of staying after the snow this time is very good, and the children are also very happy.

I stayed in Bamboo House No. 2. Because it is off-season, it is basically arranged in several buildings near the reception. It is also a great experience if you invite a few friends to stay with you. The room is very warm, and the temperature in the living room and public space is not low. It is a good choice for children to spread flowers and adults to chat.

It is worth mentioning the children's community, which has space for children upstairs, as well as a breast milk lounge. Downstairs is a place for older children to read, draw and do handicrafts. The little sister who likes the book even lends us to the room to read. Great experience.

The breakfast is not amazing, but it is enough for the whole family to eat well. Yakult is provided~ We ate dinner at Youying Restaurant, which is a walking distance from the foot of the mountain. The price is reasonable and the taste is amazing~ The children will never forget it~

When checking out, the lady at the front desk also gave the little squirrel a gift to the children, and the children liked it very much. In general, it is suitable for multiple families to stay, and the scenery after the snow is unique. In summer, you can climb the Great Wall. In winter, there seems to be a ski resort nearby. You can check in and experience it next time.

msg:It's really good, please rest assured that Hyatt's hotels live up to their name! Before booking, I consulted the customer service of the switchboard. It was a young man who answered my question very patiently. After talking for about ten minutes, I called again to confirm, and took the initiative to add me on WeChat to learn more about the needs of me and my child. Try to satisfy us to make the holiday more perfect. His WeChat name is PEKUB-GSC, first of all I want to thank him. Then after arriving at the hotel, the attitude of the front desk staff was very good, and there was no delay in check-in. We booked two rooms. We stayed at No. 4 of the Red House for the first night, and gave the child a view room with large windows on both sides. I Stayed in another double room. The red house is in a relatively high place, you can see the scenery of the peaks and valleys, it is very quiet, and the sleep quality is good! On the second night, I stayed in Building 3 of the Forest Cabin. The air conditioner outside was noisy at night, and it is recommended not to live in the Forest Cabin for those who have high requirements for sleep. The scenery is of course also very good, especially when it snows, the snow scene in the woods is like a fairy tale world. I bought a package from Ctrip, which included a hot pot meal. I forgot to call ahead to make an appoin**ent. The restaurant said that there were no ingredients, and even if I booked for lunch the next day, it would not be available. The problem is that Ctrip did not communicate well with the hotel, and the front desk gave me 488 yuan to order any meal, so the food was not bad. I would like to thank a little girl in the restaurant who is not tall and has a ponytail. She helps with communication and has always had a good service attitude! There is also Ms. Shi Jun, the duty manager at the front desk. When I checked out, I apologized for not solving the noise problem in the room, and said that in the future, I would make a note for a quiet room in advance. The shuttle bus is also on call, very quickly. All in all, this short three-day vacation was very pleasant in the commune at the foot of the Great Wall, and I look forward to going back in early summer.
Although it is far away from the bustling city, it seems to be in the countryside, but the service experience is not worse than that of a four-star hotel in the city, and it is by no means comparable to a farmhouse with a price of one or two thousand. Such a homestay has no service at all.

From the moment you enter the door, it is a paradise. Stayed for two days and experienced two different styles of villas. One is the pos**odern black-white-grey style of the courtyard house. The other is the red house, which is also the land of Internet celebrities. The red house really shocked me. The basic tone is that deep bean paste color, which looks like a high-grade reddish brown, which instantly enhances the texture. In particular, the soft decoration of the living room in the public area is also subtle and slightly warped. Taking pictures is also very good. Friends who want to live must try the red house.
Of course, I have to comment on Hefnner at the front desk. Very nice baby. Very, very patiently dealt with my various requests, which made my stay experience better this time.

msg:I just celebrated my mother‚Äôs birthday at the Commune by the Foot of the Great Wall. I had a very happy weekend vacation. In the past two years, because of the epidemic, I took my parents to spend the Spring Festival, birthdays or anniversaries in high-end hotels with scenery and services, such as Aman Yihe, Yanqi Hotel, and World Expo Circle. This time I chose the Great Wall Commune and wanted to change to a "wild" environment, but I was afraid that it would be too cold. Fortunately, the price was reasonable. With the mentality of trying it out, the three families packaged the entire villa of "Forest Lodge" with three floors. There are two deluxe double-bed rooms and one standard double-bed room. There is a large common area as a family‚Äôs living room. My sister and I have not lived with our parents since we got married. This time it was the dream of a family living in a villa. Everyone eats hot pot, climbs mountains, plays badminton, plays table tennis, plays table football, plays mahjong, chats big, eats melon seeds, shares snacks, facial masks and photos...In short, one of my family members spent a perfect time with my mother. Birthday.
        The location of the hotel has a unique advantage. The Great Wall can be seen clearly from the window; parking is very convenient, some can be parked at the door of the villa; in winter, there are various indoor entertainment facilities; breakfast is abundant, and Chinese and Western dishes are available for you. It is particularly worth mentioning that the breakfast time is open from 7:30 to 13:30, you can sleep until you wake up naturally, and then have a brunch in the sun. Each room in the villa has excellent privacy, simple and generous decoration, coffee machine, hair dryer and bathroom facilities are all brands, which deserves to be selected by Hyatt.
      From the doorman, cleaning, to the front desk and restaurant waiters, the hotel is warm and thoughtful, and provides any help patiently and promptly. Especially praise the front desk manager Feng Xinlan (Quella). We went to the "exploration shop" one week in advance. She showed us one by one and patiently introduced the characteristics of the red house, the bamboo house and the forest hut, and finally decided that three forest huts are suitable for our three families, and they are the closest to the hotel lobby. , It is convenient for the elderly to go to have a meal. Before we checked in, we personally checked the details of each room. After we checked in, we sent a birthday card and champagne to our mother, which made our family feel that the Hyatt Hotel she represents is first-class service and quality.
     Looking forward to visiting again in summer.

If you don't want to waste it, you can only increase the burden on your stomach. The little sister at the front desk of the hotel is very enthusiastic. She arranges the view room in the red house. The room has a very good view and no smell. A villa only accommodates the two of us and is quite casual. The Great Wall near the hotel feels great to watch the sunset, but the journey is a bit difficult to go up and down the mountain with the help of a cable. Although it is a bit difficult but not dangerous, it is strongly recommended that you wear gloves when climbing the Great Wall, otherwise your hands will be a little cold in winter. A perfect trip

Thanks to my real name, my little brother mark at the front desk arranged for the room type. The public area of the Red House is very photogenic, and the large terrace is relaxed and comfortable; the front desk upgraded the room type to the forest cabin the next day. The experience is also very good. You can wake up naturally when you sleep, listening to the birds, and shining in the sun. Looking through the book casually in my glass room, I feel full of happiness. The breakfast buffet is the same as the previous reviews, there are not many types, but the taste is good. You can choose to have dinner at the hotel or experience the surrounding farmhouses. If the weather is good, it is necessary to go to the Wild Great Wall.

Hyatt's sense of service is still in place. A little brother who checked us in, I would like to give a commendation. Evan Xu was very patient and cheerful throughout the whole process. He gave a detailed introduction to the route of the whole hotel and the suggested route. Fortunately, we were assigned to the Red House. At about 12:30, we have already checked in. Since the room with windows on all sides in the picture on the Internet has not been cleaned, the windows of the room we assigned were slightly off. After asking the guest service for the room change request, we also actively dealt with it. Although the room is cleaned after 16:00, it is understandable that the room is very clean, and each room is far away, so it is conceivable that the waiter of the room is also more difficult, so you can wait more. Understandable. The hotel has a road to climb the Wild Great Wall, which is quite interesting. If the weather is good, the sky is full of stars at night~ You can see it when you lie in the room and look up, really-sleep with the stars haha~ Overall satisfaction, the only suggestion is that the water in the room is a bit offensive, and the bathroom door may be wood for a long time. The reason is not very close. Just take time for an overhaul. Next time I plan to take my mom to relax.

The baby ended the camp at Beijing Summer School and came to pick up and go around around. I have to go to the Great Wall once, and then I want to stay in a special hotel, so I booked the commune at the foot of the Great Wall.

The transportation is convenient. It takes about an hour to get there from the city. In the evening, the temperature in the mountains is pleasant, and the children are also very interested. Walking in the commune and exploring different villas are the works of top Asian architects 20 years ago.
The mountains are very quiet at night. I looked up and saw a lot of stars, at least more than a hundred. . .
In the morning, I found the street signs of the ancient Great Wall. It does not belong to the hotel's facilities now. Well, you can explore it yourself. According to my daughter's words, bold and reckless. . .
In the end, I climbed from the hillside for ten minutes to reach the ancient Great Wall. The scenery is excellent and enjoyable. . .
After climbing the mountain, I was hungry. I went back to the commune restaurant and had a big meal. The breakfast was also very good.
A pleasant experience, as a destination proposer, won praise from the daughter-in-law and daughter. You can also make an appoin**ent with a friend next time.

msg:This stay was an unexpected surprise during my trip to Beijing. Because it was not in the plan, I did not expect to live at the foot of the Great Wall for one night at all. Because its Ctrip score is not high. Later, I learned that the managers who had changed several rounds before did not do well. After all, the Hyatt Group is a bigwig in the hotel industry, so it gave the commune a new lease of life. It gave me this wonderful experience of staying. When a friend recommended it to me, the reason "you can enjoy the Great Wall alone" is enough. In addition, the commune at the foot of the Great Wall is, after all, a well-known real estate project done by real estate tycoon Pan Shiyi 20 years ago. It was designed by international masters, Kengo Kuma, Anton... I am admired by real estate people. When we saw them in the hotel, we all sighed that the classics are truly timeless, and the architectural design of the current commune is still classic. You can look at the picture, I won't talk nonsense.
        After checking in, we left our luggage and went to explore the secret road on the Great Wall. Of course, the hotel is not recommended for safety reasons. Our group of four adults, with four children aged five and nine years old, took more than 2 minutes to climb to the Great Wall. Standing on the top of the Great Wall, overlooking the rolling mountains, feel relaxed and happy. Children also have a unique sense of accomplishment, and the pleasure of conquering is unparalleled. Seeing the scene of the Badaling Great Wall in the circle of friends in a traffic jam for three hours and queuing for two hours, I feel superior.
        After going down the mountain, we had dinner in the commune‚Äôs restaurant, probably because there was not a lot of traffic and there was no buffet. But the cooking standard far exceeded my expectations. A buffet is provided for breakfast. Although there are not many tricks, I think the "eatability rate" is very high. Unlike most buffet breakfasts, there are so many names, but there are only two or three things that make you want to eat.
        The commune‚Äôs architecture is cold, and the master‚Äôs works have this characteristic, but the service is warm. As long as you show a problematic expression and have not waited to open your mouth, there will be staff members who will come forward to care about and inquire; every building in the hotel is scattered in the mountains, and cars are picked up and sent up and down. Of course, you can also choose to walk, take more deep breaths, and enjoy the negative oxygen ions in the mountains. In addition, the commune thought of more intimately for the children. It built a children‚Äôs commune where children can play clay, paint, read, and play in the playground at will. The children‚Äôs commune often organizes activities to bring children to make it by hand. Category.
        The commune gave us and our children so many surprises.
  I hope that the above information can be used for your reference.

msg:The cost performance is low, the service is not considerate enough, and the management is problematic. 1. There were a large number of vacant rooms that day. We had people in their eighties, but the front desk failed to arrange our two rooms in the same building, and they were arranged in the two buildings farthest from the dozens of buildings. The street lights are seriously not enough, and the road between the commutes feels very horrible. 2. There is a sanitary bag used by others on the floor next to the toilet and could not be removed. 3. After showering, the floor drain under the washbasin gushed out a huge odor, and the air-conditioning inlet of the room was in the bathroom, which caused the huge odor of the room for an hour to be unable to dissipate. The source of the odor was discovered after careful inspection by the engineering staff. 4. The highlight is that the room is large, and the appearance of the famous bamboo house and red house has a sense of design.

msg:I'm too lazy to talk about it. I booked a deluxe double room. I went to the room without a clean room. I said that I would have to wait 20 minutes. It was very tiring at first. It's worth the calculation. Let's wait a while. Wait and wait. I waited for an hour. . Moreover, the forest hut is not far from the front desk. During the period, I walked up and took a look. The aunt who cleaned up moved slowly, talking and laughing. It was almost an hour, and I couldn't sit still. I was told that there was any supervisor who had to go to check and accept the room card. Otherwise, you can refund one hundred yuan for the difference and transfer to a room that is one grade lower. I. . . . . When I heard that there was no room for the first time, I changed it to the lower room. By the way, I arrived around four o'clock and checked in at five thirty. I don't have a room at this time? How To. . . The facilities in the room were average and there was a shortage of toilet paper, only in the bathroom, not on the bedside table. It's really like the high-end farmhouse mentioned in the comments. I am angry. After waiting for so long, the hotel has no effective solutions.

There is no place in the bathroom where you can hang towels, which is not very convenient. The natural environment of the hotel is good, and different rooms have their own characteristics. We live in the Red House, both indoors and outdoors are very creative, taking pictures very well üëç but there are many steps, not very friendly to people with limited mobility and the elderly. The waiters are very nice, in short it was a very pleasant weekend time.

msg:The Dragon Boat Festival is too short, just stay in Beijing
Two months ago, I heard that the commune at the foot of the Great Wall had been reinstalled. After all, there was a lot of fire more than a decade ago. Now let the Hyatt Group take over again, to explore new things.
The exterior of the building has not changed, and the focus of this refurbishment should be the interior.
I ordered a red house, and there are 4 rooms of different types in one building, and I ordered a family room. Two rooms without halls, separate toilets for dry and wet. Two big and one small, the layout is relatively cramped.
There are four households in the Red House, sharing a common area with a large circular chandelier, which is more suitable for taking pictures. There are also many residents taking pictures here.
The occupancy rate during the Dragon Boat Festival is still very high. If your neighbors in the same house are very noisy, the quality of rest is greatly reduced. You can hear everything they say in your own room.
The hotel‚Äôs meals are relatively simple. If the room does not include breakfast, the price is 258 per person, but it is incomparable to the five-star hotels in the city. There are few types and all the staple foods seem to be semi-finished products from the supermarket.
The children‚Äôs commune is charged separately and the swimming pool is not open. These are not specified when booking, and there are almost no activities in the hotel. The gym is small and pitiful. Great smell at the front desk.
After cleaning, the kettle washed out a lot of tea stalks, which was disgusting. Still not washed the next day.
There was no water in the shower room, and there was still water in the morning after taking a bath.
The curtains in the room are tightly drawn, and the sun will disturb sleep early in the summer.
The air conditioning control panel in the room is always on throughout the night and continues to affect sleep.
In general, it is still the standard of high-end farmhouse. Traveling in the suburbs of Beijing is still recommended Yanqi Hotel and Bay Mid-levels.

It was only when I arrived that the exclusive Great Wall was not open anymore, but the Shuiguan Great Wall was not far away and there were few key people. Hotel dining is expensive, but the taste of the dishes is very good, and the quantity is large, which exceeds the estimate of the hotel‚Äôs cuisine. Two people ordered a few dishes and stood by the wall.

msg:The experience was quite disappointing. I went to the Internet celebrity designer hotel, but the room was very general and outdated. I felt that the sanitary conditions were poor. The outdoor 398 BBQ self-service flies flew around, and the hotel did not take measures to kill flies, and the flies fell When it comes to the dishes... The most depressing thing is that the management of the hotel is relatively chaotic, and the internal staff has been diagnosed with the new crown, resulting in the customers who are empty at the same time being quarantined at home for a week, and their business trips have been disrupted...
