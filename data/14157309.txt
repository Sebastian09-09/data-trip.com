Despite this, the location is good and the decorations are good, too.

There is a bus stop (Sangu Roundabout) at the door where you can take free buses. The hotel is designed in a courtyard style, with an elegant and quiet appearance and a modern and tidy interior; 🛁 It is very new, large and deep, and there are unique tea sets to drink 🍵. Ms. Pan, who received us at the front desk, was enthusiastic and professional. She helped us with our luggage and led us to the room. When she heard that my husband was not feeling well, she sent someone to deliver it 🌡️. The hotel breakfast is also very distinctive, combining deliciousness and nutrition. As a light luxury and high-end hotel, two small suggestions: 1. Consider installing smart washing in the future 🚽; 2. The coffee in the breakfast room ☕️ can be made into pure coffee without adding sugar and milk, so that guests can choose for themselves.

msg:1. The location is very good. On the main street of Wuyishan, you can find delicious food at both ends. It is also very close to the bus station, so it is very convenient to go out.
2. The design is beautiful. The design is really amazing, worthy of being an award-winning work, with a sense of bamboo rhyme and tea fragrance. The first and second floors can be connected through the inner courtyard, which is seamless.
3. Complete facilities. There is a special space for tea tasting indoors, with complete tea sets and good tea. The only drawback is that there is only a washing machine but no dryer, which is too difficult in this humid and rainy place. It feels damp every day.
4. Breakfast. The breakfast is delicious, with rice noodles and Dahongpao tea eggs, which can meet the needs of breakfast.

If you take the high-speed rail to Nanping, you can take the tram for 40 minutes to the south entrance, and then take a taxi for more than ten yuan to the hotel. It is very convenient to eat around. There are many restaurants to choose from within a 10-minute walk, and takeout can be delivered directly to the room. The guest room is generally clean, and the staff service is good, but there are not many sockets in the room, and there is no desk. If you bring a computer to work, the computer can only be placed on the bed. In addition, only two bottles of water are provided free of charge every day, and more are charged. This is the first time I have encountered this when staying in a hotel.

You don't need to take a taxi for a few days. The restaurant next to it is also delicious, and the tea shop is also good. I bought a lot of tea. The facilities are basically good, with Chinese decoration. The rooms were full for the first two days, so I didn't get an upgrade. The basic room is not very good. 32 square meters sounds not small, but the toilet is bigger than the room. After opening the window, there is a rumble of three air-conditioning units. Fortunately, I got an upgrade for the next two nights, otherwise it would be really frustrating. The breakfast is also better than expected. The waiters are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to say hello. There are two small points. The first is that the room has to be charged for water delivery. It's the first time I've stayed in a hotel that charges for ordinary bottled water. It's so strange. It is recommended to make this clear when checking in. The second is that there is only a washing machine but no dryer. The clothes can't be dried at all after being cold for a day and a night. It is recommended to install it. Overall good~

The facilities of this hotel are relatively new, the staff is enthusiastic, and the service is first-class! It can be called the king of cost-effective hotels in Wuyi Mountain! The service of Manager Pan at the front desk is really very good. Because the weather is not good with the baby, and there are many of us, Manager Pan has been helping us find a room in the public area for free use every day. In addition to free use of the room, he also arranged for us to make tea! The breakfast of the hotel is also very good, and the cancellation policy during the Qingming Festival holiday is also very humane. Next time you come to Wuyi Mountain, you must stay in this hotel!

Talking about the rooms, the hotel is not new, it is 17 years old, but the rooms are still okay. There was no obvious dust in the sanitary corners. During the Chinese New Year, I was very busy every day, which was not easy.
Comments that can be made: Parking is not easy. The paper quality in the bathroom can be improved. There is only one free tea bag, which is indeed a bit less. 😄
Finally, next time I come to Wuyishan, I will stay at Yue Wuyi Tea Hotel. 🫰🏻

I like it better. After arriving at the store, the service staff are very enthusiastic, and I feel very happy Comfortable, and gave me welcome fruit, especially the bed here is very comfortable to sleep, the room is also very clean, the environment is very quiet, the breakfast is very good, the location is very close to the attractions, I will come again, it is worth recommending.

Environment: The hotel looks very good at night, the appearance is very good, but the appearance is false, and the supporting facilities and services are too poor.

Facilities: The facilities are too ordinary, nothing worth mentioning


Service: The service is very poor. Although the lobby is large, there is only one person at the front desk, and there are plenty of rooms in the off-season, and they will not take the initiative to upgrade the room type for guests, and no introduction is given.

The hotel setting is relatively traditional. The hotel is next to the street, which is convenient for eating.

I didn't expect such a difference in attitude. After checking in at 1:00 in the morning, the self-proclaimed boss treated customers like a cannonball at the front desk. Follow up What's the difference between a black shop and a star? There is no sense of service at all, if it is not too lazy to look for it again in the early morning, it will not be able to choose. It's like I owe you the air conditioner in the hall. I can't bear to open the room and I don't know how long the fruit has been left to dry! In the afternoon, the little brother at the front desk urged the guests not to be too harsh. A small place is a small place. The service attitude is very bad. It is understandable that it is incomparable with a big city.

msg:"A stream runs through the mountains, with nine curves of clear water. There are rocks beside the stream, and the reflection is soaked in cold green."

The beautiful scenery of Wuyi is as unforgettable as described in poetry, and this hotel undoubtedly perfectly reflects the charm of this place. The gray square shape like the huge rock unique to Wuyi Mountain is particularly conspicuous on this street. The unique design style directly clashes with the Wuyi landscape, but is not obtrusive. Entering the hotel lobby is a familiar scent, and the quiet and melodious music brings a touch of Zen. The entire hotel implements the elements of tea. In addition to some rare tea-related exhibits, there is also a public tea-making area, which is quite like a tea museum.

It is said that the road design of the hotel is as winding as a Jiuqu River, and the connections between buildings are structured by countless elevators. Next to these roads are ornamental courtyards carefully designed by designers. The tranquility and elegance are the first impression they gave me. The collision of gray stones and towering pine trees has a wabi-sabi style flavor. Every corner is a scene, and it contains the designer’s intentions. It is undoubtedly a good place for taking pictures.

People, people in Wuyi Mountain have always given me a feeling of seeing things clearly, at least the tea farmers I met are like this. But all the enthusiasm I received in Wuyishan was given by the hotel's service staff. They are patient, gentle, and willing to solve problems. You seem to be able to see the unique charm conveyed by tea from them. Especially the lady named Zhang at the front desk, I personally think that Narcissus is synonymous with her, soft and gentle. She took the trouble to solve many of my problems, and the foundation of my happiness on this trip came from her help.

Turning back to the hotel itself, there are still many things to be desired. First of all, the design of the sink is unreasonable (for me) and it is very easy to splash water. The mouthwash cup does not feel very good when used, and it is a bit contrary to ergonomics. Secondly, I booked a suite worth thousands of dollars, but the walls were cracked and not repaired, which somewhat affected my mood. Finally, although the breakfast selection is very rich, more changes can be added every day to cater for travelers who need to stay for a long time. btw Friends who choose room types should check in advance whether the construction on the outside of the suite has been completed in the near future, otherwise you will wake up at 7 or 8 in the morning with the sound of banging, and enjoy the forest formed by the construction green cloth outside the window.

The most frightening thing is the circuit in the room. The power is turned off in the middle of the night, and the lights suddenly turn on and off, out of control. Repeatedly for a dozen times, from 12 am to 3 am, I am scared to sleep all night! ! ! ! ! No one picked up the call at the front desk. The next day, he took a perfunctory attitude and took out four packets of tea to ask for something, without any apology! Decided to check out the room and change the hotel! How scary! ! !

msg:環境：環境和房間造型是符合美學酒店的感覺的，整體很不錯，也是被圖片吸引入住的。臨近主景區，公交車4站到景區南入口，交通便利。

衞生：衞生狀況跟網友説的一致，疏於打理了，房間裏隨處可見發黴、潮濕、裂牆的情況，空調出風口發黴嚴重，整理房間的阿姨倒垃圾也不換垃圾袋，確實衞生情況不佳。

服務：服務較為到位，客房人員態度都很好

設施：特色的設施基本沒有開放，星空房未開放且需要預約，但是要約在3日後，一般客人三日就離店啦。酒店的博物館也沒有開，開的衹有一樓的茶銷售噢。

總體來説還是不錯的快捷酒店，希望酒店再提升一下細節，如假花換真花，取消要掃碼的充電器，設施開發到位等。

衞生：衞生值得誇一下，我也算有點潔癖的人，尤其細節衞生，看來領導對衞生是很重視的
環境：酒店在度假區主幹道上，逛街去景區很方便，難得的是有酒店的庭院區，我個人很喜歡，下點小雨我們在茶亭院自己泡了一下午的茶，心莫名的安靜，感覺這是武夷山之行最大的收穫
服務：前台房務餐廳服務都很好，温温柔柔的微笑打招呼，提出的旅遊諮詢也很熱情的給我們很好的建議，早餐的扁肉（混沌）很好吃。看攻略原計劃去白雲寺看日出，前台小姐姐説得看天氣，果然下起了雨，有點遺憾，留着下次去。
點評讓我一度猶豫，但是去了真心滿意，為我武夷山之行更為圓滿，推薦！

首先，地理位置很好，處在度假區的的中心區域，離景點也近，吃喝玩樂真的很方便。停車的話由於我來的時候是淡季，車位還是比較充足的。

預訂的茶修豪華大床房，被安排在了8號樓，是獨棟的樓型，離大堂特別遠，酒店的整體裝潢設計還是比較出彩的，房內是新中式的風格，裝修比較素雅，窗外沒什麼景色，正對着還未完工的建築，再加上整棟樓就我一位客人入住，到了晚上連廊慘淡的燈光還是有點陰森的。女生真的不推薦入住8號樓，因為外賣都可以送上來，不是很安全，然後晚上沒有任何服務人員在這棟樓，就一人一間，怪瘮人的。不過我白天遇到的服務員阿姨還是蠻熱情的，貼心的送上來了水果和餅乾。

酒店總體還是可以的，無論地理位置還是環境都算好評，就是我建議費自駕的客人入住還是別選8號樓，確實離大堂很遠，尤其是多件行李在身的也不是方便，自駕的話倒是可以把車直接開到8號樓下面。其他可圈可點，還可以吧。

msg:優點：
🍃：酒店門面很漂亮，像一個博物館。特別是門口的木質結構入口，很有特色，整體風格古色古香。內部有一個很漂亮的小園林。我們時間不夠衹能粗略逛逛。

🚗 交通：位於三姑度假區內，打車去景區或餐廳都在10塊錢以內；

🔔服務：
1. 房間裏有茶室，還給了很多免費的小零食和飲品。這一點倒比那兩家最貴的度假酒店還強。
2. 酒店裡可以免費租借漢服，但看了一下實在沒看上，因為確實衣服比較舊了，款式比較老。但畢竟是免費的，也不能有啥要求。

缺點：早餐
之前看評論説是早餐不錯，期待蠻高。結果早上去一看，看起來東西不少，但其實能吃的不多。特別是炸的雞米花實在是太硬了，喉嚨都給劃傷了一天都不舒服（想想也覺得不可思議）。

msg:真的要為酒店好好寫一次評論！
一年n次出差➕家庭旅行，平時酒店都是按五星級老牌來定，但這次武夷山定晚了，無意刷到這個酒店，於是先定了，當時看評論心裏是有擔心，個人覺得自己是比較挑剔的，當天辦理入住前台操作不熟悉，還有住客因不滿退房，心裏更是害怕，但進入房間，發現並沒有那麼差！
首先，衞生乾淨到懷疑人生！沒有衞生死角，我是那種會真的會用手去檢查！因為有寶寶很注意衞生細節！
第二，雙床房直接拼成大床房，帶寶寶爽到起飛！
第三，酒店是翻新，房間牆面確實有些地方有瑕疵，但是衞生間很棒！而且潔具是科勒，並沒有那麼差！
第四，我們定的基礎房，有喝茶的地方，很不錯！也有冰箱！
第五，空調冷到懷疑人生，可能我們運氣好！房間空調沒有任何問題！
第六，早餐一般，介意的話請移步周邊，全是網推的早餐店，好吃不貴，走路幾分鐘，不一定非要吃酒店啊！
第七，如果想拿老牌五星的服務標準來定義這個酒店，那真的建議不要定，節假日明顯人力不足，前台有新人業務不熟練，但每次我提出來的訴求，都儘可能解決了，對我而言是足夠了！
以上，是我個人住了四晚的體驗！
