msg:We spent one night at this lovely hotel. The grounds are beautiful, surrounded by gardens, water features, and traditional Chinese architecture. It’s truly an oasis in the big city. 

The room was spacious and very nice. Large bathtub! They also provided a baby crib for our son which was clean and comfortable. 

The manager, Tommy, was very helpful and nice. He said they would have a few rooms/buildings that accept dogs in a few months. So well for sure come back with our dog!

My only complaint is the room was warm. The AC unit was on high fan and set to 23 but the temperature never got below 26. And the outside temperature was 19-21 degrees, so it shouldn’t be difficult to cool the room down.

msg:During the May Day holiday, I didn't want to go out and squeeze in with the crowds, so I booked a hotel in a hurry. I didn't have any ideas at first, but when I entered the hotel gate, I was amazed by the grand Chinese environment, the clean and tidy driveway, and the carefully arranged green belts. The hotel manager's care was reflected. After entering the lobby, I was impressed by the hotel front desk and concierge services, which were polite, enthusiastic, professional, fast, thoughtful and satisfactory! When checking in, I made some small requests, and Manager Ge immediately helped to solve them enthusiastically. I originally only booked one room, and quickly booked a room for the elderly who like quietness at home. The room is clean and tidy, with complete facilities and a reasonable layout. The hotel environment is comfortable and quiet, suitable for people who love to relax. It is very comfortable to take a leisurely stroll after breakfast and dinner.

I would like to thank the tall and handsome guy named Liu at the front desk for helping our family of four change to a family room. Because it was raining that day and we couldn't go out for dinner, we tried their Western buffet restaurant. The price was 228 per person. Because my daughter was over 1.4, we paid for 3 adults, and one was half the price. It was really expensive! I advise everyone not to go to their spa, it's a rip-off! A foot massage costs 398, and there is an additional 15% service charge! It's speechless!

msg:The hotel focuses on the environment. I brought my family's elderly to vacation. I rated it as the best one among so many hotels.

Indeed, I avoided the crowds during the May Day holiday and came to this paradise-like place. It was quiet, safe, and very comfortable. It is worth recommending.

It is close to Chuansha Ancient Town and not far from Disney. It is a very cost-effective hotel. Overall, it is great!

The interior of the room is very good, and it is equipped with a bathtub bag and sent fruits. Clean and refreshing.

There are a few small details that need to be improved:
1. Because it is the first time to come, I am not familiar with the situation. I can't see that it is the lobby entrance before entering the lobby at the hotel entrance. There is a lack of effective guide signs, or a concierge to guide guests. I searched for a long time, always afraid of finding the wrong one.

2. There is a sightseeing car at the entrance of the hotel. The front desk said that someone could arrange to drive to the yard for a tour. We might have gone there a little late. At five or six o'clock, we went downstairs to gather enthusiastically. When we arrived at the concierge, we were told that it was off work. However, the front desk and the concierge were not consistent. The specific time could be unified in advance, so as not to expect it in vain. Later, we were told that we could visit the next morning when we went to work, which made up for the regret. This is also a management issue. It is enough to make a rule.

3. The food in the Western restaurant needs to be improved and perfected. This is what many people are talking about. We bought a buffet dinner in the Western restaurant. We were full of expectations from the pictures. Maybe it was because we went late. There were not many things after seven o'clock, and many things did not feel fresh. There were not many types of sashimi, which was very different from the photos. In contrast, breakfast is richer and steaming hot than dinner.

Chinese style garden hotel. Pavilions, spring flowers in full bloom, green trees like shade. The night view lighting is very beautiful.
Convenient location, a few minutes walk from Metro Line 2, take a taxi to Chuansha Ancient Town, Huang Yanpei's former residence, etc. The time-honored local dishes of the state-owned workers and peasants restaurant on the old street of the ancient town are worth a try.
The hotel breakfast is of good quality. The millet porridge is sticky, the fried dough sticks are hot and crispy, the salted egg yolk is full of oil, and the pickled cucumbers and mustard are delicious, which greatly satisfies the Chinese stomach. Freshly ground coffee and butter cake are delicious.
The afternoon tea given in the set meal is great (market price 198 yuan), desserts, salty snacks, and ice cream balls. The tableware is exquisite and beautiful.
The service is very enthusiastic. The butler-style service of Manager Ge at the hotel front desk is particularly professional and warm! Patiently inform the contents of the ordered set meal, carefully point out the time and place of dining, and give a hand-painted round fan as a souvenir. Warm smile, feeling at home!

Hearing that there was an exhibition, an elderly person in the family, who was over 90 years old, sat on the sofa in the lobby for a long time, waiting to check in. At this time, the manager Jamie came up to ask us. Knowing that there were elderly people, he personally helped us to check in at the back office, reducing our waiting time. After that, he also helped us book afternoon tea and the Chinese restaurant in the evening. Special thanks to Jamie for his help, which made us feel that the service of your hotel is particularly humane and thoughtful.

msg:Facilities: Self-driving friendly, convenient parking. We stayed in a room on the 3rd floor of the Peony Building that was very close to the elevator in the corridor. After seven or eight years, the furniture showed signs of wear and tear. The internal actual samples are no different from the pictures produced by Ctrip. The lattice windows have a Jiangnan charm and are integrated with the overall style of the hotel. They are equipped with a unique key and can be pushed open for ventilation. The bathroom occupies a large area and has warm lighting, but the lighting inside the room is relatively dim, making the space a bit depressing. The toilet seat rattled when lowering, the suction power of the sewage was insufficient, the hand-held shower head was held high and the angle could not be adjusted - I really hope the hotel can improve these things as soon as possible. After all, it is a sanitary ware that is used too much and will affect your mood.

Service: The guest room responds in a timely manner, the front desk provides smiling service, the security guard at the gate carefully checks the incoming and outgoing vehicles, and the garden is carefully cleaned and maintained by a master. I hope it is because of the shortage of staff during the Spring Festival. The quality of the breakfast is good, but the richness is not satisfactory and not worth 128.

Cleanliness: The rooms, corridors, and gardens are all good. Furniture surfaces, faucets, etc. are old and cannot be wiped clean, and may need to be treated separately.

Environment: I would give 120 points. The garden layout is exquisite, and Taihu Mountain rocks are stacked with care, which can pass through flowers and willows, and you can watch fish by the pool... The flowers and trees are sp****, and the ancient trees are towering. Even if the cold wind is blowing in the season, there are also red and pink plum blossoms, golden jade wintersweet, bright red camellia, wolfberry holly, nandina bamboo and other embellishments. The pavilions, pavilions and pavilions shine brightly - you can completely feel the ingenuity and ingenuity that went into the hotel's gardens when they were built with each step changing scenery and winding paths leading to seclusion!

The hotel is not far from Chuansha Old Street. You can spend half a day to visit the City Wall Park and Neishidi, and also add some family programs.

Snacks in the in-room refrigerator are free😀. If you want to take a bath, they also provide disposable bath covers and bath salts. The only drawback is that there is no USB charging plug.

Taking a taxi to the outlet only costs more than 20 yuan, which is very convenient.

msg:One word, one true feeling. Because I was going abroad the next day, I chose a hotel near the airport. The architecture of the garden made me feel like I was in Suzhou, and the environment was really good. The car that took us to the hotel was a domestic electric car. There was no one to help us with our luggage the whole time we got off the car, even when we got to the room. At first, I thought your hotel did not have such a service. Unexpectedly, when I left the next day, I saw a group of well-dressed people coming in, carrying luggage, bowing their heads and greeting people with smiles. Then I realized that your hotel is here to see people. The same domestic electric car was reserved for delivery the next day. I took my child with a stroller and took my luggage when I went out. There were two doormen at the door who would rather chat than help with it. I don't like being treated differently. In addition, the hotel environment is really good, I have to say one thing. I hope the concierge staff can be trained as soon as possible.

msg:When checking in, a woman suddenly came out and said arrogantly to the front desk, please check how many rooms are available with a 20% discount? (This woman should be an internal staff member) The front desk staff politely replied: Please wait a moment, I will check in the guests. The woman waited for more than ten seconds and said, hurry up. Then another man came over. They stood next to me and chatted loudly. They urged the front desk several times. I really couldn't bear to say, why are you in such a hurry? Don't you think it's being processed? The woman said, I didn't talk about you. I scolded her, it's a big deal that you jumped in line. The couple were standing here chatting as mascots, and they went to the back of the queue. Honesty is far away from me now. I wanted to complain, but I also thought about quarreling with them. It would be even, but the internal management is also terrible, and the professional quality of this staff is not very good;
After checking in, I took my children to the children's playground. It is close to the swimming pool on the first floor, so the air is not good. The place is small, so I have to deal with it. I didn't see any staff from the moment I walked in. Suddenly, I passed by a cleaning woman wearing work clothes. She stood outside the door and yelled at me fiercely: "Come down, you can't do anything there." The kid&%#* couldn’t pronounce it correctly and didn’t understand what she said. Then he asked her what was wrong with the child, and she became more and more angry about the evil person above, cow! I said seriously, please speak well. At your age, can you speak well? Most of the arrogance was immediately extinguished, but I still didn't understand what happened to the child later. This management is not very good, or even worse.
The good thing is the afternoon tea, the guys and girls in the lobby bar are very nice, patient and kind, and the kids in the game room next to the front desk also like it. The guy who opens the door at the concierge is also very nice, and the guy at the front desk is also nice.
The hardware facilities are great. I will bring my elderly family members to experience it in the spring and autumn.

The room facilities are also good and maintained to the standard they should be. As for the service, it is seriously not up to par with the standard at this price. Half of the staff won't say anything when they see you. The deposit required to book a room is not very comfortable. Compared with business hotels, there is a big gap. As for the food, since I only had breakfast, I can only say that this breakfast is not bad for a hotel at this price, it can only be said to be extremely poor, which is the level of breakfast in a business hotel for 30 yuan, so for a hotel of this price Lunch and dinner just lost interest. In short, the environment of this hotel is very good to experience, and you can also have afternoon tea, but when you check in, there are no highlights except the hotel environment.

2. When the elevator comes out, there is a large piece of white cloth on the floor, and a warning sign is placed on it: be careful that the floor is slippery. I don’t know why. Why can’t you drag the floor in a five-star hotel?
3. In the aisle, there is a very strong and inferior freshener, which is very pungent
4. After entering the room, the cooling effect of the air conditioner is poor and stuffy
5. The TV next to the bathtub has no signal. I have tried all the signal sources, but it is still a decoration
6. The minibar is empty. After asking the front desk downstairs, I asked the room service to deliver four bottles of drinks
7. I wanted to add more pillows, but I was told: pillows are standard, there is no extra
8. The window sill of the room can be opened, which feels good, but the outdoor balcony is full of fallen leaves and bird droppings, and the balcony of the room on the same floor is not partitioned, so you can move around at will
9. The most surprising thing is the breakfast: the configuration of the breakfast is similar to that of an express hotel, and the restaurant service staff does not have matching disposable gloves and anti-spray plastic masks throughout the process
10. The design of the Chinese courtyard is very creative, but the basic service standards should not be ignored. It is estimated that the owner is running a hotel for the first time. It is recommended to find a reliable management company, or to experience more star-rated hotels. so unsatisfactory

The exquisite Soviet-style gardens and the artistic conception of winding paths lead to seclusion. It feels like living in the garden of a former rich family. There is a marina in the garden, which leads to a river next to it. The photo was good, and when I was leaving, I caught up with a couple of couples getting married and taking pictures here. I lived in the family transparent room on the first floor (the name seems to be two rooms side by side, with a door in the middle that can be opened, not a suite). The rooms are quite large, and they are on the highest two floors! There is a large conference hall and dining room. Breakfast is in a western restaurant, 128 is a bit expensive, because there are not many things to eat. Since it is Shanghai, at least there should be small wontons, pan-fried, and steamed buns! Only noodles and rice noodles are freshly cooked! When we found the room, we found it was right at the elevator entrance. We were afraid of noise, so the lobby manager quickly changed us to two quieter rooms. We are a family of three, and we booked a room with breakfast for four people, wasting one, and discussed with the lobby manager, and gave me two antique round fans with hotel patterns painted on them. But then my husband lost a Xiangfeizhu folding fan. I didn’t think about checking the monitoring until the next day, because I didn’t know where I lost it. At first, I asked me to call the police. After emphasizing it repeatedly, the male receptionist called me to check. I guess I didn't check it carefully, saying that we don't have fans in hand, because we have been waiting for a long time, so my husband said forget it. Why! A bit disappointed!

msg:The overall Chinese style of the hotel is actually very good. I like it very much. The only problem is that the service is so bad. Let’s talk about dinner first. When you go to the restaurant, you will be told that this is a Western restaurant. When you go out of the Chinese restaurant, turn right. Then the fantasy journey begins: run to the Chinese restaurant and be told that there are only private rooms. The low discount is 1,000. Two people can sit in the lobby. You go back to the Western restaurant. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor🤨! I had no choice but to go back. We were the only table in the hall. We took the order and ordered a few dishes. A waiter came and said that none of the things you ordered were available. Please order again😳. Then he tore up the order we just wrote in front of us. I watched all this operation. Stupid, this is the first time I encountered it. Four more people came in midway and asked the waiter, "Is your hotel state-owned?" I saw that the waiter didn't understand what he meant. Let’s talk about breakfast: it starts at 7 o’clock. When I walked in at 7:06, it was all empty. I thought it hadn’t started yet. The waiter gave me a very considerate suggestion: Why don’t you wait a while. We could only wait, and we managed to get a few at 7:26. I saw that there was mainly one chef working inside. It was not slow. Then I looked at it, and there were 4 tables of people waiting there. Yes. I have become accustomed to this situation, and I thought that the management couldn't be any worse! Okay! Halfway through the bowl of noodles, I went and there was still hair in the bowl🥵. I can't complain at this moment. If hotel management is like this, the boss should reflect on it. This review: first-class environment, first-class facilities, first-class management, not to mention excellent service.

The plants, rockery and ponds in the garden are well designed. Every corner and every door will give you a surprising view. It is a good place for punch-in photography, especially Hanfu photography.
The room is large, very clean, the bathroom is well-equipped, the air conditioner, the interior decoration, and the lamps are all very good.
There are Western Restaurant and Chinese Restaurant in the hotel. We only tried the Chinese restaurant. Their lobby is not very big, but there are many private rooms. Huaiyang dishes are good in taste and presentation, and the price/performance ratio is very good.
They seem to have a lot of halls that should be good places for weddings, especially Chinese weddings.

Service: I would like to point out Gordon, the lobby manager, who gave us very considerate service as soon as we entered the door. His enthusiasm is genuine and not over the top. Helped us a lot during our stay.
Overall the hotel service is good, we had a few issues and the housekeeping staff came and resolved them right away.
I will recommend to my friends, this is a very nice garden hotel in the city.

Facilities: The TV is not smart and cannot cast a screen. The electric curtains are really not as good as the manual ones. Generally, the electric curtains will automatically switch on and off when you pull them. You have to press the head of the bed, which is very troublesome. The pillows are not comfortable. What makes people unbearable is that the room is super stuffy. The air conditioner says it is controlled uniformly. It can't blow cold air. If you feel hot, send an electric fan. It's just that the hotel is very stuffy everywhere. It's like staying in a sauna
Hygiene: There is dust everywhere. It is understandable that the hotel is relatively old, but the dust is obviously not cleaned up. Fortunately, this time I took the baby out with a bed sheet and quilt cover. The room lighting here is very dark, and the bedding is yellow. can't come out clean
Service: There is no service at all. There are a few uniformed people chatting there in the entrance and exit lobby, and they don’t help you with your luggage. I booked two nights, and the minibar should also be free for two nights. It was useless for me to check in on the first day. The next night when Disney came back, I was exhausted. I bought a barbecue to eat. There was a small bag of peanuts in the minibar. It tasted good. I came down to buy it, and I said I should have two copies for two nights. Later, I agreed to deliver it, but it didn’t arrive after 40 or 50 minutes. I called to ask, and said that the warehouse was off work and there was no key. I laughed so hard. , The perfect hotel, choose carefully

msg:The design of the entire hotel is antique and has a Chinese-style feel. Especially the garden landscaping in the courtyard is full of the a**osphere of an imperial garden. When you enter the hotel and check in, the hotel front desk service is very enthusiastic and very satisfying. The only drawback is that the meals and breakfast are a bit ordinary and selective. The hotel's buffet in the evening cost more than 200 per person, but it didn't have many dishes, so I wouldn't recommend it. Overall, the overall stay was OK.

msg:On the weekend, I booked the Royal Garden Hotel, which I have been thinking about for a long time, to celebrate my 40th birthday. The pictures on the Internet do not deceive me, the classical garden-style buildings in the hotel really seem to have returned to the Tang Dynasty in an instant😄
From the moment of check-in, the registration at the front desk of the hotel lobby and the gift of toiletries and children's products, I felt the enthusiasm of the hotel's service. It was a manager who looked very refreshed and wore gold-rimmed glasses, packed in a gift bag , handed it to me personally. He also contacted the Chinese restaurant to determine the end time of lunch for me and lead me the way. In short, during the birthday celebration, I felt that the front desk staff of the hotel had a strong sense of service and the service was very enthusiastic! Being in the environment of such a classical building made me feel like Queen Wu Zetian, hahahaha🤭
The interior decoration of the hotel room is also completely antique. I was given welcome fruit when I entered the door, and there were free 🆓 drinks and snacks in the refrigerator. A variety of fruit-flavored mints are contained in classic jars on the coffee table. We ate buffet breakfast, a la carte Chinese food and buffet dinner at the hotel. Eating delicious food and admiring the beautiful scenery, I am very happy and unforgettable😆 Photos of the hotel’s exterior buildings and garden landscape have been posted by many netizens. I will post a few photos of the interior of the room and pictures of the food for everyone to see.

The whole is Chinese-style and antique~ The rooms arranged are also in the same building. The room is very spacious and the layout is good. Outside the window is a magnolia tree~
It is also good to take a walk in the garden when the weather is good.
Breakfast is in another building next to the main building, a western restaurant. Most of the meals are Chinese.

The decoration of the room is very high-end. Although it has been a few years old, it is still very new and the facilities are very complete.
The lobby manager Gordon is very considerate. He even gave a small gift when he checked in. He thoughtfully helped arrange check-in and dinner reservations. The front desk service of the hotel is professional.
On the night of check-in, I even met someone's child's birthday, and the fireworks show was put on for half an hour. This time, staying in this hotel is so worth it.
I will stay again next time when the flowers bloom more, and I also want to come when it snows.

The reason here is that there is one thing that is not going well. Since we checked in late that day, we didn’t go to the restaurant and we didn’t have time to sell. We know that the hotel has room service, but this time it really broke my original friendly impression. The so-called responsibility of the Chinese restaurant The person Chen Moumou (here will not directly call the full name) wasted me an hour from the beginning to the end, and then gave me the menu until I reviewed it and sent it to her by typing. At the end, I was told that I could not order it on WeChat, so I could only order it on the official account. Excuse me. It’s fine if you don’t explain it at the beginning Your time doesn’t matter Sorry my time is very precious okay! This is how a person in charge of a restaurant handles urgent customer complaints. Where does your service quality come from?

msg:Staying at the Garden Hotel, the remarkable points: during the day, you can move around and change the scenery, pavilions, small bridges, flowing water, white marble carvings, century-old trees, and scattered rockeries; at night, it is full of brilliance, what a Soviet-style garden in the city... …be in it and be at ease. The front desk service is good, and the guy who checks in is very enthusiastic.
Disadvantages: 1. There is no concierge service when you get off the car and enter the hotel, and no one in the five-star hotel will help you with your luggage. 2. The temperature of the air conditioner in the room is 22 degrees, and the temperature cannot be adjusted. Anyway, it is still winter. I reported it to the customer service department, so the central system set the room to automatically adjust the temperature, but I set it to 30 degrees. After four hours, it is still 22 Suddenly, a master came to the room to check the temperature, and said it would be fine (in fact, it has been four hours), the master said that if it was cold, he needed a heater (the master is still very caring), so it was the first time to stay The hotel asked for a heater. The temperature of the air conditioner in the whole hotel is not high. If you wear a bathrobe to go to the swimming pool, it will definitely be cold, and there is still a cool breeze in the locker room. 3. When it comes to bathrobes, I asked the customer service department for bathrobes for children. Three hours later, after swimming and returning to the room, it was delivered. The waiter explained that he forgot it. There is really nothing to say about this kind of service. 4. After taking a shower, there is already a small river outside the shower room, and the sealing ***** is useless.
In short, the overall experience is acceptable, there are not many people, and the quality of buffet breakfast and dinner still has room for improvement.

Rockery, pond water, and green trees constitute a poetic and picturesque beauty of quiet and indifferent artistic conception, which can be said to be the essence of Jiangnan gardens. Walking in the garden, the deepest experience is the care of the garden design and the maintenance of various flowers and trees. There is no garbage in every corner of the garden, and everything is taken care of very carefully. Great! This is a great hotel to relax and unwind. There are also warm and thoughtful hotel services, especially Jackie, the front office manager, and Seven, the lobby manager, who are very meticulous, thoughtful and enthusiastic, and let us spend a warm and peaceful Spring Festival here. I hope that the cherry blossoms and maple leaves will bloom in spring, and come here to enjoy the beauty of the garden when the snowflakes are flying.

The hotel front desk reception service is thoughtful and satisfactory! The lobby manager, Manager Ge, has a very good service attitude and can answer any questions
The size and hygiene of the room are also up to standard, and you can take a bath
Good value for money for evening buffet
Overall, regardless of the service, the overall environment, or the room, it has reached the 5-star standard
The only flaw is that the breakfast should be improved, now it is at most three-star level

msg:That is to say, the environment can
When I checked in on the first night, the woman at the front desk was wearing headphones, crossing her legs and checking her phone without raising her head. This is a so-called five-star hotel. The room was very cold at night. I called the front desk and said that the temperature in the room could not be adjusted. The front desk said that they were dealing with it in the background, but it never worked. To put it bluntly, they just didn't deal with it. It was freezing in the middle of the night and there was nothing I could do. I called again and asked for an extra quilt, so I managed to survive the night.
Breakfast: Breakfast in other five-star hotels ends at 10 o'clock or 10:30, but they end at 9:30.
The next morning, I called again to report the room temperature problem. A technician came and took a symbolic test. He also knew that the air coming out was cold and not warm at all. He directly told me to ask the front desk for a heater. .
When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that the heater was not enough, so I strongly requested to change rooms, so I changed rooms. After changing rooms and going downstairs to get takeout, I went to the front desk to get an extra room card. The guy at the front desk was actually playing games on his phone. When he saw me coming, he put the game phone on the table for me without hesitation. Regarding the room card, judging from the performance of the front desk for two consecutive days, I feel that the entire hotel does not care about this at all. It gives the impression that the hotel allows this phenomenon to exist.

Follow the running water on the balcony outside the room. I can't compliment the hygiene of bird droppings, cigarette butts and garbage everywhere. Breakfast can't be simpler.

Don't be fooled by the pictures of the hotel, they are all photos. The most disgusting thing is that the room was not cleaned up on the second day of check-in, and even the towels were not given. They said that because of the epidemic, they were afraid of cross-infection. If you want to save money, don't make such a dumb excuse. The surrounding hotels are not yours. It’s useless to clean up the room. It’s useless to get angry. A dead pig is not afraid of boiling water. The corridors are full of takeaway boxes and used towels thrown out by the guests after eating. This environmental isolation center is better than your hotel. The environment is good, and it's more than 1,000 nights, only to stay in a garbage hotel

I don't think this water is high-end, just ordinary drinking water. The breakfast is particularly bad. In the banquet hall, the dishes are cold. After staying for several days, the dishes are the same and equally cold. The gym is estimated to be outsourced. Like the hotel's Chinese restaurant, the dishes are good and taste good. Stepping on the hotel's hot pot buffet, the price/performance ratio is super low. It was the first time I didn't get enough to eat the buffet.

We ordered an afternoon tea set. It tasted good and looked pretty. If we could do it outdoors in the summer, it would feel more like a Jiangnan garden.
The hotel has a garden style, but it just happened to be a cloudy day when the temperature dropped during Chris**as, so it was a bit cold.

The unique Soviet-style gardens and buildings are unique and unique. The precious ancient and famous trees in the park are breathtaking.
We carefully observed and studied each exquisite antique work in the lobby. When we wanted to learn more about its history and content, we ran into the front office manager Ge, who took the initiative and enthusiastically introduced us that the building materials of the hotel are all made of pure Natural marble and other constructions, and took the trouble to explain the meaning of the sculptures... It satisfies our curiosity. Thank you very much for the professional service of Manager Ge! Seeing that we are all retired elderly people, the kind-hearted manager Ge is even more caring, telling him that if you need help, you can find him at any time, even if he has a rest day. We are very lucky ‘‘I’ve met a good person again’’!
The rooms are clean and hygienic, with moderately firm mattresses and comfortable bedding.
It would be even more perfect if the quality and service of the hotel breakfast could be improved!

🔔Service: The room is full on National Day, and the service is not enough to keep up. I want to add a quilt and pillows.
The hotel has a swimming pool. The little friends have a good time. It only opens after 12 o'clock, which is a bit late.
The breakfast buffet is very average, there are few varieties, and there are many people waiting in line. It's still delicious, but it's not worth the price of 128.
The afternoon tea in the hotel is still good, a set meal for two, four or five people are no problem, you can order a drink.
Originally wanted to try the Huaiyang cuisine in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, but it was full in the evening and at noon the next day. I look forward to the next time.

msg:The hardware and software are not worthy of the room rate of more than 1,000 yuan, and it is definitely not recommended!
First of all, the air-conditioning problem is terrible. Central air-conditioning is still being used in 2021. The room cannot change the mode by itself. The aisles and the room in the whole guest room are hot and stuffy. The hotel only said that we let us open the windows for ventilation. Otherwise, I opened the window at night and slept all night and my throat hurts.
Secondly, there are too few types of breakfast in the hotel, the place is small and crowded, the most common thing like fried noodles with bacon and orange juice is not available, and the speed of replenishing dishes is very slow after 8 o'clock.
Third, the hotel staff were not very patient in answering questions, and the doorman never said hello or helped take the luggage when they saw the guests entering the door. Other customers asked the waiter at the restaurant what stuffing the buns were, but they couldn't answer.
Fourth, the hair dryer used in the room is very bad. If there are obvious yellow stains on the floor towels, we don’t change it to the residents. Although it’s a floor towel, it’s not good to put a dirty one.
Fifth, the hotel group purchase voucher I bought contains a souvenir. The picture looks like the eco-bag data cable and two other things, but when I checked in, I gave a travel toiletry set. The hotel staff themselves I felt that I couldn't get it, so I gave me another data cable.
Sixth, when I get up in the morning, I have small red spots and a little oxygen on my body. I suspect health problems.
Seventh, the hotel has always been marketing the garden environment and expect not to be too high. In fact, the hotel is not big and the environment is just like in the picture. The ponds are very dirty and nothing special. When the lights are turned on at night, the place is more beautiful.
Anyway, I won't go anymore, if it wasn't for special events or anything, I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a good deal.

The weather is also very good, and the garden is full of sweet-scented osmanthus, no matter where you go, it will be golden osmanthus fragrance. I really relax my mind, as if the time has slowed down! There are still some shortcomings in the construction and maintenance, but it does not affect the overall delicacy.
The check-in went smoothly. The manager Ge and Miss Yu Jiatong at the front desk of the hotel are dedicated and enthusiastic, which is worthy of praise!
The sanitation of the hotel is OK, but there is still room for improvement.
The only regret is the breakfast, which is said to end at 10:30, but in fact the dishes are not enough around 9:45, and some are not meant to be added. This makes the breakfast that is not very rich, and makes people feel that there is no choice. This is a bit sorry for the price of this breakfast. Hope the hotel can be improved!

msg:Because of the domestic epidemic, the Mid-Autumn Festival had to find an interesting place in this city (our Shanghai) to relax with the old parents. Before, whether it was Ctrip or Dianping, many people mentioned the Royal Palace Hotel in Shanghai. I saw the photos of netizens, which are the garden model that my parents and I like, so I gladly booked two of them, bringing the old and the young. This garden is on holiday.
On the day of arrival, a lobby manager, Manager Ge, welcomed us very warmly. I gave the children oil pastels as gifts, and personally guided us to the elevator, and told us to report to him if we have any needs.
Many netizens have taken photos of this hotel’s scenery before, so I won’t record them. In addition, when I was there, the Yihua Building at the entrance and the majestic Yaohua Building were scaffolded, and it was not very good for framing. I put a few plaques in their garden and calligraphy in the hall of the Peony Building. I felt that when I was building the garden, I also worked hard on the calligraphy of the plaques and couplets. Well, this garden is very proud. I went straight to the Grand View Garden of the Dream of Red Mansions 😆.
There are two major landscapes in the entire garden, namely the pool view in front of the Peony Building in the main building and the pool view enclosed by the fourth floor of Yaohua, Wenhua, Yihua, and Ronghua. In addition, the Jingui Tower itself encloses a small landscape with rockery, pavilions, and running water. Although the sparrow is small, there are many garden elements. The two large landscapes feel like they are designed by masters. The waterfall also presents many changes of folding and splashing due to the rockery. In addition, there is a pavilion on the top of the rockery facing the waterfall (borrowing from Ouyang's official language), not the boat and the small flying rainbow, the small stone bridge, and the stone bridge are all well done.
Finally, the overall feeling of this garden is the style of Longlou Lianxiaohan, no wonder it is called the Imperial Court. I would rather it add more literati elements, the building should not be so arrogant, if there is still land, open a pond, an entire corridor, a variety of bananas, rockeries, stone bridges, and waterfalls.

The charming Soviet-style garden, strolling along the forest path, is the best choice when the epidemic cannot get out.

The room has been upgraded, and the mini bar in the refrigerator can be used for free. The overall layout of the room is reasonable. Unexpectedly, there is still intelligence 🚽.
This time staying, the only impression that was greatly discounted was the breakfast. Not to mention the overcrowding, the poor dishes, and the bottom line. The omelet cook was probably sent to do other things too, so he changed into a suit and made omelets there. From this point of view, I just didn't work. So the level of the egg is to ensure that it is cooked.
The restaurant is noisy and there is really nothing to eat. He drank a bowl of porridge and fled.
If you are near the hotel, you can still visit the ancient town of Chuansha.

The Chinese restaurant upstairs in the buffet for dinner, Huaiyang cuisine tastes very good, the dishes are large, the price is a bit expensive, but the 500 coupons for the Ctrip set meal, plus a little more for four people. When checking out, Manager Ge also gave two small gifts to the children, thank you very much.

The hotel is very well decorated, and it is good to bring the elderly and children to play. Although the variety of breakfast is not very large, it is considered to be careful, the front desk Manager Ge and Xiao are very enthusiastic.

msg:Due to the impact of the epidemic, the original travel plan to Shanghai was cancelled, and this one was found on Ctrip. Unexpectedly, it is the Jiabao Hotel. The interior is a Chinese garden structure with pavilions, terraces and pavilions. The scenery is very good. Parents are very satisfied with this. It is very suitable for aunts to come over and take pictures. The ladies wear Han clothes to take pictures. It's also very suitable.
The breakfast buffet is a combination of Chinese and Western. Afternoon tea is Western style, with a set menu. Like the desserts in the Chinese restaurant, I like their rose 🌹 yam cake.

The amu*****t facilities include children's playground, swimming pool, billiards and so on. Breakfast and afternoon tea are also exquisite and rich, and generally recommended!

Going to the hotel at night to take pictures is very good 👍 What is lacking: The service is not thoughtful and the hotel staff is not enthusiastic. The breakfast is not scattered, and the other hotels are much worse. In the morning, I want to swim to inform the children's playground and the pool that they will be open at 12 o'clock, and the children are disappointed.

The chefs of the Chinese restaurant are superb, and the few dishes we ordered were very delicious. That is, the thin and tall man in a suit in the cafe is very unprofessional. He asked him what time the breakfast will end tomorrow Monday. He said it was about ten o'clock, but it was actually half past nine, and there was no more at ten o'clock.

msg:Half of the summer vacation, the epidemic can not leave Shanghai, the public comment on the many times recommended this hotel, Trip.com found it online, although the price is small, but for the children, I have booked four rooms. The old and small nine people arrived at the hotel in the heavy rain. When they checked in, the main building was full. What Yulan Hall needed to go to 100 meters away. Because of the inconvenience of the old and small people, the manager agreed to upgrade us to the suite after consulting with the front desk. Thank you!
The hotel environment is really good, like the quaint Suzhou gardens, pavilions, bridges, rockery corridors, everything, antique cars and rickshaws, taking many pictures for the children. What makes the children excited is that there is a heated swimming pool and children's playground, and the children are happy. The only regret is that breakfast variety is really too little, there is not much choice, good in the restocking faster, still can eat full.
Stayed for two nights, there was a problem when checking out, and I forgot that my credit card was expired. At the end of the check-in, I was able to successfully swipe the 5,000 yuan deposit. When I checked out, it was the beginning of the month. I could not pay the balance and I could not return the deposit. I was too anxious. A manager named You let me take it easy, let me first brush the debit card, let me go home to activate the new credit card before contacting him to refund the deposit. After home immediately find new credit card activation, contacted you manager, soon received bank text message, 5000 yuan deposit back to the card, thank you manager!

The fly in the oin**ent is that the soundproofing of the corridor is not very good, and there is no place to eat around. Recently, you have to drive to Jinhui Plaza to eat.

Although there is an air purifier, the effect is not obvious. The afternoon tea in the recommended set menu is rich in sweet varieties, not greasy in taste, and good in quality. The Huaiyang cuisine in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is exquisite and delicious. In addition to being more expensive, it is worth a try. But the hotel breakfast is very average, and the overall package price is good for one night, suitable for elderly people.

msg:I took my children to Disneyland in the summer. When I chose the hotel, I was attracted by the antique garden style, so I booked it. But on the same day, there was a traffic jam on the elevated road repair, and it was almost early in the morning when I arrived at the hotel. When I entered the lobby, all the service staff sat and chatted. When I approached, they watched me and waited for me to tell them that I booked a room. I didn’t feel the service attitude of a star hotel during the whole process. , It feels cold. During the two nights, what activities were in the hotel park, the park also repaired the appearance of the house, the whole thing was messy. The next day Disney came back and was exhausted. The taxi could only go to the door. The security guard said that there was a traffic jam and couldn't get in. Get out of the car and walk in. Not to mention breakfast, anyway, it does not match the value of 120 people. Apart from this garden style, the environment is really not so good. There are mosquitoes in the room and it is not soundproof. There are children screaming in the aisle at night, and the room is clear. No good experience.

The room does not have a balcony, it is relatively small, and it is quite satisfactory. During the May Day period, the price is very high, but the overall hardware is not bad! What I want to complain about is the breakfast restaurant. It is small and crowded, and the layout is depressed. The price of more than 2,000 a night, the breakfast has to be a table... I can't squeeze the restaurant on the second floor. All meals on the second floor are simple from the first floor. It was installed and moved... It obviously did not keep up with the five-star standard in terms of service and restaurant facilities, and it did not meet such a price standard!

msg:位置離地鐵站近，雖然還要步行至大堂，有一段距離，但能欣賞花園景色。
造景做的很棒，夜景也還不錯，雖然夜晚部分打光刺眼，但整體適合散步逛花園。
房內設施很乾淨，燈光柔和，隔音好，沒有洗烘衣機。
唯一不足的是，住過的皇廷相關飯店，皇廷的人員一直親切感都不足，以及專業訓練感受上不如其它五星評價飯店。

1、本人1月25日入住，27號離店。因自己疏忽，遺漏重要高價物品在廢棄舊行李箱裏，離開酒店時就留在房間裏。到2月1號晚上時才想起，當晚急忙電話找酒店前台，經酒店前台和客房部溝通（也許還有其他溝通程序我不清楚啦），客房阿姨找到了我的行李箱，並在第二天順豐到付寄給了我，我驚喜地重拾我的重要物品。酒店的回覆和處理高效合理，給酒店各位員工點贊！👍
2、我26號出發迪士尼玩，走得匆忙把牌子掛成請勿打擾，酒店還專門在中午致電我確認是否不用打掃。非常細心體貼，點贊！
3、簽到時酒店免費升級到了行政房，非常漂亮寬敞。
4、酒店就是和名字一樣的，是個漂亮舒服的花園，裝潢古色古香，鳥語花香。另還有小童遊樂中心和spa（spa非免費，一次約380元左右），可惜由於時間較緊沒來得及去享受這些服務，還會再來喲～～

msg:環境：整體環境很好，中式庭院，可以讓你假裝在蘇州。
交通：就在地鐵二號線華夏中路站邊上，交通非常方便。
服務：整體服務都很不錯，前台服務熱情周到，尤其是葛經理，主動為我們安排適合小朋友的房間，考慮非常周到。
周邊：離川沙不遠，不遠還有一個華夏公園可以玩，但是周邊步行範圍內餐飲較一般，還是在酒店解決更方便。
小建議：房間有浴缸卻沒有一次性浴缸套，浴缸就不太好用了，建議酒店給客人預備一點，這也不貴的。

1.完全沒有服務，酒店大堂標示不清，門要很用力才能推開，進門的我滿手行李，門僮像個兵馬俑，不主動開門，我半天沒推開，還以為走錯了，那不是大堂入口.
2，酒店前台坐在那裡問我從哪裡訂的房，真的蠻無語，酒店餐廳，早餐，問啥啥不知，不知道酒店有沒有掛星，都不知道員工有沒有上崗培訓，有沒有培訓過讓客人賓至如歸，微笑服務.
3，大堂到客房電梯的走廊充斥着刺鼻的洗手間味道，😮‍💨 一言難盡.
4，酒店標示離迪斯尼僅2.4km，實際打車超過10公里以上，這點真心是欺騙！！！

msg:不得不説環境是非常的好，適合帶着長者去遊玩，但是第一天入住房間就忘記放一次性拖鞋和沐浴用品，真的無語，讓我一度懷疑這個房間到底有沒有被打掃過。然後在中餐廳吃飯更無語了，連續訂了兩天的中飯，因為趕上國慶有人在辦婚姻，被告知上菜會慢，這都是可以理解的，第一天中午我們也吃的很開心，結果第二天中午，我們點了一道紅燒肉，遲遲不上菜，我們至少等了有一個小時左右，其他菜都吃完了，紅燒肉就是不上，中間讓幫我們點菜的服務員催過，這個服務員好像還是個小領班，穿着小西裝，這個服務員催都沒催直接告訴我們紅燒肉要燉半小時，讓我們等，因為這家店的紅燒肉還是挺好吃的，我們就等呀等，最後找了另一個服務員幫我們去催，結果那個服務員找來了幫我們點菜的那個告訴我們，剛才我們點的一道蔬菜因為沒有了，然後我們不是取消了嗎？潛台詞就是你們沒菜了呀。我説不是蔬菜是紅燒肉，她一愣，我和她説紅燒肉沒開始做就取消吧，要是快做完了我們就等一等，結果她一查就直接告訴我們幫我們取消了，那根本就是她漏點了呀，氣瘋了，這一個小時我們就乾等，關鍵當中還讓她幫我們催過紅燒肉！！！最後她工作失職連個道歉和解釋都沒有，就告知我們紅燒肉幫你們取消了，真的是氣笑了，啥服務態度，呵！

msg:國慶節假期能訂到的酒店一開始真的不抱太大希望。
被大堂的奢華震住了，富麗堂皇到極點。
酒店房間非常大，燈設定的很人性化
宣傳的酒店親子設施很小一個，不過孩子們倒是也無所謂，也能打發二小時左右。
第二天打算去游泳，發生一點不滿意的事，酒店説週一是保養日，後來經過溝通，酒店説給我們延遲退房。
酒店餐飲很可怕，是扣分項目，人超級多，也沒啥吃的，晚餐我們吃了自助餐，但是人太多，也不加食物。
酒店很適合長者去。

msg:#一步一景 一朝一夕#

非必要不離滬，對於“酒店控”而言，就是不斷挖掘上海各式各樣酒店的契機和過程。

之前就在網絡上看到過皇廷的照片，覺得很精緻養眼。國慶期間，遠離市區，川沙二日遊，也不錯。

特別表揚一下服務吧：
辦入住時，很幸運碰到沈健經理在旁邊。聽到我説帶孩子帶長者，所以希望可以安排兩間相鄰的二樓客房。立刻讓工作人員幫我們安排了行政樓的房型。
而且還送了兩款三合一的數據線作為入住小禮物，紅色的圓筒包裝非常喜慶。
當聽我説家人入住當天生日時，馬上聯繫廚房，還親自送來了生日蛋糕，非常精美且美味的蛋糕，從造型到口味到包裝，都給我們帶來了滿滿的驚喜和感動。
而且還有個細節也讓我很感動，等候辦理入住時，有一個五口之家的訂單出了些問題，沈經理在幫他們耐心處理時，讓工作人員拿了五瓶礦泉水。這種時刻為客户着想的經理，真的為酒店增色不少。

除了服務，酒店的環境也真心好。一直很喜歡蘇式園林，可惜疫情之後，很少能離滬，能在上海就身處園林建築，愜意滿滿。
朋友圈照片，有朋友問，是不是去了同裏退思園説環境看起來很像。感謝酒店老闆用心打造的園林式酒店，讓人身臨其境。

如果節假日酒店早餐能更合理，不用在門口等位；以及酒店泳池不是外包的話，體驗感會更接近完美。

瑕不掩瑜，服務繼續保持的話，應該會二刷三刷的。

游泳池、小童樂園、健身房這些好像都是第三方的，不像箇中高端酒店的配套，沒工服工牌、體驗較差、服務堪憂、態度生硬。房間裏公告提醒那邊晚上8點關門，結果7點半就被趕出來了。

下午去游泳，非常生硬的懟一句“7點半關門”、“沒有”、“不知道”！也不主動問需不需要浴巾，本以為像其他酒店一樣在更衣室裏有，結果衹能一身濕漉漉的回房間。

小童遊樂園，下午也是半開放、一半亮燈一半不亮，這可是大年初五啊，設施開關也不不開，比如小童轉盤。驅趕人的時候倒是無所不用其極，工作人員從監控裏看到有個看孩子的奶奶坐在轉盤上，毫無徵兆的直接打開旋轉電源驅趕，老奶奶腿腳不方便、險些造成意外，有一點人情味嗎？把老奶奶趕走後，小孩子們以為轉盤開了，都趕過來要玩，結果又被關上了，奇葩

服務基本沒有，沒有門僮，沒有車接送，門口的車是擺設。
服務人員整體水平不夠，睡覺的嘮嗑的啥樣都有。
有事情一問三不知，生怕多説一句給自己找活幹。
完美體現了整個管理團隊的水平。
結論:不推薦該酒店，對服務有點追求的不用過來了。
（有一説一，健身房和大堂咖啡吧的工作人員服務不錯。）

酒店是園林風格的 很特別 建築都古色古香的 很靜謐 很適合帶長者週末來散散心 
酒店裡🈶️個小小的小童樂園 面積不大 但是小朋友們消耗體力也是夠了 
早餐廳比較小 吃的東西選擇不多 不過人也不多 所以並沒有很擁擠 
服務總體還不錯 前台葛經理服務挺温馨的 
房間升級成了行政房 乾淨 還有加濕器 挺加分的 如果能有個陽台就更好了 現在是很高的窗户 有點擋住風景了 
總體是不錯的入住體驗

msg:上海這樣一個鬧市區裏，能有這樣一處讓人短時間脱離世俗的桃源所在，已屬不易。雖然這院子就在高架之下，雖然這場景就在快速道旁邊。但匠人的用心足以讓入住的人突然穿越，由此可獲一個贊。
遺憾的是，早飯的內容和環境差強人意，滿心歡喜一個夜晚的期待，會在擁擠、嘈雜的早餐中消失的無影無蹤，可惜，可惜。
偶然一住，在喧囂的城市裡找一處靜所，此處可作為備選。

1. 外部環境： 非常之一般，看不懂的粗糙園林，到處充斥着廉價、土氣。還有到處的腳手架，建築垃圾，和裝修的油漆味。
2. 服務：明明有房間，非要安排我們去又遠，房間潮濕陰暗，充斥着裝修味道的所謂行政房。前台房卡沒有刷好，開不開門，還要怪我們拿的卡不對，什麼邏輯！
3. 房間內部：不是很大，傢俱設備都是廉價的樣子。
4. 餐廳：一般。早飯也實在不怎麼樣。
總結：鄉村土豪風，以自己奇葩的審美重新定義了中式園林，徒有其“表”，內核還是農家樂檔次，失望！大家慎重選擇！

msg:早餐差的不行，住過的五星級酒店11歲以下小孩也衹收半價99元/位，這家超過1米4就按全價128元收，女兒才10歲，衹是人高一點而已就收了128元全價。關鍵早餐沒啥東西吃的，是我住過的酒店裡自助早餐最差的，估計水準連全季都不如。然後説服務，沒有服務可言，服務員跟你講話惜字如金，並且一個笑臉也沒有。衹有退房時前台有求要填一份滿意表時才熱情相迎，實在無語啊。我們訂了兩間家庭聯通房，中間有一次兩個房間房卡都刷不出，找前台解決，核對住客訊息時，居然一間房登記的不是我們的名字，完全不認識的陌生人名字，可見管理有多混亂。再説環境，除了古色古香的建築，花園也很小，但拍拍照也夠了。娛樂設施就更不談了，孩子説泳池的水很臟，潛下去水的能見度很低，水質渾濁，更衣室也是極其臟亂，跟普通的健身房的更衣室差不多。總之絕對不會再去第二次。
