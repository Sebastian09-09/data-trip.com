msg:Our stay at the J. Mountain hotel was beyond our wildest dreams. I rarely leave reviews but our 3 nights here were so stunningly exceptional that we felt driven to express our gratitude and appreciation for the stellar staff, service, and beautiful setting of this hidden gem of a hotel.

The service was without exception some of the best if not the best I have ever experienced at a hotel, and I travel often, having visited over 20 countries in the last few years alone and stayed at many beautiful and well-known five-star hotels and brands. Despite being a very young hotel (having just opened in September) J. Mountain Hotel holds its own and then some. It began months before our stay when we reached out to the hotel on WeChat to ask for guidance on equipment, tickets, and transportation. As we are visiting from America the area isn’t necessarily the easiest to access or plan for. Responses were almost immediate no matter when we reached out and always went above and beyond. For instance, my mother is nearly 70 and although very active was worried about slipping and falling while hiking in icier conditions; they offered to even purchase crampons for us should we wish although they advised us we would not need them for the time of year we were here (they were right). 

While here their thoughtfulness included texting us updates on and warning us about inclement weather while we were hiking around Huang Shan (there is cell service), drying and fluffing our wet gear when we returned from a particularly wet hike, and most astounding of all resolving an incredibly stressful issue we had with an upcoming flight that had been canceled (they suggested and secured alternative means of transport to a second city and then arranged for a different flight with the airline directly). 

We must specifically give our thanks to Hotel Manager Ryan, who is young but clearly extremely talented and excels in his role. He not only oversaw and proactively sought to help us on every front but was responsible for resolving our flight emergency. He also clearly had directed staff to help us to their utmost ability at all times, including having breakfast and dinner ready for and served to us at the times we requested. Ryan also personally met us and gave us a tour of the hotel and its history and design, as well as accompanied us to the art gallery and an evening tea tasting held in the gorgeous tea house on the grounds. He checked in with us every day and night and made sure everything was to our liking. 

Driver Wang Kai was our personal chauffer throughout the stay and was extremely courteous, professional, and attentive; he was always there to pick us up and see us off at multiple locations throughout our trip and not once were we ever allowed to wait. He even brought us hotel slippers and large down jackets to change into out of our soaking wet gear when picking us up at the end of a hike. When we said we did not think we would need some of the gear they offer their guests, we noticed he packed it in the car just in case we changed our minds and needed them later. 

I could literally go on and on but wanted to make sure I left room to appreciate how beautiful the hotel itself is and how much attention to detail has gone into its design and planning; at almost every turn we discovered something that added to the ease, enjoyment, and comfort of our stay. J. Mountain Hotel, thank you for one of the best experiences we have had in many, many years.

msg:This time I have to write a serious review, because this hotel is worth my effort.
Before coming to Huangshan, I compared all the hotels on the mountain. I felt that this one was good and the room was relatively large, so I chose it. The experience of staying for two days was very good. I sincerely recommend everyone to experience it.
The hotel is very new. It was opened last year. The supporting facilities are all state-of-the-art. All rooms are equipped with smart toilets, including public toilets.
The hotel is close to the scenic area and very close to the lower entrance of the Yuping Cableway. There are many attractions around that can be visited by yourself. I strolled around this morning. It is not inferior to the scenic area at all. The small bridges, flowing water and people are very comfortable and suitable for vacation travel.
I bought the pre-sale package. After buying it, I went directly to the order to make an appoin**ent for the check-in date. The package is not only very affordable, but also includes 2 bar drinks, 2 tea tastings, and a 2-person set meal. We stayed for two nights, and the dinner we had in Tangkou Town on the first day was too ordinary! After entering the hotel, we had dinner and lunch at the hotel. It was a very good set meal with four dishes, one soup and one snack. It was said that there were two chefs, one Cantonese chef and one Anhui chef, and their skills were not inferior to those of a five-star hotel! Breakfast is not a buffet, but there are Chinese and Western options for customers to choose from every day. We chose two Chinese and Western options on the first day, and two sets of Chinese options on the second day. They were all very rich and you could eat until you were full at every meal!
There is also a very suitable spot for traveling to Huangshan. The hotel is responsible for picking up and dropping off guests to the Huangshan bus station, and also picks up and drops off customers to scenic spots every day. Yesterday, we were equipped with hiking poles, which was very considerate. The hotel has three business cars to pick up and drop off customers, one Mercedes-Benz, one top-equipped Buick business car and one ordinary Buick.
The hotel is not big, but all the staff are well-trained, warm and friendly. It makes guests feel at home, and I like it very much!
There is also an art gallery next to the hotel, which exhibits various Huangshan paintings and is free to visit

msg:The hotel's pick-up service can go directly from the station to the hotel entrance. The driver is considerate and can always take us there safely and quickly. The service staff is also warm and friendly, and it feels like home. The hotel is in a unique location, not far from the Yuping Cableway. It can also be picked up to visit the back mountain. There are also hiking poles and hats available for borrowing at the front desk. The details are very thoughtful for the guests. The hotel has a good artistic a**osphere. You can taste tea at the Qihua Society in the art center, and there are also art exhibitions to visit. It's rare and pleasant to stay for a while listening to the sound of the waterfall and mountain spring. The complimentary double set meal and breakfast are large and delicious. I also like the souvenirs given by the hotel when I leave. I will choose to stay here again if I have the chance!

msg:Awesome hotel! The location is near the Yuping Cable Car. I mainly went to climb Tiandu Peak, so it was perfect for my trip. The owner has great taste. Whether it is interior design or the lobby and tea room, they are all decorated with great care. You can tell that he is a person who truly loves life. The hotel service is very good. The housekeeper Ms. Wang Ling and several other young ladies and the driver are all very nice. They gave a lot of advice, which was very helpful to me as a first-time traveler to Huangshan. Today is also a good day. Tiandu Peak is surrounded by a sea of ​​clouds, which is beautiful. If you want to climb Tiandu Peak, I recommend this hotel if your budget allows.

msg:After careful consideration, I chose this hotel halfway up the mountain. The hotel is located below the Yuping Cableway and has an exclusive parking lot in the town. After arriving, the GL8 will take you directly to the mountain. The trip is very smooth. You don't have to queue for the bus or endure the dizziness of the bus going around the mountain. The hotel's hardware facilities are in place. I think the reason why it is not listed as a five-star hotel may be because there is no swimming pool. The other hardware facilities are really not inferior to high-end five-star hotels. The room is large and comfortable, and the toiletries are a full set of Ferragamo. The only drawback is that the toothbrush is too hard. The most important thing is that the meals in the set meal are delicious, without any perfunctory. The staff basically responds to every request, and even prepares climbing poles and raincoats. They also give souvenirs before leaving. It is absolutely cost-effective!

msg:1. Excellent location, 3 minutes drive from Yuping Cableway. Just halfway up the mountain.
2. Enjoy the exclusive pick-up and drop-off service. Buick business cars will directly pick you up from Huangshan Management Committee to the hotel, saving the cost and time of queuing up to transfer to the bus on Huangshan to take the cableway. If you need to take any cableway the next day, you will be picked up by a special car. Also prepare hiking poles, so you don't need to worry about it at all.
3. The hotel has a good design and taste. It has a strong artistic a**osphere, and the decoration is very stylish, with clever use of camphor wood. The hotel has its own Huangshan Art Center, with 2 floors above and below, which collects calligraphy and painting works by famous and contemporary famous painters and calligraphers, and is a proper artistic influence.
4. The hotel is right in front of the hotel: the herringbone waterfall. The scenery is picturesque.
5. The service is impeccable. Breakfast is delivered to the room, and dinner is 4 dishes, one soup, drinks and desserts.
6. Qihuashe is a treasure teahouse. The little sister tea artist makes tea and introduces tea culture. There are all the boss's collections inside. Elegant and unique, listening to the sound of water and drinking a sip of tea, even the rainy Huangshan has a unique flavor, and people are instantly quiet.
7. The room comes with three kinds of tea: Huangshan Maojian, Houkui, and Qimei. Tea lovers don’t need to bring their own tea. It’s so considerate. Fruits and two bottles of soda water are delivered every day, and the brand is the famous Paris water. Toiletries: Lafite. After checking out, they also sent souvenirs thoughtfully, which is really thoughtful.
If you want to climb Huangshan, order it, order it! That’s it. After climbing Huangshan, you are so tired that you want to collapse. The hotel’s special car will pick you up and take you back, 3 minutes by car. Compared with those guests who queue up to transfer to the bus to go back to the hotel, this moment is really too happy.

The surrounding environment of the hotel is good. It is located next to the cableway in the scenic area and can be reached by car. Unlike the hotels on the mountain, you need to walk for a while, which is more friendly for bringing children. It is said that there is a special parking lot at the foot of the mountain for self-driving tourists; the housekeeper Wang Ling and the driver who picked up and dropped off are very good and responsive. The hotel's tea room is elegant and unique, and the tea artist Mu Xi is very professional. Although it rained heavily on the way to Huangshan, I was still very happy to have a comfortable stay.

The pick-up and drop-off station only needed to send the booking information to the front desk, which was very worry-free. Besides the hotel environment, it is facing the herringbone waterfall. You can feel the beautiful mountain scenery and fresh air on the balcony. There are different animal wood carvings at the door of the hotel room, which is interesting! When visiting Huangshan, the hotel provides maps, pick-up cableways, walking sticks (wooden walking sticks, those who have mountaineering requirements are advised to bring their own walking sticks) and raincoats. For our estimated climbing time, the hotel also advanced the breakfast time. Thank you very much for the hard work of the staff! The included dinner set is nutritious and replenishes physical strength, and there are cocktails from the bar🍸. Half of the time of this climb was accompanied by rain and fog, and I didn’t see anything. I will stay here again next time I have the opportunity. It is recommended to add a tissue box and a small trash can on the table in the bathroom, so that fallen hair, used facial masks, and cotton swabs can be placed~

msg:I just want to say that the trip was worthwhile😊
I suddenly wanted to go to the Sichuan-Tibet line in southern Anhui and climb Huangshan, so I searched for a suitable hotel on Ctrip. There are many hotels and homestays, and the prices are relatively normal. The old ones with good scenery are old, and the new homestays are in general location, nothing special. I finally found this hotel, and the price is indeed high😅Although there are few reviews, they are all very practical, so I decided to give it a try.
First of all, the service: it is really good, the communication is smooth, and basically everything is responsive. The hotel is in the scenic area, and a special car is arranged for pick-up. The driver, Master Xiao Wang, is very good, polite and enthusiastic. Give it a thumbs up!
Secondly, the hotel facilities and conditions: I travel a lot and have stayed in many hotels. I personally think I am a picky person, but the decoration, facilities and environmental a**osphere of this hotel are very good. The appearance of the hotel looks average, but after entering, the sense of luxury is enhanced. The lobby is not big but full of design, clean and tidy; the hotel has 43 rooms as a whole, and the hotel staff can be said to be a butler-style service, and the privacy is still good; the room is not big but the scenery is beautiful! Lying in bed, you can see the mountains and waterfalls in the distance, or you can sit on the balcony to enjoy the beautiful scenery, accompanied by afternoon tea, that feeling is really great! (I forgot to mention that the hotel breakfast is also good and can be delivered to the room. Sitting on the balcony to eat breakfast and look at the waterfall is a nice experience!) Overall, this hotel is very suitable for families, couples and friends to travel. Even if I don’t go to Huangshan and stay in the hotel for a day, I am willing to do it 😀😀I really like the casual, simple and luxurious a**osphere, and it is also super photogenic!

On the last day of our trip to the ancient city of Huizhou, we also waited with the car. Thank you for your hard work, Master Xiao Wang!
The location of the hotel is very good, halfway up the mountain, with the Yuping Cableway in the background, and it takes less than five minutes to walk there. The interior of the hotel is very designed and has a Japanese resort style. The rooms are spacious and comfortable for a family of three. Hotel supplies, automatic bathrooms, hardware and soft furnishings are all satisfactory.
The room has a balcony, facing Tiandu Peak and the Herringbone Waterfall. The view is quite good. Unfortunately, it is the dry season and there is no water in the Herringbone Waterfall.
The food at the hotel is also surprising. The two complimentary dinners are rich and delicious, and the breakfast has Chinese and Western sets to choose from. We are a family of three, and the complimentary meals are all set for two, but the hotel also gives an extra set for the children, which is very thoughtful!
Before leaving, I was given a generous souvenir to express my gratitude to the hotel for its thoughtful and generous hospitality! Next time I come to Huangshan, I will definitely choose Shui Shuishi Shanfang!

This is the first time I have experienced a home-like travel experience. .
The meal includes breakfast and a main meal. The dishes are not repeated on the two days. Breakfast is especially recommended for the best taste.
This time, it was sunny during the two days we stayed, so I was not able to see the sea of ​​clouds and the flowing water of the Herringbone Waterfall in Huangshan.

msg:A family of four stayed in a double bed, and the bed was big enough. The room faces the Herringbone Waterfall in Huangshan Mountain, and apart from the sound of gurgling water, there is no other disturbance. The air conditioning is sufficient and the quilt is a bit thick. The TV in the room is very unique, and it also comes with a Kiwi membership, which was a pleasant surprise. From the lobby to the restaurant, from the public areas on the floors to the balconies of the rooms, there are small embellishments and decorations everywhere, and you can feel the hotel's unique aesthetic.

Although there is no public transportation at the door, the hotel's butler service is very considerate. The driver can take you directly to the cable car station, saving you the trouble of squeezing the bus. It is also very convenient to go to Tangkou Town to eat. There is a dedicated parking lot for the hotel, so you don’t have to worry about parking when traveling by car.

We were afraid of the crowds in Huangshan on October 1, so the hotel thoughtfully packed breakfast and sent us to the cable car station at around 6 o'clock. There was almost no queue the whole time. We got on the cable car and contacted the housekeeper when we got off the mountain. When we got out of the station, we saw the driver who picked us up. He took great care of our tired legs after coming down from the mountain!

The most touching thing was that our child caught a cold and had a fever in the rain, so the hotel arranged for a driver to take us to buy medicine, watermelon, and ice packs. Before we left, we were given biscuits made by the hotel to eat on the road, which really impressed me. I don’t usually like to write reviews for others, so I have to like them manually.

By the way, it is not unusual for breakfast to be provided in the room. But it’s rare to have a normal meal every day and a different menu every day. Qihua Club under the hotel must also be mentioned. The environment is beautiful, the tea is delicious, the tea masters are gentle and gentle, and there is no noise around. In a word, we will choose this place again next time we come to Huangshan.

And the best thing is the airport pick-up (drop-off) service, and it is equipped with a luxury car for pick-up and drop-off, which is really thoughtful! The driver is kind and friendly, making you feel like an old friend at first sight. Because we had to change our travel destination midway, the hotel’s CEO gave special permission to send us to the next hotel for free, a distance of nearly 40 kilometers. It was really touching! Let’s talk about the hotel’s environment and catering. The hotel has a sense of design and a strong artistic a**osphere. The decoration is relatively high-end, quiet and comfortable. It is equipped with high-end tea refreshments. I have learned tea art. It can be said that among the five-star hotels I have stayed in The hotel has never been equipped with such good tea. I asked the restaurant for a sample of the same tea, which cost more than 400 yuan. It can be seen that the hotel is not ordinary 👍. The catering is also exquisite and delicious. Both Chinese and Western food are made to five-star standards, even better. In short, it is a great experience and we will take care of you in all aspects!

msg:This trip to Huangshan Mountain encountered a typhoon, but we went up the mountain for two consecutive days, rode the ropeway, saw the Welcome Pine, and climbed Guangmingding Peak. This is all thanks to our hotel:
1 The hotel's location is only a five-minute walk from the Qianshan Cableway. It is very convenient to go up the mountain. The scenic spot is closed due to typhoon weather. The hotel staff kept an eye on the latest information for us, and sent us to the entrance of the ropeway as soon as it opened, and we caught up with the first one to get on the ropeway.
2. Because of its location on the mountainside, the hotel occupies a small area, but the room has a good view. You can see the Herringbone Falls from the balcony or lying on the bed. On rainy days, the waterfall becomes even bigger and flows down. Room facilities
toto bathroom, automatic toilet, Ferragamo toiletries, bathtub, as well as black tea, green tea, fruit for stay, etc., free mini bar Sprite and Coke, Samsung TV can cast the screen
3. The butler-style service in the hotel is great. All the staff are warm and friendly, always greeting you with a smile. When it rains, you will help prepare raincoats when you go out. When you come back from the rainy mountain, you will be given ginger tea immediately, and handmade cookies will be given as a gift when you leave. Very thoughtful. It is not convenient to eat near the hotel. There is a restaurant in the hotel that can provide Chinese and Western food, Anhui cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. It is very convenient. We ate four or five meals at different times. They tasted good and each meal was on a CD.

msg:I took a dip in the spa pool on the 8th floor of the hotel early in the morning and was immediately immersed in the mountains and rivers. It was wonderful. At sunset, I sat outside the red wine and cigar bar on the 6th floor and admired the splashing Herringbone Falls and the straight Tiandu Peak. As well as the jade screen cableway that slides up and down, the movement and stillness continue, which is breathtaking. This hotel is indeed unique, and the experience of staying here is truly unforgettable and beautiful. 👍

msg:The service in this hotel is really top notch! For the special car transfer, I thought it was only from the foot of the mountain to the hotel, but later I found out that it can pick up and drop off anywhere in Huangshan City or surrounding scenic spots, which is more than 50 kilometers away! Moreover, the Huangshan Mountain Climbing Hotel also provides VIP access, so there is no need to queue, which is great👍
The location of the hotel is also very good. It is opposite the Herringbone Falls and you can see it from the bed. There is also a Peach Blossom Creek in front of the hotel. The scenery is beautiful and the environment is quiet, which is very suitable for relaxing.

There is a three-story calligraphy and painting collection exhibition hall with a quiet and elegant tea room for guests to enjoy. There are handmade art sculptures in the corridors and doorways of the guest rooms. They are very compact. If you like them, you can buy them. Of course, they are expensive. The interior of the room is simple and high-end, and the bedding is exquisite and comfortable.
The room rate is a bit expensive, but it includes a quick dinner and all pick-up and drop-off services during the stay. The hotel has 6 Mercedes-Benz and Buick commercial vehicles dedicated to serving guests. If you have any questions, please contact the housekeeper. The service is attentive and attentive, making you feel at home.
Conclusion: Value for money, I will stay there next time.

第一次遊黃山，管家汪玲耐心解答我的問題，幫忙規劃行程，推薦的山頂酒店白雲賓館地理位置優越，基本上無需走回頭路。
酒店處於黃山山腰，正對人字瀑，景色非常優美。管家幫我升級為觀瀑大床房，躺在床上就可以觀賞瀑布美景。從黃山下來當天有雷暴雨，回酒店泡過熱水澡躺在床上觀雨聽瀑非常愜意。
酒店的餐食精緻美味，我家挑嘴的姑娘都“哇唔”驚歎不已。
晴朗天氣時人字瀑中間的大巖山像極了萌物-兔猻，暴雨過後人字瀑肥壯了許多，打開陽台門，轟鳴聲鋪面而來，閉上眼真正睡在了風景裏。
