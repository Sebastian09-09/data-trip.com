msg:On the first or second day of the Chinese New Year in the Year of the Tiger in 2022, a unicorn is born. I think back then, the gold and iron horses swallowed thousands of miles like a tiger...

Staying in Qilin Villa, you will have quite a private national-level 5A scenic spot and enjoy the "Summer Palace" royal garden-style greening...

A health resort, with small houses and large land, low buildings and wide sky, green mountains and green waters, smoked willows and painted bridges, wind curtains and emerald curtains, climbing high and looking far, mountains and mountains, beautiful mountains and rivers, lakes and mountains, just like a picture of "A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains" right in front of you ...

Unlike other five-star high-end hotels in the city, the transportation is not convenient, the decoration is not novel, the rooms are a bit old, the dining is simple, the business is not dominant, and the entertainment facilities are scarce...

It is better than the natural landscape, which is a bit "rime fog, sky and clouds, mountains and water, white up and down. The shadows on the lake are just a trace of the long embankment, a small pavilion in the center of the lake, a mustard with Yu Zhou, and two or three grains of people in the boat." travel feeling...

The win lies in customer service. Except for the security guards who seem to be a bit strict in management due to the epidemic situation, everyone is enthusiastic in their service, showing a national level of hospitality. There are welcome fruit and health tea, and there are rich snacks for children...

We need to thank Ms. An, the room service, and other colleagues who have taken the trouble to provide various items, move the bed, help turn the bed down, etc. After noon, Ms. Chen in the Chinese restaurant on the first floor insists on patient, meticulous, attentive and courteous service, which is especially important here. The manager Wang Jiren is commended. From helping check-in at the front desk to carrying luggage into the room, he accompanied the whole process and carefully introduced the various facilities and room types of the villa. He provided 24-hour check-in butler service, and at the end saw him off in the car and carried luggage. The ability and management level of excellent practitionersüëçüëç

Life is like a journey against the road, and I am also a pedestrian.

When will I go back and be an idler. For a bed, a pot of tea, and a stream of clouds.

Shenzhen, the best here!
