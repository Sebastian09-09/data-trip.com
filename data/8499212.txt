The check-in experience is particularly smooth and can be said to be a benchmark for luxury brands. There is a front desk manager as a butler to prepare thoughtful services, contact in advance and pay attention after check-in. The experience is too much! In short, the surprise and experience brought by the service are worth the money, highly recommended!

The courtyard gate is closed and it is isolated from the hustle and bustle outside. The room facilities are also great. It was my daughter's birthday during my stay, and the staff made careful arrangements, and the child received a surprise.

I will contact the guest before entering the hotel to understand the guest's purpose and situation. I have a courier that will help me collect it at the hotel and then deliver it to the room according to my requirements. Ella added me on WeChat, her attitude was very kind and lovely, and she fulfilled all the responsibilities that a professional hotel manager should perform, which was a great addition to the impression of the hotel; because Ella had a rest that day, the person who helped me check in was Ella‚Äôs leader. Jamie, the whole process was very orderly, and after a quick check-in, he took me to the restaurant for dinner. The food in the restaurant cannot be complimented. I have a pragmatic attitude. If the restaurant was more professional and better, it would be even better! However, we don‚Äôt expect too much from Beijing‚Äôs Western food environment. After dinner, a girl took us to the courtyard. It was very close. The courtyard of the courtyard was a little deserted, but the room was large and the layout and furnishings were great. If the bedroom and living room could be separated during the design, we would feel more secure. Some people, because they have friends here, feel uncomfortable with the bed being displayed in a big way. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast is very rich, and you can also choose to have it delivered to the room. The staff is very hard and attentive in moving the dining table in and out. The dazzling array of things on the table is worthy of praise! When we left the hotel, he patiently listened to all our experiences and opinions, and also gave us Waldorf Astoria bears and pens as souvenirs!

This time I lived in a courtyard house and a 270-degree view room, each with its own advantages. I also gave a cute little bear from Waldorf, which my children like very much.

I would like to make two small comments: First, there are four guest rooms in a courtyard, which offers slightly less privacy, and the courtyard is not fully utilized, making it appear a bit empty. Second, the hotel's gym is a bit cramped and the equipment is not comprehensive enough (for example, I couldn't find a leg-training equipment).

The traditional courtyard combined with the exquisite interior of the room is a very special experience. Welcome fruits and desserts with flowers, praise.
Wang Rui's service is proactive, kind, thoughtful, and just right. He is not a young staff member, but his gentleman makes me give this hotel a lot of points.
It is worth mentioning that the faucet in the room is the worst in the five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. The very obvious and dirty water stains made me mistakenly think that it was not cleaned. Later, I tried to wipe it and couldn‚Äôt wipe it off. .

There are four rooms in the whole courtyard, two rooms facing north and south, and two rooms in the east and west wings. We booked the best of the four rooms. The main room on the first floor happened to be unbooked that day, and the whole courtyard was booked out by us. The room is spacious and fully equipped. Ferragamo‚Äôs toiletries are used. The breakfast is very rich. The courtyard leads to the main building. There is a dark passage.
The service is super considerate, from the birthday decoration of the room, to the welcome fruit snacks, to the birthday cake greeting card, it reflects the hotel's care everywhere. Because the hotel swimming pool is not open on the second floor due to the epidemic, the entertainment service staff Vicky accompanied him to the Hilton swimming pool across the street. The room manager Simon and the courtyard housekeeper, Mr. Bi, also enthusiastically introduced the allusions of the courtyard house and presented warm small gifts, which made people feel happy. Really felt at home, a great stay experience.

msg:The location is relatively hidden, and the small yard is quite comfortable to live in. It's a little easier to book than before the epidemic. But in the suite I live in on the second floor, the door is not easy to open or close. Turning on the lights in the house can only be fully turned on, or all turned off, which is inconvenient. The service is quite good, and the sanitation is also good, after all, the price is here.

The location is close to Wangfujing Commercial Street, which is very convenient. The staff are very nice, especially Simon and Judy, who are very helpful. Patient and responsive. thank you very much. For dinner, I chose Zijin Pavilion, which specializes in Cantonese cuisine. The taste is very good. I will try tea at noon next time. The breakfast was served in the room, and the staff helped set up the table, which was also very good. All in all a very satisfying experience.

Simon, the floor manager, explained the origin of the courtyard and showed us all the courtyards, with blue bricks and red tiles, full of happiness, and will come again next time. Gustav sent luggage, helped with consignment, and the concierge helped hand over items, all in place! Looking forward to seeing you next time!

msg:When midnight is approaching, I'm about to start spitting out. Tonight is the Beijing Waldorf Astoria Hutong Courtyard. The room rate of more than 6,000 a night can be regarded as the price of a top domestic hotel. As a result, apart from the location in Wangfujing, Li Hongzhang's former residence was remodeled, and he really couldn't find the third bright spot.
First choice, the front desk takes me to the hotel, you look all kinds of unhappy, you don‚Äôt introduce anything when you arrive in the room, and you have to leave when the door is closed. The room card is not intended to be given to me. I asked for the room card, and he remembered to give it to me. Then left desperately.
The bellman was carrying the luggage, and he was carrying the suitcase with the trolley when crossing the steps. I would like to ask, if you break the suitcase, should I make you pay or not.
There is no welcome fruit or welcome drink in the room. The courtyard is very cold. Recently, Beijing has cooled down again. I turned on the radiator before I went out. Turning the bed down, I turned off all the radiators that I turned on, but I didn't clean up any of the used water cups on the table. There are no turn-down snacks or gifts.
The courtyard is a small alley separated from the main building. My girlfriend and I found that the door could not be opened in the room. We called the front desk and waited for an hour without anyone. We lay on the window and waited until someone passed by, handed out the room card through the door, and he opened the door for me from the outside. Then I called to the reception desk to lose my temper. After 20 minutes, someone finally came. It turned out that there was a small switch. The staff who took me to the room didn't say anything.
The facilities in the room are also difficult to describe. They look beautiful. You have to drill into the cabinet to plug in when you boil water. There is no instruction manual for the speakers and the display is the same. The desk cannot find the power plug. The flowers in the bathroom are actually fake flowers. Maybe they think it is a display of art. Anyway, this is the first time I have seen fake flowers in this class of hotel.
The bathroom is also very strange. The large suites are still single bathrooms. The linen is also in the minimum quantity. The shower room's shower water output is at the level of the bed and breakfast. It is hard to imagine that it was produced by Waldorf Astoria.
Really, I very much suspect that Waldorf has built this Hutong Siheyuan Hotel to recruit ********s. Do you really want to sell this room? It's the man of shame by Hilton!
