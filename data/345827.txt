msg:"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Shanghai Marriott Marquis Hotel , and I must say, the experience was nothing short of wonderful. From its strategic location along the serene riverside to the beautifully maintained surroundings, the hotel offers a perfect blend of convenience and tranquility. The cleanliness of the hotel deserves a special mention as it met all my expectations for a five-star establishment.
The breakfast selection was diverse and delicious, catering to all tastes with both local and international options available. It was a great start to the day, energizing me for my adventures around Shanghai.
Most importantly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Cora, the front desk manager, who went above and beyond to upgrade our room to a double bed setup. Her kindness and professionalism significantly enhanced our stay, making it truly memorable. Cora's warm welcome and exceptional service are commendable and reflect the high standards of hospitality at Marriott.
Thank you, Shanghai Marriott Marquis Hotel , for a delightful stay. I look forward to returning soon!"

Daisy assisted me with my check-in and offered to add me on WeChat in case I required any assistance during my trip. I asked for a view with the Pearl tower and was able to get one. Concierge service is also top notch. Everyone was so helpful and you could tell that they were actually really happy to help in any way they can. Would recco to stay here, especially for first time travellers. I even got help with my food and Taobao deliveries from Colin (Concierge). 

The room itself was clean, cozy, spacious and has everything you need. Plus a super good view. I overslept on my check-out day and requested for late check-out, the staff were also quick to assist to my request. In short, I would definitely be back to stay at this hotel again when I’m back in Shanghai. Super good hospitality + great location + comfortable room! :)

There is no spa despite being advertised online, on the hotel website AND in the room. When I spoke to the manager about my disappointment, he told me to just use another one in the local area. Also, there’s no personal touch here like at other Marriotts- no one said hello, helped with my suitcase or greeted me whenever I returned to the hotel.  I usually feel ‘special’ when using this brand of hotel- but not this time. On a positive note, it’s beautiful and in a great location. I loved the bath in the room and the great breakfast.

We didn't have the buffet breakfast but there are tons of shopping and food all around the hotel.

When I check-out, the last word staff said was “payment is done” without eyecontact or saying goodbye, thank you. Normally few person stay at the lobby to help you. Usually there is no person at the door. Mood in the lobby is depressing. Gate facing main road is closed in the morning and late night. 
This hotel is just like 3-star quality business hotel near nanjing east road with 5-star luxury hotel price. 
I would not choose or recommend this hotel for Shanghai travel.

Location is good however when it’s late at night
There is nothing much to eat nearby. Supper spots per se

Breakfast has good spread. If you are in executive room you can enjoy the executive spread, which is lesser than the main breakfast restaurant, but it’s a good alternative if you want lesser crowd.

Overall good stay.

You would expect that when the check in time is as late as 16:00 and check out is at 12:00 that your room would be ready by the said time but i had to wait till nearly 19:30 to get into my room. At first i was simply offered drink vouchers that only included soft drinks etc. But then when I further complained i was offered free breakfast for the following day. The line at the lobby for check in was very slow and you could observe the inexperience amongst the staff while waiting. I also overheard a manager telling another guest waiting for their delayed room that there was a queue of 31 rooms waiting which was very disconcerting to hear. I understand that it’s busy season but the hotel needs to be better-prepared for such occasions. Hopefully they can improve their overall efficiency and/or train their staff a little better.

The toilet became clogged. Staff arrived immediately to unclog.
The manager was not upfront about charges for breakfast and pretended to be doing us a favor however this is an insult and we felt slited.  Best management be upfront with foreign guests as we do not enjoy pretentious service. Be direct honest and dignified in transactions and do not pretend to be doing us a favor when in fact you being disingenuous.

Also there is city tour bus ticket office across the New World Department store next to the hotel. The service was good and breakfast was served not only American style but also Chinese style, it was very satisfying. There is also swimming pool with zakooji and sauna rooms. My family enjoyed staying at this hotel and had a good time at Shanghai.

If a hotel offer this service they need to be sure that there are enough chefs to cook the food needed, i waited 15 min on a simple egg and had to skipped potatoes and bacon as it  was taken by other guest standing ready as vultures with their small lunchboxes, emptying the trays as quickly as the staff filled it up 
On the 2. day it was the same, nightmare + all coffee machine was out of ordre for +20minuttes as there was no staff to maintain them with water and beans 
I will stay at the hotel again as it a nice hotel with a good location but i will for sure NEVER include breakfast in my booking.

I was happy to find staff that were able to assist and communicate in English. The a la carte menu in the room makes it easy to order food or drinks that can be delivered in the course of 24 hours of the day. The amenities such as gym, sauna, swimming pool and steambath are available untill 11 pm each day. This provides flexible hours for those who need to excersise and keep fit regularly. I needed to extend my saty for a few more days and the process was seemless. Thanks to the front desk staff who were able to answer my questions and communicate  in English. The location is great and one is able to walk to the Bund amd explore areas near People's square while strolling around. The room service staff do an excellent job ensuring the room is kept emmaculately clean.

When they see guests walking in a hurry, they will quickly help open the small doors on both sides of the electric revolving door in the hotel lobby, because people in a hurry will not waste time waiting for the electric door to turn around before entering. The hotel breakfast is separated from Chinese and Western, which is very convenient. The ingredients are clean and fresh. I especially praise that the beef brisket noodles are delicious 😋 The location of the hotel is also good. The back door is the New World Shopping Mall, and it is a ten or twenty-minute walk from Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. I will choose to stay here next time I go to Shanghai.

msg:I was quite satisfied with my stay this time. The front desk lady was very enthusiastic to assist with various formalities. The room was generally good. It has a relatively high cost-effectiveness in this geographical location. It is very convenient to go anywhere. It takes a few steps to Nanjing Road and the Bund at night to rest. The breakfast is good and the lounge food is satisfactory. It is one of the preferred hotels for traveling in Shanghai. The only suggestion is that the elevator software should be updated.

Lena at the front desk provided excellent service and helped us upgrade to the top floor business room with the best view for free. Shopping and dining are also very convenient, and Nanjing Pedestrian Street is just across the road. This hotel is the most comfortable of all the hotels I booked on this trip.

In short, Marriott is the best choice for families with two children

When checking in, the front desk was very enthusiastic and upgraded to the room on the 26th floor for free. The view was very good. They also gave the children breakfast, which was great! Because the flight was in the afternoon, the front desk allowed a late check-out. Highly recommended! Very satisfied!

I also liked Marriott’s consistent high quality. As soon as I entered the door, the service attitude at the front desk was very warm and good, and everything was provided. I received clear instructions, the room was large in size, and the three-piece suite with floor-to-ceiling windows provided an unobstructed view of the high-altitude scenery. Later, I went to experience the executive lounge on the 37th floor. There are rich hot food dishes. I especially praised Miss Ruby in the executive lounge for the taste of the specially prepared fruit wine. It's very soft and gentle. The final breakfast has a rich selection and is quite rich. There are also many Shanghai-style breakfasts. Overall, it is a very good Marriott hotel.

1. Service: Super good👍
2. Lobby: General
3. Hygiene: General
4. Facilities: super poor

6. From my personal point of view, I can only say that people’s experience index in Shanghai is too low. The same 2,000 yuan hotel should be able to take off comfortably in other cities. I like staying at Marriott, but Shanghai Marriott will no longer patronize me.

However, there was a problem with the Ctrip system. One of the rooms I booked was a packed breakfast, but the system did not list it separately. The hotel also called to inform me and helped me upgrade the normal dine-in breakfast. Since the two rooms are not on the same floor, Tina at the front desk helped me upgrade the floor to the same floor. The room and bed are also very large, very suitable for sleeping with children.

The swimming pool is very good and very suitable for children. The breakfast is also divided into Chinese and Western areas. The bedding and hygiene are the usual high quality of Marriott. Because this store has attracted Marriott fans, I want to stay in Marriott in Nanjing, but I found that there is no suitable location. I hope Marriott can open more places~ The air in the room is also very good, and the bathroom is clean.
The hotel is very international. The front desk staff speaks English better than me and is very patient. I also alarmed three service staff to help me borrow a charging cable. They help manage express delivery and luggage when entering and leaving the store. It is well organized and the service is professional and enthusiastic.
Of course, the most important thing is that this store is so high-quality and has a good location. Nanjing Road, the Bund, People's Square, Shanghai High-speed Railway Station, and major depar**ent stores are close at hand. The price is also very beautiful. It is highly recommended.

msg:During the Qingming Festival, my son proposed to go to Shanghai City Walk, and my wife asked to find a better hotel. The first hotel I thought of was Agile Marriott, because we had stayed there before. It has an excellent location, convenient transportation, large room, very comfortable bedding, and more importantly, warm and thoughtful service. This time, the experience was as good as always. What impressed me more was that the hotel's service was further improved. Before we arrived, the hotel's duty manager Cora had called to inquire about the itinerary, arranged the room in advance, upgraded it, gave us breakfast, and other unexpected care. Although this City Walk was only two days and one night, Agile Marriott allowed me to experience the charm and warmth of this city more closely. I look forward to walking in Shanghai again on the next holiday and making an appoin**ent with Agile Marriott again.

The lady at the front desk was very helpful and upgraded our room for free. We could see the Shanghai three-piece suite. The decoration of the hotel is relatively simple and clean. There are many kinds of breakfast. The hotel is in an excellent location. , I finally walked back after going out several times. My son was very happy living here. He will book here again next time he comes!

The location of this Yajue Marriott is in the center of Shanghai, not far from Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. The hotel service is considerate, and the lady at the front desk also sent welcome fruits when checking in. The room is very clean and the facilities are also complete. It can be seen that the management process is very good. I have always liked Marriott's big bed, which is very comfortable. A good choice for business trips and rest. The surprise is that this hotel is adjacent to Huanghe Road, where the popular TV series "Fanghua" was located some time ago. I went there to check in at night! Very satisfied! I will choose Marriott next time!

msg:I chose Agile Marriott, firstly because it is a trustworthy Marriott brand, and secondly because the hotel’s single bed is much wider than other old five-star beds, which is very beneficial for family travel. In addition, the location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to go to the Grand Theater to watch performances, go to Nanjing Road for shopping, and go to the Bund and Suzhou River citywalk. After checking in, the front desk was very nice and offered a free upgrade to a room on the 27th floor with a great view. You can see the Pudong trio, the sunrise and sunset...nearby is the New World City. Nanjing Road is full of lights at night, which is very suitable for filming. The hotel restaurant is very large, divided into two restaurants on the left and right. You have to walk a lot to get food, haha. The breakfast is rich in variety and I feel full every time. After eating, go to the gym. The facilities in the gym are quite good. Next time I go to Shanghai, I’ll choose Agile Marriott~

Advantages
1. Convenient transportation
When entering Hongqiao Airport, you can take Line 2 at once.
However, you can get off and tour the surrounding area on foot for at least 500m.
2. Best place for shopping
Shinsegae Depar**ent Store Jeil Depar**ent Store
The best place in Korea, bigger than Myeongdong
The Bund is within walking distance
3. Variety of breakfast
Breakfast is divided into traditional Chinese and Western style.
It's delicious in its own way

disadvantage
1. Crowded city center, which is a disadvantage
It's very crowded when you take a taxi.
2. It’s a popular hotel so there are a lot of people.
Breakfast crowded

If you look at the photo below, there are a lot of people in the parking lot in the morning.

Because of the weather, I took my two children to contact the hotel in advance. AYS-Tina added WeChat, and the transportation routes and local weather conditions were linked at any time. . Sunny was the receptionist at the front desk. She very considerately upgraded the room type for me and my two children and arranged a room with a good location. The check-in was quick and made me feel at home. The whole check-in process felt like this location was very good. Great. First of all, it is close to the subway. People's Square is also an interchange station for several lines. It is connected to the pedestrian street, the Bund, Jing'an Temple, the Museum of Natural History, and the Shanghai Museum. I personally think that the pedestrian street is too commercial and noisy. Opposite the hotel It’s the New World Depar**ent Store, and I unexpectedly discovered that it’s right next to Huanghe Road (the place where flowers check in) and the International Hotel. Different from the pedestrian street businesses, this is a time-honored brand of old Shanghai. All in all, it is highly recommended for parents and children. Firstly, it is within walking distance to places to go out for fun. Secondly, it has a concentration of time-honored food restaurants. Every place is great. You will definitely not be disappointed if you go there. It’s great. Third, the hotel's high-end service facilities are in place, the room equipment is very easy to use, the air-conditioning temperature is very stable, the bed is large, and the sound insulation is very good, so you don't have to worry about being noisy. It saves you all kinds of worries and is very comfortable.

Although this year’s Chinese New Year is coming to an end, the Chinese New Year feast in the hotel lobby is still very beautiful. I contacted Judy in advance before bringing my family here, hoping to help us arrange the room. I am very satisfied with Judy's arrangement. The room is big and beautiful. Near the hotel is Nanjing's pedestrian street. Although the New Year is almost over, there are still many people on the street.

While eating and playing, we walked through the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street to Baidu Commercial Building and turned right to reach the hotel. The hotel is also very close to Huanghe Road, the popular spot for Internet celebrities. We also went to the Yangtze River Theater to watch the Happy Twist Show. There was a small incident at the end. I accidentally dropped my Bluetooth headset in the room. After contacting the hotel, the staff responded within two minutes and helped to deliver it to my home.

As a five-star hotel, the toilet is not smart. The room is very large, half of the area is the corridor. Breakfast was crowded because of the Spring Festival. The little Chaos was delicious, but there was really nothing else to eat. The location is pretty good. Others, really. I couldn't find any other highlights. The rooms are probably all fully booked, seeing as other people's rooms were upgraded and we didn't get to enjoy it.

msg:The hotel is very suitable for family travel. I brought my two children to Shanghai for a casual walk.
First of all, the beds are relatively large. When I made the reservation, I took a fancy to two 1.4-meter beds. After moving in, the width was really suitable. The two large and two small children did not feel crowded.
Secondly, the service is great. The original package included two breakfasts. The front desk helped upgrade the room and provided two additional breakfasts, eliminating the trouble of taking the baby out for breakfast. And the breakfast is very rich, with a lot of Chinese and Western food.
Third, the location is very convenient. It only takes ten minutes to take a taxi from Shanghai Station. The subway is also very convenient. Opposite the hotel is Nanjing Road. When taking the kids shopping, the second child, who is five years old, can go back to the hotel to sleep at any time. After staying for three days and two nights, the second child took a nap for both days, which did not affect the elder's shopping, which is very convenient.
Fourth, it is relatively quiet. Although it is in a bustling commercial center, there is no sound at all when sleeping at night. It is very suitable for people who are sensitive to sound.
Finally, I would like to mention something that I think needs improvement. The bathtub does not have a disposable bathtub cover, which makes bathing a bit inconvenient.

msg:The location is very good, with the flowery business district downstairs, and within a few steps you can reach the Moss Holy Garden where the flowers were filmed. You can also take a walk to the Suzhou River to see various pop-ups at Joy City. It meets the requirements of the three generations of old, middle-aged and young people.
The hotel room is spacious, the cleaning is in place, the wet and dry baths are separated, and the ventilation effect is great.
The bed in the twin room is very wide, ranging from 1.2 to 1.3 by visual inspection. My daughter and I slept well in the same bed.
The breakfast is rich, with both Chinese and Western options. Shanghai rice soup and wontons are delicious.
The special sauces in the executive lounge are delicious and the pastries are also exquisite and delicious.
The only drawback is that I hope the executive lounge can extend the dinner time. I wanted to go there for a drink after 8 o'clock in the evening, but there were no fruits and side dishes, so it was a bit monotonous.
Finally, I would like to give special praise and thanks to the front desk staff. I checked in very late and still received warm help and considerate service. Thank you to Miss Koi at the front desk. 🌹🌹🌹

I was not disappointed when I came. Although the check-in time was 4 p.m., Miss Rita at the front desk helped to find a solution and checked in early, which made the beginning of the trip very pleasant. The room was in good condition, clean and tidy, and the bed was more spacious, with four pillows on one bed. But this may sacrifice space on the bedside table, so if one person needs to charge their phone next to the pillow while sleeping, the other person can only put it on the table. Check-out was handled by Mark, who was very efficient and even gave me a small gift. It was a perfect check-in experience~

msg:The experience of staying at the Shanghai Marriott Marquis Hotel Agile was extremely pleasant. From the moment you step into the hotel lobby, you can feel the warm and thoughtful service. The hotel rooms are spacious and bright, elegantly and comfortably decorated, and the bedding is soft and comfortable, allowing you to have a good night's sleep. What's more worth mentioning is that the hotel staff are very professional and friendly. They can always meet the guests' needs at the first time, making people feel extra warm. I had a really great time here and highly recommend it to everyone!

msg:The hotel is very close to People's Square and the transportation is very convenient! Parking is 80 yuan/day! The breakfast has been the worst among the five-star hotels since I stayed here. There are only 2-3 stir-fried dishes and very few varieties of Chinese and Western snacks! The service was average. I went there on my birthday and was promised a small cake. In fact, it was only the size of a small bowl. When I checked in, I emphasized that it would be delivered before 10 o'clock. However, I called at 9:30 to tell them that it would be done until 11. Delivered on order! Delay time, otherwise it will not be delivered! The experience of staying here was extremely bad. It was the end of October when the seasons changed. Although the air conditioner was not turned on, the fresh air could not be turned off and it was very cold. The heating was not easy to turn on. I was so cold that I shivered on the first day and did not sleep well all night. I asked for 2 quilts. The extra quilt should be a down jacket that is the same as the one in the hotel. The weight of the 2 quilts was just right, but I found a particularly heavy quilt from somewhere. It was so heavy that I didn’t add it. It was so cold, so covered and pressed that I couldn't move. I couldn't say anything, so I barely fell asleep! What a service! I took out the dirty towels on the first day and didn't replace them on the second day. I came back late at night and was too embarrassed to ask for them, so the two of us had to make do with one.

Service: I checked in with a foreigner friend. I had to wait for at least an hour and a half when he got a room. They said it was being cleaned! The clean bathtub was extremely dirty inside and I don't quite understand why! Differentiated management?

After I complained about the hygiene, everyone I contacted asked me what was wrong. If there was a problem, there should be better communication instead of asking me. I originally decided not to say anything, but the follow-up service staff was not good, so this comment is somewhat personal. But overall it's fair.

The overall experience is not good. I don’t recommend it very much because I didn’t feel very good when I checked in for the first time. It’s really not as good as Shangri-La. The price is about the same and the location is worse than here. And it's really disgusting! ! !

You can make personalized requests to the hotel, such as cleaning supplies, children's bathrobes, and bath towels. Subject to the prerequisites that the hotel can arrange, room type and floor upgrades, late check-out, etc. can be provided.
Facilities: There is a swimming pool, so I took the kids to play. I met old people and foreigners who came to exercise. There were relatively few people and there were lifeguards, but I hope parents can take care of their children.

Because I needed to know the surrounding environment and transportation of the hotel in advance, after leaving a message on the reservation platform, the hotel's service staff Mr. Jack Lang proactively contacted me in advance and informed me in detail that the hotel is close to the People's Square on Nanjing Road. The Bund Metro Line 2 is very close to People's Square Station. Booking train is close to Shanghai Station. My feelings after checking in: 1. The breakfast is rich and the welcome waiter and chef have a good attitude. 2. The reception at the front desk is warm and the handling of matters is fast. 3. The concierge will answer all your questions. Accessing and retrieving luggage is quick and easy. 4. The transportation is really convenient. There is New World Depar**ent Store on the west side and Shimao International diagonally opposite. At the end of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, the Peace Hotel is located on the Bund. The second stop of Metro Line 2 is the Oriental Pearl Tower. Ten minutes walk to Shanghai Center. I will choose here next time. The kids love the gym➕swimming pool. All in all, I felt good this time. Recommend this one

Considering that it was inconvenient for me to bring my children, they not only helped coordinate a twin room, but also helped deliver breakfast, children's toiletries, and the hotel's new handmade biscuits, which were also very cute.
Marriott is probably an established five-star hotel. The location is very good. Metro Lines 1 and 2 are right next to it. It's just a few steps to Nanjing Road. It's very convenient to go anywhere. The hotel must have been renovated. The room is large and very clean. It's perfect for traveling with children! An unforgettable trip, I will choose to stay here again in the future.

It is as heart-warming as the spring breeze blowing on your face. Thank you for the little bear doll that my children loved very much. There was also the porter who helped deliver suitcases and packages to the children. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask his name. There was no complaint at all for such a heavy package. The entire hotel service gave people a gentle and meticulous feeling. It felt like the care was everywhere but seemed invisible. Guests feel comfortable and relaxed. The location of the hotel is very advantageous. You can easily go shopping anywhere. Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to take some nice photos this time. I will definitely choose this hotel next time I come to Shanghai. Haha, I’ll take some more photos then.

But unfortunately, the front desk checkin we met on the day of check-in told us: Ctrip is sorry for individual travelers, the hotel has a high occupancy rate, and the requirements of large customers will be met first. Two days later, our friend also checked into the hotel. After making some reasonable requests, he was also told that it was impossible. However, my friend is a strong woman and she fought hard and got the result she wanted. It may take a more aggressive guest to stay at this hotel.

The room decoration is old-school and quite satisfactory. The sound insulation between rooms is very good among the hotels I have stayed in. The only regret is that the corridor is not soundproof, probably because the gap under the door is relatively large, but fortunately it does not have a big impact. The toiletries have a good fragrance, refreshing and pleasant.

The breakfast buffet is average for a five-star hotel, the dinner buffet desserts are very good, and everything else is average.

The only thing I want to complain about is the handling of late check-out. Because the high-speed train was in the middle of the afternoon, I went to the front desk to discuss late check-out until 1:30. The front desk's tactic is "We can extend the work according to our regulations. Then you write a good review and I will send you a card package." I have no objection to the employees themselves and understand the performance pressure, but this kind of statement makes people uncomfortable. Originally, you could just postpone it and just say that you hope it will be well received. But now it's a bit threatening and boring. There is no need to send a card package, most people don’t need it.

We stayed for several days in a row, but the breakfast was very disappointing. We went to have breakfast at 8:45 and found that there were not many Chinese food samples, and some dishes were empty. We asked the waiter to add more dishes, but after ten minutes, they still didn't come. We thought the breakfast was nothing good, so we checked out and moved to the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel.

After staying in so many hotels, they usually provide free room gifts such as fruits, but during the Chinese New Year, the hotel did not arrange any free room fruits. I stored my luggage at the concierge. When I went to pick it up, the guy at work told me to look for it myself, but he couldn't find it. Isn't there a luggage tag number? Breakfast is more like a large canteen, with no staff to seat you and a small variety of dishes. It’s okay to increase room rates during the New Year, but services must also keep up.

It is also very convenient to go to the Shanghai Museum. There is a bus stop at the back door, one stop away. The room is clean and tidy, the hotel swimming pool is also great, and there is also a hot spring pool where you can take a dip. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western food. There are many varieties and the taste is good. The service is also very good, and a summer gift bag is also given to the children.

Marriott was my first stop. The hotel is very conveniently located next to the famous Yellow River Road. When you get up and go out, you can eat Jiajia soup dumplings, Shanghai scallion pancakes, etc. just around the corner. The lady in charge of check-in, Lena, was beautiful, soft-spoken, and enthusiastic about her work. She made me have a good impression of Shanghai right away. Thank you to Miss Lena and the other enthusiastic staff of Marriott. I will consider Marriott next time I have the opportunity to come to Shanghai.

The heart-warming card from the auntie in the room "bought" me! ! !
The breakfast waiter saw that I was almost past the breakfast time, and asked me what I needed to add to help me get coffee and so on. . .
The waiters at the entrance of the hotel are also very active and enthusiastic.
The hotel is very clean and the air is very fresh. Next to the banquet hall in the hotel lobby, there is a good place to daze with a TV and a sofa. You can stay there all day on a rainy day. It is super comfortable and very satisfying.
The transportation is very convenient. The first depar**ent store and New World City are located downstairs. It is very close to the Yu Garden on the Bund. It is only a few hundred meters to walk to the Sixing Warehouse, which is very convenient. . For hotels with the same price and location, Marriott is the first choice! ! !

The old hotel is located in a prime location in Shanghai. After the renovation, both the guest rooms and the restaurant on the third floor and the gym on the sixth floor have been greatly improved. Comprehensive location facilities service catering can be said to be the king of cost performance. It is recommended for travel or business trips to Shanghai.
In addition, be sure to name cora in the guest relations depar**ent! Everyone can ask her for help when encountering small problems. She is quite responsible and really makes people feel very warm and caring! All in all, I was very satisfied with my stay and will choose it again on my next business trip.

I contacted the hotel in advance after booking to ask about the hygiene requirements of the room, but this kind of hygiene still appeared. The problem shows that the hotel does not pay attention to guest satisfaction, and the service is also poor. When there is a problem, it is said to be the lobby manager. There is no apology. A manager does not have the basic ability to handle customer complaints. It really makes people doubt the professional training of this manager. Have you passed the test? It's like a new intern who knows nothing about the hotel. When he met the hotel staff in the corridor, he didn't say hello. This kind of service and hygiene are really not worth the price. The price/performance ratio is too low.

The front desk staff is very kind and knows that there is a baby who has arranged a large room for us. The overall facilities are complete. There is also a large amount of water, and it is cleaned every day. The network is also very good and the office is very smooth. In addition, the breakfast environment is also very good. Chinese and Western food are divided into two areas. There are still many varieties. The taste is also very good. The window of the room is directly the Shinsegae Depar**ent Store. The lighting is beautiful at night. The location is also very convenient. Exit the People's Square subway, cross the road, go straight to New World Depar**ent Store, and then cross a small road. It is really very convenient, there is no shortage of food around, McDonald's, Muji store next to it, and there are private restaurants in a small alley. There are really many choices. The swimming pool in the hotel is also relatively clean, but the water temperature is relatively cold. Fortunately, there is a hot spring water next to it that you can soak in before swimming.
Let me talk about the need for improvement: because the hotel belongs to a long time ago, the location is really good. But the hotel's facilities, such as the sewer pipes, are a bit clogged. If there is a leak, there will be water on the floor and it will be difficult to drain. Second, there is no water filler function next to the toilet. Nor is it intelligent. Third, the sound insulation effect is not absolutely good. Occasionally, people can hear voices talking outside at night, and there are curtains, although they are thick, but the shading is not 100%, people who have requirements in this regard need to prepare an eye mask.

Breakfast: There are quite a lot of choices. The only flaw is that Jin, who is all pork sausages, has no chance to eat it. But other dishes taste good

Only the hotel service is mediocre, and the front desk's sales method of suggesting purchasing breakfast to upgrade the room is disgusting. After all, I chose this hotel only because I have certain confidence in the Marriott Group.

Facilities: Although the hotel has been in business for a long time, all the facilities are well maintained. The hotel lobby is bright and refreshing. The room and bathroom are spacious, separated from wet and dry, equipped with a bathtub, and the lighting is soft and not glaring. The air conditioning system is very good Well, it's very quiet, and the hotel's sound insulation is also very good

Hygiene: The sanitation is very clean, the carpet looks quite new without stains, the sofa and bedding look clean, and the pillows are very comfortable

Service: We ordered a deluxe twin bed. The short-haired lady at the front desk who checked in at the hotel was very nice. She not only gave us toys for the children, but also upgraded the room for us. It has a larger area and a great view. You can see the city view and the night view is very beautiful. . Good variety of breakfast

In short, everything is very good in the hotel, and I will stay here again next time. I highly recommend it!

msg:The worst Marriott I have ever stayed at. The price is totally not worth it! ! The hygiene is not good and the service is not good. If you order takeout in a five-star hotel, you have to go down and pick it up yourself. Forget it. The takeout cabinet is set outside in the cold weather. You have to go out to blow air to get it. Look at the pictures on the Internet. It is still new, but the on-site facilities are very old. The toilet door is made of wood. You have to manually close the two sides, and there are stains on the sink. The most important thing is that the bed sheets and quilt covers are extremely unclean! ! ! ! It was impossible to sleep with someone else's hair and stains on it. I am prone to allergies, so I booked a hotel with Marriott thinking that it would be at least clean and comfortable... not as good as All Seasons.

msg:It's very good. I made a temporary appoin**ent with my friends in Shanghai. Two mothers and two babies deliberately chose a 1.4-meter twin room (I saw a few hotels with the largest bed). I didn't study it carefully. I found it after I came here for a while. The location is invincible. Next to the hotel is New World Depar**ent Store. (Madame Tussauds shopping mall is convenient for eating and drinking, and there is a super-large fish tank that children can watch for a long time.) You can take a sightseeing bus through the shopping mall, and it is also the starting point of the building's reading line. It takes less than ten minutes to reach the World Trade Center at the intersection of Pedestrian Street, where MM Dou and Lego flagship stores are located. In addition, it is about ten minutes by taxi from the Natural History Museum, and Joy City with the Ferris wheel is also about the same distance.
The staff of the hotel are very nice, the welcome at the door, the front desk staff, and the restaurant staff are very warm and patient. I didn't go to the swimming pool until after 9 o'clock in the evening for two consecutive days. When I came out, a young lady took the initiative to wrap the children in bath towels to avoid catching cold.
During the stay, we also responded to the needs in a timely manner, and gave a small gift of a toiletry set. When we checked out, we saw that our two children also gave us two small bags. Lisa, the guest experience manager, was very enthusiastic about the return visit. She will come and stay again next time.

The lights in the bathroom are blinking and shining brightly, who has the energy to call the service to repair the lights after a tiring day. 2. Children's parent-child room, no children's toiletries. 3. After half washing in the adult bathroom, I found that the two bottles were full of shower gel and no shampoo. I was really speechless. 4. The service staff at the entrance of the hotel sees the guests holding two items and does not move. They will definitely open the door and leave without seeing you. Disappointed with experience service. The advantage is that it is close to Nanjing Road and has New World Depar**ent Store.

In terms of service, safety, and cleanliness, it is really suitable for people who travel! I think it really impresses me from the perspective of cost performance alone!
The service is really exquisite to the housekeeping staff! When the guest room was being cleaned, the aunt would ask if there were any clothes that needed to be washed. After confirming that there were no clothes, she cleaned the room for us. When she learned that we love drinking water, she helped us put a few more bottles of water! it's so cute. The lady at the front desk, Jane, has great service and is very caring~ The room is very simple, but the slippers and toiletries are very high-end, better than some star hotels. The hotel also provides an exquisite buffet breakfast, with a wide variety of varieties, including small Shanghai wontons and noodles, which taste very authentic, as well as a variety of small pastries and fruits. There was no yogurt when we went late, and the service staff helped us make up yogurt. I was very touched ! ! A very satisfying stay experience, highly recommended~

(It takes half an hour to Hongqiao Railway Station and one hour to Disneyland.) It is very convenient to eat in New World City next door. Opposite New World City is Nanjing Pedestrian Street, and you can walk along the street to the Bund. It feels like all the room charges are at this location.

Facilities: OK. Windows cannot be opened in high-rise rooms. If the air conditioner is turned on, it will be slightly air-conditioned, but if it is not turned on, it will be fine. The hair dryer is old and has low power and is difficult to use. It's good. The TV can only watch live broadcasts and no on-demand services.

Hygiene: Passed, no major problems found

Environment: It's okay. It has a business-like feel overall. You can see many Chinese and foreign business people discussing business in the lobby. Oh, don't expect to see the night view in the room, it doesn't exist.

Service: Does this hotel have services? After staying for three days at a high price, no hotel staff took the initiative to talk to us🤷. Things in the guest room must be provided to the guest upon request. They will not be provided without asking. The service phone line is always busy and cannot be reached. There is a takeaway cabinet downstairs, but you have to go downstairs to pick it up yourself. The entire lobby has a cold attitude, and I didn't feel any warmth from check-in to check-out, so let's just pretend there is no service.

And when we checked in, we asked the Chinese to line up at the front desk, and after a while a foreigner came and went directly to a service desk (the waiter who maintained order next to him didn't stop him at all, he was very speechless). I used to live in Marriott. It was such a bad experience to stay at the Marriott this time in Shanghai. It is estimated that it has something to do with the arrogance of the manager of this store.

We signaled several times to order, but they pretended not to see it, so forget it, and they even came to tell us that they didn’t have the “thing” I wanted. . . If not, just say no, it’s a simple reply, why do you say that “thing”? It's really baffling.

We ordered takeout outside and the service staff did not allow the robot to deliver it to the room. It was said to be hotel regulations. I’m afraid of food safety issues, so I won’t go into detail here. When the takeaway staff entered the lobby to call us, they heard the waiter on the side saying arrogantly: If you tell him, we will deliver it to him this time, and we won’t do it next time! ……….OK? Are you on the job without training? This is really the first time I have encountered it in so many years, I am so shocked!

msg:I traveled to Shanghai with my family and stayed at the Marriott Hotel for the first time. The introduction I read online feels that the location of the hotel is good.
Environment: Very close to the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street sightseeing bus subway station. The location is excellent, and the squid on the pedestrian street is very delicious.
Facilities: The hotel facilities of this level are quite complete, and the children had a great time playing in the swimming pool. The room size is quite large, and the bedding and mattress are very comfortable.
The most speechless people in the swimming pool were the two lifeguards, one was watching the video with headphones on, the other was watching the phone with his legs crossed. It's an insult to the job of lifeguard, if someone is in danger in the water, your artificial eyes can't see and ears can't hear. Are you trying to murder?
Service: The good service is that when you check in, a male receptionist wearing glasses at the front desk is very friendly and enthusiastic. When I left, there was a service staff at the door who served me well and asked if I had called a car. When picking up the luggage, the child was in a hurry to go to the bathroom. We were picking up the stored luggage. The service staff standing in front of the pillars in the lobby were very indifferent. He was indifferent when he heard the child said that he couldn't find the bathroom. He had to go up and ask him to point lazily. one time. What's even more funny is that when my husband said that when he was waiting for us on the sofa in the lobby, there were other guests besides him. The staff even let out a few loud farts unscrupulously. The overall feeling is that many employees in the hotel are free and lazy. It has been very skinny for many years. When I was having breakfast and asked where the coffee was, he was dumb and pointed casually without saying a word. The staff management of a hotel like Marriott is really cheap. Relying on geographical location and brand to eat old money.

The bed in the twin room is 1.4 meters, which is rare in hotels of the same level in Shanghai, and most of them are 1.2 meters.

Jack at the front desk checked us in, upgraded the room type, and actively asked about our needs. He was very considerate. The hotel's breakfast is great, divided into Chinese and Western dining areas, with many varieties. Will choose this one next time.

The environment is comfortable, and the concierge and reception staff are very enthusiastic, which reflects the level of a star hotel. The room is spacious and brightly lit. It is very comfortable to stay with the baby for two nights, and the overall satisfaction.
The downsides are 1. The overall cleanliness of the room is not bad, and the details need to be improved, such as bathtubs and carpets; 2. There is no chain lock on the door, so it is a little uneasy to bring a baby alone.

After a good meal in the evening, I went to the MM bean store, which is very convenient. This time I brought a baby to stay, and they thoughtfully provided children's pajamas, toothbrushes, and slippers (slippers are normal size), which were delivered by robots, very smart. The hotel staff have a good attitude and will take the initiative to say hello. The hot water in the room is large, and the water is quite hot, making washing more comfortable. Sleeping at night is also very quiet, and the air conditioner is also very powerful. The overall accommodation experience is quite satisfactory, and I will choose to stay next time

Because the hotel has no fence and the two beds cannot be put together, I changed to a connecting room. In fact, there is a door between the two rooms. The package is very cost-effective. I chose it. Four tickets to the Lego Discovery Center, four buffet dinners, the hotel's service is nothing to say, responsive, and the breakfast category is rich. But I heard someone asked why there is no steamed bun in the morning. It is indeed a feature of Shanghai and should appear in the breakfast category! When I checked in, I said that breakfast was free for children... Later, I counted it myself. We are two adults. The Unicom room should have four breakfasts and we got an extra one... There is no free minibar... The robot hugs the children very much, or Praise it! Overall, I am quite satisfied. The location is very good and the transportation is convenient. It is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street when you go out. There is a sightseeing bus next to it. It is not too far from the Bund.

msg:I traveled to Shanghai for 7 days and 6 nights. I chose to stay at the Marriott Hotel Agile for the last two days. Let me tell you about my feelings. The Bund’s Huajiantang. Yuyuan (stayed for 2 days) has the best hardware facilities and good service. I stayed here when I was playing Disney. The service of Maixinge Hotel (2 days) is the best. The hardware is almost enough, but it is enough. It has mature experience in garden pick-up and drop-off service! Compared with Marriott, I personally do not recommend it.
Facilities: As a five-star hotel, the facilities are outdated, outdated, and inferior to many newly opened homestays!
Hygiene: Quite satisfactory, there is nothing bad, and there is no highlight that can score 5 points!
Environment: Not bad, it can meet the positioning of a five-star hotel in the central area!
Service: What guests are most looking forward to is the service of the hotel. The five points are for the cleaning lady on the 32nd floor. When communicating with her, you can feel her smile and greetings from the heart! The front desk, concierge, and restaurant services in other departments are more like assembly line work in a factory, with no merit, standard but no emotion, and family members feel the same way! Comparing the two stores I stayed in before, the contrast is very obvious! Also, when booking the hotel, it is clearly stated that you will check in after 16:00. Please note that you must approve the reservation. During the two days I was there, I saw a few times when the children were young, and the two children were tired. They asked for early check-in, but it didn't work anyway! Finally, I would like to talk about the breakfast buffet with wonton noodles. On the first day, I asked for wontons to be picked up in three minutes after being told, and then they were picked up by someone else. The chef is good enough to cook another one! The next day I asked for noodles and was still taken away by someone else. I stood by and waited for nothing. At the same time, there were two ladies at the stall. I told the chef to help cook the noodles. A lady dressed in standard entertainment venues swept me with corns. When the chef asked everyone what they wanted, I understood that Ms. Corn felt that I wanted to add something! I think it will be better for everyone to put four words "queue on the right" at the stall entrance, or put a small cloth ***** around it!

My husband directly chose the Marriott near People’s Square for the convenience of charging. I used to choose Marriott when I went out to play. The sanitation environment is okay, so I feel more at ease Some. There is a restaurant with crab roe noodles that is especially delicious when going out for the holidays. The name of the shop is Chan San Chi. You can try it in the morning. Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street is about 500 meters away. The hotel has its own parking lot, which is more suitable for self-driving friends. The parking fee is free for 4 hours, and an extra 80 yuan is charged for overnight stays, which is acceptable. In addition, on the day we checked in, we upgraded the corner room on the high floor, with a 270-degree night view, which is still very good!

When I arrived on the first day, because it was relatively early, I checked in smoothly after communicating with the hotel, that is, the room type changed from double bed to double bed, but the floor was upgraded; but when I got to the room, the body lotion was not replaced, and there were cotton swabs on the ground. There are many guests during the Spring Festival, and the buffet arrangement is very good, whether it is arranging seating or food supplies.
The most annoyed thing happened on the second day. I asked for the room to be cleaned by calling the room service number, communicating with the cleaning lady, and hanging the sign "Please clean the room" at the door. After much deliberation, I arranged for a cleaning staff to come in, as if you don't want to take your anger out on me, who just took out the garbage with his hands, and directly cleaned the bed without washing his hands? ! Dirty sheets on my suitcase right in front of me? ! When guests are present, what the cleaning staff do is to represent the daily cleanliness level of the hotel, just this five-star level? Really good impression comes first, disappoin**ent comes later!

One double bed room and one twin bed room can accommodate four people with four breakfasts. The price of 2 rooms at 1699 is also relatively cost-effective during the Spring Festival. If you arrive at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the evening, the hotel will upgrade to the executive floor for free. The room is clean and tidy, and the quality of the decoration is also high. If you bring your own fruit, you need to send a fruit plate to put it, and the robot will deliver it. In addition, the 2 surprise rooms have capsule coffee machines, all in all a very nice and satisfying stay. The quality of the Marriott brand is indeed good, especially during the Chinese New Year.

Hygiene: The hotel pays attention to green and environmental protection. If you need it, you can tell the front desk and the waiter, and you can clean it every day and change the towels.

Environment: It's a very good place. It must be convenient to take the children out to play, and sleep quietly. Behind the hotel is the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. Walking down from the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street is the Bund. The hotel is directly opposite the Suzhou Creek. The room has a good view, many different buildings can be seen in all directions. Some rooms can see a three-piece set. The room we stayed in just happened to have a view of the Suzhou Creek and the Sixing Warehouse, which was great. Next to the People's Square, it is very convenient to take the double-decker sightseeing bus and the subway to go anywhere. There is also a bus stop downstairs, which can go directly to Yuyuan City God's Temple, Shanghai Museum of Natural History, etc. There are all kinds of delicacies in the small alley on Fengyang Road next to it, crab roe noodles lined up, big skewers, and it is very convenient to eat late at night. Robots provide delivery services, and the hotel's breakfast is very rich. The hotel business is very good during the Chinese New Year, and you have to queue up for breakfast when you go down late. Children under the age of 12 in the hotel are given free breakfast, and they can eat until 11 o'clock, which is really great.
Service: Needless to say, the service is star standard, very good, and the room type is upgraded for free.

The light in the bathroom was broken, the hair dryer was broken, and what was even more unpleasant was that I brought the elderly to Shanghai to celebrate the New Year with my family on New Year's Eve, because I booked a New Year's Eve dinner at an outside restaurant In the afternoon, relatives came to pick us up early. The room was relatively small. We sat down in the executive lounge for a while, and we were about to leave for the restaurant. Unexpectedly, the waiter named ALEX came over and told us that the executive lounge Only 2 people can come in, and the extra people have to pay for the afternoon tea. I said we just sat down for a while and left, and the few of us old people drank plain water. The so-called afternoon tea in the hotel's executive lounge was nothing. , the old man doesn’t drink coffee or tea, but this waiter is so stubborn. I said to call the manager on duty to come over, but a manager who was as unkind as this waiter came over and said that the hotel stipulates that there are only 2 people. On New Year's Eve, I encountered such two hotel service staff with bad attitudes. They put the rules of the hotel on top of the guests' check-in experience. I said that there are human feelings beyond the rules. This is the first time that a hotel is so ruthless When we met, two people kept standing there arguing with us. It was our old man who advised them not to say a word. We had to go to dinner and leave immediately. These two people walked away. During the New Year, everyone is harmonious, and harmony can make money. , As a five-star hotel, this Marriott doesn't know how to train its employees. The service industry has no sense of service and doesn't care about human relations. Instead, it is domineering. As a platinum member of Marriott, I am very disappointed in this hotel!

As soon as the child entered the room, he cheered and played back and forth. The old mother let go of her hands. This experience is really great caring. Please do give this employee a good compliment.
Although the decoration of the hotel has a sense of age, it is a flaw to sit without heating, but the location is in the middle of the shopping mall in the downtown area, where you can eat, drink and have fun, it is very convenient to travel, and the experience is very good, so it is highly recommended if you want to go shopping with children Be sure to choose Marriott, there is also a bus tour next to the shopping mall downstairs.

No one answered the phone at the front desk at night, the breakfast environment was chaotic, and no one cleaned up the table after I used it. I reported my mobile phone number with my membership card, but I couldn’t find any information on the card number. In the end, I didn’t reply why. When checking out, let me call Marriott's 400 number to inquire about the membership card.

The price is not low during the peak season, and the housing supply is tight. There is no room until noon, and there is no room until 5 pm. However, after communicating with the front desk, we were first given a room for us to rest and wash up, because we have to meet friends later, and the journey is exhausting. It’s better to wash your face... But other matters feel difficult to communicate, including children playing outside. Adults need to go out to discuss with the front desk and put the room card in them. The child used our name and phone number to get it, but was rejected

msg:A hotel that will never stay again! The service is basically zero!
Checked in on May 31, at around 22:00, I asked the staff in the lobby about calling a taxi. I stood next to him and talked to him. He didn't even look at me, and didn't answer a single word. I asked again if I was an employee of the hotel , is there any problem? In the end, they still didn’t even look at me, they were close at hand, and they didn’t reply to me for a while. This is the first time I encountered this situation, and I was taken aback. I found the duty manager of the concierge depar**ent in the lobby, and he was also devastated. He said that he was not familiar with this employee, that he might be a little autistic, and he was unwilling to communicate with other employees. I said that if this is the case, forget it. I understand this situation, it is not easy. The manager on duty also helped me reserve a car, thank you very much! I thought it was an example, but it turned out not to be. I checked out at 16:00 the next day. I met hotel staff anywhere in the hotel. No one said hello or greeted. Take care, wait for the car outside the lobby after check-out (this time I remember, I called the car myself, I don’t use the hotel’s car) The concierge saw me holding the suitcase, and when the car arrived, he didn’t even look at me, turned around and kicked the stone …
To be honest, there are many hotel guests. In fact, this kind of thing is very common. It is normal to encounter a staff who is in a bad mood and is unwilling to talk to him. But this time, the service staff of the entire hotel have this attitude. The problems in management are caused by the unique sense of superiority of some companies and some people!

msg:It's for the title of Marquis Marquis
But in fact, it's very hip-pull, and the experience can't keep up with the entry-level Marriott
Except for the good location, others are more persuasive

Room infrastructure is a little bit bad
The power socket is slightly poor, and the bathroom facilities are a little loose
The TV screen is slightly skewed, which should not appear
The most outrageous thing is that there is no direct do-not-disturb button, which needs to be listed
The sound insulation is not very good. When the cleaner knocks on the door in the morning and asks about the rooms
Basically, it will be noisy for a long time, which will affect people's rest

The service is also quite worrying, the efficiency of the front desk is not up to par
There are often long queues at night and the waiting time is very long
For guests who have reserved rooms for two consecutive days, the room card is only valid for one day
When I came back the next day, I found that the room card could not be unlocked, but I could use the elevator to go upstairs.
Go downstairs to the concierge to consult and learn that you can only go to the front desk to queue up to re-do the card
The cleaners are rude when they knock on the door in the morning, and they swipe their card to enter the room directly
Ask if you need to do laundry, but there is no laundry bag at the door

It was a hip-pushing experience in every way.
Not to mention Marquis class hotels, express hotels are not as good as
Later, many people from the hotel came to ask to operate the review account
Give them a full score for Po, you can write a good manuscript and send it directly
Only then can I understand why the rating is acceptable but the experience is bizarre
There is an after-sales request to send a good review, but there is no other after-sales compensation
I can only say that when I come again next time, I will try my best to help and give some benefits.

I stayed here for 2 days this time. I brought my baby from the Disney Hotel and came here very late. The front desk was very considerate and quickly upgraded the room type and gave the room card to let the baby rest in the room.
There is cleaning and tidying of the room in the middle, which respects privacy and is meticulous. Check out the next day at the executive lounge, high floor, health and refreshments are good. Jack from the concierge gave a small gift to the baby, which is very thoughtful.

This time, I also saw many children at breakfast and dinner on the 3rd floor. Most of them can complete all the links of the buffet by themselves. I feel that Marriott's service and facility safety are great!

Coming to Marriott is like coming home.

Seeing the hotel holds a wedding, the service is also orderly. The Ferris wheel can be seen from the room. It is a few minutes' drive from the Bund and Jing'an Temple. The breakfast has both Chinese and Western desserts.

Despite being busy, their customer service and process are elegant and courteous. Special thanks to Mr. Golden Key Jack Lang Lang, who made me and my family feel at home in the lounge, home away from home. The Executive Lounge is my favorite Agile place. The hardware is also not as clean as a hotel that has been open for more than ten years.

The staff at the front desk was very considerate and arranged for us to wait for the room in the lounge. The scenery is still very good! Jack's service in the lounge is very enthusiastic and proactive. He also helped to reserve the swimming pool. Maybe the swimming pool is reserved and there are not many people. The children are also very happy! , Overall, the stay experience is very satisfactory!

Whether it is breakfast or wine shop, when the food is short, it will be added immediately, and the table will be cleaned up quickly. Time to clean up. The swimming pool is not very big and it is very safe and sexy (there are two lifeguards). The day and night views of the city outside the window are beautiful. In short: very good, a hundred likes.

2. The lobby service attitude is very good
3. The room is well lit
shortcoming:
1. The water temperature for swimming is relatively cold, so it is not suitable for children to go to the regular swimming pool
2. The room is small and smelly, and there is soot under the receiver of the landline
3. Toiletries need to be the same. This is the first time I heard that toiletries are environmentally friendly products, so I won’t provide them if I don’t mention them (embarrassing capitalization)

Although the weather was not too hot, the room was so stuffy that I couldn’t sleep. Later, I changed to a room with a little more ventilation, but the experience this time was really bad. I hope In the future, the hotel can think more about the guests. Since the air conditioner is upgraded, it simply does not open to the public. Also, can this charging pile be changed to another brand? There are so many of them, but none of them work.

I woke up from the cold at 3 in the morning, and was told by the front desk that the air conditioner was broken after I asked. I asked the hotel to send two quilts, but one was delivered. In such a big hotel, the waiter said that there was only one quilt, and the second bed was delivered later.
The service attitude was extremely poor. It took a long time to answer the service call, and it took three calls to answer the call. I have never stayed in such a bad five star hotel.

msg:The location of the hotel is actually quite good. Although the house name is Tibet Road, it is actually on Fengyang Road, Tiaoma Road, next to Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. Next to it is the New World and Shibaiyi Store, which is absolutely five degrees from the city center.
Now that the hotel has been upgraded to the Marquis brand, the service inside is quite worthy of the name. I personally think the happy hour service in the executive lounge is very good. My wife and I go there to do office work, chat, and the scenery outside the window is also very beautiful. People feel comfortable.
The room is decent, very clean, I like the Marriott's bed, it's not good for my waist, it's soft and hard
Overall it's a good hotel, and I will choose this hotel when I come to live in Shanghai with my wife and children in the future.

msg:Agile, who lived in Dalian before, has a very good impression. This word is really super disappointing. It was checked in at 4 o'clock, but because my friend Tong Xing wanted to be closer, the front desk said it would take 5 o'clock to check in, and we agreed! We called at 3:30 and they checked out the VIP, and then told us that we needed to check in at 6:00, we couldn't understand it, so the VIP took up our time, shouldn't they tell us the same thing! Afterwards, we said we were waiting, but it didn't come down at 6:30, and the cleaning staff were too busy to clean up. In the end, we didn't check in until 7:30. During the Chinese New Year, there are so many people in the restaurant that it is difficult to find a seat. I am really angry! The breakfast is also very, very average, and the management is chaotic! Bad reviews, I really won't stay here again, I will complain when I finish playing with my kids in the past few days! !

The cleaning was called in the morning, and the cleaning staff only came at night, and they were urged several times in the middle. Is the elevator leaking? It costs 120 yuan to stay in the hotel and park the car. It’s fine if you ask for the money. If you don’t tell me in advance, I will let you go up after you check out the room and go to the garage, and then I will tell you! Anyway, the service is a mess!

It was very cold and I needed to add an extra quilt to say that I could queue up, but there were already more than a dozen people in front. The guests are queuing up. It's really funny. The facilities are a bit old, and the service and facilities can't keep up with the price. Apart from the convenient location, there are no other advantages. By the way, the elevator is broken, and it takes a long time to wait for the elevator...

The service attitude of the front desk is generally quite ordinary, and the little brother wearing glasses is sarcastic; 2. No one answers the phone at the front desk in the room. Extremely bad... (The next day we gave up the hotel breakfast directly) 4. It doesn't matter if you don't clean up, but you should always give water. No one cares about the phone, and it's really too bad not to give water.)

msg:I have never given a negative review when staying in a hotel. This is the first time I have a negative review. I have stayed in many Marriotts at home and abroad. This hotel is really disgusting. I booked an executive king bed room and couldn't eat breakfast every day. Faced with the Spring Festival period There were so many people, and the hotel had no corresponding emergency measures. The elevator was broken and was not repaired in time. It took 20 minutes to go up and down the stairs. What was even more annoying was that I was very tired after a day of shopping. I finally took the elevator up, but the door to the room could not be opened. I used the floor phone to call the front desk, but the line was always busy... If there was any accident, I really can’t imagine it. Finally, after waiting for a long time for the elevator, I contacted the lobby manager JACK at the front desk. He went upstairs to open the door again, but it still couldn’t be opened. It took us 40 minutes from arriving at the hotel to entering the room. Manager JACK was then He said he promised to resolve the matter and said he would reply by phone, but so far he has not received a call from anyone in the hotel. Is this how you manage the hotel, the person in charge? I will continue to report to my superiors and advise everyone not to stay at this Marriott hotel. It’s too bad. It’s too bad.

msg:The front desk business is not very skilled.
For the Madame Tussauds tickets given in the room, I called the front desk in advance to make a reservation. A male receptionist said that if he didn’t answer the call, it was already booked. He asked him if he had a ticket, and he replied that he didn’t need it. Don't worry about asking the little girl at the front desk when you check in, and tell me to call at the door.
Then I went to Madame Tussauds in the afternoon. There was no reservation record, and people said that there should be a QR code for SMS. I called back to the hotel, waited for various communications, and finally received a reservation text message. It was not easy for the reservation depar**ent to be cool on Chinese New Year's Eve.
Other services are okay, except for the low-frequency business of ticket booking, the front desk is good. For example, if you call in advance, the room you need can be cleaned up after twelve o'clock, and the children's slippers are also ready.
The buffet dinner in the western restaurant is quite good. The skin of the roast suckling pig is crispy and the meat is tender. Each person also gets a piece of millet sea cucumber.
The service of the buffet breakfast is also very good. My baby wants to eat noodles with scallion oil, which is not in the menu, so I specially made one for him.

The location is superb, almost at the entrance of Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, near People's Square and the subway station, there is everything nearby, and it feels like a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle. The advantages of the old five-star hotel are all there, the lobby is spacious and elegant, the supporting facilities are complete, the staff are well-trained, polite and enthusiastic. The double bed room I booked was given to a high-rise room. It is quiet and soundproof, and has a good view. The room is not very new, but it is well maintained, very clean and tidy. The bedding linen is of good quality and comfortable. The only downside is that the mattress may be relatively old, and the middle part of the big bed feels like it has collapsed. Fortunately, I live alone, so I don't feel uncomfortable sleeping on one side. The breakfast has a variety of varieties, including many local specialties. The quality and taste are very good. The restaurant environment is also quite good, which is worthy of praise.

The hygiene of the swimming pool bathroom in the gym is not very good
The overall feeling is a bit messed up
The service attitude of the waiters is good and some are bad

msg:📍Agile Marriott Marquis Hotel is a subsidiary of Marriott Group. It is located in the core area of the city center, adjacent to Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, with a very advantageous geographical location. There are large entertainment shopping centers such as New World City, First Depar**ent Store, Shimao Plaza, etc. near the hotel.
🚌The transportation is convenient. Metro Line 1, Line 2, Line 8, etc. can be reached at People's Square Station.
🚗For customers who drive by car, the hotel has an underground parking garage. 20 yuan / hour, 24 hours capped at 160 yuan. In-house guests can go to the concierge at the front desk to register to receive coupons, which can be reduced by 80 yuan for 24 hours.

Cost-effective:
The family is a Marriott member and booked three rooms online 6 days in advance. Unexpectedly, the price I saw on Ctrip a few days later turned out to be cheaper than the previous reservation, so I decided to cancel the re-booking. Twin room plus double breakfast per night is 980 yuan / room. It may be that the epidemic has affected few tourists, and the rooms are not tight. It is rare to have this kind of house price during the holiday. For the level of Marriott, it is really very economical.
Check-in reception:
Arrived at the hotel around 3:00 pm on New Year's Eve, and many guests came to check in at the front desk one after another. During the waiting time, I heard that there were many guests who spoke Shanghainese also waiting in line. My sister and I looked at each other and smiled. Originally, I thought it was too funny for a Shanghai native to go to a hotel on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Now it seems that there are quite a few Shanghainese who have this idea. The little brother who received us at the front desk was very kind, smiling and answering all our questions politely and patiently. When he saw his sister holding the baby, he immediately took out a small gift from the hotel for her, and offered to send someone to send a baby cot to the room immediately after checking in. When we asked if the room could be upgraded, he was also very forthright. 's promise. From the service attitude of the receptionist, the speed of handling and the way of handling problems, it is not difficult to see that his professionalism is very strong, and it also reflects the standard of Marriott Hotel.

Room Facilities:
We have three rooms for six people, and they are all arranged on the same floor according to our request. The room is located on the 31st floor of the hotel, with a high floor and a good view, overlooking the entire Nanjing Road from the full perspective glass window. Shanghai is brightly lit at night, and the bustling scene of the lively downtown makes me proud and proud of myself as a Shanghainese! The area of the room is about 40 square meters, and the decoration belongs to the middle and high grade. The hotel opened in 2011 shows that the maintenance is good. All the facilities in the room are complete, and the sofa is very large. If you are not particular, one more person can sleep on the sofa. Although the bathroom is not big, the shower room and bathtub are also readily available, and there are basically no shortcomings. If you have to be picky, it is the mother and son who are used to using smart toilets. They are still not comfortable sitting on ordinary toilets in winter. I hope the hotel will be perfect when it is updated.

breakfast:
During the three days of staying in the hotel, the most commendable thing is the buffet breakfast room on the third floor. In order to meet the habits and needs of various guests, breakfast is served from 6:30 am to 10:30 am. The restaurant is divided into two areas: Chinese and Western. The Chinese area has noodles, wontons, porridge, steamed buns, and various special snacks with different tastes from the north and the south. It can be said that the consideration is very thoughtful. The Western-style area is also rich in varieties. All kinds of baguettes, croissants, and cakes are exquisite and delicious. There are also a variety of coffee and juice, which is definitely better than the bakery outside! The most thoughtful thing is that, considering that some guests have the habit of getting up late, they also specially prepared a packing box to pack some dry food and bring it back to the room for them to enjoy.

Gym:
The 6th floor of the hotel is a fitness center, as well as an indoor swimming pool and a sauna. The equipment here adopts the most high-end brands of the current fitness center, and the equipment is complete and advanced. It is no exaggeration to say that here you can fully enjoy all the trea**ent of a professional gym!

overall evaluation:
The three-day and four-night trip to the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Agile ended. I regretted giving up traveling abroad because of the epidemic. Because of the epidemic, I chose to stay in a hotel in Shanghai, and I received a surprise! Thank you to Marriott Marquis Hotel Agile for giving me and my family a happy and fulfilling New Year!

When I first arrived at the front desk, I was surprised by the enthusiasm of Jane, the lady who checked me in. 😄😄The lady was very enthusiastic and recommended the lounge to us, and the room was upgraded to a high floor. Because it was a family trip, it was really cost-effective to add a few hundred yuan. I wanted to upgrade to a suite at first, but unfortunately all the suites were booked. I thought that the twin room would not be enough for sleeping, but when I got to the room, I discovered that the twin room was actually 1.4m! It can easily sleep four people! ! The scenery in the lounge is also very good, the venue is large, and you don’t have to worry about running out of seats. Because I stayed in the hotel for a long time, a lot of express delivery was delivered to the hotel. I would like to thank Xiao Shen from the concierge. Although the takeaway cannot be delivered directly to the room, every time I look for takeout, I will be very enthusiastic to help find it. There are so many takeaways on Chris**as day, it’s really hard😆😆😆

I didn’t expect that the young man at the door named Ivan was very active in helping me with my luggage from the moment I walked in. When I checked in, I wanted to stay in a larger room, so Jane at the front desk introduced me to the various room types in the hotel, and she was very careful and meticulous. In the end, we were upgraded to a large suite at a very good price. The room was really great, it was big enough and the view was great. I heard that the decoration in the room has been changed this year. No wonder it is new. It is on the same floor as the Constellation Lounge. It is good to have afternoon tea after work and dine in the evening. It is approaching Chris**as, and the decoration of the lounge is really beautiful. Pretty good! It was a very pleasant stay.

After I checked out, I left my watch and a paper bag with my important data line charger, etc. I was very anxious and thought it was lost in another place, Carr I started to look for it with me, and I could see that I was really super diligent. I was always confused when I lost something. I relied on him to help me. I finally found out that I was careless in the room. When he helped me find it, I was really Take a long sigh of relief, thank him so much. The hotel’s breakfast and the executive lounge are also very nice. The large piece of beef in the bowl of noodles at breakfast is still fresh in my memory. It is very good in all aspects. The little brothers and sisters at the front desk are very gentle. That's great!

The hotel is very close to People’s Square and Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street. The rooms are also good. A free upgrade was made. It's tall and the view is good. The Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor has a good taste. The upstairs seems to be a banquet hall, which is very beautiful. I just strolled around. Very cost-effective hotel, very good!

The room is clean and comfortable, the wifi is pretty fast, and the movie is not stuck at all. I am most afraid of the cold when I go out in winter. The heating in the hotel room is quite adequate. You can wear short sleeves in the house. It's Marriott, but the toiletries are good. The welcome girl Jasmine in the lobby is very enthusiastic, and she greets enthusiastically every time she goes in and out. Special thanks to Jane and Fiona for their help during my stay.

After I entered the lobby, someone helped me with my luggage. The staff at the front desk was Kang Kang when I checked in Kang also carefully asked me various questions in life, which made me feel very considerate. Jane considered the guest relationship very thoughtfully. The staff in the concierge depar**ent was also very enthusiastic to help me with my luggage when I checked in. I had too much luggage. And I came here very late. They still showed me the attitude of serving guests seriously. I really liked it the first time I stayed, and I will choose this hotel often in the future.

In contrast, I finally chose Shanghai Agile Hotel, because the location is very close to People’s Square and Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, and also close to the Bund, making it easy to travel. Talking about the environment, the decoration is the fashionable and light luxury style I like. We live on the executive floor and face the room facing the Bund.

I called them at 10 o’clock and asked them. They actually said they didn’t find it. I thought about it and let it go. Later I saw this message again and I treated the customer like a **.

From breakfast to afternoon tea and happy hour in the afternoon, especially the breakfast is rich in content, including Western and Chinese styles. Although the fitness center is not too luxurious, the equipment is basically adequate. Will patronize if there is a chance in the future. There are enough parking spaces in the underground parking lot, but it's not good to be 80 yuan per day at half price! I hope that the executive floor can park for free, that would be even better

🧹Hygiene: In fact, due to the epidemic situation, I am still very worried about the hygienic situation, and some are frightened. However, the hotel will take the initiative to provide disinfectant, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer and masks. This gives guests a lot of peace of mind when traveling on business.

All in all, this stay is really satisfactory. I hope you can see the lovely and loving staff in the lounge next time you stay! See you next time!

The dinner buffet is slightly inferior, with many varieties, but the taste is average, with lobster and hairy crabs, but the quality is not very good. The water in the swimming pool is relatively shallow, suitable for children to swim, and there are not many people. The children swim well on the first day and continue after breakfast on the second day. If you have a Marriott gold card, you can apply for a delayed check-out until two o'clock, both of which are bonus. Then talk about the deduction items: The hotel has robots, but you can’t use robots to help deliver takeouts. You must go down and pick them up by yourself, and the concierge staff will not help you find them. Just tell you to find them in a bunch of takeaways, husband It is said that during the epidemic, many hotels can use robots to deliver everything to you. Five-star hotels have robots but do not deliver them. Very cheap chain hotels have this service. The same is true for stored luggage. Just find it yourself! By the way, it seems that this is the first time I have encountered luggage stored in a 5-star hotel for you to find by yourself.

It took about half an hour to take the child to the Bund. The hotel facilities are relatively old, but the hotel service is very good. The buffet breakfast and dinner are very rich. My family feels that this is the best and most satisfactory hotel among the hotels I have stayed in recently, and it is very cost-effective. The front desk brother Mark is very enthusiastic, and overall, very satisfied.

服務：工作人員服務非常好，都很有親和力，因為有很多外賓，前台有好多大長腿帥哥😁👍，尤其是Tina小姐姐👩🏻退房時特意問我們入住體驗感和滿意度，以及有無不到位的地方。

設施：酒店的裝飾風格比較陳舊，插頭比較少，房間不同的功能區應該多配置一些垃圾桶和抽紙。總體能滿足入住需求。

早餐：中西餐分區明確，陽春麪很好吃，孩子每人炫兩碗。

地理位置：地鐵人民廣場走路幾分鐘，臨近世茂廣場，第一世界百貨，南京路步行街，新世界城，杜莎夫人蠟像館，出行很方便

Заселялись ближе к полуночи, единственное странно, что в отеле такого класса и размера, нет круглосуточного сервиса, чтобы можно было перекусить. Заходили в отели неподалеку, там тоже самое, вообще в этом районе, а это центр, проблема покушать после 23.00.
Отель расположен в центре Шанхая, торговые центры, пешеходные улицы, все в шаговой доступности.

缺：早餐比起住過的其它萬豪配置低好多，都不能現榨胡蘿蔔汁，怨念很重。
續住了兩天，忘了是第二天還是第三天，房間出現了五六衹棕色飛蟲\蛾。弄死三衹，其它的不見了。等我明天離店後希望能處理反饋下。

msg:暑假帶兩個孩子到上海遊玩，住了兩晚這個酒店，房間很寬敞，衞生很乾凈，早餐也很豐富，感覺是這次上海之行最理想的酒店。位置在南京東路和南京西路中間，去逛南京東路步行街十分方便，孩子們很喜歡去附近的樂高旗艦店玩。出酒店200多米就是人民廣場地鐵站，交通很便利。特別要誇誇酒店的服務，我們到達當天有服務生主動幫忙送行李到房間，因為走的下午火車時間比較晚，前一天晚上前台的一個小夥子友好的幫助延遲了退房時間。臨走時前台有個叫JESSIE的女孩子非常熱情麻利的幫我辦理了退房手續並開具了發票。感覺服務非常專業到位，能考慮客人的需求，照顧客人的感受。離開上海後一直沒來得及寫評論，但已經向朋友們推薦了這家萬豪酒店，以後也會成為我和家人的首選。

因為是去慶生的，讓酒店幫忙佈置一下房間，服務人員幫忙用毛巾做了一個蛋糕，雖然不比以前其他酒店又放氣球又放綵帶的，但還是謝謝服務人員的辛苦！可是樓下櫃檯人員在我們check in的時候就先和我女朋友爆雷說有佈置，真是謝了☹️
因為下雨懶得出門，請飯店延長退房，直接幫我們從12點延到2點，讓我們可以慢慢的休息吃飯，這個真的很加分，謝謝！

工作人員，除了餐廳，都非常好，尤其是前台每一位都細緻耐心不失熱情。
早餐廳，首先格局過於兩頭分散，穿行不便，也無法在視覺上彌補餐點不夠豐富的短板。人太多了，體驗挺不好的，在旺季的三亞edition早餐都沒有體驗這麼亂過。
房間乾淨，地段滿分。

首先服務很給力，反饋速度等都超快，要水拿毛巾等電話後秒到，好的酒店是有很好的服務意識的，哪怕人再多再忙，必須點贊，房間也很寬敞舒適，不過要是再多個咖啡吧枱配個咖啡機什麼就更棒了。
餐廳也很不錯，雖然遇到長假，人是很多的，但酒店很人性化，把原本的早餐時間給延長了，以至於就算排隊也不會很久，很安心。
其次，酒店位置很好，妥妥市中心，出門就是繁華的南京路人廣，小逛下還是可以的，好久沒來這些地方了。
外賣的選擇也很多。
唯一有點希望提高優化的是停車，停車還是需要收費的，而且價格還挺貴，應該是樓宇的停車外包的緣故，希望以後能夠對住店客人免費，或者封頂價格再優惠些也是好的。
總體來説很棒，寶貝老婆還是滿意的，下次有機會再來感受。謝謝 點贊👍

msg:這次和對象的紀念日入住的行政房，整體感覺不錯，中間有點小插曲有點掃興。在行政樓層辦理的check in遇到了Alex小哥，幽默風趣非常積極主動，晚上對象在酒廊吃飯時打翻了一杯水，Alex小哥先為他擦拭身上再處理地上的水，非常感謝！！！
中間有點小插曲是房間衞生間鎖上打不開撥打服務中心電話一直沒人接，近二十分鐘用手機和房間電話撥打都沒人接，最後還是去酒廊找人才拜託到師傅和經理來的，還好我們是兩個人入住，不然一個人被鎖裏面，酒店電話還打不通，真的非常糟糕。最後師傅來叮叮咣咣了十來分鐘修好走了，希望酒店能加強一下服務中心的服務質量，很多次打電話要好久才能接，要麼就是佔線當中…
除了這個小插曲其他的體驗還是不錯的，早餐質量中規中矩，該有的也都有。臨走的時候在大堂和前台説想要一張房卡留作紀念，之前也有這個習慣，本以為就簡單遞給我一張房卡就結束了，但這個前台小姐姐竟然拿出來幾張，從櫃枱走出來走到我身邊讓我挑選一張喜歡的（其實房卡都是一樣的，衹是有細微的色差，小姐姐讓我挑一張看起來新的），這個細節的舉動真的非常的暖心，抱歉沒記下這個小姐姐的名字，但非常感謝！臨走之時有如此好的體驗！

酒店定的是西藏中路的雅居樂萬豪，選擇這家主要是自家來玩，這是位置全是上海中心區域，從這出發到上海到哪裡都方便，隔壁就是新世界，附近還有南京路，人民廣場等商圈。
酒店整體服務非常棒，辦理入住時Carr小哥哥知道我帶了兩孩子主動給升級了視野較好的房間，還多送了一個早餐。
離開酒店後Lisa小姐姐還禮貌詢問入住體驗，並告知後續入住有任何問題都可以找她。總之本次入住體驗很不錯，酒店確實也很方便，推薦。
另外，酒店和商場共用停車場，24小時內可以抵扣一半停車費，挺好。

시설은 조금 오래된 느낌은 있었지만 방 크기가 넓고 회장실도 잘 되어 있어서 만족했어요. 패밀리 커넥팅룸 이용했는데 방 두개가 중간 문으로 연결되어 네식구 지내기에 아주 넉넉하고 편안했습니다.  퀸침대 하나에 더블침대 두개, 화장실 두개였어요. 

화장실이나 침대등 중요한 곳들의 청결도는 꽤 만족스러웠지만 바닥이나 구석진 곳의 먼지, 머리카락 등은 좀 아쉬웠습니다. 별하나 뺐어요. 

서비스는 전반적으로 좋았습니다. 무료 업그레이드(고층), 청소해주시는 분도 친절했고 조식 장소에서도 모두들 친절하고 좋았습니다. 얼리 체크인도 해주시고.. 다만 커넥팅룸이라 방 두개 사이 문을 열어주어야  했는데 몇번이나 얘기한 후에 몇시간 후에나 열어주러 오셨어요. 직원들이 다들 바쁜 것 같은 느낌이었습니다. 그리고 정문에서 짐 받아주는 서비스가 없습니다. 들어갈때 5성급 호텔 맞아? 하고 의아해 했던 부분입니다. 

조식은 중식 코너와 양식 코너가 아예 분리되어 있었고 각 장소가 매우 컸어요. 음식종류도 많고 퀄리티도 좋았습니다. 

사소한 아쉬운 부분은 있었지만 전반적으로 꽤 만족으러운 2박이었고 가성비 좋은 호텔입니다.  재이용 의사 있습니다.

msg:一般般吧，並沒有想象中那麼好。最驚奇的還要算早餐竟然需要排隊 …而且長隊，從出電梯口就看到長龍堵住了電梯門。同時，三樓餐廳門口的黑西裝男我想問一下那麼近的距離你竟然看不到老外插隊，中國人竟然要維護好你的次序而老外竟可以比中國人高一等的嗎？？？

聯通房很大，1.4的雙床和1.8的大床，2室2衞
床很舒服，樓層也挺安靜。機器人送拖鞋牙膏都很快速。
生日當天入住，安排了小蛋糕。小童超過6歲早餐要收費，有點貴的。
整體很好，Maria服務熱情，酒店地理位置很方便，不能出上海的話，帶小傢伙去住一晚蠻舒服的，適合旅遊度假！

離家近，忘了東西就回去拿一下，哈哈，很輕鬆，適合不出市區隨便溜溜娃。
帶自助晚餐的那個套餐非常合算，自助餐價廉物美，最近主要是小龍蝦，冬天的小火鍋也很好。
衹要有空，酒店都會主動升級房間，自助餐經常去了，每次讓經理Jash幫忙訂位置，不管人多人少，都安排得非常好。強烈推薦大家去試一下。

這個真的很不萬豪
吃到10點半，也沒有任何服務員來告知早餐時間快結束。
細節決定成敗吧

入住後送來了歡迎水果，內容相當豐富，蘋果金桔香蕉橙子等，一應俱全。
夜裡覺得有點燥熱，問前台要了冰塊，兩分鐘就送來了，效率是相當高。
2021到2022的跨年相當美滿

在入住之前我有一個包裹提早到了，禮賓部也可以提前幫忙收取，等入住時再拿到房間裏。我在入住的七天裏寄過兩次快遞，從來都不需要自己預約順豐，一個電話禮賓部的小哥哥們都能幫助搞定，這點簡直太方便了！
打掃衞生的阿姨也從來不會一大早就來敲門，一般都是下午的時候，會細心詢問那些需要收哪些不需要。每次在走廊裏遇到還會打招呼説你好❤️
最讓我印象深刻的，是整個酒店的工作人員們都有認真提供服務的精神，遇到問題從不推脱而是想辦法幫客户解決，光這一點就太難得了。有出行要求的小夥伴們，酒店離人民廣場地鐵口特別近，樓下還有喜茶，吃喝玩樂基本都在兩站以內，三月份再來上海時會再次選擇雅居樂萬豪，希望到時候帶爸媽入住，他們也能滿意。

服務：給前台小哥哥的服務點贊，很貼心，給人感覺很舒服，提前問了房間是否會有額外消費，免收了保證金，還送了一個水果盤。雖然都是很小的舉動，但客户感受很好。
房間：比想象中空間要大，有一個比較寬的兩人沙發座，房間衞生也很乾凈，窗外風景很好。
餐食：早餐很豐富，符合酒店的定位，入座後服務生會特別體貼送紅茶或者咖啡。唯一可以改善就是餐食之間擺放的比較開，需要來回走動，不是那麼方便，沒有一下找到涼牛奶。

🤎去到小姐姐給我升級了房間
 
太舒服了！！我住的是36F，問了一下面積大概有55-60平方米
 
✅一房一廳，有房門，私密性好
 
✅雙人大浴缸
 
✅聽説是有政策房間不能準備牙具用品，但是到房間都已經準備齊全了！

🔔服務：我是下午三點多入住，大堂姑娘幫我刷電梯送到37F酒廊。
酒廊前台非常熱情，是兩位小姐姐，叫Vivian和Chloe（希望沒有把她們的名字打錯）
其他員工也非常熱情，讓我有點不知所措了！有個男員工，穿黑色西裝的很帥氣。

🍃環境：整個裝修沒有特別華麗，我特別喜歡牆上掛的壁畫。酒廊音樂聲音不太大，很適合辦公。

其他地方還沒有去逛過，時間太倉促，還有西餐廳和健身房沒有去！！期待下次入住啦

msg:第一次入住雅居樂萬豪，我願意稱之為上海萬豪集團的標兵。
首先交通便利，周圍吃喝玩樂一應俱全。作為出差狗，最頭疼的就是酒店周圍出行不方便，但是這家酒店處在魔都中心，去哪兒都方便（兩個機場太遠除外😷）。
再來是貼心專業的服務。這次是在酒廊辦的入住，看名牌是一位叫Chloe的小姐姐幫我詳細介紹了酒店的設施和開放時間，非常熱情非常nice，幸運的是正好有最後一間套房免費升級給了我✌手動點贊。
第三是景觀真心無敵了。房間浴室正對上海三件套，可惜太忙沒空泡個澡好好放鬆一下。酒廊的景觀也很不錯，從東到西看個全🌇
另外不得不提的是行政酒廊的服務是不得不誇。吃個早飯的功夫就足夠感受到他們的專業，熱情，貼心，周到。
下次有機會來上海的話，一定會再來雅居樂萬豪🛬

題外話：經常來上海，住了很多飯店，但不知曾幾何時，想要享受個五星級酒店的正常水準，貌似不容易，有時甚至不如連鎖酒店的專業和熱情。這次雅居樂萬豪讓我重拾上海酒店業的信心，望保持，加油。

msg:優點：地理位置相當好，可以走路去南京路步行街、外灘，周邊小吃也很多。房間比較大，早餐還可以，游泳池不錯。
缺點：酒店並沒有在大馬路旁，一條小路拐進去，門面不夠大氣。設施老舊，房間封閉抽風功能不好，空調老化，整個房間空氣不清新，總是悶悶的有異味的感覺。配備的拖鞋、洗漱用品等檔次很低，很難想象星際酒店會這麼次。沒有茶具茶葉咖啡機，鏡子佈置的位置也很奇怪，想要化粧衹能用洗手間的鏡子。
總之，體驗下就夠了。

全家上海行的第一站，非常非常滿意的酒店。首先是無與倫比的地理位置，下樓就是南京路，樓下就有瑞幸、無印良品，過馬路就有一百、全家。住在這裏的四天，感受到了全方位的方便。第一天就有智能機器人上門送東西，哈哈哈。從衞生到服務，萬豪都給我們留下了比較好的印象。整體來説，推薦推薦，相當推薦

先説好的地方
1.位置極佳，出門就是新世界，過馬路就是步行街，走到底就是外灘，周邊吃飯買東西幹啥都方便，都不用定酒店早餐，樓下就是麥當勞，全家，老孃舅啥的比酒店好吃。去自然博物館，火車站都很近，畢竟上海打車很貴，近點省錢
2.洗澡水很好，健身房泳池也都有

不好的地方
1.酒店比較老了，房間不大，床不大，整體沒有豪華酒店的舒適感
2.酒店前台沒有口罩

msg:房間很乾凈，衞生間很大，非常滿意！雖然酒店已經很久了，但沒有特別老舊的感覺。衞生間浴缸很好，雖然是普通浴缸，但躺着很舒服。潤膚露是我喜歡的味道。
位置就在新世界隔壁，吃飯、去地鐵站都很方便。
到的比較早，特別高樓層的房型沒有打掃好，感謝RITA服務非常貼心和細緻，贈送的一份早餐給我！
以後會再來住。
