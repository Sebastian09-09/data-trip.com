msg:This is a fantastic hotel to stay at whilst skiing in Changbaishan. With it’s own ski hire desk and the cost of hire and you ski pass included in the rate (this is not well advertised), all you need to do is grab your gear and take a few steps out to the lifts.
The hotel itself is huge and the rooms well presented. There are good food options in the hotel and the small town, just outside the door, has a good few more.
The breakfast buffet was really good with a wide choice for everyone. We did not sample the restaurants in the hotel though.
Only small let down was the slight end of season feel when we were there. We had club access but there was a reluctance to keep restocking the beer and wine as it was used up. Not the end of the world but it was frustrating when there was a group of us wanting to enjoy a few apres-ski drinks. There is also an outdoor pool which was lacking in heat on a couple of occasions, not sure if this was because they perceived it was quiet and not being regularly used.
These were relatively minor grips though. The staff were very friendly and helpful and all in all would be very happy to return.

msg:The hotel overall has a more American style, and it has a five-star feel overall. The room style is relatively old-school, and the TV is extremely small for the current standards. There is an independent toilet room with no independent exhaust. Maybe the sealant is a little old, and it smells terrible as long as someone uses it. Such an environment does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. This is a bit disappointing. The hotel is in a good location and has its own ski house, which was what I liked at the time. Eating and drinking in Wanda Town is very convenient. The room trea**ent in the VIP Club is also okay. When you arrive with a group of people on the airport bus, you can go directly to the exclusive area of ​​the VIP Club to check in without queuing. Breakfast was mediocre. There is a restaurant where lunch is okay, but Ctrip says there is afternoon tea or something, but that is not available. I don't want to choose this hotel next time, mainly because the toilet room is really smelly.

The bathing part is very good, but the toilet room is amazing. It is unbelievably small. If you are a fat person, it is probably difficult to sit on the toilet.
The floor in the toilet room is not clean either. There is dust in every corner. There is also dust under the mirror frame on the washbasin. The toilet does not flush well.

Breakfast is okay. The sesame seeds are freshly baked and very creative. The taste is also very good. The small wontons and hot and sour soup are typical hotel standards (I don’t mean it’s delicious).
The meal coupons provided by the hotel are quite useful. There are no consumption restrictions. It is a real benefit.
Before traveling, the hotel will call customers in advance to ask if they have any special needs and inform them of the shuttle bus route, which is quite a plus.

msg:The location is particularly advantageous. It’s only a 20-step walk from the Hyatt Ski House to Baihusuo. Every day at noon, we go back to the ski house to change out of snowshoes before going to eat. The Hyatt Ski House can rent and return helmets multiple times. and shoes. It's also within a 3-5 minute walk to the water park and Halla Mountain.
I stayed for three days and skied all day every day, so I didn’t explore the interior of the hotel or go to the outdoor pool, but I did play with the dogs. The vacation benefits are the same in every hotel.
What needs to be complained about is that the alarm clock rang at 12 o'clock in the morning on the second night. It may have been the Apple stereo on the bedside that my aunt came across while cleaning. This kind of old equipment should have been replaced long ago. Why keep it? Is it fun to use it as an alarm clock in the middle of the night? The bathroom with separate dry and wet areas has a peculiar smell and no exhaust.
The receptionist at the night shift was very nice and had the style of a big hotel.
But the boy who manages the ski house has a bad attitude towards guests who don't want to rent a locker to store their shoes. In fact, it's enough to say it once, but it's annoying to say it repeatedly. Shoes are placed casually in the ski resort, so there is no need to keep an eye on guests to rent lockers.

Hyatt has its own igloo, which can be ski in/ski out, which is very convenient. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the airport.
The most important thing to mention: My friend and I forgot to return the skis because we were novices and had no experience. As a result, we could not clear the record and return the snow card. However, the guy at the ski rental office (I forgot to ask his name, he was a fat guy) Liu Yanhui, the little brother who was at the rental counter at the time, was very enthusiastic to help us, telling us where to go to watch the surveillance and who to contact. At the same time, they also comforted us, and we got very beneficial help at the moment when we were very panicked. Helped me to sort out my clues and finally successfully retrieved the ski equipment. Thank you very much to these two brothers! ! ! ! ! ! !

msg:Out of trust, I booked Hyatt again this time when I went to Changbai Mountain. Unexpectedly, this time it was very disappointing. The room we booked includes some additional benefits, such as skiing. It states that skiing for two adults and one child is included. Children only need to be 12 years old or younger. Our child’s birthday is in December 2011, so it stands to reason I am under 13 years old, which is the so-called 12 years old, which is in line with this "include". The check-in staff in the lobby rejected my question on this matter and claimed that this was their system setting and they could not give me any rights. . After I persisted, a manager-level person later made a separate order for me for a child, saying that there was no problem. But when my family was happily preparing to go skiing the next day, the staff at the ski resort told me that the child’s slip stated that he would be charged, so we could only explain the situation again at the ski reception desk. Once again, it took a long time. This incident greatly affected my impression of Hyatt. As a five-star established hotel, when your system settings do conflict with the publicly announced rights and interests requirements, can you have a more humane operation? In addition, the facilities in the room are old, the lights are dim, and the air conditioner is slow to heat up...there are certain problems. Another point is that we purchased the package of the Grand Hotel, which includes three meals a day. Breakfast is the hotel's normal breakfast service. There are several matching packages for you to choose from at noon. This is considered acceptable. But the dinner was really disappointing... The exclusive area is small, and there is no room for even a few people. Secondly, there are very few types of food, and there is nothing to eat. After looking at it, we immediately decided not to go there the second night. . In short, although we only stayed for a short two nights, it didn't feel like a five-star hotel at all. It's really not worth the price of several thousand a night! In fact, I stayed at the Crown Hot Spring Hotel for one night before staying at the Hyatt. Although the one-night price at the Crown is cheaper than the Hyatt, its service is really good. The butler will contact you before you check in and help you with everything. problems encountered. To be honest, Hyatt really needs to improve.

I asked the hotel to cancel the second night and stay one night to experience it. The hotel refused and asked to check in as scheduled. The arrival time on the first night was in the evening. It was after nine o'clock and I was quite tired. I didn't take a closer look at the room. When I woke up the next day, I found spider webs in many places in the hotel room. Upon closer inspection, I found spiders beside the tea cabinet. The wallpaper was lifted up in many places in the room and there were mold spots on the wall carpet. There were many cigarette butts on the balcony. On the second night of my stay, during breakfast, the first dish at the entrance of the restaurant, the kimchi, had hair-like foreign objects in it. In summary, the hotel's hygienic environment was poor. The hotel facilities are old and have many damaged corners. The bathrooms in the rooms are better and are made of Hansgrohe and Duravit. The hotel service staff are also quite enthusiastic. After leaving the store, complain to Ctrip customer service. Ctrip customer service handles the complaint quickly and efficiently.

In terms of Changbaishan Wanda Ski Resort, the location of Hyatt Hotel is relatively good. It is very close to the ski resort, has an outdoor hot spring, has its own ski equipment rental counter, and the service attitude of the service staff is also very good. There are also many breakfast varieties. The hotel's buffet dinner is very cost-effective. The hotel's facilities are a little old and need regular repairs and maintenance. The door of the room I stayed in this time is about to break, and it is difficult to push and gets stuck every time. In addition, it is now open to guests from outside hotels to come in and soak in the outdoor hot spring, which feels a bit mixed. In addition, the hygiene of various places needs to be improved, such as the toilets and showers in the guest rooms, the corners of public places, the ground of the swimming pool, and the seats in the corridor. The service staff at the front desk concierge are so-so. If it is not a project sold by him, he will not know anything. If it is not a project sold by me, he will not want to answer at all. I hope that all aspects will continue to maintain and improve, and I will come again next year.

msg:Staying at the Hyatt Regency was the most satisfying part of my free travel plan. Before departure, I was worried that I was not fully prepared for the trip, so I kept in touch with the concierge guy King on WeChat. He was very patient and answered all my questions. After checking in, the lady at the front desk welcomed us warmly and informed us in detail about the precautions and how to check into the hotel. To travel more comfortably in the resort, with these preparations, our family of four spent three nights and four days at the Hyatt Regency Hotel for a pleasant snow play trip. In the summer, we plan to take my mother to Changbai Mountain again. Of course, we will also Choose the Hyatt.

msg:It must have been a long, long time since I left a review on Ctrip. This time is an exception, because I really need to complain about the almost non-existent service at Hyatt Regency Changbaishan! Let me share a few things:
①About a week in advance, I called the hotel and informed me that New Year’s Eve was my wife’s birthday. Since it was relatively remote in Wanda Scenic Area, I wanted to ask the hotel to help make a cake. I didn’t mention it at first but it turned out that the hotel The staff told me very firmly and seriously that the date of the ID card must be verified, otherwise the cake would not be given. I said that if we celebrate our birthday on the ***** calendar, I can show you the photos I took of my wife’s birthday on 1119th of the ***** calendar every year. The hotel said, if you don’t want to see it or believe it, it won’t work. Although later after Ctrip intervened, the hotel still gave me a small cake, but the attitude of the staff, I really don’t know who gave me the courage.
② I asked Ctrip to help contact the hotel, hoping that their leader would call me to explain, because I was really angry. After staying in a hotel for two nights at a price of four to five thousand a night, would I cheat you with a cake? Then from beginning to end, the highest-level leader I contacted was the front office manager. When I checked in, the front office manager didn't even want to mention it. When I mentioned it, they had two attitudes: first, that's how we are, and second, you have to understand.
③Breakfast in the hotel, look at the last picture, "fresh" fruit at seven o'clock in the morning.

msg:The hotel is generally good and the service attitude is very good, both at the front desk and on the phone. The window faces the ski resort, and it feels very pleasant whether it is day or night. But there are a few more points: 1. The mattress is a bit old and will be dented in the middle; 2. The hair dryer that is not used in cheap hotel chains has been replaced. This one has a small air volume and a short cord. If you step back, the plug will become loose. 3. The door of the shower room cannot be closed easily due to the rubber *****s. Water spills outside when taking a shower, and there is a large puddle of water outside after taking a shower. It's impossible to separate wet and dry parts. 4. The lighting in the room is too dark, especially in the shower room. You can't see whether your face is washed or not, and you can't see anything clearly when removing makeup and putting on makeup.

msg:I went there on the first day and the room was super cold. I called the front desk and told the situation. It was too cold. I called a chef over and brought a temperature measuring instrument. He told us that his air conditioner was fine and left. But the room temperature was only 22 degrees. In a place as cold as Changbai Mountain, you can feel the cold wind in the room. So on the first night, I immediately caught a cold when I woke up. I couldn't stand it the next day, so I called the front desk. , let them solve it, and sent a guy over. The guy checked carefully and found that the balcony window was leaking air. He took something to seal it, and it improved a lot. In short, this hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room rate was 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a night, and the service experience was very poor in all aspects. There was very little food in the buffet restaurant, and they gave me a cold. I was worried about having a fever and asked the front desk for a thermometer. I called the front desk twice before it was delivered. All in all, it was a bad stay experience and the hotel facilities are also very old.

Because the hotel is so big, I forgot to bring my gloves when I went to the ski house. I was already panting when I ran down, but I ran up to get my gloves. They were too thick and I almost gave myself a heatstroke🥹
Everyone must remember to bring their belongings......

During the National Day, there weren’t many people. It was just me and my family who went up the mountain on the wooden plank road. It was really nice to leisurely watch the forest-dyed mountain scenery!

Facilities: Although the hotel is a bit old, I don't feel it after experiencing it. The American retro feel is very relaxing.

The complimentary benefits seem to be more than other hotels. I stayed for two days without going to Tianchi and did not use up the benefits.

ps: The dog family is so cute!

msg:I strongly recommend the Hyatt Hotel in Wanda Resort. First of all, the location is very advantageous. It is within walking distance to Hallasan Hot Spring and Water World. The back door is the commercial street, and it is also convenient to eat! If you ski in winter, it can be said that it is the most convenient hotel close to the cableway and snow house! Although it is a few years old, I thought the facilities would be relatively old, but surprisingly, the room is decorated in a retro style and the style is still online! The most yyds is that I upgraded the mountain view room, which is a great view! The summer benefits given by the hotel are enough to play for a whole day! There is no queue at all to play the slide and the slide at 2-3 pm. It feels great to have a slide alone! ! Going to the hot spring and water world at 4-5 pm can also be said to be a perfect way to avoid the crowd. There are hotel buses to the West Slope Visitor Center or airport pick-up, which saves a lot of transportation costs. Changbai Mountain taxis are not cheap. There is no formal meter, and it is all a fixed price... It is 40 yuan one-way to the West Slope Visitor Center. For transportation within the resort, there are ** electric vehicles. Download the app and scan the code to ride, and you can ride freely within the resort. Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay! I look forward to skiing in winter!

msg:When traveling in this hot summer, in addition to avoiding the hot weather, my biggest hope is to go to Changbai Mountain to see the whole Tianchi. I decisively booked the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Wanda Resort. After leaving Changbaishan Airport, I took the red free bus of Wanda Resort. The private car went smoothly. There were Wanda Resort service staff on the car who gave tour explanations and added WeChat messages. It took about 30 minutes to arrive at the first stop, which was the Hyatt Hotel we booked. The people who received me were Suzanna and Lune, who had contacted me the day before. They enthusiastically helped us introduce the facilities of the entire hotel, the entertainment activities provided, and answered our questions cordially. They also helped us upgrade to a room with a great view. From the balcony, we had an unobstructed view of the resort hotel buildings, ropeways, grassland, mountain views, etc. The interior decoration of the room is mainly in wood color, which is warm and relaxing, just like Hyatt's usual style. The resort's peak season is skiing in winter, and summer is considered the off-season, but it is a good place to escape the heat with few people. The trees are lush, the slides are covered with small flowers, and it also provides a number of free entertainment activities, which are very cost-effective. Catering is Hyatt's strength. The breakfast at the Market Cafe is rich in items, many of which are freshly made by the chef. I especially like the ravioli and homemade yogurt. The happy hour at the Grand Club dinner is changed to a la carte style. The food is exquisite and delicious. The cozy dining environment is much better than the commercial street restaurants directly connected to the hotel. I stayed at the Hyatt for two nights. In the afternoon of the first day, I took the cable car to the top of the mountain to view the scenery, played the exciting Zhengxi Slide, and went to Halla Mountain Hot Spring to bathe in the hot springs. It was a great experience. On the second and third days, we went to visit the scenic spots on the west slope and south slope of Changbai Mountain respectively. The weather was so great that we were lucky enough to see the complete beauty of Tianchi, which was very shocking. This good luck and the home-like service provided by Suzanna and Lune made this trip even more perfect and unforgettable.

The ski resort is just outside the snow house, which is super convenient.

Good service, slightly outdated facilities.

There are many activities in the hotel, and there is not enough fun.

Go again in the snow season next year.

The restaurants in the downstairs town mainly focus on Northeast Korean specialties. There are also KFC and Pizza Hut Starbucks, which is very convenient. Every Hyatt staff member is very friendly and enthusiastic. The cleaning at the front desk includes the snow house reception, and they can provide various suggestions and services for travel and accommodation in detail, and they are very considerate of the guests. The whole experience is quite comfortable and secure.

Hyatt has its own ski house, which is very convenient and is the first choice for skiing in Wanda Resort.
By the way, the most important point is that Hyatt is very a**ospheric, unlike some hotels that turn down the air conditioner in the middle of the night, Hyatt's room is warm throughout the night, and it is well received. Hyatt will be closed on March 15, and will reopen in the summer.

I have my own igloo, and the ropeway is just outside the igloo, which is really convenient. Please see the difference between Figure 1 and Figure 2, the ski service center rents ski equipment and the Hyatt snow house rents ski equipment in the same time period. It’s not that other hotels are not good, but that even if other hotels have igloos, they still have to slide down and take the ropeway after changing their equipment, which is not very friendly to novices. In addition, Hyatt's breakfast is better than Jinhua Resort and Sheraton.

I did a lot of homework before the trip. I chose Hyatt to stay. I am satisfied with the hotel environment. It is very convenient to eat and ski. It may be that the number of guests suddenly increased, and the cleaning of the hotel was very sloppy, but it was rectified quickly after the comments were made. The hotel staff are friendly, and the above is praise. But the overall service level still needs to be improved. When I checked in, the front desk did not give a good introduction to the various service facilities. I called again and again to ask about the dining time and place, fitness and swimming, and there was no service manual in the room. In addition, the room provides free breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child. The child has just turned 12 years old. I offered to make up the difference, but I was charged for the three-day adult breakfast. ?

I encountered some problems when renting boards at the igloo. They were shirking responsibility and saying that the igloo was run by Wanda. But the name of the snow house is "Hyatt Snow House", and if something goes wrong, it is run by Wanda.
Because it was Chris**as, there were fireworks at the ski resort at night. No one told us, it was the restaurant owner on the commercial street who said it. Then I asked the hotel housekeeper, and then a poster was sent to me on WeChat. Why didn't you tell me earlier if there was an event poster?
At this price and with such hotel facilities, it is totally not worth it.

Location:
There is a Wanda red bus to pick you up from Changbaishan Airport. Just tell the bus driver to go to the Hyatt. It takes about 20 minutes to drive from the airport. It is the first stop and is delivered directly to the door of the hotel.

Room size:
The room is of medium size, with a king size double bed, which is very comfortable. The room has a small terrace, and the scenery outside the window is very exotic. The sound insulation of the room: very good, overall very satisfied

Value for money:
I booked a room type in the Grand Club, which has many services. Although the price is higher, you can basically have three meals and lunch in the hotel. The meals are delicious and well worth it. When staying at the Hyatt, there is a snow pass, which is minus 1 After renting the equipment at the igloo, you can go to the ski resort in one second. It is very convenient for snow lovers who like to ski.

Now this season, there is a gingerbread house and an oversized Chris**as tree in the lobby. The overall decoration is also very warm, giving people a very warm and comfortable feeling.

In the past two years, I have gone to various combinations 5 or 6 times, each time for skiing, and I never hesitated about Park Hyatt or other snow areas, just because of the good service and good service.

I went there with my friends in the last two weeks, because there were very few people due to the epidemic, but the service, catering and hygiene are all online. It is said that the room I have been staying in has just been disinfected because of the epidemic. The lobby manager accompanied me to look at each room. Which view do you like? until satisfied.

I booked for 4 nights, and the last day was booked through the Hyatt applet on a whim. There was no option for breakfast + ski tickets.

Later, on the third day, I felt unwell and needed to leave the store. I just wanted to go home as soon as possible. It was obviously not allowed to cancel the room. As a result, Hyatt called to initiate a refund and wish you well...

Skiing should be a sport that I will persist in, and I will still experience it everywhere in the world, but Hyatt Changbaishan is a place worth going to even if I don’t have a direct flight, because of my heart.

This Hyatt is really a terrible experience
I don’t know how dare I say I’m a five-star, gold diamond
On the first day when we arrived at the store, the front desk asked questions and answered questions. We didn’t take the initiative to inform the guests of the hotel’s necessary check-in information. As a result, we didn’t even know which elevator was closest to our room, and the whole hotel ran around.
The room facilities are old, we were prepared, but we didn't expect that the bluetooth in the room is broken, the toilet is not smart, the air conditioner blows cold air at night, and the water temperature of the whole faucet can't be touched directly by hand. Cannot be adjusted! ! The sanitation in the room is worrying, the bedding is flawed, the glass is full of dust, and! ! There is no minibar! ! Nearly 3000 a night, there are only two bottles of mineral water in the whole room! ! !
Besides the service part, there are only a few sheets of paper in the room that are in the end, but no one answered the switchboard! After retyping, I sent a tissue for an hour. I asked the young man in the concierge depar**ent some directions in the hotel in the morning, and he told me directly. He is a newcomer and doesn't know anything, so he can't go back and ask his colleagues when he is by his side? ? What kind of job are you not trained for? ?
The waiters in the entire hotel never greeted people, as if they owed money, it was really funny. Staying at Hyatt is also the failure of this itinerary.
What's even more ridiculous is that I posted a circle of friends, because I lived in Park Hyatt the day before, and it was an employee of the same group of Park Hyatt who gave me feedback and dealt with it. What's more, from the time I reported it to when I left the store, I didn't receive a word of apology, and I didn't even get in touch with me. It's absolutely amazing. .
Seriously do not recommend this shabby hotel. . What a failure, the fee does not match the service

When we entered the resort, we felt that we could enjoy the sight, a piece of greenery + a little autumn The view + Hyatt's design. Because we stayed for three nights, the lady at the front desk gave us a good view to see the ski slopes. The entire hotel is made of wood and stone.

Go up the cable car to see Changbai Mountain in the distance, and play the grass car. On the mountain There is a dinosaur coffee shop which is very special, and I also experienced the Hallasan hot spring. This is for the public, so the experience is average. On the third day, I chartered a car from the south slope to Tianchi. It is really worth it. It was closed due to heavy snow in the first two or three days. Going up the mountain, and finally notifying the day before leaving that you can go up the mountain again, it is really lucky! However, the waiting time at the checkpoint to enter the nucleic acid test is too long, nearly an hour, but fortunately, the wait is worth it.

Manager Yue of the western restaurant is also very enthusiastic. When we decided to go to Songjianghe Forest Park, he helped us pack the bread and fruit for us. Thank you very much. I hope to experience the different scenery of Changbai Mountain again in winter. This trip is an unforgettable memory.
I just hope that the hot water in the hotel can be hotter, otherwise the mountain is colder and the bathing pool is not suitable.

msg:Very satisfying experience!
1. We booked for 3 nights in a row, and we were upgraded to a suite as soon as we arrived. Taking a hot spring every day is what my daughter is most looking forward to! The slide is ranked second haha
2. You must take the cable car presented by the hotel. The view from the top of the mountain is very good.
3. The hotel service is very heart-warming. I brought a cosmetic bag and cosmetics, and the waiter will put a towel for me, so as not to get wet. It’s so considerate
4. There is a business district near the Hyatt Hotel. There are various restaurants, which are very convenient, but the restaurants are very expensive. If you have enough time, take a taxi to the nearby village to eat
5. The hotel is very close to the west slope of Changbai Mountain. It is strongly recommended to buy tickets in advance and rent clothes at the bottom of the mountain. My daughter was so cold that she burst into tears when she went up to the top of the mountain.

msg:After booking the hotel, because the price was reduced, I complained to Ctrip and refunded the price difference. The complaint is still fruitful, thank you very much.
Wanda is on the west slope of Changbai Mountain. If you want to go to the north slope, it’s a bit far away, but the overall hotel experience is still super good. I went to Le Nanpo Tianchi for a better view, and it’s still interesting to go up to the North Korean border. It’s the first time Friends who go to Changbai Mountain still recommend going to the North Slope.
The day before going to North Slope, I booked a round-trip chartered car with the hotel manager for us. The manager is still very professional, @King
On the night of check-in, I had a drink at the bar at the front desk of the hotel. The bartender lady was super honest, because it was the off-season. The bartender sister said that she hadn’t seen anyone chatting all day. We were the first guests, so she suggested we go. South slope, after all, we have been to the north slope. @ bartender sister
.
Summary: Because it is an off-season hotel to upgrade the room, there are few guests and the scenery is good
I wait for them to open in November, and I will go again. After all, the service experience I feel is very good.

msg:I read a lot of reviews before traveling to Changbai Mountain, and finally chose the Hyatt Hotel. Very satisfied after check-in. The location is excellent, the commercial street of the town is just outside the back door of the hotel. Whether you go to the nucleic acid testing site, Hannashan Hot Spring, or Wanda Water Park, you are all within five minutes' walk. Opened in 2013, the facilities are well maintained. The whole decoration uses a lot of solid wood, stone and brass, which is very high-end. The hotel's services include airport shuttle bus, Halla Mountain hot spring tickets, sightseeing cable car🚡, Wanda Water Park, and water amu*****t projects. Especially suitable for bringing children on summer vacation. Breakfast is the breakfast of a well-behaved five-star hotel, with everything you should have. Every day at 10 o'clock in the morning, a family of three Alaskan sled dogs who grew up in Hyatt will interact with guests in the lobby, super cute and super obedient. When you come to Changbaishan Wanda Resort, just close your eyes and book Hyatt!

msg:Seriously give an evaluation.
Overall: Not worth the price, more expensive than Park Hyatt, smaller rooms, worse facilities
1. Room facilities are impersonal:
1) The sound insulation is very poor. You can clearly hear people walking and talking at night and in the morning. There is a high probability of being woken up
2) There is no shower in the bathtub. When you get up to take a shower in the bathtub, you have to go to the shower by yourself
3) With only two bottles of water and two pairs of slippers, children are barefoot
4) The door of the bathroom will slide open quietly after you close it, and the whole door slips out to see the decoration opening; the bathtub drains for several hours, unless you manually turn the switch and do not relax (you can see that the details are not good inspection and maintenance)
2. The service is pretty good, except: in the morning, I asked the porter to help me pick up the luggage, but it turned out that I had finished breakfast (this description is a bit exaggerated, it took about 20 minutes to take the luggage downstairs and store it after breakfast) and I saw the service when I went up born

The bathroom floor tiles are disconnected and not replaced, and guests are still allowed to stay in. What should I do in case of any accident? In addition, the staff should also improve their understanding of the hotel facilities and rules. After asking a few questions, they do not know the answer. The most outrageous thing is that they do not know whether the guests need to pay extra for using the hot spring and the last admission time of the hot spring.

When you come to Changbai Mountain, don't stay in this hotel. It's a thunderbolt! The service of the express hotel is not as good as the first one at the door, there is no one to greet the guest, let alone the luggage, and then to the front desk, there is a fat woman who is checking in. I will call you to cancel the order and drive you away. Then this kind of golden diamond hotel does not welcome fruit, only two bottles of Nongfu Spring mineral water, and there is no minibar. Let's not talk about it, let's buy it yourself! Very poor sense of service, no service at all (I want to live in an express hotel, I will do everything by myself, and I will not talk about service, but please, this is a golden diamond) No one answered the phone at the restaurant at 10:30, and I asked to send some toiletries for an hour! I feel like there is no service here, and the phone is out of power in the middle of the night. Bao called the front desk for three or four times, but no one answered and said that he was on duty alone and told me that the charger was out of power. You should run out of electricity. Tomorrow, someone else will check out and give you a ride. Every time I stay at Hyatt, I am full of fire This is definitely not the case with any of the Marriott Group hotels‼ ️

I have never seen the minibar of the Golden Diamond Hotel so empty
I really can't live to laugh. Why are you a golden diamond? Why five stars?
Is there a rating for a trip buy? ? ? Where did the confidence come from? ? ? What is the deposit for? To be funny? ?
Don't say I haven't stayed in a good hotel. Picture 3456789 attached a few minibars that a normal hotel of this level should have

msg:On the first night of my stay, I found a big spider in the bathtub. I thought that it might be crawling out of the sewer, so I quickly pressed it to death. On the third night of my stay, there was also a big spider on the top of the bed. It was similar in size to the one in the bathtub before, with a diameter of 4 It was about centimeters. Since the roof couldn't handle it by itself, I quickly dialed extension 0 in the room. After the call, I couldn't find the spider until the room service staff arrived. We used the mobile phone flashlight to take a picture, and finally found the big spider on the roof beam. The waiter I vacuumed the spider down and ****** it up. Due to the fright and fear of spiders running away, I didn't have time to take pictures. In the end, after negotiating with the hotel through Ctrip, I did not get any apology from the hotel, not even an apology!
In addition, the toilet basin of the room I stayed at was slow to drain, and the water was almost full after brushing one's teeth. The shower room was also very old, and the bricks on the balcony suddenly fell off. Fortunately, we were not outside. The overall service level of the hotel is also uneven.
In short, if I go to Changbai Mountain Wanda Resort again, I will definitely not choose Hyatt. At that time, it was also because I booked a hotel temporarily, and Hyatt had a twin room, so I stepped on the pit! Although I am very dissatisfied with the hotel, I still thank Ctrip for coordinating this process!

msg:I really don't understand that the weather is 0-tens of degrees when I travel outside. I went to the front desk after taking a cold shower for two nights in Hyatt and responded and said whether we can't adjust it... Is the common sense guest still good? My friend's room is also sent by them I'll tell you to go and see if my aunt cleans the room, but she piles up the rubbish scattered on the table. I'm afraid of losing what the guests need. I understand, but the empty food bags and used warmers after eating. Do the baby’s packaging also need to be stacked together? (I didn’t throw it away because there is no garbage bag in the trash can) The pillow was dirty and rough, so I put it on the table behind it, but it was placed on the bed. I folded the towel and continued to use it at night. It was still damp to the touch. My own towel was placed on the edge of the bathtub. The new and old ones were also placed in the shower gel. The pain is very bad. The hotel said that there is no stomach medicine and they can't buy it on their behalf. They told them that there is a pharmacy nearby. You can go to the Ctrip customer service to ask how far the distance is. The answer is that the cost of the car is about 80. Is this not far from the neighborhood? Can a foreign guest stay in a state of health and can withstand such a toss? After buying the medicine on the road, the hotel told me that it can help me to buy it, but I need to sign an agreement to buy it. Can't I say it at first... The funny thing is that we went out and found the hotel There is a pharmacy in the food street that goes out from the back door. This is the first time that a pharmacy is so speechless. Is it already this level for a five-star service like Hyatt? The takeaway is not allowed to be delivered, and there is no robot for the customer to go down to pick it up... Just ask the staff to be self-reliant It's just this and that. I'll never consider Hyatt again.

The result is a free shuttle bus to the hotel and the airport. I imagined the capitalist Ctrip company too beautifully, thinking it was a special car.

msg:When I came to Changbai Mountain for skiing in the snow season, I booked the Hyatt Hotel after research and chose the right one. The hotel is very large and the design feels like a high-end ski house resort hotel. Chris and Scott at the front desk are very professional and caring. They have a good check-in experience. They have their own ski house and are easy to get in and out of the ski resort. The Chinese restaurant Yue Ting solved our dinner. The dishes have local characteristics and ensure the quality. The prices are very reasonable. There is also a Korean barbecue that is also worth a try.

There is no need to mention the hotel facilities. The facilities are good, the environment is good, and the rental of ski equipment is convenient for entering the ski resort. The most important thing is that the service is very good and the reception of the hotel is very friendly. Particularly patient and enthusiastic, especially Ren Liping and Wang Mingxin. Thank you so much! The first day we arrived was my child’s birthday, and we specially prepared cake candles for us. The child was so happy that he repeatedly told me that we must come to Hyatt again!

Fun: In addition to the package included in the resort, don’t miss the hiking trail behind the hotel, the environment is good and there are few people; the two dogs are very cute, you can make an appoin**ent to take pictures and walk the dogs

Service: Breakfast was refreshed, because I didn’t have the slide project to compensate for the afternoon tea. Others are not lost. Compared with the butler service and extra bed provided by Crowne Plaza North Slope, the temperature is still a little bit less. Originally, Hyatt and Park Hyatt is positioned higher than Crowne Plaza, but I don’t feel the comparison here~

msg:This counts as the first hotel bad review I gave, but this bad review is based on the lowest price of 4000+/night in the peak season. If the price is around 1000 in the off-season, it may be a general dissatisfaction, not so The feeling of a serious IQ tax.

Let me say it first. The location of the hotel is very good. It is very convenient to have its own ski in/ski out. Basically, it is the entrance of the cable car.

In general, the hotel facilities are older. The TV in my room is directly used, the luggage counter is not available, and the wifi signal is not good, but the stay is okay. The food is average, the breakfast types and tastes are very average, the room service options are few and it is not delicious, but the Chinese restaurant tastes good.

Okay, let’s talk about the service and share my wonderful experience:
1) In the hotel’s introduction to the restaurant, I found a good-looking Korean restaurant Changbai Inn. The phone couldn’t get through. After looking around, I was told that it was outside the hotel, between Hyatt and Park Hyatt. The hotel concierge told me It’s very close and it’s easy to find. I just went to the next step and then the next step. I didn’t wear my jacket at the time (because I confirmed with the waiter that it was so close), I believed it, and it turned out to be ten degrees below zero. When I arrived at Park Hyatt, I didn't see the restaurant 🙂
The staff at Park Hyatt reminded me that this restaurant must be reserved at least one day in advance, and it’s useless to go directly 🙂

2) When I was preparing to take a bath at night, I found that there was no hair dryer-I encountered it for the first time in a five-star hotel. After calling, I was told that I had to look for it because it was too late.

3) On the last day, I was temporarily notified that the return flight time was changed. It was 4 hours late. I asked the hotel shuttle time. I was told that the shuttle would only follow the original time. I also asked if I could check out 1 hour late. I was told that the check-in was too full. , Must check out on time. Okay, I sat in the lobby bar of the hotel and worked for a while. At 1:30, I found that I had forgotten something in the room. I went to the front desk and asked and found that the room hadn't been cleaned at all (later I went upstairs and found that it was just cleaning). Therefore, you must be free for more than an hour, and you can’t understand the guests’ need from time to time to let them stay for a while 👍🏻

Let’s just talk about it. I’ve stayed at Hyatt a lot, and this time it’s a very special experience. If it wasn’t for the brand, I wouldn’t be so disappointed.

The breakfast is also good, suitable for the taste of southerners. In short, the next time you ski is likely to choose here again.

Ski house dumplings, the noodles are good, go and deal with a few bites, and immediately get off the ski. Going out is the resort area, so it's very convenient to go shopping and eat. The hotel spa is good.
Disadvantages: The cabinet is too small to hang a few clothes. But it's good to give a lot of hangers.
The room is big enough, because of skiing, the room is only used for bathing and sleeping, so the requirements are not so high.

住這裏很方便，酒店後門穿出去小鎮上有吃有喝有玩，不想出度假區就在裏面吃，出去的話我們就去松江河鎮吃

滑雪場有家叫“炸物”的千萬別去，態度特別差，東西又死貴，6串小臘腸，2串香腸（超瘦版），一小盒雞柳（7、8根）總共要99元，宰客太厲害，康師傅紅燒牛肉麪，加了幾塊牛肉片收28元，後來我們晚上逛了小鎮上看到有好多吃的
萌寵樂園挺坑的，不建議遊玩，但是周圍的一片森林雪地可以踩一踩，來自上海的小土豆在這裏放煙花放的也很爽，天天放，有小店賣也有街邊棚子裏，購買點挺多的

差評：
1.設施：衞生間沒有排風，廁所反味嚴重。每天不得不隨時把廁所門關緊。
2.服務：酒店人員禮貌意識淡薄。除了上述好評人員，其餘酒店員工在走廊上，在任何角落，見到客人直接無視，不會禮貌打招呼。這是在其他凱悦酒店不會發生的。
3.凱悦滑雪屋：借租衣服處的一個高瘦帶眼鏡的年輕男孩，服務態度很差，眼神可以殺**。來滑雪的客人還要看你臉色嗎？嚴重差評！哪怕是季節性員工，也請凱悦認真挑選，認真培訓再上崗。

酒店位置方便，KFC 星巴克 麥當勞 必勝客
各種餐館 還有超市，酒店B1的門可以直通。

服務：正常酒店的服務 ，有禮貌，但沒有特別出彩的地方 ，我們對這些也沒有特殊要求
但是！能不能在出現由於你們的問題導致住客無語的時候，先別找蹩腳的理由或者質問嗎？
不應該先妥善解決問題嗎？！
1、房間空調是壞的，都不如樓道涼快，我和孩子爸爸熱的一宿基本沒睡，前台説來給修，修不好給換房間。
第二天來修，根本沒用，温度依舊降不下去，給前台打電話，又質疑和質問我們是要換房間嗎？！
無語了…… 空調是壞的，難道你不應該解決嗎？而且也是你們提出的解決方案啊！
2、換了新房間，晚上蓋被子睡覺，房內温度舒適，但也挺逗的，玩一天回來，累夠嗆，進不去房間了，等好久服務員才幫着來開門，禮賓部給送房卡，給的解釋是房卡消磁……，這麼多年住酒店，頭一回遇到，給你們“點贊”
衞生：看圖吧！
設施：這個更牛，看圖吧！
環境：陽台外可以看到特別好看的景色，也算治癒了酒店給我帶來的無奈😮💨。
早餐：太普通了，種類、花樣都一般

旅遊旺季，酒店的價格其實並不算便宜，不期待物超所值，但五星酒店最基本的配套和設施、衞生等，還是略有失望。

一進大堂，就覺得大氣明亮，平時玩累了就在大堂的沙發，搖椅上休息，拍照也好看。前台服務耐心周到，餐廳活動中心的服務更棒，熱情的不得了。特別是活動中心的小哥哥，很耐心的介紹各種娛樂設施，陪我們射箭，爸媽對這裏的服務讚不絕口。
房間中規中規，是一貫的凱悦水準。早餐現做的大餅特別好吃，每次都要吃2個。中餐廳的鍋包肉的確的一絕，價格不貴量也大。唯一不太滿意的是198一位的自助晚餐，沒有什麼好吃的。

msg:設施陳舊，但是非常乾淨，酒店有自己的滑雪屋，可以免費租用滑雪用具，直接酒店滑到雪道，非常方便，酒店後面出去就是度假小鎮，吃飯逛街很方便，酒店內的游泳池和温泉池，桑拿房也很乾凈，方便，早餐豐富，餐廳工作人員都非常熱情，友好，門口行李員樂於助人，打掃衞生的保潔工非常有禮貌，有求必應，酒店員工工作態度都非常好，廁所隔音不好，走廊裏每個路過房間的聲音，在廁所裏都能身臨其境的感受到，廁所通風煙道里，每天都會傳來其他房間的香煙味，希望能有所改進。希望酒店在提升價格的同時，也提升一下硬件，比如洗漱用品，茶葉包，咖啡包，和房價匹配一下。

msg:非常不滿意的住店，4600一晚房間老舊，服務差勁。聖誕節有很高的溢價，但就算是平時的2000多一晚也非常不值得，裝修很老，早飯是真的難吃🙃🙃🙃

滑雪屋一直是賣點，其實真的不怎麼樣。我媽穿35碼鞋子小了，要換36，一下子給拿了38….. 導致走出去後特別不舒服，也不想走回去換，就不滑了🫤🫤🫤服務中心的櫃子50一個，用二維碼租賃，非常方便，出門也是雪場了。但是凱悦的70一個小箱子，90一個大的，按金500！用的還是原始手牌，在後麪換衣服的時候把手牌放在椅子上被其他換衣服的人拿走了。後來我們在那邊等了1個多小時讓他們調監控查詢，結果服務人員説攝像頭看不清櫃子號碼查不出來…… 如此貴价酒店設施如此垃圾… 損失500按金呵呵….

説實話萬達雪場環境確實很好，以後還回去，但絕對不會選擇凱悦

過程中沒有人打過我任何電話。
 


犯錯就算了，這樣的工作態度不應該出現在任何五星級酒店。

滑雪屋租賃設備有序，但離魔毯略遠，要步行五分鐘以上。
酒店負一樓後門連結商業大街，用餐購物很便利。離漢拿山温泉可以步行，也可以坐擺渡車。
附近雪地摩託、雪上樂園、動物餵養地方都特別大，森林徒步也很有感覺。
帶孩子初次體驗滑雪和冰雪遊樂，萬達的配套是最齊全的，凱悦體驗感不錯。
辦理入住時間太長，下午四點才入住，等了一個多小時。

1:第一天入住放下行李就出去逛了，回來發現門口幾個小姐姐等着，説進去我房間過了，看到有行李就退出來了，然後我的房卡刷不出了！她們入住辦理是同一個房間！就是一個管理混亂！第三天滑完雪累的半死準備回房間，房卡又刷不出了，還得跑到前台重新刷房卡，是不是有毒啊？
2.第三天穿了三天一次性拖鞋覺得太臟了，打電話讓重新送一雙，過了三小時，也沒送過來，就去吃飯了，一雙一次性拖鞋你們給不起？！辦房卡時去前台反應才送過來！
3.離開時落下一個限定款抱枕，讓酒店寄到付件，結果電話號碼莫名其妙留了別人的，導致我跟快遞員溝通很久才拿到！你們凱悦的管理能不能正常點兒，隨便一個酒店以上三種錯誤都不會有的吧！
垃圾！以後長白山不會在住凱悦酒店，奉勸大家也別住，服務意識查，管理混亂，還有吃的賊賊賊難吃！！房間老化，衞生工作不認真，特別中午飯，這是五星級酒店的水準？服了！還有很多細節不一一接列舉了！！沒拍照房間不行！

漢拿山温泉2大1小門票（入住期間僅1次）:跟其他地方的温泉酒店比起來有點小，但畢竟不是温泉度假酒店，🌟🌟🌟
早餐:中規中矩，小朋友喜歡煎餅
水樂園2大1小門票（入住期間僅1次）:這個蠻好玩的，有定時的人造浪🌊，小朋友玩的非常開心，可以租泳圈，但是比較大，建議小朋友可以自帶泳圈。

值得再入住.

首先説設施，萬達區的酒店大多是12/13年落成，且沒有從介紹上看出哪家有過裝修，所以新舊程度大同小異。凱悦的山景大床和行政大床房型和大小是一樣的，衹不過行政大床可以享受行政樓層的權益；豪華大床沒有山景景觀，但房間大15平米，這對需要加床的我們很重要，因此我們捨棄了山景。酒店位置非常好，後門正對商業街和超市，離權益裏的水樂園也很近。
再説服務，我對凱悦的服務非常滿意，有免費班車接送機，酒店免費權益很好玩，所有服務生都很親切熱情，沒有大酒店慣常的職業禮貌但冷漠的微笑。門僮小哥衹要發現客人要出門就趕緊跑去開門，客房打掃和送水也很快，入住期間我家崽崽生病，市集咖啡廳的服務生送了兩次免費的白粥和鹹菜，十分貼心。

點名感謝Suzanna！住店前打電話對度假區進行詳細的介紹，並對天氣做出提醒，住店期問持
續一對一對景區各個景點進行指導和介紹，服務
無可挑剔，三千元以下的酒店能有這樣的服務我
是不敢想象的谷凱悦的評級，柏悦的服務，超級高的性價比，在我心目中是全球最好凱悦！

整體裝修風格是美式度假小屋風，很多原木的裝飾，感覺還是比較温馨的，而且房間有陽台，泳衣啥的晾乾比較方便。服務也不錯，反饋了衞生問題後能立馬解決並給到一些補償措施。而且很加分的一點是能擼汪汪！太可愛了！
缺點有幾個：1.房間風景一般，看出去就是酒店入口，基本沒啥風景；2.房間衞生有待改善，剛入住發現馬桶圈上有污漬…如上文所述反饋後酒店態度很好地請阿姨重新打掃了，但凱悦有這種衞生問題也很不應該吧（吧枱上的裝飾厚厚一層灰塵我也就不説了）；3.客房服務有點慢，請酒店送瓶水過來什麼的要等半小時
總的來説要來萬達的話值得住，但不建議去漢拿山温泉，很臟人很多！泡完皮膚過敏了…

msg:凱悦地理位置絕佳，出門就是雪場，以後冬天來長白山滑雪還是會繼續選擇凱悦！淡季出遊很開心，前台給安排了景觀房，圖一就是從陽台看出去的景色！從酒店後門出去就是商業街，離各種飯店很近
整個酒店是木質裝修，很有瑞士木屋的味道，温暖又有質感
酒店的服務非常好！從延吉、北坡皇冠一路住過來，是服務最好的酒店！禮賓部Allen有問必答，有求必應，幫忙確認天池的開放情況，預約機場巴士，還可以找他幫忙預約包車！可以説是非常省心了
還要誇下酒店的阿姨，去天池玩了一天，回來看到阿姨幫忙把化粧品擺成了圖二這樣，不僅墊了毛巾，還擺了造型，一整個被可愛到了
酒店套餐包含的纜車和滑道也值得一去，滑道太刺激了！好玩！水上樂園因為時間不夠沒有去。度假區內的漢拿山温泉我們去的那天人超級多，體驗感不好
酒店早餐一般，但是足夠吃飽吃好
總體來説值得推薦！！

2. 滑雪配套：在酒店房間就可以看到雪場，雪場跟酒店直接聯通，非常方便，所有雪具都可以租到，很方便。作為初學者的滑雪體驗特別棒。
3. 餐飲：嘉賓軒的晚飯要單獨誇一下，特別是鍋包肉，特別好吃，希望下次來還能吃到。早餐也很不錯，什麼都有，豆漿很香，甚至還有現烤的饢。服務員也很温和。

msg:因為松花湖天氣轉暖，滑雪衹能來長白山。選擇凱悦的原因很簡單，距離雪場入口最近。頭對頭對比松花湖王子，房間比王子更modern，住起來很舒服。酒店裡的中餐廳價格非常合理，我們兩個人叫了好幾個菜包含當地特色鹿肉，最後消費也衹有400+（對比三亞威斯汀，一盤宮保蝦球398）。酒店裡的嘉賓軒很有特色，傍晚有免費的簡餐提供（吃的人很多）。居住的每個晚上會去泡一壺茶，看看書，最後灌進保温杯夜裡喝。臨走的一天，嘉賓軒的Suzanne還送了一衹很可愛的毛絨小動物，雖然現在也不知道是什麼。

後邊是雪場的對比，小夥伴更喜歡長白山，説人比松花湖少很多。長白山雪場和松花湖相比，因為山勢的原因，雪道短。而且我認為雪道設計不是很合理。比如紳士和小紳士進階後衹能滑小白虎，造成很多人擁擠在小白虎的入口（還有很多**）。小白虎相同難度的雪道長白山沒有第二條，後邊很多很多黑道（比如白虎，小將軍，大將軍，以及上帥索的各個雪道）。我的觀察，雪場基本還是以初學者為主，過多的黑道沒太大用處（比如白虎上人一直很少），建議增加2-3條藍道。

msg:説實話是我住過的這個級別酒店裡性價比最低的了
要不是有雪場和滑雪屋，真不會來這裏
優點先説説：
酒店各人員培訓到位，服務態度很好，很友善
酒店環境優雅温馨
嘉賓軒管中餐和晚餐，非常方便，就是晚餐桌子太少了
地點極好，去雪場和去小鎮都極為方便，出門隔壁就一家超市可以方便的補充物資
以上均不愧為五星酒店，度假區最好酒店之一
下面談談不足的地方
首先就是房價離譜，特別是今年，你可以説是捆綁雙人每日雪票，不過你也沒提供個不含雪票的房價給我選擇啊，這對不滑雪的遊客來説是不是不公平
酒店有點老舊，特別是房間設施
iPhone14都出來了，床頭提供的充電接口還是iPhone4時代的
手機成了人手一個的時代，床頭插座都沒多設幾個，床頭的照明開關設計也很反人類不方便
房間陽台門鎖是壞的，不用點技巧是關不上的，反正我老婆和孩子就關不上。
衞生間的門是壞的，我用盡方法和力量也關不上，衹能虛掩着
一個房間三個門，好在房間大門是可以關的，囧
這麼一個五星酒店，收費超4千的，房間很小，衹有30多平吧，來滑雪本來東西都多，導致房間到處都堆滿了
這個級別價位的五星酒店，我還是第一次看到衞生間這麼小的，衹有一個面盆，
廁所和淋浴也非常小，都2023年了，也不給配個智能馬桶蓋
更加沒有晾掛衣服的地方，來滑雪都是要住幾天的，衣服沒地方晾
房間沒給供暖，我一個南方人，難得來北方雪國，本想體會一下傳説中的集中供暖，房間短袖的舒爽，結果你就給個空調吹
室外零下多少度？這個室外温度下，空調的制熱效果可想而知的，冷確實不冷，但也不暖和
房間有暖氣片，衹是沒開
總的來説估計就是十年前的設施，缺乏保養維護，給了頂級五星的價格，住了快捷酒店的房間的感覺
管理方怎麼也不給酒店重新裝修升級一下，房費收這麼多，應該也不會缺錢啊，難道説資金去向迷了，投資不過山海關的説法又有一個例證了？
非雪季有三個季度，遊客沒那麼多，完全可以這個時候施工的
下面是居住建議
不在乎性價比的，就是來每天滑雪的，完全可以入住，的確方便，服務也很好
房間的體驗不好，也許我這個丐版的房間才這樣，推薦去嘗試更高檔的客房，也許就沒這些問題

相比柏悦同集團性價比更高
房間滿滿美式度假風
純木質裝修舒適放鬆
交通便利機場免費大巴20分鐘
去西坡集散中心免費大巴20多分鐘
玩了酒店送的權益很值喔
我去的時候正直秋季的尾巴
度假村算是淡季風景宜人

msg:1.接送機很方便，除了機場有引導人員，送到酒店門口
2.禮賓部Allen，王浩，還有個小夥子忘記名字了，都非常熱情好客，好評點贊
3.整個酒店是美式鄉村風，設施有些舊但是還行對得起價格
4.房間打掃在我入住第二天打掃得不錯，後面可能換班了，沒有給新的浴袍，也沒有清理浴缸
5.淡季前往人不算很多，所以設施基本都沒人，餐廳也同理，沒能嚐到長白驛站的烤肉，悦庭的中餐吃了兩次，總體推薦，小雞燉蘑菇不建議點，雞肉比較老，當然，這是一道耗時間的菜，往往客人等不了那麼久
6. 早餐一般，口味一般，人少的時候才有服務人員幫忙接咖啡，人多沒人管…
7.去商業街一開始我們不認識，從大門走出去了，導致繞了個超級大遠路，大家記得從後門走（滑雪屋方向），直達！
8.天池沒那麼容易看到，輕敵了，如果不開放景區，你要在酒店消磨很久時間，下次來我想我還會選擇這兒

禮賓部Allen非常熱心，房間有問題送來了新房卡還幫忙搬東西，對各個要去的地方也很瞭解，能準確地給出建議，還主動幫忙接送至度假區裏的娛樂場所，每次在大堂遇到也能很親切地主動打招呼。

在前台辦理入住的時候，本來是一個小夥子接待的，態度比較冷淡做事也慢悠悠，因為比較晚了催促讓他稍微快一點但還是很墨跡，詢問度假區娛樂設施營業時間，也一問三不知，反而和我説起早餐時間。後來一旁的Alisa告知我掃碼就可以看到電子票和營業時間了，Alisa後來又主動跟進了解我們的房間狀況，聽到我嗓子不舒服還多讓人送了一台加濕器來。

msg:與夫人來長白旅遊提前在協程訂的凱越酒店 想象中的凱越酒店一定不錯可到了之後大跌眼鏡 衞生一般 服務尚可 房間設施也一般 尤其是usb充電口根本都是壞的無法充電 早餐廳在地下吃飯時聞到一股黴味 早餐品種和質量很難與這個品牌相配 真的不理解這麼高檔的品牌酒店怎麼能管理的這個樣子 實在令人失望至極 我在國內國外都住過這個品牌的酒店 而且感覺都不錯 怎麼長白山這個品牌住了之後下次再也不想住了 而且對這個品牌產生了懷疑 無奈退房後改住臨返的喜來登酒店 感覺很好也配這個價位和這個品牌 真的不理解喜來登酒店價位比凱越酒店低許多 而且各方面都比凱越好的多的多 希望凱越酒店的領導能認識自己的不足 提高經營管理能力 讓住客能感受到物有所值
