The garden is large, with few people, peonies in full bloom, rich plant varieties, and pristine natural scenery!

The room was spacious, but the style was more "middle-aged", which was acceptable. I had afternoon tea in the lobby at night. The taste was okay, but the service was very good. I could take the unfinished fruit plate back to the room. Finally, I drove to the No. 3 gate of the Garden Expo Park to see the pandas. They were very cute! ! ! If I have enough time, I will come back for vacation again.

msg:Overall, I was quite satisfied. The waiters were very nice and there were many breakfast varieties. The dinner included in our original package was a buffet. Because there were not many people, they changed it to a Chinese restaurant to save costs. However, the standard was lowered to only 200 yuan, and it was not easy to order dishes by ourselves. We could only eat the dishes prepared by the chef. In addition, when checking in at the front desk, I saw that other tourists who stayed in the room had upgraded their courtyard rooms to garden views. So our package didn't seem to be that cost-effective, right?

msg:The room is very clean, and the bathroom has no odor. When we checked in, the hotel upgraded the room type for our whole family, facing the lake view, with a wide view. There are chess and card rooms (158 for 3 hours) and KTV (minimum consumption 598 package) for the entertainment of the elderly. The back door of the hotel can directly lead to Gate 6 of the Garden Expo Park, and taking a walk and taking pictures makes people feel happy.
The breakfast has many varieties and good quality. The restaurant manager is hospitable and will take the initiative to provide services. The deduction point is the restaurant for dinner, because the restaurant received a full group meal, so we ordered a meal service and delivered the meal to the room. I waited for 1 and a half hours, and made two calls during this time. The first time I said I would urge it, but there was no follow-up or feedback. The second time I called, I was told that this was the front desk phone number and I couldn’t contact the restaurant... Was the first time perfunctory? Later, I provided the restaurant manager’s phone number to contact him, and some of the dishes delivered were already cold. The reason is that there are not enough people during the holidays, but shouldn’t this be predicted by the service industry?

When you go out alone, eating is always a default lonely option. Although the price varies from person to person, what kind of restaurants are there around such a remote place? I went back to the hotel to eat, and ended up opening the lobby alone. The waiter was at the door, avoiding embarrassment. The dishes tasted good, and I tried a special drink, which was also full of sincerity.
I was very satisfied with the service attitude of all positions in the hotel. It is much more reliable than those hotels with business smiles on their faces but do not act like people
The room is really big and the hygiene level is moderate, but it is quite clean beyond expectations in such a remote location. The moment I got up early and opened the curtains, my mood improved, and the scenery is quite good
In general, it is a good choice for vacation. If you go to the two nearby geological parks and the Garden Expo Park, this hotel can be given priority

However, when we went to have breakfast, the waiter at the door told us that there was a charge for one child!!! I have stayed in so many hotels of various levels, and this is the first time I have encountered such a request. Are you serious about a five-star hotel?
When checking out, the front desk asked if I was satisfied. I reported the breakfast charge issue truthfully on the spot. The front desk immediately apologized and sent the small biscuits in Figure 8. It can be said that the attitude is still very good

It is just a little far from the city, and it is convenient to go to Nanjing. But the buffet dinner is not satisfactory, the seafood is not fresh, there is a fishy smell, the dishes are average, and there is no special feature. In addition, the most disappointing thing is that the hotel arbitrarily deducts the deposit. As a frequent business traveler, I obviously did not take anything away, but after three days, the deposit was not received. After contacting, it said that the card was not returned. Moreover, after checking out that day, I had afternoon tea at the hotel and did not inform that something was lost. The hotel did not know which room the things were lost. It is really funny. There are problems with management, but consumers are required to bear the responsibility. I am speechless about the service.

總的來説，瑕不掩瑜，這邊的酒店還是不錯的。

msg:靠近園藝博覽園，附近沒什麼其他可玩的地方。酒店本身的餐飲可以説比較有誠意了，在住客不多的情況下自助餐也維持了水準線以上的水平。就是酒店附近着實荒涼，沒有外賣，如果不想在酒店吃飯，就得跑好遠了（當然這不是酒店的鍋）。
酒店比較新，定位明確，房間較大，風景OK，設施中等水準，沒有一味追求智能設備。（房間浴缸有奇怪的黑斑，阿姨説一直都有刷不下來，不知道其他房間如何）
服務上對住客的需求基本都響應及時，所以有些無傷大雅的小失誤也就可以容忍了。
整體還是不錯的

酒店的中餐廳的飲食還是不錯的，點的幾道菜都是色香味俱全，水準很高。服務人員素質很好。
第二天早上的早餐的水準也是出乎意料的好，早上有烏冬面水煮麪，麪包的種類也很豐富，寶寶喝的牛奶都是鮮牛奶加熱的，非常健康，整體來説還是不錯的一次入住。

地點太偏了，酒店附近沒什麼吃飯的地方，連外賣都沒有，吃飯開車將近10公里才有吃的
