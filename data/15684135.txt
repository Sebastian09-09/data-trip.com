The chess and card room is very large, free mahjong all night, and there are billiards, table tennis, gyms, etc. It is very suitable for vacation. The breakfast is also rich.

The breakfast is not satisfactory, a little hungry, it is recommended to eat early breakfast if you go, the noodles are still good. There is nothing to eat around, our family drove to the city to eat at night, and it took a few minutes to get to the square, KFC, Lao Xiangji snacks and hot pot. It is still recommended, it is full during the May Day holiday.

msg:The hotel is located in Qinxi Town, Jing County, 10 kilometers from the county seat. It is one of the few 4-diamond hotels in Jing County. The hotel covers a large area and parking is convenient. The room is large, clean and tidy, and the bedding is OK. The noodles and wontons cooked for breakfast are good. This morning, I had noodles and wontons, and asked for another bowl of wontons. The wonton cooker was not satisfied and said, "Don't waste it." This is the first time I have encountered such a situation. There were too few guests staying, so there were few varieties of breakfast buffets, which we can understand, but I was speechless when this happened. This employee should correct his service attitude. The attitudes of other service staff were very good.

msg:The environment is a little better, but there are no other advantages: the cups for rinsing mouths are all water-stained and definitely cannot be used, and the towels are a little old; the key is the service. The reception service in the lobby is still quite good, but you really shouldn't go to that restaurant. When ordering, I specifically asked the waiter if I would have to wait for a long time. The waiter said that there were not many tables and we didn't have to wait. As a result, I waited for 45 minutes+. It was already seven or eight o'clock, and there were not many people waiting for so long. During the waiting process, two tables in front of us quarreled because the waiter served the wrong dishes (everyone had been waiting for a long time, and they probably quarreled because they were impatient); another table said that the several hot dishes served were all cold, and the waiter's way of dealing with it was to take them all back to the kitchen to heat them up. As a result, the people at the table who brought the dishes back ate a few bites and reported that they were still cold. When it was our turn, the dishes were basically not hot, so we ate casually, but the dishes were really salty. We drank a lot of drinks and water. Oh~ The experience was extremely bad, and this is the first time I give such a low score.

I found out that there are five buildings on the website, but there is a slogan in the hotel yard that says "Creation Heart". The hotel we booked is a special room. The decoration inside is generally without windows. It is estimated that its main building should be better decorated. The breakfast is very ordinary. I can only say that I am full. The environment is very good and the hygiene is good. It is just very popular. In general, this hotel is good, with all kinds of facilities, especially table tennis, swimming pool, and white football. It is also very large. If I have the opportunity, I will come again. This is the best choice for the entrance of the Sichuan-Tibet Line in southern Anhui.

I checked in at the reception center and stayed in Building 6. It should be a renovated retirement apartment. The room is relatively large. After breakfast, I walked around the park. The greenery is OK, the air is also very good, and the environment is quite suitable for retirement. Many villas nearby are abandoned, overgrown with ****s, which is a pity. As a demonstration base for retirement in southern Anhui, it may be less publicized. If you have the opportunity to come to the Sichuan-Tibet line in southern Anhui again in the future, you can consider staying here. I didn't take photos, but attached a few beautiful views along the way

msg:本人個人企業主，國內國外住過很多酒店，每家服務和設施有好有壞，但都能理解，也從來沒有評論過酒店，因為沒這閑工夫。
第一次願意花時間評論，是因為體驗實在太差，不希望再有人有我這樣的糟糕體驗。
具體情況：我們一行9個人旅遊，在網上看是4星，看圖片也還可以，價格也還合理，就預訂了。
前台服務差：結果我們到酒店前台，這麼大一波人一直走到前台邊上也沒有人抬頭跟我們打招呼（前台有好幾個人），直到站在前台正面，等一分鐘，才有人抬頭，還是我先説的話。
前台態度惡劣：到房間一看，跟隔壁房間中間還有個小門，跟另一個房間直接相通，我們這邊是外門，目視直接可以從另一側打開，未採取任何封堵措施。好恐怖，跟前台協商換房間未果，態度惡劣，既不同意讓我們查看另一側是否可以打開，也不同意換房間。説這個酒店很多房間都是以前套房改的，都這樣。
酒店狡辯之詞：我們説房間怎麼能有跟另一個房間相通的門呢？睡覺沒有安全感，酒店卻説“你家房間沒有窗户嗎？門跟窗户不是一樣嗎？”這個狡辯之詞是原話，哪個**能説出這個話？至此，我們已經知道應該閉嘴。由於拖家帶口，小孩又發燒，選擇暫住一晚。
房間衞生差：房間看起來尚可，不過剛要拿起茶杯倒水喝，發現茶杯裏有一根長頭髮。
以上評論，切身體驗。
