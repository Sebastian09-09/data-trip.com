msg:It is really the ceiling of wild luxury in China. The service is really super good. They are all ethnic minority housekeepers, enthusiastic and very professional. Especially the details are very well done, giving us a high emotional value, which is enough to show that the boss has spent a lot of thought. I contacted the housekeeper from Sailimu Lake. You can use the housekeeper's positioning navigation to drive there. When you are about to reach the hotel, there is a dirt road. It feels very good to drive an off-road vehicle. After arriving at the camp, there is a local welcome ceremony, which is really a surprise! I deeply feel the enthusiasm of the housekeeper team. The two dogs raised by the camp are really spiritual and super docile. Although it is the off-season now, the floor-to-ceiling windows that can see the beautiful scenery when you open them are deeply loved by me. The beautiful scenery is just a window. I will come again next time! The food is definitely beyond expectations. The room is clean and comfortable.

There was a very unique welcome ceremony before check-in. We really felt at home! The scenery of the hotel is stunning and stunning. The sunrise and sunset are both stunning. Friends from the south can definitely experience the very different beauty of Xinjiang! The hotel service is unparalleled, surpassing most chain 5-star hotels. There is no professional fake smile, and it is extremely sincere and kind. One detail that is still very touching is that during afternoon tea, the staff will be waiting not far away, and they will help you pour tea after you have finished a cup. We are a little shy about society, so we said we can do it by ourselves. The boy is very shy. , stood further away but where the sun was directly shining and waited. I have never written a review before, but this is the first time I wrote one specifically because of the service and environment.

msg:I heard about this hotel 2 years ago. It is also on my list of hotels I want to stay in when traveling to Xinjiang. This time when I arrived at Sailimu Lake and started to book a hotel at noon, I saw the name of the hotel again. And it‚Äôs not far so I booked it right away. It was quite expensive in the peak season, almost 5,000, but since I came here and I had been paying attention to the hotel, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to book it.

We arrived close to the early morning of the next day. The hotel was still waiting for us and there was a brief welcome ceremony. The feeling is quite good. The room is actually very small, and there is no obstruction between the bathroom and the room. If you have half-grown children with you, it will still be awkward for adults to take a bath. The room equipment and facilities are simple and not close to the standard configuration of 5000. Maybe the focus is on environment and service? Anyway, we didn't experience anything, including the hotel's various services, afternoon tea, etc. By the way, are we different from other guests? Because we arrived late and missed a dinner, our children were still charged an extra 300 for meals. I was originally charged 800, but after arguing hard, the front desk reluctantly gave me special trea**ent. Later, I felt that there were some differences in trea**ent. There was no butler to connect, only the front desk. On the second day of the in-depth tour, we basically didn‚Äôt stay in the hotel, and no one in the hotel asked us what we had for lunch. The residents of the house next door ate hot pot, but no one asked us about it? The trea**ent is really different. Is it just because the three of us look alike and are easy to deal with and don't like to find trouble for others that we just deal with each other casually? What's even weirder is that after we left, the front desk sent us a message in a questioning tone, saying that there were stains on the pillowcases and they couldn't be washed off. We love traveling so much and have stayed in so many hotels before and after. There are high, high and low grades. I have really never encountered a hotel that sent a message to the guest after the guest left, saying that the pillowcase was stained and could not be washed off. Does the implication mean that the guest should pay compensation? It really refreshed my knowledge. Not to mention that consumables such as pillowcases should be within the normal cost and loss range of the hotel. Since opening a hotel, these problems are inevitable and encountered every day. If there are stains, blame them on the guests and ask them to compensate. I don‚Äôt know how luxurious the pillowcases of a hotel that charges 5,000 yuan a night are. I advise future guests to be extra careful not to dirty the pillowcases in this hotel. It is best to bring your own. Otherwise, money will really be deducted. In short, this kind of service awareness should be their consistent style from top to bottom. Later, they realized the problem and admitted their own problem but did not offer any compensation or condolences. The condescending and hasty explanation put a damper on my original plan to come back here in the winter. I believe that service is based on mutual respect, rather than superficial suspicion, suspicion, and contempt. Even if you don't say it out loud, everyone can feel it.

Finally, I would like to mention that the hotel's forest hiking guide is very good, respectful and patient. It is he who makes us want to come again in winter. Pity‚Ä¶..

msg:The hotel is located on a mountain at an altitude of 2,000 meters in Wenquan County. The environment is very beautiful. It is cool here in the hot summer. You can feel the changes of various scenery and weather in one day. There are rich and diverse natural landscapes and destinations for in-depth exploration around it, such as Sayram Lake, glaciers, river valleys, grasslands, and corresponding routes, horseback riding, camels, hiking, etc., a variety of combinations and customized tours, suitable for in-depth experience, the hotel service is very good, warm, friendly, and very attentive, carefully preparing ethnic reception, very pleasantly surprised. The hotel decoration design is unique and a bit retro, and it is integrated with the surrounding pine forest and mountain scenery. The large terrace and floor-to-ceiling windows are convenient for enjoying rainbows and sunsets, starry sky and sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds, gyms, mountain swimming pools (but the water is relatively cold, it is recommended for people with winter swimming experience), accommodation and catering are all-inclusive, and a variety of dining methods are also provided. In addition, there are some off-road adventure projects that you can choose to try. If you are also pursuing tranquility and independence, want to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and enjoy the grandeur and tranquility of nature, this is definitely an ideal choice. Here you can really immerse yourself in the mountains and nature, enjoy the wonderful experience of nature and mountains, and leave unforgettable and beautiful memories. I did some research before coming here. How should I put it? Everyone has their own standards for mountain hotel vacations. If you still want the glitz and glamour of luxury, then just choose the Shangri-La in your heart. Why bother coming to the mountains to find a different experience? It was a worthwhile trip. I was very surprised, very happy and satisfied.

However, I bought a bottle of Yilitequ Baijiu when I had dinner. The hotel quoted 680. At that time, I thought such an expensive hotel would not cheat people, so I didn't check the price and opened a bottle. The next day, I passed by the store and saw that Yilitequ Baijiu in the city was only 58 yuan. The difference was nearly 12 times. It was really a rip-off.

Although it has always been in the list, it is also the main destination of Xinjiang trip
But online reviews are mixed
I'm still a little apprehensive, I'm afraid the service can't keep up
It turns out to be overthinking
The whole service team is very professional
It's good to go in early November, although it's cold
But more snow
During the epidemic, there were fewer people and we upgraded the room type and the bed was very large
There is a fireplace especially
The most amazing thing is the food! ! !
It's really a blessing to be able to eat very delicious food in such a remote place
The chef is too good, the combination of Chinese and Western is not the same every day
And the perfect afternoon tea
Prepare to experience it again in summer, because there are more activities that you can participate in in summer
The stars at night are also very shocking
All in all, 10,000 recommendations!

But when you come to the hotel, you will find that it is far from worth the price. Although the room is acceptable, the attitude is acceptable, and you can see animals, the service concept is average, the environment is average, and the basic facilities (parking facilities) are easily paralyzed when there are many cars. The most important thing is that I also fell down in the hotel because there was suet dripping from the roasted lamb on the floor of the hotel restaurant. As for catering, it can only be described in general terms as it solves the basic problem of food and clothing. As for the official and Xiaohongshu a**ospheric pictures that everyone has seen, it‚Äôs better not to think about it.

Because there are stars in the hotel during the stay on the day, many hotel locations are restricted, which reduces the experience of staying in praise. The hotel scenery is not good or bad. It‚Äôs not bad to have such a meal in such a remote place. The meal includes three meals. The swimming pool is just a place to take pictures. Swimming is not allowed. The sanitation of the rooms is not carefully done. Generally speaking, it is good because the location of the hotel is relatively remote. The waiters in the restaurant are warm and polite. But it is enough to come to Xinjiang to experience it once. I have been away from the store for so long and have not received the electronic invoice. I informed the hotel of my unit and email address, but I haven't received it. I hope the hotel will send the electronic invoice to my mailbox as soon as possible after seeing my review. grateful!
