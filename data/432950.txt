msg:Overall a good stay. A pet friendly resort (surcharge 200/dog) with no hassle. Amenities are aplenty with a large outdoor pool and indoor pool for laps. They also have squash and table tennis available at extra charge. It‚Äôs a busy location on weekends for locals - families galore. 

Breakfast buffet was sufficient, nothing outstanding but big enough selection of mostly Chinese food. 

The resort is large and faces the lake. Unfortunately the lake itself is dirty but still a lakefront property away from city life. They try hard to provide lots of outdoor space with grass areas and nice paths. The spaces are kept reasonably clean although the resort can afford a bit of a facelift as some places are dated. 

Nice little hiking spot not too far from the resort. Great area for cyclists.

msg:Nice resort for families with lots of activities for the little ones. Highlight was the service and all staff were friendly especially Mona who also spoke English well and shared her wechat and checked with us everyday to ensure our stay was pleasant. Bon fire and fireworks for Chinese new year were an added bonus. Mona also helped us book a BBQ tent which was a nice experience by the lake. The play area is large and could use a facelift as some areas seem dated. Buffet breakfast was nice with the usual fare and a nice touch to give the kids a small gift when they clean their plates. Although it‚Äôs winter, the temperature was quite warm and the room AC could only be used as a heater which made the room too warm so we turned off the AC and left the windows open. Car parking was mostly full during the holidays but we managed to get a slot to charge the electric car. Overall a pleasant stay.

msg:Our family, including our two little boys aged 1 and 2, had a lovely break from Ningbo in the mountains at this hotels. The surrounding scenery is peaceful and beautiful and the outdoor pool is fantastic - very large, clean and good for kids. Our room was spacious (though it probably needed a deep clean a little more often - under the bed was a bit dusty!) Overall the hotel is a great place for a short break with young kids. Some areas could do with a facelift (i.e. the shop by reception is empty and has boxes sacked in it) but kids don‚Äôt mind this and what they do love is at the hotel - a pool, balance bike riding area, soft play center and an evening petting farm (which was very well done!)

msg:New Century Resort Jiulong Lake exceeded all my expectations and provided a truly enjoyable stay. The staff was incredibly friendly, going out of their way to be helpful and offering valuable tips on things to do in the area. ÂåÖÊô∫ÊÖß was especially kind and Ôøºhelpful! The room I stayed in had a beautiful view of the water, giving it a tropical vibe. The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of delicious options, and the resort was very family-friendly.

While it was a shame that the outdoor pool was only open in July and August, the indoor pool and hot tub were still great. The resort's proximity to the Scenic Area allowed for a day of exploration, with hiking trails leading to waterfalls and a lovely temple. The resort was surrounded by lush trees, creating a serene atmosphere that I highly recommend.

The option to rent bikes and participate in various activities added to the enjoyment of the stay. I particularly appreciated the pleasant bonfire evenings with music, which provided a nice touch without being too loud. Overall, I highly recommend New Century Resort Jiulong Lake as a place to relax and unwind. It's conveniently located just a 45-minute taxi ride from the Ningbo train station.

msg:Staff were great, helpful, friendly! They always wave and smile when people walk by, which is a lot of work for them but a nice touch for guests. 

The environment around is nice too. I went on a holiday and it was jam packed, but you still couldn‚Äôt tell because of the large plot the hotel is on. Only meal times or timed events, such as eating or bonfire, could you realize how many people were there.

Amenities were good too. I would like to see the outdoor pool open more months out of the year.
However, the hotel keeps guests entertained with their little play town, complete with go-karts, little petting zoo, bee keeper lesson (for kids), nightly bonfire with dancing (love the fire, not the dancing so much), 

Room was decent and comfortable. Nice shower, comfy bed, daily cleaning and restocking. 
Great hotel for kids. For the price, you pay more for the amenities, but the room is not bad. Restaurants are equipped with kids plates, utensils, and bibs. Great for the traveling toddler! 

Overall good experience. 10/10 will come back to enjoy their huge outdoor pool. Which says is open from July-August, but should be open longer honestly.

We loved the view from our huge room, it was so much more than we expected! Food was good, from the buffet dinner, to the buffet breakfast that came free with the room. Though it was a weekend, the number of people who stayed in the resort wasn't overwhelming, that we can just chill at the hotel lobby until late evening. We got all our questions and concerns attended to by the excellent Mona, who helped our little group of foreigners a great deal. She welcomed us to contact her again for our next stay in the resport, which we'd be sure to do next time.

The staff are so friendly and helpful. One of the staff at reception Mona is very helpful and always there to help. I really appreciate her hard work.

The only thing that made me sad was watching 3 cats in a very smelly and small space.. I asked the reception and they said they were hotel cats but their living space was awful.. also there were 2 bunnies that also were in a window space for people to watch them they didn't even have a home inside to go and sleep.. they also put a white peacock at the entrance.. she is also sitting on a very uncomfortable place..

I hope the hotel manager realize that animals also feel things and the living environment that hotel provides for them is only present animal abuse.. hope next time I can see happier animals in this hotel.

Next thing that rooms could be a little more cleaner.. specially bed sheets.

msg:Overall, we enjoyed our stay in a spacious family room. I was in town for a local half marathon so the location was convenient. My family loved using the indoor pool and we found the breakfast very enjoyable. Mona was helpful and attentive to our needs. We do have a few comments however. One is about the 'matresses' on the kids' bunkbeds; they were rather thin and uncomfortable. Another is about the buffet at the 'western' restaurant. We understand that we are not in a western country, but if you are going to call the restaurant that, especially when you have another restaurant in the same hotel that serves local cuisine, then you need to have more offerings than spaghetti with red sauce. The majority of the buffet was local style seafood, a local soup station, and a local duck station, which would all be fine as we actually ate at the local cuisine restaurant and were pleased, but not in a restaurant you are calling 'western'. These things would certainly not stop us from going back though. In fact, we look forward to our next visit when the outdoor pools are open and we can make use of the rentable BBQ area and other amenities in this beautiful setting by the lake.

The rooms, too, were superb for younger children - with cool bunk beds and animated designs.

msg:5 star service!! We were assigned an English speaking assistant (Mona). Mona was great and took care of all our needs so outstanding service!!!
Age of the hotel can clearly be seen when looking at the state of the facilities for sure a renovation of facilities is overdue!! Good number of outdoor pools with max, depth of 1.4m - would have preferred a little deeper but great for the kids. Outdoor pool area would be awesome with a deeper pool which would allow for better waterslides - current waterslides are only suitable for very young children.  
Location wise the resort is in a very scenic setting with great views of the lake from lake facing rooms (would recommend 4th or 5th floor rooms for the best views). We had a family room which was very clean and spacious with a free standing bath tub (nice touch), however, I will never understand the logic of having an open toilet from a hygiene and privacy viewpoint - would strongly recommend to enclose it like the shower!!
Disappointed with the lack of a real bar in the hotel - a bar lobby area exists but does not serve any alcohol. In-dining choices are limited with only 2 restaurants (albeit with  good variety of food) which close by 20.30. Breakfast choices (buffet) are very good for both Chinese and Western food although it does close at 10am - again for us too early!!
Overall we enjoyed our stay but for sure the facilities need to be upgraded as well as the offerings at the resort to be a true 5*

Overall they had a pleasant stay and they were impressed with one of the hotel staff called Ms. Ting Ting ( Â©∑Â©∑  ) who had been looking after my parents very well during their stay.

Well in terms of my booking experience, it could have been better.   I had to spend quite a lot of time ringing Trip.com customer service due to the confusion of the hotel reception staff.  In addition to that, the room type I booked was one double bed, which can be verified in my booking details, but for some reason, Trip.com changed to a 2 single bed room instead and as a result, my parents were given a 2 single beds room instead when checked in.

Since we visited during national holidays it was a busy time. The staff was attentive. Overall, a good stay, however it may be more suitable for families than couples (lots of activities designed for kids).

For adults - the activities on the lake were outstanding. Overall - so much to do and experience, that you could stay busy and engaged and still feel like there were more things to try. 

The only disappointing thing was the food. There was a western restaurant but there was no western food served there. Breakfast spread was often cold, and things like juices etc were not fresh but store bought. Few to none healthy/organic alternatives. 

Overall - we were happy with our stay and particularly happy with Mona‚Äôs friendly attitude and wonderful service. All of the staff were very nice.

msg:This is a large hotel with quite a lot of family orientated activities like canoeing, paint ball, sports, swimming etc. The rooms are spacious, clean with incredibly comfortable beds. The hotel accepts foreigners and small dogs, with a pet fee of ¬•200. 

I was incredibly impressed with the service. I‚Äôve stayed in high end hotels all over the world, and the service provided by Alisa (‰πê‰πê) was superb. Including providing me with a different room late at night due to boisterous neighbours. She went over and above of what I would expect from any employee at a hotel.

I do, however, feel disappointed by the fact that such a large hotel keep animals as entertainment in poor conditions. Geese kept without a pond, fowls kept in a cage with only concrete and 1 tree, hamsters for kids to play with without adult supervision. This hotel has a lot to offer and definitely doesn‚Äôt need to provide this.

The rooms are clean and equipped. The surroundings and outdoor area is beautiful. We enjoyed the ping pong and snooker table at night, biking around the reservoir, and had an afternoon tea and pastries in the lobby bar. I 

think due to it being the middle of the week and off-season there were some amenities such as the outdoor barbecue that were not available, and most things shut down pretty early, but still a lovely relaxing time had by all.

Amazing lake and mountain view, lots of great activities for the kids, friendly staff ( don't speak English but always helpful and friendly, ready to communicate through Baidu translator). There's a bee farm in the hotel which is very interesting for the kids. Guys are very passionate about their ecological farm . There's excursion about bee-keeping ,and they sell delicious home made honey which kids can collect by themselves. Lots of fun activities in the hotel. Boats, kayaking, swimming pool, mini zoo, indoor and outdoor playground and many others. Quite affordable price for the Western restaurant which is buffet with a huge variety of delicious food for 138 rmb dinner for person. Very good location to visit Monkey island and Jiulong scenery area. Thanks to all hotel staff who made our short holidays enjoyable!!!

Good internet. It‚Äôs very relaxing! The pool is big and nice but shallow ofc so you can stand in all parts but it‚Äôll come past your chest, you have to wear a swimming cap which is annoying but luckily the pool is empty on sunny days and families just out at night. We rented some scooters out front and went around in small villages near by, hikes in bamboo and went for morning jogs near the rice terraces. The breakfast buffet was quite good and had good coffee as well. The big Chinese restaurant is also good and pretty cheap. BYOB and it‚Äôs quite a nice stay for a short trip. Staff also friendly but don‚Äôt expect any English. About 35 mins drive from the railway station.

Great little getaway with excellent facilities for a weekend. The rooms are large and well equipped and plenty to do if you're on your own or with others. The bathtub overlooking the balcony was a pleasant suprise.

Only minus is there wasn't much choice for food since only one restaurant was open.

We came on very sunny days which was perfect because there is a lot of space to hang out by the pool. There are also lots of activities you can do here, you rarely need to leave unless you want to capture a stunning sunset by Jiulong lake. The view from the room is amazing. 
During holiday seasons here, it all of a sudden becomes less worth it. The prices are sky high, and it is incredibly busy. Screaming kids everywhere. 
The cleanliness is a different story - dirty curtains, dirty towels, un-mopped floors, it needed a clean. But they did do their best to sort it and gave a feee cake to say sorry. Overall, fantastic stay.

First of all, the service attitude of the staff is superb. I especially thank Liu Li at the front desk for his help like a friend for three days and two nights. Every time I ask, I will answer, and I will respond to every request. I am responsible and professional, and my attitude is first-class. I also gave a small gift when I checked out.
The hotel facilities may not be the newest and best, but the service is absolutely good. When you meet the waiter, he will greet you with a smile, and will guide you enthusiastically when you ask for directions or need help.
The parent-child aspect is also great. The hotel has supporting facilities such as the Sam Bear Children's Park and the rooftop farm. There are also go-karts and horseback riding at your own expense. You can walk your baby for two days without leaving the hotel.
There is also the Jiulong Lake Scenic Area nearby. If you bring your baby, it is recommended to go to Monkey Island, where there is a time-travel project. There is a dream park for children to play at the gate of the scenic area. The rainbow slide inside is 310 meters long, which is known as the longest in Ningbo.

The first time I came to Kaiyuan Resort, I was attracted by the beautiful scenery in front of me. But what is more meaningful is that I brought the elderly and children here to enjoy the precious parent-child time, which is entirely due to the thoughtful and meticulous service here.
From the moment I stepped into the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Peng enthusiastically introduced the hotel's environment and parent-child facilities to us, helped us efficiently make reservations for outdoor outings, farms, children's playgrounds and other projects, and cared about our hotel experience in order to provide us with a good experience. Miss Dong accompanied us very patiently to visit the outing project and taught us the skills of flying kites. When I successfully flew a kite for the first time, I felt a sense of accomplishment!

The buffet breakfast was very rich. There was a clown in the lobby giving away balloons. The hotel activities were suitable for children to play. The little fish butler was also very good. The service was very good. Overall, the stay was very comfortable. I have a chance to come again next time.

If there is anything unclear, you can ask the butler at any time, and they will arrange it in place. Our butler this time is Xiaomeng, who is very responsible and considerate!

There are many activities, such as bonfire parties, human-powered boats to tour the lake, hiking around the lake, children's playground, etc. It's great! The outdoor swimming pool was not open this time, and I must come again during the summer vacation!

The plastic slippers in the room are marked as disinfected, but there is such a big pile of hair on them, which is obviously not cleaned at all.

The breakfast milk is a bit sour and does not feel fresh.

msg:Because of the favorable price on Ctrip, I decided to use this hotel as a transit hotel for my parents. I arrived at the hotel late that day. Xiao An at the front desk saw that I was traveling with my parents and enthusiastically helped to upgrade the room. The room faced Jiulong Lake, and the scenery was still good, but the sound insulation in the room was too poor. Fortunately, it was the off-season, and there was basically no sound after 23:00 at night. But at around 6:45 in the morning, the staff actually turned on the big vacuum cleaner to vacuum the carpet. I woke up earlier than going to work when I came out for vacation. If I didn't open the door to stop it, it would probably not stop all morning. The staff's attitude was still good, but this flaw affected my good mood a bit. The breakfast was so-so, but for the price, I think it was pretty good. I also want to praise the hotel for free drinking water, which was very convenient! Very friendly!

For children, there are horses to ride, boats to row (two types: kayaks and pedal boats), outdoor and indoor naughty castles, swimming pools, and small animals to feed. It's so cool. For us adults, we are satisfied with the lake and mountains every day. We can also ride the electric car outside the lobby around the lake! The housekeeper Xiaoyu sent me the activities arranged in the resort when I checked in, and there was a small gift for the children when I checked out. Thank you so much! A very satisfying trip!

Spring is perfect for traveling here

It's my first time staying in this hotel
The price after the Qingming Festival is really good
Everything is actually in order
The elderly at home think it's great

But there is one thing I want to say
Because it's close to the lake, the humidity is heavy
The room has a slight musty smell
After checking in, I opened the window to ventilate, and it was better at night
Mold spots can be seen in the corners of the bathroom, including on the door handles, which makes people feel uncomfortable

Some international old hotels
After decades of operation, they are still very clean and spotless, which makes people feel comfortable
I hope that domestic brands can gradually reach this level, so that ordinary people have more choices

Because I was with my baby and the elderly, the front desk upgraded the lake view room with a large bathtub for the baby to bathe. The housekeeper Xiaomeng gave Sam the park ticket and coupons for various attractions. On the first day, the baby experienced the first horseback ride since birth. Kaiyuan's parent-child attribute is very strong. The cute pet park, outdoor slide, and bonfire party made the baby laugh. The housekeeper Xiaomeng also helped to make an appoin**ent for the chick hatching course early the next morning. After the class, I went to participate in the Qingming special Qingtuan making activity. Welcome fruit was given when checking in, and there were small gifts when checking out. The overall stay experience is super five-star. Because of the heavy traffic on the way, and the baby didn't have enough fun for a day and a half, I booked another night temporarily for the baby and the elderly to continue playing for a day. The Qingming check-in was full, but the staff still served very enthusiastically. The buffet breakfast is also very delicious. Although the hotel is old, it is well maintained and will not affect the mood of playing at all. It is worth a second brush! Will come again!

3. My biggest pain point for hotels is that I hope there are fewer elderly people. If there are too many elderly people, the public area will be relatively noisy, and breakfast will be relatively disorderly and chaotic
Advantages
1. Kaiyuan Hotel has design and brand appeals in the brand. Although the hotel is old, some details can still show that they want to move up the brand
2. Ctrip The package I bought plus the price difference for the Qingming Festival was more than 1,300 for 2 nights, but the cost-effectiveness of this 1,300 is that it includes 2 breakfasts for two adults and one child + several coupons for the children's playground + a bottle of red wine when checking out. This cost-effectiveness is really unmatched.
3. I booked a garden view room. Because I checked in at 8 pm, I never thought that this garden view room could see the lake. The room number is -380. Those who plan to check in can refer to this room number.
4. The waiters are well trained and will take the initiative to greet you when they see you.
5. There is a balcony. There is a coffee table, chairs and ashtray on the balcony, which is friendly to smokers. 6. There are fruits every day, which is very sincere, especially the second day, which is really a surprise
7. I called and asked if my baby drinks milk powder, can you send a few more bottles of water? I was touched by it.
8. The underground parking lot is really clean, which is a surprise
Disadvantages
1. There is no way, everyone has different core demands for staying in a hotel; Kaiyuan has a price range and is positioned as a parent-child vacation, so it has to face the fact that many elderly people will stay, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai; the public area is very noisy
2. The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is too commercial, with game consoles, pets, etc. shopping area, coffee shop..., a bit like a shopping mall with not very good business, all the rentable seats are rented to individual operators to share traffic, which destroys the overall impression of the hotel; but it is understandable, it makes money, not shabby
3. The room cleaning can be more detailed, so that more praise from detail-oriented people like me can be obtained
4. The public facilities outside the hotel can be cleaned more carefully
5. It would be better if the balcony was wider

Summary: This is a hotel with full cost-effectiveness. If you are not as "fussy" as me, it is suitable for bringing a family to stay

You can also see it while lying on the bed. It's so beautiful. The breakfast is rich and there are many varieties. There are many recreational projects in the resort. The rooftop ranch is very interesting. There are also various activities during the holidays. The popularity has been getting more and more popular in the past two years. The rooms are full these two days. You have to book in advance. The most praiseworthy thing here is the service. Every waiter who passes by will greet you. There is also a private butler. The service has been Yujie for the past two years. All questions and requests will be solved quickly and answered at any time. Gifts were also given when leaving the hotel. It's so thoughtful.

Environment: Located in Jiulong Lake, the environment is excellent. I wake up to the sound of insects every day, and when there is wind, there are wind chimes.

Service: The best thing here is the service. Every staff member will take the initiative to greet and ask if there is anything they can help with. It is very suitable for vacation.

The infrastructure is a bit old, because it has been open for a long time, it needs to be improved.

Other experiences must be full marks. Breakfast is in the Western restaurant on the third floor, which is very rich. Dinner is in the Chinese restaurant on the first floor. It is very convenient to order food. The waiter also recommended ** discounts to pay the bill. Thank you!

First of all, the environment that deserves praise is of course the first-class environment. The lake view is beautiful, the resort is full of birds and flowers, the "Sky Mirror", the swimming pool, etc. are all very good. Well, there are many places for children to play. They can just stroll around, lie down and enjoy themselves in the resort. Secondly, the room facilities are good, and you can take a bath in a large bathtub. Also, thumbs up for the considerate service. There were many guests on Sundays, especially breakfast, which was almost overcrowded. However, the hotel arranged it in an orderly manner and replenished the food in a very timely manner. Thank you to the housekeeper Yu Jie for always caring about our needs and solving any problems immediately. It's very close to Shanghai. It's very convenient to go there. I'll come back next time.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan this year. Compared with the last time, I feel that the service has been improved and I always feel at home.
Here are a few reasons why I like it:
1. Good environment. The hotel is right on the edge of Jiulong Lake. From the balcony, you can see the beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers. As the first ray of sunlight shines into the room in the morning, a relaxing and comfortable day begins.
2. Good service. Whether we are playing in the park, dining, or going out. The service staff responded immediately and provided help to every need we had. Basically, they were responsive to every request. There is also a one-to-one account manager Yu Jie who cares about our stay experience throughout the entire stay. Even the aunt who cleans the guest rooms will make thoughtful arrangements.
3. Rich breakfast. When traveling with parents and parents-in-law, the elderly people are particularly concerned about whether there are many varieties of breakfast and whether the food is delicious. This time I can satisfy all four old people, and I am also very satisfied.
4. Pet friendly. This is also the most important thing for me to choose a hotel. How can the whole family go on a trip without bringing their own baby? Having her makes them happy.
I heard that the pet-friendly dining area is being renovated, and I hope it can be used next time I come back.

There is also an attached indoor playground. Because it was a weekday and there were no people playing there, the air conditioning was not turned on, so the more adults sat there, the colder it became. It would be nice if the minimum water level of the indoor swimming pool is 1 meter, 1.2 is a bit difficult for children. The restaurant tastes very average, and there aren't many takeaways around.

Where, this is a design issue. The parent-child rooms are on the first floor, and there is a courtyard which is very comfortable.
The housekeeper gave us coupons for fun, but the two children preferred the free sandpit and peacock and had no time to experience other items.

The swimming pool in the hotel is quite large, with a water depth of about 1.4 meters. I took my children to play on the first night. The next morning, I attended a life class and learned about the chicken hatching process and the bee kingdom. I also went to the farm upstairs to see alpacas, sheep and other small animals, and had a great time grinding soy milk by hand. The hotel's parent-child service is very good. If you need anything, just contact our butler Xiaoyu on WeChat. Children's slippers are already there. Children's playpens and toothbrushes and toothpaste will be delivered immediately after contacting the waiter. After a good breakfast, there are also small toys for you. Check out. Afterwards, I also gave a souvenir. The main focus is a caring and heart-warming service üëç. If I have any suggestions, I think the Chinese restaurant on the first floor should improve the quality of its food. The water temperature and ambient temperature of the swimming pool are a bit cold in winter, especially for children. Overall, the experience was very good. If I have a chance to come back in the summer, the experience should be even better.

Winter is considered the off-season, with not many tourists and very quiet. The resort has an indoor swimming pool, children's playground, chess and card room, Chinese and Western restaurants, as well as go-karts, horseback riding, and farms. I couldn't experience them all due to time constraints. Looking forward to trying it next time.
Thank you Xiao Meng Meimei for your considerate and thoughtful service! I gave some experience coupons and small toy gifts to make the kids happy.

In addition, the entertainment activities are okay if the children are of appropriate age.
We also prepared souvenirs when leaving the store, which was quite nice.
Overall evaluation, the decoration is relatively old, but the stay is still quite comfortable. The manager and housekeeper are always on call. The activity arrangement is better written than actual and lacks systematic organization. The catering is not as expensive as above, but more than below. At least it is not expensive, and at least the variety is quite rich.

msg:üëçRecommended by Teacher Piao
[Ningbo Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan Resort]
üìçLocation: Get off the Jiulong Lake Expressway exit.
Walk another 9 kilometers and you‚Äôll be there in about 20 minutes
      In addition to Jiulong Lake Scenic Area, there is also Dapeng Mountain Resort
Baoguo Temple, the ancient county seat of Cicheng. There are many places to visit

üè†Hotel:
    The entire hotel faces north and south, and to the south is the "Langjiaping Reservoir". Facing the lake, called the back garden, there are maze-like garden courtyards, outdoor swimming pools, and lakeside campsites. In front of the lobby, there is a rooftop farm, a life workshop, and the children‚Äôs favorite SAM playground.
     The entire resort is very big and has a lot of fun.
It's easy to get lost when you first move in.
    The hotel is built on a small slope. The underground parking lot, Chinese restaurant, and recreation center are located on the 1st floor. The lobby is located on the 3rd floor. The accommodation area is available on floors 1-7. Centered on the Western Restaurant in the lobby, Building B is on the right when entering the lobby (facing east, you can see the sunrise) and Building A is on the left, with a relatively wide view of the lake. If you are friends, one lives in Building A and the other lives in Building B, congratulations, you will definitely take some exercise during your stay! Be sure to make an appoin**ent with the hotel in advance.
üß°Service:
   Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan Resort is definitely the hotel with the highest service level in the Kaiyuan series that I have ever stayed in. From the security guard at the door to the lady who cleans the guest rooms, the staff will take the initiative to say hello no matter where you go in the hotel. The emphasis is on greetings with a very friendly smile, not in a programmed way. It proves that the hotel's staff training is very good.
    From the beginning of check-in, the housekeeper will receive you one-on-one all the way through WeChat, and will promptly and effectively publish hotel-related activity information and remind you of small details! Thank you to our housekeeper, Sister Xiaoyu!
     The service level is also reflected in the flexible handling. There are more guests staying on weekends, so breakfast will be diverted on Saturday mornings, and the method of dining in Chinese and Western restaurants at the same time has been added. When breakfast is busy, staff will guide you to find a suitable table.
     A large family booked a Chinese dining room at "Jinyuan". The staff communicated the menu and other details two days in advance and were very patient and meticulous. The meals are also exquisite and delicious.
     At the same time, Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan Resort is also the best hotel in the Kaiyuan series that I have been to for families. In addition to recreational facilities, the hotel will arrange various activities such as "Life Class", "Cute Pet Feeding", "Handcraft Activities" and "Bonfire Party", all of which will be accompanied by staff throughout the entire process without any additional charges. When each hotel checks out, There is a carefully prepared check-out gift. Definitely a sincere service!
‚úÖÔ∏èTips
There is only 100% sincerity, and there is definitely no 100% hotel.
Problem 1: All facilities are slightly outdated.
      The bathtub cannot release hot water and the shower head bracket has fallen off.
Question 2: Maybe the place is too big and not all aspects can be taken care of. The commercial street here at the amusement park is very bleak, and many shops are not in operation. It‚Äôs time to get started in the Year of the Dragon!
Problem three: There are too many promotional packages and forms, and the coupon methods are complicated and confusing. When we used our Chinese meal coupons, we had to wait for nearly an hour for our food to be served. In this regard, the hotel will need to integrate it in the future.
Question 4: There are many parent-child activities, but they are relatively unprofessional and poorly planned, and there is room for improvement.
    It can be seen that the hotel pays attention to small things and puts most of the service work in the front office. This is also true.
‚òòÔ∏èFinal summary:
Teacher Piao brought a large family of 22 people here
[Ningbo Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan Resort] Three days and two nights
There are fun rides and amusement parks that children love,
There is a restaurant with good environment and good food, and friendly staff.
üêâWelcoming the Year of the Dragon¬∑Jiulong Lake trip was a complete success!
I also wish everyone good luck in the Year of the Dragon and the spirit of the Dragon and Horse!

Indoor amusement park: The hotel‚Äôs iconic indoor amusement park, __SAM Park, has a special area for young babies. The kids have a lot of fun playing in it.

There is a smell coming out of the toilet...
Small farm: It's a very small one on the roof of a two-story building. We arrived around 9:30, and the animals haven't been released yet. There are a few alpacas and üêë, and there seem to be a few chickens. Let's take a look at this. ‚Ä¶
In addition, friends who came with me played squash, table tennis, and table tennis, and the experience was pretty good ~

Watching birds, smashing ice, picking nuts, grinding beans, playing with dogs, various playgrounds... 2023 ends happily. Give a try to the local family hotel Jiulong Lake Kaiyuan. The rooms are large and quiet, you can walk your kids and dogs, there are many activities for children to play, the service attitude is good, and it is also convenient for mountain climbing and lake tours. It feels like it‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been to such a lively hotel for the holidays [laughing]

It also provided fruit, grinding soy milk, and feeding small animals. There was also a large indoor children's playground, handicraft workshop, go-kart, and breakfast. There are also CDs for children to check in and receive small gifts. Xinyi Butler is great!

Name and praise the housekeeper Xinyi. She helped arrange check-in as soon as she arrived at the hotel. Not only did she upgrade the room type, she was able to solve problems properly as soon as she contacted her, making the check-in experience perfect. There are many activities in the resort, which can be said to be a one-stop place for baby walking. Especially the bonfire party on the last day was very impressive. I would like to come back in the summer if I have the chance.

The little housekeeper Yu Jie was enthusiastic and thoughtful, and gave away children's playground tickets. The children had a lot of fun, went to the rooftop farm to feed the small animals, and watched the older children playing go-karts and horse riding. They basically stayed in the hotel for 2 days without going out.
The bonfire party and fireworks show on New Year's Eve are wonderful and well worth the trip. Come back when the weather gets warmer and visit the attractions outside the hotel!

msg:The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel does not belong to the mountains and lakes, but it is enough for a large resort. The hotel has a lot of parent-child programs. In the evening of the day we arrived, we first painted a skateboard, then played flying darts, participated in a bonfire party, set off fireworks, and then made pottery in the hotel. The next day, I rode a moped around the lake for an hour, played in the hotel's children's playground for another three hours, went out to ride a go-kart, and took a class on silkworms. There were also optional courses on chicks and bees. After that, we went to the vegetable field to identify vegetables and fed ostriches, goats, and deer. The hotel's sand pit is huge and it's fun to play in the sand. Due to time constraints, we haven‚Äôt had time to try rowing and horse riding.
       The hotel room is quite large, clean, and the bedding is comfortable. The shower has great pressure. The breakfast is rich. Although there are many diners, the waiters will lead the guests to empty tables so there will be no confusion.
        All in all, it‚Äôs worth coming back. It would be more appropriate to stay for 2 nights each time.

msg:Very satisfied with the staff training. The hotel service staff I came into contact with were all professional and kind. The beautiful housekeeper An Yue was very considerate and proactively provided various information. The service was great.
First of all, I would like to give a suggestion to the hotel. There are several canopies on the lawn where the bonfire party is held. The ropes are tied up and cannot be seen clearly at night. It is particularly unsafe. I heard parents reminding children and elderly people countless times to be careful of tripping. It is recommended to paint them with fluorescent paint or paint them with fluorescent paint. Hang some colorful lanterns to nip problems in the bud
Let me comment objectively on the hotel's facilities. It is indeed a bit old. Hygienic details need to be improved. Everything else is pretty good. The layout of the 85-square-meter family suite I booked this time is still very thoughtful. The bunk beds are quite spacious and the bottom bunk can sleep two elderly people. It should be fine. The room also has The small bookshelf is great and the children have read several books. There is a clothes drying pole on the balcony for drying swimsuits. The balcony on the fifth floor can see the lake view. Drinking tea and admiring the moon on the balcony and chatting on the Mid-Autumn Festival is a great memory. ‚ù§Ô∏è The toilet in the master bedroom does not have a door. Being complained about endlessly, maybe the designer did this out of convenience for parents to observe their children? There is a desk behind the bed in the master bedroom, which is suitable for parents who need to work. The hotel provides fruits for several days of stay. The first day coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival, and two extra moon cakes and drinks are given.
The hotel is equipped with many activities that children can play. The free indoor children's playground can play for most of the day. Non-slip socks are also provided on site. The indoor and outdoor swimming pools are very attentive. There are several outdoor swimming pools that are also open during the National Day. There are also some fee-based items such as go-karts and trains. Horseback riding, bicycle kayaking, barbecue and bonfire party, the hotel set off fireworks on the Mid-Autumn Festival night, although there were not many, the a**osphere was quite strong.
The service in the restaurant is particularly worth mentioning. There are small toys for children in the breakfast area. The breakfast is quite rich. The small sweet potatoes are amazing, sweet and delicious. However, there are a lot of people and you have to queue during the peak period. The local restaurant on the first floor of the hotel has several intern waiters who are cute and dedicated. The restaurant is very considerate in providing free custard buns and bean paste buns for children. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, they also gave away two small moon cakes. Dianping's set meal is very cost-effective. If there are drawbacks, it feels that the portion is too small. If you are not picky, you can eat whatever you want. When I came here, I saw that there were several farmhouse restaurants within three kilometers of the hotel. If you drive by yourself, eating out is also an option. We ate at the hotel for convenience. The next day, the housekeeper said there was a buffet, but we didn't try it.
Overall highly recommend this hotel

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, many small Mid-Autumn Festival lanterns are hung on the trees in the garden, adding to the festive a**osphere.

The hotel is a bit old, and the facilities are a bit outdated. The hardware is not enough and the software can make up for it. The overall attitude of the service staff is very good. Surprisingly, it is also equipped with a butler. The butler Xiao Qi is very good, patient and attentive.
The only regret is that in the Chinese restaurant, the serving speed is extremely slow and the taste is average. The hairtail near the seaside is actually frozen African hairtail, and the meat is very thick. Fortunately the service was pretty good.
It is a hotel that focuses on family members. There are not many people during non-holidays, so it is a good place to relax and unwind.

Kaiyuan is a brand resort that I am very familiar with. The company team building has always been Kaiyuan, so it can be said to be my favorite hotel brand in China. The room was upgraded to a lake view room on the seventh floor. When I checked in, my housekeeper Yu Jie led me to the room. The service attitude was great.
The whole service is very conscious, and the employees will smile and wave when they see you. When checking in, the manager will guide you to save queuing time. There is almost no queue, maybe you are checking in on a Sunday. Unfortunately, when I checked out, I waited for a full 15 minutes without any manager to guide me. This difference is a bit regretful compared with check-in.
The room is very old, but the service facilities are worth it, especially the price! ! Not cost-effective, but very worth it!

The child said she had a great time. . At that time, I booked a hotel because it must have a swimming pool. It is really good. The children just want to play in the water. Except that there is no beach, the configuration here is similar to that of several family hotels in Yalong Bay, but it is better in terms of cost performance!
Talking about the shortcomings, the facilities are a bit old, but the beds are comfortable and the water is large, so small details are ignored. The variety of breakfast is really lacking. Probably because there are less people on weekdays, it is basically carbohydrates. On the first day, the hot section has braised large intestine toppings, and on the second day, the hot section has fried eel with celery. Both dishes are delicious. , various other carbohydrates, etc. The overall quality of the dishes is very good, the dishes are fresh and the fruits are of good quality.
There is a local restaurant in the hotel, but we didn‚Äôt eat there. There are quite a few farmhouses nearby when we drive out. You can eat at any one and take out is also convenient.

On the first day, I arrived at 9:00 or 9:00 a.m., and I can check in directly after the room is cleaned. The housekeeper, Ms. Wisdom, helped with luggage, answered any questions along the way, and delivered them to the room. Wechat is online 24 hours a day, and she can reply in time at night, which is really considerate.
     The things that are better than ordinary parent-child hotels are: 1. The indoor and outdoor swimming pools are very large, with several sub-areas, and unlimited disposable bath towels are provided. 2. There are neatly arranged mineral water, juice, lemonade, and small biscuits on the tables in the lobby. , for guests to use 3. The butler will send the schedule of various activities arranged by the hotel to the guests' mobile phones every day. From day to night, the children have a good time.
      Things to improve: 1. I hope that the cleaning lady can carefully clean each room. I am really busy in summer, but I can‚Äôt be too sloppy. 2. There are many activities in the hotel that need to be charged, and the price is not cheap, such as: horse riding, table tennis Balls, go-karts, etc. 3. The cost performance of the hotel's restaurants needs to be improved, especially the buffet. There are not many varieties and the taste is average. 4. The staff in the children's playground are all chatting, and they don't care about the children playing and eating loudly. Pads are old and not clean

msg:This time, we stayed in the garden view room and the lake view room for one day respectively. The environment of the lake view room is the best on the 7th floor. Thank you for upgrading us!
Arrived at the entrance of the hotel at noon on the first day. After all, 7 people had a lot of luggage this time, and no service staff came forward to help carry the luggage. We took the big and small bags in by ourselves. After entering, we found that we needed to call the waiter to help with the luggage. , There were a lot of people in the lobby and it was very noisy that day, and because it was summer vacation, so there were more children and it was understandable to be noisy. After checking in, the butler served us intelligently. To be honest, I gave the hotel 5üåü. Most of the reasons are because Her service, why do you say that, first of all, there are many sofas on the left and right sides of the lobby, but they are really dirty and uncomfortable~ Secondly, we went to the swimming pool to see, many places are also a little bit The management and maintenance are neglected, and it doesn‚Äôt look very good~ The hotel is a bit old, it‚Äôs been a few years, and it‚Äôs a little bit different from what I wanted. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs guest room hygiene is not particularly good, and there are still a lot of dust in the corners. I hope it will be more expensive The hotel should strengthen the sanitation. The hotel has been running for a long time, and the sanitation needs to be strengthened
Another thing I want to say: I had breakfast at 8:50 yesterday morning. Since the family was full, we didn‚Äôt eat after checking out at noon. We walked around and left Ningbo to go home. It turned out at 12 From left to right, everyone in the family had diarrhea... very serious ones! 7 people, except for the children and grandpa who didn‚Äôt have diarrhea, everyone else was not spared. We ruled out a lot of breakfast items that they didn‚Äôt eat. Our people with diarrhea ate... It is probably the dim sum in the heat preservation area next to the rice noodles. (Shortbread with meat floss filling, and various kinds of cakes that cannot be named, we ate a few pieces while drinking coffee) I really can‚Äôt think of any other reasons... I dragged it all afternoon and many times at night ...
There are many elderly people accompanying us, and the housekeeper‚Äôs wisdom will also meet our daily needs. I am very grateful to her. She will reply to the information in time every time. Although this trip is not perfect, it is also in the laughter of everyone, as well as wisdom and love. The perfect picture in the service! After check-out, they gave us grapes. I hope the hotel can improve the infrastructure and hygiene issues! I hope that when I have the opportunity to go again, I can see the hotel look better after renovation!

msg:We came here for the outdoor swimming pool, playing in the water in summer, the housekeeper Xiao Miao received us, and responded in a timely manner. The hotel facilities and activities were well introduced when we checked in, but we promised to delay check-out for one hour, but the front desk could not do it in practice After swimming, I spent a long time talking on the phone in the corridor of the air-conditioned room and waited for someone to open the door. It was so cold. When I checked out, the lobby manager prepared toys and grape gift boxes for the children as a thank you.
The room was upgraded to a lake view room, which is far away from the main building. . . It was tiring to walk. . . Although the interior of the room is indeed old, and the sofa cushions are dirty, but I come here mainly to play outdoors. It is a veritable resort with a complete range of facilities, such as KTV, sports, horse riding, etc. Items such as table tennis and billiards are also cost-effective. Yes, KTV is too expensive. . . Small boxes start at 999 yuan. . .
There are two large outdoor swimming pools and one small one, but there is no amu*****t equipment in the swimming pool. It is recommended to improve it, after all, it has been open for so many years. . . A shallow pool can be used for a bubble event, but the current pool party is rather boring.
Children's paradise, farms, kayaking agencies, and go-karts are all 100 meters from the hotel's main entrance. It was inconvenient in the past, so it was a bit dilapidated and deserted. I didn't bother to participate in the small activities presented by Ctrip. There is mineral water in the lobby at any time, and mosquito repellent is available, which is very good.
I have experienced both the buffet and the Chinese restaurant. To sum up, if there are 2-3 people, go to the buffet. The Chinese restaurant ordered a few dishes and they were all so-so. . . The buffet is 148 people, the ingredients are acceptable, and the variety is quite complete. Children will be much happier eating than Chinese restaurants. The wood under the dining room carpet should have been extensively chipped and rotted. . . The feet are one high and the other low, which is too old. . . Under the boards, the cushions are all dirty.
All in all, the price of a basic house for summer vacation is more than 1,000, it should be updated and improved.

She knew that I wanted body lotion and sent it here at night, and reminded me to have breakfast early. I don‚Äôt mind giving it 100%!

Monkey Island did not go up and was closed, and the hotel boat did not succeed, also because of the typhoon. But it was quite fun to play in the hotel. ÔøºFirst of all, the service is very good. We have booked three rooms, each for two nights. There is a butler service. If you need anything, you can chat with him in time, and ask him to deliver the children's towels, bath towels, slippers, and toiletries. For meals, we usually arrive at the restaurant at 18:00, the peak starts around 8:30, and we start to line up around 9:00, and there are more types of breakfast. The swimming pool is more fun, and the outdoor swimming pool where children have been playing for two days will also be organized by a special person to organize activities together. ÔøºThere is nothing wrong with the room. We encountered a problem in the first room, and the other party responded in a timely manner, and then helped us change a room. When we arrived, the little peacock suffered a work-related injury and sprained his ankle and did not come out to welcome the guests. He fed the animals and went to sam paradise. ÔøºFinally, thanks to our housekeeper Yujie, five stars for you~

Before the trip, Ctrip housekeepers Aibao and Xiaoye were very thoughtful and upgraded our rooms to lake view rooms. The hotel is located on the bank of Kowloon Lake, with an excellent location and environment. Although the decoration and facilities of the hotel are a bit old, the service of the hotel is nothing to say. All the staff will greet the guests when they see them. Everything from check-in to check-out is well arranged, thank you very much! The hotel's breakfast is also relatively rich, and the dishes in the restaurant are also good.

msg:In the past two months, I lived in the top luxury hotels around Taihu Lake. This time I came to New Century Kowloon Lake. I didn‚Äôt have much expectations. After all, New Century Kowloon Lake Resort is one of the first batch of top resort hotels in China. In the eyes of hoteliers, there are inherent disadvantages, but they never thought that this trip would be full of surprises. To sum it up in one sentence, for me who came here for the first time, I didn't even feel like traveling, but going home.
1) The size of the hotel is not small, surrounded by mountains, it feels great to drive along the mountain road. The large-area water system layout inside the hotel makes it easy to imagine what kind of happy paradise it will be in midsummer. In addition to indoor and outdoor swimming pools, there are entertainment facilities such as billiards, table tennis, chess and cards, and a huge man-made sand digging field. I saw many children digging very happily.
2) The interior hardware of the building is quite satisfactory according to today‚Äôs standards, and it is slightly different from the luxury hotels newly built in the past two years that use floor-to-ceiling glass and smart technology on a large scale. From the point of view and standards, it is definitely the existence of God that "no one can match it".
3) The reason why the service rating is five stars is because Ctrip can only rate five stars at the highest level. Every employee is too warm, maybe because this place is like home for them. To be responsible, they have lived here until now. No one else has this level of service. Here, I would like to commend my housekeeper, Sun Yujie. It is not an exaggeration to describe her service as caring, caring, and exceeding expectations.
4) For the "hao" around Taihu Lake, the price range of the hotel's evening buffet is generally 300-400 per person, and Kaiyuan Jiulong Lake is 138. I thought there might be only simple pasta, but I didn't expect to have everything that should be there. "Chinese and Western Combination, sea and land simultaneously", which belongs to the ceiling of cost performance.
5) The bonfire party at night is very good. The tenants surround the city. You don‚Äôt know the name of the friend on the left, and where the friend on the right comes from, but it doesn‚Äôt prevent you from dancing to a song together. It feels great.

She showed us the room and said that we can change to a standard room. I originally liked the environment of the room and wanted to make do with it. Suddenly, I didn‚Äôt expect that the housekeeper would directly apply for an upgrade of the room type for us, and it became a suite. Now the room is much more spacious. In the evening, we had an appoin**ent with relatives whom we haven‚Äôt seen for a long time. The original room didn‚Äôt have space for meeting guests. All the problems were solved, and the relatives and relatives were very happy to talk about the evening as if they were at home.

Hygiene: Clean and tidy, every service staff in the hotel will smile and greet you when they see you, giving people a special sunshine and beauty.

Environment: Surrounded by mountains and rivers, you can see the lake when you open the door, and you can sit in a daze quietly on the balcony. The garden downstairs is even more fascinating, as if you are in a garden, and the bonfire party at night is even more fascinating.

Service: The service is absolutely top-notch. This is one of the few five-star smiling services I have seen in domestic hotels. In particular, Miao Miao's thoughtful greetings and help added color to this journey.

The view from the most expensive "Panorama Terrace Suite"
I like it very much, the scenery is really good
Say your opinion
1. The old-fashioned five-star a**osphere is there, but the hardware does have a sense of age. There are some lights, furniture, floors, and air conditioners in the room. There are some minor problems, including the balcony floor. However, it does not affect the stay in general;
2. In terms of meals, to be honest, although there are many varieties of breakfast, the quality needs to be improved. Take the simplest coffee as an example, it is served with non-dairy creamer instead of milk. For the breakfast of a five-star hotel, I think It needs to be optimized. In addition, because we brought a puppy, we called them to eat in the room for dinner. A service fee of 80 yuan was charged for more than 500 dishes. Wipe it, just take the bowl and leave. I don't think the service fee is worth it. As for the taste of the other dishes, to be honest, they are quite average. I think that as a chef of a five-star hotel, he should make a nod that can be eaten (here I want to talk about the birthday cake that the hotel gave to Mommy, so It is really estimated that it has been left for a long, long time, and the sponge embryo is so dry that it sticks to the tongue, and it is sweet)
3. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service part: the housekeeper Xiaoyi is very enthusiastic and responsible, and she is trying her best to help me with everything within her ability, thank you very much
‚ô•Ô∏èIn conclusion, my room type is worth the price, but the overall five-star hotel experience is not very good. If the cost increase is not large, it is recommended that the hotel can make some changes to make it a real five-star hotel guy
Also thanks for being pet friendly

During the stay, I saw a beautiful sunrise. I was very happy! When we checked in, the old man's room was too far away from the elevator, but the housekeeper Tiantian took care of it, and answered any questions promptly and enthusiastically! The service of the hotel is still very good. Every employee will greet politely and take the initiative to help the elderly on the steps! On the occasion of the Chinese New Year, the bonfire and fireworks show held by the hotel every night is really exciting, adults and children are very excited, and feel the strong flavor of the New Year! The overall feeling is very good. The only downside is that the facilities are a bit old. The epidemic has not been easy for three years. I hope it will get better and better!

Compared with Sanya's Southeast Asian-style scenery and delicious food, Ningbo Jiulong Lake is more comfortable for me. After a search, I decided to stay at the Jiulong Lake Scenic Area. After check-in, because the hotel focuses on parent-child, a children's playground play circle was presented as a gift. After learning that my baby is too big, it may not be suitable for a children's playground, and it became a circle of giving away table tennis/billiards. I like the proactive service and humanized handling. The hotel is super big, and there is also a dedicated butler service, who helped us push our luggage and lead us to find the room, while introducing various hotel facilities and information along the way. After adding the exclusive butler's WeChat, there will be various warm reminders about the dining information, so as not to miss it! I have only experienced this kind of proactive but not intrusive butler service at St. Regis! like! I saw that one of the outdoor swimming pools is on the edge of Jiulong Lake. If you come to take pictures in summer, it will definitely be very popular. I also saw many waterside projects by the lake. While I was amazed by the beautiful scenery, it also gave me a reason to stay again next time. Special thanks to Xiao Chen at the front desk and Tian Tian, the housekeeper. The service is really great! Gave me a great help! Very heartwarming! Thanks! I will also highly recommend the hotel to my friends!

Although many places are a bit shabby, the price-performance ratio is really impeccable. The front desk took the initiative to upgrade the Kaiyuan Lake View Suite. The breakfast is very rich and there is a snack area for children. The children's playground and cute pet area in the outdoor parent-child area can satisfy the basic fun of the baby. There are also activities such as children's cycling area and archery in the indoor swimming pool area. On the National Day, the high temperature just happened to experience the outdoor swimming pool. The children didn't want to leave, and it was a pity that the kayaking didn't catch up with time. Thank you very much for the attentive service of the housekeeper, the little beauty Luo Le. The room phone does not have the function of directly dialing the front desk.

msg:A very good experience, traveling with a baby, although the hotel is a little old, but the service is really thoughtful and helpful, not only the warm room housekeeper, but the attitude of the waiter regardless of the position is also very kind, which can make up for the lack of outdated facilities. In particular, I want to comment on the outdoor swimming pool and garden of the hotel. Although the weather is hot, the swimming pool is really a paradise for children. There are three pools in size. The deepest is 1.4 meters and the shallowest is 0.8 meters, which can meet different age groups. For the needs of children, go there at four or five in the afternoon. The water is just warm and there are shades to avoid direct sunlight. Of course, older children can also choose an indoor swimming pool. The garden is built along the lake, and many amusement facilities are not open because of the open air, but it is still good to visit and take pictures, and you should be able to get a lot of good pictures by checking in sooner or later. In order to let the children have a good time, the hotel also held a lot of garden-style activities, from 9:00 in the morning to 9:00 in the evening, the rooftop farm in the morning, and the starry sky KTV in the evening. It can really be said that the a**osphere is full. I booked a parent-child suite. The room size is relatively large, and there are also a lot of balconies. It is also very convenient to dry clothes. There are fixed clothes drying rods. There are two floors below the children's bed. The bed has independent space, independent bathing facilities, dressing table, leisure sofa, and a sliding door partition from the children's bed, but no matter whether the bathroom (the bathroom on the side of the big bed has no door, it is open) or the sliding door They are all bamboo curtains, the privacy is not enough, and the light transmission is not soundproof. Maybe it is specially designed for the parent-child room. Overall, it is quite popular with children. In addition, the parent-child room booked on the spot is also quite good. There are two floors below the cot, and the lower floor is the entertainment area, complete with books and toys. In terms of catering, the breakfast is quite rich. Although there are many people, the management is very good. The entrance has controlled the flow of people; the Chinese restaurant may need to improve the sensory experience of diners. In general, it is worth a visit to have a place that makes the baby happy when it is not far from the city.

You can enjoy the scenery while taking a bath, and the privacy is very good. There are also many parent-child activities, such as visiting beehives, tasting honey on the spot, grinding soy milk, feeding alpacas, catching ducks, and many plants are grown in the vegetable fields. There are also purebred pony imported from the United Kingdom in the hotel. It is said that a white horse is really a prince charming among horses. There are also electric trains and crawler cars, which are suitable for all ages. It is so interesting that not only children like it but also adults. The hotel service is very, very good. Each household is equipped with a housekeeper. The housekeeper who received us is Yujie, who is very considerate. There is a gift for leaving the store before leaving. Really worth the trip!

Walking in the hotel, the waiters along the road will greet you with a smile, the breakfast is very rich, the categories are super, and the management is very orderly. Dinner was in the hotel's Chinese restaurant for two days, and the dishes tasted very good. The next day, due to computer problems, the food on our table was delayed. The store even gave us a large plate of beef ribs and several hard dishes for free. When I checked out, I also received two boxes of local oranges, and the water of the hotel was also taken casually on the first floor, which was very a**ospheric. I would also like to commend Yu Jie, the housekeeper who was assigned to me by the hotel. Knowing that the bee class was too popular and already full, he helped us apply for extra classes, which benefited the children a lot. On the last day to check out, Yujie took the initiative to extend it to 2 o'clock for us. In short, Kaiyuan gives people a feeling of coming home. Although the decoration is not new, Kaiyuan's service and quality should be given 120 points. highly recommended!

msg:It's been a long time since I came to Ctrip to write a review. This time I was warmed by an intern girl. After checking in, the front desk assigned a butler to come over. The housekeeper is Chang Yuchen, an intern. As soon as she saw the three children, she was very warm and gentle. She helped with luggage along the way, introduced the content of the activities and the schedule, and also gave the children a lot of coupons to make it easier for them to travel.

Halfway through, the child was smashed by the boat while swimming and playing (he overturned himself) and needed ice cubes. The housekeeper was also very helpful and delivered it immediately. üéà

In the afternoon, the pool is still a bit crowded. In the morning, everyone is afraid of the sun, there are few people, and it is fun. There is a baker who sells sausages. You can pay in advance and make reservations to avoid waiting. I can say that this sausage is delicious.

The hotel's breakfast is relatively rich. When there are a lot of people, you need to queue up. It is recommended to go early.

Butler Yuchen will send messages from time to time to remind activities. During the small talk, some ideas were raised, but unexpectedly, she reported it seriously. What's even more amazing is that their supervisor, Guan Yue, came to meet me. She is also a gentle woman. When checking out, she gave the children a box of grapes, which was sweet to my heart.

It's not how precious the grapes are, but their attitude, active participation and positive feedback, will make people have great trust in their team and the hotel.

The room we stayed in is 172. It is recommended for those with children. There is a courtyard and it is directly next to the swimming pool. It is not noisy at night. It is a bit crowded outside in the afternoon, but it is really convenient and convenient. Take a bath towel and drink water... are convenient. ü§™

msg:Kaiyuan old brand, trustworthy. This is simply a small Sanya in Ningbo, the only difference is that one is by the sea and the other by the lake. Originally planned to stay for two nights, but the children didn't want to go home after playing, so they played for two more days. Affected by the epidemic, it is worth cherishing to have such a parent-child resort hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai without going far. The environment is very good, surrounded by mountains and rivers. The ultra-high temperature weather in summer is much cooler than that in the city, especially at night, it is cool and fun. The service is very attentive. As soon as you enter the door, there is mineral water available at any time. It is very convenient to pick up yourself. Some other hotels have to wait for a long time for more bottles of water. After checking in, there is a one-to-one butler service. If you have any questions, you can contact us at any time, and the response speed is very fast. You will also receive a special gift package when you check out. The hotel is very parent-child, suitable for bringing children. Children have a lot of fun. After playing for four days, they will not get tired. Sam's park goes to check in every day. It is a big children's park in a parent-child hotel. There are also balance cars, game rooms, farms, plant rubbings, and cool parties. There are many programs. Of course, the most summer is the hotel's several large swimming pools. Different depths have their own characteristics. Children's wading pools are also very safe. The movie is out. I stayed for three nights without leaving the hotel. I ate at the Chinese restaurant and buffet, especially the local restaurant. Popular with children. The breakfast is very rich, and the children's area is very intimate. There are still some that I haven't had time to play. When it's cooler next time, I can bring my baby to play kayaking and paddleboarding. The Jiulong Lake scenic spot looks good too. I posted a photo in the circle of friends, and many people asked where it was.

msg:Don't stay in this hotel... On the day of arrival, the whole lobby was filled with a suffocating smell of paint-like chemicals, and they said it was because of cleaning the carpet. Cleaning on weekends when occupancy is high? Is it okay to wash in the middle of the week? The room I was given at the beginning had a strong bad smell, and I couldn't bear it after a night, so I upgraded to a higher-level room and it was better. Maybe it's because the hotel is old. This hotel always gives people a feeling of not being clean. There are traces of food that hasn't been washed on the tableware. The sofas in the lobby are all patched. On the last night, I ate a buffet at the hotel. I started to vomit and have diarrhea at 4:30 in the morning. Both friends in the same group had gastroenteritis symptoms to varying degrees. I asked the hotel if there was any medicine and searched for a long time to find two pills, so I had to let the kid next door take it first. Finally, although it is pet-friendly, the carpet in the hallway is full of dog poop drag marks... It's hard to say... I don't recommend it, sisters!

msg:This time, I took my children out and stayed in a lake view room. The scenery was really good, and the natural oxygen bar. The hotel is a little old, but fortunately there is no smell. Every day you stay at the hotel there is welcome fruit.
üöó Transportation: We are driving by ourselves. In fact, the location is a bit remote, but the hotel has places where you can eat, so it is not a problem. Unless you want to go to the city center for dinner, just come back early. There is a small road without street lights at night. .
üßπHygiene: If you are not satisfied, you can contact the housekeeper in time to solve it!
üçÉ Environment: The environment is very good! It is built on the mountain. We live on the third floor but there are no mosquitoes. The air-conditioning cooling effect is also very good!

üîîService: A housekeeper was arranged when I checked in, and the housekeeper Lele received me here. Basically, any request can be answered in a timely manner! When I asked her for consultation more than ten o'clock in the evening, she also responded in a timely manner, which was very considerate!

In addition, I would like to make a small suggestion. It would be better if the logo at the entrance of the hotel's breakfast restaurant is more obvious. I didn't find the entrance on the first day, and I only found out after consulting the housekeeper. You can get a sign or an arrow...
The hotel's entertainment facilities are very complete, if you don't go out, you can play in the hotel all day! Two full days too! That is, the amu*****t facilities are really complete, and it is indeed a parent-child hotel.

Finally, I remind you not to participate in the micro-rafting outsourced by the hotel. The outsourcing service is really irresponsible at all. They don't care at all when you get on a kayak. No matter where you will drift, you don't encounter lifeguards and waiters. It's too irresponsible. In the end, I couldn't help but crawl to the shore by myself! I think it is extremely dangerous. If there is an accident, there is really no way for help! horrible! Danger!

She helped me and the front desk tell the front desk to change the room and lock the room, and I can move in after the room is cleaned. During the stay, we asked her if we had any questions, and she replied immediately, very considerate, and gave a check-out gift bag when we checked out, which contained some drinks and small towels.

The park is a large park with good greenery, with slides and labyrinths. It features an outdoor swimming pool and a small waterway in the park to drift all the way to Jiulong Lake. You can also play kayaking on the lake. The program is richer than when it came three or four years ago, but some of the original things are gradually becoming abandoned, so it can be regarded as a replacement of the old and the new.

Basically, they bring children to play, and they all come to swim and play in the water. The parent-child hotel is well-deserved.

Special thanks to Miss Lele, the service staff. We didn‚Äôt want to waste the leftovers we packed at noon. During dinner, we asked Lele if we could borrow the microwave from the restaurant. Unexpectedly, Lele asked the chef of the Chinese restaurant to help him heat it with a pot and use a new packing box. After packing it up and adding chopsticks, I was very moved. During the stay, Lele also shared the activities of the hotel from time to time, reminded you to check out in advance, and so on. The service level exceeds that of most five-star hotels, and will come again in the future!
I would like to make an opinion, I wanted to stay here again, but it was twice the price on weekends, which is a bit expensive!

The hotel exclusively enjoys a large lakeside scenery of Jiulong Lake, and the huge lakeside garden can meet the play needs of adults, children and pets. Not only can you swim in the summer, but you can also rent kayaks for a fixed period of time every day. You can go to the hotel in the afternoon of the first day, and then eat and play in the hotel, no need to go anywhere. It's just that the hotel has been in business for many years, the hard fittings in the rooms are a bit aging, the wallpaper is a bit cracked, and some parts of the bathroom will be mildew. In addition, the elevators are only concentrated on both sides of the lobby. If you live in a room a little farther away, you will have to go through a long corridor. If you want to renovate in the future, it is recommended to add two more elevators.

msg:I took my kids on vacation during the summer. Because of the epidemic, I gave up Chongqing and studied for a long time. At present, Zhejiang seems to be the safest! The first stop is the Jiulong Lake Scenic Area! Choose to stay in Kaiyuan Resort! The choice is right! The hotel is large in scale and has everything you need to eat, drink and play! The outdoor paddling pool is well-equipped for fitness exercises and the restaurant tastes very positive!
Here's a key point: the service attitude is superb! Butler service! Send fruits, drinks, and experience coupons for many projects! Although the price is not cheap, but after enjoying so many things, it is great value for money! It is highly recommended to bring children to play!
Butler Ruirui, the service is excellent!

msg:This is the first time I have come to Jiulong Lake New Century Resort Hotel after the epidemic. Before the epidemic, I had to come once a year. This time I discovered that there have been a lot of renovations, a lot of cute little animals, a lot of outdoor entertainment projects, and the scenery facing the lake is still beautiful.
The check-in procedure went smoothly, and the butler guided tour service. It was a coincidence that our butler Mi Lu just happened to have the same name as a lovely member of our own family, and immediately felt a lot more cordial.
The air-conditioning system in the room is very good, and the room is as clean and tidy as ever. The outdoor swimming pool was very fun, and tickets to SAM Bear Park were also given away. The children had a great time playing. In addition, just in time for the new opening of "Ou Lai Bee Garden", children can get close to bees and can do carpentry, but we don‚Äôt have enough time to play.
Fortunately, I took a walk to the kayaking area. By the way, I played for a while, and the entire lake can be paddled, which is great!
Only stayed for one night this time, it was a bit rushed, next time I will stay for at least two nights.

msg:For a hotel that has been in business for more than 10 years, the original idea should be good, whether it is a parent-child project or a supporting restaurant. Now, more than 10 years later, there is almost no air conditioning in the indoor park, and the restaurants on the road leading to the indoor park are all closed. Overall review of this hotel: 5 stars for price, 3 stars for facilities, 2 stars for service. In particular, I would like to comment on the 2 Chinese restaurants in the hotel. [Kowloon Tucai Restaurant] It is estimated that it is not the hotel's own, but outsourced. It is not possible to book in advance. If you go at 6:30 in the evening on a small holiday, you need to wait for a long time. [Jinyuan] It should be the hotel's own restaurant and must be booked in advance. At noon, there was a queue at the Kowloon Local Restaurant. I went to Jinyuan and saw that the private rooms were all empty. I found the waiter and was told that I could not eat without a reservation. (Having stayed in so many hotels, it is the first time that there are private rooms that are vacant but cannot dine without reservation). Only go to the cafeteria, the dishes and tastes are up to the level of a 3-star hotel. For dinner, I went to Jinyuan, which was booked a day in advance. The private room was dark, and the dishes were similar to those of the Kowloon Tu Cuisine Restaurant, which may have been cooked in a kitchen. When I ate that day, I understood why I couldn't dine without making a reservation one day in advance. Each private room is equipped with a waiter, and the waiter is a part-time worker. If you don't make a reservation one day in advance, the restaurant will not recruit these part-time workers, so you can't eat even if you don't make a reservation, even if the private room is empty, because there is no waiter.
In order to save costs, the hotel will only do this in a nasty cycle. Anyway, I won't be going to this hotel again.

In the afternoon, I started to have diarrhea. Both my mother and I didn't know which dish was bad for my stomach. Let's talk about the hygiene of the room, there is a smell when entering the room, there is a lot of dirt on the bathroom floor tiles, and a bunch of hair left by the previous guests, the sofa also has the hair of the previous guests, and the ground is covered with gray. After communicating with the customer service, I simply cleaned up. However, it can only be hehe. The kayaking and other playtimes in the resort are not clearly marked. I went there twice, both during non-business hours. Children are disappointed. The service of Yufan and Xiaoxiong at the rafting place is still very good and enthusiastic. Many items in the hotel have to be charged, and they are not cheap, such as table tennis, archery and so on. The buffet at night was also average.

After waiting for 1 hour, there was no reply. I called again to ask about the child's shirt that fell in the room. I was asked to wait for her WeChat.
During this period, my brother helped to ask the hotel butler on WeChat (because I didn't add the butler's WeChat), and the butler replied that there was nothing left in the room.
This is a hotel with such a chaotic management... The clothes are drying on the balcony, and the housekeeping depar**ent can see it if they can go to the room to check!
Checked in on July 9th. On the 10th, the waiter knocked on the door at ten o'clock in the morning to clean it. I told her through the door that it was inconvenient to sleep now, and I could clean it in the afternoon. When no one came to clean until nearly 17:00, contact the front desk and said that there is no room cleaning service now! ! ! May I ask what hotel is this? So we can only ask them to help coordinate whether the trash can be replaced with a trash bag and a bath towel. The waiter reluctantly came over and gave me a bath towel, and the trash can in the room was hurried away. full! No replacement!

msg:The facilities are outdated and repairs and maintenance are not timely. Seriously understaffed and service level is very low. The room service basically had to be urged several times before responding. The room cleaning didn't even clean the empty bottles and wine glasses that I drank the day before, so I made the bed and didn't do anything else. In the lobby bar, there are people paralyzed on the sofa sleeping, and some people play cards, which is really speechless. When I woke up, my arm developed dermatitis, and I seriously suspected that the bed was not clean. I really don't recommend moving in.
