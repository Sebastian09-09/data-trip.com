When I checked in, since there were three of us, the front desk staff Xiao Li recommended us to see the family room of the hotel, which was very suitable for my needs. Then he quickly helped to check in. Xiao Li was proficient in business and had a very warm service attitude, which made people feel at home. The decoration style of the room is fresh and generous, which will not make people feel depressed. I forgot to bring toiletries, and the front desk also provided them for free. There is a lobby bar on the first floor. It is a good choice to have a drink with a few friends and sit for a while. There is a gym on the 5th floor, which guests can use. A very satisfactory stay experience. I will choose to stay here next time if I have the opportunity. It is worth recommending.

The man at the front desk had a sullen face and a very bad service attitude, as if I owed him something. I was given two toothbrushes. I can't imagine this is a five-star hotel? Only small hotels on the street should give out toothbrushes. Sure enough, there were no combs or other toiletries in the room. The swimming pool downstairs looked dirty from the window, and it was not open according to the introduction. If it is opened in season, can it be disinfected and cleaned? The room is not soundproofed, and there are many cracks in the tiles. I am really speechless about my stay.

The room is not big, and the two beds are almost next to each other, but it is enough for one person to stay. The room facilities are OK, but the bathroom smelled very bad on the first day, and it took a long time to shower. There were moths on the bedside for the other two days, and three were killed in total. The Chinese restaurant on the 22nd floor of the hotel is delicious. I didn't order breakfast because there were only two breakfasts and no breakfast when I booked, and it was a waste for one person to stay with two breakfasts.

The hotel is impressive for two reasons:
1. The service level is very high. All the service staff encountered during the two days were very kind and smiling, and the reasonable demands of the guests were actively responded to and resolved. Especially when taking a taxi, the lobby attendants take the initiative to carry luggage and guide vehicles through every time, which is heartwarming.
2. The hotel's breakfast is very rich in variety, with a healthy and reasonable mix of meat and vegetables.
A little suggestion: The network signal in some rooms is not very stable. In addition, the equipment in the self-service laundry room is somewhat outdated. It is recommended to equip it with a heat pump dryer to improve laundry efficiency and save residents' time.

msg:This time I was traveling with friends. After debating for a long time, I finally chose this hotel. Generally speaking, the room is very clean, the environment is good, and the decoration is quite new. The only drawback is that maybe the weather is relatively cold and the air conditioner has no cold air, making the room a bit stuffy when sleeping at night. It is worth mentioning that the hotel staff are very helpful and enthusiastic, especially Xiao Shen at the front desk who is very patient in helping solve problems. The doorman Xiao Huang was also very proactive in helping with luggage. Overall it was a good experience...

Facilities: The light control is not very easy to use
Hygiene: clean
Environment: European style, I like it.
Service: We were all offered upgrades in the past, but now the business is not very good, so we have not been upgraded... A middle-aged aunt at the front desk kept emphasizing that there was a room difference, and a young lady next to her was very flexible and persuaded her to help with the upgrade. As a result, the middle-aged aunt at the front desk was not upgraded either. ... I can understand it, but my attitude is too tough... One star must be deducted from the five-star rating

Wu Jinlong who is on duty at night is very nice. I need to print documents urgently. He tries his best to help and solves the urgent need. He is a good employee👍

First of all, the location is 15 to 20 minutes' walk from the West Lake. There are bus stops dozens of meters away from the hotel to go to various attractions, which is quite convenient. The interior of the hotel must have been renovated and is quite clean. Because I brought my children, I was given a 2-meter-large bed, which was just right for a family of three. The room can overlook the West Lake. The floor arranged this time is relatively high and it is very quiet at night. The breakfast was richer than expected and very suitable for a family trip.

Service: Because the USB was out of power, the guest room was provided with a power plug, and we were able to help with late check-out and express delivery the next day.

msg:Hygiene, environment, and facilities are all 5 points. The room is clean and hygienic, and the layout has reached four-star standards. The location is good, parking is convenient, and taxis are convenient.
But the service is only 1 point: the person who checked in on the 21st was a middle-aged female receptionist about 50 years old. She didn't have a smile during the whole process, and her tone of voice was deliberately cold. At that time, a young man at the front desk asked her softly: What room type will be given to him? The woman said in a mean tone: I will get whatever room type I booked. Please, I didn’t ask you to upgrade your room for free! Who should I tell it to? I forgot to ask her her job number at that time.
Another strange thing is that because I have been traveling and on business trips, I have stayed in countless hotels, from Hanting Jinjiang Star to Sheraton Hilton, and I have never seen cotton slippers specifically marked as not to be taken away. Xiangyi is the first one. And they are disposable slippers of average quality. Intercontinental's cotton slippers are much thicker than these, and they don't say you can't bring them. Of course, I don’t mean to take it away, but it’s very strange to write it like this.

Xiao Jia, the foreman in the lobby on the first floor, always smiles. If I need help with anything, he will always appear in time and help solve the problem. Then there is the cleaning lady from Henan who is in charge of the sanitation on the tenth floor. She is very gentle and attentive to me and the children. She also cleans the house very carefully, which makes me feel valued and cared for. left a deep impression on me.
Finally, the location of Zhongwei Xiangyi Hotel is very good. It is close to the West Lake and there are many good restaurants nearby. It was when the weather was hot a few days ago that the mosquitoes here caused a lot of trouble to me. But next time I have the chance, I will stay at Zhongwei Xiangyi Hotel to experience the beauty of Hangzhou.

msg:It's not a particularly new hotel, but the decoration is all French. The worst experience in terms of facilities is that this hotel has no air conditioning! ! We checked in a week before the Qingming Festival and the temperature was 28-30 degrees. It was very hot at night. The central air conditioner was turned on for a long time and it did not cool down. We contacted the front desk and told us that all the rooms have no air conditioning. If it is really hot and only electric fans are available, please, this is what a 500-night hotel should have. configuration? Electric fan... This is just part of the room. There are many weird settings in the room. For example, signs "This is not free" can be seen everywhere. There are only two bottles of mineral water in the whole room. Although I don't think this is wrong, the same price hotel we stayed in Yangzhou prepared. There were 5 kinds of drinks and fruit plates as gifts before leaving, and Yangzhou specialties were given as gifts. In comparison, I felt that this restaurant was too fussy. It’s hard to imagine what I had experienced before. The front desk service was also not good. The two people seemed to ask questions and didn’t know. We were a little late because we were playing outside. When we checked in, someone actually called us to ask if we could still stay. When asked why, they also bluntly stated that housing is tight. If you can't live in it, we will have to live with others... Speechless, I will avoid this hotel for all my friends who go to Hangzhou in the future.

Seeing that we were bringing our children, she took the initiative to bring our children slippers, toothpaste and toothbrushes. Treat customers like family.
Perhaps because the hotel is good in all aspects, there is a lot of passenger traffic, so the hotel has a little less parking space. However, in Hangzhou, where land is at a premium, it is quite good to have a parking space.

It’s all tricks, it’s all deception. This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. It’s not the worst, only worse.
Service: I contacted you by phone at the beginning. Because of the bad experience during my last stay, I promised to upgrade next time. I also called and consulted. The merchant promised to upgrade, but after checking in and entering the room, this is the room that has not been upgraded. Call us. The front desk asked what type of room this room was, and a front desk service member answered the question. I confirmed twice that the room type that I was told was not upgraded.
The manager had no choice but to change the room, but when I changed the room and was about to boil water, there was still dirty water in the kettle that had not been cleaned. I called customer service to ask, and the manager on duty came over and said, otherwise I will give you two free breakfasts. , the chaos of the day...is over.
The next day I went to the restaurant for breakfast, and what was even more funny was that I reported my room number:
The waiter answered me: My room does not have breakfast...
Haha I turned around and left, completely disappointed with such a deceptive business.

When booking a room, Xiao Shen at the front desk did not fool the customers, did not avoid the problem of the small size of the hotel room, and upgraded the room type according to the number of people we were traveling. Answer questions all the way, very patient. On the day of check-in, she happened to be resting, so it was no problem to contact her, praise. When I finally checked in, the hotel room was really not big, but it was actually enough and not cramped. Sanitary conditions are also very satisfactory. In addition, the room service is also very good, smiling all the way, adding consumables very quickly. When leaving, Aunt Xiao Yuan's gift was very thoughtful, which added a touch of coolness to this hot summer day. The last thing I want to say is that the hotel's buffet breakfast is good, with both Chinese and Western styles, and the dishes are different in the two days, praise.

Hygiene: pretty good

Environment: Very good, standard for star hotels

Service: Three stars for the turndown waiter, and the front desk female lobby manager who upgraded the room type. She did a good job in handling emergencies and comforting guests. Deduct one star because the front desk gave me a room even though the room was not even cleaned when I checked in. Why did I go in? Smell the chicken feathers left by the previous guests? Serious error.
Also deducted one star. It's okay to call me to write a positive review, but can you not come over and ask me at 8:30 pm when the guests are resting? Can't communicate well in broad daylight? Another one is that I have upgraded your room type for you, as if it is giving me a huge benefit. It is obviously your own mistake that led to the upgrade to compensate. Should I give you a five-star review after upgrading the room type? In the end, before the guest had finished speaking, the person who came to ask for a good review of this hotel hung up the phone on me in an impatient tone. Speechless? Just offset all other advantages to me. It is recommended that the hotel train its after-sales service well

msg:This is the second day of my stay. On the first day, I arrived at the hotel at about 10 o'clock in the evening, and then the front desk upgraded me to a small suite, um... The difference from the deluxe double room is that the bathroom is bigger, called the big corner Bed room should be more apt. The general design of the hotel is not square, and there are basically irregular corners at the end. Because I checked in late at night on the first day, I was very tired and sleepy, so I renewed the room in the middle of the night or early in the morning, planning to pay the room fee and then go to bed and rest. But the front desk upgraded my room type for free on the first day. After I renewed the reservation the next day, I specially used the hotel phone to call the front desk. It was around 11:00 at this time. I asked the front desk that I booked a new room. You upgraded my room type yesterday. Do I want to change the room today? ⚠️ Here comes the important point, the front desk turned off the phone at this time (I can't hear the conversation over there) should it be discussing with the supervisor? , the final answer to me was to tell me that I don't need to change the room, and continue to live in the room on the first day, and let me go downstairs to renew the room card when I go out. At that time, I was still thinking silently in my heart that it was indeed a designated hotel for the Asian Games, and it was not bad. A very sad and disgusting thing came. At 13:30, a man at the front desk called me and asked me if I wanted to extend the room? If I don't renew the room, there is still half an hour for me to check out. I told this man that I had already renewed my room, and I called after 11 o'clock to confirm that there was no need to change rooms. Then the guy said he was going to ask (I just wanted to say what are you asking? Don’t you know that the guest has renewed the room? Is it because of the infighting between the shifts and the intention to deal with each other’s customers?) The phone hung up . After more than ten minutes, I called again and said that my room was booked by someone, and I was asked to change the room, and I was asked to change the room before 14:00, saying that I booked a standard room (said in a very mocking tone " I ordered a standard room", take a good look at what order I placed, I ordered a deluxe twin room, not your superior twin) and told me that if I don't change the room, I will pay the difference. I confirmed with your front desk after 11 o'clock that I don't need to change rooms. Isn't it intentional to make things difficult for me to change rooms at 14:00? And I have already continued at seven or eight o'clock in the morning. I said that I don’t want to talk to your hotel. I asked the housekeeper of Ctrip to communicate with you. I don't know if the front desk is still a male manager, so the face is slapped fast, right? After Ctrip approached you, they told me that I didn't need to change the room. It was all kinds of troubles, and after feeling disgusted, I said that I didn't need to change the room.
On the third day, I renewed the room again and booked a deluxe double room. This time, I told the front desk early in the morning and asked the concierge staff to bring luggage carts to help me move my luggage and change rooms. The room was changed, but it was not a luxurious big bed at all, but a high-end big bed. This was because of the unpleasantness the next day. The hotel staff was perfunctory with Ctrip and me at the same time, and told Ctrip that the manager came to apologize to me. The next day The manager did not apologize. On the third day, a woman came to help me with my luggage. Because I had to go out after changing the room, I didn’t look carefully at the room on the third day. When I came back, the room on the third day was exactly the same as the superior double room. The bathroom and bedroom of the deluxe double room are made of transparent glass and covered by electric curtains I stayed, but the bathtub in the deluxe double room given to me on the third day was small, and I could only sit, not lie down (although I don’t use a bathtub) but is this how you fool customers? At the beginning, I said something about the room type. In the end, the last manager was changed on the night shift, and he took me to see other deluxe double rooms. None of the deluxe double rooms have squatting bathtubs, and the bathroom and bedroom are made of transparent glass. can see. This made it clear that the manager from the front desk the next day was messing with me on purpose. I just don't understand, what's the point of you doing this? Could it be that the staff of different shifts in the hotel are fighting each other? Fight to the client? Otherwise, why did I have a good attitude in all aspects on the first day of check-in, but on the second day you changed shifts and made a lot of troubles. You agreed with me in advance that you don't need to change rooms, but then you backtracked and forced me to change rooms. On the third night, the service attitude changed to a foreman manager and improved again. I just know that the various service attitudes of domestic hotels are terrible. I book day by day, the service of five-star hotel guest houses.
After returning to the hotel on the third night, I found that the deluxe twin room that the manager of the day shift had downgraded to a superior twin room. I called the manager of the night shift [Wang Yiwen] and she showed me the room on the same floor. Many of them are empty, and all the deluxe double beds and deluxe twin beds I saw are not squatting bathtubs. During the inspection process, I also reported the check-in in the past few days to the manager [Wang Yiwen], and she will tell me later. The deluxe big bed room for the next two days was upgraded to a large suite. If it wasn't for this manager who saved the scene in the end, I would definitely go to the Tourism Association to complain.

msg:Overall comment: If you have to live in the West Lake District, you can still stay in this hotel. After all, there are not many good choices around, but it also has its problems.

Hygiene and Facilities: The hygiene situation was okay after inspection, but the odor in the bathroom was very serious. Later, we had to close the bathroom and put orange peels in for personal deodorization to solve the problem. This problem can be big or small. Those who live temporarily can tolerate it. In addition, the conversation on the phone is often inaudible.

Environment: Not bad, about 1 kilometer away from the West Lake Scenic Area, and there are no outstanding five-star hotels around.

Service: The service provided by Xiao Wu in the guest center is pretty good. What about other services? 1. I got the guest’s name wrong, so the room I ended up staying in may not be a deluxe room, but a select room. Why can’t I figure it out? Because the picture does not explain the difference between select and deluxe rooms. If the difference is only in the size of the bathtub, then MS is staying in a select room. 2. I’m very confused. The double room is equipped with one breakfast. Doesn’t it mean that it doesn’t have double breakfast? Or are there other factors?

msg:The air conditioner is very weak. Turning it on at 16°C is the same as not turning it on. The wind from the air conditioner at night is not as cool as outside, which makes it very hot to sleep at night, and it is also very hot to sleep the next morning, which is very uncomfortable. The hair dryer is not good, and the plug is not secure. After plugging it in and blowing for a while, the plug will easily fall out of the socket, and the hot air has a burning smell. When I checked in, the front desk said that there was a hanging iron in the room. I was so happy that I searched for a long time but couldn't find it. The call center said that there was no hanging iron, only the electric iron would be delivered immediately. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, the most general standard among the five-star domestic and foreign. I mean, the variety is complete and the taste is decent, but there is no special feature. Standing on a high-rise building and looking at the outdoor swimming pool is deserted and dusty. The quality of the waiters is not bad. Generally speaking, it is barely a five-star standard. Anyway, the price is there, it is not a loss, and the price is high.

msg:It's too bad, because I got an early flight and arrived in Hangzhou in the morning. When I booked a few days in advance, I specially chose a room that can be checked in at 10 o'clock. The normal order is after 2 o'clock in the afternoon. My order is that I can check in at 10 o'clock. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that I couldn’t check in, and that I could only check in after 2 o’clock. I took out the order and showed them that I could stay at 10 o’clock, and then told me that the room was not cleaned well. There were so many rooms checked out in the morning, and I was close to 11 The hotel I ordered didn’t finish cleaning any of them. There were so many check-outs in the morning, and they couldn’t clean it in 3 hours. I asked the front desk how long it would take to clean it up. At first they said it was up to an hour, and then it changed to an hour. I can't finish it, it's really bad, since I can't do it, don't confirm the order, I hope I can pay attention to it in the future, maybe I'm too serious

msg:Very average, staying for two nights, 1. The hotel gate carried children and strollers up the steps several times, and none of the waiters would help. 2. For breakfast, I picked up the tong for fried noodles and picked up the noodle rolls. The aunt inside said, "Why did you use that tong? The noodles fell on the tin foil." Excuse me, are you a waiter? You can clean the noodles on the clip, and you can also clean the noodles on the tin foil. Which clip on the outside can clip you can post instructions. 3. The hotel windows can't be opened and it's stuffy. How can this kind of service serve the Asian Games well.

When I ask the official, I will be told that there is no room, and when I ask for a discount, I will be told that I have no authority. A rubbish hotel, on a prime road, next to a big hospital, making so much money, but not even maintaining the most basic facilities. If there is a problem with the guest room, they even say they have no authority to give discounts. Does the person in charge of the service depar**ent get a white salary?

The layout of the second room is not bad, very clean. The first time I saw slippers to take away, I was charged. So this is recycled? If it is, it is quite environmentally friendly, but it would be better if it can be written in advance. I can bring my own slippers. I don't like to wear slippers worn by others even if they have been sterilized. . .
Smoking is not allowed in the third room but smoking is allowed in the corridor? The residents next to me can't wait to go out in fifteen minutes at night, the sound of the door closing and opening. . . The next morning, when I saw so many cigarette butts at the elevator entrance, I knew why they came in and out so frequently.

msg:The location is superior, the parking is convenient, it is very convenient to eat, live, play and shop nearby, the sanitation is not bad, there is a smell of smoke just after entering, but it is specially noted to be quiet, and it was woken up by the sound of traffic on the road at 5 o'clock in the morning. The windows didn't close very well. Others are generally okay, but the waiter didn't take the initiative to mention the coupon. What is not very satisfactory is the breakfast. Probably due to the epidemic, apart from porridge and noodles, small wontons and juice, there are no hot dishes and other dishes for breakfast. For the 98RMB breakfast, it shouldn't be for whatever reason though. There is a difference of about 60 yuan between the one breakfast and no breakfast booked by Ctrip. This is a bad review

Hygiene: The room is clean and hygienic, and it is very comfortable to live in.
Environment: Convenient transportation, next to Zhejiang Second Hospital, and more than ten minutes walk from West Lake.
Service: warm and thoughtful, I came from out of town on business. When I booked the room and went to the hotel, the health code turned into a yellow code. At that time, I was very scared. When I went to the hotel to scan the code, the hotel staff saw that I had a yellow code and took the initiative to help me solve it. Contact the local community to help me change the code. Fortunately, they help, otherwise I don't know how to deal with it myself. When I checked in, there was a lady at the front desk who patiently taught me to fill in the letter of commi**ent, and then moved in smoothly. I don't remember the name of that young lady, but I only remember her surname Li. She is still from the same place as me. My sister from Chongqing is very nice. The decoration of the hotel room is more European style, with a separate bathroom for dry and wet, which is very comfortable to live in. Everything about Hangzhou makes me very beautiful. If there is a chance, I will come here to play again, and I will definitely stay at this hotel again. Very satisfied 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 I will be leaving Hangzhou today. I am very happy on this business trip. The people I met are also very nice👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Next to it is the Second Zhejiang Hospital. I went to the hospital, so I feel very convenient. The hotel's epidemic prevention work is very good. Yes, when you enter the lobby, you will check the health code and itinerary. This is very supportive. It should be like this during the epidemic. The hotel's rooms are also very good, European-style decoration style, looks very refreshing, the room is clean and tidy, the room has no peculiar smell, by the way, the hotel's service staff are very warm and polite, and actively greeted, especially a foreman in the housekeeping depar**ent called Xiaoye Yes, when I saw me pulling my luggage out of the elevator, I hurried up to help me, took me to the room, and introduced me how to use the facilities and equipment in the room, which was very attentive. The hotel's facilities and equipment are also very smart. You can do it directly without the main desk. You can just go to the machine. You need to brush your face when entering the elevator. I feel that the safety factor is very high. You can also park for free at the hotel.

msg:During the epidemic period, I stayed for three consecutive days. The first day was a single order. When I checked in, I hoped to be able to transfer to a higher floor, but the front desk told me if I could not and why, I gave a room on the 7th floor, and the room decoration facilities were very new. The second and third days are to book a two-night package, and the order indicates the 19th to 21st floors. The next day when I moved up, I found that the whole floor was old clothes. It turned out that the lower floor was refurbished. I just wonder why when we were promoted to the upper floor on the first day, the front desk did not explain that the rooms on the upper floors are old clothes, and the new clothes on the lower floors are better. The picture is from the seventh floor.

This hotel is in a good location, convenient for shopping and eating. The most important thing is that there is a free nucleic acid test next to the hotel. The hotel has strict access inspection and good attitude. Let the guests feel that it is very safe to stay in this hotel, especially Manager Wang can communicate with the needs of the guests in a timely manner. Next time you come to Hangzhou, continue to choose Xiangyi. It would be better if you can call the guest in advance to confirm the needs.

The receptionist at the front desk helped me to upgrade to the 18th floor for free in order to prevent me from waiting. The housekeepers Zheng Jing and Chen Ruyi were also very attentive. The weather was hot and they brought two bottles of the hotel's special sour plum soup, which was very thirst-quenching. Excellent!

I ordered 3 takeaways at night, and they called me and said that the hotel robot would help me deliver it to my room, but it didn't come, so I had to go downstairs to get it myself. In fact, at this time, their waiter already knew that my room was registered. No one was there, so I didn't deliver it. On the next morning, the breakfast delivery man called me and said that the hotel staff said that the room was dirty and no one was there. Did I write the wrong room number? I went to check the room number again. Yes, I went downstairs to check with them. When the computer checked the room, it said the room was wrong. It first said it was a dirty room, then it said it was a maintenance room, and then it said it was clean, but it was the wrong room. Well, anyway, change someone to say another way. I want to say that the shell of the room card is handwritten, you should check it with the computer, this kind of mistake will be made, and I ordered takeaway on the first night, since you think this room is empty, there are still 3 takeaways , won't you check it out? When the next morning you take out food or say that this room is empty, won't you check it out for so long? Super disappointed, will never come to this hotel again!

Room, originally my diamond members go to five-star hotels to check out at 2 o'clock, here from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, I kept calling and asked my aunt to knock on the door. I didn't have time to dry my hair after washing my hair. 2 I will be charged half-day room fee when I go downstairs ten minutes after midnight. The double bed room is made up of two single beds. The gym facilities are old and smelly. Class standard, consider it a three-star, and the four-star room opposite is also newer than this.

Call the front desk, reflect the situation, and let the account manager come over to deal with it. After waiting for a few minutes, an aunt who cleaned up the room came over to clean up? ! Called the front desk again, asked the account manager, waited for a few minutes, and came to take care of the hygiene! The third time I called the front desk, I asked the account manager to come over. After waiting for a few minutes, someone who didn't know if it was the account manager came and said to change the room. I'm so angry, what are you angry about? It is such an attitude and way of dealing with such negligence in the gas hotel! When I was mad, I saw a smoked cigarette butt in the trash can! After the rage, the hotel staff apologized. Finally, I changed the room of the same type and sent 2 breakfast rolls.
I will not live in this hotel in the future, the real evaluation is for your reference.

The deluxe twin room is upgraded for free. The room is not big, but the overall decoration style is soft and bright, and the hotel corridor It is more luxurious than the room, the floor is thick and soft, and the fragrance is also very comfortable. The bedding mattress makes the mothers who do not sleep well fall asleep quickly. The breakfast is rich enough to make me a little surprised, because the price is slightly cheaper than that. But the breakfast is completely as rich as a resort hotel. Don't choose from the left and right. The cost performance is very high and the transportation is convenient. Just order directly. By the way, it is very good not to provide disposable toiletries! Compliment the hotel’s environmental protection attitude, and put the cost into practice (hygiene, catering) better than anything else

I thought I would check out early the next day, and I reacted with the front desk, but the attitude and dialogue It's outrageous to say I can't turn hot water when I'm down in the country and haven't used a shower! The two water outlet methods and the heat have turned to the maximum, and I still insist that I will not adjust it. I said I could ask the waiter to adjust, but the result was the same, the front desk said that I could change the room. Do I have to take two showers in the winter and night, and the attitude is poor and the language is provocative. This is the case in a five-star hotel that costs more than 500 a night. ! This service attitude is totally unworthy, will never come to this hotel again! !

前台就感覺般一般，因為定的房間衹有一個早餐，需要另加一份早餐，前台的一位女士説加了就不能退的哈！這感覺真不好，已經告訴你需要加一份早餐，肯定是需要的，就算加了，早上不吃，就不能退了，你早餐是自助式的，咋就不能退了呀？
入住期間2間房給的電梯口，比較炒，2天悶熱！房間比較小，好在乾淨，整潔！

msg:總體感覺一般吧，服務還是可以的，但是房間衞生堪憂，不知道是不是入住率不高，第一次來這邊住店，安排的房間四個枕頭竟然衹有一個枕頭套是乾淨的，其餘三個都有很明顯的臟印，屋內還有飛蟲和蜘蛛，這是很久沒人住就不打掃了？還是都不怎麼打掃衞生？性價比真的很一般，居然還是G20峯會官方合作酒店，並且這次又是亞運會的合作酒店，真的是一言難盡…希望能有改進，別在亞運會期間被客訴…
