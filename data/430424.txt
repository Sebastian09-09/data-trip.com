msg:I went to Disneyland. I stayed at Greenland Plaza Hotel before. Considering the subway, I chose Greenland Holiday Hotel, which is closer to Showa Road.
It takes about ten minutes to take a taxi, and then take Line 11 to Disneyland Exit 1. It is quite convenient. If you don't want to take a taxi, you should choose a subway station within walking distance.
The room is standard, clean and hygienic. Remember to choose a room with a shower. According to the reviews, some rooms require standing in the bathtub to take a shower.
The room was cleaned in time after I went out the next day.
I had breakfast for two days, and the variety was basically the same, but it met the needs. Fruit, soy milk, milk, coffee and fried eggs were all good.
I visited the swimming pool and gym. The water temperature was 33 degrees, which was completely suitable for children to swim, and almost no one went swimming.

The room was not ready when we arrived at 11am, so we left our luggage and went out to play.
The parent-child room is a standard room with an extra bed, which can solve the practical problem of traveling with multiple children.
The hotel is a certain distance from the subway station, about 1.5 kilometers from Kangqiao Station and 2 kilometers from Xiuyan Station.
The most convenient thing is that the hotel has a special car (minimizer and bus) to pick up and drop off Disneyland. It drops off at 8.9.10 am and picks up at 8.9.10 pm, which is very convenient.
There are many types of breakfast, which can cater for people with various tastes, and there is room for improvement.

Finally, I called the landline and the manager on duty answered the phone. He said it was the concierge. I asked him to send me a quilt. After ten minutes, he directly sent me a wrinkled quilt core, which was not there. I had to get up early to go to Disneyland the next day, so I didn’t bother to call and cover it, so I just covered it with it. It started to itch immediately. It was so unhygienic. Did I ask for a quilt without using it to cover it? No need for a quilt?
Hygiene: I feel that there is no concept of hygiene at all
Service: basically non-existent. You have to go down to the first floor to pick up takeaways.
Facilities: The store has been open for more than 20 years, but there is no response after turning the lights off and on for a long time.

msg:I chose to stay here for the weekend concert. The coupon I grabbed with Ctrip is equivalent to 500+ per night for an executive room. It is considered to be very cost-effective in Shanghai.
  Check-in: If there is a peak check-in period at the front desk, you may have to wait a little longer. However, the service at Doris and Ray is warm, thoughtful and meticulous. They will explain the hotel facilities in detail. This is something that many hotel staff do unintentionally. It is very good.
  Hotel rooms: The bedding is of normal standard, with hard and soft labels. The room maintenance is acceptable, but it looks a bit old. Especially the towel rack in the shower room has obvious signs of rust.
  Guest courtesy; welcome fruits (not as stingy as some *****s, but still very generous for a holiday)
  Executive Lounge: The lounge manager has a very humble attitude and will take the initiative to say hello and ask for needs and suggestions individually. The staff will take the initiative to make tea for each guest. It is really unexpected for a holiday. The variety is not rich but full of Halloween features🎃
  Situation supplement: I encountered the room card demagnetization in the middle and was invited to try the new hot pot when it was magnetized at the front desk. I had just come down from the club and was already full. I declined but couldn't resist the enthusiasm of the staff and participated in the trial. There was a pre-dinner fruit hot pot. There are quite a lot of seasonings and the side dishes are of good quality, especially the texture of the beef, which is either cheap meat or the candles used are not very light. I recommend changing to grilled fish candles/sprinklers. The cost is 2 yuan each. After the meal, I was invited to give out wine, but I don’t drink and refused. Throughout the whole process, the attitude of the staff was very humble and enthusiastic. No bad encounters or indifferences were encountered. The cleaning/security staff would take the initiative to say hello. I think this is due to the hotel's emphasis on and pursuit of cultural cultivation.
   Experience summary: Generally speaking, it is worth recommending. It is really worth trying as a holiday. There are many foreign guests and the festival is rich in color. There is a shuttle bus to Disney. It is recommended to stay with children!

msg:Title: As the best hotel to stay in when visiting Disneyland, Holiday Inn Shanghai Pudong Greenland is my first choice. I will come back next time.

We planned this Disney trip as early as a month ago, excluding Toy Story and Disney hotels, what kind of hotels should we look for? There is a shuttle bus, breakfast included, complete facilities, a high floor with a wide view, and convenient living functions nearby. I stayed for four consecutive days, so it must be very cost-effective. The Holiday Inn Shanghai Pudong Greenland made me very moved and unforgettable.

1. Customer service is in-depth and considerate
We haven’t traveled for four years after the epidemic. One of the two suitcases we carried couldn’t open the lock and one forgot the password. After hearing our appeal, the account manager Simon and the friends in the lobby assisted us without damaging the structure. Solve this difficult problem. We wanted to leave a tip and said that this is what they should do. The very good attitude also showed professionalism and patience in listening to customer needs that ordinary services cannot.

2. The shuttle bus route is thoughtfully arranged
The hotel provides scheduled shuttle buses to Disneyland and People's Square, allowing guests to make full use of transportation resources. When checking in, the account manager will ask the receptionist to provide a dedicated WeChat account. Customers can book shuttle buses and ask questions about their stay in the hotel through online interaction, which is very considerate. The shuttle bus driver is also very dedicated. During the journey and before arriving at the destination, he will clearly explain the stop of the subsequent shuttle bus and publicly contact the driver's phone number for the convenience of guests. Because we were delayed on our return trip to Disneyland, we also contacted the driver. , ended up being five minutes late, thank you Mr. Driver for waiting and other passengers for your tolerance.

3. A rich hotel breakfast was prepared for us in advance
We have breakfast every day in the restaurant on the first floor. The restaurant manager George comes to take care of the dining situation every day. When the shuttle bus time is tight, he can also call the restaurant hotline through the guest room and ask the chef to help us prepare omelet eggs and wonton noodles in advance. You can eat immediately when you come down and take a seat. Other facilities such as coffee and salad are also quite sufficient, allowing guests to have more choices.

Looking for a professional, considerate, comfortable and cost-effective Disney travel hotel, Holiday Inn Shanghai Pudong Greenland is definitely your first choice.

msg:We stayed in a parent-child room on the 16th floor. Due to the high floor, the room only had closed floor-to-ceiling windows and no windows that could be opened for ventilation. When my husband and I checked in on April 5th, we felt that the room was stuffy and the ventilation was not good, but it was already late that night. It was not early and we were very tired so we went to bed directly. I woke up once in the middle of the night due to stuffiness, and fell asleep again in a daze. When I woke up in the morning, I felt dizzy. I felt better when I went to have breakfast on the ground floor of the hotel. Once I got back to the room, it started to feel stuffy again. It's a vacuum state. If you stay there for a while, it will become very stuffy, so stuffy that you can't breathe easily. In the morning, because my husband went out to do errands, we were the only two people in the room with my child. Because it was too boring, I took the child out twice. As soon as I got back to the room, I felt so stuffy that I felt dizzy. Then I couldn’t bear it anymore and went to the hotel lobby to check out. Room is available! Because the room was too stuffy, I was in a bad state. I felt nauseous and had chest tightness for a long time until I got home at night! I wonder what everyone would do if they stayed in this kind of room? It was my first time to stay in such a stuffy hotel, I felt like I was about to pout! The experience is really bad!

Environment: There is RT-Mart next to the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. It is not far from Disney and there is a shuttle bus for meetings.
Service: The service provided by Vicky and Nico at the front desk was particularly good. They had sweet smiles and were amiable. They gave me a feeling of being attentive to family members.
Special car transfer from People's Square: Although the hotel is far from the city center, there is a shuttle bus to the city center, which is very convenient.
Free pick-up and drop-off Disney shuttle service (reservation required one day in advance): There are two free shuttle buses in the morning, which is convenient and convenient.

Although it's remote, it's not remote at all. The location of the hotel is very convenient.

I slept very well in the room and the breakfast in the hotel was rich.
I picked up 3 umbrellas from the front desk during the morning peak of heavy rain. Xiao Chen was very enthusiastic. After returning from work in the afternoon, I went to Disney again. I had already checked out and took the hotel shuttle bus, and helped with various arrangements.
I was a little tired because I had to rush to other places in the evening. The shuttle bus driver was also very talkative, which relieved me from the fatigue of the business trip. I will definitely recommend it to my colleagues if I have the opportunity to come again.

I thought that since I left my phone number, a staff member might communicate with me on the phone. However, no one from Goose contacted me. After leaving the park, the family was exhausted and no longer had the energy to find a hotel shuttle bus or communicate (besides, I didn’t have the contact information of the concierge staff), so we took a taxi back. 2. During the peak breakfast period on the 12th, the restaurant staff did not limit the number of customers at the first time, resulting in a mess in the restaurant. There were no seats, no food, and even cutlery and plates were almost unavailable.

msg:Shanghai Pudong Greenland Holiday Hotel: Looking forward to the early resumption of the gym

【Exclusive Memory】
"Every time I stay in their house, they will help me upgrade to the largest executive suite, full of sincerity."

Because of the plague for three years, the gym and swimming pool are out of service, so they are currently in the process of repairing. As for when they will reopen, it is still unknown. Pushing open the window is a large area of ​​villas (self-built houses or relocated houses of farmers), and the history of preferring a bed in Puxi to a house in Pudong has long been an old calendar.

【Guest room snapshot】
"The living room area of ​​the suite is large enough, suitable for doing some simple indoor fitness like Yiheng."

The bathtub is the standard long ***** of the old model. There was mucus and filthy dirt on the bedside table. I don't know what it was. After the bed was turned down, there was still there, which showed that the bed was turned down very perfunctorily and carelessly.

【Brief introduction to the public area】
"The main entrance of the hotel is on the side, and the passage is very quiet, which is also suitable for drivers to wait, which is rare in Holiday Inns."

InterContinental’s WeChat mini-program recently launched a stamp collection activity, you can use your mobile phone to virtual stamp the check-in records of various brands of mobile phones (except Six Senses), but the front desk of this store is in internal testing (before June 18, it is in the internal testing period) activities I don't know much about it. The front desk staff asked several hotel management staff to figure it out. This point, Expo Center Smart Selection is more professional. They will take the initiative to ask me whether to stamp it. Obviously, the latter's occupancy rate and membership The occupancy rate is higher than Pudong Greenland Holiday. No gym. There is no lobby bar, and the welcome drink is also available at the all-day dining restaurant.

【Breakfast Overview】
"Breakfast is on the first floor, just turn left when you get out of the elevator."

The decoration is fresh and elegant, which can be regarded as the transitional level from version 1.0 to version 2.0 of the holiday. There is an outdoor area, including slides, but unfortunately it is not yet open.

"The executive lounge is on the 21st floor. The waiter Alan Lu (Lu Xiaobing) is very humble and professional. I like it."

The front desk of the hotel said that they do not provide turndown service, but after my negotiation, they sent someone here (it is said that the cleaning staff has already left work). This is because the training is not in place. Naturally, Zhixuan does not have turndown service, but it should not be there on holidays ah. During the happy hour in the lounge, it is recommended not to fry hot dishes with onions, because the smoke is not well exhausted, and it will choke your nose. This hotel currently does not provide the 2.0 version of cute animal dolls and related souvenirs.

【Replenish missing points】
"Many friends who go to Disney will live here with their families. Compared with hotels around the park, it is much cheaper."

On the evening of every week and Saturday, the hotel provides a crayfish buffet dinner. The hotel is foreign-related, and there are many foreign guests, which once again confirms the long history, global influence, appeal and high cost performance of the "Holiday" brand, and is especially suitable for business trips.

The hotel is a 20-minute drive from Disney, and there will be two shuttle buses in the morning, so don't worry if you buy an early enjoyment card. The breakfast is served very early, and the variety is relatively rich. The coffee is very delicious. The front desk manager Avicii was very enthusiastic when we checked in. Because two families were staying, he helped us adjust the twin room in time. The housekeeping director VW also gave the children schoolbags from the hotel, which was very touching. The room is clean and tidy, no smell and no smoking. The most important thing is that the sound insulation effect is very good, so it will not be noisy at all. There is a villa area next to the hotel, and there is a RT-Mart supermarket next door, which is very convenient for shopping and takeaway.

The facilities are outdated, and there are many obvious scratches on the front and side of the tables, chairs, and cabinets. There are cigarette burn holes in the fabric of the chair, old towels and bath towels, the position of the bedside lamp, it is easy to hit the head, and the carpet is also dirty. I left something in the room when I checked out. I made two calls to the front desk. Different waiters answered. They both said to help me find it as soon as possible. They left their phone numbers and said they would call me back if they could find it. The result was 24 hours. passed without any reply.

但是這次入住體驗太差了，首先房間的電話，我時候來攜程上看別人的評價發現不是我一個人有這個問題，電話上的客房服務這類按鍵按出去是忙音，後來看了別人的評價，才知道還要先按0，那酒店是不是可以在電話上貼一個温馨提示呢
其次，入住那天是上海最冷的那天，房間的空調開了一晚上還是不熱，沒辦法衹能下樓去找前台（對，因為房間電話的關係，我跑上跑下3次）給了個取暖機……運轉的聲音就……反正沒發開過夜
攜程預訂的套餐，可能酒店這邊還沒有全員通知到，前台根本不知道有這個……
反正這次入住挺失望的
但是前台的服務值得表揚，在我跑上跑下3次，電話無法使用，房間空調製熱保持在16度，人凍到不行的情況下，實在忍不住朝前台的妹妹發火了，她還是很耐心的接待我

1. 定了兩間房間。因為要去迪斯尼玩。提前和前台定了第二天早餐打包。説了我們有3個大人和三個小孩。結果早晨衹準備了1個蘋果和一個李子和4個圓形的小蛋糕那個小麪包*2。我們這麼多人都定的有早餐的房間都不給我們提示下讓我們去外面買早餐。他們的早餐很少。導致第二天行程全部被延期耽擱
3. 出去玩累了一天回來發現床單非常臟。小顆粒的黑色類似沙子之類的。還有別人的頭髮。太累了自己清理下睡覺。完全沒精力和酒店折騰。
3. 攜帶小孩沒有給配洗簌用品。問他們要都沒有人考慮到位。
4. 定的相同房間。結果一間有浴缸一間沒有。感覺被區別對待。
通過上述感覺這家連鎖酒店丟了他們品牌的臉。還請多提升。 還有酒店游泳池外包的。去游泳還要我簽字。我很納悶了。我還要簽字。總感覺要求有點過份。簽名這個很反感

最後兩天，房間對着的別墅區裏大大小小的煙花已經放起來了。站在窗口，高些的煙花正到這裏，大概是比放煙花的人更好的觀景角度吧。

從早餐看起來，最初的商務客為主，到這兩天帶着孩子的家庭客居多，便感受到春節近了。而員工的紅圍巾也添了喜氣，格外靚麗。


從前台到餐廳到清潔，一如既往家人般的温暖態度。這裏還會是下次商旅的選擇。

早餐環境，品種還可以，不過注意到，很多餐桌的邊角都已經破損，很不安全。希望能有所改善。

msg:4.24 at 5 pm the housekeeping aunt came in to clean. There was a cell phone on the bed. I was putting on makeup and my partner was on the sofa. Everyone was doing their own things. Then when the housekeeping aunt was changing the sheets, she wrapped up the phone on the bed and put it in the linen cart. Afterwards, I asked the aunt if she had shaken it to check if there was anything inside the sheets. The aunt also said no. Then my partner and I went out at 8 pm and came back at 10 pm. When we were getting ready to go to bed in the early morning, we found that my partner's other iPhone 14promax was missing. We immediately called the manager on duty, but the other party said that it was absolutely impossible that someone from their hotel had taken it. Their attitude was just so-so and they didn't seem to want to help us solve the problem. It was very speechless. The police came the next day and asked the aunt about the situation at that time. The aunt meant that she didn't check the sheets in her hand at that time. Anyway, she just rolled them into a ball and put them in the linen cart. Then the aunt went off work. In the end, the employees of a third-party company that cleans the linens came and pushed the linen cart away. I'm too lazy to say more about the rest. The phone was 100% in the linen cart. If it wasn't in the linen cart or if it fell somewhere, it would have been picked up by someone. Why couldn't the aunt check it at that time? Besides, we were traveling as customers. When the housekeeping department came to clean, could we not put our phones on the bed? ??? ??? ??? Very funny. Now the hotel has been blaming the police station and refusing to compensate us. It is really funny. They also repeatedly asked my partner and I if we really put our phones on the bed? ??? Most importantly, why did we have to direct and act out this scene of dropping our phones? ??? ??? ??? Finally, I want to tell everyone to avoid this hotel under the InterContinental Group. The management is not in place! What did my partner and I do wrong? We just wanted to travel to Shanghai and eat delicious food, but our phones were left on the bed. We went out to eat and when we came back, our phones were gone. Did the aunt come in and change the sheets halfway through? ??? Everyone, open your eyes! ! This hotel is really unreliable! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My partner also bought the phone on JD.com for more than 8,000 yuan!

I asked for noodles for breakfast but the chef was not clear-headed and refused to give them after waiting for a long time. The security guard at the gate was looking at people! All 7 of us in our group gave this hotel bad reviews! ! !
