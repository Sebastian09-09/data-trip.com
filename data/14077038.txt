msg:Not good enough….The hotel is in a good location and has a decent breakfast , the area where the breakfast is served is quite charming. The hotel is big, but very dated looks like it was a big hotel in the 80s or 90s and hasn’t updated the style since. The rooms are not very big and the decor is tired. The hotel staff is not very friendly, quite the opposite, especially front desk. The cooking staff from breakfast is lovely though,l. The swimming pool is not great, the water is very cold. Too pricey for what it offers, even for Shanghai prices.

During peak time (around 9-9:30am) the food in a number of areas had been eaten and not replenished. The service in the bar downstairs was a bit slow, it took a really long time to make the cocktails on both afternoons we visited. Having said that, the caipirinhas were delicious! The staff are always lovely, especially in housekeeping. This is a really good hotel to use as a base for weekend visits in Shanghai.

Pretty much the same people since Hilton was running the facility. Stayed 3 times during 2023 and keep coming back. I know shanghai well after living there for many years, must important to me to is the morning walk in FFC. End with a x2 espresso at the cafe across the street. Sit outside and do some people watching. You have park a 5 min walk away or the best shopping 10 min away. Still I would head down Julu Lu, skip the hotel breakfast and have a dumpling soup. Check out IAPM mall and walk Wulumuchi Lu back to the hotel. Stop by Avocado Lady and say hello! Now you know what shanghai is all about and where Kunlun fits in :)

msg:I’m not sure this meets the criteria of a 5 star hotel in terms of the room I stayed in and the amenities. The price per night was reasonable, given the excellent location. The building itself is impressive and the foyer is beautifully appointed. Staff are friendly and efficient and the check in process was smooth.
The room was on the 24th floor and in need of a facelift. Lots of ‘patching’ was evident in the room. The pillows need replacing, as does the frayed and dated carpet. The bathroom had an old-fashioned weighing scale, which I found pointless. Towels were frayed as well. The lighting needs upgrading, as I noticed unless you close the bathroom door, it is quite dark around the WC.
No coffee machine, which is something I haven’t seen in a while and I’ve stayed in a few 5 star hotels across China over the past few months. Empty mini-bar and if you want to access the movie channel it’ll cost you 38 rmb. 
A shower curtain instead of shower doors is always one of my pet hates. Lots of silicone filler around the shower tub as well, which shows me an upgrade is necessary at some point.
Room service is 30 minutes. I ordered a beef burger with fries for 138 rmb. A can of Coke will set you back 25 rmb. I also ordered room service breakfast. The bakery basket was ok but 59 rmb for an ice coffee was a bit excessive.
Will I be back? Given the location was convenient for where I needed to be, maybe. Based on comparison to other hotels downtown? Then no.

Location
Interactive TV (if available, some rooms don’t have it, I’ve been into 3 different rooms)
Gym
Swimming pool
Wi-Fi very stable (I was able to get some work done)

Cons:
Cleanliness 
The view is beautiful (to jing’an temple), but the windows are so dirty you cannot even take a good picture.
Needs some renovation (rooms are old and musty, that’s why I changed room)
Even the blanket and towels were old and dirty, (you can see the photos).
They decide when to turn on the AC, not you, but if you feel hot they can send you a fan (😒) or they will suggest you to open the window (and you will hear the noisy construction right in front of the room. I was in the 32nd floor and we could still hear the noise)

Breakfast is average, there was about 3-4 options of most things. But not many deli and no cheese (not even for omelette, by the way, the omelette cook wasn’t there and I guess someone else tried to do my omelette and land me those scrambled eggs with eggshell. Lol (see picture)
The service was also average, some days were better than others. (I guess it depended on the amount the guests they have).
The location, the TV and the pool were definitely the highlight for me, as I was staying with my son for visa purposes and my son is 5, so he could at least watch movies (in English) and enjoy the swimming pool.

msg:My recent stay at this hotel was incredibly disappointing, especially since I had previously found it decent during a business trip. This time, however, I encountered several issues that left me shocked and dissatisfied.

Firstly, it became evident that the hotel treated guests differently based on their background. I booked two rooms through separate platforms, one for my Caucasian friend and one for myself. When my friend requested a late check-out, the staff was accommodating and allowed them to check out at 2 pm. In contrast, when I called to inquire about a late check-out, I was told it was only possible until 1 pm, and the person on the phone seemed impatient and unhelpful when I asked for a slight extension until 1:30 pm.

Furthermore, the room had maintenance issues, particularly with the toilet, which did not flush properly. Despite reporting this to the hotel concierge, the problem was never resolved, and I had to repeatedly ask the cleaning staff for assistance throughout my stay.

During our visit to the steam room, my friend inadvertently left the door ajar, and one of the staff members responded with unnecessary rudeness. This unprofessional behavior was both surprising and disappointing.

To add to the list of grievances, the internet didn't work on my last night and continued to be unavailable in the morning. Considering that I paid for what was supposed to be a 5-star experience, this was a highly unpleasant stay.

I had hoped for a comfortable and enjoyable stay at this hotel, but I received the opposite. I will definitely avoid this establishment in the future and would advise others to do the same. It fell far short of the quality and service one would expect from a 5-star hotel.

I have to request hotel service to give us standard set of towels, not just two pieces.  Initially the room was even not equipped with refrigerator and we have to request it to be installed at the place where obviously was set for the refrigerator.  
We have to request to change the room twice, but all the rooms given to us has either no working bath room vent or no vent at all.  The humidity was so high the hotel even have to deploy dehumidifier in hallway.  Eventually we have to move out this hotel to find another one, which was really a headache.
We will never recommend this hotel to anyone.

I wasn’t satisfied with the first room and in second i smelled cigarettes a little ( hang on good things are coming) but they helped me change the room and did half an hour air purifying in my room which was helpful to get rid of smell. I mean rooms should not have any cigs smell at the first place but i do appreciate taking quick notice and fixing problem for me at 2:00 am. The room itself was beautiful and comfortable and great JingAN temple view from big window.Besides impeccable customer service, hotel’s gym/Jacuzzi / sauna rooms are my Fav!!  Ill go for that jacuzzi and sauna definitely again. 😍

The hotel`s location was excellent as it was very close to the jingan temple, bars, restaurants, and shopping areas.The service was great and most staff speak English. I even forgot some stuffs but they were made secure and safe until I pick them up the following day. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not so big but you'll always find something for you. I had the Christmas eve dinner as well and everything was fantastic, including the gingerbread cookie giveaway. The only thing that made my stay a bit uncomfortable is that my room was right behind the lift. I felt like a subway is passing-by whenever the elevators move up and down. However, I can still say that in general, the hotel and my stay was great. Will just try to get another room next time.

msg:We decided to have a weekend away from home with our infant son.  The Kunlun hotel is easily accessible by subway lines 2, 7, and 14, and easy enough to roll around with a stroller.  There are good westerna and Chinese dining options within a 15 minute walk.  The front desk staff were efficient and our check-in was smooth, despite the number of administrative steps due to Covid.

We were first taken to a room which had not been cleaned.  Within 15 minutes, we were moved into an adjacent room and the staff were apologetic and courteous.  The room itself was clean and our son was able to roam about on the floor.  The furnishings are simple, dated, and clean.  The minifridge does not work, and robes were not provided in the rooms.  The bathroom is simple, with a low bath.  The bed was comfortable, and a crib was available.  The temperature in the room was quite hot and we seemed to have limited control over the air flow or temperature.  The windows do open partially to allow for air flow.  There are many outlets, but no USB charging ports except for a single jerry-rigged cord sticking out of the wall with a multi-end charger.  Bottles of water were available for free in the room, but there were no other snacks or beverages, free or otherwise.  Overall, we were satisfied with the room and would stay again, perhaps checking out an upgraded room.  Good value for the location.

The swimming pool water was a comfortable temperature, but the air was a little chilly, probably nicer in the warmer months.  The pool was divided into a swimming half and a kids half.  There was a lifeguard on duty the whole time.  The pool is not large for doing laps, but is quite satisfactory for kids to play around in.  The changing rooms were clean, and featured some hot baths and steam rooms.  The showers were large and luxurious.  There is a small functional gym, a yoga studio, and a (paid) squash court.  Overall we were happy with the gym and swimming facilities.  

Breakfast as a high point of the stay.  We arrived before 8am, and the sunlight was coming through the skylights and made for quite a pleasant meal.  There are a number of western and Chinese options for breakfast, and we enjoyed everything that we ate.  There was an omelet bar and a noodle bar, as well as a number of hot and cold dishes which all looked freshly prepared.  There are a variety of coffees and fresh pressed juices as well.  We really enjoyed breakfast.
Go early for breakfast, as the serving area is small and was quickly crowded after we arrived.  

Good for either business travel or a family staycation.

msg:The hotel service is not classy at all. I wonder why the hotel director allows such a cheap act. 
1. You have to pay for a mask. Mask in China is so cheap. Even a 3-star hotel gives away a mask for free. The receptionist told me because this is a hotel. LIKE HELLO! Yes, a 5-star hotel so you should give it for free. The surgical mask is only 0.01 RMB per piece.
2. So there was a typhoon in Shanghai, you have to deposit 100RMB for the umbrella at the concierge. This is crazy as you were asked for a 500RMB deposit upon check-in. Thus, if you lose an umbrella, there's a 500 deposit they can get 100 from. I'm not sure if the manager is thinking right. 
3. When you go get a buffet breakfast, they'll ask you if you want coffee. Good right? But when you said your coffee (mine was only Iced latte), they'll ask you for money. They said they only serve Americano. Iced latte is only expresso + milk, they obviously have it as there was a bar and they serve coffee, and not self-service. They want to only serve coffee, and you get the milk and you make your own ice latte. You should have not asked me if I want coffee then!

I've been to a lot of 5-star hotels in and out of China but this one really wants to charge and charge money as much as they could. Too bad. 
But I was happy with the housekeeping, the reception people at the gym and the pool, the caretaker of the Sauna. I feel sorry for them for having people at the lobby and service crew not as good as them as they didn't deserve this grade because of the greed of the management.

msg:Good service

The best thing about this hotel was the service.
Good location
Buffet: It was the smallest breakfast buffet area I have seen in a 5 star hotel, however it might be small but it is well appointed. There is a good mix of western and Chinese foods, however some of the food needs to be kept hotter.
Executive Lounge: it is worth paying the extra for the executive lounge access. You get breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktail which includes food and drinks. If you are looking for a staycation or a relaxing time just lounging in the hotel it is a nice perk.
Room: my first room had mould growing on the ceiling near the air conditioner. When I reported it they took me to see another room and it’s mould was even worse. They did find me a room with no visable/smellable mould. They advertise each room has a bath tub, this may be true but they are not great bath tubs. The first room’s bathtub was much better then the room I spent most of my time in. The 2nd room’s bathtub, if you stand in it full to the secondary drain (because of the constant secondary drain you can only fill it halfway) it only came up to just above my ankles and I am short so not really worth having a bath. If you are like me and love a long soak in the bath while on holiday then this place really is not for you. Room and bed was comfortable and for Shanghai actually a good size.

The face is very solemn, there is no smile, and the service is blunt. The eldest lady in the noodle cooking area really has to look at her face before she can have wonton stew. Make a bowl of wonton stew, lower your head and say nothing, and then ask Chaos, can you give me a bowl? Or just take care of yourself. So it depends on your taste. There are potato chip residues under the bed in the room. Needless to say, the front desk has a different attitude when it comes to receiving foreign guests and Chinese people. Consumers are all glass-hearted. Because of the uneven service, I really don’t want to stay at your house. Except for the better location, which I barely chose, it is really a few blocks away from other hotel groups.

msg:First about the pros:
- the location of the hotel is excellent, close to the metro, the French Quarter and the temple
- the view from the window is excellent
- good room cleaning

Minuses:
- we weren’t met with our suitcases at the entrance, we weren’t helped with taking our suitcases to our room, we weren’t shown to our room (usually a five-star hotel has this)
- service at the reception took a long time + employees were constantly distracted by other guests who came up and asked questions out of turn. Check in is very long
- breakfast is good, but the choice is small for 5 stars. There is very little European food without unusual sauces and flavors.
- the pool is beautifully photographed for the booking site, but in reality it is smaller than it appears in the photo. The water is cold (although they say 28 degrees on the board, but clearly lower). And also - the only hotel where you need to swim in the pool only in a cap that presses. No relaxation.

msg:There is absolutely no advantage except for the location. I almost never give a bad review to a hotel. However, this hotel is really bad in all aspects.
1. I almost didn’t experience any service during the whole process. The attitude was very indifferent whether it was check-in or check-out. No one took my luggage when I got off the bus and got on the bus. Is this service very complicated?
2. There is only one box of tissue paper in the room. There is no toilet paper in the room. I read that someone has already raised this issue in the comments, but it has not been adopted.
3. The cleaning products are as shown in the picture. This brand cannot be found in any software, so it is difficult for the hotel to search for you. They didn't even give me toothpaste or Colgate. I didn't use the toothbrush and didn't comment on it. I want to ask where the 900 room fee per night was spent. The cost has been reduced to this extent.
4. During the three days I stayed, the cleaning lady started cleaning around 9:00, and the sound insulation was not very good.
5. The room is old, and the cleaning is not adequate, and some floors are covered with dust.
6. It’s okay if the takeout can’t be delivered. The takeout counter is still set up outside the hotel door.
7. The air conditioner is hard to use and inconvenient to adjust. Of course, this is the most insignificant shortcoming among these items.

This is the longest hotel review I have ever written, and the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I visited during the epidemic, but I remember it was not that bad. I won't come again, and I hope I will be careful when I come.

You can see Jing'an Temple from the window. You can go for a walk in the morning. The hotel facilities are also good. The lobby is very spacious. The breakfast is clean and of good quality.
Disadvantages: 1. The dirtiest five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. It is recommended to dismiss the housekeeping manager and replace the staff. There is no minimum sanitation trea**ent, inadequate staff training, no unified sanitation standards, insufficient water supply in the guest rooms, no slippers, no toothbrushes, all of which must be requested by yourself. The delivery is an old man, and the important thing is that you have to ask for it every day. Look at how to make this phone call, how to sit on this chair, how many days has this lamp not been cleaned, what kind of five-star hotel is this? This hotel is very low because of the inaction of your housekeeping depar**ent. Why do you keep such staff if you don’t replace them?
2. I didn't see any service. The restaurant collected the plates with a blank expression on their faces. They just took them and left without any basic gestures. It can be seen that the catering depar**ent has no unified training. There was a male staff member who greeted me at the door with a blank expression on his face. Basically, all the staff I met in the hotel had blank expressions on their faces. I really want to know what's wrong with you?

Adding an executive courtesy is most suitable for parents. When you are tired from walking, go up to see the scenery and take a break and have something to eat. The people who provide the executive courtesy are also very kind and remind you when to come next time.

The downside is that the bathroom is small. Everything else is perfect, highly recommended

It looks like a regular high-rise building with an unassuming entrance hall. But as soon as you enter the revolving door, you will see a spacious lobby, a high-ceiling space, a luxurious and elegant decoration, and the soft voice of the waiter. The greeting, and the friendliness of the front desk lady, made me feel comfortable. We booked a hotel package (RMB1088), which includes one night in an executive deluxe room, happy hour afternoon tea in the executive lounge, and steak Wellington dinner for two. The executive deluxe rooms are located above the 36th floor. The view from the upper floors is very good. The traffic on Yan'an Elevated Road is like a march of ants under the window [laughing]. At night, the night view of Lujiazui, Pudong is clearly visible. Afternoon tea is located in the executive lounge on the 38th floor, which is exquisite. Chinese and Western snacks, as well as soft drinks, red wine, whiskey, etc. (all free to eat and drink), the elegant and comfortable environment is very suitable for checking in when you have nothing to do🎬; although the heated swimming pool in the fitness center is not big, because there are only a few swimmers, Private venue. In the evening, the highlight of the trip was to taste the Wellington steak dinner, which is known as the Buddha Jumping Over the Wall in Western food. It was also a perfect ending to the celebration of Goddess' Day. There was basically no dissatisfaction with the entire trip. If I were to nitpick, it would be that the borscht for dinner was a little salty.

There was a handsome guy who proactively reminded me that I had lost my doll. I am very satisfied with the entire stay and give it 100 points. The only thing is that there are low-quality guests in the executive lounge. They sit there for a long time (the view seat next to the innermost bar). From 2 pm until closing at 8:30, they rely on these two seats, which is also weird. The staff must also be very helpless.

In addition, when I was waiting in line at the front desk, two groups of people passed by me who was queuing to talk to the front desk staff... The lady at the front desk actually didn't tell the guests that they needed to queue up, and everyone just ignored me in front of the line? Forget about guests who want to jump in line, is this the quality of the front desk staff?

msg:The earliest five-star hotel in Shanghai, it has a good location. You can walk around, including Jing'an Temple, Jiuguang, and the former residences of celebrities. It's quite Shanghai. The hotel service is good, maybe because of the Chris**as weekend, it is very popular. The hotel has a good environment, the room is not big, but the window view is very good. The executive lounge has good views and good service. There are not many varieties, but the taste is okay. Happy hour has a wide variety of drinks, making it a great place to relax, chat, and meet friends.

Apples and pears are inconvenient to eat because they don’t have shavings, but the environment is very good. I saw a happy hour at 5:30 and had a lot of food. There are fruit plates, cakes, snacks, prawns, staple food, and several kinds of wine. But due to time I couldn't try it because of the reason.

The hotel is relatively old, but the room hygiene is still OK. The front desk upgraded the room type, but it was close to the elevator, and there was always the sound of the elevator going up and down at night. A little noisy, but bearable. The location is very good and the front desk service is also very friendly. The Wellington set meal tasted very average. I ordered it medium rare and it was still very hard. The whole dinner felt like a quick Western meal. But the price is there, so you can’t ask for too much.

The smell of smoke spread to my room and kept me awake for two days. The lobby service is fast and kind. Please arrange a room overlooking Jing'an Temple for me next time. The waiters were very kind and hard-working. They arranged my cosmetics like a Ruiou counter. The pillow towels I brought were also spread out for me every day.

1. The hotel facilities are relatively old, and the metal surface of the wardrobe door is old and has many scratches. Some lights in the bathroom are old and dark yellow.
2. The hotel service is quite satisfactory. When I asked the front desk for my needs, the front desk was a little impatient, but when I provided supplies, I still provided service with a smile.
3. The location of the hotel is excellent. Less than 100 meters away from the hotel is the Jing'an Temple subway entrance, with convenient transportation. The hotel is also very close to the Jing'an Temple business district. There is an overpass, so there is no need to wait for traffic lights and zebra crossings.
4. The hotel room can overlook the three major buildings in Pudong, Shanghai and the Oriental Pearl Tower.
All in all, it’s still worth the experience.

If the weather is bad, there will be a really cold wind all night. It is suitable for residents who like to be cold. The bathroom is very small. The shower stands in the bathtub. The water is good and will not block.
Service: The room cleaning service is pretty good, but the doorman in the lobby, the front desk, and the salesperson in the lobby bar have no service at all. There was a female receptionist who was very funny. She didn't take the initiative to clean the hotel on the first day when the hotel was fully occupied for two days, and she said very nicely, "I won't charge you a deposit this way." It felt like I was getting a big advantage.
Breakfast: If you can't eat it, don't eat it. The size of the breakfast area, the number of varieties, and the one-size-fits-all closing price are too disproportionate to the number of residents.
Transportation: Although transportation is convenient, if you take the subway, you have to walk for a long time. Bus No. 71 is not bad ~
Overall: If the requirements are not high, you can stay here, but I will not choose it again in the future.

Environment: The location of the hotel is great 👍🏻 Turn left when you go out and you will reach Line 2. Turn right when you go out and you will reach Line 7 100 meters away. The magnificent Jing'an Temple is right in front of you!
Service: The hotel management is orderly and the service is friendly and warm! I made a mistake in booking the room but helped me choose it!

msg:This is my first time staying at this hotel. The environment is very nice and the lobby environment looks very comfortable. Although it is an old hotel that has been around for decades, it is still well maintained. Because I am on a business trip to Shanghai, my most basic requirement for the environment is quietness and quality sleep. After listening to my request, manager Leo at the front desk very considerately helped me find a quiet room.
After putting down my luggage, I started exploring the hotel and accidentally arrived at the executive lounge on the 38th floor. Although this order did not include the right to use the lounge, Manager Shen and Xiao Wang at the lounge welcomed me warmly. Pour me some tea and introduce me to the lounge in detail. This is what service should be like. Guests are treated warmly regardless of whether they have made a purchase or not. I will find a chance to experience it next time I am on a business trip.

msg:Kunlun Hotel Jing'an Shanghai is located in the center of Jing'an Temple which means the center of the city center.
▪️Location: Lines 2, 7, and 14. Whether it is access to transportation or the nearby business district, it is impeccable.
▪️Service attitude: Very warm and enthusiastic, especially with the rapid development of AI tec, many of which are replaced by machines. But I have always believed that hospitality requires warmth and emotion.
▪️Catering and food: Jing'an Gallery on the 1st floor, Liantian Pavilion on the 1st floor - Xianyan on the 1st floor, and the executive lounge on the 38th floor all have their own characteristics. It is a good choice to have a drink at night and experience the night view of Jing'an Temple.

The location is good and the hotel is fully equipped. Although the hotel is a bit old, the hotel's temperament is still there and the price-performance ratio is very good. High, especially this time, I felt a little more considerate about the hotel service. I left an earphone in the hotel 2 hours before departure. The gym attendant was very careful to help me find it and mailed it to Beijing. Thank you very much. At the same time I tried the search service once and I am very satisfied with the result😄😄😄

Not even as good as some express hotels. Landline calls can only be dialed on speakerphone. I don't know why I can't push it out after lifting it up.
Hygiene: The bathtub is a bit sticky to the touch, as if it has not been cleaned
Environment: The room gave me a corner position. The whole thing feels very cramped. When you open the closet door, the aisle is almost blocked. The lighting in the room is rather dim, which I don't like very much.
Service: There is a fee for parking for hotel guests. This is the first time I have encountered this in so many years of traveling. I don’t know if this store is special or if it’s Shanghai. 160 a night. Send 120 coupons. I booked three nights, and I asked if I could get a 360 coupon. Telling one day is for one day and cannot be used in this way. That means you have to pay at least 40 yuan a day to park.
In addition, it is understandable that takeaway food cannot be taken upstairs for safety reasons. But can’t a hotel as big as yours have robots or something? The takeout place was outside the door and the food was cold.

All in all, this stay was a very bad experience. I will not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to my friends. Personally I think it’s not even as good as Quan Ji Atour

msg:During this trip to Shanghai, I stayed in Lujiazui Shangri-La for two nights. I originally planned to stay in Jing'an Kunlun for only one night. I visited Jing'an Temple, Hengshan Road, Wukang Road, and looked at old buildings. The Kunlun Hotel is located at the original site of the Jing'an Hilton, and there are deposits and history of old five-star hotels everywhere. The appearance and facilities of the building have a sense of age, as if people are middle-aged, not as bold and energetic as young people, but it is worse than the service. Precipitation, thoughtful and meticulous, just right. The location is superior, overlooking Jing'an Park and the magnificent Jing'an Temple, about 50 meters away from Exit 12 of Metro Line 14, and it is also quite convenient to take a taxi to the Yan'an Road elevated. All in all, it is cost-effective and value for money. Later, Tianzifang and Sinan Road were added to the itinerary plan, and we needed to stay for one more night. In order to avoid the tedious transition between different room types, we would like to thank the manager Mia at the front desk for helping us with thoughtful arrangements, reservations, upgrades, and extension of the original room. It helped us save costs and made it very comfortable to continue our stay. I like it and will come again.

The package is very cost-effective, and the buffet breakfast is quite rich in hotels of the same level. The view of the administrative corridor on the 38th floor is very good. You can see the rolling traffic on the Yan'an Elevated Road by the window, and overlook the magic city. When sitting quietly, tasting wine and having tea, you will sincerely thank yourself for your efforts, which is very meaningful! The desserts and drinks provided inside are also OK, especially the special cocktails at night, which taste good👍

When choosing a room for us, they didn't explain in advance that the room was separated from the suite. When we entered the room, we could see the door lock on the middle door. It was amazing.
I called and asked to change rooms. The lobby manager categorically said that there were no rooms available without consulting the front desk. I was really speechless.
There are more guests staying during the Spring Festival, which is understandable, but the service attitude is really unacceptable. I originally came here because of the reputation of Kunlun, but I was so disappointed. The only consolation is that the hotel swimming pool is good.

As for the service, you have to rely on roaring to solve the problem, why do you say that? It was said that check-in was only available at 3:00 pm, and then it took nearly an hour to check in. There were so many people queuing up, and only one waiter was arranged to check in! Incredible. . . . Then a big brother got mad because of the card, yelled twice, and the cadres in the room behind the front desk came out to handle errands... Then a waiter was added to check in, and finally it was done, saying that the room hadn't been cleaned yet, so we opened first One room to rest, and then there was no notice to change rooms at 5:30, and finally went to the front desk to see that there was still a row of people, and there was only one window to check in, and no one answered me, I could only learn from the old brother's method before, yelling Two voices, and then the cadres from that door came out to solve the problem...
In short, I probably won't stay in this hotel again, I wish them good luck!

The room was upgraded for free, the view is great, and the hotel service management is indeed a five-star standard.
The only drawback is that the room facilities are slightly older and the bathroom door cannot be closed completely. However, at this price, location and room configuration, it can be said that the flaws are not hidden, but I still hope that the facilities can be updated.

Facilities: The hotel is relatively old and the rooms are relatively small, but the small scenes of the hotel are well designed ~ the environment of the breakfast room and the executive lounge are also good ~ the swimming pool is divided into 1.2 deep water areas for children and adults ~ the water temperature is not high ~ although the swimming pool is not big But the floating board, life jacket, and swimming ring can be taken by yourself, and there are always dry towels~
Food: There are not many types of afternoon tea and light food in the evening, but they can basically fill you up. The kids especially like the creamy pasta, and the curry chicken is also very good. I asked the waiter for white rice with 😂😂😂, executive wine The night view of the corridor is good at night. It is quite good to eat and see the night view. Dads also have small wines to drink.
Service: The service is very good, especially the uncles in Shanghai ~ I feel very kind
Transportation: Opposite is Jing'an Temple, Jiuguang, which is quite convenient

The price/performance ratio is too bad. Apart from being close to Jing'an Temple, I can't find any advantages. It subverts my perception of 5 stars...Maybe this is the case in Shanghai. The facilities are as old as the hotels in Beijing. Can't we deal with the sewage smell in the toilet? I bring my own toilet paper... As for Huang Meitian, can't we add a dehumidifier to the room? Express hotels will bring it, 5 stars can't do some homework? I will stay for two days from June 21 to June 22, 2023, and the comments are true! just disappointed

msg:This should be the third time I stayed at the Kunlun Jing'an Hotel in Shanghai, because the location of this hotel is good
Location: The hotel is located in Jing'an District, you can get there by subway lines 2, 7, and 14. It is very convenient to Jing'an Temple. There are Kerry Center, ASE, eating, and playing nearby. There is IKEA

Facilities: This hotel used to be Hilton, probably because the hotel is quite old. The facilities are okay, but you have to stand in the bathtub to take a shower, which is not very comfortable, and there are flowers on the top of our room when we take a shower Sprinkle will leak, and it's cold water

Hygiene: The sanitation is very clean, and the waiters are very active in cleaning. Because my daughter is on her period, she accidentally stained the quilt. I told the waiter the next day and immediately changed it for us.

Environment: The environment is still good. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you will be greeted by a burst of fragrance. There is flowing water on the small bridge of Tiange Pavilion. The environment is first-class

Service: The service is very good. Every waiter will greet us when they see us. When we entered the lobby, a waiter immediately came up to ask if we need help with luggage?
      The room I booked enjoys executive trea**ent. On the night of check-in, the Japanese-style sukiyaki set meal for two people is okay, but I think the amount is a bit small, and it may not be enough for people with big appetites; there was also a buffet afternoon tea in the executive lounge at that time. The tea is okay, quite satisfactory, I didn’t enjoy it during happy hour
       Because I went to Huashan Hospital for a follow-up visit the next day. The Kunlun Hotel is very close to Huashan Hospital. It takes a few minutes to walk there. When I come to Shanghai in the future, I will still consider staying at it

Problems encountered this time: 1. Disposable slippers are not replaced with new ones after cleaning every day! 2. Mineral water is not provided! You still have to call and ask for it! 3. This is the shower curtain I saw when I took a shower after cleaning up the room!
Suggestion: The price is really not worth staying in such a hotel. The experience is extremely poor. It is really not as comfortable as staying in a fast hotel!

I asked my husband if I can receive up to 6 bottles of purified water a day? He told me seriously: No, it’s up to 4 bottles. Maybe I don’t know the rules very well, but when I stayed at the Hilton Sheraton Intercontinental before, including all seasons, it seemed like the prices were not very limited. The second is that the facilities are relatively old, the room area is small or the utilization rate is not high. In short, the environment is good, transportation is convenient, and service quality needs to be improved. If you are traveling for business, you can choose. If you are traveling with children, it is recommended to choose other hotels.

2⃣️ After check-in, I was asked to sign a very ** document, and told me that the takeaway had to be picked up by myself, and I was not responsible for the delivery. There was a charge for parking in the hotel, 120 a day (are you joking?) The service industry told me that all takeaways are available Don't send it, come down and pick it up yourself. (Here is a very pertinent suggestion for you. There are so many hotels using robots, you can also buy two. Don’t let the guests look at the faces of the waiters.)
3⃣️Look at the grid where the paper towels are placed, it is full of dust, and the sanitation is really poor. The kettle for boiling water is filled with mineral water, and the boiled water is poured out with black particles, which is very speechless.
4⃣️Ask me to bring my own toothbrush and razor? ? ? ? The five-star hotel I lived in told me to bring some things with me, so can't I move my house out? What's wrong? ? ? What international joke? ? ? It's a bit disgusting that you simply change it into a budget hotel like this, isn't it? The shampoo is also a mess, the hair after washing is almost split, no exaggeration, the quality is really poor.
5⃣️I said that one of the charging treasures for the two of us was out of power, so I asked the front desk to send us a data cable. Tell me, borrow the power bank downstairs. Three, can I have a thread? The customer service girl at the front desk said that our lines are all genuine, only Apple, and you have to give at least a 300 deposit (do you look down on customers who can’t pay a 300 deposit????) I said I would definitely give a bad review As a result, the male manager at the front desk sent it up immediately, (the male manager may be the only place worthy of praise)
[To sum up] If it weren't for the fact that Paramount next door didn't have any rooms, I wouldn't choose your house, it's too bad. All aspects are really too much, and the listed five-star hotel feels like a 2-star hotel.

msg:We checked in at 9pm on the first night and were very disappointed when we entered the room. There was a musty smell in the room. This is a 5-star hotel. It was too late, so we had to make do with it. We took a quick shower and went to bed. When we lay down on the bed, it felt very damp. After a while, my whole body started to itch. My companion took a look and found that my back was covered with red rashes! I called the front desk immediately. It took 10 minutes, not an exaggeration. I called twice but no one answered. I finally got through and waited for another 10 minutes for a cleaning lady to come and change the bedding and check the mattress. It was very dirty. After all the trouble, it was already 12 o'clock! Let's make do with it! The next day, I asked the lobby front desk and they told me that they didn't know how to complain to the hotel and didn't know which department I should complain to! I'm a *****! This is a weird hotel!

msg:This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had!

1. serious discrimination
I actually booked two rooms in Kunlun, one for my foreign friends and one for myself. We checked out the same day. My friend first asked if he could check out later, and the front desk happily told him 2 p.m. When I asked, it was told that it was 1 o'clock, and when I asked if it could be a little later, the front desk said in a very impatient tone that it could only be at 1:30. It’s already 2023 and in Shanghai, a first-class city, as a 5-star hotel there is still such discrimination! **!

Poor facilities and poor service!
The bathroom flushes very slowly, it takes three times to flush. And I told the lobby manager, but no one came even though he promised, and even after asking several times the next day, it still wasn't fixed.

The network is super poor
I lived on the 11th floor and couldn't get up at all on the last night and the next morning!

I have actually stayed here before on a business trip and it was pretty good. This time the experience was so bad that I was surprised.

It is very convenient to go to the urban area, to the Shanghai National Convention and Exhibition Center, and to Hongqiao Airport.
Before the epidemic, I was very satisfied with staying at Jing'an Kunlun Hotel for business trips. I hadn't traveled during the three-year epidemic. This time I went to Shanghai to participate in the exhibition and chose Jing'an Kunlun Hotel without hesitation. The quality and service are still very good, even better than before the epidemic better.
Now our company is gradually returning to normal, and the time for business trips has also increased. Next time, we will continue to stay at Jing'an Kunlun Hotel. The quality service and convenient transportation are irreplaceable.

The view is good, the night view from the room is superb, it is the prosperity that Shanghai should have, you can have a panoramic view of Jing'an Temple, and you can see a little bit of the Oriental Pearl Tower. Good location, many subway lines, many buses. Get off at Shanghai Station and take Line 1 to get there directly. When you go out for a stroll, you will find a shopping mall. There is a rapid bus directly under the bridge to the Bund. The main thing is that you don’t have to worry about traffic jams during evening peak hours. It's just that afternoon tea and evening happy hour are too bad... breakfast is okay.

msg:The worst five-star hotel ever.
I originally wanted to revisit this hotel with my children because of the memory of my relationship with my husband and the location. I never thought that the service is completely different from five stars.
1. There are no bed surrounds for infants and children available when you check in. It is recommended for those with babies to choose one.
2. When children move in, they need to make milk. But when I called the hotel to ask for mineral water, I was clearly told that there would be a charge. It is recommended to purchase it in advance at a nearby convenience store.
3. Overnight guests asked for parking coupons, but the concierge said that it was all at the guest's own expense. At your own expense, you can get a 40 yuan coupon from the hotel, right?
4. You must get a ticket for the parking fee. After staying for two nights, the ticket will be less if you go out several times. When you ask the security guard to get it, they will tell you that customers generally do not need tickets.
5. The waiter is unprofessional, has confusing logic, and charges excessively and arbitrarily. For orders placed by Ctrip in advance, we were clearly informed when checking in that 1 of the 3 rooms would be for one night and 2 would be for 2 nights. However, one room will not be available for occupancy in the afternoon of the next day, and payment will need to be made again. When you find the waiter in the evening, the waiter tells you that Ctrip will pay in advance and Ctrip will be responsible for refunding the money. When you clearly tell the waiter to pay online, he tells you that it will take some time for a reply. A seven-month-old pregnant woman went back and forth, and the end result was that the waiter didn't understand what prepayment was and what online payment was. This reason is far-fetched, because I clearly told the waiter and read all Ctrip's online payment orders.
It is recommended that friends who are interested in the old five-star and geographical location choose carefully.

I knew that parking would cost 120, so I didn't park in the hotel.
One of the shortcomings: I have three suitcases, and I wanted to ask the concierge to deliver them to the room, but after checking in, I entered the room and waited for 20 minutes before they came up, so I had to go down and carry them up. Myself.
Insufficiency 2: On the day of check-out, the elevator was broken, so I didn't eat breakfast or lunch. I had important things in the afternoon, so I didn't eat anything in the afternoon, so I was hungry all day, so I ate dinner. Not very happy. 😩

The service is nothing to say. When you take a taxi to pick up your luggage, the doorman doesn't even look at it and won't help you carry it. He just sees you picking up your luggage and getting into the car. This is the last time I'll stay in this hotel. I was very impressed with this place in the past years.

msg:Before the epidemic, I lived in Jing'an Kunlun on business trips for two years. I don't know if it was the recent auto show that made your house full of guests or some other reason. This time, the attitude of the experience was extremely poor.
The elder brother at the front desk has a very bad attitude. He said that the membership level can be upgraded to a room type, and then said that there is no room. It made a big face, and the check-in experience was very poor.
The sanitation in the guest room is not up to standard, and the glass layer of the tea cup is full of dust.
In addition, the girl who answers the phone at your switchboard can't do customer service? What are you calling on the phone? You can order food in the middle of the night, and you can order it on the TV. First, they said that the wontons are gone, so let’s say soup dumplings. After waiting for 15-20 minutes, they said that the soup dumplings were gone. Why go early? up? If the kitchen can’t do it, please don’t ask customers to place an order. After ordering and waiting, there is no delivery. You have to order takeaway after a long time in the middle of the night. This is the service of a self-proclaimed five-star hotel, which is not as good as a chain express hotel.

Finally, when I was waiting for the car with my luggage at the gate, there was Jing'an Corridor next to the gate. My husband and I stood at the gate of Jing'an Corridor, put our backpacks on the chairs, and I was going to put the camera on my back into the bag and leave. A waitress came and said, sorry, this is a consumption area, mainly because we are still standing, but she insisted that we cannot sit. We explained that we would leave with something, but the woman continued to say, no, and pointed to a place farther away, saying that there is a place for free sitting.

Jing'an Kunlun understands customer experience and employee training, knows how to order dishes from people, and understands garbage service.
I will never come to live again, and even all the hotels in Jinjiang will never experience it again.
I hope you can learn from Marriott what service is.

Third, calling the hotel phone number is as cumbersome as calling the bank card service hotline. Press 1 first, then 0. It is understandable to choose Chinese and English, but you also have to choose check-in, order food or complain button, which is rare. Fourth, there were many people at the front desk when checking in, and no one guided the queue. I stood at the exit (later I judged it was the exit, because the entrance should be wider than the exit) and queued up. There was an empty window seat, and the ******* in supervisor uniform was very uncomfortable. He patiently told me to wait in line at another door. OK, I was stupid and moved to the other side. After a long time, the waiter at the window where I was waiting left. I asked the window next to me if the window where I was was still available. When I went through the process, the guy next to me told me that I couldn't do it. I waited for a while and was about to change the window. The person at the window came back to handle it. She had a good attitude, but she upgraded the noisy room for me. This hotel is really okay, I highly recommend it not to stay, it is old and has a weak sense of service.

msg:This is the hotel I've stayed in that I most want to stay in again. It surpasses hotels of the same level in China in all aspects. Although it has a sense of age, the maintenance is not bad at all. As soon as the car arrived at the gate, the service staff warmly helped with the luggage and delivered it to the room. The waiter who is responsible for cleaning every day is also very good, the clothes are neatly folded, the bed is tidy, including the water cups are changed every day (many five-star hotels do not have this service), the hotel has a good view and a good mood. In addition, let's talk about the hotel elevator, which is spacious and fast (faster than many of the same level, you don't have to wait for a long time). The details are well done. The gym is well equipped, and the aunt's hygiene is very good, and the disinfection is in place. I like it. The breakfast is very rich. I have lived for many days. Incredible.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the breakfast dishes were not cleaned carefully enough. One morning, I got two dishes that were not cleaned, one was stained with black things, and the other was stained with leftovers that were dried by the wind, which was a bit of a loss.

msg:Jing'an Kunlun is the first Hilton in China and the first five-star hotel in Shanghai. Many old Shanghainese have feelings for this hotel. After 30 years of management by IHG, it was handed over to Jinjiang Group, and it still maintains very well!

🅿️If you park, you can get a coupon, after the discount is 120 yuan a day.

The overall experience of the hotel is very good, and the location is also very good! It takes 10 minutes to walk to Jing'an Temple, Ruio Depar**ent Store, Jiuguang Depar**ent Store, etc., and feel the collision and fusion of modernity and tradition.

From check-in to lounge, dinner and breakfast, HK and other services are very considerate, and grandma and grandpa are very satisfied! When checking in, we arranged to be on the same floor as the old man. The catering service is humane and timely. HK will greet customers, which shows that the hotel management is in place.

I took a lot of photos for my grandma and grandpa in the lobby, and spent a happy 3-day National Day holiday. I will come again when I have the opportunity 😄.

The double bed in the deluxe room is clean, facing the Jing'an Temple and the elevated Yan'an Road, with an unobstructed view of the lights at night. The 699 package comes with two breakfasts, and the executive courtesy (afternoon tea and dinner) is completely enough to eat and drink. Although the requirements for check-in service are relatively high now, the business is skilled and the attitude is good, especially the communication in Shanghai dialect is very warm, so although there are many people, it is very orderly. Restaurant waiters are courteous. However, some old guests come to vacation in groups in groups. There are some cases where shouting is not elegant enough. It would be good to remind them appropriately. After all, five-star hotels hope that everyone can be self-disciplined. Like👍👍👍

msg:It's hard to stay at home after the heat wave for several days. I found this old-fashioned hotel with convenient transportation and direct access to Lines 2, 7, and 14. I decided to bring my parents to check in.
The lobby of the hotel is very grand, and every waiter who meets you will nod and say hello. The family room booked this time is very large. There are two separate rooms after one main door enters, and the privacy is also very good after each door is closed. The fan-shaped floor-to-ceiling windows have a wide field of vision, and the 2-meter large bed is enough for children to roll on it.
Because it is still in the stage of epidemic prevention and control, afternoon tea and light meals for dinner are in the form of set menus. The desserts and fruits are the staple food, although the amount is not large, but it is still exquisite, but the taste cannot be selected.
The breakfast is also selected according to the Chinese and Western packages. It would be better if the Chinese and Western styles can be combined.
A very good stay experience, will continue to choose Jing'an Kunlun in the future

It is very convenient to do nucleic acid. Turn right 20 meters when you go out, and remember to have a valid nucleic acid for 48 hours when you check into the hotel.
Because the epidemic buffet breakfast is currently divided into meals, there are Chinese food and Western food to choose from. Don't worry about not being full, it is definitely not enough.
The only shortcoming: next to room 25 is the elevator, the sound is relatively loud, which is slightly affected, and the time in the room is not long, and the frequency of elevator use at night is not so much.
Overall a good hotel.

msg:I always book hotels on Ctrip and never write reviews!
This time I must write down that the check-in experience was very poor! Only for hotels and has nothing to do with Ctrip (Ctrip customer service actively communicated later)
1): First of all, before placing the order, the hotel clearly stated that the room would be upgraded to a superior deluxe room, but when checking in, it was explained: The configurations of the superior deluxe room and the deluxe room are the same, and there is no difference. So, why are the prices of Kunlun Hotel different on the website? (Follow-up communication with Ctrip revealed that the hotel had deceived us and simply would not help us upgrade)
2): The hotel wanted me to stay alone with my two children, and we were quite tired when we arrived at the hotel at 3pm! They lied to us and told us that there was only one deluxe room left and it was on a lower floor. Do we agree? We said yes, but were shocked when we entered the room. The bed was broken, the room was deformed, and we couldn't move in at all. We immediately went downstairs and asked to change. The front desk staff repeatedly persuaded us to wait 3 hours to change rooms. This time I was determined to change. . Seeing how determined we were, the staff immediately said that there were other rooms. (This episode was also reported to Ctrip. Ctrip also said that it was the first time that it had encountered such an unreliable five-star hotel)
3) The room includes 2 breakfasts. I am raising two children alone. I asked about breakfast and it cost 231 yuan for an additional person. No discount available! The staff replied: This price is so that you don’t want to add breakfast, halo! The next day, the two children went downstairs to have breakfast by themselves. They went downstairs at 9 o'clock. Because there were too many people, they waited in line until 9:30 to eat. There was nothing left in the breakfast that ended at 10 o'clock.
4): I returned to the room after playing at around 9 pm that night. Because I had two children, I called the hotel to ask for an extra quilt, which was not delivered until 11:30! ! ! And it was only delivered after repeated calls and urging. This work efficiency is so unsatisfactory!

When we checked in at the hotel at 5 pm, the front desk actually asked us to go out for a walk and did not tell me what time we could check in. After checking in at 8 pm, we needed room service to give us a pair of slippers. , ended up waiting for 40 minutes, and called three times; leaving aside the long queue for breakfast the next day, how could a single variety be priced at more than 200.

The front desk treated the uncleaned rooms as if they had been cleaned and gave them to the guests. They did not give out the fruits that should be given. It is very unhygienic to serve fruits directly to guests without cleaning the room. There was more than half a queue for breakfast. This is the first time I encountered this in a five-star hotel. All in all an unpleasant stay.

The disadvantage is that the hotel is too old, the bathroom is too small, you have to stand in the bathtub to take a bath, and there is no disposable bathtub mat.

The capsule coffee machine in the room was broken and could not produce water. It may be due to excessive marketing by merchants that many elderly tourists come to the store in groups. When checking in, people will constantly come to jump in line, and there are no staff members coming to maintain order. In the lobby for afternoon tea and breakfast, many elderly people are noisy and occupy seats, resulting in a poor experience.

Advantages: 699 executive double room, the lounge is not open, the lobby bar has cakes in the afternoon tea, and the freshly cooked noodles 🍜 taste good.

The hotel is old, but it is well maintained. The TV is 50 inches, which should have been replaced recently. The temperature of the air conditioner is relatively suitable.

The pool was empty in the morning and the changing room and sauna were clean.

Disadvantages: Happy hour dishes are too few, two more hot dishes and more wine than afternoon tea.

The breakfast environment is very good, but there are almost no green leafy vegetables and grains.

Read the comments that there is a birthday cake or room upgrade, but the birthday on the day of check-in, there is no indication.

Recently, I have checked in several old hotels in Shanghai under Jin Jiang. The two in Hongqiao are obviously better than Kunlun in terms of service and catering.

In the evening, the time for the double sukiyaki pot and the happy hour were heavy. The staff It is recommended to eat Sukiyaki. The Sukiyaki on Ctrip has a sushi set in it, but the hotel does not actually have it. I asked the staff and said that Ctrip made a mistake, so I complained to Ctrip and changed the 899 set the next day. I only stayed and didn’t eat. On the third day, I checked out before two o’clock. My child was going to live online class from 2:30 to 5:00 in the afternoon. We sat in the lobby on the first floor, and other guests came when we went for an hour. Said to have a meeting and hoped that we would let us in, so we moved to the afternoon tea room next to it. The staff said that there would be no consumption and would not give up the seat. I said that I stayed for two nights. Can I still sit after checking out? Seeing that my attitude was tough, the staff acquiesced to me to sit. I sat there when there were a lot of vacancies. I praised Ctrip's customer service for being very good. As soon as I responded, the problem was solved immediately!

The disadvantage is that the catering is really very general, the category and selection of breakfast is a bit stingy, and the happy hour in the executive lounge is flawless. Perhaps in order to control costs, the hotel has cost accounting for food and beverages. The room vs price is absolutely value for money, the gym and swimming pool are not big, but the facilities and environment are enough for five stars. Oh yes, there are steps in the lobby and the safety is not very good. It is not friendly to the elderly because you have to go down the steps to the opposite smoking area to smoke. Of course, the security is still relatively friendly. In the end, I still fell and left the store. Fortunately, it is not a big problem. Of course, we as children should be closer to take care of the elderly, but the stairs will indeed be a small problem. Overall, the room is quite good value, the facilities are ok, but the food and the small risk of the stairs are a bit deductible. The overall price is still very high, and Ctrip's price is also quite good.

Go to the store to check the double code, check it very carefully, so you can live with peace of mind. . The attitude of the front desk is very good, and the processing is also very fast. The room is also very good, the cleaning aunt in the corridor will take the initiative to say hello.

msg:Kunlun Hotel is located near the prosperous Jing'an Temple. The hotel was formerly known as Hilton Hotel and was one of the most luxurious five-star hotels in the 1980s and 1990s. This time I was fortunate enough to stay at the renamed Kunlun Hotel on New Year’s Eve. The deluxe big bed room is located on the 28th floor of the hotel. You can see the Jing’an Temple, Jing’an Park, Shangri-La Hotel and other landmarks on the opposite side. The breakfast is very rich, and the buffet dinner has many varieties, and it tastes good. Next time you have the opportunity, you can choose to stay in Kunlun Hotel.

msg:Every time I go to a hotel in Shanghai, I like the surrounding environment of the hotel. Although the equipment is slowly obsolete, the basic services are still in place. It’s just that the hotel has started to regress after a few stays in recent times. For example, when I checked in this time, I asked the room service if there was any wine supply, but I said no. The wine glasses in the guest rooms are getting smaller and smaller (cheap). There is no corkscrew in the room. Is it possible to borrow? Answer: There is only one in this store, and cannot be borrowed. We send someone to open the wine every time. I really hope that I will continue to stay in your hotel, with more surprises and less disappoin**ents every time.

The hotel is old and there is a musty smell in the room. It is almost the same after changing two rooms in a row. It may be due to the oldness, so I can only accept it. The aging of the bathroom facilities is the facilities more than 10 years ago. The breakfast situation is not very satisfactory, not the quality of a five-star hotel. There are also good places to stay this time. 1. The quality of the concierge service is very good. Although it rains can help me take my luggage out of the car and guide me to the front desk to check in, 2. The front desk service is also very satisfied, check in and check out procedures It will be fast and worthy of praise, such a good location, if it is remodeled and renovated, I will stay here again in the future.

What I couldn't accept was that shortly after checking in, there was a strong smell of urine while lying on the bed. I asked the service center and they said there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Had to open the windows for ventilation.

After ventilating for several hours, there was still a smell of urine before going to bed. I don’t know if it’s on the carpet or in the bathroom. Finally, I couldn't bear it anymore and changed rooms.
I really can't accept that this is the level of hygiene in a five-star hotel.
I spent 719 yuan to stay in such a bad hotel.

msg:The breakfast was quite satisfactory. The location is in a high-end area of Shanghai. When it was originally the Hilton Hotel, it was a luxury hotel in the early period of Shanghai's reform and opening up. The parking lot charges 120 yuan for 24 hours, and the excess is 20 yuan per hour. Kunlun inherited Hilton’s legacy. Particularly dissatisfied with the executive lounge! The executive lounge was closed and changed to the lobby bar. The hotel’s reminder about executive courtesy only talked about afternoon tea and happy hour cocktail parties, but did not mention the time period for drinks that should be enjoyed during the stay. The waiters are very hardworking, indicating that there is a problem with the reception system.

Only the staff of their hotel can use that kind of opening method. Afternoon tea is set up in the lobby, just down the stairs, we need to wear masks to take the meal, I would like to ask, down the stairs, dozens of hundreds of meeting people, did the spit and crumbs enter your meal? The deluxe executive room even has to call for fruit before it will be delivered to your room. The only thing I was satisfied with was the luggage depar**ent, who rushed to call to help me send my luggage down the stairs in advance.

msg:After staying in so many hotels, I feel bad for the first time. I didn’t want to comment, but I really want to vent. The hotel itself is service first, but this hotel has never felt the service awareness of the service staff from the beginning of the check-in, and the smiles are more I don’t expect extravagantly. The room was adjusted due to the air-conditioning problem. Because the check-in time was relatively late, I hope it can be resolved as soon as possible. It took half an hour from coordination to room management. I told the hotel staff that I hope they can help move things. The person who came put the card After giving it to us, we just watched us go up the elevator with our big bags and small bags, and the whole process was indifferent, so I didn't find this kind of hotel, but I want to say that the hotel is only at the Samsung level. With this kind of decoration, this kind of service is not enough Know how long you can drive.

msg:I was spending the weekend with my children. I passed by them and saw that there should be a sightseeing elevator in the Jing'an Kunlun Hotel, so I wanted to stay. The front desk said that the sightseeing elevator was useless and the room was upgraded. I checked into room 3418. The facilities were aging and the windows were single-layer glass with poor sound insulation. , the wind was very loud at night, and the noisy people couldn't sleep. The air conditioner was not powerful. It was barely too cold, but the child caught a cold. The breakfast is too simple and similar to that of an ordinary business hotel. The air conditioning in the lobby restaurant does not seem to be turned on in the morning. When I left, I complained to the front desk and it was just a response. I was not told that I had to ask the bellman for a parking fee discount. I drove to the door and was stopped for a parking fee of 160 yuan. I vaguely remembered that the maximum parking fee was 120 yuan/day on the room card. After I told the door, I found out that I had to get the bill to pay 120 yuan! Anyway, I definitely won’t stay here next time, not even for free! The price/performance ratio is too bad! Now take your child to the children's hospital to see if he has a cold! !
🧹Hygiene: Average!

Let me ask the manager, I was shopping all day and was waiting for a takeaway in the lobby. I just sat on the single chair with my feet on the ground for a while. Do you have to blame me like some fucking God? **The day before yesterday, you saw a local Shanghai guest with his feet directly on the table and you didn't say anything. The next day, you saw someone eating takeaway in the lobby and you didn't say anything. What's the matter? I'm an out-of-town guest. Do I have to sit in your lobby like in military training? Do you have to keep reminding me that I can't eat takeaway in the lobby? Who are you looking down on? Really. God knows why that fat uncle is on the verge of a fight and even personal attack. I said to complain and he told me loudly to go and complain. It's ridiculous. I really admire you for doing this in a hotel lobby. You should go to the next door Home Inn, Four Seasons, Orange Crystal and learn from them. I won't be anonymous anymore. No matter whether the hotel takes this bad review seriously or not, we are just out-of-town customers. I'm just reminding other out-of-town friends who come to the hotel.

元ヒルトンの五つ星ホテルなのに、リーズナブルな料金が設定でコスパ抜群。
アメニティは歯ブラシ、スリッパ、シャンプー、コンディショナー、ボディーソープ、ボディーローション、バスタオルなど一通り揃っています。
6日間滞在しましたが、アメニティ類はもちろん、お水やコーヒーなどの補充もきちんとありました。
スタッフさんですが、受付の方には当たり外れがあります。中国語も英語もあまりできないとわかるとため息をつかれてしまいました。
ただ基本的にスタッフさんは良い方ばかりで、ロビーをキョロキョロしてると「お困りですか？」と声を掛けたりしてくれました。

酒店周邊是靜安寺商圈，購物休閑都很便利。
美中不足的是房間內的電梯噪音，即便幫我們安排更換了房間，仍能聽到電梯轟隆隆的聲音，好在噪音不大不影響睡眠。

大堂很大，前台、大堂吧、休息區、餐廳分區佈局的非常合理。前台設定了隔離繩，辦理入住可以在一個入口排隊等候，裏面分兩三個櫃枱辦理，避免了客人擁在一個櫃枱，秩序井然。休息區擺放了不少沙發，隨意坐，很人性。早餐非常豐盛。
客房雖有些老式風格，但乾淨整潔，設施完好。晚上回到房間，服務員已經開了夜床，燈光和電視都已打開，床頭櫃上放了一瓶礦泉水和一個蓋了紙蓋的杯子，被子折了角，這些不是靠自動化，而是靠人工的服務實現的，感覺非常温馨。衞生間是那種淋浴要站到浴缸裏的老式風格，但浴簾是雙層的，拉上以後一層在浴缸裏，一層在浴缸外，水不會濺出來，非常合理。這些細節，確實在管理上下了功夫。
最後，行政酒廊值得一坐，窗外的景色非常好，遠眺陸家嘴的現代化建築，很是舒服。

酒店的地理位置很好，出門就是三條地鐵交匯的靜安寺站，前台的Bobo,和Leon先生很熱情，給我們做了一個免費升級，給我們選了一個能看到靜安寺的高樓層房間，靜安寺晚上的夜景真的很漂亮。
下午帶着小朋友去行政酒廊喝下午茶，酒廊的沈經理和汪經理，很熱情地歡迎我們，給我們安排景色好的位置，給我們倒飲料。兩位經理也好喜歡小朋友，一直很耐心很細心地對我們家的小朋友，吃得很滿意，挺滿意的一次入住體驗。

酒店設施，不算新，花灑，枱燈一些設備都沒辦法固定，其他也還可以。唯一的不愉快就是酒店游泳池，有私人會員教游泳，佔了淺水區一半泳池，不讓其他孩子過去，尤其假日這種時候，小孩子又多，肯定會來回遊，誰都不開心，帶孩子的家庭不來也罷，建議酒店做好管理，得不償失。

酒店門口有門僮，在台階下面站着，正常理解這位應該是負責接待到訪酒店的客人的，但是在我們入住的這幾天，不管是我們自己到達酒店還是其他客人，這幾位輪班的門口服務生既不幫忙開門也不幫忙從車上拿行李，就算是這些都忍了，最過分的是，下大雨的天氣，酒店門口到車上有一塊沒有遮擋，門口服務生還是站在那裡一動不動，任由在他面前上車的客人被大雨淋濕，問他有沒有傘幫我們遮一下，他回答大堂有傘可以自己去借。那我們都去機場要走了難道這傘不用還嗎？舉手之勞都不做的酒店，不知道這種服務如何立足。

3.被子太差了 這麼冷的天 給客人那麼薄的被子 找前台要一層被子或者厚的被子 告訴我沒有 給我拿來毯子 毯子睡覺也不管用呀 
4.這麼冷的天 你們空調怎麼開都不暖和 太冷了
5.酒店早餐當天買228元 前一天買100元 我不知道當天買和前天買有啥區別嗎
6.可以試着提供免費的接機服務一次

入住的時候房間還沒有打掃好，在行政酒廊坐了一會，酒廊的劉先生一直幫我們催房，一直幫我們問房間有沒有打掃好。房間打掃好了後，汪經理親自幫我們把房卡送了上來，免我們再上下跑一趟。
印象最深刻的還是酒廊的沈經理，一直跑來跑去幫我們拿東西，實在是盛情難卻，好久沒有體驗過這麼熱情的服務了哈哈哈。

從酒店步行到靜安寺衹要十分鐘不到，而且距離武康路、長樂路、愚園路都很近，非常方便citywalk
剛進入酒店的時候就覺得大堂的氛圍不錯，前台的Emily和Karen非常熱情，服務周到細心，在聽完我們的要求後為我們安排了高樓層的房間，風景很好，在房間裏能夠俯瞰到靜安寺的夜景，正是我們所需要的。客房也寬敞舒適，設施齊全，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。此外，酒店還設有健身房、游泳池等設施，讓客人在休閑時能夠放鬆身心。
總的來説，上海靜安崑崙大酒店是一家服務一流的高端五星級酒店，很適合商務和休閑旅行。

房間，該有的都有但是設施非常老，躺床上老聞到一股味，沒忍住喊服務員上來噴了東西才有所緩解。隔音也不太好，窗外和樓上響聲明顯，住了兩晚每晚失眠到兩點。
健身房還可以東西比較舊但是還算全。。吧
如果不含早，早餐要200＋一位，吃的東西就。。五星級裏算中規中矩甚至偏差的。有一個燉牛肉拿完以後被換成了肉末豇豆。
綜上是不會再去的那種，這個價錢加一點可以住更好更新的。

服務：下車沒人幫忙拿行李，進大廳找不到前台，東張西望的時候跟服務員有目光交流都沒人問我有什麼需求的那種。但是孩子爬到行李架上就有服務員開始提醒注意安全，真是打是親罵是愛呢。

設施：裝修略有年代感，但維護還可以。特別喜歡這個套房的房型，卧房與客廳完全隔開互不幹擾，面積足夠大，景觀也足夠贊，關鍵是還有兩個完整的衞浴間，大愛！
衞生：衞浴間的潔具都潔白乾凈，床舒服乾淨
環境：房間隔音很好，雖然此房型靠近電梯間，但是卧室與電梯間中間隔了一個大洗手間，電梯夜晚停用，所以休息不受影響。
服務：套餐含有的行政酒廊下午茶 晚間茶，不想出門的人是可以解決用餐的，行政酒廊服務人員特別客氣。

服務是酒店標準服務，沒毛病，也看得出來管理培訓到位。
餐食，我訂的套餐，兩份早餐，有下午兩點至五點的下午茶，有五點半至八點的歡樂時光，有晚餐兩人壽喜鍋，都在行政酒廊，因為要準備材料等工作，下午一直泡在行政酒廊，下午茶，是各種點心和飲料，不限量，點心品種不算少也不算多，做得也精緻，有挑選餘地，飲料是常規的果汁，罐裝飲料，咖啡，茶等，服務人員足夠，也都禮貌周到，收拾也到位，歡樂時光的小食比下午茶豐富，除點心飲料外，還有沙拉等，可以吃飽的那種程度。晚餐壽喜鍋，先説量，兩個女孩食量不大的話能吃飽，一個生食蛋，可做拌食壽喜鍋調料，一小盅蒸蛋，一份沙拉，一份天婦羅炸蝦，兩個大蝦，各一份鰻魚飯，裏面有一塊烤鰻魚，各一份甜品，是一小塊精緻的蛋糕，一個壽喜鍋，除鍋裏的雜菜外，包括娃娃菜等，常規的那些，還有一份肥牛，品質也不錯，還有些小菜啥的，記不清了，因為急着上樓處理事情，沒怎麼吃，同伴姑娘吃了。再説早餐，品種豐富，品質服務都屬上乘，不細述了。
房間，衞生到位，洗手間很乾凈，床品整潔。
説下需改進的，個人觀點哦，衞生間如果浴簾不完全拉到位，就是不拉到最邊上，水會流到地面，很多，一大灘，要清理，可能是浴缸安裝傾斜角度問題，具體不知，也沒時間找酒店理論，因為很忙。第二，枕頭很軟很軟的那種，睡下去就不會起來，需要用手推擠到自己合適的程度，個人不是很適應，不知道其他人感受如何，第三，大堂外進門處地毯印象分基本沒有，看起來舊舊臟臟的，與酒店實際品質嚴重不符，很迷惑為何這樣，第四，有材料需打印，去了商務中心，這是整體最不好的印象，在二樓，沒有導引標識，找不到，然後幾次詢問找到了，周圍燈光昏暗，像是被遺忘的區域，又看不到人，進去，更是沒開燈，雜亂地桌椅，破電腦，桌椅都不乾淨，電腦還不能用，沒網，又不見一個人，喊了幾聲，也不見人，有點瘮人，然後看門口工作台有電腦開着，也不知能不能用，等了一會還是不見人，又喊了幾聲，請問有人嗎，空氣迴應沒人，管不了那麼多了，就坐下來先弄材料，桌椅同樣臟兮兮的，弄了一會，來人了，警惕地問我在幹嘛，我出示房卡，説要打印，一直等不到人，裏面電腦用不了，就用這個了，對方説打印一張兩元，我説可以，
總體吧，吃住都是可以選擇的，當然有其他更好的，你們也可以推薦，因為要在附近辦事，攜程上選了這家
太忙，根本沒時間拍圖，不上圖了
哦，還有，我們房間視角很好，可以俯瞰靜安寺

禮賓部人太少，好多次都是自己拿行李，還有攜程給我的延遲住房、每次12點出頭，不是清潔工催就是打電話催，搞得好像我在佔便宜一樣？真的很不舒服。

先説缺點:第一，酒店房間設施其實比較老化了，我洗澡花灑都沒水出來，衹有浴缸水龍頭有水，懶得再打前台了。去4樓健身房解決了。第二，房間廁所沒有獨立的排氣開關，不知道哪裡排氣的。第三，辦理入住很久，我前面衹有一個人都排了10幾分鐘。第三，用餐地區太陽太刺眼了，自助餐拿回來椅子都是燙的。
優點:地理位置比較好，靜安寺商圈，幾分鐘。
酒店套餐比較好，早餐特別豐富美味，行政酒廊風景好，餐點品類比較好。大堂比較乾淨，奢華。
晚餐是那個壽喜火鍋套餐，味道一般。
健身設施比較好，泳池很乾凈，洗浴齊全。

msg:住酒店很少評價了，但是靜安崑崙這次體驗是真不錯。
首先服務到位，開車門幫忙拿行李一個不少，辦入住、退房效率都很高，看到有人排隊會主動過來新增窗口，開夜床的大姐也是很禮貌周到，管理團隊真的下功夫了
其次位置是真好，去靜安寺南京西路，或者巨長富還有五原路安福路都可以步行，離店的時候發現旁邊就是靜安寺地鐵站
最後設施也很完備，健身房器材蠻全的，大堂空間開闊
唯**ug是房間冷氣聲音比較大

衞生：乾淨整潔，房間裏有淡淡的清香，

服務：不愧是五星級酒店，從住宿到用餐，衹要需要幫助，總會有人及時迴應
站在房間裏就可以看到陸家嘴三件套，夜景特別美
是次不錯的體驗，推薦大家

msg:酒店結構為三角形，而且走廊極窄，房間內聞到從出風口傳來的煙味極強，尽管要求的是禁烟房，所以改變原來計畫，提前兩天離店。

msg:雖然是老五星，但是勝在環境，交通比較便利，尤其是在酒店房間即可看到靜安寺夜景，真的是非常適合旅遊出行的。畢竟是老五星，設施雖然略舊但還是在線的，服務也還不錯，價位適中，非常值得推薦。
