msg:After a long time, I stayed at a hotel in China where every staff member spoke English and accompanied me well. It was the first time for me to stay at a Swissotel but I know quite well the All Accor group. The check-in and check-out were fast; they even helped me with my luggage!
The room was quite hot due to Beijing's central heating policy, so Mr. Spring Si ensured I got a room where the temperature was 22℃, and I was immediately very comfortable.
The breakfast was excellent! 
Yes, it's a little pricey but I think it's quite worth it for the wonderful experience. I will stay again.

msg:Staff were quite helpful with the reception being manned 24/7. Hotel is conveniently located right next to the Line 2  Dongzhimen Entrance (unfortunately closed when we stayed due to ongoing maintenance).
Approximately a 25min walk to Sanlitun and a 17min car ride to the Forbidden City and surrounds including Tiananmen Square.

Rooms were well maintained with daily make up; maybe it was due to us checking in at midnight but we ran into some issues such as the bathroom door not working properly, maintenance crew were able to remedy it at 1am.
One of the rooms I booked didn’t get cleaned in time for our check in and we were able to change rooms the following morning with no additional charges.

Overall quality of the hotel is good, hotel breakfast is the best option considering food options nearby are nearly 1km away (******* takeaway is possible too).
On the morning of checkout, we checked out prior to breakfast being served and the hotel were kind enough to provide us takeaway breakfast to replace our breakfast tickets for the morning.

Overall 4.5/5

She was very thoughtful. Although we had never met, I could feel the attentiveness of the service. There were also various care and reminders from the hotel concierge on the day we went to the Forbidden City. It is worthy of being a Golden Key. The service concept is really in place; and the hotel coffee is particularly delicious☺️ From the geographical location (just at the entrance of Line 2) to the sanitary environment, there is nothing to say. Compared with rough luxury, I prefer simple and exquisite. The equally divided wood finishes on the walls of the room are really friendly to people with obsessive-compulsive disorder🤣She also said to bring a room card with her, but I forgot. I will bring it next time😊

However, the hotel service was very thoughtful. When Annie learned that it was inconvenient for me to go downstairs to pick up the food, she asked her colleagues to help me pick up the food and deliver it to the room. I was very touched!

msg:When I was working for a foreign company in the 1990s, Swissotel Hong Kong and Macau Center was one of the most luxurious foreign-owned hotels in Beijing at that time. At that time, I always chose the Wangfu Hotel and China World Hotel, and I had no chance to stay at Swissotel Hong Kong and Macau Center. Many years passed, and I went to Paris and Geneva to study and work. During this period, there were already dozens of five-star hotels in Beijing. In the spring of 2024, the general election of the board of directors of the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in China was held at the Swissotel, and I finally had the opportunity to stay at the Swissotel. After placing an order on Ctrip, I received a call from the hotel's Guest Service Manager - welcoming me in and upgrading my room. In Beijing at the end of March, the breath of spring is already very strong. Yellow jasmine flowers and green willow buds dot every corner of the city. The last time I came to Beijing was early winter. More than three months had passed in the blink of an eye, and my mood was completely different. It just so happens that the hotel's new renovation has been completed not long ago. There is no trace of 30 years ago. It is like a brand new hotel. The check-in procedure is very fast. The room is large and new, and there is a separate cloakroom. I have been cooperating with the Paris headquarters of the Accor Group, so I have a 10% discount on dining at Swissotel. There is a Swiss Mövenpick ice cream counter in the lobby and a huge clock in the bar. Everything is like being in Switzerland. The most surprising thing is the executive lounge. The Happy Hour every night has a rich selection of snacks, fruits, and various drinks. I made an appointment with a friend to dine and chat in the executive lounge from 5 pm to 9 pm. I was still not satisfied and wanted to sit in the lobby bar. The hotel's GSM greeted me very politely, and his English name was also very cute - Newman. He has worked hard in the Imperial Capital for more than ten years and is already the hotel's management. I thanked him and hoped to stay at Swissôtel again next time I come to Beijing.

msg:Choosing this place is a great blessing for a short holiday!

In fact, we didn't have to stay at the Swissotel, because we didn't plan to wander around and our residence was not far from here. However, during the short holiday when we didn't plan to travel, we wanted to experience the feeling of traveling. Staying in a hotel is a "project" that we all like. We searched for many hotels online. Compared with them, the Swissotel Hong Kong and Macau Center is the most cost-effective! The location is very good, less than 1 km away from Sanlitun, and the surrounding transportation is extremely convenient. The entrance of the hotel lobby is 20 meters away from the Dongsi****iao Bridge subway station. How convenient is it? The most important thing is that when other hotels are following the market and prices are generally rising, only the Swissotel is relatively righteous, and the price is almost the same as usual. It's less than 1,000 yuan including breakfast for two, which is really a great price in this area.

The overall service of the hotel is very good. After communicating by phone, you can check in a little earlier and check out two hours later, which is very humane. The weather in Beijing has been awkward recently. It's hot, it's really hot, it can reach 27° at noon, and it's cold. I just returned to the hotel at night and it was still quite cold with the wind from the hotel's central air conditioner. After we called the front desk, they took the initiative to send us a heater. The response speed was beyond imagination.
What I want to praise the most is the breakfast here. It is really great. It can be said that it is the best breakfast among all the five-star hotels I have stayed in. Of course, I am also sorry for my ignorance. I have stayed in fewer five-star hotels, but in my opinion, the breakfast of Swissotel is really first-class and impeccable! A combination of Chinese and Western, children and the elderly like it, I can't help but praise it!

To be honest, the room facilities are incomparable to the latest five-star hotels, but the service and other software are very good. The bathroom is separated into dry and wet areas, and the space is not large. Disposable toiletries do not need to be specifically requested, they have been placed in the bathroom, and they are truly super environmentally friendly! The toothbrush has a wooden handle, and the bag for toothpaste is a paper bag instead of a plastic bag. The amount is also very accurate, which is the amount of two meals, so there will be no waste.

Later, we went to the gym and swimming pool on the 3rd floor to take a look. Like the swimming pool! Although it is not big, the light is super good. Even on a short holiday, there are not many people and the environment is very good!

Recommend Swissotel! The king of comprehensive cost performance!

msg:Advantages 1. Good location, next to the Second Ring Road and close to the subway station. 2. Keep clean and tidy. 3. The breakfast is rich, combining Chinese and Western styles. There are various kinds of butter bread, noodles, steamed buns and porridge, and the coffee is delicious. 4. The bedding is very comfortable and supportive.
Disadvantages 1. The room is too small, and the bathroom cannot be turned around. The description is 30 square meters, so I am seriously doubtful. 2. When you go out from the main entrance of the hotel, you need to go around the back of the hotel before you can go out to the street.

I don’t know if it’s an advantage or a disadvantage: 1. The front desk clerk works seriously. When checking in, I asked if I could upgrade the room? Answer: "No, whatever is decided is what it is."

The breakfast has a rich variety, and the varieties are changed every day. The ingredients are very good, and you can see that all the efforts are made and not just a job. The location is right outside the gate, less than five meters away from the subway station. Take a taxi to the Tiananmen Forbidden City area, which is 5-6 kilometers away. The a**osphere of the hotel is also very good. The staff in the lobby, lobby bar, restaurant, guest rooms, and swimming pool all feel friendly. The only small suggestion I would like to make is that the spotlights in the room are not conducive to writing and reading, and the light from the chandelier above the small round table is very dazzling. Maybe because I have lived here for a long time, so I inevitably have to work and study. If you can replace the eye-protecting light bulb, it might be the icing on the cake. I hope to choose the Hong Kong-Macao Swiss Center again next time I come to Beijing!

However, although it is newly renovated, there is no peculiar smell. The room is also equipped with an air freshener. After a quick look, the room index does not exceed the standard. I live on the 13th floor. I didn’t expect that there is a small window that can be opened. The last time I came to Beijing, I stayed at the Beijing Hotel. There was no window in the room and it was almost too hot to die.🥵
The service is even more considerate. The hotel staff Mr. Ma contacted me the day before check-in, carefully inquired about various check-in needs, and handled them one by one. I actually didn’t know that this hotel was owned by AccorHotels. Mr. Ma might have contacted me through his mobile phone. The account found out that I was a member and took the initiative to help me accumulate points!
Regarding hotel dining:
The breakfast is relatively rich. After staying for two days, I found that the dishes have been slightly changed to give guests different choices. Thumbs up!
The executive lounge has fresh fruits and a full range of wine. My son said the chocolate cake is delicious!
Italian ice cream is sold in the lobby, and I also tried the strawberry flavor, which is no worse than Haagen-Dazs!
Now, because the subway downstairs is being renovated, the house price is quite reasonable. I wonder if the price will increase when the subway is opened. You can go and experience it first~

msg:I took my whole family to Beijing for five days in early winter. Swissotel made us feel like home. As a newly renovated hotel in 2023, everything from the lobby to the corridors to the interior of the room is brand new and provides a first-class living experience.
The hotel is located on the edge of the East Second Ring Road, and the location is quite good. The Dongshi****iao Subway Station of Metro Line 2 is right in front of the hotel. However, when we checked in, there was construction at the subway station. This subway station could not be used. We had to wait until It won't reopen until March next year, so currently you have to walk to Dongzhimen Subway Station or Chaoyangmen Subway Station to take the subway.

The only small flaw is that the bathroom in the room occasionally smells bad, but after research, it was found that it was coming from the wash basin, so remember to plug the plug when the wash basin is not in use, so that there will be no bad smell.

! In addition, the check-out time can be extended to 4 pm, which is very user-friendly. Next time I come to Beijing, I will definitely stay here!

We asked where we could have breakfast, and the front desk took the initiative to take me there. In addition, something was missed when checking out. The hotel actively cooperated to find it and took the initiative to express it back. I also found out afterward whether it was true or not. It was a very good stay experience.

msg:For a hotel rated based on good reviews, I can only say that the hotel lobby, size and breakfast meet luxury standards. The overall experience of staying in the hotel is that it is very impersonal.
1. The room is quite satisfactory, not as good as some well-known high-end hotels in China. Many hotels in China have free drinks in the small refrigerator. How much can you drink? Maybe none of them will be touched, but the Coke in the Swiss Hotel refrigerator starts at 28 yuan, and if you are used to other hotels, you will still have to pay if you are not careful.
2. Here comes the important point. Before turning on the shower in the bathroom, you have to listen to the whistle of the shower for one to two minutes before you can take a normal bath. Moreover, the shower is old and the water output is not very large.
3. Normally, bathroom non-slip mats are placed in a conspicuous place in the bathroom to prevent guests from slipping when they cannot find them while taking a bath. I called to inquire about the location and found out that they were placed in a hidden place under the sink outside the bathroom. They are the same color as the hair dryer bag. , you may not be able to detect it even if your eyesight is not good.
4. Normally, hotel bathrobes are hung in the closet. Guests can find them when they open the closet after taking a shower. They are placed on the partition above the closet. If a woman is not taller than 1.7 meters, she will look up and look for them. I really can’t find the experience of staying in a hotel before.
5. You have to ask to know how to use the air conditioner, and you still have to call again to help turn it on when you come back.
The overall experience of staying in the hotel is very inhumane. It is estimated that the management basically does not like the fireworks of the world. For people like us who need to do our own daily life, the experience of staying in other luxury or well-known high-end hotels is actually better.

I didn't take any photos of the room, but it's okay. It's a standard five-star hotel with decent facilities.
The location is very good, right on the second ring road. It is convenient to go everywhere. The service is also very good, and happy fruits are given as a gift.
The only drawback is that parking is not free. It costs more than 100 yuan per hour and night, which is a bit unfriendly to self-driving cars. This may be because there are very few self-driving cars in Beijing with foreign license plates. However, the price on the roadside is 6 yuan per night from 19:00 to 7:00 and 15 yuan per hour during the day. Just get up early and go out to play.

Manager Liu was very heart-warming and helped check the hotel surveillance and contacted the subway station to find the bag! Because the Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the birthday of the ***** calendar, Manager Liu helped apply for a birthday cake to be placed in the room!
On the last day of the trip, the child felt unwell. Nina helped arrange a lounge for the child to rest after he had already checked out!
This was a trip with frequent situations, but thanks to the meticulous and considerate attitude of Manager Liu and the hotel, even the small situations became warm!

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, just outside Exit C of Metro Line 2. Our family accompanied my old mother to visit Beijing. We booked 3 rooms and stayed for 7 nights. The overall feeling was very good. The check-in experience starts from the first day. Early in the morning, we met Wayne, the senior lobby butler. He helped us store our luggage, introduced the situation around the hotel, and very patiently explained the nearby food to my nephew. Finally, he personally took us to the road behind the hotel for recommendations. A breakfast place that allowed us to truly feel the warmth of old Beijing and the warmth of staying at a Swissotel.

Whenever I met Wayne in the next few days, he would take the initiative to ask us how we were living, and care about whether we had enough water to go out. He also suggested some travel routes, such as avoiding the crowds in Badaling and going to Mutianyu. As expected, it turned out that there were not many people and the trip went smoothly. Wayne is people-oriented to the extreme. I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad, and there are very few people who are as attentive and courteous as Wayne. When we finally left the hotel, they sent us all to the corner of the subway to say goodbye and watch us leave. I would like to sincerely thank Wayne and wish you all the best in your work!

In addition, other hotel staff are also very polite. The cleaning staff and breakfast staff all greeted me with smiles and said good morning. I went for a run in the gym on the first day. The facilities were okay. I was out for the next few days, and when I got back to the hotel, I was too tired to swim. On the first day, I saw a guest swimming and he was accompanied by a security officer, which was quite good. good. The last thing I want to say is the hotel's buffet. Although it changes slightly every day, there are not many choices overall. It is not a big problem relative to the overall stay experience, but it would be perfect if the hotel could increase it appropriately.

I highly recommend Swissôtel Hong Kong and Macau. The hardware is good, the rooms are neat, clean and luxurious, and the software is blessed by Wayne and other staff. I will definitely stay here next time I come to Beijing.

The hotel receives many foreign tourists, and the room is very quiet. Special praise should be given to the breakfast, which is very rich and delicious. There is a coffee bar and lounge downstairs in the hotel, where you can have a drink in the evening. Takeout cannot be delivered upstairs, but the hotel has a takeout cabinet, which is more convenient. The only drawback is that the hotel is a little difficult to find. Several taxi drivers missed the location. Every time I took a taxi back to the hotel, I couldn't find the front desk, so I had to walk a while.

After understanding my preferences in advance, Yang Jianjun, who received me, locked the room first to shorten the check-in time. Invoices are also prepared in advance to facilitate quick departure. These are very friendly to business travelers. Butler service is really valuable for a large hotel with such a number of rooms in the center of Hong Kong and Macau.

The transportation is very convenient. In Beijing, the subway entrance is the closest hotel to the hotel entrance. I saw the Poly Theater and the Dongshi****iao Bridge outside the window.
The room is small and exquisite. It's enough for one person to stay in. The bathroom is small and there is no bathtub. I was upgraded to an executive room for free. I wonder if the upgraded room can use the executive lounge.
The hotel breakfast is the highlight. Mini cups with freshly squeezed juice.

msg:The hotel is very good, especially the soundproofing. I am an insomniac and I am particularly afraid of not sleeping well when traveling. This hotel is amazing. Although it is only a double-pane single-chamber building, the soundproofing is excellent. There is no noise from the next door upstairs. The health condition is also very good. And the subway is zero distance away. I would like to mention two small issues for improvement: The comb in the first bathroom is a disposable wooden comb with many burrs, which poses a safety hazard. The second is the bathing area. Each bottle of toiletries is fixed, located high and very difficult to squeeze, which is not friendly to small people. Third, it is difficult to use the shampoo without lathering.

The subway station is just downstairs, and both the Workers' Stadium and Sanlitun are within walking distance. When booking a hotel on Ctrip, we requested check-out before 12 o'clock. Since it was a high-speed train at 3:30 pm, check-out would be too early. After explaining it to the front desk staff, they immediately extended the check-out to 2 pm, which is very user-friendly! The sanitation of the hotel is very good, and the breakfast is rich in variety!

There is an internet celebrity roast duck restaurant nearby that is worth a try. Secondly, the facilities are complete. I swam. Although the swimming pool is not big, the water quality is good. The room is simple and Western-style, and it would be better if it has a bathtub. The breakfast is relatively rich, with basically everything you need. The coffee and freshly squeezed juice are very good. However, after eating it for three mornings, I feel that it would be better to change the variety of Western bread. All in all it is still highly recommended.

There is a wall across the lobby from the Dongsi****iao C subway exit, which is very convenient. There are escalators to go up, but no escalators to go down. I played outside during the day, so I didn't use the hotel's facilities much. To go to the Mutianyu Great Wall, I used the Mubus next to the hotel. It was also very convenient. I got off at the opposite Poly Hotel.

The buffet breakfast is quite satisfactory, nothing special, and the dinner buffet has steak and roast duck pancakes.
The room facilities are not flattering. I have seen a 5⭐ room without a single sofa and a back chair. The bathroom door does not have a damper to affect the attention of other personnel. The floor drain of the shower room was blocked twice, and the water flowed into the toilet next door. !

It was just renovated in March this year. The overall layout is very reasonable, the decoration style is also simple and elegant, the bedding is very comfortable, and the equipment is plant-like, which my husband and I like.
The service team is very good, especially Mr. Peng Qing who is in charge of check-in, who enthusiastically helped us adjust the room.
The location of this hotel is quite superior. The downstairs is Metro Line 2, opposite is the Poly Theater, and it is very close to Sanlitun Tiananmen Square, and there are many rooms. It is very suitable for friends who come to Beijing for business trips.

You can see the hotel when you look up at the Dongsi****iao exit of Line 2. There is a small door, which is easy to enter and exit. The front desk gave a free upgrade. The room is spacious and well-equipped. The welcome chocolate nuts and fruits soothed the tired body and mind after returning from Universal. The breakfast is rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western, satisfying your taste buds.
Especially, I would like to thank the brothers and sisters at the front desk and the manager, because my baby will have an online test the next day, and I couldn't find a place to print the test paper that night, so I was very enthusiastic to help solve it. The manager said: "Kids' learning comes first!"
It has been recommended to friends who are going to Beijing in the summer, and I will choose it next time!

To be honest, there is no such thing as convenient transportation, but I told the manager that I drank muddy water for 3 days. On the 4th night, I was going to take a bath and put the water in the bathtub. Only then did I find that the water was yellow. The manager's trea**ent was just to let me Take a shower in another room. But I have been drinking muddy water for 3 days and I will check out tomorrow, so it doesn't make much sense to change the room. I filtered it with a towel and it was all yellow. The hotel didn't give me any feedback on how to deal with it, just sorry and changed the room. To be honest, I am very dissatisfied with the trea**ent.

msg:First, I have lived in five-star hotels all over the country, and the service is not one of the worst. First of all, the hallway smells like new decoration. Second, the attitude of the front desk is very bad. I booked a room for two days in a row, and the room card Actually, I only did it for one day. When I went to the front desk to swipe my room card, they would only make excuses for themselves. As soon as the takeaway arrived at the concierge, I asked my child to go downstairs to pick it up for 20 minutes. They only told the child to put it in the takeaway cabinet, and finally found it at the concierge. They were not responsible at all, and the lobby staff probably didn’t do any training. It stands to reason that I should be upgraded. I didn't enjoy the trea**ent I should have at all. The tone of the front desk is aggressive, which is not worthy of the service standard of a five-star hotel.

msg:Hygiene: the room is very clean
Facilities: Refurbished equipment is quite new, but the TV cannot be connected to the Internet
Service: When I checked in at the front desk, the efficiency of the front desk staff was very slow. I made a 3229¥ guarantee-free Ctrip order, and the front desk charged me 4300¥ (of which 1000¥ was the deposit, which means that 3300¥ was the room price). When I checked in, I was weak and ignored it. I went downstairs the next day and asked about the abnormal price of the order. The front desk of the hotel told me that it would be rounded up when I received it, and that Ctrip would prevail in the end. As a result, when I checked out on the last day, the front desk said that the final charge for the order was 3300¥, and the price was changed after I showed my Ctrip order. 🙂 When my friend was coming to live with me on the last day, the front desk also revealed the information of the last person who lived with me, which was very unprofessional. The service is down.

The lobby manager immediately sent a drink coupon in the lounge, which is very considerate, and he has been chatting with us all the time. Introduce nearby restaurants. The location of the hotel is very good. There is a subway station less than 50 meters away. It is the closest hotel to the subway that I have ever stayed in. The breakfast is also quite rich, but there are a lot of people in the summer, so you have to queue up and wait for arrangements.

Looking at the standard room booked by Ctrip's photos, I found that it was quite different after checking in, and there was no bathtub in the picture. Since the previous night was full of water, the front desk promised to upgrade to a deluxe room the next day. Only then did I find out that the newly upgraded room was the room in the picture when I booked. This routine is absolutely dead.

首先，感謝一下北京港澳中心瑞士酒店的工作人員弟三三，一早幫忙在b2層的貨車上找到了我丟失的iPhone！😭

之前選北京港澳中心瑞士酒店就是因為地理位置極佳，出門幾十米就近地鐵站，打車也能直接上2環，這一次國慶還發現附近美食資源豐富😁😁

酒店是最近完全的翻修好的，設施都很齊全也很新。掛念電梯很多，下樓不用排隊等🤩

從入駐到退房服務都很好，下次來還會選北京港澳中心瑞士酒店！推薦大家也來體驗下😃

地理位置：
酒店位於2號線東四十條c口，出站及酒店。來北京最擔心的就是交通問題，因為打車太堵實在不方便，不得不地鐵出行。
酒店環境：
非常非常安靜。行政套房13層以上根本沒有任何噪音，一覺睡到下午。
酒店服務：
周全貼心，主動詢問住客需求。感謝劉經理的安排，從入住水果到退房禮品，讓我和朋友感受到了北京的熱情。
以後去北京還是會選擇瑞士酒店。

首先交通便捷，在2⃣️號線東四十條的C出口，對於想地鐵出行的我們來説就是優秀！
其次，酒店是新開業的5⃣️星酒店，設施先進、環境優雅、房間面積較大！走進賓館就是淡雅的香氛。早餐也很非豐盛，特別是西式的餐食，麪包、奶酪香腸都非常喜歡💕
再説一下酒店的服務，入住前一天就開始管家服務了，問清喜好及特別要求，並且在入住的4⃣️天內貼心服務！非常感謝🙏
最後講一下希望改善的地方：門口禮賓人員可以跟進出的客人友好互動，幫忙拿一下行李什麼的，或者微笑的問候一聲！
總結：非要滿意👍下次再來北京依舊選擇瑞士

第一：
早上退房找前台要一瓶水，説沒有，那我説算了
於是看到旁邊門口迎賓處有礦泉水，找服務員詢問是否可以拿瓶水，然後迎賓説：“水是給酒店經理準備的，他需要詢問是否可以拿”

然後我們説，早上慌忙退房，房間裏水忘記拿了

他們才不情願給我們一瓶水，並且當我們麪，把礦泉水立即藏到桌子底下

第二：
我們車到了，門口負責行李的人，看到了我們車到了，馬上轉頭進酒店，還有一位看到了，停了一下，不給我們開車門，也不拿行李，裝傻馬上進酒店裡麪了

這樣的五星級酒店服務，下次不會再去了

唯一幾點不足：
1、雖然現在是暑假，天氣很熱，但游泳池的水有點太冷了。
2、洗手間裏沒有晾衣繩，掛勾也少得可憐。滴水的游泳衣連掛的地方也沒有。
