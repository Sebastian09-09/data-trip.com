The hygiene is good, the floor-to-ceiling windows have a great view, and it is very comfortable to make a cup of tea and look at the greenery outside the window in the morning. The staff are very enthusiastic. It's just that breakfast starts at 8 o'clock, which is a bit late, and the location is not so convenient. Although it's not far to go anywhere, you have to take a taxi.

The lobby and environment are really the best B&Bs I have stayed in recently
What surprised me most was his restaurant üç¥ Cantonese cuisine, a combination of Chinese and Western dishes, with good color, fragrance and taste.

But the breakfast is a bit basic, it can only be regarded as mediocre

msg:First of all, the location. Hotels near the West Lake during the May Day holiday are really out of reach. Although this hotel is not near the West Lake, it only takes about 15 minutes to ride to the Nanping Evening Bell. I personally think that the cost performance can make up for the lack of location.
Secondly, the environment. The hotel is on a small hill. It is very quiet overall and the greenery is very good. It is just a little small. It takes more than ten minutes to walk around. Then it is a bit difficult for people with bad legs to go up and down the stairs. Of course, it is a good exercise for young people, not very tiring.
Thirdly, the facilities. It is a pity that there is no swimming pool, but the hotel has put a lot of thought into the supplies, Dyson hair dryer, Kohler bathroom and smart toilet, Ferragamo toiletries, the bed is really very comfortable, and the towels are all new, soft and comfortable. The reason for choosing a new hotel is that the towels in many old hotels have not been changed for a long time, so hard.
I have written too much, so I will talk about the service and catering together. The service is impeccable. I will ask before cleaning. I also send a set of toothbrushes and slippers in seconds. I also sent a silk scarf when I checked out. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is very good, and the taste is top in the hotel restaurant. However, the breakfast was the most rudimentary of all the five-star hotels I have stayed in. There were no more than 20 kinds of food, including fruit drinks. I was shocked when I had breakfast on the first day. Fortunately, the dishes in the restaurant tasted good. The white porridge, fried dough sticks and noodles were all made with great care. The shrimp dumplings, chicken feet and spare ribs were also served at noon in the hotel restaurant. It was small but exquisite. Otherwise, I would lose a lot of points for the breakfast.

There are also two restaurants in the hotel. I will definitely come again next time I have the chance.

Unlike previous years, this year I did not choose to stay in the West Lake, but chose Xiangyizhuangyuan, which is located at the foot of Yuhuang Mountain. The hotel has a quiet environment and unique interior. There is also a rockery waterfall at the entrance, which is suitable for taking pictures. When checking in in the afternoon, the service staff thoughtfully upgraded our room for free, and there were welcome fruits and mini bar drinks. The temperature in Hangzhou was a bit high that day, but the room was very cool, and there was no need to turn on the air conditioner. The toiletries are complete and clean. I heard that they are Italian brands, which are quite skin-friendly. The breakfast variety is not much but the taste is good. The kitchen seems to be a local Internet celebrity Cantonese restaurant. I like black bean sauce chicken feet, steamed ribs and fried rice noodles the most. The dining environment is first-class, and you can see the mountain view outdoors. The hotel has a good transportation location, close to Fuxing Road Station on Metro Line 4, and is very close to Baguatian Ruins Park, Hupao Park, and Yuhuang Mountain. If you go to West Lake, you can walk if you are physically fit. There are many citywalk routes. If you take a car, there is No. 42, and it is less than 3 kilometers by taxi.

msg:The hair dryer has no socket for the first time, the guestbook has no pen, and there are hairs on the pajamas... It is true that there are not enough staff during the New Year, but the hygiene is not like this. Besides, the check-in price is doubled. Fortunately, there is on-site service. The attitude of the staff is commendable, the environment is very beautiful, the breakfast is very simple, and the dinner is a bit expensive, but the taste is still very good! It's not a holiday but it's still a good value for money.

msg:Hangzhou is the best value for money for business and independent travel. Staying for 3 days and 2 nights during the 2024 Spring Festival holiday has four intuitive features: 1. It is located in the central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHangzhou, adjacent to the West Lake, yet quiet in the bustle: it is about half an hour‚Äôs drive from many must-see places in Hangzhou, making it very convenient for business and travel; 2. Although the hotel is a large-scale high-end specialty B&B, it is managed in accordance with five-star hotel standards. The room supplies and equipment are relatively high-end, with floor heating and air conditioning, making it very comfortable even in winter; 3. Private butler service : The housekeeper is not only on call, but also provides tourists with various travel guides. He is a good private tour guide in Hangzhou; 4. Breakfast has both Chinese and Western tastes: the beef brisket noodles are very authentic and the tiramisu is comparable to a bakery. It is a must Like üëçI will visit again next time!

msg:Because we came to Hangzhou on a rainy day, we chose many hotels before and finally chose this one. The family booked two standard rooms with a courtyard. The space is quite large, and it looks great through the glass especially on rainy days. You can also drink tea in the courtyard and wait for the weather to clear. We drove here by ourselves. Before that, the hotel staff called us in advance and told us that the car could park directly at the entrance of the hotel. We thought it would be a very convenient route to the hotel. When you arrive at the hotel entrance, the hotel staff will come directly to pick you up under an umbrella. They will also prepare ginger tea and hot milk for youü•õ. The service is very good! The key point is that the breakfast is delicious. For a foodie, breakfast is very important. The staple food is delicious and there are various snacks. It is a great experience for a family to travel.

The highlight was the New Year calendar I didn't get when I went to Lingyin. The souvenir given to me by the hotel was this [yeah] this. An unexpected bonus, the new year should go smoothly. I made an appoin**ent to have dinner at a restaurant on my friend‚Äôs birthday. The decoration was very considerate. The food in the restaurant is also delicious and exquisite. The hotel environment is ridiculously beautiful when the light comes in in the afternoon.

msg:At the foot of Yuhuang Mountain, by the West Lake, there is a newly opened hotel, with a quiet environment in the middle of the bustle, and an antique charm. Climbing up the pavilions and pavilions, you can feel the fairy a**osphere, the chirping of birds, and the faint music and singing everywhere, creating a picture of a paradise. . This is a peaceful place amidst the hustle and bustle, which is especially relaxing. The butler-style service is very attentive, not too enthusiastic and embarrassing, and can make you feel warm at any time. The temperature is just right. The room is fully equipped, clean and tidy, and there are deck chairs in the yard. Take a nap in the sunshine and the swaying shadows of the trees, and instantly forget your worries and unhappiness. Get up early and take a deep breath in the back mountain to do the Baduanjin set, which is very refreshing. Turn right 100 meters after leaving the hotel and you can appreciate the ruins of the Southern Song Dynasty official kiln. It takes more than 20 minutes to ride to the West Lake. The location is great. If you really want to compare West Lake to Xizi, light makeup and heavy makeup are always suitable.

Once you enter, you will find a cave. It is built against the mountain. In addition to the guest rooms, there are actually two restaurants, one Cantonese and one Seafood hot pot; the Cantonese food I had in the evening was delicious; the hotel‚Äôs photos are very beautiful with beautiful light and shadow effects; the environment in the store is also very unique, the furniture in the room is also very stylish, and there is floor heating in the room, and the exclusive butler service is also very considerate ; There is also a welcome card that makes people feel at home. The breakfast at the hotel is very special and the dishes are very rich. It is a Cantonese-style morning tea breakfast. The shrimp dumplings are very tender and the porridge is also delicious. It is the first time I have experienced this kind of breakfast. Breakfast, the hotel is also very close to the West Lake, it is a good place for a business trip!
