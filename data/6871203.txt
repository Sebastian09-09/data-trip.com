First of all, the location is great, just 30mins to HK border, and they have a cross-border HK-SZ Bus nearby. 
The service is excellent, from the warm-welcoming from Nicole at the check-in, to Alex, who introduces us the room was so sweet and cheerful.
We dinned at two restaurants and restaurant manager Robin always remembers us and chat with us, even in the morning at breakfast, it felt like home!
My parents was in SZ and came visited, Rose and Bonnie arranged everything for us at the MO CLUB! Bravo!
The bed is comfortable and the room is stylish and very quiet. 
Kelly at the Spa was the sweetest. She always ask for our needs, suggested us some amazing treatments and at the end gave us a SPA Gift!
We are Fans of M.O.!

msg:Ok I got a lot to say about the Mandarin Oriental Shenzhen - a hotel with luxurious amenities but lacking basic breakfast provisions…

Dyson hair drier, toto washlet, glass bottled water are all under expected. MO shenzhen used very highend sanitary fitting brands, reliable and taken very good care of. I am very picky on sanitary fittings and cleanliness and I have not noticed any issues. Kudos to the housekeeping team.

One must understand what sets MO apart from other hotels is the impeccable attention to details. Its interior design is far superior to other Shenzhen hotels. If you are architecture fan and are tired of the substandard detailing in other Shenzhen hotels please do try MO shenzhen.

Now… the problem for me was with the breakfast. It occurred to me that MO focused way too much on cantonese food and was probably swayed by foreigner’s perception of what “oriental culture” consists of. Granted that the food was of high quality - good sauce good ingredients. But it is rly rly rly basic to provide rice. In every top hotels I visited around Asia, I never had to miss fried rice. It was very dissimilar experience in MO compared to Ritz carlton I stayed few weeks before - who probably had 3 times more variety of offerings. I wouldnt hesitate to pay extra if there was a better breakfast offering - as many would understand that this is just attitude issue.

The greatest hotel service in Asia. MO group is known for this and I cannot agree more. I knew of this ever since many years ago when I was in Guangzhou MO next to Taikoo.

Overall, as said earlier, MO shenzhen gave me mixed feelings. I am astounded by the cleanliness, detailing but I cannot hop on the MO Fan boat yet because of the breakfast. Aiya!

msg:Shenzhen Mandarin Oriental hotel, is an excellent luxury hotel in the city. The room was wonderful, large space with good scenic skyline views. The swimming pool was also wonderful with luxury design. However, one point that drag my rating for the service element is its customer service representative before my arrival. Before my arrival, I contacted Mandarin Oriental Shenzhen by phone multiple times to arrange and confirm celebration for Wedding Anniversary including room decorations and cake. However, much to my disappointment for this hotel in the field of luxury hotel, the customer representative’s attitude was poor, with an unwelcoming attitude. Even though the actual arrangement of room decorations and cake was satisfactory and up to my expectation. Quality training and supervision is required to train the customer service representative, because regardless of how the actual experience of the stay is, the first impression with the communication with the hotel prior arrival has led down the experience. Nonetheless, the overall hotel and the rooms are wonderful.

msg:Shenzhen is a business city, and its hotels are also very business-oriented. Comparing the three hotels, Mandarin Oriental, Raffles City, and Andstar, no hotel can have a luxurious feeling. Even the Mandarin I can only say that it has neither advantages nor disadvantages. Raffles City's exterior and breakfast are the best, as evidenced by pictures 3 and 4. The room facilities are clean, simple, business-friendly and comfortable. Oriental Mandarin is the best. Andersa does not recommend going there. The boy serving in the lobby on the first floor will tell you indifferently that their hotel It's very noisy on three sides, so it's not recommended to stay. And there is no place to sit in the lobby, but there is one at the door. The 159-square-meter Raffles is more Chinese-style and retro, which I don’t like.

The overall visual effect is clean, comfortable, high-end and classy - this must be said Yes, because the room price is indeed the leading price among hotels in Shenzhen~~ Of course, the day we checked in was Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day, so the room price was higher than usual.

Overall: unforgettable.

The decoration style of the hotel still shows the unique charm of the brand and the sense of elegance and sophistication. I chose a room with a view of 270°C. The view was amazing. The room tour given by the guy at the front desk was simple and clear, which is my personal preference. The breakfast food is fresh and the categories are ok. But this time there were too many dishes and I couldn't experience it in depth. I will come back next time I have a chance.

The service is quite considerate. Thanks to Neil Li at the front desk. He was really nice to me! It was so considerate and helpful to give me a twin room ww and Mason who helped me with my luggage. I’m very happy. Part of the joy of this trip to Shenzhen was given by you!
Something bad: only two bottles of water are given each time. In fact, I thought that I should have refilled the bottle the next day after I called to ask for it. The service should be more flexible! The quality of the breakfast is average, the restaurant is beautiful, but the Western pastry and Chinese breakfast are mediocre, the desserts are overcooked and hard and dry, and the chicken feet look like chicken feet that are not dead. Lianwu asked and said she was not prepared. In addition, the spa vouchers provided are as useless as the five-yuan Lamborghini coupons if the spa is reserved, but I am still very happy in MO!

The mountain view outside the window is wide and the view is more powerful than the new space of Mandarin Oriental in Guangzhou. The reception staff I met were all polite and polite. The management at the front desk was very gentle. Stayed for one night in an orderly manner. The welcome fruit is a big strawberry of super quality. It takes a few minutes to wipe out the light. Only water in the tea bar is free, which is enough for me. I only drink water from New Zealand. It is attentive and quiet for sleep. There is no problem in shading. The breakfast environment is very good. I really hope that the quality of eggs and milk can be improved. I only ate in East Bay and had a single set meal for three times. The only room introduction was not as simple as the Xiamen Waldorf Astoria. If you come there for the first time, you will be introduced to the brand culture, design highlights and art. After tasting the restaurant, I found out why they use bubble lights. The special bar makes staying in the spa more interesting. I experienced a basic massage and the impression was average. Overall, the quality of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel is trustworthy and a must-stay if you come to Shenzhen.

As soon as you enter the lobby, the running pool in the center of the lobby shows an oriental retro beauty. Special shout out to Natalie Yuan, Guest Relations Manager. Before we checked in, guest relations manager Natalie Yuan had already called us in advance to contact us about our check-in needs and when we would arrive. Very warm and caring. Including the problems we encountered during check-in, they were patiently and efficiently solved for us. Eve Xiao's attitude was very welcoming when checking in. He introduced us the hotel's facilities in great detail and patiently. Knowing that it was our first time to stay, they also helped us arrange a view from a high floor. The room size is quite large among five-star brand hotels in Shenzhen. There is a mountain next to the hotel, and the room is thoughtfully equipped with a telescope. The facilities in the entire room are very stylish, and the overall feeling is like coming home, very warm and comfortable. At check out Fleta Neil Chelsea Bonnie the staff were also great! Thanks again to these employees! Will definitely stay here again!

msg:Recently, the work pressure is very high, and the whole person is a little confused. This week coincides with 520. I haven't been together with my little sister for a while, so I will meet and relax. I specifically chose the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Shenzhen. Apart from being confident because I have lived in Mandarin in other cities, I also know that it has only been open for more than a year. If it is not just opened, some services may not be mature enough. The facilities are not aging, so it should be the most suitable time to go. Due to time constraints, it was almost two o'clock when we arrived in Shenzhen, and the place we had booked for dinner was about to close, so we quickly called and went to Dongwan. Dongwan has seen it on the Internet before, and it feels very good, but I didn’t choose Chaoshan cuisine because I wanted to eat it, but dim sum is also good. Originally, the restaurant also said that it would close before two o'clock, but I said that I was a guest who booked a room, and now I can't reserve a place everywhere. I was already nearby, and finally said that I could wait until two o'clock. After finally rushing over, a young lady greeted us at the door, and the service was very good. We were quite hungry, so we quickly ordered and the girls served the dishes very quickly. I ordered two dim sum sets, which are exquisite in appearance, rich in texture and rich in taste, and can feel the fusion between innovation and tradition, which is very good. But this evaluation is mainly about accommodation, so I won't post food pictures. After checking in, the little brother at the front desk led us upstairs and briefly introduced the facilities in the room. As expected of a new hotel, the equipment is very user-friendly, and technology is used everywhere, such as the tablet in the room, you can directly place an order for the service staff to deliver toothbrushes, paper towels and other things without calling downstairs, which is very convenient. The Bluetooth speaker in the room can be portable after being connected, and can be taken to the bathroom to listen to music and take a shower to go to the toilet. The little brother knew that my little sister and I came here for the spa, so he patiently waited for us to look left and right on the tablet and discuss, and then make an appoin**ent for us directly after making a selection, so that we can know immediately whether the reservation is confirmed, very considerate . The pillows we requested were quickly replaced as well. In terms of spa, we originally chose jade massage. When we went to the spa, the front desk staff carefully prepared tea and fruit for us. After understanding our physical condition and needs in detail, we carefully explained the advantages and disadvantages of different trea**ents. The result The little sister chose the electronic detoxification (it seems to be called this) course, and I continued to do jade massage. After clearing up the process of the whole trea**ent, the massage lady took us to visit the spa (the swimming pool floor is super high and beautiful! It’s a pity that I can’t swim without a swimsuit haha), and then went to the private room for us to clean the body and start the massage up. The entire service trea**ent process took about three hours from our arrival at the spa to the completion. The environment is relaxing, the service is considerate and appropriate, and it is a very comfortable massage experience. When I went out at night, I heard that someone was holding a wedding banquet in the banquet hall. It was very lively, and it felt very grand, great! After shopping around outside, I came back to MO bar, the price is a bit expensive. I am a person who must drink with something to eat. I feel that the boneless chicken feet here are sour, sweet and slightly spicy. The crunchy snack is also very addictive. We each tried two glasses of cocktail. The taste is very unique. And the single words in the question can also bring out the essence of the wine itself, which is very good, and I feel that there is great potential here! The next morning, I went to the spa for steaming. The temperature in the spa on the 68th floor can't be too hot, but it's enough to make people relax. The lady at the front desk once again introduced how to use the facilities, and also prepared ice water and ice towels for us, which was very comfortable. This is a great and comfortable experience, and I will come again next time!

Check-in is very efficient, and the front desk gave us the benefits of upgrading the room type and late check-out, and gave welcome new products, fruits, and chocolates. The decoration of the entire hotel is luxurious and vibrant, the rooms are large, well-equipped with smart home, and you can enjoy the moving night view through the oversized floor-to-ceiling windows. During the stay, I experienced the desserts of the Mandarin Cake Shop and the wine list of the MO Bar, both of which are of an excellent level. The bar's cocktails from Russian bartenders are impressive. The breakfast is a full buffet, with a wide variety and fresh ingredients. In addition, Ctrip presented a 500 yuan spa coupon. This time, I experienced the body awakening and recovery after exercise. The physiotherapist's techniques and strength are very professional. It was a perfect stay. I will continue to choose Mandarin Oriental and recommend it to my friends.

msg:I am happy to share the Mandarin Oriental Shenzhen trip with you fans:

1: The hotel is located in the non-CBD area of ​​Futian, and the transportation facilities are relatively inconvenient;

2: The guest control equipment is extremely insensitive to press multiple times to respond, and there is no anti-slip trea**ent on the bathroom floor (pregnant women, the elderly, and children, please pay more attention to avoid falling when washing)

3: Do not choose a corner room, the sun is very hot in the sun, and the furniture and equipment in the room will evaporate a strong odor, guests with sensitive respiratory tract should try to avoid it

4: Please urge several times to collect your luggage, the concierge will be vacant occasionally, and when you choose to make a reservation, please confirm whether you are a VIP member of Shangfan Club. If you are not a hotel concierge, you will be informed that they will give priority to the VIP member business of your store , even if you are queuing up, please move forward and accept VIP business first;

5: Discriminate against Chinese nationals, give priority to check-in procedures for foreign tourists

6: Deceive the guests. When there is a need to complain, it is recommended that all guests record to protect their personal rights, because the management has different opinions and will change their handling results at any time and will not recognize the previous plan.

7: Stay away from MO Shenzhen and improve travel experience!

msg:On July 1st, I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Shenzhen, which is closely connected with Hong Kong. To me, it was quite meaningful, and the trip was still very pleasant. Every time we go to a city, we will go to the best hotel in that city, which has become a habit. And every time I go to a hotel, I will choose its executive room to feel the deepest cultural a**osphere of different hotels. The executive lounge can even be said to be the face of a hotel, the magnificent high-end a**osphere of Guangzhou, the warm service of the four seasons, the courtesy and warmth of Xiamen Conrad, the unique and friendly Chongqing Raffles InterContinental... too many experiences tell For me, the executive lounge should be the top service of the top luxury hotel. I have stayed in the Oriental Culture twice, Guangzhou is acceptable, and Shenzhen, as a hotel in 2022, still needs to work hard. It cannot be said that the service in the Oriental Oriental Executive Lounge is not good, but there is a lack of smiles. As a service staff, the first thing you should do is to be able to laugh. The quality of the lounge manager is still good, but the staff at the bottom need to be carefully trained, and the afternoon tea in the lounge does not match the status of the hotel. Mandarin Oriental, which claims to be at the top of the dessert list in the hotel industry, made me feel this time: But that's all. Please learn from hotels of the same level. As for the room service, I think it's pretty good. At least, the staff are very meticulous and have a good attitude. They're very nice. This is still appreciated. In addition to the lounge for breakfast, I also went to the breakfast "three meals" in the western food depar**ent. The overall service is good, especially the deputy manager Jennifer, who has a pleasant smile and a first-class sense of service attitude, which is trustworthy. But I still have to raise a shortcoming. I met a female employee at the fried egg position during breakfast on the morning of 7.2. I just thought that the eggs might be overcooked. I touched the egg with a shovel to signal, I want to say, although this kind of attitude is not good, but is it really suitable for this hotel? The new hotel has been open for a year, and the road is blocked and long. If you can’t realize the problems I just mentioned, you will retreat if you don’t advance. I hope that the Oriental Culture can grow well. When I come back next time, I will see a top luxury hotel proper attitude.

msg:There is a big gap with expectations, a Forbes five-star hotel. The world's tallest Mandarin Oriental Hotel, opened in 22 years, is very new. But it is very average, the hotel design is mediocre, the sky lobby is small, the room layout feels strange, patchwork, no bright spots, and the service is average. The mineral water in the room is underground spring water in New Zealand, but only two bottles are provided. It felt very out of class, so I ordered a few more bottles later. The spare part is Tiptico from France. The shower is next to the floor to ceiling windows. Mattresses and linens are very comfortable. The hotel pool is beautiful. The gym does a great job too. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, in the form of a full buffet. Variety is not very rich. Generally speaking, this Mandarin Oriental is very average, and the price/performance ratio is not high. It is much worse than the one in Wangfujing, Beijing. I feel that the fan in Wangfujing, Beijing is far behind the fans in Shenzhen in terms of service, design, and hardware. Behind him, he is much stronger than Shenzhen. The overall feeling of this fan is average.

Ten years ago, I learned from Guangzhou Mandarin Oriental what is the ultimate and the decoration materials are exquisite and advanced, and the imprint of Mandarin Oriental is deeply engraved in my mind. The decoration is quite luxurious, but it has fallen to the same level as InterContinental. It's a pity that the stone paving in the bathroom is also very flawed, and I'm really sorry for the luxury positioning;
2. The breakfast in the executive lounge is really simple. Although the taste of several dishes is very good, it feels like a fly in the oin**ent;

After check-in, the front desk helped us to the elevator in the hotel room. The moment we opened the door to the room, we felt that we were right. , We were given welcome fruits and a handwritten welcome letter from the hotel manager. The facilities are very new, and the room space is also very large. The bathtub surprised me the most. It is bigger than the bathtubs in all hotels in Shenzhen. Shower gel and shampoo are also available. It is also good that the environmentally friendly design is not a disposable bottle 👍~ The room is equipped with a cloakroom, which has a lot of space, and the design of the ironing rack that can be pulled out in the corner is also very good. The bedding is soft, delicate and comfortable. We also called for guest service a few times during our stay. We tried our best to satisfy everything we need. I like the hotel. The only thing I was not satisfied with this time was the check-in deposit at the front desk. After we checked out The deposit has not been returned to our account after 12 hours. When we checked in, the young lady at the front desk asked us if it was our first stay at this brand. After we answered yes, we enthusiastically asked us whether to consider increasing the price to upgrade to the executive package. Due to our trip this time We didn’t stay in the room for a long time, so we politely declined. When the deposit was collected after the first pass, the front desk made a low-level mistake. They changed the pre-sale amount of the deposit into a collection, and directly deducted 3,000 yuan from the account. Later, she After I found out, I didn't admit to us that I received the money by mistake due to an operation error, but told us that we needed to scan again, and the payment was just scanned... So it was equivalent to us paying the deposit twice, and reminded her to help We operated the refund operation. In fact, we can understand the work if we admit it generously. This will make us feel like we are at the mercy of others.

FOOD
There are many restaurants in the hotel, but I only tried 3 of them this time
In addition to champagne, red and white wine, the happy hour in the executive lounge at night also has 2 types of bartenders, which taste good. There is also a meal for each person in the evening, which is of a high standard. .

After entering the hotel, the concierge, the executive lounge, the restaurant and all the staff encountered on the road are very professional and friendly. I would like to thank Tracy and Lumi for their help and small gifts, which made my wife and I have an unforgettable anniversary. I hope that I can come to check in on my birthday this year, and I can upgrade to a suite to experience it 😁

The service is really nothing to say, top level. Much better experience than the Ritz Carlton. (Except for the self-drive check-in experience at the concierge, which will be described below)

The design of the hotel is very, very good, the decoration quality is excellent, the most intense experience is the moving lines, all the moving lines are very reasonable, it is like a textbook version of the moving lines.

After reading the reviews, the comments about the parking lot are not good. After this experience, it is indeed not very good. It is convenient to park in b2. However, there is no concierge at the door from the parking garage. The service personnel are on the opposite side of the road. When they saw it, we had already walked a long way with our luggage. The point is, after the parking elevator came out, there were steps and no ramps, so it was very difficult to carry luggage. inconvenient.

The most outstanding and professional experience I have had with a hotel is the "switchboard". It is the most excellent switchboard in all the hotels I have stayed in.
It can bring good mood and emotional transmission to the guests.
Every switchboard who answers the phone has a very professional attitude, enthusiasm, clear thinking, can understand the needs of customers in a timely manner, and fully convey them to any depar**ent.
This is beyond the reach of any hotel I have ever stayed in.
The switchboard is the most important depar**ent of a hotel, but it is difficult for most hotels to fully understand and fully dispatch the needs of guests, which is the level of the hotel management system.
The room depar**ent will also contact the guests in time according to the layout of the switchboard.
There will be no over-service or wrong-service content. It really means that the entire management system is very professional, and the training is excellent and in place.


The receptionist at the front desk is excellent, everyone is very nice, and has strong professional ability. I can rank among the top three at the front desk of all the hotels I have experienced. Diana who checked in was very enthusiastic. She knew that we were in a hurry and checked in very quickly. She was really considerate. We checked out room 6903 on 4/8. The guy who checked us out didn't have time to see the name tag because he was in a hurry. Also very professional. The front desk was understaffed, and it took a long time to wait at check-out, but the young man's explanation was very professional and helped us understand the situation of the hotel.

The rain shower in the bathroom is very good and strong. The rooms on the Eastern Front are still very good. The design is very comfortable, reasonable and stylish.
Room amenities are good.

The design of the breakfast room is very good, the pastry is good, the croissants are very delicious, the salad leaves are very dry, there is a little water at the bottom, and the salad tongs are not very convenient to use. I didn't eat Chinese food.

The hotel's Spanish restaurant Tapas77 is very good, with a very stylish design, and every dish is great. The steak and grilled shrimp are very, very delicious, and the service is also very good. It is highly recommended.

The location of the hotel is very good. There is a large shopping mall in Upper Town below. The shopping mall is very distinctive and has many choices of food.
You can go to the big park opposite by crossing the overpass. We didn't finish shopping for an hour. The environment is very good.

The overall experience is very good, and I will come again next time. I also have a new experience and li jie for Wenhua

1⃣️The 7th place on Ctrip, Shenzhen Mandarin Oriental Hotel, staying at Executive Intercity Suite 7003 6918 yuan/night
1. Scenery: The scenery is not bad, you can watch the light show at night, the room is equipped with a telescope 🔭 children like it very much
2. Facilities: The room decoration is simple, the hotel swimming pool is too small (Beijing Oriental swimming pool is also too small)
3. Catering: Dongwan Chinese Restaurant tastes very good. It should be the Chinese restaurant with the best Cantonese taste in Shenzhen.
4. Shopping: The hotel is adjacent to Shenzhen Shangcheng Shopping Center, and there are fewer brands in the shopping mall
5. It is suggested that the service attitude of the hotel is relatively good in Shenzhen, but there is still a big gap with Beijing Mandarin Oriental's warm service. Learn from Beijing partners
2⃣️Ctrip No. 1 J Hotel Shanghai Center
Stay in a volley double bed room at 5,400 yuan/night, 68 square meters
1. Scenery: The tallest hotel in China has the feeling of being in the clouds. The steel structure outside the room has a certain impact on the scenery.
2. Facilities: The hotel is very new since it opened in 21 years, and the decoration is very good. It feels more than the decoration of Rosewood Hong Kong.
3. Catering: Free afternoon tea is provided, the breakfast is exquisite, and the food in the Chinese restaurant tastes good
4. Shopping is close to Shanghai International Financial Center, convenient for shopping
5. Problem: The afternoon tea is crowded, some service staff are arrogant, and the toilet next to the afternoon tea is extremely dirty.
3⃣️Ctrip No. 4 Beijing Wangfujing Mandarin Oriental
Stay in Wenhua Room 85, 6654 yuan/night, 65 square meters. Check-in experience
1. Scenery: The guest room can see the roof of Tiananmen Gate Tower. When the sun shines on the roof, you will be deeply touched by the light of the Forbidden City.
2. Facilities: The hotel opened in 2019, with good room facilities and new decoration. The swimming pool is relatively closed, and the massage techniques of the spa can be improved.
3. Service: The quality is very high, all service staff are very friendly, and the quality of the hotel's consumables is also very good.
4 Catering: Chinese restaurant and Italian restaurant taste good AA breakfast
The food served is of very high quality.
5. Attractions and shopping: It takes about 30 minutes to walk 16 kilometers to Tiananmen Square, and you need to check your ID card to enter the Tiananmen Square area. The hotel is in Wangfu Central, very convenient for shopping, there is a ski brand Bogner store
6. Suggestion: It is recommended to stay in the balcony room of the hotel. I saw the balcony room No. 10. The room does not have a view, but the terrace feels good, and it feels very comfortable to be outside.
4⃣️ 1. Bulgari Hotel Shanghai ranked fifth on Ctrip
Stay in Superior Bund View Suite Room 4103, RMB 10,261/night and Selected Bund View Room, Room 4201, RMB 7,345/night
1. Scenery: Bagley Hotel is located very well near the Bund. The room can see the scenery of the Bund. It is the best scenery among the hotels I have stayed in so far. You can have a panoramic view of the Bund in Shanghai.
2. Facilities: The hotel opened in 18 years, and the decoration is relatively old. The bathrooms of the two rooms have a little smell of sewer pipes.
3. Catering, Baolixuan Chinese restaurant in the hotel, with a black pearl diamond, the taste is ordinary. Italian restaurant, the restaurant environment is good, and the products produced by the restaurant are also ordinary. The hotel's breakfast needs to be ordered, and it can also be delivered to the room, but the quality of the food is very poor, and the timely service rate is also low. After all, all guests need to order, and the service cannot be delivered. Seriously affect the quality of hotel services. The food and drink of this hotel is relatively poor. I hope to improve it and not let down the beauty of the hotel.
4. Problem: It is suggested to solve the problem of peculiar smell in the room and improve the quality of catering.
5⃣️The 8th place on Ctrip The Londoner Macau Hotel
Stay in suites 3466 and 3470 in Victoria, 9341 yuan per night. The room area is 75 square meters.
1. Facilities: The luxurious decoration surpasses Shanghai J Hotel and Hong Kong Rosewood. 2 Service: The service of this hotel surpasses all the hotels I have stayed in before. The communication before arriving at the store, the preparation of the children's favorite fruits, the commercial vehicle pick-up and drop-off to help with restaurant reservations, the care is meticulous and very warm.
3. Catering: Breakfast time: 7-13:00, the quality and taste of breakfast is the best among all the hotels I have stayed in, none of them!. The quality and taste of small dried abalone served for breakfast has reached the level of Michelin restaurants. Among them, shredded radish crisps, fish maw soup, and radish cakes are all delicious.
4. Shopping: The Londoner, Parisian, and Venetian shopping malls are connected together, and all major brands are readily available, so there is basically no need to wait in line. Big Ben, the Palace of Wes**inster, and the Eiffel Tower that leap into view from the window of the shopping mall have gone to London and Paris in a trance. Children had a great time in the newly opened supernatural space, and the play experience far surpassed the indifferent Hong Kong Disneyland.
5. Disadvantages: The hotel basically has no view, the swimming pool water is not constant temperature, swimming in Macau in March is still cold.
6⃣️Ctrip No. 9 Chengdu Temple House
Stay in a luxury suite 5655 yuan / night (110 square meters) 90 square meters studio 3554 yuan / night
Scenery: The balcony of the luxury suite is very large. From the balcony, you can see the roof of the old building in Taikoo Li Shopping Center. You can enjoy the casual and lazy vacation time. Take your children for a walk in this rainy town. This hotel is a long-term vacation stay Excellent choice. The hotel’s evaluation area is mixed. I think the main reason is the room type. If you book a suite with a view, the experience should be good, and the experience of other room types without a view will be greatly affected. A 90-square-meter room is much worse than a suite.
Facilities: The hotel opened in 2015. The facilities are older but well maintained. The hotel pool and gym are very good
Catering: The hotel has a Michelin-star vegetarian restaurant with good dishes and wine. (Recommendation: Andoroica white wine paired with vegetarian dishes)
Shopping: It is adjacent to Taikoo Li Shopping Center, with a complete range of products of various brands, basically no need to queue up, and the shopping experience is very good.

Stable, comfortable, comfortable and relaxing, the hotel service staff is very caring, and I feel as comfortable as coming home. Staying for two nights in a row is very pleasant. The software is in line with the hotel's star rating, but the surrounding area is a bit difficult to visit. There is only a small group of studios similar to the Creative Park or a small restaurant with a coffee bar. The scenery is very good, especially after getting up early, I was amazed to see the beautiful sunrise. The pictures and texts below are taken in kind.

Xiao Li at the front desk was very enthusiastic about upgrading the room and took me to the room to introduce it. The room is spacious and comfortable, with a good view, but the hot water temperature is not high and the hot water takes a long time. The temperature has just cooled down in the past two days. This hardware feels A little bit of a gap. There are not many surprises in the three-meal full-time restaurant on the 78th floor, and the breakfast is relatively ordinary.

msg:Bad service, extravagant charges
I don’t know how many people book luxury hotels just for reliable service, but this hotel charges the fees of a luxury hotel and provides unreliable services😭
1-Originally, this hotel was far away from the place where I was meeting, but I still chose it. When I arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock in the evening, I couldn't see the concierge. A group of drunk girls were chatting loudly in the lobby. After I looked around, there was no one. When I saw the check-in area, I got on the elevator. It said 78 Sky Lobby on the elevator. But when I got to the 77th floor, the door didn't open. I looked at the elevator and there was a button for the 2nd floor hotel lobby, so I pressed it again. On the 2nd floor, I felt dizzy. When I arrived at the 2nd floor, I opened the elevator and saw that the 2nd floor was where I just came from. I had no choice but to go to the concierge desk at the door to call someone. A concierge came out and I asked him where the lobby was. She said it was on the 78th floor but I had to take the innermost elevator😭😭😭 dragging my tired body up and down more than 200 floors😭
2-There are strange noises in the room, and there is always a knocking on the door. I don’t know if it is a pipe or something? What’s even more interesting is that after I turned off the main switch, there was a red light on the desk that was always on. I was too tired to care about it. When I woke up in the morning, I saw a bottle of red water with a desk light on it😭
3-There are very few breakfast categories, especially Chinese food. Is it difficult for all your customers to eat Western food? Can you respect the Chinese stomach?
4-The most annoying thing is the service at the front desk. I picked up a ** power bank at the meeting place. When I checked out, a male waiter next to me saw the power bank in my hand and immediately said enthusiastically, I will return it to you. Well, I was very happy at the time 😊 I finally enjoyed the service, but a second later, the girl who checked out said that I couldn't return it because it was not from the hotel. I said I would go to the airport right away. Can you help me return it? ...But the girl gave me some excuses...I didn't want to say a word, because this is not the quality that a luxury hotel service staff should have. At that time, I thought to myself, what if I were your boss?
Okay, let’s not talk anymore, I’m no longer a fan of Mandarin Oriental🙏

msg:On the day of my birthday on 1/31, I stayed at the Shenzhen Hotel with the ceiling, the highest Mandarin Oriental in the world, Shenzhen Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The basic room booked two weeks in advance can be directly upgraded to a premium room by 2 levels, and cakes, red wine, Mandarin Oriental pandas are provided, and balloons and flowers are carefully arranged in the room, which can be described as a perfect sense of ceremony.

The location of the hotel is not particularly superior, but there is a Shum Yip Upper Town nearby, so you can go shopping, buy, buy, eat, drink and have fun. There are Lianhuashan Park and Bijiashan Park to visit around. There is a shuttle bus downstairs from the shopping mall directly to Donggualing Subway Station. The fare is 1 yuan. Going to Gankeng Ancient Town has become more convenient.

The interior design of the room does not look so "Mandarin Oriental", but the elegant "Mandarin Oriental Blue" is still very good, the room is large in size, the bath products are all Diptyque, the Dyson hair dryer, and the drinking water in the room are also bottled. Day or night, the view from the 76th floor is still beautiful. The classic fan elements of Mandarin Oriental can be seen everywhere in the hotel from the lobby to the guest rooms, from the fans in the lobby to the calendars in the rooms, room cards, ballpoint pens, and blankets on the bed, all of which make fans more fascinated by the culture of Mandarin Oriental. The hotel turned down the bed very carefully, but according to the personal test legend, there is no benefit of putting a book on the stage and giving a bookmark, which is a bit regrettable.

The hotel has 8 restaurants. I originally wanted to eat Western food here at night, but it was a pity that I came back too late to eat dinner in the scenic spot, and I didn't have time to experience it. But the breakfast is definitely the most sumptuous I ate in Shenzhen in three days. There are freshly opened coconuts, flower maw seafood porridge, freshly ground soy milk fritters ➕ all kinds of Cantonese dim sum. It is not an exaggeration to say that the breakfast ceiling of a Chinese hotel.

The time of this trip was long. I stayed in three five-star hotels in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. They all encountered problems in the guest rooms. Even the newly opened Mandarin Oriental was unavoidable. However, Mandarin Oriental is Mandarin Oriental. When problems occur, they are the fastest to solve them. This is the best hotel, so I won’t write bad reviews for the hotel alone. In the end, the manager said that I can extend the check-out until 16:00 pm and get a free spa. However, I have bought the Foshan high-speed rail and I don’t plan to change the itinerary, so These benefits are no longer available.

Generally speaking, the hotel is still worth recommending to stay in, but the air conditioner in the lobby is too cold, and every time you pass by, it is cold. The Black Forest birthday cake sent by the hotel is invincible and delicious. It is sold at the Mandarin Bakery on the first floor. If you stay, remember Be sure to check in.

The hotel service is very good, the check-in introduction is very careful, and the check-in is arranged with tremella sweet soup, fruit chocolate candy 🍬 and a handwritten welcome card.
The hotel's breakfast is remarkable, with many varieties, such as lotus pomegranate among the fruits, and focaccia muffins among the bread. The ingredients are all complete, and the taste is really up to par. Maybe the semi-self-service order has been canceled due to the epidemic, but if you tell the kitchen that you want eggs Benedict, it will also be provided, but it becomes like a hidden menu.

In particular, I would like to say that the height and appearance of every sister and brother are very good, which is one with Wenhua Heaven and Man😀
The room is impeccable. Next time I want to book an executive room, I can see the sea. Of course, this time the room type has been upgraded by two levels, which makes me feel more relaxed. What I personally like very much is the entrance hall cabinet, which supports me to place the luggage I need without contact at the right time, which is unmatched by any other hotel.
The hotel's meals are impeccable, and my baby likes it very much. From the first day I checked in, I was told that I was very reluctant to leave, until I left yesterday, even with tears in my eyes.

Facilities: I like the minimalist and elegant style.
Hygiene: spotless.
Environment: The high-ceiling design of the restaurant and swimming pool is my favorite.
Service: First class, the baby said 1000 points.

Check in during the Spring Festival, the whole crystal chandelier in the lobby, map board, orange tree and other decorations complement each other. The elevator on the first floor goes up to the 78th floor to check in at the front desk, and the breakfast is also located in F78. The front desk was meticulous and courteous when checking in. The breakfast is remarkable, with a lot of Chinese style, mid-level pastries, fresh fruits, and average sweetness and maturity. There are porridge, noodles, and noodles, but they are nothing special. They are far from the morning tea outside. There are no fried vegetables, only vegetable salads, no eggs benedict, no omlete. The check-in room is facing the northwest direction. There is a large construction site downstairs. It is good to watch the light show at night. The room type is centered, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, double washbasins, the cloakroom is spacious, and the design is great. The sound insulation of the floor is acceptable, the bedding is acceptable, the quilt cover is not soft enough, the flipping sound is loud, the pillows are very good, and there are several pillows with different heights and different levels of support. The overall feeling is that among Chinese-style hotels, they seem to be inferior compared to Park Hyatt. Figure 2 and Figure 3 are Mandarin in Macau

msg:The location of the hotel is very convenient. Downstairs is Shum Yip Upper Town. It is very close to eating and shopping. The hotel is relatively new as a whole. The 30-meter-high swimming pool is also very good, as well as a jacuzzi and steam room. High-rise rooms can overlook the central city, and you can also see the light show during the Chinese New Year. It’s just that travel is a bit cumbersome. To get to the room, you have to go to the lobby (78th floor) first, then come out and transfer to another elevator to go down to the corresponding floor. When you go out, you also go to the lobby to transfer to the elevator.
The little brother who checked in was also very nice. He helped us upgrade the room, and also thoughtfully let us see the difference between different rooms, trying to let us live in the most satisfactory room type. In addition, I heard that we are on the plane at 8 o'clock in the evening to help us with the check-in In order to delay check-out until 16 o'clock, they also offered pink cartoon room cards to the children.
Dissatisfied: I received a call from a staff member (a girl) the day before check-in asking if I need anything? Is it possible to upgrade? A: No; is it possible to change the double bed? Answer No; is it possible to delay check-out until 16:00? The answer is no. Then you don't know what to call? On the day of check-out at around 3:00 pm, I received another call from this staff member? Asked whether to continue the stay. When I heard no reply, I emphasized again that I can’t check out until 16:00. I said that the staff had already done it for me to check out until 16:00 when I checked in. She also emphasized that she had to verify , It makes people feel very uncomfortable. If the late check-out is not done in advance, will the guests stay in the room? This kind of small matter can obviously be understood with a little more detail when handing over shifts. It does not meet the service level of a five-star hotel. I hope it can be improved.

msg:There are many legends about Mandarin Oriental, one of which is that as long as you have been there twice, the staff you have dealt with before can call the guests by name. At present, there is not enough money to go to the second time💰, and there is no way to verify it, but the service of Fan Hotel is beyond doubt. From the first door into the hotel, every staff member is courteous and well-trained. The gentleman in charge of check-in knows how to chat, understand the active a**osphere, and knew that it was my first time to check in. He led me up and introduced in detail how to use the room facilities. Regarding the various details of the room facilities, 20 pictures are not enough. Every time you open a drawer, open a door, and meet a corner, you will have a different discovery. The toothpaste is Marvis, the body lotion is diptyque, and the high-end fig fragrance, let's go! Let's go!

Breakfast is the most worth looking forward to. Thanks to Ctrip member points, one can be upgraded to double. The market price is worth 308 yuan~ high-altitude city view, rich breakfast varieties, high-value desserts, and some seen in other hotels Rare ingredients that are not available are enough to make a fat-reducing person's defense collapse.

msg:Facilities: As the world's tallest Mandarin Oriental hotel newly opened this year, it can be called the ceiling of the top luxury hotel in Shenzhen. The hotel as a whole is very new hardware and very online. The room is very large and has a wide field of vision. The whole Shenzhen is at a glance. The room comes standard with Dyson hair dryer, TWG tea bags, leather customized capsule coffee machine, Tiptik accessories, Bose Bluetooth audio, and automatic smart toilet. Every detail is perfect. Luxurious.

Hygiene: The hotel rooms and public areas are cleaned very cleanly, which can be said to be spotless, which shows the meticulousness of Mandarin Oriental.

Environment: The hotel is next to Lianhua Mountain, and downstairs is the Shum Yip Uptown Shopping Center. The environment can be said to be unique.

Service: Mandarin Oriental is like a low-key and noble gentleman who treats every guest gently and considerately. The first time I stayed at Mandarin Oriental, I was impressed by his service. I especially want to praise Even of the guest center. Before checking in, I carefully asked about the room layout and personalized needs. When I learned that it was a birthday celebration for children, I thoughtfully prepared a small cake, and also presented a panda commemorative doll and a children's exclusive room card. , The room was also decorated for honeymoon and presented with red wine. Every employee of the hotel is smiling and serving, from the doorman, security, front desk, restaurant service personnel, all make people feel warm and warm, and feel at home.

msg:This is a belated thank you letter. It’s my first time to experience staying in Shenzhen MO, and I’m looking forward to it very much. It was the peak period at that time, and many employees were sick and taking rest, but MO's services were not discounted at all. The day before check-in, I received a call from Miss Even to confirm room preferences, special requests and special holiday celebrations. When I checked in, the room had been decorated in advance, which was a pleasant surprise! Due to the epidemic, I did not go out to feel the festive a**osphere this Chris**as and chose to stay for a staycation. After entering the room, I saw Sisters Even and Sammy specially decorated the room with some small Chris**as decorations, and thoughtfully prepared some small gifts and special Chris**as desserts for the children. The children loved it! When checking in, Sister Hana at the front desk also gave the child a Lego bracelet, which made the child less bored while waiting, which was very considerate!

MO's service has always been impeccable, but it is worth mentioning that Shenzhen MO has a special service cabinet. If there are any supplementary needs in the guest room, they will be delivered to the room from this service cabinet without ringing the bell. If you are disturbed or need to go out to answer the door, this service is really great! ! ! And their room response is really fast! Like 👍🏻 Also, Shenzhen MO has an exclusive room key card for little fans. The children are very happy and bring their own room card to swipe the door. It is so cute and can be kept as a souvenir, especially kids friendly!

During our stay, we only experienced the swimming pool. The design is very special. I heard it has a height of 30 meters. However, the overall environment is dim and a little small. If there are more guests, it will be slightly crowded. I would also like to thank Coach Wang from the fitness center for patiently taking the children to a swimming lesson.

The breakfast is almost flawless. There is fresh coconut to drink, which is relatively rare (except in Sanya😂). The taste is generally good, but the variety of dishes is slightly less.

In addition, it would be better if the mini bar in the room is free 😂

Finally, thank you for helping me in the concierge depar**ent that day, but it was actually Gary from the sales depar**ent who carefully introduced the layout of the hotel rooms and fan check-in points to me one by one, nice talk.!

Shenzhen Futian Shum Yip Shangcheng is not a CBD in the narrow sense but it is also the most expensive apar**ent area in Shenzhen (controversial).

The room type of the premium room is about 76 square meters, and the basic facilities such as cloakroom, double washroom, bathtub and so on are all available. The finishing touch is that there is a porch cabinet at the door, and the waiter can put things in it for contactless service.

🧳Service: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
In every possible way!
Before check-in, you will call ahead to confirm the information. After check-in, the front desk staff will take you to the room and introduce each facility. In every corner of the hotel, as long as a staff member sees you, they will accompany you to the elevator and press the elevator.
.
☕️ Catering: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Be considerate!
🌙I booked the location of TAPAS77 Spanish restaurant for dinner and asked if I needed to celebrate the special day, so I got the handwritten card and coffee bean decoration as shown in Figure 3⃣️. After the meal, the chef will come out to ask how we are eating and send blessings.
☀️Breakfast is semi-self-service, with Cantonese dim sum, soup, noodles, porridge, and Western style. The conclusion is that the porridge is delicious, and the others are average!

Gym: Great! Equipment is new and complete!

I didn’t contact the hotel. I didn’t deserve the brand of Wenhua, and when I arrived at the hotel, I found that the gender on the welcome letter was wrong. This is so embarrassing. Such a big hotel does not do the pre-registration for guests, and even if they don't know the gender of the customer, they write a welcome letter. It's better not to write it. The concierge on the 2nd floor will take the initiative to say hello but will not take the initiative to lead the elevator to the 78th floor. The concierge who came out of the elevator on the 78th floor just said hello and would not take the initiative to guide the check-in or anything. The lady at the front desk was proficient in business and quickly made a brief introduction to the hotel facilities and simple room facilities on the way to the room, but did not introduce the hotel design, Wenhua brand, etc., which made people not want to explore the hotel. The breakfast on the second day was very rich at 0:00 and the self-catering food was rich. What is a little incomprehensible is that the knife, fork and chopsticks are directly placed on the table without a placemat? The taste is nothing special, it is the level of ordinary hotels, but the quality can only be said to be average, even if there are rotten leaves, it is also amazing. The characteristic is the coconut with the LOGO printed on it. Anyway, after the overall experience of the hotel, apart from the location, the service level is average among luxury hotels, except for the brand effect, which is a bit unworthy of the price.

msg:Dear friends of Mandarin Oriental, Shenzhen, here comes the comment Mr. Xu owes you for a long time!
First of all, thank you very much for your caring care over the past few months!
Next is the comment section!

Overall: Mandarin Oriental is located in the business district of Shum Yip Upper City. To be honest, this location is a bit desolate, and it is like a lonely king standing here. Fortunately, there is still a business district downstairs, and you can still eat, drink and play. In addition, because it is opened in 2022, it is really new!

Transportation: The transportation is generally convenient, you have to take a taxi or drive by yourself. Affected by the deep design problem, and the hotel is relatively new, I did encounter many small problems when taking a taxi. For example, the master does not know the road, or the positioning of the online car-hailing is wrong. So here are some tips for you.
If you are going to Wenhua, remember to tell the master to go up to the back of the second floor, many masters will go up, but generally you will think that you are going to Wuyin, and then let the master keep driving forward to become Wenhua.
If you start from Wenhua, you can often encounter taxis on the side of the road. Or take a few more steps and go down from the mall to the first floor, and there are many taxis lining up waiting for customers. If it is an online car-hailing, the special car usually knows Wenhua, and will drive up to the entrance of the lobby on the second floor by itself. But if it is an express train, I often encounter the master parked downstairs, and I have encountered it a few times. Therefore, if it is a big express car, it will be more convenient to locate it in the Porsche 4s store.
If you drive by yourself, you have to go to the entrance in front of the Wenhua entrance on the second floor and go to the parking lot. The hotel provides free parking. When you want to drive out, report the license plate number at the front desk. However, it is actually quite troublesome to have to complain about driving, because it is a little long to go down from the other side, but this is also a design problem and there is no way.

Check-in: The lobby of Wenhua is on the 78th floor. The lobby area is not large, but it is very comfortable inside. There are three counters on the left and right, and there should be no problem during peak hours. There is a restaurant on the same floor, and there is a small bar in the lounge? forgotten. After check-in, unlike many other high-rise hotels, Shenzhen Wenhua's rooms are to go down, not up, which is very interesting.

Room: I have been booking a deluxe king bed on Ctrip and then upgraded to a room type with a premium king bed for free, and I have also been upgraded to an executive suite. Therefore, the deluxe double room type cannot be evaluated. The area of reward and administrative facilities is similar. The only difference is the orientation. The executive can see the sea. It is also equipped with a telescope. Look at the safety of the opposite side, and during the day you can watch the helicopter land on the Greater China (I am really bored). Other room types will have the opportunity to experience and write for your reference in the future.

Facilities: The facilities outside the room are basically complete. The spa, swimming pool and gym are on the 68th floor. I have never experienced the spa. Steam, jacuzzi, both, not bad. The gym has not been used but visited, as training for daily travel is sufficient. In addition, Mobar is on the 79th floor, you can experience it, the scenery is good, and the wine is also good, but the epidemic may not be open now, and the above should not be open.
In the room, the Dyson hair dryer is not a novelty, nor is the Nespresso coffee machine. The bath set is from Tiptik. It smells like no fragrant fruit, but I always feel like it smells like coconut, but it's more comfortable with Guangzhou Mandarin's Oulong citrus. The most worthy of praise is the toothpaste. In the early days, I used terra toothpaste, which is actually very easy to use, but it is very easy to dry after opening. Later, it was replaced by Marvis, which was much better.

Service: There is nothing to say about service. If Wenhua is the second in the industry, it is estimated that whoever wants to be the first will have to weigh carefully. From the lobby on the second floor to the lobby of 78, the staff I encountered were very enthusiastic. The point is here. First of all, I praised Rachael at the front desk. She cared about me very much when she was still in office. I met her at check-in many times. Although she has left her job now, she is still very helpful when you have any questions. Next up is Shawn and Neil, old pals, and they've been together a lot. The other is the Guest Experience Center. This time, I celebrated my girlfriend's birthday this time. The communication in the early stage was very smooth. I especially praised Aggie and Even. I spent a lot of effort in setting up the celebration.

Service: Mandarin Oriental's personalized service is not fixed, it is really in place, as long as the demand is not excessive, it can basically satisfy you. There is also a night service, which will prepare slippers and adjust the lights in advance and wait for you to go back. The other is the locker, which is very user-friendly, there are many inconvenient situations, you can let the room service put it in the locker, and then go to get it.

Overall: Mandarin Oriental is my yyds, there are not many pictures, because it is too new, so just refer to the official pictures.

Unfortunately, due to the epidemic, the MO bar, swimming pool gym and SPA are not open, so there is no way to experience it.
The room uses a blackout roller blind with a hidden track, which is very good at shading. It's so good that I wonder why it's past eight o'clock and it's still not bright hahaha. The "three meals" breakfast is very rich, especially I like the bread bottom of eggs Benny, very Soft and soft, the fruits are also fresh and sweet in season.
A little suggestion:
The mini bar in the guest room is equipped with spicy peanuts, which doesn't seem to match. 🤔️
Bamboo and wood toothbrushes are environmentally friendly and unique, but they taste astringent 🤔️

The first is the arrangement of the hotel elevator. To get to the lobby, you have to take the elevator twice from the ba*****t, and you have to walk for a while outside. After checking in, you have to take the elevator to the check-in floor, which is very inconvenient.
Next is the hotel's breakfast. Not only is the place small, but the product is also unsatisfactory. Not only is there a pitiful lack of variety, but the quality is also very average.
Once again, the quality of the waiters is really mediocre, and there are cases where they mistakenly identify the room number and ring the wrong doorbell.
Finally, the management process is confusing. For example, when the parking fee was waived, I had already left my license plate number when I checked in, but when I drove out and called to report, I was asked to report my license plate number again.

msg:Before checking in, I saw many reviews complaining that the interior decoration of Shenzhen MO is the level of ordinary business hotels, so I didn't have great expectations for the room itself. That's why, as soon as he entered the room, he felt that MO was as low-key and connotative as the legend. What I love most is the corner of the dining table. The blue ink decorative painting on the gray brick wall is decorated with the pale yellow Phalaenopsis placed on the walnut table. The overall color scheme and layout truly interpret the East. Charm, elegant and chic without losing style.
As for service, it already has the standard of luxury hotel, warm and professional. Because I checked in with a lot of shopping bags that day, I would like to thank Brother Jason who helped with the luggage throughout the whole process.
The breakfast is semi-self-service, although the variety is not rich, but every kind of boutique. Ordered a Salmon Eggs Benedict and it tasted really good. The only regret is that I didn't have time to experience other meals in a hurry. I will try it next time.
Btw, even if my boyfriend called in the morning to explain that he needed birthday arrangements, he had already seen a little surprise from the hotel when he checked in after 4 pm. Really thank you MO for giving me a great birthday experience.

Called the hotel in advance to ask for the birthday arrangement and orientation. It was all arranged at the time of check-in, and a birthday cake and red wine were presented. From the start of the welcome, the service is excellent and responsive. In the evening, I went to MObar to have a drink with friends. The night view is very dazzling and the a**osphere is very relaxed. Breakfast is also very good, too many choices to tangle.
I didn't come up with any suggestions when I left the store, so let's nitpick here: you can have some chocolates or something else when you turn down the nightly turndown; guests of restaurants and bars in the hotel can have a little privilege with the room card, discounts or gifts are fine, that is, feel more happy...

msg:Dare to sell Shenzhen's "first high-priced" hotel room, it's really not possible without knowing it!

      The lobby is located on the 78th floor of the building, and the guest rooms are between the 69th and 77th floors. Looking out the window, the "world" is at your feet... What is the Lotus Peak, the Bijia Peak, etc., suitable for Internet celebrities to check in, it can be regarded as a "sacred tourist destination"

      The hotel is upscale and the service is very good.

       The first thing to be commended here is that the director of the front office, Wang Jiajun, helped me lead the way to the 78th floor from the 2nd floor. After checking in properly, and then specially escorting the children into the room, he introduced the use of various facilities in the room in detail, which fully reflects the professionalism. service level and attitude;

      Secondly, Xiao Dai, who "has not met" in the guest service center, has helped me to solve various personalized needs with enthusiasm and patience many times. I would like to express my deep gratitude here;

      Finally, I would like to thank the two beauties who brought the drawing boards and brushes to the children, as well as the staff of the swimming pool. They began to wear "life jackets" for the children, and provided necessary protection in the middle. …

      Ask questions! The main reason is that the hotel is too new, and the smell of the room decoration still has some, but it is not so pungent, which is generally acceptable... The water temperature of the bath is turned to the maximum, but it is still not hot enough... There is no food like Marriott and other hotels will deliver. Coupon or afternoon tea, a little regret...

       The Shum Yip Uptown shopping mall downstairs and the three major municipal parks that are strung together make the hotel very suitable for leisure travel and vacation...

The best thing is the breakfast. The buffet is the most worthwhile breakfast. The Cantonese-style breakfast is very authentic and tastes good. It can only be described as delicious.
Most of the fruits are imported, remember to visit the restaurant more, there are a lot of super positive things!
It's a pity that there are fewer things for children to play with

msg:Shenzhen finally has Mandarin Oriental!
Since it is MO, it must be evaluated with MO standards. To be honest, only the enthusiastic service of the service staff can make me feel that this is MO. In terms of hardware, I don’t think it can meet the MO standards.
Praise all the hotel staff I have encountered, from the doorman, concierge, front desk, restaurant, room service, etc. The staff service attitude and enthusiasm are absolutely top. Said to upgrade our room! Great!
To say it well is to say the problem. The standard of room decoration is slightly lower, laminate wood floors, light-colored wood veneer (or bamboo fiberboard) on the walls, Kohler (kallista) sanitary ware, overall modern decoration, and MO in my mind that has a colonial style The style of decoration is far apart (such as Guangzhou MO, the solid wood floor with herringbone, lefroy brooks sanitary ware...) Generally speaking, I think it is more like Marriott, Zhongzhou Marriott's sense of sight, but can't feel the taste of MO...
I ordered a parent-child package. I told the hotel that I had a birthday. I sent a birthday card, a small panda cake, a tent, a small wooden horse, children's mopping bathrobes and toiletries. I heard my wife say this baby care Supplies are still big names, praise for this small detail. But these are all included in the package. Except for the room upgrade, I didn't see any special birthday arrangements... When I went to Andaz to celebrate my wife's birthday before, I also had some helium balloons. I put aluminum foil balloons on the wall and gave a pound small Something like a cake...
Toiletries are nailed to the wall, the feeling of a fast business hotel, although it is environmentally friendly, but how advanced things are used, I feel that it is not advanced, and there is no sense of ceremony. And can't take it home as a souvenir...
There are also 3,000 yuan a night rooms, and the minibar is actually charged. Andaz, Park Hyatt, Raffles, these recently opened hotels that are cheaper than MO, which one is not free for the minibar? Even if I drink up and take away your minibar, it will only cost a hundred dollars, so I won't make a bad reputation for this little thing. Put the MO special cocktail that costs 100 yuan for a small bottle in your minibar, and the free Shenzhen Andaz special IPA and Asian Sars in the Andaz refrigerator. The MO management team can guess which one is better for customers. ? I'm sorry, I just like to pick up wool~
The breakfast is not bad. It's a semi-buffet. There are many choices in the a la carte menu. There are two kinds of eggs Benedict.
I couldn't experience other facilities because I brought a baby. Generally speaking, I like the service and hotel staff, but I don't think the hotel hardware is up to standard. If it weren't for the warm service of the service staff, I would have given a worse evaluation... Properly letting the guests shave their wool will bring you more tap water. After all, the price is already so high, what should be given to the guests is still given.

The check-in location is in the lobby on the 78th floor, and there will be a long corridor from the hotel gate to. The swimming pool is not too big but it is amazing. It feels more stylish than the standard swimming pool of the average five-star hotel. Also recommended

🔔Service: The whole service is in place. Although there are not many guests staying in the hotel, there are a lot of people in each depar**ent, which shows how much the hotel attaches importance to service. I heard that there are 8 restaurants in the hotel. It is recommended to go to the full-time restaurant on the 78th floor. There are Chinese and Western food scattered points, and the ingredients are top-notch.

🚗 Traffic: The only thing I complain about is the traffic. It takes half an hour to go to the meeting, mainly because the positioning is not accurate. All Didi drivers are located in the downstairs parking lot, and the hotel gate is on the bridge, so the driver has never been able to find anyone.

The indoor heated swimming pool with a 30-meter-high dome is really eye-catching. Before the staff of the SPA center arrived early in the morning, they rushed in and packed a room.

msg:Since the opening of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I have been paying attention. I booked the Mandarin Oriental Hotel on my birthday, and gave myself a meaningful birthday. I communicated with the hotel in advance, and Ctrip also booked because of me. In the future, someone will confirm the order with me immediately, and the overall feeling is very good!

🚗 Transportation: Because I live in Shenzhen, the transportation is very convenient. The shopping mall in the upper city of Shum Yip is very easy to browse, and there are many tall and high-end shops nearby, so the hotel is located in a very central area.

🍃Environment: Needless to say, the hardware environment is really good. The room is equipped with New Zealand one pure pure water, and the birthday arrangement prepared for me: champagne, birthday cake, balloons ~ very caring!
The bathing tips in the hotel, Dyson hair dryers, etc... and the size of the rooms are very in line with the position of Shenzhen's current luxury hotel ranking first!
The overall appearance of the hotel is also very beautiful. From the hotel to the gym, there is a sign of I'm a fan on the next building, which is really very a**ospheric!

🧹Sanitation: The hotel is very new, so basically the facilities and rooms are very clean. I like the gym and swimming pool very much, especially with a sense of luxury.

🔔Service: In addition to these hardware conditions, I think the software service also makes me feel very deeply! From the front desk to the hotel staff, there is basically a constant greeting from the front desk to the hotel. When I check in, I will bring it to the room for introduction. When I leave, I will take my luggage and send it to the garage. Besides, because it is my birthday, it also gives me a lot of convenience and helps me keep it. Birthday cake, send the cake to the bar upstairs, etc., and the hotel's breakfast is also very rich, very delicious, and the service feels good no matter where it is!
It was a very satisfying stay.

#C hotel overlooking all CBD in Shenzhen
#beautiful sunset

Staycation in Shenzhen With the repeated epidemics, I have been trying the hotel industry in my favorite city. Having experienced the same level of service experience as Park Hyatt and Andaz, I would like to say that I truly understand the meaning of i am Fan.

The moment you stepped into the hotel, the concierge brother who took the initiative to greet you, polite greetings and full of spirit made you feel physically and mentally happy.
The design of the hotel's welcome lobby is not outstanding, but it can stand up to scrutiny. The large world map is integrated with the flowing water, and the wind chimes are turned into soft sounds with the wind, making the whole journey a good time. The lion dance fan, written by the most controversial designer recently, has cleverly found its own cultural label for this modern new city.

Although the design of the room is not outstanding, it is also meticulous and full of surprises. The particularly spacious bathroom space is equipped with Dyson's hair dryer, which I like, the bath accessories of Tiptik. Don't miss it if you love beauty. The bedding is also comfortable enough since it is newly opened. In addition, the welcome benefits are rich, and a special thank you to the housekeeping partners who arranged for us, so that my partner and I spent an unforgettable anniversary here.

During this stay, I deeply experienced the hotel and its affiliated restaurants. The breakfast is exquisite but not good enough. Master Hui from Dongwan is also good. Except for the cheap service of Lotus Gallery, all the staff are very professional. Literacy.

If you have the opportunity, I hope everyone can come and experience it once. I would like to call it the Shenzhen Hotel and the experience ceiling in the 4 MOs I have lived in!

Downstairs is a very distinctive commercial street, suitable for taking pictures.

The only downside this time is the newly opened hotel. Luxury hotels need to pay attention to the inspection and maintenance of hardware facilities.

msg:Words and pictures can no longer express my love for Shenzhen MO. When staying at Mandarin Oriental for the first time, I had to marvel at the hotel's control of details. The most gratifying thing is the enthusiasm, initiative and professionalism of the hotel staff. From entering the door to check-in, press the elevator, open and close the door and other details, and then lead to the front desk. After the check-in is completed, the front desk staff will also take you to the room to introduce and explain, and the experience is great. The facilities in the room are very complete. Due to the new decoration, the air purifier is standard in the room, followed by wireless charging, Boss audio, Dyson hair dryer, smart toilet, etc. are also full of grades. The exclusive double bed room is large enough, the furniture in the room is reasonable, the design is good, and the cloakroom is very spacious. What is more surprising is that the takeaway will help you go upstairs, and there are welcome gifts, including fruit, chocolate, sweet water, nuts, rich in variety, full of sincerity, and the drinking water is a New Zealand brand. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to every employee of the hotel. Your sincere service, enthusiastic and confident attitude, and employee happiness have completely touched me. I hope to continue to maintain it and look forward to the next encounter.

Because of my husband's birthday, I specially chose Mandarin Oriental, which has a better view and is relatively new. I communicated with the hotel before I booked the idea of helping my husband celebrate his birthday. The hotel said that they could help arrange the layout. The staff not only helped arrange cakes and red wine, but also upgraded my room for me! ! My husband said that he had a very meaningful birthday here. The whole process of the staff's attentive service made me and my husband very moved. My husband said that I will choose this place on the next anniversary.

msg:Great stay experience! From entering the downstairs gate, until check-in, there is very thoughtful service, even the staff who have only met once in the elevator can remember my surname, probably because the occupancy rate is still relatively low at the beginning of the business, and there are special staff for We introduce the layout of the room and various facilities, and takeaways can also be delivered by the concierge, which is very considerate

I stayed in a premium king-bed room, and the internal facilities were top-notch, so there was nothing wrong with it, and I focused on Samsung's TV and Dyson's hair dryer! The effect of watching TV shows is very refreshing, and the bedding is also very comfortable. The only downside is that the air conditioner in the room is not cold enough, and I even sweat a little when I sleep... According to the front desk, the room is only facing Tanglang Mountain and Luohu Lake. In the old city, the view of Futian CBD can only be seen from the executive room. It is recommended that you do not choose to face Tanglang Mountain. The scenery is relatively poor. The handsome guy at the front desk also suggested that we can try the lowest grade rooms. Some corner rooms are 270 glass for a better view

Afternoon tea is quite satisfactory, I personally don't think it's worth the price, the waiter is a little unskilled in business, and I have passed the introduction of dim sum hahahaha, and it stands a little too close to the diners, making people eat A bit oppressive, very nervous hahahahahaha, maybe it's my own psychological effect

Focus on the breakfast at the three-meal restaurant on the 78th floor! ! ! The presentation is the best of so many luxury chains I've stayed in, and it's delicious! ! ! ! It is strongly recommended that you choose a package that includes breakfast when booking, it is a great value! And the waiter at the three-meal restaurant is very good, with a good attitude and very professional, I really highly recommend it!

This hotel is afraid that guests will take advantage of the hotel; I only came here after reading good reviews online. I guess I have never stayed in such a bad place The five-star executive room; originally booked a luxury hotel, and later upgraded to an executive room in the hotel, with executive courtesy; first talk about its executive lounge, where people with executive courtesy can generally have afternoon tea and dinner here, here The environment is very general, there are very few food varieties, and the service is not good. It takes a long time to order something, and it is very stingy. Everything is delivered little by little, and even the paper towels are delivered in one piece. Besides, the choice of breakfast is basically the same. The buffet is a combination of Chinese and Western, and there are very few options. What you can eat is Chinese noodles and Western-style fried egg buns. Let’s talk about the room. I booked an executive double room, which is said to be 76 Fang, in fact, the size is not even comparable to Raffles’s 60 square meters. It seems to be a very narrow space. There is also a charge for drinks and snacks in the room. I have never tried to charge for administrative courtesy in a five-star hotel. This hotel It’s just stingy; finally let’s talk about the swimming pool. The environment is good, but it’s not practical, it’s very small, and the 3 lanes are not counted. At first, I said that I need to make an appoin**ent, but then I made an appoin**ent, but when there were many people swimming, I asked the waiter what to do thing? It’s not that reservations are made according to the number of people, but they also said that all hotel guests can swim, so I’m puzzled, so I should have told me earlier, so that I don’t have to wait for 3 hours, and wait until the time I made an appoin**ent to come, wasting my time !

msg:設施：設施OK，spa推薦

衞生：整體湊活，房間遙控器收納盒有毛毛灰，房間桌面宣傳頁有食物殘渣

環境：環境OK

服務：2星是給事後反應積極的評價，但整體太差，原因如下：
1. 禮賓部在2樓大門外未歡迎，沒有詢問是否辦理入住，沒有詢問是否有行李，雖然我沒有大件行李，但不該享受服務嗎？
2. 想要體驗spa，事先預約項目，但工作人員對優惠細節並不瞭解。等到要下單產品時，我發現優惠已到期。雖然服務熱情，實際項目體驗中也滿意，但前期溝通給人感覺很努力卻沒什麼用的服務感，沒有五星級酒店的水準。
3. 我理解食品外賣不可以幫忙送上房間，但前台答應幫我送此次葯品外賣兩份，需要簽署免責聲明。我同意簽署，也表明是一共兩個葯品外賣，結果衹送來一個，事發過晚比較困，沒有當時提出疑問。第二天我去禮賓部找，告知我沒有收到其他外賣，因此我向外賣騎手電話詢問，對方一再表明是送到，我此時很忙未追究。但是回到房間時，第二個袋子又奇蹟般出現在房間，五星級酒店服務不該偷偷摸摸，解決了也得應該解釋一下吧。
4. 因為入住第一晚在東灣就餐，知道平台有80代100的單次使用兩張的優惠，整體就餐還算滿意。離店時，中午在三餐就餐買單時，發覺依然有此不限使用時間的優惠，買單時：
第一位服務人員對此優惠十分茫然，尋找同事幫助，可以理解，但這不應該出現，專業服務場合沒有消費者瞭解具體買單細節？
第二位服務人員前來表明節假日不可使用，我詢問是否有標註？對方表示需要再向經理詢問。這一點體現出，不明真相就信口雌黃，沒有證據就開始胡謅。
此後第三位服務人員，也就是當日經理前來解釋，表明今天可以給我用到，同時表明一般節假日是不可以用優惠的。
對此我感到氣憤，聽感類似對我今日網開一面，本身這就是在規定範圍內可以使用的優惠，好像成為了消費者不講理後的補償，我不需要額外的打包飲品的息事寧人的解決辦法，我單純對此星級酒店非常不專業的服務感到生氣。
我向餐廳經理提出疑問：如果我是個不為自己爭取的消費者呢？
5. 此外，因為與經理髮生爭執，直到我走回空中大堂，當值所有其餘服務人員，有人注意到我們的氣氛緊張，卻並沒有人上前安撫詢問。

整體感覺，因為是獨自旅行，好像酒店非常自信認為本人不好的體驗不會對酒店產生任何影響，所以我可以被如此草率的對待，很難不讓人覺得有見人下菜碟的感覺，非常痛心以及氣憤。

注：今天錯誤對攜程差評後，才得知我發錯了評價的位置，特此補充點評。雖然酒店已和攜程溝通，賓客體驗部同事向我表達歉意，服務態度非常好，但我仍然需要將以上感到不舒服的細節，發至公開平台。

服務：服務很一般，禮賓不會主動拿行李，也不會問好，很冷漠。前台感覺也淡淡的，就是例行公事，帶點高傲。去游泳的時候，spa前台其中一個女前台會帶着審視的眼神打量，讓人很不舒服。整個酒店的服務人員態度都是高高在上的感覺，也不知道在高貴什麼。

優點：酒店公區氣派且具有設計感，房間內裝修簡約但富有格調；絕大多數服務人員均熱情主動且專業；文華閣happy hour提供現做的a la carte菜單且品質不錯，酒水選擇也很豐富。

缺點：前台服務人員新手太多，入住時一位正在被經理培訓，另一位幫我辦手續的也搞不清是否有房間準備好需要經理幫助；房間內部分設施有明顯磨損痕跡，雖然不多但對於這麼新的酒店而言也是不應該的；房間城景很開闊但玻璃不夠乾淨看出去總有些模糊；自助餐廳的早餐熱食選擇非常有限，廣式蒸點更是差得幾乎令人不敢相信這是MO的出品。

服務：從入住酒店禮賓到前台，大家都非常的熱情，仔細介紹酒店設施，最開始都挺好的，直到去了mobar感受到了不舒服也第一時間打電話投訴，後續mobar也給我解決了問題。吃叁餐的時候上菜速度略慢，最後實在等不住就打包回到了房間。


設施：房間淋浴水壓不穩，洗澡水一會涼一會熱。
在叁餐用早餐的時候，被培根旁邊的盤子燙到，非常燙的温度


服務：這次是過生日，也提前告知了酒店，酒店非常貼心的説準備房間佈置和蛋糕，但是生日當天佈置了兩個氣球，但是沒有蛋糕，打電話詢問後酒店説以為生日是明天，那佈置為什麼今天佈置了呢？


設施：點餐過後十分鐘，酒店打電話告知沒有麪包片了需要更換餐點……真是無語…

這家酒店的設施也非常優秀，房間非常寬敞，乾淨整潔，配備了舒適的床和現代化的浴室。早餐選擇豐富，味道鮮美。酒店地理位置優越，靠近市中心和公共交通，對於旅遊和商務旅客來說都非常方便。

I would like to say it is the best hotel in Shenzhen.

總之，我對這家酒店的印象非常深刻，而Alex的優秀服務更是讓我留下了難以忘懷的回憶。我強烈推薦這家酒店，並期待再次入住。

msg:房間升級了，對着北面，感覺風景不如東邊和南邊。大堂風格一般。早餐質量優秀。晚上外賣買了一個日用品不能送到房間，很不方便，現在隨便一個酒店都有機器人送外賣到房間，感覺高端酒店反而跟不上，體驗不好。電視投屏會斷斷續續。總歸感覺沒有那麼值這個價格

msg:深圳新開的文華東方酒店，剛開那一陣看攜程的評論不是太好，所以一直拖了好久才來體驗。

酒店設計空間體驗感很好，但需要沉浸式體驗，空間太大拍照不好拍，房間風景很好，可惜這兩天有霧，影響了視覺效果。個人認為，二樓大堂的兩個枯山水從設計上來説有點突兀，和酒店的主要設計風格不相適應。

真正讓我意外地是酒店餐飲水平相當不錯，而且服務非常好，東灣，Tapas，日料，都很不錯，服務人員都很有耐心，有服務精神，做事有眼力勁兒，給人感覺如春風拂面，日料的日本大廚還用中文給我們寫了一封致謝卡，相當讓人印象深刻。

位於79樓的酒吧超讚，氛圍好，風景好，感覺是深圳酒店裡最好的酒吧了。

游泳池不算大，但是裏面空間有五六層樓高，燈光和空間感都很好。

早餐稍微沒有那麼驚艷，鬆餅有點過厚，品種稍微少了一些。

房間裏設施都很好，尤其桌子上幾本書水平不錯，住一個週末居然讀完了一本講中國古代繪畫藝術的書，看到我翻開了書，開夜床的服務人員貼心地給我拿出了書簽，開始我還找書簽沒找到。

這幾天變冷，按要求給我們房間送了一個暖風機，但是聲音很大，晚上睡覺無法使用，建議換成無聲暖氣機。

是如此，而且是整個禮賓部都是，沒有遇到任何一個想
偷懶的員工，經理更是彬彬有禮！但是前台很可笑，辦理入住，首先推銷我5萬一晚的總統套房，在我表示拒絕後，又開始不停推銷行政套房，大中午，我帶着孩子，還沒吃到午餐，在前台浪費我時間不停給我推銷房
間，回房間後也沒有小朋友洗護用品，打電話給前台，説是需要我自己索要，這是文華東方的服務？你都給我小童房卡了，還不知道要預備小童洗護用品嗎，我住過那麼多酒店，知道有小朋友入住都會提前準備，好吧，在我索要了三次，都沒有把洗護用品給齊，而且給的是成人拖鞋和牙刷，等入住第三天，我才知道原來你們是有小童拖鞋和牙刷的啊，為何我朋友一家入住，辦理完
入住，前台就給齊了一大包小童洗護用品，為什麼我們
確是這樣，就因為我拒絕了前台5萬一晚的總統套房
嗎？而且朋友家入住的時候前台給了孩子小童房卡和掛
繩，我們卻沒有掛繩，不是在乎你這個2塊錢的掛繩，而是為什麼我們辦理入佳的工作人員沒有給我們，是因為我拒絕了你所有推銷嗎？！而且辦理入住的當天下午
我們已經和值班副經理反映了這個問題，但是他卻連個
抱歉都沒有，可想而知，這是你們深圳文華東方內部培訓就是需要推銷房型和區別對待客人嗎？看看餐廳的服務人員和樓下禮賓部吧，他們的所有努力，所有的微笑，都會被你們前台的個別工作人員和值班男副經理給拖後腿了！另外表揚前台值班女經理，特別好，最後是這個女值班經理給齊了小童洗護用品，還是非常友好！
作為最新的文化東方酒店，禮賓跟餐廳真的很不錯，我們願意再次來到餐廳愉快的用餐.但是前台服務希望加強！

剛進酒店一樓的時候，沒有人跟我們打招呼，門僮看見我們進去，什麼話都沒有説，也不問是來入住酒店，我們也不知道哪裡辦理，還是自己看電梯知道的。
辦理入住的時候，到了一個櫃枱，根本沒人，但是接待人員直接給我趕走了，讓我去其他櫃枱，一句不好意思都沒有哦。然後我們蒙的去了另一個櫃枱，辦理的時候接待人員也是一點都沒有介紹。我有集團會員，一些福利還是我自己爭取的。沒有主動説房間類型，房間待遇，酒店設施，辦理的時候前台沒有人，完全不忙，衹有我們在辦入住，也是沒有任何的問候和互動。請問給我辦理入住的是一個機器人嗎，我問啥他答嗎？
然後晚上回酒店的時候，由於沒有任何的介紹，我們也不知道第二天在哪裡吃早餐，問了前台自稱前台經理的人。我説了辦理時沒有人和我説這些，他也衹是問了我的房間號後沒有任何行動，那問我房間號幹什麼呢？前台就是這麼乾的？
然後酒吧也是，直接帶我們進去，我問了才説衹剩一個位置但是要買套餐，完全沒有提前告知。啥都不説，都要靠我自己問？
這些都是服務過程中很細節的東西，雖然都是小事，但是累積在一起真的很失望。之後去深圳會選擇其他酒店。

唯一覺得可以改善的是自助早餐的味道，比較一般。

但總體而言，深圳MO的服務實在是難能可貴的好，知道是紀念日特地安排了佈置，送了餐酒。夜床服務也是頂級酒店裡我個人感覺最好的。總結：禮賓部的服務足以彌補酒店其他方面的不足，值得來體驗一下。

説到現今深圳酒店的當紅炸子雞，非MO莫屬，年初剛開業之際嚐鮮打卡基礎行政房，而這次淺住了一下行政全景套房。
-
套房面積達114㎡，總體分為玄關、客衞、衣帽間、會客廳、用餐區、卧室與浴室，功能分區十分明確，舉辦一個小型生日趴絕對不是問題。
-
此次入住，酒店方提早電話溝通是否有什麼有重要日子慶祝，可以提供客房佈置，雖然沒有什麼日子，但佈置一下能更有放鬆的氛圍，就簡單説了下需求。沒想到，推開客房那一刻，直達天花板的氣球牆映入眼簾，各式氣球鋪滿房間的各個角落，但卻錯落有致，加上花瓣的點綴，浪漫氛圍感拉滿。與此同時，餐桌上早已備好各式甜點與堅果，香檳也早已在冰桶裏冰好，準備好迎接客人的入住。
-
客房採用精緻時尚的室內設計，盡顯深圳的年輕活力與創新精神。窗外能遠眺深圳灣海景，近看蓮花山公園，周邊高樓林立，更有君臨天下的感覺，海景、城景與園景近乎完美的結合，房間可謂是一步一景。衣帽間與浴室聯通，動線流暢，還專為愛美人士配備了梳粧台，可謂十分貼心。有別於一般浴室，套房使用了水療式浴室，與浴缸聯通，可一邊沐浴一邊觀賞深圳美景。
-
作為行政客房，房間內的出贈送的香檳外，迷你吧包括啤酒在內，軟飲也是可免費享用，同時享受三件衣物的免費清洗與行政酒廊的使用權，誠意十足。
-
在這裏特別感謝賓客體驗經理Aggie, 賓客體驗主管Even,Tallis還有實習生Clody。這次謝謝他們提供無微不至的服務讓我們感受到賓至如歸。
如需Staycation，深圳MO的全景套房是個不錯的選擇。

房間景觀很好，日落時分非常美。
飯後可以去蓮花山公園散步。但是路線的指引是很不友好的，可能也是由於疫情的緣故有些地方的封閉才造成這種問題，最後我是穿越了已經打烊的深業上城才回到酒店，這一番折騰可能是酒店設計者沒有考慮到的路線，希望可以優化一下。

再來説服務，我看到評論很多人反應Mo不會提前電話確認行程這件事情是真的，但到了酒店會告訴你自己防疫要求非常高。既然如此為什麼不能再接受客人訂單後致電確認一下行程碼之類的訊息呢。還有就是全國所有酒店沒有一個會對客人的外賣食物進行限制，但MO後，還是一樣，不提前告訴你，但到了以後會和你説，你點的螺螄粉不能帶進我們酒店 麻煩你去外面吃，如果事先聲明瞭。我想大部分客人都會理解並遵守，但為什麼要發生後讓人家出去吃，還説我喜歡吃價格低廉的食材？ 是不是MO的員工都有一種莫名的優越感？ 覺得自己高人一等？
綜上，幾次下來，入住體驗感從10分降到3分 硬件設施無可挑剔 但MO一直是服務界標榜 希望深圳MO支愣起來

msg:真的非常滿意，豪華酒店服務都不差，但是文華還是更出挑，值班經理張福臣還是成功打動了我們。因為抵達時候核酸沒出來無法入住，積極幫我們協調其他同等級酒店，客房安排，每日清潔的細節處理，續住和退房協調都看得出非常努力在住户角度着想。相比其他會如by的高冷會更温暖一些。新酒店一些司機會找不到，希望儘早熱鬧起來。唯一的弱點可能是雲廊做成了下午茶套餐，約朋友喝咖啡要去餐廳（然而by現在也這麼幹。。）

1.酒店很新，高樓層，視野開闊景觀無敵。
2.每個酒店人員都很主動有禮貌。
3.房間乾淨明亮，洗浴用品高級minibar豐富。
4.行政酒廊人員服務周到，但下午茶糕點很少。

缺點：
1.泳池很小，超過3個人在遊的過程中就要小心碰到別人，不明白那麼大個酒店留給泳池的面積那麼小，還要在已經很小的泳池裡隔了一個暖水池。
2.早餐品種少，尤其是中式的，點個麪也沒有選擇，衹有鹼水面，更沒有米粉河粉。 
早餐餐廳管理明顯缺乏經驗，一個早餐賬單反反覆覆三個人來問我簽了單沒有，更煩人的是已經簽完單還有人來問簽單了嗎，十分影響心情。
 
退房手續迅速，禮賓部服務很好，Lewis還幫忙提行李去停車場，感謝。

msg:During the May Day holiday, I booked a two-night stay at the Mandarin Oriental Shenzhen through Ctrip Live. The package clearly included two adult breakfasts and a customized dinner. After confirming these details with Ctrip customer service, I completed the reservation.

However, when I arrived at the hotel and checked in, the front desk informed me that the package did not include dinner, only breakfast. This discrepancy disappointed me. Nevertheless, in order not to let this matter affect our vacation, we decided not to dwell on it. However, on the second night of dining at the hotel, we ran into Mr. Liang in the hotel lobby. Mr. Liang took the initiative to upgrade our room to a higher floor and a larger room type. Although we were going to check out the next day, he generously delayed our check-out time, accommodated our travel plans, provided a welcome fruit plate, personally helped us move to the new room, and assisted us with our luggage.

It is worth mentioning that the Dongwan Restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. This was our second visit to the restaurant in two days. The dishes recommended by Manager Wang were very much to our taste, especially the two desserts that were "bottom of the box" in their restaurant, which were not only visually eye-catching, but also a wonderful challenge for the taste buds. The delicious enjoyment and experience made us decide that we would definitely come back for the third time.

Finally, Ctrip also responded and we were satisfied. Although this experience had its ups and downs, it was a satisfying accommodation experience overall. 👍🏻

msg:This hotel is so unreliable, I am on a business trip to Shenzhen! Booked a house for two days! I have something to do and I have to leave one day in advance so I can’t cancel it for me! The result was through repeated communication with the merchant! I called 123315 to complain and they canceled it! Bad review!

msg:The hotel entrance is very difficult to find. There are many taxis waiting at the door for a long time. The service is very poor. While waiting to check in to the hotel, I made a heavy order. The hotel insisted on deducting the price of a repeated night, which was clearly communicated before. Heart tired. The layout of such a high-end hotel is so small.
