msg:The landscape is really pretty. I think it's perfect for spending 1 or 2 days there (not a lot more to see than rice terraces). The tent was clean and comfortable with a nice view. The transport from or to the resort is a little tricky and needs to be organized well if you don't have your own car. The staff was friendly BUT what I felt was a no-go is that I booked and paid for the trip but they contacted my husband only and only talked to him though I also speak the local language. I found that really rude, even sexist. For foreigners and women it's maybe not the ideal place.

msg:I came here from Shanghai in a dusty wind. It took 12 hours to drive 380 kilometers. It once again confirmed that you can't drive during the holidays. It can be seen that Guiye does not damage the original forest, vegetation and ecology. Even the lights at night are appropriate and not dazzling. Even so, it is still very beautiful after dark. The interior configuration is indeed luxurious and wild. The white curtain dome is matched with a retro ceiling fan, the floor lamp is matched with an animal leather mat, and the small objects are also cute. Compared with the simple and cramped ordinary tents, the tents here can be described as luxurious. The dry and wet separation is the most basic. Not only is there ample space and the supplies are not bad, the bathtub, accessories and decorations are also advanced. I want to take their washbasin home. I came for 3 days and was in the clouds for two days. Fortunately, the terraced fields were perfect on the last afternoon.

msg:There were not many people who went there before May Day, and the experience was very good.
The campsite is very large and the distance between each tent is quite large, so the privacy is very good. It may be because it was newly opened last year. The equipment and facilities in the tents are very new, the sanitary area is separated into dry and wet areas, and the layout is full of camping style. The balcony is particularly good. You can drink tea and coffee in the afternoon and look at the terraced fields, and you can also watch the sea of ​​clouds in the morning. I have to mention the breakfast. At first, I thought it was just a simple porridge, steamed buns and fruits for each person, but I didn’t expect it to be very rich. The egg tarts made by the store are very delicious.

msg:This camp is really a great experience! The spring rain, the sea of ​​clouds and the rainbow added a lot of color to this trip. The characteristic design of the tent makes people feel as if they are in nature and feel the beauty of nature. The enthusiastic housekeeper adds a lot to this trip, and the intimate service provided makes people feel extremely comfortable. Whether it is sending an umbrella on a rainy day, helping to carry luggage, or even taking pictures, you can see the housekeeper's attentiveness and thoughtfulness. The long table meal for dinner is also a highlight. Sitting in the big tent, listening to elegant songs, and arranging a bonfire party after dinner, the experience is really explosive. It has been a continuous rainy season. As the housekeeper said, we will be lucky. There must be good scenery. A ray of sunshine in the early morning helps the layers of terraced fields and the sea of ​​clouds to make people feel refreshed. Sitting on the terrace next to the terrace for breakfast, having a cup of coffee while eating breakfast is really amazing. In general, this trip experience is very good, and I will come again next time I have the opportunity!

The campsite is in a good location and the camping facilities are top-notch, but the food is a little less. In addition, it was a bit cold at night, and it would be very cold in winter. I have stayed in too many five-star hotels, and this different experience is impressive.

There is also a bonfire party and fireworks on the Spring Festival evening, and the children have a lot of fun. The sanitation was also very clean.

There were more than ten centimeters of snow. The whole world of ice and snow was covered in silver. It was so beautiful! The children in the south were so happy when they saw it. They went skiing on the small slopes recommended by the camp staff. It was really exciting!

For dinner, we watched a movie in the tent and grilled hot pot around the fire. It felt like moving camping, very relaxing.

It’s a good place to relax in the mountains. Come back next time when you have time.

msg:My husband and I came to the terraced fields we had longed for, a very beautiful place. This is also my first time trying to stay in a tent. Overall, it’s great. The hotel is trying every possible way to let you experience the feeling of camping. The tent is fully equipped, the hardware is very new, the software accessories are very camping-like, and the personal toiletries are also of good quality. The housekeeper of the hotel is very considerate. He contacted you from the moment you set off and responded to your requests. He also upgraded our room for free and gave us a gift bag of snacks. The key is that the bag with snacks is great. I also used it when I went to Harbin later. Because It was a trip during off-peak hours, so we stayed for two days only for the two of us, and the breakfast became a private room hahahaha. The first day was a Western-style DIY, a complete set of camping equipment, and even the coffee was served in camping cups, which was very interesting. The next day is Chinese breakfast, you can order whatever you want and it will satisfy you. Dinner is also arranged at the hotel. Some dishes need to be reserved in advance. The dishes are abundant, taste good and cost-effective. The weather was different during the three days I came. On the first day I saw the terraced fields in the sun. On the second day it rained and I saw the terraced fields in the mist in the morning. On the third day it turned sunny and I watched the sunrise in the morning. No matter what season and weather you come, the terraces have different scenery and are all beautiful. The hotel is located right next to the scenic spot. You can see the terraced fields while sitting on the terrace. Lazy people can just stay in the hotel without delaying enjoying the scenery. If you are diligent, you can walk around nearby. You can also buy tickets at the hotel. The discount price is 48 yuan, which covers three attractions. Because the tickets are valid for a long period of time, you don’t have to go all in one day. You can play in several days. The price/performance ratio is quite high. It would be more convenient to drive yourself. Come see the terraced fields again in the spring and stay in this tent!

1、酒店工作人員業務生疏，對一切一無所知，從即將到達時電話確認停車場入口開始，差點把我們指揮出去，對旁邊的景點也不熟悉，我們隨便問了幾個問題答案都是不知道
2、餐難吃，晚餐我們提前預訂了，不好吃。早餐更是慘不忍睹，就2組客人，還把我們這組忘記了，早餐等了四十分鐘。進去看工作人員打開冰櫃的時候，更是讓人直接毫無食慾
3、不值這個價位 房間很冷 隔音很差
最後感謝這個民宿讓我深刻體會到 為什麼一般男人們不願意選擇民宿 而要選擇規模酒店了！搞點************* 能讓人有好的體驗嗎？

msg:酒店新穎，洋氣，又迴歸於自然。酒店正對着雲和梯田的九曲雲環，想要進入景區衹要步行一百多米。風景很好，地理位置優越。

一進酒店大堂，迎面撲來五星級酒店那樣的香味。大堂很現代優雅。
房間很好，設施完備又充滿新意，很多人性化的小細節體現出設計師的用心考量。
房間裏面看不到日出，想看日出可以走到房間門口的陽台側面，不過我住的那天陰天，並未看到日出有些遺憾。
説到服務，餐廳裏幾個當地老阿姨服務員真的是煞風景，問什麼話要麼聽不懂，要麼答不對題，診室服了。

早餐比較簡單，地瓜包子煎蛋之類。

總的來説，房間挺好，酒店挺好，環境挺好，地理位置方便，但是過節期間2020元一晚的價格，仍然過高，服務人員水平跟不上，性價比一般。

msg:如圖環境很好，工作人員態度也不錯，上下樓梯都有叔叔會幫扛行李，入住還會送一袋吃的。不過要吐槽的也很多因為是新開的房間裏味道會有點大，最致命的是在景區邊凌晨四五點都是汽車喇叭聲，之後又是景區巨大聲的音樂，完全睡不好。還有營地的餐食真的千萬不要訂！

msg:新開的帳篷營地 一開始攜程的定位以為是在山下 結果出乎意料是在山頂的 設施很新 帳篷也很好 風景沒話説 就是在試營業階段 餐飲和服務還跟不上 停車場也是石子路 但是有專門的工作人員幫忙拿行李 餐飲方面確實還不行 由於在山頂 周邊確實吃飯沒有地方衹能在酒店解決 按人頭算的 但是菜色感覺和這個價格不成正比 中間還發生了點小插曲 好在最後也算完美解決了 但是餐飲服務員都是年紀較大的阿姨 和她們説話什麼的她們都聽不大懂 晚上還有帥哥駐唱和篝火 氛圍很好 就是餐飲服務以及人員專業上還有待提高 早起可以看到梯田雲海 確實很棒 本還想續住一晚 但是由於一開始衹訂了一晚沒房了 衹能下次再來了

msg:酒店地理位置太棒了，就在九曲雲環出口處的斜坡，俯瞰梯田。最重要的是房間的view太好了。我訂的房間直麪東方，早上5點半爬起來拉開窗簾裹在被子裏就能看日出和雲海。樓下上山看日出的車堵得水泄不通。這對比讓我一下覺得值回票價。我訂的時候酒店剛剛開業，連一個點評都沒有。但我隱隱覺得這不會是個讓我後悔的選擇。

msg:衹能説這是我在國內住過的最讓我感覺到驚艷的帳篷營地了，景觀無敵，帳篷裏面就可以無死角的看日出觀雲海看梯田；高山蔬菜做的餐食拙樸而誠懇；晚上居然還有民謠歌手駐場，一邊篝火啤酒一邊鐵板小燒烤，户外幾乎沒有什麼蚊子，晚上非常涼爽，整個營地的安全指示非常周到，給你滿滿的安全感，強烈推薦啊！

msg:酒店好的地方就不用説了，其他客人都有點評了。就挑的差的地方來吐槽一下吧。結合國慶期間近兩千一晚房價（堪比五星酒店的價格）
1. C1，C2的帳篷鄰近樓下的公路，早上4點半就被此起彼伏的喇叭聲和旅遊團的噪音吵醒。
2.公共區域的洗手間很臟，異味很大。
3.坡道上的照明燈結滿了蜘蛛網，難道沒有人要清理一下嗎？
4. 中午回酒店時看到接待門口有幾位工人橫七豎八的躺在椅子上休息，實在大煞風景。
5. 早餐不像是2000一晚的住宿配置，倒像是200一晚的經濟旅店的廉價早餐。還配上幾個普通話都交流不清楚的的阿姨，第一天早飯看到有切片麪包，問阿姨有沒有黃油，阿姨回答是你看到的都在，沒看到就是沒有了。好吧…第二天早飯找帥哥先要了黃油，然後問阿姨麪包啥時候出。阿姨來了句今天沒買…好吧
綜合評價：酒店（或者説營地吧）View是很OK的，服務小哥美女也是非常熱情（除去阿姨，搞不懂為啥要請這些阿姨來）。其他軟件地方槽點太多。以當前這個賣價來衡量，性價比不高。
