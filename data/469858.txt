msg:The location is excellent, quiet in the bustle. You can directly watch the Huangpu River view from the room, which is especially beautiful at night. The lady at the front desk was very helpful and took us to the room. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, not many varieties. I asked for poached eggs, and they actually had 2 eggs fried together. Other hotels I have stayed at had fried eggs one at a time, which was good. The price-performance ratio is extremely high at the same price. The 2-bedroom apar**ent is spacious and comfortable for a family. After comparing the Westin hotel rooms at the same price, I decided to choose the sea view!

msg:The poor service is only for the managers in the club
Very clear distinction between permanent residents and hotel guests
A broken billiard room. My child was interested in the color of the billiard ball and put it on the table to play with.
On the first day, a female staff member came in and gestured and said no.
We made it clear to her that the three of us adults saw this two-year-old child playing ball without a pole and scolded her. After going back the next day, we locked the door and found a staff member who opened the door. This uncle was okay and didn't talk so much nonsense. That night, 6:00-6 : Around 30, the children went to play again and came again. The female staff gave me another meal and made my son cry. The aunts were at a loss. I told her clearly that the children put the ball on the table to watch and have fun. Let me put you back in place. My son cried. She even spoke up. This is really the most incompetent service staff I have ever encountered. If this is really a Colliers property, it is really the worst Colliers. This negative review is only for those I have encountered. These service staff and others, including the cleaning aunt, are all very nice. You are welcome to retrieve the surveillance video to verify the broken billiard balls in the billiard room. Children like you. Since you are so short, I will give you ten sets and leave a way to receive them.

msg:Good location, quiet amidst the noise.
Room hygiene is very good. The facilities are a bit old, and the TV remote control in the living room is almost useless.
The service is uneven: the room service is very good, warm and thoughtful, and they will take off their shoes when entering and leaving. The front desk is quite satisfactory, and the professionalism needs to be improved. The high floor and extra bed remarks in the order are directly ignored.
The extra bed should include breakfast for one person, but it was still charged the next day...lowering the overall impression score.
