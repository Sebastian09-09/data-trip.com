There’s an infinity pool and you can walk around the resort which is very clean and safe. Perhaps the villa might be nicer than the hotel room. But with the price we paid, it is worth it. The location is perfect in the heart of Yalong Bay.

msg:This hotel has the most beautiful surroundings,with the views of the lake, nearby mountain and national forest park.Birds chirp happily and lots of lush make you feel you are in a tropical paradise.
Fish ponds around the reception area are also adding up to the whole feeling of tranquility.
It is particularly suitable for families and kids, predominantly Chinese people.
The front desk service is always smiling,however only two of them can speak English.I was especially impressed by the manager Margaret who made sure I settled well.My first room has a pool access . However,that pool is shared with 3 other similar rooms and the apartment on the 2 Nd floor which was occupied by a family with 3 kids..They were inconsiderate and noisy, would swim until late at night disturbing my peaceful sleep, which os why I moved to a lobby room, apparently smaller one with no bath tub.In a way I was downgraded and was hoping for some compensation,but nothing was initiated.No worries.
That still did not spoil the rest of my stay in this wonderful resort.My friend came to join me and we extended my stay fro 3 more days.
I would recommend this hotel to couples and  families mainly.
The best nature in Sanya!

msg:This was my second stay at the Yalong Villas and Spa. The first time I stayed in a room in a villa with a pool and this time I opted for the lake view room, overlooking the pool and tropical lagoon. Both times I have stayed here I have the feeling I have been transported to Bali. The grounds are lush with palm trees and gorgeous landscaping and the lobby decor with its gorgeous wood furniture and koi ponds and fountains, reminiscent of many of the hotels I have stayed in in South East Asia. The hotel room was very clean and the bed extremely comfortable with lovely linen. I slept with the balcony door open and fell asleep to the sound of the palm trees rustling in the wind. The room was extremely quiet. The rooms facing the lagoon are North facing, so there is not a alot of sunlight on this side of the building. Breakfast is a pretty good Chinese/Western buffet with lots of options and there is a quiet outdoor seating area if you want to avoid the morning rush of families. The hotel offers a shuttle to the beach across the street which is shared with the Horizon hotel, but I opted to walk each day as it is only 5 minutes or less from the hotel. I would definitely return to the hotel and hope one day to check out a proper private villa when I return with a group of friends!

Especially at the desk zhang wen juan was absolutely nice. She shared with us her wechat and could resolve any doubt we have. And also the staff at the entrance of the lobby and the one at the gate. They offer you a boggie car to your room or the beach in one minute. The beach is private ( only 2 minutes away by boggie car) and amazing: with waves and soft sand. The environment of the hotel is beautiful, very green with many plants. You feel you are always alone, not crowded at all even though you see many people in the breakfast. We stayed in a villa room and even though we have a shared pool with other 3 rooms the pool was very big and clean and we were alone always we took a bath. The pool at the hotel is quite nice because you can see the lagoon from it. And in the kids pool they have bubbles from 16-18h. The Chinese restaurant is quite good too. Maybe the breakfast could be improved a bit but anyway you have western and Chinese options, fresh fruit, cheese, noddles… and a patio outside in case you prefer stay outside the dinning room. We loved it and we 
will come back for sure!!

The room was gorgeous but some things just didn’t function well, like the outdoor shower was broken. AC was excellent. The pool in the villa really needs a deep clean and fresh grout, but it was cozy. The outdoor bed had some mold on it. But inside everything was clean, albeit a little run down in spots. Unfortunately only one of the restaurants is open (the Chinese food one) and the food is just ok. Overall though it was an excellent value and we had a great time.

We booked a premium couple villa and were expecting something clean, new-ish, bright like the photos. The room was old, dirty, furniture chipped, low ceiling, dark wood. We found two plastic bags, one in the pool, one outside, the walls were cracking, satin curtains, stained outdoor mattress... The breakfast is bad, yogurt staying outside in the sun without being put on ice so, at 11 AM, it's more milk than yogurt and tastes warm and off. 

We cancelled our stay and booked another hotel the morning after.

Our friends also stayed here and we loved it so much, we spent the majority of our time here. The outdoor bungalow is super relaxing and everything is top notch for privacy and beauty. The beach area was very close and the hotel offered a shuttle there but we just used our rented e-bikes. You could walk to the beach in 10 min. The service was fantastic and any time we ordered anything to our room it was delivered with efficiency. Our family and friends will absolutely return here.

msg:We rented a 4 BR villa for about a week so that we could spend time with some friends and family. I was pleasantly surprised to find that each BR in the villa was like its own hotel room, with its own bath and private door (I wish that was mentioned in the description, I would have booked places like this much sooner!) 
Each member/group of our party arrived at different times and Dre at the front desk was very helpful in facilitating that process of check in for us. We received all sets of keys up front, and as guests arrived, they just needed to do a quick registration. He also helped throughout the trip with our other questions and requests. Very helpful and we're very grateful to have had his wechat for his assistance!
Our villa's pool, unfortunately, did not get much sun so we weren't able to use it due to it being too cold. Next time I will definitely request a villa that gets more sunshine in the pool area. Also, no chairs or loungers for the outside, which would have been nice, but since it was cold and rainy for most of our trip, it didn't bother us this time.
Breakfast seemed to be on a 3 day rotation, so we never got bored with eating the same thing day after day, which was nice, and it never seemed overly crowded when we were there - there would be waves of people, but we found if we showed up around 9:30-9:45 it was a slower time and easily able to get to the food and find a table.
I would say that housekeeping needs to be a little more attentive. There were a couple days where the toilet paper clearly needed to be refilled and that was overlooked, and there isn't any dish soap with which to wash the dishes, yet the housekeeping didn't wash them either. Also, no microwave or stovetop in the kitchen - not sure if they would be available upon request, we weren't planning on cooking, but a microwave definitely would have been nice to have already in the kitchen.
We had friends staying at the Horizon across the street so we would go to the beach with them during the day and they would come to our villa at night where we could play games and hang out without disturbing adjacent rooms. It was so nice to have the common kitchen, dining and lounge areas to spread out, while still having the privacy of your own room as a retreat. Our villa was thankfully close to the entrance so we never needed to use the trolley to get to the road/reception area, as we could just walk, so I'm not sure if that would have changed our experience. The property is large and nicely separated between buildings. Overall, it was a great trip! I would definitely recommend staying here again with a group of people.

msg:The quality of the service if extremely far from declared level. The pictures from web-site do not correspond to reality.
Breakfast place has been relocated to the conference hall which is poorly decorated with few windows which does not fit for that purpose. The website claims that that breakfast is with a good view, however, it does not seem so in the slightest. The cleaners and dishwashers are often seen loitering around with trash cans and waste material inside the breakfast area. I faced the following issues with food: western food is poor and kept cold (heaters are not even plugged into power), frozen bread, spoiled and expired food (duck, cheese, fruit, even flakers)
The hotel cleaning staff leaves trash and cleaning items in the resting place of the guests. The reception staff does not speak English, and are unwilling to communicate and be helpful.

One difficulty was that the hotel staff doesn’t speak English and it made our communication difficult/complicated. Another drawback was that the breakfast selection was not that wide especially for 5 days, but the available meals were perfect. The last problem was that the pool was not cleaned regularly, so after 2 days, the sunscreen lotion was floating on the surface. The cleanliness, room service, buggy cars, location were excellent. They even allowed us to check in at 12:00. Again, overall impression was fantastic, I’d say 9.5 out of 10!

1. Environment: The whole hotel is basically composed of various villas of different sizes. Because they are all villas, the overall environment of the hotel is still good. I just saw a lot of gardens, which seem to be not well maintained and have a lot of ****s;
2. Room: In general, the room facilities are relatively old, and the TV is even an old 32-inch TV. This TV is indeed a bit cheap to use in this villa, especially in the living room, it seems too small, and even the water pipes in the Supreme Room 3 are broken;
3. Service: Thank you to the lobby assistant manager Xiao Wang (real name unknown), who helped us upgrade the room type when we had a series of problems in the room we checked in, which can be regarded as saving our mood. The staff we met in the morning also took the initiative to greet us, so I am quite satisfied with the service.

The environment is elegant, with birds singing and insects chirping. Manager Zhao at the front desk of the hotel provided excellent service, thoughtful, serious and enthusiastic, and took us to visit the gardens and room types. Thank you very much. I will definitely recommend it to my relatives and friends.

Every place in the hotel is very photogenic. I wanted to post the beautiful pictures of the mothers, but was rejected. The hotel service is very good, the front desk is enthusiastic, and the check-in is fast. I forgot the name of the little beauty. The concierge took the initiative to open the car door and take the luggage, and patiently introduced how to use the hotel room equipment. If you want something, just call and the waiter will deliver it in a while. In short, everything is good. I will come again next time.

msg:The hotel itself is very good. The main advantages are both the location in the center of Yalong (literally 5 minutes to the street with cafes and shops) and at the same time complete silence and tranquility in the area. The overall style of the hotel is more Balinese than Chinese. It makes sense to check into one of the villas rather than the main building (which is a little tired). A large area with a pond where you can walk, ride a catamaran and even fish.

We lived in the main building in a room overlooking the lake. In general, the room is not bad, two fairly large separate beds, a small sofa, a table with a chair and a balcony with a drying rack. Very good air conditioning, especially when paired with a fan they create a cryochamber in the room :)) Large comfortable bathroom.

Breakfast until 10:00 in a separate room. Quite large and varied, you can always find something tasty.

Nice Infinity pool with clean and warm water. There is a bar near the pool, they make cocktails and you can even have a snack (there is a menu in Russian).

The hotel also has its own section on the beach under mangrove trees, which is also convenient and not all hotels can boast of this.

The only big minus is the very small number of sunbeds by the pool - 6-8 for everyone. Accordingly, if someone occupied it in the morning (as some bad tourists do) and left, then the only option is to sit on chairs.

According to the Tomas Travel rating, the hotel is 9/10, breakfast is 3/5!

msg:First of all, let's talk about the location. It is located in the center of Yalong Bay, close to Baihua Valley. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the beach. Next to it is Yalong Bay Forest Park. It is very suitable for a holiday and lying down. If you want to check in at many landmarks, it is not suitable.
Secondly, the room is very clean, the hotel park is very beautiful, and the overall style is Southeast Asian. There may be geckos. It is normal to have geckos. You can ask the waiter to deal with it.
The Hainan cuisine in Youwei Restaurant tastes very good, but the fried rice for breakfast is not very delicious. I hope it can be improved.
As a five-star hotel, the service is of course very good. Xiaoxue at the front desk is very considerate. She paid attention to the use of Band-Aids in time and helped to replenish them. The brother who caught geckos is also very good 😂
In short, it is very suitable for vacation. It is very pleasant to sit on the beach every evening

msg:It's really a perfect hotel experience. I can give you two hundred points!
This hotel is not along the coast, but it is very close to the sea. The price is moderate, but it is very cost-effective.

Facilities: The facilities in the room are not new, but they are not old either. There are many solid wood furniture and they are very comfortable. The sound insulation is very good!

Hygiene: Very clean, there are no mosquitoes in the room, and the aunt will come and replace it in time

Environment: I would like to praise the environment. The greening rate here on No. 5 is 70%. As a green plant lover, I am so happy! It’s really relaxing to lie on the bed and watch the tropical green plants swaying in the breeze outside the window😊

Service: The most important thing is great service. . I didn't book a room online before arriving on the first day because I'm a light sleeper and afraid of noise and light. I didn't dare to book a room after reading a lot of bad reviews about the hotel. I simply came here to see the room first before making a reservation. The front desk guys Xiao Chen and Xiao Xue were very patient in introducing us to the room, showing us the room, and answered my questions carefully throughout the process.
We had booked a set dinner for the next night after we checked in, but because we were taking wedding photos, the time was very uncertain. Director Xiaopu of the catering depar**ent took the initiative to contact us to understand our situation, and notified the kitchen to help us prepare meals according to our needs. It was really Very considerate!

Next time I come to Sanya, I will book this hotel🥰

msg:how to say? The location is not on the beach, but you can walk there. There is also a battery car at the door that can take you to the exclusive beach. It only takes two minutes to drive there. It takes five minutes to walk to Baihua Valley, and it takes about ten minutes to walk to Yalong Bay Central Square. Tianyu is across the road, so the overall location is okay. But, the hygiene is really not complimentable. I booked a room for my family, an elegant room, one of the rooms in the villa, with a private bathroom, dry and wet separation, the swimming pool on the first floor and the living room are shared by all the rooms upstairs and downstairs. In the evening, the old man swam in the villa's swimming pool for about ten minutes. After a while, he had a few red rashes on his arms and it was still itchy. After much thought, he didn't do anything else. The problem may be the water in the swimming pool. I stayed here for two nights. The rash just went away after I checked out today. When we checked in, the villa was in a mess and had not been tidied up. The cushions in the outdoor daze pavilion did not look very clean, and the cushions were too soft and uncomfortable. The door handle to the outside on the other side of the room was still broken.
Ctrip gave me two experiences. I didn’t ride a bicycle, but fishing was quite fun. The bait was now made of flour. The service guy cooked the dough and hung up the fishing line in a leisurely manner. When I first put the water in, the fish floated around and disappeared after I picked up the food. . Later, I summed up my experience and found that the bait prepared by my brother was too wet. Not only was it sticky for a long time, but it also melted immediately when it fell into the water. I quickly relied on myself and used noodles to survive for a while. This time, it was fine. In the last ten minutes, I cheated and counted. There were dozens of twelve fish, all of which were tilapia. The younger brother asked if he planned to release the animal? The answer is no, there is dinner tonight
I asked the old man if he would stay here again next time. The answer is no, the overall service is not very comfortable, and the waiter has a small smile and is cold and cold. Still St. Regis, Ritz is more fragrant. Of course, I reminded him in time that the price is not of the same level. In short, if you are looking for cost-effectiveness, this place is okay. Just remember not to swim in the villa swimming pool. If you want to swim, you can go to the one next to the lobby. Those who pursue service and a better environment can only pass.

The passage to the beach is 5 minutes through the hotel in front, there are sun loungers from the hotel. The location is excellent, the street with food is 5 minutes walk. The hotel itself seems okay, but somewhere something is not right. The room is ok, clean, beautiful view, spacious. The pool is very beautiful, but terribly cold. The biggest minus of the hotel is the breakfast and the room for it. EATERY. Somehow the architecture of the hotel and the dining room do not fit together, as if they were not from him. The food is also poor. And the lobby smells awfully like fish. We spent 5 days cleaning the backwater with fish, but even when it was filled, the stench was terrible. But, if the hotel is affordable (7-8 thousand), you can safely take it))

msg:This is my second time staying at Villa No. 5 in Yalong Bay! According to industry regulations, I should check in at 3 pm. Since my flight to Sanya was relatively early, the hotel tried its best to arrange for me to check into the room I had reserved before 1:30. This is a Balinese style hotel. Especially the couple's pool villa is very similar to the pool villa in Bali. There is a big daze pavilion inside. It is very comfortable to relax on the mattress of the daze pavilion! Villa No. 5 has an excellent location. Turn left after exiting the gate and walk for 5 minutes to reach the most lively Baihuagu Market in Yalong Bay. There is a one-stop service for eating and shopping, and there is a lot of choice. The hotel is not far from the seaside, so you can choose to walk. The hotel also has battery cars to provide transportation services. It is particularly worth mentioning. The restaurant in the hotel is amazing! There are outdoor dining seats next to the infinity pool in a beautiful environment. The food in the hotel restaurant is delicious and not expensive. For example, the marbled taro dessert looks like a work of art! The hotel service is also very good. The service staff take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they see them! In short, I highly recommend this hotel to my friends (as long as your accommodation budget is around a thousand yuan for two people)!

msg:A very unique hotel with obvious Southeast Asian style. The hotel is triangular in shape and has a large area. There are many villas hidden in the tropical rainforest, and the entire garden is very beautiful. The birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, and the air is very good. The interior layout of the hotel is reasonable and convenient. Whether it is the lobby, restaurant, corridors and guest rooms, they are all exquisite. What's more outstanding is that all service staff are very civilized and greet guests every time they meet. This common practice proves that the employees have been well trained and have developed a habit of being hospitable to guests. The breakfast has many varieties and is quite delicious. The Chinese restaurant by the pool is also very unique and the quality of the dishes is good. The reception at the front desk was warm and they even put a plastic protective cover on our ID cards when using them, which was very considerate. Special praise needs to be given to the room attendant Liu Xiaoyan. She cleans promptly every day, is neat and responsive, and responds to requests. This not only respects the needs of guests, but also directly reflects the high standard of room service, which can win more repeat customers for the hotel. Next time you come to Sanya, you will definitely come to "No. 5"!

The prices are completely mismatched, it’s very inconvenient to get around and you have to call for a shuttle bus, and you can’t even get takeout... It’s not for lazy people. I didn't stay at all that night, so I don't know how to sleep at night. I feel that the sound insulation is not very good. The location is also a five-minute walk from the business district.

The overall design is grand and large-scale. From the appearance to the details and accessories, the decoration is solid, attentive and not perfunctory. There will be no duplicate scenery at every glance. In the view room we stayed in, the bougainvillea on the balcony actually had a bird's nest. What a good ecological environment. There was an infinity swimming pool downstairs, and the scenery was beautiful day and night. The variety of breakfast is okay, but the quality could be improved. What I like most is the hotel's environment, Thai-style lobby, Thai-style stone carvings, Thai-style waiters' costumes, orange sofas in the room, and ceiling fans. The room, bathroom and balcony are all bright and clean. The hotel is generally well maintained, relatively new, and is still under renovation. The bedding is also very comfortable. The infinity pool is beautiful for taking pictures. Will stay here again.

It is cold when turned on but not hot. It is recommended to prepare a dehumidifier in the room and block the air outlet. Board or something, both of us had eczema all night after staying here, and we were depressed. Breakfast was okay, but the decoration of the restaurant was too earthy. It looked like a state-owned canteen, which did not match the style of a villa hotel at all. Moreover, the replenishment of food was too slow. We went there at eight o'clock, and many meals were gone. It took a long time to replenish them, which affected overall feeling

msg:This is the second time I stayed at Villa No. 5. I told the hotel one day in advance that my birthday was on the day of my stay. When I checked in, I confirmed the ID card and birthday date with the front desk. I waited for about 40 minutes for the notification that I could check in. I entered the room with joy , but found that there was no welcome fruit...the staff only delivered the fruit after calling. It doesn't matter if the sense of ritual is gone, but I couldn't sleep at all after staying for two nights. I had sprayed all the mosquito repellent water I brought (the door and window were not opened in the room), and my husband was bitten by nearly 200 bags of unknown insects. I had about 30 bites. It was definitely not the itching and pain of mosquito bites. The two hard nights finally passed. When I checked out, I contacted the staff to inform the situation. The attitude was pretty good. I suggested that we go to the hospital, and then added WeChat Later, there was no follow-up, because we did not come to Sanya for tourism, but were permanent residents, so sometimes we would stay in various hotels for a night or two to have fun, but this time the experience on the 5th was really terrible. Then breakfast arrived at 10:30. When we arrived at 10:00, we found that many things were gone and no longer served. The overall dining experience was also very bad. The only thing I think is good is the fairy chicken in the Chinese restaurant. I have been eating it for 8 years. 😤😤😤😤😤😤

msg:Once we arrived at the lobby, it was chaotic and there was no Hongyun staff to greet us, and it took a long time to check in.
As soon as we arrived, the kitchen on the first floor of the hotel smelled very musty and there was a very big gecko.
Once we got to the room, it was even more extreme. There was an unknown creature in the bathroom, as shown in the picture below.
They confirmed with us that there would be breakfast, but when we went we were told there was no breakfast. After searching for the cause for a long time, the problem was still not solved until 11 o'clock in the evening. The processing efficiency was extremely low.
Then there was no service provided according to Ctrip orders, no travel photography, no Betel Valley tickets, everything was missing.
The service attitude was extremely poor and very perfunctory. The breakfast issue was not resolved until we left the hotel. We complained to 12345 and the hotel replied to 12345 saying that a meeting would be held to make a decision. I was really speechless. It is recommended that you go cautiously.

Facilities: The water in the public swimming pool is terribly green. If you dare not go swimming, you should go to the seaside. The transparent boat in the swimming pool cannot take pictures if you miss the time.
Environment: The entire hotel is very big, but unfortunately there is no time to go shopping, and the bicycles are useless, and an additional 10 yuan is required for the parent-child payment.
I bought a package ticket with dinner. The restaurant is next to the lobby. The dishes are good, and the waiters are very friendly! I hurried to check in, and I could eat without going out. I don't need to use my brain to think about what to eat, it's convenient!
The breakfast dishes are quite rich, and the sanitation needs to be strengthened. There are small mosquitoes on the fruit.

msg:The non-sea view price of more than 700 is neither expensive nor cheap, but I think the hotel with this price should not be bad, but this is the worst service among the hotels I stayed in Sanya for nine days. The car just arrived at the gate and wanted to unload the luggage first, but the security kept chasing him repeatedly and refused to let him unload the luggage. He insisted on driving to the villa area. I asked him if he must live in a villa? He didn't listen to the insistence to drive him away, but after the registration, he had to ask his husband to drive back to unload the luggage. Knowing that he was wrong, he insisted that he didn't know if it was a villa. Since he wasn't sure if it was a villa, why did he keep driving him away? The front desk of the hotel is also a drag, asking questions is not allowed to ask, you have to listen to her to ask you to ask you to ask, she talked a lot until I forgot what I wanted to ask. The beach is far away from the hotel. If you don’t wash the sand and then go back to the hotel, you will be in a panic. We washed it and then went back to the hotel pool. This is the first time a lifeguard asks you if you have washed the sand in the hotel where you stay in Hainan every year. I stood stunned and asked him if he needed to check. The buffet breakfast restaurant is decorated like a company canteen, the room decoration is old, the quilt is yellow, and stains can be seen everywhere. Therefore, the overall feeling of this hotel is dilapidated, unhygienic, and stingy

When leaving, the staff counts all the towels for at least 5 minutes. The room fee of more than 3,000 per night has been paid. I hope there will be an express check-out in the future. Generally speaking, the villa is suitable for a family. Live, can live in open, the living room can also play cards.

All I can say is this hotel is immediately reduced to a tour group hotel right? ? ? The bathroom is very unclean, the sanitation in many places is too poor, I don't know if the bedding has been replaced, there are several short hairs, black hairs and small bugs. Moldy bugs. If the hotel has such poor sanitation as washing the sheets by itself, then everyone who has stayed in the hotel should turn on the lights to see how dirty the sheets are. If it is outsourced, it is better to call Home Inns, Home Inns are cleaner than yours. . We checked out in the morning, and no one cleaned the fallen leaves. The children know that they should not give this hotel one star, just one word, dirty. The pool bottom is also cloudy. Did not dare to play with the children. . . There are so many 200-night B&Bs in Southeast Asia, and their hygiene management is several levels higher than yours. Cleanliness should really be sorted out. I don't want to live in this broken hotel in my life.

Five minutes walk from Baihua Valley. The free glass boats are out of the box. Fish can be fed for free.
The disadvantage is that the quilt is not down, it is a bit thick. There are no parent-child activities, and if there are, it is more manageable. There are more frog calls at night. The service at the front desk is so-so. I check in at 3 o'clock. I was told that the cleaning has not been completed. I checked in at nearly 4 o'clock. I applied for a late check-out the next day. I was told that it was not possible. I asked the front desk to check in at 4 o'clock. Hours, the front desk was stunned, saying that he couldn't explain it. Of course, it was delayed for an hour in the end, but it just felt that the service training was not in place.
Generally speaking, the design of the hotel is almost exactly the same as that of Vera in Bali. It has the feeling of being in Bali. It is suitable for couples and not suitable for parents and children.

Disadvantages (can be strengthened): There is a small refrigerator for a fee in the room. It is recommended that the first night or all of the room types should be free for consecutive stays and better. It is not a valuable thing (many hotels I have stayed in include it), and the hotel has a public seaside swimming There is a fee to rent the ring, which I don’t really understand.

I didn’t recognize many trees. The weather is very comfortable, and the mood of the day is beautiful. No wonder Sanya is suitable for vacation and retirement. I finally realized it. (ps: The hotel also has a sightseeing car to pick you up), and there are many types of breakfast. At noon, the 198 yuan set meal at Youwei restaurant is large and delicious. Every waiter is very polite and greets everyone with a wave. The hotel has a lobby bar where the old hydrochloric acid is so sour. It is very Hainanese, and the waiter also intimately introduced the difference between old salt and household salt. It is indeed different from our household salt, and it tastes very thirst-quenching. The hotel is a very private villa, and the design and arrangement are in Balinese style.

The disadvantage is that the check-in time was relatively late and the cleaning was not completed after 4 o'clock on the day of check-in, which affected the check-in experience. At the same time, breakfast was moved indoors, which improved the dining environment and experience. The food and food are not as good as before, hope to improve.

msg:I stayed in a hotel in 2013. This time I returned to my old place after 10 years. The facilities, health, environment, and services were all as good as they used to be, but the breakfast was really too ordinary. This is already a very friendly review. I stayed in a villa priced at 3,000 or 4,000 a night. Whether it is the dining environment, the food, the taste, the appearance, the color, the aroma, the appearance, I really cannot praise it. I remember 10 years ago, at least the dining environment was better than now. At that time, the restaurant next to the infinity pool was like a big canteen. I feel particularly bad. Looking at the food types, there is really no comparison with the other two hotels I stayed at during this trip. The reputation of such an old hotel is really not very good.

What, such complicated designs; the fountains in the swimming pool are damaged and no one repairs them, the temperature of the hot water in the bath is actually dynamic, and when bathing the baby, it will be cold to death for a while, and cry for a while, and the outdoor shower room of the pool villa is actually set at You have to go through the back door of the entire room, which means you have to drag your wet body across the entire room to take a shower.

It is very close to the beach, across the Tianyu across the road is the beach, and there is an exclusive rest area for No. 5. It is about 400 meters away from the Baihuagu commercial center, so it is convenient for eating and shopping.

msg:Hotel health and environment are not bad. There is a private swimming pool, it is very quiet, the space is also very large, and the privacy is very good. When I checked in, the front desk took nearly half an hour because the order was not checked. After I showed the reservation record and confirmation text message, the front desk solved the problem by itself and issued the ticket on the spot. According to the company's regulations, this kind of event where there is no room at the scene should be a three-for-one loss.
In addition, for hotel services, since the guest rooms are close to the edge of the hotel, it is extremely inconvenient to pick up meals. At one o'clock in the middle of the night, after telling the front desk that the takeaway was medicine and supermarket items, we still used the hotel's requirements and epidemic prevention and control as a shield, and insisted on asking us to go to the gate to pick it up by ourselves. It is better to send a car to pick up and drop off, but also to ask the residents to make a trip by themselves. This is obviously a manifestation of lack of service awareness. It can also be strengthened. The rule is that dead people are alive, and this kind of service consciousness will get bad reviews.
In addition, the restaurant meals are quite satisfactory. Not like other hotels in the area.

It is very noisy at night. If someone is playing mahjong or having a party in the neighboring villa, it will be a nigh**are. The sound insulation is extremely poor, as if people are active in your yard. Even if you have a quiet neighbor, the frogs at night are very loud, not one or two, but large groups, so you have sleep problems and don't want to sleep at all.
The quality of service is relatively poor. There are only 3 small bottles of mineral water in each room, while other hotels provide unlimited supply.
It is impossible to check in early at all. When you check in at 3 o'clock, it is possible that other rooms in your villa have not been cleaned yet.
The villa is relatively old, the kitchen is basically unusable, there is a musty smell, there is no basic microwave oven, it is very poor.
The overall feeling is not as good as the standard hotel room, and the standard hotel room at the same price may have a better experience.

msg:The worst hotel, a hotel that can't issue an invoice. Full of cheating, I called the front desk from Tuesday to ask for an invoice. The front desk clearly stated that the electronic version can be opened. Added WeChat and ignored me on Tuesday. On Wednesday I proactively called again to ask for the invoice. Someone finally got back to me on WeChat, sent me an email address, and then the voice ticket disappeared with me, and I was asked to wait for 2.3 days. I made it clear that I was in a hurry. On Saturday night, after waiting for 3 days, the invoice was not issued. I felt that the hotel was dishonest, there was no basic integrity, and there was no reply, so I called Ctrip. In the end, Ctrip and the hotel gave me the answer that the electronic ticket will be on Monday again. A hotel like this, unable to issue an electronic invoice, laughed, and repeatedly deceived and perfunctory customers. There are pictures and truth. Not to mention such a high price, I think it's not even as good as home. Such an executive and deceptive hotel really shouldn't be in Sanya, and it shouldn't be in Ctrip's list of hotels. Now I feel more and more that Ctrip is useless. With our money, the problem Ctrip can't solve. What the hotel says is what. I'm leaving Ctrip. Sometimes the price of Ctrip is the same as or higher than the price at the front desk of the hotel. I choose Ctrip because I think Ctrip has a guarantee. Now that it is useless to think about it, I will apologize and say some high-sounding words. I just want to ask what invoice I have to wait for 4 days, and it is the hotel that delays it again and again. Does it not violate the law? No way, I have let 12315 intervene, a society ruled by law. I hope the law will give me justice. I hope you don't encounter such a situation. Real feedback, a hotel with dishonesty and a little execution is not worth staying in, and even more ridiculous is a luxury hotel. speechless

msg:🍃Environment: The first thing to say is that this hotel is basically a villa room, and the rooms are relatively large, so it is much quieter than a hotel close to the sea. If you are traveling together, booking a villa will be very comfortable.

🚗 Transportation: The hotel is not too far from the sea, and the rooms are a certain distance from the hotel gate, but it is more convenient to have a courtesy car in the hotel. In addition, the rooms basically have their own swimming pools, which is very comfortable to go out into the water.

🧹Sanitation: It is very clean, the bathroom in the room is very large, and it is convenient to take children.

In general, the hotel is quiet and comfortable, and it is the first choice for friends and relatives to gather together!

Hair frizzy to the point of doubting life. The swimming pool at the door of the room felt unusable and not very clean. I was a little unhappy when I finally left the store. I took my luggage and went to the lobby to check out. It was raining and the ground was wet. I called the front desk twice and waited for 20 minutes without a car to pick up.

There is a separate public leisure area on the first floor of each villa, which is especially suitable for family vacations. On the day of check-in, the occupancy rate of the hotel was high. Sister Wen at the front desk tried her best to arrange the room, especially Brother An. When she learned that I was tired from the journey, I specially adjusted the room and quickly checked in and rested. During the stay, every waiter encountered took the initiative to wave, smile and say hello. The doorman is very responsible. Every time I enter the hotel door, I measure the temperature. Thank you for your cooperation. During the epidemic prevention and control period, I felt that this was a warm hotel.

We are a two-bedroom and one-living room where the big four and the two live. On the second floor, we share a swimming pool with the residents on the first floor, which is very convenient to play. The area of the hotel is very large, but there is a shuttle bus, which is on call, and the service is considerate. The private beach is good. It is 3 minutes away from the main entrance of the hotel. You can also take a shuttle bus. The beach is not crowded, and the staff are warm and thoughtful. The breakfast is very rich and clean. It is worth mentioning that the Tai Chi massage shop on the east side of the hotel lobby is really amazing. It is quite comfortable to come and relax after playing. Near Baihuagu commercial center, turn left and go straight for 4-5 minutes after leaving the hotel. There are many delicious restaurants, and the price is small but acceptable. I stayed in Villa No. 5 for seven nights this time, and I still have no idea. I will stay here the whole time when I come to Sanya next year. In particular, I would like to praise the housekeeper, Little Sun, who is very thoughtful and enthusiastic!

It's not close to the beach, but it's very convenient to go to the beach, and there is also a private beach.
Walking to Baihua Valley, shopping and eating are convenient. It is also convenient to order takeout.
The key is that the house is big enough, a family of six lives in a supreme swimming pool with three bedrooms, three rooms, a living room, a terrace, a swimming pool, and a separate kitchen. It feels like a vacation. No other house has such a big villa. I booked half a month in advance and the price is good. Affordable and comfortable.

msg:I booked for 4 nights. Overall experience. Personally, I feel that this room type is not suitable for parent-child travel. The room facilities are generally complaining about the TV. The first night TV can only watch one station in the middle of the night. It will automatically turn on and turn off automatically and then restart a dozen times. After the switch is turned on, the shutdown is ended, which seriously affects sleep and can't afford to bring children to live. The second night today, after repairing it during the day, it was still unsuccessful. It took more than 5 times to actually turn off the TV. It was also drunk. The second is that the shower hot water needs to wait for a few minutes for a long time, and it is very hot after it is hot. I adjusted it many times, and the second is that the swimming pool is still quite big. It is not comfortable to shave your feet on the bottom of the pool. The mosquito nets pulled off the black slag and came down. It is really a place that is not very comfortable, and I feel that everything else is wrong. Today is the second night. At night, there are a lot of small ants and flying insects on the bed. After telling the waiter to deal with the change of the sheets, it is very timely and likes. There is a shortage of rooms now, otherwise I would ask for a replacement. I didn't give away the fruit basket today. I gave the fruit basket on the first night. I sent a fruit basket once a night. I didn't care about the little things... The overall experience is average. Maybe the room type is not suitable or this is a small problem. Let me experience more. Hope that the small problems of the facilities can be improved a lot.

msg:I don't recommend you to come here
First of all, the so-called pool villa is actually sharing a villa and swimming pool with five households. Each household has a very simple glass door.
No privacy and security at all
The sound insulation is also very poor. We have to rest after 10 o'clock. People in other rooms are still playing in the pool.
Secondly, every room in the hotel has a very strong musty smell. The equipment is also very old. the bed is very close
In the end, when I went to bed at night, there was always a rustling sound in the room, much like the sound of insects. I didn't sleep well all night, and it was very noisy outside in the morning
The worst hotel to stay in Sanya
It is recommended that you choose other hotels. There are many, many hotels on this street.

Renovating? Is this coming for a holiday or a construction site? It feels like a farmhouse, maybe not as good.

Although the water in the swimming pool is salvaged every day, the water is basically not changed, which is quite different from the environment in the picture. Overall it's ok.

msg:After changing several Yalong Bay hotels, I still feel that Villa No. 5 is good. The architectural style is a bit like Bali, and the rooms are a bit quaint. It feels natural, relaxing, and more private. The waiter has a very good attitude and there is no phenomenon of slaughtering customers. I heard from my son that his pig hand fairy chicken is delicious. There is a typhoon when it rains in Sanya recently. I kind of like the typhoon weather. Friends who plan to come to Sanya can prepare umbrellas and raincoats to experience what a typhoon in Sanya looks like.

msg:As the last stop of the National Day trip, we chose to book Villa No. 5 with a quiet environment and perfect service. The biggest highlight of the hotel is the single-family villas, single-door, single-yard, independent swimming pool, split room design, even if a family lives in a large villa, they will not disturb each other because of different work and rest habits. Because we have few people, we chose to stay in the view room on the edge of the lobby this time. The rooms are well laid out, well-sized, and have balconies. The last two days of the holiday need to adjust both physically and mentally. All those who did not choose to go out to play, stayed in the hotel all day. In the leisure time on the balcony, watching the wind and clouds moving from a distance, listening to the drizzle silently, it is very pleasant. Although the hotel is not close to the sea, it has its own exclusive beach access, and it is only a 35-minute walk to the beach. Children's shoes who want to take beautiful photos are equipped with a glass boat (required to rent) in the hotel's infinity pool. That is a ****.

The housekeeper Xiao Cai’s service during his stay is very considerate. As a second-line hotel in Yalong Bay, he travels to and from the beach. There are battery cars to pick up and drop off, and the hotel has an exclusive beach 🏖️, it is very recommended to stay.

msg:It's really hard to describe this hotel. Overall, I was very disappointed. Let's talk about what happened after checking out. When we checked out on October 6, the hotel sent a text message saying that we had consumed a bottle of mineral water, but at that time we had already moved to Tianyu. I was with my child and didn't see the text message at all. I saw it on October 8 and argued with the hotel. I had read many people's comments before and knew that the hotel water was very expensive. There were many disputes before. As soon as we entered the door and waited for cleaning, we took care of our family members not to touch the charged water, so no one in the family touched the water. But the hotel later confirmed that we had unscrewed the bottle cap but didn't drink it, but the whole family had never touched the charged water. If this really happened, it was unscrewed before. Since we didn't touch the water, we naturally didn't think of checking whether the water was opened. We just reminded the next guests that they need to be extra careful and check carefully whether the water has been opened when checking in. Okay, let's talk about how the hotel handled it. The hotel said it would verify and added WeChat. In the end, it refunded 20 yuan for a bottle of water, but it was helpless. It seemed like we were tasting their water. It was very unpleasant. We felt like we were being scammed. Ctrip's handling of the matter was quite satisfactory. When the hotel refused, Ctrip paid first, saying that Ctrip believed in its guests. I think I have stayed in quite a few hotels. After all, I have been a Marriott Platinum member for many years. This is the first time I have encountered such a thing handled by a hotel. Although the refund was finally made, the guests felt very bad. Okay, now I will review the hotel. The review was written before I encountered the above incident. I submitted it once when Ctrip gave the hotel NPS score. What happened afterwards has nothing to do with my mood. It was the experience of staying at that time.

Overall, the hotel is relatively quiet and suitable for vacation without children. The infinity pool is not bad, you can fish, and the price is reasonable at 30 yuan/hour, which is much more suitable than the Liangantang in Shanghai, and the scenery is much better. The following is what was submitted before:

1. The three-bedroom villa we booked was upgraded to a four-bedroom villa with one empty room, which had more space. However, we found that although this four-bedroom villa had a very small swimming pool, even the lounge chairs could only be placed in a corner, facing the pile of trees and not facing the swimming pool. The swimming pool of the three-bedroom villa opposite was actually larger. Later, we could see from the hotel subway that the so-called upgraded room type had a small swimming pool, and the extra room had no function. Information asymmetry deceived customers.
2. Arrived at the hotel at 3:50, the room had not been cleaned yet, and they said we could go in first, but the uncleaned villa was really terrible. On the first floor, the cleaning staff piled up a lot of garbage, and there was a foul smell of garbage. The stairs were also full of cigarettes and garbage. After the aunt cleaned it, the toilet in room 1873 was still dirty and had sand. It was obvious that it had not been wiped. I couldn't rush to the toilet, so I had to clean it myself.
3. We stayed for three days in total. We saw a tea table in the villa, so we asked if the hotel provided tea sets. The hotel said no, which was strange. There was a table but no tea sets. Anyway, we found cups in the hotel. When we pulled the drawer in the kitchen cabinet, we saw a cockroach. Please see the photo. The tray was full of cockroach feces, which showed that it was not one or two days.
4. Let's talk about the room type. There are three floors in total. The furniture on the first floor is very simple. There are three standard rooms on the second floor. The size of room 1871 is normal. Rooms 1873 and 1872 are very small. Room 1873 has a peculiar smell. The third floor is the master bedroom. The area is OK, but the window is very small. Looking down is the roof of the second floor, and there is the eaves of the entire villa above. You can't see anything and the view is very small. However, many room types are not like this. It can be seen that the so-called upgrade of the hotel is very pitfall, and I am not the only one who comments like this.
5. Let's continue with the supplies. As everyone said, the shampoo and shower gel are two-in-one wall-mounted luxury. It is a bit unbelievable to see this in a resort hotel, but fortunately, I read the comments and knew that the hotel supplies were poor, so I brought supplies from other hotels from home. Children's supplies are very incomplete. They can only provide children's bathrobes and plastic slippers, and the soles are dirty. There are no children's toothbrushes or toiletries. The front desk told me that our hotel does not accommodate parent-child groups and does not have these things.
6. Well, what are you doing with your kids? There is basically nothing to do. The swimming pool in the villa is small, dirty, and the water is cold. It is basically impossible to swim. The children's activity room, even my three-year-old child said it was a ** activity room, which shows that there is nothing to play. I want to go to Tianyu to play, but the management of Tianyu Hotel is still very good, and I can't get it. I can only wait until I check in later.
7. Go to the beach, change cars twice, first call the front desk from the room to call a car to the gate, get off, and then ask the security guard at the gate to call a car to the beach, change to an electric car to the beach, of course you have to wait for many people, you have to wait for the car before and after, there is no car after 6 o'clock from the beach, you can walk back by yourself, it is not too far, the children walk a little slowly.
8. The beach of Villa No. 5 does not provide bath towels, but the room does, you need to bring them there and back.
9. I haven't finished staying yet, and I will talk about the rest of the experience later. So far, I am still very dissatisfied. If I book Yalong Bay next time, I will probably not come again.

There are many beach chairs on the beach. It is also very clear. The sea in Yalong Bay is indeed great. The waves hit over and the shells and sand under the waves are visible to the naked eye. The hotel environment is also great, and the greening is very good. All in all, this price is great value.

msg:The whole hotel is very scary. It's really scary at night, especially dark. The facilities in the room are really too old, and there is a musty smell. The hotel should know this and cover it up with a heavy fragrance. The beach is far away. The hotel has a battery car that can be delivered, but I think it loses the meaning of going to Sanya, and its home is not cheap. You can go to the opposite side to live in Tianyu, MGM, and Marriott, but the hotel's battery car service is really good. Just call and pick it up ,deliver.
The front desk needs a deposit, which doesn't matter, but the check-in and check-out are really super full. It's the information age. I stayed in Sanya for more than 20 days and stayed in five hotels. His family is the slowest.

It allows me to temporarily escape the hustle and bustle of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, blocking the cumbersome work and life, and enjoy a fresh and elegant tranquility with my girlfriend, allowing the sun to touch the freely beating heart, and completely clear all the worries and distracting thoughts...

In the evening, I participated in the hotel "Land Lantern" to send Mid-Autumn Festival blessings to relatives and friends...

The beach is very clean, with few tourists, walking on the fine sand, watching the sea, the breeze blowing on my face, refreshing and pleasant... I would like to thank the hotel beach lifeguard, the scorching sun above my head, facing the wind and waves, and helping me find the mobile phone that was swept away by the big waves. .

msg:Staying at Yalong Bay No. 5 for the first time, I personally feel that the environment, service, and rooms are all very good. The hotel butler will contact the hotel in advance to confirm the arrival itinerary. The reception staff are enthusiastic, active and youthful. The decoration of the rooms is simple and low-key, but without losing the charm. The natural ecological garden design makes you feel like you are in Southeast Asia without going abroad. The official cuisine of the Chinese restaurant is one of the best in the Bay. The hotel is very close to the surrounding tourist attractions and commercial streets, and it is also very convenient to walk to Yalong Bay Beach. Due to the climate in Hainan, whether it is just getting off the plane or entering the hotel room, there will be a slight damp sensation, but this sensation will disappear immediately after turning on the air conditioning in the room. This trip was staying in a poolside room on the first floor. Open the door and you can see the swimming pool. After check-in, the children are not soaking in the pool all the time, and crying not to go home when checking out. In order to satisfy the children's wishes, see you next time on the 5th.

Every employee encountered on the road will greet you enthusiastically. The hotel environment is really good. Walking in the hotel park is like walking in your own community. It feels like home. During my stay, I saw a gecko with a "tiger" discoloration in other people's comments. This little guy, a tiger-headed tiger-brained, is so cute. Just click on Baidu. The gecko is not only not aggressive, but also a mosquito-eater. No wonder, the park has such a good greening. There are no mosquitoes in the room.

        I booked a four-day poolside room. There is an episode about the poolside room check-in. The front desk said that the poolside room cannot be connected, so I and my daughter were upgraded to suites. I went to see the room. My 7-year-old daughter In any case, I did not agree to live in a suite. The front desk made several calls and coordinated a poolside room. When I arrived at the poolside room, my daughter liked it very much, but the poolside room was brighter and more convenient.
        The breakfast is very good and rich in variety. It is really enjoyable to sit by the lake and have breakfast. I went to the restaurant once, the price is not cheap, but the taste is good.
        In addition, the attitudes of the waiters were very good, and they were delayed until two o'clock on the last day.
        All in all, No. 5 is cost-effective and comfortable and down to earth. Next year, No. 5 will be your first choice for your summer vacation.

The waiters are also very enthusiastic. Whether it is the beautiful environment or the leisure fish, people can't help but forget the time, slow down and enjoy life quietly!

msg:I didn't live in Yalong Bay before in Sanya, so I decided to choose Yalong Bay Villa 5 this time! First of all, it is very close to the beach and within walking distance, and the price of Villa No. 5 is relatively close to the people in the first-line sea view of Yalong Bay. It is very convenient to eat in several food courts around! Then talk about the interior of the hotel. The pure villa-style hotel has good greenery, quiet and comfortable, and is very friendly to children who like the swimming pool. The hotel staff are very warm and friendly, especially Huang Yunying Manager Huang Yunying Manager Huang Yunying Manager of the Housekeeping Depar**ent! People are super nice! Very attentive! Knowing that we take the children to explain the sanitation of the guest rooms to be cleaner and tidy! And also gave us a free upgrade of the room type, the room children love it! Have a great time! Sister Zhen and Zixin from the housekeeping depar**ent have worked hard! Clean the room every day, and the bed sheets are also changed every day! Staying for 7 nights, it was comfortable enough to make our family of three feel at home hahahaha 😄The day before the last check-out, Manager Huang Yunying also asked us if we need a late check-out package breakfast, etc., it is really super warm Heart! ❤️Oh, by the way, the hotel’s breakfast is very rich, with a combination of Chinese and Western, and it’s hardly repeated every day to be particularly full. In the end, this time I had a super fun 🥳! Next time I bring all the children, I will continue to choose Villa 5! Still looking for manager Huang Yunying ah ha ha ha 😆

Although I live in a villa, each room has its own bathroom and door lock, which is very private. During check-in and check-out, I happened to ran into the same little brother Xiaoan at the front desk, and he was also very nice. He saw that some of us gave children gifts. The housekeeper, Sun Sun, is also very active and responsible. If you have any questions, you will always answer and solve them as soon as possible. My friends said that I made a good reservation and will come to this place next time.

The small details of the room also have a sense of design and natural beauty.
Finally, the most important thing is that one hundred meters away is the beach.

It is the best hotel I have stayed in Sanya these few days. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good, the shuttle bus is very timely so it is more convenient, and the parking is also convenient. The coconut chicken tastes good. The waiter is still very good when I booked to eat late at the restaurant. Everyone is praised. Xiao Zhang at the front desk also gave a souvenir. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here again. Very recommended!

msg:The university roommate raided Sanya and specially booked the hotel he had stayed in to entertain him. The family of three students was very satisfied after they moved in. Praise the hotel environment and service are particularly good, the public swimming pool downstairs is great for swimming or taking pictures. Before picking them up and checking out, I specially visited the villa types. Each villa has a private parking space, so you can drive directly to the door of the villa without any worries. The two people have negotiated. Next holiday, they will bring their family together and rent a big villa. After all, the villa is a product promoted by his family. It is said that many celebrities have also stayed in this hotel. The hotel is very convenient to the beach, there is a car to and from the hotel, and it takes only three to five minutes to walk. The hotel is surrounded by a commercial street, which is especially convenient for eating and shopping. You can also reserve the shuttle bus and discounts at Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop the next day before 19:00 a day in advance to enjoy shopping.

Standing on the balcony of the room, you can overlook the mountains not far away. It is said to be the Yalong Bay Forest Park. It can be said to be straightforward and hearty! In front of a rippling lake and surrounded by greenery, the hotel villas are looming, really beautiful! The waiter is still so enthusiastic and caring, knowing that I like to watch football games, suggest that I go to the lobby bar to watch the European Cup on the big screen, and there is also a lottery. The breakfast is plentiful, and I can’t help but overeat. It seems that the weight loss plan is going through the water again... Not enough for one night, and the big swimming pool hasn’t had time to experience it? Leave a little regret, come next time!

The entire yard is full of winding paths, and the villa area is too big. Even the trip requires a battery transfer. Special thanks to Xiao Cheng and Xiao Qiao from the concierge depar**ent. Because we took our children, we went in and out all day, thanks to two handsome guys for their help. And I feel very loving here. Thank you for the fruit plates and cakes you sent on your child’s birthday, which gave the child an unexpected surprise and was extremely happy. I am also very grateful to Xiao Huang from the housekeeping depar**ent, because the house with the baby will be messy, but every day when we return to the residence, it is clean and tidy. The hard work Xiao Huang has always given us a comfortable environment.
I really enjoy the feeling these days. I not only like the climate of Sanya, but also the environment of No.5. I like the a**osphere more. It is recommended to check in Sanya No.5!

酒店到cdf免税城的車需要提前一天預約，最早9:30，返程最早15:30，還是很方便的。

msg:這次來三亞玩住在五號別墅，體驗感特別好，別墅內環境非常好，酒店內處處是風景，隨手一拍即是美照。很有度假的感覺，住着非常舒適。工作人員也很熱情，特別特別喜歡酒店的工作人員姜瑞小美女，她是賓客的姜姜，超級超級喜歡她。從選酒店開始，到最後的預訂，每次遇見問題都會打電話問酒店前台，每次都是姜瑞幫我細心的解答，人美心善，也正是因為她，我入住的體驗感超級棒，下車去三亞還會住五號別墅。推薦大家入住五號別墅。

  本次住宿讓人感到温暖的是前台一個叫雪兒女孩的貼心服務。我家孩子的梳粧鏡遺漏在房間，車已出發很遠無法返回，雪兒一遍遍電話聯繫和確認郵寄地址。實際上鏡子並不值錢，而是真誠的服務打動了我們。以後每次看到那麪鏡子，就引發我們美好的回憶。謝謝5號別墅酒店的“一家親”服務理念，願酒店和雪兒的事業蒸蒸日上。

服務：以酒店自居，但服務跟正規酒店比較相差甚遠，感覺管理欠缺不細緻。
環境：室外每晚都有青蛙叫，根本睡不好。因為是從攜程預訂，提前退房不給退錢，所以無法更換其他酒店，衹能硬扛了幾天，跟星級酒店對比各方面都有差距。

msg:前台很不專業、態度很差。主要體現在：
1.訂好房間早上7:30到店，跟我説查不到訂單，拿走我的手機看我手機訂單詳情看半天，2個前台一起看也找不到。我表示8點計劃要出發，前台訂單沒找到算了，居然説先登記入住….真是耽誤時間，我回來再登記也行吧！
2.計劃改變續住一晚，換房卡的時候，2個女前台跟我説房間帶雙早，因為我們是三個人入住，我還溝通了下要不要加1早。結果第二天去餐廳的時候，説我們房間不含早，甚至問我當時説含早的是誰，長啥樣，就差沒問我名字叫啥了吧！莫名其妙！
房間設施：
太舊太臟太差，沒有mini吧，啥也沒有哈，沙發椅子上面的灰一層層，一股老頭臭。舊可以接受，臭接受不了不好意思，好歹也是個五星。

當然差評並不影響人家生意，該住的還是會住。

首先，房子超級老舊，跟90年代的招待所一樣。空調響得跟抽風機一樣！根本沒辦法睡覺。房間隔音超級差，還沒遇上吵鬧的孩子，就隔壁正常的説話聲音，都聽得一清二楚。一次性牙刷居然掉毛。更奇葩的是，酒店早上9點不到就開始在樓下割草。
二，早餐品種超級少，麪包沒有現做的，住過三亞很多五星級，居然這家連現磨咖啡也沒有。孩子吃的泡牛奶的甜甜圈，第三天早餐居然沒有了，變成了葡萄乾。酒店也沒有任何親子活動。
三，房間衞生每天就是簡單的拖地，其他一律不管，以前住梅高美，連充電器都幫你收得整整齊齊。服務員也沒有任何歡迎笑臉和打招呼。
四，這個是最不人性的。住了3晚，遇上了飛機航變，改到了晚上7點55，所有早於這個時間的飛機都沒票了，帶着孩子，天氣又熱，想讓酒店延遲到4點退房，死命都不肯。問有沒有休息室，因為天域鉑爾曼香格里拉等等都有，結果酒店也沒有。問那有沒有鐘點房，也沒有。衹能花324訂半天房。查了今天的價格，一晚才524，延長2小時，非要加收324。沒辦法，為了孩子舒服，最後衹好花324加了2小時。

酒店離沙灘也非常近，隔一條馬路就可以到海邊，交通便利，環境舒適，確實不錯。。

msg:17年春節來的時候感覺不錯，這次來就又定了這個酒店，但整體感覺和第一次來時候差太多。首先是前台的服務意識不強，而且不會靈活變通。前幾天住了海棠灣的仁恆，checkin時候那裡小姐姐會把所有項目活動都介紹一下，但是住這邊的時候啥東西也不説，服務員全程撲克臉。
設施：比較陳舊，這幾年可能沒保養好。一樓部分門窗是關不上的；房間內的廁所還有瓷磚都有黑乎乎一團團的污垢
衞生：別墅裏的餐廳有一股黴味，臭臭的
服務：基本無服務。以前早餐在中心區域池塘那，現在換到室內，吃的東西少了好多。
反正以後不會再來這個酒店踩坑了

略有問題的是酒店年限太老了，很多設施都需要更新，特別是空調，直接沖床，幾個晚上都沒休息好，開了太冷，孩子容易感冒。
關了太熱，無語😓。
早餐感覺不如以前，尤其是西點，不是新做的。

酒店設施還行，比較乾淨，不過裝飾的風格稍微老了一點，不過還行。房間燈光有點暗，建議可以調亮一下。可以增加2個沙灘椅。有個打坐的墊子，感覺看起來不是很乾凈，應該使用率較低。總體説了還是可以推薦情侶出行，居家出行。走到沙灘也很近，幾分鐘就到。院子私密性很強。之前在萬豪，美高梅跟5號之間糾結了很久。對比亞龍灣一線海景酒店，設施差一點，但是獨享祕境。針對不一樣的需求，可以安需選擇。

msg:第一次入住五號別墅，交通便利，環境不錯，一個個的別墅羣分落於不同區域。早餐品種一般，口味更是奇怪。想着房價不高，倒也能接受。入住以後一直沒有管家。期間有兩個不滿意的地方，一個是衞生間馬桶座圈比馬桶小了幾圈，坐上去直接接觸到馬桶底座，非常不衞生。另一個是被不知名蟲子咬了，腫了一大片。到前台反映，前台小姐姐冷漠白眼，敷衍了事，真是氣死到再也不願意入住。後來坐電瓶車回房間路上，隨口嘟囔了幾聲，被司機小哥聽到，立馬錶示幫我反映問題。隨後客房中心黃桂到房間解決問題，耐心解釋，又送上了水果和風油精，細心周到，讓我感受到了温暖。還有一個司機小哥也值得稱讚，第一天辦理入住後，坐電瓶車到達別墅門口，司機小哥表示要提行李到房間，由於自帶有車，行李還要卸下來，我們就讓司機小哥去送別的客人了。正卸着行李，司機小哥送完客人又專門回來，幫忙把兩個行李箱提到二樓，還交代了注意事項，非常貼心。

酒店整體類似花園，裡邊到處都是植物感覺很熱帶。裡邊隨處可見的工作人員見面都會很友好的向你招手問候，關鍵是他們工作人員自己互相之間也會這樣打招呼，讓人覺得很親切。
酒店內部有車可以接送到房間，入住後兩天開車的服務員都認識我們了不用説就知道是哪個房間
酒店也有車可以送到海邊，但是我們沒有做過因為時間總是不對，走路大概7、8分鐘也能到還算比較近
周邊吃飯的地方也比較多，走路都可以達到

我對這間酒店的好感源自於他們的服務，工作人員大多很年輕，略帶有一絲青澀的感覺，管家小太陽、禮賓部的小耀、小沐都讓我感到非常的熱情周到，還有餐廳的幾位小姑娘表現的都非常具有親和力，服務意識上佳！
然後雖然房間設施有些陳舊，但都不影響使用，別墅前都有小型泳池，不想去公共泳池的就門前泡泡吧。
本人喜歡各種植物，酒店內外不少沒見過的品種，養護的不錯！

msg:主要是四個家庭出遊，訂的四卧室別墅！
首先表揚下管家：小太陽，非常客氣，服務周到！
酒店優點：1.市區，方便吃飯，適合家庭，人多；2.別墅空間很大，符合人多需求；3.帶泳池；4.管家反饋很及時；5.性價比還行，大概5000+一晚/4居，國慶期間還湊合。
酒店吐槽點：1.衞生，衞生，衞生，不知道是不是十一人多，標榜五星，衞生卻是出奇的差，泳池幾天沒有打掃，後面幾天根本不想下水，泳池地面上的設施也是臟兮兮的，照片為證（圖4），房間衞生衹能説得過去，窗簾不知道是老舊還是臟，反正不敢靠近；2.設施老舊，大門後門栓掉了，淋浴房淋蓬頭架子壞的，泳池上的躺椅和涼亭更是很臟很舊，壓根不敢坐；3.打掃人員不敲門，我坐在客廳，門被突然打開，也不敲門，而且來回多次，均忽略裏面坐了一個人；4.酒店咖啡，兑水太嚴重，喝不出咖啡味，有時候還供應不及時；5.安保不到位，人員進出壓根不管理，車輛進出也衹是測體温，不符合五星標準！6.牙刷掉毛，刷兩下一嘴毛。洗浴用品壓根不知名，也不敢用；7.沒有小童設施，全靠自己帶，太累。

出門不管遠近，都隨時有電瓶車來接送。房內乾淨衞生。唯一的缺點就是，房間很大，各個房間包括客廳其實都可以放點免費的礦泉水，就很方便了。總之是不錯的一段旅程。

msg:這個酒店很不錯，尤其是別墅風格，當初在網上選了很久，一眼就看中這個酒店，在城市生活太久了，非常喜歡這種別墅風格的酒店，而且還有獨立泳池。酒店有隨叫隨停的電瓶車直接送到門口，整個風格很有自然氣息，很適合度假。早餐的話我感覺是中規中矩，還算豐富，每天換菜品不重複，挺好的。唯一有點不方便的是網速有一點慢，打開視頻有點不夠用了。不過因為是別墅酒店，外面蚊蟲比較多，入住記得做好驅蚊，總體很不錯，在亞龍灣附近算性價比很高的了，有機會建議去體驗下。酒店的小太陽、小程服務都很好，在我們入住前就及時溝通聯繫，並提供服務。在此點個贊！

msg:位置交通：
不是坐擁一線海景的酒店，但位置也還算便利，走走三五分鐘可到中心廣場和公共海灘。

服務：
酒店的禮賓阿榮蠻熱情的，會介紹當地的吃喝玩樂，推薦的海鮮加工市場，真心不錯，承包了我們近四天的晚餐[調皮]

餐廳：
這邊用了一餐中飯，味道沒什麼好挑剔的，就是上菜是真心慢，而且我們入住第一天去餐廳看菜單的時候也沒説還有服務費，第二天用餐的時候才説，而且還説成了30%，實際15%……

房間設施：
我們去的是淡季，給免費升了主卧，放假夠大，性價比還不錯。除了每幢別墅有自己的小泳池和公共客廳外，酒店的無邊泳池也不錯，view很好，靜謐的感覺！

就是隱祕性不太好，隔音不太好，第一天有幾家有小朋友的家庭，真夠吵的。後來換了鄰居稍微好點
酒店設施挺好的，由於離門口有點距離，每次叫電瓶車，還是服務很到位的

msg:酒店是全別墅類型。本次預訂兩居室泳池別墅，酒店給到的是6居別墅，關閉了4間。別墅並無獨立院子，泳池小，而且衞生條件差。大家可以理解酒店為多個獨棟的小樓，如果預訂普通房間，就一個一個房間分開提供，如果預訂整棟就把空閑的房間鎖閉。各個房間分佈於不同樓層 並無連通公共區域。所以，兩居別墅相當於兩間普通房間，外加位於一樓和頂樓的客廳，利用價值不高。
另一方面，酒店已經年久失修，設施極其陳舊，完全無法匹配五星級的標準。衞生間玻璃水漬顯得很臟，窗簾發黴。
房型適合多家人聯合出行，不適合一家人出行。
酒店距離海邊還有一定距離，去海邊也不太方便，建議首選海邊海景酒店。
總體上實際品質完全與定位不匹配，修繕維護情況差，大家謹慎預訂。
