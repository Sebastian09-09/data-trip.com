msg:Great experience. Service was perfect. Yanqi Lake Boutique Hotels, managed by Kempinski are impeccable. My family stayed two nights. I've booked two rooms. One single bed and one twin beds room. Rooms were modern, clean and spacious. Clean sheets and comfortable beds. I was surprised how big and clean rooms where. Toilets were clean and specious. What you see on the pictures is what you get. More than I’ve expected. Food was perfect.  We had buffet breakfast and we could choose between western food and Chinese food. For diner we eat at the restaurant and the food we ordered was delicious. Lots of things to do around. You can visit Hongluo Temple, Mutianyu Great Wall or you can walk around hotel area and see the Yanqi Pagoda or visit International Conference Center (APEC and Belt and Road Initiative conferences were held there, and it was nice experience to visit the place where most powerful leaders in the world seated and planed the future of the world). All in all, great experience. Special thanks to Shirley Le, duty manager and to June Jian for the warm reception and their hospitality. If you want to relax and clear your mind and body I recommend Yanqi Lake Boutique Hotels, managed by Kempinski.

The front desk staff is enthusiastic and professional, and our group had a very pleasant stay at Yanqi Hotel!

In addition, the hotel's garden is comparable to the green landscape of any park and is very beautiful.

Looking forward to staying at Yanqi Hotel again.

msg:My husband and I left our baby for a date and booked Yanqi Hotel on the spur of the moment. We were super satisfied!
Room: We originally booked a villa room, but after we arrived, they upgraded us to a room with a balcony in the main building. The room was very large and comfortable. A breastfeeding mother really hasn't slept so comfortably for a long time, hahaha! I specially checked that the bathroom was Villeroy & Boch, and my impression of it was up!
Environment: The entire Yanqi Island is the hotel area. It is very quiet and the environment is also very good. It feels a bit like an island resort hotel. In the afternoon, I rented a double bicycle and rode around. 150 was a bit expensive, but I was very happy. Then I got up in the morning and ran around the island, which was super comfortable.
Restaurant: There are two restaurants, one Chinese and one Western. On the first night, I had Cantonese cuisine at Guanlanxuan Chinese Restaurant. The three-piece roast meat and dry fried beef noodles were absolutely delicious, and the dishes were also quite large. Breakfast was buffet at Tianshui Pavilion Western Restaurant. There were many kinds of Chinese and Western food, and the standard of a five-star hotel was ordinary and delicious hahaha. Breadhead ate almost every kind of bread, happy!
Swimming pool: There are very few people in the gym and it closes at 10 pm. We went for a swim at around 9 o'clock and left at 10 o'clock, almost delaying the staff from getting off work. The swimming pool is not bad, and it is also the level of most five-star hotels. There is a small hot spring pool next to it, so you can soak in it after swimming.
Parent-child facilities: We didn't bring our baby this time, but we visited the children's park. There is a big bubble pool and a big slide. It feels more suitable for babies over 1 year old. I met a lot of children in the hotel~
The hotel gave red wine when I checked out. In short, I was very satisfied with this trip. I will go again with my baby in autumn!

Disadvantages: The location of the room is not very good, next to the plumbing equipment room, and you can see a little bit of the lake from the balcony. Maybe because there are many cars on holidays, there is a phenomenon of random parking on the ground outside the parking spaces. I hope to strengthen management.

Yanqi Guobin Villa is located on Yanqi Island, across the lake from Sunrise Oriental Hotel. The privacy of the park is very high, and you will have a unique experience after moving in. The 12 villas are surrounded by the main building, which is very quiet. The dining is in the main building, and there is a concierge service to pick up and drop off, which is very convenient. Afternoon tea, Chinese restaurant and breakfast are exquisite and taste great. In addition, there are reservation services for visiting the APEC meeting site and Yanqi Tower, where you can experience the diplomacy of major powers and see the scenery of Yanqi. The light show at night is another scene.

The experience was not only luxurious, but Warm service, rich and colorful breakfast, juices with several flavors, dishes, and desserts are all my favorites. The afternoon tea is also great. You can take it to your room in a package. The landscaping is really great. I’m preparing for autumn. Come and stay for a few more days to see how the fruits in the park are ripening!

msg:The experience is very average. It is the Kempinski Hotel. It has no special features. The villa area is not open. I spent 2k to arrange ordinary rooms with almost no view. Since it is the off-season, I specifically asked the front desk to see if the arrangement could be better. The view of the room ended up giving the most corners nothing to see. The Chinese restaurant is okay, the breakfast is so-so, the room temperature is a bit low, and the swimming pool water quality is average. Due to the cold and snowy weather, there was almost no scenery to see in the hotel park. Overall, it's quite boring. It's better to stay at Sunrise Oriental Hotel. Maybe you can enjoy the view from the room.

The reason I stated: The area was slightly upgraded. How should I put it? First of all, I didn’t ask for anyone’s consent, which is very rude. Secondly, this reason is really far-fetched... In fact, we stayed until departure on Monday. There were few guests in the villa and the service cost was high, so the hotel made the change without authorization. It’s considered a lack of martial ethics. If the cost is too high, it is recommended that the store closes the reservation channel.

The environment is very good in Beijing, even if it is raining, there is an artistic conception.
The living space is not large, and the car can drive directly downstairs.
The restaurant's dinner is not expensive compared to the room price, which is pretty good.
Breakfast is the level of a 4 star hotel.

Yanqi Island is surrounded by Yanqi Lake, with 12 villas and a main building. There is also the conference center and Yanqi Pagoda, and the sunrise in the distance is across the lake from the east. The natural environment is very good, the maintenance is even more orderly, and Kempinski's service is even more unremarkable. Late autumn is the best time.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the lady at the front desk for helping to upgrade to the hotel room for free. At the same time, we also encountered unhappy things. We arrived at the store at one o'clock in the afternoon. It was raining outside and there were a lot of people in the lobby, but we were told that the room was not cleaned up. Let us wait. At the same time, we were not sure when there would be a room. We took the old man and the child and waited a little anxiously. The child started crying. The moment the child backed back, his head hit the corner of the metal table, and a big bag was lifted. I became angry. Then the room was immediately available. The staff explained to me that it was temporarily helping to coordinate a room, and at the same time sending ice packs to the children. I can't say anything at this point, but the room I checked in was the lady at the front desk at the beginning The room number on the order given to me, I don't know what the starting point of the business is to deal with in this way. Objectively speaking, the environment outside the hotel is indeed very good, the facilities in the rooms are quite complete, and the breakfast is relatively rich. However, the dishonest operation of the business made me feel very reluctant. The main theme is parent-child. I saw that the corners of many countertops in the restaurant are pasted with anti-collision *****s. There are so many children in the hotel lobby. Why is there no thorough consideration of safety facilities? The child told me today: Mommy, my back is not good. I just remembered to give a comment. I hope that the business can do a thorough security check. I also hope that the business can empathize and treat every customer sincerely. Don't be blind to such good hardware.

msg:For the Mid-Autumn Festival, moderate rain and 7.8 strong winds ~ ready for the mental construction of a large number of people and all kinds of things and so on! It turned out that it arrived at one o'clock at noon. When I arrived at the front desk, I didn't even wait for it! The little girl who raised her hand was warmly received (seems like Zhao, thin and thin with glasses, speaking softly) and inquired about the order. I put forward the type of room I needed. The little girl tried very hard to find a room and told me to take the child. I found a villa close to the main building without waiting for a room! ! What a surprise! No need to wait for holidays! After opening the room card, I took the hotel map and explained the location of the room and various activities! Very good 👍🏻 I am very happy to bring the children in. When I arrived at Villa No. 5 (the villa closest to the breakfast in the main building), the butler is a thin gentleman (skin is healthy and dark), very, very enthusiastic! ! It was very nice from getting off the bus to entering the room! And every time I go out and pass by, I don’t just stand up and greet, but trot to help open the door~ it’s great! ! thank you very much. The overall scenery of the hotel is beautiful and there are few people! It is suitable for bringing children (mainly you can ride bicycles in it, and now major parks do not allow children to ride bicycles). The experience is good and worth recommending!

msg:There are more people but better than other hotels. Apart from the main building, the hotel has 12 villas. It is said that the villas are actually 12 small buildings. We are still relatively close to the main building. Apart from eating, we need to walk to the main building. In a few minutes, everything else is pretty good, and other buildings far away are estimated to have to call a car to pick you up for dinner. The scenery of the park is particularly good. The carefully designed gardens are really out of the picture! It is much more beautiful than Yanqi Lake Park. There are two western restaurants and Chinese restaurants for dinner. The Chinese restaurant is Cantonese cuisine and the taste is good, but the price is not cheap. The western restaurant is a buffet, which is relatively rich. many. The service staff is very good, and I am willing to go next time.

The corridor lights are not bright, and the sauna room cannot be used. The front desk introduced the details but did not introduce the facilities when checking in the villa. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good, but when I booked a meal time with the front desk in advance, I didn't actually reserve a seat, and I ended up sitting in an area similar to the storage room. Objectively speaking, the hotel is good overall, but the villas are low cost performance.

The legs of the bathroom cannot be stretched out, the water in the shower room overflows, and the door of the large closet cannot be closed. I heard that this was for the leaders of various countries back then. Even the African chiefs dislike it at this level! Moreover, the villa is 2 miles away from the main building, and it is troublesome to drive back and forth. Kempinski's service is not bad, but it is a pity that the level of hardware is worth more than 2,000 prices?

From the security of the entrance to the park, the front desk to the restaurant and cleaning services, the sense of service is not very good. Maybe it is either negligent or purely without systematic training. The management staff in the lobby of Villa No. 5, which is thinner from the northeast, is extremely enthusiastic, and one person raises the overall service level.

msg:入住之前抱有很大期待，但結果不盡人意，服務和管理很不給力。
1.入住當天是孩子爸爸生日，提前聯繫酒店佈置房間，辦理入住的時候，服務員和我確認了過生日的人，特意告訴我哪個房間是我們的，哪個房間是長者的。等進入房間一看，長者的房間有生日蛋糕和佈置。。
2.入住當晚洗澡發現浴缸沒有熱水，叫來工程人員修理，為了不影響寶寶休息，我帶着孩子去長者房間洗的澡。。
3.入住當晚洗澡淋浴房漏水，從淋浴房漏到了衞生間，為了防止夜裡去衞生間滑倒，叫來了服務員打掃乾淨。因為已經是晚上10點半，要求第二天再來修理或者修不好換房間。第二天沒有任何人聯繫我們，以為已經修好了，結果洗完澡漏水更厲害，漏到了衣帽間。孩子爸爸摔了一跤，還挺嚴重。我們要求酒店有相應的合理賠償，一直拖到14日上午10點要退房才勉強解決。期間一直是我們給酒店人員打電話催進度。
4.酒店內部管理界限感特別強烈，13日晚上下雨，我到主樓借傘，門口的門僮讓我找前台，前台讓我找禮賓部，禮賓部最後給我一把傘。這3位酒店人員相隔不到2米，互相不説話，讓客人跑來跑去借傘。如果是忙碌的時間本人也能理解，問題是晚上7:40，整個前台沒有其他客人，這種服務真是很差勁。。
