msg:A warm welcome from the moment we stepped into the hotel entrance. We were ushered to the lobby at level 101. There we met our butler Alex and we had our refreshments at the lobby with spectacular view. A special shout out to the Hi tea session. Food and services were fabulous.  We enjoyed it very much.  As well as the magic show. Kudos to the Magician who made our day. The hotel tour was amazing,  thank you Jan ÁúüÁúü for her good effort for showing us around , it was very educational.  We didn't get the chance to dine at the Chinese restaurants as there were fully booked. What ashamed! Breakfast spread was interesting. Crew were very attentive. Our room was clean and comfortable.  The pillow selection was another brilliant move. Very much appreciated.  Front desk Joejoe was courteous and friendly.  After all, thank you J Hotel and the crew for an unforgettable experience throughout our stay.

msg:I have been travelled to Shanghai many times before, and stayed in many different 5 star top hotel, somehow, J Hotel is the one and only made me feel home and starting fall in love with Shanghai. The VIEW from 101 is the best of the best to be able to see the WHOLE Shanghai with old and new buildings and history, YUYUAN, the BUND, Peace hotel and more and everything you expect to see.

The ARTS and MR LIU HAI‚Äôs (ÂàòÊµ∑ÂÖàÁîüÔºâart tour actually is the soul of J Hotel. MR LIU, a Shanghai local gentleman, uses the very classic and professional style to bring the guests immersed every piece of art, mainly presented China traditional culture in a fancy and modern visions.

J Hotel has me understand more of my mother country, China and first time experienced the old but classic Shanghai GENTLEMAN hospitality, that might be only can see in the movie about 1930s THE SHANGHAI BOUND.

I saw every foreigners were so impressed when they see the China art and I am so proud to swing that J Hotel is becoming a new icon of China welcome more and more friends to from all around the world. I highly recommend and I definitely make J Hotel my home in Shanghai.

Also I would like to thank you Cindy, the manager of YunJing restaurant, she has given me warm company when I was having dinner on my own. Thank you for her thoughtful gifts. I hope to see her again in my next trip.

Highly recommend to you if you have never been to Shanghai or even though you have stayed in other hotels in Shanghai before, J Hotel will give you an amazing and unforgettable experience, like I doüòÉ#ILOVESHANGHAI‚ù§Ô∏è

Impeccable service upon arrival - from the concierge, check in was very smooth and butler was very helpful in assisting with our dinner reservation.

The hotel tour is a must! Ms Wang, tour guide, takes her time to introduce and explain the details of the architecture from Ground Floor to 120F.

We had to check our early morning (5:30am) and they packed our breakfast for us to bring to the airport. They also provided a small gift which is a nice gesture.

Thank you for an enjoyable stay!

msg:Absolutely at the top of things! You will be staying in one of Shanghai's most visible landmarks with a one of a kind view of the city. The Shanghai Tower's architecture is both stunning and energetic, from the outside as well as the inside. It is matched by a level of personal dedication from the staff that is absolutely extraordinary even for a hotel of the highest category.

I was staying (for a business trip) in a Premium Stateroom that offered a perfect view of several more of Shanghai's world-famous landmarks: The Oriental Pearl Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center, the Jin Mao Tower and the Bund (Waitan). When it comes to the style of the architecture you will find both very authentic and traditional Chinese elements as well as those one would expect from a skyscraper, like glass and steel. They must have taken the utmost care in combining them in a gorgeous way. It must be very hard to find that elsewhere. Very beautiful and impressive indeed. Also something someone from the West can draw a lot of inspiration from.

I would very much like to thank concierge manager Ryan Wang personally for his outstanding service from the moment my room was booked until after I had already left and we still exchanged some WeChat messages. He assisted me with practically everything I did in Shanghai and played an absolutely crucial role in making sure my business trip was a great success. Especially if you are not a fluent Mandarin speaker having a dedicated concierge can make a huge difference. From finding a certain place to organizing a visit, translating or booking a train ticket.

If you are looking for the best place to stay in Shanghai this should definitely be your choice! You will surely make some unforgettable experiences.

I am already looking forward to my next visit!

The staff were pleasant and greeted us whenever we take the lift. Provided breakfast buffet, afternoon high tea, and not to mention the view here is simply stunning. The hotel is situated at the heart of shanghai, the view is probably better than oriental pearl tower.

All in all, it was a very pleasant stay and I felt it was money well spent for the experience.

Although it was a one night stay for us, it was the little things that made such lasting impressions from the package deal that came with the room to their customer service, it was impeccable. 
The food there, OMG, exquisite, delicious and moreish. For breakfast we definitely went A la carte and was quite surprised when we were told we can order the entire menu if we wished üòÇ. By all means we had seconds. 
Loved the fact that we got an extended check out for 2pm with no additional charge. We really enjoyed our stay there. 
I have only two faults with the hotel:
1) The rugs/carpets in the room can do with a deep clean. Though it didn‚Äôt smell or anything but the dirt and stains are very noticeable. Hence the 4/5 for cleanliness. 
2) The fact that at some point we had to leave the hotel to head back homeü•≤.

Overall, if the price is a non factor I say pay this hotel a visit, you won‚Äôt regret it. We will definitely visit again.

The floor heating in the bathroom is always on, and it feels warm when walking barefoot. The bed is very thick, comfortable and supportive! A fruit plate, a small doll, and soft drinks and beer in the room are free. Eating in the clouds! I thought the form was more important than the content, but it was surprisingly delicious! Afternoon tea has barbecue, sushi, desserts, and fruits, which can be regarded as a small buffet. Dinner, a feast, every dish has a little ingenuity. Breakfast, eggs and toasts in various ways, so delicious!

The details are what impressed me the most: 1. The iPad smart control is very convenient. The lights, curtains, air conditioners, room service, etc. are all solved. The bedroom also has scene one, two, and three modes; 2. The most troublesome thing is that I am not sure whether to leave the light on before going to bed when I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. J Hotel thought of this: I walked to the bathroom, which was originally pitch black. When I approached, I directly controlled a small light below to light up, and I could see the toilet clearly. There was also a non-slip blanket under each one, which was very considerate. 3. You can watch TV while soaking in the bathtub, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the water overflowing. There are water outlets in a very scientific position...
Gym: 85th floor, used twice, very large and spacious, the treadmill can see the river, and the women‚Äôs locker room is also very clean; the staff is also very nice, and all the trash cans in the public toilets are automatically opened, which makes people feel very hygienic.
Breakfast: 101st floor, the window position is great, the special beef tongue noodles are delicious, and the staff are very professional and enthusiastic, paying attention to your needs.
Lobby bar: Great location to watch the sunset, eat snacks, very comfortable.
Afternoon tea at Ge Lounge: Went there twice, it was included in the set meal, and went with expectations. There was a little episode when I went there for the first time. The attitude and training of the service staff at Ge Lounge are still a little different from other places. Some unpleasant things happened, but the duty manager of the day handled it very promptly and patiently. He came as soon as he said he would, without any ambiguity, and immediately coordinated, communicated, comforted and handled it, so the unpleasantness passed later and did not affect the overall experience. The training and service of international brand chains are standardized, so I feel more at ease choosing their hotels when staying in hotels, but this time I personally experienced the service of J Hotel, and I didn‚Äôt lose. The housekeeper Xiao Liang is also very good. If you mention something to her on WeChat, she will definitely reply in less than half a minute. The arrangement of the housekeeper is really good, which makes people feel that if there are any problems during the stay, they can be easily fed back and followed up in time.
In fact, the competition in the high-end hotel market in Shanghai is fierce, and Jinjiang is still ambitious in it. This made me look forward to and be curious when I chose J Hotel. But I have personally experienced it. I have stayed in many high-end hotels in China. The comprehensiveness of J Hotel is the ceiling in China. I hope it can continue to work hard and be better. Due to time constraints, I didn't have the opportunity to listen to the art explanation this time, so I didn't understand a lot of modern art. I look forward to having the opportunity to come again next time.

The most prominent highlight is the home-like service. The service attitude is undoubtedly excellent. More importantly, the various service details that are considered for the convenience of guests bring a feeling of being more like a family than a family. On May 13, dinner was at the 103rd floor of Tianzhijin. I booked a window seat and overlooked the beautiful scenery of Shanghai. On the morning of May 14, I visited Yunshang Zhenqi Hotel. The tour guide explained in detail and sincerely and enthusiastically, which made us visitors feel like spring breeze. Lunch was at the 103 Jinyan Cantonese Restaurant. From the date of booking, the restaurant had a corporate customer service WeChat connection, and everything was carefully arranged, and the reservation invitation was sent early. Because of the temporary increase in visitors on that day, the restaurant also took the initiative to change to a larger private room, and the dishes were also re-plated according to the new number of people, which greatly facilitated the guests and was very considerate!

msg:Bring parents and children to experience, stay in Chinese-style Xiangyun and Western-style Xiangyun rooms, experience active and cordial service from the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, the welcoming butler takes the initiative to open the car door to take the luggage, and when checking in at 101F, the front desk lady TammyMa and the little brother ScottSui are professional, meticulous, warm and thoughtful. Because they are with the elderly and children, every detail is explained carefully and must be given. The butler team leads the way to the room, helps with the network, introduces the details of the equipment, and patiently explains to the elderly one by one. If it is not clear once, explain it again for the second time, smiling and patient throughout the whole process. The afternoon tea and buffet breakfast teams in the executive lounge are also great, and the food is beyond expectations and delicious! It‚Äôs a pity that the old and the young have a small appetite and are full after a little taste. The room service response is also very efficient. Basically, it responds in about 2 minutes after calling, which is very satisfactory. The only thing is that the weather was not good. It was rainy when I checked in. I only stayed for one day, so I was a little rushed. I didn't have time to appreciate the works of art that can be seen everywhere in the hotel, and I haven't tried other restaurants and delicacies. This is another reasonable reason to come back next time. It was a very pleasant hotel stay experience. I look forward to the next time. PS, I must mention it again, the photos are really good, no matter how you take them, they look good

msg:Facilities: The facilities and equipment are very complete, and some details can be improved.
Hygiene: From the moment you enter the lobby, you feel very clean and hygienic, with no dust anywhere you can see.
Environment: As the tallest hotel in the world, you can see the mountains and small mountains at a glance. As the center of the international metropolis Shanghai, it has a unique existence. The World Financial Center and Jin Mao Tower next to it can be seen in front of J Hotel.
Service: From the moment you get off the bus, a butler will open the door to pick up your luggage, and then go to the 101st floor to check in. You will be seated throughout the entire process, and snacks and refreshments are provided.
Free non-alcoholic drinks and beer in the minibar: more than 10 kinds of drinks are all free, and you can't finish them all.
Supreme executive afternoon tea for two at Yi Lounge: the steak is particularly fresh, the salmon and ham are of very good quality, and the pastries are delicious.
Summary: A hotel that makes you very, very comfortable from check-in to check-out, with the warmth of home and the same service as a shopping mall. Will definitely come again in the future!

The weather was bad and foggy when you checked in and you couldn't see the scenery outside the room. When the fog cleared in the afternoon, you found that the scenery was not good. Okay, after communicating with the customer service, we agreed to change rooms, but the twin rooms were all full, so we could only change to a double room. We were then shown the room and moved in after we were satisfied. The double room had a better view and the double bed The room was several hundred yuan cheaper than the twin room, and there was no refund. However, breakfast for our two children was originally charged, and there was no charge, so it was offset... The afternoon tea was also great.
Hygiene: Satisfactory, bathroom supplies are relatively high-end, Herm√®s, etc.
Environment: good,
Facilities: relatively new, there is no end to the drinks in the refrigerator, haha

msg:Let's talk about the advantages first. There are many expensive artworks in the public area. The materials are very expensive. The entire hotel cost 1.38 billion. The food tastes good, especially the dishes in the executive lounge. The steak, roasted chicken and pork are all roasted very fragrant.
Next, let's talk about the disadvantages:
The service is unstable. Sometimes the service is good and sometimes it is not. It feels like the enthusiastic staff in an old state-owned enterprise, but the professionalism is still not as good as that of a luxury hotel. The basic room type is old-fashioned. The Xiangyun room is slightly better but has a smell. The Lingkong room is more beautiful. The large number of crystal handles and faucets are worthy of praise. The large number of stones from various countries can be seen to have spent a lot of money, but the sense of disobedience that emerges from time to time often deducts points in the details.
The swimming pool is small and shallow. The lifeguard uncle next to it was chatting and playing loudly. I took a few photos. The uncle even said that there was nothing to take photos of. There was no one in the pool. Excuse me? Very unprofessional, even worse than a hotel worth hundreds of dollars, not to mention Bulgari. As long as someone goes into the pool, there will be two people sitting on the chairs to watch quietly, not to mention chatting. At the same time, they will send drinks and fruits to greet people when they pass by.

Overall experience: 8 points for service, 6.5 points for room, 9 points for executive dining, 7.5 points for breakfast, 9 points for public area design, and 5 points for swimming pool.

The view in the room was average. It was cloudy when I stayed there, and the window in the room had two layers of glass, which blocked a lot of light.

The Supreme Executive Afternoon Tea for Two at Ge Lounge is also unique, with tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, fruits, pastries, hot and cold meats and vegetables available for free. After afternoon tea, I returned to the room and saw a small birthday cake on the coffee table. It was a surprise. I am very grateful to the butler for his thoughtfulness. Fitness and swimming in the cloud is another experience. The breakfast varieties are a combination of Chinese and Western, and the service staff is ready to provide you with warm service. Under the guidance of Mr. Liu Hai, we started our journey to the wonders of the clouds. Through his professional explanation, we had a better understanding of Hotel J. In short, the trip to J Hotel was worth the money and I would like to express my gratitude to the hotel.

Because I heard from the child that it was an international brand, I didn't understand. üòÉ When checking out, the housekeeper came directly to the room to help take the luggage to the car. In short, the experience was great. The slippers were a little off, and I have reported it. It is estimated that they will be replaced soon, and the experience of future guests will be better. üëåüèª I will stay there again if I have the chance!

msg:It was my first time to stay at J Hotel Shanghai Center and check in to this former tallest hotel in China. It has been open for nearly three years, and all aspects of facility design still maintain high-end standards. Needless to say, the scenery is the highest in Shanghai. From the best view position in the 101 lobby, you can see the Huangpu River and Lujiazui Three-piece Suite.
The hotel's service is very good. Check-in is in the sofa area in the lobby. There will be a butler who will check-in and explain the benefits. After checking in at the front desk, a butler will take you to the room to introduce the facilities and functions in the room. I placed the wrong order when I checked in, and Sia and Shelly at the front desk actively helped me deal with it, and finally it went through smoothly. Thumbs up for both of you for your enthusiastic help. Considering your travel needs, you thoughtfully arranged a late check-out and gave you a souvenir from the hotel as a souvenir. Overall, the service is very considerate and satisfactory. I will choose the national brand J Hotel next time!

msg:The advantages are obvious. The location is excellent. It is upstairs in Shanghai's landmark building, Shanghai Center. The lobby is on the 101st floor. The fastest direct elevator access is one minute and one second. When you open the elevator door when you arrive, you will be hit by a strong wind from the elevator shaft. , the hair is disheveled in an instant, no one is spared, which is quite interesting. The hotel has sunset and sunrise watching activities, which is full of romance. Unfortunately, it was rainy in Shanghai when we checked in, and the window was completely white, which made me feel lonely.
The hotel staff is very adequate, everyone is smiling and very friendly.
The decoration style of the hotel has a crystal clear feel, with crystal glass and gold silk cloth decorating very well.
The toiletries are Parma water, which is of good quality.
Breakfast is a semi-buffet style, with all the food you need. The Chinese food is very good, except that the porridge bowl is too flat and the opening is too large, making it inconvenient to eat. Although the Western pastry is exquisite, it is not authentic enough, with a total score of 80 points. The service of the restaurant staff is 90%.
The disadvantage lies in the details, which is a pity:
The welcome fruit in the room only had a few mediocre-looking strawberries, and the mung bean cake that came with it was already dry on the surface. I don‚Äôt know how long it had been there, so I took a bite and spit it out quickly.
There is no Bluetooth speaker in the room, and even if I called, there was none.
There is no wine list for room service.
The push and pull signs on the bathroom handle are reversed. For such a high-end hotel decoration to have such lost items, it is almost suspected that there was no rigorous bidding process to select suppliers during the decoration, and the decoration acceptance was also very rough.
The TV was very small and not worthy of the high quality of the room.
	
All in all, it's a special hotel.

The hotel has 7 restaurants of different styles, and the entire hotel is magnificently decorated. However, to truly appreciate the luxury of the hotel, you need to participate in the cloud tour activities provided by the hotel for guests. Professionals will lead you to explain the most outstanding parts of the hotel and restaurants. During the entire stay, from the room facilities to the services and the mini bar and afternoon tea provided, there were almost no shortcomings. Especially for the breakfast part, there are not many buffet types, but they are all high-quality, and the fruits are of very high quality. They also provide an a la carte menu, which has both Shanghainese and Western styles. It can be said that the breakfast is very good. Excellent. If there are any shortcomings, it must first be the price. Even for an anniversary, the price is enough to deter most people, and if you want an unobstructed view, you need the weather to cooperate. The second is that individual waiters still need training and may make mistakes in some details. Finally, the socket design of the desk in the room is unreasonable. If you want to plug in a power supply, you have to move the desk. Of course, it is estimated that for most guests, there may be no need to use this power supply.

During my stay here, I received considerate housekeeping services from Miss Xiao Tian and Miss Xiao Du of J Hotel, and friendly services from Xiao Zhao, a young man on the first floor who carried my suitcase all the way to the garage on the third floor underground, etc... In fact, during my stay, I received many good services at all levels. The hotel's breakfast and afternoon tea supplies are rich and varied. The environment is first-class, the facilities are first-class, and the service is first-class. For this, I and my family would like to express my heartfelt thanksüôè

msg:For my wife‚Äôs 70th birthday, she chose the J Shanghai Center Hotel in the clouds. The hotel is first-class in terms of hardware and software. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, a bellman came over to help us with our luggage, and the housekeeper, Miss Du, took us to the lobby on the 101st floor. The day before I checked into the hotel, the housekeeper called me to ask about my requirements for the guest room and any help I needed. Since we arrived at the hotel at around nine o'clock in the morning, we took part in the hotel's "curious tour" before checking in. Mr. Liu Hai's explanation was detailed and interesting, which gave us a deep understanding of the hotel. The hotel lobby is on the 101st floor, and the beautiful Ms. Pan poured us drinks and tea. The housekeeping depar**ent had tidied up the room and allowed us to enter the room in advance. As soon as we entered the room, our eyes lit up. The room was decorated very warmly, which made us feel very warm as soon as we entered the door. Especially the lobby manager Li Jie, as long as he can fulfill the requests made by the guests, he will try his best to make the guests very happy and satisfied. The hotel's free afternoon tea and breakfast are amazing. In short, we stayed at J Shanghai Center Hotel and it was very happy and unforgettable. It is worth recommending to all our friends to stay here.

Although the previous two hotels gave us an excellent feeling, Hotel J still wins with its many advantages. Its height, luxury, professional service, artistry, and cultural accumulation are all worthy of praise. I would like to express my special thanks to the handsome guy at the front desk and the beautiful girl Xiao Du for making careful arrangements for us to stay in the hotel on our wedding anniversary. We would like to thank Zhang Tianlin for his handwritten greeting card and Mr. Liu Hai for his professional and enthusiastic explanation of the journey to the clouds. We would also like to thank all the staff of the hotel service team for their hard work. Thanks for your hard work, we had this great hotel experience.

From the hardware facilities to the landscape to the services, the quality beats the Bulgari Hotel!
National enterprises are open to medical staff for free during the epidemic. This must be praised!

This hotel cost 2 billion to build
Like a palace that houses thousands of works of art in the clouds
Dedicated personnel are responsible for showing around and explaining
Guess the material correctly to win a postcard prize

J Hotel Shanghai Tower reaches the highest 120th floor
Now it is truly the top of Shanghai

Thirty craftsmen were hired to create the mosaic wall
The collage took a year and a half and cost tens of millions.
Used a lot of materials
It took ten years for the hotel to open

Among them, aerial ballet is a French artist
Pauline Ohrel's work from 1967
The 120-story "Heavenly Brocade" entered the Guinness World Records
‚Ä¶
Each artwork has an exhibition label next to it
You can scan the QR code to view the exhibition

Bakery on the 1st floor
Italian restaurant on the 101st floor
And the lobby, etc.
They are great
Tried the dishes from the Italian restaurant
The experience of linking the five senses
You will never be disappointed

The service staff are great
The butler who led us to our room
There is also Odele Wang Zejun who patiently introduced us to the hotel.
And Lynda Zhang Tianlin who sent us off from the hotel
The services are all courteous and enthusiastic.
And everyone in the restaurant
They are all greatüëçüèªThumbs up for you all
I hope everyone is getting better and better

The last thing I want to say is that J Hotel is worth staying at

The concierge depar**ent took us upstairs, but they got our names wrong, which was a bit embarrassing. The butler who actually received me after going upstairs was a different butler than the one who had previously chatted on the phone and added WeChat. When I checked in, I was told that I wanted to issue an invoice when I checked out. I replied that I would issue an invoice via Ctrip. I said that I had to pay at the hotel and that the hotel would issue the invoice. I said that I wanted to ask, but I could only say that it was very unprofessional. The food and drinks in the executive lounge are too mediocre, and the breakfast is useless.

Whether in the lobby at 101 or at the Yunzhijin Restaurant at 120, you can have a panoramic view of Shanghai, the Huangpu River view, Jin Mao Tower, the World Financial Center and the Oriental Pearl Tower. There is nothing left to do. The scenery you saw after queuing for 3 hours at the top of Shanghai can be easily seen from the hotel! Let‚Äôs talk about the service. From checking in and picking up your luggage to entering and exiting the hotel, there are always waiters greeting you warmly, and they also provide wake-up calls to watch the sunrise, which is great! Not to mention the hotel facilities, from the hotel lobby decoration, restaurant decoration to the rooms, they are all luxurious and brilliant, and everything seems thoughtful and refined. We also participated in the Exotic Journey on the Cloud. Ambassador Liu Hai‚Äôs wonderful explanation gave us a more detailed understanding of the hotel‚Äôs design concept, good intentions and service concept. Recommended!

The effect of taking pictures of the Bund from the room is average, but the hotel has a dedicated sightseeing floor, so it is particularly convenient to take pictures of the Bund. In addition, the hotel decoration is definitely No. 1 in Shanghai. Except that the front desk looks a bit low, it is said to contain priceless crystals.

The original intention of the trip was that the child watched Treasure Hunt and asked about the tallest building in China, and then accompanied him to search and discover the process of its construction, and promised him to come and see and stay. The children were very happy! I like the arrangement of the hotel's cloud treasure trip. Fortunately, I didn't miss it. I learned a lot of knowledge and the stories behind it, and got to know the gentle, beautiful and knowledgeable sister Junjun. Although we didn‚Äôt see the sunrise or sunset due to bad weather, it didn‚Äôt affect our beautiful mood, and it also left a foreshadowing. The children said they would start again next winter!

When you enter, there will be a guide who will inquire about the order status and lead you to the elevator entrance. After the elevator reached the top floor, the lady at the front desk enthusiastically and patiently checked in and informed us of some of the benefits of the booked room. The lobby manager enthusiastically guided us to the lobby bar to wait for check-in, and patiently answered all the questions: Exquisitely decorated, Western-style Chinese food Full range of colors, (also with ordering service). You can sit by the window of the 101 restaurant and watch the scenery outside while eating. (Although it was raining that day and I couldn‚Äôt see the sunrise, the smoky clouds were still beautiful and spectacular).
No matter which floor you go to in the entire hotel, the moment the elevator door opens, you can see the staff's warm greetings and direction guidance with smiling faces.
Staying for two days made me feel truly at home. It is recommended that everyone go and experience the excellent service of Hotel J, feel the culture of the hotel, and enjoy the grandeur of the hotel environment.

I also checked into the Peace Hotel. The service was very warm. The concierge came over to open the door to fix my lame leg when he wanted to ventilate the air. I was embarrassed. I really appreciate the service of Jinjiang Group. Approved! Let‚Äôs compare it with some foreign groups. It‚Äôs true that there is no harm without comparison.

She was very enthusiastic and attentive, helping us choose a beautiful room, and also prepared a welcome package for the children. The staff I met during my stay all had smiles on their faces, which made me feel like spring breeze. Although the design of the shower room is a bit too transparent and may be more suitable for double occupancy, we are told that we can install a shower curtain next time, which will make it more suitable for family travelers. The overall experience is very satisfying and I will come again if I have the opportunity~

It was really a feast for the eyes and a good mood. I was secretly glad that I chose Hotel J, Shanghai Tower. What is particularly worth mentioning is the breakfast. The restaurant is on the 101st floor with a panoramic view of the mountains. The restaurant adopts dual service channels of ordering and self-service, allowing guests to not only choose the food they like to eat, but also taste the hotel's characteristics and specialty food. There is another characteristic of the hotel that I cannot complain about. From what I saw, the assistant lobby manager, depar**ent managers, receptionists, front desk staff, waiters, cleaning staff, etc., all greeted me with a smile and said hello cordially! This is a first-class management team with a good sense of service. I recommend J Hotel Shanghai Tower as your best choice when visiting Shanghai.

Cynthia's service is very considerate. She patiently and enthusiastically explained the hotel's facilities, equipment, room landscape and check-in details to us. She also gave her son a children's toiletry bag. The child was very happy. In the evening, I booked the restaurant on the 120th floor. The scenery is so beautiful and the dishes are delicious. It is worthy of the Guinness World Records restaurant. The next day's breakfast is also delicious, with down-to-earth Shanghai characteristics, and the fruits are very fresh. Overall, J Hotel is worth experiencing, and I will stay again next time.

msg:The third stop of the trip to Shanghai: J Hotel, the highest in the country. Originally, I planned to stay at the Bulgari Hotel the next day, but because of a sudden incident, I had to make J the last stop of this trip. Bulgari will wait until November to see you again. When I came to J, my first impression is that the employees here have a strong sense of pride. They will tell me that this place is higher than Guangzhou Rosewood, um, it‚Äôs very good. The sense of pride comes from the sense of belonging. It is indeed higher than Rosewood, but I can see that many aspects are learned from various hotels. For example, the room card is learned from Guangzhou Rosewood, and the entry-level mini bar is learned from W Hotel. After all, it is the first luxury hotel in China. It is also necessary to keep learning from others. This is also the beginning of progress. I have lived in so many luxury five-star hotels from international chains, and I am very proud to see such a hotel in my own country. The person who received us was Wang Jingjing, who was very nice, with a good service attitude, good explanations, warm and courteous. Then Manager Guo, the manager on duty, also warmly entertained us. A very good manager! Afternoon tea at Yi Lounge is quite satisfying. Although it feels like a KTV in a hall (maybe because of the decoration style), the food is still good. But please don‚Äôt only have ice cream in the future, it‚Äôs not delicious, please improve it. The hotel has a lot of familiar feelings, in the lobby, like Canton Tower, in the room, a bit like the top luxury Morpheus Hotel in Macau (of course, in all fairness, the interior is really incomparable, and Morpheus supplies are all Hermes) So, just sort of like that. The room service is good. The hotel doesn‚Äôt have much delicious food for breakfast, not even the shrimp dumplings that Dinglu basically has. It‚Äôs a pity, but the service attitude is still good, and they are trying their best to do a good job for the guests. In terms of food, the fruit is commendable, and grapes and cherries are both okay. I hope that I can continue to absorb the experience of other hotels, send more people to the top luxury hotel to learn, and continue to improve the service of the hotel. I hope that J will do better and become an international famous brand.

msg:I took my 88-year-old mother to experience the feeling of entering the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds at the top of Shanghai. The whole experience process is one word-beauty and two words-satisfaction. The environment and facilities of our own brand are complete, showing the national demeanor. The restaurants and rooms in the lobby and lobby are clean and tidy, and there are no dead ends. The service is even better. Every receptionist is beautiful, handsome, enthusiastic and proactive. 1) Three days before check-in, I received calls from the hotel housekeeper to ask about our various needs, and then kept calling to help us in the next two days. The real housekeeper who received us at check-in went through all the check-in procedures for us, and answered them patiently Our doubts remove the worries of the old mother. The two-person courtesy in the lobby bar gave mothers a sense of fulfillment while waiting for the check-in procedure. Our package includes the supreme executive afternoon tea for two people in the Yi Lounge, because the daughter sent us here and the butler specially invited her to experience the delicious food of the afternoon tea with us (thank you) 2) I would like to thank the lovely Xiao Geng: Because my grandma accidentally left the room card in a private room in the lounge, some unpleasantness happened next. When I went to the front desk to explain the situation to her, her first concern was how to calm my mood I was displeased, and then immediately re-applied for a new room card for me. After I returned to the lounge full of gratitude and joy and told my family about it, they were also very touched, but Xiao Geng looked for it again. Came to the lounge to comfort us, brought souvenirs from the hotel, and expressed their apologies again (in fact, the whole incident has nothing to do with the hotel, it is related to other guests). Her kind of service that treats guests as family members We are deeply moved by the spirit of achieving the ultimate, thank you, thank you, thank you lovely and beautiful girl! What makes us even more unforgettable is that we left the store, when she still helped to solve the follow-up problems, thank you so much girl! 3) There are also the beautiful butler who showed us around, the waiters in the breakfast room, the waiters in the 120 restaurant, the handsome guys in the lobby on the first floor, and the cleaning lady, thank you!
Our whole family will definitely come again and look forward to seeing you next time!

The only regret I have is to make a small suggestion to the hotel. The weather was not beautiful during the two days we stayed (8.29~30). It rained the whole time and it was foggy outside the window. It was almost impossible to see anything. I am very sorry! The reason for spending such an expensive room rate is largely to enjoy the scenery outside the window, but unfortunately I failed to do so!
The weather cannot be changed, but can the policy be more user-friendly? For example, for guests who are unable to enjoy the beautiful scenery due to weather conditions during check-in, can the hotel give them a chance to come to the hotel later to see the sunrise and sunset and the prosperity of Shanghai? , It is worthy of the trust and love of the descendants of Chinese people to J Hotel, a national brand!

There is a charge for snacks on the table, and the butler will introduce them when they are brought to the room. It was foggy and the scenery was average. The picture of the corresponding room type on the platform was wrong, and the picture of the Lingkong room was placed in the Xiangyun room.
The floor tiles are beginning to show signs of old age and should be repaired in time. There were insects in the breakfast. The waiter came over and strangled them to death. He also brought freshly made pancakes and fruit. He politely declined with "I can't eat that much" and let him take them away.
By default, toothbrushes, combs, razors, sewing kits, and nail files are not provided in guest rooms. This is not reasonable for a hotel of this level.
When I find something is missing, I feel embarrassed even if I call the butler once and bring it to me.
Every time the service gives people the impression that the service staff have a good attitude, so I still give it 5 stars. But the whole experience was a little less than truly completely satisfying.
Yes, Herm√®s bath products are only available in Lingkong rooms and above, but not in Xiangyun and Tianji.
Went to the swimming pool, no reservation required, I guess because it doesn't face the outside and has no view.
Takeaways can be delivered to the room by the butler. All the hotels I stayed in Shanghai this time have takeaways delivered to the room. Thumbs up for Shanghai.

Traditional Chinese elements such as Shikumen, cloud orchids, colored glaze, and enamel have been deeply used in the design of J Hotel. Decorations and other designs are integrated into the room, the design style and the details of the butler service are good, the invincible view VIEW, and the value of the hotel is raised. However, the details of the room facilities need to be improved, after all, the price is there. For example: the faucet of the washbasin does not turn very smoothly, and it is difficult for children to unscrew it; the desk lamp by the window cannot find the button to completely close it... The world-class century-old hotel brand is not only formed by the accumulation of artworks and sky-high costs, It's more about humanistic details and experience word of mouth.
However, in any case, J Hotel Shanghai Center can be regarded as a milestone of a national high-end brand, and I hope it will get better and better!

Yi Lounge has few viewing seats, quite a lot of people, and the afternoon tea products are mediocre; the breakfast is quite rich and tastes mediocre, not as good as Capella, Suning Bellagio and Peace Hotel, but the view of Shanghai 101 is a plus, experience great! The scenery of Tianzhijin is also the biggest highlight, and the taste is not bad. The design of the room is more beautiful than comfortable. The bed is too high, the quilt is too thick, the faucet is not good to use, and the double glass blocks the great view. It looks very dark outside the window! I had a great weekend at J Hotel. It would have been more perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the embarrassment that the concierge didn‚Äôt write it off correctly when the car left and the card was stuck at the exit and no one answered the hotel phone for a few minutes. In short, the hotel is more suitable for tourists to check in. There is no comfort and relaxation that makes people want to go again and again, and there are no surprises and highlights. The service details need to be strengthened!

msg:This hotel, in a word, is good everywhere except expensive! But expensive is expensive! Thanks to the butlers Gina and Chris for their thoughtful service!
I called the front desk before I made a reservation, and it was the housekeeper Gina who answered the phone. She was very professional, enthusiastic and meticulous on the phone. Even though I knew that I had not made a reservation, she introduced me in detail the differences and features of each room type. In the end, after neutral consideration, I booked the Xiangyun King Room marked "Hot-selling Room" on Ctrip. Before the check-in, I communicated with Gina about the room preference, and Gina carefully recorded it and made recommendations based on the actual stay. Because we are a family with two children, and one of them is relatively small, it is recommended that we stay in a Chinese-style room. There are fewer crystal glass and sharp-edged furniture, and the children will be safer and more at ease. It is also recommended to add protective corners and protective fences. Although we think that it is not necessary after consideration, we still feel that the hotel considers everything first, so that the guest experience is very good. Chris, the butler manager, also took good care of us during our stay. When we learned that it was our birthday, we were very pleasantly surprised to learn that we had arranged the room with other butler partners and presented us with desserts. There will also be small backpacks for children when they stay. Although it is a luxury business hotel, it is really considered for the parent-child family. Thanks to Chris and Gina for their attentive service. Next time you have the opportunity to come to Shanghai, if you are traveling without a baby, consider trying their western-style room again! ! !

The food for breakfast and afternoon tea is rich and the quality of the ingredients is very high. I was full both times. The staff was very positive. They asked questions during breakfast and took away the finished dishes immediately. When leaving the hotel, the staff took the initiative to help deliver the luggage downstairs. There are sweets in the lobby bar and elevator room, which children like very much. The room view is good, overlooking the Huangpu River; the mask is also huge. When I called room service for something it was delivered promptly.
Especially Liu Hai in the front office! The service is professional, warm and thoughtful. High-quality service, relieve people's worries; warm service, clean and efficient. The most important thing in service is enthusiasm, and the most important thing in satisfaction is heart-to-heart communication.

Not to mention the location, the whole building is very beautiful and has a sense of design. Alyssa was also very thoughtful when she changed house, because she knew it was my mother's birthday, so she specially made a simple decoration in the room and sent a small birthday cake, which made my mother very happy. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and since the floors are high, they look beautiful no matter what. The room has a built-in TV I love it! I used the afternoon tea in the executive lounge. The quality of the dishes and the selection of drinks are also very high. There is a bar at night, and the night view should be amazing. It's a pity that I didn't go this time because I went to see Joker Xue's concert. I must stay here again Experience the hotel well! In the afternoon, I also visited the Tianzhijin restaurant on the 120th floor. It is the highest restaurant in the building with beautiful scenery and all the waiters are very enthusiastic and professional. I have to mention that the check-in experience in the lobby is very good. Jeremy also patiently introduced some features of the whole building in the lobby. The entire check-in process and experience can be said to be excellent in the hotel industry in Shanghai! In the end, the check-out procedure is also very simple, and I also gave away a small room card and postcard for several years. I really love it! I will choose here next timeüëè

Customers staying in the hotel can experience the magical journey in the hotel, detailed lectures and visits to handicrafts, very good, next time I want to watch the sunrise and sunset, try the 120 restaurant and Italian restaurant, it is recommended for those who want to travel to stay for 3-4 nights, to experience the two directions of the super city and the Oriental Pearl Tower, to watch the sunrise and sunset, to eat food and to see the scenery is so pleasant... I am already looking forward to my next stay at J Hotel It's a perfect experience... I'm very happy just thinking about it!

Among the tallest buildings in the country, the first in the world and the second in the world, they are basically among the best in all aspects. It was the first time I stayed in a hotel to experience that a special butler will contact you one day in advance to confirm your itinerary and other information, so that you are really only satisfied and surprised when you arrive at the hotel. And when you check in, you just sit on the sofa and someone will help you. There are extra gifts for accompanying children (the details are not spoiled, the children like it very much), and you can handle late check-out for you when you check in. I arrived after 11:00 The hotel has already arranged the room to check in at any time, so there is no need to wait until two or three o'clock. The lobby on the 101st floor has an invincible view. Soft drinks and snacks are free to enjoy at any time, and non-alcoholic drinks in the room are also free to enjoy. The room is very big and tall, and every waiter feels more professional than Disney‚Äôs. The butler, Tian MM, is almost on call. , quite caring, praise. The self-service afternoon tea is also great. There are lamb, foie gras, sushi, etc., which are completely comparable to ordinary buffet meals. The buffet breakfast is invincible and very classy. You can also watch the sunrise and sunset, and take you to Lujiazui to check in and take pictures for free. The gym is quite large, and it even allows me to practice twice a day. They have traffic control. You will not feel rushed or anxious here at all, only leisurely and comfortable. Next time you come to Shanghai, this is the place. It‚Äôs great and I strongly recommend it. The price of more than 4,000 feels like tens of thousands of services, it is worth coming, strongly recommended

The service should be better when there were fewer people last year. Before check-in, the hotel called to inquire carefully about the needs, and considered many details for me. I still remember my previous comments after check-in, which made me very happy, but the experience after check-in is still a bit regretful, not as satisfactory as last year. There are a few things that can be improved: the quality of the welcome fruit, the fruit in the lounge and the breakfast room is really not up to the level of the hotel, and the coffee is not good. It is better to have more drinks and snacks in the executive lounge. The carpet in the room really needs to be cleaned, and the service level of the staff on the first floor needs to be improved. Generally speaking, the hardware and landscape are still very good, and the meals served for breakfast are much more abundant than during the epidemic. I really like the freshly made foot wraps. The swimming pool environment is also good. It is suitable for tourists who come to Shanghai for the first time.

msg:The perfect hotel, our nation's own hotel brand has reached such a height, which makes me feel very proud and proud!
        The feeling is very value-for-money. The hotel design, decoration, hardware, and software all exceed expectations.
        Breakfast is a combination of ordering and self-service. There are very tender veal steaks, Shanghai Xiaochao, soy milk with original and salty flavors, authentic Sichuan-flavored Xiaochao, small soup bags, various coffees, and English black tea ‚Ä¶We thoughtfully extended the breakfast time to 11 o‚Äôclock on weekends.
        In terms of service: I received a call from the hotel housekeeper one day in advance, asking what needs I needed, such as extra quilts, children's toiletries, and the orientation of the room, which were all recorded and carefully implemented. Special thanks to my housekeeper.
        Thanks to Ms. Cong Liping, the waiter in the room, she is very friendly, she has a sweet smile, she talks to the children gently, and takes the trouble to bring the children their favorite drinks. She will carefully tie the straps for the mobile phone charging cables, and organize them in an orderly manner with great care.
        Thanks to Teacher Liu Hai who is in charge of the journey of Qizhen, and thank him for telling the children to be a man and do things, to have the realm of a gentleman and the sincerity of a benevolent heart. Thanks to his unhurried, eloquent baritone voice, which calms us who are getting more and more impetuous and anxious, lives in the present moment, and appreciates the beauty around us.
        Because thanks to their efforts, with them, J Hotel is a respectable enterprise with connotation, spirit and culture!

msg:I stayed in a new Chinese-style room for one night, and received a call the day before. During the follow-up period, the service has always been very good. Every staff member is smiling and caring, and will chat a little bit about homework, just like neighbors, bringing a happy mood! I really like the sound of the doorbell in the room, and the area inside is larger. The details and decorations are all satisfactory, so beautiful! impressive! The pad operation in the room can control the light source, read the news, etc. There are many treasures in the public area, and Mr. Liu (Liu Bei's Liu) led the tour and explained it very well! There is also patriotic education for children throughout.

The gym facilities are medium in variety, which is not bad in the hotel. The noise of the equipment is extremely low, which can be said to be surprisingly quiet! The housekeeper said that he would give feedback on the overheating of the equipment area near the window. In fact, it may be that the building design and the air-conditioning coverage area are limited. In the summer afternoon, there is no way to reach the temperature set by the central air-conditioning, which actually affects the regular exercise of guests. I wonder if other equipment will be temporarily added to cool down locally later? Because some of the room types in the room are not Herm√®s spare parts, I have recently listened to suggestions and changed them. I believe that the heat problem in the gym will also help to improve. The training tutorials on the elliptical and cycling are very helpful for training. If you are not too hot and sweating all the time, you must practice a few more rounds.

The design of the pool is just perfect I can't fault it, it's gorgeous! It's not about hot topics such as high altitude or the 84th floor, but it makes people feel reluctant to leave when they come into view.

The breakfast buffet has a lot of content. There are three types of cheese with good taste. Among the fruits, figs are beautiful but dry inside. Watermelon and grapefruit are very juicy and delicious. Vegetable juice is convenient for those who don't like sugary drinks. I heard that celery has a strong flavor, which should be great. Classic butterflies, fried milk, etc. satisfy a one-stop experience, and there are many temptations of bread and donuts. The √† la carte wontons and pancake taste very ordinary. The waffles and Eggs Benedict sauce are not particularly guilty. You can try them all. The steak is not bad. I like the strong taste, but the latte is very perfunctory (produced by Nespresso? Guess what)

After the experience of afternoon tea, combined with the price of thousands of yuan in ctrip, it seems too expensive, especially because there is no cocktail, no coffee (I didn‚Äôt observe these two things) and it is not consistent with the reservation menu, the dessert is average, although the order says The variety will be adjusted, but it is really a bit lost without cocktails and coffee.

Overall satisfied, if the price is 30% off, I will come again.

From the design to the environment to the housekeeper and all the service staff, they are very attentive. The fly in the oin**ent may be that the view from the room is not the outside, but a piece of glass inside the hotel. Two pieces of glass are so blocked that it is hardly old. The landscape is too high, and it is covered by clouds and fog. It is too cold at a high place. Fortunately, the 103 restaurant and hotel decoration make up for it!

Later, a friend who worked in the hotel said that Shanghai J Hotel has the highest swimming pool in the world. Since then, I have paid attention to J Hotel from various channels. It happened that my daughter graduated from elementary school in June, and I wanted her to have a high-level graduation trip. It happened that my daughter wanted to go to Shanghai Disneyland, so considering all aspects of luxury, I booked a basic room in Shanghai J Hotel, a top luxury hotel. Then I have been in communication with Manager Sui, the housekeeper of Shanghai J Hotel. After understanding our needs for this trip, Manager Sui won a lot of rights and interests with us. He gave us an extra breakfast and an extra afternoon tea. Before moving in, I also arranged the room for my daughter. After we checked in, my daughter was very satisfied. It was really luxurious and an eye-opener. From hardware to service, it was first-class. The sense of experience is full. Breakfast is in the form of a la carte and semi-self-service. There is no limit to the order, and the taste is not bad. The Australian beef tenderloin for breakfast is very good, and the chicken feet are very delicious. There are so many exquisite dishes that can be ordered, this is the most sumptuous breakfast I have ever had. Executive afternoon tea is also commendable. The white wine of Ch√¢teau Lafite is not limited to anyone, and the taste is very mellow. The 120-story cloud overlooks the entire Shanghai Beach. It feels like you are on top of the world. It is extremely heroic. Watching the sunrise of Great Shanghai in the morning and the light show of Night Shanghai in the evening, the view is amazing. Next time, I will bring my son to experience the top luxury hotel of Jinjiang Group. I hope that the top luxury brand of domestic hotels, J Hotel, will go to the world. Thanks again to Manager Sui for the arrangement, and once again verified the concept of J Hotel to treat guests like family!

msg:Among all the high-end hotels I have stayed in, the service quality of J Hotel can be said to be one of the best. Due to my special check-in needs, I wanted to give my girlfriend a romantic proposal ceremony on the night of check-in. And considering it was a weekday, I needed to have the decorating team come in and spruce up the room before I checked in. But with the help of Scott, the housekeeper, everything went smoothly. Interspersed with this is the request to help hide the rose bouquet at the front desk, book a seat at the Tianzhijin Restaurant, etc., all of which were perfectly completed, thank you very much! Thank you for your hard work behind the scenes, which gave me a great marriage proposal experience. Looking forward to meeting you again in the future~

msg:It's amazing, it's shocking when you enter the hotel, the elevator takes only 61 seconds from the 1st floor to the 101st floor, and the lobby is too luxurious! The front desk of the three Tiffany blues is a big love.
Since I arrived early and the room was still not ready, I went to the 84th floor to eat the afternoon tea that was provided when I booked the room. I thought that the free money might be some beautiful but not very delicious small cakes, but it turned out! It's a buffet! ! There are meat, cakes, and drinks! Can eat until 6 o'clock! This is equivalent to giving dinner... But the wedding anniversary can't be passed so easily, otherwise the future life will not be easy, so I can only eat a little casually, take a picture and let it go.
The room is on the 90th floor, facing the shaver. The room is very large and luxurious. It is said that the decoration cost of an ordinary room was more than one million at the beginning. The butler service is very considerate and can almost respond to requests. Usually, it can be done within 5 minutes Deliver the things you requested to the room. In addition, the soft drinks and beer in the room are free, which fully realizes the freedom of drinks. Because it is the wedding anniversary, I also specially asked for a simple decoration, and also presented my favorite fruits and small cakes. My wife is very happy like satisfaction!
Dinner is eaten at Tianzhijin on the 120th floor. The set meal for 4 people is delicious and plentiful. I feel that it is enough for 5 adults. This time I took two children with me and wasted a lot. It is a sin. The table is facing the direction of Puxi Old Wharf, luck Well, the weather is very clear at night, so I can see clearly. I look out of the window while eating with my wife and children, and I feel like my wife and children are beside me, and the world is expanding.
In short, this anniversary was very good, thanks to the housekeepers of J Hotel, restaurant service staff and kitchen masters~

What surprised me the most was meeting Wally in the hotel room. He patiently explained to me the principle of the double-glazing in the Shanghai Center building, which benefited me a lot. . When I checked out, I ran into Wally, who invited me to come back to watch the sunrise and sunset like an old friend. This time I chose the rainy season to experience the different feelings of J Hotel. And when I checked out, I also received a hotel-customized postcard from the housekeeper Chris. Every employee in the hotel is very attentive. Worth my many return times.

msg:I brought my mother to Shanghai to play. After choosing for a long time, I decided to let my mother feel the feeling of living in the cloud, and chose J Hotel. Really, this stay experience made me evaluate J Hotel as a 6-star hotel.
First of all, as soon as you enter the door, you will be warmly greeted by the enthusiastic staff lady, who will help you carry your luggage all the way to the lobby of the hotel. On the 101st floor, the elevator is a silent elevator, but there will be some sensations on the upper and lower ears. There are thoughtful equipment outside the elevator. Candy for swallowing to ease the pressure on the ears as the elevator ascends and descends.
After taking a seat in the lobby, the staff will warmly check you in, which is really a super-star service. After processing, a little brother will lead you to your room.
I booked the Xiangyun Twin Room. As soon as I entered the door, I was attracted by the meticulous hygiene and exquisite decoration. My favorite is the Tang Sancai on both sides of the TV. I love it so much. Welcome fruit. The green glazed coffee table and the golden embroidered dragon sofa are really beautiful. My mother is very satisfied, we live on the 88th floor, there is a sign in the house, 412 meters above the ground, we really live in the clouds!
Then we went to the Ge Lounge on the 84th floor for afternoon tea. It was very rich, but we really couldn't eat it. At noon, I also had lunch for two at Tianzhijin, the highest restaurant on the 120th floor. In the evening, I went to the 103rd floor to eat Jinyan. There was also a very warm and friendly uncle who took us to explain the treasures on the cloud, the past and present of J Hotel. This trip was really touching. When I checked out at the end, the young lady at the front desk also gave me a postcard from J Hotel. Finally, I would like to thank shelly wu for her request! Thanks again! Will definitely come to J Hotel again! It really made me realize what it means to be "at home". Thank you!

When you check in, you will confirm your check-in information in the lounge area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lobby bar. After checking in, the butler will bring you to the room and introduce the various facilities and services in the room. There is also a contactless butler cabinet to protect your privacy.

The most recommended ones are watching the sunrise in the morning, watching the sunset from the heights, afternoon tea in the clouds, and the high-altitude swimming pool. The Journey to the Rare on the Cloud opened our eyes, and we experienced the in-depth design concept of hotel decoration, Chinese elements, Shanghai characteristics, which embody the charm of the traditional culture of the Chinese nation everywhere.

This time, my wife's birthday falls on a Saturday. After the reservation, the hotel's personal butler will contact me one day in advance to ask about the guests' needs and check-in matters. It feels good. The car is parked in the B3 hotel area, go to the entrance of J Hotel on the first floor, and you will be accompanied by a welcome etiquette to take the elevator to the lobby on the 101st floor. Then the personal butler will arrange for us to rest in the lobby bar, watch the scenery, enjoy drinks and snacks, and she will check in for us and explain the specific arrangements for the contents of the package.
The birthday scene is arranged in advance in the room, and small cakes and fruits are presented.
The room facilities are very good, the bathroom is spacious, the mattress is thick enough and comfortable, the calfskin interior, the three-dimensional wallpaper, the Chinese-style entrance door, all the details reflect its luxury.
Breakfast is a semi-buffet, noodle ravioli and coffee are delivered by the customer service after ordering. There are quite a variety of varieties, from 7:00 to 11:00 on Saturdays and Sundays, which is enough for leisure.
Dinner is booked at Tianzhijin on the 120th floor. It mainly serves Huaiyang cuisine, supplemented by local and Cantonese cuisine. Although it is a little expensive, the color and aroma are excellent. You can also enjoy the unique night view of Shanghai.
The biggest achievement is Mr. Liu Hai's explanation and introduction of the rare journey on the cloud, "You don't know it just by looking at it, you know it by listening to it", especially the 8 boxes of the "Jin Yan" on the 103rd floor, which are absolutely breathtaking.
The complimentary afternoon tea can also be enjoyed after check-out. If you have enough time, you can stay in Yi Lounge for an afternoon.
I also thank the personal butlers Wang Zejun and Xiao Yuhan for their warm service.

This time it is mainly to experience the height of Shanghai (120-floor sightseeing floor) and Shanghai speed (ultra-fast elevator) with the children, and feel the mind of being open to all rivers and rivers. I will come again in the future!

It's just that I haven't reached this level yet, and it still hurts to spend more than 10,000 yuan for two nights. Work hard to earn money and strive to stay permanently in the future. The girl gave it a name, hot water pot, which means double-layer glass insulation, but at the same time, the view of the room is discounted, so it is no problem to see it in the lobby. Come again next time.

The breakfast part is also amazing. The delicious scrambled eggs and the invincible window view give you a high sense of happiness. I was also very lucky to see the sunrise today. Although the city is a bit foggy, the overall feeling of shooting is still very beautiful.

In the afternoon, I participated in the hotel introduction. The uncle in the blue suit humorously took us on a tour of cultural relics combining east and west. Finally, the afternoon tea on the 84th floor was quite rich.

It‚Äôs a pity that the welcome cake in the room can be replaced with high-priced branded desserts, or even made into a three-tiered dessert stand to make guests feel more amazing.

The above, I will visit again when I have the opportunity, next time I hope to experience the Cantonese restaurant with installation characteristics.

The lobby is located on the 101st floor of Shanghai Center, 469m above the ground, and the elevator can be reached directly without any discomfort, and it takes 1 minute. It's a pity that due to the construction of the house, even though the room is on a high floor, you can't directly face the scenery downstairs, and you can only look out through the gaps in the metal components. I enjoyed the self-service afternoon tea at the Yi Lounge on the 84th floor. The price of 528 people did not match the selection of snacks very well. Fortunately, the wonderful performance of the handsome magician greatly made up for the slight disappoin**ent (it coincided with the hotel 2 Anniversary, specially invited to perform), the breakfast variety is quite good, the hotel visit at ten o'clock in the morning, especially the design of several restaurants is quite shocking!

Service: I was too distracted. Before I checked in, I even made a phone call to arrange a Chinese-style room in consideration of the elders, but my mother is very fashionable üòä The request for a hard mattress was also quite satisfactory.


Free non-alcoholic drinks and beer in the minibar: There are many foods to drink, the coffee from the capsule machine is very fragrant, and the cups are also very popular. The sense of ceremony is full. Just to mention, the iced Americano for breakfast is really not good.

Breakfast: I think it is still very good, and the semi-buffet style is my favorite. Enjoy looking out the window.

msg:I have stayed in many star-rated hotels at home and abroad during business trips and vacations, but it is no exaggeration to say that this experience is the best. I chose to stay at J Hotel in Shanghai for my fifth anniversary with my partner. One day before check-in, the hotel concierge will contact you in advance to confirm and understand the needs. As soon as we got off the bus and entered the hotel entrance, the reception staff took the luggage very enthusiastically and accompanied us to take the elevator to the lobby on the 101st floor. After arriving at the lobby, the reception staff took us to a seat in the waiting area and reminded us that there are free tea and snacks available. The Lobby staff checked in quickly and efficiently, kneeling down and being polite and friendly throughout the process. After the check-in is completed, you will be accompanied to the room to introduce the hotel features and room configuration one by one. The volley king room we stayed in is stylish and simple with an area of about 70 square meters. What is amazing is that the scenery outside the window faces the Jinmao Tower and the World Financial Center overlooking Lujiazui and the Bund. The artwork in the hotel is also amazing, and the hotel tour is worth participating. That night, I specially booked the Teppanyaki at Jinshang Tiansha on the 104th floor. The overall service and delicious food are also full marks. To sum up, the hotel is not only gorgeous in appearance and interior decoration, but also perfect in all details and services. Special thanks to housekeepers Alex and Alissa for their considerate arrangement of room layout needs. In addition, there is a professional hotel guide from the senior manager and personally send us to the door to get on the bus when we check out. Thank you J Hotel for giving us an unforgettable stay experience!

In short, I will give it a five-star praise, and I will stay again next time I have a chance.

A few years later, the tallest hotel in China became the J Hotel, so I came here with my husband for the anniversary. The whole hotel is very artistic, with a strong sense of design. The high-speed elevator is really super fast, and I never waited too long for the elevator. Check-in in the lobby on the 101st floor, the butler from the check-in to the room to introduce various details and service content, very considerate. The afternoon tea buffet is on the 84th floor from 14:00 to 16:00. You can eat while watching the scenery, which is very pleasant. There are free tea and snacks in the lobby on the 101st floor until 22:00. It is also very convenient to order takeaway, and there will be staff to help deliver it to the door of the room.
We stayed in the Xiangyun King Room, which is on the 96th floor. The view in the room is not very good due to the glass, but the view can be seen from the 101 hall and the 84th floor of the afternoon tea. We just checked in in the afternoon, and in the evening, the waiter came to clean it once, and also delivered drinks, which was very enthusiastic.
The breakfast is on the 101st floor. It is a semi-buffet. The variety is okay, but to be honest, it is not rich for a hotel at this price.
Watching the sunrise is at the Tianzhijin restaurant on the 120th floor, but I didn't see it this time due to the weather, which is a pity.
The facilities in the room are quite good, and I especially like the overall design style. However, the hotel TV at this price cannot cast a screen. I didn‚Äôt expect it, and the hair dryer is not a Dyson. Fortunately, I brought it myself.
You can keep the room card as a souvenir when you check out, and I also gave a small card book with a Shanghai travel map made by the hotel. I like it very much.
Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay. Every hotel staff member I met was very warm and caring. I will stay again next time.

Entering the room on the 92nd floor, it has a modern design and a sense of luxury: the wall is pasted with elegant and delicate calfskin, intelligently control the light source and various types of sockets, and order a well-known hotel logo with a history of more than 70 years. The brand Italian crystal faucet (CRISTINA), the teacup on the plate (NARUMI) is the top bone china brand founded in Japan in 1938, and the Puna brand high-grade mineral water produced in Italy in 1564 with EU certification standards, a series of Herm√®s bath products , British Dyson hair dryer, smart toilet is a Japanese (TOTO) boutique founded in 1917, lying on the bed of SIMMONS, the world's top ten mattress brand founded in 1870, the flowers in the vase exude a faint fragrance in the room Fragrance, sweep away the fatigue of travel, feel extremely comfortable and cozy. In the room during the day, you can see tall buildings such as the World Financial Center appearing and disappearing in the clouds, and you feel as if you are in the air. Overlooking the bright lights of Shanghai at night, the two sides of the Huangpu River complement each other, and the unpredictable light show makes the night colorful and beautiful, as if entering a mythical world that is intoxicating. The wonderful artistic conception of "New Year", this is an unforgettable spring night in Shanghai.
       There are 7 distinctive restaurants in the hotel, which are beautifully decorated with unique ingenuity. Among them, the executive lounge on the 84th floor and the Tianzhijin restaurant on the 120th floor have a full range of Chinese and Western food, and you can taste exquisite and delicious delicacies. Delicacy is the ultimate enjoyment of taste.
       What is shocking is that there are a large number of works of different styles by well-known Chinese and foreign artists on each floor of the hotel, presenting the beauty of various genres to guests for appreciation. The hotel arranges two visits in the morning and afternoon, and a special person will guide and explain the works of art. My friends and I were led by Mr. Gao Weijie to walk on each floor. He explained the profound things in a simple way, quoted from many sources, and analyzed the artworks thoroughly in his humorous exposition. The "air ballet" created by the artist and the 30-meter-long ancient Silk Road mural created by the Italian artist left a deep impression on them. Visiting these works is a visual feast.
       The hardware of the hotel is unquestionable, the key is humanized service which is the best way to entertain guests. In J Hotel, it was the first time for me to enjoy butler service in a five-star hotel in China. Manager Li Ji, the receptionist, patiently explained our inquiries about the hotel over the phone. After the meeting, he treated people politely, meticulously, and full of human touch. We felt a kind of respect, understanding, service-oriented, and made people feel at home. High-quality management staff will make guests feel: "We are a guest when we first arrive, we are friends when we leave, and we are like family members when we meet again." His actions interpret the service concept of the hotel. I think the butler service at J Hotel is comparable to the famous butler service at Raffles, the top hotel in Singapore.
      Shanghai J Hotel's high-end luxury, charming scenery, Chinese and foreign cuisine, profound cultural connotation and extreme service show the national brand of the hotel industry. Magnolia exudes a charming charm, and the media calls it the new business card of Shanghai, and it deserves its name.

The high-speed elevator goes straight to 101, which is indeed worthy of the Skyline Hotel.
It's a pity that I went to Shanghai for business trips in the past 3 days. I was either on the way out or having business negotiations with visiting guests. I didn't experience the sunrise and sunset above the clouds. (Miserable people).
The design of the desk in the room is very nice, but it's a pity to enjoy the beautiful scenery and overlook the big Shanghai.
Special thanks to the hotel customer service staff, because the visiting customers are more particular, so I asked for a knife, ice, and cleaning services several times in two nights. It can be dealt with in the first time, very timely.

In the evening, there was a resident singer in the bar on the 120th floor, and I was lucky enough to meet a handsome magician who performed many close-up magic tricks. The two children had a great time. The hotel's swimming pool is also very good, but the water temperature is a bit low, but the children still had fun playing, it is worth recommending, and I will stay again next time I come to Shanghai to experience different room types. ‚úå

The hotel will be guided by a special person every day at 10:00 am and 4:00 pm, and advance reservations for non-resident guests are also accepted. When I checked in last night, I told the front desk that I had to check out before 9:30 am due to work arrangements. As a result, early this morning, the hotel specially arranged for a young Shanghai uncle to take me up and down for nearly an hour. Based on this alone, it must be a five-star praise. I personally think it is a hotel worth checking in.
In particular, I would like to thank Liu Hai, the hotel staff who took me to visit, for a very pleasant visit experience.

After booking a hotel, I saw a lot of complaints on Xiaohongx. It was quite uneasy at first. The result was many unexpected surprises. Maybe they called us to find out that we would come to check in in advance. Not long after we sat down, the ladies came over to check in with two room cards. I have been out for almost 10 days this time, and this hotel is the fastest to check in. Then after entering the hotel, you can eat and drink for free. There are many choices for the buffet breakfast. It is not like some hotels that just use Western bread. It is suitable for my Chinese stomach. The breakfast is very comfortable... There are many good ones, so I won‚Äôt comment on them one by one. ! Next time I plan to bring my children to Shanghai to stay at J Hotel.

The hotel uses high-quality marble and a lot of glass and crystal. Each restaurant has different themes such as artwork and hardware. Needless to say, there are a lot of software staff, and the division of labor can be improved to avoid wasting labor. Since the project design is a double-layer curtain wall, the landscape in the room is average. To see the beautiful scenery, you must go to the 101 or 120 floors of the single-glazed glass. The afternoon tea on the 84th floor is worthy of praise. I stayed at the Bulgari Hotel at the same time this time. I have also stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Jinmao Tower and the Park Hyatt Hotel in Universal before. Comparing it will hurt. J Hotel is indeed a big brother.

I was full of joy to stay in the hotel I missed when I was in Shanghai last time, but I felt helpless... The bellman was enthusiastic to help with the luggage, but the tables in the lobby were not completely cleared! It doesn't matter, we can't see the invincible scenery anymore, the whole hotel is full of artistic a**osphere, it is still worth appreciating! I forgot the name of the sister who checked in, but her service is not bad! I originally wanted to experience the life of the world's second tallest hotel on a rainy day, but I didn't expect it to become an unforgettable night of this trip. A rare typhoon in Shanghai swept in. Due to the design and structure of the room, it was a fantasy that the wind was blowing all night? Woke up at two in the middle of the night? It's strange that when I called the front desk, they said that no other customers raised the same problem, and they didn't take it very seriously when I said that I changed the room! Instead, let me go to the room I want to return to listen to the sound! Reluctantly, I changed a room, but it was still the same as the prefabricated house on the construction site. It felt like the house was about to crack! I didn't sleep all night, and none of the staff took the initiative to ask! Luxurious hardware and cheap services do not match! There is a feeling of light on the surface of donkey fendan! Good-looking but not suitable for staying! I will not choose it next time! The 5,000-night room uses a millet hair dryer! It looks like a Dyson, but it blows with loud noise and low wind power! I know that you are rushing to support the limelight of national enterprises, but quality is really important, and the kettle is also slightly cheap! Light and fluffy! ! The bathing spray also uses a small amount of water on the zenith, and the height of the hand is lowüò´ In short... if you don't believe it, try it yourself

msg:It was the first time we came to J Hotel. As soon as we entered the lobby, the concierge colleagues welcomed us warmly. After we got to the 101st floor, the housekeeper Esther checked us in, introduced the room and other services. We were very good. I also thank the housekeeper Odele for the service. I like the birthday decoration in my room very much. When we checked out, the housekeeper Xiao Yang sent us to the main entrance of the hotel. The staff we met here all had smiles on their faces. Our family was very happy to stay here. We will stay here if we have the opportunity. Will come back again!

msg:I come to Shanghai several times a year. I used to love staying at the Waldorf Astoria and the Peninsula. Because I accompanied my child to travel in Shanghai, I wanted to take him to a special hotel. I saw it on Ctrip. The J Hotel in the center of Shanghai is located on the 101st floor. The height attracted me, so I chose J Hotel. First of all, the environment is absolutely good, and the second is the service, which is definitely better than hotels of the same level. It gives people a very warm feeling. The service staff are very enthusiastic and proactive, unlike some hotels It's so rigid, I don't know if it's a problem with the room type I booked, but the shower gel is from Herm√®s, and the hair dryer is from Dyson. It's really good, it's worth recommending

Seeing the butler manager Chris again, it is still a gentleman's way of hospitality, and a big smile always hangs on his face, as if it can sweep away all the fatigue in his heart. When I learned that all the arrangements during the stay will be taken care of by his team, I felt that my trip was worthwhile. Thank you for the sleep drink, thank you for the special tour, and thank you for the special drop off. I will come back next time!

The hotel environment is clean, the room layout is perfect, elegant and elegant, and the service is thoughtful, making people extremely comfortable. The hotel is equipped with butler service, no matter you are there at any time, it will give me a feeling of home, which is quite comfortable!
        The breakfast is also delicious. The key is that the service attitude is very good, and it is provided in the form of semi-buffet. We will first provide us with the choice of staple food, avoiding the inconvenience caused by serving the dishes ourselves. Because we went there near the end of breakfast, the waiter would ask if we need to add more staple food, etc., and no one urged us during the whole process. From time to time, someone came to provide us with a refill service. The service is really considerate!
        The experience of J Hotel this time is so impeccable no matter how big or small it is. Special thanks to Gloria Gina, the housekeeper who helped arrange the wedding room, Lucas, the concierge manager, and Eddie, the handsome guy who helped carry a lot of wedding supplies. Enthusiastically coming over to ask if you need help really reflects the butler service to the fullest. I am very glad that I chose J as my new house among many hotels, and I look forward to staying again next time~

Staying here is indeed a different experience, but if you want to see the scenery outside the window, it is recommended to stay in a riverside hotel.

During the stay, the noise of the toilet in the middle of the night made it difficult to sleep well. At breakfast the next day, there was a tall and handsome front desk staff who asked intimately and delayed the check-out time (forgot to pay attention to the name, but he is very handsome!) He can also accurately remember the guest's last name, very detailed and considerate ~ must be praised. When checking out, I also asked about the check-in experience. Derek xu gave a small gift and proposed to give a happy hour next time. I feel that the service is the best. ps. The only regret is that I finally went to the lobby on the first floor to pick up the luggage. Many staff downstairs may be hotel sales or others (the concierge was busy at the time) standing inside the concierge desk and not helping to pick up the luggage. Concierge to get it. The concierge guy is very nice. While waiting for the car, let us go to the lobby lounge and ask for the license plate. When the car arrives, he will call us. The details are really called. The service awareness of domestic and foreign hotels currently staying is top 1.
Hygiene: very new and very clean.
Environment: During the stay, there was a letter from a guest telling us that the exterior wall glass will be cleaned. The glass on the 101st floor is indeed a bit dirty~
Facilities: The facilities are very nice, but the double-glazing in the room is really unfriendly to the view.

You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Shanghai overlooking the city under different light and shadow changes. I thought I would catch up with the cloudy day and not see the scenery, but I met the sunrise in the sea of clouds, which was very lucky. Afternoon tea, dinner, bar, and breakfast are all of high quality. The semi-self-service method can not only satisfy individual choices, but also ensure the privacy of the environment without being too noisy.

msg:Stayed at J Hotel for the second time this month.
The last time I said that J Hotel is good, the Morpheus Hotel in Macau has a lot of imagination. This time, I learned from Liu Hai, the hotel guest relations ambassador, that J Hotel is the posthumous work of Mr. Robert Bilkey, the founder of Bilkey LLinas Design. A monument, thinking that Morpheus is the posthumous work of Zaha Hadid, I can't help feeling a little embarrassed.
When I came back this time, I tried all the restaurants that I didn‚Äôt experience last time, and I counted all the restaurants in the hotel.
The Japanese food on the 104th floor is quite satisfactory. The view by the window here feels average, because it is separated by two layers of glass that are far away. It is recommended that those who are looking for a view overlooking the city may not choose it.
But the teppanyaki in this restaurant looks very good, next time you come to live, give it a try first. The fan-shaped art installation at the entrance is the highlight of this restaurant. Great photos.
The Chinese restaurant on the 103rd floor is a bit amazing.
The first second you enter the door, you will be amazed by the Chinese red decorations. If the budget is not a problem, if you must go to a restaurant in J Hotel, I recommend the restaurant on the 103rd floor, preferably a box, oh no, that is not a box, it is a work of art! I can't help but look over my head while eating.
The service of this restaurant is also very good. At the beginning, I had a leisurely meal with my friends. Halfway through the meal, she suddenly had to rush back to a meeting. After a few reminders, the food came up immediately. Suckling Pigeon praised it~

The Italian restaurant on the 101st floor, this restaurant is relatively cost-effective. This time, the set meal includes a meal for two, because I have already been here last time, so I gave up this time.
This restaurant is also a breakfast restaurant. From the best view of the restaurant, you can see the "Dragon Gate", a very imaginative fusion of modern installation art and landscape. Post a picture later and guess where the door is.
Oh, yes, if you are a sci-fi fan, if you book this hotel, you must book breakfast included. If you don‚Äôt try the restaurant in the whole process, you must get up early to have breakfast. You can physically see it on the cloud. Futuristic city.

I didn‚Äôt go to the 120th floor to eat this time, nor did I drink the free cocktails, but the 120th floor is the Guinness World Record for the height of the restaurant. The two platforms on the opposite side can see the best sunset view in all of Shanghai.

This time I booked a Xiangyun King Room. The reservation depar**ent saw that I had chosen a modern-style suite last time, so they changed it for me to a Lingyun King Room with the same decoration style as the suite.
It is no exaggeration to say that the living experience of the Lingyun double room is even better than that of the suite. If you are a heavy bath lover like me, then this room is absolutely perfect.
While taking a bath, admiring the little Oriental Pearl, the short Jinmao...
I take my own bath, the world is smaller than me.

According to the usual practice, you have to write something short at the end. The hotel's breakfast room, lobby bar, and executive lounge did not consider that there would be people like me who are allergic to tea and coffee. I said I wanted scented tea, and the staff said there was jasmine tea, but it was still a flavored tea. ah.
I didn't order it the first time I came, but this time I came prepared and brought my own roses.
Next time I come here, I don't want to bring my own.
This wish should not be difficult to achieve, right?

Finally, I would like to talk about the most classic design of this hotel, which can be summed up in two words - "reflection".
Everything in this hotel has reflections, some on the ground, some on the ground and ceiling at the same time.
The simultaneous reflection of up and down makes the lobby on the 101st floor, which is only four meters high, look like a space-time tunnel that can be extended infinitely.
In Hotel J, every piece of art, every restaurant, and every corridor is unique because of the reflection and has its own story.
One review can't finish J Hotel, next time I will write a book...

msg:I brought the elderly in the family to stay in the highest hotel in the world. After the exquisite breakfast, Henry, the guest experience ambassador, came over politely and cordially, leading us into the art space of the hotel. Because the old man did not wear a hearing aid, Henry deliberately raised the volume and slowed down his speech during the explanation. The whole explanation was wonderful and vivid. We couldn't help but marvel at his guidance. The interior stone materials of the hotel are the essence of the world, and the soft decoration and decorations are from the world. As a top artist, seeing the gorgeous combination of Tiancheng and craftsmanship, and the perfect integration of Chinese and Western cultures, a one-hour visit is not enough for one's enjoyment.
Secondly, I would like to praise the overall service of the hotel. Every waiter I encountered was polite and gentle. We took the elderly with us, from the afternoon tea when we checked in on the first day to the meals and sightseeing on the second day, we never felt uncomfortable. depress
Finally, provide practical information for your reference: the afternoon tea on the 84th floor is rich, with a complete range of meat, vegetables, sweet, salty, sea and land, free tea and refreshments in the lobby on the 101st floor; breakfast and buffet sharing; the Chinese restaurant Jin Yan on the 103rd floor is worth experiencing, must choose Private room; the bar on the 120th floor did not go in, save it for next time

msg:After three years of the pandemic, I have not seen Shanghai for a long time. In addition to Disneyland, I also want to experience the prosperity of Shanghai at night, so I booked J Hotel. It can be said that the hardware is very good. What is rare is that there is no peculiar smell that is common in newly opened hotels. There are staff leading from the time you enter the hotel. When checking in, you only need to sit on the sofa and wait for the staff to come to check in. The welcome tea is very delicious. After checking in, a lovely girl took us to the room, and the use of various facilities in the room will also be introduced in detail.
The room facilities are very new, I love the petal bathtub, the dressing table selfie lighting should not be too coordinated, although the room is not too big, but the space utilization rate is very high.
There was fog on the two days I went there, and I didn‚Äôt see the sunrise and sunset, but with such weather, the scenery outside the window is particularly magical, and the Magic City is well-deserved. I strongly recommend joining the hotel‚Äôs tour and explanation group, and give a thumbs up to Liu Hai (I think it‚Äôs called this name), it‚Äôs really super awesome, and the past of each artwork is told. Finally, due to time constraints, there are a few floors that I didn‚Äôt have time to go to, so I‚Äôll leave it for the next stay.
The hotel's food and beverage is also good, with not many varieties, but they are all very exquisite. It's just that the activities in Shanghai are too full, and there is no time to experience all the services.
The above are all parts that I am very satisfied with the hotel. There is only one experience that deducts points: not long after checking in to the hotel, my menstrual period suddenly came early. Because I was in a hurry to go out this time, I didn't bring my own sanitary napkins with me, so I called the housekeeper for help. Surprisingly, the hotel didn't have spare sanitary napkins (I have seen warm reminders in some hotels and even shopping malls that if there is an emergency need in this regard, you can contact customer service). The housekeeper suggested that I buy it online and let the takeaway boy deliver it to the first floor and then the staff will deliver it up. I did it immediately. The takeaway boy also delivered the things in a very short time. However, I waited for half an hour and no one delivered it upstairs, so I called the housekeeper again to confirm whether there was a staff member to deliver it or I needed to go downstairs to pick it up myself. The housekeeper replied that someone would deliver it and asked me to wait for the news. I waited for nearly 20 minutes and there was no news. While I was waiting in the room, I remembered that the housekeeper said that the iPad in the room can also provide room service. After some research, I found that it might be more appropriate to find the concierge department to deliver things. The funny thing is that the iPad in the room of a Chinese self-owned brand hotel There is no Chinese input method, so I can only send messages in English. What's even funnier is that the response is very fast. Almost within a minute after sending, someone from the concierge called the room and told me that a staff had delivered it after confirming that the room number had been noted on my order. But the most amazing thing is that less than three minutes after I finally got the sanitary napkin after waiting for an hour, the housekeeper called my mobile phone again and asked if I was satisfied with their work. I was in a hurry to go to the bathroom and could only let my husband say that I was satisfied for me, but did they really not feel guilty about the word "satisfied"?
It is recommended that the hotel management should not only emphasize service awareness when training employees in the future, but also ask professionals with rich practical experience in the industry to talk about more practical cases. What guests need is not the attitude of employees to say polite words in emergencies, but the ability to think calmly and solve problems satisfactorily.
I haven't written a serious review for a long time, because when I stayed in the hotel, I felt the pride of the company in some employees, which touched me. I hope that J Hotel will make up for its shortcomings as soon as possible, become a leader in the industry, and develop better and better!

The administrative courtesy included is actually an unlimited gourmet buffet from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm. The two daily art tastings must be attended by children. It is an eye-opening spiritual feast. Special thanks to the art appraiser Liu Hai for his humor I am very loving to accompany my children to see the introduction of big companies in the building, which increases the score by 100. Personally, I think it is especially suitable for parent-child travel, couple travel, and family travel. In fact, it is suitable for everything, just come! An absolute internet celebrity hotel in the future!

msg:It was my mother's 79th birthday on Sunday, so I booked a staycation at J Hotel, which I had been thinking about for a night, to celebrate her birthday and leave her with a beautiful and unforgettable memory. The day before I checked in, my personal butler Xiao Liang called me to understand my check-in needs in detail. When I learned that it was my mother's birthday, she tried her best to help me arrange the room with the best floor and the best view in the room type I booked and the birthday decoration. and late check-out (I am also very grateful to the young ladies Yao Yao and Lynda who made a beautiful birthday decoration in the room and personally wrote a warm birthday greeting card and sent a birthday üéÇ. My mother was very touched and happy). As soon as I stepped into the door of the hotel, I was amazed by the refreshing fragrance of flowers. There were so many flowers, so beautiful, so fresh, and smelled so good that even the eyes and nose of me, a nympho******, couldn't get enough. Then the welcoming lady led us into the hotel, and Henry kindly took us to the direct elevator while introducing us. When I arrived at the 101 lobby, my mother was excited and couldn't wait to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the tall building. The housekeeper Yang Dong waited for us patiently and with a smile. Then we sat on the sofa and checked in comfortably. Yang Dong enthusiastically helped us carry all the luggage and bags, took us to the room, and introduced the room carefully. All the functions and the use of electrical appliances in the house, and also showed me other room types, thank you very much Yang Dong. Next, I participated in a journey of Yunzhen that was surprising, amazed and praised under Mr. Liu's wonderful and fascinating commentary. So unforgettable, so luxurious, so beautiful and so unique design, full of charm, beyond imagination! After the visit, we went to the Ge Lounge for a buffet afternoon tea. The afternoon tea food was exquisite and delicious. Especially the waiters and managers who received us were all smiling, cordial and warm as spring. Thank you very much. And Tina, who was very grateful for the night room service, enthusiastically asked her mother if she needed help. The next morning, I went to 120 Tianzhijin, an incomparable view, to enjoy the gorgeous sunrise. Next, there was a rich, fresh, diverse, and super-quality breakfast. Remi and all the waiters provided cordial, enthusiastic and professional services, plus it was spacious, bright and comfortable. The environment with beautiful landscapes whetted our appetites, and we wanted to try each of them, but it was a pity that our stomachs were not big enough. Here, I would also like to thank the personal butler Xiaoliang again. Not only did he ask about our check-in needs before we checked in and try his best to meet them, but from the moment we checked in to checkout, he kept following up to ask us how we felt, whether we were satisfied, and what else. In response to our needs, we asked the waiter to provide a non-slip mat and a crystal-clear gourd chopstick holder filled with the Chinese character for longevity. It was so beautiful. My mother liked it very muchüíï. Xiaoliang‚Äôs meticulous service from beginning to end made us happy. Very touching and warm, very impressive, thank you very very much! The two-day and one-night birthday staycation ended happily and successfully. The whole process was surrounded by the warm and friendly smiles and professional services of every hotel employee. I enjoyed it very much. My mother was very satisfied and happy! Thank you very much J Hotel, it is really worth the moneyüëçüòÑüëç

No wonder why Ms. Li has opened the swimming pool for so long and is still in trial operation, and on an ordinary weekend, I feel that there are not many people in the hotel, so I say that the appoin**ent is full, which is a little regrettable.
On the 10th anniversary, I struggled for a long time, and finally chose the relatively new J Hotel. The package bought by Ctrip, 5680 includes a Japanese food on the 104th floor. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is average.
The hotel service is really good. When you go to the first floor of the B3 elevator, someone will take you up to the 101st floor. You don‚Äôt have to go to CHECK IN by yourself, just sit on the sofa, and someone will check you in. By the way, the lobby lounge benefits included in the package are here, including some biscuits and tea, and the executive benefits on the 84th floor have relatively more varieties, including drinks, sushi, and barbecue.
The skyline double room is on the 87th floor. The door of the room is more distinctive. The color of each door is different. Ours is just red. The decoration for the anniversary is a swan shape on the bed and a piece of cake. The introduction said that because of energy saving and carbon reduction, there is a large area outside the window and then there is glass, so it greatly affects the scenery and is almost invisible. The big bed doesn't look big, but it's actually 2 meters. It's enough to sleep two big and one small. The water pressure in the bathroom is very strong, and there is floor heating, which is a pleasant surprise. The soft and hard beer tea bags in the MINI bar can be taken away, and all snacks are charged. Breakfast says 2 adults, but the hotel also defaults to 2 adults and 1 child (the child is over 8 years old), which saves a fortune. The breakfast is rich in content, semi-self-service, and the dishes you order are beautiful, especially the waffles, which are delicious.
The most worthwhile thing about the whole hotel is the rare visit on the cloud. The gathering on the 1st floor, each at 10:00 am and 4:00 pm every day, takes about 1 hour, and will introduce you to some of the more distinctive artworks in the hotel, especially on the 103rd floor , Whether it is entering the door or the box, it is very shocking and worth a visit.

The elevator may cause discomfort to your ears, but you will definitely be amazed when you arrive in 61 seconds. The front desk is like a crystal bowl. Before you check in, you can take a look at the scenery here. The butler checks in with half-squatting service. The afternoon tea on the 84th floor is from 14:00-18:00, which basically saves you even dinner. There are many styles and good taste, and the design of the small private room is very considerate. The hotel tours twice a day are worth recommending to see the Chinese-style walker and Panlong, and the 120-story Silk Road.
Facilities: Basically everything you want is available here. The furnishings in the room are very gorgeous, all of which are crystal works, the bathtub is in the shape of white magnolia, and the bathing equipment is Diptik. The soft drinks and beer in the minibar are free. My favorite is the mini pad to control the room, lights and curtains with one click. There is a hidden night light by the bed, which is very thoughtful. The amount of water on the 91st floor is very sufficient, which makes me very impressed with this cloud hotel.
Hygiene: It is white everywhere, so there is no room for dust.
Environment: All kinds of artworks are luxurious from the moment you enter the door. It is very natural to combine Chinese and Western cultures.
Service: Everyone will make you feel welcome, respected and cared for. Henry Liu sent us out of the store and talked with my son very kindly. He will definitely choose this place next time.
Every time you travel, you will have regrets and you will have the next choice. Due to the heavy rain and fog, you did not make the trip to watch the sunrise, so you will definitely come back next time.
It is said that reading thousands of books is not as good as traveling thousands of miles. The biggest gain from taking children to experience the journey is that he feels that all good lives must be won by himself.

msg:Hotel J is really nice and luxurious. There are two hotel tours every day on 10/16, showing you various luxurious decorations. There are piles of cherries at the breakfast buffet to grab at will. The tea bags in the room are T9, and beer and soft drinks are free. [Laughing] [Laughing] From the first floor, there will be someone who will follow you upstairs after checking in. Except for brushing your face, it will be done on the sofa in the lobby bar, and you will also be given mooncakes as souvenirs and toys for children. You can help yourself to drinks and snacks in the lobby bar when you are hungry. Free self-service afternoon tea for two when you check in (there is a big piece of beef, if you don‚Äôt go out, you can solve the dinner completely). Compared with the 4000 of some parent-child hotels in Hangzhou, the room rate of more than 6,000 per night is a bargain. But people are already in heaven. hehe. I will bring my relatives and friends here next time.

There are hotel staff coming up to say hello everywhere, including pushing and pulling luggage greetings and smiling faces. They are also thoughtfully equipped with sweets everywhere, which is convenient for taking the elevator, and the ear pressure is uncomfortable when going up and down. I booked the Xiangyun King Room. Because of the outer layer of glass, the view from the room is slightly dark. It is recommended to go to the lobby on the 101st floor to take pictures and the glass scenery is very clear. What you must not miss is the two daily hotel tours and tours. I am very grateful to Mr. Liu Hai for his company and explanation on December 31. I thought it was just a quick tour, but I didn't expect the artwork to be more than an hour long, and the story behind it was explained, and the children listened with gusto. It feels very fulfilling. Plus a special New Year's Eve party for New Year's Eve. It feels like yesterday was spent eating and drinking. The turndown service is also very considerate. The room cards are all handwritten. There are many varieties of breakfast, and even when the room is full, the service is not delayed, and it is timely and in place. The swimming pool is scheduled and open in reality, if necessary, please confirm with the housekeeper in advance. Fortunately, it was photographed. In 2022, the last round of sun went down and in 2023, the first round of sun rose. The child left a card in the room before checking out, saying that he would go again. Very satisfied stay!

It coincided with Qixi Festival, and I made a special arrangement. I also gave a fruit candy cake, because I noted in advance that it was the wedding anniversary. Unless the room type is a top-level suite, you don‚Äôt need to care about others, because the two-story glass curtain wall and steel structure, the view of the room is very limited, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 60 square meters does not feel large enough. The main viewing still depends on the 101st floor and several restaurants. The swimming pool is a bit disappointing, but like the room type, the structure of the building does not allow a swimming pool with a view. The service is definitely pretty good. Free minibar, free bar in the lobby, afternoon tea in the Yi Lounge is enough for the elderly to eat and drink. It's dinner, and there are various wines. I tried a pink, which is very good. You can‚Äôt miss the treasure on the cloud. Liu Hai‚Äôs introduction is very devoted. Let‚Äôs learn about the decoration and design of the hotel. The one-hour tour is very good. If you are lucky, you can see the perfect sunrise and sunset. It depends on God's will. This time I left regrets, but overall it is not bad. He sneaked into Duoyun Bookstore without an appoin**ent at night.
As long as the elderly are happy, the 24-hour schedule is very full, so it is worth it

There is nothing to say about the hotel's hardware facilities, except that it is good.
When I step into the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, someone will guide and introduce the architectural features and materials of the Shanghai Center, and the handsome guy in the elevator will also introduce the elevator and height...
When I checked in on the 101st floor, I was greeted by a sweet smiling Ms. Tian (I forgot her English name) at the front desk. She gave me a detailed introduction while kneeling on one leg. I felt distressed!
The picture of the Xiangyun King Room is not very stunning, WOW~ But in fact, when you are in the room, you feel that the room is large in size, transparent and bright, except for the bathroom, everything else is transparent. The curtain at the head of the bed is made of metal gold thread.
Stylish, light luxury, elegant luxury~ The bathroom is very large, and there is an oversized petal-shaped bathtub, while soaking in the bath, while looking at the river view...
What a wonderful life
The decoration style of the rooms, the decoration style of the corridors in the public areas, etc. are all based on Chinese elements. I am also proud of the art of incorporating unique Chinese elements.
Several restaurants in the hotel have their own characteristics in terms of decoration and dishes. I visited almost every restaurant and public area.
The hotel may be a little expensive for one night, but after checking in, I think it is worth it~ It is indeed expensive for a reason.
I recommend that you have the opportunity to experience

The housekeeper will contact you 3 days in advance to confirm, ask about the number of people staying, approximate arrival time, whether it is a memorial day, etc., and remind you of the location of the parking lot. The day of check-in went very smoothly. After arriving at the lobby on the first floor, we were accompanied by staff throughout the whole process. The personal butler this time is Ms. Wang Zhenzhen. She has a friendly attitude and is very concerned about the birthdays of the two children. She sent us to the room in person. The room has been decorated for birthdays, and birthday gifts and cakes were given to the children. She also personally accompanied her IT colleagues to explain whether the TV can be plugged into HDMI, and successfully let the children play the game console! Thank you very much for the service this time, very considerate.
The hotel's afternoon tea and breakfast are all online, and the children are very happy to eat. The public areas on the 84th, 101st, and 120th floors have different scenery everywhere.
The overall stay experience is very good, and my daughter had an unforgettable birthday.

When you enter the hotel, someone will guide the way, and a special check-in person will be in charge, which saves you the embarrassment of not being familiar with the first time you visit. The room is on the 90th floor, facing the Bund, with a unique view. The butler also took us into the room and explained the features and services of the room. There are many works of art in the hotel, you can listen to the explanations, the housekeeper spoke very well, my daughter was very happy! It is very convenient to order meals in the room, 24 hours, and the taste is also very good. Breakfast is a la carte plus buffet mode, both Chinese and Western. There are many small private rooms in the executive lounge with distinctive names, and there are many types of afternoon tea! In the evening, we dine on the 120th floor of the hotel. The night view is beautiful. The food may not look like much, but the actual portion is quite large and delicious. The most surprising thing is the magic of Mr. J, the resident magician of Yunzhijin. It was the first time to interact with a magician at close range. Although it was all small magic, it was amazing to participate in it myself! The whole butler service is very humanized and thoughtful! Will come again next time!

msg:J Hotel is the first hotel to be seriously reviewed. Among the many 5,000-a-night ordinary apar**ent room prices, there are many strong competitors. If you count the Guinness certification records such as "the world's tallest hotel" and "the world's highest restaurant", it is already worth a visit.
    But J Hotel obviously has more ambitions than that. When you come here, you will find that J has mission and responsibility. The evaluation of 4.9 points is not groundless. Let‚Äôs talk about what makes J different from the standard equipment of luxury hotels:
    1. Design and feng shui, if you want to know these interesting stories, you can find a guide to learn more about it... from the development of the city to the echo of the elements in each private room... and then start the magical journey of the city of Shanghai . And the explainer is very nice and knowledgeable. Families with young children can use it as a half-day study tour.
   2. The restaurant on the 120th floor, keywords: the highest restaurant in the world, Shanghai sunset view, rare and delicious Shanghai cuisine.
        Don‚Äôt blame me for looking down on Huaiyang cuisine, but there are very few restaurants that can do it well, unlike the popular French, Italian, Japanese, Sichuan, Guangdong and Hunan, Shanghai cuisine, it‚Äôs not easy to cook, but it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs delicious, but it‚Äôs well done There are too few. However, with the strength of Jin Jiang Group, the strength of all restaurants should not be underestimated.
  3. Service
    The service item is worth mentioning separately. After all, I was forced to stay in a domestic hotel during the Spring Festival for three years due to the epidemic. There are few people engaged in the hotel industry in China, the salaries of waiters are relatively low, and they are motivated to work overtime during the Spring Festival, and the number of people during the holiday peak is unprecedented. I also asked myself to control it well, not to make repeated mistakes and not to complain, but I have traveled to domestic hotels during the Spring Festival and none of them have done so, and most of them can only be made up for afterwards. This time, because I was staying in a local hotel, relatives and friends came to get together, there were many requests and few room openings, and there was no accidental misunderstanding in the middle, but the managers on duty and the guides of the two shifts responded very well, with a sincere and sincere attitude, It can be seen that the love for one's job, the maintenance of the J Hotel brand, and the concern for Shanghai's word-of-mouth, let people go back to the era when everyone won glory for the country, which is very rare.
    Finally, I hope that J Hotel will get better and better and become a world-class brand. Thanks to manager Zhao Wenbo, the commentator Liu Hai, and the manager on duty on the 28th. I will visit again if I have the opportunity.

Anyway, L‚ÄôOccitane also said it in the past. There are also some care products, such as cotton swabs, which are made of wooden sticks. It‚Äôs just that these details are of poor quality and a bit broken. The level of so-called housekeepers is uneven. It‚Äôs not all right, but the housekeeper on the phone is okay. The housekeeper at check-in seems to be new. I asked for toiletries in advance and didn‚Äôt provide them. The next afternoon, the high-speed train was late, so I wanted to check out later. The housekeeper at check-in asked for 12 Point, more than 10 points and 20 points will be considered as a half-day room rate, it seems like ****, but the housekeeper was postponed and refunded immediately after calling. The attitude is very good, and the overall feeling is that the check-in experience seriously does not match the price of more than 5,000

In fact, since the 100th floor and below are double-layer curtain wall glass, the lighting is generally affected, so even if the viewing experience is upgraded, the viewing experience will be greatly reduced. The hair dryer in Tianji is Xiaomi, which is unbelievable for a price of more than 5,000 a night. The breakfast is semi-self-service, and the variety is not particularly large. In a word, the price is still lacking compared with the service you enjoy.

The decoration of the hotel is very good, it may be one of the best decorated hotels in China at present... The decoration surpasses the Rosewood Hotel in Hong Kong.
The hotel provides afternoon tea, which can be enjoyed by all guests entering the store. The afternoon tea is good, but due to the large number of people, the overall a**osphere is very poor, chaotic and not quiet. The washroom in the afternoon tea was dirty with vomit marks and smudges and used paper towels littering the floor. In the afternoon tea, there is a service staff who is responsible for refilling wine with a kind attitude, but a very fat service staff in the food and beverage depar**ent has a very bad attitude and is not polite.
After we reported the above problems to the manager, the hotel responded quickly. When we went to Huaiyang Cuisine for dinner, the restaurant manager was very concerned and apologized.
I hope that J can improve the quality of service and match the software with the hardware.

The problem was discovered by accident during the meal. The manager on duty gave feedback on the day and he generously admitted the problem and quickly gave a solution. The efficiency was really unexpected. The next day the general manager even came forward to explain and apologize in person. Avoid the situation but I am shocked by the importance of the hotel. The service is really good
The second is the concierge depar**ent. Because this trip is on the anniversary day, there is a courier that needs to be sent to the concierge depar**ent and then delivered. I encountered the courier's private behavior, so I couldn't get the courier. It was more than 11 o'clock in the middle of the night. Thank you Xinyi at the front desk (surname Hehe I forgot the specific name, but I remember that she was called Xinyi, a little girl who didn‚Äôt wear glasses) she was very enthusiastic to help solve the problem and even asked the courier to follow up on the problem. Sherly in the concierge depar**ent helped to solve the problem the next day? Or the leader named Sherry also came forward to apologize. I said no need to apologize. It‚Äôs the delivery problem. I never blamed you, but she said I‚Äôm still sorry for not being able to help you. Ask if we need a late check-out. I originally wanted to refuse, but the next night really I agreed without sleeping well and even gave me a souvenir. The service is really good.
Finally left, thank you to the concierge arch. A boy surnamed Qin was very polite and helped us push a lot of luggage in the parking lot to find a parking space. He put it in the car carefully before leaving. If I remember correctly, I found a courier. He is also always helping to make suggestions and answer questions.
Including the decoration of the room when we first checked in. The night room is really considerate and you can rest and sleep when you go back.
Among similar hotels, J Hotel is really excellent. Compared with other hotels, one is one, two is two. It follows the rules and there is no service interaction. This time, it is deeply humanized and considerate for customers. It must be a five-star praise

But I didn‚Äôt expect that this chance made me know him again, and I was deeply attracted by him. I really have to experience it myself to know whether I like it or not. Let‚Äôs talk about the room first. The rooms of J Hotel are divided into two types: modern and Chinese. , (I guess what I saw before was Chinese üòÖ) I stayed in modern style this time, and I personally like it very much. The layout of the room is reasonable, and the whole is very transparent. Lying on the bed and looking out the window really feels like sleeping on the clouds! Secondly, I would like to talk about the service that I value the most. It really makes me feel at home. Whether it is the front desk or the guest room, it is impeccable. In particular, my butler, Xiao Xiao, always asks me what else I need. And help, very caring. Of course, there is no gold. If you want to give the hotel some advice, I think the breakfast is flawed.

The check-in time is set at 1500, and the actual check-in time is 1600. The front desk arranges a special person to use this hour to guide the guests to visit all floors of the 101-120 floors, and arrange afternoon tea at the 84 Yi Lounge. The hotel services are all in place. Because it is the management of Jinjiang Group, I feel that there are many Shanghai locals in the hotel service staff, and they are very kind.

The housekeeper, Victor-yu, checked in very quickly, and the introduction was very careful, because I didn't want to go out to eat, he took me to know all the restaurants in the hotel in a short time, and introduced some modern artworks in the hotel by the way. He was polite, warm and just right. Get a comprehensive understanding of the hotel. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, with Shanghai local characteristics, fried dumplings are delicious, and there are some special Western food items, which are really some small highlights, and the coffee tastes good. The service is enthusiastic, and every staff member will be very polite when they see the guests, without being overly enthusiastic. The ceiling design of the Japanese food restaurant has its own characteristics, with the feeling of broken diamonds. Because I have a lot of uncertainties in my work, I have given some attention to the extension and upgrade of the room. I am grateful to the housekeeper. Those who work hard will have good luck! I hope that next time I come, I will not be in such a hurry and have time to look at the artworks in the hotel. Will come again, thanks to all the staff for their efforts, thanks to the housekeeper Victor-yu

The hotel room has a crystal-clear feeling. The minibar is free to drink except for alcohol. The facilities are very new. The bathtub is in the shape of a magnolia, which is quite special. It is very comfortable to lie down and take a bath [Âë≤Áâô].
Afternoon tea is quite rich, and the elderly are happy to eat. I took a few small ones to swim in the swimming pool, the water felt a bit cold, but swimming at such a high place is a different experience.
There is nothing to say about the service of the hotel. They are all handsome men and women. They will greet you as soon as they see them.

msg:At the end of the Spring Festival, I spent three days and two nights at J Hotel with a great experience. The hotel's hardware and software facilities perfectly match the reputation of No.1 luxury hotel in Shanghai. The most important thing is that the hotel is really well-run, and it almost responds to the requests of the guests. Once you check in, you will take the initiative to give free breakfast to the third family member who is accompanying you, and other equal guest trea**ent, which makes you feel very warm. The old Shanghai Koehler in the package (the English name of the very friendly and enthusiastic gentleman in my impression seems to be Sam) introduced the parade hotel to increase the in-depth understanding of the hotel, which is very in place. The next day, when I was shooting the sunset, I met Beeka, the super nice foreign lady in the lobby manager, who took a lot of photos and videos of the sunset that were close to professional standards for our family. I was so happy!
This itinerary is comfortable and happy. I hope that the business of J Hotel will be booming, and it will always maintain such a peak state, just like the Guinness World Records World's Tallest Hotel on its 120th floor...

Just staying in the hotel can play for two days, and the scenery is everywhere. The service is also very good, thanks to VictoR-yu, on the one hand, he helped to arrange a good room, and on the other hand, he helped to find the lost glasses. A very satisfactory stay.

The overall decoration is very luxurious, we went to the 120th floor for a lunch, the view is very good. The sun is very comfortable.
The hotel's breakfast and the food in the executive lounge are also very good. I am a picky person, and I am quite satisfied with them.
The disadvantage is that the design of the room seems unreasonable, and there is no privacy at all in the toilet and shower room.

The viewing effect of the room is average, because of the double glass, the effect shown in Figure 4. The night view is the restaurant on the 120th floor, which looks pretty good.
What the hotel needs to improve most is the service. The overall attitude is acceptable, not enthusiastic, and it depends on the person to order. The concierge, lobby, and restaurants did not meet the service standards that ordinary five-stars should have.
I checked in after 4 pm on the fifth day of the new year, and was told that the room hadn't been cleaned yet, and I had to wait for an hour and a half. I wanted to take a rest with my child, and asked why it hadn't been cleaned, saying that the room was full. It is understandable that the room is full during the Spring Festival, but there is no apology.

This is probably the feeling of being at home. (Special thanks to Beeka and several old Shanghai Koehler for their thoughtful concierge service). The room is also very nice, big enough, high-quality, and well-designed. The room for a family of four doesn't feel cramped at all. The minibar is high-end and most of it is free.

Room: not too fancy style but clean and bed very comfortable. Afternoon tea: The advantage is that the time is very long, in addition to drinks and desserts there is also meat. Service: It is the best among the hotels I have stayed in. Other hotels respond to every request, but here is the one that responds first. The slight disadvantage is the food and drink. If the hotel is positioned as a luxury hotel, it is recommended that afternoon tea and breakfast still need to work hard, especially the afternoon tea, which is too sweet and greasy to have an aftertaste, and other salty dishes are not delicious, which is a pity. But the cake sent to the room on the birthday is not only beautiful but also very delicious. It would be great if it was of this level! Because of the bad weather, it is a pity that there is almost no landscape. I hope to come back next time when the weather is better and see a more perfect J Hotel.

The room butler will clean up the room after the guests go out at any time And make up mineral water and other items.
The hotel is very grand. In addition to the welcome fruit every day, the mineral water is constantly replenished (for people like me who like to drink tea, I am super satisfied, the mineral water I brought in the car was finally brought back intact), According to my statistics, the hotel provides more than a dozen bottles of mineral water and more than a dozen bottles of various free drinks and beers a day in each room, and the hotel provides two free cloud afternoon teas worth 528 yuan per person for hotel guests. Very rich, comparable to a buffet, even with red wine barbecue...

In the afternoon We went out to play around, and when we got back to the room, we found that there were supplies in the room, which were very considerately arranged. The hotel also provided tour introductions, afternoon tea and other courtesy. The only fly in the oin**ent is that there are fewer types of breakfast, which can only be regarded as full.

In the lobby, I felt the warm reception of the housekeeper Gina. She took us to all the distinctive places in the hotel and explained to us in detail, making us feel as if we were at home. We also gave our baby a special plush toy made by the hotel, which the children like very much. The environment and meals in the executive lounge are also great, and the breakfast is also exquisite. In the highest hotel in China, I enjoyed the most comfortable service. The experience in the cloud left a deep impression, and I spent two warm and enjoyable days. The lights were on at night, and I took a lot of photos in the lobby on the 101st floor, and I slowly recalled it when I went back.

        Various introductions along the way, various blockbuster films, and finally the happy hour at the Yi Lounge on the 84th floor, where the afternoon tea can be enjoyed until 20:00 (I have been eating and eating, and the originally scheduled dinner has been cancelled): from the beginning of the bread, Donuts - Roast Beef, Roast Lamb, Grilled Pork Chops, Grilled Chicken Skewers - Chinese-style rice cakes, what kind of crisps - two types of Japanese sushi, dried fruits and nuts, bacon, smoked salmon, various cheeses - Two kinds of fried noodles, salad, fruit - small Western-style pastries, biscuits, gummies (children's favorite) - fruit platter, various drinks. There are private rooms and small tables by the window to choose from, and we have been eating and chatting all afternoon... Finally, don‚Äôt forget two cocktails in one room.
        The breakfast on the 101st floor is delicious again. Order and pick up by yourself. The vegetarian chicken noodles are more delicious to order. The vegetarian chicken is super delicious. The tofu flower is also said to be delicious, but I went late and didn't get it. The western style has a double yolk omelette, served with potato pancakes and grilled mushrooms, which tastes good too. Jasmine is more recommended to relieve greasy. Others can figure it out. What you take depends on your personal preference... Anyway, breakfast is full and satisfying.

The service staff in blue suits on the first floor is really a model that other hotels can emulate. Needless to say, they are enthusiastic. They are very professional. They are very appropriate in what they say to anyone they meet. Every time they see them, they are respectful and polite. It is comfortable and left us with a deep impression. The hotel's breakfast is semi-buffet, and the dishes are not rich, but it is definitely enough to eat, and it is relatively exquisite. In the afternoon, there is an executive afternoon tea, some small cakes, beef, and ice cream. The environment is very good. It is very quiet. I feel that the hotel as a whole is very high-end.

OK, none of them!). Sure enough, after the front desk manager Angus knew our "high requirements" for the weather, he started to help us pay attention to the weather forecast one to two weeks in advance, which was very touching! He also carefully checked the room we stayed in last time, and arranged a different style from the last room this time, allowing us to experience a different style, thank you again üëç! In addition, the executive lounge of J Hotel is the best in terms of food variety and quality among all the hotels we have stayed in!

Seeing that we had children with us, she asked us if we needed to go swimming. She said that the swimming pool was only open during the day. The temperature is around 26 degrees. Because we didn't bring swimsuits, we chose to experience the world's highest gym. The equipment in the gym includes a stair climbing machine that I like, and there is also an oxygen bar that I can't play. The foreign manager in the lobby lounge was tall and handsome. He said his name was Remy, and told him to go to the happy hour after two o‚Äôclock. He was there. I saw him again when the countdown counted down to night. He was everywhere. , He said that he will be there wherever he is needed, hahaha, the cute little foreigner is very impressive. The receptionists at the front desk are mostly Shanghai Ning, and they chatted very cordially. Jen, who took us to the room, gave a very detailed introduction. Shelly Wu, who greeted us in the lobby, gave our baby a big giraffe, and the baby slept at night. He sleeps with it and doesn't want to let go. In the evening, I left my baby to participate in the hotel's countdown event, but unfortunately I didn't win the prize, so I had to come back next year. The grand prize is a house coupon, I'm really envious. The room I stayed in this time was very spacious and bright, and the small biscuits delivered at night were full of milk. The semi-buffet breakfast on the 101st floor has a lot of choices. Eggs Benedict and egg rolls are delicious. I know that everyone stays up late during the New Year and can eat breakfast until 11 o'clock. After eating well, you can continue to sleep before checking out. It was Jen when we were in the room, and he also helped us sell the parking coupons and sent us downstairs. It was a very good stay experience. Ascending the New Year, everything will be fine.

msg:Hey, because ordinary girls want to have a perfect birthday, so I choose to choose, I still booked the J Hotel, which opened last year, it is relatively new. I ordered the Lingyun room.
Arrived at 4 pm and drove there. The parking lot is easy to find and very friendly to female drivers. There is a roundabout when you enter, go around and come back to the underground b3. There are many places and very spacious, you can park at will. Then when you check out, report the license plate and room number at the hotel concierge on the first floor, and you can park for free. There is a receptionist at the elevator. Although they will not help with luggage, they will help press the elevator. From b3 to the 1st floor, then change the elevator to the 101st floor. When I entered, because the staff at the reception happened to receive the guests who were walking in front, I went to the front desk to check in by myself. Before I came, I read the comments and said that I can sit Registered and did not enjoy it. Check-in is simply filling out a form and paying a deposit, which is very smooth. The lady at the front desk said that when I check out, I can give me a wooden room card to keep as a souvenir, and then take me to the room and introduce the room facilities to me. Gave me a timetable for the hotel afternoon tea and breakfast, and by the way free and chargeable items for the minibar. The room is not very big, but if you live alone, it is more than enough.
I sat and rested for a while before going to the afternoon tea at the 84th floor lounge. Before I came, I read the comments that there would be a butler to arrange the itinerary. After I came, I didn't feel the service. There were simply a lot of staff, and it all depended on asking for directions from beginning to end. When you arrive at the lounge, you can report the room number, and then enjoy afternoon tea. There is no window seat, so I found a small private room to sit and eat a lot, most of which are bread and cakes. The photos are good, and I can basically eat enough, but I feel that because of the curtain wall, the night scene is not very clear. About 6 o'clock, I wanted to go to the most beautiful sunset cocktail, and I didn't know how many floors, so I came to 101 and happened to meet a staff who looked like a supervisor. The man was really nice and took me to 120. The first floor is the brocade of the sky, and then I introduced afternoon tea and murals. Only at this time did the service attitude of the hotel change. The restaurant staff didn't ask me what I wanted to drink. After taking me to the sofa by the window, they gave me a mojito. The night scene here is very clear, there is no curtain wall blocking, it is very suitable for taking selfies. In the evening, people came to eat one after another, and they were all taken inside. The decoration of this restaurant is beautiful and luxurious.
After returning to the room in the evening, because I didn't have dinner, I ordered a takeaway, a red dish. Then I thought I was going to go down and get it,
The takeaway brother said that the hotel staff said they would deliver it. I waited for half an hour and no one came, so I called the front desk. After waiting for two minutes, a handsome young man brought it over, but he was very indifferent and asked me to sign a food exemption agreement. His arrogant service attitude felt that he ordered takeout and this hotel was out of place. After I was full, I planned to cut the cake, because the hotel said that smoking is not allowed, otherwise the room will be charged for one night. I wonder if it is not possible to light candles. I thought about the 5k deposit, so I did not light candles to blow the candles. . The room was pitch-dark and couldn't see the night view, so I decided to take a bath to relieve the boredom. The bathtub is not bad. I brought a disposable bath bag and took a bath safely and at ease. Speaking of which, the toiletries and toiletries include Hermes and diptyque, which are very good. The toothbrush and comb are all made of wood. I took them away when I checked out, and I liked them. The inside of the bathrobe is fluffy and comfortable to wear. I like it very much.
It was past 12 o'clock after taking a shower, and the night bed was already turned on before I went back to my room. I went straight to sleep after washing. The bed is very comfortable, and the lights are all controlled by ipad, you can turn off the lights, close the curtains, and ask for butler service. Then I still don't know what the housekeeper can do, hahahaha.
I woke up at 6:00 in the morning. I remember that the lady at the front desk told me that this is a room where I can watch the sunrise. I couldn't wait to open the blackout curtains. The landscape is more beautiful. As soon as I woke up, I started to pat and pat, but if the sun was covered by clouds, it would not look good when it was foggy. Breakfast on Saturday is 7-11 o'clock. I only go to eat at 10.40. At the other end of 101, you can also see the river view here. The breakfast is semi-buffet. I ordered a lot, so I ate it as a brunch. I think the better ones are Xiao Long Bao and Baked Sausage. It's sunny here, and it's really nice to take pictures. At 11.40, a waiter said that their lunch was going to be opened, and asked to eat quickly. Well, that's fine. Look at the table they are setting up for lunch. It doesn't matter, the heart of beauty is as tolerant as the sea.
After I went back, I slept for a while, because the hotel can check out at 2 o'clock, and I can take away the free drinks and toiletries in the mini bar, I packed all of them, hahaha. When I checked out, the front desk really gave me my room card and a booklet, and asked me if I wanted to call a car for me. The service attitude of this hotel is a bit uneven. The little brother who helped press the elevator at 101 has a good attitude. After all, to go to any floor, you must first go to the 101st floor to transfer. This elevator is prone to tinnitus and dizziness. Remember to take candy.

Fortunately, I was accompanied by hotel staff from the moment I entered the door. The hotel is very Chinese-style, with many artworks and a magnificent feeling. The elevator goes directly to the 101st floor for check-in, and the lobby overlooks the Huangpu River on the Bund. It is indeed an excellent location for the tallest building in China.
The room type I stayed in is a new Chinese style. The room can be described as luxurious, with all kinds of glass crystals, and the spare parts are also Herm√®s. The view of the arranged room is also good, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower.
The service after the whole check-in is nothing to say. The hotel staff I saw from the beginning are full of temperament, and the butler service is even more comprehensive. Let me nominate Geng Xinyi, the receptionist who checked in for us. She is very enthusiastic and takes good care of the children. Well, like family like friends. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will experience J Hotel again! See you next time!

I took the little red book in the room and guided the whole hotel. The strong cultural a**osphere aroused people's curiosity. During the period, I ran into Ms. Wei Xiuli who cleaned the room. She warmly introduced the hotel and cared about our stay. Sincerity is beyond words. I feel that the humanistic quality of the entire hotel is good, the service concept is paramount, and the hardware and software are commendable. The dishes in Tianzhijin Restaurant on the 120th floor are delicious. The buffet breakfast on the 101st floor can be more varied.

The room is my favorite style, very modern and simple yet luxurious, with high-level hardware and software. In terms of landscape, although the glass in the Shanghai Center can't see anything at night, it's quite a strange feeling to see Lujiazui three-piece suits under your feet when the light is good during the day. The only downside is that the Chinese food for breakfast is not up to standard. There is still a big gap between the noodles and bean curd that we Shanghainese have grown up with.

As a mother who owns a hotel at home, this is already the nth hotel we have experienced, but this J Hotel has left an impression on our family both in terms of facilities and services. They are all top1, so write a review while the iron is hot:
1. The sound insulation of this hotel is excellent, and no other hotel in my impression can surpass it, so people like me, who must not sleep well when staying in a hotel, can sleep well for a night.
2. The service of the hotel has surpassed many large international groups, and we are proud of Jin Jiang. The butler, Pan Jing, answers every question, is considerate, and provides proactive and meticulous service, but is not overly enthusiastic, allowing guests to retain a sense of comfort. This is a good measure. There is also a Liu Hai manager in the lobby, which is also impressive. There are his hotel explanations at 16.00 and 10.00 every day. It is highly recommended for hotel guests to listen to it. It is gentle, natural and cultural. He accompanied us to visit many times in the lobby. It is very, very His patience, and the temperament of manager Liu Hai also fully interpreted the high-end luxury feeling brought to me by J Hotel. It really feels like a "Downton Abbey" housekeeper. In addition, I would like to thank Chen Jiahao from the Yi Lounge on the 84th floor for making me a cocktail that suits my personal taste.

Staying in a hotel does not mean what you are going to eat or use, but the experience. The impression J Hotel leaves on you is that it is worth it.

msg:The hotel breakfast is really bad, the variety and taste of the ingredients are not good. So is the executive lounge. As a hotel with 5,000 plus per night, the soft service is really not good. I work until after 10 o'clock in the evening, and there is nothing to eat in the hotel delivery. I want to go to the swimming pool and gym to see the design, but they say that they are not allowed to use it due to the epidemic, and they are not allowed to see it. The welcome fruit arrangement and ingredients are really a bit perfunctory. The dishes were not cleaned. The hardware is OK, but the soft service is not good, and I will not buy the hotel where I stayed.

The biggest highlight is that the hotel arranges a special person to lead a tour of the hotel.

msg:What is it like to stay one night at the highest hotel in China? Entering the elevator room of the hotel will be very ceremonial, the original size of the Roman column is engraved, the small lotus flower waiting quietly, and the glazed door that makes you feel full of brilliance, the welcome in front of the housekeeper's door, the floor of the double-layer electric induction door The opening of the layer will gradually warm up the small satisfaction in your heart.
Check-in in the cloud on the 101st floor, you don‚Äôt have to stand at the front desk and wait. The butler will invite you to sit on the comfortable sofa and enjoy the view of the mountains and small mountains while checking in information. There will be a small free tea break while waiting. If you eat it, it is happy for children who love candy, because there are nearly ten kinds of small candies, as well as macarons of various flavors, and the water is San Pellegrino, Coca-Cola, Sprite, etc.
Entering the room, the crystal material that can be seen everywhere makes you feel that your room is like a light in the sky. The bathtub designed with lotus petals really impresses me. Wherever I go, it interprets the hotel's pride in countless details. The razor is a Gillette with a steel handle, the wooden comb in the children's set has an air cushion, and the children's toothbrush has a travel cover, full of details.
If you stay in this hotel, it's really worth staying here for a whole day, because the housekeeper will arrange a lot of projects for you, and visiting some of the works of art in this hotel is really a must-do, you will see golden samurai, and Behind him are the glazed red doors, each private room will have a different design, and the efforts of countless designers have been poured into it. You'll see enamel peacocks blooming in the sky, and you'll see the world's tallest sky restaurant. Do you think it's all over in a while? The feast has just begun
In the Yi Lounge, the butlers will assign rooms to everyone according to the number of guests, and enjoy free meals in a private environment, such as delicate pastries, delicious roast suckling pig, and tender beef that melts in your mouth. This is an all-you-can-eat meal. The buffet meal is really satisfying.
Do you think this is good enough? Actually it's not over. The next morning, I will take you and your child to visit the aerial Soviet-style garden and the Fu Museum, so that the child can see the works of many artists without leaving home, and let him find his own understanding in each abstract work.
The breakfast is semi-buffet, you can order any dishes you like, and the butler will deliver them to your side. The porridge and shrimp dumplings from the Big Love Buddha Jump over the Wall, each dish will please your eyes.

A truly wonderful hotel, truly world-class. Attention to detail, attractive night view, everything is perfect, recommended! !

1. From the start of the contract, the administrative staff will assist you in adjusting the arrival time, the child's bed iron, tooth brushing, etc. will be detailed.

From the reservation, a specialist (read as an administrator) arranged for us, and we took care of details such as check-in time, children's beds, toothbrushes, etc.

2. Move in from the 101st floor to the front of the elevator. Opened last year, Taishin finished! Other than that, I prefer a 5-star hotel room.

First, you can take a bird's eye view of Shanghai from the front desk on the 101st floor! The room is too clean, it opened last year, so it's really new! Better than other hotel president suites


3, Self-caused by many children, 2 rooms to choose from, Different style, From comb to bathroom, To room, No complaints

I have 4 children so I booked 2 rooms. Very beautiful, no complaints!

4. Dinner in the 120th floor, the feeling of dining in heaven! Suggested body test, sending family friends

Dinner is on the 120th floor! The night view is so beautiful! Recommended!

(3) For breakfast, please ask the waiter in the restaurant to get a tissue, and only give it after yelling five times, and there is no sense of apology at all!
(4) There are four restaurants in the hotel. I wanted to go and see and choose one to eat. I went to visit the four restaurants and saw that the waiters were there, but no one greeted the customers, let alone introduced them, and no one asked us what services we needed. , the waiter treats the customer as transparent!
(5) I went back to the room very late the next night and found that the bed was turned down, but I didn't give a toothbrush or skin care essence. I called the housekeeper in the middle of the night to deliver it.
(6) For breakfast, except for the waiter with the registration number to greet the guests and register, the waiters inside are very indifferent and will not greet customers.
A hotel of this price should not have such quality of service

It is the most satisfying time I have stayed in all hotels, and the price is moderate. , It's so worth the money, all the drinks are free, the food is fresh and high-end, the desserts are amazing, I checked into the room in the afternoon to take a shower, and then went out to find friends, when I came back in the evening, the room was cleaned and cleaned for me, and I used it The toiletry supplies helped me make up for it. This really moved me. I have never experienced this in other hotels. They also wrote me a small card and gave me chocolates. It was so heartwarming and every detail was handled The hotel is very good. The housekeepers are so enthusiastic. I really like this hotel. How can there be such a high-quality hotel in China? Who leads such a perfect team? Family coming again, highly recommended to everyone, perfect‚úå

msg:The hotel service needs to be more refined: the hotel will communicate your itinerary by phone one day in advance, and was told that the check-in time is 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Although it feels a little late, it still follows the time and arrives at the front desk at 3 o'clock. The front desk takes our ID card and lets us Wait by the side. Unexpectedly, after waiting for 40 minutes, no one came to inform the progress. I was too anxious to ask the front desk. I was told that the room was not cleaned, and we were a little irritated, saying that you can go down for the afternoon first. Tea. Good service is not just a smile on the face, a lot of service staff, but the work connection and efficiency are very general. As for the scenery, as in the first picture, due to the structure of the Shanghai Center, the hotel rooms cannot be directly close to the scenery (only the 101st and 120th floors are better for viewing the scenery, not the guest room area). The natural light in the room is relatively weak, and the view of the guest room is indeed A bit disappointed.
The overall experience can only be said to be ok, but compared to some luxury five-stars in Shanghai, J's price/performance ratio is not high.

msg:The following are fair comments and suggestions for the two days of staying in the hotel: First of all, it was amazing when I checked in on the first day. I was impressed by the enthusiasm of the service staff and the appearance of the bright lobby. Second, the overall sanitation environment of the hotel was clean and tidy. The floor is very high, but it is very convenient to go up and down the floor. Before people arrive at the elevator, there is a welcome person who presses the up and down buttons, and it is very convenient to enter and exit. However, the hotel's breakfast meals are few in variety, and the semi-self-service breakfast makes the service obviously a bit rushed. The noodles wait for a long time, and the meal has become a lump. It is recommended to change to the self-service type of the open file, which also allows customers to have a variety of choices. Secondly, deliver fruit to the guest room in the afternoon. It is recommended to open the door after ringing the doorbell to ask if you can enter, and then enter when you get an answer or confirm that no one is there, so as to avoid the embarrassment of women when they are dressing. Then there is the turndown service. I asked to help turn the turndown at around 6 pm, but I waited for an hour and a half, and urged me to call twice. In general, the details need to be paid attention to, the experience is not particularly perfect, and I have some regrets about this hotel in my heart. I hope the hotel can pay attention to these details, otherwise the gold and jade will be ruined! Thank you for your hard work during the National Day

msg:I personally think that the hotel is very good in terms of facilities, hygiene, environment, service, etc. except for only two shortcomings. The first disadvantage is that the bathroom glass in the room is transparent, that is, when you take a shower, you can go outside. You can see, this is not very convenient. The second is that you can see the outside scenery clearly during the day, but at night, the night scene cannot be seen clearly in the room. Because it is very dark, it may be due to the double glazing and sunscreen film. This is the most regrettable, but in other parts of the hotel, that is, the lobby, restaurant, bar, etc. can be clearly seen in these places, and overall it is very good!

msg:The price of the hotel is not low, and it feels far from expectations. The price of Chinese food on the 120th floor does not match the taste, and our service is acceptable. Other friends who eat the set meal feel that they have great opinions (the food is very slow). The service is acceptable, nothing special about the service at this price! The overall feeling of the front desk service is very general, but I am satisfied with the service of Miss Summer. I don't know why, but it's common to get good reviews. Except for the concept of high and famous, there are few memorable moments. Holidays are different from usual consumer prices, and the holiday is significantly higher. All in all, it is unlikely that you will visit again in the future.

Watching the sunrise from the room and watching the sunset on the 120th floor are the highlights, and the spectacle is truly unforgettable. The Chinese restaurant on the 103rd floor is also very good. The veal and suckling pig are roasted just right, crispy and crispy. The air-conditioning in the room is slightly insufficient, and the bathroom has floor heating. It is indeed magical to experience floor heating at a high temperature of 41 degrees outside. The breakfast is great, the seafood porridge is delicious and tender, the plate is exquisite and beautiful, and the taste is rich. An almost perfect experience brings a good mood for the day. I recommend everyone to have a chance to experience it!

msg:Because Shanghai children are not allowed to go out to Shanghai during the holidays, the whole family stayed at J Hotel on the Mid-Autumn Festival. We booked the Xiangyun King Room for parents, and we took the children to live in the Lingkong King Room. When we checked in on the 101st floor of the hotel, we tasted the snacks and drinks in the lounge and looked at the beautiful scenery. We felt that time passed quickly. We stayed on the 93rd and 95th floors with our parents respectively. One could watch the sunrise and the other could watch the sunset. Great, I also sent welcome fruits, Mid-Autumn snacks and warm greeting cards; the hotel hardware is very good, and there are a lot of crystal works of art, which are eye-catching; the breakfast is very delicate, and the butler service is very caring üëç Chris Wang took us to visit the hotel The multiple works of art and suite Show Room; it feels great! Check Out the next day, Chris Wang warmly helped us check out, saw our things, and took the initiative to help us put our luggage in the car. Knowing that my father likes mobile maps, he finally sent us a hotel very considerately. The map and cards are kept as souvenirs. My father is very happy, and my husband and mother also praise Xiao Wang's attentive service. Next time I have the opportunity to join J Hotel.

The breakfast the next day is also very rich in variety and tastes good! Hotel J, the representative of the image of the magic city, will come to experience it when there is a chance!

The bedding in the room is very comfortable, and I don't feel tired from traveling. Every employee is very friendly and will greet you when they see you and guide you where you want to go.

Not only does the Shanghai Tower have a tall appearance, but also the overall strength of Jin Jiang's team service. Very impressed with this experience.

We retirees were very moved. As soon as you enter the room, you will see the happy birthday a**osphere that has been arranged. Children born in the year of the Rabbit, the skilled hands tie the white towel into a lively rabbit head on the round towel cake, and erect a handwritten Happy Birthday greeting card with the beautiful, modern and lively scene arrangement, from the bottom of our hearts Laughed. Then the housekeeper Liangzi accompanied us to visit and explained the hotel. Through immersive seeing with our eyes, touching with our hands, listening with our ears, and tasting with our tongues, we can feel that everything in the hotel is so beautiful! Especially when you come to the unique 120-story Tianzhijin Restaurant, which is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. Take a bird's-eye view of the roofs of the buildings and enjoy the extraordinary cloud experience! Whether on the 101st floor or the 120th floor, they provide us with rich food and professional services, and at the same time, they can also receive special care. I would like to say thank you! On the second day, the hotel arranged a tea ceremony for the children. Let them touch, smell, soak, and taste all kinds of tea...

Environment: J is located on the highest floor in the center of Shanghai, the lobby lounge on the 101st floor, and Tianzhijin on the 120th floor are all very good viewing points in the hotel. In addition to Gao, the hotel also has a lot of artworks for guests to visit, and there is even an hour and a half h√¥tel your, led by a butler, which is very interesting. The decor is luxurious and understated, with a touch of taste.
Service: Remarkable, you can feel the well-trained service of the hotel staff from the garage. Although it takes 48 hours of nucleic acid plus on-site antigen to enter the hotel, the service process is very smooth and the attitude is very good. After arriving at the lobby, we received a very considerate service from the housekeeper Emily. She handled the whole check-in process, and we sat in the lounge and started to enjoy. All the service staff we met later were cordial and courteous. The lady in the lobby lounge was very friendly to the elderly and took the initiative to serve. Parents felt very good.
Our package includes happy hour and Tianzhijin cocktails. In terms of quality, the happy hour in the lounge is even better, the saltiness is delicious, and the wine is of good quality ü•≥
Just a little nitpicking, the room provided soft drinks and beer from the minibar. The beer is delicious, but there is only one bottle, which is not very good. It is more considerate to put an extra bottle üòÄ

The average service attitude is good, but the professionalism needs to be strengthened. For example, when the breakfast service staff provide services, and the impatience of the pool receptionist, it is obviously incompatible with the "butler-style" service advocated by the hotel.
Other than that, it's enjoyable most of the time. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel package first. I personally feel that the price is very high. From the time of check-in, we arrange proper meals and drinks almost every two hours, and there are many choices.

msg:Staycation choose J hotel close to home. The glass in the room is filmed, and the Chinese style will be darker. The best view is on the 120th floor for breakfast, and the lobby on the 101st floor has a good view.
Check-in experience: Entering the elevator nucleic acid + antigen from B3, the staff who came out of the elevator explained the necessity of the antigen very patiently, took the luggage and took us to the entrance, meticulous service, no need to queue for check in, the housekeeper will come to sit for you Location check, while watching the scenery and welcome tea break, the service satisfaction is given to the two young men who came out of the elevator from the basement and the little girl who took us to the basement garage when we checked out, very meticulous and thoughtful.
Dissatisfied is the guy named Ryan Wu in Hall 101, especially uncomfortable. Tell the three-year-old children to keep their voices quieter. There is a sense of oppression following us in the sightseeing platform area. The training is not in place, and the children are brought in during the summer vacation, and there is no business a**osphere. Many people in the lobby are very lively, and the children are excited when they see the scenery. One point is very normal. According to this level, it can only be a business trip, and parent-children are not recommended.

msg:Choose the J Hotel, located in Shanghai's landmark building, the world's second tallest center of Shanghai. In the early stage of the hotel's check-in, the housekeeper will confirm the room and communicate the needs of the residents. The lobby lounge on the 101st floor and the Tianzhijin on the 120th floor are very good viewing points of the hotel. When I arrived in the evening, I met the beautiful sunset, and I was in a good mood. The hotel also has many works of art for guests to visit. The decoration of the hotel is luxurious and low-key, and it is very tasteful. Anna at the front desk took the initiative to take us to visit some areas of the hotel, and sent them to the room to introduce the facilities in detail. From Anna's reception, you can feel that the hotel staff are well-trained, the service process is very smooth, and the attitude is very good. Our package includes happy hour and Tianzhijin cocktails, and the experience is very good.
       But a slightly scary incident happened on the second night: at one and four in the morning, I was woken up twice by the inexplicable doorbell, and the cat's eyes couldn't see anyone, so I called the night shift housekeeper at the front desk, and the housekeeper explained that it was an error in the intelligent program . After that, I arranged for the staff to close the doorbell program and tossed to 5 o'clock before falling asleep. The next day I found the housekeeper and manager Cheryl to complain. Cheryl listened to my opinions and appeals carefully, and did not evade or shirk the problems in the hotel, sincerely apologized and actively Give me a comfort plan that I can accept, and try to get the understanding of the guests. Through this episode, as a national brand in China's hotel industry, J Hotel Shanghai Center has improved its service awareness and level while occupying the optimal location and luxury hardware. I will choose to stay at J Hotel Shanghai Center again in the future.

In the early stage of the hotel's check-in, the housekeeper will confirm the room and communicate the needs of the residents. Knowing that it was the child's birthday, the hotel helped arrange the room in advance, which really made people feel at home. We were fortunate to meet Lance, the star butler, who not only took the initiative to show us the features of the hotel, but also explained the whole process carefully and meticulously. We also had to praise Lance's photography skills. The elderly, wives, and children were all satisfied! Additional small gifts, roses, small cakes and red wine will be given on the birthday. The hotel hardware, butler service, and the buffet breakfast that can be ordered and made on the 120th floor are all highlights. The only regret is that the hotel swimming pool is not open. I hope the epidemic will end soon and have the opportunity to stay again.

msg:Mid-June coincides with the first anniversary of Hotel J. For those of us who cannot leave Shanghai, July is the day when the water at home is cut off for a day. Bringing our family to the top of the magic city again is the beginning of this year's travel trip, enjoying the sunshine and delicious food. , let the parents feel the joy of taking their grandchildren and Chenghuan's knees. The store celebration activities are very attractive. In addition to a suite of 93-113 square meters for one night, there is also a Yunzhijin dinner for two adults. You can choose one between Chinese and Western styles. The room is free of alcoholic soft drinks. ; It also includes happyhour in the lobby bar (in fact, the lobby of 101 has drinks and snacks 24 hours a day, and children like the Nongfu Spring and chocolate cookies); there is a bottle of champagne, a large plate of fruit, preserved fruit, nuts in the room And the lotus and lotus leaf desserts, the macarons with the "J" logo, and the salty snacks, sit around and eat afternoon tea with the family, chat for a day, and watch the children run around carefree. , so that I have been on eighty-nine-day shifts for a complete relaxation.
This time, the housekeeper of the Yunshang Suite directly gave it to the 96th floor. The area of the room is nearly twice as large as last time. There is a guest bathroom when you enter the door, and there is a separate living room on the right side of the living room. The right side of the living room is square and can be closed. The cloakroom, the bathtub and the shower room in front, the master bathroom and the dressing table are very private in the innermost. On the other side is the bedroom.
Many people have always sneered at state-owned hotels, but I don't think so. It turned out that the West Lake Hotel in Hangzhou, which was not visited by the epidemic, has stayed at the J Hotel twice. I feel that the service is better than that of the foreign-funded hotel, and the service attitude is more pleasant and more humane. In fact, many times when staying in a hotel, apart from check-in and check-out, there is generally no interaction with the waiter. This trip to the suite on the cloud gave me a new understanding and new experience of J. It was a perfect "warm and soft" (temperature, softness) trip.
In terms of software: (1) Since we came directly from Hotel F to check out, we heard that there was another epidemic in the Guojin office when we were doing nucleic acid that day, so we canceled the Guojin lunch and arrived at less than 1 o'clock. I contacted the front desk of J in advance. Considering the baby's habit of taking naps, I asked if I could check in earlier, and confirmed that I could make it earlier, so that the baby who had dinner would not fall asleep and could enjoy the food while watching the top of the magic city with his mother. Sunset is a different experience. (2) During check-in, the lady butler provided half-squatting service throughout the whole process. Not only did they upgrade us to a suite with a view of the Pujiang River, we could see both sides of the Pujiang River directly; but when we saw a baby, he also gave a late check-out, so that the baby could have a nap Time, determined to go home, love children very much, too human. (3) I accidentally scalded my thumb when I scalded the baby's bowl at noon the next day. I used the beverage can in the refrigerator for cold compresses, and then I called the housekeeper because of the pain. The box is here. Ice compresses the wound and instructs me how to use the scald oin**ent. It's a heart-warming move. It's so caring. (4) Both breakfast and dinner were served at the 120th floor of Yunzhijin. The waiter had ironed the baby‚Äôs bowl in advance. Watch me wipe the baby chair with disinfectant wipes, and help me wipe the baby chair together. (5) For Tianzhijin‚Äôs dinner, according to the menu, choose the Chinese-style set meal of Shibaobao‚Äôs meal (including welcome snacks, such as one-three head plate, pigeon egg stewed fish maw, kumquat simmering snowflake beef, vegetable shrimp ball Yangchun noodles, Yangzhi Ganlu), the snowflake beef is very tender and delicious, the baby just eats the beef, it is so delicious, and the other staple food rice is not touched at all, and finally, using the brain and the noodle soup, actually eat a small half bowl meal. The anxious old mother was worried and hoped to dry up the bowl of rice, but there was no soup. So I asked the waiter if I could give another bowl of Chinese noodles soup, and let the baby eat the rice in the small bowl with one mouthful of rice and soup. After a while, a bowl of soup with ingredients and ingredients came up, and it was still delicious. The baby actually ate the whole bowl of rice. The old mother had an explanation. They also specially prepared a dessert for the baby, which is so loving. (6) The baby wanted to eat pasta at noon the next day, so the takeaway ordered pizza pasta, and the staff gave instructions on how to get the takeaway. I ordered cakes and yogurt at Jinweifang on the first floor. The housekeeper helped me deliver two large packages of food to the room, and she really felt alive. (7) Since the front desk is at 101, the staff will guide you no matter when you go upstairs to eat or go downstairs to go back to your room. For parents who are in their old age, even if they move separately, they will not lose their way.
Hardware: With the experience of staying for the first time, the facilities in the room (tea bar, refrigerator, how to adjust the water temperature) have been well understood. However, I am not alone with my baby this time, so I have time and opportunity to see a lot of details. (1) The glass cabinet has a safety protocol, and it has two layers of glass. Generally, unless there is a special bear child, it is generally impossible to touch the handicrafts inside. (2) The walls and drawers are covered with light apricot leather, which is warm. (3) Air conditioning, each place has a separate air conditioning temperature control, the bedroom is afraid of cold when sleeping, you can turn it up; the bathroom can be turned up when it is cold, and the temperature can be lowered when the baby is active; the living room also has its own temperature adjus**ent , it is very suitable to truly achieve one temperature in one room.
Hotel J also has a softer side. Last year, I stayed in Lingfang. I was particularly fond of the sunset on the 101st floor. I was fortunate to come this time. I saw the magnificent magic city on the 120th floor and 101st floor. The alarm clock before 5 in the morning is in the east of 120. Seeing the sunrise jumping out, and the "ji"-shaped mother river counting the bridges, and watching the little ants' cars on the busy street, both my baby and I were extremely happy. There are also hydrangeas and oncidiums in the room, which also slows down the holiday life all of a sudden. You can take a closer look and enjoy the quiet time.
Such a gentle and beautiful J Hotel, I believe we can meet her again and experience different beauty again and again.

msg:I stayed with a family of three during the Spring Festival. The house price was more than 1,000 higher than usual, which was 5380, but it was worth staying. The reasons are as follows: 1. Check-in is comfortable. Sitting on the sofa in the lobby on the 101st floor, someone will deliver tea and snacks, and then someone will be in charge of checking you in. You can just sit and watch the scenery. 2. The room is super big, and there are a lot of drinks in the room, and they are free. The bathroom is huge, the writing desk in the room is huge, and the sofa is huge. 3. There is no need to go to the top of Shanghai to queue up for viewing (the view of the top of Shanghai is on the 118th floor next to the hotel, adult tickets are 180, and the queue is long enough to go home. J Hotel has its own viewing platform, such as rooms, such as The 120th floor of the hotel, such as the 101st floor of the lobby, you can watch the scenery anytime, anywhere). 4. There is no need to go out for dinner anymore, the hotel provides free dinner at the Yi Lounge on the 84th floor (all families eat in separate boxes). 5. In the morning, you can go to the 120th floor to watch the sunrise, sit and watch, the sight is good, and there are few people. After watching the sunrise, I just went to have breakfast. The breakfast is rich and upscale. 6. It is convenient to go to Duoyun Bookstore. Go out of the hotel gate, and the No. 2 elevator next to it goes to the 52nd floor.

msg:Accompanying my wife to celebrate her 50th birthday at Hotel J. My wife is very happy and satisfied. I can't wait for me to praise the high-quality personal butler service team of Hotel J:
        Hotel J is worthy of being the ceiling of high-end hotels in Shanghai. From the first three days of our stay in the hotel, we felt the respect and service of the hotel's private butler team in every possible way. First of all, I would like to thank Alex Liu for taking the initiative to understand the individual needs of our hotel stay three days in advance. Knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, he enthusiastically said that he would set up a birthday a**osphere in the room, and at the same time inform us of the current epidemic prevention requirements, etc.;
        Next, I would like to thank Emily Pan. When we arrived at the lobby on the 101st floor of the hotel, he warmly received us, helped us check in, introduced the hotel's check-in courtesy to us in detail, and wished his wife a happy birthday in advanceüéÇ. Take us into the room, the room has been carefully decorated, there are happy birthday sets everywhere, on the coffee table in the living room, on the desk, on the big bed in the bedroom, and even on the boot screen of the TV, there are signed birthday wishes for my wife, and I gave a birthday cake üéÇ, very pleasant surprise. And the next afternoon when we checked out and left the hotel, she kept sending us to the underground garage to see us off, and I was very moved to see her waving goodbye to us in the rearview mirror.
        At the same time, I would also like to thank the personal housekeepers Tong Luping, Yang Wenkai, and Huang Xin from the housekeeping depar**ent. Thank you for your carefully crafted hand-painted birthday cards. It has been a long time since I received a hand-written birthday card. I am very happy.
        The unique scenery of the tallest hotel in China is very good. There is no doubt that let me, a Shanghainese, look at Shanghai from a different angle. In short, this is a very pleasant experience during the epidemic, and I will come to stay if I have the opportunity.

I like high-rise hotels very much. With the help of my wife, I stayed at the J Hotel in the center of the sea for one night. I have reserved the second tier of Ling Fang, with a Western-style layout, arranged on the 93rd floor, with a birthday theme thoughtfully arranged. 5K+ one night.
Expensive is really expensive, but the experience is not bad, the first is the software, the exclusive housekeeper will contact in advance, even if you are not there when you check in, you will receive WeChat throughout the whole process to help me arrange my needs. Every staff member in the store is also very enthusiastic, taking the initiative to care whether I need service or not, and is very caring. Since it is a new hotel in the second half of 2021, the hardware is also very new. There are crystals, faucets, door handles, and various decorations everywhere (special care, decorations are very expensive, be careful). There is a large bathtub by the window, and it is very comfortable to take a bath facing the invincible river view. They use Herm√®s toiletries, which are the same as the Zhujiajiao Anlu who lives in the old year. It seems to be the top match for a civilian hotel.
The room rate includes:
101st floor lobby courtesy - from ten in the morning to ten in the evening, sweets, snacks and soft drinks
Happy hour on the 101st floor - from 4th to 7th in the evening, in addition to the content of the courtesy, there are more snacks and drinks, similar to afternoon tea.
Cocktails on the 120th Floor - Sunset cocktails in the world's highest restaurant, two cocktails while enjoying the unrivaled sunset view.
There are also late check-out, birthday cake, fruit and so on, all of which are standard in mid-to-high-end hotels, and there will definitely be no shortage of them here.
The conclusion is that I spent 5K+, slept in the highest bed in my life, took the highest bath in my life, and drank the highest wine in my life. awesome!

All the staff are very enthusiastic, the butler service is great, thank you Annie and Xiao Cai and all the staff. On the first day, the buffet could not be dine-in, so the breakfast was pushed to the room, which was very rich and tasted great. It was very interesting to take us to visit the hotel, and the doll liked it very much. I personally think the macarons in the lobby bar are the best because they are not too sweet. The two dolls also got gifts, very happy, and my sister was very surprised. I didn't catch up with the tent for the parent-child package, so I brought one, and the tent I brought can also be set up, which is very interesting. The service is very satisfactory, thank all the staff, give full marks to all the staff of J Hotel.

msg:The J Hotel is located in the tallest building in China, the 632-meter Shanghai Tower. Check-in is on the 101st floor, the room is on the 96th floor of the Yunshang Suite, and the suite is 92 square meters. The room layout is very comfortable, very spacious and bright. Personal butler Harmon was also responsive to my requests and needs! Thank you so much for her service. I am particularly satisfied that the shower room is very large, the shower water flow is very strong, and the degree is just right! Everywhere in the room can feel the humanized thoughtfulness. There are three remote controls for the air conditioner, one in the living room, one in the room, and one in the bathroom. The bath will not be cold at all, which is very comfortable. There are also many hangers in the cloakroom, so don't worry about not being enough to hang clothes. Very satisfied with the stay experience!

msg:The countdown to the winter vacation, I accidentally saw Ctrip's push, five minutes to finalize the itinerary with my girlfriend, and take the baby for a luxury. After careful investigation, I learned that it is the first high-end hotel of Jinjiang Group. As a little girl in Shanghai, I have a complex relationship with Jinjiang. From the moment you checked in, you knew it would be a perfect trip. Butler service, responsive. The room full of design sense reflects the aura of the highest hotel. The 104-story Japanese dinner included in the package is full of ritual. The half-buffet and half-a la carte breakfast on the 101st floor is a combination of Chinese and Western styles. The children praised that all they eat are hot dishes, sausages and breads, etc. The early morning sunrise made the holiday a complete success. The thoughtful and warm service makes friends of all ages sigh, and it is worth the price. When you're looking for a room with a three-piece view, you should come and live in a three-piece.

msg:I really want to praise this hotel, I never post reviews, but this experience is so good that I still have to pass on the warmth I received in this epidemic environment.
Because it was the first time I stayed at the hotel and it was during the epidemic period, I called in advance to consult a lot of questions and then asked for some arrangements. The front desk housekeeper jenny of the hotel, and the floor housekeeper Attica, were very patient in answering and arranging my needs in advance. Very warm. warmth.
When I arrived at the hotel to check in, the front desk supervisor Zhang Wenxiang (I don't know if he was a supervisor but he was so professional that I think he should be a supervisor haha) from check in to check out for four days, even after leaving the hotel, he patiently and professionally helped me receive and send things. Things to arrange some trivial docking is really to give guests a home away from home experience. Experience upgrade +1.
I ordered the experience of dining in the Italian restaurant in the sky. After all, I am also a catering person. The food is really not in line with my Chinese appetite. But the service of the restaurant manager, penny, was YYDS again. He introduced each dish throughout the whole process, and if he didn't like it, he gave me another free side. After paying the bill, he also took the initiative to show me the detailed explanation of each floor of the entire hotel.
In a nutshell, I just wanted to see the design and take pictures, and the result was conquered by the overall service. Where did such a good employee come from~ Juejuzi!

msg:The internal environment is equipped with a five-star level, but people who are looking forward to the scenery should not report too much expectations, because the external design makes it impossible to view the scenery without obstacles. These can be tolerated, but the breakfast really makes me unable to complain, super. The breakfast in the five-star hotel is the simplest breakfast with the least choice and the most common taste I have eaten in recent years. I am a little disappointed, and it is very unfriendly to smokers. The hotel does not have a smoking room. Every time you smoke, you must go to the 101st floor to sit It's very tiring to go down the elevator. It's the first time you can go to live and see, after all, it is the highest in Shanghai.

msg:Celebrating the 8th wedding anniversary, the hotel is super considerate to upgrade the cloud suite. The location of the suite is very good, facing the Bund, and the Oriental Pearl is also in front of you. But when I go to J Hotel, it really depends on the weather. The anti-peep film is applied on the glass window of the room, which will make it darker. If the weather is bad, there is nothing to see. The room is large and comfortable, and the details are well done. I like the overall decoration style and color, and the bathroom supplies are Hermes. The shape of the bathtub is very special, and it is quite comfortable to take a bath. There is a small TV next to it, so it is not boring to take a bath. The price includes a 5-course Japanese dinner for two. The dinner is on the 104th floor, not a view seat, so there is basically nothing to see. The quality of dinner is not bad. There are steak rice and eel rice to choose from. Those with big appetite can only be half full. The breakfast the next day was a semi-buffet, and the menus for several set menus were ordered. Other fruits, self-pick up snacks, fritters are not good: hard and cold, breakfast is on the 101st floor, you can see the scenery, but it happened to be a little foggy that day.

The room attendant neatly arranged the charging cable of my mobile phone, tied it with the cable and arranged it neatly next to the desk plug. I have a sensitive nose and the room seems to smell a bit (the room is disinfected with ozone), I told LANCE and SAM about the situation. They communicated with the housekeeping depar**ent in time and installed an air purifier in my room , the hotel side asks the guests to achieve the most comfortable experience, thank you very much. This time, it was a great experience to dine at the 120th floor Tian Jin, which has the highest restaurant in the Guinness Book of Records!

The environment and facilities, bed and bedding, I really feel a little bit mean, I'm sorry for the price of more than 5,000... It feels like a slightly better business hotel moved to the center of Shanghai, and others feel that there is no quality at all. I see that many of them are full of praise, which only represents my personal evaluation, for your reference, I used to be Bulgari, I don't have this price, I won't choose here next time.

Since entering the hotel, there is a personal butler with you. In particular, Maggie, the deputy administrative butler, I like it very much. It is as comfortable as chatting at home together, breaking the traditional cultural etiquette of the hotel and greeting with a nod and smile, which makes people feel more intimacy. The room is huge, the hygiene details are impeccable, the breakfast is semi-self-service, refined and delicious at 0:00, drinking coffee while looking at the beautiful scenery outside the window is really satisfying.

msg:Name and praise Manager Qin Weizhang.

On my birthday this year, I stayed at Hotel J for the first time. For hardware, you can refer to other reviews. I would like to focus on the service experience of this birthday.

üîîService:
There is a welcome room downstairs, and the 101st floor is introduced for check-in. Because I called the hotel in advance and expressed my hope that the birthday room could be simply arranged, I did not expect to get the following little surprises.

1. The manager learned that the day was special, and took the initiative to upgrade the room type for us, facing the "wrench" directly to the south, and also found that two breakfasts were not included in the morning and later;

2. After the check-in procedure, the manager personally followed us to the room and gave a brief room tour. The basic facilities include Hermes toiletries, two packs of bath salts, Dyson hair dryer, free soft drinks and water in the mini bar, and the room The TV cabinet is a hidden lift type. After opening, there will be a simple welcome word with the name of the occupant on the screen;

3. The birthday arrangement is decorated with rose petals on the bed, and a bottle of red wine and a fruit plate are included, which are all unexpected, refills;

4. The most surprising thing is that when I returned to the room for dinner that night, I found that slippers had been placed beside the bed for us, and there was a small cake and a small box of chocolates on the coffee table. It was really surprising, moved and grateful. refill again;

5. The next morning, I went to swim in the hotel pool that I made an appoin**ent with in advance. I was the only one in the whole game. It was so comfortable. The coaching program of the trial operation-professional swimmer Eason also came to instruct me on the posture and key points of breaststroke. I really learned When I arrived, the lifeguards were also very interesting. I was very happy to see that my freestyle was not quite right.

6. After checking out, Manager Tan came to ask about the hotel experience and suggestions for the hotel, and finally gave a fragrance of the same flavor of the J Hotel, which was so thoughtful from beginning to end.

This year's birthday has become more perfect because of this stay. It's not advertising, but I think it's really worth it. I think I'll come again when there is a suitable opportunity in the future ‚ù§Ô∏è

Ps. Many hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello, even in the corridor, it is not exclusive to J, but just wants to give special praise, which will make guests feel very friendly.

Restaurant üç¥: The decoration of the various restaurants in the hotel is really high-end Chinese style, you can visit and take photosüì∑, very user-friendly, when you bought it, it included the set menu of a Japanese restaurant. , I can only say that I can give it a try. It feels a bit ordinary to pay for it. The decoration is okay and the privacy is very good. On the same day, other guests complained that the restaurant felt cheated and said it was kaiseki. The cooking is actually just ordinary Japanese foodüòÖüòÖ so we forget it, we are not happy to toss it~
üßπHygiene: The basic feeling is still very clean, but the carpet is still a little bit lint, maybe because of the black floor tiles, I feel that there are always a lot of hairs. It is suggested that the map can be changed to a better style.

üîîService: The hotel is equipped with a personal butler after check-in, which is very convenient. The butler is super good. My husband praises it in various ways and meets various needs~~
But~~~~~The service of the breakfast restaurant is really annoying üò°I feel like a lot of people complained that dayüòÇüòÇüòÇ The guests who stayed at the hotel didn‚Äôt have a seat to eat breakfast, but there were still many guests in the restaurant who just bought a breakfast for the sake of taking pictures. , there are still a lot of tables, it's really annoying, there is no one reception at the door, I searched around and found no one, I asked the food delivery person and didn't know where to go, and then waited for a long time for people to come and then ran to find a seatüòÇüòÇ training There is really a problem. I have stayed in a lot of luxury hotels and have never encountered such a situation. I know that there are so many guests booking rooms, so I should make arrangements in advance. When there are too many people, there is no direction. The cleaning üòÇüòÇ is really a bad experience, the food taste is ok, the delivery speed is also a long time after calling for coffee üò°, and there is bread but no butter üòî It feels a bit strange~
PS: It is recommended that there must be 2 receptionists at the door regardless of how many people are there, one is responsible for finding a location, and the other is responsible for receiving and recording.
Other aspects are good. There is a free snack bar in the lobby. The children like it very much. Check in and check out and rest there. The service is very good~The chocolate is also delicious~
The most beautiful decoration. I like the lounge on the 84th floor. It is very beautiful. Each room has an open box for guests. It is very beautiful. ÔΩûIt is highly recommendedÔΩû

üöó Transportation: B3 parking is free and super convenient ~

At 10:00 am and 4:00 pm on the first floor, we are accompanied by staff to visit all the restaurants of J Hotel. It is highly recommended and worth seeing. There are many works of artists in the restaurant.
All the staff will greet each other kindly when they meet, and the butler will provide one-to-one service throughout the whole process. Special thanks to the butlers Angel and Owen. The phone needs are met one by one, and the service response is super fast.
Evian mineral water is also provided in the room, and soft drinks in the snack bar are free. It's worth a visit.

Outside the guest room on the 96th floor, you can vaguely touch the two balls of the Oriental Pearl, especially the thick blanket. Neither hard nor soft will be fine, a good night's sleep. At 6:45, I climbed up and down the table to create, and my inspiration was flowing (this is the most memorable part). Breakfast is 380 per person, and an additional purchase of one person finally gets a gentle and free order. 8 coupons for parking are exactly 120 yuan. The hotel tour from 10:00 to 10:30 is very typical. The Jinyan Chinese Restaurant on the 103rd floor and the Tianzhijin Restaurant on the 120th floor are 560 meters high, overlooking both sides of the Pujiang River; and the 30-meter-long Italian mosaic Silk Road mural at the elevator entrance Very attractive. ...in short, an unforgettable stay experience!

Now is the era of paying attention to quality service experience. Take this time as an example, we also wanted our 80-year-old parents to experience the pride of the second tallest building in the world. We chose Hotel J. After checking in, we went to the floor where we were staying. We met John, the supervisor, who was enthusiastic in the aisle. The overflowing greeting instantly made us feel like home. He kept ushering us into room 8709, and introduced us in detail how the facilities in the room were operated before leaving. After a while, we heard a knock on the door, only to see that he took it again. The anti-slip mat came in and placed it in the bathroom. At the same time, he explained that seeing his parents are old, they are afraid that they will fall easily when taking a bath. A larger anti-slip area can be safer. From his warm smile and affectionate words, we feel that Family-like warmth. The housekeeper maha has brought double fruit and cake for the parents. I also hurriedly left the hotel after arranging for the elderly due to work. When I checked out, I heard from the old man that in the morning John and another girl (Sarah Yang) heard that the old man had missed visiting the hotel because of the New Year's Eve dinner, and immediately took time to accompany the old people to visit and take pictures around the hotel...

First of all, let‚Äôs talk about service. There is a dedicated person responsible for every aspect of check-in. From the introduction after taking the guest into the room, every part is clear. In addition, the service in every aspect is excellent.
Secondly, let‚Äôs talk about the environment. There is nothing to say about the internal environment, but because of its central location in Shanghai, the three-piece suit and the Bund are not from the same perspective.
I ordered Jinshang Tianshe for dinner, which is about the same price. The ingredients here are much better than those of many Internet celebrity omakase outside. I think the various tofu are delicious even if you don‚Äôt eat tofu. Although the Spanish ham and oysters included in the Chris**as set meal are indeed relatively ordinary, the other dishes and services more than make up for it.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. Although there are not many varieties, the products are good for hotels of the same level.
Well, overall Chris**as night is a bit rushed. You can come again next time when you have time.

The original room had a city view. After we made a request, we quickly helped to change it , in the face of the Oriental Pearl, and introduced the various facilities of the hotel one by one, and also helped to book restaurants, giving people a feeling of being at home

msg:Second visit to J Hotel. The lobby bar on the 101st floor has an unparalleled view. Breakfast is located on the 101st floor. It is semi-buffet style and has much more varieties than Chris**as. Chinese breakfast fried dough sticks with soy milk, noodles with scallion oil, porridge and side dishes with fermented bean curd, steamed pastries and other foods can fully satisfy the taste buds of all Chinese people. The European style breakfast is exquisite and complete, and the service is comprehensive and in place. The guest rooms are located on the 88th to 93rd floors. Each room has a unique landscape. The interior design and equipment and supplies exceed five-star standards. Crystal, colored glass, and leather are the main indoor elements. There are restaurants above the 101st floor, with Chinese, Western and Japanese respectively occupying one floor. The Chinese Jinyan, the 120th floor Tianzhijin, and the Japanese Jinshang Tianya are all well-deserved, and you can only truly appreciate them if you visit them in person. The cocktail hour at Yi Lounge on the 84th floor is very popular among children. Hotel J is more like an artistic journey.

msg:Holidays, 5880 expensive, Baizuan Hotel. Real reviews.
The advantages, service, and environment are the best I have ever experienced in a hotel. Take a bird's eye view of Shanghai. The service steward is basically responsive, and each link has a very good service support. These two points must be full marks.
Facilities, there is no open swimming pool and gym. It is said that it is a water pressure problem. It is an excuse. The swimming pool is not open. The gym can be opened. The Park Diamond Hotel cannot be without these facilities, or it should wait for the facilities to be completed before opening the shop. Only 4 points.
Hygiene, for the Baizuan Hotel, it is very general, the room layout is very beautiful, the photo show is good, but the dust on the floor, the large stains on the carpet, we booked two rooms, the carpet is not clean, just imagine, How long has it been in business? What will your health look like ten years from now? Hope to pay attention. After all, it is not a general five-star hotel, but a Shanghai brand. 3 points for hygiene.
All rooms are double-glazed. In fact, except for the lobby on the 101st floor, the room‚Äôs vision is average and the ventilation is relatively average, making it a bit stuffy. If there is a virus invading, it is estimated that it will be difficult to get rid of it.
For breakfast, there are not too many varieties. There are only three kinds of juice, a la carte and buffet. The taste is not amazing.
Parking is a pit, 120 per night, if you want to leave in the middle, you have to charge again.
The Jin restaurant on the 120th floor is very beautiful and luxurious, with an average of about 2,000 per person.
Overall, it is worth experiencing once, and it is estimated that there will be very few repeat customers. The details are not perfect.

Jin Jiang Group is really willing to spend money, and the most top brands in the hotel industry are gathered in the room. The bed and sofa are very soft and comfortable. TOTO smart toilet is very easy to use. I always use Yiyun water to turn the bed down. The room has a strong sense of science and technology, and is controlled by ipa throughout the entire process, which is stylish and advanced and easy to use. Highly recommended cloud hotel! Don't step on thunder. Finally, I would like to thank the front desk brother Sam Song Song Mingxi for his meticulous and thoughtful butler-like service during my stay. I am very touched!

msg:The service does not live up to the value of the hotel. From getting off the car to entering the guest room, we are accompanied by a waiter to guide us. The guest service manager Li Ji gave us very enthusiastic help. Other staff members we met can all smile and say hello. Sometimes Also proactively provide services, but the introduction of room facilities is a bit sloppy. The interior decoration of the hotel is luxurious, splendid, and elegant, or there are magnificent or interesting artworks. Looking out the window, you will have a panoramic view of the Bund and Lujiazui Financial Center. Those who like to take pictures should be satisfied. The decoration of each restaurant in the hotel is very style and pleasing to the eye. The Kamshang Tianshe Japanese Restaurant on the 104th floor has the best service. The Italian restaurant on the 101st floor has two western desserts for the buffet breakfast. The Chinese dim sum is not good enough. The 120th floor is currently the world‚Äôs highest view restaurant, Tianzhijin. The braised pork is good, but it is seated. It's a bit of a point for the former waiter not to pull the chair away. The privacy and service of the Yi Lounge on the 84th floor are very good. Mushroom soup, salmon and small desserts are good. The wine is also good. Macarons are a bit sticky. In general, although there are minor flaws, the entire check-in experience is very good.

msg:Checking in the long-awaited hotel, in order to celebrate his birthday, my husband specially arranged early and came with full of joy.

The location of the hotel is very good, you can overlook the Oriental Pearl Tower and other buildings. The view in the room during the day will be better than that at night, because the room is double-glazed.

When checking in, there will be a counter staff on the first floor to the 101st floor to check in. After the check-in is completed, there will be a room led by someone who will briefly introduce the room facilities, fixed at 11 o'clock and 16 o'clock every day, and there will be a floor guide of the hotel. The hotel‚Äôs artwork and restaurant presentation.

In this stay, the attitude of the staff and service was okay, especially the people who introduced the art of the hotel, really smiled and made you feel good.

I felt that there were a few places during my stay, but I was not very satisfied. After all, the price is not cheap, and my expectations will be very high.

The first point is to celebrate the birthday. I checked with the hotel by phone the day before check-in, and the hotel said that it would arrange for small cakes. As a result, when I checked in, I felt that the phone remarks the previous day did not seem to be successful. The front desk said that it would be arranged to be delivered to the room in the evening, but it was not delivered at 8pm. We only arranged it after we contacted by phone.

The second point, when introducing the room, it was said that someone would come to the room to handle slippers at 6 o‚Äôclock, but we didn‚Äôt have to wait until 6:30, and then we took care of it ourselves (Of course it doesn‚Äôt matter if we take the slippers ourselves, but the hotel people said someone would come at 6 o‚Äôclock. Processing, so we just wait for someone to come)

The third point is that the fruits that should be in the room did not appear. We only arranged for someone to bring them after we consulted on the phone.

Fourth, on the shelf outside the bathroom, there is a used shower cap box that has not been taken away (this feels like a problem that shouldn‚Äôt have occurred)

Fifth, when the hotel did not check in, it said that pillows could be chosen, which caused us to sleep poorly.

These are the places where I had high expectations for this hotel but failed. The scenery of the hotel is really beautiful and nice, but in some places it is still not in place.

As a hotel owner, I always judge Jinjiang Management with a small heart, but after experiencing the J Hotel through the entity , Sincerely have a deep understanding of the hotel‚Äôs soft culture and butler-style service management concepts. The waiters‚Äô eyes, manners, language, demeanor, handling affairs, etc., are relaxed and relaxed. Each waiter is a beautiful scenery. , To achieve the comfortable and warm a**osphere of flowing blood in luxury hotels. In the end, the hard cultural environment has its own advantages in luxury hotels. Now the competition is soft cultural service. Service is not humble, not accommodating, and high-level service is always intimate, suggestion, and yes. Caring, connotation, and moving, J Hotel has done it, Jinjiang Management has done it, it is worthy of being the window of Shanghai's landmark luxury cultural hotel.
      I won‚Äôt comment on the hardware cultural elements here. It is simply a ballet piece of beauty and art. It is amazing and aftertaste everywhere. Even a small paper clip makes you feel luxurious.
   Finally, I would like to give a special praise to the excellent service of the housekeeper, Ms. Gelato. I have gained a lot, and there will be a period of time later.

However, the check-in was very smooth and there was no problem. The breakfast at the hotel was a bit single. The Chinese-style steamed buns were not hand-made when they were eaten. The happy hour at the bar after 4pm is not bad, and the wine and snacks are of good quality. The room is neat and tidy.

Ctrip made a reservation very quickly. The reservation was successful, but until the check-in, there was no so-called housekeeper or hotel who called to confirm, but I think this is not a problem. I live in Shanghai, so it is very convenient to come here. It is very easy to find. I remind you that the parking fee here is 120 yuan/day. The concierge at the entrance of the hotel is very enthusiastic, and the tall and big guy is very cheering for the top of China, the center of Shanghai! The lobby is not too magnificent and you need to turn the elevator in the middle, but the whole line is still very smooth. There are service staff to guide you at any time and it will not make people feel that you can‚Äôt find the direction at once. The check-in attitude is very good, and the speed is quite fast. To be honest, to be honest, it‚Äôs not very hard. The currency that is found on the streets like cakes, biscuits and candies has no characteristics. The hotel room is still good, but the relationship between the double glazing is not very clear in Pudong, the toiletries are from Herm√®s, and the free drink is Evian mineral water. Non-alcoholic beverages in the small refrigerator are free. It is recommended to go to the afternoon tea on the 119th floor. The service fee of 1680 for two persons (excluding 15% service charge) can be reduced or waived for activities recently. You can also go to happyhour at night. The night view is really beautiful! The overall feeling is that the location is excellent. The hotel on the top of China is its own national brand. Emotionally proud, but the problem is also very prominent. Especially in the hotel‚Äôs own catering, breakfast and happyhour‚Äôs food are very general, and the steaming point of Chinese breakfast The dough is sticky, and the level of the typhoon shelter is not as good as...The things in happy hour are also a bit incomprehensible. At this point, I really lose a lot of points. In terms of breakfast and lounge meals, I personally feel that Peninsula, Bulgari , Baolijia are good, the gym and swimming pool have not been opened yet. It is said that it will be at least the end of the year. It is recommended to consult the hotel in advance! The pillows in the hotel are very comfortable and are sold. Unfortunately, because of the epidemic situation, the purchase was not successful. When I checked out, I gave the room card as a souvenir. I regret that I did not ask the guests how they felt during the stay! Looking forward to feeling better next time!

The big red, which is difficult to control, presents a thriving high-end Chinese üá®üá≥ red under the clever hands of the designer. Entering the door, a walker sits and watches the clouds rising from the stainless steel statue, expressing the detached mood of obedience to nature, calm and leisure, and also reflects the open-minded and positive life philosophy! Jinyan has eight boxes with different styles. What I ordered is that the ceiling has countless crystals and peace pigeons (Yongshan Hall). It specializes in exquisite Cantonese cuisine. The set meal of 2288 yuan per capita Chinese beef gift box, crispy mushroom-scented suckling pig, three green onions and fried dragon are delicious and delicious. It is worth visiting the world's highest Chinese restaurant!
The service of J Hotel is as good as always. The Australian boy Xie Qilong in the lobby is polite and polite. His fluent Mandarin reflects his high professional quality. What moved me in particular was that although Owen Butler and Jack Butler were on vacation, they helped me solve many problems through WeChat, and they also enthusiastically recommended Liszt Butler to serve me. J Hotel not only has tall hardware facilities, but also such a group of warm, caring and professional high-quality talents. The magic capital of the hotel will surely stand out and stand on the top of Shanghaiüëç

I saw that the front desk of the World Financial Center specially arranged for the housekeeper Wang Kai (sound) to lead a group of people into the guest room and introduced the functions and usage as needed. From the first floor of the hotel at 16:00, the younger brother Yisen introduced the hotel to the guests.

I suddenly thought about something special, so I chose the J Hotel Shanghai Center, the highest guest room in the country, which was just opened for half a year.

The gold wire decoration behind the bed is two pieces of glass embedded with metal wires instead of golden fabric. The floor is made of polymer materials for waterproof and fireproofing. In the course of use, it was found that the floor of the shower room would become more non-slip after being dipped in water, and the bed was very comfortable. Therefore, the top of the cloud is not only the location, but also the top quality.

msg:Staying at J Hotel, I am holding a look at the mentality. For hotels, I prefer quiet hotels with balconies and views. Because I saw that the hotel was opened in 21 years, I booked it with the mindset of having a look. After staying in, this state-owned enterprise managed hotel completely exceeded my expectations. For hotels, I always believe that high-end foreign chain management teams can do a good job in hotel services and design. This high-end hotel managed by the state-owned Jinjiang Group refreshed my understanding. I think that the hotel‚Äôs twice a day introduction is the most worthy of promotion and reservation, otherwise we have no idea about such a luxurious hotel, where is it expensive? What is the inspiration for its design? Where is the highlight? I would like to give a serious praise to Yao Tianlei, the interpreter this morning. He explained every detail with great care and answered every question. Because I like to look at the design, he patiently spent an hour and 20 minutes today, showing us around and explaining, and even telling us the angle of the photo. Although the hotel still has some areas to be improved, for example, the gym SPA has not yet opened, but it does not affect my evaluation of it at all.

msg:Since the opening of J Hotel, I have been paying attention to it for a long time, and online reviews are also varied. This time I will experience it for myself and share some small details with everyone.
The first is parking. Since Shanghai Center also has commercial and office floors, parking fees need to be paid for by yourself. However, the hotel is still working hard to negotiate with Shanghai Center, hoping that there will be some preferential policies in the future, but it will not affect the experience of staying.
After coming up from the parking lot, there will be inspections related to epidemic prevention and safety, and then a hotel butler will come to greet and guide the guests to the 101st floor front desk. During this process, your reservation information has been fully grasped, so you don‚Äôt need to stand at the front desk and wait. The butler will continue to guide you to the lobby lounge to sit and provide some drinks, and then the front desk staff will come to you to confirm the details and tell you some special information, for example, the room card can be kept as a souvenir to take home, and the suite is colored Yes, the others are gray. In addition, the hotel also provides a tour service. There are about two sessions a day, starting from the ground floor and continuing to the 120th floor, including design concepts, room type introductions, restaurant introductions, etc. This immersive experience makes people feel more immersive and fresh.
This stay is very fortunate to be upgraded from a volley bed room to a suite. The overall layout is still very warm. Various smart devices can reflect the high-end of the hotel. In addition, the bath product is Hermes. The view is relatively ordinary, so there is no need to entangle which room type has a good view. If you want to take pictures, you can go to the lobby on the 101st floor and the 120th floor, where the view is excellent.
There are also some small details. You can also get some hand-painted postcards, hand-painted fruit introductions, hand-painted food introductions, hand-painted Shanghai maps, etc. The butler will provide you with the services you need 24 hours a day online.
The hotel has a wealth of food and beverages. This dinner is at Tianzhijin. You can experience Chinese and Western dishes at the same time. This mode is more interesting. Chinese and Western dishes are contending. It is a bit expensive but worth a try. Jinjiang members can also get discounts! Breakfast is semi-buffet style, cold dishes and some hot food are buffet style, and noodles, steamed dishes, and eggs are a la carte style. I appreciate this very much. It can avoid problems such as queuing, wrong picking, missed orders, and crowds. Concentrated and crowded.
All in all, this experience reflects the new definition and understanding of Jinjiang old-brand hotels for high-end brands. It does not lose to foreign hotel groups and looks forward to the follow-up of Jinjiang's other high-end brands.

msg:The Double Ninth Festival stayed at the highest hotel for one night and was full of ceremonies. The front desk of the Xiangyun room hotel was upgraded to a Lingyun room. The western-style room is especially suitable for girls because it has a separate dressing table and bright makeup mirror. If you are a middle-aged couple staying, it is recommended to choose Chinese style, because Chinese style is more warm and romantic, and the Chinese style bathroom is opaque. The collision of too many Western-style glass and metal feels a bit cold, and lacks a sense of warmth, a bit like Warehouse No. 3, which is slightly cheap. The breakfast should be a big praise, the variety is rich, the order is unlimited, and the restaurant has a great view. Let‚Äôs talk about the service. I‚Äôm really satisfied with the hotel‚Äôs service. From the ba*****t, we have a dedicated waiter to lead the service. The service is 360-degree intimate. There are macarons, chocolates, various nuts, sweets and beverages in the lobby. All can be enjoyed for free, which is really great. You can invite friends to the lobby bar on the 101st floor to talk about things and enjoy beautiful food for free. There is also a visit to the hotel twice a day. I highly recommend friends who are free to visit. The private room of the restaurant upstairs is designed by Meilun Meihuan. Room service is also super in place, all the free drinks in the refrigerator can be enjoyed for free, and the water is Evian mineral water. All in all, it is worth checking in this highest hotel, I think this hotel is the best service among the 5-star hotels I have stayed in!

Upon request of the guests, I asked for cheese at the 101st floor Italian restaurant as a gift for the opening. It was a pleasant surprise! Worthy of praise!
2. The hotel specially organizes guests to visit and introduce various room types, restaurants and public spaces of the hotel at 5 o'clock every afternoon. It is worthy of praise!
3. The hotel is super high and has a wide view. Only the three public floors of 84, 101, 120 from the introduction have no double-glazed curtain walls. The line of sight is not blocked, and the other floors are just normal. Originally there was a double-glazed curtain wall, and the recent temperature was comfortable. I did not expect that the air conditioner would be activated frequently at night when I went to bed, and the noise would be relatively loud, which would affect my rest.

msg:For hotels with a state-owned enterprise background, inves**ent in hardware is not bad. The location is excellent, the selling point is outstanding, and the decoration is also luxurious. Internal strength needs to be strengthened, and the temperament of a luxury hotel is from the inside out. The price is a lot higher than the surrounding high-rise hotels, I hope all aspects are more than a lot. To be a real top hotel in Shanghai. It is not enough if there is only one building high and a good view. The Park Hyatt on the opposite side can also live up to the 80th floor, and the price is only half. It‚Äôs only one hundred and eighteen to see the scenery on the top floor of the Shanghai Center. Your highest is only one hundred and twenty floors. There are many high-rises that are not yours. There are also other cheap afternoon teas above the one hundred and twenty floors. The high-priced afternoon tea at Tianzhijin on the 120th floor of the hotel faces challenges, and the hotel‚Äôs restaurant is also open, so in-house guests sometimes can‚Äôt order it. The breakfast is crowded. It may be due to the National Day.

msg:Regardless of the environment, facilities, and services, they are all too good to say. The surrounding area is very convenient for eating, shopping and transportation. The breakfast is rich in patterns and tastes very good. Participated in the hotel visit at 10 o'clock in the morning, from the 1st floor to the 120th floor, Miss Venchi explained the design concept of each landscape and some details that were not noticed in detail. To make a small suggestion, the interface of the TV in the room is hidden in a drawer. I opened it and touched it with my hand. It was quite hot, and I felt that I could consider cooling it.

msg:The hotel does not have a separate basement and needs to pay 120 yuan per night for parking
There is no temporary storage box for take-out, which needs to be handed over to the delivery staff in person
After arriving on the first floor of the basement, there is a concierge reception. Seeing that we have a lot of luggage, the service is very good to help pick up the luggage and send it to the front desk on the 101st floor. But the check-in at the front desk is Sam Song. The certificate was given to him, but he couldn‚Äôt raise his head with one hand. The colleague in the concierge depar**ent had to return to the post on the first floor to remind sam song to help us deliver the luggage to the room. Very rude!
The supplies in the room are relatively uninteresting, and the temperament of the newly demolished house has not kept up. The scenery can be basically ignored under the double-glazed blessing. It can only be seen during the day when the sky is clear. The room is more than 400 meters high in the environment of domestic skyscrapers. Not surprising, one night‚Äôs experience is enough. After all, domestic upstarts are worthy of support. I hope that the sense of service will be strengthened!

msg:In general, the actual situation of the hotel, I'm sorry for this world's highest hotel, this price, Ctrip's highest star standard.
       The first and most important point is that if you want to go to the j hotel to see the scenery, please prepare yourself mentally, it will be much worse than what you expected. Shanghai Center is designed with double-layer glass, so there is a layer of glass outside the glass of the hotel, so there will be some blocking of sight, and at night the glass will adjust the visibility, only 30% is left, so basically you can't see much of the night scene. For such a high-rise hotel, it is definitely a failure among failures, and it can be said that it is a complete failure. See Figure for details.
       In terms of hygiene and environment, it is still good. The decoration is elegant and classical in marble. Also, because it has not been opened for a long time, there are not many hygiene problems.
       The service is also good, but not at the level that Wanda Ruihua can give full marks. By the way, the service attitude of the guy (it seems to be a little brother from Xinjiang) is still very good.
       Finally, about the facilities, the reason I only give one point. Of course, only one point is not to say that it can't even match the whole season's home, but only one point at this price and level. First of all, his view of the scenery will be blocked, which is a flaw, especially the night scene. Of course, this is the design of the whole building and there is no way. Then there are the small details. In my experiments, I found that its sink is not made of marble or ceramics. At least the area below the water outlet of the faucet is the most common, plastic part. I don't understand why it is so small. saving? (Friends who want to experiment can listen to the sound when the water is released); the most speechless is their napkins. This is the first time I have seen paper towels in this way, even the Express Hotel is better than them, just look at the picture; the last is the swimming pool , gym and other entertainment facilities are not open, because of the epidemic, why are Park Hyatt and Jin Mao open, but you have problems? Then why can the bar be opened again? In the final analysis, it is because it is not profitable to open it, and it is necessary to support it and lose money. In turn, look at what hotel group Park Hyatt is, and then look at J Hotel, oh, it is Jin Jiang Group, that is also No wonder, it is also because of the state's support that this good location is given to Jinjiang as a hotel. Oh yes, and his slippers, which are very poor. Although many high-end hotels are like this, I think everyone can learn from Park Hyatt. His sponge slippers are really comfortable (friends who want them can come to me privately).
       Okay, that's it, it's all honest, real pictures, although a little disappointing, but overall it's okay (don't take the price factor into account), and I'm here for my birthday.

msg:The room is very big, but there is basically no night view in the room. The double-layer glass blocks the sight, and it faces the other direction of the river bank. During the day, the river view is not bad, and it does have the feeling of "on the clouds". The night view is still there. Look at the lobby on the 101st floor.
The service staff are still quite enthusiastic. Finally, I met a five-star hotel where all the service staff would greet the guests with a smile. The housekeeper Wang Kai was also very capable and thoughtful.
Talk about not enough. First of all, the toiletries are really not good. For such a high-quality hotel, the suites are four or five thousand one nights. It is said that the suites of the next higher level use Hermes, so the other rooms are not Hermes, so use other brands? You can even use L'Occitane! The hair dryer is an imitation of Dyson's Xiaomi Youpin... I can't complain, I really don't need to save such a little cost, and the look and feel is much worse.
Seeing that we have children, we took the initiative to send an extra pair of slippers to tell the children that they are big, and the waiter said that they would send women's slippers directly. As a result, all adult slippers are completely the same! The color and size are the same, how to distinguish three people's slippers? I went out to eat and came back. The room was cleaned and a small snack was given. This is very good, but the slippers are really indistinguishable...
The most annoying thing is the breakfast. Arguably the worst of all the luxury hotels I've stayed in! I used to live in the Waldorf Astoria on the Bund and thought it was bad, but I didn't expect the J hotel to be even worse. The problems of the two companies are similar, and the main categories are very, very few. Waldorf Astoria mainly has a problem that does not suit Chinese tastes, and J has no choice at all. The restaurant itself is small, and it is arranged in the corner of the lobby bar, where many things are served, but there is no waiter to take care of the corner, which makes the process of eating very slow. If you want to drink porridge, there is only white porridge. , I went to eat more than nine o'clock, and the children were not full by 10:30. They were very unhappy. If I knew this was the case, I might as well go downstairs to have a Starbucks breakfast.
Finally, there is the problem of the Shanghai Tower itself. It takes three elevators to buy a coffee and a convenience store on the bottom floor. When I get out of the elevator, I actually see a little bit of chicken with a fellow... The floor tiles seem to have been used for decades, which is really low. I thought it would be the same quality and inves**ent attraction as IFC. Of course, this is not the problem of the hotel. The lobby passage on the first floor of the hotel is already quite artistic.
When leaving the store to take a taxi, a little brother took the initiative to ask and help locate the car to make sure that the car could drive to the correct location, which is very good and worthy of praise.
In short the overall lower than expected, especially the breakfast, hope to improve.

msg:J Hotel Shanghai Center:
Hello!
After the car arrived at the hotel, a hotel staff immediately helped with the luggage. Although the guy wore a mask, he was in good condition.
The hotel screen-printed logo on the revolving door was scratched, and the Chinese font size of the prohibition symbol in the elevator was not uniform. I am sorry for my obsessive-compulsive disorder.
After entering the door, a cute lady helped push the luggage to the 101st floor to check in.
Before leaving at noon, I called the hotel front desk. Since we would arrive at the hotel at 4 o'clock, I wanted to inform the hotel in advance at noon that I wanted a room with a higher floor and better sight. The switchboard told me that "our normal check-in is at 3 pm. You can come directly to the hotel at 4 o'clock to choose." After repeating the request, they said to help me add a note, but I did not see the note information when I checked in.
We checked in at the front desk. We should arrive at the hotel at 4 o'clock, but the fastest room to be checked out would take 20 minutes. We asked if we could choose a higher floor. After asking, we expected to wait for 1 hour, but the service attitude of the check-in guy was ok. Because we were waiting for the room, we sent breakfast for two and explained that the hotel room was large and had many glass products inside, so it would take more time to clean. (Indeed, after entering the room, we found a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãglass and stainless steel, and it really took a lot of time to clean the room.) But we asked that the normal check-out time of the hotel was 12 o'clock, and the room was checked out at 4 to 5 o'clock, so the cleaning time was not too long... When waiting for the room in the lobby bar, tea, soft candy, nuts and snacks were provided, but the rest area in the lobby bar felt too cramped.
After the front desk guy sent us to the room, the view of the room was not very ok, but he also helped us to introduce the facilities in the room in detail, and said that he would arrange for a colleague to help send a bottle of red wine in the evening. The guy's breakfast and red wine did make up for the psychological obsession with the relatively positive river view.
I found that the hotel staff's clothing was well thought out. The three-piece suits of the reception lady and the front desk guy were of good texture.
The decoration of the guest room was good, and some details were well done. All sanitary ware were custom-made, with the logo of J Hotel, and the design was thoughtful. (The design increased the maintenance cost of the hotel management company.) But the door of the shower room was too tight and needed to be opened with force. The handle was made of glass, which was easy to slip with water on the hands. Girls should pay attention to their nails. The room equipment and supplies were basically what a hotel of this level should have.
When I went out for dinner and changed the elevator, a foreign manager who could speak Chinese added a lot of points to the hotel's service (I met him at breakfast and asked the waiter to find out that he was the director of the catering department).
When I returned to the hotel, I went directly to the "Yi Bar". There were really not many view seats, so I sat in the booth. The wine list was considered complete in a star-rated hotel, but the taste of the cocktails was that I might only be worthy of drinking pure drinks. The waiter's walking posture and talking voice really shouldn't appear in a bar of this level. I really didn't have any impulse to open the wine. The environment was paid for, but the atmosphere was wrong.
Back to the guest room, night room, bedside mineral water prepared by the helper... nothing else
Since I was really disappointed in the bar, I didn't drink anything. I remember the guy said he would send a bottle of red wine in the evening, but I found that the red wine he said was sent was not in the room, so I asked the room service. The room service said that there was a note to send red wine, but it had not been sent yet. Do you want it to be sent now? (Looking at the watch, it was already 11 o'clock... I guess they were preparing to reserve breakfast with fried eggs for me)
The TV in the guest room needs to be raised and lowered due to design requirements, so the TV is really a little small.
I used the hotel's housekeeper iPad and the hotel's own management software, but I couldn't order food. I can only use the traditional method of calling. Wonton noodles: The noodles were soft and sticky when they were delivered (noodles may not be suitable for delivery to the guest room)
I set an alarm for breakfast in the morning, hoping to see the sunrise to make up for the view that could not be seen in the room. The hotel told me that the meal would be served at 6 o'clock. When I arrived at the restaurant, the buffet was not ready yet. A cute lady asked me what I wanted to drink. I learned that I had to wait until ***0 to order. The buffet was also healthier. I waited until ***0 to order. I ordered a shrimp dumpling, a spring roll, a cup of soy milk, and a pan-fried dish. All the dishes were served at 7.40... Breakfast from 6 to 7.40, the pan-fried dish and shrimp tasted good, but the others were just: not delicious. (Writing so many words under the beautiful sunrise early in the morning, it may be that the food was served too long.) A lady who appeared at the back of the restaurant relieved the embarrassment of the previous waiting.
However, it was still a plus to see the sunrise in Shanghai at 6 o'clock.
After returning to the room, my family got up and accompanied her to the restaurant again. There were more people and more waiters. We ordered seafood porridge (not tasty enough), wontons (cold soup), and scrambled eggs (ok), so the Western style in the breakfast restaurant is better than the Chinese style.
The air in the corridor of the guest room area is not very good, and the sound insulation of the guest room door is a little insufficient.
The basic etiquette of a five-star hotel is also achieved.
The content is not to give a bad review, but I really hope that domestic hotel management companies can be better.
The warmth of service is expressed by the details of management, and I hope it will be better~

msg:The experience of staying at Jhotel, the highest hotel in the world, is really great. I chose to propose at Jhotel this time. This hotel is in our new home and can be seen everywhere in Shanghai, so I think we will think of this proposal and my promise to her as soon as we see Shanghai Center in the future. Chose this one.
At first I thought that the hardware facilities of this hotel in the center of Shanghai should be pretty good. I was worried about whether the service could keep up with the proposal. After all, it was a new hotel. But my worries about them quickly disappeared. Lucas from the Guest Service Center immediately called me to confirm after the proposal I was a marriage proposal, and asked me to ask them if I needed any help. The hotel was very cooperative from start to finish, and gave us various services and surprises, which made my proposal a complete success and left beautiful memories.
 This time I want to pay special tribute to Cheryl Weng Jiahan and Zhang Wenxiang. Both of them are thinking from the perspective of customers. Considering that there are a lot of things on the day of my proposal, they will be very busy, so I told me many times to call them if I had anything to do. They will come to help and so on. Regardless of whether we need help or not, these words will make the guests feel at ease. The speech style, attitude, service, and standing posture of the two are very professional. This marriage proposal would not be so complete without the help of these two, so successful, I really appreciate it! !
Regarding hotel facilities, there is really nothing to say. The view of Jhotel, located on the upper floors of Shanghai Center, is its biggest advantage. The view from the room and lobby is really great. I still pay attention to the water pressure when I stay in the hotel, and the water pressure in the bath is also very strong and very comfortable. If you invite friends from abroad or from other places to Shanghai to make a good impression in Shanghai and give yourself face, I think this is the best choice. Breakfast is also a recommended place for this hotel, their semi-buffet breakfast, other hotels have some, they also have it, especially the prawns, the taste is really great.
My wife and I have stayed in at least 20 5-star hotels in Shanghai. This hotel impresses me not only about the marriage proposal, but also the deepest and most comfortable one. The only regret is the gym. The swimming pool was not open when we went. I don‚Äôt know what it looks like. I hope I will have the opportunity to experience it again in the future.
Finally, thank you all at Jhotel again! !

From the moment we started, we started to enjoy the service, and there was a dedicated person at the elevator entrance. Take the elevator, a handsome little brother. Our little brother Zhang Wenxiang, the supervisor of the housekeeper, helped us check in, and took us to the room to introduce the facilities in detail, and also added WeChat, so you can contact him for anything.
You can visit the hotel at five o'clock. The little brother Ju Tianlei introduced us in detail to the hotel, various restaurants with a view, and also visited the suites. He knew that we had an appoin**ent in the Cuiyuan on the fourth floor for dinner, because we needed to walk around downstairs. , I am afraid we can't find the way, but also specially lead us to the past.
The design and service of the hotel make us feel that the money is very worthwhile. The children and the elderly are also very happy. After posting a circle, my friends all expressed that they want to experience it in the future.

Check in at the lobby on the 101st floor, and then take the dedicated elevator down to the guest room area on the 91st floor. A handsome guy will accompany you to introduce hotel facilities and services. , I heard that some of our companions had birthdays on that day, indicating that the hotel will provide a birthday cake to show our hearts! The area and space of the guest room is larger than that of a general five-star hotel. It is amazing to be able to have such a scale in such an inch of gold. The guest room facilities are also very luxurious, the bed is very comfortable, and you can choose five different styles and functions of pillows at night. The bathroom is very large. , Dry and wet separation equipment is first-class, Hermes toiletries also show the hotel grade, alcohol and beverages are provided in the freezer, and beverages other than alcohol are free. The hotel buffet is on the 101st floor. The visual effect is great. You can see the end of Shanghai from farsightedness, and you can see the whole view of the Bund and Nanjing Road. What is slightly lacking is that the hotel‚Äôs fitness and swimming pool are currently not open. Most of the activities in the hotel are in the guest room or go to the lobby bar; secondly, due to the design of the building itself, the external visual effect of the guest room is not as good as expected. In the inner tube of Shanghai Center (the outer tube is curtain wall glass), there is a large space between the inside and the outside and the metal lever supported by the building, so the outside can only be seen from the gap between the glass and the lever. The photo and video effects are not ideal. The visual effect on the first floor is the most ideal. The restaurant on the 120th floor has not been visited, so I don‚Äôt know what the visual effect is. Overall, I feel that the experience of staying in this time is not bad. After all, I am in the clouds, high above üòÄ (the parking lot is located in the underground garage of the Shanghai Tower, there is no discount for hotel guests, 15 yuan per hour, and a ceiling of 120 yuan for 24 hours)

After arriving at the hotel, because we had booked for two nights, the butler arranged for us a Chinese-style room type. Later, we introduced other room types. We asked to change it the next day. The butler was very attentive to help us arrange it. After Tian helped us get the room card, he also took us to visit the hotel‚Äôs characteristic restaurants and other room types from top to bottom. Special like our housekeeper Kyro Zhang Qihao

msg:The opening of the Magic City J hotel has attracted worldwide attention, not only because of its status as the world's tallest hotel, but also because of its unique art design language and store collection of art treasures, luxurious and rich in connotation, which is very amazing.
I also experienced the very considerate service of the highly professional hotel staff. Ms. Jenny was particularly impressed, with extremely high professionalism and excellent affinity. She felt her love for the hotel industry and J hotel, so impressive!
J hotel has reached a new height in the world, and our China üá®üá≥ will continue to reach new world heights in various fields, look forward to it together!

msg:üçÉEnvironment: The newly opened J Hotel is a big hit. I came to Shanghai this time and stayed here specially. From the entrance to the room, it shows the vulgar luxury nightclub style. I think this is different from the high-end Chinese style. There are many metallic colors, as well as emerald green and Chinese red. What a strange elegance~
Room facilities: The room is very large, but the so-called Lujiazui landscape is not clear in the room. Because there are two layers of glass. There are a lot of things in the refrigerator wine cabinet, but only those with gift labels are free. Come on, with a room rate of four or five thousand per night, can't you be more generous? When drinking, you have to compare one by one to see if the label is attached?
The material of the shower cap is the best in the hotel I have stayed in.
However, the room with a room rate of four or five thousand per night does not have a Bluetooth speaker. It is really unacceptable that the waiter asked me to turn on the TV to listen to music.
üîîService: The service is very enthusiastic, and there are many foreign waiters. Sometimes the enthusiasm makes you feel a little at a loss.
Breakfast: The view of breakfast is great. But the restaurant is in an arc shape, and it is not very convenient to pick up food even if it is semi-self-service. In addition, for more than 168 rooms, the breakfast room is so small, even if it is to divert guests, I think it is unreasonable. Of course, the breakfast is quite exquisite, and the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall Congee is especially recommended.
Overall, because of this price, I feel that there are many things that do not match the price, such as the room view, the lack of room facilities, etc. ~

msg:Experienced two styles of room types: new Chinese style and fashionable modern style
This room is new Chinese style
Tips: Hotel visits and explanations are arranged at 10 am and 5 pm every day.
üöó Traffic: Don‚Äôt talk about traffic, landmark buildings, so easy to find
üßπSanitation: Newly opened hotel sanitationüëç
üçÉEnvironment: For those who like to live in high-rise buildings, this environment is first-rate, the highest in Asia, but friends who want to see the high-rise landscape, it is recommended to go to the public areas of the hotel. Due to the limitation of the building structure, the scenery of the Xiangyun room is not very good, it is double-glazed. As shown
The environment of the bar on the 84th floor is also superb, recommended~

üîîService: The service is super enthusiastic. The Ministry of Commerce will call you one day in advance to confirm part of the check-in information. From the 1F to the 101st floor lobby, there are always people leading the way.
The check-in front desk carefully asked about check-in habits. I always thought that I would wait for a snack, but it was actually cold or hot.
The front desk also gave me a small room card for me to keep as a souvenir. To help me get my toiletries, I also put it in a handbag. The details are very touched
Due to picture restrictions, the breakfast environment is not put up. The breakfast area is a single-layer glass. It is recommended that you experience it. The sunny day is super good, and you should pay attention to sun protection. Ha ha.
Little regret: Due to the epidemic, the gym and spa have not been opened yet, so I will check in next time. The restaurant on the 120th floor has not been booked.

There will always be voices of criticism and encouragement when new things come out. Criticism makes people progress and encourages them. I am willing to be a member of the encouragement and give such a good position to our own hotel brand operation. I hope he will get better and better!

msg:Because of the 10th anniversary, the hotel brand was given to J Hotel of Jinjiang Group. The first thing that gave me a very good impression was the service. From the underground garage until the housekeeper brought the room into the room, every hotel service staff was very enthusiastic and proactive, responsive and commendable. Secondly, when booking, the request for high floors was noted, and the 98th floor was given to the highest floor. For the anniversary, red wine and cakes were given, which was very considerate. Speaking of facilities, J Hotel is famous for being the tallest, but there is a layer of peripheral building outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the room, which has an impact on the view, but it is understandable for safety. In addition, the hotel does not have speakers, which is a bit confusing, and the hair dryer is a Xiaomi Mi from Dyson, which is also a bit embarrassing. Except for these two, everything else is perfect. There are many crystal decorations, which are noble and elegant. Breakfast is ok, half a la carte style can make the restaurant less noisy. After the swimming pool opens this year, I decided to take my parents to enjoy the pride of Shanghai again.

Staying in it, I was disturbed arbitrarily for two consecutive days, and the room was set up after nine o'clock in the morning. The waiter naturally opened the door with the key to enter.
For the profession of soft service, professional training is required for proficiency, and the force on the virtual surface is more useful to the details.
The faucet discharges water, and there is no water control between cold and hot, which is a serious waste. In such a high building, electricity or energy is wasted when the water pressure goes up.
