The room is always clean and tidy, and the things you need are delivered in a timely manner. After playing outside for a whole day, it feels as safe as returning home.

It has its own exclusive service group. Everything is in place in advance. Each small townhouse has an independent garage.
There is sweet soup every night, which is really heartwarming.
Breakfast is delivered to the room. The hotel said it was delivered. It arrived at the door super on time. When I left the hotel, there was also an exclusive person waiting at the door. I didn’t have to go through the formalities myself. I just handed in the room card and left. Anyway, I will choose this place next time I come back!

msg:This is a hotel that gave me a big surprise. I saw an event on Ctrip at that time, so I bought a three-day and two-night voucher for this hotel. I felt that it was very cost-effective. The hotel is very close to Qingyan Ancient Town, just a few minutes' walk away. The hotel environment is very good. You can see the scenery of the ancient town from the balcony. The following pictures 3, 4, and 5 were all taken from the balcony of the room. The room is very large and the floor height is also very high. It is very comfortable to live in. The snacks sent upon check-in are of high quality. Potato chips, nuts and cookies are sent every day. On the first day, 4 small car companions were sent, and there was afternoon tea. Breakfast was delivered to the room at the time we requested, one for each person, very delicate, and there was sweet soup in the evening, which was different every day and very delicious.
The service is super good. The hotel front desk contacted me the day before check-in. At that time, a group was established. There were 16 people in the group, and 15 people were for me alone. I enjoyed the VIP service properly. I was asked to reply in seconds, and I handled it as soon as possible, telling you the weather, travel guide, and food choices. The service was warm and enthusiastic when I checked in and checked out. They took my luggage, patiently explained the route to the attractions to me, and prepared a travel map for me. The service of the whole team was really great. This is the best team I felt during my 15-day trip to Guizhou.

The resort hotel, the swimming pool and the children's center were not open. The hotel said that there were too few people staying. There were not many types of breakfast. The staff said that it was a semi-buffet breakfast. There was nothing. I wanted to check out early, but the hotel didn't agree. I applied for early departure the day before, which would not affect the hotel's normal sale of rooms. After several negotiations, they refunded me and deducted 30% of the liquidated damages. The normal check-out time was 2 o'clock, but the hotel didn't agree, saying that it would affect the continued sale of rooms. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation. The facilities are not open. The reason is that there are few people staying. Checking out at 2 o'clock will affect the hotel's continued sale.

Sanitation: Clean and tidy, the cleaning service staff is professional and serious

Environment: The environment is the biggest reason for me to choose Longxili, the ecology is livable, and the eyes are full of green

Service: After checking in, a 13-to-1 exclusive service group is established, and the shuttle bus and other services can be said to be available 24 hours a day. Especially on the last night, the upstairs kid was noisy, and after giving feedback to the hotel, we received a positive response and properly resolved it, which was very professional!

Suggestion: The room type we stayed in is as large as 90 square meters, and I personally think it should be fully utilized. For example, two TVs are not very meaningful, and one of them can be replaced with a smart projector. In addition, the comfort of the mattress needs to be improved. It is a bit too soft, and the waist is less supported, which is a flaw in the white jade.

I am still very satisfied overall, and it will still be the first choice when I come to Huaxi in the future!

I took a quick look at the reviews and found that I had received more than 50 positive reviews in a row. I tried it with a try-it attitude, and the result was better than I expected. The hotel not only has a superior geographical location, but also convenient transportation. It is also very close to the ancient town. There is an observation deck in the hotel lobby, where you can directly see the scenery of the ancient town, which is very pleasant. The service staff is very enthusiastic! As soon as we got off the car, we greeted us at the door, took the initiative to open the door for us to take our luggage, and took the initiative to bring us tea when checking in. We also introduced us to the check-in points in the ancient town. By the way, we also pulled an exclusive service group for us, which is exclusive! The group sent us the location of the check-in points in the ancient town, which is quite good! The hotel's breakfast is also good, with a rich variety. The hotel's sour soup beef tastes great. The set meal is delicious and a separate beef is added. In short, it is a very pleasant experience!

msg:The hotel I stayed in Guiyang this time was very interesting. It was a surprise during the trip.
This time I came here mainly to escape the summer heat by taking advantage of the 50% discount event in the whole scenic area of ​​Guizhou. I passed through Qingyan Ancient Town, so I booked this hotel the night before.
Before I checked in, I received a call from the hotel and started a group chat. Many people were active in the group to welcome us. To be honest, it might be a bit sentimental. I actually felt a little bit at home in a strange city.
We arrived at the hotel at around nine o'clock in the evening. It was already dark. On the way here, the hotel staff kept reminding us to pay attention to safety, checked the time with us, and guided us.
After arriving at the lobby, I found that the hotel staff was waiting for us at the door early to welcome us. Because we knew that we had ordered a two-bedroom villa, they reminded us not to take the luggage, saying that the villa area was parking and entering the house, which was another surprise for us because we had too much luggage.
After checking in quickly, the front desk gave us a lot of tickets to the ancient town, and suggested that we go to the ancient town early in the morning. They also took a map to guide me, recommend the food in the ancient town, and the surrounding places to play. Actually, I came here to play casually, but now I have a guide.
After guiding us to the villa room, the young man in the front hall began to help us carry our luggage upstairs. We had several large boxes, but they brought them up without saying a word. We said we came by ourselves, but they insisted on telling us where to put them and let them come.
The room is a two-bedroom villa, so there are two floors. The room is antique, but it is not lacking in modern traces. The bed is also much softer than the hotel I stayed in before, and it feels like it is slowly softening.
I would like to give you a suggestion. You must eat the mini bar food in the room. Hahahaha
Because we arrived late, we drove for several hours from Sichuan and didn’t have dinner. We asked in the group early if there was anything delicious. The staff in charge of catering recommended us Guizhou specialty sour soup hot pot. The surprise was that it could be delivered to the room???
After we arrived in the room, the group sent a message to ask if the sour soup hot pot could be delivered? Don’t say it, eating hot pot in the night, the fatigue of rushing on the road was washed away by more than half.
Anyway, this hotel gave me a great experience. I will stay here again when I return.

I read the reservation information in advance and need to check in at 3 o'clock. When the time comes, I come to the front desk to check in. The front desk here is simply too unprofessional. After finishing the room, I gave the room card and didn't say anything. What facilities? How are the floors distributed, what are their characteristics, where is the place to live, and how can I find it? Should you let the guests go on foot to find where they want to go? It's not a bit worse than the service of the top scholar's hospital! This is simply not as good as a homestay! The child wanted to go swimming for a long time, but when he arrived, he said that it was not open because of the epidemic! So what else is worth staying at in this hotel? Fortunately, some children's activity girls are still more enthusiastic, and the children have not yet returned from disappoin**ent. The service gave 2 points to the enthusiastic girls in the activity depar**ent.
Let’s talk about the room facilities. As a self-proclaimed high-end hotel, the room of nearly 100 square meters does not even have a bathtub and a full-length mirror. When you come to the room, you will encounter the problem of clogging the sink, which is really speechless!
Writing this review is to suggest that this hotel should make some improvements in management. The hotel is to bring happiness and convenience to the guests. How to make the guests satisfied will you have more guests staying! In addition, whether the hotel is for families or business guests, I suggest you make it clear first. It was originally a very good theme hotel, but how did it make it like this!

衞生：中規中矩，可能是人住的少吧，屋外院子會有蜘蛛網。
環境：離青巖古鎮南門差不多500米，給的門票是10元的大門票，這小氣的確實有點無語。
服務：酒店的健身房，兵乓球室，桌球室，小童樂園基本沒人管理，不是我在攜程看到有這些東西，根本沒人説，早餐沒有菜單，就是一人一份送房間，和城市裡300元一晚的酒店吃的差不多，唯一的亮點是加了個羣，能滿足基本需求（對羣裏的服務人員提出表揚）。
歡迎水果:放的蘋果，山竹，獼猴桃就沒法吃，要麼別上，上了就上好的，你們自己也吃吃看看。
入住鮮花:沒看見在哪，也沒人説。
每日迷你吧:2瓶茶飲，2瓶200ml可樂，2個旺仔牛奶，可能最貴的就是2瓶依雲水了吧。
總結:碧桂園旗下品牌，定價偏高，確實讓人有種上當受騙的感覺，想比肩柏聯、安曼，不要衹在價格上。本人作為一個業餘旅遊博主，個人覺得淡季房價在2000～2500元較為合理。

因為經常旅遊，對酒店的環境很挑剔，當時選擇這家酒店也是看中了他臨近古鎮，還送門票哈哈哈。酒店自身帶有濃厚的園林氣息。對我而言旅途中的疲憊衹有自然的療養才能緩過來，所以這種別墅園林風貌對我吸引力十足。
更可喜的是服務優良，算是我入住這麼多了酒店中排在前列的，剛訂購不久前往酒店的路上，酒店的管家就已經詢問我什麼時候到酒店，還拉了一個羣，發定位並附上了他們整理出來的旅遊攻略。另外入住期間任何需求那邊基本上三分鐘就能得到反饋，且迅速提供解決方案。
到了酒店果然不負期待，酒店環境幽靜清新，植被很茂密，聽管家介紹説這裏收羅有貴陽絕大部分植物品種。
因為到酒店是下午，所以也嘗試了他們推薦的下午茶，很好吃，而且坐在露台上邊吃邊眺望古鎮風貌真的很愜意，可惜忘了拍照片……

msg:非常棒的體驗，超出預期
很晚才到店辦理入住的，已經做好了服務不到位的心理準備，但是從前一晚跟我聯繫開始，就感受如沐春風，細節體貼到位，我們2點多辦理入住，工作人員立馬把我們行李接過去了，值班工作人員都會致意問好，熱情又禮貌的招待，第二天管家就在大堂門口迎接，帶領我們去餐廳用早餐，給我們介紹環境、設施，服務，路上遇到的每一位工作人員，都熱情解答，並親自引導帶我去到我想去的地方，房間設施品質高，細節處見高低，整個一個大放鬆，聽着舒緩的音樂，泡了一個澡，太太太太舒服了，特別放鬆。再誇誇酒店的餐廳，食物品質都很高，主推酸湯牛肉火鍋套餐，品嚐了一把地道的貴州特色酸湯，能講的細節太多我都鋪不開，總的來説就是硬件高端，服務細節周到，品質上乘，肉體和心靈都得到無比的滿足和放鬆，感謝龍溪裏，週末無疑出來放鬆的，而我的開心是你們給的，神仙酒店，強推。

msg:這個酒店就在青巖附近，入住算是碰巧，驅車到青巖南門路過了這一排排別墅，設計風格比較中式，因為帶了爸爸媽媽兩位長者，一眼就喜歡上了，所以選擇入住，算是巧合，但是入住下來實則是驚喜！
酒店很大處處是植物，空氣清新自然，入住後可以在酒店內部逛逛，自然生態很好，綠化做的很漂亮，覆蓋面積很大，房間對面就能看到青巖古鎮，景觀一絕。
來之前做了景區攻略，前台小姐姐很熱心的翻看我做的攻略，並認真的推薦衹有本地人擁有的地方美食不踩坑，特別感謝兩位長者玩的很開心。
印象最深的是，有隨時溝通的羣聊，讓我們隨時都可以聯絡，感覺像回家一樣自然。
這次度假讓我感到很放鬆，讓我覺得很自然。
值得大大的贊，也值得我更多期待。

msg:孩子來到房間驚呼，這裏也太好了吧！
房間特別寬敞，正對古城和城前的湖，鄭和的船隊。日出古城，風景如畫。
入住前酒店拉了服務羣，15v1，這服務沒得説，有問必答，有求必應。
最讓我驚訝的是竟然提供藍月亮洗衣液，正好攢了一堆衣服，抓緊洗起來。陽台有晾衣繩，太貼心了。
酒店離古城非常近，有一條小路直通南門，早上8點前進古鎮不收門票，也沒什麼人，特別安靜。真是超級喜歡這裏。

msg:暑期帶着小朋友必選酒店之一，酒店位置就在青巖古鎮旁，開車經過別墅區域風景絕佳，空氣質量在市區是感受不到的，整體服務超級棒！！
辦理入住時小哥哥很熱情的幫忙搬運行李，管家還給我們送上歡迎茶，感覺像家一樣，小朋友特別開心，還建立了專屬服務管家羣，觀光車送回房間，房間有庭院還配了私人停車位，房間內的物品乾淨整潔
早餐很有特色，糕粑稀飯，花溪牛肉粉，腸旺麪口味正宗，鮮榨果汁應有盡有，環境特別安靜，可以看到青巖古鎮的長城，服務員特別熱情主動，像家人一樣關照我們，牛肉粉幹了2份
早餐之後小朋友到了小童樂園，乒乓球室，桌球室，瑜伽室，健身房開心得很，總體來説這次入住體驗很棒，不管是配套，服務態度，比較推薦的一家酒店，小朋友寒假還要再來。

msg:來貴陽之前對比了很多家酒店，最終選擇了這裏，接下來就講講來到這裏的感受吧
1.入住前：入住當天早上10點左右酒店就打電話詢問抵達時間，併為我們一行創建了一個專屬的服務羣，管家在羣內推薦了很多周邊的景點和吃飯的地方，非常暖心
2.來之前看了攜程上面的圖片，還抱有懷疑的態度，想着圖片肯定有美化的成分，酒店能有60%的還原度我就算滿意的了。到店後發現圖片真的沒有誇張，還原度95%，真是又驚又喜。
3.由於我們有3個人，預訂的大床房，後面跟酒店協商換雙床房，小姐姐帶我們去房間的時候按的負一樓，我還很詫異的想：房間在負一樓會不會景觀不好，想着換樓層的，結果人家酒店所有房間的視野都是一個朝向的，都視野極好，雖説房間在負一樓，但是房間空間很大，窗外的景觀就是青巖古鎮和定廣湖，到達當天天氣很好，心情就更好了
4.因為酒店裡古鎮很近，小姐姐建議我們步行5分鐘到古鎮會更近一點，還送了2張古鎮門票，nice👍
5.早餐：用餐就在大廳後面，有當地比較特色的糕粑稀飯、花溪米粉等，種類不算多但勝在味道都還不錯。
6.衞生：房間整體衞生不錯，因為是園林酒店，周圍綠植豐富，沿途有很多果樹（石榴、桃子），整體我是滿意的
7.房間還配有迷你吧，入住期間都能免費使用，房間性價比槓槓的
這算是我住過所有無論是景區內還是景周邊酒店的性價比之王，無論是環境還是服務都是達到了應有的水平，推薦推薦

房間裏面也是超級寬敞，落地大窗一眼望去彷彿就是在俯瞰這個城市!而且對面就是著名的5A級景區青巖古鎮，風景簡直不要太好！看累了江山,還能到前台喝喝下午茶看自己喜歡的電影和電視!晚上的話還特地給我們送了晚安甜湯，簡直太美味了！整體來説酒店環境舒適,服務細緻周到，還有健身房，棋牌室和乒乓球室等多種多樣的設施設備和服務。
早餐品種豐盛，由於很疲憊不想起來，讓送到房間裏，味道很巴適，住店期間的小小需求他們都會非常重視，一個電話需要的東西立馬就能送到，是真的衣來伸手，飯來張口哈哈哈~這樣的酒店值得讓人留戀！
