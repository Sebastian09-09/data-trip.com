msg:The pros: Clean hotel, spacious and well designed rooms, amazing furniture. Very close to the airport with free transfers (to the airport). It takes approx 80 mins to get to Qingdao via the metro from the airport.

The cons: Air conditioner in my room didnt work, same with the water heater. Their is a constant awful (eerie) sound blasting from a speaker outside (or from the) hotel. I have no idea what for though.

msg:Noisy. The hotel has eight hundred reasons to tell me why it can't do anything. The funniest thing is that the newly opened hotel in 2024 can't watch TV. It's really funny. The hotel I stayed in two days ago, which opened in 1997, can help me cast the TV screen. Your newly opened hotel this year told me that it didn't consider the problem of TV casting before opening. Please, you should always figure it out. Even if you watch it directly on the TV, 1 there is no signal source 2 members who have logged in to the built-in app cannot be offline. If I want to watch it, I have to recharge other people's accounts. There are a lot of bugs. The hotel can't provide laundry service. There are no slippers in the room. At nearly 11 o'clock, the robot has to deliver slippers. You are really funny. There are many problems in the hotel. The supplies in the room are missing. After leaving the hotel, they are still asked to give good reviews. The untrained team should be replaced as soon as possible 🤮

There are few varieties of breakfast. The bread is basically in bags, not freshly baked. There is only one watermelon as a fruit variety. The taste is very ordinary. I can only eat a little! The vegetables have been left for too long, so they are soft and can't be added. The check-in experience is very bad. However, after the complaint, the front desk manager also apologized. The hardware problem can't be solved. I can only send a small gift to express my apology!

msg:酒店總體還不錯，由於新裝修房間氣味比較大，前台Moira接到投訴後立馬安排逐間挑選更換房間。不過華所有房間都有一些味道，最終Moira機智的幫我更換了隔壁已開業兩年的秋臨酒店套房。由於Moira細心體貼的服務，總體入住體驗還不錯。
