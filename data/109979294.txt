The butler service was very popular with me. From picking up the luggage at the parking lot to checking out, the whole resort was very beautiful. It felt like I was abroad.

There is a staircase down when entering the room, but the moment I opened the door, I felt it was beautiful!

The butler service is very sincere and responds to our needs at any time. The butler Xiao Qian, the original family 500 years ago, provided very good service. My wife and children like him very much. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival and summer vacation, I plan to invite a few friends to stay for 3-5 days to experience this comfortable and lazy life. Five-star recommendation!

He called in advance to confirm the itinerary, and then added the butler's WeChat to teach me how to book tickets for the scenic spot. Later, he recommended the surrounding scenic spots to play. It was a surprise. I was thinking about how to arrange a trip with my family. The hotel butler recommended the hotel's hiking routes and attractions to us, the Yu Village Guoqing Street next to the hotel, and also told us that we had to book the attractions in advance to go to Moganshan, which was very good. When checking in, I saw that I brought children and took the initiative to send children's slippers, toothbrushes, etc. I took the initiative to help carry the luggage to the room, enthusiastically introduced the hotel's dining, and the room's facilities were complete. The room was clean and tidy, and it was very comfortable to live in. The mini bar in the room is free, the bed is very soft, the air conditioner is turned on in advance, it is very cool when you go in, and the bathroom is separated into dry and wet. I like this resort hotel very much. I am very satisfied with this stay. By the way, the hotel also has a small children's playground, and the children at home especially like ocean balls. The hotel feels like it is in a mountain forest, with a beautiful environment, and it is very beautiful to take pictures

Second, after staying in so many hotels, this is the first time I feel the excitement of a suspended swimming pool. Third, the restaurant food is also delicious, all fresh ingredients of the season. Fourth, the hotel facilities are very complete, and the off-road vehicle and outdoor swimming pool have been experienced, which are very good. I suggest that you must take an off-road vehicle to the tree house on the top of the mountain to have a cup of coffee or a drink, overlooking the entire Mogan Mountain, instantly letting the troubles go behind your head, breathing in the fresh air, refreshing and refreshing. So the Suspended Swimming Hotel is a good choice, you can also try it.

We got together and played mahjong that night. We drove an off-road vehicle the next day. I think traveling should not be restricted by age, but should go to many fun places while we are young. The key is that this place has partners who have played together before. When I came to Xuanyong Hotel, I felt much more relaxed. It is a place to raise people. There is also a sales office here. My bestie and I are discussing whether to buy a set as a place for our retirement and have our own resort. We also left the sales office's phone number. I think we will get together again.

The public swimming pool has problems, the temperature is not constant, the temperature gauge does not display, and the pool turns green. 😂

Except for the hotel room with its own swimming pool, there is nothing to do

The breakfast is a bit weak compared to the resort hotel I stayed in before. After dinner, it rained and the stairs outside were easy to slip and fall directly~ There is only an elevator at the breakfast place

There is no sign in the room. I looked for it for a long time and thought I went to the wrong place. There is no sign at the door to the room, which makes people think it is a logistics passage. Who would have thought that the picture below is the door to the room worth more than 1,600

Reading books when you are free, and sharing the leisurely afternoon tea with three or five friends, lazy and comfortable.
I specifically praise the butler service here, from the parking lot to the check-in, the whole process is a smiling service. The butler will reply to the message in seconds at any time, and the shuttle bus will respond quickly.
I will choose Xuanyong Resort for my next vacation👍

msg:The hotel package purchased by the group during the off-season included three days and two nights. I was very satisfied and it was a worthwhile trip. It is an ordinary twin room, but we were upgraded to a king-bed room on the top floor swimming pool terrace for free. The super large swimming pool is just outside the room. If you come to play in the water directly in the summer, you will be super happy! The guest room is spacious, has a good view, and the scenery is beautiful. You can sleep directly among the lakes and mountains, and breathe fresh air as soon as you get up. A wonderful day begins. There will be a shuttle bus from the hotel lobby to the room, passing by a lake and a beach. During this period, I kept lamenting why I can't make money and can't buy a villa here! ? According to people who came to see the house, a villa here costs RMB 10 million. The breakfast buffet has a little less variety, maybe because there are fewer guests in the off-season, but the taste is pretty good. On the third day, because of the bad weather, there were fewer customers, so we ordered food directly and had it delivered to our room. There was so much food that we couldn’t even finish it after two meals. The little sister had to carry it many times before it was all finished. Thank you for the hard work of the little sister and the chef. . We also rode off-road vehicles and played golf, both for the first time, and it was a great experience. I am very grateful to my exclusive hotel butler Song Changrui. He is gentle and patient. He is very understanding and cooperative with all requests. He also responded to messages in a timely manner in the middle of the night. He is really nice and even used a drone to take photos for us! The one thing I am not satisfied with is that there is no place to put toiletries in the bathroom. It would be better if it could be optimized. It is also more convenient to travel by car. It is very close to eating and playing. We went to Mogan Mountain to play. There are many high-end hotels nearby, but there are few lakes, so I really feel that the hotel we booked is very good. Haha, my friends and I were very satisfied with the stay and food! I’ll bring my family to play next time if I have a chance😄

msg:1. The room is very damp. As soon as you enter the room, you can smell the damp smell.
2. It doesn't match the room description. I booked a suite of 138-14***, but I was given two separate rooms. Which couple would stay in two rooms? The two rooms share a swimming pool. It's a bit of a scam.
3. The service is very poor. It's a villa hotel. You have to use its shuttle bus to go everywhere. It took more than 10 minutes to arrive after calling. The efficiency is amazing.
4. I was taking a shower in the room in the morning. The waiter knocked on the door and responded that it was inconvenient, but he just pushed the door open. I don't know how he was trained.

In short, this hotel is really bad. I won't stay here even if I'm given 680 next time for 3680. It's too bad. This is the first time I've written a bad review of a hotel on Ctrip in 15 years. Let everyone learn from it.

During check-in and check-out, I saw stainless steel rice bowls on the table at the front desk twice. Employees are not uniformly dressed. The building design is unreasonable. The pool suite on the highest floor only has stairs and no elevator. I can't imagine how my aunt moved the floor scrubber and pool cleaning machine into the room. This directly led to a huge loss of hygiene. The pool was dirty and the floor of the room was dirty. Many of the hotel's facilities are only in name. They cannot be used during maintenance of the garden pool, the suspended swimming pool, or the rotating slide. It is not recommended to go there until the hotel's waterfall is ready.
Finally, I would like to praise the housekeeper, the only bright spot, for his patience and dedication to his duties.

The only drawback is that the breakfast is mediocre and there are not many choices. The hygiene situation is average. When I checked in, I went to the toilet next to the front desk. Every time I pushed the door, there was used toilet paper spilling out. When I returned to the room, the toilet was not very clean. I wiped it again. .
Maybe it's because it's newly opened, so some areas still need to be further improved. But the shortcomings do not hide the good points. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will come again when the weather is hot.

msg:The hotel is surrounded by mountains and water, quiet and quiet. There are not many guests in the off-season. The lady at the front desk helped us upgrade to a penthouse suite for free. The bedroom curtains are opened to reveal a 180-degree view. We made a reservation for the heated swimming pool in the evening. The water temperature was 37 degrees and swimming under the starry sky on a winter night was so pleasant! The bedding, pillows and mattress in the guest room are just right, the towels are of good quality, and the butler service is very considerate. All in all, it was a heart-warming stay experience. I will come back again when the season changes!

The hotel's architecture is unique, and the blue and white buildings make you feel like you are in Greece. Watching the sunset and the wind blowing next to the rooftop heated swimming pool is a relaxing feeling that cannot be experienced anywhere else.

msg:住過的酒店不少，寫評價的不多。
首先感謝管家沈露餘，一個温柔純粹的女孩，給人一種賓至如歸的温暖。
先拋出結論，雖然酒店不算奢華，也沒有高標準的硬件，周邊比較空曠。但耐不住空間大、可玩性高、管家服務周到，讓一家人其樂融融，共享天倫之樂，我想，這才是真正意義上的好酒店，也是這次旅程的意義所在。私享泳池、高爾夫、ATV越野車（致謝教練），讓長者也感受到了返老還童的樂趣。
美中不足的是早餐用餐時頂層泳池保潔潑下的水，以及在維修中的高空懸泳略煞風景，還有不那麼豐富的早餐選擇。
不過總算完美，能讓全家快樂才是最重要的。

本來倒也沒有過高的期待，如果以預售券的價格可以一住，正常價格的話可替代的高端酒店太多了。

泳池的燈光也是一絕，可以聯繫管家遠程關掉。還有孩子玩的不亦樂乎，沙子特別乾淨，孩子們玩一個下午都不會膩，解放父母的雙手了。這個高爾夫的地方，直接面對深山老林，很解壓。過年看到酒店員工的團建活動，寫毛筆字，也湊了個熱鬧。
到哪裡都能叫上接駁車，還很及時，到哪裡都很方便。有機會，下一次再來❤

🛏️最讓我驚喜的是酒店免費為我們升級了房型，全景落地玻璃窗，將山景盡收眼底。讓我可以盡情欣賞山河之間的浪漫，感受大自然的鬼斧神工。🍃
🤩酒店的專屬管家錢德先生的服務征服了我🤗他就像私人小助手一樣，把我們的需求照顧得無微不至。🧡不僅給我推薦了當地最好吃的館子和最有趣的景點，還幫我安排了各種活動，讓我的旅途變得超級豐富！得知第二天是我母親的生日，特地安排了生日晚宴，👍他的細心和熱情真的讓我有一種賓至如歸的感覺，簡直太讚了！
另外，提到生日晚宴，真可謂🍴一場味蕾的盛宴，一次身心的享受。😋餐飲負責人劉潘元先生不僅提前準備了完美的菜單，還主動多次與我溝通，以確保餐點和我們的口味，同時也讓我們品嚐到了最正宗的德清菜，每一口都讓人陶醉。😍廚師們對食材的尊重和對烹飪的熱情，讓我感受到了他們對美食的執着。👨🍳無論是精緻的主菜還是誘人的點心，每一道都宛如藝術品，讓人不忍下口。🍮在這裏，美食不僅是一種味覺的享受，更是一種藝術的體驗。🎨
🎉當然這裏還有許多獨特的設施和體驗，比如在全國少有的高空玻璃懸空泳池暢遊🏊♂️，或者在山上打高爾夫，漫步在玻璃棧道欣賞美景，這次由於行程和氣候的關係沒有完全體驗，但是也是為下次留下懸念，我已經期待下次窗外的蟲鳴鳥叫，遠山處雲霧起落，玻璃棧道的日出🌄日落🌅了
我願意與大家分享這份美好，推薦大家一定要來嘗試！🤩

唯一不足的地方就是那個高爾夫練習場，很雞肋，就是練推桿。其他都很好，服務很到位！

淡季房間的泳池不加熱，衹開了一個恆温的公共泳池，其實就是客房，按預約時段游泳，玩的還是挺開心的。不過每天要接待好幾組客人，每組之間無縫銜接，打掃會不太及時，這點需要改進。還不如把房間改造成公共泳池，多幾個淋浴和換衣的位置。
整個度假村依山傍水，環境還是不錯的，就是不知道淡季還是什麼原因，很多設施沒有啟用，可玩性會不足。
管家服務不錯，有需求都會及時響應。工作人員也很熱情，都會主動打招呼。臨走前管家露露還贈送了伴手禮，給個好評。

msg:莫幹山這家頂奢酒店環境真的巨無敵好！咱就是説不想走了，一整個愛住！房間乾淨整潔，光線很好，超級喜歡房間旁邊的這個露台，視野非常開闊，有沙發躺椅，遮陽傘，所有房間更是自帶恆温泳池，在長三角應該是天花板的存在了，打開房間移門就能跳進泳池，大熱天我們可以泡一整天。酒店面積很大，白沙灘，水上教堂，直升機停機坪，未來還有高爾夫揮桿練習，水上運動等項目一應俱全，想去哪裡都有接駁車接送服務，簡直不要太貼心。而且工作人員無處不在，都很熱情很耐心，入住退房都有伴手禮，簡直驚喜滿滿。強烈推薦！一定會再回來！
