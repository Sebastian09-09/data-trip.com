msg:The bathroom in the wooden house is very small, there is no distinction between wet and dry, and the water pressure is insufficient, so it is impossible to take a shower at all. The so-called hot spring hotel wooden house hotel only has a small outdoor hot spring play area. The hot spring pool is not cleaned thoroughly, there is a layer of floating objects in the water, and there are leeches, so I dare not go down for a dip.

msg:I live on the 12th, and it takes about 2 hours to drive in Dalian. It is no problem to follow the navigation. There are not many shops around, so bring your own fruit and the like. The privacy is very good, the swimming pool is 14 meters, enough for playing, the swimming pool and the running water in the swimming pool keep the temperature, the children don't want to go ashore after playing. There is no big problem with catering. It is difficult to adjust to everyone's taste, because the food is delivered to the room, and the taste of the food that is delicious while it is hot will be affected, and the price is moderate. The service response is very timely, praise. The downside is that there is a problem with the constant temperature control of the shower. Sometimes the water will be cold, but it is within the tolerance range. It would be better if there is a heating place for the bathrobes and towels used outdoors. Next time, I will find a time when it is not particularly cold. It is said that barbecues are also available.

msg:The private hot springs around Dalian ♨️ have almost been brushed again. I personally feel that the price-performance ratio is not very high. Compared with the generation of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, there are about 3000 hot spring hotels. All aspects need to be improved. However, for Dalian, it is indeed a top-level enjoyment. The soup is the biggest, although the decoration is a bit old, but it is not old, maybe there are not many people who do it. The service is also good, butler service, as long as you don't want to, you don't need to contact anyone except the staff during the whole process.
