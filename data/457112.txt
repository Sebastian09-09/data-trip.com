And half the lobby lights turned off to save money on power? Pillows so flacid, we needed 4 of them under the head. But also, the location is horrible, surrounded by wasteland and construction.   Frankly, we feel cheated and insulted, but at least we have a good story.  Send your worst enemy here.

msg:I was due to arrive Beijing around 4 pm, but as there were severe delays in my flight due to weather conditions. I had to instead take a 6 hour train. Throughout my journey, I was in touch with the hotel manager Alice and she was absolutely amazing with the service. She made sure that every detail was attended to when I arrived, as well as a complimentary bottle of wine for my hard travels！The point which made the service exceptional was the next day where I found it hard to get a cab to my meeting. She made sure that I found a cab where I made it to the meeting on time! AMAZING. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wishes to visit Beijing. I for one will make plans to return so I can leave another exceptional review for Alice and her wonderful team. The photos are great but don’t do justice to the service which was brilliant. Thank you very much! The breakfast was delicious too! 我原定于下午 4 点左右到达北京，但由于天气原因，我的航班严重延误。 我不得不乘坐 6 小时的火车。 在我的整个旅程中，我与酒店经理 Alice 保持联系，她对这项服务非常满意。 当我到达时，她确保每一个细节都得到照顾，并为我的艰苦旅行提供一瓶免费的葡萄酒！使这项服务与众不同的一点是第二天我发现很难打车去我的会议。 她确保我找到了一辆出租车，我准时到达了会议！ 惊人。 我肯定会向任何想要访问北京的人推荐这个地方。 我会制定返回的计划，这样我就可以为爱丽丝和她出色的团队留下另一篇出色的评论。 这些照片很棒，但对出色的服务并不公平。 早饭也超级好吃呀非常感谢你！

I feel that the receptionist is not enthusiastic enough. The room fee is ¥742, and a total of ¥1500 is collected. The rest is used as a deposit. It is said that the deposit will be refunded only after inspection when checking out. Of course, I know it may be someone's rule, but I always feel that this rule ignores the guests a bit. Do you have something valuable in your room that requires a deposit of more than 700 yuan? You also said that you have to check before you can refund the money, which makes the guests feel uncomfortable.

msg:1. The flushing force of the toilet in the room is not good. I flushed it several times on the first day of use.
2. There is no luggage rack. The suitcase is placed on the ground, which is very inconvenient to use.
3. I called the landline one-touch "reception". A male waiter answered the phone. I said I wanted a children's bathrobe. He said he would ask for me, and there was no follow-up. I went out for dinner and asked the front desk again. The front desk said that they didn't know who answered the call and told me to send it to me. Later, they told me that there was no children's bathrobe. The next day, I needed to call and hung up in a hurry!
4. When I checked in, I said I might stay longer. The front desk said to keep it for me first. I asked if it was still the same price. The front desk said that Ctrip could book it. The next morning, Ctrip was full of this room type. In the afternoon, the hotel called to ask if I would stay longer. A lady service staff had a cold and arrogant tone. I told her that the website was full. She asked me to book a big bed. I said the original room? She said that she didn't need to change the room. I explained the situation yesterday. She said to check it out. It seems that she didn't see the relevant information when she asked by phone. My request to stay longer at the original price was expressed tactfully, and the service staff refused firmly. The process standard was indeed in place.
5. When I extended my stay, there was only one service staff at the front desk, and her attitude was gentle, but she could not charge the first-day price. There was no other way. The system and policy were like this, so I didn't blame her. In the middle of my processing, the only front desk receptionist received a long phone call, and two guests came to cut in line to deposit their belongings. She was very busy, and I also felt that she tried to ask the guests to wait for me to continue processing, but there was no suitable way to solve it, so I waited for a long time. When I was able to continue processing, I said that the toilet was not working well. Can I change the room? She said that the hotel was full and the only room that could be changed was worse than my room. At that time, the website had opened a lot of room types available. I understand that I can't upgrade and can't charge the first-day price, but the expression is a bit anxious. But for a hotel of this size, one receptionist is a bit too few, even at night.
6. Although I don't know how the breakfast and upgraded rooms mentioned in the online reviews were achieved, I can understand the difference in service between staying in room 600 and room 1300.
7. Finally, I would like to praise the room service staff for being very friendly. They would say hello when they met us, they looked in good spirits, and they were very polite when delivering gifts. Of course, this is normal etiquette for a hotel of this level, but it was still very kind of them to do so.

Especially Ms. Wang Xiaofeng, she is anxious to help the guests, which makes us quite satisfied. But there is also a thing that makes us uncomfortable. The shoe horn in the room broke in our hand after a long period of wear and tear. The hotel asked us to compensate 54 yuan. This matter made us very uncomfortable. It is unreasonable to ask a guest to compensate for such a consumable product!

msg:This time I stayed in the Shangshu Room of the Palace Hotel. The room was very large and had a private hot spring pool and massage bed, as well as milk bath and other essential oils. It was quite nice. However, there is no curtain in the room, so you will really be woken up by the sun in the morning, and the room is empty and has little furniture.

Let’s talk about the experience of bathing in the hot spring. I went there very late and almost no one seemed to reserve the place. But the waiter really watched you take off your clothes the whole time, which is probably too unfriendly to Southern society.
Freshly cut fruit, very good. You can drink whatever you want, which is not bad, but there is not much entertainment and the area is not big. All in all, the price/performance ratio is pretty good.

I took a walk around the museum and it was pretty good. But the area is not very big, so I suggest you put something up for introduction.

I will stay here again because of this girl next time I go to Beijing on business. It made me feel very comfortable. I missed the trip early in the morning, but I had already checked out of the hotel. This beauty helped me solve the problem and asked me to go back to my original room in the hotel and wait until the next high-speed rail ticket time. Even though I checked out, I continued to rest in the hotel and wait for the high-speed train, because it was only 700 meters away from the high-speed rail station. I like this hotel so much, the service is good, the hotel is comfortable, everything is good. I will definitely come back next time. Very unforgettable. Give 10,000 likes.

The room is spacious and clean as shown in the picture, and all toiletries are available. The children also received complimentary fruit plates and yogurt every day, which made the children very happy. The cleaning staff I met were also very qualified. The hotel has its own children's playground. The children and the kids were still entertained after playing all afternoon. The adults chatting in a down-to-earth manner really made us worry a lot. In terms of security, visitors need to register when entering and exiting, and swiping their cards to get on the stairs provides an extra layer of protection. On this cold winter morning, it is really comfortable to go downstairs and have a breakfast with a full range of Chinese and Western dishes that are updated every day.

The hotel's location is within walking distance of Joy City, and it's also convenient to take a taxi. My child loves trains, and I can see the trains entering and exiting Chaoyang Station from the room. It’s really a surprise.

Today we caught up with the first snowfall in Beijing this year. Looking out at the quaint hotel scenery outside the window in the room is really beautiful.

msg:The location is relatively remote, and you often can't take a taxi. I went to the hot spring at night. It costs 218 yuan per person for non-hotel guests and 168 yuan per person for hotel guests. The sanitary conditions are extremely poor. There is a lot of black mold in the bathing area. It is highly not recommended.

The attitude of the service staff at the hotel front desk and the museum consumption area was very bad. Because we were still some time away from departure, we planned to pack our luggage in the public area. After only sitting for 10 minutes, the service staff drove us away again and again. This was the first time we used this table. We were already booked and asked to move to other non-booked tables. The second time the hotel manager understood the service staff and asked us to leave. The reason was that it was a museum consumption area. From the attitude of the hotel management staff to the hotel service staff, we can see their service philosophy: no consumption, no consumption. guest

Very good!
Breakfast: There are many types. It seems that it is the theme of Guizhou cuisine now. I feel that there should be or should not be in the breakfast. Coffee, many kinds of juices, bread, and salads are not bad. It is recommended to add bacon in addition to fried intestines, Western style The variety is more perfect if it is richer!
All in all, during the holidays in Beijing, it was a pleasant surprise to live in a hotel of this level in this location at this price. Thank you for your service and look forward to seeing you next time!

It actually started to be renovated at 8:00 am on Saturday morning, and the noise was so loud that it made it impossible to sleep, and it didn't work to respond to the front desk twice! Say what to repair the carpet! ! The most outrageous thing is that it makes people so noisy that they can't sleep, and it's finished at ten o'clock. How the **** is the time arranged?

The only drawback is that there are two lobbies for check-in or check-out and actual check-in, which are 100 meters apart. But the halls are connected and acceptable. I booked this place because it is convenient to take the train to Beijing Chaoyang Station.

msg:The experience feels very bad, as detailed below.
First of all, it is a good aspect, that is, the service is quite remarkable, and it can answer every question. Then there is a so-called museum display corridor, can this be considered an advantage? In other words, this is a big place, what can you show, if I want to see the exhibition, I can just find a museum? Are many museums in Beijing free? The others are gone.
Then why is it bad. Construction is going on outside the hotel, it's messy, let's not talk about it, even if I went there at an untimely time (can't you remind me that the construction is going on recently?). In this price hotel, there are almost no entertainment and leisure facilities except hot springs. And the hot springs still have to be charged separately, and there are 88 hotel guests. Moreover, the hot springs are completely separated for men and women, and they cannot be with family members. What is the consideration for this design? Then there is the swimming pool in the introduction. This was included in Ctrip’s promotional introduction and even put a picture, but it didn’t. This is not misleading consumption, but deception! No swimming pool at all! Then there is the outdoor lawn or garden or something. I would like to give a big thumbs up to the person who took the promotional pictures, for being able to take such a small place with such an a**osphere. In fact, the small one inside is as big as a palm, and it is in the barbecue restaurant outside the hotel, which is still open to the public. The price is not cheap, and there is no discount for staying in the hotel.
Then there is the room. The size of the Big Mouth Monkey Suite booked is okay, but the layout inside is completely anti-human. The washbasin, washroom, and shower room are designed in the bedroom, right next to the bed, without even a partition made of cloth curtains, so they are completely open. And there is no shelter in the bathroom and toilet, what is going on inside can be clearly seen from the outside, what kind of trouble is this? As for sanitation, there are white floating objects in the kettle, and other places are too lazy to complain.
In a word, none of the environment, facilities, and sanitation of hotels at this price can satisfy people, and there are suspicions of deceiving consumers. I will never go there again! Friends who can read my comments and avoid pitfalls, no thanks, please call me Lei Feng who has been taken advantage of!
I won’t post the photos. The first reason is that there are no environmental photos. The poor conditions of the hotel are nothing worth taking. , Second, there are family members in the other photos, but I just took a photo of the hotel's fountain and name as a commemoration of being taken advantage of. I'm too lazy to type, so I won't post it.

The decoration is very luxurious, and there is a small museum inside. The room card is the design style of the ancient waist card, which is very fresh.
A welcome fruit plate and yogurt were provided upon check-in, and the room was also more comfortable!

Because I brought my own red wine, they also helped me I was given a red wine glass and a wine divider, which couldn’t be more thoughtful!
For all communication before check-in, Miss Wenhui at the front desk answered all questions and was very thoughtful.
As for the check-in experience, the buffet is OK for the guests, and the price/performance ratio is good. However, we didn’t expect there to be so many people when we first arranged it. There was a slight hiccup. We waited in the room for about 15 minutes, and the overall follow-up communication and The services are very good.
Let’s talk about the room. The bathroom configuration is really amazing. It’s almost as big as the room outside. It’s equipped with a super large bathtub. Let alone 2 people, I think it’s okay to bath 4 people. The bathtub can be used for bubbles. Very nice.
The only drawback is that the bed is a bit hard. I am used to sleeping on latex mattresses, so I am still a little uncomfortable with it. I hope that round beds can also have soft mattresses in the future.

msg:The service is really good! Kudos to the staff👍Because my child is taking the college entrance examination at a nearby school, I chose this hotel which is closer to the test center. The guests who stayed in the next room on the second day were quite noisy. After communicating with the staff, they changed the room they were satisfied with as soon as possible. The room was cleaned every day 🧹 There are also yogurt and fruit given every day, I sincerely thank you 🙏

msg:The overall feeling of the hotel is okay. The only thing I want to talk about is the hot springs, the experience, special, not good! First of all, it's called a coupon, but I told me that I need another payment after the soaking...I feel...Is there anything I can't explain in advance? Hidden and tucked will not be enough, although it is only a few dozen yuan. Moreover, the facilities in the hot spring: the water is not hot, and the cabinet cannot be opened if it is locked... I was speechless. I stayed in the hot spring for an hour, but it wasted half an hour. I took a shower and was told to pay. This experience is not good.
The breakfast is better than the taste, and the variety basically meets the needs.
The rooms are on low floors, with a general view, either on the road or in the community.
The transportation is more convenient, and it is very convenient to go to Joy City or nearby to eat, drink and play.

There is also a yellow duck travel care kit in the room, which is great! Not only helped me upgrade the room, but also gave me two free breakfasts. It was really good. There is also a free parking lot in front of the hotel. This is one of the best hotels in Beijing! Next time I come to Beijing, I will continue to live, highly recommended👍👍👍👍👍

At the same time, the front desk can be postponed until 2 pm, which is very good. However, since you are late check-out, you just want to take a break, you should not call at 12 o'clock to confirm whether to continue, and call one by one around two o'clock. When staying at Sofitel, you can postpone it until 4 o'clock. Understand that service personnel act in accordance with the regulations, it should be a matter of rules and regulations, and hope to improve management rules.

孩子之前沒看過小黃人，正好這家有小黃人的家庭親子房。結果要小童用品的時候，被告知並不是家庭親子房，而是家庭房，所以不提供小童浴衣，但拖鞋和小童洗漱用品都提供了。建議將攜程上的名稱寫明白，或者內部服務人員統一一下。
孩子害怕小黃人，所以我把玩偶放櫃子裏了。😄

msg:호텔 앞에 공사를 하기 때문에 교통의 불편함이 조금 있었습니다. 하지만 호텔 문 앞의 주차요원이 굉장히 친절했습니다. 


호텔 방의 상태는 보통입니다. 욕조 청소에 신경을 써줬으면 합니다. 욕조에 물때가….
직원들은 대부분 친절했습니다 하지만 외출 후 돌아왔을때 health kit을 체크하는 직원의 태도에 너무 놀랐습니다. 투숙 중이라고 말하고 방의 키를 보여줬슴에도 직원이 로비 중간에서 투숙객을 잡고 방번호와 투숙객의 이름을 물어봤는데 그 태도가 불쾌했습니다. 남성 직원이 와서 일을 잘 해결해주긴했는데 기분 좋지 않은 경험이였습니다. 

저녁은 호텔의 해산물 뷔페를 이용했습니다. 
해산물이 신선하고 직원들이 매우 친절합니다. 다녀온 사람들의 후기 사진속에는 사케 병과 잔이 있어서 기대했지만 정말 사케 “병과 잔”만 있고 사케는 없었습니다. 

아침 조식 뷔페는 중국식 아침 식사가 포인트 인것 같습니다. 
중국식 아침식사의 모든 종류가 있어서 맛있게 먹었습니다. 
빵과 시리얼은 기본적인 것들만 있습니다.
