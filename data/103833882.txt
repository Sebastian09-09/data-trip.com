We felt completely at home in the rooms and especially in the beautifully landscaped garden. If you want to explore the area around Huangshan and especially the fantastic Yellow Mountains, this hotel is an excellent base.

msg:My child came to Xixinan for study. I didn't know this place before. The scenery and natural landscape are really suitable for rest. At present, it is not very commercialized. I looked at several hotels and homestays, and finally chose Manyuan. I feel that it is worth the money. First, the hotel has a strong sense of design. Although the overall area is not very large, I feel very good about both the garden and the lobby. Second, the service is in place. Because the children are not studying together, I always trouble the hotel to ferry them in the village. The attentive service of the master and the housekeeper is meticulous and makes people feel cordial. Third, I personally feel that the hotel's breakfast is very special. I have stayed in some hotels and homestays, but this is the first time I have stayed in this model. They will try their best to meet personal needs, and the types can also be matched with meat and vegetables. Fourth, the hotel has a cat named Yuanbao, who has a good personality and the children like it very much! In short, it is a very good experience.

msg:🌄Green Leaf Wonderland Stay in a secluded B&B in the ancient village of Huangshan, Anhui

🍃Peach blossoms and flowing water disappear
There is a world beyond the human world🐈

🌳Huangshan, Anhui, has been a place of yearning for literati and poets since ancient times. There are spectacular mountains, quiet ancient villages and unique cultural heritage. And now, there are some amazing high-end B&Bs hidden here, making you feel like traveling back to ancient times and feeling the simplicity and tranquility.

🏠#漫园见山 is such an intoxicating place. 🌟When I stepped into here, it was like walking into a paradise. 🎉Antique buildings and carefully arranged courtyards, each exuding a strong cultural a**osphere.
Every detail of the B&B shows the taste of the owner.
Fresh fruits and exquisite snacks are delivered to the room every day.
The decoration style combines classic Huizhou architecture and logs.
The guest room where I stayed with my girlfriend this time is called #隐麓#漫园见山.
It was transformed from an ancient private school.
Blue bricks, white walls, gray tiles, logs...
As the owner of the B&B said, wood🪵 has memory.
The texture and annual rings of wood not only record the changes of the times, but also bring us the power and warmth of the vicissitudes of that era from the most natural artists.

Exquisite furniture and comfortable beds make people sleep well all night. 😴Wake up in the morning, open the window, and the fresh air hits you. The mountains in the distance are looming in the clouds, like a beautiful painting.

Go out to the well-preserved ancient village that has not been developed.
🤩Here, you can let go of fatigue and stress and enjoy the beauty of nature. 🌸Walk along the stone road of the ancient village, feeling the traces of time; or sit in the courtyard,
chat with friends
sunbathe, drink tea, pet cats🐱
temporarily escape from the hustle and bustle of the world
get close to and talk with nature
the comfort of life is just like this

msg:All kinds of satisfaction, see the above comments. A little suggestion: In addition to the dehumidifier in the windowless room, it is better to have an air purifier for guests to choose. The twin room was transferred from the king-size room. Because there is no window, there is still a little decoration smell that cannot be dissipated. The flaws do not outweigh the merits. Other aspects are still in place. Thank you for the careful hospitality of all the ladies. I will come again if I have the chance.

Whether we sit outside or inside, we will be served a cup of black tea, which feels very warm. The breakfast is good, the wontons are delicious, and it would be better if black tea and coffee were available. Maybe because the lowest room type was booked, the room was cramped and not comfortable enough, the tung oil smell was a bit heavy, and the Xiaomi smart toilet experience was not good. It is recommended to book a higher level room type for a better experience.

msg:The design of Manyuanjianshan B&B is ingenious and has a unique charm, especially the small and exquisite garden. As night falls, sitting alone in the courtyard, the light of the red lanterns full of the flavor of the New Year shines on the pink wall covered with creepers and traces of time. The fragrant garden is quiet, the crescent moon is like a hook, and the fragrance of plum blossoms is faint. Two kittens, one white and one black, run around on the mossy blue brick ground, moving very quietly, forgetting countless things in the world.
I like to make a pot of tea in the morning, and mineral water is generally available in hotels. I wanted 3 bottles of mineral water, but the girl said that there were only two bottles of Nongfu Spring at the front desk.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels and B&Bs, and I have always had high requirements for hotels and B&Bs. I will seriously comment on the hotels and B&Bs that I am particularly satisfied with. This is a very surprising B&B. It is located in an old house in Xixinan. It can be seen that the owner has spent a lot of time decorating it. The daily set breakfast is both filling and delicious. The fruits in the room every day are also very high-quality. The cherries are quite large and at least 3j in size. They taste very sweet. The waiters are also very simple and polite, and the store manager is very elegant. Especially on the day of check-in, my eldest child may have had a stomachache outside at night, causing vomiting in the middle of the night, and the sheets and quilts were all dirty. The next day, I told the housekeeper to change the sheets and bed covers. If they cannot be cleaned and need to be thrown away, I am willing to compensate, but they are very considerate and did not do so. They asked the children many times whether they were well, which made us feel warm and kind. The souvenirs given at check-out can also be seen to be thoughtful. There are various cakes and special beautiful chargers in the bamboo handbag. In short, this B&B is highly recommended. If you go to Xixinan, choose it!

Three or two friends gathered here in the most beautiful late autumn season in southern Anhui. They walked in the gardens, talked and laughed by the water, sipped wine under the tomatoes, and looked very happy. Although I stayed in Manyuan for a short time, I saw the mountain in my heart. The food is satisfactory, the room is well-equipped, the bedding is comfortable, and the service is excellent. If I hadn't booked the next trip, I would really like to stay longer. ps, being able to enjoy grilled steak, grilled durian, grilled sweet potatoes and plum wine from a classy, ​​talented and hospitable owner should be the best perk of staying in a hotel so far!

Every aspect of the hotel reflects the designer's ingenuity, maintaining the characteristics of the original Huizhou architecture and incorporating modern design concepts.

I had doubts when I booked it, and I was very reluctant to leave when I checked out. I regretted that I should have stayed a few more days.
It was a very enjoyable stay, comfortable and leisurely, the Hui-style buildings were quaint, and the hotel was very attentive to the small details. The service was also great, and it was a good place for a slow holiday.

msg:This is another B&B that you won’t want to leave once you stay.

It just opened on New Year's Day this year and is located in Xixi Nan Ancient Village, which has not yet been over-developed. The a**osphere of the surrounding residential buildings is very good, the villagers are happy and comfortable, and there are not many tourists during the peak season.

The B&B has a large space, strong privacy and full sense of design. I particularly like the garden here. You can read a book and drink coffee in the courtyard, listening to the chirping of birds and the flowing water. You can have an ideal vacation without going out.

The breakfast is super rich. If you eat later, you can basically save lunch. I recommend the private afternoon tea in the store, which is delicious.

Finally, I had to express my love for the two shop cats "Huajiao" and "Like", which gave the senior cat slaves too many happy moments and made the scenery in front of them more lively and beautiful. ❤️

Every corner of the entire B&B is very charming, the room is very clean, and the housekeeper can be contacted at any time, which is very convenient. , there are welcome fruits in the room🍇all very fresh.

In addition, I would like to express my gratitude to our housekeeper Xiao Liu. My father likes the pickled mustard here at breakfast. The housekeeper Xiao Liu said that he would pack a copy for you before you leave. Before we left, we forgot about the pickled mustard. She packed the pickled mustard for my dad during breakfast. We were all very satisfied with her attentiveness👍🏼The breakfast at the B&B was made with reasonable ingredients and fresh ingredients, one serving per person The amount is enough to fill you up haha😄The streams around the B&B are very pristine and have not been over-exploited. You can take your children to catch small fish and shrimps and play by the stream.

Just sit in the lobby A waiter will bring you a cup of hot tea, and when you go for a walk in the evening, a lady will bring you a flashlight. The mattresses and bedding are far superior to other five-star hotels, especially the garden landscape of this B&B is amazing! In the pavilion in the garden, you can listen to the beautiful wind chimes and enjoy the garden scenery without even wanting to go out! In addition, the dinner cooked by the Cantonese lady in the restaurant is even more delicious! Full of color and flavor! In fact, you don’t even have to go out to eat! This is a B&B that I have been to and hope to go to again. Thank you to the B&B staff for their warm hospitality. I wish you a prosperous business!

msg:非常滿意的一次住宿呢！首先是民宿的設計非常有品，無論是細節還是整體，堪比很多五星級了。入院很有回家的感覺，大堂又無比寬敞舒適，庭院也非常有感覺，娃來這裏的一整天幾乎都在這兒玩，其次是人，無論是老闆娘還是管家甚至其他員工，主打一個熱情、親切，是很真誠的那種，還幫忙看娃（真是太感動了555555），服務也非常好。再説説吃的，我們在這裏用了晚餐和早餐，廚藝水平是得到我老媽的認可的（長者家會比較挑），早餐很豐富，營養全面。總之是一個非常令人滿意的民宿啦！大家有機會一定要來呀！

房間有木頭潮濕的氣味，兩扇窗一扇對着走廊，一扇對着街道，清晨不時有人聲和電瓶車經過，有些影響睡眠，民宿裏散步，應該是入住“隱廬”那間房才能更好的感受庭院深宅的幽靜古雅。
西溪南村子可賞玩的地方不多，村口濕地與徽州其他風景比起來略顯遜色。

我是一個古建改酒店愛好者，國內外都更喜歡住類似酒店。但這個隱藏在小村落的民宿，刷新了我對這類酒店的認知（今後也會提高我對這類酒店的期望閾值）。
環境：這家酒店是一傢俬塾改建，是西溪南村裡最好的民宿，也是整個村莊風景最好的點。大堂典雅古樸且極富設計感，房間內備品都是非常棒的，配有voss的水，且後續水不限量（後續配黃山無極雪），最令人驚訝的是，酒店裡綠植遍地，還有小塘，蚊子卻不多。民宿到處是美學方面的書，可見老闆當時對營造下了功夫。
服務：服務比很多奢華酒店還要好，工作人員非常盡責，幫助我們在涼亭用了下午茶和晚餐，並隨時有熱茶奉上，接駁司機、前台及管家小哥哥小姐姐和保潔大姐，都熱情有禮，面帶微笑，感謝你們給了我和母親美好的一天，西溪南村因為有你們更美麗。

交通很便利，從動車站到黃山北，酒店安排了接駁車，幾分鐘就到了，從民宿順着小溪就能走去西溪南著名打卡景點木橋，三餐我都在民宿裏解決的，好吃😋

一池煙水綠，
半蔭覆蒼苔。
簾外瀝瀝雨，

某總親自為我們煮茶焚香，一物一什添古雅，一器一具生幽韻，雍雍穆穆，心生歡喜。 ​​​還有可愛的東梅妹妹，非常親切，一瞬間有了家的温暖～還有還有，可愛的藍貓寶貝們，期待下一次再見面～

msg:很幸運，一家人的旅行選擇入住蔓園。走過西溪南村邊的石板橋和綠野仙蹤的清涼，深藏在徽派古村落的蔓園，入口處有日式庭院的精緻之美，大廳處處彰顯徽派建築之美，每一處休閑區都可以感受到主人的用心和審美。

火車上跟管家提前預訂了土雞湯，臭鱖魚，鹹肉燒筍，味道極好，飯後吧枱一杯咖啡滿口留香。花椒和喜歡是店裡兩衹貓咪，神氣又安靜。入住正直雨天，坐在庭院裏聽雨，擼貓。管家服務非常貼心，第二晚免費升級了房間，非常好的入住體驗。

msg:名宿的設計方面介紹的蠻多的，但是明明交代了需要到店用餐到了説不能做了，有些失望，畢竟旅遊的其中一項就是品嚐當地特色。新開的民宿衞生方面還是很好的，一些細節需要加強，下水問題希望改善，確實影響入住體驗。服務意識還是需要注意的，畢竟再好的設計理念也不能代替親切到位的服務。
