It’s enabled myself and fellow travellers easy and rapid access to the adjacent Hongqiao Railway Hub for our onward journeys. The rooms are large, attractive, clean and very well set out. I’m sure we will be coming back again on future trips to Shanghai and beyond.

I stayed in room 739, the view is great, you can see the whole Hongqiao station scene, new buildings are being built, traffic lights flashing and workers walking around, subway train running and the aircraft takeoff every 5 minutes,or maybe 10 minutes, I didn’t count. It’s really interesting when this all worked together and it’s a magnificent view.

Karen at the front desk was very attentive to our needs, she noted we were celebrating our anniversary and arranged for a fruit platter and Anniversary cake to be sent to our room.  Any issues or requests we had were dealt with promptly and professionally, we had nothing but top tier service.  The rooms are well laid out and very comfortable.  Karen also noted we had a lot of luggage and so arranged for staff to help with our luggage all the way to Hongqiao Railway Station - an 8 minute walk  A complementary continental breakfast was also provided for those guests doing who checkout before the restaurants open.  The top floor lounge was closed due to CoVid, our only disappointment.  All in all a very enjoyable stay.  Highly recommended!

The only downside was my train was super early so I couldn’t stay long in the hotel restaurant for breakfast which was really good and lots of selections.

First of all, the hotel's location is very convenient, close to Hongqiao Airport and train station, making traveling very convenient. There are shopping malls and restaurants nearby, which met my various needs.
The hotel rooms are very spacious and comfortable, with simple and stylish decoration. The bed was very comfortable and had a great sleep. The room facilities are also very complete, and the small refrigerator has a variety of drinks and beer which is very convenient.
The breakfast is very rich, with a wide variety and tastes very good. There are Chinese and Western options, and it's really nice to have a good breakfast every morning.
What impressed me most was the service of the hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly, always greeting guests with a smile. In particular, Doris, the administrative floor manager of Cordis Hotel, has a very kind and cordial tone, whispers in a low voice, and is responsive to all my requests. Whether during check-in or check-out, she is very patient in answering my questions and providing help.
Overall, Cordis Shanghai Hongqiao is a very good hotel. Great location, comfortable rooms, rich breakfast, and excellent service. I am personally very satisfied!

Disadvantages: I called the service center and asked the hotel to declare the services provided. I felt that it was very pushy. I would rather trouble the guests than the colleagues.

msg:The location is very convenient. It’s only a five-minute walk from Hongqiao Station, and you don’t have to leave the ground. If you need to consider this relationship, it is highly recommended.
The room is very spacious, but the facilities are a little bit old. The plug on the washbasin has fallen off, and there is a smell of smoke when you first enter the room. It feels like the fresh air system is old.
The breakfast is average, nothing particularly good, and the price is not in line with the price of more than 200 per serving.
This housing price is more of a payment for the location.

Service: The hotel staff’s service is pretty good

However, there is a smell when you come in. It doesn't feel good. It's a kind of stench. Close the windows immediately. The opening is a little better. The hotel facilities are complete.

The first time I felt that the hygiene was so-so and there were stains on the floor, it was acceptable, but maybe I was too sleepy and didn't pay attention. Because I was in a hurry, I didn't take a shower. The second time I came back for breakfast and service, there were stains on the floor. The shower room actually leaked. After washing, the bathroom was full of water. This must have been the case for a long time. The carpet on the side had turned black and the bathroom door was moldy.

Not informed at all. In the middle of the process, I called to inquire and asked to check if it had been delivered, but there was no call back to let me know. After waiting for another ten minutes, I couldn't wait any longer and went to get it, which was completely left at the front desk. This kind of service is worse than no service at all.

First let me talk about the location of the hotel. It is a few hundred meters away from the departure level and takes more than five minutes to walk there. It is very convenient.

And the environment is considered luxurious! The mini bar in the room is not free, so you have to decide at your own discretion. And if you order takeout while staying here, it cannot be delivered. You have to pick up the food from the takeout counter downstairs!

But in fact, its rooms are not as good as some good mid-range hotels. They are too small and the products are poor. It was terrible, the bed was uncomfortable, the curtains were crumpled, and nothing good except the location.
Breakfast bar, I can say that it is basically OK, but the sanitation feels unclean. I went to scoop up the porridge and found a long hair on the bowl. After a long time, the waiter didn't deal with it. When I went to get things for the second time, I saw that it was still there There, I took the initiative to remind the waiter and said: "Look, get rid of it quickly", and the waiter went to deal with it.

Buying breakfast alone costs more than 200, and there are few varieties, which is very uneconomical. Robots are used to deliver things, but the robots are very unintelligent. They open the door slowly and have to wait for the robot to return to the base station before re-delivering. Except for Eric, the front desk clerk when we checked in on the first night, who saw that we arrived too late and gave us some help, the service staff we met later were very arrogant and I do not recommend everyone to stay there. I switched to Crown on the third day. The hotel price, hardware facilities, and service attitude were much better than Cordis.

The air conditioner in the elevator is reluctant to turn on, and the software level that does not match the specifications of the hardware facilities is displayed everywhere. Originally, I only wanted to give it one star, but the sunrise is really shocking. One more star will be given to this glorious sunrise scenery. The only thing worth noting is the gift from God. By the way, there are relatively few people in the executive lounge and breakfast. If you don’t mind the cleanliness of the room, other aspects are actually ok.

msg:The service is really bad. I don’t know how to get five stars. The fruit was left in the refrigerator and spoiled overnight. The hotel explained that our refrigerator does not keep fresh. Is the refrigerator a decoration? The key point is that the attitude is very bad. I am speechless. Since there is no deposit, the laundry will not be delivered. You must call yourself and pay for it before delivery. It is difficult to understand whether your laundry fee is more expensive or the clothes are more expensive. Purely. There is no sense of trust at all, and it is extremely expensive. The price is not reasonable. The breakfast variety is pitiful, worse than a business chain hotel, really rubbish

msg:I have stayed in various hotels all the year round due to work reasons, and I have always been the silent majority and never gave bad reviews. But today I was really annoyed by the arrogant male operator of this hotel. The hotel's location and facilities are very good, but what is unexpected is that a male service staff at the front desk has such a poor service attitude and is very arrogant when talking to guests. The booked hotel checks out at 2:00, but the male receptionist told us with certainty that all the rooms in this hotel are checked out at 12:00, as a front desk employee, he can be serious when he comes into contact with this job every day The lie, the most important thing is that the attitude is very arrogant, do not understand our whole journey, hello, thank you, what happened to arouse his arrogance? (Maybe he is the noble 310?) But we could only swallow our anger. As a result, we ordered a cup of coffee and delivered it to the front desk. The front desk employee not only did not respond within half an hour, when we called the front desk At that time, he actually proposed to sign a food safety agreement with us. His attitude was unbelievable. If it was because of safety reasons, you can send it to the waiter. If your waiter is busy, you can call to inform us, but they didn’t do anything. , but after the customer called them for more than half an hour, he still told you from above and told us that he must sign a guarantee agreement before delivering it to us. So what is the point of such a delivery? Such a good hotel hardware, but there are such waiters, one piece of **** ruined a pot of porridge. It really makes the investors of your hotel complain.

Hygiene: The cleaning staff is very hardworking, and there is a cleaning button at the door, which is very convenient for tenants who do not want to be cleaned in the room.
I hope to change the independent shower head to a fixed one, otherwise I will be a little scared.
The trash can under the sink is well hidden but it is inconvenient to throw away, you have to bend over every time.
The bathtub is a bit dirty, and there will be some floating objects such as dust when the water is put in for the first time. It is a bit uncomfortable when there is a light and you can see the shadow.


Environment: The environment is very good, the traffic is very, very, very convenient, you can directly reach the hotel regardless of the weather, which is very good.
Whether it is very close to the subway or the train station, it is very convenient. There are many shops in the surrounding business district, and you can meet the needs of shopping by just strolling around.


Service: great! ! Treat people politely, and meet their needs very quickly, impeccable.

Breakfast was also funny. The waiter at the noodle place was like a deaf person. He told them to cook a bowl of noodles, but no one listened to him several times. He just focused on chatting away, which made him feel so bad that he didn't eat at all.
A so-called five-star hotel must have five-star service. Employees of all qualities can be there, but they will only throw stones at their own sign. Anyway, I will not stay in this hotel in the future. Comrades, please use your discretion.

Thank you to the elegant and enthusiastic lady who helped check in at 9 o'clock on October 8th! !
In fact, I stayed here once before the epidemic. This time, I felt that the service and facility maintenance were more complete. The room was clean and fresh, the big bed was comfortable, and the pillows in particular were the most comfortable I have ever used.
The location of the hotel is unique. It only takes about five minutes to walk downstairs and take the indoor passage to the high-speed rail waiting room! Hongqiao Airport and the subway are very close and convenient. It is definitely the best choice for connecting flights or high-speed rail!
Thank you to the hotel front desk staff!

I stayed on the executive floor for nearly 2,000 yuan a night, and the waiter wouldn’t deliver the food I ordered, even if there was a robot! There is a so-called takeaway cabinet placed outside the hotel. Because the clothes were washed at night, I repeatedly said that I had no choice but to go out of the hotel to pick them up. I hoped that the hotel would even bring them in and put them at the front desk. The hotel offered various excuses. At one time, they said that the robot would bump and spill. At another time, they said that for the sake of food safety, no. Any assistance given to deal with hotel regulations is also plausible. I don’t know what your regulations are based on? Is this kind of hotel service just for your own convenience? Why do you charge such an expensive room rate? ! Cordis Shanghai Hongqiao, since you are so confident, I will promote your "special" services in every order review! Bad review! Bad review! Bad review~! ~!

msg:Those who drive out to do business and visit friends choose Cordis Hongqiao for three reasons:
1⃣️My previous colleagues here made me feel at ease about Cordis’s service. Indeed, the team led by Doris is still professional👍Sister Molly is very caring, her voice is soft and sweet, and girls who love to laugh will definitely be lucky~
2⃣️The location is excellent. It is convenient to the high-speed rail subway station at the Hongqiao hub. It is also very convenient to travel and visit friends by subway line 2 and 10, and it is also very convenient for shopping. But this time I drove here and found that the parking sign was not very conspicuous. Since the underground parking garage is shared with the business district, we spent a long time in the underground parking garage. Fortunately, the theme color "orange" of Cordis is conspicuous enough, but This is based on the premise of my understanding of Cordis. But it seems that it may not be so friendly to the guests who visit for the first time. Does this reflect from the side that the concierge still needs to be improved?
3⃣️The Chinese restaurant Ming Court, because I need to entertain friends, Ming Court is my best choice. I am very grateful to Bruce for maintaining his love for hotel catering and insisting on what I failed to persist. The dishes are still excellent. The crispy chicken, pomegranate fruit, grouper soup, and bamboo shredded chicken fried rice are all great. At the same time, the chef team is also very good at keeping up with the trend. The cod tofu "flower head" is also very good, "booming" The implication is great. At the same time, in the selection of tea sets, as well as the hand sanitizer and body lotion in the bathroom, we can see the team's intentions. Crystal also left a good impression on me~

When I come to Shanghai later, Cordis Hongqiao will still be my first choice, as it feels like going home, and the experience is always the same. Finally, the friends of ADD are also very loving, thanks to Louis, Soren, and Rita for their service ~ keep going. I believe that little girl Rita will also pass on the opinions I have given to the team leader~

The caller said that the hotel did not provide takeout service. I asked what the rules were? Speaking of the beginning of this month, I just stayed for a few days on the 16th of this month, and all the takeout was delivered. Although it was very ink, it was delivered! ! ! When I answered the phone, I couldn't explain clearly and then someone else answered the phone. The "new rules" came right out of the mouth. If I hadn't happened to live there, would I have been deceived? I had no choice but to follow the rules and go down to the front desk to get it myself. But I was told that if the customer is tough and for the sake of customer experience, I can still give it away! ! Is not this nonsensical? This is it, there is a gross customer experience! Blacklist! !

This time, due to the upset in Shanghai and the Spring Festival holiday, I didn’t want to stay at home, so I invited my girlfriends to stay in a hotel. Of course, Cordis was the first choice. She also likes Kandis and plans to bring her family to live for a few days.
This time it was leo who arranged the room, and his attitude was very good. Check-out is at the executive lounge on the 11th floor. I met Joy, whom I met for the first time. She also has a very good attitude. When guests come, they are greeted immediately, and when they leave, they are delivered to the door. Will often come here to stay.

The lady at the front desk was really considerate when I checked in. I saw that I brought my children and specially gave me a 1.4-meter twin room. When I checked out, I knew I needed it and delayed it until 3 o'clock. It was really heartwarming~
The bed is still so comfortable, I still had Shanghai pot stickers for breakfast, and I didn’t eat Xiaolongbao when I got up late today~
When I went to have breakfast today, I was stopped and said that my room only had a single breakfast. It was so embarrassing. I said that I booked an executive room with double breakfast. My brother called the front desk to confirm that it was indeed a double breakfast... It was embarrassing to stand at the door of the restaurant, but luckily it was late Not many people passed by, can we not do this next time, it feels like I deliberately came to cheat someone for breakfast.

I will still choose this restaurant next time I come to Shanghai. In addition, I have a small suggestion. The last few times I stayed here, the 1865 members did not receive a welcome gift. I wonder if it is too busy. I hope to see it next time, and I will continue to support your hotel in the future.

The hotel swimming pool is also relatively small, with a depth of only 1.15 meters, but there are many rest seats by the pool. I don't know what the design concept is.
Also, the service is unsatisfactory. First of all, when we arrived at the hotel, no one stepped forward to help with our luggage. The doorman stood at the door and turned a blind eye. When I left, I took a taxi with my baby and my luggage in the rain, but the doorman didn't allow the car to stop at the hotel entrance, which was unbelievable.
Second, ask at breakfast if you can provide a plate of sesame oil to season the bean curd. A person who looks like a chef actually said that the hotel only has chili oil.
Third, the bathroom mouthwash cup will break if touched. I called the service center at eight o'clock in the morning to ask for a replacement mouthwash cup and clean up the debris. I also needed a set of shaving kits. I was told that the housekeeping depar**ent would not be open until 8:30. Do you have to wait until housekeeping to brush your teeth and shave? The debris was not cleaned up during the period. If you accidentally get injured, will the hotel be responsible? On the same day, we returned to the room after breakfast (about 9:30) and lunch break (about 1:30 pm) and did not come to clean the room. The room was not cleaned until 4:00 pm, but the shaving tools were still not delivered. The shaving kits came after another call to service at night.
In short, this kind of service is not good for the price, and I will not stay here again, and the Langham Group is also disappointed.

Recently, the most familiar front desk manager has left, and I can't bear it~
Still give the hotel a suggestion, that is, the bathroom door and the toilet door should really have a "push" and "pull" slogan... The big glass is really duangduang, especially for guests who are not familiar with the hotel
In addition, the breakfast is not rich enough. I am not good at eating Western-style breakfast, so I only eat that ramen recently. It’s really good

msg:As a five-star hotel, there is no professionalism in the front hall when checking in, and the service attitude is very poor. An arrogant attitude asks the customer if you want dental equipment! Asked if I was staying for the first time, I answered yes. There is no passenger elevator to guide, and the big bed business package booked on Ctrip includes a 200 yuan voucher. The front desk does not explain. When asked, he directly said that you are going to order food on the G floor, and told them directly. She meant it as if you were going to be prepared to use the voucher to get a lot of money off the hotel. The room ordering was available at first, but later said it could not be used. After communicating with Ctrip, the meal was delivered to the room and said it was available. An egg fried rice and salad, you can't eat it after reading it. The delivery Jack said that if you are not satisfied with this egg fried rice, I will ask the chef to make it again. Well, after the second egg fried rice comes. Comparing them all makes people speechless. I just want to express that Cordis Hongqiao asks you to treat every consumer well and serve with heart. Don't treat your customers as fools, and your brand will get worse after all.

msg:I have stayed in many five-star and above luxury hotels at home and abroad, and this is the second time I have given a bad review to a hotel on Ctrip. I just want to ask this hotel with such a high score. I wonder if the boss has invited a lot of Internet celebrities to score points. A five-star hotel? I think the environment is similar to Home Inn, and even the details are not as good. First of all, the tone of the security guard who entered the lobby is also simple. 2 As soon as I entered the room, it was fine. When I put down my luggage and prepared to take a shower, my God, the details were gone. The bathroom was rusty and stained. Bedding and sofa supplies are even cheaper, and even feel like street goods. How did you get your five-star rating? Isn't there an industry standard? How much did it cost to buy five stars? The only advantage is that it is close to Hongqiao Railway Station. There are no other advantages. There are still a lot of people who haven't taken pictures... I really can't take pictures anymore... I hope the businessmen do business with honesty

msg:There should be something wrong with the management's service concept in this hotel. I never commented on the quality of the hotel I stayed in before, but I couldn't help it this time. It is impossible to downgrade the customer's room without saying hello when checking in at any hotel. I booked the area. I was given a 41-square-meter double room with a bed width of 1.8 meters. I was given a room with an area of ​​less than 30 square meters and a bed width of less than 1.5 meters. When I checked in, I was told that there were no other rooms. The key is that you downgrade and tell me clearly. Don’t lie. Tell me this room is good and close to the elevator. Am I stupid? The room was noisy and small. Two hours after I made the complaint, they told me that I could change the room. Why did I do it so early? Is there anyone who deceives customers like this? The key is that I went to bed because I was too tired. I fell asleep in a daze for more than an hour. I was woken up by a phone call and asked to change rooms. I asked you to get up halfway and try to change rooms. This hotel has no regard for the feelings of its customers. Last year, I often stayed here during the epidemic. The salesperson told me that it would be cheaper to sign a long-term agreement for me. As a result, the agreement price I signed has always been much more expensive than the price in the store and Ctrip. This year, the epidemic is relaxed, and I want to renew the previous agreement price, and told me that the price will increase. As a result, the price quoted was still much more expensive than the existing stores and Ctrip. A hotel that deceives customers, puts money first, and does not pay attention to the stay experience. I am speechless. I feel that there is a big problem with the business and service concept of this hotel. I bid farewell to this hotel. . I hope the leadership of this store will take it seriously.

The most unbearable thing is that the switch of the shower is super difficult to use. If there is foam on the hand, it cannot be turned at all.
The water in the pool is not deep, so you can safely throw your child in it. The dressing room has a reasonable layout and the facilities provided are also very user-friendly, which is highly praised.
The coffee in the executive lounge is much better than the breakfast downstairs, and PANNA mineral water can also be drunk casually.
Overall, the hotel is very good, will stay again next time.

Room 517 should go and see for yourself. Third, my stay cost a total of 3K and I had to pay for two invoices. When the second invoice was issued, the hotel front desk lady said that the responsibility was mine and that I did not explain the situation. I paid for 2 rooms on Ctrip in one order and extended my stay in another room. Two payments in total. I can tolerate the fact that you missed an order for the first time. The second time, do you issue invoices based on rooms? He also said that it was the guest's fault that he didn't make it clear. You at the front desk are playing with your cell phone without looking at the guests. You have surveillance cameras to check it yourself. This is the last time I stayed here. Disgusting BTW. Very little choice for breakfast.

1. After checking in, there wasn’t even a bathroom in the room. I asked him to send it to me and insisted that there was one in the room. He said that my guest couldn’t see it? ? If you put an empty box there, I wouldn't be able to see it? ? Is there any paper inside? What's the use of lying to you? ?
2. I ordered a takeaway. Although there was a robot, I was not allowed to deliver it. It was so cold at night and I had to go outside to get it by myself. The front desk said that the robot would not deliver anything that would pose a safety risk to the hotel. I'm really convinced. What's the danger in taking out food? ? Get a bomb to blow you up? ?
3. The TV suddenly turned on automatically in the middle of the night and made a loud sound, which woke us up. I live next to the train station just so I can sleep a little longer. This resulted in me not sleeping well at all.
4. Maybe because it is close to the train station, there is no shortage of customers, so I don’t pay attention to the customer situation at all. If you choose this place because it is close to the train station, you should give it more thought. The service and environment are too bad.

Breakfast is a fairly simple buffet style, but has everything you need.
Not only the pool on the top floor, but also the view of planes taking off and landing from the room was the best entertainment.

Fairy Doris provided convenient and high-quality services, and patiently told me some policies and changes. The concierge also helped to introduce the surrounding area and the route to the high-speed rail, and gave directions all the way. Isolation is not separated from love.

Let me first say that when I checked in, it was overcrowded and no one was there to receive me. I asked if I could deliver food and said that there were no people or robots, and food safety was blah blah, and then no one guided the elevator after checking in. When I got to the room, I found that there was not enough water. I went downstairs and asked for two bottles of water. There was no response for 30 minutes. I called again and asked me to wait because there were too many people. I got angry and said that I will deliver it to you now, but when it was delivered, it was found to be a robot. Then I want to ask, did you lie to customers by saying that there are no hands and no robots? What are you doing if you don't receive a deposit refund 24 hours after check-out. I have booked so many four- and five-star hotels and have never given a bad review for the first time. I even want to complain about this hotel on the Internet. There is no business in doing so.

msg:On the night of January 31, 2022, Cordis Hotel directly caused the death of guests while taking a bath in the bathtub due to hotel management omissions and hidden dangers of hotel bathroom faucets! ! !
  The night of the incident was New Year's Eve, and the front desk of Cordis Hotel was only equipped with one person on duty to answer two calls. The person was a little hypoxic while taking a bath and his consciousness was a little fuzzy. The line is connected and busy; about 10 minutes after the family members rushed out of the door to ask for help, the staff on duty came one after another; what was even more outrageous was that after the four staff on duty arrived in the room, although they found the person sitting in the hot water in the bathtub, they actually The client was not rescued from the bathtub full of scalding water in time as requested by the family. Instead, the family was informed that the hotel staff could not move and would have to wait for 120 hours. After more than 120 minutes, after 120 arrived, the person had been soaked in hot water for more than 50 minutes before and after, and 120 was declared dead at the scene. Afterwards, the forensic doctor identified it as cardiac arrest not caused by disease. The person was soaked in hot water for a long time. More than 85% of the skin is burnt, peeling off, bleeding and organ burns! ! !
  As a family member of the person concerned, after the incident, he endured his grief and contacted the hotel several times within a month, but the hotel has been evading relevant responsibilities. At this stage, he has begun to play Tai Chi! ! As a high-end hotel, its management loopholes and industry ethics are really outrageous! ! !

1) The hotel was not rescued in time, the emergency response mechanism was lacking, the safety emergency system on the day was invalid, and the safety protection obligation for the hotel guests was not fulfilled: The hotel had two telephone lines on the New Year’s Eve, and the front desk was only equipped with one phone due to lack of manpower. A person on duty, it took 5-10 minutes to call the front desk from the room that night, but the front desk of the hotel was busy all the way, no one answered all the way, and failed to receive the emergency call from the party's room during the golden rescue time. Due to lack of manpower and loopholes in telephone lines, failing to fulfill the obligation to ensure the safety of hotel guests;
2) The hotel's inaction on the scene of rescue directly led to the deterioration of the physical condition of the parties: After the hotel staff arrived at the scene, they did not carry out the rescue action in time, especially when four staff members were present, and the water was known to be scalding. , did not take the client out of the hot tub immediately, and after the client's family members repeatedly requested or even begged, a hotel staff clearly informed them that they could not do anything, and they had to wait for 120 to arrive at the scene, during which about ten minutes , and did not take timely rescue measures on the spot, stifling the chance of survival of the parties involved. 120 After arriving at the scene, the person involved not only lost his breathing and heartbeat, but also had extensive skin shedding and bleeding and burns to his organs at this time;
3) There are hidden dangers in hotel facilities, failing to fulfill the obligation to ensure the safety of hotel guests:
• There are no hot and cold water marks on the faucet and the water temperature is abnormal: The two faucets in the hotel room do not have any hot and cold water marks visible to the naked eye, which is a safety hazard; especially when adding water when taking a bath, the hotel's cold and hot water When all of them are turned on to the maximum, the water that comes out is still hot water. It can be speculated that the person involved was unknowingly burned by hot water during the process of adding water that night, and induced other diseases and caused coma.
• The bathtub is too deep and there are no handles on both sides, and no emergency safety button on the side of the bathtub: The bathtub is square, with a deep bottom, 50-60cm deep, but there are no handrails on both sides of the bathtub to grab, and there is no support, it is easy for people to slip off, there are The safety hazard of drowning, the person cannot have a support point to support his body after being in a coma due to hypoxia, resulting in slipping into the bathtub;

From the moment I booked the hotel, I was recognized by the service attitude of their front desk Karen, and then I brought the elderly at home. Just checked in, the old man's documents happened to have some problems, but Karen took the trouble to show the old man's documents through the mobile phone, and got all the old man's documents.
       During the stay, Karen has been asking about our housing experience. He is very professional and polite. After staying for one night, there was an episode, because the old man had some allergic constitution. After one night, there were traces similar to small mites. It was very itchy. When I asked if there was toilet water, Karen came to care about our situation for the first time, and gave us toilet water, Fengyoujing (this Fengyoujing was another one of our service staff took out his own Yes, it's not from the hotel, I forgot to ask her name at that time, and I would like to thank her very much here).
       After that, Karen came to care about the progress of things frequently, and extended the check-out time for us. I really feel that this is the most comfortable hotel I have ever stayed in, and the service is one of the best. Thank you for this wonderful experience. I still want to have time. go live.

msg:2 points for service, especially the tall guy on duty that night. The temporary home room was to be repaired, so I took the old man to live outside for a few days. I arrived at the hotel after ten o&#39;clock in the evening. After I checked into the room, I felt that my nose was very uncomfortable. I didn&#39;t think much about going to bed quickly. After washing my legs, I felt itchy on the calf. . After sitting on the sofa for a while, the calf was bitten by several bags, which was very uncomfortable. Later, it was not until the old man was bitten by several pieces and scratched that it was found that there was a serious health problem. At this time, I took a closer look at the carpet, and it was too dirty. It&#39;s almost like living in a trash can, unimaginable. When I contacted the front desk, the tall boy immediately came to apologize and offered to change the room next door. The carpet in the new room was not so dirty, but he kept sneezing and there was still a lot of dust. At home, it has to be emptied 24 hours a day, and I don&#39;t know how much dust it ****** in after staying here all night. I just wanted to have a clean sleep, but I was too lazy to deal with the hotel, so I immediately changed the hotel the next day. In addition, the next day, I went to the 1F by mistake. I pushed the old man to go to the toilet, but the orange-clothed waiter pointed the way and didn&#39;t say anything. As a result, the toilet was completely black, so what did you point to? ? baffling. Maybe the waiter thought we were rubbing the toilet. I have stayed in three big hotels here in the airport mall, and I always thought that Cordis should be the best. Through this time, I found that the newly opened one is much better. The location is really good, it is very convenient to go to shopping malls and the airport high-speed rail station.

This time I chose this place because of a business trip. I feel that the hotel is the first choice for business trips. First of all, the transportation is convenient. Hongqiao Railway Station and Hongqiao Airport T2 are within walking distance. Secondly, the surrounding National Exhibition Center is nearby, and thirdly, the surrounding Hongqiao Xintiandi and other commercial facilities are complete. Fourth, the hotel service and breakfast are impeccable, especially the breakfast regardless of the variety of Chinese and Western food, although not the most, every taste is exquisite!

The spider webs in the corners are obvious and there is a lot of dust. In addition, I asked to send a pair of dental appliances, but the delivery was very slow, and the first time I sent it wrong, I actually sent two bottles of water... In order to wait for a pair of dental appliances, I waited for an estimated half an hour.

msg:The first room had a yellow stain under the shower room door and didn't look very clean. When I actually used it, the drainage was clogged and the water overflowed to the outside, so I asked for a room change the next day. They were willing to respond and provided us with an upgraded room at no additional charge. The location is within walking distance of large commercial facilities, and the hotel is located in Hongqiao World Hotel, so there are plenty of convenience stores, cafes, and restaurants, so you don't have to worry about eating out. It is also good that it is directly connected to the station and the airport. Breakfast at the hotel is served at the B1 restaurant. There aren't many types, but I think it's enough for business. You need to be careful when you stand up because you will try to bring the plate with food left on the plate while you are eating. It can be said that the employees pay close attention to the guest's table, but it was a little disappointing because they wanted to eat slowly. Is the female employee who can speak Japanese delicious on the morning of the second day? Said to me. I was very happy.
All the employees were kind and warm. I've stayed at several hotels in Shanghai, but the customer service of employees ranks high among me.

It is said that it takes 2 working days for the deposit of 1500 to arrive in the account. When it arrives, it is divided into two 707s. Is this not enough for 1500? And when I arrived today, I thought I would return the rest in batches. Who knew there was no response after waiting for a day? Call me and say we need to ask about finance again. Why don't you ask about finance when you collect the deposit? When I first entered this hotel, I felt pretty good, the service attitude was good, and I upgraded the room for free, but after staying for one night, the pillow was too high and the mattress was too soft. Be careful! Then to the refund of the deposit, a large hotel with more than 700 800 per night, refunding the deposit is so laborious and the experience is extremely poor.

When we came back, we made a face all the way and brought us to the same room upstairs again. We left without a word, one-star level. The network can be connected, but the network speed is slow.

毗鄰虹橋樞紐和虹橋商務區，地理位置絕佳。但近幾次的入住，卻讓我深感酒店“年老失修”的問題，尤其是寫字桌邊的電源箱。幾次入住，不同房間，都有電源失效，斷電的問題。給我入住期間增添了些許不便。

まずロケーションについて、以前地下鉄駅からのアクセスに迷いながら移動しましたが、何と言う近さ、それも天候に左右される事なく5分程でフロントにアクセス出来る事を知りました。この虹橋駅にあってこれは最大の魅力と思う。（ロケーション表示をもう少し工夫されたらもっと良いかもしれません。）

部屋は解放感を感じられるテラス付きとしビールを楽しもうと期待していましたが、未だ寒い時期でもありく実現出来なかった事は残念。
しかし、お部屋はとても快適で贅沢(カーテンも自動)、勿論ベットはふかふかでとても良く寝れました。
テラスでのビールはもう少し暖かくなってから再挑戦です。
春節中という事もあり、最上階のプールに他のお客さんは居らず開放的、レストランでの朝食も8amであったにも関わらずお客さんはポツリポツリ。
私のための美味しいい料理、そしていろいろ気に掛けてくれるシェフ！と最初は思いましたが、お客さんがたくさん居て賑やかな方が良かったかなー。

チェックイン、チェックアウト時には英語が得意でない私に随所にユーモアを入れての日本語説明でとても助けられましたし。
春先の滞在はテラスでのビールを楽しみにまたお世話になります。
ありがとうございました。

兩點有待改善：
1. 環保至上可以理解，但是所有洗化用品甚至包括棉簽都要客人打電話去拿，是不是有點矯枉過正。給住客帶來很多的不便。你可以在浴室提供最基本的衞生用品。這是我住過唯一一家浴室裏什麼都沒有的酒店。。。

2. 前台的混血（不知道是不是）小哥哥很靈光。
但是聽客服電話的接線小姑娘，正好是相反。年29那天接電話，我説你有沒有usb-2充電線，就衹會説：沒有，那沒有。聽起來很不情願，跟客户溝通太僵硬了，就感覺我打電話是在跟機器人説話。
或者説：沒有什麼服務意識。

聽起來也許是我在吹毛求疵，但是你是一家五星級酒店，全球連鎖的。你不論任何時候都應該要對得起你的品牌，和你收的價錢。客户買的是你的品牌，還有服務。

已經第二次選擇了。

這一次帶娃來玩。
孩子也很喜歡。他説就把這裏當在上海的家了。
我也是這樣計劃的。
甚至，我們去蘇州玩，也可以住在虹橋康得思。
上午出發，玩好下午或者晚上動車回來康得思。
不用費腦子重新在蘇州找酒店。😂😂😂 還不用收拾打包行李。

msg:酒店CHECK-IN入住時感覺不錯，我們早上十一時多抵達酒店，亦能立刻編配房間給我，讓風塵撲撲的我們，可以立刻休息一下；
酒店整體不錯，房間整齊乾淨，細節上有少少顯舊，但還是滿意的。

泳池水深較淺，游泳比較吃力，但泳池環境不錯，就算不游泳，也值得上去看一下；旁邊為頂樓酒吧，不過只在週一到週五營業，我們剛好是週六到，就沒能去感受氣氛了。
泳池游泳要穿戴泳帽，我沒有，可以在泳池前台買，$56一頂，由於只是一次性需要使用（在香港及國外也不需要啊），就打算先看看泳池再決定是否游泳再購買，不過職員就好像怕我會不戴泳帽游泳，全程像監視我一樣，感覺很不舒服；當我決定游泳時，便到打算到前枱購買泳帽，但前枱說要立刻付款，由說我沒付按金，不能掛房帳，必須立刻付款；我目的是打算游泳，為何要帶手機或現金？？？而且房間費用也一千多元，五十多元的泳帽我會不付款嗎？？？
早兩天才在宿遷住宿，那麼也沒需要按金，也能掛帳啊，一個二線城市的管理也比這裡好啊，一間國際性的酒店這麼頑固的管理，連二線的也不如啊，還敢說在上海？？？
職員的頑固，游泳的興致也沒有了，到了前枱投訴，最後由經理致電回房間，送贈我們早餐及果盤，不過最後果盤也沒到。

免費的早餐也說兩句吧，整體滿意，現煮的奄列好味道，可以自己選材料，跟廚師說多芝士，看到他真的下了好多芝士，非常好味道。可能由於天氣冷及熱飲料的位置問題，基本上熱飲料也放涼了，要特意讓服務員再沖泡熱的，這是唯一缺點，但對於早餐的整體體驗也沒有影響。

酒店離虹橋火車站很近，地下通道走過來也就十分鐘不到，周圍飲食購物便利，雖然是商務酒店但是帶娃中轉住個一兩晚的話可以看到飛機火車同畫框也挺不錯。
兩次入住都沒去明閣，希望下次有機會嘗試一下

我開車過去入住，第一次過去，因為和虹橋火車站很近，沒辦法區分哪裡是酒店地下車庫，就把車開到酒店大堂外路面停車場，詢問酒店保安，我是過來住宿的車可以停在這裏嗎？保安説不可以，我説我已經轉了30分鐘左右沒有找到停車庫，是否可以讓我先辦理入住再去找車庫，此時我已經很疲累很疲累，保安還是不行？我再三要求下，我説路面有那麼空位置，為啥不能停？後來保安打對講機給主管，主管來一句，不行，不能停車，我隨機電話到前台，還是一樣踢皮球，撕來撕去，結果沒有解決就是一句，不行，直接給我電話掛了。
這是在虹橋火車站不缺客流唄，服務做成這樣，真心**！無語了

2.安排的是離電梯最遠的一間房，但是我看酒店入住率也不高，不知是否是前台刻意所為。
3.浴巾老化，都脱線了仍在使用。
看這點評高選擇入住的，看來下次還是得選擇大品牌的，不能貪小便宜。

一個是前台服務態度並沒有很到位，語氣很差
二是wifi信號極差，移動信號也很差，電視機也很老舊
三是最嚴重的，馬桶間下水道反味非常嚴重，很臭……
真的挺差勁的，除了離高鐵站近以外，沒有什麼優點了

桌子旁的充電板是翻開插電的設計，但是因為老舊根本無法固定住，會突然翻回去折到充電線或者砸到手機。

其他各方面中規中矩，除了步行20分鐘可以到機場以外沒有什麼太多可説的了。
