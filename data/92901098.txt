msg:From the point of arrival, to check in and then to our stay, everything was tiptop. The butler Penny and the team provided exceptional service and were very professional. You can tell that they take pride in everything they do. They made sure we got the room that we booked and ensure they shared all information clearly.
The room was stunning, clean, and the bed was so comfortable, my partner and l agreed that we had the best sleep. When we needed something, room service was quick to act on our request.
I am so happy we chose Hyatt.

Definitely a must stay!
Thank you The Penny

The managers on duty are amazing, and we're at our service the entire time and made our stay perfect. The English proficiency at the hotel was also one of the standouts, and it made it easy for us to get the tickets for the waterpark and the theme park. We Will definitely return for another trip.

msg:1. Someone will call to ask if you have children and if you need housekeeping service the day before check-in (this is pretty good)👍👍
2. On the day of check-in, the housekeeper added WeChat to tell us the park's operating hours and upgraded the room for free, which is great☺️☺️☺️
3. When getting off the bus, there was a porter, but he didn't ask if you needed help with the luggage and chewed betel nuts, which was very unprofessional (his mouth was red)☹️☹️☹️
4. When checking in, I didn't want to wait in line, so I asked a staff member named Tan if I could ask the housekeeper to help me check in. After asking my name, he helped call the housekeeper, led us to sit on the sofa, took the initiative to get water and asked us to wait for a while, and a worker The staff came out to help with the check-in. The lady was very nice and had a very good attitude (it can be seen that the hotel management is very good)👍👍👍 (Tip: ask the butler to help with the check-in, otherwise you have to wait for a long time‼️)
5. Go to swipe your ID card to register for the park ticket, (Tip: unlimited entry means unlimited entry on the same day, and you can also choose unlimited entry tomorrow‼️) At this time, my friend bought an ice cream, but the ice cream was melted. A family also encountered the same situation. My friend asked the staff if they could refund the money. The staff said no, they could only exchange it (this is a bit forced, and I feel a little uncomfortable)😑😑😑
6. When I got to the room, it was very clean and comfortable to look at. Suitable, cleaned without dust and garbage, very comfortable, and the equipment can be used normally
7. Forgot to bring  mobile phone charger, called the guest service center and they said they didn't have it. Contacted the housekeeper Xiao Dai to tell her that the alarm clock on the bedside table can be wirelessly charged. Xiao Dai is really thoughtful (I don't know if the guest service center didn't say it or didn't understand the room hardware facilities)😧😧😧
8. I remembered that the room includes a mini bar. I looked at the refrigerator and there were only 4 bottles of mineral water. I called the guest service center and they said that the room is only equipped with 4 bottles of mineral water. It feels like there is no mini bar. What room is not equipped with mineral water🫥🫥🫥, asked the omnipotent Xiao Dai and said that 4 bottles of drinks were sent🥤It's good (Guest The customer service center here gives me the feeling that it is useless)🙄🙄🙄
9. Let's go out and play. Ocean Paradise is so far away from the hotel that it's silly to walk there. You have to walk from the right, cross a large lawn, and keep going forward. There is a hotel guest entrance. You can enter by swiping your ID card (Tips: If there are more than 2 people staying, you have to buy tickets. If you buy tickets at the hotel guest entrance, you can enter the park unlimited times today‼️) 1. Enter and you will see the Ferris wheel🎡. There are two ways to play the Ferris wheel: one is the same as the ordinary Ferris wheel, and the other is that you can swing back and forth in the sky, which is more exciting. It meets the needs of two types of people and is relatively novel, but you will feel a little dizzy💡💡💡2. The second project is the roller coaster🎢, which is really big! It's also far away from the Ferris wheel🎡. The roller coaster🎢 is super big and long! It's really scary😱 At the beginning, it is a vertical straight line shape, which is super cool, and then all kinds of expressions can't be controlled🥹 Very cool! ! ! 💡💡💡💡💡
3. Went to the jungle rafting. It was said that both the jungle rafting and the Rust Mountain Rapids needed raincoats. The water was a little bigger. There was a shop next to the jungle rafting where you could buy raincoats. The better quality ones were 20 yuan a pack, and the average quality ones were the same as plastic bags, which were 15 yuan a pack regardless of size. After buying the raincoats, I went to the jungle rafting and played on a boat. It could take 4-6 people. The boat was not very big, so the raincoat was almost useless. It was quite stable. 💡💡💡4. Ride the wind and waves , is sitting on a fixed motorboat 🛥️, the water below is quite cool and nice 💡💡💡5. The whirlpool skateboard 🛹 is to imitate surfing 🏄 swinging left and right is also nice 💡💡💡6. The sailor swing is like a swing, it is not stimulating and children can also play swinging back and forth, which can be a bit boring 🥱 but also cool and windy 💡💡7. The Rust Mountain Rapids venue is also very large, the way to play is similar to the roller coaster, that is, you have to stick to the water and slide down from the sky, the water is super big! ! ! If you don't wear a raincoat, your whole body will be wet. If you don't want to buy a raincoat, you can save it for the last one to play. It's exciting and fun💡💡💡💡💡8. The flying adventure is to sit on an imitation hot air balloon and slowly rotate into the air. You can rotate the black steering wheel and keep turning. It's a bit dizzy💡💡9. The dream carousel🎠 is a carousel that is quite boring and suitable for children to turn around💡10. You need to wear 3D glasses for the Blue Sea Guardian🤓3D glasses are provided inside. I don't know if it's the glasses that are blurred or the screen that is blurred. Anyway, I can't see clearly. Sitting on it, there are toy guns to shoot monsters👿The interactivity is quite good💡11. The rotating water station boat is a disc that you need to stand on. There are stools and water guns. You need to rotate the roulette wheel to spray water. You can interact with other tourists 12. Atang Cinema also requires 3D glasses, and they are provided. The doors inside feel very technological, and the chairs are comfortable. It simulates a cool run on the Great Wall. It is very exciting. Many children are screaming hahahahahahahahahahaha. The chairs are very dynamic and visually impactful, and you can feel like you are there. 13. The Secret Realm of the South China Sea is a place to see marine and rainforest creatures, including giant salamanders, pythons, arapaima (super big), rays, various turtles, small sharks, catfish, eels, groupers, mermaids, starfish, sea cucumbers, and various animals. The submarine model and touch pool are awesome. The project has many facilities and everything is very good and cool. It feels more fun than Chimelong. The buildings are beautiful and suitable for taking photos. The watermelon smoothie inside is delicious and the pulp is sweet😋. There are also some heartwarming details. The park will spray water mist to effectively cool down🙆♀️. The toilets in the park have hand blowing machines, wash basins and small mirrors for children🪞There are small cards posted in the toilets. You can call "good friends" when they come📞The staff will give you sanitary pads. It's really heartwarming. There are motorcade tours, dolphin shows and mermaid shows🧜All free. There are also nightclubs, DJs, singing🎤dancing💃clowns🤡and balloons🎈in the evening. The most important thing is that there are fireworks🎆, which are very beautiful (tip: you don't need to wear a swimsuit in Ocean Joy World, but you do in Ocean Water Park‼️)
10. Alas😮💨, asked the housekeeper if there was a shuttle bus to take us back to the hotel🏨, only Water World had shuttle bus, but not Happy World, so we had to walk back, it was so far, I saw many entertainment facilities suitable for children, trampoline, slide🛝, climbing rope, swimming pool🏊♀️ were all great, returned to the room and saw the birthday cake🎂 prepared by the housekeeper Xiaodai, very pleasantly surprised, the cake🎂 was very big, 4-6 inches, it was a fruit cake with animal cream, the fruits were all very fresh
11. The next morning, the housekeeper asked if we needed to delay check-out until 2 o'clock, which was very warm, and when we were about to check out, the housekeeper asked if we needed a porter to pull the luggage, and also gave two dolls, this trip was generally very happy🥳🥳🥳

Wang Chunnuan Nicole in the children's park is great! She took us to make clay and was very patient to play with the children. There is also a beautiful Russian sister who can make beautiful balloons. The hotel is very close to the park, which is very convenient. We played for 2 days, and there was no need to queue up for any project. You can play N times.

msg:I don't know if it was Monday, but there were not many guests in the hotel, so it was very comfortable; we were upgraded to a parent-child room, with dry and wet separation, and a children's sleeping area. The room included a small train and park tickets. The hotel swimming pool was great and I liked it very much. The bubble show in the children's swimming pool started at 4 o'clock. There were not many people in the swimming pool. It was great to come back and soak in the pool after playing in the park. One thing is that the air conditioning temperature in the public area is too high, and it seems that there is no air conditioning in the elevator; I didn't feel very cool when I came back from the outdoors; there were many activities, and the children had a lot of climbing frames, parrots and peacocks. We participated in the climbing activities. There were barbecues, fire dances and crab digging in the evening, although we didn't dig anything ~ Butler Xiao Pan is very considerate ~ My brother said he would come to play again when he grows taller ~

Hygiene: The cleaning lady is serious and responsible. As soon as the children entered the door, they were attracted by the hand-folded animals. They even slept with dolls at night.
Service: The service is impeccable. I thought there would be a lot of people waiting for the room on Children's Day, but I went to the front desk and handled it very quickly. The explanation was also very detailed. There was a small problem in the middle, and it happened to be solved by the manager Leo.

A hotel worth staying in, especially the family room. The children are very satisfied with their own small space.

The hotel lobby is spacious and bright, with elegant and noble decoration, coupled with the warm and thoughtful staff. Here I would like to thank Belle very much. From check-in to check-out, she gave good suggestions in detail. At the same time, the front desk checked in enthusiastically and the concierge took the initiative to help with the luggage. The whole check-in process gives people a sense of dignity and luxury.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable, equipped with high-end furniture and electronic facilities, and the balcony can enjoy the endless sea view.

The hotel has a variety of dining options, from exquisite Western food to sumptuous buffets, satisfying all tastes. The facilities and equipment such as swimming pools, gyms, and spas are first-class, and can be said to have everything. The hotel also provides free airport pick-up and drop-off services, which greatly enhances the overall check-in experience.

In general, Lingshui R&F Hyatt Hotel has achieved the ultimate in terms of environment, facilities and services, and is worthy of the title of Hainan's top resort hotel.

You need to tell the waiter to drink coffee, and it can be made fresh. It is very good to come now in the off-season, with high cost performance, and the front desk service and response are also very quick, without sales supervision and hidden consumption. This time I came on a business trip, and I didn’t experience many parent-child projects and free travel photography, but the quality of the bed, sanitary conditions, and heavy door soundproof glass made the room quiet and comfortable overall; you can walk to the park from the hotel, but it is still a distance from the real beach. It is okay to play in the swimming pool. Next time I bring my family to Lingshui, I will choose to stay again!

This stay can be said to be fate. It was still received by the butler Kent. Thank you very much Kent again. The service was very thoughtful. He helped us check in in advance and upgraded our parent-child room. The children liked it very much.
The Ocean World is worth visiting. Various attractions, performances, and fireworks shows on weekend nights are all full of punch-in materials. It is recommended to add reservations from the hotel to visit the two parks. You can enter and exit as many times as you want on the same day. If you are tired, you can go back to the hotel to rest before going. Overall, this trip was very happy. Next time I travel, I will choose Hyatt.

Thank you for his recommendation. The breakfast was very rich. I liked eating it. Everyone was very satisfied. I was very happy to sit on the small train. Everyone was taking pictures. There were not many people in the park in the off-season. My companions were afraid of excitement and did not go there. We mainly went there. The hotel is great, the hotel environment is very good, especially the barbecue at the beach in the evening, blowing the wind and drinking coconut, it is very enjoyable.

msg:The first time I encountered this situation during a trip, my husband and I both had a fever. I asked the front desk for a thermometer and antipyretic medicine, but they didn’t have any. So I went to buy medicine and a thermometer myself. Both of us were exhausted. We asked the hotel front desk to help bring them up, but they told me to go down and get them myself… This is a family hotel in the wilderness. The medicine I bought took at least 1.5 hours to be delivered, and the hotel had no ability to deal with emergencies. Putting this aside, regardless of how good the service is, it is very inhumane to let sick guests take care of themselves… Fortunately, there was a Ctrip housekeeper who communicated with the hotel as soon as possible to deliver the medicine. If it were other travelers, would they have to drag their sick bodies down to get the medicine? Is this your way of hospitality? Hyatt, I have learned a lot!

msg:Lingshui Hyatt Hotel is the first choice for family travel. Hotel package products or multiple admission products are recommended. The hotel facilities are amazing and I was amazed. There are so many activities. It is no problem to stay in the hotel for 2 to 3 days. The South China Sea train, the underwater tunnel of the South China Sea secret realm in Happy World, the underwater escalator, the mermaid show, and Nezha's sea. There are also many performances: dolphin shows, walrus shows, etc., as well as extreme sports, Ferris wheels, fireworks, etc.! Why give 3 stars for service? I also encountered some pleasant services in it. 1. When checking in, I don’t know if it is the tour guide or someone who can help the guests queue up. If no one comes, I will not process it for me. I emphasized that I should process it first, but the service staff just refused. 2. For breakfast the next day, there were so many people and I needed to find a seat. After waiting for more than 10 minutes at an unmanned table, no one came back, and the service staff refused to clean up, fearing that some guests had not finished eating. I also understand that in this situation, is there a better solution to help subsequent guests instead of waiting all the time. 3. When measuring the height of children at the entrance, if they are over 1 meter, they need to buy a ticket. The service attitude is very poor. They keep emphasizing that children need to buy a ticket if they are 102cm tall. If you want to complain, just complain. My child was measured three times and was allowed to enter only after taking off his shoes and not exceeding 1 meter. I think this can be relaxed appropriately.

msg:First of all, the housekeeper's service is very thoughtful and considerate, which I absolutely affirm.
1. We checked in on the 29th. Since we were traveling with two families, my friends lined up before us. The front desk upgraded the room type by default. When it was our turn, the front desk saw us chatting and probably realized that we knew each other, so they asked, do you want to live closer to them? We nodded and said that we would try to arrange it closer. The interesting thing came, the front desk asked: So do you also want to upgrade? (So? The same room type, the same order, is it decided whether to upgrade or not according to the mood? I don't understand)
2. When we had lunch in the hotel restaurant, the no-smoking sign was very obvious, but there were adult men who still smoked indoors near the table full of children. We reported this to the waiter, and the waiter looked at it coldly, neither responding to our questions nor stopping and dissuading us
3. When we arrived at the hotel on the 29th, we saw that the staff was still cleaning the shallow swimming pool of the hotel, and it was not filled with water. There was only a deep water swimming pool to play. On the morning of the 30th, I found that the water was released, so after playing in the Ocean Park that day, I went back to the room to give my child a shower (there was no bruise or discomfort during the shower), and then went to the shallow water area to play in the water. There was a safety officer seat on the shore, but it was empty. In the pool full of infants and young children, there were adult male guests washing their feet in slippers, and adult men walking from the deep water area wearing underwear. Note‼ ️Not swimming trunks, but underwear, directly went into the pool full of young children to play in the water. It was disgusting and eye-catching. None of the above hotel staff were there to maintain and stop. After leaving the swimming pool and returning to the room to take a shower, I found that my skin was allergic, red, swollen and itchy! The water quality safety is too much to be studied. We are the guests who came from Wanning after playing for 2 days. After playing in the swimming pool of Wanning Hotel, we did not feel uncomfortable, and the children themselves were not allergic to the pool water. We can only say that the water of this hotel is not clean.
4. We live on the 7th floor. From the night of check-in, the residents upstairs kept knocking on the floor in the middle of the night, which was very noisy. Anyone in the corridor talking at a normal volume can be heard clearly in the room. The room is not soundproof at all. People with poor sleep quality, be careful!!!

The hotel meals are expensive and unpalatable. My husband only ate in the hotel on the 29th and 30th, and he always had diarrhea.
The above are all real check-in experiences, for parents with children to refer to. The hotel management is very chaotic, and the hardware facilities are average. Never delete reviews!!!

We felt her enthusiasm before we checked in. It is worth a thumbs up. It is very nice. The hotel needs such employees. It is even better. We are reluctant to leave the hotel after checking in. The children haven't had enough fun. The Ocean Park is worth recommending to adults and children to come and play together. I will come again next time. Recommended! !

msg:The hotel is relatively new, the bathroom lights are very beautiful, and there are slippers and bathrobes in women's sizes, which I like very much. I am thin and don't like to wear big bathrobes and slippers. The room is trendy, which is a shortcoming. Everything else is very nasi.
On the second night of the tour, there was an emergency with gastroenteritis and a high fever. I stayed for another night. The front desk and customer service were very tolerant. They knew that I didn't eat breakfast because I was sick, so they gave me breakfast for free on the day of the extension. When I went to the restaurant, everyone at the front desk knew that I was sick and greeted me, which made me feel embarrassed. These are things I didn't experience later in Yanlord Crown! I recommend that families with children go to the park to rent a small car. Although it is a little expensive, it doesn't hurt to run. At the same time, you can play many projects in one day. It's worth the money. The mermaid performance is very romantic...
Zhang Jing, the little housekeeper of Ctrip, answered and solved the problem in time. Because I couldn't accompany my child to play because of illness, I communicated with Water World to apply for the May Day exclusive accompanying project (including self-funded type). The child was still not satisfied. Thank you very much. I am also very grateful to Manager Yuan, the person in charge of Water World.
Although the sudden illness disrupted the itinerary, the Hyatt experience was full and it deserves a five-star recommendation! Personally, I encountered many unpleasant things at Yanlord Crown and they had to be properly resolved by finding the manager!

The children's room was too far away, so it took a long time to walk back to the room. The scenery was not very good, and there was no scenery to see. The corridor was too dark, and the children were a little scared when walking. Everything else was good, including the breakfast. I was generally satisfied.

Hygiene: There are small flying insects in the tropical climate, so close the doors and windows in time. The front end of the bathtub is yellow, so you need to put it in more.
Environment: There are beautiful scenery everywhere in the hotel, and the external environment is relatively independent. It takes 20 minutes to take a taxi or drive to go shopping and eat snacks.
Service: To be honest, it is really average. There is room for improvement compared to 5-star service.

We played in the Ocean World for two days under the 32-degree sun. It was too sunny, but the three of us were very happy. It was super fun. I will come again if I have the chance!!! The Ocean World is very suitable for a 6-year-old child, and the Hyatt Hotel is very close, so you can have fun and rest at the same time.

The hotel environment is also great, especially clean, and most importantly, it is close to the sea and there is no damp smell. There are also children's supplies, which are very thoughtful.
The hotel package we bought came with a park ticket, and you can enter and exit the park as many times as you want with your ID card.
The hotel's children's projects are also quite rich, and the children have a lot of fun. Especially digging crabs after low tide
The housekeeper Zheng Xuemin Ivy is super considerate, and she arranged for us in a timely and detailed manner, and she responded to all requests. I must give her a big thumbs up.

msg:The international five-star brand hotel is excellent in all aspects. If you go to R&F Ocean World and Water World, you really have to stay here. You can see the Ferris wheel and fireworks opposite for dinner or swimming at night. The staff you come into contact with are gentle and friendly. The "housekeeper" carefully arranges and helps coordinate many things. The person in charge of the children's park, "Zhu Shijian", is warm and thoughtful. We participated in free archery, tree climbing, crab digging and weaving, and paid to make cookies for 20 yuan, which are very fragrant. The clown uncle is humorous and witty, and the sister who walks on stilts is always smiling. Many projects in the ocean park can be played by babies over 90cm. The dolphin show is wonderful. The fireworks at night are really gorgeous when seen up close, but the meals are a little more expensive. Hyatt is recommended to people who like to stay in quality hotels. Both hardware and software are up to standard. It is recommended to stay for two to three nights. Hainan is really a domestic treasure tourist destination. What needs to be improved is that the gravel in the swimming pool is recommended to be cleaned up.

Warm, polite and considerate, they provided us with professional check-in and check-out services. Answering questions patiently and meticulously made us feel the warmth of home. The hotel's children's playground is also very clean and has a variety of interesting toys and games for children to have fun. The staff are friendly and considerate, creating a happy and warm environment for the children. In addition, the hotel has an exclusive access to the Happy World, making it very convenient to go to the park. It was a very pleasant stay. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and look forward to staying there again next time. "

msg:Service: Very good. The housekeeper Ivy Zheng Xuemin is really considerate. She added me as a friend even before I checked in. She told me in advance what the package I ordered included. She also provided various performance schedules and hotel activity schedules for Water World in advance. Sent. After I confirmed my itinerary, I went with me to the ticket exchange office to exchange tickets for the small train and water world. After accompanying us all the way to the room, they also brought us the children's bathrobes, disposable slippers, toiletries, etc. This is something that even Wipers did. Since the check-in time was an awkward time like lunch, we also thoughtfully prepared welcome fruits. We were fully informed about our itinerary during the entire stay, coordinated the time when the room could be cleaned, and replenished the disposable supplies in the room in a timely manner.
Facilities: The supporting facilities are complete, the things in the room are clean, and the design style is also good, especially the dry and wet separation is very good. The separate toilet room dissipates odor quickly. The view from the room type is also very good. There are also trampolines, two swimming pools in the park (the slide in the water play area is very popular with children, and the pure swimming area is suitable for adults to relax), a cute pet garden, and an activity lawn.
Parent-child entertainment: There was an archery activity in the morning, which was quite fun. The children played for a while before entering the water world. In the evening, the hotel staff took us to the sea. Because the children liked the slide in the water area so much, we didn't have time to gather. It was a pity to miss it. The children who came back said it was very fun. I forgot what time it was in the evening, but there was also a bonfire show, which was quite exciting.
Suggestion: The porcelain tiles under the hotel's swimming pool have fallen off. It is recommended to repair it when changing the water. The father of the child accidentally punctured his foot.
Heart-warming service: After the wound was broken, the staff on site quickly brought a medical kit to apply medicine and bandage. And promptly responded to the front desk and informed the housekeeper. The housekeeper and staff then followed up by phone and delivered iodine, band-aids, etc. to the room, and also gave us afternoon tea. They kept bowing and apologizing, which made us feel embarrassed. It was punctured and there was some bleeding. It was fine the next day. It did not affect the schedule. However, their promptness and caring left a good impression on us. I hope you will do better and better.

White Castle🏰, I feel like I’m living in a fairy tale👸🏻
The beauty under the blue sky is the Ferris wheel🎡, the same sea train in Hayao Miyazaki’s anime🚅
There are also key first-level protected wild animals, dugongs, legendary mermaids, and cute manatees.
It is recommended that everyone have breakfast. You can choose to sit on the terrace of the cafe, look at the blue sky and Ferris wheel next to it, and feel the slow pace of life in Hainan. Be sure to go to the terrace early. Later, the sun will shine on the terrace and it will be hot.
It feels very good. Next time I come, I will choose a date to experience the 🈶fireworks🎆.

msg:This time I was traveling in Hainan for 9 days and 8 nights, and I booked the last 4 nights at the newly opened Hyatt Regency R&F Ocean World. We drove from Bianjiezhou Island to the Hyatt Hotel for almost 40 minutes, and arrived at the hotel at almost 5 o'clock. Leo Lu Zhongquan at the front desk took me to see our decorated room, which was simple but very warm. There are more than 700 rooms in the hotel. The room we stayed in, Room 4005, is close to the small number and there are connecting rooms. It is very suitable for large families, especially the three groups are families with mothers and children. The connecting rooms are perfect. The small round table is convenient for children to eat and play together! It's great to have a living room where several families can gather together. The balcony is also large, and you can see the sea train in Miyazaki Hayao's comic book. Opposite is the Hainan Eye Ferris wheel🎡, which is particularly beautiful for taking pictures! There are staff members greeting you every morning when you have breakfast or when you walk through the corridor. There are also many activities in the hotel, with timetables every day, as well as a children's playground and video games. You can go directly to Sea World through the hotel's internal passage. The park opening time is also 9 o'clock during the Chinese New Year. When we went there at the end of January, it happened to be a weekend. It closes at 6 o'clock on weekdays. There is not enough fun in one day! This time the water world has not opened yet, and the children told me that they must stay at the Hyatt next time they come to Hainan! very happy! The facilities are complete, the hygiene is good, the shower water is large, the environment is good, and the service industry is great! Recommend self-driving tour here! We stayed here and also went to Daidai Island and Monkey Island, as well as Guixin Garden to feed the 1-meter-large tortoises. The children had a wonderful winter vacation! You can feel like summer without going abroad in winter!

It took about an hour to drive down from Sanya and arrived at the hotel around 2 o'clock. Thank you Belle for receiving us, preparing the room, helping us check in, and also specially introduced the guide to the park (just for fun). The room is very beautiful and can be seen directly. There is also a small train in the paradise. In the evening, you can also participate in hotel activities and take a dip in the swimming pool, which is very comfortable. Get up and have breakfast the next day, and then you can go directly to the amusement park. After Amway breakfast, I felt like I could eat two servings. This time, the time was a little short and I didn’t have enough time. Come back next time👏🏻

There are many parent-child activities, and there is a children's movie area where children can stay quietly while waiting to check in. The activities after check-in were very good, especially the bonfire party and crab digging at night. The little one loved it so much! The breakfast area is a bit convoluted, but the food variety is still rich. Maybe it was because there were too many people celebrating the New Year, so there was a queue for breakfast. The housekeeper Cai Cai's service was very considerate and helped with check-in and check-out. Because the old man was unwell, he also helped apply for a late check-out. I originally booked a double room, but my family's schedule changed temporarily, and the housekeeper helped arrange a family room in time. The Nanhai Train is a leisure project, very suitable for the elderly, and it takes about 20 minutes to go around the park. Note⚠️: You need to go to the lobby ticket center to exchange your tickets before riding. Guests bound to the Happy World must also exchange their tickets there before entering.

Hygiene: Very good. You don’t need to worry about the Hyatt Hotel. The most important thing when staying in a hotel with children is hygiene.
Environment: Comfortable. The design of the hotel is really great. It is an art building in itself. It has its own highlights during the day and at night. It is especially beautiful at night.
Service: The hotel has butler service. Please make a request in advance. If your child requires a room with a view of the Ferris wheel or shared beds, it will be satisfied. The butler hoody provides good service.

msg:R&F Hyatt is worth it, the experience is not inferior to that of Yate!
When you enter the park, you feel like a fairy tale. The lobby is very lively, not as luxurious as the hotels in Haitang Bay. Check-in is a little slow during peak hours, but everything after that is perfect. The room is spacious, and the upgrade to the park view is really great. Watching fireworks in the room at night is better than in the park. Special thanks to the housekeeper Zheng Jijin, who contacted us in advance to inquire about our check-in needs. He also helped us a lot during our stay and provided warm service. It's great for children's care. The shampoo is better than Ate and Chimelong. I want to repurchase it.
On the first day of a family trip, after checking in, you go straight to the amusement park. After you have played enough facilities, watched the mermaid show at noon, and finished eating, you can go back to your room to rest. After you have recovered, you can decide whether to go back to the amusement park or go swimming in the hotel. Family-friendly There are many activities and the staff are very patient. The housekeepers and guest room staff who meet in the corridor will take the initiative to say hello. This is probably the benefit of traveling in the off-season. I can easily play all the activities I want to play.

The room is large and the partitions are very reasonable: there is a large luggage storage area and clothes rack at the entrance, and the bathroom and shower room are completely separated. Although the bed in the double room is only 1.8 meters, there is a very comfortable large sofa, which is completely suitable for sleeping. For an adult, it is very convenient to add a bedding. The balcony is spacious and has a clothes drying rack. The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, and the a la carte restaurant for dinner is particularly delicious. As a parent-child hotel, the children's entertainment activities are rich and attractive, and you can't finish them all if you stay for less than 3 days! Hotel guests have exclusive access to amusement parks and water parks, with unlimited entry and exit. There is also a shuttle bus to the water park, and special toiletries and bathrobes are provided for children.
It is recommended that you check in during off-peak hours, as the flow of people during peak seasons may affect your check-in experience.
Some suggestions: the buffet restaurant needs improvement, with fewer service staff and unstable food quality; the hotel is relatively large and I hope there will be clearer signage; the lockers in the water park are expensive and small and I hope they can be adjusted.

msg:Before booking, I saw that the hotel's rating was not high, so I had to choose it because of Ocean Paradise. The check-in experience is indeed no different from Ctrip reviews. The ocean-view king-size bed room that we, two adults and two children, stayed in, was told to add an extra bed when we checked in at 3 p.m., but it was not confirmed until 7:30 p.m. During this period, we communicated with the housekeeper and customer service many times, and the customer service service was disgusting. We make too many phone calls. The breakfast variety is of average quality. You have to go there around 8 o'clock as there will be too many people and queues after that. The only thing I think is the most convenient way to check out is as long as the room card is still in the check-out box. Ocean Paradise is not bad, but you must rent a car. The design of the park is not suitable for walking with legs. There are no roads to shuttle between major projects, so you can only go in large circles. When I got tired and wanted to rent a car, there was no car available. I made sure to rent it when I entered the park. The level of marine life performances is not at the same level as Harbin or Dalian.

Moreover, in February, the swimming pool is very cold and it is relatively close to the amusement park. You don’t have to worry about staying here. It’s a good place to stay. Feeling late is enough
And because I have been to Fantawild, Shanghai Disney, and Japan Disney before, I feel that there is no need to go to this park. The park is very hot during the day, so be sure to bring sun protection.
You must rent a car to go to the park, and the rental car can only be rented at the entrance and must be returned at the entrance. It costs 150 yuan per hour. If it exceeds 1 minute, it will be counted as one hour. We spent exactly 3 hours
It's still okay if you drop by. Fireworks and ironworks at night are still okay.

If you are not staying during the Spring Festival, the price is still acceptable. A dedicated butler can solve many problems. Overall quite satisfied

msg:Chris**as was spent here. The three families played together with their children. The experience was particularly good and almost perfect. So during the Spring Festival, we booked here again for the elderly and children to spend the first day of the 30th year in a full a**osphere. Let me talk about the shortcomings first. I had a good impression of hygiene before, but this time I checked in with a small flaw. There was a bit of offset printing residue on the toilet seat from the disposable toilet seat used by previous guests. I hope it will be noticed. What's more, there are all advantages. In the case of a surge in holiday crowds, the hotel staff without exception maintained a highly professional service enthusiasm and did not have a cold face. This compares to the feeling of staying at Atlantis during the Spring Festival. Moreover, the hotel package is extremely cost-effective, there are not too many people, and the experience is better. During the peak period of the Spring Festival, Yalong Bay is much more fragrant than Haitang Bay. The hotel's various facilities, including meals, still maintain a high level. It is completely understandable that occasionally the service cannot keep up with the increase in passenger flow. The staff are trying their best to serve the guests as well as possible. The food in the hotel is very good. The ingredients are fresh and taste great. The elderly and children are satisfied with the food. The bedding is also very comfortable. The large sofa bed in the room is amazing. It can sleep an adult and the bed is made for free. During this trip, our three-year-old brother had been suffering from diarrhea and had obvious symptoms of dehydration on the morning of the first day of the new year. After telling the housekeeper Mik, she immediately coordinated and delivered sugar and salt apples in time. After the child's condition improved, the restaurant asked the restaurant to make other menu items. The meal was not charged, I was very touched. I am very grateful to the restaurant and Mik who provided help, as well as Mik’s superior who did not know your last name when I called. Thank you again. I stayed in the hotel for three days and two nights, and enjoyed parent-child programs, Happy World, and Nanhai Train. My family had a very fulfilling time. Especially suitable for bringing the elderly and children. It is also recommended that you stay at least two days to enjoy yourself.

msg:The hotel has a simple and distinctive appearance, which is even more beautiful at night. Before the Spring Festival, I chose this hotel because of the nearby Ocean Paradise. The scenery was indeed beautiful, but the service was really mediocre. It took a long time to check in and the lobby was a mess. Anyway, it doesn’t matter if you play by yourself, basically you don’t need too many services. The room is very nice, relatively large, with a terrace, which children like. The catering is really average. Chinese food is very expensive and not delicious. Generally, the Chinese food in five-star hotels is very good. I won’t comment too much here. The breakfast is very average, with few varieties, and it’s 10:30 in the morning. There is still a queue (breakfast ends at 11 o'clock). Because there are few varieties, there will be a lot of queues for popular gatherings. Guests who come in queue up to wait for their meals and will not be able to get out for a while. Guests outside have been queuing up and there are no vacancies. , I had the same breakfast for 5 days, it was really annoying. The only meal on the New Year’s Eve night was the buffet barbecue, there was no choice. The hotel is far away from the city. In short, more joy is brought by the amusement park, and the children are happy good

I waited until three o'clock to ask, and was told that the room type I had booked was not available yet, so they would upgrade me to a family room. I reluctantly agreed in order to check in quickly. As a result, it's not an upgrade at all, it's a downgrade. Is this deceptive check-in the work of Hyatt? It was originally the luxurious sea view that gave me the illusion. The VIP Club has also been turned into a children's playground! Of course, there are also many consumer items such as gashapon machines and claw machines. The service couldn't keep up. A so-called butler added me on WeChat without saying a word. This kind of service awareness. . . There are no services such as turning down the bed, and cleaning is done in a careless manner.
You have to queue up for breakfast and have to grab food. The breakfast bar of the Business Express Hotel. Public health is also particularly poor. The beaches are all black sand. Won't come again

msg:Very bad experience~
The first time I stayed in a hotel, I found that I had to queue for breakfast. I queued for an hour and had breakfast for five minutes. It was a big mistake~ The hotel staff said it was because of the peak meal period, but this is no longer a problem during the peak period, it is the hotel management. Unfortunately, the restaurant capacity cannot satisfy the guests~
In addition, the hygiene of the hotel is not good and the sheets are not clean. Also, the garbage bag bin was not covered with garbage bags. Also, the hotel's meals are ridiculously expensive, a small cake costs 58 yuan~ Also, the efficiency is extremely low. Not only is check-in slow, but the complimentary Nanhai train ticket requires two trips back and forth to complete... …
Stayed for 2 nights and spent 3k➕. The service was far inferior to the price.

I have to say that after 11 days in Hainan, Hyatt's service is the best among hotels of the same level. The service status makes me feel a little flattered.
Environment: The overall environment is very good, and the guest rooms are also very good. Except for the hotel's own beach, which is not as good as expected, everything else is pretty good.

Service: Needless to say, the service is really satisfactory. Although I don’t know why there seem to be so many negative reviews for a certain potato, I personally think it is still very good.
Catering: There are many guests for breakfast in the morning, so it’s not a big deal as long as you get up a little early for breakfast, otherwise you may have to wait for a table if you come down late. Dinner is a special dinner on Chris**as Eve, although it is more expensive than usual. It is also a great value for money. No matter whether it is breakfast or dinner, the color, smell and taste are very good, especially the various cakes for the Chris**as dinner, which are super delicious! ! ! Beautiful and delicious! !
last of the last! Once again, I would like to commend my caring housekeeper by name: Belle! ! 😘😘

It takes a long time to walk from here to there. The breakfast here is very rich, but the breakfast variety in the conference hall is less. No wonder everyone is queuing up in the coffee shop, but in the conference hall There's just no one around. There are many activities in the hotel, but some fun ones, such as paddle boarding, need to be reserved in advance. It is best to make an appoin**ent 2 days in advance. There are too many people and it is easy to fail to make an appoin**ent. In addition, the pool bubble party and bonfire party are also more fun, and the children have a lot of fun. There is also a fireworks show next to the Ferris wheel in the amusement park on weekend evenings. You can also see it from the hotel lawn, but it is on the side of the fireworks, so the effect is not as good. It is best to see it in the amusement park. I went to the amusement park on Monday. There were very few people and there were basically no queues for any of the activities. It was very comfortable. However, the most unique thing here was the performance at the aquarium, especially the performance by the four mermaids. It was very beautiful and romantic, and the best I have ever seen. The best among several cities, we watched it twice. Finally, the personal butler Lemon is very warm and thoughtful. If you need anything, just ask him. He helped us make appoin**ents for various activities and also gave us toiletries for the children, which was great.

Tip to avoid pitfalls, the ticket I booked was for a two-day stay and a one-day trip. The homepage at the time didn’t write it clearly. After I made the reservation, I only saw when I got to the store that it was two days’ worth of two-day trip as advertised by the hotel. activities, so I can only endure it, it’s just a scam! ! Of course, Ctrip is still good and compensates me, but I think this hotel’s behavior is quite bad! When I entered, I discovered that Water World was not open, and I didn’t see any sign anywhere that this was the second pit! If I had known, I would have gone directly to Atlantis. There are also a lot of people queuing up for breakfast between 8 and 9 o'clock. The restaurant is quite big and the breakfast categories are average. You might as well fool the kids. There are two swimming pools, both of which are small. The bubble parties and other activities are just to fool the children, and the a**osphere is average. However, the services are very enthusiastic! It is worth recommending that the fireworks show is very good. I think the best location should be in the middle of the lake next to playing in the sand. Also, you have to wait a long time to check in, and there is no management for jumping in the queue at will.

I don't know why. In the evening, I went to the front desk to inquire about some room and price related matters. Shirley at the front desk was very professional and answered the questions quickly and clearly. At that time, I was considering staying one more night. Shirley was very considerate and gave me various options to choose from, and also provided me with a late check-out. Give me plenty of time to consider if I need an extra night. Although the children were too tired in the end and we didn't stay longer, we were still very grateful to Shirley. The parent-child room is highly recommended, especially suitable for families with two children. Our babies are not very old, and the playground is enough for them to play. It is very convenient to stay in a hotel and play in the park. My child fell asleep in the stroller rented by the park. I pushed the stroller back to the hotel directly, put down the sleeping child, and then pushed the stroller back to return it.

msg:I decided to go to Sanya for a weekend at the last minute. I found a two-day package at Lingshui Ocean Paradise. I saw that it was suitable for children, so I decided to book it immediately. I searched it on Xiaohongshu and found mixed reviews. I was a little nervous at first.
Before departure, the hotel housekeeper Belle called to confirm the itinerary, asked if we had children with us, helped us upgrade the room type, and also prepared children's supplies. Later, I discovered that there is a package for parent-child rooms with tickets. I had previously booked a basic room without tickets, so I asked to add money to upgrade. The housekeeper Belle was very considerate and directly helped me upgrade to a parent-child room for free. The tickets can be added on site at the hotel. Yes, and you can also enjoy a 25% discount on two additional tickets on site. After the discount, the tickets are only about 212, which is almost the same as the price sold by Xianyu. Moreover, if you buy it at the hotel, you can enter and exit multiple times on the same day. This is indeed very convenient. After we went rafting on Rusty Mountain in the afternoon, we were soaked all over, so we went back to the hotel and took a shower before going to the park to watch the fireworks at the nightclub.
Just speaking from personal experience, I am very satisfied. All the hotel staff I met were greeted with smiles. Maybe we were lucky and did not encounter any comments online saying that the service was not good enough. There were welcome fruits in the room and at night. Tremella soup, after staying for two days, it was neatly tidied up on the second day. Anyway, I didn't find anything interesting.
I drove myself in Hainan during the Chinese New Year last year. The hotels I met along the way were all very good. They upgraded their room types almost all the way. Each hotel provided very good services. I originally planned to praise them one by one when I returned home, but then something happened. I was delayed because of my illness. Even now I can’t remember the details when I review them one by one. I only have an overall good impression. Of course, except for the food, there really isn’t much food in Sanya that suits my appetite. Maybe I didn’t find the right place. It feels like a food desert, haha.

The concierge Chen at the door has a very good service attitude! They were very helpful in booking a car and carrying luggage. The young lady who checked in at the front desk was feeling unwell, maybe she had a cold. My personal suggestion is to wear a mask because there are many children staying. The service staff in the restaurant may not be well paid and always seem unhappy.
Restaurant: The dishes are not very consistent with the quality of an old five-star hotel, and the placement of the fruit section is really awkward. The double-sided door refrigerator has a narrow space and good freshness.
Paradise: The park is obviously incomplete due to lack of funds, but there is no need to queue, and the projects can be unlimited. Additional expenses such as food and car rentals in the park are obviously slightly higher. Alas, it is understandable that the environment is not good.

The first time he played with the paddle board, he sat down first, and then tried to kneel on the second lap. Then when he got to the shore, he tried to paddle standing up, and then fell into the water. went.

There were not many people when we went to Ocean Park, so we watched all the performances as we went. Overall, it is highly recommended to come to Happy Ocean Park for a day and stay in the hotel for one or two nights.

msg:From Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay to Lingshui... I have visited the TOP5 parent-child hotels in each bay over the years with my children... I have to say that Hyatt has the best value for money during the festival. The park is full of day and night activities and lighting a**osphere, and the park is continuous The three-day drone fireworks show gave the hotel a lot of points... New Year's Day check-in and the park were full of people. Although the restaurant was a little overcrowded and the reception capacity was tight😂, the hotel's comprehensive service awareness was still good. Special thanks to the butler Victor for his warm service. From the housekeeper contact before check-in to the communication at the store and the follow-up service during the stay, the service is very good. Details and patience determine everything. It is not easy for Hainan Family Hotel to achieve such a service level during the holidays... Personally, I feel that the price, facilities and services are comprehensively experienced. Compared with the older hotels in Yalong Bay that are overcrowded and too lazy to provide services, it is much more cost-effective hahaha... The facilities in the Yalong Bay hotel are too old, but there are many activities that children like... Atlantis in Haitang Bay For kindergarten children, the price is 2,000 to 3,000 per night, it is crowded and noisy, and there are really few activities to play in the Water World Aquarium, which is more suitable for older children and adults... In general, in comparison, I Kindergarten kids like my daughter are more suitable for the content of R&F Ocean Fun World 😂😂 Playing through 11 projects in a day, until I was exhausted and didn’t want to go back to the hotel... I watched 4 marine animal performances in half a day, including dolphins, sea lions, walruses, and beluga whales , Mermaid is not the same, and it is more conscientious. Although it is full of people during the New Year's Day holiday, there is no long queue for each item. The queue for popular items is 10 minutes, and you can play other items if you go there. The experience is better than other parks... Experience After queuing up under the scorching sun at Disney and Yate😑😑 I feel that the R&F holiday experience is really good... But there is one thing to say, as soon as the holiday is over, the operation of the park facilities immediately decreases, and the experience on the 2nd is obviously not as good as the holiday 😂😂 Maybe it’s because the tourists are so nervous Minus it, the Ferris wheel night view in the park is closed at night, and the hotel buffet size has also been reduced... It is instantly deserted... I can't help but think of the online reviews I saw before booking the room saying that the service is not good, maybe because there are too few guests during non-holidays. There are not as many bonus facilities and services as there are during the holidays 😂😂 It’s inevitable that everyone will be deserted when they come, focusing on hotel services 😂😂 In short, the New Year’s Day holiday experience was good. Before I came, I was worried that it would be bad if I stayed for 4 days in a row and the services in the previous online reviews were scrawled... But After checking in, I found the hotel to be good. There was no lack of service that I was worried about before. The park activities gave the hotel a lot of points, and the festival a**osphere was full. Maybe the hotel is constantly improving through peer interactions.

msg:The first time I came to Hainan was a family trip. This was the first stop. I was satisfied with it in every aspect. It was especially suitable for young children to play. They had a lot of fun digging in the sand, chasing the sea, and watching rabbits. There were also open-air cartoon screenings in the evening. Thank you to the housekeeper Ivy Zheng Xuemin for contacting me in advance and answering questions/providing assistance throughout the process. The room is very new and clean, and the design and layout are very reasonable. The fireworks with the Ferris wheel and the train in the background are particularly beautiful.

msg:The design style of the hotel is very beautiful. The combination of pure white and green lawn with blue sky, white clouds and green lawn is very healing and full of holiday a**osphere. Located in the bay, there is no particularly strong sea breeze and it is not very humid.

The room is large enough and well designed. The bathroom, toilet and shower bath are specially separated for the convenience of family members.

The guest rooms and public areas are cleaned promptly and in place, and the towels and toiletries are also disinfected cleanly.

In terms of service, the housekeeper will contact the guest before check-in to introduce some hotel facilities, hotel catering, and hotel activities in advance. The housekeeper Stephen is very dedicated and takes his job very seriously. Stephen also patiently helped me quickly solve the problems and needs I encountered during my stay. Check-in also comes with a welcome cake, CDF shopping vouchers, Sea World ticket discount coupons, and travel photography follow-up services. Stephen also arranged for the catering depar**ent to help provide sweet soup, papaya, wolfberry, white fungus milk ~ delicious and heart-warming.

In terms of catering, there are children’s exclusive lunch and dinner. The chef’s cooking skills are very good and the children will be happy to eat🥳

This is a family trip for us. The hotel has an indoor children's playground, is very close to Sea World, and has exclusive entrance and exit channels. We can spare 2-3 days to visit Sea World. The hotel's swimming pool also has activities for the children to have fun with, and the hotel has also arranged a variety of activities for guests to choose from.

Already looking forward to our next trip.

The butler Hebbe's service is very considerate and he will confirm the check-in time and room type with me in advance. We also arranged a viewing room where you can see the fireworks, with a panoramic view of the entire hotel and the park. After having a rest at night, they asked me about our check-in situation. I was told about the park situation and the tax-free discounts that I wanted to know most. I also gave me sugar water when I came back from the park in the evening. All the staff in the hotel were very polite and friendly. What a lovely park-themed hotel❤️ Unfortunately, Saturday was very popular, so I couldn’t make any appoin**ents for any parent-child activities, and I almost lost all my travel photos. The travel photography is very good, and the pictures are very good. If you read the comments, you can edit them, because the pictures are so good that I have to pack the negatives🎞️. I have to point out the shortcomings, that is, there was too little food, and there was nothing to order as a late-night snack. Hope to have the opportunity to come again☀️

You can watch the Ocean Park Ferris wheel and fireworks from the room. He also helped communicate about late check-out. It was a great stay experience. When bringing children to Happy Ocean Park, it is more convenient to stay in a hotel. The buffet in the hotel is also great. Unfortunately, there is no way to experience Ocean Park in winter. Wait until summer to experience it again.

We chose a twin bed, and I am very grateful to the housekeeper Belle for helping me upgrade to a family room. The room is very large, and we, two adults and one child, each occupy a bed. Full of relaxation! The large balcony allows you to watch the amu*****t park scenery and mountain views during the day, and watch the fireworks at 8:40 pm. The children are very happy!
Hygiene: Very good! It's neat and tidy, and the aunties are smiling and very dedicated.
Environment: Unreserved praise, praise, praise
Confirmed, I think it is the most cost-effective hotel among family hotels in Hainan! Stay at the Hyatt Hotel and play at R&F Ocean World! If you know how to play, just play like this!

I will come back again in the future and will continue to choose Hyatt Hotel. Highly recommended! Go!

The children were reluctant to leave when they left and took a lot of photos. Don't miss it. The mermaid show, my God, it’s so beautiful that I can’t take a photo of it. The hotel service is also good. After breakfast, I took the children to climb the coconut trees and went to the beach in the evening. Haha, it’s really suitable for family travel. Finally, a special thank you to the housekeeper. Belle, contacted us in advance and took care of us meticulously throughout the whole process.

msg:I saw a lot of bad reviews online and was worried. After arriving, the entire hotel was really beautiful, worthy of being a white castle on the sea.
First of all, I would like to thank Shirley Yang at the front desk very much. She was very nice. She helped us upgrade to a parent-child room, and she also gave us a cake when she knew it was the child’s birthday. It was the first time to celebrate a birthday in a hotel. The child was super happy. It was a very worthwhile memory. I thought about the whole process. Very thoughtful. Apart from the appearance of the hotel, the first impression is the front desk. Shirley Yang's attitude is definitely worth 100 points.
Secondly, the room is very big. We are 2 adults and 2 children. The children love their cribs very much. What makes me most satisfied is that the bathroom and bathroom are separated, which I love very much. The room also has a large balcony, which is nice to sit on and relax.
Then, the hotel will have different parent-child activities at each time period, which are in line with the parent-child standards of Sanya hotels. The children really liked the bubble bath in the afternoon; it rained heavily the next morning, and the staff of the children's playground also gave away free building blocks for the children. It feels really great to kill time.
Finally, every waiter in the hotel has a super good attitude. No matter where they meet, they will greet each other cordially and have a good impression.
The only drawback of the hotel is that there is no food around, but the set meals in the hotel are quite cost-effective and taste good. There will also be a barbecue party in the evening, and the price is not bad. You can sit there and have barbecue and watch the fireworks show. it's actually very good. Both adults and children were very happy and will definitely go there next time.

It's not very convenient to eat nearby, and the nearest one is about 10km away. The hotel arranged a lot of parent-child activities, and I participated in crab catching at night that day. On the second day, we also participated in climbing coconut trees and making shell bracelets.

There is not much to eat nearby. Apart from eating in the hotel, you can also order takeout, but there are not many options.
I have already recommended it to my friends to play together again during the winter vacation~

The quality and maintenance of the rooms are very good. The butler-style service is very impressive. Shu Xin, special thanks to Belle for her careful care. There are not many breakfast varieties among five-star hotels, but everything tastes good, especially the Western snacks. The hotel's beach is an inland sea type, so it's not nice to take pictures, but it's great for families. You can dig crabs during the day and catch starfish at night. Cooperating with R&F Amu*****t Park, arranging a two- or three-day itinerary here will make it very comfortable for both children and adults. If I want to make some suggestions for improvement, it is that the location is relatively remote, so prepare children's favorite snacks in advance. Among the dinners in the hotel cafe, Western food is better, and Chinese food is not recommended. It is not the same, too sweet, and the taste needs to be improved.

I was initially attracted by the castle-like appearance, so I spent two nights in the Ctrip live broadcast room. I didn't expect many surprises after checking in. First of all, the service attitude is very good. Whether it is the butler Stephen or other hotel employees, they will greet the guests proactively and speak softly to the guests, which is heart-warming. The hotel facilities are fully equipped, clean and comfortable, and there are also There is considerate free white fungus soup delivered to the room, and the hotel swimming pool has a great experience. There are also activities for children to climb coconut trees, catch crabs at the beach in the evening, hand-knit, and feed rabbits and pigeons. Breakfast is very rich in Chinese and Western food, and almost all special breakfasts from all over the country are available. Yes, you can eat at 10:30, which is very nice and very friendly to guests who like to sleep in. The most amazing thing is that there is a free large-scale fireworks show opposite the Happy World at night. We stayed for two nights and there were fireworks on both nights. .
Of course, there are disadvantages. It is still quite far from the places to eat in town. Although there is a hotel, I personally think the price is a bit expensive. However, those who drive can ignore it. It only takes 20 minutes to drive to Haiyun Plaza and there is a lot to eat. .
I will arrange it once every few years, and I will arrange it at the Hyatt Hotel. (Absolutely not a drag, a sincere recommendation)

I will definitely bring my children to play again when I have children in the future. After a day of playing, the young man from the concierge said: He took the initiative to help us carry our luggage to the room. The service attitude was very good. I must give it a thumbs up. The breakfast was also good. The overall service attitude was very good.

During the whole process, she patiently answered and solved any needs and questions. Thank you! 👍The hotel's scenery, rooms, supporting facilities, and the surrounding water world and sea world are nothing to say. We can enjoy the water world on the first day and the sea world on the second day. We can have fun in one place a day. The service attitudes of Allen, the front desk staff, and Aina, the western restaurant staff, make people feel like they are at home. The family members said that they really feel the feeling of warm service here, and they like them very much. If you bring children, you need to stay here for at least three days and two nights. Although there are no other shopping malls around, you can also call for takeaway, which is quite convenient.

The breakfast is also very comfortable, mainly because of the good environment. There is a VIP channel next to the amu*****t park. There is no limit to the number of times you can enter a day, which is very convenient. There are not many people in the amu*****t park, so you can play whatever you want with no limit on the number of times. The butler Stephen's attentive and attentive service made me feel very warm. I really like it. I will bring my children here to play in the future. I'm so happy!

msg:It was my first time to stay at the Hyatt Regency Lingshui Fuli Bay. Before I arrived, the hotel housekeeper Heidi immediately contacted me to arrange a room in advance. The hotel is a large entertainment complex, and the housekeeper was very considerate and helped me list many activities. Unfortunately, Due to the bad weather and constant rain, it was a pity that we didn’t get to play any activities. Since it was the off-season, there were not many guests staying in the hotel, so it was equivalent to a private room. The breakfast buffet provided by the cafe on the third floor of the hotel was very good, although the breakfast was not very good. It's rich, but you can see that the chef is very careful in producing the food. The food is very delicious and exquisite. I’ll come back for a second visit next time I have a chance. It’s worth recommending.

This price is really not worth it at all. As soon as you open the door, there is a strong decoration smell. It’s particularly uncomfortable. The food in the restaurant is also quite expensive. The taste is really average. Generally speaking, people who have requirements for hotels should be cautious. The location of the hotel is very remote and there is basically no takeout. It is very inconvenient to eat. , apart from being close to the amu*****t park, there seems to be no advantage. The service of the girl at the front desk is still good. I asked to upgrade to a sea view room, and she upgraded me for free. However, the sea view room costs more than 1,000 per night without breakfast, which is quite expensive. It’s a good deal, so those who have requirements for hotels must be cautious.

I was going to the gym in the morning and the customer service told me that it would only open at 10 o'clock. There were a lot of people looking for breakfast with plates. For guests with empty tables, all the tables are empty. Communicate with the waiter. No one will pay attention to you. I have no choice but to clear the dishes and wipe the table by myself. After receiving the coffee, I found that there is no milk and the bread is cold. I am ready to leave. When I arrived, there were four tour groups blocking the entrance. Everyone was blocking the entrance and exit, and they took the children and squeezed for a long time before they could get out. I really won’t go there again next time.

He added WeChat in advance to help arrange the room and apply for an extension. There were also various concerns and inquiries in the process. It really made people feel at home. The housekeeper who is very competent and attentive must give her a manual thumbs up; the hotel is located a little far away and it is inconvenient to eat and buy things, so it is best for everyone to bring more snacks. The prices at the hotel canteen are very expensive, about three times the outside price. There is an additional charge. The price is okay, but three times does feel a bit too much. I hope this can be improved; the hotel catering is slightly expensive, but I think the quality is still good. My son loves to eat it and orders this every day.

     A small request for the hotel is that whether it is the guest room bathroom or the park bathroom, it is best to equip the child with a hand-washing stool. Otherwise, he is not tall enough and washing hands will be too laborious! Ha ha

1. After driving to the store, the receptionist at the door had no intention of helping us with our luggage. He just kept urging us to drive away quickly, and finally pushed the luggage cart over after urging us four times;
2. When a family stays, disposable toiletries are only given to one person and will not be replaced even on the second day of stay;
3. After returning from swimming, the door card suddenly failed to come out in the elevator. I asked two waiters passing by to help me with the card, but they said no and asked me to go to the lobby and try it again! We had just come back from swimming and were soaked to the skin. The front desk did not distinguish between check-in and check-out guests or other types of guests. They insisted that I wait in line for ten minutes before helping me re-register. The suspected foreman surnamed Zhu even made fun of me. Is this kind of person trained by Hyatt? ?
4. The swimming pool charges for even a small swimming ring, which is really stingy, and the bottom of the swimming pool is full of black dirt, making it worrisome for hygiene.
5. The waiters on the whole have no enthusiasm for hospitality. They smile and greet the guests without being polite.

Although the buffet breakfast is good, it cannot cover up the shortcomings of poor service, remote location, and zero catering and commercial facilities!

Everyone should be careful about this big pit!

Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is good. It’s quite new. I booked a parent-child room in Paradise. The room is quite large. The balcony (Figure 8) is a bit confusing.

Hygiene: Clean and comfortable, the air conditioner is sufficient in such hot weather

Service: poor service attitude
Check in at 12:00 and go to the 3rd floor to wait for the room card. Wait until 4 o'clock in the afternoon to get the room card, which is a complete waste of time
Check-in did not take the initiative to inform the time and place of breakfast, it was called before the meal the next day
When I checked in, I provided a QR code so that I could take pictures. I didn’t tell any other information. I went to the water park to know that I had to go back to a certain place in the hotel to exchange tickets. I stood at the door for 45 minutes in the scorching sun before helping to deal with it (the countdown picture 2)

Facilities: I don’t know what facilities are in the hotel, I didn’t inform you when I checked in
There is a car to take you to and from the water park, you need to queue up, the car is obviously not enough

Free · 2 adults and 1 child can play unlimited times in the Ocean Water Park on the day/night (children under 1.4m): adults do not play in the water, and there are very few items for children to play in the water. 2 tickets are added

1⃣️Is it because I only stay for one night that I am not worthy of the noble service of the butler? Until I checked out, the legendary butler didn't come to add me on WeChat. Then don't tell me that the housekeeper will add me. If you need anything, please ask the housekeeper, otherwise I will make an appoin**ent for the airport bus when I check in.
2⃣️The housekeeper waited until 11:00 p.m. and no one added me, so I had to find a phone from Ctrip to make an appoin**ent for the airport bus, and told me: there are no seats in the afternoon. Reason: You should make an appoin**ent early. I wanted to get angry at that moment, but I endured it.
3⃣️The child was sick in the middle of the night and had a headache, so he had to find a phone number from Ctrip and call the hotel for help. A girl at the front desk answered the phone, and after talking for a long time, it meant that he could not help. Either go to the hospital (more than 10 kilometers away from Lingshui County) or buy medicine by himself ( I said that there is no way to buy it with the child alone) The reply was still very sorry and I had no choice, and begged her to report to the leader again, so I hung up the phone and asked me to wait for a reply. I'm really surprised, such a big hotel plus a paradise, there is no infirmary, and there is no antipyretic medicine, so wait for the sudden serious illness👼.
4⃣️**Find a pharmacy that is open, and add errand fees to let the store deliver the medicine, which shows that the child has a terrible headache. It takes 20 minutes from ordering to delivery for a 3-kilometer journey, but it took more than 10 minutes to deliver the room from the front desk. I even called once to urge him.
5⃣️Let's talk about the room, it is considered poor at the same price.
The summary is that the service is extremely poor and the facilities are poor.
Will never go again.
Also: You can only see a little bit of the paradise when you look at it sideways.

msg:The room facilities are average. Although the hotel is newly opened, it is not very classy. There are too many children, but there are no children's toiletries prepared in advance. The hotel does not really have a beach. Breakfast is ordered by time, which is one of the core points where the conflict intensifies. You can watch the drone show and fireworks at the hotel at night!

msg:I stayed in connecting rooms 7003 and 7005. The decoration is relatively new. The balcony of the room is at a perfect angle to watch the fireworks at night and the sea and trains during the day. The hotel is very close to the amusement park. Sea World and Water Park are also suitable for children. Renting a battery car is not tiring. The hotel receptionist, front desk, cleaning aunt, swimming pool manager, and restaurant staff all provided very good service. If I left something at the hotel, they thoughtfully sent it to my home. The meals in the guest room are generous and delicious. Compared with Atlantis, it is more suitable for younger children. The room price is cheap but the service is not bad at all and the price-performance ratio is very high. It is not as crowded as the commercial a**osphere of Haitang Bay. There are so many, the hotel is very close to various scenic spots, surfing, and fishing rafts. You can reach every scenic spot within 30 minutes by car. This is a very pleasant and great stay experience!

msg:The comment system can only be general by default. But what I want to give is a bad review for the service! ! ! Bought a package of hotel accommodation and water world. The staff at the front desk of the park in the hotel said that the purchased children's tickets cannot be used for over height, and they cannot make up the difference to exchange for adult tickets, and must buy adult tickets again. If you are too tall, then buy an adult ticket according to the rules, which is no problem; but when you enter the park, you are told that there are several classic quotation single-player events that children cannot play because they are not enough weight! For safety considerations, this is no problem, safety first! Then I would like to ask the hotel paradise, when you sell adult tickets for children, why don't you explain in advance that some items have weight requirements? ! If you sell an adult ticket to an 11-year-old child, you must fully consider it. Since there are restrictions on children, you should sell student tickets or give a full explanation when buying tickets! Called customer service and was told it couldn't be solved! This is your solution! Let’s talk about the hotel’s service issues: I did have a phone call to confirm check-in one day in advance, and I reserved a phone call to ask how many people were checking in, and made it clear that a housekeeper would add WeChat later to solve problems and needs that occurred during the check-in process. I didn't see your housekeeper add WeChat until you left the store, so why bother to waste time and energy when you make this call just to go through the motions? ! But there is one thing to say: the sanitation is satisfactory, the room is clean, and the staff in charge of sanitation are amiable; the environment: meals can only be eaten in the hotel, and there is no food near the hotel. The distance to the park is convenient, and there is no need to queue up at the water world at night. It is really convenient to have a shuttle bus; but the mosaic glass in the hotel swimming pool peels off a lot, and the children picked up a lot from the bottom of the pool when they were playing, so as not to cut tourists. The entire hotel area felt like management was in disarray. When I checked out and scanned my parking ticket, the front desk was surrounded by two tourists from the park who had complained.

msg:There is nothing to say about the interior design of the parent-child room! Children's favorite!
There is nothing to say about the two major paradises, and you will not get tired of staying for two to three days.
Breakfast and dinner are okay.
There are many things that need to be improved, and there are many slots:
1. The check-in experience is slow, slow, slow: check-in queued for 40 minutes, and there was only one group of people in front😓 The guests in the front also had problems wondering whether they should go to the water world or not, and it took a long time. Extremely inefficient. The counter of the water park opened and the hotel staff brought them to jump in the queue. This kind of service is unheard of! Is it vvip? There is no concept of queuing first come first served at all. There are also managers who deal with tourists doing things, and employees who are lazy and do not work are all manifestations of inefficiency, poor professional quality, and poor management level. It took less than an hour to check in. Is this the speed of Hyatt? Another five-star hotel in Lingshui that I went to during this trip took only 10 minutes to check in!
2. Staff indifference and poor professional ability: After staying for two nights, none of the staff served with a smile and took the initiative to say hello. There is no warm and friendly service in the hotel. The service of the resort hotel is simple, please strengthen staff training and management.
3. Rough management ignores details: There are no free bath towels or towels to keep out the cold in the water park. You must bring them from the hotel, but there are no reminders along the way from the hotel reception, room, hotel to the entrance of the park. If you forget your bath towels and bathrobes, you need to go to and from the hotel to pick them up or buy hundreds of bath towels in the store. If you go back to pick them up, you will encounter the problem of fewer shuttle buses and long queues! It was a little cold in the evening on the day I went, and after getting wet, I returned to get a towel, which caused a friend who was traveling with a fever to delay the next day's trip to Ocean Paradise. During the peak hours, the shuttle bus also has lazy employees who wander around and do not take the initiative to pick up tourists. The direction of the road in the Ocean Paradise is not clear, which leads to detours in the opposite direction under the scorching sun after entering the park. The float parade in the park was a bit boring, and the ip in the park was not used.
4. The beach can only be seen from a distance and not played indecently: no comment but experience by yourself.
Make some comments and hope the hotel can improve, otherwise it is a pity that such a good resource will be lost.

msg:I want to give an evaluation of this trip: that is, the whole process is indifferent, and the restaurant service is in vain. If there is no Ms. Tina, the front office staff, in this trip, I believe this trip will definitely be a bad review.

At first, I wasted this benefit because I didn’t use Ctrip’s hotel vouchers. Later, I negotiated with Ctrip and the hotel’s sales depar**ent, and said that I would re-order and then cancel it. The hotel is on vacation. Later, the manager agreed to upgrade the Paradise View Room for free, so I thought that was all. After all, there is a price difference for the upgrade, so let’s leave it at that.

Check in later, good guy?! The room was arranged for me at the end of the corner, the floor is still low, I can’t accept this room for two nights, and the promised Paradise View room has a coffee machine, but the switchboard staff said that only a few have it , there is a trickery. To be honest, I really want to return it, it's so heartwarming.

In line with the idea of ​​at least "communicating and striving" when everyone is here, I was lucky to meet Ms. Tina in the front hall. Her service made me feel sincere and real, without too many stereotypes, and she is what she is. , I was also arranged for a high-floor room that I wanted, with a wide view and a good mood at the same time.

Because the hotel is far from the city, so I experienced the buffet, 298 yuan/person. I mentioned that the pork belly that was grilled was not fresh, and a supervisor later replied that the pork was delivered on the same day. Do you think I should trust my taste buds, or do you think your words are watery? I didn't even take the ingredients from the barbecue side to avoid stomach discomfort. After all, I have to stay outside for a few days. The supervisor's answer was just an answer. I instantly felt that the service of a five-star hotel, as I thought, was not as good as Haidilao.
This kind of customer service also makes me feel that I will never come again, it is not five-star at all.
The breakfast in the morning for two consecutive days was crowded with people, it was horrible, and it was the first time I saw such a big battle after the epidemic. Seeing that the waiters are very tired, I can only finish eating silently and leave quickly, so as not to cause trouble to others.

There is also the Nanhai train, which is really a scam. Is there an IQ tax? That's all. So it’s not cost-effective to test this personally, whoever sits will regret it, it’s better to leave money for self-service.

Finally, let me talk about a very bad feeling. The employees of the hotel wear their own shoes, not clean and tidy work clothes, which makes me feel that the hotel is full of interns. Moreover, the shoes of some employees are also dirty, especially those in the restaurant, and they lose their appetite instantly.

So after the whole process, my feeling is that Ms. Tina in the front office saved my five-star praise for the hotel and praised Tina for her sincerity and heart. Hope to meet you next time I go to your hotel. To Come! !

msg:Won't stay in this hotel again
The Hyatt brand is overall good, and should at least be worth 4 stars, but I only gave it 3 stars. I wanted to give it 2 and a half stars, but I didn't get this option.
Eating: Breakfast can be overwhelming, there are limited seats indoors, and it’s extremely hot outside. Even though it's so hot outside, there's still no room to dine. The dishes are also relatively rich and the choices are pretty good. Lunch and dinner are quite inconvenient. Hotel lunch and dinner are very expensive in scenic spots. Recently, we have to take a taxi to Li'an Town. There are several restaurants in the town to eat, and Wanghai Hotel is good. After dinner in the evening, I wanted to take a taxi back to the hotel. I basically had to pay extra to arrange it, and I couldn't get a taxi for half an hour.
Beach: There is a small beach below the hotel. The sand is average and not too fine.
Accommodation: I booked a family room, which was spacious.
Overall, I don’t recommend this hotel very much. The hotel mainly works with Water World, and the price is really low. A two-night stay costs nearly 3k. Check-in was very chaotic. Check-in was after 3 o'clock and check-out was at 12 o'clock. Before check-in, their staff also called to ask about check-in requirements. I asked the hotel to add WeChat but they didn't agree. The phone call from the hotel was of no use. It was just a step-by-step process. It doesn't matter what the guests' needs are. Anyway, I asked the hotel and they couldn't do it. Doing it is another matter. You still have to call and make reservations for parent-child activities. After checking out, I received a return visit from the hotel asking if I was satisfied and asked me to upgrade my room next time. I asked directly why I wasn’t upgraded this time? Then he hung up the phone.
Water World is also very average. There are only a few items. It is recommended to stay in other nearby hotels. It is better to buy a separate ticket than the Hyatt.
When you go to the fireworks show in the evening, you can't watch it from the room. Most of them go to the hotel swimming pool to watch it. Don't look forward to the two or three minutes of fireworks.

msg:First of all, the hotel environment is good, but the experience is really poor. I booked two rooms at a price of more than 1,000 per night on Ctrip. The location of the two rooms was not good and the view was also very bad. One room was also at the back. One room, you have to walk a long way to hold the baby. The other room is upstairs. You have to book a room on the same floor. There is no room. I was told to wait for an hour, but because of the baby's problem, I have to go to two floors. You have to swipe your card to go up and down the elevator. , it’s very troublesome. The water park tickets provided by Ctrip were completely useless. It was very hot during the day and I didn’t go to play. I went to the hotel to exchange my tickets. The result was that I could only go to the water park and not the ocean park. I originally wanted to go with my children. Playing in Ocean Park, it turned out to be a water park. You have to buy a ticket to enter Ocean Park, so I advise everyone to make a plan before coming, otherwise people like me will spend money in vain and not play. Ctrip has it Once the ticket is redeemed, it can only be used once. After using Ctrip for so many years, I have a lot of complaints about Ctrip. This time I complained again. It is very inconvenient to eat here. There are only a few places that can deliver takeaways. Breakfast is overcrowded. , there were too many people, and we went down very late. There were so many people, like the vegetable market, and the breakfast varieties were meager and there was nothing to eat. In short, I don’t recommend everyone to come to this hotel. If you spend more than 1,000 yuan, you can go to Weiss Ting, Sheraton, Hilton are all fine, this time I am very disappointed with Hyatt

The hotel is clean, tidy and warm, with a Mediterranean➕California style. The service staff is also very good. I would like to thank Shirley Yang, the front desk supervisor, for helping me with the troublesome operation of the upgrade. I really think about what the customer thinks and thinks what the customer thinks! King Kent is also very nice, and it is convenient to complete the exchange efficiently.

The water world is very similar to Atlantis, although it’s not that big. , but it is enough for children. I like the swimming pool inside the hotel very much. The lights are beautiful and clean at night. Although it is an inland sea, the beach is also enough for some children to dig sand. The buffet is also good. Sitting outdoors, you can see the fireworks at 8:50. It is very wise to choose a parent-child room for children. The two children can sleep well. Special thanks to the housekeeper Heidi, who gave a lot of suggestions and tips at the right time. I look forward to coming again next time .

There are crab leg-like shells on the bed! I used the room phone to call the hotel front desk but no answer! I called three times using the number I found on Ctrip and waited for an hour before changing the room!
2. The service is completely annoying! Booked this hotel for two paradises! Specially booked package for two days, two parks, two large and two small! It turned out that the park didn’t close until 9 o’clock on the day of check-in! But when we arrived at eight o'clock, the hotel staff told us to go back tomorrow! Tickets cannot be exchanged now! What a waste of a day ticket! Get up early the next morning and exchange your ticket at the front desk! Obviously the hotel has a parking lot very close by! Less than a few hundred meters! The hotel staff asked us to drive ourselves? Or Didi? ? ! We exchanged tickets together at the front desk to go to the small train that requires additional expenses at our own expense, so we entered smoothly! As a result, I went to another park to watch fireworks at night! The staff told me that the hotel did not successfully exchange my ticket for me! I showed the ticket purchase QR code and ID card to the staff! The staff actually asked me to wait at the door after taking pictures! He said he didn’t have the hotel’s phone number and sent it to the WeChat group! Wait until they reply before letting me know? ? ? It looks like the park is closing again! I called the hotel myself and asked them to contact us. The staff kept saying, "Okay, wait a minute..." Finally, the park staff I asked for let us in within the last five minutes! What a crushing experience! ! !

I went to get it four times after 3:00 (each time I had to queue for more than 20 minutes). They said that the room was not available and they didn't give me an answer. I got angry at about 5:30 before they arranged a room for us. Very ** service! As a five-star hotel, it costs more than 1,000 yuan a night. I checked out from 15:00 to 12:00 the next day, and I only enjoyed the hotel for about 21 hours. However, your hotel is still dragging its feet in work efficiency, resulting in slow check-in, poor service attitude, simple room decoration style, poor buffet breakfast, average hotel facilities, ** can't order takeout, and tickets for the amusement park can only be bought at the hotel for unlimited entry and exit. The overall performance is very poor! It's not worth the price! (More than 1,000 room fees + 800 tickets for a family of three to the amusement park) Pit pit pit! At the same time, I was also very disappointed with Ctrip on this trip. For more than ten years, I have only chosen Ctrip, including all products of Hainan Island this time: air tickets, hotels, car rentals, tickets! This ticket is the worst product I have purchased on Ctrip! The ticket I bought on Ctrip only allows me to enter the park once on the same day (because I booked the Hyatt Hotel in R&F), but the ticket I bought from the hotel allows me to enter and exit the park unlimited times on the same day. I called customer service to ask if they could coordinate! They said they would reply to me at a certain time, but they never replied! I am extremely disappointed with Ctrip, as I always thought its service quality was great!

Later, Ctrip and the hotel reached an agreement that we would reopen We decided to check in on August 7th, so we refunded the room on the 30th, and asked the child if there was anything better. Checking in the room was good, especially the washbasin in the bathroom is where I think the details are in place. There is also a service at the door to help deliver luggage to the room, and a small piece of fruit is also sent, but the hotel is not very soundproof , the children upstairs were more excited and danced and tossed for a long time at night before they calmed down and affected the rest downstairs. There is also a children's bed in the hotel, but it is too short, and the child bumps his head carefully and pastes it transparently on the top. The children did not pay attention , After checking in, I was very happy to go to the small bed, stand up and hit my head in less than 5 minutes. In the past two days, I have a headache, dizziness and nausea, and our parents are very worried about a slight concussion. Therefore, all parents with children must pay attention to this height. My child hit his head directly when he was less than 1.4 meters! ! ! And it was swollen on the spot. We didn't talk to the hotel about it. After all, we thought it would be good to apply ice compresses, but the children were not very interested in playing these two days and always said they were dizzy.

msg:The room is relatively small, compared to other Hainan sea view hotels, the gap is relatively large. It is considered to take children to play in the sea world and water world. The hotel is newly repaired, the equipment is very new, and the things are relatively complete, but many of the equipment are obviously problematic. When checking in in the afternoon, there were a lot of people and it was chaotic, and it took a long time to wait. The guy at the front desk is not bad. He said that there are only two twin rooms with bad views. He adjusted us to a double room on a higher floor where we can watch the fireworks. However, after we checked in, we found that there was a problem with the door, and it was difficult to open and close. We were in a hurry to play in the ocean. At the World Night Club, I asked the housekeeper to come out after the game (it was almost ten o’clock) and then went to the front desk. He said that there was no room and couldn’t change it. The engineering depar**ent came to repair it temporarily and said that there was a problem with the door cover, so we could only knock on it temporarily to improve it. The next morning, it was not easy to switch. The front desk asked the engineering depar**ent to look at it. After the master suggested changing the room, but the front desk called to confirm that it was not the master who answered the phone. Finally, the front desk asked the engineering depar**ent to see it. After changing the room, there are actually problems with the balcony door and toilet door. The changed room has a good view, but the toilet cover is also problematic. The second day of stay was the child's birthday. I called the day before check-in. The customer service said that there are too many people staying and the room cannot be furnished. You can apply for a cake, but you need to confirm the delivery time with the front desk. I confirmed the time when I checked in and every time I negotiated with the front desk. When I reminded the front desk for the last time, besides confirming the computer notes, I also took a separate paper and wrote it down, saying that I can rest assured that I will not make mistakes. As a result, when the time was not delivered, I called the room and asked the concierge to answer the call and said that I wanted to confirm, but I never called back. After waiting for almost fifteen minutes, I called again and they confirmed again that the cake was not made, and the time was too late. I can't even do it, and my attitude is cold and speechless! I went to the front desk to complain to the manager on duty, and my attitude was still very good, but there was nothing I could do when the kitchen was off work, and I couldn’t buy it outside, so I had to go back to the room and wait to see if the hotel had any other solutions. The children cried in disappoin**ent up. Later, the manager on duty knocked on the door with strawberry bears, puppet gifts, and cakes. He said that the cakes had already been prepared. I don’t know why the food delivery depar**ent didn’t deliver them. It was more responsible to find it, so that the children did not have a disappointed and sad birthday, but it was a pity that they did not achieve it when they wanted to eat cake and watch fireworks. It can be seen here that there is a big problem in the hotel's internal communication and management. The hotel's direct dial is the concierge depar**ent, but the concierge depar**ent and WeChat customer service are always asked to find the front desk. If there are too many depar**ents, communication and connection are prone to major problems, and I haven't seen it yet. What is the role of the concierge depar**ent, but I still want to praise the manager Liu Wei, he is very responsible. In addition, some of the problems mentioned in the previous comments have been significantly improved this time. For example, the staff will still say hello when they see them, and their attitudes are quite good. They have given some instructions and guidance (but still not enough), and there is no particularly exaggerated queue for meals. And there is no location, it can be seen that the hotel still wants to do a good job. The hotel is very convenient to go to the water world and the sea world. It is recommended to buy a night show or a free day ticket. You can check in at the hotel early. You may not get a room right away. We asked the customer service before that we can check in at three o'clock, but in the afternoon there were too many people checking in and waiting in line for a long time, which wasted time for night tickets and caused some projects to fail. Although the fish feeding at Sea World is written at 21:00, it actually ends at 19:30, so it is more reasonable to go to the ecological coast first, then watch the mermaid show, and then come out to play the equipment that ends at 21:00. You can visit the secret place of the South China Sea first and then watch the performance, or you can make an appoin**ent for dinner at the underwater restaurant and come out just to eat after shopping. Children in the water world like it the most. You don’t need to bring too many things to go around in it. What’s more tricky is that rafting and surfing have to be charged twice (not cheap), and the rafts used to raft are rented for free. It’s speechless ╮(╯_╰ )╭ Generally speaking, if I only play in one place, next time I will choose to live in another place and drive to play alone. If I play in two places, it is still possible to stay for one or two nights. The fireworks show is pretty good. If the view from the room is not good, you can watch it from the public balcony on the 5th floor of the hotel (the lobby floor). Hotel parking spaces are hard to find during the day, especially in the afternoon. Don’t expect to be able to charge the trams, as they are all occupied by petrol trucks and no one cares. If it weren't for the episode that happened in the middle, the personal experience evaluation would be higher, and the mousse cake tasted good (although the strawberries were very sour).

I didn’t check in until 5:00 pm. At 12 o'clock in the noon, I called to urge check-out, and it took me a long time to get an extension of 1 hour, pack up and leave! I just want to ask, how can I postpone the check-in, and have to be urged when checking out, which is very annoying! ! !
However, it is commendable that the housekeeper Kevin, after knowing my birthday, prepared a cake for me and delivered it to the room.
What's more, try to go early for breakfast, otherwise you may encounter a waiting line, and the breakfast will stop at 10:30, you need to queue up to get a meal as soon as possible, and try to pack what you need in advance before eating.

msg:In order to take the baby to R&F Ocean Paradise and Water World, I booked the Hyatt Hotel. The hotel has a shortcut to the playground, and it takes about six or seven minutes to walk there, which is very convenient. In the hotel, you can buy a one-day unlimited entry and exit ticket for Ocean Paradise. It is very friendly to families with children like me. I go in to play when the park opens in the morning, and go back to the hotel for a nap when I am tired at noon. After a rest in the afternoon, I go to the park to play until evening Fireworks show, although the ticket price is not cheap, but I feel that I have won back the ticket price after a day, and I will not be particularly tired.
I commend the hotel housekeeper Jackson (Li Liangjian) by name, for being able to quickly help me solve problems and answer questions. Finally, I criticize the hotel's breakfast. There is a queue at the entrance of the restaurant to enter the restaurant. The number of tables and chairs in the hotel restaurant is obviously different from the number of rooms. Matching, it is still the low season and you need to queue up for breakfast. I can't imagine what it will be like in the peak season. I hope the hotel can solve this problem as soon as possible.

I wanted to see small animals, but there were really too few animals, so I didn’t enjoy watching them at night 😂 I had a lot of fun in the water world. I also saw the red glow of the South China Sea. It was so healing. It was the first time I saw the sunset glow of this color! The service of Kent at the front desk of the hotel is also super good. It is very convenient to tell him if you have any needs. I also sent children's equipment to the children. The children of the little yellow duck like it very much. The overall sanitation and environmental facilities and services of the hotel are excellent. It was a great time experience~

When you open the balcony door, you will see a sea view, blue sky and white clouds on the beach, and you will feel very comfortable when you turn on the vacation mode. The hotel facilities are very new and the sanitation is also very good. Every service staff will greet customers when they see them. The hotel is close to Sea World and Water World, so kids will have a blast! My butler, Annie, is kind-hearted, sweet-talking, and responsive.

msg:A satisfying experience! The hotel customer service will call one day in advance to ask how many of our children are staying and prepare children's products for us. Thanks to shirley, the front desk supervisor, who checked us in for our considerate service and clearly explained the precautions of the park to us. There was a sister at the front desk who exchanged tickets, but she was a little absent-minded and didn't understand my appeal. Remind everyone that children under 1.2 meters can buy a child ticket of 9.9. The parent-child room has a large area and the details and hygiene are in place. The hair dryer is powerful. Complimentary coffee capsules and a minibar. The bedding is comfortable, and you can see the park and the South China Sea train from the balcony. The only shortcoming is that the air outlet of the air conditioner is directly blowing towards the head, and the minimum wind speed is still too strong. The hotel's breakfast is worth mentioning. It is rich in varieties, exquisite and delicious. There are enough places, the food is replenished quickly, and the waiters are also very active in collecting plates. There is no children's club in the hotel, and children's energy should be reserved for the water world. Although there are not many water world projects, it is enough for parents and children to play. After returning the rental cabinet, remember to apply for a refund of the deposit in the mini program. In fact, rafting does not need to rent a swimming ring, just wear a free life jacket. Nanhai train is a bit expensive, 128/person, we only sent two representatives to haha. The driving speed is very slow, mainly going around the park. The most beautiful part is the section near the sea, which is not very long. There is nothing good to eat near the hotel. If you don't mind the trouble, you can drive to the downtown shopping mall to eat. It was okay to eat the hotel's buffet dinner the next day. The two-big and two-small set meals are more cost-effective. Or the price of delivery is also acceptable. When checking out, the luggage cart was very fast and arrived in five minutes. Parent-child vacation is still very recommended!

Apart from relying on the surrounding water world and Happy World (independently operated) as selling points, the hotel itself really has nothing to do. There is no children's playground. There are three very small outdoor swimming pools, one of which is a young child. The pool is not open yet. Not to mention other housekeeping facilities. The next day, the cleaning staff clean up the bed and the bathroom within 15 minutes. The things on the table are invisible, and the replenishment of items is also omitted. Asking about children’s bathrobes and slippers, there is no such thing. At 9 o'clock in the evening, I wanted to send a bath towel, but I didn't knock on the door until 23 o'clock. Go to breakfast at 9:30 in the morning, go around at 10:00, and it looks like this. There are not many guests, and each room type has vacancies on the day, so the amount of breakfast food is served in small plates, and it is not real yet. During the summer vacation, you can imagine the coping scene of the hotel in the peak season of summer vacation. The area around the hotel is deserted and there is no real beach. Came to step on the pit.

1. The hotel is relatively new
2. Parent-child sea view rooms are more recommended. There are cave beds for children, and children will like it more. Sea view rooms can not only see the sea, but also the Ferris wheel in Ocean Park
3. The hotel has a shuttle bus to Ocean Park and Water World. If you take your baby there, your child will be very fulfilled
shortcoming:
1. The hotel is too out of the way, there is no other food around, if you want to play Sea World and Water World, you can consider staying
2. Although the hotel has a sea view, there is grass growing on the beach, the sand quality is average, and there will be garbage
3. The scope of activities of the hotel itself is very small
Nanyang Train is not recommended, and it does not match the video.
Many water worlds below 1.4m cannot be played.
You can still watch the fireworks show at night
Finally, I would like to praise Joyce, the service center manager, who was more enthusiastic and responsive during the stay. Also, we had already checked out, but the next day we found that the ring was forgotten in the hotel, so we called the hotel immediately, and the hotel customer service center quickly found it and sent it back.

The hotel itself has a good appearance, and it looks like a movie😂😂 The children's suit given by PS is Bduck's. It's cute, and my daughter likes it very much

msg:This time I came to Hainan, 2 days of the 6-day trip checked in at this hotel, and the experience exceeded our expectations. The theme of the hotel is "Ocean Paradise". The appearance is like a white palace, and the lobby is designed in an ocean style. The hotel is located in Hainan R&F Ocean Paradise Resort, adjacent to the Ocean Theme Park, which includes Ocean Paradise, Water World and South China Sea Train.
The most worth mentioning is the hotel's butler service, especially the butler Kent Wang Yexiao. After seeing our booking information, he took the initiative to add WeChat and provided a series of very heart-warming services. When he learned that we were the second in the itinerary When we chose their hotel for the first time, they not only upgraded us to a sea view room on a high floor for free, but also gave us lovely toiletries for the children. During the stay in the hotel, they kept asking about our needs and caring about our experience of staying in the hotel. They are really considerate! Thanks!

The children had a great time playing in the park and the water world. Two days of super fun. The room can see the garden view and the small train. It’s a pity that I didn’t see the fireworks. It’s only one day away
The surrounding area of the hotel is rather desolate and it is inconvenient to go out to eat. We drove for more than ten minutes at night and passed a dark neighborhood with no street lights before arriving at a village. Fortunately, we had a car
Facilities: The hotel is very new, the hardware is good, the whole looks like a big castle, the children like it very much, I hope the hotel can add more parent-child or children's entertainment projects
Hygiene: clean and tidy, the room aunt is very kind and gentle
Environment: Suitable for parent-child outings, children like it
Service: The exclusive butler service is considerate and in place, which saved us a lot of time. Give the little butler a thumbs up
Minibar once: The minibar is a surprise
 2 adults Hainan R & F Ocean Happy World tickets and Nanhai train tickets 1 time: the order includes the park tickets and the small train children's direct purchase at the store. The caring butlers helped us arrange it properly. The overall experience is still good. Two days can take The park and the water world are very thorough
It is recommended that the hotel’s free bus 🚌 be earlier, and the small train departs at 9:30 at the earliest, and it is a few kilometers away from the hotel. I hope the time can start earlier. 9:50 is a bit late

       There are battery cars to pick up and drop off between the hotel and the parks, and you can also rent a scooter to play in the playground, so you won’t be tired with your baby! There is too little food in the paradise and water world, and the taste is not very good. It needs to be improved! It is estimated that it is a newly opened playground. There is no need to queue up for any rides. One day playing in the playground and one day soaking in the water world, the children are very satisfied. But the second phase of the project is not open yet! Unfortunately!
       Generally speaking, it is worth checking in again. The small flaws were reported to Jimmy, the housekeeper. The communication with the housekeeper was very timely. The children look forward to revisiting the hotel next time!
       Forget about taking pictures of the room! Believe me, it's huge!

2. As a parent-child hotel, I really do not recommend families with children. The hotel has a ferry to go to Ocean Park, but the car arrangement is random. If there is no plan, there will be a long wait for a long time. The mosaic in the swimming pool of the second hotel fell off seriously, and the children's pool even scratched the children's feet. The safety of children in parent-child hotels did not attract attention.
3. The service attitude is very poor, and the attitude of avoiding push when things happen.
On an ordinary weekend, cleaning will not be timely and various chaos will occur. If the peak season comes, it is impossible to have a good experience. It is recommended to choose other parent-child hotels

msg:Environment: The overall style of the hotel is like Moroccan style, just like experiencing the rich people's luxury vacation, let's party anytime, anywhere.

But the geographical location determines that the hotel and the park are indispensable, because there is no other optional hotel when the park comes, and there is no other place to play because the hotel comes, and they are the only ones of each other within a radius of ten kilometers, so they are a bit tied. tasted.

Facilities: There is a shuttle bus (sightseeing car) in the hotel to take you to the park, about ten minutes, and you can walk for about ten minutes to the entrance of the hotel's exclusive park passage.
You can also reserve a car in advance to pick you up at the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop, but because you pick up people at the airport, if you don’t want to waste time, you can take a taxi directly, about 170 yuan.
The room view I booked can see the night view of the park, it’s beautiful~

Hygiene: It has only been open for less than a year, so everything is relatively new~

Service: The hotel proactively contacted and arranged the exclusive butler Luke in advance, who answered all questions in a timely manner and was very nice~

I experienced the hotel's three dining modes: buffet, room service and restaurant order. There are many varieties of buffet and the taste is good. The room delivery time is fast, and everything is wrapped in plastic wrap, which is very hygienic. The ordering in the restaurant was not ok, and the serving time was too slow. I waited for nearly an hour, which delayed the afternoon schedule.

The opening time of the park is 10 o'clock, and the Nanhai train runs at 9:30. The hotel shuttle bus can only be sent to the hotel's exclusive passage, so if you want to take the Nanhai train in the morning, you can only wait for 10 o'clock, or you can take a taxi to the main entrance and sit at 9 o'clock. The Nanhai train at half past one is a bit tasteless.

There are drones and fireworks shows in the park at night. If you don’t want to go to the park to be crowded, you can choose to watch it on the beach of the hotel. There are few people~ I even meet people next to them having a picnic with their own barbecue grills and headlights. It’s fun.

From the QR code of the hotel, you can buy a two-day ticket at the same price as a Ctrip single-day ticket, which is pretty good. The buffet breakfast purchased at the front desk of the hotel only costs 128 yuan/person, and Ctrip’s additional purchase is 258 yuan/person, which is really fast.

First of all, the package I bought included travel photography, but when I checked in, I didn’t mention travel photography at all. It was only the next day when I remembered that I didn’t have much time to take pictures and had to give up. Secondly, the first day I stayed at the balcony view It’s not too good. I can’t face the fireworks show. I have to look at it from an oblique angle. I called the front desk to ask if I could change to a room with a better balcony view. There was no response the next day. I took the initiative to call and asked and was told that there was no room and I couldn’t change it. I stayed in the mini for two days. I only gave it for one day, so I feel a little stingy. Third, I was surprised that the afternoon tea could not be delivered to the room. Let me talk about the advantages: the room is very good, the decoration is relatively new, there are beaches, 3 swimming pools, and the hotel has a special shuttle bus to the park, which is quite convenient. The design of the hotel is also very nice, a bit like the Islamic style architecture in the Middle East.
In terms of meals, the buffet breakfast is super crowded during the May Day holiday, and it’s the first time I’ve encountered this situation 😂 The variety is not bad, but the hotel’s scenery is good, and you can eat outdoors and watch the buffet The scenery is also very pleasant. The waiters are very polite and will take the initiative to say hello. It is recommended to travel at off-peak hours and not come here on holidays, and you will have a very comfortable time.

He asked questions Must answer, no matter what problem he can help, he will help. Help us contact the driver, play various strategies, and will follow up. After the official check-in, the parent-child room is very large, and the cleaning lady is also very patient. The only disadvantage of the facilities in the room is that the balcony is very large and there is no drying rack! There is no drying rack in the seaside parent-child resort hotel, do you dare to think? The only ones still have to queue up. After staying for 5 days, they only lined up on the last day. After swimming, the swimsuits can only be hung on the balcony stool to dry. My child was not feeling well the next day and wanted to take his temperature, but there was no thermometer... The hotel's children's pool closes at 6 o'clock, and it is unreasonable to only have an adult pool. After the sun sets at 6 o'clock or after the child has finished eating Swimming. During the period of 51, there were not enough shuttle buses to pick up and drop off the guests staying in the park, and there were disputes. The service was good, but there were too few facilities in the hotel. The most impressive thing about this trip is Lei Fan in the concierge depar**ent. Thank you for his dedication. His service makes people feel like the one-on-one service of a butler in a five-star island hotel in Bali.

After reading so many bad reviews, I went to the hotel very nervously. We drove to Shirley Yang Xuemin in the front office of the store at 12 o'clock to check in. He was very enthusiastic and professional. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we sent me the schedule of the park and gave it back for free. Upgraded to the sea view room, you can see the whole picture of the Ocean Park. The hotel environment is great. The service staff is warm and friendly. The afternoon tea is rich and varied, because it is a set meal for four and one, and there are only four drinks. The lady at the front desk also gave the children free hot milk. When I went into the Ocean Park, there were not many people and there were not many queues. The children only sat in the torrent for 6 times and played all the activities. Except that the location of the hotel is a bit out of the way, there are a lot of delicious food in the town within 20 minutes of driving. I don't think there is a problem with these

msg:When I booked, I saw that the score was not high, but I thought of coming to play or just let it go.
Before I arrived at the hotel, the customer service Joyce contacted me by phone and helped me upgrade to a sea view room with the best location. I became happier!
After arriving, I saw that the hotel was relatively refreshing and clean.
When I checked in, the front desk was very enthusiastic and thought of everything, such as where is the restaurant, can also deliver food, what time will the park open tomorrow, and so on, and even sent baby care. I haven't even asked about these things, they have been told to me.
So in the end, I really like this hotel. It is estimated that there are not many people in the off-season, so it is more thoughtful.

The breakfast is divided into Western food and Chinese food. The variety is also relatively rich, the taste is also very good, and the restaurant style is also very fresh. On the second day of check-in, I went to R&F Ocean World. There is a small bus from the hotel to pick you up. The playground is very fun. The most recommended ones are the Ferris wheel and the South China Sea Secret Realm. They are really unique, whether it is a hotel or an amu*****t park. Very recommendable 👍

After checking in, I received various information from Kent about the hotel and the sea world. It’s convenient, toilet water is delivered at night, the kids like this small cave bed so much, you can directly see 🎡 and the South China Sea train from the balcony, it’s a pity that there is no evening fireworks show in the middle of the week, the hotel staff will greet each other warmly , I dug a small crab on the beach in the evening, which is called "perfect" in the words of the children. The most touching thing is that the housekeeper Kent sent a video of fireworks 🎇 afterward, which made up for the little regret of the children, thank you very much! Will come again next time!

msg:Traveling to Hainan, after going to Boundary Island, I wanted to take my children to R&F Ocean Happy World. After the strategy, I decided to book a package with tickets for the Hyatt Hotel. The hotel facilities are very new and the scenery is beautiful. The room is clean and the breakfast is good. And a la carte taste is not bad! The only downside is that there are no restaurants nearby and as a parent-child hotel, it would be better to have a real indoor children's playground.

By the way, the most impressive thing about staying in this trip is the considerate service brought to us by Shirley at the front desk. Shirley gave us the timetable of the park project and tips for checking in the room, which is comparable to a star-rated high-end hotel! Since my room package was wrong, they also helped me patiently contact Ctrip customer service to change the package. (This is also a reminder to those who buy packages with tickets on Ctrip. The packages are divided into islanders and foreign tourists. Don’t make mistakes~) Shirley also helped us upgrade the viewing room facing the park, because The plane took off late, and they also helped us to delay the check-out until 14:00~ This stay brought us many surprises, nice!

The hotel can be picked up to the park by the dedicated channel for guests. The children had a great time in the park, and it was also a very satisfying visit~ I will recommend Hyatt to more friends who want to come to Lingshui~

The supporting playground has many programs suitable for children to carnival. Due to my young age, many items cannot be played, but the sea train is my favorite. It still makes him very happy. Since the hotel is newly opened, there are not many options for ordering Chinese food in the hotel. It is not very convenient for families with young children to eat. I hope that there will be improvements in the future. The service attitude of the overall restaurant service staff is very good. The consciousness is very good, which needs to be praised. During the check-in process, because I am a person with severe formaldehyde allergies, the room I lived in at the beginning had some smell. After contacting the hotel housekeeper Joyce, I changed the room with the manager on duty that night ( And upgraded the parent-child suite), and added two air purifiers. The staff's problem-solving response and awareness are very touching, so the original two-day itinerary was extended for another day. In short, this trip is quite satisfactory. In two years, when the children are older, they may come again.

msg:Before the trip, I read many negative information about the hotel in the reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised after I checked in. If I come to R&F Ocean again next time, I will continue to choose this hotel without hesitation.
⭕️The location is very convenient, there is a dedicated hotel passage directly to the park (you can take the hotel shuttle bus or choose to walk, both are very convenient)
⭕️The overall style of the hotel is very resort-style, and parent-child travel is a plus
⭕️The parent-child room type is very sincere, and the detailed design is much better than the "parent-child room" that fools things and randomly puts some cartoon elements. It is convenient and considerately equipped with mother-child toilet seats and baby toothbrushes. It would be even better if there is an extra booster stool for the baby in the room. The balcony can see the paradise on the side very transparently, and it is beautiful under the day and night lights.
⭕️The service attitude is very good, including the room cleaning staff are very enthusiastic, and every staff member is very lovely.
⭕️The front desk is very fast. I arrived at 4:00 p.m., maybe it was luck, there was no queue for check-in and check-out, and it was done in seconds.
⚠️The parking lot P1 is on the ground, and it will be very detoured when entering the hotel. P2 is next to P1, which is underground. If you come by car, you can stop here. Just scan the QR code for free parking when you leave.

Because the hotel is newly opened, there are indeed many small problems. The details I encountered, such as not enough drinks in the minibar, should have only one kind of coffee capsules of four different flavors, and the room service seems to be okay. It is not perfect (there is no menu in the room), the breakfast variety is relatively small, and the closing time is not timely, but it should get better and better in the future. I think there is still a large area in the hotel park that is still under planning and construction.

The environment is very good and the sanitary conditions are also good. From the room, it happens to be a paradise. If there are fireworks in the future, it will definitely be a good place to watch.
The hotel provides a shuttle bus directly to the park (5 minutes apart) and it only takes 2 minutes to drive to the park. The park can be entered and exited unlimited times a day, even if the child is tired from playing, he can go back to sleep and come back to play. But currently the park is only open until 6pm. There are various performances of dolphins, seals, mermaids and so on in the park.
The breakfast in the hotel is quite rich, and the viewing position is not bad.
Definitely a hotel worth visiting with children.

It happened to be the birthday of the child, Koi also arranged cake and room decoration, the child had a very happy time.
The tropical plants in the lobby are beautiful and unique, and children are curious to touch them everywhere.
Hyatt is right next to R&F Ocean Paradise, and the garden view room has a particularly good view, and it feels like living in a fairy tale world.
The hotel's catering is at the standard of a star hotel. Although it is expensive, the quality and taste are very good.
Friends who want to come don't hesitate, it will be a great accommodation and play experience.

I was greeted by Ms. Li Ziyu at the front desk is very beautiful, generous and decent. Knowing my son’s birthday, she prepared a birthday cake and decorated the room in advance. Luke Lei, the concierge who sent us back to the room, is simply a living map of the place. The surrounding area is delicious and fun. I can learn everything from him, and he expresses very richly in his body. During the period, he exchanged vx and delayed my check-out by two hours in advance. The service really touched me, he is a treasure boy. It's a pity that we are in a hurry and have to rush to Nanshan. As for the park, it is a pity that the water park is not open, but generally speaking, my son likes it very much. My little daughter's birthday is here in May.

The hotel room can also be very large, but they started to call me to say that the room type was upgraded, but it seems that they have not been upgraded, so why call me. For breakfast, the distance between the Chinese and Western restaurants and the fruit place is a bit far. The restaurant is too big, and it is really tiring to pick up food. I saw some comments saying that there are too few styles, so I definitely didn’t go to the Chinese restaurant. The swimming pool is open and the children like it. Then they played the small train on the sea and left the park. It was hard to get in. There was a long queue. Later, we were in the same team as the islanders, and we had to scan the QR code to enter. The first time we entered was a direct ID card. You can enter with your fingerprints, but can’t you use your ID card and fingerprints when you re-enter? If you have to find a text message, you have to look through your phone for a long time.

Before I checked in, I received a call from the customer service manager Xu Yating, added WeChat, and asked us to arrange two rooms with one floor as much as possible. And upgraded our room. Maybe there will be fewer people after the Spring Festival, and there is no queue for check-in. You can live in the room when you arrive, and the room is also very new.
At least this hotel is the most convenient, convenient and nearest hotel to go to Sea World.
The concierge is also very good to deliver to the room, and the service of taking a taxi in and out to help us with our luggage and open the door is very good.
It is very convenient to stay in the hotel and bring your baby to and from the hotel through the back door on the same day! I saw fireworks on the day of the park, only on the Spring Festival weekend. The best choice to go to Sea World.
The breakfast is also very good, and I also ate the evening buffet at the hotel. 238 people are also very clean.
If you come to the beach, there is really no advantage, but its advantage is that it is a convenient paradise. So it's really nice to stay here for two days to play in the park.

He also gave us a room with a good view of the fireworks. It is clean and hygienic. It is 12 o'clock on the Lantern Festival. Adding a firework, sitting in the room and watching it, very comfortable~ The overall service awareness is strong~ The hotel is new and the transportation is convenient~ I am very satisfied~ I recommend friends who come to the playground to live~

There is a sea in the yard, and there are sea rainbows and snails inside. The Ocean Amu*****t Park is right next door. The breakfast included is very rich and exquisite. The disadvantage is that it is inconvenient to go to other places to eat besides the hotel, and the hotel lunch and dinner are very expensive.

msg:I think this is the worst experience in my life. On the first day we arrived at the hotel, we went back to the room to take a shower after swimming. The child slipped and fell on the first step into the bathroom, and his head fell hard on the threshold. On Shishang, the blood was flowing, and there was no infirmary in the hotel. We drove to the People’s Hospital 8 kilometers away for trea**ent. The 3.5-year-old child couldn’t take anesthesia. When the doctor stitched up the needles, he was trembling in pain and crying so hard. As a mother, it was heartbreaking. To the extreme! As a parent-child five-star hotel, I didn't even consider the safety of the children. There is no anti-slip reminder in the bathroom. It is very slippery for adults to stand on, let alone children. Back at the hotel, the manager on duty just came over to take a look! We have never asked for any compensation from the beginning to the end, but it is really irresponsible! Now the child has received serious psychological harm, dare not do anything, only hugs me every day, I am depressed, every day when I sleep and close my eyes, I see the picture of the child bleeding, extremely guilty!

msg:This is the third hotel we stayed in during this trip. Maybe it’s because the gap between Yanlord Crown and this hotel is so big. Both the configuration and service can’t keep up. The 1,300 two-night Kaiyuan Resort Hotel we stayed in at the beginning was better than this configuration and service. It's so much better. The price/performance ratio of this one is really low at 1699. The water drain switches for the basin and bathtub are broken. When I went back to the room after breakfast in the morning, the whole room smelled really bad. It was the odor coming back from the toilet and sewer. It's a family hotel and it only has children's toiletries. There is nothing. When I asked for a clothes hanger, it could not be delivered within an hour. The reception capacity could not keep up at all. The customer service staff was also very impatient when answering the phone. There was only one four kilogram dumbbell in the gym. When I asked the staff, they said that it had been lost for several months. . The playability of Ocean Fun is average. There were not many people when we played and there were not many queues. However, the weather was too hot. It is recommended that those who want to come to the park can buy tickets for the park separately and live in the county.

msg:Arrived at the front desk around 12 o'clock, queued to check in, and waited 15 minutes for our turn. Check-in was very slow. There were not many people on Monday, but I was told that it would not be cleaned until at least 3:30.
Tell us that we can go to the restaurant to eat first and participate in handicraft activities. There are no children's facilities in the hotel, only a climbing frame and metal slide by the swimming pool. There is only a row of claw machines that are charged separately in the room, a very simple book corner and handicraft area.
Bringing a baby in a hotel is exhausting for parents, and children in the handicraft area are tired of doing puzzles for a few minutes. And there was no manual activity at 2:00, the waiter showed up at 2:30, and told me: "You didn't make an appoin**ent 24 hours in advance, I thought there was no one, so I went to do other work."
The restaurant in the hotel is more expensive, and the dishes are relatively ordinary, 88 for spaghetti with meatballs, about 70 for beef noodles, and 138 for seafood pizza.
It's really boring in the hotel lobby, and children have to run back and forth with common luggage such as milk powder and water. The pioneer drove to the park to make a small train, and only received a call at 3:45 to say that it was packed and ready to move in.
The room is relatively large, and you can see the park from the balcony. It is very convenient to go to the park.
There is no separate shower in the outdoor swimming pool, you have to go back to your room to take a shower. The children's pool only has simple slides and water guns.
Living in a hotel alone is really nothing to do, except that there is no advantage in being close to the park, and staying in a hotel with a baby is very tiring. There are so many rooms on each floor, it takes a long time to walk from the room to the front desk.

msg:Service: From the moment you get off the bus, you can feel the enthusiasm from the hotel staff. Help open the door, take the luggage to the lobby and guide the check-in. The same is true when leaving the store. The children's toiletries and razors we needed were delivered within a short time of calling, which was great. The younger brother of the lifeguard in the swimming pool is also extremely serious and responsible. He stands and watches the movement of the swimming pool throughout the whole process, and prevents the children from inappropriate behavior in time to prevent it from happening. A little girl slipped and fell, and her father was still watching indifferently. The lifeguard immediately went down. Like it, safety is really important.
Environment: The hotel garden is not particularly large, but it is full of sense of design. My daughter said it looks like a castle in Qatar (the World Cup is brainwashed, haha)
I like it very much. At 9:30 in the evening, you can also see the drone show and fireworks of Happy World in the lobby, which is gorgeous and romantic. The room as a whole is clean and tidy, very comfortable.
Breakfast: It is really suitable for us who take the baby to sleep until we wake up naturally, and we have to clean up for a long time before we can go out. The variety is not particularly large, but it is enough for breakfast. There are a lot of people dining, we were arranged in the far corner of the outfield, but we were not ignored because of this, at 10:30, the waiter will remind us of the time to collect the food, let us get enough food, the spoon we need, Toothpicks are also responsive, and no one forgets when they turn around because of the crowd.

Overall: It is very suitable for children to play. Unfortunately, the beach is not suitable for swimming and playing in the sand. Moreover, the adult Happy World ticket included in the hotel is unlimited admission to the park on the day of fingerprinting, but the child's ticket bought separately does not have this advantage. , this is very tasteless. It would be even more perfect if it can be like Chimelong, and you can enter the park unlimited times during the two days of your stay. Hope to improve next time.

The designer is very good. Eddy, the housekeeping manager who received us, was very enthusiastic. He would call me in advance to confirm the itinerary and check in, and then sent us to the room. The room was arranged for the best effect of watching fireworks. Any supplements to the room would be followed up in time. Great praise. And even through the mask, I can feel that he is a handsome guy with fair skin. Hahaha, he is really kind and kind. I will stay here again next time.

msg:Really very disappointed with Hyatt. Buyer luxury hotel prices, matching minimum finishing standards. The whole house has tiles of the same color, no wooden floors, no carpets, and no beautiful seams on the tiles. There is no wainscoting, no wallpaper, no stone on the wall, latex paint from the hall to the room, and it is moldy and peeling. Ice dew served with water. The beach is dark, and the garden is not a landscape. The vegetation on the Huanhai Expressway is better than this. The pool tiles were peeling off and didn't look clean. Paradise is also deceitful. And digging pits to make money everywhere is ugly. The room is equipped with two adults with 1-day tickets and can enter and exit multiple times. If the child wants to enter and exit multiple times, it will cost more to buy two for the child. day pass. A puff with the size of a thumb costs 48 yuan, and a coconut 68 yuan. The buffet is 238 yuan per person. The most expensive dish is oysters, and I have been waiting all night. My son didn't eat anything and queued up all night and only got 5 oysters. The management of breakfast is chaotic. Simple things such as fried rice, fried noodles and fried eggs are not available. Every time I have to wait, and every time I have bottomed out, I will add it. OnePlus didn't come out for half an hour. People in the restaurant can't eat and wait. People outside the restaurant can't come in and wait. hehe. There is no fragrance system in the entire hotel, the toilets in the restaurant are smelly, and the door locks are still broken. There are no whale sharks in the Whale Shark Pavilion, which is about the same level as the flower and bird market. All the water worlds are closed, and the 13 pavilions and facilities of the sea world are closed. The performance arrangement is chaotic and people are running around in the garden, just to make you spend more money to rent a car. The acting is perfunctory and mediocre. This trip ended regrettably because of this hotel.

msg:I visited the park and Hyatt twice in January and February. In January, there were few people and it was very quiet. The whole park was very comfortable and full of fairytale feeling. The hotel was quiet and full of a**osphere. In February, there were too many people and there was no sense of experience. The breakfast was called one It was horrible to see, the dining table was full of food residues, the freshly squeezed juices were blended in barrels, and the dishes were collected by shouting or doing it yourself. Every time you have to queue up, the entrance of the park is not humanized, and the attitude of serious congestion is not good. The hotel swimming pool is exposed to the sun, and there is no kids club. There is no indoor kids club in such a parent-child place. There are only jigsaw puzzles on one side of the lobby. The room hygiene is not good, the clothes hangers are covered with floating dust, and there is no drying rack on the balcony.

msg:The newly opened hotel has really ruined the Hyatt brand. As shown in the picture, the tiles in the room are peeling off, water seeps and leaks, and the telephone speaker is covered with dandruff. It is almost like spending a five-star hotel for a business hotel, and a parent-child hotel is not up to par arrive.
First, the check-in was slow. When I arrived at the hotel at 5 o'clock, I was told that the room was not cleaned. It was 6 o'clock. There was a queue in the lobby, and the front desk in the east wing was not open. Alas, the efficiency was too slow!
Second, there is a lack of bathrobes in the room. I called the room phone 4 times and no one answered. It was around 6:10 pm. Have you all gone to eat?
Third, I can hardly feel the enthusiasm of the service staff in the hotel. They are all unfamiliar with the business and have a perfunctory attitude. This is the case from the front desk to the restaurant. I don’t understand why I have to spend this crime. Except for the aunt who cleans the room and will take the initiative to say "good morning" and "good evening" at the door of the room, the others are really hard to describe...
Fourth, there will be a queue at the door for the breakfast buffet from 9 o'clock. Eating is the same as grabbing a meal. It's not that there are no seats inside, but that there are too few staff to clean up the restaurant and move slowly. In addition, the most popular restaurant is egg rolls, and there is a long queue every day. The attitude of the two boys who make egg rolls is the worst, so bad that you really want to quarrel with him. For an egg roll, you just scrape two halves in one pan? what? No more cheese? Then what are you doing on the table?
Fifth, the hotel needs to take a shuttle bus to go to the park. In the morning, there were two shuttle buses at the entrance of the hotel. I told the handsome guy in the concierge, "Hello, we are going to the park. Can I wait here for the bus?" Pointing and saying "Didn't you see a car just go away?" Then I said there is another one, he rolled his eyes and said you just stand here and wait, someone will come to drive... Ten minutes later, this is it The impolite concierge drove the car away, such an attitude...
All of the above are bad experience
There are also good parts, that is, the buffet breakfast and dinner are rich in variety, the barbecue at night tastes good, the bubble bath in the hotel pool is very fun, the hotel is very close to the park, and you can enter the park unlimited times by pressing your fingerprint. The above is my experience of three days and two nights.
If you are looking for cost-effectiveness, 2088's package is really discounted. If you are looking for service, don't come here to suffer. It's really not a vacation, but a robbery! ! ?

msg:I stayed at the Hyatt Hotel on February 6th. I was very lucky to choose this place because of the overcrowding in Sanya, which seemed comfortable and comfortable. The hotel's appearance is worth the software and hardware facilities, and the breakfast is basically online. In particular, I would like to highly praise my housekeeper, Ms. Li Ziyu, who has been patient and thoughtful to help coordinate all communication and arrangements for check-in and play since check-in. Added so much convenience! Because I brought two children, one was still relatively young, and I was tired from playing at noon and could not participate in the hotel activities reserved in the afternoon. Another big one must participate. The young lady is still helping us to coordinate and communicate on the rest day. Finally, both babies are happy💖💖Because the supporting R&F Ocean World has been playing for a whole day, the hotel needs to apply for a one-day extension Staying, on the day of Ctrip, only ordinary double-bed rooms can be booked for check-in. Thanks to Ms. Li Ziyu's help, I helped renew a room in Regency Club from the hotel's official website. The view from the room is first-class, and you can watch the fireworks show in the park at night, killing any angle in the park. Because I am too lazy to get up and take pictures, I can’t upload a video for everyone to enjoy🤪As a reminder, the hotel has two ways to enter the park directly by battery car or walking. After entering, you must go directly to the opposite entrance of the park to rent a battery car! sure! Otherwise, the temperature at 12:00 noon in Sanya will definitely make you want to die 😂 The battery car is 80-100 yuan/hour, with a cap of 300-400 yuan. If you book in the afternoon, there is no car and you have to wait in line to return the car😅

Environment: The surrounding area is desolate, and the hotel itself has nothing special except the buildings
Service: Can the service be rated as negative five stars? Too bad 👎🏻! After the Chinese New Year, all the troops have left, and you can wait for more than half an hour to check in. Looking at the 4 people at the front desk, it is actually a mess! When I came back in the afternoon to get a room card, I had to wait in line with the check-in person! I took my child to carry my luggage, and there were a few luggage boys standing at the door, but none of them helped!

msg:Stayed in an ordinary double bed room type, 3 days and 2 nights, the average price is 1688/night, the following is the feeling: there is no bathtub, no toothbrush for children needs to be ordered separately, no small stool for children to wash, and a 4-year-old child cannot stand at all Washing needs to be held all the way. The room space is not so crowded. The toilet is very small in a separate area, like on an airplane. I personally don't like this layout, it feels cheap. The package includes a one-day park ticket, which is not very reasonable. It should be a pass that can be entered and exited at any time during the stay. If the child needs a nap during the day, it will definitely not be able to play. The hotel has a battery car to pick up and drop off the park, which is convenient. In fact, you can walk there. There are many bugs in and out of the park. This is the problem of the park and not the hotel. After eating dinner buffet for two days, I think it’s not bad for 238 people. It's just that the salmon is actually smoked and not fresh... The place where the buffet is eaten has a good view, and you can see the fireworks show in the park. Generally speaking, it is quite satisfactory, and the room attendants are still very enthusiastic. There is no constant temperature swimming pool. The inland beach of the hotel has played for a while, and you can dig mussels, but it is best for children to wear beach shoes, too many broken shells can easily scratch their feet.

I originally booked for two nights, but finally extended my stay. The hotel is very new, with a large space and a good design. I especially like the big balcony, but the sudden heavy traffic may make the hotel a little unprepared. Many ingredients in the restaurant cannot be supplied in time, but they have also given a perfect solution. The shuttle from the hotel to the paradise The battery car is also very convenient, in short, it is a perfect experience! Thanks again to Stephen.Qi for serving us!

It took four days to ask for a drying rack, but the service was really bad. Many recreational facilities in the Ocean Paradise were not turned on, especially the water world. One project was not turned on. Basically, I played lonely, just the fireworks at night. The show is not bad. The small sea train in the park suggests that everyone take pictures. If you wait in line until you doubt your life, if you want to see the small sea train, you might as well go to Xiamen and take the subway line 1. You have to make complaints about the breakfast. There are really few varieties. It’s delicious, and there’s an off-road vehicle base next to the hotel. Early in the morning, I heard the gas pedal of the refitted car rumbling. It’s so hyped. It’s really the worst hotel among the many hotels I’ve stayed in.

msg:This is one of the worst hotels. What I’m talking about is not the hardware but the management team. I can’t imagine that the management of Hyatt Hotel is not as good as Home Inn. It’s just that the whole team has no service concept and service awareness. Even the most basic basic business is not available. The Spring Festival is just a little more expensive but has nothing to do with the service. I stayed for two consecutive days. On the first morning, I asked at the front desk about the purchase of park tickets. When there were no guests checking out and staying in, all I got was verbal help. I didn’t feel the care and enthusiasm of a star-rated hotel even though I was I came to consume, and then three employees communicated with me before and after asking about children’s car rental at the concierge, and they all told me that there was no one, and no one told me that I could rent battery cars in the park, even though we entered through the hotel passage, we could rent them in advance We can’t see the rental point at all for the key points of the vehicle. When we finished riding the Ferris wheel and found that there was a battery car, we couldn’t rent it. This may be my strict requirement because it is not the hotel’s own business after all. But after I complained to the lobby manager, I just heard He said he wanted to apologize to me in person, but I didn't hear anyone representing the hotel apologize to me in person or any written apology until I checked out the next day. And after I left the hotel the next day and checked out normally (there was no guest at the front desk, only myself), it was even more strange. I drove for nearly two hours and arrived at the hotel in Yalong Bay, but was told that the hotel did not check in for me. The work of deregistration, which is the most basic business, they do not have the management of restaurants, guest room sanitation, security, and facility guarantee are also in a mess, but we can't see it. All in all, this is a very bad hotel. Maybe it's because of the poor business. It's such a good environment and brand. The team is too bad. Maybe it's because the owner Fangtu hired a bunch of unreliable managers at a low price.

But two things happened, it's not flattering
The night I arrived, I drove out for dinner.
Unexpectedly, Dabao fell in the eating place
Knees, elbows, legs all hurt, can't walk
drive back to the hotel
At the entrance of the hotel, Xiaobao made a fuss because he hadn't eaten dinner.
Dabao can't walk again, sir stop the car (does not obstruct any passage)
Want to send us to the room and move the car
The security guard at the door sternly refused, no way, you park in the parking lot below and then walk up, it’s only a few steps
everyone has children
I hope next time your child is injured
You also met a master like you
At the beginning, Uncle Security’s tone was very harsh, very bad, what’s the matter if you stop here, you won’t be able to move any longer
who do i go to
We reported the room number to no avail
Later, I saw that Mr. was going to be angry.
I just said whatever you want
Later, my husband sent me and two children to the room
Just go down and move the car
Fortunately, I brought my own disinfection and other things
Let Dabao lie down for a while and feed Xiaobao
Wait until Mr. comes up before disinfecting Dabao
This matter really makes me unable to understand, let alone a 5-star hotel
Even ordinary fast hotels and homestays can’t happen.

Then came the lovely room service
I pressed Do Not Disturb on purpose for fear of affecting my child’s nap
The guest room aunt knocked on my door for the first time and I said no cleaning, thank you
knocked again after an hour
I asked, did you see the Do Not Disturb I clicked?
Auntie said but your room hasn't been cleaned yet
We are going to get off work, hehe, I don't want to say anything
And it was even cuter the next morning, before we checked out, and it was time for the kids to take a nap
The room service even knocked and went straight in.
and see that we are all
I also told my colleagues, look, someone
Then silently closed the door. .

The hotel has a nice view and is quite big, very close to the park
The free park tickets and small trains must be sold on the same day
Otherwise, it will be useless. We are too tired, and the child is injured. The little train will be wasted and not used.

The hotel I arrived at around 2:00 p.m. was not particularly crowded, and I checked in directly. Go straight to the Happy Park, and I haven’t experienced all of it in four hours. If time permits, it’s better to arrange a full day. There are fast food in the park, and there are no queues for play items. There are also many small carts and electric scooters that can be rented. There are still several second-phase projects that are not open, and I feel sorry for the price of tickets.
The hotel has a swimming pool, the beach is not particularly good, and there is a lot of garbage, but there are many small conchs, small crabs, small fish, and many clams in the sea. It is very fun and suitable for children. There are few children's experience programs in the hotel, so it is recommended to improve it.

If you want to go to the paradise, there is no need to live here, you need to live farther away to enjoy a better experience! During the epidemic period, there were very few staff members, and it was really difficult to drag boxes for the hotel's new carpets! When you check in and swipe your card to enter the door, there is a staff member who doesn't know what to do on the bed in the room. No matter what you do, it makes people feel very uncomfortable at first. The apology belongs to the apology. I arrived at the store at 6:30, and I definitely won't be doing a room review! Arrived at 6:30, there was only one cafe left in the restaurant, and it said that it would take at least an hour and a half to order food. There was no convenience store, and there was nothing to eat in the cafe in the lobby! You can only order Meituan takeout! I have never seen this level of service in a luxury hotel Hyatt! The room service can still have some content on the first day, but if you continue to order it on the second day, it feels like it is left over from being eaten. Girlfriend wants to book a hotel, so hurry up and refund it! On the other hand, Haifu Ocean Park is really cold this year, so the water park is not open. It is really amazing to see the water park from the Nanhai train. It should be very fun. There are many large water slides. Come and play next summer! There are not too many people in the park, the rapids, the jumping machine, and the Ferris wheel can be swiped unlimited times. In fact, we have visited all major parks and think that we can play. The hardware is almost there. It is better than queuing for an hour or two at once. ! The hotel is responsible for sending guests to the park, but the delivery is from the side, not the front. No one is sending out maps at the side door. Entering the park is like a headless fly. There is no one, no staff, and no tourists. The South China Sea train needs Get on the bus outside the main gate, so tourists who read my comment should arrange their time well, otherwise they will take a lot of wrong roads! Generally speaking, the South China Sea Train and Ocean Paradise are playable. Children who have been in Hainan for a long time can come and play. After all, there are no good playgrounds in Hainan, so you can still play here, although the roller coaster is not open!

At first, we thought there were no large-scale amu*****t facilities such as slides and climbing nets, but later we found that the children calmed down and played chess, and the puzzles were also very fun. The main reason is that Cynthia accompanied the children with special care and patiently taught them to play various chess We did a lot of cute crafts together. Most of the children’s amu*****t park staff in the hotel are too lazy to play with their children by themselves. Few of them spend time with their children like Little C. For the next two days, my child has been spending time in the Children's Paradise, very happy, thank you little C! Speaking of the room, I was not satisfied with the room at the beginning. When the guest room in the back was not tight, joyce helped to change the room. It was very good. You can see the Ferris wheel And the little train, joyce also sent a message to remind me of the fireworks time at the sea world on the weekend, thank you Joyce! Finally, let’s talk about the hotel because the location is relatively remote, and there is no reliable takeaway, but you can really try it when ordering from the hotel. Many dishes are very delicious! Recommend roasted spring chicken and green beans with minced pork and four-cornered beans, and you can also try the baby menu. In general, I was really dissatisfied at the beginning, but then the service attitude of the staff changed my opinion, so I will comment again.

I went out after breakfast in the morning, and returned to the room at 4:00 p.m., as shown in the first four pictures. I waited until 6:00 p.m. and no one came to clean it. I called the room service, but the other party said that because of the serious epidemic, cleaning can only be simple now tidy? ? ? Not to mention that there are major changes in the country's epidemic prevention policy, even if I live in a closed state at any time before, it is not an isolation hotel, right? Isn't it necessary to clean carefully when the epidemic is serious? Unexpectedly, the whole of China has been opened up, and it is the first time I heard that the hotel did not clean the rooms for customers on the grounds of the epidemic. After dinner, the room looks like the last four pictures, and it has been "simple cleaned". Only new bath towels were placed, the countertop was covered with soil, the quilt was wrinkled, and the bathtub was wet. Resort hotels in tourist cities don’t even have enough manpower to deal with the three-day holiday of New Year’s Day. It’s hard to imagine what it will be like during the long holiday. If hygiene and service are not improved, even with the biggest Hyatt gimmick, it will be difficult to go in the long run.

The sand is black when dug down. I don't know what it is. It may be that there are too many staff in the sun, and no one cleans up. The new decoration still has a bit of taste, but it is generally clean. The park belongs to the Chinese style, probably at the level of Fantawild, so you can make do with it. The surroundings of the paradise are desolate and there is nothing.

Environment: The environment is just like that. By the way, if you want to take your children to Ocean Paradise, staying in this hotel is not free of tickets. To put it bluntly, it doesn’t matter except that it’s closer.
Service: Basically no service. The business with the longest check-in time and its lack of proficiency even ask me if I have ordered breakfast. I have a lunch at the coffee shop on the third floor, which is extremely slow and I ordered a Hainanese chicken rice, etc. It took more than half an hour to arrive, but there was no chicken oil rice. Give me a bowl of white rice. I wonder if you didn’t have it when I placed the order. Would you tell me? I won’t order Hainanese chicken rice.
Finally, I would like to add that the location is really not good. There are no businesses nearby, and there are very few takeaways. The traffic can only be done by car. If you want to book this hotel, please ask in advance. Don’t step on the trap. The rooms are also very average, giving people the feeling of a fast hotel.

msg:As a V5 member of Ctrip, I rarely post comments, but this time I couldn’t help complaining. If it’s not a holiday, there are basically no lights in the playground, barren, far away, so forget it. I came here early and wanted to open a better place. The sea view room, the luggage was unloaded, and the ID card was given. They said that the room was not tidied up and let me play and eat first. I returned to the hotel at 8:00 and gave a sea view room on the third floor. I could barely see the sea. , By the way, the lobby is on the 5th floor, only the 3rd, 5th, and 8th floors are open, and the 3rd floor is going down, which is basically the feeling of the first floor on the ground... I called and wanted to change rooms, saying that I was late and had to I was assigned a room like this. The sea view room really made me feel lonely. The most unpleasant feeling of accommodation during my trip to Hainan these days, because the hotels I stayed in all the way had fruits, but there were none here, which made my daughter complain, anyway. Next time, definitely not staying here...

msg:As a whole, I can only say that I have never encountered embarrassment before. Can the service be negative? Arrived at the lobby at 14:55, the first two guests waited for 40 minutes to check in, and it was my turn, and told me that the twin room had not been cleaned and I could not check in (15:35 at this time), unless there was only one room of 1m x 2 A twin room of meters, I said that I booked this room type, mainly to help me upgrade to a 1.35-wide double bed, I feel that it is for my own good to wait for 40 minutes, I later saw that I booked 2 The night package is a 1.35 double bed. What the hell did you say to help me upgrade. It's just that a female receptionist surnamed Li is as efficient as a snail.

The minibar in the room said there were soft drinks and juices, but it turned out to be only four bottles of farmer’s water. I called the service number five or six times and no one answered. I gave up until after 8 o’clock in the evening. It was more difficult to call than 12315. Service!

The children's playground is just a small private room with three or four tables and some toys.

Fishing is not allowed in the waters in front of the hotel, and fishing is not allowed when you walk to the small dam outside the hotel. I said that I am here for vacation, not for prison. The experience is really bad. The administrator came up and called "Big Brother" instead of "Mr." Let's experience the hotel service for ourselves!

There are no water activities in the amu*****t park, and there are only a few items in the park, and the roller coaster is not open. I am completely sorry for the fare, and there are a few self-funded items! The previous family, old and young, entered the park because their fingerprints were wrong. They said that their family had to go to the other side of the park to record again before coming back. The guests were anxious! Really speechless, except that the hardware in the room is relatively new and the environment is okay, there is nothing else to say!

It is also equipped with a brand-name capsule coffee machine and chaise longue. The bathroom toilet and the bathing area are separated and do not interfere with each other. The hotel just opened this year. In order to ensure that the guest experience rooms are not all open, the cleaning can keep up so that there will be no mess when there are too many people.

Environment: far away from the busy city, but complete with various entertainment facilities, including children's playground, children's swimming pool, suitable for parent-child travel, the hotel has a quiet beach, you can walk or take the hotel's frequency bus to the Sea World playground, enter the park from the hotel's dedicated entrance, You can enter the park unlimited times a day, avoiding the crowding of using the same entrance with many tourists, very thoughtful design.

Service: Due to the newly opened front desk, the check-in procedure is a bit slow (it is recommended to put some welcome drinks, and you can chill it while waiting for check-in), but they all answer the questions of the guests very seriously, and also send some detailed items of the playground , Operating hours to us. Thank you Joyce at the front desk.
You can see the fireworks and drone performances in the playground from the balcony of the hotel lobby.

The price of the hotel's dinner buffet is favorable, and there are many varieties. The taste is good and the price is high. The coconut chicken soup and grilled oysters are both good. There are two dining environments, outdoor poolside and indoor. That is, the breakfast variety is slightly less in five-star hotels and vegetables are slightly less. There are no common steamed grains (sweet potatoes, pumpkins, yams, etc.), and tiger skin chicken feet and pork ribs in black bean sauce are delicious. I don't know if it's because I went there as soon as the meal opened at 7 o'clock and the dishes were not served yet.

The overall feeling of staying this time is very good, and I stocked up on the package of hotel + playground for three days and two nights early.

msg:Traveling during the epidemic is very troublesome
This trip is also the final trip after the plan has been repeatedly revised.
Come to the largest Hyatt in Greater China
It is necessary to give a good review
First of all, when I arrived at the store, I found that the water world ticket in the package could not be used because the scenic spot was closed.
Undoubtedly, the arrangement of this three-day and two-night trip to this hotel was a big blow, because the purpose of arranging a trip with friends is to go to this kind of paradise with a high degree of freedom of choice.
Fortunately, Stephen, the butler of Hyatt, applied for a voucher for the hotel's catering in time, allowing everyone to eat a high-quality meal here. I would like to give special praise here, because the high standard of Hyatt's own food will allow the changed The arrangement did not result in the expected landslide (we later changed to Boundary Island to experience snorkeling, which is also an unforgettable memory for many novices)
Of course, back to the hotel itself, the following points are also the accommodation experience:
1. The lobby lights are not turned on during the day, and the lights in the public area are too weak at night. It is difficult for a group of 16 of us to find a suitable public area to arrange small group activities at night.
2. I was informed before check-in that they were all upgraded to sea view rooms, but in fact there were two without them. Of course, I was also told when I checked in that I could arrange a double bed room with sea view, but more or less, it formed a gap in expectations
3. The breakfast is very good and meets Hyatt’s standards, but the overall public area lacks a lot of the exquisiteness of Hyatt, or it may be that they want to follow the style of the park, so the basic facilities are weakened, and they want everyone to go to the park to play
4. The swimming pool is unexpectedly small, and the greenery in the park is also very weak, and because the original view of the hotel is only an inner lake (not a beach), the swimming pool is very small, and you can't go to the park, so the experience becomes worse up
5. Beach volleyball has also been canceled because of the control of the area, and there are fewer experience items, which is very troublesome for resort hotels.
6. The minibar in the room is good, and the juice selection does not drop the crotch

In terms of dining, I ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel. There are three set menus for dinner. The selected Thai food is amazing, especially the papaya salad. The breakfast variety is quite rich, but the quality is very high, Amway wonton noodles, bread and cold dishes. Newly opened, there will still be a bit of decoration. When I woke up in the morning, I found that the toilet was a bit unpleasant, the bathroom and toilet were separated from wet and dry, and the sensor light was praised before the electricity card was inserted in the door.

The service attitude of the little brother Erik at the front desk was very good. He took us back to the room and helped us introduce the hotel. The various parent-child activities of the hotel are sent to us on WeChat. Every employee in the hotel has a strong sense of service, including the cleaning aunt who will greet us with a smile and help us open the door when we go out. Breakfast is also good. My son said that he would like to come next week. I hope that the next time I stay in the pool, I can stay in the row of rooms in front of the hotel, and the paradise will be better.

msg:The hotel is newly built, and the hardware conditions are excellent. We chose the parent-child room for the room. The room is very spacious, and the cloakroom is also designed very large. The toilet also has a baby toilet seat for children, which is very thoughtful. Children like the bridal chamber in the room very much. Once they enter the room, they can't get in and can't get out. This is a big praise for the design of this hotel. The software service is also very good. Lucy, our hotel butler, started contacting us before we arrived at the hotel, asking us about our arrival time and what we need, etc. He was very enthusiastic. After arriving at the hotel, he helped us arrange the room, introduced the hotel facilities and garden matters, etc., and sent us to the room all the time. During the period, he was always available for any questions, and he was responsive, very good!

I called the hotel without much hope, but I did not expect the hotel room staff I searched very carefully, and finally found the necklace pendant and platinum chain in the underground of the room and corridor. I thank the hotel staff for allowing me to recover my lost ones. At the same time, I would like to express my deep gratitude to your hotel for cultivating such high-quality and high-fashioned talents. Regards! Sincere thanks!

msg:The hotel is relatively new, with good hardware facilities. There is a butler to help coordinate the check-in (special thanks to the butler Lucy). There are many types of breakfast, but unfortunately there is only one restaurant in the hotel. The only shortcoming at present is that there are too few service personnel, some service awareness is not enough, and almost no one greets you when you go in and out. Finally, the park needs to be further improved. After the epidemic is over, I hope it will get better and better.

In the evening, we ate at the buffet, looking for a seat, but couldn’t find it for a long time. I asked the waiter if this table could be cleaned. She said that the customer hadn’t left, so we continued to look for it. She looked at us and didn’t speak. There is no waiter to remove the plate for everyone when eating. After nine o'clock the next morning, there were not many dishes left, and it was said that breakfast was until 10:30.

In the case of checking in on the third day of junior high school, the hotel cannot provide any catering services after 9:00 p.m. that day. There is only one convenience store that sells high-priced instant noodles. 2. When Ocean Park ends at 10:00 p.m., there are many hotel guests waiting for the hotel to return to the hotel by car. The hotel can only provide a battery car for late return, making most of the passengers wait in the cold wind. 3. There is no standard clothes drying rack on the balcony of the room. After calling and communicating, the customer service explained to us that there are too many guests and the clothes drying rack is used up. I have never encountered such a weird reason. So this kind of service is completely sorry for the brand Excelle and its price of more than a few thousand dollars per night.

We got to the room and told me that the room I booked was gone, could I change to a double room, and agreed to change the room. After waiting all afternoon no one agreed that we had no room. At around 6:30 in the evening, I went to the front desk and asked that I had given my room to someone else, and then there were all kinds of things. Fortunately, there was a Ctrip customer service call before I checked into a room at around 8 pm. The whole hotel is full of uncle's service, which is very unpleasant😫

When I went to check in, some people who just stayed in wanted to check out. The Hyatt Hotel is the worst experience, the service can't keep up, there is no butler, and the front desk staff said 3 yuan for children's printing jobs. More than 50 cards in the hotel are free, but the service staff actually said that it is the same if you stay in 20 hotels. We charge like this here. It used to be 5 yuan per ticket, but now it is 3 yuan cheaper. I will go, are you killing people? That’s not it. I also complained directly to 12315 whether you want to call or not. There is also a children’s paradise that needs to be reserved one day in advance. There are no people, so you still need to make an appoin**ent? funny. Bad bad.

msg:This hotel has a lot of downsides. If you want to come to Ocean Park to stay for one night, it is enough. First, there are not many people when you check in, but the processing speed is extremely slow. Two of the three counters are dealing with customer complaints. Secondly, I ordered two twin rooms with exactly the same price. The order also has two beds of 1.35 meters, but in fact, the two beds in one room are only one meter, and the other room is 1.35 meters. The beds in the two rooms are the same size. It's different, but fortunately, a baby and two adults can squeeze together. Furthermore, the location of the hotel is very remote, there is nothing to eat nearby, and there is nothing to eat in the hotel. There is only one restaurant. There is a buffet on weekends and a la carte at night. The dishes in the single menu are very simple, and you can only eat one meal. I feel that there is nothing to order for a meal, so I can only stay for one night in terms of food, otherwise there is no delicious food there. In the end, there is nothing for children to play in the hotel. The children's paradise is just a few books and a few toys, and the beach It's a fake beach, and the sand is not very clean. It's better to wait outside for me to play on the real beach. This hotel is the only hotel where I see that the front desk has been receiving complaints all the time. As long as you pass the front desk, people complain, and the supporting Ocean Park is not very fun. I am glad that I only booked for one night.

The room arranged by Ctrip's 1988 yuan single-night room coupon is a mountain view, not a paradise view. The hotel's free park shuttle bus is also very slow, so it's better to walk there by yourself. In addition, there is a problem with the front desk. Calling the front desk from the room will always take 5-10 minutes to be answered, no matter in the morning or at night. I checked out at 9:00 in the morning, and when I went to check in at other hotels at 19:00 in the evening, I was told that the ID card had not been canceled by this Hyatt, so I could not check in at other hotels.

We didn't arrive at the hotel until after 9 o'clock in the evening, and it was delayed for more than 2 hours because it was not cleaned, which affected the rest of the children! The service attitude at the front desk is really bad. When I was waiting to check in, I saw that several guests were dissatisfied, and the room would not be cleaned proactively. I specifically told the cleaning staff to come back at night and still not clean it. The front desk phone will never get through! If you need anything, you have to go to the lobby which is very far from the room! All services in this hotel are basically on their own, so choose carefully if you want to come!

msg:酒店依山靠海，環境非常不錯，入住還升級了海景房，視野開闊，能看到摩天輪和小火車，小朋友非常開心。房間很大，乾淨衞生，樓下就是泳池很方便。美中不足的就是附近沒有什麼吃飯的地方，要開車10公里左右到海韻廣場，那裡有很多吃的。歡樂世界早上10點開放，如果不包早餐的話建議自備乾糧，這樣有充足的時間去遊玩。當然酒店也有自助早餐，但是價格擺在那裡。另外就是酒店前台電話，打多次打很很久都沒人接，直叫人懷疑是不是凱悦？一個普通連鎖酒店一打前台電話都能馬上接聽，這裏的前台電話實在不敢恭維。

設施：典型的Hyatt Regency風格，設施設備很新也很齊全，餐飲種類也比較豐富，酒店內場所指引牌準確清晰，醒目易懂。
衞生：乾淨！就兩個字，是房間到大堂到工作人員，肉眼可見的細緻的乾淨。親子最關心的，泳池，很乾凈！水沒有異味（親自品嚐的😂）清澈見底！
環境：海洋歡樂世界就在隔壁，有專門的酒店客人通道，走過去5分鐘。非常方便！酒店整體設計也很漂亮，大堂正中間的鏤空望出去可以欣賞到海天一線的美景，解壓，舒暢！
感謝各位工作人員的熱情細緻和耐心，非常圓滿愉快的親子行。

酒店前台小哥Stephen服務很滿意，入住房間幫忙安排很好，在陽台就能看到煙花，下次來還找他安排。酒店其他員工服務都很熱情，等待時間有點長，五一人多可以理解。酒店活動也比較多，安排了小丑在小童泳池附近，娃娃拿到了在海洋世界沒搶到的氣球，很開心。早餐也不錯，因為人多，開放位置足夠，食品添加也很及時。
如果要來海洋世界玩，並且沒去過長隆海洋王國的親子家庭，推薦這裏。

店內員工服務與海棠灣那些網紅酒店明顯有差距，需要店家重視和培訓，比如退房時候居然碰上服務態度有問題的員工。唯一值得欣慰的是酒店管家Zoe，看得出是很努力在提供服務，贊一個。

    這次其實是第一次定陵水的酒店，在海南玩了很多地方了，這個酒店放心定吧，淡季去不排隊，孩子玩的特別高興，整個設計風格是海邊小鎮那種淺色風格的，主要玩的也衹海洋歡樂世界，長者累的話可以一家租借小車（孩子5-6歲都可以開），景色很出片，雖然淡季，基本的項目都開了，酒店帶樂園門票真是隨便玩，還有白鯨表演很不錯哦，剩下我們付費玩了山地越野車（十幾歲男孩子自己開），還有騎馬，總之感覺各個年齡段的孩子都可以很開心，從2-15歲都有能玩的項目👍👍………情侶玩也有各種驚險刺激的高空落體，摩天輪，真的不錯……晚上還有篝火表演，玩樂園的真心推薦，性價比超高！！我們定了兩晚，這個季節水上樂園沒有開，期待下次入住！

環境：酒店公共區域很漂亮，晚上開燈後整個建築有中東城堡的感覺。
設施：整體夠用，但是小童可玩的地方不多，親子酒店建議增加更多小童項目，樂園閉園時小朋友能玩能逛的選擇不多。
服務：熱情周到，管家Allen能儘量滿足住宿期間的需要需求。
有機會下次再帶家人過來玩。

環境：整體風格設計的白白的，晚上開了燈超有氛圍感，公區的植物和裝飾點綴的也很有藝術網紅感，泳池邊上的雞蛋花晚上配合燈光散發香味，很絕，還有站在房間陽台看樂園和海灣的夜景，拍照真的很出片。
設施：緊靠着遊樂園，裏面玩的很多，設施齊全，除此之外泳池也很不錯，草坪上的小棚子也很適合拍照，酒店也有很多小孩子玩的設施，退房可以直接把房卡放到前台的房卡箱不用排隊。
服務：現在沒有春節那麼多的人，服務還是不錯的，因為到的晚，第二天起的也不太早，用過早餐以後回去收拾，退房有點晚了，給前台打電話問可不可以稍晚點退，小哥説沒有問題，比較不錯，可能也是淡季房間充足的原因吧，但是工作人員的服務都蠻有温度，樂園裡麪的服務人員也很熱心，不錯不錯。
總的來講，這裡在海南真的很適合週末跟家人朋友來玩一玩，緩解一下一週工作的疲憊，樂園裡不止有小孩玩的，過山車真的超級刺激，晃動的摩天輪也很好玩（就是有點暈），坐海上列車車員還給發了免費的可樂，晚上還看了煙花秀，非常充實，物有所值可沖～

酒店裡親子設施齊全，晚上的親子活動，篝火晚會和挖螃蟹小朋友簡直太開心了。這就是不帶孩子體會不到親子酒店的好。

管家小潘超級貼心，提前加了微信好友，幫我們裝好了小朋友的床圍，一些小插曲幫我們升級了親子房，20分鐘的時間打點好了所有行李和床圍還有小朋友的洗護用品，超級棒！
好喜歡這家店的早餐，麪包真的很好吃誒！還有大堂旁邊的點心吧枱，賣的叉燒酥酥皮特別酥，超香！
晚上的草坪好熱鬧，大家圍着篝火一起跳舞，好嗨皮，泳池的救生員是我見過最温柔的了，我們小朋友比較小，沒有合適的泳圈🛟一直幫忙嘗試泳圈，很耐心，説話也很温柔！
住店還送了歡樂海洋世界的門票，海豚表演棒棒的，帶的小朋友可以稍微大一點的話玩的項目會很多！
還送了南海列車的票，轉一圈還挺舒適的。
雖然住的地方有點偏周圍沒什麼吃的地方但是有外賣而且外賣的味道還不錯！

晚上燒烤很愜意，孩子在旁邊玩兒，我一邊吃着燒烤，一邊陪孩子，哈哈！晚上的天氣也很舒服（就是蚊子有點多，得穿個長褲）

設施：配套很適合小朋友，房間內東西乾淨，設計風格也不錯，乾濕分離做的很好，寶寶不容易滑倒。廁所也是單獨的，早上不會影響洗漱。房型的視野也很好，酒店有蹦床、泳池、有小動物可以餵養，（餵食還是免費的）
親子活動：很豐富，他們有個課程表可以根據寶寶的喜好報名參加。晚上還有工作人員帶着去趕海，幾乎都能抓到，我家小朋友説很好玩。
位置：離海洋公園很近，步行可以到達，裏面設施幾乎都不用排隊，我家小朋友坐了4次摩天輪。美人魚也是不容錯過，真的很美！
會推薦給朋友來住！也希望酒店多安排點員工，辦入住的人有點少。

酒店有一個直通富力海洋世界的通道，而且可以享受一天無限次出入園區。所以中午的時候，我們是回酒店吃的午餐。另外酒店裡不管是西餐還是中餐，口味都很好。我們連續點了三次意麪和Pizza，其中有一個晚上我們是在酒店吃的晚飯，點了中餐的菜，味道也是極好的，份量也可以。
酒店自助早餐分中餐區和西餐區，品類豐富，而且很精緻。第一天無意中選了一份陵水酸粉，其美味真是驚艷到我了。
入住期間看了小丑表演，收到了歡迎小蛋糕，還有贈送的南海小火車的體驗票。
這次入住凱悦酒店的體驗真的非常棒。感謝管家IVY細心的服務。

説説酒店吧，到酒店就有行李員幫忙存行李和指導去辦理入住，服務人員詳細介紹酒店，很用心，酒店是白色的宮殿建築，藍色的海洋風格，日落時在草坪上吹吹海風看看落日。簡直就是歲月安好，有機會還會選擇入住🥰🥰

衞生：衞生還可以，在樂園附近就這一個五星級酒店，總比其他快捷的酒店好吧，主要住的放心

環境：距離海洋公園特別近，可以步行到達，建議不要開車，因為酒店有快速通道，進去直達摩天輪🎡呼呼呼…我坐了好幾遍，哈哈！

服務：大堂吧的幾個小妹妹讓我留下次比較深刻的印象，很仔細，前台人員也是笑臉相迎，推薦大家使用免費管家服務，有什麼問題可以隨時解決，幾乎時時回微信，贊！打擾客房的大姐也是特別用心，見面會打招呼。

總體，比較推薦大家錯峯來玩兒，價格實惠還不排隊，酒店體驗感➕樂園體驗都會提醒！！！

衞生：衞生環境也很好。

環境：來樂園玩一定要住這裏，方便多了。

設施：配套旁邊吃的東西不是很多，不過酒店裡都可以解決。

服務：必須吹一下這個服務，真的是太棒了。我超愛管家小潘，我們還沒上飛機，小潘就聯繫我了，然後説有啥問題都可以聯繫她，我説了我的訴求以後，小潘還給我升級房型，特別棒。第二天吃早飯時候，我女兒把自己帶的勺子丟了，還得感謝小潘花時間給我們找回來。在住宿時候，也是會時不時問我們，哪裡有問題，住的怎麼樣。真的太棒了。這管家絕對是五星級的標準，感謝小潘！

我買的是一晚帶門票，一晚帶空中列車票的，性價比很高，2晚入住+樂園門票+空中列車+早餐全部搞定

【第一天入住】
管家小潘小姐姐接待的我，貼心的安排好了房間行李，以及介紹了酒店的服務項目和設施，房間能看到宮崎駿同款列車路過，非常治癒的房間
下午在樓下游池游泳，還有泡泡音樂，非常嗨皮，晚上看錶演然後可以在酒店草坪隔着河畔看煙花，氛圍感特別好
—第一天在酒店的度假感極強的氛圍下休息的非常好，為第二天盡興遊玩養足了精神

【第二天遊園】
酒店早餐結束沿着叢林小道直接入園，這個樂園凱越酒店專門的入口，太棒了，人少不用排隊，非常快速，而且空中列車也有凱悦酒店站，實在是太方便了，入園後租輛車直接開啟完美樂園的一天
晚上閉園後，直接後門酒店專用出口無排隊離園，步行6分鐘回到自己的床上
（這個點沒住酒店的顧客可能剛走出園區門口，還在找車或者打車，非常擁擠）

【第三天離開度假區】
第三天睡到自然醒，吃飽早飯，管家小潘貼心的安排了行李員帶我們行李下樓打車
非常棒的3天2晚就圓滿結束了

【整體來講】
酒店設施+窗外美景列車和煙花+和樂園的無縫銜接+帶門票的套餐性價比+酒店服務+豐富的早餐都到位了，所以才寫了這麼多的感受分享給大家

酒店服務很棒，來之前就提前詢問是否需要管家，兩天時間管家鄭雪敏服務非常周到，每次有事都回復及時，解決到位，是位非常耐心的管家。因為第一天沒來得及玩小火車，也是管家説可以更改到第二天，自助晚餐還會幫忙預約位置。非常感謝

msg:#發現寶藏酒店[話題]# 酒店情況
[滿月R]酒店大堂在5樓
早餐、健身房、户外泳池（小朋友很喜歡）在3樓
客房3-9樓
一層有203個房間，整個酒店1000間客房
🕌景觀
在沙灘上便能看到樂園裡的海上小火車和摩天輪
給人的感覺有種童話般的唯美浪漫
酒店內也是一步一景怎麼拍都好看
🛋房間
親子房間是給我感覺蕞高級不雞肋的
地鋪式小童床像貝殼一樣融入成人的居住環境中
佈局也比其他親子房型都要合理
💌其他
可以在前台直接增訂樂園的套票
酒店住客可當日無限次入園
去海洋樂園玩的時候不用在正門排隊入園
價格也比單獨定房或是單獨買門票更優惠
🚘周邊
來凱悦住肯定是要去富力海洋歡樂世界的
從海棠灣開車過來大概是40分鐘的車程
除此之外附近的猴島呆呆島可以預留一天
再留一一天包漁船出海撈海星海膽

含樂園門票的話，酒店去樂園專屬通道，可快速入園。
還可以帶小朋友去海洋歡樂世界遊玩！暢享親子時光，還有美麗的美人魚🧜♀️🧜♀️、海獅海象海豚🐬白鯨🐋表演等。53米高的摩天輪🎡，90度垂直過山車🎢，很多項目玩不完。
我們已經打道回府了，娃還念念不忘那個美人魚表演[摳鼻]

酒店工作人員的服務也很貼心，幫忙提行李。都面帶微笑，很贊。值得再來一趟。👍

msg:新酒店感覺設施一般，同等價位的酒店比他家好太多了，在攜程很多年第一次覺得踩雷，1000的房間不帶遊樂園的門票，又花500買了門票，自助火鍋又貴又不好吃，唯一滿意的是管家的服務很貼心，對了辦理入住排隊等了1個小時，下次覺得不會再來了，海邊也特別差，親子節目也沒有什麼，主打一個不滿意

環境：酒店有個大草坪，太陽下山後在草坪上吹吹海風很是愜意。

服務：整體感覺樂園工作人員的服務態度還不錯。酒店前台效率比較低，酒店換票的工作人員態度比較敷衍，換了票要一張樂園地圖，直接説沒有。😓

酒店晚餐就一個餐廳，一個晚上的露營燒烤，但是那麼多人住在那，附近也沒有飯店，感覺酒店可以多開個餐廳，供大家選擇
早餐和自助晚餐，熱菜品種還是偏少點，398的火鍋自助晚餐在菜品上是不值的，還有就是早餐的炒飯太硬了，其他還行，補貨蠻及時。
歡樂世界比去年來弄的更好了點感覺，裏面的餐廳吃飯也還行，不難吃 份量也足，活動也很多，就是春節期間晚上的煙花表演太晚了 帶小孩的實在等不到了，很遺憾。

本次旅程最滿意的是酒店巧巧的管家服務，因為腳崴了，提前聯繫管家，讓幫忙留意輪椅，之後也是第一時間通知我輪椅可以租借了，期間我老公發燒了，管家也貼心的送來了白粥和水果，作為客人感到滿滿的温暖。
處理問題也是及時高效，包括不限於，酒店的就餐啊，海洋公園的門票，演出等等，總之，既省心又温暖。感恩

環境：周邊走遠一點就可以找到許多海星、寄居蟹，螃蟹🦀，海邊開發有待進一步完善；晚上的草地燒烤不建議去吃，口味實在不敢恭維；隔壁的歡樂世界有豐富多彩的表演，值得一看，尤其春節打鐵花的傳統技藝，給人的震撼絲毫不遜色於煙花秀

不過房間設施和景觀實在是對不起這個價格，
二十年前就開始住凱悦了，多數時候品質一直很穩定，除了陵水這個。。
三點讓人失望:
一，不好停車，春節車流大就需要有方案，而不是讓住店客人停到外面的公路邊上去。
二，房間設施不完善，門撐是壞的不能固定門，淋浴花灑兩邊漏水也是壞的？兩千多一晚什麼樣的五星級品牌都能住了，這些問題不該有吧？
三，早餐，沒有最差衹有更差。這應該不是凱悦的標準，最多也就是亞朵或者歡朋的標準，東西不多，口味一般。

首先這個套餐真是坑，嘉賓軒家庭雙床套房，餐是含兩大兩小，樂園票卻是兩大一小，買時候沒注意，來這換票時才發現，還得再花將近600元補個小孩子的票。***
酒店的坑就更多了，最不能接受的是賣着嘉賓軒的房型沒有嘉賓軒權益，直到第2天去吃早餐才發現，順着指示找到了嘉賓軒的位置，然後如圖一，問了一下服務員這裡是嘉賓軒吃早餐的地兒嗎？人家説是。。。後來感覺不對，又去了咖啡廳門口問了一下那邊的人才告訴我嘉賓軒取消了，改成小童樂園了。如圖2，嘉賓軒本來是有的，現在沒有了。但是還在賣嘉賓軒房型。
管傢什麼問題也解決不了，而且還總傳遞我錯誤的訊息。告訴我去哪兒借挖沙玩具，到了他説那地兒，沒人知道這事，又給我指到前台，然後又去到樂園換票的位置，最後又去到健身中心，都快又繞了酒店一圈才找到位置。
再説樂園，樂園並不大，但是項目和演出設定不合理，特別分散，需要來回跑重複路。租電瓶車真是一超級大坑，150一小時，一天封頂1000。我真謝謝還有個封頂，上網查了4000就能買一輛了，這車四天**，這項目回報率簡直嚇**。

msg:下午大概4點左右到酒店，門口有個牌子寫着
攜程預訂在東翼前台辦入住，去到東翼前台，有3個人站在前台，2個都説她不辦入住的，等了快20分鐘，我再問了一下其中不辦入住的人，你們這裡是不入住的嗎，正在幫別人辦入住的服務員告訴我可以去西翼前台辦入住，既然西翼能辦入住，為什麼要説到東翼辦入住，到西翼辦好入住拿到房卡，上到房間房門開不了，隔壁有個客房服務員，我和她説了房卡開不了門，讓她幫我開門，她就説拿錯房卡了吧，去找前台啊，我説我剛辦的入住，她沒理我了，我一個人帶着2歲和4歲的娃已經很累了，我是想先讓服務員開門讓我們進房間等我老公換完門票回去再去找前台，就在門口等了10分鐘左右，我老公和行李員拿行李上來，行李員問客服服務員拿萬能卡還是開不了門，然後管家過來後找工程部來看，鎖沒電了，要換電池，我老公找前台換了間房間，放下行李後就去海洋世界玩了，晚上9點多回到房間，和妹妹洗澡時發現水壓很小，連沐浴露都沖不走，10點工程部過來看説花灑堵的，拿工具修，修到快11點了，修不好，11點半又換了一間房間，馬上洗澡睡覺，第二天起來才發現廁所是堵的，又通知工程部來修，我們去海洋世界玩到晚上9點多回房間，有衹蟑螂在洗澡房，想着明天退房，不管了，到早上睡醒蟑螂還沒房間裏到處跑，吃完早餐就退房了，我把房卡放前台的快速退房箱裏，發微信告訴管家，管家也回覆我，到下午我到神州半島喜來登辦入住時，喜來登説我在凱悦酒店退房沒退出公安系統，辦不了入住，找管家後才辦好凱悦酒店的退房，這酒店給我的總體感覺非常不好

msg:凱悦的房間感覺全球都差不多，不算豪華但也夠用。離5星有點距離。周邊設施還在建設中，也多少有點荒涼。不過，跟酒店緊挨的遊樂場有點出乎意料的好，類比香港的海洋樂園，除了景色稍微差一些，不管是設施，還是遊樂園的活動，人流量都遠超。真是孩子的天堂。holly管家服務很好。圖片是週末的無人機表演，挺好看的。晚上有各種演出，很熱鬧。三亞親子游的必來之處。南海小火車沒啥意思，不是送票無需花錢購買。

酒店方面也很滿意，凱悦住過幾家都很不錯。帶小孩的話可以讓他睡沙發，鋪個毛巾，多要床被子就好了。住六樓水流也給力。早餐還可以，麪和酸粉挺好吃的。
樂園最滿意的是有代步車，所有的遊樂園都來學學吧，真的是玩的最不累的遊樂園。

msg:先説好的，1.管家Hoody很好，又是提前聯繫，又是升房的，小童房nice，帶小朋友來一定要選小童房。
2.房間面積可以，很舒服，比起樓道，味道不大。
3.員工有禮貌，會主動問好。
再説差的，1.前台效率出奇低下，之前刷到的差評是真的，排隊能排到你懷疑人生。人員業務能力不夠的話，多開幾個入住窗口啊。
2.開了兩間房，一間房等到下午5點多才順利入住，客房做不出來多招幾個人啊。
3.注意，客房不會一天一清掃，連退房都做不出來，更何況入住客人呢。
4.此次入住兩家凱悦，兩家餐廳都不盡如人意，早餐兩天重樣，晚餐自助火鍋更是個坑，桌子收拾不及時，上個鍋都需要等很久，而且還沒有你想要的鍋底。牛羊肉排大隊，寫的菜品並不提供，問服務員説是落實後堂，這一問就是渺無音訊。收錢倒是很及時。方圓十公里沒有吃的，沒有吃的。
5.酒店可玩項目少，海洋水世界更是個大坑，水世界不開門，相信我，剩餘的娛樂項目和你家門口的沒啥區別。園區大的必須得租電瓶車，500一天。
總而言之，沒有必要專程來，亞特蘭蒂斯評分那麼高是有原因的，小火車1米以上98一位，樂園門票258，房價一晚1000左右算下來真不如去亞特。

msg:從北京過來，我的酒店管家代弋Hoody提前一天聯繫我，瞭解我的入住需求，管家給升級了房型，加了嬰兒圍欄。幫我辦入職的前台笑的很甜的姑娘也非常熱情，在酒店任何角落遇到服務員都熱情的與孩子打招呼，特別值得表揚的是我的管家Hoody，真的是24小時在線！！晚上帶孩子去買可樂買不到，打客房電話沒人接，試着聯繫Hoody，立即響應。希望大家入住時也能遇到這麼好的管家，老公説暑假還帶孩子來這兒，酒店服務十分到位。最後想吐槽的是樂園換票，樂園和酒店是分開管理的，樂園那邊換票簡直是差勁，排隊的位置冷風嗖嗖的，換個票要一個小時左右，還遇到插隊，叫來樂園換票的領導他説是可以理解這種情況。樂園換票真是太缺乏管理了。

msg:服務：又一次回到歡樂世界度假區的酒真的有還是賓至如歸的感受，管家Belle每次都讓我有春風一般的服務感受，特別有海南的熱情❤️提前就和她溝通了要回來住兩天，預約好他就幫助我準備好房間，等着我們，真的感覺像老朋友回家了，一到前台還幫我抱着二寶，去年來的時候他才幾個月這下就一歲了。
親子設施：我四刷歡樂世界二刷酒店了，酒店今年是眼睛能看到的不斷的做了改進，比如我的圖一，以前那個空調對着床吹的很難受，關了又很熱，結果今年來酒店就裝了防直吹，原來三樓那裡也變成了一個小童娛樂室，早餐有小丑吹氣球，泳池沙灘，各方面都感覺更加人性化了，希望以後能有恆温泳池 哈哈～最最要誇一下酒店的娛樂，真的很棒，工作人員很有耐心，今天我們退房去參加親子活動的時候有點晚了，但是兩位手工姐姐還是給孩子編了小鳥，謝謝啦～
衞生：親子酒店最重要的就是衞生啦～特別疫情過後，對於媽媽來説是不太能接受衞生問題，最讚的是酒店非常乾淨。感受很棒很棒。

從入住到離店遇到的服務人員都很好。出行前就接到了管家電話，溝通後知道有小寶寶特意發給了我一份酒店親子活動安排並幫住預約，還有海洋公園的遊玩建議。

作為親子酒店親子活動安排的很豐富，因為要去海洋公園所以錯過了酒店活動，所以下次去會體驗。

酒店晚餐都不錯，我們**團購的悦享家庭套餐，有中餐西餐泰餐可以選擇，味道很好。還有火鍋自助、草坪燒烤可以選擇。
早餐很一般，品類不多，味道也一般，粥也是涼的，希望可以改進。
入住酒店蛋糕超mini，還必須堂食，很奇怪。

感謝客服Ivy的全程服務，有問必答迴應很及時。下次還會帶娃體驗這個酒店。

最後還是要表揚一下門口一個歲數稍大的服務員，全程熱情主動幫助搬行李，還有餐廳的幾個女服務員也挺好，樂園的煙花很美，這是住在這裏唯一讓人欣慰的地方。

優點：酒店造的漂亮，有種城堡的感覺，跨年煙花不大，但是氣氛已經到位，在房間裏就能看到，還有很多當地人一起放。有配套小童樂園，水族館，遛娃不錯。
缺點是，附近沒有其他配套，吃飯很遠幾乎沒啥外賣。過年人多造成早餐各種混亂。還有我們初一在沙灘邊放煙花，來了個穿着酒店工服，卻不三不四的人讓我們不要放，説酒店領導説不讓放，這就奇怪了，這裡是規定可以放的區域，昨天今天也明明這麼多人放，才7點多我們又不是三更半夜驚擾別人，合著我們住你們酒店，需要看你們領導心情辦事？我説你把你們領導叫過來吧，罵罵咧咧兩句灰溜溜的走了，這管理品牌酒店都管理？是靠領導心情的嗎？
還有基礎房型有點小，可以考慮升一級會有更好體驗。感覺平時人不會多，希望能運營起來，畢竟性價比還行。

從樂園到酒店，新進的服務人員很有活力，笑容滿滿，看着都讓人覺得開心。我們買的白天的樂園票，一共來了11個家庭，孩子玩的都很開心。和孩子約好下次還來。

msg:住了各種酒店，大部分給個好評，這家需要吐槽一下。

首先設施普通，屬於快捷300～400百水平的快捷酒店。檔次比較低，可以説是完工75%狀態。店內消費坑你沒商量，小童娛樂都不給你玩的機會，專坑過路客的意圖很足。不信你試試

服務主打一個慢，前台慢，換票慢，這兩點可以理解。房間送拖鞋催了三遍，一個多小時才送到。訂了兩個房間，對比才發現房間裏冰箱水和飲料都沒有部全。
更不可接受的是到第二天11點，樓層保潔竟然來催退房，這種**服務小旅館恐怕也碰不到。一千多的房費催客退房，凱越你家是怎麼搞服務培訓的？？？

衞生很差，垃圾桶基本都是全滿，早餐和下午茶的桌子上垃圾遍地，半個多小時也沒人收拾，可見酒店主打一個倉促混亂，根本沒有接待能力。

早餐就更狗血，各種排隊，食物都是空盤，場面混亂。
陵水酸粉，這是在海南吃過最難吃的，這輩子吃過最差勁的粉類食物。你在陵水連本土特色都不會做，還怎麼玩？
早餐食物大部分是半成品和科技狠活，豆腐腦的湯都快成果凍了，經理記得督促您這廚師凝膠以後少放點。

總之以後不可能再來，也不推薦入住。如果玩樂園完全可以買樂園票，還有折扣，住這酒店主打一個不值得，不值。

msg:五星酒店，五星體驗
本來入住之前看到xhs的一些評價不高，還有點忐忑，真實四個晚上住下來，我覺得是個非常好的體驗。
我們兩大兩小，主要是讓小朋友開心，房間新裝修，味道也不大。

設施：三個泳池，小朋友每天都玩的很high。停車場很大，有擺渡車，還不錯。早餐屬於中規中矩吧

衞生：都很乾凈，最後一天房間打掃的略粗糙，但是不影響心情，畢竟是滿房的情況下。

環境：那沒的説，就是環境超預期。獨佔一個角落，聯繫自駕遊為妙。週末可以看到園區煙花，這肯定是別的酒店沒有的體驗。

服務：都非常有耐心，好評！提前三天就有管家聯繫，入住期間也有問必答，非常nice

msg:酒店的早餐味道還是可以的，尤其是現做華夫餅，和麪條。
當初看到廣告，被門口的海上列車吸引的，結果由於行程太緊，錯過了房費包含的列車和樂園門票，也是因為要增加小童票（和成人票差不多價格），一下子覺得太坑不值，所以全放棄了。
酒店最大的軟肋就是地段太偏了，周邊設施都沒起來，晚上外賣都沒有的～就一個樂園。
還有就是房間和過道都是新裝修的味道，住了兩個晚上，薰的我整天都不敢關陽台的門～
雖然給我房間升了級，最後是我的錯，選了海景房……樂園房晚上能看到煙花（正好雙旦有煙花秀），讓這冷清的地方唯一有點氣氛的機會啊～錯過了～
沙灘，人造的，抓個小螃蟹，輕輕翻一下沙子，下面都是發臭發黑的淤泥……瞬間又扣分了。

除非周邊熱鬧點了，否則真不會來第二次吧……

酒店房間挺好，也挺寬敞，陽台直接能看到公園那邊還有海景。之前就看到過介紹，還有海上小火車，住店就送車票，一圈坐下來挺有意思。
餐廳的菜品挺豐富，早餐種類不少，晚餐吃了一次炒菜，吃了一次自助火鍋，在這實現了糟粕醋自由。
最後表揚管家Hebbe，從入住前就聯繫，到我們入住後幫忙安排同層同側相近房間，對於提出的需求即便下班也第一時間回覆，提醒告知我們早餐時間等，還給申請了延遲退房。
還有就是酒店性價比很好，價格不貴，攜程積分可以抵現。對於海棠灣那種熱鬧人多的地區，我還是更喜歡陵水，萬寧這種清凈一些的地方。

個人感覺海洋公園很好玩，遊樂項目比其他主題樂園的有意思，而且不排隊，可以刷很多次，玩到爽。酒店走幾分鐘就可以進入樂園，帶小寶寶的中午還可以回酒店休息一下，非常方便。酒店帶樂園票的套餐十分划算。明年來海南可能還會再住一次。

msg:酒店非常好，相比於第一次入住，有了很大的進步和提升。但也有小小的建議，希望酒店的擺渡車不管是海洋世界還是水世界，都可以擺渡送客人。並且希望以後可以送到大門口，而不是送到半路而讓客人走一截。
服務方面：我要感謝張靜小姐姐，為了我們的方便，幫我們最後一晚升級了房型，並且可以為我們延時退房。她真的是太好了哇，無微不至的關愛每一個客人的感受。
最後，還有一點點建議，對於下雨的情況，酒店可以採取一些小小的措施。比如允許酒店客人第二天夜場再去玩耍這樣子。畢竟剛玩一會就下雨，真的很會影響心情哦！
當然，關於這個價格。我們不能過分追求什麼，但如果，凱悦能先完善服務，積累人氣。再適當提升一些價格，完善樂園措施。一定可以成為海南旅遊度假區的標桿。

酒店的硬件設施也很不錯，房間設計實用，食堂飯菜質量也比較高，鮁魚餃子和早餐的現做華夫餅讓人印象深刻，晚上還送了入夜的糖水。
升級了小童房，與酒店的示意圖完全一致，有些細節可以説一下，空調出風口都做了防直吹的擋板，容易碰頭的地方都做了軟包，洗澡和衞生間是三分離設計，兩人洗澡水量也很大，同時可以使用衞生間。
雖然除了些小問題但都妥善解決了，有些管理細節可能因為疫情原因還需要磨合，總體來説好於疫情期間的很多評價，超出預期。

很適合低齡寶寶，最近的範圍內可以看很多的東西，不玩遊樂設施也可以看水族館美人魚，海豚等等根本看不完。推薦工作日入住，遊樂園人少項目隨時可以玩，衹是六點就閉園。
早餐也不錯，還比較豐富，華夫餅好吃😋
這次來有管家服務，提前跟我瞭解寶寶生日後還送了一個六寸蛋糕送到房間，十分感謝。管家鄭雪敏Ivy必須好評。

你需要的或者不需要的她都會提前想到
酒店就不用説了
環境非常好 進出歡樂世界水世界都特別方便
寶寶玩累了就可以回來睡覺
酒店的活動也非常多
篝火晚會啦 泡沫派對啦等等
都是寶貝喜歡的 這是一次非常好的好入住體驗
這次衹玩了歡樂世界下次玩水世界還會選擇入住這家酒店

msg:小朋友很喜歡捨不得走住了四天三晚，最愛尤其是親子房的榻榻米説像城堡一樣，小童餐做的挺好吃。鄭雪敏Ivy和經理對客人服務細緻照顧得很周到，幫助解決各種問題。下次玩樂園還會選擇凱悦。

msg:酒店整體還可以的，我們在店期間還有專門的管家，管家Ivy加到微信第一時間就分享酒店的親子活動表，也提醒含的門票需要換票。這兩天的入住的人有點多、導致今天的早飯排長隊太離譜了 影響我們後面行程了 我們直接開出去吃飯了。由於小孩午睡起來會有點晚跟管家説做延遲退房，也積極幫忙申請，感謝我的管家鄭雪敏小姐姐

酒店整體環境可以，就是節假日期間人一多些接待能力不足，辦理入住排隊1小時，配套的門票取還需要另行排隊再加20分鐘，這個流程的體驗不好。其餘項目的都很不錯

msg:早餐衹開了咖啡廳，吃早飯隊伍排了幾十米長，至少等30分鐘。客人這麼多的話是不是考慮下提升餐廳承載能力。雙人間衹放了一雙拖鞋，沒有孩子的洗漱用品，贈送的南海列車遇故障停運，酒店沒有事先告知，依然按期兑換了票導致直接作廢了😅

msg:酒店地理位置超級好，出門走幾步就可以到樂園，樓下有泳池，走路完全可以到達沙灘邊，可以趕海，可以玩沙小朋友玩得好開心。
酒店房間乾淨整潔，餐飲配套很好，早餐晚餐自助餐出品都很好。特別表揚餐飲部經理秦凱，服務態度好，細心，安排周到細緻。令小朋友過了一個開心的假期！
