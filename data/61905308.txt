On our 2nd stay, ( after return ing from our short holiday out of chongqing city)  the same trip the front desk upgraded our room.
 therefore, if we ever go back to Chongqing, we are for sure go back to Intercontinental.
The breakfast spread was really impressive.
Thank you very much, Intercontinental

msg:I can't promise I'll keep it short, but I'll keep it simple. It's the absolute best hotel in Chongqing. Period. There's not much to say other than it's perfect. You're going to pay a premium price, but that's usually how life works, e.g. the fastest cars will cost the most money, luxury hotels will come at a luxury price. Can you find value at lower prices, for sure, but if you can afford the price then the quality of the value you willl receive is unmatched. It's in a wonderful location, next to the river, and walking distance to tourist attractions such as hongyadong, and there is even a large shopping mall within the building. My room was spacious yet cozy, and high up with some phenomenal views. The staff was very kind to me, and spoke English well, which was wonderful because my Chinese is not good to say the least. They even gave me a sick (very cool) Chongqing guidebook with great pictures, and descriptions about varies things within the city. Breakfast was lovely, nice options of Chinese and Western food, I was even surprised they had jalapeno Tabasco sauce, which was a nice touch for my American taste buds. I didn't have an opportunity to try out the pool or the gym, but they both looked nice. If you're planning on staying at a five star hotel in Chongqing then this should be your first choice, I plan to return to Chongqing, and of course this will be where I stay.

msg:This hotel was beyond expectations. 

First, the hotel view is incredible and location is as central as you could ask for. 

There are also three bars/restaurants on the main floor (42) with exceptional views and good prices, staff is extremely helpful. Zoe, in particular, made us feel like VIP guests during our stay!

The most important, though, is the service. As a foreigner it can be fairly difficult to get virus test and results. The hotel took care of everything for me, all the way down to sending someone to pick up my paper report and sending us a picture via WeChat so we didn‚Äôt need to worry about virus protection compliance. 

Next time in Chongqing, we will go directly back to this hotel!

It‚Äôs also very clean. The room was clean and inviting with an amazing view of the two rivers and grand theatre. The food options in the hotel were good but very expensive. The rooftop bar was worth visiting at night for an epic view of the Chongqing night sky but drinks can be a little pricey. The hotel has a pool and gym that also have a great view of Chongqing. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

msg:"Chongqing Raffles InterContinental Hotel"
It is a coincidence that the only two Golden Diamond Hotel trips I have chosen are the buildings designed by GL3 and Moshe Safdie.
Chongqing Raffles InterContinental Hotel uses the history and context of Chongqing throughout its design, and uses streamlined elements to create a unique atmosphere of "sailing in the river" at high altitudes. The crystal corridor on the 42nd floor, which connects four buildings horizontally, is the "city deck" built by the designer. The diverse rare plants bring a different kind of vitality to the hotel, and the "Chongqing Forest" is truly worthy of its name.
This trip actually lasted only a short weekend, but staying at the Raffles InterContinental was indeed the right choice. We arrived at the lobby at about 8 o'clock in the morning, and the room was still being cleaned, but we received a call that we could check in after just one breakfast. All the staff members provided smiling service throughout the stay, and their fluent and standard Mandarin made me, a foreigner who could not understand Chongqing dialect, shed tears of emotion.
In terms of facilities, the room size is average, but the bathroom design is relatively small. The water is a custom-made one from Baishui Mountain, and the wide black bottle cap looks more upscale. All toiletries are Byredo, which are easy to use and smell good. I don't know which company supplied the bedding, but after walking 30,000 steps in the mountain city, I slept very comfortably at night.
Breakfast is on the left side of the hotel lobby. There are many types and the taste is OK. It is great to be able to sit by the window and enjoy the view while eating. The swimming pool is quite standard, and it is a design that all high-altitude hotels have, but it is not as good as the swimming pool of the Singapore Sands Hotel.
The housekeeper Xiao Zhu is very kind. He confirmed the accommodation needs one day in advance, and the room type provided has a good view, which is the highlight of our trip.

msg:This hotel should be the ceiling of Chongqing's main urban area, right? It was my first time in Chongqing. I wanted to stay in a better hotel and leave a good impression of Chongqing, so I chose this one. The location is very easy to find, on the 42nd floor of Raffles. The environment and design are excellent, and it is very high-end, but there are three points. I think I can give some advice to the head office. The first is that the hotel room is a little small. It is the smallest of all the five-star hotels I have stayed in. The actual usable area is about 20 to 30 square meters, which is quite cramped. Two people can't turn around a bit, and there is no place to put the suitcase. The second point is that the sound insulation is very poor. The child cried in the corridor at 8 o'clock in the morning and woke me up. Another thing is that he can't open the window, it's stuffy, and it's a bit cold when the air conditioner is turned on. The air conditioner can only be adjusted to 28¬∞ at the highest, and it can't be adjusted any higher. If the air conditioner is turned off, it's stuffy and you can't breathe in the middle of the night. I hope that our ceiling-level hotel can pay attention to these 3 points, and I hope it will get better and better in the future!

Thank you! We will all remember your kindness; we also thank Xiaozhu for her thoughtfulness in guest relations. She specially arranged for the kitchen to make small cakes and delivered them to the room. It was really considerate. She cared about the whole process from check-in to check-out. Thank you very much! At the same time, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to all the staff who have received us at the Interstate Hotel Executive Lounge; Jing Chinese Restaurant; and the front desk. Your cordial service and warm smiles have left a very beautiful birthday memory for my wife and me. We will look forward to it very much. Will come back to Interstate Hotel soon. thank you all!

msg:I am a Ctrip Black Diamond member. I have stayed in many five-star hotels at home and abroad. This hotel is the worst, worst, worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. No one can compare! 
1. Poor service! I arrived at the hotel at around 9 pm on June 2. I found the front desk by myself. There was no one to guide me except the doorman and there was no sign. After arriving at the front desk, the service attitude was also very poor. Generally, five-star hotels will provide guests with tea and the like (it doesn‚Äôt matter if there is no room, and the attitude is not good). I usually ask if I can upgrade the room. In addition, there are very few people staying in this hotel. When I booked a room, the front desk said that it might not be available. I said it might not be available or it might not be available? The front desk was always uncertain. I think it is not available, and it is not available. It is always vague and dishonest. The experience is very bad! 
2. Poor room facilities! This room is really the standard of the all-season hotel. It is not worth two thousand yuan a night at all! The cabinet is broken, the bedside stool has unknown marks, the towel is torn, and the curtain is dirty! 
3. The fruit is not ripe! The ginseng fruit is not ripe, and it can‚Äôt be chewed! The fruit was already bad, and it was still not ripe? Is this the five-star standard?
4. The next day I went out to do something at 7am. Before I went out, I pressed the button for cleaning. As a result, when I came back at 9:40 to rest, I found that it was not cleaned at all! I called the front desk and asked, and the front desk said that the cleaning lady would start work at 9 o'clock. I asked? Do you have working hours for cleaning the guest rooms? ? No one said sorry, but blamed me for asking for cleaning during the aunt's rest time?
5. The breakfast environment is poor: The breakfast floor of this hotel is actually broken bricks, which is really the same as the oily floor of the company cafeteria, broken and disgusting.

Then I asked to cancel the next two nights and asked for compensation for the first night's room fee! After official communication with Ctrip, they agreed to the request for a refund of the next two nights, but there was no compensation for the first night. They said they would give me a souvenir? It's really funny. Can you be more thoughtful? A hotel that charges for a mini bar, what valuable souvenirs can there be? How to send beggars? After that, I communicated with Ctrip again. The hotel said that they would give me afternoon tea... My god, the hotel breakfast was terrible, how could there be any good afternoon tea?
In the end, I didn't ask for any compensation. I kept communicating until the afternoon, and I left directly. The hotel didn't make an apology call, and no one contacted me. It was Ctrip that was cleaning up the mess of this crappy hotel.
For the next two nights, I used the Centurion card to book Niccolo Niccolo Hotel, with a room rate of 1500+. When I arrived at the hotel, I was upgraded. The room was big and bright, and the service was super good! The facilities were very good! I thought that the money I spent on the first night was simply defrauded!
Avoid InterContinental. All InterContinental hotels are on my blacklist from now on.

The executive lounge had breakfast, afternoon tea, and dinner. The breakfast in Chonglin Restaurant was more varied and tasted good. The small car dining car was a feature

msg:I don't give bad reviews easily, but I can't stand it anymore. I specially arranged for my parents to enjoy the star service on Mother's Day. The result was surprisingly bad. The environment, facilities, and service were similar to those of the Hampton Inn that cost hundreds of yuan a night. The room had a small practical area and it was inconvenient for three people to turn around inside. The design of the bathroom was estimated that people with a little weight couldn't get in. There was not even a sofa, just two rotten soft chairs. They said they gave me a room with a good view, but the window was dirty outside and I couldn't see the view clearly at all, and there were two rows of exterior wall shapes blocking it. You have to swipe your room card to take the elevator, and sometimes it won't sense even after swiping 5 or 6 times. The service is poor, because the hotel is on the 42nd floor, and the downstairs is connected to the Raffles Shopping Center. There is no obvious sign on the 42nd floor. When you arrive, the receptionist downstairs can't see you. I asked the security guard next to me, who didn't know if it was the mall or the hotel, how to get to the hotel lobby, and he even gave you an impatient sidelong glance. I asked for directions several times and finally got upstairs with two elderly people and a 17-month-old child. No one helped me pick up my luggage. A slightly better place is the Jialing River breeze by the swimming pool and open-air bar. I don't know how it got five stars, and I don't know why it's worth more than 1,900 a night. The hotel's consumption details are unclear. It's wrapped in white paper, next to the snacks, and if you don't pay attention, it won't be raw at all. An old man ate a bag of nuts for 28 yuan. After reporting it to the front desk, they said sorry and free snacks. After visiting Hongyadong, my feet were tired. I went back and ordered a Heytea. The takeaway was not delivered upstairs, so I had to go down and get it myself. The hotel breakfast was not delicious. When the child went to the bathroom during the meal, the waiter pointed me to a maze bathroom where I had to go down 4 stairs and push 5 doors. I felt helpless holding the child. In a word, it was a big disappoin**ent and the experience was extremely bad. This is the first hotel I want to blacklist.

msg:Environment: Not to mention the environment, the best location in Chongqing is the Chaotianmen landmark building.
Facilities: The toilet and bathroom are separated. Very good design. The only flaw is that I didn't find the razor. I don't know if I didn't find it or if it wasn't there in the first place.
Hygiene: In addition to the normal cleaning in the morning, the room was also tidied up when turning down at night, which was very considerate.
Service: Everything else is very nice, even when I asked about it when I was sick. But I communicated with the hotel on the phone 10 days before check-in.
I want a non-smoking room (let me know it's ok)
I want a senior executive (let me know and I will arrange it)
I get off the plane at 12 o'clock and will arrive at the hotel at about 12:30 (I was told that normal check-in is at 3 p.m., but they will help me make a note, but not necessarily)
The day before check-in, the hotel called me (probably to confirm the itinerary) and asked me if I had any check-in requirements. I still mentioned the above three points and I would arrange it at the hotel in Kochi.
On the day of check-in, I arrived at the hotel around 12:30. When helping me check in, the front desk guy took the initiative to mention my needs and informed me that the room had been cleaned again and that a room would be available in about an hour. I said okay, I'll come over after lunch to get the room card.
At about 2 o'clock, I returned to the hotel front desk and asked if I had the room card. I was told that I needed to wait a moment and asked for help. I waited for about 15 minutes and asked again, and was told that no one had responded to him. I waited until 3:05 before I went to the front desk and asked if it was already 3 o'clock and could I give the room card. Just gave me the room card.
My complaint is: If you can only hand over the room after 3 o'clock, why did you inform me that the room was cleaned at around 12 o'clock? It only takes about an hour. If it weren't for this sentence, I would have gone shopping directly after dinner instead of waiting at the hotel front desk for about an hour and a half.
You are one of the hotels representing the highest standards in Chongqing. Personalized service should not be taught by the public! Because this affects my mood during the day of travel‚òπÔ∏è

msg:As a severe lazy cancer patient, I have never taken the initiative to write a review on a hotel I have booked on Ctrip for many years. "Thank you" for this experience of staying at Raffles City InterContinental Chongqing, which gave me the motivation to write a review.

On May Day, I accompanied my family to Chongqing to visit friends. I wanted to make the stay more comfortable for the elderly and children, so I specially booked two executive rooms with river view. The reservation was made blindly because I have always believed in the quality of InterContinental Hotels. But from the moment I checked in, I regretted it. The experience in the next few days made my regret stronger and stronger.

Let‚Äôs talk about the room first. I booked an executive room with river view. When I arrived at the hotel at almost 5 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, there was still one room that had not been packed out. As soon as you open the door, you have a strong sense of being in a hotel. I cannot praise the unique river view in this room. With my height of 1.6 meters, I can only lower my head and see the faint river view through the gap. Lying on the bed and looking out, I felt like I was living in a cage. There is also the soundproofing effect of the room. I can hear the doorbell ringing in the next room, let alone the voice. The most bizarre thing is the anti-human design of the toilet seat and flush button, which makes me wonder if I have really booked an InterContinental Hotel? I won‚Äôt say much about the cleanliness of the hotel. The most interesting thing is that the TV is completely invisible. Maybe the hotel wants us to watch less TV and play more with our mobile phones. The hotel has also taken great pains to save electricity. There is a sensor at the door. As long as someone goes out and there is no one moving in the room, the power will automatically turn off after a few minutes, including the air conditioner, which will automatically switch to heating mode. The power will not be turned on unless someone in the room walks around in the hallway. You can imagine this scenario. I was taking a lunch break in my room, checking my phone, and my child came from grandma's room two or three times to get things. Every time she went out, the power would automatically turn off after a few minutes, and I would have to sit up from the bed. , walk around in the aisle, and then turn the air conditioner back to cooling mode.

Let‚Äôs talk about dining. I was afraid that the big restaurant would be crowded in the morning, so I went to the executive lounge. Since I was a family of four, I found a table for four by the window closest to the entrance. Unexpectedly, it was right opposite the entrance and exit of the kitchen. It was very lively with people coming and going. I ordered a bowl of wontons and the inside was still hard. So I chose to go to a big restaurant the next day, at least I could watch the noodle chef operating. On the morning of departure, a super embarrassing scene happened that I have never encountered in a five-star hotel. I am a very disciplined person. When I came to the noodle stall for breakfast, I found that there were several customers queuing up. I very consciously started to judge which side was at the end of the queue. When I saw the "queue here" sign standing next to the noodle stall. I confirmed my place in line after seeing the sign, but just after the customer in front of me took away his noodles, I asked the operator to give me a bowl of noodles. She coldly said to me, "Go over there." Waiting in line, you made the wrong mistake!" I was stunned and began to quickly think about what I had done wrong. As a person who hates jumping in line, there is no way I would do such a thing. The customers around me looked at me, embarrassed. I asked her, what does this "queue here" sign mean? Aren‚Äôt the representatives starting to line up here? She said again that you were in the wrong queue and queued over there. I was very angry, but in order to get noodles for my child, I went over there and queued up again. At this moment, a chef inside ran out and put the original noodles on the opposite side. The sign got me a place to queue up again, and I was instantly petrified! It's obviously you who put the sign in the wrong place, why do you say that the guests are in the wrong place? Don't you think this is a great humiliation to the guests!

This was the worst hotel stay experience in years. In short, I will come back to Chongqing, but I will never stay at Raffles City Chongqing InterContinental Hotel again! I will also run around telling my relatives and friends to avoid falling into the trap!

Also, the mini bar price list was a bit suspicious, not clear which items were charged and which were free. We left a bag of potato chips (small), 2 bags of fried dough twist (small), and a bag of nuts from the mini bar. The next day, we looked for the price list after seeing other people's comments. After reporting it, the hotel took the initiative to give us free items. The snacks together cost more than 90 yuan, but I still felt uncomfortable. It was not a matter of money, but a bit unclear. Overall, it was OK, the experience was very strong, and the room was also very good!

This hotel is in a great location and has a great view
Raffles City is downstairs. It's very convenient if you want to eat or buy something. It's also very convenient to take the subway.
There is a glass balcony outside the western restaurant with a great view!
The view from the pool is also great
There is also a dedicated person to guide you at breakfast every day, so you don‚Äôt need to fight for a seat. The only hiccup was that I met a very domineering person who came in without a ticket at breakfast. It was an eye-opener.
All in all, this is a highly recommended hotel when traveling to Chongqing.

The sound insulation of the hotel is also very good, and no noise was heard during the stay. The breakfast is arranged in a unique way. In the small cars, it is a bit interesting to hunt for treasures. The food is also very rich. My mother, who is good at cooking tea eggs, is also amazed at how their tea eggs can be cooked so well. I joked that you should ask the chef for advice, which is also an unexpected gain from staying in this hotel. The day before check-in, a staff member took the initiative to contact me and tried to meet my needs for early check-in.

Okay, just pretend I didn't mention it! Let me put it this way, if I put the same price as the All Seasons and it together and let me choose, I would choose the All Seasons!

I have stayed at these hotels before when I went to Qiandao Lake, Kunming, Lijiang, Suzhou, etc. Their self-operated restaurants are also good, except for Lijiang where some of the restaurants are outsourced and the performance is poor. Raffles InterContinental is still quite iconic, but the front desk service gives me a sense of belonging. When there are many people, they are a little aloof and not very patient. This is the biggest difference between the InterContinental hotels I have stayed at. The best experience is the Regent Hotel where I stayed last time.

msg:This time I stayed at InterContinental Chongqing Raffles. The overall experience was good. There was a small problem during the stay, and Pan Xin of the hotel solved it very well. I am also very grateful for the help of the hotel lobby manager. Thank you very much. I like the chocolate desserts very much, and the souvenirs are very suitable. I went to many places in Chongqing and liked it very much. I will come back to stay next time I have the opportunity! I like the service of the hotel staff and thank Xiao Pan for his dedication!

msg:A very satisfying stay. The hotel is in a very good location, and it is very convenient to go to nearby attractions. The river view in the hotel is also beautiful. The glass terrace of the hotel bar is so unique and worth experiencing. When it comes to the hotel's service, it is quite good. The day before check-in, Ms. Xiao Zhu called to confirm the arrival time and related check-in preferences. During the stay, she called again to ask about the check-in experience and whether she needed any help. It made people feel like spring breeze and happy. The room arranged according to their preferences was also very satisfactory. The room service concierge service was also excellent. I will definitely stay again next time I come to Chongqing.

She answered a lot of questions I asked when I checked in, and she was not impatient at all. She also introduced me to many places to shop and eat nearby. The room was perfectly arranged, the breakfast was very rich, and she also prepared the invoice for me in advance. This is my first time staying here, but I will probably choose to stay in this hotel in the future. Finally, thank you again Rebecca, I hope she gets better and better! ! ! !

msg:The hotel is located near Chaotianmen, with a good geographical environment and a great location for admiring the two rivers. However, in terms of interior decoration, hardware facilities, room hygiene and room service, the hotel is at the level of a slightly high-end business hotel. The decoration of the guest rooms is extremely simple and the materials used are relatively low-end. The sanitary facilities are crowded and narrow, and the passenger elevators are of average quality. The only thing that high-star hotels have is that they have an indoor swimming pool and a gym, but the swimming pool is short and shallow, making it more suitable for children. The food and beverages are average. Both the products in the executive lounge and the Chonglin Restaurant are not as good as those of a five-star hotel, and are far behind the nearby Westin. All in all, the price is more than it deserves. You can experience it for one night. If you want to be comfortable, the Westin is recommended nearby.

Service: Xiaohe calls in advance to inquire about room requirements, and Xiaoyu, Xiaozhu and Xiaoguan can contact you at any time to provide assistance. Every time I pass by the front desk, I will take the initiative to say hello, and they can also help store my luggage. The breakfast has a variety of varieties and tastes very good. There are welcome fruits and special snacks in the room. They specially made brown sugar water glutinous rice balls for the Lantern Festival. I will choose here next time and recommend it.

  The service of modern luxury hotels is explained by all hotel employees in a textbook version!

  First impression: Customer service Ms. Wei patiently listens to customer requests and follows up. After that, hotel guest relations Xiao Yu used WeChat to help me arrange the room I wanted in advance and introduced all the relevant information in detail! Arrival at the hotel is located in the arrival hall on the LG floor. Take the elevator to the hotel's sky lobby. FD CiciLiu will receive you for check-in. The meticulous care. I didn't say service. It's not a cold service, but a warm greeting. The chat made me feel more cordial. ! It feels like catching up with an old, familiar friend. Check-in was completed quickly with professional and familiar skills, and the concierge man asked if he needed help with luggage. The concierge was also very cooperative and asked enthusiastically with a smile.

 Arriving at the room, you will find comfortable, bright and warm decoration and brand-new hardware facilities. It‚Äôs really comfortable! As night falls, just as guest Xiao Yu said, the guest room carefully selected for us faces the Yuzhong Peninsula. Overlooking the entire central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãChongqing, the night view is beautiful! Knowing that my girlfriend and I needed to take photos, the guest room lady was also very enthusiastic to help us take photos. Even when I went out at night, the clothes scattered randomly on the bed were carefully folded for me in the guest room, turned down, and waited for us to go back to rest!

 The next morning, I went from the room to the restaurant, a luxury international hotel, and there is no need to go into details about the types of breakfast. What I want to specifically mention is the soup chef who is in charge of breakfast omelettes in the morning (if I didn't see it). He is a little chubby with glasses and is very attentive. He helps us make egg white rolls. He even noticed our place at the table and personally served us egg rolls when the meal was about to end!

 Yes, it is these details that constitute hotel service. I think this is more than just an ordinary pleasant stay experience. This is more of a feeling!

 Again, thank you! Guest Relations: Xiao Yu, Xiao Zhu, Xiao Yi FD: CiciLiu F&B: Chef Tang and all the staff who serve us! thank you all! See you next time!

When she saw me bringing my son, she arranged a room for me with both city and river views. It was really thoughtful! Knowing that my flight back was at 5pm, she helped me postpone my check-out to 2pm after I asked. I am really grateful. After entering the room, the table was sticky. I called the front desk and the waiter came and wiped it immediately. The hotel is located in Raffles City, which is very convenient for traveling and eating. All in all, I am very satisfied with my stay this time. I will stay at Raffles City Intercontinental next time!

msg:I am very grateful to all the service staff of InterContinental Hotel for leaving me with perfect memories of this Spring Festival family trip! My 82-year-old mother in Chongqing is not suitable for long-distance travel because of her inconvenience in legs and feet, so I rushed back to Chongqing from Guangdong to accompany her. But I wanted my mother to see more new landscapes in Chongqing, so I chose the Raffles InterContinental Hotel where I had stayed before. The front desk staff called to inquire about my needs on the morning of the check-in day. After informing me, they arranged a high floor with beautiful scenery and wide views, and also gave me fruits. The staff in the lobby also helped us take beautiful photos! Mom was very happy to see the new and vibrant Yuzhong Peninsula in the room and enjoy the bright night view of Chongqing. The most beautiful picture in her mind during this Year of the Dragon is brought by InterContinental Hotel. Thanks to all the service staff of the hotel. I hope I can bring my mother to experience the beautiful night of InterContinental again next time!

Environment: Beautiful environment, many people
Service: I took the initiative to pick up my luggage and praised it well. The lady at the front desk was nice. I originally wanted to give it five stars, but it fell apart later. First, I was treated differently when I went to the viewing platform. The young man and lady in front reported the room number and did not need a room card. , but I needed to show my room card. The young lady in front of me turned around and asked the little brother for a room card, but she still didn‚Äôt ask for a room card, so I was not worthy. Second, on the day of check-out, I was asked to take my luggage to store it. This was the first time I encountered this problem. It arrived, and it was delivered to me after I requested it. In addition, Marriott was angry with me afterwards (Marriott is really a ****, whoever lives in the hotel is a big bastard, and is a black man all his life. In comparison, InterContinental is okay, so there is still no negative review in the end. ), I felt that I was being treated differently. Poor *Sis like me are most likely not the target customers. Therefore, here is a suggestion to increase the price, add two more zeros, start at six digits, and do not need to receive *Sis customers. I am happy, and I also discovered ** Ctrip Members are not human beings, so it is recommended that you don‚Äôt need to be linked to these two platforms and sell it yourself, without a middleman making the difference, which is more enjoyable. Not a black man, the experience is like riding a roller coaster. You are happy at the beginning, but your hips are stretched in the middle, and your mood is ups and downs. I recommend the Regent next door, but if you want to stay in Marriott, you might as well choose InterContinental (compared with peers). Compare Marriott, InterContinental yyds, Marriott It's just a fly that fell into the soup. It takes it out and grinds it into powder for you to continue eating. The Marriott store is not disgusting, but the customer service on the phone ‚òé is disgusting. In order not to be confused by its dog walking phone number************ and The kicking phone number is *********** disgusting. I recommend InterContinental. Except for a few staff members, there are no disgusting phone calls. However, the Intercontinental phone number is useless and the turndown service is not available, so I deducted three out of five. Leave one for the doorman, thank you for helping me with my luggage, and leave one for the lady at the front desk.

msg:The hotel is located at Chaotianmen Pier, surrounded by the bustling Liangjiang River, and about ten minutes' walk from Hongya Cave and Hu Guang Guild Hall. The lobby, restaurant, and bar are all very well designed. The decoration of the rooms is slightly weak. The overall service is goodüëç. There was heavy fog during the first two days of check-in, which affected the viewing effect. Fortunately, it cleared up on the third dayü§≠. There is not much difference between a river view room and a city view room. When choosing, you can consider the price comprehensively. Overall highly recommended.

Special thanks to customer service manager Xiao Zhu, who has been communicating since before check-in and helped with check-in. Since it's a child's birthday, please arrange it in advance. The balloons and light signs are so cute. He also helped us bring the cakes we ordered from the restaurant to the room. I‚Äôm so satisfiedüëçThere‚Äôs also a small handwritten card.

With this level of design and quality of decoration, can it be considered a high-end hotel? In short, this is an InterContinental that is ruined by details. Guests who have certain requirements for the quality of hotel facilities should choose carefully. However, the service is still a satisfactory InterContinental standard, which greatly makes up for the shortcomings of the facilities!

Service: The white-haired uncle at the entrance of the hotel is very enthusiastic. He helps with luggage and greets him warmly every time he comes in and out. Especially the guest relations staff Xiaoguan, Xiaotang and Xiaoyi, the three young children, are very enthusiastic. He called me the day before I checked in to ask about my preferences for the room, and all the questions I had noted about the room were arranged for me. The snacks and spicy beef provided were produced by the hotel and tasted very goodüëç. After checking out I also like it very much when I gave you a small giftüíï. In short, during these two days at Intercontinental, you can feel the enthusiasm of every employee, plus convenient peripheral facilities, comfortable bedding, and rich breakfast (plus a sentence "if breakfast It would be better if there were more hot dishes) It made me very happy these two daysüòÉ
Facilities: The bar at the end of the crystal corridor has a glass observation deck, which is very photogenic. It should be more beautiful at night. The swimming pool is also very beautiful.

Cleanliness: The aunt who cleans the room is warm and considerate. When she returns to the room at night, she turns down her bed in advance.


Environment: Raffles is right next to the hotel entrance. It is very convenient to buy things. You can call a taxi at any time. You can walk to Hongya Cave. The elevator goes directly to the crystal corridor on the 42nd floor. It is so high that it really makes people feel like they are there. Just like in the clouds, many trees have been transplanted into the lobby. The green color looks particularly comfortable. The simple front desk and sofa are the kind of look I like very much. Simple yet elegant.

I am looking forward to my next trip to Chongqing. I will also choose Raffles Intercontinental

Service: I read a lot of reviews complaining about the bad service, but I think it's okay. The young lady and brother who checked in were very nice. There is a little boy named Xiaoguan who is good, so praise him by name. There was also a young lady who helped us check the hotel occupancy rate and delayed our check-out time.
What needs to be improved is the mini bar. At least there are two bars of Coke and so on. Whether you drink it or not is one thing. Whether or not you put it is InterContinental's attitude.

The bathroom and toilet are separated and clean. The capsule coffee machine and refrigerator are fully stocked with drinks. What is surprising is that you can lie on the thick bed Watching the sunrise from bed...
The three little girls in the guest relations depar**ent (Xiao Guan, Xiao Zhu and Xiao He) are also great. They take turns asking me what my needs are via WeChat every day, and they send me small desserts in the evening. The warm feeling makes me love this place so much.

The Raffles City shopping mall downstairs is also very easy to visit. There are supermarkets, souvenirs, children's play areas, cloud walks, and snack streets... I want to go there every day... I will have to arrange it again during next year's holiday in Chongqing. I will continue to stay at Raffles City to make up for it. There is no feeling of enjoyment!

I thought that such an expensive hotel should be good in all aspects (we stayed at 52, the price was about 3400) and decided to make the decision without reading the bad reviews. After checking in, my god, the smell. It's really amazing. The smell of the room is beyond words. The location is also very bad. There is a viewing platform in front of it, which is blocked. We booked a double bed. The room is really crowded. Two suitcases can just fit in. One more. It may have to be placed at the door. The bathroom is also small and pitiful. If you are a little fatter, you will have trouble entering and closing the door. It is really just a facade. There is another thing about breakfast. Because I didn‚Äôt eat much of the fruit because I was afraid of wasting it, I asked the waiter to take a packing box and pack it back to the room for the children to eat (because the children hadn‚Äôt gotten up yet, so they didn‚Äôt come down to eat). However, the waiter said that they couldn‚Äôt pack it, and their attitude was also bad. No, it seemed like we were taking advantage. They asked us about our room number and so on. It was just a few pieces of fruit. The picture below is from a five-star hotel. There were only four pieces of fruit for breakfast. Ordinary hotels wouldn't be so shabby. The layout of such a big hotel is really too small. Let‚Äôs learn more from Hyatt. Whether it‚Äôs service or environment, they really beat InterContinental and will always be a blacklisted hotel.

It is within walking distance to Jiefangbei, Hongya Cave, Huguang Hall and other popular attractions and business districts; the rail transit station is just downstairs, extending in all directions; the high-altitude observation deck is a test of courage; needless to say, the service is attentive and patient.

msg:Please keep your valuable advice, I will bear the anger myself. The service in the breakfast restaurant is so bad. I have never seen a breakfast buffet that rushes people to eat. It ends at 10 o'clock and the rush starts at 9.30. What's even more annoying is that my mother and I took something and put it on the dining table. We turned around to get something to drink. When we came back, the waiter took all our untouched meals away. Are they short-sighted? Leave the menu card on the table and take away the complete food without touching it? We went to get food all over again and were urged to eat quickly! It's so disrespectful. I lost my temper, but I apologized. If I didn't lose my temper, I would let you bully me? After the hotel called me, there was no substantive response. A good day was ruined by a bad breakfast! I'm a layman. The room I booked costs more than 2,200 including breakfast and more than 2,000 without breakfast. I specifically chose the room including breakfast. Since I didn't get the service I deserved for the money I spent and the experience was poor, I don't want to pay for this. Pay for the breakfast, and all other apologies are false. Please reflect on this and do not accept any form of criticism. You deserve this bad review.

Thank you handsome guy at the front desk for a free upgrade to the Liangjiang executive room. The scenery is beautiful and the height is good. You can have a panoramic view of Liangjiang. The bath and toilet are separated I like it very much, the privacy is better, the breakfast is rich, and the color matching is also very good. Once you enter, you will have a big appetite and want to eat everything (Regent's breakfast is slightly less variety, but Regent's breakfast see There is no charge for 9-year-old children. Intercontinental over 140cm is charged as an adult. I personally think that half price is more reasonable. After all, I am not an adult.) The water in the room is pure water. Fees, a bottle of pure water with a few cents a bottle is really downgraded, Lijing is the Baisui Mountain mineral water like it! The three intercontinental pools of the swimming pool are more interesting, and children prefer it. I like both gyms. You can go to the gym at any time by swiping your room card. For toiletries, Regent carefully prepares facial masks. InterContinental does not. If you want to see the night view of Hongyadong, choose Regent. If you want to see the night view of Liangjiang, choose InterContinental. I like both of them very much, and the service is also very good. I will stay here again in the future

Mr. Xiaoguan from the hotel's guest relations depar**ent took the initiative to call me before I checked in. He happened to be there when I checked in that day. Not only did he upgrade the room type for free, but he also asked the hotel to arrange for exquisite pastries and delicious small twist snacks. The breakfast on the 42nd floor of the InterContinental Hotel is still rich in variety. There are also local specialty noodles and other breakfast items. I must praise Chen Yanqing, the kitchen staff of the hotel restaurant, in real-name form. Because I brought my family to stay this time, the elderly at home have diabetes and cannot drink sugary yogurt. After asking the staff in the yogurt area, they said they all had sugar. After learning this, Ms. Chen Yanqing took the initiative to send her family another original yogurt without any sugar, and took special care of the elderly at home during the meal. The elderly was very touched and told her after returning to the room. I must praise it. In addition, the hotel staff Xiao Yi and the front desk miya also have good attitudes. I have stayed at some other InterContinental hotels in China before, but the level of hardware, software and services at Raffles InterContinental far exceeds others! The hotel's location is excellent. There is a subway station and a shopping mall downstairs, with everything you need to eat, drink, and have fun. It only takes ten minutes to walk along the river to Hongyadong, which is the best choice for staying in Chongqing. I will stay again next time I come to Shancheng.

msg:Love at Raffles InterContinental Hotel
Writing this title makes my heart feel warm. As new arrivals in Chongqing, we chose Raffles Intercontinental Hotel after comparing many hotels. Now that I think about it, my family all praised me for making the right decision.
Let‚Äôs talk about service first. Because I was sending my children to school, I was really unfamiliar with the place and was full of strangeness to the city of Chongqing. I called the hotel in advance, hoping that the hotel could arrange a quiet room on a higher floor. We got off the bus after arriving at the hotel the day before yesterday. Before we even entered the hotel, the young man who picked up the guests came forward very enthusiastically, offered to help us carry our luggage, and told us to take the elevator to the lobby. Arriving at the lobby, the hotel lobby on the 42nd floor is refreshing, with an unobstructed view of the beautiful scenery outside the window. The sister-in-law who checked in, Liang, quickly checked us in. The hotel arranged a room on the 61st floor for me, and even the express delivery I purchased in advance was already placed in the room.
I like the welcome fruits, retro kettle, coffee machine, mineral water, wet and dry separated bathroom, and large bathtub.
Standing in the room and looking out the window, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery.
The breakfast the next day had many varieties, the service was good, and the meal was closed in a timely manner.
Such a beautiful Raffles Intercontinental Hotel is our only choice when visiting Chongqing and is highly recommended.

Facilities: The hotel lobby is on the 42nd floor. Check in on the 51st floor. The scenery outside the window is invincible. Whether it is the Yangtze River Cableway or the nearby Yunyun Paradise, you can see clearly. The Dyson hair dryer and Toto toilet are all very powerful.
Hygiene: Getting out of bed at night and tidying up during the day are very timely.
Service: Since entering the hotel, the staff you meet all have sincere and warm faces. very kind!

Environment: After checking in, we enjoyed it in the lobby bar. Look at the scenery below, very comfortable.

Second, the scenery is absolutely unbeatable, you must book a river view room
Third, Lisa's service is very good and responsive to every request. Thumbs up!
Fourth, if you bring children, you should still choose InterContinental.
If it is not a flaw, it is that the room area is slightly smaller, 3 square meters less.
In addition, the surrounding traffic is a bit annoying.
When we come to Chongqing again, we will choose Raffles InterContinental.

msg:This is the worst InterContinental hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are small and pitiful, and the decoration on the exterior wall is very unsightly. The most beautiful thing about Chongqing is the city view. Living here does not give me this experience. The shampoo and shower gel used are in bulk like other business hotels. The deposit paid by WeChat will not be returned for a day, and you have to call to get it refunded. The design of the hotel lobby is also unreasonable. It is very inconvenient to go out at night. You have to go through the mall. You can't find the exit on the LG floor of the mall. You have to go to the 4th floor of the mall to find the exit to Chaotianmen Square. A room priced at 1,400 yuan is no different from staying at the Atour Hotel. It is not cost-effective at all. It is much better to stay at the Westin. At least the rooms in the Westin are larger than those in the Intercontinental, and they have a view, making it convenient to go out.

Outside the glass curtain wall was the Liangjiang Waterway. The Crystal Gallery Bar has an outdoor area with a glass floor, and you can see the street nearly 200 meters below, which is very cool! This time I booked a river view room. The photos show the different scenery outside the window during the day and at night. They are both beautiful. The hotel is in an excellent location, a few hundred meters away from the Liberation Monument, and very close to Chaotianmen Hongya Cave and Qiansimen Bridge. A dozen meters away from the hotel door is the Raffles City shopping mall, where you can find everything you can think of. The staff is very considerate. Xiao Zhu at the front desk called twice to inquire about the check-in experience and gave us snacks.
I will stay here again next time I come to Chongqing.

After making the reservation, the hotel's representative immediately called to inquire and communicate. Considering that the guest had arrived early, he tried his best to arrange early check-in and upgrade to the executive river view room. One floor-to-ceiling window of the hotel's executive river view room faces the Yangtze River, and the other floor-to-ceiling window faces the Jialing River. You can overlook Hongya Cave and the Internet celebrity Qianxun Bridge. The scenery is excellent. From the ground floor lobby to the sky lobby to the room, there are hotel staff greetings and guidance all the way, and the service is cordial and thoughtful. The hotel's facilities are all the most fashionable, including electric curtains, smart sanitary ware, sensor light controls, etc., as well as fruits, capsule coffee, etc. It is close to the subway and is convenient for transportation. The surrounding area is also convenient for different levels of dining and shopping. After purchasing an evening ticket, Xiao Zhu learned about the situation and postponed check-out so that the guests could have more rest. The services of this hotel including the swimming pool are quite good.

Fortunately, I changed to the InterContinental Hotel in Raffles City in time. There is no harm if there is no comparison. The day before check-in, I received a serious and polite inquiry from the customer service steward about check-in habits. The room arranged was on the 60th floor, with river views on three sides. Chongqing‚Äôs beautiful scenery is as far as the eye can see. From check-in to room service and cleaning, you can feel the very sincere service. Especially the staff in the executive lounge, summer, Vivi, freya, YANA, Jocelyn, and Lily, the service is so warm that it feels like returning to a warm home. Their demeanors are all beautiful, just like the smiling service of the airline's first-class cabin. The chefs at the Executive Lounge also provide excellent food for every meal. Especially at dinner, the Sichuan dishes are presented in small plates and are very special. Thank you Raffles InterContinental for leaving us with wonderful memories of Chongqing.

We live in a one-bedroom room, the design of the room is very reasonable, and the river view is also very beautiful. Because children can't eat spicy food, they basically eat in the executive lounge. This is one of the biggest surprises of this stay. Our Raffles IHG Executive Lounge, whether it is service, meals, or viewing a**osphere, experience is one of the best in China. Even in the busiest travel season in Chongqing, the crowd control and service level of the entire lounge are still online. Vivi and Summer also gave us very enthusiastic service and help. The children had a great time eating and playing, and they were greatly appreciated. Reduced the fatigue of our travels.

The hotel's swimming pool and other related facilities are also not bad. Generally speaking, although the sparrow is small, it has all internal organs. It is very convenient to go downstairs to the pier to take a boat, or walk to Hongya Cave or Jiefangbei.

I would like to make a small suggestion. We took the subway to Raffles City because the children got motion sickness. When we first arrived, we were a little lost because the subway came out on the third floor (laughs). I hope we can provide some navigation and guidance for more residents in the future , it will be much more convenient. After all, for many foreign friends in Chongqing, finding a way is a big challenge.

When I pushed the door of the room, I knew I had chosen the right one! (You can have a panoramic view of the river on both sides, see the photo without retouching for details üíó)
The room service is timely and smiling all the way, and the turndown service is also very good! (Welcome to eat peaches and apples before remembering to take pictures üòÄThe quality of the fruit is also very good and the details are thoughtful)
In the afternoon, I went out to play in the hotel. Xiao Zhu made a phone call. He was considerate throughout the whole process and learned that we brought children with us when we traveled. He also thoughtfully prepared Chongqing special snacks. The children liked it very muchüòä
Finally, I gave a special thumbs up to Uncle Menying on the LG floor. I feel that Menying in a five-star hotel must have an amiable uncle. When we left the gate after depositing our luggage at around 2 o‚Äôclock yesterday afternoon, we learned that we wanted to go shopping at Raffles City. We told in characteristic Chongqing Mandarin that the escalator on the right hand side was directly accessible, and told that going out from Gate 3 on the 4th floor of the mall was the best place to take pictures. So there are the first two pictures, which are really beautiful! I really feel the meticulous service at the last moment of departure. My uncle's introduction made me decide to choose this hotel for my next trip! (Uncle must be a star employee, it is recommended to add chicken legs to uncle! üòÄüòÄüòÄ)

Even staying in a hotel feels like it has become a tourist spot, and the experience will be poor if there are too many people! The room is small, and the room style is too similar to Morpheus Macau. The breakfast is very rich, and the style and products of the restaurant are very good! like very much! The coffee bar is also good, the fat little brother has a good service, answering every question, and helping to solve the problem, I remember this! But that night the hotel customer service only called and asked me to name and praise on Ctrip, which I really disagree with.

The service is rigid, not professional and heartfelt, and is relatively rigid. Room cleaning also needs to be improved. The hotel lounge and front desk basically only ask and answer questions, and there is no sincere service to guests! I stayed for three days and was assigned to a lower floor.

I arrived at the hotel at around 12 noon. I wanted to send my luggage up and go out to do errands while driving. The waiter at the door said that parking was not allowed at the door. There were plenty of parking spaces at the door. I explained to him that I would go up and put the luggage in the room, and I would drive. If you are worried about going out to do errands, I will keep the car on and leave the keys in the car. If there is an emergency, you can move the car at any time. The waiter proudly said that we do not have valet parking service and must drive to the underground parking lot of the InterContinental Hotel. Is this the service attitude? I‚Äôm here to consume, not to be annoyed during the Chinese New Year.

Unbearable, I communicated with the front desk on the phone and responded proudly: the river view rooms are blocked by fences, these fences are light *****s, and the lights will be on from 20:30 to 22:00, which is the image of Chongqingü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è and I dare not live inside. Take the river view room without rails found on the Internet and head straight to the lobby before changing to a normal room type. (Picture 2) The process is tiring. A deposit of 7000 was paid in advance when checking in, and 2451.66 was refunded, which is equivalent to paying 4548.34 room charges. To deal with 4548, why is it 0.34 more? There is no explanation from check-in to check-out. Although the value of 0.34 is small, it is true that the hotel is not rigorous and has no sense of service. The cleaners are worthy of praise, only they can represent the attitude that InterContinental should have in Chongqing

A little comment: The door and window of the room are not soundproof. You can hear the voices in the corridor and the room next door.

The location is very good, Raffles City and the subway station are just downstairs, the room overlooks the tall buildings and Shuangjiang.

shortcoming:
2,000 yuan a night is not cost-effective. The glass on the exterior wall of the hotel is not very clean, and there are many frames on the exterior wall, which seriously affects the scenery outside the window.
The hotel itself feels more business-oriented, and there is nothing fun about it. The breakfast is also so-so, more than 200 people are indeed inflated.

Overall, rich people please do as you please.

It is recommended that friends who want to book a hotel book a room near Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street. Any hotel at this price will be better than this hotel. The price is just not worth it.

msg:Chongqing is full of Internet celebrity attractions and check-in points, and Raffles InterContinental is no exception. The 42-story lobby (the connecting floor of the 4 buildings) has pleasant scenery and unique furnishings.
The front desk recommends a room on the 57th floor. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, you can have a panoramic view of the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. The river view is absolutely invincible. There are many high-rise buildings on the other side of the river, and the Chongqing Grand Theater also has a panoramic view.
The hotel is located next to Chaotianmen Wharf (wharf renovation), the floor is high, the windows are soundproof, and it is very quiet at night! Automatic gauze curtains and 100% light-blocking curtains, after 30,000 steps a day, sleep and rest are guaranteed!

The executive lounge is a surprise, with snacks in the afternoon, semi-buffet in the evening (full coverage of Chongqing snacks), and drinks (glass bottles) throughout the day. Professional staff! Remember us the second time, no need to report the room number.

The breakfast at the carnival scene was amazing! Eggs Benedict is also available!

Finally, I would like to praise the hotel service team and thank Ms. Cara for her enthusiastic and professional support and service, which brought a high-quality experience to my child and me! see you later!

The photos are unprofessional, post a few lounge dinners and breakfast bakery stalls.

The overall hotel facilities are relatively new, and the front desk service is very good, especially Ms. Cara, who is beautiful Kind and enthusiastic! Because a family of three is traveling (the child is 16 years old), we booked the Intercontinental Suite, room 6102, the room faces the confluence of the two rivers, the river view and the city view are excellent, the only thing missing is that there are too many guests during the May Day holiday, and there is no extra bed ~ In the end, I can only choose to sleep on the sofa. The hotel should reflect on this. The food in the executive lounge is very rich, and the waiters are very warm and polite. If you choose the Intercontinental Suite, you can enjoy it for free. Let‚Äôs talk about the room, which covers an area of more than 90 square meters. There are 2 toilets, 3 sinks, a super large double bed, and a cloakroom , dressing table and other facilities are complete. The L5 floor of the hotel is a large comprehensive shopping mall, where you can eat, drink and buy, which is very convenient! In summary, this hotel is highly recommended! (If the children in the family are young, don‚Äôt come to Chongqing to play, I really can‚Äôt walk!)

msg:Comprehensive evaluation: Great check-in experience, superior and convenient location, high-altitude room overlooking the scenery of the two rivers, hotel staff enthusiastically and proactively provide services, breakfast is rich, meeting the needs of most people.

Location: At the junction of the two rivers, the Raffles City shopping mall and the subway are downstairs, and you can walk along the river to Hongyadong.

Hardware facilities: The hotel is very new, with a log-style decoration style and a slightly lower-grade texture, but it still has a family a**osphere! The lobby is very a**ospheric. The swimming pool and gym are very good, and the staff inside are also enthusiastic and proactive, especially a male staff member in white polo (a bit like a fitness trainer) is very enthusiastic. The one-bedroom room type I originally booked was to have a good sense of space. The hotel will directly upgrade it to an "executive suite" and provide administrative benefits. As an IHG member and Ctrip Black Diamond member, I feel great! The room is large and has a wide view!

Service quality: Most of the employees have a strong sense of service, are proactive and enthusiastic, have a gentle tone and a faint smile. Even if it is just a concierge waiter on the first floor, he will know how to make the tenants wait politely, and the way is to give a detailed explanation outside the gate. Room service was prompt, Tiffany's hospitality and allowed me to check out until 2:30. The only thing I feel is a little shortcoming is that the staff who manage the housekeeping (not the cleaning staff, but wearing short skirt suits) see the tenants with blank faces and no greetings, just like passers-by.

In Chongqing, living here must be worth it!

msg:This hotel is black all its life!! Plus *** hotel service and customer service! I didn't want to give a bad review, but the number of calls has already harassed me! Don't choose it for the location. First of all, the hotel room and cleanliness are not worth the price. The cleanliness is about the same as that of a fast hotel, and the room is very small. The room is small, which is okay, but the experience from check-in to home is very bad. First, before check-in, the hotel customer service is very indifferent and unreasonable. Second, after check-in and check-out, there are frequent service calls, which already feel like telephone harassment. The purpose of telephone service and sending small gifts is to prevent me from giving a bad review. Third, the sheets are not clean, and it is really itchy when sleeping. There is room service and knocking on the door during sleep. Fourth, the check-in waiting time is very long, about ten minutes. I don't know what they are doing. Choosing a room is not an excuse. There is a front desk who makes a bad face for no reason. Finally, I picked up my luggage after storing it at LG (basement floor). However, there was no hotel staff to look after the luggage in such a busy public lobby. Dozens of stored luggage were left there with no one to look after them. Finally, after searching for a long time, I found a hotel gatekeeper who helped me take it. I asked where the gatekeeper had gone, but he didn't give me a clear answer. Our safety depends entirely on the moral awareness of passers-by.

       The location of the hotel is excellent. In my opinion, the location should be regarded as a very prosperous area. It is very convenient to live here. The Raffles City mall is downstairs, where you can shop, go shopping or eat!
       The service of the hotel is what I am most satisfied with this time. Here I would like to thank the butlers, Eva, Molly and Mia, who connected us, from adding me on WeChat the day before check-in to communicate with us to the reception and guidance when we came to the front desk. It is said that it is meticulous, the details are the best, and the enthusiasm throughout the whole process is so embarrassing that I am a little embarrassed, thank you again!
        During my stay, I took a camera to take pictures in various locations of the hotel. It can be said that every place in the hotel is a scenic spot, and the hotel environment at night is even more beautiful.
        The breakfast is very rich, and all kinds of food are very delicious. When we went, it was almost closing time, but the food was also very complete, and the environment of the restaurant was also very good.
        I visited the hotel's swimming pool and gym, but I didn't experience it this time, and it looks very good.
        I also said that I am not very satisfied. It may be that the bottled water in the room is of average quality. In addition, due to some mistakes this time, I did not experience the free parking during the stay, but the problem is not big, and it does not affect the overall experience of this stay!
        When we were leaving, the butler chased after us and brought us a souvenir. It was really a surprise. I will visit and stay next time I come to Chongqing. Thank you for your reception and attentive service throughout the whole process. This stay will leave a lasting impression on me. Made great memories!

Hongya Cave, Twin Towers, WFC, Yangtze River Bridge... the best hotel should be There is the best service, and the best service has to be in the executive lounge. The food is really great: whether it is small noodles or dim sum, whether it is salmon or drinks, we are satisfied. What is more satisfying is the service. The warm hospitality of Rain and Lia are very meticulous and diligent in their work. Listen When we were watching the sunset, Cara, who immediately took out the sunset postcard, made me feel at home. The mountain city is noisy and crowded on weekends. I still like to enjoy the homely service in the executive lounge and feel the enthusiasm of the people in the mountain city. . From the reception at the front desk to the little brother who helped to take a taxi, they are all worthy of thanks, they are all excellent. In Raffles City InterContinental, there are delicious food, beautiful scenery, Raffles City Plaza, pleasant tea, and good memories.

msg:The night view of Chongqing is popular all over the world. When I came to Chongqing by car, I chose the Raffles Intercontinental Hotel. The lady at the front desk helped me choose a room with a super invincible river view. You can see the 8D magic mountain city surrounded by two rivers at 270 degrees. After counting, you can see Chongqing 8 of the 33 bridges, Hongya Cave, Cloud Eye Building, and Chaotianmen Center can be reached by handshake. The room is very large, whether it is a sofa seat, a large bed, a desk seat or a bathtub seat, the river view is surrounded by left and right, 57th floor The room is truly above the clouds, and I am envious of my friends who have not been to Chongqing. The design of the old Intercontinental Hotel, the rich variety of breakfast, and the romance of afternoon tea are as usual, and the enthusiasm of Chongqing is reflected in the warm greetings of each hotel staff, all of them are full of energy, kind, gentle and gentle Ms. Cara I was even more impressed by her considerate care throughout the whole process. During the afternoon tea, she brought Chongqing special souvenirs, postcards, etc. She has a wealth of knowledge and introduced Chongqing‚Äôs special tourism in detail. She has a wide range of interests. When we talked about photography She is actually a professional hotel practitioner, because the process of delivering the luggage to the room was a bit tortuous and weird. She and her colleagues made up for it in time, which added luster to the golden signboard of InterContinental. Until late at night when she was about to leave work, she still didn't forget to ask if she would like to check out late the next day? Do you want to issue tickets and a series of other matters, the dedicated and meticulous service will make you feel as warm as a loved one, beautiful girl bless you! Parking is 45 yuan for 26 hours. I forgot to ask if the hotel will reimburse me? Ha ha!

There are large floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides, and you can have a panoramic view of Chongqing! Because I brought children, the hotel paid special attention to the little guests, and sent welcome fruits to the room, and prepared afternoon desserts for the children. The butler service in the room is also very considerate. Before check-in, I called to ask about the arrival time, accompanying guests, and any special accommodation requirements. It's a 10-minute walk from Hongya Cave, and it's very convenient to check in and take pictures. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, the children are very happy to eat, and the self-service seasoning of noodles tastes great! Also, the water quality of the hotel's swimming pool is very good, there is no smell of chlorine, and there is a hot spring pool that I can't swim. I saw the staff go to test the water quality in the afternoon. Special thanks to the service staff this time: mia meek molly and eva! Let the trip to Chongqing come to a perfect conclusion!

2. The design of the hotel is excellent. It is said that it is a team with Singapore Sands, so it looks a bit similar from a distance. Next is Raffles City, which is convenient for eating and shopping.
3. The afternoon tea in the hotel bar is good, and the bar can be suspended in the air to experience the 42-story high-altitude experience.

I feel that the breakfast needs to be strengthened, but the flaws are not hidden, and I will still choose this place next time I come to Chongqing.

We were shocked when we entered, saying that the view at the corner was good, but the workers who were repairing the curtain wall on the left could clearly see every move. Including the room with the undrawn curtains, the restaurant on the first floor of the lobby is directly in front of you, and you can see the food and drink at a glance, so can I be seen clearly in the room? The so-called river view room , is the "hidden corner" of the entire window, and the two rivers can also be seen, awesome! The hotel also called to ask how the room was, and when I said that the privacy was extremely poor, they said that they would send snacks to comfort us. Snacks-twist, strange-flavored beans, did they reject everything in a very gentle tone? , Of course, the hotel is also very meticulous and has welcome fruits, and even the bottom mat of the shower room has been laid, but there is no shampoo! Halfway through washing my hair, forget it, I can‚Äôt make phone calls, and I don‚Äôt want to wash it a second time. There are too many people dining in the morning, and some things are gone when they arrive late. There are sought-after seats by the window. I told the service lady that I want to be next to it. Can you change the seat for us? She asked us to "grab it" by ourselves. Actually It can be assigned to the district management here. If there is a need, arrange it in order. You have to use a bunch of words to evade it, but what do you need a waiter for such a job? After the experience, all communication with the staff was rejected, probably because there were too many people, and there was no time to take care of some "little voices". Just like when I said that there is no privacy in the shelter, the hotel said "the hotel is above the skyline at an altitude of 251 meters, and you can enjoy different unique views in the hotel,, blah, blah." No matter how high it is, what's the point? There is a crosspiece on the top of Raffles, which completely covers the view of the room, so let‚Äôs make it a windowless room

How should I put it, there should be about ten Ritz-Carltons between InterContinental and Four Seasons. Such good hardware really fails in terms of service. I hope that the service staff, especially those in gyms and swimming pools, can be well trained. They should not use various systems as a dagger. Instead of competing with guests, it is better to go to the footbath first. A large area of ‚Äã‚Äãmy hair has been cleaned up. Let‚Äôs learn from others. The gap is too big.

msg:The location is excellent, it is located at Chaotianmen, the intersection of the Yangtze River and Jialing River. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides, and the river and city views are very good from the room. The room facilities are relatively new, with a strong sense of technology and good details. The welcome fruit and drink vouchers are given as a gift. In the River View Executive King Room, you can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails in the executive lounge. It is very comfortable to eat without going out for a day. The open-air glass roof of "Show Bar" has a great view! On the 42nd floor, looking down at the busy traffic, the timid may not dare to stand on the glass.
The downside is that there are not many entertainment activities for children. Only the swimming pool can take children there. I didn't find any other children's activity areas. In addition, the shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner in the room are all large bottles of push type, which I don't like a little bit.
Generally speaking, it is a good hotel, you can choose it for business trip or tourism.

From the airport, take the subway station and transfer once to go directly to the underground of the hotel.
The landscape is invincible, with a panoramic view of the two rivers and the four banks.
Downstairs is Raffles City.
The service is very good, and the request to add a quilt received a quick response.
There are a total of eight bottles of mineral water in the room, which is enough for two people to drink without going out of the room.
The bathroom is separated from wet and dry. A toilet and a hand basin in a small room. One large room is rain shower plus washbasin plus bathtub. There are doors on both sides, so you can avoid embarrassment when taking older children out.
Breakfast was great! The restaurant is beautiful and there is no choice but plentiful.
The dinner in the hotel is delicious.
A very pleasant living experience. recommend!

I don't know if I am an IHG member. Automatically presented fruit and turned down the bed; when I left the store, just walked out of the door, Tony Wu, the concierge supervisor, saw that I was alone, and immediately offered to help with my luggage and accompany me to wait for the car until the luggage was packed and sent me to the car. I carefully sensed whether the customer needed help, but I didn't even ask. All the other staff I encountered were very professional, helpful and warm, and made me feel at home.
The facilities are very new, the view is also good (city view + river view), and the two intercontinentals during this journey have used the most suitable equipment for my hair quality - Byredo Blanche.
The hotel is equipped with Dyson hair dryers and Tivoli speakers.
Not sure if the room was upgraded when checking in... because it seems that some city view rooms can also see the river view. The location is convenient, the hotel is directly connected to Raffles City, and Linjiangmen Station of Line 1 is just across Raffles City, not far from Baixiangju of Jiefangbei Eighteen Stairs.
The quality and variety of breakfast are also very good, the noodles are delicious, and the restaurant staff are also very professional, enthusiastic and helpful
All in all, I will recommend it to my friends who go to Chongqing

msg:I stayed at Raffles Intercontinental for the first time in Chongqing for many times. The experience was very, very bad. I originally booked a deluxe city view king room. After arriving at the front desk, I communicated with the front desk staff and told them that the city view room was not good. For an additional fee of 750 yuan, I could book an executive river view room. The floor space was also larger than the original house, so I agreed to increase the price and was given a room of 5006. When I walked in, I saw that it was a special-shaped room at the corner. What I saw was the building opposite, and I could see a bit of the river on both sides. From the high-rise buildings in Chongqing's Yuzhong Peninsula, you can see a bit of the two rivers. The key is that the room shape is too bad. Is this a deluxe executive river view room after a price increase? Can't comment on the taste and aesthetics of the company, or is it in? So I went back to the front desk again, changed staff, raised objections, asked to change rooms, and asked not to increase the price, so the staff gave me a room 6011. When I went in, I saw that it was still a special-shaped room. It was very weird. On both sides of the bed were The wall is very narrow, no different from the 200 yuan fast hotel on the market. It is probably to prove the real existence of 5006! I booked a room on Ctrip.com and saw the pictures of the deluxe city view rooms on the Internet. They were completely different, so I called and changed rooms again. After my repeated strong request, I finally changed to room 4802, which was the same as the pictures on the Internet. Alas, the three room changes, especially the second room change, were carried out in this way despite knowing the dissatisfaction and needs of the customers. This fully reflects the lack of professional ethics, poor professionalism and professionalism of the front desk staff of Raffles Intercontinental Hotel. Low down, as a front desk, it is a basic requirement to be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of various room types in this hotel. If you can't do this, you still have to work? Knowing that the customers are dissatisfied, you still operate like this. I really admire you. I admire you? As an IHG member who has stayed at InterContinental hotels across the country, I just can‚Äôt help but ask, what are you doing at Raffles InterContinental Hotel?

I made a reservation in the morning and announced in the afternoon that the hotel would set off New Year‚Äôs Eve fireworks facing the river on New Year‚Äôs Eve. It was full of sincerity. The hotel uses many specific performances to tell me that its service is really good. The hotel is located in the tower near Raffles Changjiang River. The car is parked in the ba*****t, go up to the first floor and then take the elevator to the lobby on the 42nd floor. The five-storey podium of Raffles City is a large-scale shopping, entertainment and catering complex. My place is for two meals on the left, and Avatar on the left. The hotel is not far from the Jiefangbei on foot. On the afternoon of the New Year's Eve, go to the Guoduji Fruit Flagship Store to give the left two 14s to my wife and son as New Year's gifts. The swimming pool on the 43rd floor of the hotel is just right, the water temperature is high enough and the water quality is top-notch, so it is good to bring buried swimming trunks to cover it. For the reunion dinner, the three of us chose the buffet dinner at the hotel, with no restrictions on products and services, free drinks, three hours left, and stayed in the room to watch the Spring Festival Gala. In the middle of the night, I went to the bar terrace to watch the fireworks, and each guest had a drink to celebrate the New Year happily.

msg:The environment is excellent. I found it on Instagram. After the lockdown was lifted, I came to Chongqing as my first stop. I stayed at InterContinental Raffles. Front desk service. The staff at Gate 11 provided good service and was responsive. There are some shortcomings: 1. The room is quite ordinary. The room type costs 2,000 per night. I feel that the price/performance ratio is low, but the environment is good and it is OK. 2. The housekeeper is average. I got off the subway at 11 o'clock in the evening with my child. I couldn't find the way. I wanted to ask the housekeeper, but found that the housekeeper had been off work at 7 o'clock. I asked the housekeeper when I had a problem. He said hello and then disappeared. But the problem was reported. Before reporting, could I reply to the guest and say "wait a moment" or something like that? I don't know if the housekeeper saw it. Later, I gave it a good review. 3. Bathtub hygiene: I stayed for three days. I played very late every day in the first two days and didn't have time to soak. On the third day, I wanted to soak. I cleaned the bathtub and found that it was full of dried ash residue. For a hotel that costs 2,000 per night, this is really not right. I contacted the front desk and actively solved it. However, for hygiene reasons, I didn't let the child soak in it. It's a pity. Overall the experience is good. I will choose another hotel next time I come to Chongqing.

Let‚Äôs talk about the location first, Chaotianmen, the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River, but taxi drivers are not willing to pick it up at this location, and the flow of people is very small.
The view outside the window is just that. This should be the most expensive hotel in downtown Chongqing. It doesn't feel worth the price.
The facilities are so-so. It can be said that most of the hotels renovated or opened after 2020 are better than this one. I went to the toilet at 2:30 in the middle of the night, the toilet was broken and the water kept flowing, so I rushed to report for repairs... The room is not very soundproof, there is always the sound of a motor outside the window at night, or the sound of a boat. During the day, the next door can clearly hear the phone call.
Let‚Äôs talk about service again. I was deceived by a certain book again. I am looking forward to his quietness on the C1 floor, called Hang. I went on the first day and said it was closed. How can there be a bar that closes at 22 o'clock. Don't give up, I went again at 21 o'clock the next day, the decoration is good, the waiter said it is a coffee shop, not a bar, but there are many kinds of wine, I want to go to the place where the wine is stored to see what wine is there, and I am not allowed to enter. That attitude is indeed very polite, but I can also feel his meaning: You must not come to spend, we are going to get off work...
To sum up, with Chongqing's consumption level, 2200 a night should be able to live much better than this.

The Raffles City shopping mall is downstairs, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. The cloud walk on the top floor of the shopping mall is particularly exciting and interesting. You can overlook the whole Chongqing from the top of the high-rise building. Recommended! The service is very warm, especially Manager Peng at the front desk. like!

But the front of the window is blocked by a building, the shower space is too narrow, and it is also blocked by the bathtub, the bathroom is extremely narrow, and the wash basin inside is pitifully small. I originally went for the reputation of InterContinental, but I was very disappointed.

Also, the interior of the room is ok, but I feel sorry for the name Intercontinental. 1. There is a small table in the entrance hall, it looks like it is for you to put your bag, but in fact, opening the door is very blocking the way; 2. The fully enclosed room is really stuffy, and the air conditioner does not have any ventilation, only cooling and heating.
The only thing that didn't disappoint was the breakfast, which was very good.

Facts have proved that this is a correct choice, because it faces the core urban landscape of the mountain city: the entire city view of Jiefangbei + Qiansimen Bridge + Hongya Cave... . The hotel facilities are very new, the washroom and toilet are separated, the layout is reasonable, the toiletries are domestic niche brands, and the fragrance is comparable to a big brand. Opposite the lobby on the LG floor is the service hall of the city airport. It‚Äôs a little expensive for a commercial vehicle to drop off at 35 per person, but it‚Äôs 15 per person for a free ride.

suggestion:
The glass on the exterior wall of the hotel is dirty, and it is not very good to take pictures in the room, so it needs to be cleaned up in time; provide a voucher for the luggage storage, and confirm whether it has been delivered to the room in time
Explain late check-out option at check-in

It is only a budget hotel, and the service may not be as good as that of a budget hotel. The price is inflated, the service hall is on the 42nd floor, and then take another elevator from the 42nd floor to the guest room. There is no service throughout the whole process, there is dust visible to the naked eye in the guest room, and the takeaway can be picked up on the first floor (you have to transfer to 2 elevators), and no one has informed you yet. All services are subject to a fee. Only mineral water is free, which is still a general brand. Compared with the Regent Hotel, it is much worse, and the service concept is not at all. Don't feel sorry for such a high room rate.

Before leaving, a bottle of byredo body lotion of 450ml was also given away! The executive breakfast has a special menu that can be ordered a la carte, as well as cheese and ham. The overall grade is relatively high.
The view of the river from the 64th floor is excellent, and there will be no crowds during the Chinese New Year. You can have a panoramic view of the beautiful river view in Chongqing. Jing Chinese Restaurant's scenery, taste, and service are all online, and I recommend it.
I saw the bad reviews on Ctrip, so I booked the Internet celebrity hotel on the first day, because I was looking forward to the Intercontinental River View, so I booked the Intercontinental Hotel on the second day. I think overall I am satisfied, but I have two comments that I hope the hotel can make improvements:
1. The evening cocktails shown in Figure 3 are included. When checking in, it is clearly informed that they can still enjoy them even after checking out the next day. The next day, I asked the waiter in yellow clothes and said that he didn't know, and he couldn't find relevant personnel to help me confirm it.
2. I had dinner at the hotel at noon the next day. I originally wanted to go to Chonglin Restaurant. I asked at the door if I could use group buying with reviews. After being told that it was not available, I added that it was full. The EQ of this kind of service needs to be improved.
Overall, it is five-star, and I recommend the room types above the executive room. I also hope that the hotel will improve with these two small suggestions, so as to bring a better experience to more people and friends in the future.

There is also a late bed service in the afternoon And welcome fruit, there are also a lot of wine and drinks in the mini bar, but there is a fee~ Check out late until 2 o'clock, go to the restaurant to redeem a free drink, have coffee or juice in the afternoon, and leave for the airport after drinking~Next I have to live here again, the scenery is good, the service is good! It's not expensive, isn't it~~~

msg:Summarize first: a rather disappointing experience. At noon on December 31, we arrived at the long-awaited InterContinental Chongqing Raffles Hotel. When we entered the reception hall on the first floor and opened the electric gate, a sense of age struck me. The style of the reception hall is too low. Maybe because I don‚Äôt have a suitcase, the concierge depar**ent is not enthusiastic enough. I just verbally told me to go to the C1 floor to check in; I came to the C1 floor to continue my disappoin**ent. The decoration of the lobby is really different from what I imagined The high level is far behind, and the chairs in the rest area are dirty to the naked eye! The service attitude at the front desk is very nice, but the cheap and unfit work clothes are surprising! The cleanliness of the room is good to the naked eye, but the folds of the bed sheets have lowered the level of the hotel, and there is a faint smell of urine in the toilet. The quality of roll paper and tissue paper in the room is not generally bad, and we look forward to improvement! I visited the swimming pool and gym that night. I didn't understand why the swimming pool staff dressed like the engineering depar**ent? The opening hours of the swimming pool are very user-friendly but do not match the promotional photos. On the second day, I went to have breakfast wearing hotel slippers and was politely persuaded by the front desk to change into my own shoes. The breakfast dishes can only be said to be quite satisfactory. It is easy to eat enough, but impossible to eat well! Let me talk about the specific feeling. The decoration style and hardware of the hotel are not worthy of the InterContinental brand, and the cheap clothes of the staff are not worthy of the InterContinental brand. The only thing I am satisfied with is the attitude of the staff. It is very good üëç, but it gives me a sense of arrogance. Of course I know InterContinental The hotel is a business-oriented hotel, but I always feel that today's hotels should feel like home to the guests, get rid of your arrogance and be more sincere. I have also worked in hotels with "never say no to guest" instead of asking you to be very polite To refuse guests, as a guest I live in a hotel for comfort, and I don't need you to teach me how to be a gentleman! Maybe it's because I don't deserve to live in an expensive hotel, maybe I'm not advanced enough!

msg:The room facilities do not have to say a word "good"! As recommended by Ctrip, internet celebrities check in, but the service needs to be evaluated separately. The breakfast and room service are very good. The breakfast is a five-star breakfast among the many intercontinentals I have stayed in. The bread in the bakery area is very good! In order to stimulate consumption, the front desk gave a tasting voucher for the bar, but it is estimated that the training was not good, good intentions turned into bad reviews, and the reception was treated differently. Seeing us holding the voucher, they immediately reminded us that there is a minimum consumption. I have already consumed afternoon tea in the afternoon, and I want to go in the evening Try it at the bar, but treat it differently. Watching people order dishes is not the service style of a five-star hotel. I found a place to sit down and waited for 15 minutes, but no experience drinks were delivered. I was not in the mood to order a cocktail. Back to the room, this feeling is very bad! As a five-star hotel, I am most afraid of differential trea**ent and the minimum consumption limit, which makes people feel a little disappointed in the five-star quality. I hope to improve personnel training

msg:A very good hotel, it can be said to be a very good one in InterContinental, and it can also be said to be a very good one in Chongqing. While many hotel brands are now asking to remember guests more, there are really not many people in this hotel where everyone is serious about doing it, from the front desk to the concierge to room cleaning. Special thanks to chloe and kaia for their caring service throughout the whole process, they always think one step more for the guests, they are very professional and sincere~
The room is also upgraded. The Yangtze River is outside the window, and the scene is very beautiful every day.

Came here once when it opened, now for the second time
1. Four bath towels (very user-friendly, taking a shower once a day in a hot city is unreal these days)
2. A brand-new small bath flower (very cute, very practical, and a very user-friendly configuration)
3. I have stayed in so many hotels with 1500RMB+ (there are few dental floss in the toothbrush)
4. Dyson hair dryer (MO, JW are also equipped like this) but the neck pillow in the bathtub is the second time I have seen it (the first time in a hotel in Pudong, Shanghai)
5. Baisuishan small bottle (although it is not a Evian glass bottle, but it is very sincere, much better than Binglu Nongfu Spring) screencasting is already a trend. Not much to say
6. Peace of mind package (warm-hearted configuration, regardless of whether it is used or not)
7. Bluetooth speaker and desk lamp also have wireless charging (technical and humanized, and also a future trend)
8. The minibar is rich and comprehensive (no matter how severe the epidemic is, the a**osphere and quality that should be made cannot be lost, and the intercontinental occupancy rate is only 30%)
9. Capsule coffee machine + teapot + 4 kinds of cups to fully cover various needs
This time the booking is only for the basic room type. It can only be said that Fushi InterContinental has been at the front end of the market and has achieved a certain level of [detailed experience]. Of course, the cost cannot be ignored, but in today's society, "warm heart" is to win trust and One of the best ways to get recognized
They are all 5 out of 5 points, and the service is given 2 points. There are 3 places that are not OK and need to be improved

I ordered breakfast without breakfast. She gave us 2 breakfasts and a drink ticket in the crystal corridor. Very patient with my questions. We arrived in the morning and we could not check in until 2 pm. We left our luggage from the underground garage on the LG floor and went straight to the shopping mall. We checked in on the 42nd floor. Miss Yin Qing planned to arrange a higher floor for us to have a better view. The doll was too busy to check in and did not choose a room, and the luggage was directly delivered to the room for us. The room is not particularly big, with smart curtains and toilets inside. The TV can cast the screen to the doll, and I am very satisfied. In the afternoon, I gave 2 fruits and 4 free nucleic acids. Food, lodging, and shopping are all in the shopping mall. I didn't go out to feel the high temperature. The feeling of staying is good.

Favorite: The hotel bedding is very comfortable and is one of the best experiences so far; the room layout is reasonably designed, the decoration style is simple and modern, and it is worth staying in
Contrast: Intercontinental I have stayed in other places, the room size is not large, the mini bar has no free snacks, the details of the room are flawless, but the price will be slightly more expensive than other places
Highlights: I have tried several characteristic bars and restaurants in the hotel. The "Play" bar will definitely push your travel experience to the top. The "Hang" bar is elegantly designed, and blockbusters can be produced anywhere. The "Jing" restaurant has a good taste and appropriate portion. , you can also consider dining if necessary

Summary: While fully satisfying the accommodation needs, the hotel is highly playable. Even if you travel for a day, you can enjoy the comfort of a vacation.

msg:When I came to Chongqing for the first time, I was very anxious to choose a hotel for several days. Originally, my friend recommended Regent, but the size of the bed in the twin room was not suitable for us with two children. So in the end, I chose Intercontinental, which proved to be the right choice.
The room is very new, the configuration is very comfortable, the bathroom is very large, the BYREDO shampoo set is very soft after washing, and the hair dryer is also the Dyson we are used to. I really like the exquisite coffee machine and kettle on the minibar side, and the small corner is beautiful. The internal layout of the swimming pool is also very clean and user-friendly.
I didn't choose the hotel's buffet breakfast because I like to sleep late, but downstairs is Raffles City, so there is no need to worry about eating.
Besides, the service is very good. In particular, the staff at the LG lobby on No. 5 and the taxi point, the lady at the front desk of the swimming pool on No. 6, the aunt who helped us clean the room, and the manager Wang on duty in the lobby when we left on No. 7, each staff made me feel very kind.
In short, next time I come to Chongqing, I will consider staying at Intercontinental first.

Will a piece of fruit be expensive? InterContinental‚Äôs layout reflects this incident is really bad, unlike the corporate brand Regent, so the experience is not good.
What's even more exasperating is that after another family in our company called in advance and got angry, the fruit was delivered immediately. We, as another family traveling together and on one order, had a total of nearly 20,000 for two rooms in three days For consumption, they told us that this family cannot give fruit for various reasons. In the end, the front desk directly said, "Apart from the fruit problem, do you have anything else to solve? If not, then I wish you a pleasant trip", and there are such bad things answer? I have also experienced various hotels of the same level, no matter how bad they are, they will not be so aggressive. I don't expect to get any kind of reply and compensation from Ctrip's comments, it just reflects the real situation, and I hope that InterContinental will not smash its own brand.
There is nothing wrong with the hotel itself. The rooms and decorations meet the standards of this price. What is wrong is the service attitude and the same river view, so the service level cannot be compensated by the high altitude. In the future, family trips enjoy high consumption. Choose Intercontinental or It's so aggrieved, aren't Ritz-Carlton and Regent not fragrant?

msg:The reason for choosing this is mainly because it feels new. In addition, I was deceived by a group of clubhouse swimming pool photos, which is not affiliated with the hotel.
It was said on the Internet that the service was not good, but in fact, since I checked in yesterday, I found that the hotel had a bad view (the reason for the government's night view project, the glass was blocked), there was a beautiful lady, Xiao Guo, who was very nice and took me to change rooms. Stayed for 3 nights, the service is very good, and I take the initiative to care about customer needs! As long as you hang around at the front desk, there will be a lady who will come and ask you what help you need.
The most amazing thing about the hotel is the breakfast, and whether it's authentic or not, I eat very comfortably~ First of all, the space is large enough to comfortably accommodate everyone! Again, the details are in place, the fruits are peeled and cut into pieces, even the oranges are peeled, which is very good. Western pastries are also placed hot and cold, with a wide variety! Just a few details, I like it very much, I like the breakfast at the executive lounge, it is more refined and quiet than the forest restaurant, but the categories are slightly less, but the food is delicious!
The hotel itself is a complex, with shopping malls and hotels, which is very convenient. Directly opposite is the Grand Theater, and ahead is Qiansmen Bridge and Hongya Cave, which is a very good location. Take Metro Line 1, enter the mall directly from the side door, and connect all the way up, which is a big advantage in this big summer! You can get on the subway without basking in the sun!
Staying in this hotel, we also drank tea for 3 consecutive days, it's not too wonderful! Because it's right next to it, I'll go to line up when no one is there, haha

We also brought a cake I want to see what people know what it means! Generally speaking, we gave 1,500 yuan to this hotel. We didn't stay in this hotel, so we didn't refund it. We didn't refund the deposit at the time, we had to wait! Hehe, it really made me know this kind of hotel better again! Any 3-star hotel service will not be as rubbish as yours!

Service: I received a phone call from the lady one day in advance to ask about my preferences. I prefer high floors. I was upgraded to a room on the 64th floor. The service at the front desk is very good and people are very kind. The check-in experience is great. Afternoon tea is also exquisite.

To go to Raffles City, you have to go down to the first floor and enter from the opposite door. The light rail Chaotianmen stands on the third floor of the mall and has an entrance and exit. It is very convenient to go to the scenic station and the airport, which basically meets the travel requirements.

The river view and city view rooms face two different directions, the south bank of the Yangtze River/Riverside and Yuzhong Peninsula/Jialing River, respectively. The scenery is unique and has its own characteristics (as shown in the picture). The hotel rooms, swimming pools, gymnasiums and restaurants are all of a very high standard. The hotel is located in the same building as Raffles City, and many important attractions such as Jiefangbei, Hongya Cave, Luohan Temple are within walking distance, and it may be the best destination to appreciate the culture of Chongqing. What is particularly important is that the hotel's service standard has reached an extraordinary level, and it has achieved the world's top level in terms of living, dining, and facilities. It is worth mentioning that the hotel's Miss Vivian, very thoughtful arrangement of fruits, restaurant reservations, late check-out and other considerate services. In the end, the small parting gift she arranged moved me as a Chongqing native who has been away from home for a long time.

There is nothing to say about the hotel facilities. For the first time, I lived in a high-rise with more than 60 floors near the top floor, and I could have a panoramic view of Chongqing&#39;s moving river view. It is impossible to take such a shocking beauty by the river! The breakfast and bar are also very good.

The staff at the front desk in the lobby are very warm and thoughtful. The day before check-in, they will take the initiative to call the guests to inquire about the check-in time and housing requirements. When checking in, there will be public relations follow-up to actively establish contact with the guests to provide assistance.

The hotel is located in the most central location in the most Yuzhong district of Chongqing, Raffles City. It is very close to famous scenic spots such as Chongqing Jiefangbei, Hongya Cave, Baixiangju, Yangtze River Cableway and can be reached on foot. Raffles City has direct access to Chaotianmen Station of Metro Line 1, which is very convenient.

üîîService
There is no need to say much about the service of InterContinental Hotel, Chongqing InterContinental Hotel is the leader in the InterContinental series. The warm and hospitable attitude of Miss Vivian at the front desk made people feel like returning home after a long journey, very warm. After eating Chongqing hot pot, I went back to my room and asked the food and beverage depar**ent for a jug of milk, which was served immediately.

üçÉ Environment
The overall building of Raffles is like a ship sailing away. As soon as you enter the hotel lobby, you will feel a similar feeling. From the lobby, you can see the junction of the yellow Yangtze River and the green Jialing River, which is very spectacular. Playing at night, blowing the river wind, overlooking the night view of Chongqing, is a unique enjoyment.

The location is excellent, you can go shopping and eat downstairs. The foyer, lobby and public areas are well decorated, but the interior decoration of the room feels like it was designed a few years ago, not quite like the decoration style of the hotel that just opened in the past two years. It may be because Raffles has started construction for too long üòÖ But the materials It's still working great! The river view on the 62nd floor is great, the weather will be perfect if the weather is better~

Areas that can be improved:
1. There is no basket for throwing bath towels in the room. If you want to use the bathtub, you don't know where to throw the used towels. A storage basket can be added.

2. After going from the underground garage to the first floor, there is no sign that guides you to the lobby. After I came out of the building, I looked for it, and when I encountered a staff guide, I had to walk through a roundabout to go to the lobby on the first floor, and then go to the front desk on the 42nd floor, which was inconvenient. It is recommended to lead to the same elevator from the garage and go directly to the lobby on the 42nd floor for check-in.

3. When checking out, the front desk can take the initiative to ask if the customer has parked, and if so, enter the system in time. When I checked out, I forgot to ask about parking. When I got out of the garage, I couldn't get out and blocked the exit. The next few cars had to wait for us to call the front desk before going out.

msg:InterContinental Chongqing Raffles City is located at Chaotianmen, the intersection of the two rivers. It is adjacent to the Raffles City shopping mall. It has beautiful scenery and convenient transportation. It is very convenient to eat and shop.
InterContinental is a newly opened hotel with modern decoration. The lobby is on the 42nd floor, and all the houses are above the 42nd floor. It has a wide field of vision and a panoramic view of the city and the two rivers.
The breakfast is rich, and there are three kinds of freshly squeezed juices: orange juice, watermelon juice and cucumber juice every day. If you pay attention to the details, whether there is high-quality freshly squeezed juice is the difference between an ordinary five-star hotel and a super five-star (Golden Diamond on Ctrip). One, another detail is the cloth napkin.
The room facilities are new and complete, the beds and pillows are very comfortable, the brightness of the lights is also what I like, the switch control is easy to operate, and the location of the socket is also very user-friendly. The cleaning is very conscientious, paying attention to details including helping my own items to be neatly arranged.
When I come to Chongqing to eat, of course, most of my choices are the special restaurants outside the hotel. I have only tried the Chinese food Jing Restaurant once in the hotel. The taste of Cantonese and Sichuan dishes is also amazing! In addition, the afternoon tea in the lobby bar with the view of the Yangtze River as the background is very photogenic.
As a swimming enthusiast, I have high requirements for hotel swimming pools, and the InterContinental 43rd floor Sky Pool has also met my requirements in all aspects. 25x8 hotel standard size, the water depth is 1.2 meters, the water quality is clean, the hot pool is fully equipped for dry and wet steaming, and the locker room is clean and odor-free. It is only open to in-house guests, and there are no paid members outside, so that the swimming pool can ensure high-standard and high-level operation! There are two shortages: first, there is no swimming trunk dryer; second, during the epidemic, it is open from 12:00 noon to 8:00 p.m., making me go out in the morning and have to come back in the afternoon to swim 1,000 meters before going out, which has caused a lot of damage to my travel arrangements. inconvenient.
The hardware is superb and the service is five-star. Every staff member greets each other warmly and meets any needs as soon as possible. In particular, Hani, the hotel's guest relations director, added WeChat before checking into the hotel, and followed him from check-in to departure. Always care about the needs and experience of guests' stay, so that guests can feel at home!
Spent five days in Intercontinental Chongqing for a pleasant holiday. As a Black Diamond member of Ctrip, as a senior traveler, I can say responsibly that the InterContinental Raffles Hotel is not only in Chongqing, but also among the top luxury city hotels in the country!

What I want is an explanation from the customer service manager who instructed my aunt not to clean my room, or not. In addition, I need to refund one yuan, and I need to write in the remarks that I refuse to do cleaning so the fee will be refunded. In the end, such a one yuan was not refunded. The hotel plans to refund me a huge sum of 200 yuan directly, and I have no luck to accept it. After staying for four nights, I felt exhausted. Everyone had fake smiles on their faces, and they insisted on asking guests to return more fake smiles. I was exhausted physically and mentally. There is no way, a customer manager, Peng Meimei, said that this is a bad habit of InterContinental, who likes to care about customers infinitely. Although she keeps saying that it is a bad habit, Peng Meimei still has a rather smug expression. Then continue to maintain this inexplicable sense of superiority and pride, laughing is better than crying.

After we arrived, we took the children and did not ask whether we needed children's tableware and seats. Then we adults did not adjust the position of the tableware after sitting down. The standard of restaurant service is the Haidilao mode, and we will continue to collect plates for you and receive you. Feels like breakfast has been interrupted. The restaurant director, Manager Zhang, was extremely arrogant in handling customer problems on the day he was on duty. He used his personal number to call me. There was no door-to-door communication throughout the whole process. Bringing housekeeping to change my room, funny, do you speak English? They did not explain how such problems were caused, nor did they follow up on the dereliction of duty of the manager on duty that day. There is no way to complain to the owner and the hotel group to complain to you! When asked if there is any mosquito medicine, the front desk operator and the manager on duty who said that there were no mosquitoes in the hotel, a hotel as big as yours does not have no medicine at all, and there is no inquiry or trea**ent. Do you think the guests are troublesome? Having service staff like you in the hotel is simply self-destructing the brand. They have no concern for the guests but indifference. Is the threshold for a five-star hotel in Chongqing too low? Is it polite to speak softly? ! The aunties in the hot pot restaurant outside are more enthusiastic than you, so it is still a room of 1.9k per night. This kind of attitude is the only one in the country! If you want to go, please take a look at the sanitation of the hotels opened in 2020, I wish you a happy stay! ! ü•µ

As a result, I received a call from the hotel guest relations director, Miss Kong, the day before check-in, and asked us in detail about our room requirements. We were waiting for us in the lobby early on the day of check-in.

Not only her, but the doorman, front desk, room attendant, restaurant waiter, gym attendant, every employee in the hotel is warm and meticulous, smiling and greeting all the time, asking for needs anytime and anywhere, which makes people suspect that it is Haidilao who lives in the hotel industry. . I didn't expect to travel around for so many years, and the most satisfying one is actually at my doorstep. I lament that the hotel industry in Chongqing has developed to this point! Upvote for them!

Some children immediately asked if they needed a crib or a bed surround. The check-in customer service Vivian arranged a floor and room with a relatively good view and a late check-out, which made people feel cordial and warm. There was also a welcome guest named Li Yingzhong on the first floor. When we met, we helped to carry our luggage.

First of all, the hotel is located in Chaotianmen Square, with an excellent location, surrounded by famous scenic spots, which can be reached on foot or by taxi. Downstairs is the shopping mall and Line 1. It is easy to eat, drink, live and travel. Whether it is day or night, especially at night, the river scenery on both sides of the river is beautiful. Secondly, the hotel is relatively new, the facilities are complete, and the rest is very comfortable. The breakfast is very distinctive, the environment is good, the taste is good, and there are many choices. Finally, the warm and high-quality service adds warmth to the entire stay experience. Whether the doorman, the front desk, the restaurant or the cleaning, the staff encountered in every corner are warm and polite. A highly recommended hotel! Full score üíØ

First of all, the service is very good. The day before the check-in, Vivian, the customer service staff, called me to confirm the arrival time and pillow needs.
After arriving at the store, he patiently answered my questions, recommended the hotel's facilities and features, and helped me upgrade my room. The view from the room is really good. The decoration of the room is also very good. Dyson's hair dryer, Ferragamo's toiletries, as well as gifts and thoughtful cards. I have to say that the first impression this hotel gave me was really good.
But it's a pity that I came here in a hurry this time, and I didn't have time to experience the hotel's gym, bar, etc. I must feel it next time I come here.

After the renovation, it is no exaggeration. I can't sleep at all... Let's live in after the municipal construction is completed...

It‚Äôs not that I think I‚Äôm noble or something. I‚Äôve stayed in a hotel for so many years... Normally tell the hotel in advance these things, the hotel will understand and arrange in advance... I don‚Äôt know what your hotel is doing this time, this is my experience, seek truth from facts No exaggeration... Don't make any other guesses, the travelers who read the reviews have their own considerations...

The InterContinental Chongqing Raffles Hotel is located in the city center, next to the Jialing River and nearly one kilometer away from Hongya Cave, making travel extremely convenient. As shown in the picture, the toiletries in the room are all the verbena flavor I like. The hair dryer is Dyson, and it is directly plugged into the socket and can be used when you pick it up. The room layout is comfortable and the wall is curved. Removed In the corner, there are two separate rooms for bathing and toileting. Although the stay was a little unpleasant this time, I responded to the situation to the lobby manager after checking out. The reception attitude of the other party was very good. The most valuable thing is that I received an email of apology from the hotel administrative assistant manager Mao Zhi after returning.

msg:Surprise hotel, one must review

üöó Transportation:
With a river view, you can take a 20-minute walk along the river to Hongya Cave. The traffic is very convenient.

üçÉEnvironment:
The lobby is on the 42nd floor. There are many soft seat viewpoints, which are super beautiful.
The unexpected result is SHUA on the 42nd floor. The scenery is amazing. Who knows who will go there? Just look at the photos and get a feel.

üîîService:
Customized welcome cards, welcome fruits, and welcome Xiaoshi in line with the Chongqing flavor: twist, strange fava beans, Dengying beef, and red wine are great!

When I come to Chongqing, I recommend to experience this intercontinental hotel!

msg:1. Service 5 stars: Especially praise the response speed and attitude of the housekeeping depar**ent, especially the housekeeping manager. When encountering complaints, we will take the initiative to solve the problems immediately, take the initiative to upgrade the guest rooms reasonably for customers, and quickly and flexibly deal with the complaints crisis encountered. In the comments, some people criticized the front desk for not encountering the poor attitude, and the attitude was very friendly. However, after receiving the luggage, the front desk promised to deliver it to the room before check-in, but it did not honor it. After arriving at the hotel at noon to check in, the luggage was left at the front desk and checked in at 2 pm. It was the guests who took the luggage to the room by themselves. So be criticized.
2. Room 4 stars: I stayed in a twin room with exclusive city view. Overall, it was ok, with a large surface area. I felt that the depth of the room was a bit smaller. In addition, the actual effect of the decoration of the guest room was not as good as the photo. Compared with the lobby and lobby bar, Even compared to elevator halls and walkways, the decoration materials in the guest rooms are slightly cheaper.
3. Environment 5 stars: Chaotianmen Square is downstairs (it‚Äôs very convenient to take a cruise, you can go directly to Pinzishi by ferry to take pictures of the facade of Raffles City), Raffles City (for dining and shopping), and Internet celebrities Hongyadong and the Jiefangbei are all a step away. By the way, from the design point of view, the overall appearance and night view of the entire Raffles City building are still good, especially the night view is also very beautiful, but 1) the architectural details are slightly rough, the facade is mainly window and wall, the material is metal gray, and it is close during the day. Look, it feels like a building 20 years ago, with insufficient refinement. 2) Whether it is a guest room or a viewing gallery, the viewing visual experience is not very good, especially the large number of structural components on the exterior of the viewing gallery, which are all structural parts when seen in the afternoon tea bar for a fee, and the processing is rough.
4. Matching 3 stars: The swimming pool is too small, the gym is too cramped, and the focus is on the breakfast. To be honest, I can only eat enough, and the breakfast standard is only 3 to 4 stars, or even a 4-star hotel. Maybe this is under review Many people criticize it and complain about one of the reasons why Raffles Intercontinental is stingy. In addition, the entire viewing corridor is fully occupied by charging spaces such as restaurants, afternoon tea bars, etc., and there is a lack of public viewing space, and the sky swimming pool is not open to hotel guests.

The service is excellent! Upon arriving at the hotel, the room was very warmly furnished. It was upgraded to a river view room with the light of birthday. Although it was drizzling that day, the view was not good, but my heart was warm. On the second day, I had breakfast at Chonglin Restaurant. The buffet breakfast was rich in variety.

Whether it is hotel services, room facilities or breakfast, they are all very good, especially the sky bar and the air bar are very tall! The bar is an open-air platform overlooking the Yangtze River and Jialing River. It is the best attraction to watch the light show of Chaotianmen Pier at night. There are singers in residence at Hang Bar. The cocktail bartenders here are very professional, and the cocktails they make are very delicious, like it! Hang Bar can be said to be a top bar in Chongqing or anywhere! There is also a wine tasting area and a cigar room. The food at Qing Restaurant in the hotel's sky restaurant is also very delicious. In short, the hardware facilities and software services of InterContinental Chongqing Raffles Hotel deserve to be the standard of a five-star hotel! Later, Chongqing will stay at the hotel. Thanks again to the waiter at the front desk of the hotel for his warm-hearted service during checkout!

msg:I accidentally found this towering hotel, attracted by its luxurious fashion, and stayed decisively.
The hotel has an iconic corridor, I call it "caterpillar", it is very distinctive! The lobby is bold, transparent, and flashes with avant-garde design.
The hotel has upgraded our room, and we can see the mountains and river bridges in Chongqing from the room.
Friendly reminder: The hotel‚Äôs restaurant near the river is the best place to see the confluence of the two rivers-the Chaotianmen Wharf under construction.
What the guest rooms do not say: avant-garde, refreshing and high-end! The toilet is completely separated from the washroom, separated into a small room with a wash basin, which is too high-end.
The area functions of the room are super strong: leisure, sleep, business, bar counter, not only expressly indicated by furniture, but also have enough space. The walk-in cloakroom is completely open, convenient and hygienic!
I got the bar and afternoon tea experience voucher for the hotel package. I learned about the "Jing" restaurant and I really liked its decoration; I went to have afternoon tea again ~ there are salty snacks, praise üëç
The bar is magnificent and magnificent. You can see the "rotating stairs" of Internet celebrities. Although they can't go up due to the epidemic, the photos are absolutely beautiful!
The breakfast is so rich that I can hardly finish or see how many kinds of food there are; moreover, most of the food is distributed with the help of the waiter, which not only reflects the standard configuration of "service", but also eliminates the most unhygienic link of the buffet ~ everyone All can start.
The swimming pool is also an amazing part; the water is cool, the pool is large, the facilities are complete ~ towels (very strange recently, many hotel swimming pools do not have towels); the toiletries are of high quality.
problem:
The restaurant is arranged as a vending truck or kiosk. It is very inconvenient to take food. It is impossible to see the food to be taken. The passage is narrow and crowded, which is not hygienic! The creativity is great, and the actual operation is a bit difficult.

The concierge in the lobby led us to the corresponding room with luggage after we checked in. The size of the room is very large. Because of personal preference, I paid special attention to the cleaning of the bathtub, which was unexpectedly clean. The hotel also provides turn-down service before six o'clock in the evening. Although there were some episodes during the stay, the hotel‚Äôs attitude and methods of actively solving problems made people feel cordial. Special mention should be made of Ms. Liu Yuyang, the manager, and Mr. Wen Zou, the concierge. After checking in, Manager Liu asked us about our check-in experience and how to improve the hotel several times by phone and meeting, and took the trouble to introduce us to the mountain city and solve the small problems we encountered during our stay. Mr. Zou helped us to take a taxi when we were away from the store, and promptly helped us communicate with the driver when the taxi master could not find the hotel location, and actively helped us carry all our luggage when the taxi was far away. Your service made me feel the enthusiasm and kindness of the people in Shancheng, and it is also the hotel I must stay in next time I come to Chongqing.

At night, the three latitude light *****s of Nanbin Road, Inner Ring Expressway, Mountain Top Golden Eagle and Nanshan Observation Deck outline a three-dimensional mountain city landscape.
The layout of the room is reasonable, the bedroom and washing space are relatively isolated. For the child‚Äôs birthday, a family of three asked for a two-bed noble room. The child was very excited. The bathtub did not come out for more than half an hour. There is a small bluetooth speaker at the head of the bed, which can play light music to help sleep.

Go directly to the 42nd floor lobby through the arrival hall. The room is arranged on the 63rd floor with good visibility. The room hardware facilities are good, and the service also left us a deep impression. The reception staff took us to the elevator entrance, and the floor attendant asked whether to turn down the bed and replenish the equipment in time, and the service staff would greet us enthusiastically wherever we went. The breakfast is also good. The sight of Shaba is very good, you can see different views during the day and night, and the attitude of the service staff is very good, but the price is small. The swimming pool may be the cause of the epidemic. There are very few guests. It has become a special show for my husband and I am very happy. Special thanks to Kong Jie Vivian, the representative of customer relations, not only has a warm attitude and super affinity, but also gave us red wine and fruit, which made us feel the sincerity of InterContinental to our customers. I will bring my parents next time.

msg:The InterContinental Hotel is worthy of its name. The hardware and software equipment and location are quite good. Pick up your luggage from the concierge on the first floor (delivered free of charge from the previous hotel) and take the elevator up to the 42nd floor air reception hall. Every corner is pleasing to the eye. You can enjoy the scenery in front of the hall while you check in. Swipe the card to enter the room on the 56th floor, the curtains automatically open, and the city view and part of the river view come into view. The toilet is separated from wet and dry, each equipped with a sink, the shower room and bathtub space is particularly large. The design of the whole room is modern and comfortable, the color of gold, green and white is light and luxurious. I booked the lunch at Chong Lin Restaurant the next day. The dining environment is relaxed and pleasant, the food is exquisite, the service is attentive, and I am very happy.

You can also enter Raffles L4 at about 11 pm, and the security will tell you to take the sightseeing elevator to the LG floor to the hotel.

The bar is very beautiful, you can go for a drink when you have time. The breakfast room is also modern in style. Western and light meals are also available at noon. The Chinese restaurant has some dishes. Downstairs is a large shopping mall, convenient for shopping. The sightseeing hall on the top of the building belongs to the property.

msg:Because it is a Chongqing internet celebrity landmark check-in hotel for more than a year, the price is really not cheap. The first day is a normal room type of about 1500 per night. The next day, you will pay more than 400 to upgrade to an executive, but it is still a low floor. The scenery is either divided into two halves or blocked by a horizontal oval ceiling, and the room is very small, and the living is very depressing. The toilet area is even smaller to the extreme, and the breakfast is not very rich. It is entirely for creating an online celebrity check-in area. There are various sky gardens, but the internal quality is really worse than other hotels of the same type. Even Beijing Sanlitun Yingke is much better than this. Moreover, the shopping mall is closed after ten o‚Äôclock in the evening, there are no convenience stores around, and everything can only be ordered for takeaway. If you plan to walk back to the hotel after a late night snack, you have to walk the viaduct to go back. There is no hotel entrance on the front of Raffles City. Must go under the underground parking lot, super troublesome

msg:I have ever lived in a five-star hotel with the worst experience, worst service, and plastic room decoration facilities. I really doubt whether it is owned by IHG. The service attitude is very poor from the check-in phone enquiry. The waiter is like an uncle, and the overall service is particularly unprofessional. Several aluminum-plastic panels are used for the decoration of the lobby. The material and design of the public area are very cheap. Is it possible to put a few pieces of machine-made carbon in the room to absorb formaldehyde? Forgive me for my ignorance! The slippers below are compared with the slippers of the previous hotel staying at the top, and the price is different. In the room decoration, the "stone" background wall is a wall panel with a paper-printed film, and the sound insulation is not good. The only thing worth mentioning about the terrible check-in experience is that it occupies a very good river view position in Chongqing. If you want to check in, you only need to go to the restaurant on the 42nd floor to take a photo. The room is really not worth living. It feels like a leather bag hotel that learns to decorate a five-star hotel with cheap materials and then spends money to find IHG to operate it!

When I arrived at the hotel after one o'clock in the afternoon, the front desk actually said that the rooms on the upper floors of the 58th to 65th floors were not vacant. They said that the guests on these floors would not check out until 2 pm, and then we would not be able to check in until 4 pm after cleaning the room. , strongly urged us to get a room on the lower floor. We doubt the front desk's statement. Have all the guests on the 8th floor agreed to delay check-out until 2pm? In addition, the staff of the hotel's executive lounge also lacked rules. The executive lounge clearly stated that it was closed at 23:00. As a result, the drinks in the freezer were locked half an hour earlier, which made our trip in vain.

msg:The overall service is very rough, the form is more important than the content. It is a hotel that I want to blacklist InterContinental after staying here. It makes people wonder whether it is the same brand as other InterContinental.
You are not allowed to wear slippers in the breakfast room. You have to wear formal clothes to eat breakfast to deserve your five-star rating, right? Then you have to ask customers to change into their public shoes. Who knows if the shoes are clean? If they are infected with foot diseases, will they be responsible? Moreover, during the epidemic, they do not require people entering to wear masks, but require them to change into public shoes, which is also incredible.
What is particularly arrogant is that if the customers are really informed, the customers will not fail to comply with the regulations, but from the beginning of the check-in procedure, no one has said a word. The male waiter also arrogantly said that this rule is written on a page of a thick manual in the room. If you don‚Äôt inform in advance, will every guest who stays in the room carefully read every corner of the thick manual? Where does InterContinental get such a big face?
This is the first time I have encountered such a bad InterContinental. The night before, I opened a bottle of red wine in the lounge. When the waiter opened the wine, he directly scraped the bottle cap back and forth on the table, scraping out a lot of residue, and then swept it directly to the ground with his hands. No one cared about the garbage on the ground.
Instead of being poor, they should make some improvements in service. It's really embarrassing for InterContinental.
