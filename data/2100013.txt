msg:Facilities: First of all, I am very grateful to the hotel for arranging me to the 12th floor, where the facilities are very intact. The problem of some rooms on the 7th floor that I complained about before no longer exists. But I was still a little worried whether I would be affected by the secondhand smoke from the next door because it was not a non-smoking floor. Fortunately, there was no smell of smoke for those two days! The bricks on the square outside the lobby should be well maintained, especially in the places where cars pass by, many bricks are uneven and easy to cause pedestrians to trip.
Hygiene: No problems were found, worthy of praise👍

Environment: As good as always! Winter plum blossoms are beginning to bloom! Seeing a very caring mother with a child, the child holding a branch of winter plum in his hand, I felt mixed emotions...
Service: The breakfast waiter was a little too eager to get off work. Since the end time is stipulated, all meal collection should start after the end time! Of course, I also understand that this is a problem that is difficult for state-owned enterprises to solve.

msg:The hotel doesn't have air conditioning. I called the front desk to inquire. The service staff replied to us with a bad attitude. Some said it was cold and some said it was hot. Finally, there was no air conditioning. You can open the window or find you an electric fan. I asked again how many stars the hotel is and how this could happen. The service desk replied that we don't have any stars. This happened on October 14. I didn't sleep much that night. The room was stuffy and hot. Guests who want to check in should consult the front desk before going through the formalities.

The lobby is bright and a**ospheric, the environment is good, and it is also equipped with a pleasant fragrance. The service provided by Miss Yingtong is very good and of high quality. She took the initiative to introduce me to the hotel's business premises and surrounding attractions, and asked if the room was needed. The room was also upgraded for free to an executive king-size bed room. The elevator needs to be cleaned, the sound insulation effect is good, the facilities and equipment in the room are complete, clean, and the field of vision is wide. The executive room toiletries are from Herborist and are very gentle to use. The price of the hotel is very suitable, and the cost performance is high. I am very satisfied every time I stay here, and I will come again!

Recently, I have been less frequent due to the epidemic. The hotel has not changed. The only thing that has changed is that the service level of the front desk is too poor. They also threw the work card at me, which is very disappointing. When checking out, the front desk staff left after receiving me. When I asked, they answered that they did not call back for room inspection. I kept waiting and did not say anything. I left on my own after ten minutes. Afterwards, someone called me on a private phone, not to understand the situation, but to warn me, haha.

中石油旗下管道局所屬的這家酒店就是這樣豪橫！
商務出差預訂了這家酒店，最後一晚沒有入住就因為時間過了當天18:00，**豪橫！
要知道當天回酒店紙頭被告知第二天早上8:00-18:00酒店停水停電停氣！這個節奏不是要妥妥的黑我一天房費嘛
因為當天下午4點多回酒店，中飯的時候喝了酒，到酒店時衹好睡過頭了，沒有及時退房！當我醒來臨時決定到另外一座城市出差之後。就發生了上述奇葩的事情！話説回來，就是我繼續住在廊坊，我也是要換酒店住的！
感動於攜程各級部門高效負責的態度以及積極溝通,廊坊國際酒店還是非常成功的拒絕了消費者和平台的合法權益，因為我是商旅人士，沒有時間和他們**，不然我肯定要通過這件事情來測試廊坊市消費者協會以及廊坊市市長熱線抑或廊坊市各級法院服務普通消費者的態度和主持正義！
感謝攜程主動承諾並且承擔了最後一晚房費的退還！
攜程。值得信賴和託付！
廊坊國際酒店還在那，但是在我心中，它已經死了，屎了！！！
