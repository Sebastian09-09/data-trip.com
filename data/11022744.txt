msg:I stayed here twice for my business trip in Shanghai. I will 100% stay here again and I’ve already recommended my colleagues to stay here when they’re visiting.

Joy, who helped me at the reception, is warm, attentive to details, and welcoming. She paid attention to all the special requests I had. 

All the staff I encountered during my stay were very friendly and helpful. 

The gym is very very well equipped and maintained with both cardio and weight machines. 

Location is walking friendly and also ride share-friendly. I was able to get a ride very quickly every time. 

The hotel is also connected to a mall so you don’t have to walk outside if it’s raining.

The buffet breakfast was pretty ordinary in terms of its selection and even quality. However, the staff came across as being very friendly and approachable for help, esp the front office guy and the lady who greets the guests with an amicable smile and sincerity.

msg:We have stayed in many other hotels in Shanghai with bigger names, and we feel Sukhothai is probably the most underrated boutique 5 star hotel in Shanghai. Today is our 2nd last day staying at the hotel and we are already looking forward to coming back in the future. 

The location is impeccable. The hotel is connected to one of Shanghai’s most prestigious shopping malls and the metro station. You are surrounded by local eateries, restaurants, coffee shops, convenience stores etc. this means the hotel can be a perfect spot to stay for a staycation or a business trip. 

We truely feel we are home away from home during the stay. We arrived early in the morning after a long haul flight and were greeted with warm welcome by Kearan (sorry if I spelt your name wrong) at concierge. Check in was a smooth process with a personal touch. The staffs at concierge have been very helpful with organising a humidifier for our room and delivering  packages to our room. Our house keeper Sunny Chen prepared decaf herbal tea for us every evening  for us to wind down at the end of the day and made sure our humidifier is in working order.

We also thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the hotel amenities: the Retreat Spa, the Zuk bar and the Urban Cafe. The Thai style massage at the retreat spa was literally a life saver for us on our first day in Shanghai after an 11 hour flight. We walked into the spa feeling like a zombie and walked out feeling soooo refreshed (special thanks to my therapist Lucy! Sorry we did not get the name of the other therapist). We spent two nights in a row in the zuk bar and were impressed by the menu created by their talented mixologist Daniel. We tried 6 of Daniel’s original cocktails inspired different cities/regions around the world. Each cocktail is infused with a signature flavour of the region it’s named after,  we feel like our tastebuds have taken us around the world. We also want to express our special thanks to Zuk’s who is very informative and helpful with our choices. We had a late dinner last night at the urban cafe and was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Thai food offered there. Sandy was our waitress who was so attentive and helpful to ensure we had an epic dining experience with a warm personal touch. Big thumbs up to Sandy, Monica and the urban cafe staffs!

Last but not least, we’d like to thank and congratulate the management team at Sukhothai for having such talented , diligent and dedicated crew. Sukhothai is easily our favourite hotel in Shanghai and we look forward to returning!

The staff seems constantly confused and unable to answer simple questions or provide the basics you'd expect from a Sukhothai property. 

For the amount of money you're paying to stay here, it's completely not worth it. This type of service can be expected / accepted from a local hotel chain but not from an international institution like Sukhothai.

Big fail. Big Zero for me. Not coming back.

msg:There is a place at the front desk where you can put your bag during check-in, which I personally find very convenient. I like the smell of the guest room toiletries. The packaging design of the toothpaste is also a small surprise. The overall stay is comfortable, heart-warming, and relaxing. It’s a little regretful that this time I was on a business trip and was too busy to experience other facilities, equipment and space design, and I didn’t have time to take photos. I’ll continue to choose next time.

msg:The front desk of the hotel is very patient. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel that the whole hotel is fragrant and peaceful. The hotel adopts gray and metallic tones as a whole, which gives a low-key and restrained feeling.
The door card is a wooden card with a very textured feel; the bathrobes, nightgowns and slippers in the room are very skin-friendly and comfortable. The curtains have very good light blocking properties, and the bedding is also ergonomic, making it easy for people to fall into deep sleep.
It is worth mentioning that the goodnight tea has a really good sleep-aiding effect.
The hotel's breakfast is not very varied, but each one is made with great care and is delicious.
I didn't have the opportunity to experience the gym this time, so I look forward to the next time:)

Everything is handled properly. At the end of the hotel, a surprise gift was given when I left. I am already looking forward to my next stay. I would like to add that Jing'an is really the most worthwhile hotel to try. The degree of newness, service level, catering facilities, and price. Hexagonal tactics. The photo is the corridor from the hotel to Taikoo Hui. You can see the official picture in the room. No lie.

However, there are still many complaints about this stay: only one set of toothbrush and toothpaste was given to two people, the button panel of the smart toilet was broken, and it didn't work no matter how I pressed it. There were many people for breakfast, and the vegetables and sauces at the salad bar took a long time to be refilled. The serving utensils were also super mini.

The room type I stayed in this time was slightly different. The furniture arrangement with the desk behind the bed was quite interesting.

The room is clean and modern, the facilities are well maintained and there are no traces of old age. The toilet is a smart toilet and very thoughtful. The shower and bathtub locations are both spacious. Welcome fruit is provided almost every time you stay ➕Free drinks in the minibar

This time I mainly came to eat Thai food at the urbancafe downstairs. It is said that the chef is very good and the menu will be updated every six months. The food ingredients are fresh and taste good. Every place is well prepared. To put it simply, it should be tender when it should be and crispy when it should be 😂😂

Joy at the front desk has a very good attitude and solves the problem quickly. Anyway, the whole thing is comfortable😌
I will choose Sukhothai next time~

msg:The service of this hotel is good. Because it is cheaper to pay in-store than online, I chose the option of paying in-store. However, because BOSS checked in late, he paid the security deposit remotely. Later, because I wanted to extend my stay for another three nights, I called the staff. JOY was super attentive. The phone call was handled immediately. I have to say that the efficiency is really fast. Moreover, the concierge staff delivered the courier to the room very quickly. Full marks for service 💯

Rich breakfast and comfortable room experience.

The only drawback is that no one answered the room service calls several times during my stay, so I went to the front desk to check if the room phone was broken. Later I found out that no one answered it. Maybe they were busy during the stay because of the heavy traffic, but really. I hope to improve this aspect and it will be perfect.

The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and proactive in providing service. The waiters at the front desk, bar and restaurant are all very good. In particular, I would like to praise Remy at the front desk (definitely a spontaneous praise). He is very enthusiastic and active in helping solve problems.

The room is very stylish. This is my first time designing a room like this. The spacious sofa, desk, and deep bathtub were very comfortable. The flow line is also very functional. The equipment provided was almost perfect. It was also nice that the bath towels were large.

Breakfast had a lot of variety, and all of the Japanese, Western, and Chinese dishes were delicious. Omelettes, wontons, noodles, etc. are made right in front of you. There were so many types of bread and they were delicious.

The hotel was so comfortable that I wanted to check out right away. I would love to stay again.

msg:Strike while the iron is hot. I stayed in the hotel's most basic double bed room. Overall, the price/performance ratio was very low. Let me write about my feelings about this hotel room and all aspects:
1. The front desk staff has no warm service and will not take the initiative to provide some key information, similar to the question of check-out time.
2. The total deposit is 1,500. The deposit is refunded very slowly. When checking out, the staff will tell you that the deposit will be refunded in the same way, but it has not been refunded. For hotels in any other region, whether it is a hotel in Hong Kong or Macau, the deposit will be credited to your account immediately upon check-out. I almost forgot to refund the deposit, but one of my sisters told me that the deposit had not been refunded for two or three weeks after checking out, so I had to call the hotel to refund the deposit. So I called to confirm, and the reply I got was that it would be credited within 48 hours. However, bank employees tell everyone that even if it is an inter-bank transfer, it will arrive within 24 hours, and there will be no refund after 48 hours.
3. The room is a high-end version of the All Seasons, but the necessary facilities such as shower rooms are not as good as the All Seasons. For example: there is no door in the shower room (which directly makes it very cold when taking a shower, which is very inconvenient for customers with traveling companions); the water pressure of the shower head is average, heavy, and the temperature is very low and cannot be adjusted (it may freeze to death in winter)
4. Apart from the toilet, there is no paper towel bucket or trash can in the room, which is very inconvenient.
5. The sound insulation is relatively poor. You can clearly hear the voices of people in the corridor outside in the room.
6. Takeout can only be delivered to a takeout counter more than ten meters away from the hotel (although this is understandable for a high-end hotel, it may be troublesome and freezing in winter)
7. The lighting is dim at night. There are only a few spotlights. You may not be able to see the food even if you eat in the room.

I communicated with the hotel about the room layout the day before check-in, and the hotel implemented it very well. On the day we arrived at the hotel, a young lady named Bi at the front desk checked us in with a very friendly and thoughtful service. She personally took the room card to the lobby and handed it to me.
The housekeeping service is also nothing to mention, from the housekeeping colleagues generously giving me pens as souvenirs to turning down the bed.
Finally, there is the decoration style, which is mainly brass and sage green. It is very eye-catching and will be my first choice when I come to Shanghai in the future.

I finally had the long-awaited deep sleep! (Although I haven’t found the most suitable pillow yet, I’ve had to change three of them, but they still feel so average and I’m embarrassed to ask for another one. Hahahaha!) Then the person in charge in those days seemed to be the short-haired, big-eyed cleaning lady. very very good! Very kind! The cleaning was super clean and very attentive! There is a swimming instructor with a gold chain downstairs who is also very nice! The only thing is that when I first checked in, I felt that the overall fragrance of the hotel was not very good. There was some smell like building materials in the corridors and rooms? I feel like it may be because I don't have my own fragrance system. The lobby is okay, but I'm a little more concerned when I walk up the corridor and into the room. But it’s not an odor! Just no scent! I personally care about the fragrance of the hotel space, so I am a little dissatisfied! But the check-in experience was really good. I originally booked another place nearby but decided to extend my stay here! I will definitely stay at Sukhothai again if I go to Shanghai again! OK OK! ! ! 👍

This was not written in the hotel check-in instructions, and there was no reminder in the order. Or introduce the nearby parking spaces to customers so that they can easily find them, but there is nothing. Checking out today, I met Master She on the 14th floor. He was enthusiastic, reasonable and patient in answering my questions. I was very satisfied. I hope that more employees in the hotel can proactively solve problems for guests like Master She.

msg:The hotel is conveniently located and connected to Taikoo Hui, but the service is really bad! Everyone knows that check-out at 2 o'clock is the most basic, and they threaten to deduct half the room fee. My son is 16 years old and his name has been registered. I am taking a shower and it is inconvenient to go downstairs to pick him up because I forgot to bring my room card and asked the front desk to help swipe the elevator card. There are a lot of rejections, but if you go downstairs and pick yourself up, there will be no problem, and the sound insulation is very, very poor! The sound of running water in the shower next door in the middle of the night was like construction work in my ears. The room was very stuffy, the bed was too soft, and the pillows were too high. Really, only the decoration was beautiful, and there was nothing else to like about it. ps: Attached is the sound of water being discharged next door recorded at 2 a.m. for nearly an hour...

msg:I decided to stay at this hotel for a few days by chance during my trip back to China, and I was very satisfied with the result:
-The lady who checked in at the front desk was very polite and warm.
-I like the decoration of the room very much. The style is modern Southeast Asian style. It is beautiful and kept very new, but the touch switch responds slowly. The toiletries are very good. They seem to be from Australia. I can't remember, but they come in large bottles. I don't think they are cheap. There is a reminder on the wall next to them that you can ask for small bottles if needed, so I asked for a set.
The bed was comfortable but a little on the soft side, which was a drawback.
-The location is excellent. The hotel is directly connected to Taikoo Hui shopping mall. It is also very convenient to get to the subway. It is only one stop away from Jing'an Temple.
-The Italian restaurant on the ground floor is a Michelin restaurant. It is delicious and the service is very good. The waiters are very enthusiastic and smile. For the first time in ten days of traveling back to China, I finally felt that the restaurant service is in line with international standards.

msg:The room was very clean and the morning was nothing like a 5 star hotel. Food variety is too stingy. Not worth buying in the morning. The two restaurants downstairs are very expensive, but the food tastes very average, and the Thai and Italian restaurants are a bit superficial.

I booked this hotel just for the gym! But the gym is also very small, and there are a lot of personal training classes. I thought I could enjoy a hotel without going to the gym and grabbing equipment, but I never thought that I couldn't avoid it at all. There are people for every device.
The design of the hotel is beautiful, but that's all. The seating in the lobby is very cramped.
The overall feeling is a relatively cold hotel

msg:The hotel has a good sense of design. The fragrance in the lobby smells good, but unfortunately it is not for sale. The sunflowers placed at the front desk make people want to take a photo. The mirror in the elevator is very unique and makes people feel bright , The corridor on the floor is dark but has a strong sense of a**osphere. The diatom wall and large French windows in the room are really exciting. The bed is very soft and very comfortable for sleeping. There are also many types of pillows to choose from. Their toiletries are really good It is easy to use and smells very good, and the location is just in the business district. It is very convenient to go everywhere. It is also very convenient to go directly from the hotel to the Xingye TaiKoo Hui shopping mall next door.

The services of Alvin and Joy at the front desk are very good, which impressed me very much. They basically solved all the problems during my stay. At that time, I told the hotel that I might arrive early. I was ready to wait for the room until the afternoon, but at noon When I went to check in after 12 o'clock, I still helped me to coordinate out of the room. I just waited for less than 10 minutes and checked in smoothly. When I checked out, I saw that I was carrying big and small bags, and I would ask if I needed help with my luggage. The storage also reflects their carefulness. Of course, there was a small problem during the check-in period, but Angela, the manager on duty that day, helped me solve it very quickly and smoothly. It did not affect my check-in experience at all. The whole process was very clean and neat, very major,

The hotel's swimming pool and gym are also good. There are few people, the water quality is very clear, the quality of the equipment is also very good, and the breakfast level is not worse than other big brand star hotels

In short, the hotel is very cost-effective, it is worth a try, it will be my first choice for traveling in Shanghai

The door of the card-swiping room is particularly well-lit, and the scenery from the two large French windows is also very beautiful. After taking a bath and lying on the bed in pajamas, it is like magic that urges you to sleep!
After waking up, you can go to the Bar downstairs to drink some wine and eat some food, and go back to enjoy your vacation!
The breakfast on the second day was rich in variety and delicious! !
I didn't experience the gym, swimming pool and spa this time, so I can only save it until next time

Next to it is Xingye Taikoo Hui, and the Man coffee on the first floor is good, which can meet the daily energy needs. The fragrance is changed in the house every day, and it smells very good when you enter the house. The 2.2-meter bed is booked, and the family of three sleeps without being crowded. There are seven or eight pillows to choose from. The bed was very comfortable. The air outlet of the air conditioner can be adjusted in ten gears, which is very good. The TV said that it can cast the screen, but I tried it, but it couldn't. Sound insulation is good. The curtains have a high degree of shading and are very friendly to light sleepers. The accompanying toiletries smell good, even though they are domestic brands. The only downside is that the view outside the window is mediocre, which can be ignored for those who go out early and return late every day.

msg:This style of hotel is my favorite. There are not many in China, and I happen to be living in Shanghai during this time, so I came here for a staycation.
🛏️The keywords of the hotel itself seem to me to be nature, environmental protection and holiday style. The gray-green wall paint is very bold, but it is eye-catching and comfortable when matched with the log decoration, and the soft decoration is also very homely. I have to admire Neri&Hu's design, which is not sensational but has unique taste.
Location:
Needless to say, the location is a supporting hotel in TaiKoo Hui. It sits on the south and the north of The Middle House, and there is a corridor in the middle. You can go out of the hotel and enter the shopping mall, which is very convenient.
Service:
When checking in, the Hollywood room type was upgraded. There is nothing wrong with the service, the doors are opened when entering and exiting, and the luggage is well done. In the middle, he cleaned the bathroom once, and turned it on together with the night bed, and the data cable was also handled in detail. 👝
spare parts:
The Thai hotel guessed that it would use essential oils for natural flavors, called bio-aesthetics, which seems to be an Australian brand, quite refreshing. Cleansing and care are all in large bottles, but you can also call for small bottles.
There are not many items in the Mini bar, but it is quite boutique, and the first round is free. My favorite San Pellegrino, coconut water. The tea bag is from Basao, which is a hundred times stronger than orange juice and cola. The water is Dolomia in two large glass bottles. 🫗
Detail:
The buttons are very convenient to use, and the detailed pictures of the switches are specially marked. The texture of the shower facilities is very good, and the remote control is also customized by the hotel itself, which is not cheap. But no bluetooth speaker and bathtub set.
Style:
In the past few years, there are quite a lot of hotels that want to be environmentally friendly, but the actual experience is either that they are not economical, or they cut corners in the name of environmental protection, resulting in a poor experience. Sukhothai is considered to be a good one. The large bottle of glass water and washing and care are all manifestations of environmental protection. 🔖
Banner Tips Disposable cards are almost invisible, and even the pens are made of paper. Linen skin-friendly pajamas and yoga mats are also provided. It's immersive, not a show. 🧘

Service: There is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of details. For example, there is no water in the lobby, it takes a long time to answer the phone, and no one pulls the door when you leave the hotel with your luggage, etc. In short, the service is not worthy of the price, and the hardware and software are good.

Just spend all your money on marketing on Xiaohongshu, to avoid lightning, avoid lightning, and avoid lightning! ! !
I checked in after 11pm and it was said to be the last room of this room type. When I arrived, the room was in the corner. To open the door, I had to walk down a corridor and then open a door to get to the room. The area of ​​the room I paid for was equal to the area of ​​the corridor. The layout of the entire room was skewed and uneven, which was extremely uncomfortable. After communication, the front desk told you that you didn't pay enough, so if you want a better room, you have to pay another 2,000 to upgrade... This kind of quality is also rare for hotels with PUA customers.
The worst thing is that there is no heating in the room in such a cold winter, and the air conditioner blows cold air. After the complaint was made, the manager on duty came with maintenance and said it had been repaired. After leaving, there was still a cold wind. Because I was tired and sleepy late at night, I could only sleep on it, and the cold wind blew all night.
When I checked out and reported this issue, the manager's attitude was extremely bad. The only plan he gave me was to upgrade your room next time. Who would dare to come back to such an expensive hotel like yours?
The service and facilities are very poor. Who will complain?

Unfortunately, no matter how brilliant the design is, wooden door frames, diatom mud walls and other environmentally friendly and low-carbon behaviors still cannot stop the "cheap" temperament. Let’s talk about service. After 11:00 p.m., I called three service calls, but no one answered; after 11:00 p.m., I asked for toothpicks, but I was told that the food and beverage depar**ent was off work. To sum it up in one sentence "not worth the price"

msg:1. The location is pretty good in Jing'an District. There is a corridor to TaiKoo Hui
2. As soon as I entered the door, I encountered the rubber band/pen of the previous house completely broken/a lot of dirt on the wall
3. The service staff will remember your name, but have I received the call?
4. You can’t deliver food (like I just love staying in a hotel and it’s uncomfortable)
5. Facilities, gymnasium, swimming pool and steaming are pretty good
6. It’s really hard not to prepare toiletries. After the stay, I realized that I didn’t seem to comb my hair and the front desk didn’t ask you if you want it🙅
7. There are two water soft drinks and a little fruit, it feels okay
8. I really like the TV programs with foreign language channels and the bedding is also very good.
9. The sound in the corridor is easy to hear. Maybe the door is not well separated, and the house is fine.
10. The interior style is creamy green and I like the desk as a whole. I like that it can be placed casually (BTW the carpet outside the house is quite ugly)
Summary: It's worth living but be prepared.

msg:After staying in several other hotels in 5 years, I chose Sukhothai again. The experience is still as good as ever. The service level is still soft, comfortable and delicate. Although the hardware facilities are not as brand new as they just opened, they are well protected and there are no traces of excessive use. I am deeply moved. Next time I want to choose Sukhothai, there is an episode. There is still some time before the next trip, so I want to see other facilities of the hotel. I like the stairs in the middle of the lobby because there is no notice board. I think it is open to the public, so I want to go upstairs. Seeing that when we climbed two or three steps, we were stopped by the staff who were not so soft and gentle. To be honest, we felt very embarrassed and even a little angry. If the isolation railing affects the appearance, why not put a small sign Woolen cloth? If the small logo also affects the overall style and seems inappropriate, then we must accept that there will be residents who are attracted by the beauty and want to go up and have a look.
I don’t know if this has affected my mood. When I went to the outdoor thezukbar, the service was not up to standard. I didn’t know the meal without greeting.
But it is worth affirming that the staff at the front desk and the staff in the restaurant are very professional in their service attitude and speech skills, making people feel very comfortable~

At other 5-star hotels in Shanghai, I encountered many staff who could not speak English well, but the staff at this place were all friendly and spoke English well, so there was no inconvenience.
In particular, my friend suddenly suffered from allergies, and with the help of the staff, he was able to buy medicine at a nearby pharmacy even on Sunday. The staff at Joy He, who helped me during check-in and when I found the pharmacy, was very friendly and professional, so I had a pleasant stay in Shanghai. The day I checked out, the staff at Leo Lee were also friendly and memorable. I would definitely visit again.

msg:This year I often stay at Sukhothai during my business trip to Shanghai. It is a very unique hotel, quiet and artistic, and I have a good impression.

I stayed at Sukhothai again this Wednesday. I went to the front desk around 2pm and was told that the room was not ready yet and I had to wait for 20 minutes, so I went to sit on the sofa at the door and waited. About seven or eight minutes later, I heard the two front desk staff mentioning my name in a joking and mocking tone. When I was wondering why they were talking about me, the front desk staff came over and told me that the room was ready. When I got to the room, I found that it was A special-shaped room, with the bed facing the door diagonally. Only then did I realize that maybe the front desk was saying that the enemy had finally moved into this room. I asked to change rooms and after waiting for about an hour, I was assigned to a new room around 3:30.

Frankly speaking, it is a common thing to have to wait for a room, and I am not annoyed. After arranging a special-shaped room, I am not angry if it is changed to a normal room at my request, but I cannot accept the front desk talking about guests in private. Respecting guests is the basic principle of hotel service staff. Literacy.

We originally planned to stay for three days, but checked out early the next day and moved to another hotel. If possible, I would like Sukhothai to retrieve the surveillance and recordings from that day. I need to know what the front desk staff said about me. If it's my fault, I can also apologize to your staff.

msg:It's the first time I give a bad review to a hotel in so many years, it's a very bad experience.
The hotel facilities and services are quite satisfactory. The bathroom and bathtub have dead corners. The appearance of the detachable rain shower head is even more unspeakable. The room has a connecting door with other rooms. Although it is locked, I don't like this feeling, and the front desk didn't mention this to me when I checked in. Not enough spare large towels. Mattresses and pillows are relatively comfortable, which is the only satisfactory place. That's all, I'm too lazy to comment.
The real problem is that after I left the store, I called me during the process of meeting customers outside. I thought I had left something behind, but I was rude and didn't tell me what happened. I waited for a long time for no answer. After a while, I called again, and the result was that I was told that the three small hand towels were dirty and I needed to pay for them. serious? ? ? Because I didn't have time to argue during the reception, so I let it deduct a hundred or so yuan.
The so-called "dyeing" of these two or three small towels is because the family needs to drink traditional Chinese medicine. The cup containing the medicine was accidentally spilled. Out of a normal reaction, I wiped the spilled medicine with a small towel, which is also called "staining". up. The gesture of the hotel’s Xingshi asking for guilt is to tell me that if any liquid is accidentally spilled in the future, just let it drip, and just throw the tail of your hand to you, right? Or do I still need to consider whether your towels are washed or not before I stay in the hotel? Shall I help you take the operating costs into account? I am your customer, not the boss and employee, ridiculous. Or, the SOP training in your hotel is to make employees always ready to question customers and ask questions over the phone? ?
Taking a step back, you can think that the accident where the drink spilled was my responsibility, ok, I have no problem with compensation. But I can also say that your attitude and service experience to me is extremely poor. I will not stay again next time. Of course, I will also share my real experience with others.

Service: No matter when you get in or out of the car, someone will come to help you open the door and get things. This is a plus.



Hygiene: It feels very good in a five-star hotel. Every day, an aunt will come to ask if you need to collect clothes for washing, but the laundry service is an additional charge.

Facilities: automatic curtains, blackout and screen windows. The bathroom and toilet are separated from wet and dry. The bed was huge and the pillows were just the right height. The bed is just right, not too soft.

The decoration style of the room is full of cheap feeling, and it feels gloomy and uncomfortable. 4. When I checked in, I wanted a room on a high floor, but I didn't give it if there was a room, and said it would take at least an hour and a half to clean it. 5. There was no waiter asking about the experience of staying at the hotel when checking out. 6. Of course, when going out, a waiter came into the room to clean up the room, and also sent a cup of tea, which is not bad. Overall, the experience is not good, this price and cost performance will not live again in the future

Parking is not allowed at the gate, even if you check in and take your luggage, you will be reminded by the security guard.
The hotel does not have six small suites. It is understandable. Is it difficult to ask if it is necessary when checking in?
Check out at 12 o'clock, ask the front desk if you can stop the car at the door temporarily, move your luggage, and go out for a meal. The front desk said coldly, no.
Summary: Inhumane, inconsiderate, and inconvenient. The reason why he decided to go home was because his wife was pregnant, so he didn't have to walk too much. In the end, he walked more because he needed to find a parking space.
ps: 21 hours after checking out, the deposit has not been refunded

msg:I stayed here once 2 years ago. I lived in a deluxe room. The room was so big. It was decorated in gray tones with wood veneer, which is my favorite style. Then when I happened to be staying there, there were celebrities and many people, but the front desk service was still very efficient and smiling, leaving a good impression.
This time I booked an ordinary room type. Although the area is small, the overall feeling is still very comfortable. It has a five-star standard, but it also has the feeling of some home temperature, which is very comfortable. My mother asked me this time if I had stayed in this hotel before. I asked her, and she remembered it after so long. After all, the elderly don't pay much attention to this. She said that she remembered the bathrobe here, which was very soft and warm. She is very impressed! Just like the service here, it is relaxed, pleasant and efficient. The service has not changed in the past two years. No wonder many celebrities come to live here, and they have lived in the Middle House opposite before, um... the high-end Leng Bing (whether it is the room or the service)
In addition, the lobby bar of Sukhothai is a hidden professional gin bar, which is said to be the most complete gin wine collection in Shanghai👍

msg:The overall style is light industrial, and the tone of dark bronze is my favorite style. After I got to know it, I realized that it was originally from the same designer of Aman. Thanks to the upgrade of the room, the space has doubled, and the host and guest are clearly distinguished. The combination of bean paste green and oak brown is quite warm and low-key. The most outstanding thing is the bathroom suite. The bathroom is oversized. The fly in the oin**ent is that the bathtub is relatively small. The Thai food on the first floor was limited due to the epidemic and was too popular to enjoy the outdoor dining experience at night, so I experienced lunch. Except for the fried shrimp cakes, which needs to be improved, other hot dishes such as pan-fried scallops and soft-shell crabs are not bad. Thai food that can be brushed twice.
The pool size is quite high and there are few people. It is said that it will open next week, so there is no chance to experience it. Nearby is the Taikoo Hui shopping mall, and a little further is the Nanxi business district. The whole is suitable for young people, low-key and stylish.

msg:1. Didn’t tell Nut that there is a fee, and it says that the first round of use is free, but it seems that they deliberately didn’t inform Nut that there is a fee, and the money will be deducted inexplicably after leaving the store. 2. In addition, the parking lot is not free, 100 yuan per night. The first time you stay in a hotel of this level, you need to charge a parking fee. The last time you stayed in the same parking lot next door, it was free. 3. Our family of three went to the Thai food restaurant at 6.30 in the evening. We were told that the reservation was full, but the restaurant's occupancy rate should be about 30% at that time. Even if it is really fully booked, does the restaurant not consider the rate of changing tables under the current occupancy rate? Management is very problematic. And asked us to make a reservation at noon the next day (to increase the attendance at noon the next day? Confused), we refused and went to Taikoo Li for dinner. 4. The breakfast is also very ordinary, even rough, basically no different from the Hampton by Hilton where I stayed on a business trip a few weekdays ago. There is also a problem with the service awareness. The attendant didn't ask whether he wanted coffee or tea. 5. It does not meet the standards of SLH at all. I think it belongs to the hotel at this price that must be protected from lightning.

msg:This time I received a friend from Suzhou. I chose this hotel because I arranged to have dinner at Taikoo Hui Jade Garden in the evening. The whole process left me with a dull face and all kinds of embarrassment. It was almost four o'clock when we checked in. The front desk told us that we were cleaning. If we wanted to wait 20 minutes or upgrade the room type, we were asked to make up another 400 yuan difference. My friend was anxious to check in and was going to add money. After the objection, the manager next to her said that she went to the ward and checked in in three minutes, and the room was still available. This kind of sales method gives people a bad feeling, like robbery, hoping that you will stay in a higher-priced room. If this is the case in other hotels, because of the hotel's reasons, the hotel will take the initiative to upgrade the room for you for free. Finally, I would like to thank the duty manager, she is still great and took the initiative to solve the problem.

The front desk staff is very unskilled in business and did not take the initiative to ask the guest for contact information to facilitate the notification of when they can check in. I didn't feel the sincerity of the hotel room for the inconvenience caused by the delayed check-in. Very unpleasant stay experience.
2. We did not inform the guests immediately when we left things after check-out
3. Other room services and equipment can only be said to be at the same level as hotels of the same level.
In short, I will not consider staying again in the future.

Whether it is the friendly attitude and warm service of the hotel staff, or the cleanliness of the room, they maintain a high level. Miss Yuan, the beautiful long-haired girl at the front desk, learned that I was nervous to catch the plane and specially helped me to consult the time required for the Pudong customs security check and wrote a card to let me rest in peace, which was very caring. When I set out alone, I was taken care of so warmly and felt that I was lucky to meet the hotel staff who were so nice, thank them! There is also the magic of Sukhothai's bed, it is decided not to suffer from insomnia, and the mattress and pillows are also very good! Of course, the sound insulation is also very good and it is easy to fall asleep. Anyway, I just want to sleep every time I stay.

I arrived at the hotel first, and the little brother at the front desk was very thoughtful and introduced various things. After waiting for my boyfriend to come up, I accidentally said to the front desk that today is our 1,000th anniversary, and it didn't take long for me to receive the macarons and blessing cards from the hotel, and I was touched all of a sudden! (I still don't understand the signed name haha) Then because of the epidemic and the weather, I ordered the hotel's meals, and I strongly recommend the fried beef fillet with curry! Invincible delicious! Then when we checked out the next day, the hotel manager who sent the card yesterday came over and told us that if there is a festival next time, we can tell them in advance, and he will help with the arrangement, which is really warm! The fly in the oin**ent is this parking problem, I hope to communicate with the mall haha.

Because of YQ, it was inconvenient to travel far, so I found a hotel to change the environment to meet with friends. The hotel was informed in advance that it was going to be a birthday, so the hotel was very kind to welcome it, prepared cakes and handwritten birthday cards, and also arranged small birthday decorations. The location is excellent, you can go shopping in Taikoo Hui if you have nothing to do, you can also go to citysuper to buy a lot of snacks to take back to your room to eat. There is a wide variety of takeaways, and Crest Garden is also great. Overall room style and hotel services are satisfactory. You can get paradise-like relaxation here without the need to travel to the resort. At the end of the check-out, the front desk gave a small gift. The whole experience was great! Looking forward to opening the restaurant and spa after daily recovery.

However, Thai hotel groups are far behind the surrounding international hotel brands of the same level in terms of standardization. Hardware: Neri&hu's room design does not take comfort into consideration, the lighting design has no layers, the reading light is like an overhead searchlight, the twinbed is only equipped with a washbasin, and there is only one plug at the head of the bed, and the privacy of the double room is poor. In order to save money, there is cement in the corner for hard decoration. Please focus on the sense of design while learning the humanization and standardization of large groups. Otherwise, the house price will not match Germany.
Service: very average, the marketing has an attitude of looking at the venue, have you not been trained?
Breakfast: There are few types, ordinary quality, and no special features. Where is the soul of Thai brands?

Service: There was only one bathrobe in the room, so I called and asked to send one. When we left, we put all two bathrobes there. As a result, the front desk called one by one to ask why there were no bathrobes, saying that there should be two in the room. If I give you one piece, it's three pieces. It's strange that the two of us live in the third bathrobe for the ghost to wear? It's hard to figure out that there is not even an apology.

Is it because of yq that the service quality generally declines? The key price hasn't dropped much.

msg:The city center of the magic city ~ a luxury hotel adjacent to Xingye Taikoo Hui, the commercial center of Nanjing Road [Shanghai Sukhothai Hotel] is a modern design style hotel integrating Thai hospitality, creating a warm "home away from home" for us! The design of the hotel uses a lot of natural materials such as brass, wood and terrazzo, giving people a sense of fashion in a contemporary city without losing the classical oriental style. The deep and light green embellishments, like gray and wood tones, are consistent with people's moving lines and echo each other.

This time I stayed in the "Deluxe King Room". One of the favorite features of the room type is the "Floating Island Bed Collapse" design!

As an all-day dining restaurant on the 1F of the hotel [URBAN Café], it mainly focuses on Southeast Asian cuisine, and the dining environment is fresh and simple in Thai design style. There are too many people in the lunch market, so I chose to order food in the guest room. The service is excellent! The taste is also remarkable!

The package I ordered did not include breakfast, but because it was too late for a business trip the next morning, I purchased additional breakfast directly at the hotel. The price for 2 people is 500+. I can only control the cost. The breakfast provided by Sukhothai Hotel is not as good as that of ordinary three-star hotels. The quality and variety of breakfast are very poor. When I used to stay, there was an à la carte set menu for breakfast, but now it doesn't. As a SLH affiliate hotel this is one of the worst breakfasts I've been to. I also responded to the front desk when I checked out, and the front desk said that they would upgrade me when I came back next time. Goodbye, next time I should go to a middle house.

There is an air purifier at the door, which is said to be able to inactivate 99% of the new crown. There is also a small yoga room next to it. The swimming pool is half a floor lower than the gym, but the environment is spacious enough and there are not many people, which is very suitable for people who like quiet.

msg:The only hotel in Shanghai (maybe in China) that I keep coming back to because of its excellent service (of course, I don’t mean that the hardware is bad. I personally think that the suite design and space utilization even surpass the large flat of Aman in Minhang, but it’s not my turn to comment on the hotel hardware, which is a matter of competing with the developer and who has money). In terms of location, hotel interior, reasonable price and comfort, it is absolutely cost-effective.
My home community was sealed off, and after returning from Beijing, I was faced with the situation of not being able to return home again... So I came to the previous +7 Hotel Sukhothai again, and every aspect of the service can surpass the group hotel. During the two stays, I would like to thank MOD Cameron/Steven/Angela, and Fang Yahao of the housekeeping department, especially Cameron’s thoughtful arrangements, so that I can eat, drink and rest well, and feel the warmth of home every time here!
In addition, I saw someone criticize the hotel amenities, but I think that although the hotel amenities are not luxurious, they are very unique and I personally like them very much.
I stayed for eight nights but didn't have a chance to try the hotel breakfast (probably because I had enough in the mini bar). I couldn't eat it the first time because of quarantine and the second time because I had a meeting at 9 o'clock. It's not for working people, but my husband said it was very good last time. I must eat it next time I stay! I look forward to staying at the Sukhothai Hotel next time! (Although I hope that the next time I come back is not because of the epidemic)
The only suggestion is that I hope the hotel can sell Thai spice tea to the public. I hope the boss will see me see me

msg:Very well-designed hotel, every corner is a wonderful picture! A Himalayan salt crystal lamp in the room attracted me, very chic, and the natural crystals also have the function of purifying the air. The bottled water is all Italian brands, toiletries, I checked online, it is a niche brand in Australia, and it insists on 100% natural plant extraction (I like the taste of sage very much). There are not many people in the swimming pool. The 25-meter swimming lane is clean and the water temperature is suitable. It is very refreshing to swim for half an hour. I strolled around the hotel, went to Taikoo Hui, and visited Harvest Village, which was rebuilt from old buildings in Tianzifang style. The places around the hotel are very unique! A very satisfying stay experience!

There is also an aunt making sleep tea at night, the service is very good 🙏🏽🙌🏽

msg:Because of the seriousness of Nanjing West Road Street, I was able to enjoy an extra 0.5 days of quarantine time, and I was able to record this piece of "To 24* (7+0.5) Hotel Quarantine Time" written for gratitude before the end of the trip.

As the focus of the whole article, I would like to express my gratitude to Sukhothai Hotel, especially the wholehearted assistance and professional and enthusiastic service of Cameron, Clark and other excellent staff who moved me very much, and I would like to express my gratitude here.

On the 12th day of the entry quarantine, due to the change of the epidemic prevention policy and the laziness and indifference of a certain street in Hongkou District (I will not name and criticize a certain street community here), it is difficult for me to return home. When I called every hotel in a hopeless mood, but was rejected one by one, it was Sukhothai Hotel who accepted me with kindness and love. Cameron, the lobby manager, and Clark, the concierge, overcame all difficulties and coordinated the epidemic prevention and isolation depar**ent and After arranging vehicles and arranging protective equipment, I was finally able to successfully check into the hotel.

The hotel is located in the Taikoo Hui, the landmark of Shanghai, with an excellent geographical location, high-end and practical room facilities, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the bustling city, large beds and beddings are warm and comfortable, bathrooms are spacious, and the writing desk is super capable of storing things. Hahaha, the joy is beyond words. The rooms provide minibar drinks, capsule coffee, tea bags, etc. Even the mineral water is the Italian brand DOLOMIA.
The room service was meticulous, which made me feel a little distressed by the waiter who delivered me takeaways. Yes, indeed, I ordered too many orders. . . . Ha ha. Since I can't go out, I have to rely on the hotel to provide support and care for all my needs. I have disturbed the hotel service staff too much in these seven days, and I need to express my thanks again.

The Sukhothai Hotel is worthy of a business card in Shanghai in terms of hardware quality and service level. Cameron and Clark, a group of employees who are enthusiastic and caring for their work, are undoubtedly the pillars that support this business card.

We are about to part for a short time, we will regret it for a while, see you in the future!

Thank you to all the staff at Sukhothai for their care and service.

1. The interior is very design and the experience is very good.
2. The quality of indoor products is also very good and texture, but I don't like to use non-disposable shower shampoo in the name of environmental protection, and it still feels unhygienic.
3. The staff feels not very enthusiastic, which is a big problem.
4. I like Sukhothai’s room card very much. It has a sense of design. It would be nice if it could be made into a small gift for the guests.
In summary, it is still very recommended, which meets the standards of a hotel at this price, but I still hope that the hotel staff can be more enthusiastic.

First: I can't get a taxi at ten o'clock in the evening, so I will go downstairs to see if my little brother downstairs can help. People say he can't call, so I waited on the phone. Then he didn't mean to call me.
Second, at 9 o'clock in the morning, someone knocked on the door of the room desperately. After a long, long knock, they got up from the room and answered the door desperately, saying that they were taking their body temperature, and then I called the front desk to complain. The feedback I got at noon was that a guest next to me asked for a thermometer and knocked on the wrong door. I'm sorry that there will be no more after one sentence.

msg:I rarely give bad reviews to hotels but this time I couldn't help it. Let's list the problems of this "Golden Diamond" hotel for 2000 a night
1. When I checked in, the front desk receptionist was very unprofessional. It was already a little later and told me that my room was not ready. If I want to check in now, I have to add money to upgrade the room type. Because I was in a hurry to go to Taikoo Hui next to me to have dinner with friends, I only had to add money to upgrade.
2. The kettle in the room is broken......
3. The most unbearable The door of the closet in the room is broken...  
If you can't close the door, the lights will stay on all the time. Find a master to fix it at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night.
The master was very embarrassed. The door could not be repaired for a while. He had to turn off the power supply of the lights inside. The master kept apologizing. The staff at the front desk didn't have any embarrassed attitude at all, it was quite reasonable
4. When I checked out the next day, the front desk was the same as nothing. I couldn't help complaining about the check-in problem. The best part is here.
The staff said very nonchalantly:
Oh, do you need our manager to give you a call? (original words, not a word changed)
And it's a very accommodating tone...

I:? ? ? excuse me Is there something wrong with your brain or is there something wrong with my brain? ?

To be honest, the service facilities of Sukhothai in Shanghai are not worth his price at all.
The whole team is really disgraceful to the hotel brand
Shame on such a good location
At the same price, I live in MO, isn't it fragrant...

말이 안통하는 타 호텔에 묵다가 옮기니 천국이었습니다..

상해에서 영어로 소통하는 곳은 거의 처음 이었습니다 ㅠㅠ

웰컴티와 푸르츠가 준비되어있고, 외출하고 나갔다오니
가지런히 정리된 룸에서 조용환 환대를 느끼다 갑니다

조식은 신청을 안했지만, 피트니스, 수영장 모두 좋았고
시설 직원들도 친절했고 럭셔리 쇼핑몰인 상하이 탕과 붙어있고 근처에 스타벅스 리저브, 
상해의 작은 유럽이라는 장원도 도보로 이동가능 (블루보틀,디올팝업,브런치 카페 등등 있음) 
난징서루역 도보로 10분이내 -＞ 가는길에 쇼핑몰과 식당 등 있음

상해에 온다면 꼭 추천하는 숙소입니다!
스몰럭셔리가 맞습니다.. 

마지막 체크아웃하는날도 오전에 잠시 나갈 일이 있어
청소 부탁했는데 수건같은것도 새로 갈아주셨고요!
네스프레소도 다시 채워져있었고 

상해에 저렴한 숙소가 많아 좀 가격대가 잇지만
여러모로 상해에 간다면 1박이라도 또 가고 싶은 숙소입니다.

2.開門會直見床，無玄關屏風。電視拉出來的角度沒法正對床，需坐在對面椅子上，浴室水龍頭與蓮蓬頭相聚非常遠~~~空間動線安排妙不可言😅家具風格丹麥，高雅舒適簡潔♥️
3.早餐選擇精而小，生菜沙拉品質微妙，泰餐口味也微妙😅，西餐bar的下酒炸物漢堡很不錯♥️
4.旁邊有太古匯商場~方便購物用餐~
5.健身房非常棒💪💪💪空間大，器具足，設備完善精良💪應有盡有🌟🌟🌟有划船機喔喔~~~

但崩潰的是隔壁房間晚上“炒菜”聲音實在太大，而且伴隨哭聲叫聲，幾乎讓我們想報警。住1600一晚的房間不至於這樣“物盡其用”吧？遂打電話兩次叫服務前去查看，早上還是叫聲連連，非常崩潰。出於對當事人的保護不放視頻了，但希望酒店加大對於這種嚴重影響別人睡眠的客人的幹涉。

去情侶酒店，不好嗎？

設施：電梯的鏡子很別緻，房卡是NFC的，洗護用品很好。晚上有安神茶，茶具簡約好用。礦泉水是意大利進口的。蕎麥枕舒服。
服務：門僮服務到位，行李一直送到房間。出入酒店門以及上下車門，都主動熱情打招呼，開門。前台服務耐心，保持微信，入住和退房速度很快。有需要打電話到前台，服務阿姨馬上對應。必須感謝一下客房部倆位阿姨，賓至如歸的服務。
衞生：房間打掃很乾凈，浴巾床品很舒服。牙刷是木質柄，看着就環保。吹風機是松下的，如果能是戴森的就更好了🙂
建議：早餐再豐富些就更完美了。

msg:每次到上海都會住，服務和環境一如既往的好。尤其是前台的服務非常好。
但是這次唯獨對游泳池的管理很不滿意：
1.在進入泳池後，泳池的工作人員或救生人員（男）在進泳池時上下打量女客人。期間拿着手機對着泳池，不確定是否有偷拍，或者衹是作為救生人員在玩手機。
2.其他的男性工作人員在進入泳池的時候也一直盯着女客人游泳（包括男試衣間的工作人員和泳池維護人員）。
作為住客，以上所述行為感到非常冒犯和騷擾。這種不禮貌的行為更不應該是作為工作人員該有的工作表現。回房間之後立刻電話反饋了這個情況，酒店也表示會提問spa部門經理，但是沒有收到任何後續反饋。希望這個問題可以得到嚴肅處理。

這次升了角落裡的特級大床房，算是把（除了總統套房以外的）所有房型都住過了。特級房因為在角落裡，不是很方正，床上能看到一點鏡子，但相應view也不會被SMG大樓擋住、也算還行。

客房是完美的，前台禮賓客房urban la scala的所有員工都無懈可擊。就是早餐真的一如既往地不行…你們什麼時候能把早餐做好點吶。西點還行，但中式真是挺莫名其妙的…跟隔壁cafe grey學學撒？

環境：緊靠太古滙和墉舍。酒店內整體偏暗，比較有設計感，是我們喜歡的風格，酒店內的酒吧和户外的酒吧都比較有特色，如果週末店內酒吧有駐唱就更好了，店外的音效稍顯嘈雜

服務：服務態度不錯，會主動詢問是否要開夜床

酒店令人印象深刻的非常泰國風格的設計，以及非常熱情和體貼的服務。入住時前台部門的sicily和joy一起為我們辦理了入住，效率非常高。得知我們是來過紀念日，給我們升級了房型，還贈送了紀念日的佈置。
無論是因為工作還是遊玩來到這裏，素凱泰酒店帶給您充足的空間來放鬆身心。房間內的天然材料、落地窗以及一覽無餘的城市景色共同營造出一種寧靜的氛圍。
酒店的室內游泳是魔都最漂亮的泳池之一了。水療護理項目則是有滿滿的泰式風格，一秒鐘去泰國的感覺。
南京西路上的設計師精品店，值得推薦。

酒店很有設計感；
晚上隔壁房間關門聲大到可以直接讓你醒過來，還有人在樓道里叫喊……；
最後談一下服務，的確就像很多網友點評説的，這個酒店的服務就是沒有服務。辦入住和你強調迷你吧什麼收費什麼免費，項目很多沒搞清楚多問一遍，就給你看臉色；申請晚一小時退房，就是不肯，和主管申請了，也就給了半小時，感覺自己像在討飯，算了提前走就是了。

辦理入住的員工很專業，整個流程十分快，特別表揚門口的禮賓小哥，在退房時看到我在排隊，主動上前詢問行李是否需要寄存，幫我處理完後，轉頭又忙別的事情了，短暫的時間裏可以很好的服務多位客人。

美中不足的是屋裡沒有藍牙音響，衹能投屏電視用電視音響。

素凱泰在太古滙繁華地段，逛街吃飯衹需要1分鐘走過去。見朋友衹需要在樓下的urban cafe都不用出門。
員工服務到位又恰恰好的舒適感。房間水龍頭水大舒適，軟飲隨意拿取。因為天氣熱，即使什麼都不幹看看電視也是蠻開心的。
推薦給不想熱鬧，不要嘈雜，但是想方便又喜歡吃泰國菜的朋友。

客房屬於冷淡風格的裝修，基礎房型的空間還是可以的，衞浴設備不錯，浴缸舒服。因為晚上做了SPA，犯懶沒有到外面覓食，叫了客房送餐的服務，品嚐了泰式炒裸條和冬陰功湯，味道還真不錯，沒有愧對泰式酒店的頭銜。迷你吧的軟飲都是免費的，如果小食也一併免費那就好了，其實也沒增加多少成本，能給客人帶來更好的體驗、給酒店贏來口碑豈不更好？

本次住一晚，和朋友吃飯完回酒店，竟然沒有給房間收拾打掃。以為是保潔根本沒來，但是發現垃圾桶的一些紙屑被拿走，證明來過，但是也僅是拿走了垃圾桶的紙屑，其他什麼都沒有打掃，曾經會放在床頭的花草茶當然也更沒有提供。這種服務品質的下滑真是很讓人失望。另外，現在除了兩瓶voss礦泉水免費提供外，也沒有額外的免費水再提供。很奇怪的操作。

In room dining service 음식도 맛없음.
하다 못해 바에 칵테일도 맛 없음.
어떻게 음식이랑 관련된 건 이렇게 하나같이 별로인지 신기할 정도.
그 외에는 만족스러움
