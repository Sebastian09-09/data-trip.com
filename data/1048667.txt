msg:The hotel is close to the Simatai Great Wall. The environment is good. It faces the river and is quaint. It may be because of the off-season that it feels particularly quiet and even a bit "depressed".
The attitude of the staff is very good, but it is recommended that as a boutique hotel, the service can be more meticulous, such as providing a turndown service option.
Although the breakfast variety is not rich, I like that the set menus are prepared freshly after guests arrive at the restaurant.

msg:To be honest, I have been looking forward to this hotel. I have stayed at Gubei Water Town Hotel, Gubei Light Hotel, Gubei William Hotel, and Gubei Thirteen Sisters Hot Spring Hotel more than once. This time I wanted to try this Wuzhen Club, so I booked it for a family of three in the afternoon. Arrived at around 4 o'clock and checked into the hotel room. I felt warm when I entered the room. Maybe it was too cold outside. When I entered the room, the temperature of the central air conditioner in the room was 25 degrees. I adjusted the air conditioner to 30 degrees so that the children could be warmer when I came back from going out for a while. We went out to eat and hang out. After visiting the night view for about two hours, I came back and felt hot as soon as I entered the door because the hotel in Gubei where I stayed before was very hot and even required a meeting window to dissipate the heat. This hotel I ignored it because we changed clothes because it felt a little cold. I got into bed and took a breath, thinking that I might have just come back from going out, but the more I lay down, the colder I got. It was so cold that my upper and lower teeth were chattering. I got out of bed and looked at the air conditioner. It was set to the maximum wind speed and heat, but it was too cold. I didn’t dare to go into the cold bathroom without stepping on it. Even the non-slip mats on the toilet are so cold, not to mention the fact that the children dare not sit on them. We have to pour hot water on them before we dare to sit on them. I don’t believe it. You clean the hotel every day and can’t you find this problem? Wuzhen Club is a pretty good hotel in a scenic area. Don’t you have a sense of service? I called the front desk and the service staff told them that the heating system is just like this. There is no other way. I just want to say, your lobby is so hot that it makes you feel dizzy. The staff knows about heating. Do the guests have to stay upright while freezing? The staff told us that they could send us a heater and extra bed quilts for us. After a while, they sent us a small electric heater and placed it next to the bedside of me and the child. To be honest, it didn't have much effect. The air conditioner➕electric heater kept us awake at night. I slept extremely dry and my throat was very uncomfortable in the morning. I can only say that you should be cautious if you want to go to this hotel in winter. We are very disappointed with this hotel and we will not book it next time. The only saving grace is that the Chinese breakfast is good. There is no other redeeming feature. place.

The room is big enough, and there seems to be a small yard on the first floor, but we didn't go out to play. There is a problem with the TV speaker. Sometimes it makes a squeaking sound, which is very loud. It is recommended that it be checked. The restaurant is a bit trendy, the Chinese food tastes good, the breakfast is rich, both Chinese and Western, and there is a buffet area, the white porridge is great, and the service is also good. There are no autumn leaves in this season, and the lake is not frozen. It is the off-season, and there are very few people in the scenic area. However, the house price is not cheap, and it feels a bit inflated.

msg:On the second day of visiting the water town, in order to experience the water town style, I moved from Gubei Light to Wuzhenhui. The advantages and features of Wuzhen Club are the Chinese-style decoration, larger rooms, balcony water views (Pictures 1-3) and the Jiangnan garden-style hotel garden (Picture 4). The hotel can take the Shuizhen Scenic Area shuttle bus to Riyuedao Station, get off and walk for 3 minutes. The corresponding service of Jingjiu has been mentioned in my previous review of Gubei Light. Here I will mainly talk about the reasons why Wuzhen Club was not given full marks:

1. The hotel Wi-Fi signal is poor, the connection is often disconnected, and the connection speed is also very slow. Gubei Light also has this problem.
2. I am used to drinking a bottle of electrolyte drink or sports drink after returning from playing in the evening, but there are no stores or vending machines in the hotel. If you want to buy something, you have to leave the hotel and go to the grocery store in the scenic area, which is very inconvenient.
3. Breakfast problem. When we received our room card in the hotel lobby, the front desk staff took the initiative to inform us that the breakfast for the next day was a set meal, and enthusiastically and thoughtfully suggested choosing one Chinese and Western style, and you could order whichever one you like. At breakfast the next day (Figure 7-9), we discovered that the hotel restaurant actually had a buffet area, and we could use the coffee machine above. We ate from about 7:30 to 9:00. During this 90-minute meal time, we found that except for our family, no other guests came to the breakfast room to eat. At this moment, I seemed to understand why the hotel did not provide a buffet but a set meal... Although the restaurant staff enthusiastically took the initiative to serve a lot of fruits, there is no doubt that for a buffet, guests can actively choose instead of passively accepting a set meal.
4. In the hotel classification on the official website of Water Town, Wuzhen is classified as a boutique hotel, and Gubei Light is classified as a theme hotel; but in Ctrip's rating, Wuzhen is classified as a Golden Diamond Hotel, and Gubei Light is not. After staying at Gubei Light on the first night, I honestly had more expectations for Wuzhen. However, Wuzhen Club did not provide more services. They only put refreshments in the room around 5 p.m. (four pieces in Figure 5 cookies), and two bowls of white fungus soup were delivered to the room after dinner (Picture 6). If the hotel occupancy rate is not very high, can we spend more energy to find ways to let existing guests promote the hotel?

Overall evaluation of environmental sanitation is 5 and service facilities are 4. It is undeniable that every staff member in the hotel is professional and enthusiastic, and can make guests feel their good attitude. However, evaluation and feelings are very personal and subjective things. This stay experience did not fully respond to my personal expectations.

msg:I spent 2 pleasant nights at Wuzhenhui Boutique Hotel and really liked it! First of all, the location of the hotel is very ideal, located in the center of Gubei Water Town, very close to scenic spots and various famous attractions. Secondly, the service quality of the hotel is excellent. From check-in to check-out, the hotel staff were very friendly, welcoming and professional. They are always ready to help us solve problems and give us valuable advice and guidance. This kind of attentive service made us feel welcome and it was great!

The facilities of the hotel are also very complete, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the decoration is elegant, and the beds are soft and comfortable. The two nights I spent here had a great night's sleep and made me feel relaxed. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of convenient facilities, such as high-speed wireless network, TV, toiletries, etc., to make our stay more comfortable and convenient. Especially Xiao Song beauty's attentive and thoughtful service, here must be like 👍

The location of the hotel is very good, and the trip was really worthwhile. Xiao Song at the front desk was very nice and enthusiastic, responsive, and very patient in helping me arrange. He also provided a lot of help. Manager Song made people feel at home. I must like it. I am very satisfied with the service. The room is clean and comfortable.

In the old Zhaitang, summer is like spring.
The boats traveling from south to north go early,
Ducks and geese lined up freely.
The Wild Goose Inn is slightly drunk,
Yushe Hot Springs is fainting.
At night, a long dragon lies on the ridge,
Drone swarms are like clouds.
Water and fire blend and splash heavy colors,
The poolside is full of viewers.
The tall buildings in front of me are even more majestic,
I don't see the Qi family army back then.

The Wuzhenhui Boutique Hotel fits the bill perfectly - the quaint decor is spot on. Not only that, Wuzhenhui Hotel is clean and hygienic, with considerate service, especially Xiaojiao, who saw that we are a family of three, offered to add a free breakfast for us. If there are any deficiencies, it may be that the hotel restaurant closes too early (maybe we checked in on a Monday, and it is not summer, and the restaurants in the town close very early, everyone should pay attention).

msg:Satisfied as always. I come here once a year. Every time I come, firstly, because the service is good, secondly, because the food is delicious, and thirdly, because I like the style of the room, especially because I can sit on the balcony and watch the water and tourists, and at the same time, it is not so noisy. The child's feet are worn out, the hotel provides iodophor band-aids, and the caring care makes people feel comfortable. Milk tremella soup every night, and cookies and fruits in the afternoon are very suitable for bringing children. I like the food at Wentian Pavilion very much. Some people say it is expensive, but I think the dining environment and the dishes in the scenic area are in line with the price positioning. The child is more than three years old, and the food is delicious, especially the service fee is not charged for the food delivered to the room, which is very good. Before leaving, the lady at the front desk saw that the child was injured and did not wear shoes, so she gave her some slippers. The child was very happy, and praised her sister and the slippers all the way back. In short, I like this hotel very much ~ the location is also very good, it is convenient to see fountains and drones, and to take a boat.

On my first trip to Beijing, I was a little nervous because there wasn't much information about this hotel or reviews written by Koreans. It felt like a traditional Beijing house right from the entrance, which was great. Friendly staff who greeted me as I went, comfortable rooms, delicious breakfast, and free breakfast. I had an enjoyable trip to Gobuksujin thanks to the upgrade. Thank you very much for helping me make bus reservations on the way back to downtown Beijing. ^_^ I hope you continue to prosper! I'm also very curious about the summer in Gobuksujin. Next time I go, I definitely want to stay at this hotel☺️

The location is very good, in the middle of the scenic area, an independent piece of land that is quiet amidst the noise. The room is big enough and the facilities are well maintained. I really like the quaint a**osphere of the lobby. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but they are exquisite and have everything you need. The combination of table d'hote and buffet is very comfortable. The customer service is very good, no matter the concierge at the front desk of the hotel or the waiter in the restaurant, they all feel at home. Special thanks to the little brother Ji Yingjie at the front desk. We found out that we missed our luggage when we left the scenic spot. We called the hotel. After ten minutes, Xiao Ji took the shuttle bus to escort us to the parking lot in person, which saved us a lot of trouble. I feel that the hotel's implementation It is higher than many other five-star hotels in China. The recommendation index is five stars.

There are tea rooms, book bars, and courtyards. The whole hotel is backed by mountains and faces the river. It should be very beautiful if it is spring, summer and autumn. It's a pity that the two days of staying happened to be the coldest time, so I couldn't enjoy it.
The hotel room is very big, with a family of three with a teenage child staying, it doesn’t feel crowded. The room has a 2.2-meter large bed and an Arhat bed. The hotel took the initiative to add a quilt to the Arhat bed. Very comfortable. I also took the initiative to send fruit and a gift bag for the Chinese New Year, and tremella soup was delivered at night. The overall service experience is great.
The hotel has its own restaurant, Wenchang Pavilion, which provides breakfast and dinner services. The breakfast is very rich, and the main meal is Jiangsu and Zhejiang cuisine.
In short, the hotel is good, and it should be more comfortable and comfortable if you have the opportunity to come in summer.

msg:I have been to Gubei Water Town many times, and I have been paying attention to the hotels with family rooms because I have two children. This time, the hotels I know are all fully booked and I have to squeeze it out. When I came here, I found that there is a "couch" that can be used. oh! Note, this is an under-appreciated secret. The room facilities are good. There are many places to put things, which is very convenient. The sound insulation of the room is also good. The only thing I am not satisfied with is that the room is dark. Although there are more than ten lights (not an exaggeration), none of them are bright enough. Maybe this is the reason. The hotel's deliberate a**osphere (cozy)? But isn't it good to give customers more choices? I choose to be brighter when I need it!

msg:I struggled for a long time when I booked the hotel, and finally chose the Chinese-style, quiet and quiet Wuzhen Club boutique. I finally felt very good. I asked for three rooms next to the second floor. In a similar city tower, the space is large, but it is inconvenient to see the river view. If you mind, you can choose carefully. The front of the hotel is not conspicuous, but the interior is very characteristic and antique. It is suitable for taking the elders at home. The hotel has Welcome fruit and simple afternoon tea, as well as tremella soup in the evening, fruit and tremella soup are very satisfying, especially tremella soup, we came back immediately after the hot spring, just right for a late night snack, afternoon tea has no other comments before I was a little disappointed in the exquisite little cakes that appeared in the room. The cookies sent out tasted average. I didn’t finish eating them. The sound insulation was very good. The room was facing the street but it was very quiet. The scene is vivid in my mind, and it feels very warm. When I checked out, I checked the luggage under the guidance of the front desk, and the luggage was sent directly to the No. 1 parking lot. We can play with peace of mind and go home in the afternoon. Very satisfied, next time I have the opportunity to go back, it is not far from the main hot springs, and it is convenient to eat. Recommended!

Double Hot Spring Experience Voucher: We made an appoin**ent at around 3:00 pm. The Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion closest to the hotel was almost full, so we could only make an appoin**ent with the Duan Family Courtyard, which was far away. Not far, very close to the hotel, there are indoor and outdoor hot springs, indoors are separated for men and women, outdoor is together, there are not many people when I go, it is almost nine o'clock when I come out, it may be in the peak period, there are many people a little
Breakfast: a little simpler for a five-star hotel, but fortunately refined and tastes good, fried dough sticks, fried eggs, soup, and noodles can be prepared in the kitchen immediately if needed

The service is particularly good, and the lobby manager is very caring. Two elderly people lived together. One of them was a vegetarian. When he arrived on the first morning, he asked whether the stuffing of the buns was vegetarian. During the simple conversation, the restaurant manager took it seriously and helped prepare it the next morning. There is a drawer of vegetarian steamed buns, and a vegetarian dish is specially fried. The taste of the dish is very good, and the service is even better.

As a result, there might be some problems in the communication with Ctrip and the hotel in the early stage, so the hotel reserved a room on the first floor. I thought the first floor would be noisy, but the actual experience of the first floor room is also very quiet. The elderly and children are very satisfied. Tremella soup and snacks are also delivered every day, which is very considerate, and every service staff is very enthusiastic. Since we didn't check in our luggage when we left, the hotel staff also helped us deliver our luggage to the ferry station and loaded us into the car. Thank you very much, very satisfied, will stay here next time! !

During the 11th holiday, the price of Wuzhen Club is really expensive [puzzling], but the service and hotel facilities are still good. The little brother at the front desk knew that my mother had a birthday and brought a birthday cake in the evening. Although it was not big, it felt very warm. The deluxe double bed room is ordered. There are three rooms next to each other, 209, 210, and 211. Each room has a balcony with a view. You can drink tea and watch the scenery on the balcony. The balcony of room 210 is just on the upper floor of the hotel gatehouse. An empty field with several large reclining chairs, the only downside is that the parapet is very high, and the river view below cannot be seen. The big bed in the room is 2 meters long, and a quilt can be added to the tatami for children to sleep in, even with two babies.

Once again, the environment is also good, the river view room can see the Great Wall and the river, the scenery is good, and it is good to have something to eat on the balcony at night. Not to mention, the hotel does not have any facilities other than rooms and restaurants. There are no hot springs, swimming pools, or children's playgrounds. You have to push the cart through the extremely difficult stone road. It is very troublesome to go back and forth, and it is really inconvenient for families with small children. . But better than the hotel's scenery and service, it is recommended to stay! Especially suitable for couples and the elderly.

The hotel is very clean, the breakfast ingredients are fresh, the taste is good, and the dining environment is good. I have a little regret. Originally, I wanted to arrange the 3 rooms on the 2nd floor, but Ctrip did not send the remarks to the hotel, and the customer service center was automatically assigned to the 1st floor when checking in. The room was full that day, and the front desk manager was very dedicated to changing a room, thank you. The deluxe room is close to the river and has a balcony. On the 2nd floor, a room with a smaller room number is recommended. It has a good view. River, balcony see picture. Overall very satisfied, 5 points praise!

msg:[Candy] I grabbed the tail of the summer vacation and checked in at the Wuzhen Club Boutique Hotel. It was the first time I chose to stay in a hotel in the scenic area because I was always worried about the inconvenience with my 3-year-old children. It is difficult to book and ridiculously expensive. The price of an ordinary room in the Gubei Hotel at the entrance of the scenic spot is over 10,000 yuan. I have stayed twice before, so I think this price is not worth it at all! I booked this by mistake, I didn't expect anything after I checked in and found some small surprises [naughty]
[Diamond] Check-in needs to know the following process in advance: Parking at the P1 parking lot, there is a luggage service at the entrance of the parking lot, you can send your luggage to the hotel, take the battery car of the scenic spot to check in at the entrance hall of the scenic spot after checking in, and go to the ticket gate after check-in. Enter the face recognition ticket, and enter and leave the scenic spot for free during the stay~
[Refueling] You can walk to the hotel when you enter the scenic spot, or you can choose a battery car to arrive. The location is easy to find. Next to the food street, the bridge that sells bridgehead cakes arrives along the sign. The appearance of the hotel is a bit shabby, but after entering, there is nothing special. Delicate and orderly breakfast
[Planting grass] I booked a luxury suite. The room area is about 115 square meters. It is more spacious with children. The room is on two floors. You need to pay special attention to safety up and down the wooden stairs. [Smile]
[Withered] The shortcomings of the hotel are that the hygiene needs to be improved, the table and the corner of the room are not cleaned, there are hairs on the bath towel, the blower is very small and difficult to use ~ the sound insulation is very poor, the bear child next door is noisy going up and down the stairs, and the movement very big
In general, as a high-end hotel in a scenic spot, the price/performance ratio of the summer vacation has been OK [naughty] It is worth recommending

The room this time is two floors up and down, and each floor is large enough. Surprisingly, there are pantry, toilet and balcony on both floors, which is very comfortable. The hotel's buffet breakfast is also good. Although there are not many varieties, it tastes very good. The coffee and duck blood vermicelli soup are excellent. The taste of "Chopped Pepper Fish Head" in the hotel restaurant is also very authentic. The study room in the hotel is very distinctive. There are not many books, but the environment is quiet and the lighting is soft, which is very suitable for reading books in leisure time. The location of the hotel is on the side of the snack street, which is not noisy and convenient for dining. Walking out of the hotel, passing the "Little Bridge and Flowing Water" on the left is the Snack Street, and climbing a section of green steps on the right is the "Great Wall Theater". The hotel is not far from the swimming pool of "Gubei Zhiguang", and it is very convenient to take children to play in the water. This trip was originally planned to go to the Great Wall during the day, but after listening to the suggestion of the hotel front desk staff, it was changed to a night tour of the Great Wall. Sitting on the Great Wall and watching the sunset, with the night falling, seeing the whole water town gradually light up the lights, it is really a little romantic, and the children like it very much. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the hotel staff for their care. I heard that the children had birthdays, and they specially sent cakes and white fungus soup. The children were both surprised and happy, thank you very much.

The stay experience is clean and comfortable, not a parent-child hotel, so it is relatively quiet and not noisy. Located at one end of the lively food street, it is also where most of the reviews say "quiet in the middle of the noise". The room was clean, no mosquitoes, the bed was great, a good night's sleep. On my birthday, I went back to my room in the evening and saw the surprise cake that was delivered. Thank you for the caring of the scenic spot. I also liked the hot spring coupons that were given, and I had a relaxing time. Do you think the hotel is currently closed? There is no courtyard pond, which is smaller than expected. The book bar space is sometimes not really open during the day, and the lights and air conditioners are not turned on. It feels that there is too little leisure space in the hotel.

A small suggestion, the carpet in front of the Luohan bed is recommended to be anti-slip. This time I drink tea and have breakfast there. The carpet slides many times, which feels like a safety hazard.

The room is also relatively large, with a tatami mat, and a small courtyard when the door is opened. It is very pleasant to drink tea in summer~ I gave you fruits, snacks and white fungus and red dates soup, which is very considerate. There is also a reading room in the hotel. There are quite a lot of books in it, and there are also many children. You can read them when you have enough time. The handsome customer service guy, Shang, has a very meticulous and considerate service. When he first arrived, he helped with the luggage. He enthusiastically told the hot spring reservation, and answered questions about the surrounding attractions. Every time we meet, we greet each other warmly, which makes people feel warm. The hotel is relatively close to Simatai Great Wall, about a 10-minute walk, and it is also very close to Snack Street and Wangjing Street. It is very convenient to eat, drink and play. In short, it feels good to stay, and I will make an appoin**ent next time I come to Gubei~

The room is large with complete facilities. Washing and free mineral water are replenished in time (eight bottles of Nongfu Spring is enough every day, if you don't choose a brand), the attitude of the service staff is good, the only flaw is that the bathroom on the first floor smells of sewer, and the bathroom on the second floor is completely no.

msg:Going to Gubei Water Town to this hotel, the result is very surprising~
The hotel is a bit disappointing~
Gubei Water Town is full of surprises~ I know that this tourist town has been popular for many years, but I didn't expect that the services in the town during the Chinese New Year are also excellent~ It really adds a lot to this stay. ~
The service of this Wuzhen Hui Hotel is really average. I have used the hotel towels and I have allergies. The air conditioning system is not very smart. , but really...every snack spot is a long queue~~~~
Let's talk about the town, it's really mature. For me, a southerner, because I grew up beside various water towns since I was a child, I didn't have much interest in this kind of water town in the north at the beginning. Expected; but when walking to the visitor center it felt like you were in the right place!
First of all, there is a pet boarding center in the town in front of the tourist service center! And it's free! What a surprise~ The conditions are also good. On the last day, my husband took the pet away early in the morning. On the same day, the center also called back to see if your pet is normal, etc.~
Secondly, the restrooms in the town, in my husband's words, wherever I go, they are very clean and the amount of paper is sufficient~
Again, in the children's play hall here, the floor heating is very comfortable, and the ground is very clean and hygienic. The children have played all afternoon, and the socks are still very clean. I feel that this is very rare! !
Finally, during the Chinese New Year, whether it is early in the morning or in the afternoon, whether there are only three or five tourists or a bustling crowd, there will be staff to guide you at almost every intersection here-the shuttle bus, on the riverside, and on the bridge will have them. The figure and the attitude are very, very good~~ This makes us, who go out with children, feel the warmth~ The clerks of the restaurant and the commodity inspections selling gadgets are also very simple and enthusiastic~
The night before, the baby went to the Water Town Hotel for a swim. The water temperature in the big pool was 29 degrees, which was not cold at all. There were also two small pools with a slightly higher water temperature. There was also a parent-child shower room. It was rare to have such a thoughtful design.
Promise that the doll will bring her here in the future~ Yes, we will come to Water Town too! I will be staying at another hotel~
The attached photo is of Wuzhen Huijia's breakfast. There are not many varieties. The siomai is delicious, the fruit is still fresh, and the pickles are not bad~

After check-in, the shuttle bus goes to Sun Moon Square. After passing through the snack street, you will find the hotel. The room is very large and the service is special. Well, breakfast is a buffet. During the epidemic, the peak time is off. You need to make an appoin**ent to eat at the next time. There are not many things, but it is enough to meet the needs and the taste is also very good. There is a tea room and a book bar in the hotel, and there is free sour plum soup in the lobby. There are four bottles of Nongfu Spring. Although the drinks in the refrigerator are consumed, the price is reasonable, at least much cheaper than those sold in the scenic spot. The hotel is very convenient to go to every place in the scenic spot. After 9 o'clock in the evening in the scenic spot, there is nothing to eat except the late-night cafeteria, so you must plan early. The snack street does not open until 11 in the morning, and it is very convenient to check out. .

The hotel service is very good. There is a special person to contact one day in advance to inform the parking location. On the day of arrival, you will be greeted at the parking place, help with luggage check-in and check-in. The first time I came to Water Town, I felt so good. Thank you Barry! ! !

If you go to the hot springs, you must scan the code to make an appoin**ent. The front desk of the hotel will give you a ticket for the hot springs at the time of check-in. You can choose one of the two at present. As for the basketball facilities mentioned, they are located in the employee area of Shuizhen. Due to epidemic control, code scanning is required.

Clean, the coffee cups used before are all cleaned. And as soon as we entered the room, the waiter delivered white fungus soup, which was very considerate. Breakfast is also quite hearty, especially the freshly fried dough sticks.
The inadequacy has little to do with the hotel. The main reason is that there are too many children in the summer. Our room is on the first floor. It is estimated that there are two children living upstairs. They ran around and did not rest until after 11 o’clock in the evening, 7 in the morning. It started again after a few more points, it was a crash 😡

msg:A quiet location in the midst of the hustle and bustle, the hotel is just across the bridge from the food street. The face of the door is very low-key, and there is nothing special when you walk in.
The room is facing the river. When you check in, there is a fruit plate and cookies. When you come back from a stroll at night, you will find that there is also tremella soup. There was a temporary problem with the air conditioner in one room, and the room service was called to solve it. The hotel also has a huge reading hall, which feels very good. I wanted to sit and read a book at night, but I gave up when I came back too late.

我在入住期間不小心燙傷，傷口火辣辣的疼，去酒店前台試着問問看是否備有燙傷膏（長這麼大第一次燙傷，當時感覺很尷尬），也沒抱很大希望能有葯膏，但是王茹競美女依舊電話詢問客房工作人員，成功借到葯膏。原滿帥哥則跑了幾次幫我拿葯膏、湯匙，雖然當時客房工作人員建議加上冰敷更好，可我覺得有燙傷膏已經很滿足了，沒想過要冰敷，但過一會原滿居然真的送來了冰塊包叮囑我冰敷！真的超細心！！萬分感謝！！…由於處理的及時，我的傷口沒有像小紅書上其他姐妹燙傷那樣破皮化膿，完全沒有損傷，為細心耐心熱心的工作人員點贊！！
再説酒店情況，乾淨整潔，環境幽靜，早餐自助豐盛味道也不錯，下次去依舊住烏鎮會！！😄

방의 창문이 막혀 있어 답답한 느낌에, 방 교환을 요청했는데 흔쾌히 옮겨주었습니다. 아침에 테라스에서 밖을 내다 보는기 너무 좋았습니다. 게다가 호텔 조식과 套餐 저녁 메뉴까지 너무나 완벽했습니다.
호텔에 option으로 선택 된 저녁, 배타기, 차 체험 까지 모두 누리세요.
