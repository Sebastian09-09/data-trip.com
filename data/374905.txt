I stayed in an executive room, but I didn't get an upgrade or a minibar. Afternoon tea online says there are many varieties, but it turns out there are three types of pastries and two types of juices. . . This is the first time I have seen such a shabby afternoon tea. I decided not to look forward to the happy hour in the evening and went directly to the hotel buffet. The buffet is pretty good, and the group purchase price is right. When I went to the lounge at 8 o'clock, there was nothing. The bartender girl and the front desk service were still in place. I drank a glass and went straight to sleep. Breakfast was ok. But I'm really sorry for the price of the executive room. I suggest you not book an executive room in the future.

They said it would take another hour and could only upgrade one. They left the guests aside and went through the check-in process. It took more than ten or twenty minutes, and the efficiency was seriously low.
2. A screw fell out when I opened the door. I don’t know if it was a door lock or something. The safety lock could not be pressed down. The hinge of the wardrobe door had changed its position and the screw holes were exposed. The toilet paper towel tube was rusted. The bottom plate was peeled off. There were stains on the back of the basin. I can see it clearly in the mirror. The pixels of TV programs, including the adverti*****ts in my hotel, are all in the 1990s, not to mention 2K and 1080. The TV adverti*****ts on the subway are clearer than hotel programs. This is specially selected. Renovated in 2000
3. The so-called high floor, the central air-conditioning host is downstairs, making noise all day and night
4. It was the second day after check-out and the deposit was not processed. I called and waited for 5 minutes on the phone before it was completed.

2 times the price of mid-to-high-end domestic brands around Shanghai. It provides the service and management of a train station hotel. It is the first time in more than ten years that Ctrip has given a bad review to a hotel. It is a Marriott hotel. I will never stay here again.

The room is so small that it is called an executive floor, my God. This is not the most important thing, the room smells like sewers, and the solution given by calling customer service many times is to put an air purifier and spray air freshener in the room, which is too confusing.

Then I went directly downstairs to communicate with the front desk to change the room. Seeing that there are air purifiers in the corridors of the hotel, it is estimated that there is something wrong with the air system of the entire hotel.

Hygiene in the room is also a problem, and the lampshade of the desk lamp is full of dirt. The wires of the desk lamp just hung in the air like that. This hotel is not recommended at all.

If you stay in an executive room for one night, you can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and a light meal in the evening. The variety is also very rich, not fooling people at all. There are dumplings, noodles, rice cakes as the main food, five hot dishes, desserts, salads and drinks. The waiters and cleaning aunts I met were very warm and friendly, especially Ms. Natalie at the front desk and the beauty at the entrance of the cafeteria. I didn't ask for the specific names.

The room is also very clean, but the layout of the room is average. When you open the door, it feels like you will hit the wall. It doesn't feel good
Then again, when I booked the hotel, I saw the swimming pool. I only found out that the swimming pool was under maintenance when I went there. I felt very disappointed.
But the overall service and environment are very good
The location part is also because I didn’t do my homework well. There are not many business districts nearby, which is not very convenient.

msg:Originally booked an executive suite for 3 nights, and prepaid more than 10,000 room fees to Ctrip. On the day of check-in, I felt that the room design was unreasonable and the wind was very loud, which affected the rest. I contacted Ctrip customer service at about 7 pm to communicate that I would leave the hotel in advance, and I checked in two days after the cancellation. After all, the brand of the five-star hotel said that I had something to do. Leave early, and if you book on a daily basis, the customer can cancel the order on the APP by himself before 0:00 every day, but because I ordered a 3-day continuous booking, I need to operate Ctrip.
Ctrip customer service feedback I said that I need to communicate with the hotel reservation depar**ent, but the reservation depar**ent will get off work at 6:00 pm, so I need to communicate after going to get off work at 9:00 the next day, I am worried that it will affect the cancellation after 0:00, Ctrip customer service feedback He said, "There is no big problem, and five-star hotels can't deduct room charges for no reason, don't worry too much." At the same time, he also called the front desk of the hotel to inform the hotel about leaving the hotel early. The front desk of the hotel said that I can communicate with Ctrip to confirm.
As a result, at 9:00 am the next day, Ctrip reported that I said that the hotel did not agree to refund the room fee for two days, and I could not lose a cent. I called the hotel again, and the hotel reservation depar**ent said that if I booked on their official website, the latter two Days can be refunded normally, but because I booked on Ctrip for three consecutive nights, one cent of the room fee cannot be refunded.
Later, I repeatedly communicated with Ctrip and the hotel 4.5 times. It was not until I was about to leave the hotel at noon that I agreed to only refund the room fee for the last day, but the room fee for the next day could not be refunded. I feel speechless, five-star hotel, such poor service, hotel does not know how to be flexible, even if I booked on Ctrip platform, I stayed in your hotel, such a big hotel lacks this room fee Well, you earned the room fee for this night, and at the same time lost a guest who may stay often and the relatives and friends of the guest. The point is that the hotel also said that if I made an order on their official website, I would be able to withdraw normally in the next two days, and then Ctrip said that this was a high-sounding word that the hotel was afraid of offending the guests. Who should be held responsible? When the Consumers Association finds you, one day Know who is to blame!

msg:Due to personal reasons, I couldn't check into the hotel at night. I contacted Ctrip to cancel the reservation, but the hotel told me the cancellation time forcefully and unreasonably. I booked the hotel 30 minutes ago. There is a latest cancellation time, so why is there no last booking time? Does such a big hotel only need one night's guest room rate? It’s just one night’s room charge, it doesn’t matter. Just don't come here in the future. I would like to remind all my friends to consider carefully when booking the Renaissance Hotel.
