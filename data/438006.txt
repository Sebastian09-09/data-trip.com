msg:It was a wonderful stay. I enjoyed the aesthetic and beauty of the place. I liked that they think about all details. Hot springs and swimming pool are nice. I also enjoyed the restaurant with its great choice of dishes. Strongly suggesting the place. The staff is very friendly and polite. When I was leaving I even got a small souvenir from the front desk manager. I stayed in a lot of hotels around China. I would say this was one of the best choices. Besides the location is also very convenient.

msg:Relaxation at its finest！
￼ We enjoyed our stay at this Hot Spring hotel that came with wonderful benefits. Upon arrival, the staff is there to greet you and take your luggage to the room. The hotel is massive. Hot Springs is very large and comfortable. Lots of places for children to play and pools for them to enjoy. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Give this a four star on amenities as they did not have a crib suitable for toddlers. younger babies, yes, but not if  your baby is climbing or walking, the crib will not fit. The location is good and not far from a lot of the sites of Kunming !
Overall, I would love to stay at this hotel again, and I recommend it to all travelers.￼ ￼￼

The hotel can do with better upgrading. Also, as the location is not near anywhere convenient for restaurant food or shopping, suggest Wanda to provide a shuttle service to the Wanda shopping centre and other tourist locations.

My Chinese is poor so when I tried to communicate the problems with the spa, I’m afraid I failed since the second night I still had spurts of cold water and jets kept turning off. On the other hand, the breakfast buffet is great. The lunch/dinner buffet is amazing. The one drawback there is that you must prepay and dress for the pool or spa before heading to eat. The outdoor pools are pleasant and the huge swimming area offers much for families. Just don’t expect to swim laps. There isn’t a designated area and it’s not deep. Overall, my stay was pleasant both times I stayed.

Staff was friendly, but difficult for foreigners as no English speaking staff was available. We booked Guestroom - Garden-View (2 beds), but on arrival they allotted us Guestroom with City View(2 beds) which was bit upsetting. Thanks to reception staff, they helped us to book  sightseeing tickets. Not happy with the bathroom, half of the water spills out of the shower area otherwise satisfied with all the facilities. We enjoyed indoor swimming and yummy breakfast. Great Hospitality. 

Overall stay was good.

The next time, the waiter took the initiative to take the suitcase and send it to the front desk. When we checked in, we saw that we had children and took the initiative to give us a hot spring ticket. The hotel rooms are arranged in a Chinese style. We stayed in the room near the hot spring pool. From the balcony, we could see the children and adults having fun in the hot spring below. It felt very lively and happy to swim in person! The doors and windows have good mute effect. When the floor-to-ceiling windows are closed, you can't hear the sound of the hot spring outside! The hot spring buffet was more than one person on Friday, so we didn't go to eat. The flight was at 7 o'clock in the morning on the day of departure, and the hotel warmly prepared a portable breakfast to take with us. In short, this check-in experience was very good, and the children liked it very much!

He is a dark-skinned male waiter with a crew cut. At 0503 breakfast time, the seats in the hall were full, and he refused to let guests enter the private rooms for dinner, but the private rooms at 0502 were open during breakfast time. The most important thing is that his attitude is very bad, and he used his hands to stop guests. Everyone was holding dishes and soup, but he used his hands to stop guests. It is recommended to retrieve the surveillance and train this employee well, otherwise it will be bad for the company's reputation.

I disagree and don't want it. I can waive the room fee and ask the Kunming Market Supervision Administration to give the hotel a penalty result. This review is absolutely true.

msg:It was a very satisfying trip. The hotel service level was good. Any problems were solved in time. There were many people playing in the water. Guests staying in the hotel had priority to enter without queuing. It is recommended that two adults and two children book a large room with a hot spring bath. It was so refreshing to take a bath in hot spring water. The key is that the children had a lot of fun. The holiday reverse tour was indeed a success!

msg:The hotel I stayed in during my visit to Kunming was really beyond my expectations. As soon as the car arrived at the hotel, they quickly helped us unload our luggage. The front desk saw that we were elderly and arranged a room close to the elevator for us. The room had a balcony and two bathrooms. The design was very user-friendly. The breakfast included both Chinese and Western food, which was very rich. The hotel's environment design was also very novel and exotic. In a word, I was very satisfied.

msg:Before going to Kunming, my friend looked at many warm hotels for a guide. In the end, he chose this hotel with a relatively high cost-effectiveness. It can actually soak in hot springs (some hotels are wooden barrels, and this one has an open-air pool). The living environment is very good. It is not far from Kunming Station. It only costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi. The service is also very good. The girl at the front desk basically responds to my requests and puts 3 more bottles of water for me. Compared with staying in the old house, this place is actually quite suitable for parents and children. There is a large indoor swimming pool. I see that the children don’t want to go home after playing. It seems that there is a membership card for hot springs here, but guests can soak for free. I remember that it is from 8 am to 10:30 pm. The specific time can be confirmed with the girl at the front desk. Just take the door card to get the hand card, which is very convenient.

The service is very good. There are toilet covers and bathtub covers in the room, as well as sauna suits for hot springs (three sets in total for adults and children), which is very considerate!
The transportation is quite convenient, and it’s not far from major scenic spots and flower markets!

There are many items in the hot spring buffet and breakfast, and the taste is okay

The room is OK, but the design of the suite is unreasonable. To go to the bathroom, you have to enter another bedroom...
The overall facilities are a bit old and not well maintained.
The hot spring area is only open on one side, but the water change in the swimming pool is very hygienic.

msg:The hotel is located in Guandu District. As soon as I approached, I was attracted by the Southeast Asian style architectural appearance. The hotel lobby is very spacious, and check-in went smoothly. There were several people in our group, but one room was not available in time. The hotel specially gave us a pot of small green mandarin oranges for everyone to enjoy tea while waiting for check-in. It happened that I didn't bring a teapot, and the hotel thoughtfully lent it to me. I used it for two days, and I really regarded the customer as "God". On the first floor of the hotel is the hot spring swimming pool "Water World", which can be used free of charge by hotel guests, especially those who bring children to Kunming. The breakfast was also very rich, and all the service staff were very enthusiastic. They also gave two bottles of soda water as a gift when checking out, which tasted delicious. The cafe on the first floor sells small handbags, which are of high quality and low price. It’s definitely your best choice next time you go to Kunming!

The hotel service responded quickly. I called twice for something and it was delivered quickly. When I stayed at the Sheraton before, I had to wait a long time for it to be delivered. This hotel has great service. The speed really surprised us. We drove here and had free parking and the room was very clean. Ordering takeout is also convenient. The only bad thing was that our swimming goggles and glasses were taken away by the pool! Fortunately, I had the forethought to put my phone in the locker! The front desk of the hot spring helped check the surveillance several times but still couldn't find it, but this attitude is really good. The hot spring is open to the public, so many people from outside come to bathe, so they must keep their valuables safe. Already recommended to friends.

msg:The hotel has mostly indoor hot springs, which is very suitable for the elderly and children. The hotel is a Wanda chain, so there are no problems with the hardware facilities, but the software facilities are not well managed, especially for customers who stay in the hotel for hot spring bathing, which is not very reasonable. First, you need to keep going around to the front desk to get the hot spring hand card, and then return the hot spring hand card. Pick it up and return it when you go in again. It is too troublesome for hotel customers. The channel and management are not connected. Secondly, the cost is several times higher than the Spring Festival) to stay and enjoy the hot springs. Residents do not have as good services as independent individual guests. This is reflected in the fact that SPA clothes cannot be washed in the bathing area below. If you need more than one set, it will not work. If you If you are a hotel guest and need a set of SPA clothing, you need to purchase bathing clothing at your own expense. Third, the service provided by front-line business waiters is very stiff. During the Spring Festival, you are very busy. We tourists pay high fees for consumption. Should we also enjoy the friendly services of Spring City? For example, when you paid several hundred yuan to buy swimming clothes, she still ignored you. Later, when you went around the store a few times and asked her to inflate your swimming sleeves, she said, "I'm very busy and I don't have any." null. . . . Finally, Manager Wang Bo's service was very good. After all, he is a middle-level manager, and his thinking and structure are open. It can also solve problems in a timely and effective manner. Like. To become bigger and stronger, it is estimated that there should be an incentive mechanism for some employees' service assessments. Only in this way can they activate their intrinsic motivation to serve customers to the maximum extent, and high-quality services can effectively retain customers!

After booking, the front desk staff called in advance to discuss the room type, theme layout, and check-in time. I felt like I was home. When checking in, the security guard saluted politely when vehicles came in from the gate, and the concierge at the door helped with luggage. The front desk staff in the lobby assisted with the check-in procedures and introduced the features of the hotel. They felt professional and courteous and worthy of praise. When we entered the room, it was a tent layout that children would like. The room was also very large. It should be a parent-child theme room built as a suite. We were all very satisfied with the large balcony, considerate clothes drying rack, large bathroom and bathtub. The indoor hot spring is large and has many activities. It is also very comfortable to rub your back after soaking in the hot spring. The children had a lot of fun in the hot spring pool and swimming pool. The breakfast is exquisite and worthy of five stars. The front desk manager knew that we were leaving for the airport at 2 o'clock, and took the initiative to delay check-out for us until 2 o'clock, so that we could rest for a while. It was a very satisfying hot spring trip. If we had not booked a flight, we would have stayed a few more nights.

msg:A very satisfying accommodation experience. I came here because of the hot springs. There are quite a few pools outside the hot springs, but the water is not very deep. The indoor swimming pool is large, the water quality is very clear, the water temperature is acceptable, and basic entertainment facilities are also available. There is a steam room in the shower room and a larger hot spring pool. All in all, it's very comfortable to soak in, and it's suitable considering the price. The service of the hotel waiter was also very good. I was notified in time when I left something behind. I was satisfied and will come back next time if I have the opportunity.

The room is spacious and comfortable, and the 60-square-meter bathroom is as big as the ceiling in China. It makes people instantly forget the exhaustion of several hours of flight. The swimming pool and hot spring are the hotel's special features, suitable for business as well as families. The female owner who sells swimsuits in the hotel lobby is very kind and enthusiastic. She does not make any sales pitches and always helps customers solve their problems. Hotel manager Wang Bo has good management skills and strong error correction ability, which makes people admire the hotel owner's discerning eye.
A few more suggestions:
1Plastic slippers in hotel rooms should be covered with plastic film after blow-drying
2The number of lifeguards in swimming pools needs to be increased
3. Swimming pool lighting should always maintain high brightness and should not turn off the lights early before closing time.
4. The hot spring pool should not be filled with water for cleaning in advance while the guests are still there.
5. The number of boiled dumplings in restaurants needs to be guaranteed
6. If individual waiters in the restaurant cannot avoid sneezing, they can wear masks uniformly.
7. The overall service attitude of individual lifeguards in the swimming pool and individual front desk staff in the sauna can be retrained.
Overall, it's a very good hotel. There were some minor flaws during my stay. I raised them with the hotel and got a timely response. This is good, because a hotel that can correct mistakes in time is a grand hotel. It is recommended to stay.

All the service staff I came into contact with from arrival, check-in, restaurant, swimming pool to check-out were very professional, responded quickly, and responded to all requests. A fan was sent to the room within two minutes of saying the room was hot. The super-first-class service makes the entire journey experience more comfortable and provides great value for money.

There was garbage and waste paper behind the sofa. I thought it was mosquito bites at first, but it took me a long time to come back. I couldn’t get out. Local people in Kunming said it was bitten by ants or bugs. In addition, the hotel didn’t have a robot to deliver food. We were told that we couldn’t get out by ourselves with takeaways. I said that I was a person with two children and was given a room card. I just asked the waiter to bring it to me. I was convinced that the service could be compared to a hotel under the Wanda brand. The only thing was that the door greeter at the door looked good. I held my child and helped me pick up my things and open the door. Apart from other things, there were no shopping malls or supermarkets around. You have to take a taxi to get it, and a bucket of water costs 15 yuan.

First, we wanted to play in the indoor swimming pool. As soon as we entered the water, a manager came over and asked us to buy swimming caps. Half of the people playing didn’t bring them, so they just stared at us two girls? So we went outside and wanted to soak in the hot springs. An aunt said it would end at half past nine, so hurry up! It was only after eight o'clock. I said that we were hotel guests and asked if there were bath towels in the hot spring. She said arrogantly: No, you go to the room to get it. Including the subsequent bathing, I was also speechless. When we left the hotel, the front desk asked us to give us a good review. I think we still have to follow reality and the service in the store needs to continue to improve.
Also, it’s good to go early in the morning.

It is very suitable for bringing children to play in the hotel. In fact, there are many children in the hotel. The swimming pool is great, but it is too noisy. If you like quiet, choose carefully

Facilities: The hotel's soundproofing needs to be improved, and some facilities are a bit old. The shower flow in the room that was changed later was very small, and it took a long time to get hot water. It would be better if the toilet seat was replaced with a smart one. It was cold.

First of all, I would like to praise the location of the hotel. It is located in the city center with convenient transportation and is surrounded by many restaurants and shopping malls, making it ideal for business and leisure travel. I arrived at the hotel very quickly from the airport which was very convenient.

Upon entering the hotel, I was attracted by its luxurious and elegant decoration. The lobby is spacious and bright, and the warm service of the waiters made me feel at home. Their smiles and professional attitude made my first impression of the hotel very good.

The room I stayed in was also very comfortable. The bed is soft and comfortable, and the sheets are clean and tidy, making it feel like home. The facilities in the room are complete, including air conditioning, TV, minibar, etc., which met all my needs. I also noticed that the soundproofing of the room was very good and I could rest quietly in the room without being disturbed by the noise from outside.

I was also impressed by the hotel's food and beverages. Breakfast provides a variety of choices, including a variety of hot foods, cold foods and fruits, which met my various needs for breakfast. Dinner offers a variety of cuisine, including local specialties and international dishes, which are very delicious.

In addition, the hotel also provides some additional services such as gym, swimming pool and SPA center, where I found a place to relax and rest during my busy travels.

Overall, I had a very pleasant stay at the Helibinya Hotel. I was impressed by the hotel's excellent service, comfortable environment and delicious food. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family and I'm sure they will have a great time here as well.

After looking at many hotels, I chose Hailibinya after comprehensive consideration. Not disappointed, it would be very relaxing to stay in the hotel for a day or two if you have enough time. I forgot to take a photo of the room, it matches the pictures online! The entire stay was comfortable and relaxing, the breakfast was quite rich, and the hot springs made the stay very fulfilling. In all aspects, the price-performance ratio is very high.
 
The hotel room is very spacious with a balcony and a rack for drying clothes, which is really practical when traveling. The bedding was also very comfortable, so I had a good night's sleep. The entire room is decorated with solid wood and is of high quality. The facilities and equipment in the room are well maintained and clean. Just didn't find disposable slippers in the room. It comes with non-slip slippers, bathrobes and hot spring clothes for going to the hot spring. I don't want the balcony of the room to be too noisy and face the infield, so there is a reminder at the front desk. Check-in and check-out are also efficient.


Unlimited hot springs for one person: This is why we booked the hotel. After playing around Kunming for a while, returning to the hotel and soaking in a comfortable hot spring can relieve the fatigue of travel. There are many choices from swimming pools to indoor hot springs and outdoor hot springs. There will also be performances from 8-9:30 p.m.

Breakfast: The hotel breakfast also has some local specialties in Yunnan, and the fruits in Yunnan are quite good.

msg:The room is quite big, room 425, I want a quiet room, and specifically request not to rely on the swimming pool. The room has been renovated for some time, and the door switch is not working well. Check-in includes unlimited number of hot springs. The swimming pool and hot spring are together. From 9:00 am to 10:00 pm, there are many children during the summer vacation, and there are water sports performances and interactions at night, which is a bit redundant.
If you travel with children, the price/performance ratio is still good. Breakfast is also ok.

In order to express their apologies, they also sent a fruit plate and washed a few summer clothes. 5) The environment is good, the architecture is Thai style, the greenery is diverse, and the fairy spirit is lingering. Disadvantages: There are too few fitness equipment, and it does not open until 9 am.

It's just that there was no welcome on the day of check-in, and the child fell asleep at the hotel, and no one helped to carry the luggage when we got off the bus, so it was a bit messy. With a hotel like this, I thought someone would come and help with luggage. Pool kids love it. The slippers in the room are reusable, or you can ask for disposable slippers. There are activities in their swimming pool at night, which is quite lively. Open until 10:30 in the evening, this is quite humane. There are a little few tables in the restaurant for breakfast. I stayed for two nights and had to wait for a seat in the two mornings. The category is quite rich, and I ate rice noodles for two days in a row. very delicious

I am most grateful to Ms. Hu Xueyan at the front desk. She has received us very warmly since we checked in. We wanted to book two rooms together, and she always remembered that she helped us change rooms the next day. On the first night, we couldn't get a taxi because of the rain. I asked her for help in Kunming. She was already off work, but she took us back to the hotel in the rain. She was so warm.
Booked a two-bedroom family room, the room is super large, and there is a large connected balcony where you can see the water world downstairs. The most surprising thing is the super big bathtub, don't have too much fun with the baby, don't go to sleep after 12 o'clock in the evening.
It is so comfortable to take a dip in the hotel hot spring after playing every day.

Facilities: Not so new, but redecorated in 2019, solid wood furniture, stable and elegant style

Service: from the front desk to the cleaning lady are very good
All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised. I will choose here again next time.

There is a swimming pool in the middle of the lobby, and there are several hot spring pools outside. It will rain in Kunming in the evening this season, so it is very pleasant to soak in the hot spring pools. The room is still relatively new, a bit like a Sanya hotel, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. It is suitable for parent-child travel, and the children have a good time in it. In the evening, there is a performance on the swimming pool stage, but unfortunately we didn't know about it. It's a pity that we didn't see it when we went out for dinner. You have to wear a swimming cap inside. I didn’t bring it, so I bought one inside. It’s 10 yuan, not expensive.

Environment: I really like this Thai-style decoration style. There is also a very large swimming pool. There will be activities at night. The children had a great time!

Service: Nothing to say, very attentive. Living with children, one big quilt is not enough, so I called the front desk, and two quilts were delivered soon. The hotel also sent yogurt and fruit, which is very heartwarming!

Breakfast: There are a lot of varieties, including Chinese and Western styles, and the price of 48 yuan is very conscientious!

Unlimited number of hot springs for one person: Children like to play with water the most. They go up and down several times a day, so it is very convenient for a single person to have unlimited times.

I will stay here next time I come to Kunming!

msg:[If you have any problems while staying in the hotel, it is recommended to communicate with Ctrip as soon as possible, they care more about customers than hotels]
This hotel was the nigh**are of my trip to Yunnan. There is such a very low wooden platform on the roadside of the hot spring pool, without any static reminders and bushes, it looks no different from the wooden platform of the swimming pool. But it is very, very slippery. I have been doing board sports with full protective gear all year round, and my balance ability and safety awareness are very high. Then it fell like this, broke a bone, the hotel shirked its responsibility and said that it is impossible to walk here, there are no stairs, and it is under maintenance. Anyway, the picture is here. I, a tourist, only thought that this soup pool has two entrances and exits.
Then the solution, accompanied by the hotel staff, I went to the hospital at my own expense to check that it was a fracture. After I came back, I hoped to stay for 2 days for free to recuperate. When I came, the manager argued with a wounded person for more than an hour. It was check-out time, and I was tired, so I had no choice but to accept their sincerity and sympathy. They gave me a 25% discount to continue my stay, and 25% off my own meal...
I was too talkative, and I didn't like causing trouble too much, so I didn't call the police and complain. Fortunately, Ctrip also negotiated for me afterwards, and the hotel's attitude was still very strong. After understanding the situation, Ctrip compensated 500 wallets and suggested that I could sue. But now that people have left, it is difficult to do anything else. If there is any problem in the future, it is recommended to communicate with Ctrip as soon as possible. They will help solve it and give suggestions. Don’t be a bad person and let yourself suffer. In short, in the days after the trip to Yunnan, I could cry and regret seeing others walking normally...

msg:This time I went to Yunnan and experienced the worst hotel. Because the child likes to swim, we booked this hot spring hotel and checked in at 8:00 p.m. on the same day. The hotel service staff took the luggage to the room. When the air conditioner was turned on, there was no wind. When I asked the waiter, he said that it had been adjusted to the lowest level at the beginning. After 10 minutes, no so-called manager in charge came to check on the air conditioner. I called the front desk again, and the front desk said they would contact me again. A few minutes later, the waiter said that they could change the room. It is said that the central air conditioner is like this. It does not cool down and cools down very slowly. Did I say that the other rooms did not respond to this situation? She said no, then I said that there is a problem with our room, so why do we allow guests to check in if there is a problem with the room? After returning to the room, the old man took a shower and found that the bathroom was full of water. They called for cleaning to clean up a large bucket of water. Are guests allowed to stay in this kind of room? Director Yang, who reported it, did not deal with it and never came to the room to deal with the problem at all. In the end, the cleaning brought an electric fan. In such a hot day, the room had no air conditioner and the bathroom leaked! Do not deal with. In the end, I don't know if it was Director Yang who came and didn't solve the problem. He also said that he invited the person who repaired the air conditioner to look at it, took a ladder to look at the problem, and said there was no problem? No problem no wind? This is what solves the problem. She left the room after 11 o'clock in the evening. She said that there was a problem, and she was dealing with it the next day. She waited until the check-out at the front desk, but no one in charge came out with the problem. The front desk clerk said he knew about yesterday's problem and wanted to add WeChat? What does adding WeChat processing mean? People at the front desk why not deal with it? Where is the apologetic? This parent-child room is more than 600 a night, it is not cheap. The cleanliness of the room is also a mess. If you want to bring your children to live here, you can experience this kind of service. Complained to the hotel to the Ctrip housekeeper, but the housekeeper said a 20% discount is completely unacceptable. It costs more than 500 at a discount to stay overnight in a room with no air conditioning and water leakage. Really poor experience speechless.

It is most suitable for children to play in the water. There is no limit to the number of hot springs for a single person. You can also soak and play again the next morning. It is very user-friendly. :

msg:The location of the hotel is not in the city center, but the environment is very good, not far from anywhere. The taxi driver on the way to the hotel was a demolition household near the hotel. He said that the hotel had been open for many years, and there was a hot spring in that area. Free hot spring tickets for accommodation, children don’t want to sleep after playing, in addition to the large swimming pool, there are also coin-operated children’s playground facilities. There are still many people after the Spring Festival, the water in the swimming pool is not very clean, the water quality in the outdoor pool is good, and the skin is slippery after soaking in the hot spring. The hotel's breakfast variety is very rich, and the rice noodles are even better than those outside. There are two bowls every day, and there are fried skewers for midnight snacks. There are many people in line. The room is clean and tidy, with a bathtub and a terrace. The room facing the swimming pool was quite hot on the first day. I didn’t cover the quilt all night. I changed to the room outside the next day, which was much cooler (the difference is 10_15 degrees). It’s just right to sleep under the quilt (when we were in Kunming, the lowest temperature was 2-9 degrees).
The bridge outside the hotel is open and suitable for fireworks. There are many fireworks sales points in the city. We finally realized the freedom of fireworks

msg:Generally speaking, it is still recommended, but there was a small episode when I checked out, and I was not in a good mood, but fortunately, I still returned. The staff at the front desk, Hu Xueyan, was very nice when we first checked in. When we first checked our mobile phone to book a room, we were afraid that we would not be able to accommodate enough, so we booked an extra room. When we arrived at the store, we saw that there was a lot of room for us, so we discussed it with her. I returned one room. Originally, Ctrip said that I could not return it, so I am very grateful to Ms. Hu Xueyan. The accommodation environment and sanitation are good, the breakfast is average, and the buffet is not recommended. There is nothing to eat, and the supply is not in time. I didn’t even eat the prawns. 😇 Hot spring swimming is very good. On the morning of check-out, the child went swimming, and my friend went shopping outside and took away a room card, which cannot be refunded at twelve o’clock. After discussing with Taiwan, she said that she could only give half an hour, and if it was more than half a day, we would have to pay for half a day's room fee, because our friend took a taxi to get there in the middle of the way, it would take more than 30 minutes to arrive, and if we returned later, their attitude was very rigid, saying that it was more than half a day. The half-day room rate will be deducted every hour. For other hotels, you just need to tell the front desk that you can be late within an hour. Before the time came, we said that we wanted to deduct the money a few minutes late, which made us not in a good mood in an instant, and rushed back in a hurry

The front desk told us that the buffet is until 8:30, and there will be no refills after 8:00, but we went to the cafeteria around 7:00, and there were already leftovers Yes, there is no waiter adding food at all, they are all cleaning up the dishes. As a result, the two of us spent 140 yuan and ate leftovers from other people's meals, which was very uncomfortable. I booked a room with a balcony, which cost tens of dollars more than the balcony room, but there were so many mosquitoes on the balcony that I couldn’t even sit on it, and I didn’t even dare to open the French windows. It cost more money, and it was even more uncomfortable. After the toilet was used up in the morning, it was still clogged. Fortunately, the hotel sent someone to clear it and repair it in time, otherwise we didn't know how to stay the next night.

However,
1. The two-bedroom suite has only one bathroom, which I didn't expect.
2. It can't be rated five stars. There is no reception, no luggage handling, and you can't extend your stay and change rooms. The hotel doesn't support the luggage moving...
3. The entire hot spring is outsourced to the bathing center. There are many individual guests, and the management is chaotic and unhygienic (I saw the old man next door rubbing his feet...)
4. The bathing center management system, two sets of swimming pool slides, and a bubble ball children's pool are called parent-child hot spring hotels. It's too sloppy. I personally won't bring children to stay again.

msg:很好的酒店，住的非常舒服！
酒店中間就是温泉浴場，長者孩子都很開心。有好幾個池子，温水池冷水池都有，還有孩子滑梯鞦韆等，還有手工電玩等娛樂設施。但建議增加酒店房間直達浴場的電梯，現在從房間到浴場需要先到一樓再樓梯下負一然後再上到一樓浴場，回房間取趟東西非常不方便。住在酒店泡個温泉很愜意，躺椅躺會兒，悠哉悠哉。
房間也不錯，喜歡熱鬧選對着浴場的，喜歡安靜選對着城市的。
酒店餐廳一般，懶得出門對付一下。
整體服務特別好，前台、房間服務都特別好，有求必應，速度很快。知道我們第二天趕飛機吃不上早餐，還給貼心的準備了簡單餐包，非常感謝！

msg:第一次來昆明，在沒做攻略的前提下，看見這個温泉浴場就堅定了要訂這個酒店的信念。到酒店已經晚上八點，很快辦理入住，小朋友要立刻馬上去游泳泡温泉。免費升級了房間，住的很寬敞很舒服。温泉泳池是小朋友每天遊玩回來後的必玩項。確實蠻舒服，人很多，要戴泳帽喲。現場還有演出，二樓的飲料暢飲，午餐晚餐有自助（我們時間段不在沒吃）二樓還有休閑的地方。but，對單個大人帶小朋友不太友好，因為是媽媽帶兒子，進入浴場要分開進去，實際上進去後還要上一樓，再轉彎，第一次進場小朋友沒戴手錶，作為媽媽被嚇得不輕。還好找了工作人員去尋，現場也有男孩子們幫忙，一起找。小朋友也非常勇敢和淡定，最終是找到了。建議一定非要戴好智能手錶或者拿好手機保持聯繫。（一個被嚇到的老母親建議）另外，還在房間陽台看到了煙花。也算給這個新年一點美好的回憶。酒店整體不錯哦，就是單獨帶異性小孩一定要注意注意。孩子説下次還想要來住。pa：從早上開始温泉裏就有人了，一羣一羣絡繹不絕，據的哥説這家酒店是很好的温泉酒店大家都很喜歡來。

另外建議酒店大堂的香薰改變一下、清淡恬靜一些比較好！

酒店房間乾淨明亮，還帶個室外陽台。
工作人員專業熱情，退房的時候還贈送了香薰精油皂，開心，下次來昆明還會住這裏的。

msg:特別滿意，房間很大温度適宜，冬天去昆明第一次住的民宿 沒有空調 特別冷 這次酒店有温泉有空調，不怕冷了。浴室和卧室之間的百葉窗娃也很喜歡。可惜行程緊張沒機會玩温泉，下次試一試。前台小姐姐也很給力，幫忙20多公斤的箱子送到房間

msg:房間裏設施比較舊，乾淨整潔，但電視都是10幾年前的，該升級了，其他完美，樓下就是温泉，入住客人可以無限次數。早餐豐盛，停車方便，位置較偏僻，需要開車。

msg:這個酒店是這次昆明之旅的正確，之前在攜程上選了很久，因為小朋友喜歡游泳，所以選擇了帶游泳池的酒店。果然酒店的游泳池很棒，而且晚上還有活動，小朋友玩兒得不亦樂乎。另外升級的親子房也佈置得很温馨，連我這個大朋友都愛上了房間裏的帳篷，第一次在酒店住得不想回家了
