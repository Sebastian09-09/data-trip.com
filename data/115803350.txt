The key is that the environment is very quiet and the air is fresh. It is a good place to rest and recuperate during the holidays!

msg:Generally speaking, I don't recommend it because a hotel of this price should not be like this. The door is broken, the shower is broken. All the facilities in the hotel are dark and not open for business. Animals can be seen everywhere on the grass. It is close to the highway and noisy at night. The hotel has no content and is too dry. It is still under construction. Generally speaking, it is not recommended at this stage. Don't go. . In addition, it is outrageous that the resort hotel does not have slippers and toothbrushes for children. They said that they will be sent in two days after they are used up. . . . OK. Let's train them.

msg:Next to the Dihua Ancient Town, the rooms are all next to the artificial lake, with mountains, water, small bridges, ducks and geese, and pheasants were found in the yard. It is a very quiet hotel. The room has its own terrace viewing platform, which is great. The living room and room have a panoramic view. Tea was given as a souvenir when checking in. I brewed it and drank it directly. It tasted good. The toiletries are domestic old brands, so I feel at ease. The slippers are comfortable. There are refrigerator drinks, two small bottles of purified water, and a large bucket of purified water. The automatic curtains, comfortable lighting, and aromatherapy are provided. The hotel meals were late for breakfast and I didn‚Äôt eat it. I don‚Äôt know. I ordered a few dishes in the restaurant for dinner. Pig‚Äôs trotters are not recommended. They are ready to eat after opening the bag. Fried wild fish is recommended. It is crispy and delicious. Vermicelli buns are recommended. The local specialties are delicious. I ordered Jiawu Pao Mo. The taste is good, but it may be a bit anxious. The black hard membrane is not cleaned. It is a pity, but the overall meal is still OK. The children's bedroom in the room is a little small. Because it is very close to the ancient town, the loudspeaker is very loud during the day. There is no problem at night. The room has good sound insulation. It is very close to the highway and basically no noise can be heard. The hotel environment is great, the hotel's cafe food is 18 yuan a cup. Not bad. The hotel parking is also very convenient. In short, it is a good stay experience.

Friends who come later must try the shower water temperature first. It's so embarrassing (I caught a cold the next day). There is no detailed prompt for the smart switch. The music started at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night (Qinghai-Tibet Plateau), which is quite scaryüòáüòáüòá

msg:The room design and environment are great. There are not many houses, all built around the lake, beautiful and clean. The main areas that need to be improved are services: navigation is not easy to find the hotel; the park is very large, the scenery is monotonous; there are no charging piles; if you want to ask the customer service for something, you usually have to do it yourself because of the distance; the hotel is in the town, and there was a power outage on the second day of check-in and it rained‚òî, so it was cold; the breakfast was very average; the hotel has limited hot water, and the whole family needs to take a bath carefully. After the bathtub is used up, the next person needs to wait two hours before taking a bath (energy saving)...

Minor shortcomings: the water pressure of the shower in the room is a little low, there are too few breakfast categories, many facilities are not complete, and the store is not open.
It is recommended to give guests a hand-painted park + ancient town map for easy travel. It is really difficult to find the direction when you go there for the first time.

msg:Not recommended for the following reasons. First of all, this place has not been developed yet, and there are still a lot of ****s inside. Secondly, the service attitude is very general. If there is a problem, they only say sorry. All the results caused by their problems are borne by customers. The check-in experience is very bad. Originally, Ctrip booked and chose to check in four hours in advance, but no one informed us. When we arrived at the store, they said there was no room. Sorry, we went to the town for lunch and came to check in at two o'clock. As a result, we were told again that it had not been cleaned out. We were already very unhappy. Then after checking in, we found that the room type was inconsistent with the online booking, which was equivalent to downgrading the check-in. When we asked the waiter, we were told that we were sorry again, and then there was no room type we booked. The parking fee was the problem again. When we entered the door, we called the front desk and said that the parking fee could be refunded when we checked out. Then when we checked out, we told us that only one car could be allowed in one room. We booked two four-person rooms, but only one car was reported, and it was informed afterwards. There was a feeling of being played like a monkey. The check-in experience was very poor. The room was very small. The pictures on the Internet used a lot of false photos. In fact, the big bed was in the living room. For a four-person room, there was no privacy at all. It was a very bad stay. I will never go there again. The service attitude is also hard to describe.

It is still under construction. I look forward to it in the future. It will be more perfect if there are parent-child activities like other farms.

msg:This is the first time I give a bad review! It's the Chinese New Year, and I'm happy to take my children out to play. When I came, I had high expectations for ** Holiday Farm, thinking that if I was satisfied, I would extend the room for another day. As a result, the experience after checking in was very bad, to be honest, I am sorry for the room fee. The whole process was self-service check-in, and there was no service. The feedback problems could not be solved in time. The farm is quite large. After checking in, the front desk asked us to go by ourselves, and did not explain the room facilities. We just circled in the garden to find our room. Seeing netizens' comments that we can upgrade the room for free, we also consulted. At first, we answered that the room supply was tight and we had to ask the leader, and then told us that we could not upgrade for free, but we could upgrade with extra money, so forget it. There was no welcome fruit in the room. After asking the front desk staff, they were also confused, and then told us that we didn't buy fruit today, so there was no fruit to eat. I was really speechless about this explanation! When my husband was taking a shower at night, he only washed his head and the shower ran out of hot water, but the water in the sink was hot. The most outrageous thing was that the toilet flushing was steaming hot water, but there was no hot water for taking a cold shower. I told the staff that we should not use water now. The water heater will have hot water in half an hour, but it still doesn't work. So I didn't dare to bathe my child at night, for fear that the child would catch a cold and have a fever. When I took a shower in the morning, it took two minutes to wash my hair, and then there was no hot water again. It was cold water the whole time. I seriously suspect that this is a problem with the pipe setting. The front desk staff explained that some rooms have good hot water, while others don't. Why don't you repair it when you know that some rooms have bad hot water? Why do you arrange guests to stay in the winter? When guests report that there is a problem, they just tell us not to use water first and let the water heater boil water, but it doesn't solve the problem? There are obviously many vacant rooms. Why can't we adjust a room of the same level if there is no hot water for bathing? After visiting the ancient town in the evening, we returned to the farm. The electric gate was broken, and the security guard asked us to go through the west gate where we didn't know the way. Finally, we negotiated to help the security uncle push the gate open and help close the door before letting the car in. There are many staff members for garden maintenance, security, etc., but there are not many people who can serve you. When you ask, you will find that all the staff have resigned. The room rate here is high near Dihua Ancient Town, but the service can't keep up, so it's natural that there are no guests staying. The good thing is that the whole farm environment is good, and there are not many guests staying, so we feel very quiet. During breakfast, the restaurant lady has a good service attitude and will promptly ask if the food is enough and whether you want more.
