msg:the villa is located in a huge resort surounded by mountains and forest. the villa itself cozy and the view is wild ,seperated from other bungalows so it is great to cut yourself from the people. 

Inside the villa, the standard is Ok even if the toilet room smelt and there was a leakage on one of the window. The bed is comfy but the pillows not really.

However when it comes to services, there is plenty of room for improvements (especially for this price). even if we got a personal assistant. no possibility to book the restaurant or breakfast in advance. So often there is a long queue.

msg:We just came back from three nights at Senbo. 

The staff are so friendly and helpful.  I can‚Äôt praise them enough.  They contacted us on Wechat prior to our stay and even made a helpful group to assist us with anything we needed.  They really made our holiday great! 

The cabin was one of the cleanest places I have stayed.  It was spotless! It was a beautiful location set right on the lake and close enough for us to walk back to the main hotel where the swimming pool and restaurant are. 

We had so much fun at the soft playground (my three year old didn‚Äôt want to leave) and the indoor pool is absolutely huge.  I think it‚Äôs impossible to get bored (even though a lot of outdoor activities were closed as it‚Äôs winter). I‚Äôd like to come back in the summer to try these.  My favourite was the mini farm where we could hold rabbits, ferrets, snakes, a mini pig and feed the alpaca! We also ventured up the mountain late afternoon which was beautiful.

The food was great the first day we arrived but we soon realized that we had exhausted all the things we like on the menu pretty quickly.  Some of the food wasn‚Äôt to our taste, but we expect that with being completely spoiled for choice in Shanghai. The rainforest restaurant for breakfast was nice and there was lots of choice. Also glad that there was a Costa coffee for an afternoon pick me up.  I would advise you bring your favourite snacks if you are partial to anything in particular. Also be careful to note the restaurant opening times as one day we missed lunch and we‚Äôre left without any food options! I wouldn‚Äôt advise ordering in as the hotel is too far from any decent restaurants.  I think it would be great if there was more than one choice of restaurant for lunch and dinner.  We got a bit bored at the end.

One thing I was surprised at was that there was no free or discounted concessions for guests meaning we had to pay full price for the pool, playground, farm etc which I would expect as the cabin was not cheap.  

Overall we had a lovely time.  A good mixture of relaxing and having fun! I would definitely return for a quick getaway. We did have the bonus of it being next to empty as we came the first week in January midweek! It might be a lot busier on a weekend or around holidays. Thankyou Senbo!!

Although there were some incidents during check-in, he will help solve them. We helped three times to move the luggage of four big people and two small children.

I am also very satisfied with the hotel travel photography. Thanks to the photographer this time for being very patient with the two children.

We wanted to order a package with tickets at the time, but we couldn't click at the moment of placing the order. When we arrived at the hotel, the holiday butler Sisi helped us solve the error caused by the Ctrip program.
The ticket package includes 4 universal wristbands, which can be used to enter and exit the indoor park Fantasy Island, Water Park and 8 outdoor items at will during the stay, which is very affordable. The hotel also gave 60 "No. 1 Player" coins as compensation, thank you very much. Such service really surprised and touched us.
Finally, thank you again for the care and help of the holiday butler Sisi during our stay. See you next time if you are lucky.

Before checking in, the housekeeper Liu Bo contacted me and not only gave me a comprehensive introduction to the hotel, entertainment facilities, travel guides, and travel methods; he also helped me upgrade the room type to give me a more comfortable travel experience.
Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo is really very big! The first day I experienced the wooden house type. I thought it would be very troublesome, but there was a shuttle bus to pick me up. It was very convenient to make an appoin**ent for pick-up in advance. The room is very large and cleaned very cleanly. Welcome fruits were also warmly sent. The mini bar on the first day was also free to use.
On the second day, I changed to the Waliwa Kingdom that the children like. The design inside is very cartoony, and there are bunk beds. It caught the children's heart at once, and they said they would live in Waliwa Kingdom no matter what.
The hotel is a large holiday park, occupying most of the mountain, surrounded by mountains and water, with pleasant scenery, very suitable for cycling.
There are also many attractions around, such as Xiachu Lake Wetland Park, Shangchu Mountain Fantasy Valley, etc.
The facilities for children to play are complete, including the water park, Fantasy Island, and outdoor adventures. People of all ages can find something they like. The water park has a constant temperature swimming pool, which is around 30 degrees. You need to wrap yourself in a bath towel to keep warm after getting out of the water. Fantasy Island is also very large, with trampolines, go-karts, slides, etc. Whether in the water park or Fantasy Island, you can have fun for most of the day.
The hotel's tropical rainforest restaurant is also very good, and a special children's area is also opened. The buffet is rich and colorful, and the taste is also very good. I especially praise the restaurant's handmade steamed buns and beef rice noodles, which taste good.
The hotel is close to the city, so you can take a taxi to the city for dinner, and there are more choices. The drive only takes more than ten minutes. We ate Lao Zaotou here, which is really delicious. There is also Dongdafang, which is near Shangzhushan and is also very affordable. There is also a Ziyan noodle restaurant, which is highly recommended and loved by children.
Overall, this trip was very pleasant and highly recommended when there are few people in the middle of the week.

msg:Kaiyuan Senbo is said to be the ceiling of this generation of parent-child entertainment. The holiday butler Qiqi added us on WeChat before check-in, and then sent us information about outdoor entertainment, various parks and restaurants. She also answered our questions in a timely manner. The service is really great. Then let's talk about the water park. It closes at 6 o'clock, but in the morning, guests staying in the hotel can enter the park at 9 o'clock. Breakfast is at the Rainforest Restaurant, which is in the same place as the water park. It is ideal to have breakfast at 8 o'clock and go directly there after eating. Other outdoor activities are charged separately if they are not included in the accommodation package you booked. Electric boats, donuts, zip lines, and bungee catapults are all quite unique.

I thought it would be troublesome to pick up the car for travel, but it was actually very convenient, and the mini app can also make an appoin**ent to call a car. At first, I was worried that the water park would be cold, but it was really hot after I went there! And our butler Yiyan~ sent various warm reminders the day before departure, and sent someone to deliver the luggage to the room after arrival, thank you! I will continue to choose next time.

If there is anything, it may be that there are not many types of buffets.
The service response speed is good, and everything can be solved within fifteen minutes.
The environment and sanitation are excellent. You can reach the lawn and the lake as soon as you open the door. There are not many mosquitoes in this season.

msg:Finally I have time to write a review. I feel like five stars are not enough. If I were to summarize this trip in a very brief sentence, we would definitely come again, and we have already recommended it to friends with children.
Before I checked in, I added the housekeeper Xiaoyi‚Äôs WeChat. After I told her that it was my father‚Äôs birthday, she immediately arranged a cake for usüç∞. I also asked Xiaoyi to sign for the things that I didn‚Äôt have time to receive at home.
Not long after I checked in, my daughter dropped my father‚Äôs mobile phone into the gap of the antiseptic wood on the balcony. After contacting the housekeeper, an employee came to deal with it quickly. It really caused a lot of trouble for everyone because the wood had to be opened in one piece. But that‚Äôs not the end. Soon, a special cleaning staff took the initiative to come to clean up the debris caused by the maintenance.
In the next few days, I sighed countless times every day about how much detail Senbo‚Äôs service has done. There are so many details that I like, I can only give a few examples: First, all the staff here are super friendly, and they waved and said hello when they met. For my 14-month-old daughter, it was the outside world welcoming her. Second, when we had breakfast at Yinzhuli Restaurant, I found that there was nothing for my daughter to eat, and wanted to ask the kitchen for a steamed bun. The chef not only came to confirm with us enthusiastically, but also made her a shrimp stewed egg. The point is that when we came to have breakfast the next day, the service staff and the chef still remembered us and took the initiative to ask if we wanted to make the same one as yesterday. It was really considerate! Third, the price of the Rain Forest Restaurant is not expensive and the food is super complete. I was surprised to find that there is a children's dining area, which is really great! The dishes at Yanlaixuan are also very delicious. I really feel satisfied everywhere! There are also room supplies, which are really complete, even children's things are complete.
There are so many comments on the fun activities that I won‚Äôt talk about them here, but my daughter had a lot of fun, and my parents were also very happy.
Finally, thank my housekeeper Xiaoyi. In fact, she sent us a lot of information in advance, but sometimes I didn‚Äôt read it carefully because I was lazy and thought it was troublesome. I always asked the housekeeper, and she replied in time and helped us solve the problem. She is a beautiful and kind lady.
If I must say that there is something unpleasant, it is that the room we booked has many stairs. Children over three years old should not be affected and may like it very much, but our baby is only one year old and has just learned to walk. These stairs increase the risk for her. So if you have a child of the same age as us, you can give priority to other room types.
The final conclusion is: please don‚Äôt rush for families with children

The staff is very enthusiastic, the shuttle bus is always available, and the breakfast in Yinzhuli is great. The housekeeper Xiaoyi is very good and responsive. She will arrange anything you need immediately. Thank you very much. I have stayed in many New Century hotels, and I feel that this is the best, no doubt about it. The only regret is that it is not summer vacation yet, there are fewer people, and some facilities are not open. I will come again next time when I have time

The room was hygienic, and the parent-child facilities for children were also available. When I opened the balcony door, I saw the lake view. The scenery was very good, and the service was very good. I added the housekeeper's WeChat in advance, and asked for a bed fence to be installed. I asked for a lot of mineral water and made milk at night. Everyone greeted politely when they met, and they were very friendly! The buffet breakfast was rich in variety, and there was a special children's area, which was great! The baby in the water park didn't want to come out, and I gave him 3 travel photos and made an appoin**ent to take them. Thank you for the hard work of the two little brothers. The photos were awesome and the photos were great! I paid a little more and bought a few photos. It was a very satisfying trip!

msg:I brought my family of two adults and two children from Beijing to Huzhou for a trip. Moganshan was the last stop. I thought this kind of place would just be a passing visit, but I didn't expect it to become the favorite place of the children on this trip. The room is well-equipped, well-functioning, and has a beautiful environment. The key is that it is too big. You need to take a shuttle bus from the guest room to other places. Fortunately, there are many buses and it doesn't delay the time. Double Water Park: The double water park we chose is indeed well-deserved. It is very large. For younger children, the wave pool is a must-play. It is safe and fun to have a swimming ring. Because I chose the water park, I didn't go to Fantasy Island. [5th Anniversary] Flora Garden Admission Qualification: This one has rock climbing, parrot park, etc., and not many people go there to see it.

msg:I booked it a long time ago, but was forced to cancel it before leaving because of the epidemic. I have some thoughts about Senbo, so I went there this time. There are four people in my family, and the children are all underage, so I chose a two-bedroom wooden house. The environment is very spacious, and it is convenient to take care of the children. The two bedrooms are equipped with two bathrooms, and bathing is not disturbed.
Environment: The entire resort is very large and the area is very clean. Mosquitoes have not awakened yet in this season, which is very friendly. The characteristics of parent-child hotels are reflected everywhere, with warm greetings and ubiquitous children's facilities (our family has big children and does not need them). It feels like the Maldives I have been to for many years. I was a little dazed when I took the shuttle bus in the hotel.
Facilities: It has been open for 5 years, and I personally think the facilities are still very new. It is very friendly to parent-child travel, with small toilets, small stairs for stepping feet, baby tableware in the restaurant, etc. Although our family has two children over 10 years old and does not need them, we still feel the hotel's intentions.
Service: The butler service is very considerate, and the holiday butler Yulu serves us. Travel tips were given one day in advance, and some information was pushed from time to time during the visit. Special thanks, they also pushed the dining merchants (we chose to eat in the resort because we were tired). When we left, they also reminded us to take the small gift when we left the hotel. In short, it was great, very considerate and friendly.

The water park does maintain a constant temperature at 0 degrees, but the water is still a bit cold. If you can wear a thick diving swimsuit, it will be no problem. The lighting in Fantasy Island is a little dim, but there are still many projects, suitable for children under 7 years old and small go-karts. Because it was too cold outdoors, I only played go-karts and high-altitude adventures. When the clothes are warm, I can buy an all-inclusive package for many outdoor activities. When going to outdoor projects, be sure to ask for a taxi because the distance is very far. The housekeeper Jingjing was very nice and some problems during check-in were also solved satisfactorily.

It was my first time to come to Senbo. The butler Xiao Shen was very enthusiastic and praised the service.
The environment is beautiful. From the balcony of the room, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the mountains and rivers, listen to the singing of birds, and feel the beauty of life.
I didn't catch lunch when I arrived, so I had a simple meal at C+. The price was good and the taste was very good. The pizza, pasta, and Oreo cake were all praised by the children.
Dinner was at a Chinese restaurant, which cost around ¬•100 per person. The food was large, delicious, and the quality was very good.

The dining environment of the Rainforest Restaurant is very good, and the Chinese food is cost-effective. There is no lunch, so we chose to go to More Cafe for afternoon tea and ordered the Sakura set meal. The resort park has a lot of amusement facilities~ We chose a quieter way of leisure. We rented a car for 50 yuan in the morning and chose a single-row three-person bicycle for an hour tour~ It also has a unique flavor. I spent three days and two nights happily~ The quiet service of Senbo Butler was very satisfactory, and she was a very enthusiastic lady.

First of all, we booked the Senbo Cabin King Suite, which was upgraded to the Senbo Cabin Family Suite for free. As soon as we entered the room, we were given welcome fruits and Coke, Sprite and milk in the minibar. The room bedding, sheets and quilt covers were clean and white, and the towels and bath towels were very white, soft and comfortable. It was very comfortable to sleep at night. Every staff member will take the initiative to say hello. For dinner, we went to Yanlaixuan Chinese Restaurant. The dishes are rich in characteristics and taste great! When I returned to the room at night, the door of the room was stuck and couldn't be locked. At first, it said that the maintenance staff had gone off work. Later, the maintenance staff rushed to repair it. It took an hour to toss and turn. The overall service was still good. Finally, another fruit and snacks were sent. The next morning, small gifts and game coins were sent again. This time the arrangement was a bit rushed, and I must experience it next time. The morning buffet is also quite rich! Great.

I have admired its name for a long time, and this time it finally happened ~ We stayed in a wooden two-bedroom villa with two bedrooms, one living room and two bathrooms. It was warm, spacious and bright, with a large balcony, perfect for family Traveling is very convenient. It is worth mentioning that before departure, a hotel butler contacted us. Our butler is the vacation butler Xingzhi, who is professional and patient. Before departure, he provided the hotel location, self-driving route, parking guide, and hotel holiday activities. The catering situation and so on were all sent to us one by one, which provided us with a good guarantee for our first time here! üëçAfter checking in, he was able to plan for us in advance, give us tips, answer questions, etc. He was meticulous and thoughtful. Thank you to Vacation Butler Xingzhi! üòÄ
Senbo Hotel has two super large parks: Water Park and Fantasy Island. Tickets can be purchased at the park service desk, and face recognition allows unlimited entry and exit on the same day and before 12 noon the next day. You can also play in the water here in winter! The water park is very big and the wave pool is really great. The children had a great time and the older friends were also very excited! The lockers can be opened and closed multiple times by scanning the QR code with your mobile phone, which is very convenient! Fantasy Island has a high-ceiling design, and the big ship is very eye-catching!
The hotel has a good ecological environment and fresh air. It is also great to rent a bicycle for family riding among the lakes and mountains. It is easy to operate by just scanning the code on your mobile phone. There are really many activities during the Spring Festival. I participated in the "Five Blessings in Senbo" event and won a prize. A free hosting for children, lasting 1.5 hours, with the theme of treasure hunter. Thanks to Happy Ambassador Brother Orange, Happy Ambassador Sister Tangyuan, and Sister Mangosteen for leading the whole trip! We watched a marine life melodrama at the Light and Shadow Theater, and answered questions to gain a blind egg box and a live jellyfish! Excited!
Try the Rainforest Buffet, Yanlaixuan Chinese Food, Sen Bistro, Afternoon Tea and Coffee Bar, etc. There are so many delicious foods in the hotel! The holiday was very enjoyable. Thank you again to the vacation butler Xingzhi and all the staff I met along the way. You were all filled with enthusiasm and happiness. You greeted us and wished you a happy new yearüéâLooking forward to meeting the Kaiyuan Senbo brand again!

Although it was raining, the rain view from the room was simply beautiful! My child didn't want to come out of the water park and Fantasy Island after playing so much. It was a very satisfying stay!

msg:For a short relaxation after busy work, I chose Moganshan Senbo. The children really like Senbo. Compared with Hangzhou Senbo, Moganshan is much larger, so open, and the scenery is great. It is very suitable for bringing children! There is also a caring butler service. The butler Liu Bo will send a lot of warm reminders. Because the travel photo time is late, I helped to apply for a late check-out. Although the travel photo cost a lot of money, I think it is really good. I am basically satisfied with all aspects. However, Fantasy Island Park is smaller than expected, but the children also had a lot of fun ü•≥ Come again next time, my father said that next time I come, I must stay for more than two nights!

msg:As a one-stop hotel for taking kids out in the area around Hangzhou, it is quite good. There are water play and amusement parks. The park is also very quiet. It is possible to escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city and stay in a wooden house for a night, which can be regarded as a vacation for the soul. The hotel waiters are very enthusiastic. The national holiday premium is only half of the original price, which is quite good. The breakfast is good, especially the freshly made ones, which can be chosen differently in other hotels. There is also a children's area in the morning, which is very considerate. It should be a hotel that I will visit again.

msg:We arrived very early, a little after ten o'clock. Surprisingly, there was a vacancy and we could check in directly. We took the sightseeing elevator from the check-in lobby to the first floor. The shuttle bus is divided into three routes. The wooden house we stayed in is on Line 2. The bus drove there in a few minutes. On the way, you will pass by the small train and go-kart/cute pet park where children play. The wooden house is just beyond. The room is not particularly good, but it is family-friendly. There is a toilet seat and footstool for children. A single-sided bed guard is also arranged. The children are very happy. The room has a balcony. When you walk out, you can see green everywhere. The bamboo forest and the fish pond are all great. There is also a clothes drying rack on the balcony. But to be honest, the hygiene is not good. There is a lot of dust in the room. There are other people's used false eyelashes on the washstand... There are other people's Band-Aids (new) on the tea table. Two servings of fruit were given and a travel photo shoot was arranged (although the children did not cooperate). The water world was fun and boating was quite interesting, but you were not allowed to take photos with your mobile phone. The children also liked the go-kart. The small train for 60 yuan, one big and one small, could not be gotten off after getting on... We did not go to the others. As for the amusement projects We were still very satisfied, but the soundproofing of the cabin was too poor. Our child fell asleep before 8 o'clock. I went to sleep after coaxing the child, but was woken up by the child next door at 10:30... But if there was no one living next door, it would be perfect. As for dining, we had our own buffet breakfast and dinner. Dinner was 198 per person. Children under 1.2 meters were free. I thought it was okay. It was not bad, but the queue was too long. Dinner started at 5 o'clock. I went to queue at 4:45 and the queue was already very long... In summary, it is still recommended for taking children out for a walk, but it is recommended not to go during holidays

msg:It's really nice to take your kids out in one stop!
Constant temperature water park and Fantasy Island, just these two, the kids had a blast.
There were a lot of people during the Qingming Festival, but it didn't feel crowded. There were queues for check-in and restaurants, and the waiting time was acceptable.
The water park looked crowded, and there was no queue for the high-altitude slide, because the children were playing in the pool and on the small slide. There is an almost vertical transparent blue mermaid path, which is too exciting to play without a warrior [laughing and crying R]. There are inflatables in the water park, just bring your own swimming ring or arm ring, and also prepare a waterproof mobile phone bag.
Fantasy Island is a large inflatable castle, with slides, ocean balls, trampolines, and small karts, free of charge. Anti-slip socks will be issued when you enter Fantasy Island. If you stay in the hotel, you can enter and exit unlimited times, and the online ticket says it is a single entry and exit.
This time I stayed in a lake view double-bedroom villa with two bedrooms, one with a large bed and one with a twin bed. The twin beds can be put together, and it is very spacious for two adults and two children to sleep together. In the morning, there are ducks (or geese?) begging for food on the terrace, which is very interesting.
The dinner buffet at the Rainforest Restaurant is complete and tastes good. There are several kinds of wine, and the hamburgers in the children's meal are delicious.
The breakfast is also very good. The elders said it is better than star hotels. Rice balls, tofu pudding, sweet potatoes and tea quail eggs are recommended. The children eat a lot.
The housekeeper will contact you before check-in to provide various useful information and greetings. If you have any questions, they will reply in time, which really makes you feel good.

It is in good hygienic condition. The two beds can also be pushed together, which is very convenient.

The underground garage is 100 meters from the hotel, so you don't have to wait for the shuttle bus. The hotel is also close to restaurants and amusement parks, so you can just walk there. Eating is very convenient. The Yulin Restaurant has a rich breakfast. The Yanlaixuan Restaurant on the first floor does not require a reservation. You can just go and order food on the spot. However, group purchases require a reservation one day in advance. Personally, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs recommended to go there if you have small children or simply stay in a hotel.

It is worth mentioning that Xiaoyi, the vacation butler, provided enthusiastic service from the day before the trip to check-in and check-out.

If the three bedrooms on the island in the middle of the lake use hot water at the same time, the water flow will fluctuate and the temperature will be unstable. It will be hot and cold for a while. This is the biggest failure of this trip. One day, we had breakfast at Yinzhuli. It was a good experience with fewer people, but the staff were too proactive in collecting the dishes. Dinner and lunch were both at Yan Lai Xuan, the portions were large and the taste was good. Except for the water park, the children experienced all other projects and had a great time! There are still a few areas that need improvement: there are special bathing supplies for children, but they were not replenished in time and were empty; when we went to Yinzhuli for afternoon tea on the first day, the shuttle bus driver actually took the wrong way. We realized that we had come to the wrong place, and the master had long disappeared, so we had to walk there by ourselves. Although it was not a long way, it was still raining lightly; there were two deck chairs placed on the terrace of the three-bedroom villa in the center of the lake, and it looked like There was no difference, and there was no prompt. When I sat down, my pants were completely wet. Although there were some problems, I was still very satisfied with this two-night and three-day trip. Finally, thank you to the lobby manager Xiao Wu for your service!

msg:It was a very satisfying trip. It was very easy to choose a family hotel when traveling with children. A dedicated housekeeper contacted us the day before check-in to tell us various things to note, such as meal times, hotel activities, and various travel precautions. We had already checked in before we checked in. I feel the hotel's care. The check-in process is also very flexible. You can store your luggage first and wait for the room to be cleaned before checking in. During this period, you can take a stroll around the hotel. The overall environment is beautiful, with the mountains and rivers matching each other very beautiful.
The room is very suitable for children. There are sightseeing buses to pick you up wherever you want to go. Every staff here is friendly and accommodating. There are various activities during the Chinese New Year, including fireworks and various interactive performances at night. I really feel like this The hotel puts children first, and the designs are very friendly. The buffet restaurant has a special place for children to pick up meals. There are mini burgers for dinner, rice balls, sandwiches, and xiaolongbao for breakfast. The coffee is very mellow. The water park and Happy Island are also very good. I think this hotel is very suitable for a three-day and two-night trip, and it is just right for fun. The weather these days has been great for taking pictures and looking great. If it rains, we can play indoors. No matter what the weather is like, we can have a lot of fun here. We are very satisfied. During our stay, the housekeeper A Le‚Äôs meticulous care also made us feel warm and attentive. I am very satisfied with the experience of three days and two nights. I really like it here. By the way, the hotel's self-service is free for children under 1.2 years old. This is really good. Also, the water park and Fantasy Island are unlimited during the stay. , It‚Äôs so friendly. If you check out early, you will be rewarded with game currency. The design and management of all aspects of the hotel are really good. I am super satisfied. I will come back if I have the opportunity in the future.

The housekeeper Jingjing added WeChat the day before check-in, helped us recommend travel guides, and answered many of our questions. She was super patient. When we arrived at the hotel at one o'clock on the first day, there was already a room available for check-in, and the children's slippers, bathrobes and toothbrushes were also prepared in the room. After putting down our things, we went to the water park to play until dinner. Dinner was at Yanlai Xuan. It tasted good. The children were tired from playing and the food was delicious. If you want to go to the Rainforest Restaurant for a breakfast buffet, it is recommended to queue up at five o'clock. On the second day, we played in the arcade and the huge Fantasy Island. On the third day, we played outdoor go-karts, trampolines, etc. Because we went back to Fantasy Island to recharge, the children refused to leave. The housekeeper quietly helped us apply for a late check-out, and finally gave the children small gifts. Overall very happy!

msg:A super unforgettable family trip! It was the first time I took my one-year-old and three-month-old baby out to play. I was worried that it would be very tiring, but Kaiyuan Senbo has its own large indoor amu*****t park called Fantasy Island, as well as a year-round constant-temperature water park. A butler will be there before check-in. WeChat provides check-in guides and travel suggestions. Like our resort butler Zhixing Shuaiguoüëç As soon as we arrived at the lobby, he was waiting for us at the door to help us carry our luggage. His attitude was very enthusiastic and he would answer any questions in time. Every service in the resort The staff were also very enthusiastic and took the initiative to greet the children. The room was also very clean and they also provided daily fruits. The wooden cabin suite we booked faced the lake and had a large balcony. We were very lucky to meet two black swans the next day. , the children were so happy that they didn‚Äôt sleep at noon and kept watching the swans on the balconyü¶¢ so they decided to stay another night.
Fantasy Island is very big and has everything inside. It was fun to play go-karts with my daughter. You will never get tired of playing there with your kids for a whole day.
The indoor water park has wave making on the hour, but it‚Äôs a pity that we didn‚Äôt play on the big slide, because I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to do with a small one-month-old baby. I went there late and had fun playing in the main pool and making waves. I hope I can do it next time. Check in for the super long water slide, and by the way, there is also a hot spring pool inside. It‚Äôs so comfortable to have a dip in it.
There are all kinds of animals in the world of cute pets. There is an alpaca with beautiful features and beautiful features. It is so cute!
The overall experience of this stay was great. There are too many to write about. I will definitely come back next time when the baby is older. It is recommended for short-term travel for babies under 1 month old. Parents can also easily travel with their babies!

msg:It was a very pleasant trip. Thanks to the resort manager Jiayang for his careful arrangements and enthusiastic recommendation.

The wooden family room is a one-bedroom and one-living room. The large bed in the bedroom and the sofa bed in the living room are clean and comfortable.
The balcony of the wooden house has a wide view. If it doesn't rain, it will be very pleasant to sit outside and look at the scenery.

As a family resort hotel, Kaiyuan Senbo is commendable in all aspects.
Because of the weather, many people have not experienced it, but the surfing in the indoor water park is really exciting and fun.

In terms of catering, the Yanlaixuan dinner group purchase on the first day was very large and cost-effective. In particular, the service of the girl in the gray pleated skirt is particularly good.
The breakfast buffet and dinner buffet at the Rainforest Restaurant on the second day were also great. In the evening, I deliberately lined up a quarter of an hour early and "snatched" a seat with a fish tank view. It was such a surprise. The children were dancing happily and elated. All the waiters are very enthusiastic, special thanks to the auntie at the noodle stall, the red wine guy and the salmon guy.

All the staff at the resort, including the lady at the front desk, the concierge, the female driver of the shuttle bus, and every staff member I met on the road were very enthusiastic and would take the initiative to say hello. It was really comfortable.

Ctrip‚Äôs package is also very cost-effective, including breakfast for two adults and one child and water park tickets.

I am already looking forward to my summer vacation. I would rather book the Bear Tree House and the Two-Bedroom Villa by the Lake. I hope there will be suitable packages by then. I really like the two big bears in the Bear Tree House, hahaha.

And there are also wild animals coming to your room. Because the park is very large, you need shuttle buses to go everywhere.

The Chinese restaurant tastes good and is not very cost-effective, but if you don't like buffets, this place is also very good. The winter scenery is slightly bleak, but still relaxing and enjoyable.

msg:We are a family of four, two adults and two children. We spent the New Year's Eve in Kaiyuan Senbo in 2024 and were very happy. Liu Bo, the vacation housekeeper, contacted us in advance to learn about the itinerary and needs. It was our wedding anniversary on December 30. He thoughtfully helped decorate the room with lots of balloonsüéà, and also gave us cakes in the evening. The babies' happiness level instantly increased, and they also enjoyed dining and playing. They all gave us suggestions. The food in the Chinese restaurant was also very delicious. The trip of 3 days and 2 nights was very smooth. Although there were so many people, the service was not discounted. Thank you for the hard work of the staff. The service of Senbo's family hotel is really great. Very baby-friendly and considerate of every detail. The babies love the water park very much and will come again next time!

However, there are many battery cars that are very convenient and there are a lot of things to play with. Outdoor activities are not very fun for our 3-year-old child, but it would be great to have go-karts indoors! I was given a small gift when I left. I was accompanied by cookies that my baby loved to eat along the way. Thank you to the housekeeper Li Cong for his warm greetings and service. It was very considerate!

The water park in Senbo in Moganshan is much more fun than the water park in Hangzhou Senbo. The temperature is very suitable. The room temperature is 32 degrees. Children will not get cold when they play in the water. Bath towels are also provided for free and in sufficient quantity. There are also bath towels in the water park. Supply, very user-friendly.
Originally, the room package included a buffet for two people, but it was not open that day and was replaced by a Chinese restaurant package. Two rooms were exchanged for two packages. It was more than enough for 11 of us, and it was delicious. We went to the Chinese restaurant for another meal in the evening.
The housekeeper had a very good attitude and answered all our questions. He also helped us apply for late check-out and entertainment coins. He also gave us a 6-inch cake for his child's birthday, and the Chinese restaurant also gave us longevity noodles. Thank you very much.
The breakfast buffet is super delicious! ! ! Next time I will choose Moganshan Senbo@Vacation Butler Xiao Chen

msg:I was surprised to buy the package building. During the phone call during the break, I recommended the lake view room in the main building with a great view. Because the children were older, the housekeeper Xiao Chen helped us apply for a wooden family room. There was an extra sofa bed for two nights. Mom and dad took turns to sleep in it, and the environment was very good. Have a good rest quietly
It is very convenient to pick up and drop off the car. The golf cart has a door curtain. The room given is actually very close. It is suitable for walking for a few minutes. The parked car automatically turns off the lights so as not to hurt people's eyes. Good reviews
The ecology is very good. There are all kinds of small animals. I met kittens at night. In the morning, there were black swans, ducks and geese visiting the balcony.
The hotel can meet almost all needs. We bought the equipment immediately when we came here at a reasonable price. Miraculously, even though my eyes and legs were broken, a very small screwdriver set was immediately delivered to us.
I gave away a lot of coupons and small gifts. The children loved this set.
There is a children‚Äôs self-service area for breakfast. The children are crazy about it. The adults also have a lot of food, including roasted sweet potatoes. It‚Äôs so special. The food is well received!
The fun was even better. Although it was off-season, there was still a lot to play. The children said that it was always performances and activities, and it was impossible to play. It was quite fulfilling.
I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiao Chen for giving me a lot of help and suggestions, and for providing warm reminders along the way.
Thank you for the ginger tea that is available everywhere. It warms my heart.
Service exceeds Disney standards!

Surrounding environment: There is nothing you can walk to around the hotel. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to Deqing Town. There are also delicious shops in Deqing Town.
Parent-child travel: We are traveling as a couple and bought an all-inclusive package, but it is more suitable for parent-child travel. The water park is fun. We went there in mid-December. There are many activities that we can play several times. We are very happy! Remember to bring your own slippers, as your bare feet are still a bit stinging in the changing room. It was too cold to go kayaking. We also tried go-karting, but there were a lot of people queuing for the go-kart, so remember to queue first and then go when the time comes. Other items are average.
Dining: The buffet is very crowded, and all stalls in the morning are crowded, but the selection is also very high. I like the Guokui for breakfast.
Service: After check-in, there will be a little butler to add vx. It may be because I did not take care of children. I did not receive a small gift. I saw more or less children. Other butlers will tell you about play and dining times. Please ask if you have any questions. Answer, it‚Äôs okay.

msg:I booked a room for two nights at the Moganshan Music Festival (Romantic Escape Villa for two nights at 4780). Let me share my overall experience: the service was not up to standard and the hardware and software facilities were broken. Because the experience was so poor, I wrote down my stay experience for these two nights. and feelings.
Hotel service: poor. Please think about solving the problem first instead of explaining some messy things.
1. There is no receptionist to help with luggage. When we drove to the hotel entrance, we were told that the parking floor and the check-in floor are not together. You can get off the car first and check in. Because we didn't expect this situation, our luggage was a little scattered, but no one helped us with our luggage. The guy we called out was the one who took the initiative. It‚Äôs helpful, but I‚Äôll do it myself all the way.
2. When we checked in, we were told that there was a butler service in our room. They said there was afternoon tea, but I said no. They also said that it could be delivered to the room as lunch, so I added WeChat. When I wanted to deliver the room to the room the next day, I said, "afternoon tea." It‚Äôs self-service! I can't give you a room and it doesn't start until 1 o'clock, so? What do you mean when you tell me that it can be served as lunch or delivered to a room? Are there any services if I add a butler? ? ! I had no choice but to have breakfast packed and delivered to the room, but when it arrived it was already cold and the milk was spilled! Just deal with it casually. So what does my butler service serve? ! I did not get it.
3. The shuttle bus is slow, especially at night. I don‚Äôt know how long the wait will be, and there will be a bonus service that is paralyzed halfway. When I came back from the music festival in the evening, I went downstairs and took a car. There was a car but no one drove it. I finally found the service staff and urged me twice but they didn't come. I called and said I would have to wait but I didn't know how long it would take. There were several people in front of us who had been waiting for a long time. Anyway, they were just waiting. Finally the bus came, but the shuttle bus broke down twice on the road, and the last time it stopped moving. I didn‚Äôt want to wait and got off the bus and walked back! ! In addition, some of the zippers on the curtain in the car are broken, making it leaky! cold!
4. The room cleaning service is a bit disappointing. When I came back, I found that the unfinished breakfast I packed in the morning was still there, as well as the bitten apple (I didn't eat it because it tasted bad) and the plastic bag that was not thrown away. I was speechless.

Room facilities and usage: I once wondered if I was staying in a hotel with a few hundred dollars or a hotel with a price of 2,000+.
1. There is a projector in the room, but the remote control does not work well. I cannot use it while lying on the bed. I have to lie down on the end of the bed and press it to stop watching.
2. Paper towels are hard. I originally wanted to say they are as hard as toilet paper, but after thinking about it, my toilet paper is much softer.
3. The toilet flushes too poorly. This is the first time I have encountered this kind of toilet. The large size requires more than three consecutive presses to clean it. I have never encountered this in a hotel worth hundreds of yuan, so I am very concerned about it.
4. There are no two-sided small mirrors or full-length mirrors. This depends on the individual, because I personally would be a little concerned about the room facilities in this price range. There is only one sink, but other things in the room are based on the standards of two adults and two children, but there are only two bath towels. Article, I don‚Äôt quite understand.

This is my 2390-night hotel experience, a hotel that has been permanently blacklisted. Great, great!

Environment: I spent two days soaking in the water world and had a great time. Although there are not many things that the 2-year-old can play with, he is very happy just soaking in the water.

The breakfast is basically mediocre, the buffet dinner is not bad, and the Rainforest Restaurant has projections and performances, which is very suitable for children. The salt-free and oil-free meals for the children are worthy of praise and very considerate.

Service: Basically all service staff are very enthusiastic and caring for children. The performers are also enthusiastic and serious. Here I would like to praise the housekeeper Sisi. In addition to daily care and reminders, she first prepared a birthday cake for us, and second, she ran errands to help the baby order food and deliver it when the restaurant did not have food delivery service. Third, they heard that we had not slept well and took the initiative to delay our check-out. Fourth, the comfort rabbit, which we carry with us wherever we go if we lose our baby, quickly finds it for us and delivers it to our door. Before leaving, she prepared souvenirs for us. I am really grateful to her for her thoughtfulness and allowing the five of us, young and old, to have a happy birthday.

msg:During the National Day, I visited Moganshan. I had booked a room at Kaiyuan Senbo in Hangzhou before and was deeply impressed. I booked a wooden suite again without hesitation this time.

From an environmental point of view, Moganshan Kaiyuan is absolutely first-class, with a variety of room types to choose from. Wooden houses, lake view rooms and building rooms each have their own advantages. The space in the room is very large, and considering that most of them are for family travel, it is full of details. Children's toiletries and pajamas, as well as various wrapped table corners in the restaurant, are all considered for parent-child details.

Another highlight of Kaiyuan Senbo is the one-on-one butler service. Xiaomu Butler is full of details from the time of check-in to the arrangement and dispatch of the shuttle bus, the pick-up and placement of luggage, and the notification of the schedule of various hotel activities. , caring and thoughtful, very good.

Since we temporarily upgraded to a lakeside villa, Miss Chen Zihan at the front desk was very considerate. They chose an excellent location on the island in the middle of the lake for us, and explained everything in detail during the process. They were serious and competent in their work, attentive to their work, and had a beautiful smile!
The hotel is very big, and there are many places for children to play. There is a free cute pet paradise. Every time I pass by, I will go in and take a look. Although the place is not big, the children always enjoy it. The children can stay in Fantasy Island for a long time and do not want to leave. . Since my grandma and mother were traveling with their baby this time, I had limited energy and gave up on the water park. I look forward to the next time my father joins me and takes my baby to play in this water park!

Xiao Mu, the hotel's vacation butler, is very attentive. He added WeChat the day before departure to the hotel and made detailed recommendations and warm reminders in advance about hotel check-in, entertainment, dining and other aspects. Ask clearly about the arrival time and make advance reservation notes for the room, which greatly shortens the waiting time for check-in during the holiday peak period. When leaving the store, I warmly gave the children a small gift, which was very happy.
The package ticket I booked came with 2 water park tickets. You can enter and play multiple times during your stay. My son had a great time. In addition to the most popular water park, there are also many fun outdoor activities, but they all cost extra. My son completed the mine exploration, which was very exciting and strengthened his courage. In short, there are so many things to do in the hotel, I feel like I didn‚Äôt have enough to do in one night this time.
The hotel's buffet restaurant has a great environment, in the style of a tropical rainforest, with various aquatic animals swimming on the walls. We had buffet dinner and breakfast there, and the dishes were quite rich.
I am satisfied with the overall facilities and services of the hotel and will come back next time.

The small disadvantage is that there is a damp smell when we first entered the room. We need to open the balcony door for ventilation and turn on the air conditioner. The toiletries for adults come in large bottles and the children have separate small bottles. Although we brought our own, it is recommended to use small bottles. more hygienic.
The soundproofing of the hotel is average, and some guests like to talk or shout loudly in the corridor or with the door open...

Not only did he greet us at the hotel door, but he also made a detailed travel plan for us. He even made a plan to save money on how to match the free items with the payment of multiple people. I must like it. They also thoughtfully sent me information about food, drinks and entertainment every day, so we arranged our time very reasonably and enjoyed all the entertainment projects in the hotel. Let‚Äôs talk about the room first. The lake view room has a good view. Although it is not big, it was not crowded for four of us with two beds shared. It was very comfortable. Let‚Äôs talk about food. The water, drinks and fruits provided in the room are endless. The breakfast was rich, the buffet dinner was of good quality, the ingredients were fresh, and the price was high, so we had several meals. The last highlight was the fun: when we arrived on the first day, we drove a battery car to tour the entire resort, fed the animals, and watched a light and shadow interactive drama in the evening. The little sister happily received souvenirs and candies, and the elder brother was very happy to receive a jellyfish. On the second and third days, we started unlimited double play in the water park and Fantasy Island. There were many items and the children never got tired of playing. When they were tired, they went out to have a buffet and then continued playing. We also went to the garden in the middle and watched a circus show in the evening. It was a full day of fun for two more days. On the last day, we checked out before 11:00 and received 30 top player coins in the hotel, so we bought an additional 100 yuan and were able to play all afternoon. When we finally left, the housekeeper Xingzhi took special care of us to go to the front desk and prepared gifts for the children, including food and entertainment. It was an unforgettable and happy trip. When driving back to Shanghai, the two children were already discussing when to come back next time.

She picked us up at the door from the day we first arrived, and actively updated and tracked the latest activities of the day every day. Children had a great time at Fantasy Island and Water Park. There are not many animals in the cute pet paradise, but it is also very happy for children over two years old. The whole family is very satisfied with this trip, and will recommend friends to come here in the future.

msg:This is the first time I came to Kaiyuan Senbo, and I read the strategy for a long time before? How is the room at Kaiyuan Senbo Hotel? is it fun? It was my doubts before departure. Fortunately, there are unlimited surprises:
1. One day before check-in, I received a WeChat friend application from the vacation housekeeper Liu Bo. He greeted me warmly and provided precautions. On the day of check-in, what touched me the most was that Director Liu Bo took the initiative to come to the restaurant to find us and help us check in, avoiding us running errands back and forth.
2. The English sign at the entrance is really beautiful, and it is extremely cool to take pictures.
3. In the afternoon, we went to play in the water world. I have to say that it was super shocking, especially the super high slide. We sat on the air cushion and fell from a high place. The weightlessness and experience were unprecedented, which is my favorite. s project.
4. After playing in the water world, we wanted to play the zip line. We wanted to try it out. We didn‚Äôt expect the staff to be very enthusiastic. They took us to the top of the mountain and focused on it. son. Next to the Yunding restaurant is the zipline ropeway. I have to praise the master of the ropeway. I forgot to ask for his name. The service attitude is very high and he even took a video for me. Thank you very much!
5. How can we not mention the room? We stayed in the Linhu Villa, 2 bedrooms and 1 living room, facing the lake, it was really beautiful. There are corridors in the villa near the lake, with beautiful chairs, which can be concave, and there are many black swans, the children like it very much. There are drying racks and bathtubs in the room, which are very convenient for drying clothes after playing in the water world.
6. On the second day of check-in, we ate a super rich buffet for breakfast. By the way, we ate the buffet at the Rainforest Restaurant on the night of check-in. The little surprise was the tropical fish tank, which was super large and very beautiful for taking pictures.
7. When you come to Kaiyuan Senbo, how can you not go boating? We bought a ticket for rowing, which can be single or double. It is very cool to take pictures.
8. Due to time constraints, the time in Kaiyuan was not very long, but it left a deep impression on me. How can I get a refund after checking out? We stopped a shuttle bus that stopped at random. As long as we gave the room card to the master, it was equivalent to checking out. This was really a surprise.
Not much to say, Kaiyuan Senbo Resort Hotel is waiting for you to check in.

msg:I have always been a loyal fan of Kaiyuan Senbo Parent-child Hotel. I have been to Hangzhou Senbo countless times. This is the second time I stayed at Moganshan Senbo during the summer vacation. I am quite satisfied.
Room: At the same time and at the same price, the room type in Moganshan has more advantages than the room type in Hangzhou. The forest cabin suite is more suitable for a family of three. There is a small living room with relatively ample space, and the bathroom is relatively small.
Environment: The air quality in Moganshan is better, and the room location in Hangzhou is more reasonable. Green plants and the overall environment have their own advantages, and I like them all.
Service: After all, Moganshan opened late, so the service in many details needs to be gradually improved. (Every staff member is great, but the hotel needs to be more timely and effective in terms of service flexibility.) But overall it is relatively good .
Finally, let me talk about a point that I have been paying attention to after coming here twice: I hope the hotel can pay more attention: it is the place where the female guests in the water park dry their hair. It is recommended to post a reminder to let the guests take the initiative to tidy up their hair after blowing it. The broken hair or the service staff will follow up and clean up in time, otherwise it really doesn't look good, and it feels very messy.
Others are really satisfied. The coffee for breakfast is delicious, and the egg tarts and pizza in the restaurant after the water park are very delicious. I recommend refills‚ù§Ô∏è

The water park is very big, and the items inside are not bad, but there are too many people. We didn't go to Fantasy Island, so we will save some thoughts and come back next time. The kayak went at nine o'clock earlier, and it happened that the sun was not very strong, so it was very interesting for the children to paddle by themselves. My favorite is the spider web, which lasts the longest, but the sun is getting bigger and bigger behind me, so I can't stay there any longer.
Generally speaking, our experience is very good. The car picks up and drops off, and the hotel service staff are very enthusiastic and attentive. Of course, there is also a dedicated service butler, Li Cong.

The beauty playing the violin also specially played the birthday song üëçüëçüëç, which is really in place. The only bad experience is the shared electric car downstairs in the hotel. It takes half an hour to exceed one minute. It may be dangerous for guests to drive by themselves, so don‚Äôt set it up. I really think it‚Äôs too bad. I hope the hotel can supply it with it. Negotiate with suppliers to ensure benefits and experience.

msg:The day before check-in, the housekeeper will contact you via WeChat to ask about the number of guests, arrival time, special needs and various reminders, which is quite considerate. We are the housekeeper Sisi, and she will always follow up and return to see if there is any dissatisfaction or need after check-in.
We went there by car, and it was very convenient to navigate directly. We arrived around 12 o'clock. The waiter would help us unload our luggage at the entrance of the lobby and lead us to check in. My husband went to the parking lot to park. At the beginning, we were told that the room card would have to wait for a while, so we stored our luggage and went straight to the water park.
It is quite convenient for hotel guests to pay directly and brush their faces, and they can enter unlimited times before 12:00 noon on the day of departure. The indoor water park is neither big nor small, and there are quite a lot of people on weekends. It is recommended to enter the park at 9:00 the next morning. There are fewer people (non-resident tourists can enter the park at 10:00). Not long after entering the park, the hotel sent a SMS and WeChat notification to pick up the room card, and the speed was still very fast. It is unreasonable to pay extra for the rafting circle in the water park. The recreational facilities in the hotel that has been to Tuankou Hot Spring before are free for hotel guests. In addition, the child rented the rafting circle for two days and paid twice, which seemed unreasonable.
The hotel's living environment is quite satisfactory, the air is very good, you should pay attention to mosquito protection when you go out at night, the housekeeper also reminded me of this in advance. There are plenty of shuttle buses, and the waiting time is very short, which is very convenient.
The buffet dishes are average and there are many varieties, but they are not very exquisite and the taste is very popular. It is probably because of the large number of people...
Due to the limited time this time, not all the items in it were played, but the children were still very happy, which is enough!

The Linshui wooden house is very cozy. There is a yard outside the platform, and ducks and swans will come to look for food. The bathtub is so big that you can take a bath with your baby at night.
The butler, Long Fei, is very considerate in service. After checking in, he will greet you regularly in the morning and afternoon every day, and warmly remind you of the precautions for playing on the day. When checking out, the hotel prepared small gifts for the children.
The most worth mentioning is that we lost a mobile phone due to rain on the day of check-out. When we couldn't find it, we asked the housekeeper for help. Not long after, we received a call saying that the mobile phone was found.
There are swimsuit dryers and plastic bags for wet clothes in the water park. Fantasy Island prepares non-slip socks for each visitor. These arrangements are very thoughtful.
The price of hotel catering and various entertainment consumption is a little expensive, but it is still acceptable to come here for a rare visit.

The water park is relatively small, but it has an indoor part, so it doesn't need to be exposed to the sun. You can still enter the park before 12 o'clock the next day, and you can play all the exciting items. Children like to make waves in the wave pool, and it is enough for children to be happy. And there are parent-child changing rooms, parent-child shower rooms, and dryers. The details are really in place. It was late on the first day, and I was walking around lazily, so I ordered the room service of Mori Xiaoguan. The delivery starts at 80 yuan, which is fast and delicious. Breakfast the next day was at the Rainforest Restaurant, which is quite big and has a big fish tank, which attracts children. We went at 8 o'clock, there were not many people, there was no need to line up to pick up the meal, there were many types to choose from, and the taste was good. After breakfast, I went to the Cute Pet Paradise and rode a horse to feed the animals. At noon, I ate at the restaurant at the entrance of the water park. I forgot the name, but they were all delicious. I feel that the food and beverages in this hotel are quite good. The holiday housekeeper, Xiao Hao, is very caring, and will send us all the information about eating, drinking and playing in advance for our reference. Any questions will be answered in time. The small gifts given are also very practical, the children like it very much, in short, the experience is very goodüëç

Service: As soon as we arrive at the hotel, we start queuing up. The rooms are full every day since the summer vacation. We queue up at the store and eat. This scene is quite shocking, but we can also see that the management is orderly. Although the queue is long, the flow speed is very fast: The two people at the drop-off location quickly unload the luggage, and then drive to the parking lot; for meals, one person inquires about the meal situation, one person charges, and there are two rows of waiters inside to take the seats. I want to praise Jiayang, the holiday housekeeper, who added wx early, explained the entrance route, activities of the day, and dining tips clearly, and responded quickly. In general, the overall service quality is quite good.
Meals: I didn't have time to eat in the Chinese restaurant. The Rainforest Restaurant is a buffet. The meals are rich and delicious. Genting restaurant is good value for money, Jingmei food is also good. There is also a restaurant for afternoon tea, a milk tea shop, an ice cream truck, and cotton candy outside Fantasy Island. There are all children's favorites, and there are many choices.
Playing: hotel guests enter the park by swiping their faces, and get two coupons every night. They can be used on the first day until noon on the second day. The indoor and outdoor water parks, indoor fantasy island, and indoor Flora Garden are free. The outdoor cute pet paradise is free, and the glass house is paid. You can also rent bicycles or battery cars, and kayak on the water. Outdoor projects are open depending on the weather and there are restrictions on children's height. There is also a third-party light and shadow show, which is very fun. The first issue talked about the knowledge of fireflies, and each child brought back a firefly. The project is very colorful. Anyway, my children have not played enough after playing for three and a half days. Worth a second and third brush.

Before I checked in, I found that the hotel had a substantial price reduction, but the free cancellation time for the order had already passed. Later, through negotiation with Ctrip, the hotel readily refunded the money. So I re-booked a lake view room with a ticket package, which is very cost-effective.
The package includes two tickets per night, and a total of four tickets for two nights. We went to the water park on the first day, and we could enter the park an hour earlier in the morning. We also got three lockers for three tickets, and we were really satisfied. We played until the evening of the second day before we went to Fantasy Island.
In addition to the two parks, there are many rides throughout the resort. Although the free cute pet paradise is small, it is enough for children to play. A pack of feed costs 20 yuan, which is considered a normal price in scenic spots.
Also, the breakfast and dinner buffets are pretty good and have everything you need. The only regret is that there is no bathtub in the room. The child said that the hotel usually has a bathtub, why there is no bathtub today üòÖüòÇ

The facilities in the park are actually more parent-child friendly, so they are suitable for families with children. We haven't experienced much, but they look pretty good.
In addition, I recommend everyone to try the Yunding Restaurant. The view is invincible. It is suitable for dining around 18:00 in the evening. After the meal, you can take photos on the top to enjoy the sunset.

Let‚Äôs talk about the room first: the parent-child room of Waliwa Country with high and low beds chosen by the children. Figure 1 and Figure 2 are the hotel buildings of Waliwa Country, which is completely different from the overall style of Kaiyuan Senbo, and the front desk is also separate Yes, after entering, the check-in and hotel rooms are relatively fast hotel configurations. Compared with the price of more than 2,000 a night, the price is really too ordinary. The room is relatively narrow. There is no wardrobe, no luggage rack, and the table is very small. It is very small, and the bedside table is also very small. There is no place to put things. The only thing better than the Express Hotel is that there is a small outdoor garden where you can dry clothes
Recreational facilities: The water park is the biggest selling point that attracted us to book this hotel, but the tickets are bought separately, the price is slightly higher, 258 for adults and 138 for children, and there are a lot of people on weekends, and there are dumplings. Fortunately, there are more pools, so you can spread them out There is a lot of people, and the kids are having a lot of fun. It‚Äôs too hot to play outdoors in the dog days, and you have to soak in the water indoors, otherwise it‚Äôs like a sauna, and you‚Äôll die of heat.

Fantasy Island Paradise is relatively young. To be honest, it is not as playable as Baoyan. Tickets are also sold separately. Children 208, really expensive

Eat: We basically have breakfast and dinner at the Rainforest Restaurant by ourselves. The eating environment is not bad. There are a little less people on Thursday on the first day. In the next two days, there are often not many dishes. It‚Äôs just that children like to serve themselves.

The outdoor activities are basically not played because of the sun and heat. I played in a cute pet paradise. There are really few animals. I can‚Äôt finish feeding the carrots I bought for 20 yuanüòÖ

Overall evaluation, the children rated it as a holiday paradise and those who don‚Äôt want to leave, if the older friends just want to lie down, it is also a good choice

msg:It‚Äôs quite a hurry to stay for only one day. I didn‚Äôt go to Flora Garden. The cute pet park is really not worth seeing. It feels like a place in the mall where you can see cute pets for free. There are not many animals. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, and they will greet each other when they see it. The customer service butler Li Cong is also very nice. He also prepared a souvenir for the children when they took it away. This time I mainly played in the water park. I went to play once in the afternoon and again the next morning. The children felt very happy. I checked out the room before 10:30 in the morning, so I also got 60 game coins from the number one player, and the children went to have fun again. It is true that if you go in the summer, the price is quite expensive, and you can go in the off-season if you have the conditions. For this price, you can stay for three days and two nights.

The dishes in Yanlaixuan Chinese restaurant are very delicious, and the portions are plentiful, exceeding expectations! All in all, well worth a second brush!

Each room is very small. The bathroom and the room are connected together, and it costs more than 1W per night. However, there are many activities for children, which is suitable for just accompanying children to play in the hotel.
Hygiene: Because the room is generally white, it looks relatively clean and tidy. However, the wicker chair cushions in the living room feel a bit dirty and need to be cleaned frequently.
Environment: The greening environment feels pretty good. After all, the original ecology is combined with acquired modifications, and the air is very good. Because it was raining and the weather was relatively hot, it was a pity that I couldn't walk outside more.
Service: I feel that the service staff is adequate, but many of them feel like they are temporary workers. I don‚Äôt know many things at first glance. I just focus on the area in front of me and am not familiar with the hotel at all. Fortunately, there is a butler Jiayang who is very enthusiastic and thoughtful. Worth likes üëç

Regardless of the external environment of the park, the hardware facilities and soft environmental services are very good, which is worthy of the Senbo brand.
Although the cabin is not close to the main building, the shuttle bus in the park is still very powerful even during our May Day holiday. Basically, it will definitely come within five minutes after making an appoin**ent by phone, so I think it is quite convenient. Dandan, the butler of the park, is also very warm-hearted and caring. He provides various introductions and reference suggestions for travel, fun, and details. He also takes the trouble to answer our various questions one by one. The service is patient, Careful, enthusiastic let us very touched!
Although there are many diners at the Rainforest Restaurant, Paradise is very thoughtful. In fact, there is also a self-service pick-up in the inner restaurant. Although there are not as many types as the outside, the popular noodle wonton almost does not have a long queue in the inner restaurant. The restaurant also specially prepares a "children's meal" pick-up area, with healthy cooking dishes suitable for young babies!
The water park is very suitable for children, the wave pool and slides are very fun! There are parent-child changing rooms and parent-child shower rooms in the changing room, which is very private! Hope to be back soon for the summer holidays!

There are also playgrounds and cute pet parks suitable for children. It is super suitable for walking babies or girlfriends

msg:Departing from Nanjing South Railway Station, it takes 1.5 hours by high-speed rail + taxi. The cabin has a great feeling. As a parent-child hotel, the details are perfect. The hotel has toilets for children, and there is a small refrigerator in the room. The starter fruits are very fresh and generous. Like it.
The details of the water park are a little different. There is a lifeguard next to each ride, and there are lifeguards on the water slides. It‚Äôs really great. A child next to him knocked his head, and the lifeguard immediately carried the child. The small consultation room at the door provides parents with a sense of security, and safety comes first when taking their children outside.
Fantasy Island is not very attractive to my family. In Nanjing, I often take him to meland to play. The indoor playgrounds are similar. Once you enter it, you can‚Äôt find it. It is necessary to agree on a meeting place.
The price-performance ratio is good, and the breakfast buffet is especially good. My son ate 2 bowls of freshly ground soy milk and tofu brain. The Toy Story buffet breakfast is more expensive than his home. The taste and selection are not as good as his home. I only ate a little bit of the buffet dinner , because my son was too tired from playing, and fell asleep on the table. I hurriedly ate some roast duck rolls + prawns, and a bowl of plain noodles + a glass of orange juice. They are all fresh, and I can eat slowly when I have time. I saw seafood and snow crab legs, but I didn't have time to eat them. The price/performance ratio of 198 is not bad. The taste is good, as long as the buffet doesn't go wrong.
Also, the leisure bar at the entrance of the paradise is also good. The stewed beef and vegetables in the curry rice are soft and rotten. Children can eat it, but the fried fries are too old.
The overall feeling is great, it is very nice to the children, and the adults don't take it too seriously. It gives me the feeling that I am down-to-earth in business, and I don‚Äôt have the feeling of a lion opening its mouth to prepare for a meal. The experience is good, and I will bring my children a second time in the next year.

PS To play in the water, you need to bring slippers, a swimming ring, and a waterproof bag for your mobile phone. Bath towels will be provided in advance when you report your room number. You will only get 2 lockers when you stay in the hotel. You need to rent a new one the next day. The small locker is 25 . In addition, the mother takes the son (the father takes the daughter), and the children are taken by the staff to change clothes. If they cannot be together, they can change at the hotel in advance. Open the cabinet in time and bring bath towels and clean clothes to the staff, otherwise the children will be cold standing there to prevent colds.

I will definitely arrange it again when I have time. There are still many projects that I haven‚Äôt played yet.

Okay, now that I‚Äôm done talking, I‚Äôm not recommending it, it‚Äôs a gift from Flora and Meng Pet~ but there‚Äôs really nothing to go to, especially the Cute Pet Paradise, where there aren‚Äôt many animals and it stinks~ Don‚Äôt waste time! Flora is also a bit boring, 20 yuan to feed the parrot, 60 yuan to play rock climbing! But at least you don‚Äôt sunbathe, you can go shopping~ I personally recommend the spider web adventure, but it is recommended to wear long-sleeved trousers, my house is full of bruises~ (don‚Äôt underestimate the skin of boys)

Service: Finally, to praise Senbo‚Äôs service, I was quite nervous when I saw it online, but after experiencing it, I feel that the service staff are very warm and friendly. They help carry luggage from the moment they get off the bus and send it to the shuttle bus location (only those who arrive at night It took a long time for the shuttle bus to wait ~ about 10 minutes, and it took less than 5 minutes to finish the phone call ~ I came to knock on the door, which can be said to be quite fast!) The young lady at the depository is very powerful, sweet-looking, and strong. Boundless, our luggage is very heavy, and they helped us carry it to the designated location and put it away~ There is also the housekeeper Li Cong. Although I didn't see anyone, he arranged the room properly throughout the whole process. We were in a hurry, and it was already night when we arrived It's 12 o'clock~ and also helped us to delay the check-out!

Oh, by the way, the children's products in the room won the joy of the old mother and grandma. Even the grandma said that there is no place to go in the future, so come here~hahaha! I haven't played enough, I really haven't played enough~

Entertainment: The service center has purchased tickets for the water park, and you can enter the park again before 12 o'clock the next day. The advantage of shifting peaks is that there are fewer people playing and more fun. The most thoughtful thing in the water park is the changing room and shower room. There are not only parent-child changing rooms and shower rooms, but also humanized small single rooms. The designer knows the boundary sense and praises it!
I only stayed for two days and one night, and the time was fleeting. I went home before I had time to enjoy the scenery and various activities. I will come to experience it next time!

The environment is very good, especially the shuttle bus is very comfortable when the wind blows! I booked a twin-bed suite, the room is relatively large, and the sanitation is also good. In terms of food, compared with the poor taste of food in general scenic spots, the restaurants in this park taste really good. The service in the park is good, staff can be seen everywhere, smiling all the time, and responding to requests. The housekeeper Chen Zhicong has a good service attitude. Before departure, he added WeChat to remind some precautions and play strategies. If there are any problems, we can contact them on WeChat to solve them immediately. The only regret is that some facilities are not open, and the children did not enter the water park to play in the water. Looking forward to the next time!

The wooden house on the mountain is relatively quiet and the air is good. I didn‚Äôt know it for the first time. In fact, there is a twin room without a living room next door to the suite. If four people book a suite and a twin room, they can be together, which is more convenient. The buffet breakfast is quite rich, and there is a special area for children to pick up meals, which children like very much. The hotel's Chinese restaurant was a surprise this time. The taste and quantity of Yan Lai Xuan were praised by the elderly. There is a karting field in the resort area, as well as in Fantasy Island, and there is no additional charge for Fantasy Island. The kid tried to open it for the first time and played for two days. Hotel guests who buy tickets to the park can enter and exit unlimitedly on the same day, and they can be used until 12:00 noon the next day. Our family is still a little scared of the water world, and prefers Fantasy Island.

msg:On the last day of the May Day holiday, set off to Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo, travel on a staggered peak! To be honest, even though Senbo has a good reputation and has been planting grass for many years, the first time I really come here is still full of surprises! As a parent-child hotel, it can be said that it is the hotel with the best management and the most considerate details that Kaiyuan has stayed in! From the diversion management during check-in, to the complete children's facilities and equipment, the arrangement of dancing and interactive queuing, and the full service of the butler Sisi, the details are reflected in any place you need and more places you can't think of! Although traveling at off-peak times, the flow of people is still very large, but the breakfast arrangement is tight and organized. The water park should be praised. After two days of playing, the baby still can't play enough. It is recommended to bring a swimming ring and a waterproof mobile phone bag. 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter both enjoyed it! Wawala is highly recommended. It is full of childlike fun and the food in the Chinese restaurant is also very good. If you are considering a group purchase package, you need to make a reservation one day in advance. There is basically no need for a guide to get to Senbo. From arriving at the hotel to leaving the hotel, everything is properly arranged for you! Once again, I would like to praise the hotel's excellence in management! I've been here for three days and stayed for two nights. I didn't even take care of the cute pet paradise and the garden. I'll definitely come back next time!

Enter the lobby to receive Zhang Jiaxu to help check-in, and the very enthusiastic manager Liu Sijie also asked if we are here for the first time. As a Kaiyuan member, I feel that I am valued. It is self-evident that I was guided to take the shuttle bus to the expected room. The hotel opened in 2019 is still very new and unique. Figures 1 to 5 are the details of the rooms. They are very delicate and the children‚Äôs pajamas are very cute. Canasin is a bed brand used by Ritz-Carlton and Marriott. The floor is very new and clean. very clean. It's a pity that the buffet dinner is not open. Picture 8 is the entrance design of the breakfast, which is very rainforest style. The steamed meat buns for breakfast are the best, and there is grapefruit juiceüëç. We all eat at Yanlaixuan for lunch and dinner. Turbot is the best, and there is a big piece of Dongpo meat, you must eat it! The watermelon juice is also very good, it is just right for children to drink without ice!

The water park and fantasy island must be bought on the spot, and there are package tickets. It is cheaper than buying online until 12 o'clock the next day, and you can enter unlimitedly, and there is a locker for delivery. There are bicycles for three people and electric bicycles for three people in the park, both of which are good choices! The shuttle bus to work is very enthusiastic, and the phone call will definitely arrive within 5-7 minutes! Senbo is really good, every detail is done very well! Must choose here, I am the recommender.

Because the weather is still a bit cold in February, the two babies are still relatively young, so I chose to go to Fantasy Island instead of the water park.

msg:Long grass Mogan Mountain has been open for a long time, and finally brought the children to pull the ****s.
One day before the trip, Jiayang, the holiday housekeeper, contacted on WeChat to introduce the hotel's location, recreational facilities, restaurants, etc. The room type has also been upgraded, and the Senbo lake view room on a good floor has been arranged, and the view is very good. Knowing that the child's birthday is coming soon, the room is decorated beautifully, and a birthday cake is also given.
The main building is only a few minutes walk to the water park and fantasy island. This time we mainly want to play in the water park, saving the time of taking the shuttle bus.
The buffet breakfast at the Rainforest Restaurant has rich dishes and good taste. There is a baby dining area, and the baby's tableware is complete.
I have to say that Kaiyuan Senbo is very considerate in terms of parenting. Every staff member in the hotel will greet us when they see us. In addition, we are traveling on a weekday, so the experience is very good.

Water park: You can play in all of them, including wave-making area, sports area, hot spring area, amu*****t area, and another area I forgot
Gaming Zone: Just like Tom Bear
Mine: Paths of the Brave, for daring kids
Cobweb Climbing: Also a Path for the Brave, for younger kids
Cute Pet Paradise: Suitable for small children, older children may be a bit boring, the place is small, but you can go to play for free.

msg:Three days and two nights, the peak period of the winter vacation, let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings, the queue is too exaggerated at the end of the breakfast, the next day the breakfast hotel opened another restaurant to divert the queue, a little better, but the time is too early, The hotel focuses on parent-child, so we should know that some children get up early and some don‚Äôt get up early. For example, those of us who live in wooden houses have to wait for the shuttle bus, take the car, and then go to the restaurant. The time is too tight. Breakfast time can be a little later up. At night, the street lights outside the wooden house were too dark, and the house numbers outside the room could not be seen clearly. The water park changes clothes first and then stores the clothes. In fact, you can change clothes directly in the storage place, which saves you from having no place to put clothes when you change clothes. The design of the wooden house is a suite and a standard room together, but those who want to book the same room type can only stagger it. I don‚Äôt know why it is designed this way. The good thing is that there was a phone call the day before to inquire about the situation of the guests, and a housekeeper was added. I added Long Fei, who was very polite and had a good attitude. Any problems were quickly resolved. The attitude of the waiters in the hotel is very good, especially the master who drives the shuttle bus, which makes me a little embarrassed.

Seeing that Kaiyuan Senbo is the number one parent-child hotel, I chose it without hesitation!
I booked a suite for one day at the beginning... I had so much fun afterwards
I just stayed for one more day and booked a parent-child room in Waliwa Country
The two room types feel different, but the real thing is much better than the room photos on Ctrip! ! !
The hotel has a butler named Xingzhi... five-star praise! ! The people are very nice, the feeling is very attentive, and the service is also very good! !
The service staff inside are very qualified, and I really like the feeling of children...
Children's supplies are complete
The water world has a constant temperature and is not cold at all. All the changing rooms and bathrooms have doors, which is very private, which is very good!
Fantasy Island is also very big, a good place to liberate old mothers!
There are also pet feeding, horse riding, and various outdoor facilities
In short, it is very good!

After two days of play, I feel that I haven't played enough, and there are still many places I haven't visited yet. I will come again next time~
The service is also great. The receptionists are all smiling and will greet you warmly. There is also the housekeeper, Xiao Chen, who is very thoughtful about the details.

msg:The surrounding area is indeed a bit desolate. I ordered a set meal with a buffet dinner, but after the actual experience, I feel that it is better to go to Yanlaixuan for the price of 4 adults. When there are more people, it is too messy. In fact, I went out to play with children. Even if the price of the buffet is a bit higher, it doesn‚Äôt matter, but the price/performance ratio is really not good. The waiters close the dishes in a timely manner, and there is only one dance performance in the middle. It may be because of the space restrictions that it is impossible to interact with the children. There is no staff in the beverage area, resulting in a group of people getting ice cream. I was stuck digging around, and there were few choices of drinks. I read a lot of comments before saying that there were crab legs and I didn‚Äôt see it. It‚Äôs understandable that the ingredients are different. There is no salmon in the fresh food. The tuna used (maybe I‚Äôm asking too much) I think My parents went around and got all the noodles and messy vegetables. Many things were not replenished in time, and the experience was very bad...
Then let‚Äôs talk about the water, starting from the door to change clothes, especially after changing the swimsuit, the shiatsu board is really painful to go out all the way, maybe the package package brought tickets to the cabinet, but it‚Äôs not enough for those who wear thick clothes in winter , You can get a bath towel when you enter the door, and then there is a shop at the door. Swimsuits and swimming rings are sold, but I naively thought that indoors would also be sold, but I was dumbfounded when I went in. The waiter told me that there is no today, and I can‚Äôt wear a swimsuit anymore. Da da, let‚Äôs go out and buy it. It‚Äôs okay for the child to go in and play, but the result may be that the water hurts his eyes so much that he cries and refuses to play. I also tried to enter the area with the slide, and the watery eyes are indeed hot. In the end, I went out after playing for 20 minutes. The wet road on the way out was indeed a bit cold. It is recommended that mothers with babies should wrap up and go out, and then go back to the place where there are 2 waiters standing there for changing clothes. It's just there, and there is no guide for the new tourists. I took the baby into the changing area and met three or four people who were standing there without direction and took the baby to find the locker. Can you tell others at the door? How about changing into your swimsuit first and then storing your clothes? Some old people can‚Äôt understand it at all. It‚Äôs nice to have a parent-child room in the bathing area. There are baby shower gel, shampoo and body lotion.
Then there is the Magic Paradise, the space is really big, but if you really say there is something to play, for the young like us who are less than three years old, in addition to being able to play on the slide, you can also slide on the slide, and you can‚Äôt let it go. Followed, still a little tired,
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about accommodation because we live not far from the main building, so I will definitely choose the main building when I come next time. We eat and play together. The wooden house we live in may be because other guests have checked in early, so it is the same as that of my parents. The room was removed. It would be better if it could be connected. I didn‚Äôt find the underfloor heating that many people said. The weather was good for the two days we went, so we didn‚Äôt do any research. Then one pillow was really too low and two were too low.. In short It‚Äôs uncomfortable, and I sent fruit, but I think it‚Äôs better to put some biscuits or snacks for the baby. 6 bottles of water in the room are enough, and there are milk and drinks in the minibar. When I left, I found that the ashtray was placed on the TV. In the drawer under the cabinet and on the outer balcony are all the cannonballs left by the children during the Spring Festival. We checked out at 10 o'clock, because we checked out early and said that we would give game coins. I didn't want it. I have to check out. I can't Let the whole family wait for me and the children to go back to the game hall to play?
I didn't go to many places, mines, etc. Many projects open at 10 o'clock and end at 18-19 o'clock. This is not very friendly to those who only stay for one night. It is also possible that I did not allocate my time well. You have to go around the mountain. You have to choose the means of transportation in the park at your own expense. The multi-person bicycle is 200 deposit and 100. It is really exhausting to ride... Generally speaking, it is a bit tired to bring young children. The buffet breakfast is quite good, it is 8-9 During the peak hours, I really have to go back and forth to get things... But the service is really good, and the staff are very enthusiastic

We fed the parrots, a total of 60 yuan for three people, and they came out in less than ten minutes. There is a special charging area in the hotel parking lot. The tram is friendly, but the electricity fee is not cheap. I saw that the one I parked showed 1.8 yuan per kWh, and I didn‚Äôt charge it when I had enough electricity. I usually only charge 1.2 when I go outside. Suitable for children over 4 years old to play

For accommodation, you must choose a water view room, or a wooden house near the water.

msg:This is the first time I came to Senbo. I just heard that this is the ceiling of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai parent-child hotels. This time, a family of four experienced it. It is really full of details, and it is very suitable for traveling with children. I booked the New Year's Eve and the first or two nights of the New Year's Eve. The front desk called the day before the trip to confirm the itinerary. The housekeeper Xiaofu also added WeChat, and thoughtfully sent information about all aspects of food, accommodation and play in the park. It is really nice to have a one-on-one butler. If you want to know or need anything, just talk to him directly, and the reply is very fast. The park is very large. Although it is Chinese New Year, there are many activities arranged, and the waiters are very enthusiastic. The restaurant on the first floor of the New Year's Eve has a New Year's Eve dinner, which is lively and delicious. On the first night of the new year, there are fireworks, dance performances and other activities. The first year I came out to celebrate the New Year, I didn't expect it to be very lively and happy. I was a little worried before I came out, wondering if there would be insufficient staff in the park during the Chinese New Year, poor experience or something, it seems unnecessary to worry. There are several places to play inside, and staying for two or three days is not boring. The room was handed over to the shuttle bus. The bus came quickly and was very convenient. It was also equipped with a windproof curtain. The room is very clean. What I like most is the details of the park. Compared to the room, there are bed fences, footstools, baby tableware, bibs, etc. in the restaurant. There is also a baby area for breakfast in the restaurant on the second floor, and there are footsteps in the bathroom in the public area The stools, children's sinks, etc. are really thoughtful, very suitable for bringing small children, very convenient. It‚Äôs colder this time, and sometimes it‚Äôs a little rainy. I rented a battery car to go around, and then come back when it‚Äôs warmer. I can take the elderly and children with me and stroll around the park.

All the hotel staff are warm and friendly, meticulous and considerate in their work. My vacation housekeeper, Xiao Chen, is very enthusiastic and sends me various travel tips every day, which is clear and clear.
In terms of the room, we lived in a lake view wooden house with a pleasant view and a refreshing feeling.
There are also many recreational items. Children in the water park have gone and played again and again, feeding animals in the cute pet park, skating boats in the water sports center, and riding quad bikes. There are many items to play every day.
Will definitely come again next time.

I booked two nights on Ctrip, one night in a wooden house suite, the environment is elegant, the air conditioner is very powerful, even if it is cloudy, it does not affect the mood at all. Originally, I wanted to continue to live, but I added 400 for a while, and 600 for a while, and finally it was outrageous to add 900, ha ha! Helpless, Wow, I live in the country. Isn‚Äôt it good to save so much money for food? The parent-child room in Waliwa Country is suitable for a family of three under the age of ten. Big kids try not to think about it. Let's talk about fun, the water park and fantasy island are good, the most important thing is that the baby likes it. In general, apart from the annoying quotations, the service in the room center is very good. Big compliments üëç

If it rains, there are cars and umbrellas provided by the hotel, which are very convenient. Environmental services are very good. It's just that the carpet in the room is stained one by one. It is recommended to check and clean it regularly, otherwise it will affect the experience of staying. The Waliwa country room is just a shower room without a bathtub, which is unexpected, because I thought the baby could play in the bath. The food at the Rainforest Restaurant is not bad, and the dishes at the Chinese restaurant are also available. But waiting in line for a restaurant is the first time I have encountered it since I experienced a hotel. It is recommended to open a few more restaurants... Otherwise, it would be too sad to wait for an hourüò´... Besides a snack restaurant, other main restaurants cannot The delivery of food to the room is also unexpected, and this may be optimized.
The park is unlimited in and out, and the staff service is very good. It's just that the water park does not provide anything except towels for hotel guests, and there is no advance reminder. There are no slippers. Except for towels, you must bring your own, otherwise you have to buy it yourself. We didn‚Äôt know about this aspect before, so we can only play barefoot, which is a bit uncomfortable.
The overall experience is not bad, don't come in peak season, the peak-staggered experience is better

I received a phone call from the hotel 3 days in advance, informing me of the cause of the epidemic. I upgraded the wooden house with independent air conditioning. One day in advance, the housekeeper Xiao Chen contacted me on WeChat and sent the location of the hotel , check-in process and park information, if you have any questions, you can consult online, no matter sooner or later, the reply is very fast, and the service is very good: )
Although it is a pity that the water park is closed for this trip, there are very few people. My baby can play in Fantasy Island Children's Paradise for a day. The rules of unlimited entry and exit from the day of check-in to the check-out of the next day at 12 o'clock are very nice. , The baby played for 6 hours, and when she left, she was still reluctant to leave, saying that she would come again next time, and it would save effort for the parents to take it with them. It would be good if only one parent followed. There are many lazy sofas where you can lie down and rest.
The hotel's catering is also very convenient, and it tastes better than ordinary resort hotels. Overall, it is indeed a good place for children in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. I will bring my children to play every year in the future~

Especially the housekeeper Ozawa, who contacted me in advance and asked how old the child was. What time do you arrive at the store, the opening time of various recreational facilities, everything is fine, and we were upgraded to a double bedroom with a lake view. The children lived very happily.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is very rich. Although there are no people in the Pet Paradise and Fantasy Island, they are still open normally. There is no usual queuing for our family of three to play very happily! Especially worth mentioning is the aerial adventure, which fully exercises the children's independence and never give up mentality!
I believe that after the epidemic, the hotel will surely usher in spring!

msg:Room facilities:
We booked the waliwa country, but were very lucky to be upgraded to a cabin. The cabin is a standard room with two 1.2m single beds and a small balcony. The small balcony has no line of sight, and the air is fresh and natural.

breakfast:
The breakfast is very rich, from 7:00 to 10:00, one child under 1.2 meters can be brought for free. In addition to the varieties commonly found in star-rated hotels, there are breads, desserts, lactic acid bacteria, AD calcium milk and other choices specially for children, accompanied by children's tableware, which children especially like.

Bedding:
The bed is very comfortable. There are two choices of pillows, one high and one low. The mattress is also very ergonomic. I slept soundly on the first night.

parking:
The hotel has two parking lots on the road and underground. Because there were not many people on the day we went, we parked on the road, and it took only a minute or two to walk to the hotel.

Serve:
The service of Kaiyuan Senbo really deserves to be the ceiling of domestic parent-child hotels. Two days before check-in, a dedicated housekeeper, sister Moon, added me on WeChat to remind me of everything that needs to be paid attention to before check-in. After checking in, if you have anything to ask her, you will get feedback as soon as possible.

Fantasy Island:
Fantasy Island is a must-play venue in the hotel, similar to a super big Baoyan Paradise. Due to the masks, we almost booked the venue on the day we went. Because it was the child's birthday and his wish was fulfilled, he became a rebel and left Shanghai for travel. The staff members of Fantasy Island, Sister Milk Tea, Sister Wenwen, Sister Anna, Sister Yunduo, etc., after understanding the situation, thoughtfully gave birthday gifts to the children and sang birthday songs for him. The overjoyed appearance of the children made me feel that it was the right choice to go to Kaiyuan Senbo. Many thanks to these caring staff.

In short, this hotel has left a very good impression on me. The service and hardware have been perfected. Come and experience the water world when the weather is hot! Will also recommend to friends around!

msg:The three-day and two-night family trip ended perfectly. The staff in the hotel would warmly greet children and adults when they saw it. The first impression was quite comfortable. The play items in the hotel are very suitable for children and parents to play together. There are many kinds of buffet breakfast and will remind you which ingredients will cause children's allergies. The butler Chen Zhicong is very considerate from the beginning of the itinerary to the end of the itinerary. No matter how big or small you are, he will respond to your needs and solve them properly and efficiently. I will go again next time. It is a good place to take the children out to play.

Hygiene: Because the hotel is in the mountains, be prepared for mosquitoes, and the room hygiene is completely OK

Environment: The environment in the mountains always has a unique attraction for children in the city.


Service: Here is the key point, thanks to our exclusive housekeeper Shen Ning, who got in touch with us the day before, and kept in touch with us on the way there. Before arriving at the hotel, he has already arranged a room for us, and the shuttle bus is also very close to the room. The housekeeper kept reminding us of various time points and precautions.

msg:In general, Senbo Hotel is suitable for family vacations. When we went there, it was raining, and many outdoor facilities could not be played. This hotel is suitable for sunny days. The hotel's main amusement facilities are the water park and fantasy island, which are not necessarily suitable for children. I think the amusement facilities can add some free items for younger children to play, and the cute pet park can be improved and add some animals. In addition, I suggest that a swimming pool and a gym can be built to enrich the activities of parents and children. Rainforest buffet dinner is not cost-effective, and the taste of dishes needs to be improved. The hotel lobby is small and the environment is a bit noisy. It is recommended to divert and expand. The hotel room is hygienic. The wahili wah country room type is that the carpet is easy to be dirty, and the hairy hygiene is a bit difficult to take care of. Overall hotel service is also good. After leaving the store, the lady from the customer service depar**ent also specially called to inquire about improvements and send special products. Overall praise.

Unfortunately, the heaven is not beautiful, and it is raining and cooling, so there are not many opportunities to walk outside. Walking is still the number one player and harvested a wave of happiness. What I didn't expect was that we had been home for a long time.

msg:The off-peak travel experience is good, and there are not many people in Fantasy Island and Water World! The first time I saw it, I decided to add money to upgrade the room, and finally chose the main building for two reasons: convenience!
As the ceiling of the parent-child hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, let's talk about the good places first:
1. The service is very nice, the room was leaking, but the housekeeper and the manager on duty quickly solved it, and they took the initiative to give a solution. There is no shirk when there is a problem. It is worthy of praise as a parent-child hotel!
2. In buffet dinner, the waiter was unprofessional and the service attitude was not good. The manager of the restaurant also solved it quickly and took the initiative to be enthusiastic!
shortcoming:
1. There are many varieties of buffet breakfast and dinner, but the quality is very general! Breakfast is not during the peak period and there is still a wait for the meal. The queue for biscuits is very long. There is only one stove to bake, and there is no reminder before the end of the meal time.
2. The overall hardware facilities are very general, and the maintenance of the room is also very general. As a parent-child hotel, the price is not cheap. I hope the price is worthy of the quality!
Generally speaking, as a parent-child hotel near Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, it is worth encouraging to play. After all, fantasy island and water world children like it very much! Don't have too many expectations for cute pets and Flora!
3. The hotel's security and lobby management staff are fine during the day, but only a few at night! On the last day, the hotel hosted a large-scale brand exhibition, and it was full of people! I'm so glad I left the store!
As a parent-child hotel, it is best to separate such exhibitions from families traveling with children in the future, otherwise it will affect the travel experience!

‚ù§Ô∏è Stayed in a lakeside two-bedroom villa. Detached house by the lake. There are black swans visiting the balcony every day. The room type is two rooms and one living room. The bedroom and bathroom are connected together without isolation (personally I don't like this design very much). The overall sanitation environment is not bad. There are more mosquitoes. But you can ask the housekeeper for electric mosquito liquid.
üß°Water Park and Fantasy Island: The baby is only 16 months old. There is not much to play in the water world. But the adults had a lot of fun. The water slide is still very exciting. Fantasy Island is truly a baby's paradise. Discharge mode is on.
‚ù§Ô∏èRestaurant: Basically, we dine in the Rainforest Restaurant. There is an area with special food for babies. The taste is not bad. We ordered takeaway from the Chinese restaurant (the balcony of the lakeside villa is really comfortable) and we dine on the balcony of the room. The breeze is very pleasant. Chinese restaurant food is average.
ü´ß Overall, it is a good place to take your baby to go on vacation. It is recommended that you have enough time for three days and two nights. You can also rent bicycles and electric cars to go to the main building. You can call a shuttle bus (our lakeside villa is also very close to the main building. Walking). 5 minutes in the past)

Check-in time September 13-15
If you don't drive to this hotel, you can take the high-speed train to Deqing Station and then take a car. It's very convenient in the past, and you can drop by yourself when you come back. If you really can't find it, you can contact the hotel or tell the hotel steward, and they will give you a solution.
Service: It happened to be a typhoon on the day I came to check in, and many outdoor activities were cancelled, but what impressed me was that from the time we got off the car and entered the hotel, all the staff saw us with smiling faces + waving, creating a good a**osphere , the children are very happy. The hotel can call the shuttle bus to pick up and drop off, which is very convenient, but maybe we came after the Mid-Autumn Festival, not the peak season, so we didn't wait for the bus and queue up much.
In addition, the day of check-in happened to be my wife's birthday. Yunlong, the hotel steward, also specially prepared a cake for her, which was very attentive! The service of the hotel and the hotel butler Yunlong are all five-star praise!
Catering: In the evening, we ate the buffet dinner at 188 on the second floor of the hotel. There is a big fish tank to enjoy the fish. The decoration style of the restaurant is also very good, with a rainforest feeling. In terms of dishes, although there are quite a lot of things, many of them are hard vegetables, and you can eat some to support your stomach... There are very few seafood, and the only thorny flesh color does not look fresh (it is more certain to eat).
In addition, there is another √† la carte restaurant (the first floor), which we went to eat at noon the next day. It was amazing to me. I thought the taste would be normal, but I didn‚Äôt expect Mapo tofu, Yangzhou fried rice, cowboy The taste of the grains is really good (I don't recommend it if you order a hairy blood at night... It is warm when it is served, it should be prepared and put there, someone ordered it hot and sent it, the taste is average)
Play: The hotel package we ordered has tickets for the water park or fantasy island that can be exchanged. Because the child is still young, we go to the fantasy island instead of the water park, but it is also quite big. If the child can play by himself, then The adults are relieved. There are also lazy sofas for adults to rest there. Many adults directly lean on the sofa, use their mobile phones, and sleep. If you want to play, you can go karting, there are not many people in line.
The hotel also has a free cute pet paradise, the place is not big, and because it was a typhoon day and it was raining, the animals were locked up and not released, and it took two minutes to visit‚Ä¶
In addition, there are surprises every day. The black swans in the hotel are free-ranging, so they will visit everywhere. On the first day, they came to rest on the grass in front of our room, which happened to be seen by my children.
The next day, two cats came to eat at the balcony. I don't know if they were in the cute pet paradise.
Hygiene: I should talk about what needs to be improved if the place is intact. On the first day of staying in the hotel, I used up all the tissues in the room. I have rhinitis and there is a lot of dust. I keep sneezing and snot.
The toilet in the room, after using it at night, closing the lid and flushing can also wake people up...

Here comes the key question!
The decoration of the entrance of the wooden house suite I stayed in was not fixed. My two-year-old child hooked his hand, and it almost fell. Fortunately, the adults were by the side, otherwise there would be an accident!
When I checked out of the hotel, I also gave some game coins to play on the first floor opposite. The housekeeper also prepared giftsüéÅ for the children, whether it was the hotel or the housekeeper, they had a heart. I didn't experience many facilities this time. On the one hand, it was the weather factor, and on the other hand, the children were still young. I will come back when I have the opportunity.

The Wah Li Wah Hotel is the most affordable in the park. The room is not big, but the seats in a circle are practical. There are battery cars to transport guests around, which is convenient. Yunlong, the vacation housekeeper, learned my birthday and sent cakes, fruits, drinks, snacks, full of surprises. Before I left, I also gave a lot of game coins to let my daughter play enough, which was so sweet. It is a veritable family paradise.

msg:There is a room on each side of the entrance, a king-size bed room and a twin bed room, two wash basins, and a goose-stone floor in the room, which is quite classy. The waterside balcony is well-received, and there will be black swans coming up to ask guests for food, and even cats, which the baby likes very much. Every staff member of the hotel is very enthusiastic, and they will greet you warmly with both hands when they meet you in the lobby. The hotel has many parent-child facilities. The indoor water park is open all year round, but the outdoor one is closed at this time; the children's park is also very large with many amusement facilities, but only expensive tickets can be bought on site to enter and exit freely before 12 o'clock the next day, and the cheap online tickets can only be entered once. Thanks to the hotel housekeeper Xiao Cao, who enthusiastically added me on WeChat after we checked in to answer various questions about staying in the hotel, and gave us playground tokens and pet park coupons. Especially after the baby had a fever on the second day, he enthusiastically sent a thermometer and cooling stickers, which touched us very much. Thank you very much to Xiao Cao! The hotel parking building is free, and there are many 7kw slow charging piles and 30kw fast charging piles on the 3rd floor, which are very friendly to new energy vehicles, but they are open-air and the cost of 1.8/degree is very expensive.
A few shortcomings: 1. There is no place to put clothes and towels outside the bathroom. 2. The hot water may take two or three minutes to come because the pipe is too long. 3. The hotel lacks a swimming pool. 4. The charging fee for new energy vehicles is too expensive and there is no shelter on the roof of the parking building. 5. The opening of the trash can in the room is relatively small. 6. Can you consider changing the boating to or adding a pedal boat or electric boat in the park? 7. Some facilities are not open, such as the zip line and the mountaintop grass slide (it seems to be called donut? I don‚Äôt remember the name) 8. Although the night light in the room is under the sink, it is too bright. 9. Is the one on the right side of the air conditioning panel in the room a heating panel? It would be better if there is a text description on the panel.

After comparing, I chose the Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo Hotel, which is very close to Hangzhou. It took more than 40 minutes by car to arrive. At the hotel, the housekeeper Ozawa was waiting at the door, guiding us to check in, and taking us to the room intimately. The hotel is very large, and there are shuttle buses for entry and exit, so you can make an appoin**ent in advance. The housekeeper is available all day long. If you have any needs, you can send them to WeChat and they will be satisfied immediately. I am very satisfied with this trip! Speaking of food and beverages, the hotel has Chinese restaurants, western restaurants, cafeterias, etc. We mainly ate Chinese restaurant Yanlaixuan and buffet breakfast Yulin Restaurant, Yanlaixuan meals, the price is relatively high, but the portion is sufficient, the taste is also good, suitable for It is more cost-effective for people to eat. We only ate the breakfast included in the set menu at the Rainforest Restaurant. There are many categories and the taste is also good! Besides playing, because the children are still young, we only played in the cute pet park and the Flora garden. The children liked the part of feeding the small animals in the cute pet park (the feed needs to be purchased additionally, 10 yuan a bag), and also sat on the paddle. The boat, interacted with the swan at close range, the child is very happy, and will come again if there is a chance in the future. During this period, I am very grateful to the housekeeper Ozawa for his considerate service...

Although the baby is only 10 months old... Just after booking the room, the housekeeper contacted me. Here, I will praise the small party housekeeper by name. When I arrived at the hotel, the lady helped upgrade the room type. The welcome fruits and drinks are very ceremonial, as well as bed surrounds and bathtubs. It is very considerate to provide. The buffet dinner and breakfast are also very powerful. There are many foods that babies can eat, and the baby food that comes with them is not useful at all. Because we are young, this time we are visiting Fantasy Island, and the adult accompany ticket is 60 yuan. The baby does not need to buy a ticket if he is less than 80cm tall. It is very convenient to brush his face when entering the park. This time the baby can be regarded as crawling happily. He also prepared a generous gift for the baby when he left. Very satisfied with the trip, already planning the next trip, all the staff are very caring, awesomeüëç

In addition to the cute pet park and Flora Garden (which are relatively small) that tenants can enter for free, the other larger parks such as Water World and Fantasy Island have higher ticket prices, but you can enter and exit at will before check-out. Other prices have also doubled. For example, a gashapon costs 50 yuan, cotton candy starts at 25 yuan, but children insist on buying it, haha.

msg:Senbo should be one of the best parent-child resort hotels in China. Everything a family vacation needs here: natural landscapes, parent-child entertainment, rich activities, and high-quality restaurants, which can meet the various needs of a family for relaxation, companionship, leisure, and experience.
I have stayed at Senbo's centralized hotel in Hangzhou before, so this time I chose a different wooden house product in Deqing. Facts have proved that the holiday experience of a wooden house is more than a little bit better than a centralized hotel! Since the hut is far from the public area, the hotel has arranged a battery car connection system, scanning the code on mobile phones, and being on call. The housekeeper, Sister Moon, takes the initiative to communicate the check-in experience from time to time, solve the problems during the check-in process, and even give it to the children before leaving. The meticulousness of Kaiyuan's hotel management is evident.
There are many amu*****t projects in Senbo, and the children's favorite is indoor water park and children's park. The indoor water park is very suitable for parent-child play. There are many interactive experiential projects such as wave pool, happy water village, lazy river, etc. The only regret is that the weather turns cold in September, and the outdoor part of the park is closed. The Fantasy Island Children's Paradise is very large and ingeniously designed, so children can play for most of the day.
It is worth mentioning the dining at Senbo, our favorite is the breakfast at the Rainforest Restaurant. This is the best breakfast in almost all the hotels we have been to in the world. It has a rich variety and good taste. It can also combine the local food culture of Zhejiang to provide a wealth of snacks. The portion of each snack is not large, so I hope Guests can experience more varieties, which are very carefully considered.
In addition, let‚Äôs talk about parking. Senbo has an underground parking lot in the Waliwa country and the parking building on the west side of the hotel lobby. The parking space is very large. The underground parking lot is seamlessly connected with the hotel public area and the battery car system, which can be seen in the processing and operation of the moving line. The links are also thoughtfully arranged.
There are also scenic spots such as Fantasy Valley, Xiazhu Lake Wetland, and Skyline Forest Valley near Senbo. The distances are also within 20 to 30 minutes' drive, and the transportation is convenient.
In a word, this Senbo is larger and has a better environment than the one in Hangzhou. It is definitely the best choice for a family vacation in the Yangtze River Delta.

The front desk recommended me a two-bedroom villa in Hubin. I thought it would be nice to see the lake view~ I waited for three hours, but when I entered the room , all the reeds in front of me can‚Äôt see any lakes~~ At night, the customer service called to ask me how I felt, I said I couldn‚Äôt see the lake view at all, and the supplementary price was even more expensive than that on Ctrip~ I told the manager to respond, and the manager said goodbye Change the room for us, but it's already 6 o'clock in the evening, the elderly and children don't want to make a fuss~ The main thing is that you told me that it is on the same floor, and I just booked the Waliwa country. The customer service also argued that yes, it is really close, You can get there by walking, and I feel very speechless... There is no way to say that there is a price difference, the market price is like this~~ In short, the experience is not good, and I will not choose Kaiyuan Senbo again in the future...

The Little Bear Villa is also a more worthy room type. Compared with other wooden houses, it is more suitable for families with children. Can satisfy children, to tell the truth, the interior environment of the room does not meet the five-star standard, and the bathroom also has signs of mold, but it is still a flaw.
Flora Garden and Cute Pet Paradise are basically just walking around and watching the flowers. I also bought tickets to go to the water park by myself. The temperature is 30 degrees throughout the year. Dad took the children into the water. I didn't play, but I also spent more than 200 tickets.

Help, also reminded me that I am a white diamond card of Kaiyuan, which can be exchanged for drinks and afternoon tea every day. Every day we stayed in each room, we gave us fruits and specialty snacks every day. It was really warm. grateful!
Let‚Äôs talk about playing first: It takes three o‚Äôclock to check in on the first day, because it is slower for people in summer vacation, and you can go directly to Fantasy Island to play after checking in. If the room has its own tickets, but two big and two small, you can exchange it directly For children's tickets, adults only need to make up for 60 accompanying tickets for one person. The games in it are suitable for people under 10 years old. The bigger ones are basically not playable, so I don't recommend it very much.
Then go to the water world at 9 o'clock the next morning after breakfast. The two big and two small exchange adult tickets for children's tickets. This is a good deal. Adults are 258 yuan, children are 158 yuan, and guests can enter the park at 9 o'clock, not 10. Click to enter, so go early and no one will have to queue up to play items. There are quite a lot of water items to play in it. Basically, those above 1.2 can play, and it is not very exciting. Children can accept it. You can play kayak slides with adults. It's a bit tiring to climb the stairs. It is said to be the third floor. It is the height of the fifth floor. Physical strength is very important. You can play in the water world for two days. You can brush your face before entering, which is very powerfulüëçüèª
Then talk about the meal: both restaurants are available in the morning. It is recommended to go to the rainforest restaurant upstairs. Although the customer service said that the two restaurants have the same things, but from personal experience, the rainforest restaurant has more varieties and choices, and the breakfast is really good. Rich, this point must be praised, even children's snacks are considered, they are all Want Want series, and Kas yogurtüëçüèª If you want to play in the water world, eat more before going to haha üòÉ
The Chinese restaurant downstairs has meals at noon and at night, but the price/performance ratio is not high. We ordered grilled fish and some beef and vegetables one day, and fish soup the next day. The feeling is average. The hotel can also order takeaways, but the basic Far, from 40-50 yuan for delivery
Environment: It's really nice. You can rent a bicycle to walk along the lake at night. Three small, there are two single beds and one big bed, the environment is very good, the room is also large, you can consider the experience of staying...

2. The water park and playground are very friendly to hotel guests, and they can enter and exit as many times as they want within the specified time. The water park provides lockers and the playground provides socks. The baby has a good time and the service is also good.
3. The overall service of the hotel is very good. There are not many restaurants to choose from, but it is enough to stay for two or three days. The breakfast in the hotel is also very rich. I write this review mainly to thank the vacation housekeeper, Yunlong. I have stayed in many hotels. This is the most reliable housekeeper. He is attentive and thoughtful. He thinks about everything in advance, informs you, knows that the baby is having a birthday, and also prepares cakes and toys to make the baby's birthday more perfect.
4. Because the weather was too hot, I didn't visit the resort area. I'll go there next time I have a chance.

Check-in experience: Our 2 big and 2 small stay in the lakeside two-bedroom villa. The design of 2 bedrooms, 1 living room, 2 bathrooms and 1 terrace is very user-friendly, suitable for 2 families. Not only can we talk about the world together, but also go back to the house at night without disturbing each other. The check-in experience is perfect.
What to do: Our 2 15 year olds went to the water park and the mine park experience. The various facilities in the water park are relatively complete, and children of all sizes have their own fun. The mine parks are all outdoor projects, and I feel that the fees are relatively high. Since the weather was too hot, we walked around and went back.
In terms of diet: there are buffets, Chinese food and Western food. Personally, we recommend buffets. All kinds of tastes and dishes are complete, which can satisfy the taste buds of different groups of people.
Service: The hotel staff are warm and flexible. Special thanks to the housekeeper, Xiao Cao, who will contact us on WeChat the day before check-in, remind us of the precautions for check-in, and send the positioning and activity schedule for reference. Turn on the air conditioner in advance in the room, prepare fruits and practical gifts, especially warm heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Disadvantages: take the room at 15:00 in the afternoon, check out at 12:00 noon the next day ~ this time period feels very rushed.

The service attitude of helping with luggage is very good, and I will also receive a phone call to remind me of the hotel's breakfast, but the attitude of the male waiter at the front desk on the first floor of Wah Li Wah Country is obviously a lot more blunt. Overall, the visit was quite pleasant. The staff in the park were also very enthusiastic, and they would call back when they left the hotel.

Although you can check in at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, if the hotel is cleaned in advance, you can check in in advance. Thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Dang, after our room was cleaned in advance, Xiao Dang notified us in advance and checked in at about 1:30. The room is clean and spacious, the air conditioner is turned on in advance, and it is very cool to enter. The hotel also sent a lot of welcome fruits and small welcome gifts. The drinks in the refrigerator are free, and there is a large box of water in the cabinet, all of which are free and very considerate. It can also feed black swans. The children like it. The water park stays in the store and brushes their faces to enter and exit unlimited times. The children have fun playing, but the weather is too hot to play the outdoor activities. I will go there next time in the spring and autumn off-season.

From the night before our stay, Xiao Chen, the vacation housekeeper, added us to WeChat and started a series of services in advance. After we arrived the next day, someone came to pick up our luggage as soon as we got off the bus, including when we checked out, someone helped me with my luggage. After checking in, if you need a shuttle bus, you can arrive within ten minutes. Three days and two nights, I played Fantasy Island on the first day and Water World on the second day. During the evening and morning, I went to see the cute pet paradise and the number one player, as well as the Flora Garden. The baby was playing happily, and she was extremely happy. Every day, she lit up with electricity, and went back to the hotel to sleep in seconds. The old mother was also very tired. Eating is basically in the restaurant inside the hotel, both Chinese and Western food. Baby tableware baby chair baby package is standard.
On the second day, the waiter found out that we had a birthday cake and gave us a small cake. During the period, a waiter helped us run a long way to find candles, which really touched me. The lead singer of Rainforest Restaurant also sang a happy birthday song for us. Really cozy. The staff often smiled and said good morning to us, wishing the baby a healthy and happy baby. Every blessing is beautiful. Not to mention the housekeeper Xiao Chen, who helped us deliver beerüç∫, deliver nail clippers, look up this and find that, and basically respond to every request.
I am really happy to be able to play so comfortably when I travel.
Thank you Kaiyuan Senbo, see you next time!

You can see a lot of staff wherever you need. Most of the staff are summer students. They are young, polite, proactive and helpful. Help all the time. This experience is very good. Secondly, the hotel is very big, but you don't have to worry about the transfer in the hotel at all. The hotel also provided us with a vacation housekeeper. Our housekeeper is called Yunlong. Because of the epidemic, the housekeeper contacted us one day in advance to ensure that both parties can stay at the hotel as scheduled. Provide appropriate information, such as the hotel's food and beverage situation before dinner, let us know in advance where to buy tickets, what discounts are available, etc. Include some extra assistance, such as restaurant reservations or something. In general, the hotel experience is very good, especially because the main water park is a water park, and there are many young children. Many guests, including ourselves, go directly to eat in bathrobes and swimsuits. The temperature of the restaurant near the water park is just right. It will not be very cold, and there is basically no chance of a cold. This is especially careful. The hotel's play facilities are very good, suitable for young children, not too exciting, but very happy to play. Worth a second visit here.

msg:The resort is huge! This time I went to play for 3 days and 2 nights and felt just right!
üîÖHotel - This time I stayed in the Senbo Resort, the lake view was quite healing. There are many people staying in the summer vacation every day, so you have to queue up. Every service staff in the hotel is very friendly and greets you. There is a room at 3 o'clock in the afternoon where you can store your luggage to play. The room doesn't feel so clean, maybe because there are too many people because of the lack of cleaning time! The sound insulation of the corridor is not good and there are many children, so in the morning you will hear the excited sound of the children running, but at night everyone goes to bed early! Everything inside is complete üëå
üîÖWater Park - Guests can rent towels for free and don't need to bring the hotel. There are too many people. From morning to night, the water in the big wave pool feels muddy. But it doesn't affect the fun! Big friends and children are very happy! Surprisingly, there are so many items in it! There are multiple slides, there is a nearly 90-degree vertical slide suitable for adults to play, Xiao Ai's father has played 4 times and no one has haha! All the slides except the top one need to slide alone. 3 and a half year olds prefer big wave pools and lazy rivers. Others are a little scared. The good thing is that the tickets on the day can enter the park before 12 noon the next day!

üîÖFantasy Island is not suitable for babies under the age of 5. Most of them need to climb and the parents are not very good to accompany them, so Xiao Ai will come out after going.
üîÖMulti-person bicycles are very popular at night and you need to queue up. It is quite tiring to pedal for 100 hours an hour. There is a battery car next to you that can also be rented.
üîÖ Flora Garden - There is a parrot garden in it, which is highly recommended! The parrots are very friendly, and 20 people can be fed in a small pack. We went again before leaving because we liked it so much. The only thing is that it is too hot inside, sauna level.
üîÖ Adorable Pet Paradise-Because I went to Dragon Dream and Giraffe Manor, I think this area is nothing special.
üîÖOther small facilities: crafts, cinemas, video games are very good!
üîÖ There are four restaurants for dining, but found that the food seems to be the same haha! But the buffet is not bad with children's section, octopus balls, squid skewers, Peking duck section. The breakfast is also great, there are many choices, as well as rice balls, pancakes, and freshly cooked noodles.

I like this place very much. Next time I like it, I can go in the off-season. I have a little tip to watch the latest performance schedule and special events.

The resort is very big, and the indoor is mainly a water park and fantasy island, and the children don't want to go. There are also many outdoor activities in mines. Bungee jumping is the most exciting. There are requirements for height and weight. Other children above 130 can play. Went to kayak in the evening, the breeze was quite comfortable. The breakfast is very rich, that is, there are many people in the summer vacation. Dinner is basically solved by restaurants in the town, and "Dongdafang" tastes good and is recommended. Four days and three nights is just right, and I must come again next year. If possible, try to choose a room with free play privileges, which is an all-inclusive one. Tickets for all play items are included, and there is no need to buy additional tickets. The cost-effectiveness is very high.

Because of the temporary reservation, we only have the rooms in the main building. Personally, if you book a wooden villa in advance, it is still suitable to stay. If you live in a lake view room in the main building, the price/performance ratio is not high. In addition, some water play projects, located in the hotel, are also open to the outside world. Hotel consumption is very high, whether it is Chinese food or dinner, the average is more than 100 per person, mainly because of the bias. In addition, we spent 2,500 for a reserved lake view room and gave away two tickets to the park. It is recommended that parents and children play and travel for families. You can choose a four- or five-star hotel in the city center, and it is better to buy tickets for the park. Of course, if you check in with a room rate of less than 1,000 a few days in advance and give away tickets to the park, it's still possible! Therefore, for this hotel, if it is a parent-child trip, it is recommended to book a week in advance, and it is best to stagger Friday and Saturday.

As soon as I got to the room, the things in the lobby cafe fell, and I helped to take them back to the room. In short, if you have any questions, ask him. Some things are actually easier and faster to do on your own. If you can't solve it, find him again. The hotel is in peak season. The price/performance ratio is not high. I stayed for 2 nights. I didn‚Äôt know it at first. Later, I realized that the artificial rain will be on time every afternoon to cool down. Otherwise, the whole resort is really... It is not only a function of guiding you to take a car, but if you have a problem, they will also be very enthusiastic to help you solve it. If the quality of sleep is not strong. Don't sleep by the lake. All night long, frogs can bark till dawn. If you get to the point of collapse, you can hear the climax and spectacular moment of the whole frog croaking at 4:00 in the morning. Although the air temperature dropped after the rain. But I really like the air in the mountains. Yanlaixuan dishes are really good, and the price is "good". I have eaten there for two meals. The view of Genting Restaurant is really good! It is necessary to make an appoin**ent in advance, and the package must also be determined in advance. It seems that it cannot be implemented if it is changed again. When checking in, a small sticker was presented. I was in a hurry to check out, and I forgot the small gift that the butler told me. Butler Shen insisted that it must be mailed to me. Amusement park, 4 large and 2 small, buy 2 double-park coupons, 1 large and 1 small, and then buy 2 separate adult tickets. Warm little Tips, my personal suggestion for staying in the park, the water park should either go to the water park early in the morning, or in the evening, and then go in after dinner, and play a night scene, it may not be so crowded with dumplings. Fantasy Island words, children, really! You won't get tired of playing for 2 days. Overall really, really good...

After arriving at the hotel, he immediately helped us check in. There are many things that I don‚Äôt understand. Consult him and he also Answered me very patiently and provided very practical advice on our itinerary! It is precisely because of Long Fei's butler that although there are many people, it has little effect on us. The trip was very happy, and the baby didn't want to leave. The water park is very high and is the longest project we have played. Fantasy Island feels that children under the age of 10 will have a lot of fun. The mine is very dry during the day. It is recommended that the treasures who come to play arrange the play order reasonably. We booked the lakeside two-bedroom, and the car call was faster than expected, and there was basically no waiting. Will come next time!

Although the weather was very hot, after arriving at the hotel, Xiao Cao, the housekeeper, came to pick him up at the door of the hotel. Knowing that it was a parent-child hotel, he was mentally prepared for a lot of people and waiting for a room. The room waited for a while, but Xiao Cao also arranged it properly. , There will be someone in the shuttle bus to guide and help with luggage. We saved a lot of trouble for us by holding our children. The room is very clean. Although there are many mosquitoes, we have not been bitten. Furla Garden and Cute Pet Paradise are actually quite tasteless, but Little kids have fun. Throughout the day, the housekeeper Xiao Cao will send messages to give some dining and play suggestions, and will answer our questions at any time. There is no confusion and waiting for too long because of the large number of people. Thank you very much for Xiao Cao's service. All the staff systems in the hotel are quite well coordinated. In such a large park, various activities can be carried out smoothly and safely, and the playing experience is great!

Thanks again for the housekeeper Xiao Cao, the shuttle bus for guiding Dandan (it seems to be called Luodan) and a little brother in the fruit area of the rainforest restaurant (helping cut fruit for the baby)

I think the choice is right, different room types can be experienced, and it is relatively close and convenient to play and eat. I do not recommend the wahili wah country, it is more remote and the room is small. The lake view king bed is in the main building, and the wooden house is in a separate area but there will be a shuttle bus. And the lakeside wooden house is next to the lake, and the lawn and lake are just outside the door. You can see black swans at any time, and children can interact with black swans, which is very good.
Food: (Yanlaixuan, Sen Xiaoguan, Rainforest Restaurant) I have tried these places. Generally speaking, it is Yanlaixuan, a Chinese restaurant. You can order anything you want, and it is very friendly to children. Mori Restaurant is from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, the dishes are a little less, and the fried rice is not bad. Rainforest restaurant buffet dinner 188, seriously stepping on thunder! The buffet dinner was not as good as the breakfast, and overall there was nothing to eat. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was okay for two days. There were many people, so I had to go early.
Play: (Water Park, Fantasy Island, Ready Player One, Flora Garden) These four places are the main focus, and there are other small places that are not fun. If the weather is hot, Flora Garden is not recommended, only parrots, and it is still very hot. Water Park and Fantasy Island are worth a visit. The water in the water park is not cold, and it is very convenient to take a bath after playing. Fantasy Island is quite big, and you can enter and exit at any time by staying in the hotel and buying a package.
Service: This hotel is really good in terms of service. The service staff will greet you with a smile wherever you go. If you live in a wooden house, you can call for a car at any time, and the car will drive to the door of the room to pick you up. And we were lucky to have a housekeeper named Shen Ning. His service was very good and caring. When we changed rooms, because the view of the room was not very satisfactory, he took us to choose a room. He was very patient and was always on call. , help with luggage. Excellent! Five-star praise~
In general, this place does not step on thunder, and is suitable for children aged 3-10. You can play for 2 days and 1 night, or you can play slowly for 3 days and 2 nights. Let's choose the latter, it's easier~

üëÄ Play
In addition to the water park, there are many areas and projects that children and their families can play: go to the cute pet park to feed the animals, go to the Fula Garden to experience the "tropical rainforest", rent an electric tour bus or bicycle to walk around the lake or on the mountain It is also very comfortable to walk. There are many outdoor small climbing parks / amu*****t facilities around the hotel (the above are all free)
üëÄ Dining
üåü Yan Lai Xuan (Noon recommended) ¬•150/person
Chinese-style stir-fry, the taste is ok, the portion is relatively large.
üåüRain buffet (recommended dinner) ¬•188/person
Very recommended! The food is abundant, and there is a special area for children's food! There is a dance performance around 6 o'clock, the children are very happy to watch
(The restaurant basically does not need to bring your own baby tableware, bibs, wipes, dishes, forks and spoons are all available)
üëÄ room
The high-end wooden house has a pleasant view from the balcony, no sun during the day, and few mosquitoes. The indoor baby supplies are very complete, and the wooden floor of the room is very clean. Let the baby sit on the ground and play. There are free fruits and drinks which are very considerate.
The chalet is very convenient for 5-10 minutes by free shuttle bus to the lobby or water park.
What needs to be complained is the poor sound insulation of the living room and the bedroom of the suite. The phone calls in the living room are clear. If the baby wants to go to bed early, the living room needs to be very quiet. Then there is no separate door for the toilet, and it is not convenient for children to go to bed early.
üëÄService
All the service staff are very enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Azheng's service is very good, making the accommodation a lot more convenient~
The overall service of the hotel is very flexible! You don't have to go to the front desk to check out, just give the driver your room key on the shuttle bus, and he will send you to the parking lot.

msg:In May 2022, I visited the "Mogan Mountain Kaiyuan Senbo Resort Hotel" again and had a different feeling: the vegetation has basically formed a climate, the scale of greening has gradually emerged, the environment has approached the beauty of nature, and the supporting facilities and services have become high-end. The appearance of the resort can be described as pleasing to the eye, and the price is very high [strong]
    Recalling that when the spring and summer of 2020 alternated, we visited for the first time. At that time, the place that had not been in operation for a long time looked like a newly-built community that had just been delivered: the vegetation was sp****, the branches and leaves were scattered, the decoration of the room was vaguely recognizable, and the supporting amusement facilities were not yet available. Sound... After two years of precipitation, I am really happy to see the growth and progress of Deqing Senbo [strong]
    It is estimated that if it is not for the impact of the epidemic, this season, even on weekdays, should be overcrowded. However, the current situation is (we come on weekdays): buffet dinner, Genting restaurant are suspended due to low number of occupants (buffet breakfast, Yanlaixuan Chinese restaurant, Costa coffee shop are normal), aerial ropeway and other entertainment projects are suspended, the highlight‚Äî - The water park is said to be open only on holidays. Fortunately, the cute pet paradise and fantasy island are still open, at least the children still have a place to play. Then there is the possibility of sweeping a sightseeing bicycle or electric car (charged by the hour), walking around the park and seeing the scenery, which is also a good choice. Reminder: There will be more projects open on holidays, and the meals will be richer. It is recommended to call the front desk before traveling and make plans for the trip.
    This time we stayed in a lakeside villa facing the mountain, with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, with a hall in the middle and a large viewing platform facing the lake. I like its minimalist, very plain, slightly Japanese style, full of floor-to-ceiling glass, and modern decoration style [strong]. There is no doubt about the comfort level. The key point is that you can drink tea, smoke, "Ge You lie down", feed fish, and watch birds on the platform (there are no less than ten black swans, and birds such as egrets appear from time to time)... This kind of comfort and relaxation is the purpose of this trip, you will find it worth the money [pleasant]
    Senbo's buffet breakfast must be mentioned: Based on the good impression of the rich breakfast and dinner buffet of Hangzhou Senbo, I feel that under the epidemic situation and on weekdays, Deqing Senbo's breakfast is quite kind [strong] , The characteristic purple rice balls, roasted sweet potatoes, duck blood vermicelli soup, Shengzhou xiaolongbao, handmade bean curd, various children's meals, etc. are all served. Personally, I am very satisfied, which at least represents the hospitality of Senbo. Sincerity üíï, üëç!
    More comments about the environment and gameplay items will not be repeated (see related photos). No matter how good the written description is, it is not as good as the actual experience of the visit. No matter from the perspective of being close to nature or close to your family, you will feel that this trip is worthwhile [smile]
    Love Senbo! Like for Senboüëç Butler Jiayang is very good

He also said hello to the store to pick us up. If I have any questions, I will always answer them. The next day the water park was closed and told me in advance, so that I could prepare and change the order of play. Since we couldn't play in the water park the next day, he took the initiative to apply for a play ticket for us, which was really awesome.
There are few people in the recent epidemic, but the service is still very attentive, and they even upgraded my room type. The water park is very fun, there is no need to queue for anything, and the attitude is quite good. The high-altitude adventure of the amu*****t is a bit difficult, but fortunately there is a little brother assisted. The scenery of the hotel is also very beautiful, and the large tracts of rapeseed flowers are very beautiful. Will be back.
I just hope that the place where the deer is closed in the cute pet paradise can be bigger, the space for the deer is too small, a bit pitiful

1. Before coming, we communicated by phone and upgraded us to a cabin suite. Because we have children, we specially arranged for the two of us to be together.
2. Miss Zhou Zhou, the housekeeper at the door, began to contact her. From parking to check-in, the arrangement was clear and clear.
3. It was late at night and the child wanted to eat in the room. It was inconvenient for us to go shopping. I just told Zhou Zhou's housekeeper on WeChat. She personally went to the convenience store to help us buy the things we wanted, and then delivered to our room. We didn't have time to check WeChat at the convenience store, she just waited to take pictures there and send them over for us to confirm. Impressive...
4. The child was a little tired from playing. The butler asked the waiter to bring brown sugar ginger tea
5. When checking out, take the initiative to communicate with us that the child will be extended to check out at 14:00 after the lunch break.
In short, after this butler service, even if you come to Senbo in winter, you will feel warm and comfortable.
My husband said that after the service industry realizes people-to-people communication, the experience will be upgraded and doubled!

msg:First of all, the old, middle and small students are very satisfied with this trip. Thanks to our housekeeper Ah Zheng, who gave us a lot of warm tips throughout the whole process, warmly served us, and gave us reasonable suggestions! Then I will briefly describe: We have a total of 4 adults and a small booked two lake view rooms for the first night in the main building. Here are some tips for families with children who want to travel in cold weather. The main building is far from the water park, Neverland and the rainforest in the morning. It is very close to Yan Chinese Food. It has been a little rainy these days. In winter, I will not worry about the cold when I take children to play in the water. On the second night, we stayed at the Bear Tree House, which is really amazing. Although we have to use a connection Fortunately, it basically took 3-5 minutes to arrive, but it is true that living in the water is not as convenient as the main building, and the view is very good. Finally, all the service staff are very good, our shuttle bus is delivered to The location is not going to leave immediately, it will wait until you walk into the building, or when everything goes well at the destination, it is really considerate. The only suggestion is that you can prepare two sets of bath towels in the room you are staying, because we will give children I think it‚Äôs OK to prepare my own in advance. Generally, one set is definitely not enough. In addition, we ate dinner in the Chinese restaurant for two days. Maybe the epidemic is related to many dishes such as seafood, which are prepared in limited quantities every day. I can understand. The above is a reference for families who want to bring children. The whole thing is good. I will come again.

There are many places to play. Children like to play exciting games the most. The 19-meter-high water slide has been played no less than 20 times in two days. If I hadn‚Äôt called to pause, he could have continued to play and sat together with him. The adults who played once didn't dare to play, this kid can't stop playing. Will play again next time.

msg:Taking advantage of the end of 2021, I took my son to drive to Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo together. This trip was really impressive. First of all, due to the epidemic, the hotel deliberately upgraded our room for free, and directly stayed in a separate wooden house suite. Not only the room has a large space but also the living is very comfortable, clean and tidy without odor, and the scenery of the large balcony is even more refreshing. In addition, The hotel also arranged a separate vacation housekeeper Jiayang for us. With his warm service, we quickly learned about the hotel layout and play content, and thoughtful service from eating, lodging, transportation and playing. Thank you very much! The hotel staff will greet and interact enthusiastically. The short-parking driver will take the initiative to pull the windmill curtain and package luggage for the guests. I am really touched. This is definitely a warm hotel, always warm Our hearts. This time I spent four days and three nights in Senbo with my son. The daily schedule is very rich, such as Fantasy Island, Water Park, Cute Pet Park, Number One Player, Beach Slide, New Year‚Äôs Eve bonfire party, throwing drift bottles, etc. Adults and children live in a dream world together. This time, Jiayang also specially reserved a short parking to accompany us up the mountain to enjoy the beautiful view of the top of the mountain. Thousands of cabins and Changping Lake have a panoramic view. I want to wait for winter to spring, the scenery will be even better. Regarding diet, the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very rich, with a wide range of Chinese and Western styles, and even picky eaters are full every morning. The local specialties of Yanlaixuan are also very delicious, and the staff actively ask customers if they are satisfied to make improvements. In addition, thanks to Mr. Yao from Sen Xiaoguan. The child wants to eat watermelon. The delivery service is already past 8pm on the 31st. Mr. Yao asked me to add WeChat directly and communicate with the kitchen immediately after understanding my needs. I sent us two large boxes of watermelons and a large box of oranges and cantaloupe. The child was very happy. This has far exceeded the amount we paid. Thank you for your care for the child. Happy times are always fleeting. When we return, my child and I are a little reluctant. I think we have fallen in love with Senbo and look forward to the next meeting. I wish all the staff of Senbo Happy New Year 2022, smooth work and good luck in the Year of the Tiger!

On the occasion of the New Year, I brought a family to a parent-child tour that just left. The schedule is not very far. Therefore, under the recommendation of many parent-child tours, I decided to take Xiaobao to come here for a one-stop tour.
Before the trip, I was afraid of the epidemic situation and the accommodation environment. I directly contacted the hotel. The reception staff answered all the questions carefully and patiently.
I have to say that the performance is quite perfect in setting up play sessions, child care, and various service details. New Year's Day has arranged a lot of activities, bonfire party, blessing drifting bottle, climbing, etc... Thank us here. Feihu, my housekeeper, and the passion of many beautiful girls
üöó Transportation: Departing from Shanghai, you can arrive safely in about two and a half hours by car.
üßπ Hygiene: Hygiene is in place, at least not messy, and basically no garbage is seen
üçÉEnvironment: The hotel area is very large, but each corresponding area is done very well, the environment is more colorful on the whole, and the details and services are well done
üîîService: Service is the highlight. From the moment of arrival, from helping with luggage and sending balloons, everyone will greet you enthusiastically, welcome you, give directions, and the housekeeper will answer all your questions intimately, and gifts from the room , I don‚Äôt forget to have a small gift before I leave. In any details, it can be said to be quite in place. I have to say that the service is in place for the main parent-child hotel.

Before check-in, the hotel was equipped with a butler service, which was particularly considerate. Our vacation butler, Xiao Kai, was very attentive. He even drove us in a small car to tour the entire scenic spot. I personally help us arrange breakfast and deliver to the room every day.
This time, it is a pity that there is no chance to play in the maintenance of Senbo Park, but it is also very pleasant to live in such an environment for a small vacation. Watching the free-range black swan by the lake is leisurely.
The environmental services are very considerate, but there are too few restaurants in the hotel, and there is no food around the hotel. We all drove to eat outside.
All in all, it is a hotel worth staying at.

üßπHygienic: The carpets in the corridors of Wahliwa are quite dirty. After all, there are people coming and going in public areas. I often see children playing directly on the carpets, which feels very unhygienic. In addition, the sanitation in the room is okay.

First of all, from the environment, the overall decoration style and comfort are very awkward, many soft supporting facilities are also very considerate, and various entertainment items are also loved by the babies. , I would like to thank the housekeeper for being accompanied throughout the whole week. From before check-in to after check-out, reminding breakfast time, arranging food, clothing, housing and transportation, booking various activities, and confirming whether we arrived at the destination safely after leaving the shop.

It is an independent villa at the foot of the mountain, but it is very convenient to make an early reservation with a car to pick up and drop off. Daily toiletries are provided in the room, and the hair dryer is Dyson. There is a large round bed in the room, the bathtub is next to the bed, and the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room are very suitable for viewing the outside scenery. There is a large exclusive lawn behind the house. The children have a good time. The breakfast butler helped me arrange a meal in the Yinzhuli restaurant. , The dishes are quite rich, the fruits are very fresh, the Chinese and Western are combined, the restaurant environment is elegant, and breakfast is comfortable. All conditions are good. The waiters in this hotel are all courteous, warm and thoughtful. Especially the hotel housekeeper Moon Sister, responsive and attentive service, she also gave gifts to the children when she checked out. Will choose this hotel next time.

During the stay, I experienced the Walawaguo Hotel and Holiday Chalet respectively. Walawaguo‚Äôs parent-child entertainment is particularly well done. The children like it very much. The room facilities are very complete, taking into account the many needs of the parent-child family: children‚Äôs toilet mats, step stools, Toiletries, etc., there are public entertainment areas for children in the middle of each floor. The rooms of the holiday wooden house are more comfortable and the scenery is better. It is suitable for holiday and leisure, and it also has a small yard.
Dining: Rainforest Restaurant, with a wide variety of varieties and moderate prices, you don‚Äôt need to worry about what you want to eat with children; Yanlaixuan, suitable for business, parent-child families and the elders, Chinese food tastes good; Senxiaoguan, the most cost-effective, suitable for children to play Have a light meal afterwards.
Entertainment: Water park and fantasy island are all played, unlimited access before 12 o'clock the next day, and free bath towels, lockers, and non-slip socks are also very considerate.

This time, I felt the deepest feeling about the service staff here, especially Nan Nan, the vacation housekeeper, who named and praised, and the service was enthusiastic, caring and attentive. Everyone greets children, adults, and their own colleagues enthusiastically, asking for help, and the shuttle bus is available on call...
Next time, I will visit my family and meet my friends by the way.

  There are water parks, fantasy islands, cute pet gardens, Fula Gardens, number one player, and some outdoor areas such as camping, donuts, etc.
  Depart from Suzhou and arrive in the afternoon for two hours.
  In the afternoon, I took the children to play Fantasy Island first. The children had a great time and went to Fula Garden to see parrots and small fish in the evening.
  On the second day, I clocked in on Fantasy Island again. In the afternoon, I went to the cute pet park to see animals. There are fewer animals in the cute pet area. It would be better if there is an open animal feeding area.
 The little brothers and sisters in the garden greeted the children enthusiastically and gave small gifts when they saw them.
I feel that the facilities can add a little more suitable for small children to play.
Check in again next time!

üçÉEnvironment: The second time I came to Senbo in Moganshan, I originally wanted to book a two-bedroom lakeside, because I stayed for two consecutive nights, one of the nights had no room, so the two-bedroom wooden house ordered by Ctrip came to the hotel receptionist and gave it to me After I recommended Yinzhuli, I realized that it was a newly opened room type in the hotel, so I immediately upgraded to a double-bedded double bedroom accommodation. Special note is ‚ô•Vacation Housekeeper Flying Tiger‚ô•, very attentive, very caring, online at any time. After staying in Yinzhuli, I found it was too intimate. The quality of the mini-bar delivered is good, and the most important thing is that there is a thoughtful service package, which contains baby indoor activity socks, play shoes, anti-mosquito water, iodophor, mask, toy ball , Waterproof phone case, skipping rope. . . For a little reason, the butler helped us upgrade to a gallery suite, which is even better. There is an independent film and television hall, and the sofa in the living room is my favorite.
There is also the quality of the breakfast and the service is great! Independent afternoon tea in Yinzhuli, Chinese afternoon tea that can be eaten as a dinner, small wonton-noodle-dessert-champagne.
üîîService:
Finally, the check-out is also the service of the housekeeper, moving and running, and also gave a small badge and a mascot. Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Feihu again, because I said that the dried bamboo shoots were delicious. Several shops in the hotel couldn't buy the same product from the same manufacturer for a long time. He mailed me a package home again. It was really a service. Online anytime, even after checking out.

Recommended play items: water park ¬∫ fantasy island ¬∫ high altitude adventure (suitable for older children) donuts (bigger children) ¬∫ carriage (can take 6 adults)

msg:Hangzhou children have spring and autumn vacations, so on the last day of the National Day holiday, I went on a trip with my old girl and my family. I booked a two-bedroom villa in a wooden house. One bedroom has a large bed and the other has two single beds (but can be put together, which is larger than the large bed). In the middle of the two bedrooms is a small living room and there is a large balcony outside. It's really greatüëçBecause it was a temporary room, it was a pity that I didn't book a two-bedroom villa near the lake. My brother-in-law said it would be nice to save some for the next time. Our room type has butler service (the basic room type is the main building room is not clear), this time I want to praise and thank the butler Yunchuan (a handsome guy), because my little treasure is unwell, it was 9 o‚Äôclock in the evening I vomited, but in the afternoon I bought a one-year-old and one-small double park (Water Park and Neverland) package, thinking that I would not be able to play the water park the next day, so I tried to ask if I can refund the ticket? It was 11 o'clock in the evening, and he was still actively helping to contact the ticket office to solve the problem. In the end, he agreed to refund the package, but the Neverland tickets that I played in the afternoon were still to be bought. I think the result of this trea**ent is reasonable and humane. After breakfast the next day, Yunchuan waited for me to refund the ticket at the ticket office. He also told me that he checked my baby‚Äôs symptoms on the Internet and reminded me of precautions. It was very touched, indicating that he is a detail-oriented person. When I checked out, I called the front desk directly and called the shuttle bus, but when I opened the door, I saw him also come to see us. Finally, I made a special trip to the parking lot to send us dolls and mosquito stickers. Senbo, the hotel details are in place, baby's footstool, small toilet rack, small slippers, nightgown, small teeth set are all available, even diapers are available, but only L size, no bigger size. . The baby hasn't stopped urinating PP at night. Sen Sen Supermarket sells Paragon but only L size. The recommended size is more perfect; Sen Bo, the service staff are in place. As mentioned earlier, my baby vomited, so I asked the hotel for a little rice, salt and side dishes, and prepared to cook porridge in the middle of the night to replenish electrolytes for the baby. The hotel staff and Yunchuan took the trouble to meet my request. Thank you very much. At this time, I will bring my baby to stay at Senbo and recommend Senbo to my friends. ps: This certain tripod mini kettle in the second picture of Amway everyone, take it when you go out, boil water and make things great!

If you want to see other special ones, you can buy tickets to go to the next door. A small forest garden and raccoons can be touched ‚ù§Ô∏è In short, I‚Äôm very satisfied if it‚Äôs not because my dad has something to leave temporarily, I would like to stay one night, the baby sleeps very peacefully at night, and the housekeeper Azheng is still dealing with our needs until 10 o‚Äôclock in the evening.

It is nearly an hour‚Äôs drive from Hangzhou to the hotel. I checked in early at noon. I put down my luggage and rested. I reserved an outdoor project. The kids liked the donut project and kayaking. I saw the beautiful black swan on the lake and the water park. It‚Äôs not very big, but it‚Äôs enough for fun. It‚Äôs now in the off-season. There are not many people in the water park, and the staff is almost one-on-one. In the evening, I went to the rainforest restaurant for dinner, 188 yuan per person, the environment is fantastic, the meals It's also quite rich, but the buffet is just dazzling, and there are only a few favorites in the end, but it saves the trouble of ordering. After having breakfast the next day, I went to Fantasy Island. In the middle was a big ship with a mermaid that girls liked üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è on the bow. The others were trampolines, slides, little girls‚Äô princess rooms, extremely slow go-karts..., I feel that Fantasy Island is suitable for walking babies under 6 years old. Parents have comfortable lazy couches to lie on. Finally, go to the video game city to play games...
Personally, if a parent-child trip is more suitable for children under the age of 12 to play, check in the day before and check out at noon the next day, the time is just right. By the way, we booked a double room in Wawaliwa Country, which includes Water Park & Fantasy Island 1 large and 1 small, Flora Garden, two breakfasts, and 20 game coins, a total of 959. Outdoor projects require additional tickets.

As soon as I entered the hotel, although there were a lot of people during the holidays, the hotel staff were more enthusiastic. After checking in, there was a shuttle bus to take us to our wooden house. Although the room is not very big, it is clean and there are welcome fruits. , I added the WeChat of the vacation housekeeper Azhe, and I will reply to my needs at any time. Every time slot also tells us when to eat. If the shuttle bus is busy, you can ask the housekeeper to help you pick up and drop off. It makes people feel very comfortable! You need a shuttle bus to get in and out of the hotel. You can follow WeChat and place an order on WeChat at any time. It is similar to Didi. For breakfast, it is quite rich. If you don‚Äôt have a big belly, you may not fit it. By the way, the biscuits are especially delicious. , But there are a lot of people in the queue, so you can only take two at a time, maybe it's due to holidays! There are also many amu*****t facilities in the hotel, suitable for children of all ages, and there are also hosting services. Reliable! We were three days and two nights, the first day was to play in the water park, the indoor constant temperature! The next day we played Fantasy Island and Cute Pet Paradise, the number one player~ In short, this Mid-Autumn Festival trip
The trip made us quite satisfied. Thanks to our housekeeper, Azhe, I have already checked out, haha, let me know that I want to give a small gift! The staff of the entire hotel are very heartwarming, and I hope that I will come to Moganshan Senbo again if I have the opportunity! (The above personal check-in views, you can refer to it)

This is the first time I stayed in Senbo. It is the first time I feel that domestic resort hotel services can do this. It is really good! Every receptionist, even the aunt, greeted each other with a smile. There is a shuttle bus from the lodging point or the hotel lobby, and you can make an appoin**ent with a small program. The bus ride is basically two minutes, which is very convenient.
The room, the family of three decided to be a wooden house this time, except that there is no bathtub, everything else is available, and there is a small yard where you can bask in the sun and see the flowers and plants.
Entertainment facilities, the hotel has a water park, fantasy island, game room, and a botanical garden, all indoors, suitable for summer.
Outdoors, there are kayaking, mini golf, grass-skiing, etc. If the weather is too hot, there is no experience. . .
For dining, there are Chinese restaurants, buffets, and Western restaurants in Genting, as well as late-night snack shops.
The one serving us is the housekeeper Chen Ji, responsive and good service, I give full marks üòÅ
The only downside is that we avoid the crowds to eat in the morning, and we don‚Äôt know what we are doing after 8:30, because all the interiors are open until 10, so we can only go back to the wooden house to restüôÉ

msg:I have seen a lot of recommendations for Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo Holiday Park before. Shu assumed the itinerary. Because of the delay of the epidemic, I finally got my wish during the National Day holiday.
Environment: The environment of the hotel is very good. We ordered a wooden house. The room is not big, but it is clean and tidy. The hotel facilities are complete. The rooms are equipped with mosquito killers, children‚Äôs toiletries, etc. The restaurant has tableware and hand wipes specially prepared for children. There are parent-child shower rooms in the water park. Each shower room has a shelf for easy bringing children. Parents put things. Highlight the details everywhere, you can see the intentions.
Service: Very enthusiastic, as long as there are staff members wherever they pass, they will greet enthusiastically. They are in a good mood all day long. Pick up the car in time, usually within 5 minutes after you make a phone call, which is very convenient. My butler, Nobita, paid attention to our needs from the moment we checked in, took us to visit the park, suggested itineraries for us, and sent messages every day to remind me of the precautions. It was really fine, and it saved us a lot of trouble.
Play: There are many amu*****t items in the park. Horseback riding and archery are popular items that children like. The water park and fantasy island even enter and don't want to come out. We also participated in the custody service of the little firefighters. Sister Lychee, Brother Little Tiger, and Brother Happy took the children to experience various scenes, taking care of them with great care. Parents can free their hands. It is really a good news for parents.
Although there are a lot of people during the National Day holiday, the entire park does not feel messy and has no bad experience whether it is in vehicles, accommodation, dining or playing. It can be seen that the management of the park is very standardized and orderly. Looking forward to the next trip to Kaiyuan Senbo

The service attitude is super good, and the little brothers and sisters are not stingy with their smiles. This time we live in Waliwa country. Once we enter the lobby, it will give people a very kawaii and warm feeling. The concierge at the door was also polite. The car was already standing at the door waiting for you before the car stopped, and would take the initiative to help you with your luggage. Butler Moon's service is also super good, will send you various time points, any problems will be solved for you, great! In the afternoon we checked in, we went to play in the water park, but this day it was a bit cold to play in the water park. The children had a great time playing, and they could enter infinitely by brushing their faces that day. Fantasy Island did not go in due to time issues, so you must go to play next time! The dinner was eaten at Yanlaixuan, the taste and portion were great! The buffet breakfast on the second day was in the rainforest restaurant. There will be a fairy sister at the door greeting the children. The restaurant is divided into a children‚Äôs dining area and an adult dining area. There are many varieties. The noodles for the buffet breakfast are angry. Then I dug a spoonful of noodles. Covered with pork sauce, it was so delicious that it flew up. My husband ate two bowls! The duck blood vermicelli soup is also delicious. The vermicelli is the kind of sweet potato vermicelli, which tastes sweet and breaks, unlike the one that is glued and will not break! There is a shuttle bus to and from the hotel and restaurant, which is very convenient! There are not too many animals in the cute pet paradise. A bag of carrots is 10 yuan, and the animals in it are also very cute! This time, Kaiyuan Senbo in Moganshan is a pleasant vacation, and it is a place where children will go again in the later period!

msg:The child has been clamoring to stay in a hotel. My father originally planned to find a hotel in Lujiazui without going out of Shanghai, but my child and I thought it was boring to just sleep in the hotel and not play, so after several screenings, the child finally chose this place. It‚Äôs the Mid-Autumn Festival, so there are almost no room types to choose from. The log cabin senior suite is the only available room type. It takes more than two hours from Shanghai. It covers a very large area and you can eat, drink, play and live. It is especially suitable for parents and children, and you are not tired. .
Meals:
The breakfast is plentiful and it is very comfortable to eat. Although there are many people during the peak breakfast period on holidays, it is relatively orderly. There is a leader at the entrance of the restaurant and there are many service personnel, so guests in the hotel will not be embarrassed because they can't find a seat.

Service standardization:
Almost the staff seen by the naked eye will take the initiative to greet the guests. No matter who you find, your request will be resolved on the spot. This is very good, especially the little sister Meng Yuanmin, who is very beautiful, gentle and careful. During the stay in the store, she received a lot of questions and answers and solutions to the problems encountered. On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the outdoor high-altitude project of the mine began to implement the appoin**ent system. Yuanyuan reminded us in time and confirmed what time we will go to play and help make an appoin**ent in advance, especially Coincidentally, I met her just after arriving at the hotel. I didn't expect that our housekeeper was also her. It was a great fate, because Yuanyuan's thoughtful and meticulous care made our trip more enjoyable. grateful!

remind:
Dinner: The rainforest restaurant is a buffet, relatively rich and comfortable to eat, but if it is a holiday period, it is recommended that the restaurant is open immediately, 6:30-7:00 basically it is impossible to enter in long queues

Yan Laixuan: Basically start to wait at 6:30 in the evening
Genting Western Restaurant: Need to make an appoin**ent 4 hours in advance


Areas to be improved:
Cute pet paradise area: It would be better if the ticket sellers were gentle
Breakfast area: the solution to the congestion problem in the noodle soup area

When I arrived at Senbo, I discovered that it was divided into a marvelous hotel and a resort hotel. I was confused at the fork of the road. Fortunately, I entered the hotel and ran into Keke. Keke gave me a detailed description of the hotel distribution and upgraded it for us. The lake-view room in the resort hotel, from the waliwa country to the resort hotel, it feels extraordinary. In fact, I originally thought that the country was quite suitable for children, but it was really noisy and the room was not as good as the a**osphere of a resort hotel. The most important thing is that the main building is close to places to play and eat, so there is no need to take a shuttle bus.
It's also very convenient to go back to the room and take a bath when playing in the water world.
Next time, I will have to be the main building, facing the lake view, it feels similar to the cabin. It is convenient to go anywhere. Buying a coffee in the lobby and buying a milk tea in an ice cream cart are also very convenient. Just walk for breakfast.
Keke also booked dinner for you at Genting Restaurant. To be honest, the scenery and service at Genting Restaurant are really good.
The hotel also prepared small gifts for the children. Before leaving, it rained a bit. Keke also reminded to pay attention to safety.
And no matter where you go, there are enthusiastic staff and children to greet you. It really feels like a home away from home hotel. Although there are a lot of people on Saturday, the service is always online.
Will continue to brush the second hotel.

When it‚Äôs raining heavily, the doorman still takes care of the umbrella and luggage
Xiao Meng, the vacation housekeeper, contacted + WeChat one day in advance and learned about the child's situation. He would remind me of the precautions and was enthusiastic and polite. The check-in was also arranged in a timely manner. Basically, I arrived at the store at 3 o'clock and checked in smoothly. The first time I came, I chose the waliwa country parent-child room that the child likes. The average daily room rate is 2700. The room is really mini, and the price is average, but the child likes high and low beds. The housekeeper will tell the recommended dining spots every day and make a small suggestion. The small gifts given are slightly suitable for the children's age.
Basically, I have never been out in the hotel for three days. It is recommended that guests who stay in the hotel buy tickets on the spot to play until 12 o‚Äôclock the next day. The parent-child ticket (double park) is 550. The water park changing room and dressing room are very good. It is clean, and there are few people in the morning, and there is basically no need to line up for big projects~ Fantasy Island is more suitable for young babies to play~
If you eat, I would recommend a Chinese restaurant. Compared with the buffet, the taste and quality are better!
If the room rate is slightly more suitable, I will consider coming back next time!

We stayed in a holiday chalet suite. Although it is far from the center of the hotel, it is very convenient to take a shuttle bus. It has been raining these few days, and there is no need to worry about getting caught in the rain with the shuttle bus.
In terms of catering, Yanlaixuan on the first floor tastes very good, and the amount is quite large. There are three or two dishes for a family of three. When I left, I couldn't help but bought two boxes of specialty dried bamboo shoots üòÅ The rainforest restaurant on the second floor had a buffet. There are really many varieties. I have one of the more buffet varieties in the hotel I have stayed in. The taste is also good.
In terms of play, there are a lot of indoor fantasy island amu*****t equipment, slides, ocean ball projection, maze, climbing, etc., to meet the needs of children of all ages. Anyway, my son stared at the ocean ball to play. The water park is really fun.

From parking at the door to help push the luggage to check-in and then to shuttle bus pick-up, etc., the staff in various positions of the hotel can actively guide and arrange. Then here I would like to thank the hotel butler A Zheng in particular. From before check-in to check-out, the young man gave reminders and arrangements online in a meticulous and enthusiastic manner. He sent a cake on the first day, game coins on the second day, and prepared gifts for the children when checking out on the third day. He was really thoughtful and must be given a big thumbs up.
The hotel's buffet breakfast has a rich variety of Chinese and Western styles. I think it should be able to meet the requirements of most people. For dinner, I tried the Rain Forest Buffet and Yan Lai Xuan. For Yan Lai Xuan, two adults and one child really couldn't order any dishes and spent nearly 500. The Rain Forest Buffet Restaurant cost 504 for two adults and one child. At about the same price, the Rain Forest Buffet with more varieties is more recommended.
Indoor water park, I came here for this. One adult and one child were 386 at the hotel ticket office. I bought tickets at the hotel ticket office at around 1 pm on the same day. The staff reminded that you can enter and exit unlimited times by face scanning before 12 o'clock the next day. The two blue wristbands can be used to scan the code storage box. One is used per day, perfect.
Summer housing prices are expensive, and summer weekend housing prices are expensive. I couldn't book a room at first, but because I had been paying attention, I later saw a non-cancellable holiday cabin suite with an average price of 3,000 per night, so I made up my mind and booked it. After booking, I found that the typhoon fireworks might come, and I thought about the non-cancellation, which made me feel a little nervous. Fortunately, the weather was good on the day of departure, and I arrived safely. Then on the day of check-in, I saw that other more cost-effective room types on Ctrip were available. I did feel unhappy for a while, but after three days and two nights of stay, it was nothing. Especially in terms of service, it is still worthy of recognition. The children also had a lot of fun. Thanks again to the housekeeper A Zheng and all the staff of Senbo, you have worked hard.

        There are many kinds of breakfast, and the taste is great! After staying in the hotel for a few days, there are 4 restaurants in the hotel, except for the Genting restaurant. Personally, I feel that the Mori Restaurant, which only opens at 8 pm, has a bad taste, but the other two are good, the buffet is cost-effective, and there are a lot of Chinese restaurants.
        The water world of the hotel has a good sense of experience for in-house guests. It provides bath towels, storage boxes, and unlimited access. The lazy river in the water world can really complain about it, rent a double circle, and stay in the river without moving, relying on the staff to push us all the way, it is too boring, too lazy!

Although it is quite hot during the day, it is still a little cooler in the evening, and the temperature is lower than in the city.

msg:I regretted not reading the reviews before. I booked a two-bedroom villa for a week, which can be said to be the worst experience ever! Forget about ants on the bed, forget about being bitten by unknown bugs, forget about queuing up for a meal, forget about dirty tableware and greasy food, understand without a swimming pool, at least there is a water Paradise, but after a while in the water park, the eyes hurt unbearably. The sensor door caught the child and didn‚Äôt care about it. It‚Äôs normal to call a battery car and wait for 20 minutes. The worst thing is that the seesaw design of the sandpit has never been seen before. , very heavy wood without any damping, the handles on it are made of metal and look like iron, when the other child comes off the seesaw, it hits the child's leg directly, and immediately swells, and the child pats his leg in pain and cries desperately, contact The housekeeper told us the exact location, but no one came. We stopped the shuttle bus and arrived at the shuttle bus parking area on the first floor of the hotel. When we got there, there was no one to take care of us. The 37-degree weather made us carry our children to the second floor. After requesting to wait for more than ten minutes, a little girl came to accompany me to the hospital for emergency trea**ent. Then no one followed up, there was no greeting, it was all flickering. One pushes one, and the next day is approaching noon, a person who claims to be customer service comes to inform the result: I have been accompanied to the hospital, and it is not broken anyway, they paid for the filming and registration fee of tens of dollars, and what is so-called as a gift? Room Vouchers Welcome back! We did not accept any so-called coupons for a few cents and will not come again. Because the child can‚Äôt walk, I need to cancel the next itinerary, and I need to provide medical trea**ent materials. Only then did I find that the medical records given to me by the staff accompanying the hotel were blank. I asked the hotel to complete them. They said that the medical records in Deqing are all electronic. , it should be blank, and it has not been replenished until leaving the hotel. I don't know why you refused to provide it, your hotel knows best. Because I couldn't accept the hotel's arrogance and rudeness, I couldn't bear to call the police. I waited in the lobby for a long time and it was almost one o'clock. Anyway, it didn't stop! There is nothing wrong with my own hotel anyway! No empathy at all, full of greasy! Yes, fortunately no major fractures were caused, but the doctor said that small fractures could not be ruled out, so I couldn't walk, and it hurt only because of the swelling. And the so-called docking person in your mouth is either not answering the phone or not answering the message. From the beginning to the end, the customer service asked me a non-painful question, and told me that I couldn't walk, so I didn't care about it. It seems that no one cares about the communication, or just push it to the next person, but in fact, no one has really understood and cared, and I haven‚Äôt seen who you mentioned. From the beginning to the end, before calling the police, there were two People, one is the little girl who accompanied me to the doctor, do you know the supervisor best, and the other is near noon when I leave the store, claiming that the customer service is talking about dozens of medical expenses, and the case is told that there is no way to supplement the injury certificate. law out. I haven't seen one before, and I don't know who it is until the police come. I don't know who it is. The so-called deputy general manager in your mouth has never seen him before the police. We don‚Äôt know who was called after the police, because he didn‚Äôt provide a business card or an ID card or any identity proof. He talked like this in front of the police. Could it be that the hotel uses it? Exclusive personnel to deal with customers? Is it for accidents? Is the person in the picture the deputy general manager of the hotel? Who is it? Why refuse to provide any identification? Why did we call the police and provide identification, why can the other party not provide it? ! What gave you the courage to be so arrogant? Where are the competent authorities for so many safety hazards in such a hotel and such a facility? Is it possible to ignore everything just to make money? Isn't it too ugly to eat! Are your services and facilities worthy of such a high price? Eat bad money in the name of parent-child! Taking advantage of parents' eagerness to love their children, children's money is easy to earn, but do you have a conscience for earning money like this? ! ! Strongly urge the relevant depar**ents to check the water quality of their water parks and various safety hazards for the health of children! Thanks to the Deqing police for calling the police. Even if the police went to the hotel, they didn't say sorry! No apology at all! Is there still humanity? This is the arrogance of Kaiyuan Senbo!

The hotel felt very good. There are many amu*****t projects, and the shuttle bus is also very convenient. For the Ctrip order issue, Ma Ruixue at the front desk also gave enthusiastic help, patiently solved the problem and gave me feedback.

The day before we just arrived, there will be a call from the front desk and ask me to mention the room requirements. I want to be by the lake and then the front desk So he gave me a housekeeper. The housekeeper added me to WeChat that night. The warm-hearted housekeeper called Azhe. Maybe he will be more heart-warming this trip. He came to help us arrange the accommodation and opened the room to help us arrange it. After the car was delivered, there was a series of enthusiastic reminders from the housekeeper that I forgot to bring my swimsuit and wasted a lot of time while playing in the water. I wasted a lot of time buying swimsuits and Xiaobao and I had a very comfortable meal! The food in the scenic spots in my impression is indeed not satisfactory, but the Chinese restaurant recommended by Azhe is also a must-see. The Chinese restaurant is in line with our taste and tastes almost the same as the tea restaurant, which is considered delicious! I really don‚Äôt have to worry about anything when I live here. Why don‚Äôt you want to ask the butler when you go out. The butler also gave us 2 game coins of the number one player the next day. It was a great time to play! When we were leaving, Azhe‚Äôs butler would help us lift the luggage into the car and gave Xiaobao a small gift. Xiaobao was also very happy. On the way back, he kept saying that this brother is really good! All in all, the journey may be very laborious, but it‚Äôs not exhaustion that brings me to this Senbo, and it‚Äôs comfortable and caring. You just need to open your mouth and play.

My daughter's favorite is the two parrots at the entrance of Water World, Bobo and Sensen. The two parrots quarrel with each other and comb each other's feathers. Unlike the two in Hangzhou, which are both depressed, the parrots here are quite cheerful. The gift shop is also very rich in toys, and I go shopping almost every day. We bought the colorful sequined python and the screaming parrot that our daughter likes. Finally, I would like to praise the vacation housekeeper Azhe. He contacted us in advance and added vx. After learning that the little friend was a little constipated, he immediately brought bananas and dragon fruits. On the last day, I also gave a special gift, thank you.

Before leaving, he came to the door of the room to pick us up and carry the luggage all the way to the parking lot! Thank you very much for the butler‚Äôs care during our stay! For our families with children, the experience is very good. It can be seen that the hotel management is in place! There are also many hotel facilities and amu*****t items, and the cafeteria has many varieties, which is very suitable for children. It is very happy to play for three days and two nights.

msg:A family hotel worth visiting! The time for three days and two nights is still not enough, and the schedule is full. The children praised Mommy's great arrangement this time! Let‚Äôs talk about all aspects...
Room: I decided to have a double-bed room in the country. The price was set at 1,800 a night in early June. I personally feel that the price is too high. The room is very compact. If it is not a parent-child hotel, this layout design is an ordinary standard room in other hotels. The price.... The person next door ordered it as early as 800, the price difference is too big... I suggest that if you come to play in the peak season, it will be more cost-effective to book as early as possible. The welcome fruits and drinks in the room are not bad, but the sanitation is very general, the floor is not clean when entering the room, so you can't take a closer look. It‚Äôs not bad that the bathroom has a dry hanger, but it is used for a fee.... The room is only given to the room after check-in at three o'clock, and check-out is quick.
Butler: When staying at resorts like this, you have a butler service. We will add WeChat before you check in and give some suggestions from time to time. It's convenient. If you have any questions, you can ask at any time. The service is called Moon for me. The service is good.
Catering: Nothing but nothing, breakfast tropical rainforest restaurant, rich choices, dinner and lunch, we all order Chinese food at Yanlaixuan, and the price/performance ratio is not bad.
Facilities: For the parent-child hotel, it can be said that the project settings are very rich... The water park and the fantasy island are great. It is recommended to see if the tickets are included in the package and it will be more cost-effective. We all buy it alone, say yes You can enter multiple times at 12 o'clock the next day, but you will actually enter at most 2 times. If the time is tight, it will not be economical. The content to play is still very good. In addition, there are many outdoor items to choose from. It turns out that this one also costs money.... There are many kinds of package options. When we go there, the temperature rises. Outdoors, we usually go in the morning or evening. Very few people basically book the venue, which is okay. The charging items of the cute pet park are a bit pitted... Be careful, the cute pet park is the most boring I find, there are few animals, most of the time, it is also closed, and there is a charge for interaction. It‚Äôs better to watch the zoo...
Service: Overall okay, people say hello everywhere, but I feel that the training in the park is very characteristic, that is, employees in one area basically only know about their area, and they don‚Äôt know anything about other entertainment projects... I hope it can be integrated. After training, tourists are all active after all. For example, the employees in the area where the shuttle bus is concentrated do not even know the location of the hotel parking lot... But there are also very good services, and the shuttle bus driver Xu Hao has a very good service attitudeüëç
The overall feeling is quite satisfactory. The trump card hosting in the parent-child project is especially recommended. It frees mothers' hands and the baby has fun.
All in all, it is a good choice for family members to come here to have fun. It would be better to choose the off-season to experience it. Next time I plan to visit Hangzhou Senbo.

Nothing is suitable for children! It's also a parent-child hotel! The room is at most a standard room with a little cartoon element! I really don't understand why the reviews on Xiaohongshu are so high! Some people say they want to go there twice! Don't be fooled again! There are more than a dozen of us going to four rooms! None of them are good! The experience is invincible! I think I have a lot of travel experience, and I have stayed in many resort hotels, parent-child hotels, clubmed, Haiyue, and even Shaoxing Water World are much better than this! ! It's a waste! There is not even a convenience store. A bottle of water costs 10 yuan, which is almost as good as Disney. They will give you a bottle of Coke, Sprite and milk every day. Our family of three only drinks these 3 bottles a day? I can accept the high price of the restaurant, but you don't have to take out the leftovers from the previous day as the next day's buffet breakfast! There is not a single fresh seafood in the evening buffet! The dishes are all fried rice and fried noodles! Too oily! You have to queue for more than 15 minutes for fried eggs, rice balls and pancakes! You can figure it out yourself! Friends who ate more than half of the meal all had diarrhea. I really don't know why it is full every day! All the money is used for promotion and advertising! Blacklist for life!

Their characteristic is small wooden houses of various shapes. This time they chose a superior wooden house suite with a small living room, so you don't have to stay in the bedroom all the time. It's really practical. Special thanks to the housekeeper, Ah Zheng, who added me to WeChat a few days in advance to tell me the weather conditions and precautions. I asked him to reply as soon as I had a question. Before leaving, he prepared gifts and local characteristics for us.
Finally, I recommend the outdoor characteristic mines in Mogan Mountain. There are high-altitude adventures inside. It is a bit like the Amazon in Shanghai. Of course, it is better than the Amazon environment because of the embrace of nature, which can give children to practice courage.

The place is bigger, the air is better, and it is newer. Indoor water parks and children's parks are almost not afraid of any weather. Outdoors there are amu*****t projects such as kayaking, spider web climbing, and cute pet paradise. This time, I added the trump card hosting service. The child was completely handed over to the staff for 3 hours, and they took the child to explore the treasure all the way. The child really liked Sister Yaya. There is also the caring butler, Keke, who knows that her daughter is celebrating her birthday this time. He has provided super caring room decorations and small cakes, giving the child a full surprise! The only shortcoming is that there are a lot of people during the summer vacation, and there is also a queue for buffet meals. No way, it‚Äôs the same everywhere, the golden holiday~

It is highly recommended. This time we stayed in a two-bedroom lakeside villa with a living room and two rooms. Sitting on the balcony, we could see black swans coming over to eat. The hotel also has a shuttle bus. Just make a phone call. The staff are also very enthusiastic. Our room has a dedicated housekeeper. Our vacation housekeeper, Flying Tiger, is also very enthusiastic. He always keeps in touch with WeChat and often asks what he needs. On the day of check-out, a shuttle bus came to take us to the parking lot and help us carry our luggage. It was very, very enthusiastic. Both Water World and Fantasy Island are indoors. Although there are many people, the place is big, so there is basically no queue. The breakfast is delicious and plentiful, but there are too many people to queue up, but it should be common to line up during summer vacations. Generally speaking, during the summer vacation, the hotel is crowded, but it is still very orderly.

msg:I booked the lake-view double room on the fifth floor of the main building. I was lying on the bed and looking at the blue sky and white clouds. It was really comfortable. The bed and pillows in the room were more comfortable than those in many hotels, not very soft, and the breakfast was very poor. So, it takes a long time to line up to eat a poached egg, can't you make one more person to fry it? The most speechless thing is that there is no underground parking lot. Either parked in a nearby open-air parking lot, or parked in a small indoor parking lot nearby/very limited parking spaces. Many of the parking spaces are occupied by the hotel‚Äôs shuttle bus. The hotel management is very messy, and no one reminds that you need to scan the code to park in the indoor parking lot. As a result, you have to pay the parking fee and negotiate with the hotel. It is an uncomfortable itinerary.

msg:In June 2020, I came to Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo for the first time and stayed at Waliwaguo Hotel-the price at that time was really cheap, 799 yuan for two nights! ! ! ‚Äî‚Äî I strayed into the Cailupo Holiday House villa group on the last day, and made a wish at that time: I must do it again.
On Double Eleven in 2020, I grabbed the Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo Hotel voucher, and made an appoin**ent with a good friend. After we finished the one-note exam in May, the two families would travel together. The test ended smoothly (but I said, I have been taking the test for 8 years anyway...), everything was perfect, except for the sudden illness of the child two days before the trip...so all plans were invalidated, and I was busy contacting the hotel for instructions. The staff of Kaiyuan Senbo was very friendly, understood our situation, and helped to cancel the reservation and refund, and no economic loss occurred.
Probably because of this friendliness, although the coupons that were snapped up on Double Eleven were gone, I was determined to come, so I waited two weeks for the child to recover and saw that there were still houses on the weekend of June on Ctrip, so I immediately placed an order to confirm Up.
I booked a chalet vacation suite, including rides and dinner. The price of one night is close to 3000, which is a few times the price of the last time I visited the hotel............ But the joy this trip brought us still made me I deeply felt it was worth it-we visited the water park, we drank beer and chatted in the cabin, we saw the fireflies flickering outside the balcony, and we walked slowly to watch the small villas on the mountain like scattered lights. Day 2: The children screamed happily in Fantasy Island, we feasted in the rainforest cafeteria, and rode to the outdoor activity area of the mine pit together after dinner-really have such a time, so gentle, you can take the troubles of work and the hard work of adults The sorrow of parenting was completely entrusted to the breeze in the valley during the free conversation with his companions, and temporarily forgotten.
At this moment, I can only deeply feel: It‚Äôs great to spend money...
Finally, I would like to thank the staff of Kaiyuan Senbo and Dandan, the vacation housekeeper, for introducing and coordinating early and arranging room selection. The cleaning lady, because we applied for a late check-out, we had to clean up the room within a limited time. It was really hard work. There is also the driver's brother, who is busy driving the shuttle bus back and forth. Because of the hard work of these staff, we can make our consumption worthwhile and spend a good time in Moganshan Kaiyuan Senbo.

Regardless of whether it is rainy or sunny, the scenery from the balcony is very good. The dinner buffet is included when I book the room. I can give it five stars in terms of quality, environment or service. On the day of the baby‚Äôs birthday, the hotel also gave a thoughtful cake. If you want a whole big cake, you can also make an appoin**ent by phone one day in advance for free. In addition, the water world has a constant temperature indoors, so you can play even in winter. The internal facilities are complete and new. Both the locker room, shower room and toilet have parent-child rooms with spin dryers. The lake view room we ordered is also equipped with a butler. Our butler is Ah Zheng. I have to say that the service is really attentive and attentive. We have considered all aspects, including the cakes we gave, and the little gifts we checked out. He was all prepare.

msg:I just don‚Äôt know where so many people‚Äôs good reviews come from. First, I arrived at the hotel at 1:30 on the day of check-in. The front desk said that we can check in at 3 o‚Äôclock. Let‚Äôs store our luggage and take the children to play first. We will send a short message when we can check in later. Or call, and did not wait until four o'clock to get the news that you can check in. You went to the front desk to ask, and said that the cleaning had been expedited, so you continued to wait, and it took almost ten minutes before you received a call that you could check in. Second, when I went out to eat at night, I didn‚Äôt check the three room cards carefully and brought the wrong power distribution card. The room card was locked in the room. I called the front desk at nine o‚Äôclock and no one answered. I don‚Äôt know what their phone settings are. I can't believe that no one answered the phone at the front desk of such a big hotel. No one answered the call until the ninth call. During the period, when no one answered the phone, we called the master of the shuttle bus and said that we needed to open the door. The master said to help us later Contact, let us wait at the door of the room. After waiting for more than ten minutes, there was no movement. At this time, the front desk got through the phone and said that a staff member would come to open the door, and it took about ten minutes before the door opened. Third, at 7:00 p.m., a staff member called to ask about the experience of check-in. I said that the waiting time for check-in was too long. The staff said they were sorry and said that they could give away 60 game coins. They also said that the housekeeper would add me to WeChat soon. You can talk to the housekeeper if you have any questions, but we didn‚Äôt receive any WeChat messages from the housekeeper until we checked out the next day, and then went to the front desk to ask for a coupon for game currency. Fourth, the hardware facilities of the hotel are really good. The mineral water, fruit and drinks are provided, and the breakfast buffet is also very rich. However, the environment such as greening, including the lake surface, is really not agreeable. There are ****s on both sides of the road, and there are also ****s on the lake surface Lots of sewage bubbles. Fifth, there are indeed a lot of hotel staff, but either they mean the wrong way, or they let you continue to ask other people, and the parking at the door is messy and disorderly.

It is too suitable for taking children to soak for several days, there is water play, there is an amusement park, children are scattered to play, do not want to go back üòÑ adults are particularly worry-free.
The hotel rooms are always a little musty, and all kinds of holiday wooden houses are quite distinctive and blend in with the surrounding environment. There are a lot of green plants, but there are a lot of ****s and they are not taken care of in time.
Our room is equipped with a butler. If you have anything, you can contact WeChat. It is very considerate and convenient. During this period of time, I am very grateful to the butler Xu Kai for taking care of him. The room connection will be specially sent to pick up the car, and any requirements will be met in time. It is very caring. The hotel is doing very well.

There are many people on holiday and it looks messy. The outdoor parking lot is far away. It was raining for two days and it was inconvenient to travel this time. Later, I found out that there was an underground garage and a shuttle bus, but at first I didn't know that there were too many people, and the staff was too busy to understand it. There are also rooms that are not facing the lake, without any view, which is a bit lost. The coffee shop on the first floor is a bit noisy, can not enjoy coffee quietly, coffee and desserts are good. The staff here are very enthusiastic in service, always smiling and greeted enthusiastically. Erbao suffered a slight injury to his hand, and immediately took disinfection and band-aids.
