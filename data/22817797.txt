msg:During the honey snow trip, I chose the Hilton Xiamen City Plaza as my foothold. Here, I deeply feel the thoughtful service and thoughtful arrangement of the receptionist, which makes me full of gratitude and praise for this hotel.

First of all, I want to praise the little lady at the front desk of the hotel. She is not only smiling, enthusiastic and thoughtful, but also shows meticulous care in details. Whether in check-in or answering my various questions, she has shown a high sense of professionalism and responsibility. This sincere service makes me feel warm, as if I were at home.

Secondly, I was also impressed by the overall service of the hotel. From the cleanliness and brightness of the lobby to the comfort and warmth of the room, every link shows Hilton's high-quality standards. The enthusiasm and professionalism of the hotel staff made me feel the warmth of home. Whether at breakfast time or when you go back to your room at night, you can see their busy figures and provide guests with meticulous services.

In addition, the location of the hotel is also very convenient. It is located in the Huli Torch High-tech Development Zone in Xiamen City. It is very convenient to go to Xiamen Railway Station or Xiamen North Railway Station. And there are many well-known enterprises and scenic spots around, which provide great convenience for business travelers and tourists.

Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with the check-in experience at the Hampton by Hilton Xiamen City Plaza. From considerate service, thoughtful arrangements to high-quality facilities, everything shows the quality of Hilton and the spirit of F.A.C.T. Once again, I thank this hotel for its excellent service and give it a full score. I sincerely recommend the Hampton by Hilton Xiamen City Plaza to all travelers. I hope you can also feel the warmth and happiness of home here.

msg:When I transferred to Xiamen, I chose the Hampton by Hilton Xiamen City Plaza as my short residence. This check-in experience perfectly embodies Hilton's F.A.C.T spirit, which impressed me.

First of all, the location of the hotel is very convenient. It is located in the Huli Torch High-tech Development Zone in Xiamen, a 5-minute walk from the subway station, which is very convenient to travel. Whether it is to Xiamen Railway Station or Xiamen North Railway Station, it is very convenient to get there by subway.

Secondly, the hotel is fully equipped and novel. The room is clean and hygienic, and every detail reflects the quality and dedication. The attitude of the service staff is very good, which makes me feel at home. The choice of breakfast is rich and delicious, and both Western and Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared.

In addition, the environment around the hotel is also very pleasant. SM City Square, Xiamen Culture and Art Center, etc. are nearby, which is very convenient for both shopping and leisure and entertainment. Gulangyu, Wuyuanwan Wetland Park and other tourist attractions are also close at hand, providing travelers with rich tour options.

msg:I stayed at your hotel in Hampton by Hilton Xiamen City Plaza,China  in a multimedia room on October 2, 2023, with the hope of experiencing the high-quality service promised by the Hilton brand. However, I feel compelled to provide feedback on a series of issues I encountered during my stay, which seriously impacted my overall experience.

Firstly, I was struck by the lack of professionalism at the front desk. Upon check-in, there was no information provided about the hotel's facilities, and I was not informed about whether breakfast was included. It was only later that I discovered my room reservation included complimentary breakfast, but unfortunately, I had missed out on this amenity due to the lack of communication. This absence of information made my stay less enjoyable.

Even more frustrating was the significant odor and smoke in the room I was assigned to, which I found unbearable. To make matters worse, I discovered a cockroach in the room's bathroom, a hygiene issue that severely eroded my trust, especially considering this is a Hilton-affiliated hotel.

After I brought these issues to the attention of the front desk, they changed my room. However, the new room had extremely poor soundproofing, and I was disturbed throughout the night by the sound of children crying and activities from the adjacent room, making it very difficult for me to rest.

As a loyal Hilton customer, I am deeply disappointed by this stay. I expected to experience exceptional service and a comfortable accommodation environment at your hotel, but this experience fell far short of my expectations.

I hope that your hotel will take my complaint seriously and take appropriate steps to improve the service and maintain hygiene standards. I look forward to your response to understand how you plan to address these issues.

Had an early flight in the morning (8am) so perfect for overnight stay, since it is close to the airport (10 min. by taxi). Also, since we couldn't make the free breakfast in time, they provided a simple togo breakfast bag (bread, boiled egg, yoghurt, milk). 

Only drawback is the cleanliness of the room, I found a plastic toothpick on the floor, and plastic wrapping in the bathroom. Nothing serious but not up to Hilton brand standards.

Later it became clear that because of covid there were no shuttle services.
Upon checking in they were booking me for 9 nights (while the booking was only for 1) - checking in took forever and I left too early to be able to sample breakfast.

1. There was a drill sound as soon as I entered the room, which was very noisy.
2. The TV in the room could not be turned on. The engineering depar**ent came to repair it but it couldn't be fixed. Finally, it was replaced.
3. There was only one shower cap in the double room.
4. The towel was torn and tattered, like a towel for washing feet.
5. There were live small flies in the bathroom. The front desk actually notified the waiter to deal with it. The handling was just to slap the bugs to death and eliminate the evidence. There was no explanation or comfort to me during the whole process.
6. The bag of the hair dryer was super dirty.
7. The socket for plugging the hair dryer was very loose. I could only hold the hair dryer with one hand and press the socket with the other hand.
8. All the employees never introduced their names when they appeared. I couldn't confirm whether they were the employees. The handling of complaints was also quite perfunctory. It gave me the feeling that our hotel is like this. You can complain as much as you want.

And the hotel starts making all kinds of renovation noises before 8 o'clock in the morning! (The white sheets are the level of allergies that start in the hotel in the morning) This Hilton Hampton has the worst hygiene among all the branches in the cities I have visited. Because I have the habit of bringing silk pillowcases when I go out, I slept until 3 or 4 in the morning on the first night and felt itchy scalp, but I didn't pay much attention to it. The next day, I had mild allergic symptoms on my neck and face. I booked two nights because of a business trip in Xiamen. On the second night, I still felt extremely uncomfortable in my neck and back. I checked out immediately in the morning and took anti-allergic *****. After returning to Guangzhou, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with contact dermatitis! (Infection by mites and other bacteria). I am still taking medicine for the past three days. The symptoms have improved a little, but it affects my normal life. I can't stand it anymore, so I wrote a bad review!

I originally wanted to stay at the Crown in Jimei, but I wanted to go shopping nearby the next day, so I stayed here. For hotels on the island, it may be okay. The toiletries used are Petrov.
The TV wall is really not high-end like this. It looks like a broken wall. The TV is very small and the cable TV is cable. In short, there is no experience.

There was not enough breakfast waiter, no one wiped up the spilled milk, no one collected the finished plates, the coffee machine took 5 minutes to make a cup of coffee, and 30 minutes to wait at the noodle stall, and the bread and other dining areas were not replenished after 9 o'clock. I was speechless.

The hotel breakfast is relatively simple. If you add it separately, it will cost 88 yuan per person, which is a bit expensive and not cost-effective. The room door is not soundproof.

The unpleasant part is that the room is on the second floor, and there are two large banquet halls next door. I don’t know what company was holding an event on the night of check-in, drinking and singing. I was supposed to go out for an early flight and go to bed early, but it was noisy until after 9 o’clock!!! I called the front desk, and the front desk repeatedly asked if I felt it was too noisy, and if I thought I was too troublesome? If it wasn’t noisy, why would I look for it. In addition, the hotel pillows are not ok. The short pillow is broken in the middle, and the tall one is hard, and I wake up a lot in one night. At this price, it’s better to stay at the All Seasons.

msg:Maybe the hotels in Xiamen don’t have underground parking lots, or maybe the prices aren’t that high, so the hotels I’m looking for can only park on the ground. The hotel has a circular layout. There are no windows in this room. There is a smell of smoke when you enter the door. Moreover, when the air conditioner is turned on, it can only heat but cannot adjust the temperature (in the end, I can only turn off the air conditioner to sleep). There is a problem with the network in the room and the wired network connection is not available. So there is no wifi, but you can connect to the network in the next room. The breakfast is very good, and you can also choose some special dishes. It’s good that it’s not far from the attractions.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. Every time it is worse than the last time, and every time it is better than the last time! It only took three things, and I would never stay here again, which also greatly reduced my impression of Xiamen as a tourist city!
First of all, the hardware has no advantages. It is old and dirty. Whether it is the carpet in the public area, the sink in the room (serious water accumulation), the bath towel (it has turned yellow and I dare not use it), or the bedding (no comfort at all) , but considering the star rating, I can't bear it), the price is here, the hardware is not up to the grade, and at least basic hygiene must be done well. There is no comfort at all, just like staying in a guest house!
Secondly, and most importantly, the service is too poor, the front desk has no attitude, is cold and blunt; the service in the breakfast restaurant is chaotic, there are many service staff, but it is basically in a state of disorder, except for standing at the door to check the room number, there is no service. The hotel should really train its service staff!
  I have also stayed at Hilton and Hampton Inns in other cities. This hotel really made me have a good impression of the Hilton brand!

This doesn't matter, but your service must keep up! I went to the restaurant after 8 o'clock and half of the dishes were empty. After waiting for about 15 minutes, three dishes came out and they were cold. After a few minutes, they were gone again. This is the first time I have encountered this situation in a hotel I have stayed in. During the four nights in the hotel, I was woken up by the knocking on the door, the sound of the door closing, and the vibrating sound of the mobile phone at around 6 o'clock every morning. This kind of facility is just a convenient hotel. Calling the service desk was just a perfunctory answer. I don't know the hotel. How to do training? I hope the hotel will pay attention to the opinions of guests so that it can make money.

I have to say that the price of Xiamen hotels during the holidays has increased astonishingly.
This Hilton is located in the Xiaodongshan area of ​​Xiamen. There is a subway 1 kilometer away, an SM mall within 3 kilometers, several restaurants downstairs, and night food stalls at night. The living facilities are relatively convenient.
Before checking in, I carefully read the reviews of other guests and found that many guests felt that this hotel was not good. The environment was noisy and the breakfast was average. But I still believe my first impression and want to experience it myself.
The hotel parking lot is on the first floor, and there are basically sufficient parking spaces. Breakfast did not run out as soon as 8 o'clock as other guests said, but the meals were replenished in a relatively timely manner. The whole environment is relatively clean, the hotel is very quiet at night, and the bed is very comfortable. In addition, the front desk service is very good, and commonly used items such as fruit knives and clothes hangers are prepared for guests.
The only drawback is the laundry room. The hotel provides free laundry, but there are too few washing machines. There are customers waiting in line chatting and smoking in the laundry room.
Generally speaking, the quality of the hotel is between 4 stars and 5 stars, and it is suitable for tourists and business guests.

msg:Hey😑The room is okay, it is big, but there is a smell as soon as you enter the room, like the smell of stinky mop water, which usually occurs after being left for a long time. Our Hilton is fully booked every day and still has this smell. I can bear with it. There is no 24-hour cooling in the corridor and the room. It's called Hilton after all, and it's a mid-to-high-end hotel. It costs six or seven hundred yuan a night, less than a thousand yuan, but it doesn't have basic constant temperature air conditioning. Hahahaha, I can live with it. I came back at 9:40 pm and prepared to take a shower. I'm used to the overhead shower, and as soon as I adjusted it, the adapter fell off. Yellow, yes orange-yellow water sprayed on me, which was disgusting. Then water continued to accumulate in the sink. It was indeed yellow, but too much water was put in, so it turned light yellow. I immediately called the lobby to report it. It was late at night, which was a small peak time for check-ins. There was only one receptionist at the counter. I queued up to ask for a solution. At first, the staff kept saying, "The water is like this. It's yellow here. It's light yellow under warm light. Why don't other guests react? Only you react?" Hahahaha, it was so funny. How could I dare to wash with this water? Oh my god, after going around in circles and changing rooms, the water in the new room was still light yellow. It took almost two hours to coordinate and solve the problem. Finally, I went back to the room and checked the water in our shower again. Ouch!!! It's orange again. I can't lie anymore. I kept saying the water was normal in the early stage. I was really upset. I was wronged for two hours. How can I say it? We are all workers. We can be vague at the beginning. I can understand it. Hahahaha. Later, there was solid evidence and they thought of a solution for us. The service attitude was still very good, but the hardware facilities were really bad. The architectural style was also good. The location was excellent. It was close to SM Plaza and the airport, so I chose to live here. I didn't expect to encounter such a worry. To be honest, please fix your hardware facilities. Take a look at this broken room for yourself. Is it worth the room rate? Speaking of old, this is a 2018 hotel. As usual, it will be better than the International Conference Center in 2016 and the Shangri-La in 2017. Although the star rating may be different, the most basic shower equipment is broken and the guests are allowed to suffer. Is this normal? !

The check-in in the lobby is very considerate, and children are also given special toothbrush sets and slippers. Stay in the Superior Double Room, the room is spacious and bright, with a desk suitable for working and a small sofa for resting. It is worth mentioning the room set service, the quality of the dishes is very good, and the children like the fish ball soup very much.

You can eat and buy things downstairs It is also very convenient, and I may choose it next time.

msg:Very dissatisfied with the hotel facilities! ! But the service of the hotel staff is quite satisfactory.

Dissatisfied with two places:
1. Very dissatisfied! ! ! In the audio-visual room I ordered, the projector couldn't be turned on, so I arranged for someone to come over and fix it for me, but it didn't work out for more than ten minutes, and then I was about to go out, so I asked him to continue working in the room by himself. Before I came back, I was told that it was fixed, but when I came back, the projector showed a green picture, which should be broken. Then it will automatically shut down every 6 minutes, and it takes one minute to restart successfully.

2. Breakfast: Go to eat at 9:35, there are three dishes that are almost empty, I can barely accept it. But if other users see this situation, it is estimated that the hammer will explode. The breakfast environment is good. It is recommended that the hotel inform the customer in advance when giving the room card that breakfast should be eaten early, and some dishes may not be available if it is too late!

The efficiency of the front desk is extremely low, only three or four people checked in, and it took almost 30 minutes for two staff members to work on it before it was my turn. After checking in, I was told to wait for 20 minutes before checking the room. It was already 3 pm at this time, so just wait. I waited for the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes... My temper is always good, I have to get angry and complain before I can enter the room smoothly. I stayed for two days in a row, and when I came back at 3:00 pm the next day, I found that no one had cleaned up the room. After complaining, the answer I got was that I didn't have time to come, so I have to wait! But I would like to praise the eldest sister who cleaned up the room, her attitude and work are very good. Finally, I have to complain about breakfast. There is basically nothing to eat. The coffee machine is broken and no one cares about it. There are no cups. Seeing that everyone uses bowls to hold drinks and tea, I am really speechless!

The result showed that the invoice was invalidated. I called and was told first that the electronic invoice had been issued, and the general invoice was mailed to me, and then it was changed to a special invoice. As a result, the invoice was issued with a bounce and was also invalid, as shown in the picture. After that, I asked the hotel to contact me again on WeChat and told me to issue an electronic invoice to me the next day. I contacted him several times and got no reply. During the time interval, I had to at least reply to me. The hotel's service is getting worse and worse.
In addition, the hotel pillows are not very comfortable to sleep on.
We are still waiting for the invoice. If the invoice is not issued today, we will call and complain to this hotel.

This one must give a negative review. First of all, the parking lot belongs to public property , The parking space depends on luck, basically relying on grabbing. At night, the circle below the hotel is full of barbecue restaurant food stalls. Tables and chairs are placed randomly, which affects the normal traffic of vehicles. Speaking of breakfast, this is the only one I have booked in 10 hotels this time. There is also a breakfast fee for children, 30 yuan. We went to the restaurant after 8 o'clock in the morning. They couldn't find clean bowls and chopsticks, so the last three people each drank a bowl of porridge. You can look at the photos I took. The garbage hotel is the worst Hampton by Hilton I have ever stayed in. Finally, the lady at the front desk is very nice! !

Although the location is slightly remote, next to a community, it takes about 10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the subway station. It's actually not bad, mainly because it's too hot and sunny, so it feels far~
 The surrounding area is very quiet. It’s nice to go for a walk at night.
Didi is very convenient to take a taxi. You can drive directly to the entrance of the lobby and get on the taxi. Overall it is very good~

This is not the point. The point is that the breakfast was served until 10:00. When I went down at 9:45, it was really empty, and then the waiter told me that there was nothing to provide. Next time you have to come earlier, please also understand that this is a buffet that you can choose to eat with meals, there is no need to choose an empty plate to eat.
I found a hotel manager to solve it, and finally cooked two wonton stews and delivered them to the room and refunded the breakfast fee of 30 yuan per person. Really off the mark. In short, the attitude is ok, I really think that it can't get four stars even if it is a three-star standard.

There are all kinds of breakfast, and the fried noodles and small wontons are suitable for children. In the audio-visual room we lived in, we watched Mango Video's Dragon Searching Art and the Nine-Story Demon Pagoda for free on a large projection screen. I don't care about the windowless room. Tourists just sleep at night and spend the day in the scenic spot, so how can I keep looking at the scenery outside the window. There is a Xiaomi air purifier in the room, and there is no peculiar smell. Three-piece bath set: Petrov. Desk Lamp: Philips. Shower toilet: Kohler. The air conditioning and refrigeration system in the summer is very good, it is a bit cold to sleep at 27 degrees, perfect! The nucleic acid testing point in Vientiane City is a 30-minute subway ride away, which is a bit far. It takes 90 minutes to go to Fangte Paradise subway and change to bus. The hotel's food delivery robot delivers meals to the door. I would like to recommend a perfect buffet I found in Xiamen. The last three pictures are seafood buffets. Line 3 takes 7 stops to Xiamen Railway Station, and the exit is Robinson Square. There is a 90-mile self-service seafood steamer in the mall. More than a dozen fresh seafood shells, oysters, prawns, oysters, crabs, salmon. My child and I are very satisfied, the steamer cooks very quickly. Some people eat there with several large plates of oysters. The service at the front desk is very professional and serious. I have a small suggestion: I asked the front desk last night whether it would take 24 or 48 hours for the test report to leave Xiamen. The front desk did not know if I asked. As a service industry, hotels should be familiar with some common travel questions that guests will ask. Overall is quite satisfied, comfortable living, food satisfaction!

The manager sent an air purifier and I barely stayed for two nights. The air purifier broke the meter on the third night. It's a little bit, but it's also smelly. In fact, the corridor is also smelly. Although I won't go there again in the future, I still hope that the hotel can improve this problem. There is a laundry room, but the equipment is a Midea household washing machine and dryer. The Holiday Inn and Mercure Hotel I have stayed in both use LG commercial washing machines and dryers, and there is still a gap in the efficiency of washing and drying. Since we want to provide washing and drying services, it is troublesome to do it properly.

For example, in the decoration of the guest rooms, a large number of wall paintings in the style of ancient Chinese architecture are used, which makes people feel the beauty of classics. The setting of the self-service laundry room allows guests to always dress neatly and feel happy. Children under 1.4 meters are free of breakfast, making Hampan a family traveler. First and foremost, self-service printing in the business center solves the urgent need for business travelers. And the service of Hampton staff is always so warm and caring, I believe they will get better and better.
In particular, I would like to commend the meticulous service and help given by Jiang Lixia from the front office. I will choose Hampton next time.

In addition, there are often nucleic acid detection points on the roadside of the community opposite the hotel, and there are also nucleic acid detection points at the entrance of the nearby Datang Phase V Linjia Hotel.

After all, it was the Hampton series by Hilton, but I was very satisfied after checking in. The hotel’s cleaning method is very novel and convenient. I love cleaning. The aroma of the hotel is rich, the breakfast is rich, and the staff has a good attitude. Because of the satisfactory hotel stay, the whole trip is very colorful.

msg:The hotel is very comfortable. After staying for a few nights, it broke the biological clock of waking up at five o'clock every day; the floor is not high and it is noisy outside, but it is still very quiet after closing the window; when I arrived in Xiamen very late, the little brother at the front desk took the initiative to call and ask about the accommodation. I felt very caring and helped to upgrade a good room; the free laundry service is extremely convenient for tourists who stay for a few days; in addition to calling a car to the hotel, you can also take the 437 bus at the door. Xiamen's bus is 1 yuan, the city is very clean; the hotel's breakfast in the morning is a buffet, and there are not many tricks, but in Xiamen at the same price, this is very good. Finally, I would like to thank the little brother who wears glasses at the front desk, who is very caring, warm, and patient! Click 👍!

But after checking in, take the elevator all the way to the room, which is fine. The room is also spacious, the separation of dry and wet is also very good, the hotel supplies are complete, and it is also relatively high-grade.
The front desk service is very good. We originally booked a windowless room just for a transfer in Xiamen, and we were upgraded to a windowed room. The next morning, we had to leave the front desk early in the morning and saw that we were one big and one small and had large luggage and also called a taxi to the door for us.

Personally, I think it is more comfortable and more convenient to live than the Hilton Curio in Xiamen University…

After reading the hotel reviews, some guests have responded to this problem for a long time.

msg:After searching around, I couldn't find the merchant of this Hampton by Hilton, but I found the star father in the hotel, so I could only make a comment.
I wonder why such a distinctive hotel does not have a name. The architectural style is a tulou-shaped ring, and the breakfast is so rich and excellent that people want to sleep for breakfast.
surroundings:
This may be the biggest feature. The whole hotel is a hollow circular building style, like Fujian Tulou, with a sealed roof. Looking down from the upstairs, there is only a restaurant on the 2nd floor. With this style, you can definitely be served breakfast in the morning. The fragrance wakes up.
The location of the hotel is not good, but there are various business circles and scenic spots around, such as SM City Plaza and Mingfa Plaza, which are all nearby. It is a great choice to choose this hotel. It is about 3 kilometers away from the airport and about the same distance from the Science and Technology Museum. It takes less than 15 minutes by taxi. It is also very convenient to take the subway. It is just at Xiaodongshan Station on Line 3. As long as you are not too troublesome and not in a hurry, this is definitely a convenient choice for accommodation. No wonder the surrounding housing prices are 60,000+…
Serve:
The service is very enthusiastic. When I checked in, I wanted to add a quilt because I brought my baby. When I asked, I was very enthusiastic and told that there was no problem. The elder sister who was cleaning was also kind and enthusiastic, and she would not feel a professional smile when greeting, very sincere. It's not like many hotel cleaning aunts who seem to be very resentful, and the overall is very clean. The bathroom products are a brand that I have used before. I can't tell you. The shower gel smells like orange. I have to say that in the selection of bathroom products, domestic chain hotels really need to upgrade. The improvement of sophistication is often in these details.

The hotel's breakfast really needs special mention, it's really great. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing my baby does is open the door and look at the restaurant below, and see that someone has been busy preparing very early. There is no need to say more about clean and hygienic. The ingredients are fresh and carefully prepared, meat and vegetables are matched, there is a noodle cooking window, and there is a small table with characteristics of southern Fujian prepared five-spice rolls, peanut soup and noodle paste, the eldest sister of the fried egg He is skilled in cooking, efficient and neat in his work, and in a short time he cooked a large plate full of eggs and double-sided candy hearts. He also neatly made sandwiches, waffles, bacon, and various sausages. At first glance, he was a good housekeeper.
There are not many kinds of fruits in the fruit area, but there are watermelons that are not often eaten, which are very sweet and fresh. It is really a luxury to eat such watermelons in winter.
There are small cakes and various kinds of bread in the dessert area, and the toast slices will be especially delicious when baked. Beverages also basically cover all needs, soy milk, millet porridge and white fungus soup, coffee juice, black tea and yogurt. The children fell in love with all kinds of wheat circles and ate two bowls of soaked milk.
If you catch a plane and just want to make the most of your spare time, you might as well come here to experience it, it is very comfortable. come back next time.

msg:As far as the price of 2000+ for the first night when I stayed, it is really not worth it, check in on 7.21 and check out on 7.24, 3636 for three nights

Of course, I didn't understand and asked clearly when I booked the room. It's my own problem. This is not to blame the hotel. It’s just after the check-in that my peers said that the Hilton Garden in Shenzhen was only four or five hundred and Xiamen’s house price was really expensive to 1200+… Then we checked whether Hampton and the garden were of the same grade and the daily house price. ...so I am even more puzzled about the price of 2000+ on the first night, and the price of 700 or 800 for the next two nights is a summer vacation.


Environment: It's a ring-shaped patio-style room. It's hot outside the room... I just checked into the room on the fifth floor and there was a heat wave when I got out of the elevator. Then I saw the platform under the patio is a restaurant. I was still thinking about how to sit. Once for breakfast, it turned out that there was an air conditioner underneath. It was obvious to the naked eye that there were about 20 white holes that were the size of a basketball circle. Well, if you were sitting in the position facing the vent, your head would be buzzing.

Hygiene: still a few years old and naturally outdated

Service: The cleaning lady is very friendly and polite.

1. The hotel gave a room. There was the sound of trains in the room, but how could there be trains around? It rang both nights and couldn’t sleep at all,
2. I felt itchy when I slept in the quilt. I even sneezed. Both of us are like this. Our two bodies are not the same.
3. I was bitten by a bug inexplicably, didn't go out again, I didn't look at it when I took a shower, I just sat in the room for a while. Definitely bite in the room
4. The handling attitude of the hotel is amazing. Someone was called to change the quilt that night. The lobby manager is actually sleeping, saying that he can come to solve it after 8 o'clock the next day. Is it funny, we can't even sleep, and you still sleep?
It's solved the next day. Let us go to the hospital for an examination. This is also very funny. We have a plane the next day. Let's go for an examination with you? Tens of thousands of multinational aircraft, can you afford to pay for the delay? Since you want to check, why don't you get up early? Both of our customers got up at 7 o'clock? Are you sleeping so much?
The manager told us that their sheets and quilts were all washed by an audited organization, which meant that they were okay, which was even more funny, so why didn't it matter if they changed a bed sheet? I’m the one who won’t be allergic when I roll on the ground. I’m allergic to sleeping on your sheets. Your hotel is dirtier than the road. It’s recommended to go to sleep on the road.
4. Ask how to solve it. I flew abroad in a few hours, and I asked you to contact my mother. I said it was going to be reviewed. Is it funny? You changed the quilt. I have already gone abroad. How do you review it? I asked my mother to call you. There are more than 30, but none of them answered. It's really funny.
Did you let me fly back to China, or did my mother fly to Xiamen from another place to go to the hospital for examination with you?
Are you going to take out the sheets that day for inspection?
I didn't want to take advantage of it,
Since you can't get in touch, you can solve it in the same way. Yes, I will sue you to the end even if I am abroad.
I will contact my lawyer to solve this problem. The lawyer fee may be tens of thousands and the hotel fee is only a few hundred.

Secondly, it is worthy of being a Hilton hotel, and the service has nothing to say. By the way, there is a beautiful general manager who can see her busy every morning to help clean up.
The rooms are clean and soundproofed. I especially like thick clean towels. The only regret is that there is welcome music as soon as the TV is powered on, which is not ideal. It is better to shut down at any time.
The little sister at the front desk is very nice, for the sake of customers and patiently answering various questions. The service attitude is super five-star, and they are all long legs.
Worth recommending, I mainly praise the staff, the people are super nice, the attitude is really very good, there is no impatient! On the whole, whether a hotel is good or not depends on the level of the manager. Next time I want to bring company employees and family members on vacation, this hotel has a competitive advantage.

msg:由於住在5樓，房間除了面對馬路，樓下一直有人吵鬧到凌晨2點以外一切都好。
但是除了房間這個酒店我要點評四點問題：1.酒店前台要求我退改攜程訂單，通過直接現金下單的方式完成訂單。事情經過：事先通過攜程下了398一間的舒適大床房到達酒店後被告知此房型沒有窗户，本人意願重新在攜程APP上下訂單498一間的有窗户的房間，過程中被告知要求在前台直接付錢下訂單。這裡有上傳的發票和訂單做證，我住了兩天，第二天我是在平台下的訂單（衹下了一天），另外一天的發票是微信直接付款。2.入住後隨即出遊，回酒店在走廊偶遇工作人員正好關門從我們房間退出。一開始以為是打掃衞生，後續發現無需打掃，於是跟前台溝通詢問為什麼酒店工作人員可以不經同意進入客人房間。給出很無厘頭的解釋：我們是去看你需要什麼；我個人覺得很奇怪：人都不在酒店問什麼需要什麼？不都是客人需要什麼打電話給前台詢問嗎？那開門進到房間裏面看算什麼？3.還是開門事件：後續前台問我有沒有丟東西，既然是來問我們需要什麼為什麼還要問我們丟了什麼？我們丟了什麼酒店工作人員會承認嗎？另外前台跟我説親自查看了監控，説工作人員沒有進入房間，我就納悶了，你開我們的門幹什麼？我們剛剛入住，既不需要打掃又沒提需求你開我們門幹什麼？4.叫了那位進我們房間的工作人員自己來跟我解釋，我很不明白，為什麼不是酒店管理的問題，怎麼做的培訓，怎麼招聘的人，怎麼管理的工作人員，無組織無紀律無誠信，出了問題胡編亂造，沒有邏輯，找一些搪塞的理由。

msg:踩雷了，踩雷了，踩雷了，重要的事情説三遍！！！！不建議入住
有史以來住酒店最差的一次體驗，美曰其名希爾頓，其實是希爾頓旗下的商務酒店，跟五星級扯不上邊，性價比太差了，服務也差，前台到保潔感覺就三四個人，打前台電話一個多小時沒給回覆。
設施：差！很熱！酒店一共7樓，內部中空結構，外面如果是火爐，酒店就是烤箱，因為她不開空調！保潔説是為了省電！！ NND 我花六七百住酒店，你給我這種品質！7樓不能住，一天到晚都是熱，打空調和沒打一樣。
酒店秉着能省則省的原則，像刮鬍刀啊，浴袍啊通通沒有，想要，打前台要～不好意思前台人員不夠，沒個四五十分鐘上不來。

衞生：五星級酒店有蒼蠅正常嗎？打前台他説叫工程部，然後不了了之了……大半夜在酒店打蒼蠅的畫面太美了🤣🤣🤣絕絕子

環境：大夏天室內連空調都捨不得開，沒心情看環境，一般

服務：我能見到的就前台兩人，保潔一個，工程部一個，加上兩個送外賣的機器人，這麼大一個酒店，而且是旅遊城市，完全不夠用啊，送個外賣一個小時上不來，打個電話四五十分鐘沒反應


有個小插曲：我們是帶有寶寶入住，由於7樓房間温度太高孩子一直哭，中間有和酒店溝通，她們提出給我們換個房間，我們是五六點出門的，十點左右回來，她們又提出房間沒有問題，不給換了。

用餐環境相當不錯，寬敞大氣，早餐菜色還蠻豐富，不過有顧客使用後，在餐廳吸煙沒有見到服務人員勸阻，畢竟還是一個密閉空間。
飯店建築相當有特色，附近有許多特色小吃，對於喜歡吃大排檔的客户是一大福音。

酒店格局很有特色，環形，中間開放型，可以看到樓下的餐廳，不過可能是夏季尾聲，沒有空調，出了房間門有點熱，可能夏天會有空調。

不過這也不妨礙入住心情，畢竟房間裏的空調很給力。

msg:房間的管道隔音簡直連普通快捷酒店都比不上，半夜2點被管道流水的聲音吵醒、清晰的如同在耳邊，讓我以為是自己的衞生間漏水呢，結果是別的房間客人洗澡的流水聲，太無語了，酒店發生這麼低級的問題真的對這個品牌失望。

建築是上海金茂的簡約版。
美中不足的是貼著飯店周遭，停滿了無序的車子，及鄰近的小店參差不齊，感覺很雜亂。
大廳提供的飲料及小食，跟Wistine的習慣類似，有親切感。
大堂或服務人員，能快一些接聽電話就好了，感覺有經驗的中級主管，似乎有不足的情況。
總之，入住經驗算是舒適，床跟枕頭是老希爾頓的招牌，睡起來還真不錯，CP值算好，下次會再入住。

1、攜程殺熟是真有的事，提前4天訂的房間，價格比當天的前台價格貴接近三百。

2、價格貴了，房間還不好（沒窗户）。

3、我3個朋友當天同時入住，價格比我便宜兩百多，房間還比我好多了。

4、客服退了一百元的代金券，解釋了一通，沒好氣搭理她。

5、真的會殺熟。

msg:提醒要入住的，先問清楚有沒有冷氣。
我住了兩晚，第二晚沒有冷氣，打去投訴，酒店說我可以離開，退款給我。當時已經晚上十點。
最後給我一個電風扇，整晚吱吱作響，要開窗，零晨12點被外面打斗的聲音噪醒，之後每二小時被不同的噪音嘈醒，整晚沒醒好。
早餐聽到隔壁桌投訴為什麼冷氣越開越熟熱，原來他們不知道沒冷氣，只有暖氣，也是整晚睡不著。
酒店是還可以，但管理層的決定讓人費解。他們說因為有很多客人投訴太冷所以轉暖氣。四月天要暖氣。怕冷不開空調不就是了。服了，倒貼也不會過來受罪。
如果有和我同樣遭遇的客人，我已向攜程申請，他們給了我$100消氣費。

廈門機場海關印象極差，海關兇，出租車司機態度惡劣，離酒店門口還有一段路他硬讓我步行穿過綠化帶帶着2個大箱子，還把我的箱子橫扔在地上。
問酒店第二天一大早打車的問題，讓我滴滴設定酒店門口，但是並沒有這個選項，我選了酒店名字，難道不説明是門口嗎？當地司機2輛都不開到門口，真的醉了！
不會再次選擇這個酒店！
房間內連浴帽都沒有還需要問他們要，真的非常麻煩。

msg:酒店位於地鐵小東山附近，出來走個5分鐘就到了。離思明區的重要景點都在20分鐘以上的車程。周圍有兩家生鮮超市，晚上也有些可以吃飯的店。
訂的是舒適大床房，最後開的顯示高級大床房，當時在場也沒人和我解釋一下。自己查了下好像高級更貴點。房間蠻寬敞，還有個沙發床（床的功能在走的時候才發現）。剛到的時候也沒注意空調，看了下面板是有數字的。等晚上睡下後，越睡越冷，才發現空調沒出風。打電話給前台，前台説幫你調高下温度。後來又打過來説空調沒啟動。我説我按了面板沒反應。因為很晚了，前台説先他這裏幫我把空調開啟。第二天早上我打電話給前台説了昨晚情況，前台説派人來修。等了半小時也不見人，後面因為要去遊玩，就直接去前台又反映了一下，當天回來後空調可以正常操作了。
1.4以下小童免費，我家的超過一點，需要加收30元。但早餐的種類不多，9點過後去，菜和空盤子的補給就跟不上了。下麪條和粉絲的阿姨給起來也比較隨性。抄手非常難吃，所以數量也就3，4個。那台咖啡機也老是出問題。
還有一點我不大明白，一進房間，裏面有兩包掛耳咖啡，一包袋泡綠茶，一包袋泡紅茶，兩包咖啡糖。按理説，咖啡喝完，每天應該補充給我的吧？住了三天，就第一天的兩包咖啡，後面就再也沒有了。至少我在其他酒店沒遇到過。而且化粧鏡下的抽紙用完了也不補充，打給前台後倒馬上就送來了。
總體上，雖然有些不如意，但後面也給解決了。

msg:作為700多折後620左右的“高檔網紅酒店”我衹能給這麼點評價，酒店停車場入口不太好找；房間床單潮潮的；廁所浴巾一股濃濃的jy的味道，一開始還以為是一條的問題，誰知道每條都是🤢🤢然後酒店是圓形的，有一半是和居民樓貼的很近，我甚至覺得把窗户一打開就可以和對面的居民聊天打招呼了。我住過的酒店不算多但也不算少，我也知道希爾頓歡朋是希爾頓旗下比較低端的酒店了，但是也不至於這個這麼拉垮吧？700多折後600多的酒店我真的😄甚至覺得不如亞多300多房性價比高

前台得知我們退房時間太早無法享用酒店早餐，主動為我們提供可以外帶的早餐，感覺特別温馨。
酒店內部餐食經濟實惠，如果要在外面用餐，附近也有很多餐廳可供選擇。
酒店位置出行方便離機場距離算是近的。

早餐突出閩南特色，中西合璧兼具中華南北風味，與正規國家飯協五星飯店比不遑多讓。非常棒！
客房不算大也未見異形，方正好用。裝修簡約略顯簡陋，光源少且稍暗，需要適應過程。
床上用品、布草、衞生間一次性用品中規中矩，不配剃鬚刨，也沒有速溶咖啡包，僅有2袋茶。與其它同類同級酒店相比，價格咸宜，性價比略優，看在優質早餐的份上，值得優先選住。

酒店整體的設施還是不錯的，早餐種類也還可以，因為是歡朋酒店價格稍微貴了點，如果價格能再親民點就更好了。下次來廈門可以考慮再來住。

4一點希爾頓的企業文化都沒感覺到 外賣11.20到的前台讓機器人送上來等到了12點多還是沒有中間打過無數次電話詢問都是馬上最後還是讓自己下樓去取 機器人在電梯門口不動了 房物不知道？禮賓不知道？

msg:因為會議住了一週，這是我住過的服務最差東西最難吃的五星級酒店
早餐不想下去吃問能不能送一份到房間，回答不能，我們沒有這樣的服務；
問路，問酒店後門怎麼走，沒有一個服務員理我；
退房後我要求快遞發票，結果地址弄錯電話弄錯，質問值班經理什麼情況值班經理直接不回覆！
設施：差
衞生：一般，而且連住幾天不換洗漱用品不放咖啡茶包
環境：一般
服務：非常非常差
