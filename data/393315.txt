msg:This is the 2nd Ritz Carlton i stayed in Beijing for the trip
Family of 3, infant of 7 months old - for 2 days

The design and thoughts put into the building is definitely worthy of a Ritz. Classy and solid build

In my view, the service we received was less than expected of a Ritz. It could be contributed to the fact that this is right in town centre and the occupancy is high

There was no introduction of the facilities of this branch and the staffs at the door looks inexperienced / untrained while they watched upon me getting my luggages out of the taxi and leaving them at the driveway while i set up the baby pram

Besides the service, the hotel is great, location fantastic, facilities are well maintained

msg:The room was clean and big enough to enjoy holidays.  

There are 2 things to concern now.  

I had no reservations at the lounge for 2023 countdown party.  But I asked to a staff (maybe concierge) to get 6 seats in the lounge and she asked to the receptionist who was in front of the lounge.  The staff said “they have enough seats for you, please wait here in front and my colleague will help you” So excited.  I was standing and waiting someone to come.  Few minutes later or more than several minutes later, nothing happened and I still stood up.  I asked the receptionist to let us in,  and she was curious who we are.  No seats are available.  

At the room service, we ordered 3 ice cream and some other menus.  They delivered one ice cream with 3 scoops in it.  And they asked how many we are, (with my friend family for countdown together).  We said 6 (including 2 kids) and delivered only one fork.  No utensils enough even they asked how many we are.  

Besides these, the room and breakfast were so good.  And waiters and waitresses were very kind and helpful.

It’s one of the worst hotels I’ve seen in my lifetime. I have been in 94 continents, and never, never, have some experience like here, the building it’s so old, the service in club lounge is so bad. I should say, it’s not 5 stars hotel, the room has bad smells,breakfast and dinner in club lounge is poor, one weeks ago, I have been in Xian Ritz Carlton,it was fantastic, you can’t compare those are together….
Absolutely,I will not come back again in Beijing Ritz Carlton.

msg:The hotel itself is nice, beautiful room and comfortable bathroom. But the attitude and the way personnel treats guests is terrible. Our family with the baby was offered the worst and the least convenient table during the breakfast although there were a lot of spare ones. Guests are not allowed to use the facilities - people who were not even the hotel guests did not let me use the yoga studio in extremely rude and impolite way and staff did not try to resolve the issue unless I got really angry and yet no apologies or compliment were given. Horrible experience. We went to celebrate the wedding anniversary but the hotel personnel and management tried their best to spoil the day. Higly not recommended.

Pros:
-amazing service especially from Cassie in the club lounge
-excellent lunch and dinner menu, it was also very tasty
-everything about the hotel is clean and well maintained

Cons:
-compared to other Ritz-Carlton’s, the club lounge was a little bit disappointing. In the Guangzhou ritz, the club lounge had all you can eat lunch buffets and afternoon tea. The variety was huge and very worth the club lounge price. The club lounge room was also smaller than I’ve stayed in the past.

msg:We recently stayed here for two nights whilst getting married in Beijing, to say we were treated is an understatement. Our room was upgraded as soon as the lovely staff heard about the occasion; they’d organized for some beautiful decorations to be laid out on our bed and instantly we knew we’d made the right decision. The following day after our marriage ceremony we had an incredible afternoon tea in The Lounge. But, before this two incredible employees (Daisy and Barbie) helped us take some wedding day pictures around the hotel, they made us feel so welcome and important, they suggested brilliant places to take pictures around the grounds and we took a couple with them too so we could remember the experience. We went out for a meal that evening and expected to come back to our beautiful hotel room and enjoy some champagne our friends had bought us. Upon return we were blown away, the staff had laid out the most beautiful arrangement in our hotel room, with printed and framed pictures that Barbie and Daisy had taken earlier in the day, a bottle of champagne on ice, a cheese and meat platter and most thoughtfully, a hand written card signed by all of the front of house staff. I couldn’t recommend this hotel more, they made our trip incredibly memorable and every moment in their staff’s presence was a pleasure. Thank you to all of the staff at the Ritz-Carlton Beijing! From, Jake & Connie

The staff has a strong sense of responsibility and a super good service attitude. All kinds of problems are considered from the perspective of the guests. I felt a little uncomfortable after swimming this time. The swimming pool staff and lounge staff quickly brought me sugar and salt water, cakes, desserts, etc. Thank you very much! ! !

Here I would like to especially praise the managers of the executive lounge, Lena and Coco, who are very considerate, beautiful and have good personalities. Give everyone a big thumbs up 👍👍👍 Like Ritz 👍👍👍 See you next time, happy!

msg:A very satisfying stay experience during a business trip to Beijing. From the moment I got off the car at the hotel, the welcoming guy greeted me warmly. The professional and efficient check-in at the front desk made me feel honored and comfortable for just one day's stay. The room service was even better! Unlimited mineral water was provided in a timely manner. Other requirements were also patiently and thoughtfully met one by one (breakfast arrangement, late check-out, changing slippers, bathtub cleaning, etc.). They were very considerate. I would like to commend the handsome Kevin at the front desk and the operator Miss Leng. They were very kind and warm in their conversation. Especially the glance back when I left the room left me with a very beautiful picture; the afternoon sun shone into the room through the large floor-to-ceiling glass windows, sprinkling on the elegant and comfortable French sofa and two-poster bed, just like the French classic romance that permeated the entire hotel, making people linger... I will come back next time to experience the warmth and beauty in the details again... (sincere comments, not a shill ~~~~

The wooden lattice door at the entrance of the hotel is very beautiful. When checking in, Jiami upgraded the suite and added a bed for free. The hotel is an old-fashioned European hotel. Although it is not as grand and bright as a new-fashioned hotel, it wins in details and service. The connotation and sense of age given by each furnishing, as well as the irreplaceable warm, thoughtful and polite service, are impressive. There is a clothes drying + sterilizing machine in the suite, which gave a big surprise. It is very practical to remove the odor of clothes after hot pot care and dry children's underwear. The check-in experience is very comfortable, and the children are reluctant to leave. I will choose to stay next time I come to Beijing. I highly recommend it!

The room is very clean, but the floor of the bathroom is dirty, and the tableware and cups in the restaurant and lounge have obvious water stains 😟 It really shouldn't be... The morning shift staff in the lounge are not as good as the night shift staff. The female employees in the morning shift have gathered to chat and play, and the noise is very loud. Moreover, the receptionist at the door at noon on the 29th used a notebook to clamp the phone to chat on WeChat, like a middle school student who was slacking off in class... The night shift staff is great and meets all my needs. I like the night shift staff ☺️ The dishes in the executive lounge are okay. Although they are not very colorful, they are still pretty good. The desserts, cheese and butter in the lounge are praised by name, and the presentation is very good. The room service is very fast and good, and the operator's English level is also good and flexible. ☺️ The fruit plate sent by Ctrip for booking was not delivered. I don't know the specific reason. The high floors and humidifiers for special needs are implemented as needed.

Facilities: Some of the facilities outside the hotel are old, but the rooms are not bad
Hygiene: The tableware and cups have obvious stains
Environment: The environment is OK, quite satisfactory
Service: The service is very good, but the receptionist at the entrance of Lounge No. 29 was playing with his mobile phone, I don’t know why.
I will consider staying next time when entertaining friends in Beijing

msg:The first time I wanted to stay at the Ritz was because of a book about the management of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. This time I finally had the opportunity to experience it (I am used to staying at Marriott, InterContinental, Hilton, and Sheraton). I stayed for 2 nights and liked the overall environment, which was very retro and court-style, but the overall service did not meet my expectations. Maybe it was my first time staying there, and I was a Ctrip customer. I did not enjoy much attention from the service, especially when solving problems, I was more hasty, perfunctory, and rushed. (For example, the extension of stay was changed to refund + new stay; the deposit was refunded only after I called to inform that it had not been refunded 2 days after leaving the hotel). But there are also good things: for example, masks are provided (Wangfujing Hilton and Novotel Peace do not provide them). In fact, the services of many high-end chain hotels in China have surpassed those of international brands, such as Atour and Jianguo. I will stay at the Ritz again if I have the chance, because I like the JING tea I drink at breakfast.

This brand's body lotion is about 500 yuan per bottle in skp.

Such a low-level problem should be considered a major flaw, right?
Old hotel, aging hardware facilities is human nature
The hotel also has dedicated personnel to open the door and greet you at the door.
Very old-school feeling
The staff smiled when I met them in the corridor.
But the house price of 1,400 and the signboard are placed here
The coffee pot and kettle cannot be cleaned
The housekeeping manager should really write a review
There are also water stains on the shower faucet.
A few more personal thoughts
A hotel of this price and location
It's really simple to welcome guests with fruit or have their beds made in the evening and put water and glasses by the bed. Of course, this part is my personal opinion. All in all, I will at least not come back to this Ritz next time. . . The experience is really bad

Second: When problems arise, they are not taken seriously and improvements are not made. The disposable slippers in the room were wet from taking a shower. Before you go out in the morning, call the front desk and ask for an extra spare item! When I come back in the evening, I won’t show you any more! The Ritz-Carlton is also a five-star luxury hotel.

The Huamao Ritz-Carlton is the most satisfying hotel in this trip to Beijing. It is clean and tidy and the bedding is comfortable. Diptyque's toiletries and European decoration style are simply my favorite. Because the second day of check-in was the child's birthday, the room was specially decorated with a childlike a**osphere, full of warm ceremony and full of surprises! Special thanks to Elsa at the front desk. She has a sweet smile and a gentle and approachable attitude. When I checked in, she expressed her fondness for the scent of the Ritz lobby fragrance and then sent a sample to the room. She was very considerate and considerate. ❤️~ A hotel that I sincerely recommend. Next time I come to Beijing, I will definitely come again to experience Ritz’s professional service and high-quality stay experience👍🫶🏻

There are a few points that I really want to complain about: 1) We stayed in the executive hotel In the lounge, five meals a day can be served in the hotel. I think this is very good. The ladies in the executive lounge are also very gentle. The only thing that makes me unhappy is that the snacks the children brought were mixed with expired ones! ! ! When I looked at the production date, it was produced in 2022. This is already 2024. Oh my god, I don’t even know how many pieces my kid ate! ! ! 2) The hotel's swimming pool is not bad and the water temperature is suitable. My children and I were playing in the massage pool in the women's locker room of the swimming pool. After turning on the massage switch for a few minutes, we discovered that there were two bugs in the pool. We were so frightened that we hurried out. When we checked out, we told the front desk staff that the hotel's service attitude was very good and they said they would check it out. 3) The toilet paper tray in the room is broken, but this is actually okay. The most, most, most unacceptable thing about these shortcomings is that the snacks in the executive lounge are mixed with expired ones and given to guests! ! !

Although the swimming pool on the 17th floor is not big, it is still quite beautiful. The children loved it and swam for two days.
Special thanks to guest services staff Anna

The only drawback is that the hotel has been there for many years and the equipment is a bit outdated.

msg:The room hardware is very good. The lobby room has the feel of a classic European traditional aristocratic mansion. It would be even more perfect if a fireplace could be added. The hardware maintenance is very good. I have stayed in so many hotels, but this hotel's marble countertop is the only one with no stains. It shows that it has been maintained with great care and craftsmanship.
But what I want to say is that the service check-in doorman service is extremely good, enthusiastic and professional. However, there is no doorman in the lobby at night, which is terrible. Moreover, the hygiene in the guest room is very bad. When the aunt saw us coming, she seemed to see an enemy and avoided the operator in the room. The attitude is extremely bad, very rude, and the lack of address is extremely bad! Room service requires more than an hour to deliver water or a toothbrush. I have stayed at three Ritz hotels in Guangzhou, Chengdu and Beijing. Personally, I think Chengdu Ritz is the best!
Although this property is well maintained, the service is a mess! Gold and jade are ruined on the outside and in the middle

The swimming pool on the 17th floor has a water temperature of 29° all year round and is very clean and comfortable. Apart from hardware, soft services are what I like most. The head chef of the Western restaurant will come to you in the morning to greet you personally, switching between Chinese and English freely. The service staff have a high sense of service and are well-trained. Bring you a very noble experience. The hotel is right at the transfer station between Line 1 and Line 14, and the transportation is very convenient. Opposite is the Huamao Shopping Center, and dining and shopping are also within easy reach! The child said he would stay here next time. Not a bastard, I sincerely recommend!

msg:This is my first time staying at a Ritz-Carlton hotel. There are varying degrees of praise and criticism for Huamao Ritz on all major online platforms. But the overall feeling of staying this time is quite good. The overall style of the hotel is the retro European design of the last century. Although the hotel lobby is small, it is also quite quiet. With more comfortable music, it makes people feel very comfortable. The check-in front desk has a free upgrade. Got a double room with garden view. The location of the hotel is also unique. It is located near the East Third Ring Road. It is a 5-minute walk from Dawang Road Subway Station. Beijing SKP is also next to the hotel, making shopping convenient. The interior of the room may be a little outdated due to the baptism of time and the retro style, but it is still very clean overall and is equipped with a smart toilet, a capsule coffee machine and Tiptik's toiletries, which still gives it a high-end feel. of. Due to the tight itinerary of this trip, it was a pity that I did not have the opportunity to experience the hotel's swimming pool, gym and other facilities. When we checked out the next day, the lobby manager also very thoughtfully engraved our names on our room cards as a souvenir. The overall stay felt like it was up to the standard of a Ritz-Carlton. I look forward to the same next time I come to Beijing. Have the opportunity to stay at Huamao Ritz.

When we arrived at the hotel, Victoria Yang was already waiting in the lobby and helped provide a children's breakfast and late check-out to facilitate our flight after 18:00. After arriving in the room, Victoria Yang brought fruits and desserts to the two children. The unexpected surprise made the children very happy.
The baby’s comment is: Victoria Yang has a nice attitude, thank you.
Objectively speaking, the hotel is a bit old. Although it is well maintained, it lacks modern flavor (smartphones and TVs, etc.). There is still room for improvement in terms of hygiene and cleanliness. The cleaning aspect can be improved through management.

The day of check-in was the Mid-Autumn Festival, so we arranged an upgraded room. Ritz mooncakes and little lions were placed on the night bed, which was very cute.

I would like to express my appreciation and recognition to the housekeeping director Linda and the duty manager Daisy Chang for their hard work and comprehensive service. They both treated me every time I stayed. Their thoughtful care and service were fully demonstrated, and they were responsible for the special circumstances of minors during their stay. I would like to give them my greatest appreciation and gratitude here, which can deeply portray the service-oriented embodiment of the Ritz-Carlton hotel brand. , every day when I go to the front desk, I can hear their caring and greetings to me. I would like to praise you again!
Secondly, this Ritz has a duty manager named "Steven Wang" who has unprecedented and most unbelievable service, which has completely brought down the brand and class of the entire hotel! As a person in the service industry, he doesn't understand what "the customer is God" and doesn't understand what is right and wrong. He despises customers and is arrogant. I'm talking about this male duty manager "Steven". My impression of him. Very dissatisfied. If I could give him a rating for his work, I decided to give him 0 points. I will also take this opportunity and point out how messed up this person's attitude towards work is. He does not deserve to be at the Ritz-Carlton. As a manager at the front desk, I hope that my sincere and sincere evaluation can make him realize his mistakes and improve them. Finally, I also hope that he will think twice before doing anything in the future!

1. There is nothing wrong with the carpet in the passageway of the guest room, but there is a strong smell of carpet as soon as you get out of the elevator, which really lowers the standard and seems extremely careless
2. Breakfast until 10:30. I went downstairs to eat before 10 o’clock. Many plates were empty, and I didn’t replenish them in time until I finished breakfast and left. ps: There were still customers who just came to eat
3. After check-out, the few people I saw at the front desk in the lobby didn't even have a smiley face.
In addition, a warm reminder that only 6 hours of free parking service is provided per night
The rest of the parking fee needs to be borne by yourself (no one informs in advance, you will be notified when you check out

Because the wedding is used as a wedding room, the place where the wedding will be held has booked one, and I have booked a standard room. The hotel called one week in advance to ask about the specific needs of the two rooms, and the phone has been informed.
On the day of check-in, the front desk staff only found one standard room... Then what's the point of calling a week in advance? Can't find the order at the front desk?
Because it is a wedding room to pick up relatives, there is a lot of deposit required. The first time I was informed was 3,500, but the actual charge was 5,000. Although it is a deposit, it can be refunded later, but the check-in staff didn't make it clear to me. When I asked the front desk later, he told me that the normal deposit for each room is 1000. I informed that I was married Room, please tell me the specific deposit amount, he said that it will be refunded later🔙, of course I know it will be refunded, because 8500 includes the room fee and deposit, I want to know the specific deposit, and I will reimburse the rest of the room fee, the front desk I didn't make it clear, and I didn't find out after searching for a long time. Isn't this deposit a unified rule?

Repair the walls in time, lie down and rest and see the big cracks in the ceiling at a glance, which affects the mood a bit, but the hygiene is acceptable. It is better to choose other hotels at the same price. Anyway, I won't go there next time.

The concierge at the door will also help open the door and pull luggage, and actively help to call a car.

It deserves the Golden Diamond name... I had breakfast and asked if I wanted coffee or... (a cup of warm water). I had finished my meal. No one brought it to the person next to me. The coffee was served early and there was no warm water...? The details are really poor.

msg:I just lived in the Ritz-Carlton in Nanjing, and the facilities are a bit old in comparison. There is no new one in Nanjing, although it is written about the renovation in 2018.
What surprised me the most is that there is no light barrier and the curtains leak light🥵🥵
For breakfast downstairs, the dishes are not bad, but they haven’t changed much after staying for four days. There is no smoked salmon in the cold meat, and there is mackerel every day. At least it should be changed every other day. But the chef was pretty good and went to the back kitchen to help me get two slices.
The water in Nanjing is the Centennial Mountain
The one in Beijing is Bama Boquan. It seems that the current five-star luxury hotels will not see Evian and the like.
There is a bathtub without bath salts



Sanitation: Sanitation is OK and no obvious dead spots are found
Environment: skp downstairs and Huamao Plaza are convenient or quite convenient
Service: Not very active, children's bathrobes and toiletries slippers are delivered only after calling. Some netizens said to prepare gifts for children. It is a Marriott member or a children’s gift bag for four or five hundred, and it takes money to arrange and give small dolls.

msg:I stayed here twice in the past month. The first time was the co-branded afternoon tea. The taste was really unacceptable. I basically didn’t eat much. It was worse than the original ordinary afternoon tea.
The second time was even worse. The check-in price more than doubled. Although it was too exaggerated during the conference, Marriott did not have such a big price difference and the distance was so close. Originally, the Ritz was an exclusive promotion for Marriott members. No, the service is at least satisfactory. Checked out on the 19th and the deposit has not been refunded. I called twice to remind them but they said they forgot. It’s hard to accept this reason. I forgot to remind them once and they didn’t refund me. They also didn’t refund me the second time. There was no one to answer the phone at all. I'm sorry. I just said that maybe the front desk forgot to remind me. Where did the reminder go? I called again on the 23rd, and the customer service was a little nicer. They said they were sorry and would follow up. It took 5 days for the deposit to be refunded. I have never encountered such a forgetful front desk in a hotel of the same level! I may not consider the Ritz again if I stay there again. . .

The status of the front desk service is a little random, some are enthusiastic and some are cold, but it is commendable that the doorman greets loudly every time he enters and exits.
The extra fee has been upgraded to the executive suite, but everything else is okay. Two problems: 1. There are urine stains in the crevices of the washlet
2. The wheels of the swivel chair in the living room are very sharp. It is easy to scratch the ankle when it is rotated. After two times, I dare not sit again. If something happens, it will hurt the soul and delay the work.

It's okay during the day, but it's too broken at night, like moving. On the first night, I changed three rooms. The first room upstairs was very noisy, not sensitive Man, it's really loud. Arrived at the room at around 9:00 p.m., there was still a ding dong sound for more than an hour, as if I was moving, I called the front desk at 10:30 p.m. People, when they arrived at the second room, the staff member knocked on the door strangely first. . . There was a turndown service inside, and there were fruits on the table. The staff who carried the luggage said that someone might be staying. I was shocked. I felt so insecure. I went to the lobby in a bathrobe, and the waiter dragged my luggage after getting off the elevator. Behind me, wait for me to press the elevator button. When we arrived to reflect the situation, the lobby said indifferently and lukewarmly what you want to do. . Well, I was speechless for a while and said helplessly that of course I would change to another room. The luggage delivery staff went into the room and left the luggage without saying goodbye. It took 45 minutes to change rooms. It was already 23:15 to change the room, but the service was really speechless. Will not stay at any Ritz Carlton hotel again.

We were on the plane at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and we just left time for a meal to deliver the clothes. the other party. The next day, 10 and a half times the clothes hadn't been delivered yet, and a woman answered the call to the front desk. She didn't even solve the problem after calling three times, and said "we'll check and call you back later" every time. I waited for more than ten minutes and didn't return the call. The most speechless thing is that I called her for the first time and after she inquired, she asked directly that I hadn't sent them any clothes? ? It's really outrageous😊 We asked her to give them the phone number. As expected, the manager is also a person who can't understand people. About whether a piece of clothing can be guaranteed to be delivered before 12 o'clock (it's already past 11 o'clock here) and ink marks More than 20 minutes later, the murderer's attitude was extremely bad (we all have recordings), and then he hung up on me directly. We were so angry that we went downstairs to argue, maybe we found out that we are not soft persimmons, so we quickly pretended to apologize but! ! Both of the aforementioned guys are apologizing tomorrow until we're gone! ! ! The woman couldn't hide, but the man made excuses when he came out. Before I could say a few words, a person at the front desk who claimed to be his boss sent me into the room. Is this obviously cover-up? The point is that this man waved his hands impatiently when he returned to the house, as if he was helpless! Later, we were in a hurry to catch a flight and added a WeChat account of a person who claimed to be a manager (you have a lot of hotel managers~) and repeatedly promised that we would deal with it seriously and provide a picture of the punishment certificate. The result? see for yourself
Don’t live if you can’t live there anyway. There is no shortage of good hotels in Beijing anyway

The cleaning staff even rummaged through the luggage, with obvious signs of rummaging.

I asked what room to check, and she said that you are going to check out? The standard of the afternoon tea in the executive lounge can be described as crude.

The child wanted to eat a bowl. Noodles, the service staff communicated with the chef and said that they can cook a bowl for us. I said the simplest Yangchun noodles would be fine. After a while, they came back and said that they couldn’t make Yangchun noodles. There are only soup noodles with poached eggs. I said it was okay, but it was served I was almost pissed off when I came up. I boiled the fried udon noodles for breakfast and put an egg in it. The child took a bite and said it was too fishy to eat. The executive room was more than 2,000 a night.

The decoration is very characteristic, classical and western style, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. The handsome guy Taylor on the first floor 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻.

When I come again this time, I can’t help feeling that it is still my favorite style and the facilities are well maintained. It's very good and doesn't look old. My child said it feels like coming home. I'll stay here next time I come to Beijing!

I told the front desk that I brought an electric heater and gave the water that was being packaged. This must be liked👍 Because I like to drink water, although breakfast can be eaten in, and it is not like the order-style order last time, but the variety is significantly reduced, the coffee is not hot, and there are many fewer people dining. I hope the epidemic will end soon! Free parking fee is very good👍

msg:Honestly speaking, the hardware of this hotel is not good among all the Ritz-Carltons I have stayed in, but it is my favorite Ritz-Carlton. The meticulous and family-like care of the staff moved us deeply. We were deeply impressed by their enthusiasm, patience, thoughtfulness, professionalism and efficiency.
When we checked in, the staff at the front desk told us that we could also go to the executive lounge to check in. The environment was better, but I thought the little girl was very nice, so I stayed at the front desk. The little girl has a really good attitude and is skilled in business, and she helped us deal with it quickly. Since we booked an executive room, there were a lot of Benifit and she took the trouble to explain them to us one by one and gave good advice based on her experience. It is really rare to be so enthusiastic and serious about the work.
The executive lounge of the hotel is the biggest highlight of this stay, where I spend all my time. The environment is very good and the food is exquisite. Of course, what moved us the most was all the staff who provided the service, especially Cassie Wang, with professional skills, dedicated attitude, enthusiasm for service, and meticulous care, they were really kind like family. The lounge provides guests with lunch (Mini self-service), afternoon tea (self-service), dinner (self-service) and happy hour. To be honest, the long-term service is still quite stressful for the staff, but from the beginning to the end, Cassie She and her partners are all smiles and efficient work to meet the various needs of the guests. We are even more caring and considerate to our parents with children. It is because of their help that we can enjoy the food and wine to the fullest. Although I have left the hotel, I am still moved by every detail that Cassie and the others have done for us, and I will definitely stay again if I have the chance.
The only regret this time is that the hotel did not give welcome fruits, which is rare in the executive room of a five-star hotel. Although I may not eat those fruits, it is a well-recognized courtesy.

However, the service experience is not as good as that of other mature occupants. The waiter in the corridor will not say hello, and the waiter in the restaurant is not very enthusiastic. The breakfast is relatively average. There are several empty dishes that have not been replenished for a while, which makes it difficult to make reservations.

Special thanks to Cassie and Ashley in the lower lounge, who are very caring and praised, and Manager Li on duty, who responded and solved problems very quickly.

SKP, China World Trade Center, dining and shopping have everything. The service of the hotel should be recommended more. The details of the Ritz can be seen in the quality. I think in addition to seeing the hotel concierge kneeling and wiping the suitcase in Japan, it is the first time in China that I have seen a concierge to help me disinfect my luggage and paste it on It's really heartwarming to put a label on it, especially when the epidemic is still repeated, this is really a bonus, and it also leaves a very good first impression.

msg:I haven’t been to Ritz Beijing for a long time because of the epidemic. This time I made an appoin**ent with a friend to go to SKP to buy and buy, so I chose China Business Ritz. This time I felt not only the strictness of epidemic prevention and control, but also the different service quality. Experience, this is the Lion King Ritz that customers expect! I heard from the front desk staff that the hotel room has been upgraded in recent years. After entering the room, it really feels newer than before, and it is not like an old hotel for more than ten years. It seems that there were several new restaurants opened in the hotel last year. The ones I saw were Jingji and Four Leaf. They were very famous. I chose Yu Chinese Restaurant again and again. I haven’t been here for a long time, and the quality is still online, worthy of the Michelin sign. . After shopping, I asked some friends to play at the hotel&#39;s newly opened outdoor barbecue for a while. Friends said that in summer in Beijing, barbecue beer cannot be lacking. I said that the outdoor breeze and wanton laughter cannot be lacking. There are quite a lot of people, I feel that I am lucky if I can get a seat without booking, it seems that it is still in harmony with this hotel. Time is limited, no more writing, just look at the pictures and talk!

It also upgraded the executive floor, and did not give any courtesy, so it was equivalent to a floor change.
The location is very good, next to skp, shopping and consumption are very convenient

msg:I don’t recommend five-star hotels when traveling to Beijing. The price of 1,600 yuan includes an afternoon tea. The usual reservation is 700 yuan more expensive than the Marriott next door. There is a huge difference between the price and the accommodation experience. I can describe it as extremely disappointed. , It is about a three-star experience in Shanghai and Hangzhou, so I can understand.
1- The smell of smoke is huge, ask the bellman if this is a non-smoking floor? The answer is a non-smoking floor, but there is no way for someone to secretly smoke. If I knew at the time that this would make the kid sick, I would definitely ask for a room change.
2- The carpet is old, the sofa is about the same age as the yellow woven peony flowers discarded by the trash can on the street, and I hardly dare to do it. A layer of wooden board with a soft and rotten surface, diaphragmatic. 1700 yuan hotel on this standard.
3- The bathroom is quite big, but it's old. It can't be said to be dirty, but it's almost the kind of yellow and yellow, the aesthetics of decades ago. I don't like it, I just want to run away
4- After the child fell asleep, the Simmons of the two beds were all exposed, looking at how the beds were made.
5 – The air conditioner is broken, no matter how I adjust the temperature, the room is always 22 degrees, plus the smell of smoke, the child will have a fever after staying overnight. Low temperature is not the direct cause of fever, low temperature + dirty is. And I was directly opposite my friend upstairs. No matter how the temperature was adjusted, the room was above 27 degrees and hot.
The only good thing about this hotel, the comfort of the pillows and bed is not bad. The next day I moved to the Marriott next door. The 1,000 yuan room fee not only provided breakfast, but the bed was also very comfortable. Although this Marriott is older than other Marriotts, it is quite sincere for the price. Kill this Ritz Carlton.
In the last afternoon tea of 599 yuan, the child asked to order black tea. The waiter said that the child should not drink black tea and drink juice, so he asked for 5 cups of juice, 2 cups were given away, and the remaining 3 cups were 108 yuan a cup. The children took a few sips, but they didn't drink it, it was sour. There are a lot of small desserts left, I ate a few, and they are very ordinary. Seriously not recommended.
Very disappointed hotel. Not recommended.

The buffet at night was generally good, especially the tuna sashimi was very fresh, and the roast leg of lamb was also delicious. The Chinese dishes are really not flattering, they are too oily and tasteless. The breakfast the next day was even more disappointing. The most common fried dough sticks were not crispy and not fragrant. The room facilities are very good, the bed and pillows are very comfortable, and the charging plug is sufficient.

The mini bar has drinks, wine, and full-capsule coffee machines and snacks. The tea bags and ice cubes for the call are delivered to the satisfaction of the service. Bathrobes and slippers are relatively thick and comfortable, and the electric curtains are a bit weird. When eating in a restaurant, there are few self-service dishes to choose from. There should be preferential policies for in-house guests. The restaurant’s service is okay, and the breakfast is also less.

msg:I was really disappointed when I stayed this time. The Ritz-Carlton knows what the hotel is as soon as I hear the name. Looking at the pictures on Ctrip, I think it’s not bad. But when I get to the hotel, I feel like the elevator is too old. When I enter the room, I see that the room facilities are ageing and the fixed double bed room is actually on the third floor. It is too speechless. I am very unhappy and want to change to another place to live. I asked the front desk to ask for Ctrip, (a lot of omitted here Word) I said that the order can’t be cancelled until 9pm. I think I’m in a bad mood and I’m very upset to live here 😕. Fortunately, there is a bar at the door. The environment is not bad. I went to eat something and felt better. When I went back, I thought about taking a bath and going to bed. As a result, the shower leaked more water than the shower head, and the shower also sprayed water out. Alas, after washing, I thought I could rest, but I saw that the sheets were broken. I didn’t expect this class of hotel sheets to have a hole. I forgot to say that there is no coffee machine or coffee. I ordered 2 rooms. No one was there until 12 noon when I was going to check out. I actually saw a car with a sign hanging on the room where no one had written, but there was no sanitation at the door. Shouldn't I ask about it before checking out? There was no communication at all and there was someone in the room. Although the person in that room went out, I didn’t say what room card was still in my hand. I really felt that it was not appropriate.

msg:Every time I live in Ritz-Carlton, I can experience the best service and feel at home. This time I stayed on the executive floor. When checking out, the customer service asked about my staying experience in detail. When I learned that I felt inside the room When my mattress is a little soft, the customer service noted on my file that a slightly harder palm mattress will be prepared next time in advance, and replaced before check-in. Compared with many 3000+ hotels, the service is more intimate and the price is higher. Reasonable, I highly recommend staying, and I also recommend the Ritz-Carlton in Tianjin and Shanghai. The experience is also very good [呲牙]

msg:In the hotel booked by Ctrip, I booked a New Year’s Eve check-in in advance. I was very satisfied with all the services. The only regret is that there are too many people to line up for breakfast, but it is understandable that the hotel restaurant is slightly inexperienced and tired. To deal with it, make some suggestions. The restaurant should be able to understand the needs of the guests for breakfast, so that it can be better, and it will not be so busy.

msg:整體服務還算可以吧。沒什麼大毛病。
首先感謝酒店幫忙佈置紀念日儀式感。很滿意。非常感謝！
關於服務員，有面帶微笑很熱情的。有見到了人跟沒見到一樣的。
辦理入住的前台工作人員很細心，很熱情，很滿意。
如果説是五星級酒店，服務員見到客人至少要面帶微笑打招呼。17層游泳場地和健身房那個需要簽字掃健康寶那裡的小前台工作人員沒有微笑，沒有主動打招呼。反而是浴室內的保潔阿姨，給房間送小童浴袍的客房服務人員都很熱情，很禮貌。關於服務，真是鮮明對比。
晚餐自助餐，提前一天預訂了位置，給了一個很奇葩的位置，沒看出來什麼優勢，反而是個過道，後來自己換了窗外景觀的位置，真不知道預訂餐位意義何在？
餐廳廚師都很熱情的和你説早上好，幫你介紹食物，餐廳服務員沒有餐廳廚師熱情。我很不理解。

msg:During the Olympic Games more than ten years ago, I lived here for more than a month because of work, but I didn’t expect to come back and live for more than ten years. I found this hotel voucher when I was looking for a swimming pool for my child. It is very cost-effective. The breakfast and dinner included in the two large and two small ones are worth the ticket price. It is very suitable for a two-child family to spend a weekend. The children also had a great time playing in the swimming pool. Room delivery because the two children are also given free extras. I encountered a small problem during check-in, but Ctrip and the hotel quickly resolved it after communication. The hotel also offered to delay check-out until four o'clock, and parking for more than seven hours was also exempted.

特此感謝親愛的Melody和 Victoria. 好巧遇到了四川姑娘，頓感親切。
有人説 麗思裝修很老舊了， 但是我很喜歡這種有點復古的調調。
沒預訂早餐，因為想去試一下北京的美食， 但是麗思也很好的給送了早， （雖然不那麼好吃）😂😂😂😂但是感受很好
總的來説，非常值得， 下一次去還住麗思

msg:不怎麼寫評價不過這次確實有點離譜。
一，提前一天打電話問我需要什麼房，幾點來，我説了兩點前台説沒問題肯定可以入住，然後我一點左右到了，讓我等一下，我説沒問題，然後兩點我再過來説房間還沒準備好，要不要換一間，但那間有煙味，我？？？？然後又找房間換折騰了十幾分鍾才有房。這樣搞你給我提前打電話幹嘛呢？而且就在我等的時候旁邊有人跟我一樣的房直接就住進去了，不懂。
二，這個是最離譜的，如果我不是有事情，我肯定得找經理要個説法。我進到房間二十分鐘左右，脱了衣服準備午睡，這個時候有服務人員敲門，我趕緊穿衣服起來，並且喊了稍等，剛走到門口，那個人居然自己用門口把房門打開了？？？？？？不是，這是ritz 嗎？還是錦江之星？錦江之星也不會這麼幹吧？？然後服務員大媽打開門看着我，我都愣住了，她説你是不是要換杯子？我根本沒有打電話或者在前台提過這個要求！這樣隨隨便便進我的房間，萬一我衣服沒穿好呢？？？服務員走後我給前台打了電話，然後前台就沒回饋了，也沒道歉，也沒打電話過來説明，什麼也沒有。自如七天都不至於這樣
三，莫名其妙的沒有開夜床，放了個紙條説什麼服務員沒空之類的，我也沒仔細看，反正已經零分了。

總而言之不會再來了，真的是震驚了

再説一下服務，每一位工作人員都非常貼心到位，尤其是行政酒廊的經理唐志濤，非常專業和周到，給了我們很多幫助，讓我們省去了去大堂退房等待的過程。 在此非常感謝他！！
行政酒廊真的從早吃到晚，每一頓飯都很到位，雖然沒有南京西安的種類多，但是也很夠吃了，早餐還可以單點。
麗思尊享午餐簡餐:非常好吃，每天的東西都不一樣。

msg:1.提前兩週預訂了房間，過了幾天突然發現房價降了，差額2000多塊，請攜程諮詢酒店原因，回覆就是正常調價，沒有原因，作為這個級別的酒店，能發生這樣的情況？？
2.到達酒店當天，中午一點多了，沒房間，等多久不知道，大堂還不如漢庭大，站的地方都沒有，也沒有人過問我們在哪裡等，就在大堂亂轉。下午四點多才拿到房間。這確定是麗思卡爾頓的服務？
我認為應該給差評。

以上是優點。

真的太舊了，淋浴間的牆磚都開裂了，花灑永遠都在慢慢的移動角度，半個平方米的淋浴間真的不夠人隨着它走……洗漱杯是兩個一大一小的玻璃杯，好歹也湊齊一個大小啊。固定的潤膚液瓶都已經空了，沒人補。早餐品種是我見過最無可選擇的，走了兩圈，吃了碗麪。

不會再去。

但是酒店客房服務真心拉垮…在入住預訂時就明確備註了需要加濕器！而且備註內容酒店也有進行過確認！！！但是辦理入住時，前台也再次確認需要加濕器！我以為沒有任何問題，就外出辦事了。
結果晚上較晚回到酒店，一點沒看到加濕器的影子……由於比較晚當時也懶得去反饋，不過確實南方來的半夜被幹到睡不着！！！！！！！也不知道斷斷續續有沒有睡滿2小時……呵呵
於是第二天一大早去反饋這個問題，跟我説，“我去問問有沒有多的退出來的加濕器”…………你們酒店就是這樣服務的？我預訂時的留言都是空話？？？？？？
真心拉垮，這家麗思永遠拉黑！！！
白瞎了行政酒廊那麼好的服務，硬生生被客房服務害慘了

不足之處：（1）早餐過於簡單，不夠豐富，廚藝也有待提高；（2）電梯門口應備些消毒洗手液和紙巾，以保證防疫之需。

是一次不錯的選擇 （有個小問題是房間門不易關上容易虛掩着 當時服務人員以為沒人然後進來有點尷尬…
