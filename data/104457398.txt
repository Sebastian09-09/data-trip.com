msg:The experience was great. The hotel was beautiful however when we got to our room the drain was a little smelly. The shower drain was a little clogged up and water was going out slowly. Struggled to up and close the bathtub stopper, the hotel staff even had to call someone to come and fix it. Whilst at the hot springs someone decided to wear my partners shoes. 
Enjoyed the breakfast but wished they would cater to foreigners especially for lunch and dinner, had to go out somewhere to find food as the location where the hotel is situated is a bit further from the city central.

After checking in, I found that the environment was very pleasant. Everyone greeted me warmly. The room was very spacious and quiet. The outdoor pool was cleaned in advance every time to avoid fallen leaves and flying insects. The hotel has many small activities every day for everyone to participate in. It was quite interesting. It was a very pleasant two days. Junjun, Xiaochen and Xiaoli were all very enthusiastic. It was just that the sound of water was a bit loud and not soundproof. The water from the wash basin next door was particularly loud here, and it was a bit noisy. When I left, I was given a souvenir, which was very nice.

Facilities: I checked it when I booked it. The hotel will be open in 2023, so the equipment and facilities are very good. There is a tea set in the house, and you can bring your own tea to make tea. The bedding is very comfortable, and the bathroom and shower are good; the only shortcoming is that our children mentioned that there is no balconyüòÑ
Service: I must praise the hotel's service staff, who are very warm and thoughtful, and the details are also very good. The service attitude is even better. The room I booked did not have a hot spring ticket. Those two days happened to be my daughter's birthday. The hotel gave us two days of hot springs. Ah Hui, Junjun, and Xiao Li were all great, including the restaurant service staff.
Meals: The hotel's breakfast is very good, the noodles and noodles are very good, and the hotel's food ingredients are very fresh and the quality of the ingredients is also good. Although the restaurant is not large, the number of meals provided is very rich, the coffee beans are also good, and the American style is quite fragrant. Although I don‚Äôt know what beans are purchased, it is much better than many hotels.

Special mention: When the hotel learned that the child was having a birthday, it took the initiative to decorate the room for the child.

This shows that the management of Huazhu Huajiantang in Qingcheng Mountain is very good, from top to bottom. Every service staff has a good grasp of the service spirit and service attitude. The experience is very good. The customer's experience is your most intuitive feedback. Customers are flesh and blood, and have feelings. Thank you üôè

As soon as I came in, I was attracted by the unique courtyard and lobby. Thanks to Junjun and Xiao Liu at the front desk for their hospitality. They upgraded us to a large room with a terrace. It was very pleasant to sit on the terrace and enjoy the view.
The room is very spacious and elegant, the two beds are very comfortable, the bathroom is clean and tidy, and the supplies are complete. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of the entrance of Qingcheng Mountain, and you can quickly go down the mountain to the hotel to rest.

The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped us apply for two room cards and pick up the luggage. Sent luggage. Since we checked in early in the morning, the store manager sister specially extended the check-out time for us. When we left, there was a power outage in the hotel (government line renovation). The cleaning lady also enthusiastically helped us carry our luggage down to the 3rd floor; The rooming process was also very pleasant. The lady at the front desk not only gave us a small gift, but also sent us to the parking space and watched us leave. The service of the entire hotel is worthy of 5 stars. Special thanks to Junjun, Yiyi, Xiaoyang and Han. There are four front desk ladies, two cleaning ladies and a beautiful store manager whose names I don‚Äôt know.
Hotel environment and facilities:
The hotel is located next to Qingcheng Mountain, only 2 kilometers away from Qianshan. The hotel has just been renovated, and the facilities are very new.

Four pieces The covers and mattresses are clean and suitable, and I can sleep very comfortably. Due to cloudy days and power outages, the photos of the room are a bit dark~
Pity:
Due to the power outage and late check-in, I didn't get to experience the hotel's hot springs and other activities. I hope I can make up for it next time. It is also recommended to equip the bathtub with a non-slip mat with a suction cup so that the back has a place to lean on and it will not be too slippery; In addition, you can provide some bubble bath balls to make taking a bath no longer boring.

On the first day of the first ***** month, I came to Qingcheng Mountain Huajiantang for a rest. I didn‚Äôt do any planning before the trip.

The two butlers, Junjun and Hanhan, were very considerate. They inquired about hotel requirements before arrival, and provided travel guides and hotel activity arrangements after check-in.

The hot spring service is very mature. There are several small pools hidden in the bushes and bamboo forests. I originally had a cold, but after soaking in the hot spring for an hour, I recovered without taking any medicine. Finally, I ordered a barbecue near my home. It tasted very good. I paired it with some beer and had a good night's sleep.

This is a hotel suitable for a leisure vacation. Thumbs up!

It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the front gate of Qingcheng Mountain with a battery car. There is an obvious smell around the toilet in the bathroom. I placed 2 orders and missed 1. A dessert coupon. If you want to have lunch and dinner in the hotel, there are few choices. Breakfast is okay, but some dishes should be kept heated.

Although it is summer vacation, the lobby and guest room restaurants are quiet and not noisy. The hotel is about a ten-minute walk from the scenic battery car shuttle station. , very convenient. The only drawback is that the distance between restaurants around the hotel is a bit awkward. It takes more than 20 minutes to walk and 10 minutes to take a taxi. There are not many restaurant options in the hotel. Simple meals are hand-made noodles, and the portions of the set meals for 2-3 people are a bit large. The room is overall good and spacious. It is very comfortable to drink tea, soak in hot springs and eat desserts in the yard. I gave small gifts to the children when I checked in. I also made DIY small items under the leadership of my sister every day. The children loved it very much. In addition, this is a pet-friendly hotel. I will bring my dog ‚Äã‚Äãto stay here next time.

Because I arrived late, I was told that the room type upgrade I selected when booking was no longer available. I communicated and asked for an upgrade to another room type. Although there were vacancies, I was not given an upgrade in the end. If I don‚Äôt get an upgrade, I won‚Äôt be upgraded. But the feeling when entering the room is even worse. Not long after, two little Xiaoqiang came over and notified the front desk. The front desk sent someone to take Xiaoqiang away and that was it. After the children went to the toilet, the toilet became clogged again (the picture is so beautiful that I won‚Äôt post the photo). , it was too late, I was too tired after driving all day, and I didn‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of changing rooms, otherwise I would definitely have to ask them to change rooms, but I was drunk because they didn‚Äôt take the initiative to mention changing rooms. The overall decoration feels like a simple upgraded version of a business hotel. It is completely sorry for the price of more than 1,000 per night. The breakfast is also very simple and cannot reach the level of a five-star hotel at this price. Overall feeling: Come here with excitement and return with disappoin**ent.

msg:I just lived in Huajiantang in Qingyang Palace in Chengdu. Compared with Qingchengshan, it is worse.
Location: The hotel is on Neusoft Avenue, a 5-minute drive from the high-speed rail station. The hotel has a pick-up bus, but the operating hours are from 9 to 5, and advance reservation is required. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the battery car pick-up and drop-off point in Qianshan. It is quite hard to walk on a hot day.
Facilities: The hotel is newly opened, with a modern and simple decoration style. The disadvantage is that it does not have the characteristics of Mount Qingcheng. Equipped with hot springs, 12 soup pools, all outdoors, 2 special pools, other pools are similar, and the overall hot spring scale is relatively small. The breakfast is relatively rich, but dinner is not available until 8 o'clock, and the surrounding area is relatively desolate, and it is difficult to find a place to eat, so if you are staying, arrange dinner early. There is a self-service laundry room, which can be used for washing and drying, but it is strongly recommended not to allow guests to help themselves, and the hotel will arrange the laundry in a unified manner. I also gave suggestions to the front desk staff, hoping to improve.
The cooling effect of the air conditioner in the room is mediocre, and the temperature must be adjusted below 20 degrees. I adjusted it to 25 and 22, and I was woken up by the heat for two days at night...
The overall feeling is that the hotel facilities and services are "existing but not excellent". Many of them are simply provided, not based on the needs of guests, and there is still room for improvement.

The restaurant next to it is not very used to eating. It is recommended to eat in Huajian. After eating tomato oxtail pot, the child is very full.

msg:After a day of layover in Chengdu, I saw this hot spring hotel at the foot of Qingcheng Mountain, so I made a decisive decision.
The environment and facilities of the room are very good, very quiet, better than too many five-star hotels. It‚Äôs a bit unexpected to go to the guest room to drink freely. There‚Äôs nothing to say about the breakfast. The set meal I ordered at the restaurant at noon to catch the plane is too much for two people. In addition Before lunch, I exchanged two Haagen-Dazs with the coupon given by the front desk, and made ice powder for one night, which is also very good.
Finally, let me talk about the bad points. I went for the hot springs, but I was very disappointed. The Tangquan area itself is very small. It is said that there are 12 pools, large and small. It is estimated that half of them are not open at night, even if there are a few open pools. , the temperature is also very low.

msg:It was around 3:00 in the morning when we arrived at Huajiantang. It turned out to be opposite Six Senses. Although it is not as big as Six Senses, the environment is good. The room is not small, the bathroom is large, and the hygiene is satisfactory. The dining area on the first floor is not big, and it is outside It feels very comfortable to eat, and the fried rice is cold (we went early for breakfast). The service staff in the restaurant are indifferent. Maybe too many customers have caused the service level to drop. Overall, it is worth recommending

msg:A very good stay experience! First of all, the room is very large, the decoration is simple, and the practicality is very strong. The feeling of staying in is very friendly and feels like home. Secondly, the service staff is very good, and the hotel took the initiative to take responsibility for the mistakes that occurred because of my own memory confusion. I am very touched! Third, the breakfast is very cost-effective. There are not many varieties of food, but there are all meat, egg, lacto and vegetarian staple foods, which taste very good, and the time arrangement is also very reasonable.
In short, this Huajiantang is a very, very recommended hotel. If you go to Chengdu, I strongly recommend staying here, it will leave good memories for the trip

msg:From check-in to departure, a very pleasant journey:
From the receptionist to the room service to the manager on duty, they greet each time and make us feel at home
For parent-child activities, it is also a great experience for my brother (Xiao Li) to make kimchi.
When leaving, in order to match our time, the manager on duty even had his own car to take us to the station.
For Qingcheng Mountain, it contains enthusiasm.

msg:The service was great. We arrived early and the room was not yet available. Then we checked in at the front desk and the lady gave us two coupons for dessert and tea. It's great for us with kids. Then it was time to check in at the hotel. The young lady was always leading us and introduced everyone one by one when we entered. The environment is good and relatively smart. There is golf, and there are bubbles in the hot springs, so the children have a lot of fun. Overall, it's pretty good. Hanhan and another waiter (sorry I forgot the name) provided excellent service.
