msg:Stayed our last 3 nights in the Beijing Four Seasons hotel(the first 4 nights in Regent)from 1-3-24 to 4-3-24, room no.1703. 

The up is the room and the facility. The room is spacious, comfy and good view from the bathroom. Also, the pool and sauna are great with good service.

The down is the breakfast and the receptionist.  The breakfast area is in the lobby instead of the restaurant, which is a lack of manpower as no one standing in the reception of the breakfast area in our first 2 days, also they didn't get your plate off promptly when you finished your meal, just last day we saw the staff in the gate of breakfast area for service, maybe someone "Big" came to stay! The taste and the choice of the food are just okay, I think worse than Beijing Regent.

Also, the receptionists always keep a bad face during check-in and check-out, no respect, I find it hard to believe I stayed in the Four Seasons hotel! To be honest, the service is far away from Hong Kong and Bangkok's Four Seasons hotel.

Overall, just average stayed, the service can be much better.

Conveniently located only 30 mins from the airport and once there near the metro for easy moving around the city. The cleanliness and service was wonderful and the room was clean and well appointed with all necessities. I highly recommend getting a booking with access to the club lounge on 26th floor. The club breakfast was fantastic and complimented with great views overlooking Beijing. The staff were warm and friendly making every interaction memorable. Highly recommended and I‚Äôm looking forward to my next afoul Seasons visit.

Location: You can walk to Blue Harbor, Chaoyang Park, and Pop Mart Theme Park. If you are applying for a US visa, you can also walk there if you stay here, which is very convenient. It is recommended to take a boat to Blue Harbor at night.
Service: Excellent service
Sanitary facilities: It is an old hotel, but not old, which may be related to the decoration style. The swimming pool has a small soaking pool suitable for children. The room is said to be 45 square meters, but it does not feel small in reality. It feels much larger than the 50 square meters of Kerry Center.
Breakfast: It has everything it should have, but there is nothing special. It is much better than the four seasons in Singapore, and there are many local specialty breakfasts.
The other disadvantage is that there is no parking lot, which is not very convenient for self-driving.

At least the attitude aspect is perfect, and a few small requirements can be met, except that the dental equipment is not equipped. Very suitable for young children. If there are other facilities (such as children's playground and parent-child activities), I think it will be more attractive to the hard-working baby walkers. Here is a look at the behavior of some "high-end luxury" people in China who ask a third party to place a few dolls on a bed sheet, "as if they are parents but not parents." Our parents also have basic aesthetics, okay? The little prince‚Äôs room is beautifully designed! In addition, Ms. Zhang at the front desk is very enthusiastic and likes it.

There is no doubt that Four Seasons‚Äô hardware, service, and breakfast are all good.
The details of the room are well arranged
shortcomings
I paid nearly 900 for the executive room I stayed in for my two children with executive benefits.
I feel that afternoon tea and dinner are too simple and have no highlights.

msg:Four Seasons has always been my constant choice. When traveling, what matters most to me is the experience of staying: the Four Seasons room is oversized and the bedding is comfortable. Although it is old, it still has low-key luxury. Rooms are cleaned twice a day, and the service staff are meticulous in their service concept. The hardware and software are all online. The only time I heard the doorbell was around nine o'clock in the morning. When I didn't open the door, the service staff opened the door and came in. We were all still sleeping at that time. A little displeased. The heating in the north is too stuffy, and we simply can‚Äôt stand the high temperature of more than 30 degrees. Four Seasons Hotel can adjust your room to the mode you want according to your needs. This is one of the reasons why I always choose Four Seasons. Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages. , even if I stayed for four days, there was no welcome fruit. I only stayed for one night in Tianjin Four Seasons, and there was no welcome fruit. It is not very convenient if you come from the subway with your luggage. However, it is more convenient to take a taxi during the Spring Festival. The roads are empty. I have stayed at five Four Seasons hotels in China and all have good experiences. I hope that the Four Seasons hotel will always maintain its original intention and look forward to seeing you next time.

msg:Despite the low temperature of minus ten degrees outside, as soon as I returned to the hotel, I was instantly touched by the warm smiles. Starting from the reception at the foyer, think about what the guests think and do what the guests do. Sometimes a simple sentence "The car hasn't arrived yet, please wait inside, it's too cold outside" is enough. The temperature control and color tone of the room are very comfortable, and it is particularly pleasant to brew a pot of old white tea that you brought with you. Special thanks go to the housekeeping staff, who found that the mineral water we used to make tea was in high demand and specially prepared enough drinking water for us the next day. It is also our habit to read while drinking tea. Unexpectedly, the housekeeping staff even prepared a bookmark for us, which was very thoughtful! The breakfast is also very unique, with a full range of Chinese and Western styles!

msg:Having stayed in hotels so many times, this time I must give thumbs up to the Four Seasons Hotel in Beijing. I struggled for many days before booking the room. I thought that the Four Seasons Hotel Shenzhen in Guangzhou was not bad before, and the Four Seasons Hotel in Beijing was in a very good location, so I planned to book it. However, some reviews said that the service was not good, so I hesitated and struggled. For a long time. In the end, I made the decision because there was a suite suitable for children. I am detail-oriented and picky. But this time I really kept telling my friends that I was very satisfied. First of all, before checking in, the hotel contacted me in advance about the housing requirements. I told the customer service that one day during my stay was a child's birthday, and the hotel arranged a sense of ceremony for us. The small details were enough to move me. Another reason is that we were on a family trip and needed to go out to various attractions very early in the morning. I called the catering depar**ent and they packed the breakfast we needed and took it out for us. I have never tried to do this in so many hotels. Very humane. And the staff are so enthusiastic. Children greet the ladies enthusiastically when they see them. What a great stay.

msg:Even though the overall facilities of the hotel are a bit old, they are well maintained and clean. Needless to say, extremely comfortable bedding is Four Seasons‚Äô traditional strength! Because it was noted on Ctrip in advance that it was an anniversary, it was great to be upgraded to an executive room and given flowers.

However, I did not receive any contact or return visit from the hotel staff in advance. I didn't receive any handwritten greeting cards or welcome gifts. The room attendant didn't even seem to know much about turndown service. This is really inappropriate for a hotel of Four Seasons' level. If you want to have breakfast, you need to get up early. If you arrive late, you may even have to queue up awkwardly in the lobby, like a penalty stand.

Overall, the maintenance and rooms are still supporting the Four Seasons brand, but the service staff needs more training and implementation details. ps. Because I was dressed casually that day, I was even asked by the doorman what I was doing. Is this not the Four Seasons‚Äô way of hospitality?

Even checking emails has an abnormal card as shown in the picture. Even ordering takeout is stuck. This is an experience I have never had in a five-star hotel of the same level. In the past year, I stayed at Four Seasons in Tianjin, Four Seasons in Toronto and South Korea. Seoul has never had any network speed problems at all seasons. I think the situation of saving money even on the Internet is really incomprehensible to me. Let me just say a simple word about check-in at the front desk.

msg:Traveling to Beijing with children. After visiting Universal Studios, Nuojin moved to the Four Seasons. Here‚Äôs how I felt these two days:
1. The location is good. It is near the Liangmaqiao Embassy District. It is very convenient for shopping and eating. In the past few days, I have tried all the nearby Quanjude, Jingweizhai, Koufuju, Azerbaijan National Pavilion, and Middle Eastern Arabic cuisine, and I have not missed anything.
2. Although the hotel was renovated in 19 years due to its age, it is a bit older than other places such as Four Seasons in Guangzhou, but it has complete facilities and is clean and tidy. Especially the service exceeded expectations. I didn't expect good service when I came to the capital. But the service at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beijing is indeed better than expected. As soon as the vehicle arrived at the door, someone came to open the door and pick up the luggage. Although there were two people opening the door for guests at the hotel door, they also opened the door late at night and early in the morning. The front desk was professional and the check-in was fast. The room was cleaned quickly and clean. There was a turndown service. Every waiter greeted me with a smile and made me feel comfortable. Originally, check-out was delayed until 2 o'clock in the afternoon because the child was not feeling well and needed a rest. After communication, check-out was postponed to 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
3. I didn‚Äôt ask for breakfast because I left early in the morning, but I asked for in-room meal delivery twice, which was still good and fast. Both children ate it up.
All in all, it is highly recommended to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel when visiting Beijing.

Although the old-fashioned hotel does not have so many intelligent facilities and equipment, it is really comfortable to stay in these few days, and it feels like coming home, especially the service staff of the hotel, the service attitude is very good, very considerate!
Thank you very much to the two beauties Clara and Jonna from the guest depar**ent, who made us have a pleasant parent-child time in the four seasons. Before leaving, I even gave the children BYE BYE Gift, which is really considerate!
Next time I come, I will choose Four Seasons Vacation!

From the moment of arrival, to help with luggage, to check-in at the front desk, to the room and restaurant and executive lounge experience, it was almost perfect. The service attitude of the executive lounge team Angela, Kathy and Justin was very good and impressive. Except for a small incident during dinner at Cai Yi Xuan, the processing speed and results were good. Aaron, the restaurant manager, came to the executive lounge to explain the situation, and I brought a bottle of wine to the room and the response was fast and efficient when using the FS app. Finally, please pay attention to the maintenance of the hardware. When I checked in and used the elevator that day, the buttons were not sensitive. Also, because it had been a while since my last check-in, the front desk did not explain it in detail when checking in because the room had executive lounge benefits.

He was really very kind and gave me two cute little rabbitsüê∞. As for the hardware, we have stayed at the Little Prince in Four Seasons in Guangzhou before. In comparison, the room in Beijing is smaller. The one disadvantage is that the outside of the room faces a large equipment room with two windows and no view. The one in Guangzhou is on the 90th floor. It feels like you are living in the clouds. The scenery is really incredible. Overall, this was a pleasant experience.

msg:What you do in terms of service really gives people a full experience
After booking the room, there will be a dedicated customer service contact soon
Butler-style service starts from scratch and is extremely meticulous
After learning that it is a birthday-themed reservation
More than a room arrangement with flowers and cakes
It also specially took care of the scenery outside the window and the details of the furnishings
A commendable small detail is the room card, which is printed with the guest's photo
After check-in, you can also take away special small souvenirs

The room facilities are stable, hot water and air conditioner
It can meet the needs. Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are always new
Moderate size, not too big in the suite, but the layout is great
The square is square and the south is the north. The layout is quite satisfactory!

msg:The room is very good, the location is good, and it is convenient to travel. The only point is that this hotel does not have its own garage, and there are more than ten parking spaces at the entrance. If the parking is full, you need to go to the parking lot next door by yourself. There is no cap for 10 yuan an hour. After staying for four days, the parking fee cost more than 300 yuan. I feel that as a five-star hotel, it is unreasonable not to have this configuration.

It was the May Day holiday, and there were a lot of guests in the hotel. Ms. Helen Hu from the Four Seasons Hotel coordinated with me many times to arrange our 4 rooms adjacent to each other, so that our family of four generations could gather together happily. The hotel also thoughtfully arranged wheelchairs. We had just arrived at the hotel, and the service staff pushed the wheelchair. After lunch at Mio restaurant, the service staff delivered a well-prepared cake. They not only helped us take pictures, but also made a birthday card for the old mother. , so that the old mother and our family are very happy! The rooms are also well-decorated. Cakes are prepared in the mother's room, and snacks are prepared in the children's room. I am very grateful to the four seasons for allowing us to spend a few days of very happy holidays.

This time I came to Beijing again and finally had the opportunity to stay here again. Needless to say, the luxury and comfort of the Four Seasons Hotel, I think what makes it stand out is that this hotel pays great attention to details, which can be said to be a model in the industry in this regard. The cleanliness and comfort of the room are impeccable. I live in a room with the window facing east. Every morning the spring sun shines on the room, which makes people feel warm and refreshed. The large-scale gym and the beautiful swimming pool are very well designed, and the hot lemon ginger tea in it is delicious. The rich Chinese and Western style breakfast is a perfect combination of real ingredients and superb cooking skills. The guests who come here are either rich or expensive, and they all take luxury cars such as Da Ben Da Lao Alpha. I may be the only guest who checks in with a mountain bike. Thanks to the concierge for helping me store my bike every day. Finally, a special thanks to GE-Clara for the handwritten hand-painted welcome graphic, which is the most beautiful Chinese writing and stick figure I have ever seen.

After waiting for 10 minutes, the waiter brother guided us and sent the luggage to the room. Thank you very much for their service, caring and thoughtful. The room is clean and tidy, cleaned twice a day in the morning and evening, and the laundry service is also very good. The hotel has two Michelin-starred black pearl restaurants, MIO and Cai Yixuan. We have tried both of them. The dishes are both ornamental and delicious. In particular, MIO is the Fine Dining in my heart. I will visit MIO next time I come to Beijing. The breakfast at the Four Seasons Hotel has a lot of variety and tastes good. The coffee and special drinks are all very good. During the meal, I saw the executive chef of MIO and his team members busy. I like the spa and fitness center of the hotel. The swimming pool is small but clean, with jacuzzi, rain shower, steam room and sauna. The tea room outside is very secluded and pleasant. All in all, Four Seasons Hotel Beijing brings us good memories.

I have stayed in five-star hotels of various brands before, but this time I wanted to hand over the family trip to a hotel that pays special attention to service, so I chose the Four Seasons Hotel, and marked "I hope to be impressed" on the order. The day before check-in, Jonna from the guest experience depar**ent contacted me and asked me when I arrived, the age of the child, and asked for a photo of the child. This is the first time I heard that the photo can be printed on the room card as a souvenirüòÅ. Because we are two big and two small, the room was upgraded to a larger Four Seasons Suite. The room is elegant, the bedding is very comfortable, and the welcome fruit dessert is nice and delicious. The dinner in the executive lounge has a different theme every day, and the quality is very high. Every day for breakfast and dinner, the brothers and sisters can chat with us kindly. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, everything is delicious. The swimming pool is large and small, the water temperature is high and comfortable, and the small swimming pool also has a massage function. The lobby bar can make cocktails to my liking which is great. Thank you to the executive lounge team for the greeting card when we checked in and the doll for our baby on the day we checked out. This stay was really impressive and the service was excellent. In addition, the hotel is located in the embassy district, and there are many restaurants. Guests can walk along the Liangma River behind the hotel, and walk all the way to Blue Harbor.

The most shocking thing was that even though we knew we were bringing children, the room we arranged was actually a room type where a four-year-old child could easily reach the window handle and open the window. Ctrip had asked in advance whether we were bringing a boy or a girl, so that it was easier to arrange the room in advance. I prepared children's supplies, but after checking in, there were no children's supplies. I asked the front desk to send children's supplies separately, but I didn't find anything related to the boy. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge is a set meal and the taste is average. The happy hour in the evening is also not satisfactory. It is basically fast food, such as fried chicken. I won‚Äôt consider coming here again.

msg:The day before I checked in, I received a call from the front desk of the hotel, asking in detail about the expected arrival time of the hotel, personal preferences and requirements, which is in line with the brand image of Four Seasons in my mind. After staying for one night, there are good and bad. From the overall impression, the catering part of Beijing Four Seasons is much better than the housekeeping. The facilities and decoration of the restaurant, the presentation of the products, and the service of the staff. It is a matter of course to have two restaurants with one Michelin star. , The silver tableware in the executive lounge, the only complaint is that the wmf stainless steel tableware used for breakfast on the first floor has been used for too long, and the surface is in a frosted state. The room service part starts with the room facilities. The mattress is very comfortable and sleeps well. It ranks among the top three among all the hotels I have stayed in. The pillows are still soft and the bedding is top-notch. Kohler for bathroom, even in 2012, is not worthy of the luxury hotel positioning of Four Seasons. In actual use, the length of the bathtub is good, and it is relatively comfortable. Basin faucets have the same physical feel as household faucets 20 years ago. Wash hands with boiling water. The water temperature adjus**ent and spray switch of the shower has to be unscrewed a large turn, and there is no indication of which direction to turn. The marble cover on the gutter under the flower sun is loose, and it shakes if I step on it accidentally, and I can't find a non-slip mat... The power cord of the desk lamp is obviously without a piece of wire, and a wall plug is broken. The hygienic condition can only be described as mediocre. There is dust accumulation on the glass shelves on both sides of the sink. The windows of this room type are not too big, and the interior of the room is darker. In fact, it is easy to cover up some dead spots. But the most ridiculous thing is the guest supplies. The combs and toothbrushes provided have nothing to do with luxury hotels. The candy delivered to the room is Hsu Fu Kee. Using these guest supplies is really branding yourself. At 2:00 that night, the hotel had a power outage for half an hour for maintenance. I called the front desk and said that there was a guest letter in the room, but I did not see the guest letter. When I checked out, I mentioned this again, but the front desk staff still said there was a guest letter. I went back to the room at 2 o'clock to pick up the luggage. I re-made the room card at the front desk for the first time, but I couldn't open it when I went to the room, and I went down to re-make the room card. The doorman is very good at opening and pulling the door. Overall, I feel that this hotel pays more attention to catering, and the professional image of catering staff is better than housekeeping. The magnificent lobby is willing to be decorated with a lot of flowers, but the guest rooms provide such cheap guest supplies. Treat others like yourself from the outside to the inside.

I have been familiar with them for consecutive stays recently. In order to make our stay more comfortable, Wang Tianxin specially arranged our room on the same floor as the executive lounge, and the executive lounge is just outside the door. It was so convenient for the elderly with two children, and there was another surprise when she came back from dinner. She was worried that the two children would be hungry and had nothing to eat at night, so she specially sent a fruit plate and cupcakes. So careful and considerate, no wonder the kids are clamoring to come to Sisi to find their big sister on weekends.
Daniel's service in the executive lounge is also very thoughtful. He helps the children prepare drinks and children's tableware. He is also friendly to the children. I am so happy that I can't put it down, I am very happy.
There was a small accident in the swimming pool locker room. After swimming, my locker could not be opened. I happened to meet the employee Jason. After hearing my situation, he immediately took the master key to help me open the locker door, and patiently explained how to use it correctly. . I also put forward my opinion. The text on how to use the cabinet lock is too small for our elders to see. He also immediately wrote down my room number and said it would be reflected to the hotel.
Every time we stay, we are taken care of by the staff of various depar**ents, which makes us feel very happy and happy. Thank you to every employee who has paid silently and worked hard. Thank you for adding color to our life.

  The interior decoration of the room is very beautiful, the little flowers in the bathroom are very cute, the light in the room is rather dark, and the lamp on the desk is actually broken. . I told you in advance that I hope not to call in the room in the afternoon because of the online exam, but I still called in ü§£ü§£

It's really a very comfortable hotel. The service is so considerate. When I placed the order, I noted that children need an extra bed. Arrangements have been made when we arrive. The children's supplies are also readily available, and they are all set up. Very caring feeling. And the extra bed for children in Four Seasons is completely free! Breakfast is also free for small pot friends, and small pot friends over 120cm are also free, which seems to be based on age.

Service: Very enthusiastic. They come to help with luggage as soon as you get off the car. Everyone really pays attention to customer needs. The two beauties at the front desk also had sweet smiles and were very kind. praise.
Hygiene: It's pretty good, and it won't make people feel like they don't want to use it.
The location is really good, just a few minutes walk to the embassy. Very smooth.
The kid who went out threw away the red panda toy he brought, and was still crying when he returned to the hotel. The beauty at the front desk learned that he had found a way to adjust a giant panda toy, and the little friend was very happy. Thank you so much!
The breakfast is also very good, everything is exquisite, and the strawberries are fresh and delicious.
I will choose Four Seasons next time I need it, great!

msg:This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none.
Starting from the lobby, the concierge at the door stood and chatted, and did not take the initiative to serve when a car came.
Arrived at the front desk service, the front desk staff was generally okay.
Entering the room, the overall facilities are old. Everything is still usable. But there is no welcome fruit and turndown service in a five-star hotel. The waiter said he forgot, which is really ***.
The key point is that the breakfast is terrible. I have never seen such a bad breakfast. There is no dish or food that I am willing to eat a second bite. I put it down after eating one bite. Chinese breakfast: wontons are hard, noodles are rotten, shrimp dumplings are not fresh, meat buns are stiff, and steamed pork ribs are hard to bite.
Western breakfast: cakes are rotten, sticky and sweet, bread is hard to bite, I can accept any croissant, but I can't accept the croissant in this hotel, I have never had it.

I won't say it anymore. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. Four Seasons is not as good as All Seasons

msg:My friend lived in Four Seasons from the 12th to the 13th. I went to find him. When I got on the elevator, I called and went up to the 26th floor without noticing. On the left is the residential area and on the right is the administrative restaurant, where hotel residents on the 26th floor can eat or not, and that time is also the time for hotel guests on that floor, including afternoon tea. I took a look at the administrative restaurant when I saw a good view, but I didn't eat or move anything. After that, a waitress looked me up and down as soon as I came up (because I didn‚Äôt change my clothes that day, it was untidy). When I came up, I asked for my room number. I didn‚Äôt reply to the waiter and said that I am the elevator, and I will accompany you out. I can't understand, anyway, for them, when I got to the 26th floor, I just bought a house and swiped my card. I was shocked that if I didn't reply to the waiter, they could categorically believe that I was not a guest of the hotel, and the second sentence firmly forced me out of the hotel. I said, can I go down by myself? I don't need to be sent. The waitress was disgusting. I laughed and said that I can ask my colleague to send you away. Then she forced me to go up the elevator, and I went up to the fifth floor. The gymnasium on the fifth floor and the small store are places where the public area is not a place where hotel guests can go. But she still stalked me and asked for the room number. I said you can not follow me. She said she didn't follow me. There are two elevators, whichever one I go to, she will go to whichever one. From then on, when she got to the first floor, she kept befriending the guests before letting go. She was looking at her phone leisurely in the elevator. She reached the 26th floor and kept pressing the elevator. A male waiter came and asked her why she didn't come down. She said let him find their leader. Later that female manager came and invited me to the conference room to talk. She kept saying that the waitress didn't disrespect me, it was my misunderstanding. She told me to wait. After that, I waited for nearly half an hour, and a male staff member (I later found out that it was from the security department told me to ask a bigger leader to apologize and then to find a security guy to insult me) came up and yelled frantically that he wanted to do something. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. This is the service of a five-star hotel? Oh my god, you actually called me a fool and said you didn't insult me! The meeting room is paid, so I have to go out, forced to beat me and step on my feet, and the police will arrest me if I don‚Äôt go to the front desk to verify, I said yes, what if I am a hotel guest, he said that he would give me the biggest apology of the hotel. Afterwards, another staff member pulled that person away and said that he could talk about it, because this person had a good attitude, so I didn't say anything more. When my family arrived in the evening, they changed a female supervisor. I asked the hotel how to apologize. She said that I said from the beginning that your hotel said the biggest way to apologize. How do you apologize? She said that different things are different. How should I apologize for this matter? Your hotel doesn't respect guests? He said that this has nothing to do with this matter so he will not speak. I said, didn't you just ask me a question that has nothing to do with this matter? Ask me my age, ask my family. Playing word games all the time, the female manager tried to get close and said to bring the person at that time in for a talk, so she interrupted me, and when I said please don‚Äôt interrupt me, she raised her volume, and I couldn‚Äôt even explain. Keep going in circles from start to finish. It's not an insult to say ******** and then I just quoted the word and the female supervisor said I used the word too so I was insulted too. She said let me talk and kept interrupting me and never finished a sentence. She almost said that I was like her son. In the end, she refused to let me talk about asking my parents for more than an hour, which was completely unreasonable. I haven't even finished my full story once! I would never have imagined this hotel to be so horrible for a 5 star hotel. What made me even more unbelievable was that the bathtub and toilet in the room were extremely dirty. It took me nearly half an hour to find the cleaner, and he said that it was true that they hadn't wiped it clean and said that they would find the cleaner to ask the manager to apologize to me, and there has been no excuse yet. What's even more strange is that my family got up at four o'clock to go to the toilet and found that none of the lights could be turned on and the toilet was completely dark. I got up at ten o'clock to go to the toilet and it was still completely dark. After I called the hotel service staff, it was still the same slow, and finally they called the engineer. Afterwards the hotel hostess called our room and asked if she could come in and check. When I came up, I questioned why I didn‚Äôt call at four o‚Äôclock, but now I can‚Äôt believe it. I didn‚Äôt wear clothes and didn‚Äôt sleep for two hours at four o‚Äôclock in the morning. The lights were dark and I called the staff? I just want to get out of this horrible hotel
Also, when checking in, a staff member in the car said that the leader has a big leader in October, and I feel even more terrible that there are two heads of state living in this hotel. Such things can be said
There is also an afternoon tea that was not included due to "communication"
I left on the evening of the 12th and the 13th in a double room of more than 5,000 because I got the new crown, so I am writing now
I have audio and video almost from beginning to end, and I have photos of each
I don't know why, the video is too big to post

The lounge is quiet and less crowded, and the food is of high quality. It may be because there are many foreigners staying in the hotel, and the happy hour at night is basically exotic cuisine, and the Southeast Asian dishes and salads taste very good. The fitness center is neat and tidy, the service staff is well-equipped, and floor towels are laid at the entrance of each pool entry and shower room, which is in sharp contrast with many hotels.
But there are also some shortcomings. There are some garbage in the bathroom of the room and the room was not cleaned properly, but the floor manager immediately apologized in person, which makes people feel the attitude of the hotel. I waited for nearly 20 minutes for the hot water to come out from the shower, but the top shower never came out. At one point, I felt like I was given an unprepared dirty room for an upgrade.

She was taken care of like a family, and the room type was upgraded for free. There are exquisite hotel moon cakes to eat, and there is a lot of space for children to play. The afternoon tea and dinner in the executive lounge are very delicate. Children want to come to Four Seasons whenever they want to swim on weekends, which shows that the hotel service is really good, and I like the hotel at the door!

For the executive room booked this time, the front desk confirmed the itinerary by phone one day in advance. After knowing that it was a memorial day, I also specially applied for an upgrade to a Four Seasons room, and specially prepared flowers, cakes, fruits, etc. A series of courtesy, the most surprising is the DIY room card that can be kept as a souvenir, my wife likes it very much.
Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are well maintained. During the stay, Carrie asked many times if he needed other services or arrangements that could be assisted. He did not ignore the needs of customers because he stayed for only one night, and finally gave a small gift when he left the hotel. This stay experience is perfect, I look forward to the next stay, thank Four Seasons Hotel Beijing for the perfect service this time!

The city view rooms that can see the Beijing skyline never seem to let me down. The 400 stainless steel butterflies in the atrium make the rooms on every floor feel agile.
In particular, I need to praise Carrie at the front desk for her caring service. She looks for her at check-in and check-out. She is very friendly and adds points to the check-in experience.

At that time, it felt very good. After all, we just came from Guangzhou Four Seasons, and there is no such professional service consciousness there. Since I am an IHG Diamond member, this experience is only available to the high-card members of the group in my mind.
        After the check-in, there are more surprises. First of all, dolls and special equipment for children are prepared for the children. Prepare us a welcome snack fruit. Because we booked for 3 days before and after, and gave us an upgrade.
         The four-season breakfast is ok, which is much better than the Fairmont that we stayed in the day before. The quality of the executive lounge is good, but it may be because we just came to Beijing after eating, drinking and shopping in Guangzhou and Shunde, and we feel that the food is not as good as there.
       All in all, the biggest surprise of this trip to Beijing was brought by the Four Seasons Hotel Carrie. Next time I will continue to check in the Four Seasons Hotel.

The service is very good, and Carrie also set up a special group for me to communicate my needs at any time.
We ordered an executive room with river view, and we upgraded the room. Because it is an executive room, you can enjoy the executive afternoon tea and buffet dinner on the 26th floor for free. Although it is not rich, it is enough for a meal, and the taste is also very good. There are also various wines to choose from in the evening.
The swimming pool is more like a paddling pool for children. It is too shallow and has no swimming lanes. It may be more suitable to bring children. When I went there on weekends, there were a lot of children‚Ä¶
The bed products are all good, but the bed may have been around for a long time, so the two sides are sunken and the middle is protruding, especially on the side close to the door. After giving feedback to Carrie, tell it to the guest room, I hope it can be better in the future.

msg:Although the hotel is old, the overall feeling of staying is still very good. The room was clean overall. Because it is the little yellow duck room that the baby likes. There are tents and slides in the house, and the baby is always running around in socks. At first, I was worried that the carpet was not clean enough. But at the end of the day, the socks are clean. The hotel also prepared sweets for the baby's stay. Baby likes it very much. Room service is very good, basically all requests can be met. The breakfast and afternoon tea in the restaurant are also very good. Also presented afternoon tea on the executive floor. I especially like the toiletries in the room, the full set of Oulong, which tastes very good and works well. I am very satisfied.

msg:The four seasons were originally chosen for the convenience of travel, but the four seasons are really amazing. First of all, my housekeeper, Carrie, is very reliable. She helped me book a restaurant, prepared a gift for my stay, prepared pillows in advance according to my requirements, reminded me that raspberry yogurt should be practical as soon as possible, and so on.
Speaking of the room, although the room is relatively old, it is the same as Beijing Rosewood and Ritz. The material of the room is real, it will not feel worn out when it is old, but it has the style of a European hotel. The hygiene is done well, and the rooms are highly rated.
Speaking of restaurants, I went to a Cantonese restaurant for dinner. The roast duck is quite satisfactory, and the tiger spots are relatively tender. I have lived in Hong Kong for many years, and the restaurant should be at the upper-middle level in the overall Cantonese cuisine I have been to. If you eat Cantonese food occasionally, it should be quite good.
There are bright spots in this fly in the oin**ent: the breakfast category is average, and the American one takes about 15 minutes; there are too many girls in the special service industry at the hotel at night, and it is too strange to scan the code with them at the door.

I like soap and shampoo in the bathroom. The product of this brand has the fragrance of flowers and plants, but the nozzle on the top of the bathroom seems to be broken. The hand-held shower water is very comfortable to wash. Electric curtains in the room and bathroom are very convenient. Slippers should be thick and fluffy to match the seasons. You can ask if you need turn-down service at night. The breakfast variety is not very rich, there are omelettes, fruits, various intestines, breads and so on. All in all, I am quite satisfied.

When I was in the past, the old man was very desolate and aggrieved when he was eating at the door to the people coming in and out. Later, I asked the old man that the attitude of the waiter was also very poor. He kept ordering. I asked for a cup of coffee. It took a long time to deliver it. It didn't get hot when I drank it.

I won‚Äôt talk about the place. The first one is that the 6 bottles of 5100 water in the room are very a**ospheric; the second is that the four-season bedding is as good as ever to my appetite. It is very comfortable and I can fall asleep quickly; the third The service in the executive lounge is very good, the number of staff is very sufficient, everyone is also very kind and enthusiastic, whether it is breakfast or happy hour, the quality of the dishes are also very good, and the drinks are also very rich. The entrance of the executive lounge is responsible for registration and guidance My lady is very well received and very kind; the last one is that the maintenance of the hotel is really meticulous, the outer glass is very clean, and you will not be affected by the dirt on the glass at all. This kind of detail is not done in most hotels. .
There is also a small problem. It should be better for the four seasons. The staff at the front desk is a little bit perfunctory. When I checked in, I didn‚Äôt take the initiative to inform me of the breakfast time. When I checked out, I didn‚Äôt ask if I was satisfied with the stay. There are no comments, and these should be in the standard process, I hope that the follow-up can be improved.
Overall, I am very satisfied. Four Seasons is not expensive in five-star hotels in Beijing, but the standard is still online, and it is still a recommended choice

A more satisfactory place
Location traffic:
The surrounding traffic is convenient, it is relatively close to Line 10, and it is also very close to Sanlitun
health:
Hygiene can be given four stars. The one less star is because the hotel has been opened for a long time and has not been renovated. Therefore, the facilities are a little outdated. Some facilities are unavoidable, such as the abrasion of the floor. .
Room facilities:
The facilities are relatively complete and the supplies are complete. In addition to cotton swabs and cotton pads, the sink is also equipped with makeup remover wipes from L'Oscitan, which is very intimate. I like the smell of shampoo and shower gel, and the scent of citrus is very fresh. Anti-epidemic suits, masks, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes are also prepared at the bedside. In addition, the bedding is also very comfortable, except for the pillows that are not easy to sleep.
The unsatisfactory place is the hotel‚Äôs breakfast. The variety is not too large and the taste is relatively average, but there are a lot of people, and you have to queue up late.
In terms of service, there were some minor problems in the first night. I found a hotel to solve the problem. The attitude was very good and the problem was solved, but the efficiency was relatively low and it took a long time.

msg:Very good, first-class service, large rooms, although the facilities are not very new, the maintenance is very good, the swimming pool is great, the pool is very comfortable, I have seen the cleanest and meticulous gym pool service. Breakfast is also the best I have ever seen.
There are just some areas that need to be improved:
1. I can‚Äôt figure out how to use the shower head, and I took a cold shower, which is a test of IQ
2. The toilet is ordinary, not smart, at least it should be equipped with a spray gun.
3. The breakfast was registered incorrectly. After checking out, I found out that the hotel did not refund the money in time. I waited a few days before returning it. This is a mistake of the hotel. It is not true if the guest waits a few days before refunding the money, and also discusses the deduction of the meal fee with me. Isn't this nonsense? Moral kidnapping?
I hope that the four seasons will improve, do not forget the original intention, and will come again next time!

msg:The hotel is located in the Yansha Business District and the Embassy District, very close to the Blue Harbor and the Yansha Friendship Shopping Center, and the geographical position is very superior. The hotel is based on the traditional Chinese architectural design style, with its magnificent momentum, carved beams and painted buildings in the lobby, and colorful. The room is a bit of a sense of age. Fortunately, the lighting and bedding are comfortable. Breakfast is served at Opus. The area is not big but the ingredients and dipping sauces are excellent. The meal made this way is very appetizing. May I always keep my smile in my heart and accompany you through every spring, summer, autumn and winter, Four Seasons Hotel is outstanding.

Although the swimming pool is not big, the landscape view is very good. Unlimited drinking 5100 can be seen everywhere, which is very convenient, and everyone can use it as needed. The quality of the people is getting higher and higher!
The breakfast and dinner on the executive floor are also very good! There will be different themed flavors every day. The first day is mainly Chinese food, and the second day is Southeast Asian flavor. The female manager on the executive floor is very generous and decent, cordial and warm, and it really makes you feel at home! Thank you very much for the warm service of the staff!
Come back next time! You can't go out to Beijing to enjoy a leisurely vacation at a Beijing hotel! Ha ha!

The service attitude is very good. very quiet. The hotel has two Michelin restaurants, Italian and Chinese restaurants. This time I only ate at the Chinese restaurant. It was really good, the dishes were unique and the taste was very good. The breakfast room is not big, but I personally think that the variety is enough. Satisfied, would recommend staying.

Every day someone comes back from the taxi to help you drive the door. The staff is also very polite. After learning that my mother is here for her birthday, the hotel decorates the room with petals. When checking in, I gave my mother a bunch of fresh and beautiful flowers, and also specially arranged a high-floor room with a good view. The hardware facilities are also very good, the room is well lit, spotless, the bedding is soft, the sauna is particularly good, the hot pool is perfect, and the water in the swimming pool is not very deep. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, similar to the previous stay at Marriott and Westin. In short, next time I come to Beijing, I will choose Four Seasons!
