The facility at the hotel resort is good, the staff are friendly and hospitable. The landscape are well kept and villa room has high ceiling with stupendous bathroom / shower. Great resort for a luxurious quiet family get away.

msg:The room is big and beautiful.  Even the smallest rooms have private pools.  The hotel brought us a large plate of fruit upon arrival which was nice to us.  The staff were super helpful and courteous.  We checked out of the hotel but our flight was cancelled.  We had to re-check in.  After checking in, I realized that I had accidentally thrown the medicine in the trash.  I talked to Li Tianjiao, the front desk manager, and she told me not to be nervous, she would let the housekeeper find my medicine in the hotel rubbish.  I want to do it myself.  I didn't want to disturb the housekeeper, but the hotel insisted that I rest in the room and let the housekeeper do the dirty work.  Wei Qiongzhen room service found my medicine and returned it to me right away.  I am grateful that this medicine is not an ordinary prescription.  Very expensive.  If this were to happen in the US, there would be no way the hotel would have gone through so much trouble to help me.  I stay here every time I visit.  All the Wanda hotels I stayed in were great!

msg:This is my second time to visit Wanda Vista Resort Hotel in Xishuangbanna. It is also because I like the architectural style of Wanda Hotel and its Chinese hotel brand Wanda Vista. It is a pure tropical rainforest resort hotel. It is not a resort hotel just because it has a resort hotel sign. The villas built in the rainforest and on the hillside are equipped with swimming pool rooms as standard. It is a resort hotel.
There are many types of hotel rooms. I personally think that the courtyard of the garden pool room is larger, more practical and warmer. The rooms are almost all renovated and will not have the old problems before. The terrace room is actually a little smaller. The terrace pool has a borderless view and the photo effect is beautiful. The suite is very luxurious and has the usual style of Wanda Hotel. The furniture in various room types is very complete and almost the same as the one-bedroom and one-living room. The mini bar is very rich. There are six bottles of drinks and two bags of nuts. If you want to use toiletries, Bulgari will also provide small bottles of L'Occitane. In these aspects, Wanda Bar is very generous compared to those stingy foreign companies and hotels.
The hotel has a complete catering service, including lobby bar, buffet restaurant, Chinese and Thai food. The floating afternoon tea is just a photo prop, and the breakfast is very rich. It has almost everything you need, which beats many local foreign companies' hotels.
In terms of service, I personally think that I have never been disappointed because I prefer this mode of service and communication. The front desk manager ALisa is very attentive. I met her when I stayed here last year. This time I stayed for three consecutive days for her sincere and attentive service. Other waiters in the hotel will greet customers when they see them, which makes people feel happy.
The hotel itself is similar to the scenic spot. It has a tropical rainforest style and Bali resort feeling. It also has its own Buddhist temple. The architectural style is full of Southeast Asian style.

We stayed at the popular swimming pool for two nights. The housekeeper Xiaolin added us on WeChat a long time ago and made very thoughtful arrangements. My husband and I also made special arrangements for our wedding anniversary and sent us a cake, which was made with great care! The breakfast was also very rich, with Dai flavor. The soup of the noodles was very good. The hotel also gave us tickets to the flower garden and travel photography. It is worth mentioning that the photography was unexpectedly satisfactory. In short, I felt very good for two days. Thank you Xiaolin for your thoughtful service!

Personally, I am very good at taking photos for work! I even feel that it is more photogenic than all the scenic spots outside Banna. The hotel has a pagoda for worshiping Buddha, and there is a dragon fruit field where guests can pick. The spa is also very good, and the ladies in the spa center are very skilled.
Miss Angela at the front desk helped me apply for a free upgrade to the vice president suite because of the price reduction of the double-story villa booked in the early stage. It was really considerate. She also asked me about various needs every day. Super dedicated!
This experience was great~

The indoor swimming pool is really a must for taking care of children! We are two adults and two children staying in a twin room. We originally booked a garden room, but after communicating with May, the account manager of Mandarin Oriental, she helped us upgrade the room successfully. Thank her very much. She has been helping us coordinate things during our stay. Thank her! We stayed for four nights and had two dinners and four breakfasts at the hotel. The experience was good. Breakfast was better than dinner, hahaha🤣.
The children really love the swimming pool in the house and the shuttle bus. Every staff member is very friendly and kind. Xishuangbanna can really become a paradise for taking care of children in China after Sanya, and we will definitely visit Mandarin Oriental again.
See you next time! Small swimming pool! See you next time, May!

There will be shuttle buses in the park, which is also very convenient. The linens in the room are complete and of good quality, and it is interesting to walk around the public area.
There are peacocks in business at the entrance of the hotel every day. What is more interesting is that the peacocks here are in close contact. If you are brave, you can touch them with your hands, as long as you don’t scare the peacocks.
The service awareness of the service staff in the hotel is also top-notch, especially Yang Wensong, the little brother in charge of picking tea, who introduced many plants and fruits, and it was very happy to talk all the way.

After choosing, I decided on Wanda Vista Hotel
	
The hotel rooms are all small villas with independent swimming pools.
The bedding is quite comfortable for sleeping
The entire hotel space is like a tropical rainforest, even going up the mountain
There are unexpected gains from walking.
It is a tea garden and various tropical fruits. Such as pineapple/jackfruit/mango
This time happens to be my wife's birthday
Special thanks to the hotel for the advance arrangements
The room was decorated and a small cake was given.
Thank you Monica for your help. Finally, I gave you a souvenir when you checked out. It was a stuffed elephant that symbolizes Xishuangbanna.
It’s a really great experience. If my mother asked me if I would come
I must be crying
I want to come again😃😃

There is a shuttle bus to pick up and drop off anywhere in the hotel, which is very convenient.
The housekeeper Monica called one day in advance to follow up on the service during the stay. She answered all questions and was great.
It was the peak period for May Day travel, and the hotel gave Platinum Travel Photography Photos and Videos. Very good. Recommended!

The room is very quiet, the pool is clean, the staff are very enthusiastic, the restaurant is delicious, because I sleep light and I am more picky about pillows, I made a note when booking the room that I needed extra pillows, and they were prepared in advance, and I also called to communicate. Since it is a resort hotel, some details need to be improved:
1. No toiletries, slippers and bathrobes were prepared for the children;
2. The room was not cleaned in time. I hung up the please clean sign, but I went out for most of the day and came back at 5 pm, and they didn't clean. I called twice before they came, maybe because there were too many guests staying during the holiday and they didn't make it in time;
3. The welcome fruit is not of good quality, some are not ripe;
4. The WiFi connection keeps failing;
5. Note that the night bed needs to be made, but it was only made on the first night;
6. It is recommended to waterproof the bottom of the floating afternoon tea. After playing for a while, the lower half of the dessert was wet, and finally it was all inedible.
Overall, it was very pleasant and I will choose to stay next time 😊

msg:The price-performance ratio is good, and there are many activities suitable for bringing children.
Advantages:
1. The price of May Day is relatively short and relatively high in comparison. The four-person suite is also very cost-effective. The two-bedroom suite has an infinity pool, the room is large, the hot water and water pressure are very good, and there are some Bulgari and Dyson products.
2. The park is very large, and the natural environment in the core area of ​​the park is very good. There is also a unique pagoda peacock garden in the park, which is relatively private overall.
3. The hotel has a shuttle bus for room pick-up and drop-off. The drivers are very polite and will not turn on the headlights when encountering cars or pedestrians.
4. The hotel has many facilities and not many people. There are Dai paper and Dai pottery making and tea picking experiences in the hotel. The experience is very good and the staff are enthusiastic and worth it. It is suitable for bringing children.
5. The hotel also provides a pick-up service, and also sends Platinum Travel Photography, which is much better than the travel photography environment outside.
6. On May 1, there was a sudden strong wind. The hotel responded quickly, notified in time not to go out, and quickly cleared the road to eliminate hidden dangers.
7. The room cleaning lady is very professional, and drinking water is replenished in time. She also wears a work recorder, which is reassuring.
8. The new manager in charge of the hotel is very capable and will try his best to improve user perception in a unique way.
9. The hotel's own restaurant tastes good
But the actual physical examination still has many shortcomings:
1. The hotel's hardware facilities are relatively old
1. The old screen window is difficult to drag and feels like it is about to fall off, but it must be closed to prevent mosquitoes. Only the waiter is good at finding tricks.
2. The old doors and windows cannot be closed tightly and are not soundproof at all. I was woken up by the sound of cicadas.
3. The bathrobe is yellow and has not been bleached.
2. Management problems and unprofessional service
1. A waiter did not even know how to lock the room door (but the instructions on the door were very clear)
2. The hotel's promotional activities are inconsistent with the actual operation (some activities may be cancelled due to holidays or force majeure, but they are not updated on the promotional page specially updated for May Day)
3. During the peak period, the concierge encountered a shuttle bus registration order that could not be managed and had to be rushed
4. The communication was extremely inefficient. It was very difficult to book an activity in the hotel and the actual activity reservation situation could not be determined. Different people repeated ineffective communication many times.
5. Different people have different diagnoses for the same thing, and I have encountered such problems many times.
6. The information update is not synchronized in time. When I asked the banquet hall waiter to change the restaurant for breakfast, he did not know it himself.
The most outrageous thing is that there is also a person who claims to be the manager on duty. The waiter also cheated and tricked people. He seemed to be enthusiastic and asked if the room was booked from Ctrip or Qunar. When asked, he said that there were channel-exclusive dining discounts. As a result, after the booking channel was exposed, there was actually no such thing. It was a fraud. He used means to obtain user information located in the lobby. I don’t know what the purpose is. I took the initiative to ask and replied evasively, but there was no follow-up.
Flower Garden Entrance Tour: Free tickets are good
Free small refrigerator (drinks and food) once: Free ice drinks to cool down
Free pick-up from the station or airport once: It’s good to have this service, but it seems that the driver will contact users privately to charter a car. The hotel also provides charter services with open and transparent prices.

There was a curly hair under the pillow... Fortunately, the hotel's handling speed and results were satisfactory, and I was upgraded to a terrace room on the 2nd floor. The hotel's interior environment is very beautiful, and it feels like a vacation. The service staff are very friendly. Whether it is the battery car, the guest room, or the restaurant, they are all very good. I ate Chinese food, Thai food, buffet, and afternoon tea. The Chinese restaurant is the best. The Thai food is a bit slow. The buffet is just average. The floating afternoon tea is more formal than taste. The breakfast is just so-so. I stayed for 6 days, and the breakfast has no changes at all. There are very few varieties. I just had a bowl of beef noodles in the last few days. Some comments said that there is no privacy on the first floor. It is true that the second floor can see the first floor at a glance. And when the second floor swimming pool splashes, the first floor swimming pool will suffer, and it will definitely be splashed. Overall, I am quite satisfied. Thanks to Cathy Xena Apple for her service and help.

It is a blessing for the Xishuangbanna Wanda Vista Hotel to have such dedicated and responsible employees. It is like getting a big baby. When I checked out, they also carefully prepared a small gift for us. Next time I come to Xishuangbanna, I will stay at Wanda Vista Hotel again, because there is the warmth of home here!

msg:I recommend staying in a pool villa. There is a pool in a small yard, which is very suitable for couples or families. The room is very large. There are all kinds of drinks in the small refrigerator, which are free, and the snacks and fruits are also very good. There is afternoon tea when checking in at the front desk. The Laotian coffee is very delicious, and the small cookies are also super delicious. It is a little far from the room to the main building, but there is a shuttle bus. There is a small hill in the hotel that you can climb to the top of the mountain. The view is very good and there is a baby park. The breakfast is varied and delicious. The baker of this hotel is very good, and the various cakes are delicious. We stayed for 3 consecutive nights and got a bar coupon. The front desk staff lady was also very enthusiastic and added WeChat. Many things were arranged by her.

The Southeast Asian characteristics and tropical rainforest of Banna are fully reflected in the Mandarin. We have a pool room on the second floor. It is very quiet, with a great view. The car responds very quickly. Living in the Mandarin is like having a private rainforest. You can pick tea and dragon fruit, and you can swing on the starry sky camp. It is really comfortable to take a walk in the hotel at night in this weather. The swimming pool is very clean, the bath water is very large, and the peacock welcoming guests at the door is very dedicated to work every day. Overall, it is a very good stay experience!

It is the only all-villa hotel in Xishuangbanna, and it is very close to popular attractions. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and dense forests. It is more like a tropical garden that can be lived in than a hotel.
The villa has a private outdoor swimming pool, an independent secret garden like a painting, and a super large viewing terrace.
If you like outdoor sports, there are many recreational facilities and attractions near the hotel. Dai Show Theater, Wild Elephant Valley, and Tropical Rainforest Secret Realm, full of Southeast Asian style.
If you like to stay at the hotel, there are 3 flavorful restaurants, an outdoor swimming pool surrounded by tropical rainforests, and a lush Manxiang Garden... Staying at the hotel can amaze your friends.
The hotel staff is very enthusiastic. If you need anything, you can contact the duty manager Siting. The service attitude is very good and very nice. He is very enthusiastic to help you coordinate and solve various problems during your stay.

Breakfast:
The variety is also rich and the taste is good.
Hygiene:
It is relatively standard. We live in a suite with a swimming pool. Whether it is the bathroom or the swimming pool, the hygiene conditions are quite satisfactory.
Swimming pool:
The swimming pool is not particularly large, and it is enough for a simple dip [spit]
Service:
The response is relatively timely, and the taxi service is also very convenient.
Overall, I am very satisfied, and it deserves the title of the first hotel! I will choose this place next time and recommend it to other friends who come [snicker]

msg:The hotel is so beautiful. They are all single-family villas with good privacy. The greenery is very beautiful and in line with the Mandarin brand. This time I brought my family and children here and they were all very satisfied. The villa is large and well-equipped. The private swimming pool is super awesome. The children had a lot of fun. The scenery is beautiful. It's a pity that the weather was not hot enough, so we didn't enjoy the public swimming pool outside.
The breakfast is OK. The richness is slightly inferior to other five-star hotels, but it is enough for adults. The restaurant environment is also very good. The overall experience is still very good.
The housekeepers xena and abble are very responsible. They kept in touch with us before checking in the day before and answered all questions. Because we were hiking in the rainforest the day before, the elderly went to check in first. The housekeeper arranged for the elderly to check in first. The check-in was very smooth and proper. Thumbs up! There were no problems during the stay. It would be more reassuring to have a housekeeper.
The travel photography provided by the hotel is good. It is inevitable that I spent money again, but the photos are good. I took photos for half an hour and edited them for half an hour. This efficiency is OK👍
The only thing I hope is that the children's playground can be richer, the light can be more sufficient, and it will be more perfect for children to play in more places!

We arrived in the morning before check-in time, but Angela quickly arranged a room for us. And because the signal was not very good that night, she took the initiative to arrange another room for us in advance. She left me a message again. It was really thoughtful. The environment of the hotel also made people feel very happy to stay. It's a pity that I really can't get used to the food here. We ate in the hotel restaurant for two days and there was no disappoin**ent at all. The price-performance ratio is also very high. I recommend sisters to choose this restaurant when they come to Banna. I seldom comment, but the experience is really good. There is also a special shuttle for entering and leaving, so you don't have to walk a long way to the lobby. This is really considerate. It's really hard not to love Angela's service.

The day before checking in, I received a call from the housekeeper and added WeChat. When checking in on the day, he thoughtfully arranged snacks and drinks. The battery shuttle bus was used to pick us up and drop us off at the room. All the staff were very friendly. When I asked for it, the housekeeper arranged it right away, which made me very worry-free and felt very relieved to be taken care of.

On the first night, I found that the lights in the yard could not be turned off. The staff of the engineering depar**ent came to deal with it immediately. They were also worried that it would affect our sleep. The housekeeper Siting arranged and communicated with relevant people through WeChat throughout the whole process, fearing that it would affect my parents' sleep. Thank you very much! During the three-day stay, Siting and ALisa made very proper arrangements for the handover and care, and my parents had a lot of fun. In addition, Yanhanluo from the concierge depar**ent drove the shuttle bus to pick us up several times, taking special care of the elderly and helping me get two large boxes of express delivery. Thank him very much!
This trip to Jize made our family very satisfied!

msg:1. As a Cantonese, during this trip to Xishuangbanna, I have experienced a total of 5 star hotels including Crowne Plaza, Mandarin, Anantara, Intercontinental and Sheraton. Mandarin is the closest to the level abroad. The front desk The check-in procedure was meticulous and considerate. Thanks to May for her assistance during the stay. She was warm and meticulous.
2. The Mandarin Hotel is in Sunac High-tech Zone, next door to the Crowne Plaza. I happened to stay in both hotels. In comparison, if you have enough budget, I highly recommend the Mandarin Hotel, especially their lobby, which is comfortable and grand. The room is also very comfortable. I almost don't want to go out when I stay in the hotel. Breakfast is also very rich.
3. It only takes about 20 minutes to go to Gaozhuang for dinner from Wenhua via Didi. It is very convenient and easy to get a taxi. In comparison, if you stay in a hotel in Gaozhuang at a similar price, the price/performance ratio is not as good as that of Wenhua. Yes, even the famous Pineapple Hotel is just a high-end B&B at most. Everyone should stay awake.
4. It is particularly worth mentioning that I participated in the complimentary travel photography in four hotels. The Earl Travel Photography in Mandarin produced the best films and took the best photos.
5. Details that need to be improved: The hotel should proactively provide racks for drying clothes, add Chinese labels to the shower gel and shampoo in the room, and provide paper maps upon check-in.

msg:Overall experience, highly recommended! I was traveling with my mother and the experience was very good. It is indeed the number one hotel in Xishuangbanna! We upgraded to a duplex room for a better experience!
1️⃣Location: The hotel is in Sunac Resort, from the bottom of the mountain to the top, followed by Pullman, Crown and Wanda. The hotel provides free airport pick-up, commercial vehicles, and direct delivery to the hotel from the airport. We drove ourselves for 4 days, and it only took 15-20 minutes to drive to the city center attractions. Compared with the overcrowded city center, this place is more suitable for vacation, and you can stay in a hotel alone without traveling.
2️⃣Service: The hotel is very welcoming from the check-in front desk to the daily battery car pick-up and drop-off. Although the check-in was a little unpleasant at first, I would like to thank the manager on duty, Martin Gan, for proactively solving the problem, communicating in a timely manner, attaching great importance to the check-in experience, and helping me solve the network cable problem. Thank you for your hard work! This improved experience is thanks to Martin! The hotel has butler service, please remember to add WeChat in time when checking in.
3️⃣Environment: It is very similar to Mandarin Oriental, full of Southeast Asian style. If you are bringing the elderly and children, the hotel feels like enough fun! The scenery is very good and the other two hotels will also come to Wanda to take pictures. Each room has its own swimming pool, so you don't have to go out at all. There were a lot of activities, including seeing dragon fruit picking, etc., but unfortunately we didn’t make it during our stay this time.
4️⃣Restaurant: The breakfast is rich and of high quality, and the hotel’s Thai restaurant tastes very good too!
5️⃣Extra: The hotel has a zoo, peacocks and alpacas, and the peacocks will open their tails regularly.

The first villa I have ever stayed in, and also the first villa with a private swimming pool
Everything is very satisfactory, the water quality of the swimming pool is clear and clean, you must enjoy it
The hotel garden design is very comfortable, the feeling of a tropical rain forest
The public swimming pool in the hotel must not be missed, the pool bottom designed with peacock feathers, coupled with clear and clean water, is very beautiful and comfortable
The happiest day of the three days and two nights in Xishuangbanna this time was still the day in the hotel, very relaxing and without crowding
It's a pity that this time because of the inappropriate time, I didn't make an appoin**ent for travel photography or go to the flower garden, but I didn't regret enjoying the day in the hotel. Swimming in the pool and playing billiards in the indoor gym, this is the rhythm of vacation.
A warm reminder, if you go to Xishuangbanna and the chartered driver recommends you to go to a certain Dai village, although it is free, there may be a sales link, and it is indeed not forced to buy or sell, but you should be mentally prepared and don't consume on impulse.
The breakfast is also average, standard, and there is no highlight. But we didn't go there for breakfast, so we are still very satisfied overall.

It's a bit far from the city, but it's really suitable for relaxing or a family trip with children.

The hotel gave me the Earl Travel Photography, so be careful when taking it!!! You have to pay for makeup, otherwise no accessories are provided. If you don't pay, the photos are also very casual (I don't know if it's a problem with some photographers). I saw that those who paid for makeup took photos with props. The worst experience was the travel photography. I had also received the Earl before in Sanya, and I thought it was very good! I didn't expect to be disappointed here!! They also told me that other places are like this, but I experienced the Earl in Sanya last year. They also wanted me to spend money to buy photos! Buy a package!

msg:I have been a Ctrip Black Diamond user for ten years and usually do not comment on hotels in detail, but I must give Mandarin a full five-star rating! Especially after staying in other Banna head hotels, you can only know the difference through comparison.
The first advantage is that it has convenient transportation but has a sense of independence. It is 20 minutes away from the airport. There are three hotels lined up on a mountain. The external environment is very good.
Advantage two, hardware. The hardware of a hotel determines the ceiling of the hotel. The hardware level of Mandarin is definitely one of the ceilings of all resort hotels in China. The full-pool villa and the grand public area can be seen that it was originally built. It's very expensive. It's been a few years but the maintenance is very careful. There is a dedicated uncle in the swimming pool who monitors the water quality at all times. The hair dryer and bathroom accessories in the room are all from international brands. Compared with the other Anna where we stayed, Shampoo and shower gel are all in large bottles with openable packaging (we were also shocked), and Mandarin is a benchmark in this regard.
Advantage three, service. Frankly speaking, the service is not perfect. For example, the response speed of the shuttle bus during peak periods is a bit slow, and this is also something that can be improved. But the flaws are not hidden. From before check-in, the housekeeper xena started caring mode until leaving, and always responded warmly and timely online. The hotel never cares about whether the child's height requires additional charges for breakfast. The cleaning lady is very helpful in replenishing drinking water, bath towels and bathrobes. The child has fed alpacas and peacocks for two mornings, and there are always fresh carrots prepared for guests. Even the alpacas and peacocks that come out to meet guests are very clean, which makes a great impression on my obsessive-compulsive daughter-in-law!

Highly recommended, Banna ceiling!

We came here for a long distance and did not bring one. It is really not very convenient. Moreover, there are too few types of baby meals. We can learn from Xibei in this aspect, which can really solve the anxiety of parents. The baby's dining issue is the primary issue we always have to consider. In this regard, InterContinental has a special children's package. The overall hotel is very unique, suitable for check-in, and the photos are also very beautiful!

Environment: The environment is nothing to say, it’s great. For those who like the tropics, it’s a dream place.

Service: The service is also very good. There is a special car to pick you up and drop you off at the lobby.
Spa: This is highly recommended. The techniques are very professional and very comfortable. You can call in the room and there will be a special car to take you to the spa area.

Facilities: A fly in the oin**ent. Due to the long time, some facilities are slightly old.
Food: You can still taste the rice noodles in the hotel. The basic taste of other food is online. The breakfast is relatively complete and the time is very long. You can eat before 12 noon, a bonus for those who are lazy in bed!

msg:Summary: The sleeping experience is very good, the swimming pool is swimmable, and other things are remarkable.
Stayed in Banna for one night at Intercontinental and the second night at Wenhua. For Wanda Culture Hotel, what I am most satisfied with is its bedding (booked a double bed room). The mattress is relatively soft, medium-hard and supportive (the Z-International Hotel's is too soft), and the pillows are of a moderate height (I like neither high nor short). Overall, it's very comfortable to sleep on! ! !
The front desk of the swimming pool said that the water will be circulated every day. The water quality seems to be very clean and there is nothing wrong with it, and it is safe to swim.
The overall facilities are confirmed to be as stated online. They are relatively old and the overall hygiene is OK, but there is a lot of dust in the details.

The room is super beautiful, the environment is quiet and elegant, and there is no need to go to the scenic spots to see the crowds. There are pagodas and Zen temples in the hotel, and you can see the scenery everywhere. The top of the mountain can see the entire Jinghong. It has its own dragon fruit orchard. I met the staff on the way after breakfast (later After asking a staff member, I learned that it was Manager Wang of the hotel) who was so considerate. He drove my daughter and I to visit the Dragon Fruit Farm, broke off the sugar cane and brought it back to the room, went to the top of the mountain to take photos, and had a close encounter with the peacocks at the Golden Peacock Garden. I don’t need to leave the hotel anymore, a slow pace is what makes a vacation. I really like this place and the "Tutuo" in the hotel. Bring your parents on vacation next time! (A little suggestion: I hope the room can be equipped with an automatic coffee machine)

msg:The villa we stayed in had a power outage in the middle of the night when we checked in last time. Maybe it was because of the winter vacation. There were so many families with children coming to stay that it was difficult to wait for the bus. The average wait was forty minutes! Very bad experience. The next day, the hotel's duty manager Si Ting came to see us. We reported what happened last night to him and then moved to the InterContinental Hotel. After staying in the Intercontinental for a few days, this time he came back to the Wanda Vista Hotel again because of him. The experience this time was much better than before, but the swimming pool in the villa room where I stayed last time was warm, but this time it was very cold, and the room door card could not be opened. Five points are for Siting. The young man is very enthusiastic. Thank you for taking great care of our family. He is very considerate. Hope to see him again next time I come here

msg:Disadvantages: hygiene is not good enough. As the most luxurious hotel in Banna, it is really a big problem that the most basic hygiene is not done well. You can see that there is a lot of dust under the bedside table, and the most important thing is that there is a condom left there for some reason. I didn't see such a big thing and didn't clean it up. The welcome fruit looked almost rotten, so I didn’t dare to eat it. The oranges placed there for breakfast in the hotel were also rotten when I picked them up... I really don’t know how they checked and put the rotten oranges there for customers.

Advantages: The hotel environment is really good and the gardens are pretty.

Other breakfast, transportation location, and service attitude are quite satisfactory, not particularly good or bad. Although many people say the facilities are very old, to me they are okay and acceptable.

msg:I rarely review hotels, but this time I must say that the manager of this hotel and his service are really disgusting. The hotel price of 5,000+ per night is not worthy of the hotel. After arriving, it was crowded and messy. No one served and I didn't check in yet. When we were asked to wait for water and there was not a glass of water, we asked if we wanted to use the spa. When we asked about extra beds, it was clearly written that no extra beds would be provided. Then we got angry and said that there were only children's beds. Then they said they were not sure whether there were beds available. Finally, Ctrip intervened and agreed. We agreed to add an extra bed when we checked in. Then we were not sure about the check-in time. We waited and waited until we checked in. There was no extra bed. I called and told them that we were not sure. It was really disgusting. Finally, we contacted Ctrip and then we added a small bed. Zhang 1.9*1 560 per night. The facilities are also very old. Except for the enthusiasm of the guy who carried the luggage, the total of more than 6,000 per night is not as good as the 600 per night experience outside. The service industry has reached its end at this level. I am extremely disappointed and does not deserve the seven-diamond award. I don't dare to book a hotel online now that I have four stars. Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip customer service. But this kind of business is also very disappointing. I have hardly given any negative reviews to any hotel. I am really angry this time.

I couldn't walk to the lobby on the cobblestone road with my luggage, so I had to wait for the battery car.
The breakfast is not very delicious, the Chinese restaurant is okay.

It has independent rooms with good privacy and good accommodation conditions. The most refreshing thing is that the green plants and buildings in the area where the Mandarin Hotel is located have a tropical scenery. On a sunny day with white clouds, any photo you take will be a wonderful photo with a strong sense of vacation. Walking around in it will make you relax. This hotel was completed and opened in 2015. The overall maintenance is pretty good. The elements of Theravada Buddhism are also very rich. Even if you just walk around the park, it will feel like visiting a tropical park. , relaxed and happy. Take the hotel's shuttle bus and drive along the rainforest trail until you check into your room. The single-family room is very private, and the layout of the 137-square-meter unit is reasonable. The master bedroom has a ceiling fan, and there is a horizontal swimming pool and sun bed outdoors. The facilities in the house also meet the standards of a five-star hotel. The butler Siting also thoughtfully sent welcome fruits and a specially presented motto cream cake, which was very thoughtful. The weather on the day of check-in was excellent, and there were red dragonflies flying around. Combined with the coconut palm swimming pool, even just sunbathing in the hotel room was a good vacation choice.

Yes, the villa's swimming pool is heated and swimming is very comfortable, but the hotel's large swimming pool is too cold. The only shortcoming is that the cleaning aunt was really thorough.

Environment: Yes! The small garden was beautifully mowed and kept.

Breakfast: You can eat until 11 o'clock. Although there are many people, the management is good, the food is quite satisfactory, and it is worthy of the brand. As for whether it's delicious or not, em...it's like a five-star hotel, with everything, well, that's it!


If we must talk about improvement, I hope that the Chinese restaurant has more dishes. Although the set menu is very affordable, for picky eaters, it will definitely be more comfortable to order a la carte. There are not many dishes on the menu, including Cantonese cuisine, Guizhou cuisine, and local cuisine. It's a pity that they are all mixed together, and they look different. The Thai restaurant is much better.

Overall, this stay was a great experience. Thanks to Alisa and other hotel staff for their warm service. I will definitely come back and highly recommend it to my friends!

I personally tested the Mandarin Resort Hotel. Each room type has its own hot spring swimming pool. The housekeeper Alisa is very nice and responds to almost every request. She also upgraded the horizontal terrace swimming pool room for us...
The hotel's food and beverages are pretty good. At least the Cross Bridge Rice Noodles are the best I've ever tasted. The key is that the price is affordable...
The highlight is here, if you can make a movie, my family, I suggest you rush... [Come on]

The room has tall green plants and a lovely swimming pool. It is spacious, hygienic, and comfortable. I am prone to mosquito bites, so even if I am outdoors in December, I still need to take anti-mosquito measures and close the screens indoors.
The breakfast buffet was good. The dinner buffet only requires guests who missed the stay on Saturdays and Sundays. It is recommended that the peacocks at the door not be tied up for tourists to take pictures all day long. The animal breeding area is a bit messy and needs to be cleaned frequently.

msg:If you like tropical rain forests, you must go to Xishuangbanna;
If you prefer peace and quiet, it is recommended that you stay at Wanda Vista.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, I came to the beautiful Xishuangbanna for the first time. Banna is the southernmost part of Yunnan. The abundant sunshine, rich vegetation and enthusiastic people here make people feel happy and relaxed.

Went to the Zhongke Botanical Garden, Manting Park, Prajna Temple, visited the Starlight Night Market, ate fungus hot pot, took photos of the Dai people, had a Thai massage, drank Laos coffee, and went to the Sunset Restaurant, enjoying Dai flavor Had barbecue...

I spent the last two days of my vacation at Wanda Vista Xishuangbanna, switching from citywalk to resort holiday, so that I could really take a vacation.


🏨Hotel environment:
The hotel is not far from the airport and Gaozhuang, 7-8 kilometers away. As soon as you enter the hotel, you will feel like you are on vacation, with a wide view of the lobby and home-like service. After checking in, you will take a battery car back to the private villa suite.


🌟Highlights:
A good hotel not only has unique hardware facilities, but also has private courtyards, infinity pools, and jacuzzis. But the hotel's rich and colorful software services and entertainment activities will make your vacation more fulfilling.
In the morning, you can go up the mountain to pick tea, walk to a high place to "see the mountains and small mountains", and then drink a cup of Pu'er raw tea picked by yourself;
In the afternoon, you can participate in Bay Leaf Sutra carving, and while learning to write basic Dai script, you can bring back sincere blessings from local craftsmen;
In the evening, you can join the bonfire party, where everyone forms a circle, dance folk dances and dance, and gain the purest joy;
You can also pick dragon fruits, order tea, travel for photos, and do SPA...if you have time.

❤Reason for recommendation:
The three days and two nights in the hotel went very quickly, and it really allowed people to temporarily let go of the hustle and bustle of the city and the worries of work. Here, I would also like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper Vikki and Xiaoquan and Xiaogu from the fitness center, who made me feel even more warm in the already welcoming Banna.

I hope there will be more resort hotels like this in China, so that we can better appreciate the growth and beauty of our motherland’s mountains and rivers, and the diversity and splendor of Chinese culture.

There are two peacocks at the entrance of the hotel, which can be touched. It is the first time to get close to the peacocks. It feels so smooth and fleshy. It is very novel!

After check-in, the butler will add WeChat. I thought that only high-end B&B hotels would have exclusive butlers, but I didn’t expect star-rated hotels to have them too. The name of the commissioner who served me was Duan Yutong. She was a very enthusiastic girl who dealt with problems in a timely and thoughtful manner, and made my stay more comfortable and at ease.

The room type we chose is a villa with a private pool and a small garden. Banna is rich in plants and the air in the mountains is fresh. Thanks to the advantages of the ground environment, the villas and courtyards are very similar to the city and feel like a paradise in the depths. The room facilities are very new and very clean. It is a plus point for me to open a drawer at random and it will be clean. There is floor heating in the bathroom, it is very comfortable to step on bare feet warm

I made an appoin**ent for picking in the pitaya orchard in advance. It was the first time I saw the dragon fruit growing on the "tree", which was a bit cool! A little different 😂 It tastes more hydrated than the usual ones! I thought it was a psychological effect, but the friends who have been there also described it like this...

The hotel has a bonfire party every night, and the social terrorists couldn't help but dance along with them. After all, this is a special event unique to Banna, and the music is pretty cool🤪

The breakfast is not bad, it is my highest evaluation for all hotel buffet breakfasts 🤭 Very rich, Chinese food, Western food, local specialties, there will be some changes every day
-
If you want perfection, you can still pick out minor faults. For example, the swimming pool and beach chairs are relatively simple, and the afternoon tea buffet looks average. But it doesn't matter, I will come to the second brush

msg:Staying in the off-season is very cost-effective. The hotel is very beautiful, with Southeast Asian style, high vegetation coverage, and each room has a swimming pool. The 2-bedroom living room is large and the service is very good. Special praise is given to the housekeeper Duan Yutong and the two ladies who picked dragon fruits. The hotel's dragon fruit picking activity is 100 points. There are very few guests staying. It would be better if the breakfast could be richer! The recommended hotels for traveling in Xishuangbanna are not on the same level as the hotels near Gaozhuang.

msg:Wanda Vista Hotel is indeed the top hotel in Xishuangbanna. The day before we checked in, the housekeeper contacted us and informed us of some precautions. When we arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper came to greet us. She was May, a beautiful girl from the Hani ethnic group. She helped us arrange various hotel activities and accompanied us to them. Pick dragon fruits at the hotel's dragon fruit planting base. As long as she can fulfill some of our requests, she will fulfill them for us one by one, which makes us very happy. The housekeeper May told us about some activities in the hotel and introduced the use of some facilities in the room one by one. We participated in the hotel's bonfire party and tasted the hotel's buffet, which was very rich and full of delicacies. There are two types of dinner in the hotel, one is a luxurious buffet, and the other is the more affordable Cross Bridge Rice Noodles. The price/performance ratio is very high. In short, we made a very right choice by choosing Wanda Vista Hotel.
Welcome fruit on the first day: fresh
Facilities: good
Hygiene: Very hygienic
environment of grace
Service: very good
Welcome fruit on the first day: fresh
Enjoy the minibar once during your stay: lots of drinks

msg:The room is very clean, the service is great, and the staff are very enthusiastic, especially the staff in the fitness depar**ent. The children are very active in participating in the forest treasure hunt. The plants are easy to find. The three and a half year old child found three types by himself, only one: ball orchid. It was difficult. We went there for the biggest prize, but we walked around the garden for more than an hour. The children and adults really tried their best. Finally, when we returned to the front desk of the gym, the little sister and brother were very generous and gave away all the things the children had found. A great gift, especially from Ms. Quan. Seeing that the children work so hard and like to play in the water, they specially gave us swimming rings for children and flamingos for adults to play in the room swimming pool. Other activities in the hotel are also very interesting, including dragon fruit picking, It was a surprise to make Luo Suo and Dai pottery, and both children and adults had a great time❤️

msg:I think the health, environment, facilities and management of Wanda Vista Hotel are absolutely first-class in Xishuangbanna! It would not be an exaggeration to say it is at the ceiling level. Awesome, indeed 👍!
       But if you ask me to say that Wanda Vista Hotel is good, it’s the people:
        First of all, the housekeeper ViKKi, I think, she is a woman, and she is a cultured, knowledgeable and elegant woman in the workplace!
       From the moment we checked into the hotel, although she was no longer with us, she made us feel that her services were everywhere: hotel reservations, room reservations, airport pick-up services, daily questions, taking the trouble to introduce the hotel's services, etc. Wait, wait, let our daily mood be immersed in the beautiful melody.
    Thank you ViKKi! I wish you good luck in your career and reach the next level [smile]!
      Let’s talk about the cleaning lady Aunt Zhou. Well, her name is Zhou Shiqiong.
      She is in her forties, has a simple and kind face, and is quick at work without any sloppiness. Although my figure is a bit rich, my hands and feet are as smooth as the wind when I clean up the inside and outside of the house. I am stable, orderly, and naturally harmonious!
    The most unforgettable thing about Aunt Zhou is that she may not have a high level of education on the surface, but her tone of voice is steady, methodical, orderly and logical when she speaks.
      I wish Aunt Zhou Shiqiong’s family happiness and a happy life!

You can even find papaya, lotus root, and plantain in the hotel
The hotel’s mascots include auspicious animals, unicorns, lotuses, peacocks and elephants.
You can see it everywhere, and you can experience the Dai customs without leaving the hotel.
All villas are hidden among dense forests and trees, with a spacious 137m jumping space. Each villa has a private courtyard and exclusive swimming pool.

msg:This star is given to the lobby manager. I made a temporary decision to go to Xishuangbanna without any guide. I blindly booked the first-ranked hotel. After buying the ticket, I made an appoin**ent to pick up the airport. The front desk replied that it was not available within 24 hours and could not arrange it. Before I finished speaking, I hung up the phone. After arriving at the hotel, I waited. I couldn't check in for more than an hour after three o'clock because there were too many people and the room was not cleaned properly. The only person who gave me a little help was the lobby manager. While waiting in the lobby, he said that afternoon tea would be waived, but it turned out that the deposit was deducted. I know, but I can’t get the room I want. The reservation for afternoon tea is full, and the travel photoshoot is also full. The room is generally clean, and there is a hornet’s nest in the balcony light. If you don’t believe me in room 6210, ask someone to check it immediately. The shuttle bus will have to wait for half a day. It took an hour to get back to the room, and we had to wait in line for breakfast. When we reported all the problems to the service staff, they said that we were also overwhelmed because there were too many people. Why open so many rooms if there is no reception capacity? There is no service at all. It is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the hotel and it is easy to get bitten. After the takeaway is delivered to the hotel, you have to wait half an hour for someone to deliver it to the room. There are many children in the hotel who have poor sound insulation and are noisy. The facilities are old. Highly not recommended, a shame.

The content of negative oxygen ions is definitely the best nutrition for the body; secondly, the hotel has rich activities, such as children's food making experience, dragon fruit picking, and travel photography experience. It makes people feel that staying in the hotel will be very fulfilling and fun. There are also clean, spacious and bright rooms with their own swimming pools. Both adults and children like this place very much. The price is also very reasonable and the price is super high. Finally, the service of the hotel is very good. Well, after understanding our needs, Sally Yang Shuwen and Manager Abble can do their best to help us in every possible way, adding to the already pleasant stay experience! In short, I highly recommend Wanda Vista for accommodation in Xishuangbanna, which is much better than the Anantara Hotel I stayed in later.

msg:I read the hotel's mixed reviews before, and I felt very uneasy. After checking in, I was very satisfied. Our family of four booked a two-bedroom duplex villa. The room was a bit old, but it was very tidy. The corners were clean and there were no mosquitoes as expected. Afterwards, the butler Vikki added WeChat in time. After that, I had to contact her directly for many things. Whether it’s using a car, hotel dining reservations or participating in activities, it’s very convenient to contact the butler. I’m busy during the day. She sent WeChat and she would reply as soon as possible, which is very caring. On the day of check-in, I found that the air conditioner in the room was broken. Vikki immediately contacted the maintenance staff and came to see the worker. She said that she couldn’t fix it that day, and she helped us change rooms and upgrade the room. There are many activities in the hotel, such as travel photography, hand picking, etc. There are many experience items that can be played without leaving the hotel. It is a veritable resort hotel. We had lunch at the hotel on the day we left the hotel. Special thanks to Pinzhen at noon on July 10 The girl serving in the Chinese restaurant told us how long it would take to prepare each dish because we were in a hurry. After placing the order, she came over and told us that one dish would take half an hour and asked if we wanted to change it. We don’t eat spicy food and the child was serious that day. Diarrhea asked her not to put spicy food in the dishes, but the first dish, yellow braised chicken, forgot to avoid spicy food. Halfway through our meal, she brought a plate of non-spicy ones and asked the chef to make a new one. From her service, you can feel the hotel's quality The customer-oriented service concept makes me feel very comfortable. I had breakfast in the cafeteria on the morning of the 10th and met Yao Ming's family. It seems that Wanda Vista Hotel is also the best choice for stars. Our trip to Banna is because the hotel has a lot of points. Thank you to every employee. quality service

msg:As the best hotel in Xishuangbanna, the hotel is great in all aspects. In January and February when the prices of Banna hotels are rising and the prices are outrageous, Wenhua still maintains what the industry should have. The environment of the hotel is quiet and private, and there are two peacocks welcoming you as soon as you enter the gate. I really like the hotel's banana leaves, which are better protected than the forest park. It's a 10-minute drive from the Xingguang Night Market. Ms. Sally Yang Shuwen gave I left a particularly good impression, the most satisfactory hotel in Banna, and I will stay again next time.

The hotel is very big and you can go shopping for half a day. It is suitable for couples, children, and the elderly for leisure and vacation.
The overall green coverage of the hotel is very high. There are peacocks at the entrance of the lobby. There is a shuttle bus from the lobby to the room. On the way back to the hotel, I saw a peacock garden with a lot of peacocks🦚.
The hotel facilities are okay, but the terrace swimming pool feels dirty and not clean.

There were ants all over the cushions for resting by the pool, but there was nothing I could do about it. The earl travel photo given by the hotel is very good. It is suitable for those of us who want to take pictures but are a little socially afraid. There are few people around when taking pictures in our hotel, and the makeup is not so exaggerated. I ordered a suspended afternoon tea, but the taste was mediocre. Why did the cleaning of the swimming pool start after the guests checked in, and the disinfection took an hour. I didn't do the disinfection because I was running out of time. I took a few photos in the water and then came up to take a shower and change clothes. The little animals in the hotel are very cute, the breakfast is average, there are not many choices, and the catering needs to be improved.

The housekeeper, vikki, added me on WeChat the day before check-in. The service was very satisfactory, and he helped us solve the problem in time, and even ordered a honeymoon cake for us.

Facilities: The hotel facilities are perfect, the water in the shower is very hot, not bad! The rooms are all detached courtyards with good privacy.
Sanitation: The sanitation is not bad. The hotel should have been open for a long time and is relatively old. The water quality of the swimming pool in the room also looks relatively clean. The only thing that can be improved is the pavilion in the yard, which is a bit dirty and full of spider webs.
Environment: Needless to say, the hotel environment, resort hotels, green plants, and landscaping are all okay, and the photos look good.
Service: The service is still very good, the shuttle bus picks up and drops off, and the butler solves unexpected problems in a timely manner.
Hotel breakfast is also good, more variety

Free shooting service: Free shooting for Bojue travel photography for staying guests. Someone will call in advance and make an appoin**ent. Free 6 quick-fix photos and 30-second videos. We took more than 80 photos, um, it was very average, so we only chose 6 photos, because the wedding photos of my husband and I were also taken by travel, and the gap is a bit big, so I didn’t add any additional photos, and the extra photos are 80 A quick fix is a bit expensive, and he can also provide makeup, simple makeup 80, fine makeup 300, and a set of clothing for free. I didn’t choose it. We think daily life is fine. The last four photos are from the trip
Overall, a good stay experience

The only fly in the oin**ent is that the water temperature in the swimming pool is too low, but the children are really happy, and they can't wait to change their clothes and go crazy when they arrive! It is recommended to consider raising the water temperature in winter and change it to a hot spring hotel model. After all, although the temperature in Banna is not low in winter, the water temperature in the 20s is not enough to go into the water. If the temperature rises, the whole family can go down to play, and I believe that the cost-effectiveness and attractiveness of staying will be higher. The overall stay experience is very satisfactory, five-point praise! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Why do you say that?
1. Looking at the towels in the guest room, they are dark and old, no different from those in express hotels;
2. The telephone in the bathroom is covered with paint, which looks dirty;
3. Breakfast arrangements, it is understandable that the restaurant can not arrange so many guests, but it is incomprehensible if the management is too poor.
Obviously it is a restaurant that enters according to the head, and the seat is taken away in a blink of an eye when you go to pick up the meal. It takes a long time to queue.

The sudden outbreak of the epidemic interrupted the good plan, but we still chose Wanda Vista Hotel after three years after the full liberalization, because we trust this excellent brand, Facts have proved that our choice is correct.
The hotel is very close to the airport, about ten minutes away. It is located in the Wanda Tourist Resort and is an independent system. The environment is comfortable and quiet, and the whole is covered and surrounded by tropical plants. Every day when you wake up, you will be in a natural oxygen bar. You can also see peacocks and alpacas in the lobby corridor, just like a world in a fairy tale.
The hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable, each with a garden and swimming pool. The interior is hygienic and tidy, and the glasses are spotlessly wiped. It can be seen that the details are in place. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the children like it very much. The hotel's Chinese restaurant is cost-effective, and the food is served quickly and tastes good.
Because there are a lot of people in Xishuangbanna during the Spring Festival, but the hotel's service has not declined due to the large number of guests. Every employee is very patient to solve all problems for each guest. I would like to commend the hotel housekeeper Wang Na (leah), They went out of their way to provide us with meticulous service from the first day, so that our family had a wonderful holiday.
In short, if you come to Xishuangbanna and choose Wanda Vista Hotel, it will definitely make your trip worthwhile. It is the best hotel for family and friends.

I deeply felt the respect and enthusiasm of the local people for tourists. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. The hotel staff (in no particular order) The first vikki is polite, positive and enthusiastic. Because I have a courier, I can’t find it on a map. I can’t find the location. She offered to help me find it and get it back. It is reasonable to say that this is completely out of his scope of work and will delay her personal time during the Spring Festival, but she is still enthusiastic to help me. The touch is deeply in my heart and I hope she can do it in the new year. We welcome good luck and surprises. The second person is Hu Yanhua. He is the staff member with the highest ratings from my mother and grandma. Because we added an extra bed when we checked in, the reason for going to bed on the first night was that my mother didn’t have a good rest. The next day, he found out. Immediately asked someone to change the bed and has been implementing the issue of comfort, which makes people feel very kind and caring. Not only that, he always smiles and receives politely, making people feel like a spring breeze. The third photographer, Xiao Wu, is very patient in helping me My mother took pictures with us and taught my mother how to move. Treating the elderly is very polite and respectful. During the photo shoot, grandma didn’t feel tired at all. All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay and gave the best evaluation. Sincerely thank you vikki, Hu Yanhua and Xiao Wu.

The hotel has a good environment, with its own pagoda and peacock garden, so there is no need to go to the park with outside tourists. The breakfast is amazing, especially the rice noodles are really delicious. There is also a bonfire party at night, with rich programs!

1. The hot water for bathing at night is not hot enough, and the shower can't spray water. I told the waiter the next day, but it still can't spray at night.
2. Breakfast food temperature is not hot enough.

The hotel is still very quiet, needless to say, the environment is really suitable for a relaxing holiday. There are many kinds of breakfast, especially rice noodles. A bowl is served every morning, and breakfast is until 11 o'clock at the latest, which is really friendly for late risers! !
The hotel's floating afternoon tea is currently engaged in activities, but it needs to be booked in advance. There are many types, and it is a bit overwhelming for two people. Hahahahaha.
Oh yes, the hotel also gave away a free photo shoot from Bojue Travel Photography, a free makeup set, and 6 free finishing touches. It is absolutely possible to pay no extra money as long as 6 tickets. But because the photos were pretty good, I couldn't resist asking for a few more.
During the epidemic period, there is no airport pick-up service. But there is also welcome fruit and minibar. It feels like a great family vacation.
Next time you come to Banna, you can organize a group to live! Overall, it is satisfactory!

The dissatisfaction is the breakfast. After staying for three days, the style is exactly the same, the management is chaotic, and the product... four-star level.

The only point, as mentioned in other reviews, is that when the check-out day approaches 12 o'clock, I call and ask if I want to continue my stay, but actually urge you to check out, which is too petty.

Advantages: As a resort hotel, it is quite convenient from the city and the airport. The rooms are all single-family pool villas, the greenery is very good, and the room size is ok. I booked a vertical pool villa and a garden pool villa, because it was inconvenient to check in with children far away, and I directly upgraded the same high-level room type~ The swimming pool water should be kept at a constant temperature, and the children had a great time playing. The staff are also very friendly!
Needs to be improved: In fact, the hotel doesn’t feel old. On the contrary, the sanitation of the ground and the swimming pool area is not very good. In addition, I don’t know if it’s because of the low season and the epidemic situation. The food from the restaurant to the lobby bar is average and the price is not low. Choose Also less.

Stayed for 3 days and the overall feeling is OK.

The environment is of course very good~
With a separate courtyard and swimming pool Very low-key, luxurious and comfortable
The first moment I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised.

Services:
Overall okay~
But no one introduced the facilities/services in the room when checking in
Which ones are charged and which ones are free.
Including whether the drinks in the refrigerator can be taken and so on.
Or post the logo Charge/No Charge.
This piece is slightly lacking.

Facilities:
There was a bed by the pool and the sheets seemed to be a bit moldy.
I don't know if the hotel noticed it.
The nail behind the phone on the side of the toilet may have come loose
I can't hang it anymore, it fell off a few times.
But it was not fixed in time after it was proposed.

Others are generally ok~
Food prices are relatively high.
But the portion size is decent and the taste is good.

msg:Banna Day 3
Hotels around have stayed
Far less than one of Wenhua
Either service or room
and caring
Wenhua can be the first choice near the urban area of Banna
❤️
There will be a butler WeChat when you check in
Mine is Miss Leah
Will intimately tell you the location of the items you need
The nearest nucleic acid location and time
🌟
There are also many bonuses
Give away 6 refined photos of the Earl's Brigade
Videographer Fan Fan is very good at grasping emotions
Much better than a Disney wedding photographer
And the price is half cheaper than Disney 😺
🍃
There are also small peacocks at the door to touch!
The concierge lady said the season of Songkran
Peacocks have more beautiful feathers!
Bye bye Banna ~ See you in Chongqing🌶️

But the most heart-warming thing about this visit to Wenhua is the enthusiastic service of manager Hu Yanhua. After contacting Manager Hu, all requests were answered satisfactorily at the first time. For a five-star hotel, it is this soft power of management and service that attracts customers to stay again.

From the beginning of the check-in, the service has not been said, the battery car is picked up, and the room type has been upgraded. Unfortunately, after the check-in, I found that there are many problems with the hardware facilities, and the air conditioner cannot be used. Adjust the air volume, the power outlet is dead, the microwave oven can only work with the door open (very dangerous) and so on! Fortunately, the hotel staff has a good sense of service and keeps making up for it, otherwise it will really give a bad review!

The environment is super great, immersed in the holiday style, each room type is a private villa ~ the privacy is super, and it is very large, and the parking is done directly to the door! The view of the back garden of the hotel is super beautiful, and any photos are taken #I'm on vacation in Banna hahahaha, everyone must go shopping~
The service is excellent. When we check in at the hotel, we are told that the room type has been automatically upgraded~ (the terrace villa is super beautiful~ the swimming pool is great!) The lady at the front desk, Yuri, not only helped us quickly arrange check-in, but also quickly handled our special extra bed service. We live in In the few days here, she has always answered questions, is super patient, very serious and responsible~ I am really moved by this kind of service! !

The service of the housekeeper May is also very attentive. He will communicate with me about the check-in one day in advance. After arriving at the hotel, he also received me warmly. I was very lucky, and the room with the terrace and the horizontal swimming pool was vacant, so I checked in smoothly. When I encountered some problems during the period, I directly contacted May through WeChat, basically responding to any requests. Overall, it was a very good stay experience. If the hotel could maintain some hardware, it would be even better. The lighting of the terrace, swimming pool and courtyard in my room had been in disrepair and damaged for a long time. Finally, under the coordination of the housekeeper May Helping me install a temporary lighting on the terrace for swimming at night is also satisfactory.

What's the difference between it and the Pullman in Sanya, which sells 1,000 a day? Breakfast buns are simply frozen buns. The problem is that it's cold! Take a bite in the morning, isn't it disgusting? The egg fried rice is also cold, not to mention other things. Who eats it in the morning and eats it cold. I also admire that a hotel with more than 2,000 people can do this in the morning. Needless to say, floating afternoon tea is quite good.

I booked horizontally on the first day of check-in. I found floating objects on the water and a lot of dirt in the water when I went down to the swimming pool. After the guest room reacted, I changed the room. Maybe there are not many suites booked. The bedding has not been replaced for a long time and it is very damp. The point! ! The doorbell rang twice at close to two o'clock in the morning. It was really frightening. The hotel itself is on the mountain, and I didn't sleep all night. The experience for tourists is very bad. After responding to the hotel, it said that there was a problem with the doorbell system, and I was speechless...

Thanks to the butler-like service of Mia at the front desk, who helped me upgrade my room and prepared a birthday cake for me, which really made me have an unforgettable birthday. Wenhua's various small details are in place, but maybe because of some years, many places in the yard are damaged, but it does not affect the effect of my photos. The swimming pool is constant temperature, the water temperature is very comfortable, even if you swim at night, you will not feel cold. All the baths used in the hotel are from L'Occitane. The breakfast is also good, especially the rice noodles are unforgettable. Overall a high score. The only thing I have to complain about is the Earl's Brigade photo sent by the hotel. The photos are average, and the retouching is even more rough, not as good as my own repairing with Meitu Xiuxiu; I was also in a hurry when picking photos. In short, it lowered Wenhua's grade.

After staying for two days, the terrace and swimming pool area must not be sanitized, and I don't know why. I also found a problem. It is very inconvenient to get a taxi in and out of the hotel. The hotel staff will only tell you to call for a taxi. There is no way, hey. Anyway, it is obvious that there is a problem with the reception capacity of the hotel, and the management is very lacking. Personally, if you don't have this ability to maintain the standard, you should not earn several times more than the normal season to ruin your reputation. I will definitely not choose again.

First of all, because the rooms are very far away, you need a battery car to pick up and go in and out. Usually, if you are not in a hurry, it will be a little early and a little later. Even if you have to catch a flight on the day of departure, I specially set a time with the hotel front desk, but I came to the front desk to ask the result more than ten minutes later. Just a few understatements of sorry
Secondly, I ordered afternoon tea in the room. When I left the hotel at dinner time, I specifically called the front desk to ask for turndown service and cleaning. When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that the outside was not cleaned up at all.
When I finally checked in, I asked the front desk if I could check out an hour later because of the flight. The front desk staff actually discussed with me whether I could use a late check-in to exchange for a late check-out when I checked in (faster than 4:00). The estimated waiting time is One hour……
As a five-star hotel and the price of the room is more than 3k per night, the most common small hair dryer is used for the residents. The air volume is small and the power supply is always off. I really don't know what to say...
ps: When I asked the hotel if there was an airport drop-off service, the hotel replied: Because of the epidemic, we do not provide free airport drop-off service. If guests need it, they can pay for it. If you don’t want to provide it for free, just say it.
In addition, those who want to make an appoin**ent for Bojue travel photography do not need to refer to the words on the booking page to make an appoin**ent at least two hours in advance. If you make an appoin**ent on the same day, you will only be told that the appoin**ent is full and cannot make an appoin**ent. But when I want to complain on the grounds that they deceived consumers Immediately told that I could shoot that day, I really don't know what else to say except speechless.

The environment is very good and meets the expectations of a small yard. The swimming pool is shallow and suitable for a dip. The breakfast is also good and can It's suitable for lazy people until 11 o'clock. The TV is a bit old.

They said a long time in advance that they wanted a horizontal swimming pool. If you keep the horizontal, it means that you can still stay ahead of time. It is not a so-called luck. The problem of being able to live in the horizontal may really be a matter of luck and connections! In room 2688, the front and rear door locks are broken, the TV in the toilet is fully furnished, there is no welcome fruit as promised, and there are many mosquitoes! I don't know what advantages can be said, that is, a bed can sleep! The environment is better! Breakfast variety is also very small! Overall, it's not worth the price!

msg:Yunnan Xishuangbanna--Wanda Cultural Resort Hotel (super low cost performance)

Cost-effectiveness: First of all, the price-performance ratio of this hotel is very low. It can be said that it is the lowest hotel that I have stayed in in the past year.
    Generally, tourists must choose two room types, 1888 and 2488. I chose the 2488 terrace swimming pool. After checking in, I found that the room type of the terrace swimming pool can be said to be the upper floor of the 1888 garden swimming pool. The guests of the downstairs room type can see clearly when they do anything in the outdoor pavilion or the swimming pool and go out upstairs. Therefore, even if you must live in this hotel and want to experience it, it is recommended not to choose the room type 1888.

Hygiene: This hotel has been in use for 8 years. It can be regarded as an old hotel and Xishuangbanna itself is very stuffy and there are many bugs. The wall in the room I stayed in by the pool had black marks on half of it, which was very unsightly if you wanted to take pictures. Then be prepared for snails, geckos and spiders in the courtyard, at least we have seen them in our room.
    The sanitation in the room is not as bad as expected, only the sofa is a little dirty, it doesn't matter.

Service: The service of the hotel staff is the most satisfactory part since staying in this hotel, there is nothing to be picky about. From check-in to the hotel, I was very satisfied with the multiple car transfers.

The main reason for staying in this hotel is that the object wants to take pictures, and then there is a 498 serving of afternoon tea in the hotel pool. Taking pictures can be recommended not to eat

To sum up, you can experience at most one night. It is also recommended to choose the room type 2488. It is really unnecessary to stay for a long time.

msg:The standard of the hotel depends on the configuration of hardware and software. The most important thing when traveling is the mood. Good service and attitude are the core of the software. The hardware belongs to Banna. In comparison, I originally stayed for three days, but because of the excellent service and facilities, I temporarily booked an extra day. I am especially grateful to the handsome staff named Hyh, who should be the manager. His service made me feel like traveling these days. The exhaustion is gone, the service in every detail makes us only have a good mood, thank Wanda Wenhua for allowing us to have a good living environment, and thank the staff Hyh for the warm and thoughtful service, let us travel to be fulfilled

The landscape of the hotel is as always integrated with the a**osphere, and the service of the concierge front desk is also very proactive. The two welcoming peacocks at the door make people feel the local a**osphere. Take the sightseeing bus all the way to the room, the scenery is very good, the weather is very comfortable now! The room supplies are all L'Occitane, and the bathroom is quite big and there are flip-flops, which are very considerate~ It is worth mentioning the floating afternoon tea in the hotel. The most important thing to brag about is the sales of steven. Before we checked in, we took the initiative to call and ask our requirements, check the room in advance on the day of our check-in, and remind us of some small tips from Banna back to Hangzhou. It is very considerate for customers. Afternoon tea at the swimming pool, flamingos and frangipani were specially delivered. The ps hotel swimming pool is really good~ Before leaving, there is a very intimate sweet sweet five-star praise for him!

msg:It's really bad. I really want to know how it is managed like this. If I have time, I think I will ask your general manager. Wenhua is also a well-known five-star brand in China, but I really saw it. There is no difference between the service and the speed. It's really too much. 1. I took my luggage out because I needed to change clothes for the items I went out to play. The hotel gave me the check-out card before I went to the front desk to check out. Checked out, which is something I haven't encountered in Express. Second, it is understandable that the facilities are outdated, but it is too much to worry about hygiene. Taking a shower can clog the sewer and flood the entire bathroom. 3. There are seats for breakfast, but people must wait in line. They point to the empty table to confirm the waiter, but they ignore it. The waiter beats me when I go to get the fried egg for breakfast. In addition to the above, there are many, many things that are really dissatisfied and angry. Your hotel can think that it doesn't matter if I have a bad opinion from a customer, then we will see what happens after the fact. At the same time, I will also complain to your headquarters. Ctrip only shows you a reminder to your hotel

🍃Environment: The private swimming pool in the room is relatively small and is only suitable for taking pictures. It is more comfortable to swim or go to the large outdoor swimming pool to bask in the sun
🔔Service: Hotel lobby - room - pagoda all need a waiter to drive a tour bus to pick you up, answer any questions, but not as enthusiastic as foreign waiters, more shy
This hotel is not one of those popular hotels on the Internet. It is more suitable for families, with high security and privacy. Because during the current epidemic, the hotel will deliver breakfast to the room every day. It is not recommended to use the floating breakfast (458 yuan), which is really flashy…
The sunset in the afternoon really reflects the hotel's beauty!

2. No refill of bottled water when cleaning the room
3. Call the concierge and ask the battery car to pick us up for breakfast. After waiting for half an hour, the breakfast was taken. The staff only said feedback to the manager, and did not give a reasonable explanation to the guests.
4. The welcome fruit was included when placing the order, but I didn't see it
5. The air conditioner went on strike in the middle of the night, and the engineer came to fix it the next day.

🍃Environment: Each room is a single-family villa, the environment is beautiful, the room space is also large, but it is a pity that it has been raining during my stay, and I have not been able to eat the floating afternoon tea that I am so fond of

Breakfast served to my young lady—Zhang Juan (asked for her name, hahaha). Thank you very much for your caring service. I can see such a sweet girl who has been smiling and serving in the morning. I feel very happy all day long! After breakfast, I packed orange juice at the door to take away 😄 (Maybe I saw that I like to drink orange juice) Check out the front desk and prepared a small gift for me.
Very happy journey, next time you must watch the weather to experience floating afternoon tea

msg:When you come to Xishuangbanna, you must check Wanda Culture. First of all, the environment of the hotel is like a small park with golden pagodas and a lot of greenery where you can take pictures. The hotel’s infinity pool is also very large. Garden villa, this price is not very cost-effective, it is a little unexpectedly small, the vertical swimming pool is too small, the garden is too cramped, and there is no space, or the horizontal terrace pool villa is better. But I must praise, the hotel service is very good, we have almost never been out of the hotel, if you are hungry, you can order takeaway, the hotel will be responsible for delivery to the villa, all services as long as the phone front desk is available, very convenient. It is highly recommended if you bring your children to the swimming pool and the hotel.

msg:Especially good, compared to Wanda Wenhua in Chengdu where I live on May Day this year, this one in Banna is better!
1⃣️The May Day holiday in Chengdu is 6000+1 nights, only the small hot spring does not have a swimming pool, and every room in Banna has a swimming pool, the garden is more beautiful, the price is 4000+ a night, and the airport and mini are also delivered). We took our 6-year-old child to add an extra bed for the child to sleep well. When we checked in, Manager Chen, the housekeeper, also helped us cancel the extra bed fee, and as soon as we entered the room, there was Laos iced coffee presented by Manager Chen (super delicious! ) There are also various tropical fruits. When checking out, Manager Chen also took the initiative to help us upgrade the two-hour check-out delay. The service really beats Wanda Vista in Chengdu.
2⃣️The hotel’s own garden is super beautiful, with peacocks and a small temple. There is a coconut travel shoot in the hotel which is highly recommended. Before I came this time, I found an online celebrity shop on Xiaohongshu and booked a very expensive photography. As a result, the shop was far away and the clothes were dirty. Taking photos in Mantuo Park is almost a heat stroke! However, I saw that many beauties in the hotel took the makeup on Coconut Travel to look good, and the clothes were much newer and more beautiful than the urban store I was looking for. There was a pair of mother and daughter wearing green and gold suits that were really beautiful to me. ! ! Ask the price actually cheaper! ! ! So I looked for another day to take photos at the Coconut Travel and do some styling and take photos at the hotel. To be honest, I really recommend taking photos during the day at the hotel instead of going to Manting Park. The same is good-looking but much more relaxed, and the environment is much better. In the evening, you can go to the night market to shoot.
3⃣️The hotel’s food is also very good, recommend a Thai restaurant.
The only suggestion is that I hope the hotel's spa will be extended to 12 o'clock, because I brought my children, and every time I sleep the children more than 11 o'clock, the spa can't make reservations.

They also asked me intimately what I would like to have in the room. Arranged a super beautiful horizontal swimming pool. I really love the details. After I arrived at the hotel, I was already hot and sweaty. I found out that I was asked the time in advance to help me turn on the air conditioner. I also prepared fruit and coffee. What's there? As long as the question is sent to wx, the first time reply and the attitude is very good. Needless to say, the hotel environment is natural, beautiful! Zora will arrange for me to pick up the car, eat breakfast, check out, and so on. Anyway, you can talk to her at any time. I am very satisfied with the experience of staying in, and I am also very satisfied with the service of the hotel

msg:First of all, I would like to give special thanks and praise to Linda, the guest service manager, and Zhaozhao at the front desk. Before I moved in, the two people called me separately, inquired about the needs, and helped us solve them one by one. Especially Linda, who has been helping with various problems during the break. He helped order cakes for the child’s birthday and gave him a big doll. It can be said that the service of the two is the biggest plus point of our store.

🔔Service: The hotel has a very good service attitude in all aspects, and can respond very quickly if requested, and the response is extremely fast.
🍃Environment: The swimming pool in the terrace room has a very good vision and is very popular. But I think there are too few places to rest in the public areas of the hotel. The lobby only has a wine bar with chairs, and there is no place to rest while waiting for a car at the door or walking. In addition, there are many problems with the equipment in the room. The lights in the swimming pool pavilion are not available. Workers are asked to repair them at night. The master control button on the left bedside of the bedroom is broken.
🧹Sanitation: Finally, sanitation is also the worst part of this stay. Stayed for three nights in total, and turned down on the first night. The next day we played in the pool in the room. The staff who cleaned the room left after cleaning. I found that I only changed the towels that needed to be changed, and they didn’t put them in the designated place, but all kinds of towels. The bath head and bath salt children's products have not been replaced. The fruit peels that I ate the day before were not collected in the guest room, which caused many flying insects to be recruited. The floor was not cleaned. The floor towels have not been changed for three days and have not been refurbished. The next night we opened Do Not Disturb, so the turndown was not turned on. On the third day, sanitation was better than that on the first day, but there was still no floor towels, no supplements for children’s supplies, and the turndown still did not turn on. The minibar is not filled. Also, the flashlight was out of power on the first night of staying, and the guest room was taken away for exchange, but I didn’t get it back on the third day.
I hope the hotel can become more professional, especially in terms of guest rooms. The hotel is generally worth the experience, but for me personally, I will not choose to stay.

msg:One day before the departure, Wang Zhao, the housekeeper, called me in advance and communicated my needs. There is no waiting on the day of check-in, just get the room card to check in. I lived in Wanda Vista for five days and four nights. If you want to order food, you can contact the butler on WeChat. Wang Zhao helped us to arrange it very well. The other staff of the hotel are also very enthusiastic and attentive. Apart from swimming, the hotel has no other facilities for children. It is not a parent-child hotel. In particular, let’s talk about the pick-up driver who cooperates with the hotel. I packed the car before I arrived in Xishuangbanna. The pick-up driver has a blunt attitude and speaks inspiringly. He said that the car I ordered from elsewhere was cheaper than him, and he didn't believe it to death. The driver who said that I chartered will definitely take us to other attractions for consumption. Whatever I said, the driver said I didn't believe him... a lot of complaining. I won't go into details. Later, our family dared not speak at all. Talking is looking for qi. I believe that everyone does not care about the expensive or cheap one or two hundred. What we want when we go out is to feel comfortable. As far as the hotel pick-up driver is, I don’t want to pay for his car. I hope the hotel manager will pay attention to the quality of the drivers who work with you. My 5-star praise is given to the housekeeper and all hotel staff. This pick-up driver really affects the mood. It was the most rude person I met on my trip to Xishuangbanna.

Let me talk about the reservation process:
This year is the tenth anniversary of my love relationship with my husband, so when I placed the order, the remarks were an anniversary, can you help us to arrange it briefly~ After a while, the customer service of Ctrip called, and it turned out that the hotel wanted to ask what it was. Anniversary, so as to help us set up.

Before moving in:
A dedicated butler called and added WeChat for one-to-one service. The one in charge of me is Jiang Guangxiu, a super cute girl~ She was already waiting to receive us in the lobby before arrival. All problems during the check-in process will be Help us to contact and answer, it is really too intimate and convenient! Wanda’s service is really a perfect choice!
When I entered the room, I found that the bed was set up~ There was a surprise in the evening: the 10th Anniversary Cake! Oh oh really touched!
Regarding the hardware facilities in the park and in the rooms, what you see is what you get-this is the main reason for choosing here.

Finally left:
We were going to the airport so the hotel arranged a free drop-off. From the hotel brother to the drop-off master, we didn't need to move our luggage during the whole journey, and they were all humorous.

In short, this Wanda stay is the most comfortable and happiest during my trip to Banna~ I will choose here next time I come to Banna~

When you arrive at the lobby at night, the hotel staff will never give you a glass of water or smile on your face, nor will they tell you to scan the code to join The booking price of "Wan Yue Club" is much cheaper than that of the platform, and when you enter the room and connect to WiFi, it will let you join as a member, and it is more than 500 less than the platform. If you call the front desk, he will only say that he is embarrassed. Needless to say, the taste of Chinese food, Thai food and Western food. Look at the score. The floor of the western restaurant is always sticky. There are always bugs in the room. There is dust under the head of the bed. The cleaning aunt does not even wipe the table. The hotel does not organize anything during weekends of the week. Activities, really, the whole Wanda’s sanitary environment is worrying, and the service does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. In short, you will feel that it is not worth the money. It is better to go to Sanya and watch the sea. At least the commercial service will be better. In short, Xishuangbanna ➕This Wanda Hotel will not come again for the second time, the pool tiles in the room are broken, the cloth in the pool pavilion is very dirty, and the only master who helps with the luggage has an okay attitude. There is not one of the worst experience! !!! If you are interested in insects, you can come to experience it. After cleaning, the aunt will never close the glass door, just close the screen window for you! Is it because we Chinese people are too kind and talkative, too capable, Xishuangbanna's tourism industry is so profitable, maybe you won’t be afraid to come, if you come out at night, the staff in the lobby are too lazy to say hello, all of them are mobile phones, I really hope Wang Gongzi can go and experience it and help us make complaints! When I checked out, I met a young lady who had booked a suite and also complained about too many bugs. I had to go to the front desk to ask if the afternoon tea was delivered over there. The front desk is still asking, who told you? Feeling sorry for this young lady, spending so much money to match this kind of service? ! Thanks to the people in the Northeast, the people who meet the enthusiasm in the night market are basically Northeast accents. I don't know if it is due to the overall quality. No five-star hotel has such a tea experience. Friends who go there hope you will fight for your own interests! Such a good hotel does not have a good management team, it is really bad

Garden hotel, independent villa rooms, each room has an independent swimming pool, rich breakfast, thoughtful arrangements for pick-up and drop-off, make this trip very enjoyable!
If it is a basic room type, it is recommended to choose an even-numbered room. The water in the swimming pool starts to be changed at 9 am, because the sun is shining and it will be hotter!
The caring housekeeper Wang Zhao communicated before moving in, because he booked two rooms, arranged on the opposite side, so it is easy to move around! During this period, because I went to Banna for the first time, I have been communicating with her about itinerary issues, patient arrangements and reasonable suggestions almost every day, thank you again!
Because the hotel is in the innermost part of the Sunac hotel group, travel basically depends on Didi, and the hotel also has chartered cars, but Didi is more convenient! 30 yuan to the Star Night Market and 25 yuan to Jingting Park! If you go to Yexianggu, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wangtianshu, it is recommended to consider chartering!
I personally think that choosing Wenhua will make your trip to Banna more perfect!

msg:Meets all my expectations of the resort hotel, some exceeded expectations.

We are a family outing, three adults, parents come to celebrate before their pearl marriage, the villa is very Southeast Asia as a whole, I took some photos and friends said it is Sanya.

Advantages, the room is large as a whole, very ceremonial, the swimming pool is very large, the distribution is decent, the hotel environment is also very good, I think the breakfast is beyond my imagination, and I have a lot of 5 star hotels for breakfast.

Disadvantages, the swimming pool is very comfortable because the water temperature is relatively high, but the cleaning of the swimming pool needs to be better. There are some moss and the outside mats can be cleaner.

Overall it is very comfortable, a double experience in Thailand and Sanya for a while. (With a beautiful photo 🙃🤣😜)

My girlfriend and I were taking pictures in the pool. She came over to help us take pictures. After finishing the photo, she sent warm milk and hot ginger tea. I have to say that this is my butler with the best service. The hotel facilities are also very good, and the swimming pool is also great.

msg:I think Wenhua should be regarded as a five-star hotel in Xishuangbanna, with a one-to-one butler. Thank you my butler, Huang Chi, for locking the terrace room of the horizontal swimming pool for me. I also read the comments before saying that the horizontal swimming pool has a better view and the pictures are better. The hotel is also Fruits and coconuts are delivered every day, and takeaways are delivered to the front desk and delivered to the room by a special person. There are many self-raising peacocks. After breakfast, you can play with peacocks. Breakfast is fairly rich. There are ice cream, rice noodles and other regular buffets. The disadvantages are The room was called a battery car and couldn’t get there for half an hour. It’s better to walk by myself. The pool tiles were poorly maintained. I scratched my elbow while swimming. There was a lot of bleeding at the time. My husband called the front desk to send band-aids. The front desk said that a medical team was needed. The team leader came for special trea**ent, and it seemed to take it seriously, but no one came for half an hour. The emergency trea**ent was done by yourself. Press and hold the scratched meat for 20 minutes. Remove the cotton swab head of the hotel and hold the wound tape to seal it. My husband is very dissatisfied with this. He thinks this kind of service response is not up to the five-star standard. The reason why I still scored five stars is that the hardware here is better than Xishuangbanna. Of course, the prices are higher than other hotels and homestays. The second is that the hotel has a good attitude towards reporting problems. In the end, they gave me a new bottle of iodophor and a bag of cotton swabs. The hotel housekeeper Huang Chi also sent greetings from WeChat. This hotel is still worth recommending everyone to experience, but don't expect too much from his battery car, and bring more equipment for handling emergencies, in case you need it, especially when playing in the swimming pool. Finally, let's talk about floating meals. They are really expensive, just for taking pictures. Most of the food inside is super sweet like pudding, which is not suitable for eating.

msg:Stayed in a villa with a swimming pool. Personally think it's very, very good! The feeling points are as follows:
1) Swimming pool: Before entering the water, the staff was asked to activate the swimming pool circulation. The staff also specially cleaned the fallen leaves in the pool, and took the initiative to clean the bottom and side areas of the pool; we also rented a large flamingo swimming equipment , Increase the fun of swimming;
2) Breakfast: Breakfast can be said to reach the standard of a five-star hotel, or even beyond. What is surprising is that there are Spanish ham, original honey, all kinds of freshly squeezed juices and rice noodles with Yunnan characteristics;
3) Peacock: There are two peacocks at the entrance of the hotel, one flower and one white. As the mascot of the hotel. The children will take a group photo! Although it looks good, I don't feel like using peacocks as the door face of the hotel for a long time. Two peacocks are tied to one foot and it feels uncomfortable! In this regard, I hope that the hotel management can change a bit. A good hotel not only has a good view, but also a good feeling!
4) Pagoda: There is a magnificent pagoda inside the hotel, which enshrines the Buddha! It is said that it is the management of the Zongfo Temple, the property is owned by the hotel, and it is very, very necessary to worship.
5) Location: The hotel is in Sunac Park, there are two other hotels, Pullman and Crown, and Mandarin is in the innermost, very quiet and high-end!

In short, this hotel is worth visiting Xishuangbanna a few more times! Will come and live here again!

ps: Remember to borrow a swimming ring, the probability of filming in the yard instantly is much higher.

You can tell her what you need during the whole process. Also very intimate will ask about what time to check in to make proper arrangements. After leaving, I will ask if I need to drop off the plane. Any questions can be consulted very intimate and enthusiastic. Focus on this hotel. The hotel is a resort area. There is a shuttle bus to pick you up to your room. There is also a temple in the hotel where you can rent a Dai costume to take pictures. There are two peacocks at the door and they can also feed. This time, I took the elderly to experience the five-star hotel and their satisfaction is the best result.

On the first day of this check-in, the housekeeper Xiaoshan took the initiative to call me and asked about the check-in time and number of people, what are my preferences, thank you for being very careful, he also made decorations in the room and prepared fresh things for us in the room. The fruits and fresh coconut juice are so delicious. We all think the butler Xiaoshan's service is really good. For this kind of service, we will stay here when we come to Banna in the future. We also made a strong recommendation to friends around us.
The bedding in the hotel room is comfortable, the breakfast is very rich, the hotel’s internal environment is very good, just like in the forest, it is beautiful, so you can make a blockbuster casually

Because I am a temporary order, the pick-up request on the day is not possible, there is no appoin**ent, the hotel manager took into consideration my comprehensive situation, and picked me up after work.
I really scored this point. The hotel is super suitable for vacation, every corner is very comfortable, the shuttle bus will pick up at the door of the villa and send to the lobby.

I didn't think much of it.
After all, I went for afternoon tea.
Just take a grandiose photo
And one person, one family villa with pool
Very private
I don't care how the service is.

And then the reverse scenario comes
Hotel manager Tiki called me in advance.
Said that you can help me arrange the room and so on in advance.
Then I added VX, which is in managed state.
After all, there are a lot of things to do with the baby.
Tiki helped me check in in advance, contact me for floating afternoon tea, and the little yellow duck swimming ring.
She's available for all the stays
This service attitude is nothing, the key family is still a big beauty 😍

Overall 5 stars recommended

msg:作為西雙版納最好排名第一的酒店萬達文華度假酒店，我個人體驗感覺是實至名歸～這個酒店我比較喜歡住萬達旗下的酒店也體驗過和這裏差不多的三亞萬達瑞華度假酒店，來西雙版納就是為了來這度假來的，酒店內到處都是風景建設在熱帶雨林當中建築風格也很有傣味，花園泳池房也很好看，大氣。一個花園院子裏有花草樹木和泳池，露台泳池房就是景觀更寬闊一些進門是一個小花園然後房間後面是露台泳池，房間裝修風格很顯好雖然年頭長了但是也不顯舊，泳池水是循環水外面的亭子裏的墊子每天風吹日曬肯定會臟但是酒店也準備了鋪的單子可以鋪上。歡迎水果準備的很豐富很大一盤作為度假酒店minibar肯定都是免費使用的飲品還比較多，洗護用品是歐舒丹，專門做身體護理的品牌獨立包裝的，並不會像很多外企酒店一樣嘴上説的好聽，環保換成大桶的，洗護用品了其實就是為了節約成本為自己省錢。
服務我個人體驗感是比較周到的，感謝管家Siting這次幫我們解決了很多困難，服務員都很有禮貌，看見客人會主動打招呼問好～

衞生：之前想着熱帶地方的酒店還很害怕有很多蟲 但是酒店房間都是有做消殺的 還是沒怎麼看見蟲 泳池也很乾凈 很出片

環境：整個酒店環境都很好 辦理入住的大廳就有一個無邊水池 可以喝下午茶 酒店泳池房的話也可以點漂浮下午茶 也不貴

服務：服務就得好好誇一下了 首先入住前會有管家加微信問需求 確定航班接機 加我們的管家是may 整個過程很熱情 也安排的井然有序

酒店內部的同事也都很熱情 做事都很麻溜 包括打掃衞生的阿姨服務都很好很熱情

整體來説入住體驗很棒 值得體驗 是假期來西雙版納的不二之選！！

msg:Pros: 
酒店度假感很強，彷彿一秒穿越異域風情/熱帶雨林風情，符合對度假二字的預期。
酒店內的房間、設施相對周全且合理，滿足對五星級酒店的預期。

Cons：
服務是真差，基本等於沒有。幾件遇到的小事供參考：
1，入住時沒有任何指引，包括早餐時間、地點、facility tour，一概沒有。主打一個你自己探尋，不主動宣傳。

2，酒店會有一些活動供客人選擇互動，我們預約了早上10-10：30的“火龍果採摘”，就在酒店的後花園。10點整坐酒店的電瓶車到了指定地點，空無一人。等到10：10，依舊沒有工作人員。無奈作罷。

哦對了，賓客服務給我發了個活動預約的時間表，裏面列了活動的時間和項目，然後問題來了，這個發給我的時間表，和前台提供給我的活動時間表，完全不一樣！神奇吧，這個酒店就是如此，一切都要靠你去猜，一切都是不確定。

3，晚上酒店邊沒有合適的餐廳，點外賣。外賣軟件上備註了房間號，等送到酒店前台時，會有前台禮賓台的工作人員給一個酒店的room tag，再交給電瓶車小哥送到房間門口。晚11點20分接到**外賣小哥致電，説送到了禮賓處，稍後由禮賓處安排送到房間。後12：05仍沒有收到餐，致電前台，發現是禮賓處的酒店員工把他們自己的room tag寫錯房間號，導致無法送達房間。12：15左右收到餐，已經涼透。

4，如果你很趕時間，一定要自己走回房間。前台到房間的接駁車，大部分時間都挺慢的。前台禮賓處，等待的人較多。服務亂到能允許插隊情況出現。剛到酒店工作兩天的禮賓台小夥獨立承接客户接待工作，甚至連餐廳、酒店設施位置都無法準確指引。

5，酒店的幾個餐廳，請大家一定要去看看。貴且產品質量不輸街邊小攤。泰餐、中餐、自助餐品類少到會讓你懷疑是否身處一個老牌五星級酒店，無法接受，當然，餐這個事情仁者見仁、智者見智。

6，酒店大部分工作人員不具備服務意識（不絕對，也有很友善的），路上看到你不會主動打招呼，晚上電瓶車亂竄不會降速，迎着你開過來也不會關閉電瓶車車燈，就是要晃得你無法看清前方的路。

7，針對上述不佳的服務體驗，我們反饋過“賓客服務部”，微信留痕、錄音取證；其工作人員反饋：“會傳遞領導，並讓當日值班的經理回電” 但很遺憾，直到退房離開版納，仍未接到所謂duty manager回電。

哦對，酒店裡的房間，大多有游泳池，但是泳池內有掉磚哦，會有劃破腳趾的可能性。

總之，真實經歷和評價，作為版納數一數二的老牌酒店，服務跟不上砸了自己的招牌、對不起它的品牌溢價，設施老舊、員工培訓和服務意識差等問題，真心希望能看到這篇評價的萬達文華酒店管理層可以重視，如果你們不會用心服務你們的客户，希望你們能把這一課補上。

如果有機會再來版納，絕不選萬達文華。

msg:酒店是萬達賣給融創再賣給現在的貴州稷澤農業 所以是個巨坑 住了3晚 訂了2間房 1間攜程1間官方渠道 下面衹説低於預期和超出預期的部分 1500以上酒店應該有的部分就省略了 否則太長了

-入住當天房間基本住滿 前台人手不夠 導致5個人入住前台衹登記了2個身份證 也沒有做人臉識別和公安登記 邊境城市敢這麼搞也是厲害 感謝業主

-名字用了萬達文華 但拒絕給萬達會員權益 屬於要吸引萬達會員來住 但想要會員權益沒門 感謝中國農村業主一貫的**作風 誠信經營就是*

-酒店沒有恆温泳池 房間泳池和室外泳池都是沒有加熱的 所以來避暑避寒的客人就不用想玩水了 水温衹有不到20度 健身中心邊上室內泳池的位置租給了鉑爵旅拍

-房間內所有用品都很廉價 茶包/瓶裝水/迷你吧/吹風機 在茶葉產地的高端酒店房間里居然沒有茶具 感謝業主

-房間衞生細節很差 水吧桌上的黑色茶葉碎末 十分顯眼 住了三晚 打掃了兩次但一直在那兒沒人管 如圖所示吹風機入風口厚厚一層陳年白灰 吹風時都吹出來了 實在噁心沒法用

-酒店內大部分工作人員都是實習生 沒有任何培訓 一問三不知 入住時加了微信的賓客服務第二天就開始休假了 也沒有其他人代替 前台連酒店名稱來歷和業主名字也不知道 感謝業主

-健身中心對外營業 所以更衣室沒有任何用品 按摩泡池壞了幾個月了 工作人員也不知道 感謝業主

-西餐廳衹有80個位子 酒店150間房間 入住期間基本滿房 300人至少有一半150人是9點半以後來吃早飯 所以三天早餐都要排隊等半小時以上 酒店還有中餐廳和泰餐廳兩間 農村業主自然是節約成本 寧願讓客人慢慢等 也不願意多開一間餐廳做早餐的 

+前台值班經理Alisa能做到基本的服務素養 在溝通後送了1間房的早餐和加床 但其他會員權益 行政禮遇/房間升級/免費洗衣等也是沒有的 辦理入住時系統顯示當天滿房 但後面有取消單 所以是有升級條件的

+房間洗漱備品是大罐的**酒店用的香精版寶格麗 挺適合農村的 但也能提供小瓶裝的歐舒丹

萬達文華酒店裡就有寺廟，還有很多傣族特色的裝飾，也可以在裏面待一整天了，還有拳，有衹綠色有衹白色，可以與他們拍照，可惜沒有遇見它開屏～這個酒店裝修時間有點長了，能有這樣我覺得挺不錯了，都是獨棟別墅
全去房間都需要電瓶車接送，不過不用擔心，來車的時間還挺快的，總之不坑，去西雙版納還是推薦！

msg:踩雷！！
1.酒店環境都挺好的（但是蚊蟲多） 接駁車隨叫隨到挺好的，但是入住當晚1點多的時候我們要多一副牙刷，工作人員第二天早上八點過來按門鈴把我們吵醒説昨晚太晚了就沒送也沒打電話告知！
2.送的旅拍是一個房間6張！不是按人算的，化粧一人100.攝影師大俠拍的還不錯，後面是通過網絡視頻選片，選的照片是快修，感覺選多了，有的都差不多選了1300
3.有的部分工作人員讓人很反感態度惡劣！
我們是11號早上就先退了房，然後去徒步回來才拍酒店送的旅拍，拍完天黑了又累又餓，等車的幾分鐘就去前台休息，休息的時候喝了一小杯咖啡當時咖啡機裏面的咖啡也就剩那麼點了，好心提醒工作人員説咖啡沒了，然後夾了幾塊水果，前台有個女的走過來跟我們説不是等房的客人不能吃，吃的話需要收費！我就問要不要給錢，另外一個男工作人員擺擺手很施捨的態度説：不用不用給你們吃了。規定説出來可以理解，但是這退房就翻臉的態度真的讓人很下頭。表示再也不會去那家酒店了！
出去旅遊都是每天住一個酒店的，像這種服務態度第一次見！況且還是高級酒店！
4.自助早餐個人覺得口味一般

沒所謂一個早餐，衹是以為貴一點可以服務好一點，但真的和洲際等這些酒店沒法比。而且早餐不好吃。

酒店親子友好，一個小型動物園，以孔雀為主，加一個標配的小童遊樂場。雨季天出來玩，天公不作美時衹能去小童樂園愉快玩耍。帶孩子出來，她開心最重要咯，所以下雨又何妨，沒有什麼是一個小童樂園解決不了的。
早晨除了五星標配，還有額外驚喜，煮米幹、春系列、芒果糯米飯，很版納。
管家Siting服務很好，為我們預約了中午的漂浮下午茶，午睡醒來已經放在院子裏了
泡酒店就是我們一家的快落源泉。漫步雨後的文華，整個人極度舒適，一個隱於自然風景，私密幽靜的度假樂土，裏裡外外都是得我心的酒店了。嗯，下次還來。

msg:衞生：蠻乾淨的，屋子裡的香香的。
環境：植被覆蓋率比較高，挺涼快的，私密性比較高，也比較安靜。
服務：酒店的工作人員態度總體上不錯的，非常禮貌親切。
設施：設施其實總體上也挺好，但是第一，孔雀園有根支愣在外面的鐵絲，路過的時候一抬胳膊劃傷了胳膊，我是大人無所謂，如果小孩路過劃到臉或者眼睛怎麼辦，作為星級酒店這點細節都不注意很讓人失望；第二，晚上的時候所有的路燈都很暗，不坐接駁車在外面走路比較驚悚，作為度假酒店，如果人晚上衹能在房間內或者酒店外面活動就很沒意思，這點遠遠不如皇冠假日。

面積非常大，幾日來電瓶車差不多環遊過了，有自己的佛塔，有火龍果園林、人造瀑布、孔雀園，還可以遠眺茶園，以及非常容易包場的絕美泳池，健身房也彷彿置身雨林，各種設備以及體驗，就是具有濃濃的熱帶風情。

入住第二天房間裏也不知道有什麼設備或者設施一直在吱吱聲，直到半夜三點，實在忍無可忍打了前台電話，也未安排人員來查看。甚至在接到投訴電話了，沒有一位工作人員關心或關注過此事。
房費7000塊一晚上，就這服務，就這管理水平，真心覺得不值。

msg:這個評論寫的有些晚了。
很客觀的評價下，未住前被酒店的一句隨處可見吉祥物的介紹吸引了，因為這次出遊帶着孩子所以選擇這家。但是其實就是門口有兩衹迎賓孔雀。孔雀上班時間你可以摸它。有個孔雀園，裏面有羊駝和兔子。和自己想象的有些出入所以多少有點失望。但是酒店的管家服務還是可以的。接機到入住再到離店，酒店的服務還是填補了一開始的一點小小失望。
再説入住店後的設施，由於去的那幾天下雨比較多，泳池旁邊的軟塌床被淋的很臟，所以沒法在上面休息。吹風機還是老式的，有些拉垮這個酒店的標準了。不過貼心的是桌上擺了隨手的防蚊噴劑。可以白天出門時候帶着。
酒店整體環境還是很美的，第二個視頻是酒店的大堂，沒有任何濾鏡，而且酒店到處可以美拍。也可選擇酒店內的旅拍。
我喜歡健身，酒店裡有自己的健身房還有桌球室。早餐的自助也不錯，樣式很多，但是還是喜歡這裏的特色米線。
這個酒店雖叫萬達文化其實也屬於融創和融創伯爵及度假酒店都在一座山上，而萬達在山頂。可能因為這個原因價格也高於融創另外兩家。另外由於地勢原因吧，酒店又沒有高層，都是別墅，所以隱蔽，安靜，環境好，到了晚上還有年輕人喜歡的篝火晚會，後山耶有孩子們喜歡的香蕉樹，和火龍果園。總體而言是個度假休息的好去處。

首先 不知道為什麼我們的房間和圖片不太一樣 房間泳池旁連個涼亭都沒有 衹有一把傘兩把椅子 看着蠻low的 好歹要有個亭吧
其次 因為帶小孩來 看中了酒店的火龍果採摘和榨汁 還有篝火晚會 結果告知都取消… 也就是酒店非常不適合親子 也沒有説酒店有個小動物園 刷了評論才知道 
再者 服務很一般 在版納住的前兩晚民宿的管家服務無微不至 在這裏跟我説他不是管家 衹是客服 
最後房間設施很簡陋 馬桶吹風機用的都很low 後三晚衹能説講究 對比前兩晚民宿的戴森和腸道水療馬桶感覺有落差
但是 酒店送的伯爵旅拍拍的很不錯！

服務：本次入住了度假區內三家酒店，太出我意料，整體的服務感受是鉑爾曼最好，其次是皇冠假日，最後是文華，真是和我預想不一樣，文華服務兩級分化，管家硃紅梅與客房打掃衞生的阿姨很熱情禮貌，管家真心幫客户考慮，儘可能滿足客户需求，主動幫忙安排行程，很敬業且專業！之所以服務給這麼低的分數，最主要兩個環節體驗感太差，第一是辦理入住，我們7月21號早晨帶着長者，孩子是早晨九點左右到的酒店，自己開的車拿了很多行李，到了前台之後，禮賓員、還有一個迎賓的小女孩，沒有一絲笑容，衹是着急讓我們把車開走，我心想我們肯定要先拿下行李吧，不能上前主動幫幫忙嗎？我們到假日與鉑爾曼禮賓小哥很很主動熱情，就你們文華禮賓牛氣，全程冷着臉。到了前台之後一位“高貴”的小姐姐紋絲不動的坐在那裡，沒有笑容，沒有起身，你的屁股是粘在座位上了？那個座位就那麼舒服，我理解你們可以坐在那裡平等的與客户交流，但是起身示意一下歡迎還是可以的吧，本人去過10幾個國家，超五星酒店也住了不少，知道有些酒店是坐在那裡與客户溝通的，但前提是客户也坐在那裡，否則都是起身交流，而且起碼有個禮貌的起身歡迎的動作，文華的前台，就是這麼高級的坐在那裡，全程交流問什麼，就衹回答什麼，還是沒有笑容，更加感受不到熱情，告訴我們沒房，要等，我們提出希望兩個房間近一些，因為有長者和小孩，走動起來方便，她就告訴沒有，想早的化衹有兩間離的很遠，其他要慢慢等。其實我非常能理解，但是你應該多提供一些訊息，讓我們考慮和選擇一下吧，結果人家不願多説一句話，一點不想滿足客户需求，也不為客户考慮，衹想盡快辦完，我們也接受，因為出來旅行，都是為了開心，但是接受不代表我滿意。     最後多虧我們的管家真不錯，主動幫我們考慮，給我們提出瞭解決方案來選擇，這還要多謝管家，但是前台整個入住的體驗感不如三星酒店。而且我發現禮賓安排擺渡小車那裡，衹要是站在那裡接待客户的都很差，尤其還有個黑黑的，帶了個眼鏡的小夥子，説話的方式與感覺，簡直就是街頭小混混，太差。但是開禮賓車的司機，都不錯，禮貌且熱情。       綜上，我認為禮賓與前台接待是酒店的一張臉面，這張臉面如果臟了，不可能給別人留下一個好印象，所以衹能兩星了。假日服務我給四星，鉑爾曼我反而給五星

衞生：打掃衞生的阿姨很熱情，工作認真

msg:Really very satisfied, the hotel environment is first-class, all detached villas are very quiet. The facilities in the room are also very new, and the service attitude is also very good. Once you check in, there will be a butler to accompany you, and you will be very attentive to any problems! My housekeeper, Duan Yutong Scarlett, solved the problem very quickly and answered all questions [Happy] [Happy] The travel photos sent by the hotel are also very good, and the level is very good. There are even pagodas in the hotel, so you don't have to go to the crowded attractions outside. Special thanks to Alisa, our elderly in the lobby accidentally lost the child's bag, which contained the child's ipad, which contained a lot of precious information. Contacted the hotel that day to help us check the monitoring, and communicated with us until 10 pm, but unfortunately there was no result. The next day we all gave up checking out and went to Pu'er. We received a call from Alisa in Pu'er who said they found it for us. I really appreciate her seriousness and responsibility for making our trip to Banna flawless. This time I chose Wenhua because of the recommendation of my college classmates. If there are friends who come to Banna in the future, I will also recommend Wenhua.

錢 我花了， 但是真心不再推薦。管理很差勁！

服務方面：真心沒話説，打電話預約的客服，耐心細緻，司機師傅也提前到達機場，管家Agnes全程周到服務，會推薦酒店的免費體驗活動並幫忙預約，還會提醒各種注意事項，真是個貼心小管家啦^_^
負責客房打掃的工作人員雖然沒見過，但是房間每天都會收拾得特別乾淨，mini bar和各種洗護用品補充也很及時，每天還會貼心送上牛奶和鮮花餅，房間裏的香點起來感覺還挺舒服的
酒店前台，大堂，及電瓶車接送人員也都滿分好評，我們每天在外面晚，回來都挺晚的，但是每次都還是會有專業人員負責接待。
我覺得酒店還有一點很棒的是各種體驗活動和小動物，還有乾淨乾淨乾淨，房間自帶的泳池是活水可以放心遊，杯子什麼的也擦得很亮，孔雀和小鳥很可愛！

msg:號稱版納的酒店天花板，住了4天，感覺酒店最大的亮點是熱帶雨林植被+熱水泳池，在冬天可以遊熱水泳，每天早上呼吸到新鮮的空氣，看到有顏色的花花草草，是一件幸福的事！
早餐午餐味道中規中矩，不過每天晚上送鮮花餅和熱牛奶也是一大特色。
客房打掃衞生及時乾淨。管家服務貼心，回覆及時。
酒店是別墅酒店，在硬件方面，前台和餐廳設計的大氣、豪華，不過房間的户型設計上有點小氣了，房間最起碼有個隔斷把客廳和卧室分開，另外庭院空間分成了3部分，每部分都也不大。
洗漱用品歐舒丹，毛巾浴巾可以升級一下，可以再厚一點有質感一些；浴袍可以換個薄一點夏天的浴袍，既節省成本又實用；泳池旁邊的墊子都發黴了，可以考慮更新了。
酒店距離告莊、機場大概半小時車程，旁邊有個萬達，送的熱帶花卉園門票也不錯，可以溜達溜達。如果你喜歡安靜，可以考慮這裏。

當天下午3點到的。辦理的入住。可是當時沒有房間。小朋友不巧正好在發燒，和前台小姐姐Dreamy溝通了之後，小姐姐幫忙免費升級了房間，才讓我們順利入住。非常感謝！
整個酒店都是獨立房間，出門就需要電動車短駁，叫車非常方便，短駁車很快就到了。
唯一遺憾的是，酒店晚上的自助餐，衹有周五和週六才開放，不是每天都有的。
除此之外，酒店真的就非常棒啦，推薦推薦！

我們是自駕，下機場後直奔酒店，一到酒店門口，門口的迎賓小哥哥小姐姐就讓我們感受到了來自雲南當地的熱情~~

到酒店休息後，酒店贈送的鉑爵跟拍服務，馬上就給媽媽安排起來~ 當地特色的傣族服裝可以隨心搭配，在此真的感謝給我麻麻化粧的化粧老師鄭慧小姐姐，在服裝搭配，首飾推薦，粧型以及髮型設計，都讓我媽媽非常滿意！媽媽一直在説，粧效特別自然，上鏡頭也特別好看！！


真的也非常非常感謝攝影老師鄭楚俠小哥哥！！攝影老師在拍攝的時候，一直非常耐心指導我媽媽動作以及表情（因為我媽媽拍照表情有點小僵硬），拍攝的時候也非常用心的準備了好多小道具，真的拍出來的效果，比起我們在外面其他家拍的，真的好了太多！！！很有大片的感覺！~

最後選片的時候，因為我們行程很趕，但鉑爵跟拍也非常貼心配合我們時間，給我們網上選片~ 在此真的非常謝謝我的選片老師鍾遠芳小姐姐！！儘管我的要求很多，但真的真的很耐心為我解答以及給我幫助！選片的時候也非常耐心的給我很多專業的建議，真的必須是超五星超棒的體驗！！~

酒店晚上也有安排民族歌舞以及篝火晚會，傣族舞蹈和傣族小姐姐一起蹦傣迪！媽媽這次玩的特別開心，她開心，我們做兒女的也高興！！要是來西雙版納的朋友們，真的可以試試！！~~

其次發生了一件很不愉快的事情，當時租了酒店的獨角獸。早上十點多送到房間，正常租賃時間是24h，但一點多回到房間的時候。有看到工作人員在打撈我的獨角獸。我詢問了，給出答案是過時間了。我和他們核實了租賃時間，他們也表達了是工作失誤。我下午沒在酒店，去了景區 晚上去了江邊夜市。回到酒店已經接近12點，我的獨角獸又不見了！這個時候我給前台致電，他們説明天一大早就給我解決這個問題。我早上等到退房時間也沒有給我致電。退房時我反應了這個問題，一個從內屋走出來的經理給我的處理結果：“不用和你核實了，我們內部核實。租金我這邊不收你的，你滿意這個處理結果嗎”我當時內心：對於我來説住宿💰我都花了，我在意的是你這個獨角獸這租賃的三瓜兩棗？？我在意的是我沒有拍到我和獨角獸的泳池照片。（這個説話方式真的很不喜歡，租金不要強調了好幾遍，她的處理方式讓我覺得真的是住客差的是這麼點租金嗎，有佔這個便宜的必要？解決方式就是 我不要你錢了，出了房間沒有泳池，你把獨角獸送給我再給我200也沒有任何意義了。愛拍照的女孩子們肯定懂我的矯情）

我真的是服了，五星酒店的服務人員，大半夜來按門鈴，聞所未聞！
住了三晚，我沒有一晚是睡得安穩的。第一晚被蚊子咬，第二晚半夜1:39分收到管家的訊息騷擾。第三晚，凌晨2點多還被噪音吵得睡不着。
所以，真心不推薦來這家入住。我住過國內三家文華，這家是最差的！

國內最差五星酒店，真的不是浪得虛名。萬達和融創出品，一踩一個坑。

msg:很舒服的度假酒店，非常適合家庭度假。我們春節住了5晚，酒店本身就能玩一天，早晨全家一起到酒店的寺廟聽了半小時佛課，讓身心整個放鬆、沉靜下來；然後可以享用一頓豐盛的早餐，品類很豐富；上午可以用房間贈送的券約拍鉑爵旅拍（6張免費照片和一段視頻）；下午可以在健身房或者泳池揮灑一下汗水，春節期間我下午3:30下水，水温25-26度，肯定不到28。酒店不遠的曼回索村是傣族美食聖地，很多家不錯的傣餐，還可以提前訂孔雀宴，停車比告莊方便多了。酒店設施配不上酒店的自然環境，但是服務一流，從入住到退房客户經理Alisa給提供的細緻周到的服務，幫我存放除夕的煙花、幫我寄行李、接快遞，絕對超過泰式服務。下次來版納還會再來。

早餐尚可。中餐廳菜品挺多，很多雲南特色菜和其他菜系很不錯，比柏悦什麼的中餐廳選擇多，還有家泰餐。
另外設施方面，樓台泳池上來竟然踩到生銹的大釘子，簡直誇張，幸好沒扎破不然得去打破傷風了。

1.酒店早餐餐廳，服務人員態度差，而且盤子上都是水垢，手一抹都可以擦掉，而且盤子上都破碎了還拿出來用。
2.早餐到10:30結束，10:10工作人員已經把餐收走了，我要一杯檸檬水，這個推那個，最後就是沒人踩你了。而且菜和水果被人拿光了，也不會補菜！
3.早餐的班子麻煩調整下，從接待到清潔，基本都處於癱瘓狀態，等吃早餐我等了將近2，30分鐘，沒有接待能力就不要接那麼多客。
4.車子接非常非常非常慢！真的是差評！
5.定的泳池房，根本無人來清潔打掃游泳池！

這個酒店服務態度和質量真的不敢恭維，也不推薦給別人！

msg:整個酒店給人一種半死不活的感覺，去別墅的路被挖開沒人管，墊塊板子，電瓶車開過去咣噹一聲，真的很煞風景。從泳池看下面房間，屋頂有厚厚一層掉落的樹枝、樹葉應該幾年沒清理了。房間裏發現了死蟑螂，真的掃興，就住一晚也懶得跟前台説了。泳池很淺，1.2米，也就小孩子能玩玩。早餐跟隔壁鉑爾曼差遠了，種類不多味道也差。服務基本是沒有的，傳説中的管家根本不存在，就連電瓶車司機都不太夠，出去玩回來在停車場等了近20分鐘才等來電瓶車。酒店的山頂有帳篷，似乎可以組織活動，但也是沒有的。總之，性價比真的真的太低了，同等價位三亞的泳池別墅好太多了。西雙版納可能就這一家，也沒得選了。
