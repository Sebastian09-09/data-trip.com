msg:Room smelled bad. Carpet in room was dirty. Carpet in hallway was old and mouldy. Some parts were torn. Room is very old fashioned. No USB connections in the room. They have one USB charging hub but it didn’t work well and was only on one side of the bed. Light on bathroom were flickering all night when trying to dim. No coffee machine in room, only instant coffee and kettle. Really should be 2 star hotel. Not modern, run down and old fashioned design. DO NOT give your email at reception as Hyatt group will bombard you with spam. Won’t stay again overpriced and not at all 5 star. This hotel should be downgraded to 2 star.  Building works at 8am next door on Saturday that stopped at lunchtime. Only good thing was the breakfast buffet.

msg:During my 3-night stay at the Grand Hyatt, I found the hotel a bit difficult to navigate, especially when moving between floors. The front desk is located on the 33rd floor, while the breakfast restaurant is on the 32nd floor. This layout may not be very convenient for seniors, as there is a long staircase leading down from the 32nd floor to the breakfast area, although there is also an elevator available. Accessing the main floor requires taking another elevator from the 3rd floor. Even after 3 nights at the Grand Hyatt, I still found myself getting lost at times while moving from one elevator to another.

When traveling with someone, the bathroom setup can be inconvenient. The shower and bathtub are in one room and it's transparent. The sink is also in the same area, which means that when someone is showering, another person can't use the sink.

I would like to express my gratitude to Francis Chen, the team leader of the guest department. The day before I checked out, I was expecting a parcel to be delivered to the front desk. Unfortunately, due to some communication issues, the parcel was returned to the shipping company. Francis was incredibly helpful in coordinating the delivery of the parcel to my next hotel in Guangzhou. I truly appreciate his exceptional service and willingness to go above and beyond to assist me. I also learned during our communication that his English proficiency is quite impressive, especially considering that he only started learning the language five years ago. Thank you, Francis, for your outstanding assistance – you're truly an angel!

When they served the food it was completely cold and they forgot to serve me the wine after I waited for half an hour.  During next morning breakfast buffet, they ran out of orange juice but refused to squeeze more because they said out of quota.  Just cannot believe this kind of service under the “Grand Hyatt” brand.  I have complained to the hotel.

msg:Grand hotel, located in a tower. With lots of marble. 
You need to go to 33rd floor to check in. Unfortunately, this is where it start getting complicated. Staff at front desk speak very limited English. 
Several staff around the hotel, found a clever and simple way to overcome their lack of English ( when the supervisor is not looking ) they simply use a translating app on their phone .
Entered the room, which had a very strong moldy smell, so we boosted the air cond and eventually that went away, until we reduced the fan speed and the smell came back.
Cafe breakfast was excellent with many varieties and great food . The only issue being the coffee. There is several coffee machines in the restaurant, depending  which one is used, coffee can either be excellent or mediocre . In addition sometimes you get sugar and teaspoon supplied , sometimes you don’t. 
On the positive side, one of staff spotted that it was my wife’s birthday and she was delighted to  receive a delicious strawberry cake. Unfortunately despite 2 people being registered in the room, only 1 plate and 1 set of cutlery came with the cake , so we had to improvise…
Special mention for the pool lifeguard Jarrett.  He greeted us with a large smile and anticipates your needs for a hair cap or towel.
Finally , upon check out, since nobody inquired if we enjoyed our stay, I asked for a guest satisfaction survey to be sent to me. I double checked they had the correct email and  was surprised to find it had been replaced by  an unknown QQ number instead ,  I am left wondering  if this is a genuine mistake or is it something else….. for info the survey never arrived, so I guess it ended up going to the QQ address after all. 
Overall we found the hotel facilities to be impressive, but service sadly lacking attention to details.

One little bottle of soap in the shower may not be enough for two people. The hotel entrance was tough to find. Go up to 33rd floor for the reception (if you find the right elevator). A big welcome sign on the ground floor may help. The staff is compared to the Hyatt Centric in Hong Kong unfortunately not so focussed and welcoming. it was nice but not perfect! Hyatt - you can do better!

This time I came here because I was holding a wedding banquet nearby. Grand Hyatt is the nearest hotel, so I booked a suite at Grand Hyatt. The room is large (larger than the suites in other hotels I stayed in before), very clean, the food in the lounge is delicious, and coffee and juice are always available. Good reviews! The day before check-in, Miss Lian Ruobing added me on WeChat, asked about some habits and precautions, and told me that I could find her if I had anything. Sure enough, I looked for her eight hundred times for various things during my stay. I have a Grand Hyatt dining stored-value card, and the coupons in it want to be used for guest room laundry. Grand Hyatt has never encountered this situation before. Miss Ruobing has been helping to communicate and confirm the rules of use. Finally, I successfully exchanged it. I am very happy.

The service attitude is warm and thoughtful, and the rooms are newly renovated, so it is more comfortable to live in. The 1881 roast duck restaurant downstairs tastes very good, and you can also do manicures on the third floor 💅Whatever you wish for, you can get it

From service to food quality, I have met my expectations. This time, a very special room was arranged in the executive lounge. It's on the same floor as the lounge, so it's very convenient to get in and out. Because the weather was very bad and it rained frequently, I stayed in the hotel to use its services. The only thing I can't fault is that the takeout counter is in the open air, so it's a bit inconvenient. ￼

I booked a room with a view, but all I could see was the rooftop of Impression City and the construction site next door. The signs about the hotel in the underground parking lot are unclear, and there is no one to guide them. The hotel's dedicated parking spaces are occupied by shopping mall guests, causing hotel guests to turn around many times to find the hotel entrance, or have to park far away. The elevator cannot go directly from the housing floor to the garage, or cannot go directly from the first floor to the room floor. As a result, you have to go up and down the elevator to go back and forth to the first floor, lobby, restaurant, garage, etc., which is very inconvenient. The service and management are a little behind, and it seems that I can’t live up to the Grand Hyatt brand😲

The picture below shows a "view" room priced around 1,500 a night, which is the highest floor of this type of room. It doesn't matter if you explain it in advance, but the view of the "view" room is like this. It would be a bit of a shop to cheat customers, right?

msg:This time I stayed for two nights in the Grand Hyatt View King Room. It is said that the hotel has been in existence for more than ten years, but the facilities are still quite well maintained. If nothing else, it feels relatively new. The room is not only large, but the design is also very unique. The independent bathtub and shower area can be completely separated from the room through a Chinese-style sliding door. It is flexible and practical. The lighting control settings in the room are reasonably positioned, unlike some new hotels that are fancy, complicated and impractical. This demonstrates the solid foundation of a first-class brand. The catering is also excellent. The breakfast can be said to be at the upper level among mainstream five-star hotels. The variety is rich, the quality is good and it is very distinctive. As for restaurants, I tried two restaurants. The dishes at Black Diamond Chairman Building on the 37th floor are good, but the price is a bit expensive. The roast duck 1881 on the first floor is even more amazing. Several Beijing dishes may seem ordinary but are very skillful, such as black garlic Kung Pao chicken, The old Beijing noodles with soy sauce must be praised. As for the service, it should be said that it is very good. It reflects the service level that is in line with its grade. The enthusiasm is not excessive and makes people feel comfortable. Overall, the Grand Hyatt is one of the upper-class comprehensive hotels I have stayed at recently. It will probably be my first choice if I come back in the future.

After cooling down, it is really surprising that there is no air conditioning and heating in the guest rooms and public areas of the hotel! Because the bathroom is in the middle of the room, some rooms have a musty smell! The breakfast is not bad, the categories are relatively complete, but the quality is really average! And there is no heat and air conditioning, so it’s really cold to eat! ! It might also be because of the cold. The chubby brother who cooked porridge on the first day looked a little ugly and looked very reluctant! The towels were a little dirty and the supplies were in large bottles! These two points are deducted! The room service aunt is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to ask about your needs, which will add one point back.

Thanks to my old friend Penny for arranging the reservation and extension, so I got two things during the trip. It was a good day to rest up. Although she was on vacation, she kept asking if she needed anything until I left the store. This feels so good! The room attendant, Sister Meng, was very kind and serious in her work. She took good care of us. As a bit of a germaphobe, I admired her very much! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! In addition, the rich and high-quality breakfast in this hotel is the reason why I am willing to give up morning tea outside. Thumbs up to Fruit Brother! Cass yogurt is great! I just asked the guy who cooked the seafood porridge to stop shaking his hands. I asked for fish fillets and shredded vegetables, but there was only one piece of fish at the bottom of the bowl...😭 Anyway, I look forward to seeing you again.

msg:After booking the National Day itinerary, I started searching for hotels online and compared many places. I chose the Shenzhen Grand Hyatt Hotel, which is characterized by delicious food. I was afraid that it would be difficult to make a reservation during the National Day, so I booked it early. Although it was more expensive than usual, considering that it was a holiday , settling down for accommodation early also gives me peace of mind. After staying for two days, I felt that the environment, service, facilities, and breakfast were all very good! Connected to Vientiane City, there is no shortage of places to eat, visit and take photos around. Although there is no view in the view room, the design and facilities inside make it feel like home, with wet and dry separation, smart toilet, bathtub and shower, independent luggage room, two-layer curtains that can be opened and closed automatically, and slippers that are comfortable to wear... 32nd floor The breakfast is very rich, with many varieties, good taste, and considerate service. It is divided into several areas. Food and drink, hot and cold, Chinese and Western styles are all available. There are still some that I haven't eaten in two days. I really like it! In the evening, you can walk to Vientiane City from the first floor, where you can go for a walk, check in and take photos, walk your dog, or go shopping, all of which are good choices! Warm and thoughtful service!
The hotel also has several features:
1. The Vientiane City parking lot is directly used for parking. You can park at will. When you go out, you need to go to the service desk on the first floor to report your room number and license plate number. The location in front of the hotel is not very big, so cars can come and go as they please and cannot stop for a long time.
2. Accommodation is not on the first floor. After entering from the hotel gate, you need to take the high-speed elevator to the 33rd floor. After completing the formalities, transfer to another elevator and swipe your card to the accommodation floor. When going out, go to the 33rd floor first, then transfer to the high-speed elevator to the 1st floor. Haha, it’s a bit roundabout!
Although the holiday price was lower than when I made the reservation, and I felt like I suffered a bit of a loss, the satisfaction I gained after two days made up for my slight injustice. A pleasant stay!

Just downstairs is Luohu Vientiane City, where you can find everything you need for leisure, entertainment and shopping. The lobby is on the 33rd floor, the view is very good, and HONGKONG is on the other side. There are many elevators in the hotel and they are fast. I chose the Grand King Room. Since I arrived early, the previous customers checked out not long ago, so I had to wait for a while. Because I had to wait, housekeeper Kitty Huang immediately arranged to change me to a suite and apologized. My luggage was also delivered to the room. The service was very nice. The suite is large, warmly decorated, clean and tidy, and the toiletries are very nice. The Grand Club room can enjoy free afternoon tea until 8:30 pm in the executive lounge on the 25th floor, free meals, free coffee drinks and wine (you can drink red wine, champagne, and whiskey as you like. I drank red wine, and the imported original bottle of red wine is of very good quality). The environment is also very quiet. Check out was pretty quick too.

However, the takeaway cabinet is placed in a small corner outside the mall on the first floor and you have to take the elevator to go outside to pick it up. It is somewhat unseemly. The worst experience of the day. It's this takeaway counter. I had to transfer to the elevator, but they didn't deliver it. I had to go outside the mall to pick it up. I'm speechless. The Huawei TV in the guest room can only watch satellite TV and cannot cast the screen. I don’t understand it. Maybe it’s because I have an iPhone but I don’t understand it anyway. At night, the iPad ran out of power. I called the housekeeping depar**ent and used the charging cable sent by the housekeeping depar**ent to charge 20% overnight. I specifically explained that the iPad was out of power. The staff should have a basic understanding of this. Because I was pressed for time, I only had breakfast the next day. The hotel's catering depar**ent did a very good job. The breakfast buffet was overall satisfactory. The service staff also proactively informed the online group purchase and helped with the operation. The Chinese food part was a bit confusing, almost. There are no decent dishes. Although it is called breakfast, there must be something. After all, we are not Chinese. The sausages and bacon in the English breakfast were cold and tasted terrible. Other breads, desserts, fruit cold cuts, egg rolls, etc. are quite good, and combined with the hotel's environment, it's worth the price of 158. The heated infinity pool is a bit small, but I was the first to go, so no one else had a good experience. The overall experience is not too impressive. It is worthy of the price of about 1,000. I have stayed at Grand Hyatt many times and I am familiar with it. I have a good impression of the brand. This hotel in Shenzhen is not outstanding but it is up to standard. , I hope I can do better next time I go there

I wore slippers for breakfast, but the front desk refused to let me in, so I had to go back to the room to change.
Then during the meal, I discovered that a foreign friend was wearing flip-flops and no one told him to change his shoes.

Good guy, there are still two faces.

The toilet is also a must-have smart toilet now, and the curtains are very good at blocking out light. This helps a lot with sleep! The panoramic view of the small cityscape with mountains is also stunning!
The most important thing is that you can not only go downstairs to visit Vientiane City, but also there are so many delicious restaurants! From roadside tea restaurant Xinfa to Lao Ganbei Bingsheng Jiangnan chef...
The hotel was fully booked that night and we were not upgraded. After leaving the hotel, Claire took the initiative to contact us to learn about our stay experience, which was very warm.

msg:Service: Mainly in terms of service, this is the Grand Hyatt with the worst reception capacity. When I arrived at the front desk before 4pm, the queue at the front desk was chaotic, with both straight and snake-shaped queues. There are no staff to maintain order and instructions.
There were seven or eight guests in the room in front of me. I was in line with the three guests in front. I waited for 35 minutes and couldn't think of anything! When I went to the front desk, I just asked for it to be fast. I had no special request. It took me 9 minutes to get two rooms (I specifically timed it to show him how slow he was). When I arrived, I couldn't get the room. I had to wait until 5:30. Just got a room. It's 4:30 in the afternoon and I can't get a room. Later, the general manager on duty came to deal with it. In the rooms arranged on two floors, the leader's public relations ability was still online. But disorderly order means leadership and management fail in their duties.
Breakfast the next day cost more than 200 per person. It was simply a carbohydrate feast. There were not many dishes to choose from. Isn’t this the price?
There was an extra chair for five people, but the waitress kept saying that all the available seats were reserved, etc. I asked the manager to handle it, and she immediately asked a male colleague to bring a chair.

Chaos reflects a kind of chaos in Shenzhen. Speed, is this the much-talked-about speed of Shenzhen? ? ?

Environment: Too old.

The bed in the room is very small, which is the second most outrageous thing. There are live bugs crawling on the sheets and quilts on the bed. Sanitation The environment can be said to be terrible, and the exterior view can be said to be absent. The scenery outside the window is completely inconsistent with my expectations for this hotel. Then, the hotel does not allow takeaways to go upstairs to the concierge depar**ent, and there is no delivery service ""I went downstairs to get takeaways and asked the service staff for takeaways Where is the locker and pointed me to the wrong route, so I searched downstairs for half an hour and couldn't find the take-out cabinet. I was very annoyed" "" Finally, when I checked out, I called on time at 12 o'clock and asked if I wanted to continue my stay. In the case of the room, there were still people who kept ringing the doorbell to harass and directly entered our room without our consent, which seriously violated my privacy. Is this the service that a hotel of this class should have? Such a check-in experience, not to mention the same price, is not even as good as most 100-yuan hotels. It can only be said to be extremely poor. I will definitely not stay in this hotel again in my lifetime. I hope that you will not step on the pit when booking a hotel and think carefully.

As soon as I entered the hotel, I will have luggage to help pull my luggage. The front desk service attitude is very good. The front desk younger sister Claire helped me check in. The room was upgraded for free. I also presented welcome fruits. The 2nd floor is also very rich, there are many varieties, very fresh, and the attitude of the service staff is very good. On the whole, the check -in experience is very good. I also look forward to the next Shenzhen journey.

(I went to register because my wife couldn’t show her ID. I kept saying that my wife couldn’t check in. Many mainlanders only have a phone number with them. Even if I showed my ID card to register, the front desk clerk repeatedly cut me off, which was very troublesome). After I entered the room, my bathrobe was actually stained. The hygiene of a five-star hotel is so poor and it is so conspicuous. For guests to use, your hotel can’t even use it if it’s not cleaned up. When I went swimming in the hotel pool at night, there was Xiaoqiang’s body floating in the water. What a ghost in a five-star hotel.

1: Even if the air conditioner in the room is turned on to 16 degrees and the wind is at its maximum, there is still only weak air conditioning and it is not freezing at all.

2: It should be due to bites on the bed. There are marks all over the body all day and night, and there are thin red spots on the body that are similar to the bites.

3: The sound insulation is worse than a hotel with 1/3 price. I often hear the sound of cars outside in the street and the loud sound of chairs being moved upstairs in the middle of the night.

4: From 10 to 11 o'clock at night, there were frequent and loud sounds similar to grinding and rolling outside, but there was no construction on the site outside, and there were no large cars nearby.

excellent
1: The breakfast buffet food is good

2: The TV size is large enough.

3: When I went to the front desk to raise the sound problem, the front desk quickly called the room to follow up. Although the outdoor grinding sound did not reappear when the call was made, at least there was a call to follow up.

There is a musty smell in the room and corridors, and there is also a strong smell of oil smoke in the lobby. The breakfast is very good. There are many varieties, including Chinese, Western and Hong Kong styles. The taste is very good. It is much better than the breakfast in Jirui. However, it also has ventilation problems. Before I even get to the breakfast area, the whole floor smells very strong and strong oil smoke, which makes me feel uncomfortable. It makes people want to vomit, which is not something that a good five-star hotel would have. The toothbrushes and toiletries are also very poor, and the details are not well done, which affects the overall stay.

Celebrate your birthday today at the 1881 restaurant of the Grand Hyatt Shenzhen,
I ordered the famous roast duck, the roast duck here is full of a**osphere, only one sauce per person, and one sauce for everyone outside, the roast duck has a firewood aroma, which is something I can't eat in Hong Kong , the steamed fish is also cooked just right, the chive box, this must be mentioned that the taste is completely different from the leeks in Hong Kong. The 1881 leek box is fragrant and most of the Hong Kong flavor is strong. The birthday cake shows the extraordinary craftsmanship of the pastry chef
Because it is so delicious, I immediately applied for their Yueshan card and got a lot of discounts,
and cash coupons, because I will definitely come here to taste delicious food in the future

Sitting in the most prosperous area of Luohu, but during the Chinese New Year period when hotels in Shenzhen are generally expensive, his price is very conscientious, and the room area is larger than most hotels of the same price and level. There is no charge for extra beds for children under 12 years old. The bed is soft and comfortable, and the toilet and shower are very easy to use. Unlike the Dameisha Kingkey Intercontinental, the water is hot and cold! Not only the hotel has several Chinese and Western restaurants, but also all kinds of food in MixC are within easy reach.

However, the room I arranged this time is a bit flawed, the spotlights are a bit flickering, the water in the shower is also hot and cold, and there are bedside tables. The socket was also broken, and the experience was not as good as the previous few times. After communicating with the customer service, I immediately changed to a suite, and I immediately felt that it was worth it. If you come to Shenzhen in the future, Grand Hyatt is still the first choice. The 1881 restaurant downstairs has good products, worth a try!

We were asked to sit aside and wait. After about half an hour, no one paid attention to us. We had to go to the service desk to ask again and were told that we would have to wait. There was no ward check to confirm. It felt like we had forgotten?

From the check-in to the check-out the next day, I can’t feel the service of a five-star hotel. It can be said that there is no service at all. On the night of check-in, I went to the cafeteria and saw a worker in a suit. Staff, sit on the baby chair (inside the reception desk), because there is no fence around the reception desk, so the guests can see all the activities of the reception desk, sitting on a stool is better than sitting on a baby chair, right? At the same time, I heard the chefs in the Ming stall say some uncivilized words. These actions are really unrefined when there are guests, and it is still during the business hours. Secondly, I went to the lobby bar at night and wanted to take some photos. It happened that the staff was off work, ignored us, and rushed to get off work. The speed of room delivery is still okay, not slow, at the average level. The cleanliness of the room is good. There is no dust on the desktop, no hair in the toilet drain, and the dead corners are cleaned very well. There is also a turndown service at night, which is a good point.

When leaving the parking lot, you had to tell the security the room number and you could let it go. I found a hotel by myself. Although it was resolved within ten minutes, it affected my mood.

1. I want a baby cot at the front desk, and they also took the baby's bath and Johnson's baby shower gel and body lotion.
2. All service staff are kind and natural to chat with guests, enthusiastic but not excessive, making people feel warm and stress-free.
3. The swimming pool is equipped with a swimsuit dryer. Throw the swimsuit in, hold the lid for a while, and the swimsuit will be dried. Most five-star hotels don't have this, so I must give it a thumbs up.
4. There are paper towels and trash cans in the elevator room, which are thoughtful.
5. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides of the room, and the outside scenery is good.
6. It was found that the same as the Grand Hyatt in Shenyang, it is the 33rd floor of the elevator and then the elevator to enter the room, which has good privacy. And the decoration style is very similar. Would you be curious about this kind of building structure, will the fire pass?
7. The breakfast is commendable! The distinctive Cantonese dim sum stalls, the chicken feet are better than those in the tea restaurant outside, and the fruits are also very careful. There are both crisp persimmons from Shandong and ginseng fruit from Yunnan. The carrots used for juicing are micro Sweet, you can see that the hotel is very careful in selecting products!
8. The dim sum and meals in the executive lounge are very delicious, garlic white meat, sauced beef, fried fish...

9. The location is prosperous, there are both Hong Kong-style Xinfa tea restaurant downstairs, and the fishing boat seafood restaurant No. 79 with high cost performance

But the dishes ordered in the room were really average, not up to the standards of a five-star hotel, and it was awful. The meal in the 1881 restaurant downstairs is OK.

But in the future, Grand Hyatt Hotel will not be booked through Ctrip, because Ctrip’s reservation of Grand Hyatt Hotel is more expensive than the original price of the hotel itself, and if the hotel is booked through the official website, you can still get a 5% discount and points. So next time you book a Grand Hyatt hotel. Will use Ctrip again, very unfriendly.

Although no luggage was delivered to the room, the bed was turned down, cleaned in place, everything was neatly arranged, and the quilt folded meticulously.
Today, when the Regent and MO accessories are on the wall, two sets (turn down one set) of BALMAIN every day, at least sincerely.
The most commendable is the breakfast, which has many varieties and excellent taste. Especially the stir-fried dishes are delicious. The usual must-eat single-sided eggs and yogurt oa**eal do not want to eat at all.
The gym is not big, but the yoga area, equipment area, and strength are clearly distinguished, and there are even more equipment.
The Jiabin Xuan serves tea and snacks throughout the day and light meals in the evening. The taste is not bad. The dining at Hyatt hotels is really guaranteed.
The overall service is good, I can’t say that it’s warm and considerate, but above the standard, I think it’s a good price.
The room is not big, but not too small. The room is relatively old overall, decorated in general, and there is no sense of a**osphere. But the flaws are not concealed.

Adjacent to the Vientiane City Shopping Center, it is very convenient for eating and shopping. What I bought on Ctrip was the preferential group purchase price of the hotel. The front desk staff was kind when checking in (from check-in to check-out, the hotel practitioners encountered were very good) very intimately upgraded the room type to more than 60 square meters Grand Club Deluxe King Room. The space is very large. Although the hotel has a certain age, as a veteran haytt hotel, many details of the Grand Hyatt are still well maintained. The toilets are equipped with washlet equipment, the shower room and bathtub are very smooth and the water flow is sufficient. During my stay, I enjoyed the executive courtesy. The breakfast and the executive floor dinner are generally good. The Cantonese dim sum is very good, but there is a dim sum labeled "Shanghai Xiaolongbao" in the evening meal on the executive floor of the Regency Club. As an authentic Shanghainese, this dim sum is definitely not "Shanghai Xiaolongbao" 😂, the skin is hard The dough tastes stiff. If there is such a store in Shanghai, it is estimated that it will be closed. I hope that the hotel can be improved. Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will consider staying in it.

The breakfast time reported the room number and entered the restaurant, but the waiter questioned whether it included breakfast and eating in front of everyone. After explaining, the waiter still didn’t believe it, and went to the so-called verification and then told other guests in public that it was verified that my room was not available. At breakfast, they took out Ctrip's records to check with them in anger, and they admitted that they had made a mistake. I was really very angry. I left the restaurant immediately without eating breakfast, and suffered from liver pain all day. This veteran five-star inexplicable sense of superiority, arrogance and prejudice is really speechless, even extremely inexplicable, and the experience is extremely poor.

一：酒店位置好，到處是都是商場，購物特別方便，從奢侈品大牌到物美價廉的生活用品。

二：同類酒店中相比，性價比很高。

三：酒店的服務工作做的非常好。

四：雙人床一米二窄了些，大部分酒店都是一米三或一米四寬，深圳萊佛士酒店的床還一米五寬。

msg:不值967元。欲預訂的朋友三思再三思：
1.標榜五星酒店，ckeck in 在33樓，已算奇葩。
2.電梯分“客房電梯”、“餐廳電梯”、“轉乘電梯”，前台員工閉口不提、電梯處無文字捉醒，不把人折騰死，也會整個半死不活。
3. 客房不提供牙膏、牙刷、浴帽等洗漱用品，要致電主動索取，當你臨睡前發覺再致電，至少等半個鍾，不把你急死，也把你氣死。
4.洗澡花曬有2個：一個在頭頂，一個是手持。無文字提醒，一不小心，你不想洗頭，也把你搞成落湯雞。
5．住宿要按金1000元，我猜可能防你把電視機偷走，酒店忘了現在是實名制、講信用的年代。我當天早上9:30退房，要第二天按金才能到賬。如遇到外國遊客沒微信、付款寶，沒有足夠人民幣在身，能否成功入住都是問題。
6. 酒店所處位置偏僻，交通不便，食肆全無。
兄弟姐妹們，三恩呀！

雖然是高端酒店，但是房間裝修和設施偏老，不過還沒有到老化的程度；
洗完頭用吹風機時直接漏電，被狠狠點了一下；
過了段時間發現所有插座都充不上電，應該是吹風機漏電時跳閘了。
電梯設計也有點煩人，上下樓需要各種轉電梯。。。
這次要的是大床景觀房，雖然不怪酒店，不過這一側窗外着實沒風景。

msg:U1S1，酒店位置、設施都很優秀。但是催退房令人很不愉快。我訂單清清楚楚寫的2點退房，不到1點來打電話催，我解釋了我訂單是2點退房，對方説這要看酒店入住率。？？？所以酒店住的人多了就可以隨時把已經住進來的客人早早攆走嗎？攜程的訂單白紙黑字都是瞎寫的？下單的時候怎麼不提入住率？辦入住的時候怎麼也不提？早幹什麼去了？這是店大欺客嗎？花錢住店還要莫名其妙被找茬也是服了！

另外酒店個早餐好掂好多嘢食，如果BOOK酒店建議BOOK埋個早餐。我地食早餐前走左去游左個快水，個日天空好好，雖然只係兩日一夜，但好有渡假 FEEL。（唯一不慣是要我地帶泳帽！泳帽咁平！建議GH 做D印有 LOGO的每次游完水送給客人便算，感覺衛生一點 ）

房間很舒適，衞生條件很好，電動窗簾很好用，枕頭很舒服

游泳池在房間看起來不錯，本來打算去試下，行程太趕就作罷了

早餐種類很多，但是偏西式，中式選擇不是很多，對我這個中國胃不是很合適，喜歡西式早餐的朋友會很喜歡。

*酒店位置：很好，在萬象城mall上面，購物休閑用餐…非常方便。
*前台：服務態度很好，辦理手續較快捷。工作人員Claire 在我入住前兩天給打來電話，詢問我的入住需求，並幫我選擇了一個滿意的房間，並贈送了歡迎水果，非常貼心。
*房間：略有一些南方潮濕的味道，這點可以理解。但沒有點評中説的下水道的味道。
*客房：房間衞生做的很到位，工作人員有禮貌。
這次共住了五晚，總體感覺很好！比較喜歡這家酒店。另外，在退房時前台的Claire加了微信，便於溝通&會再次入住，並會推薦給朋友們~

自助餐算是少量多元化(北方的煎餅果子到南方的腸粉粥鋪麵食都有....)

msg:今年第二次入住，整體還是不錯的，但希望某些地方酒店能加強人員管理和培訓，提高服務質量，反饋如下
- 前台：前台服務非常好，中英文應答專業得體
- 客房：入住時客房的整潔度未達理想狀態（狀態類似長住幾天時，每天房間衹作大致整理的感覺），入住後和客房部溝通，英文應對水準不理想；但是晚上回房間時房間狀態已經重新整理，值得肯定和鼓勵
- 餐廳：早餐餐廳服務整體體驗不好，如下：
1. 餐廳各同事之間的溝通存在明顯短板：我們到餐廳時，餐廳前台讓我們稍等其他同事帶位；來到帶位的同事明顯不知道哪位客人先到，或者正在等待被服務，以致比我們後到的客人卻比我們先被帶到座位上；我們跟着進去後，該帶位的同事也不知道應該在哪裡安置我們，再跟其他同事確認後，需要我們站在一張剛用完餐的桌子旁，等清潔同事整理完畢後才能坐下。
2. 雖然在餐廳工作的員工數量不在少數，但是感覺缺乏互相協調工作，比如 a） 經常有很多桌子並沒有及時整理出來，導致現場感官很不乾淨；b） 入座後，餐廳同事沒有主動詢問我們是否需要茶或者咖啡或者其他飲品； c） 我們桌上的鹽瓶沒鹽了，負責的同事花了大概5分鐘才重新拿了一瓶；d） 餐廳同事工作時對於周圍客人的注意力不夠，太過於專注自己的事情，沒有時刻留意周圍是否有客人有任何需求，經常我們需要等一段時間才抓到一位同事的注意，溝通我們的需求。
3. 感覺餐廳對於整體有多少入住客人就餐的預案不足（是否和其他部門的溝通不足？）：有比較晚才到餐廳的客人（接近10點），需要在門口排隊一段時間，才有空位。

對服務不是很滿意，主要是兩點：
1. 送洗了兩條內褲和三雙襪子，收費373.12元，即使對於五星級酒店這也貴的有些離譜了；
2. 房間整理過晚，我結束午餐下午1.00PM回到房間想要短暫午休的時候，房間還沒有收拾好，影響了安排。
總體打3分吧，不是很推薦。

結果，入住當天才知道，因為疫情影響，游泳池健身房等都沒有開。疫情原因，理解，可是酒店完全可以提前溝通和告知下，客人是否接受沒有泳池。我家距離酒店才不到兩百米，如果不是為了帶孩子游泳，我訂這的酒店是為啥？
預訂套餐因為含午餐，我們不知情入住當天先消費了，導致後來即使得知泳池不開，酒店訂單也無法取消了。真是住了個寂寞。
另外吃飯的時候，餐廳和酒店前台溝通不暢無法讓午餐訂單掛房賬，提供攜程訂單號也不行，衹好一個勁催我儘早入住，催了我幾遍。這不應該君悦內部去溝通解決嗎？
結果入住時候又得知泳池不開，真是火大，孩子也很失望。前台一副無法解決的態度，讓人很惱火。
服務業，多換位思考下，才會吸引更多回頭客。
君悦做的最好的，還是餐飲，親子實在不行

2.接待大堂有蟑螂經過，只能當作看不到，畢竟是花著五星級的房價來住。

但是呢，以前沒發現問題，這一次入住發現兩個大問題。第一，床上用品的質量和舒適度非常糟糕。第二，沖涼房的淋浴開關如圖片，沒有任何告示，搞得我沖個澡被從天而降的涼水嚇了兩次。而且浴室的防滑墊太小，地面防滑效果一般，潛在危險很大。望改進。
還有，堂堂君悦，那些什麼sp券就別拿出來送了。不如送早餐。起碼，也要有一份星級酒店基本標配的歡迎水果送給客人。

購物餐飲娛樂一應俱全 也適合週末staycation
酒店已經有些年份了 所以裝修風格當然比上新的設計類或者網紅風的酒店 更偏向於中式商務風格
但是u1s1 衞生整潔度等做得還是很不錯的 
讓人比較放心 基本需求都能滿足
但是建議客房裡的一些個性化服務可以增加一下
或者指引可以更明確一些 比如下午想點下午茶或者晚上想點宵夜 也沒找到房間裏有相關的指引
需要直接打前台電話諮詢 順帶一提 君悦的自助餐很好吃 就在32樓酒店前台樓下 不過住店用餐也是沒有優惠的 需要的話可以自行在大眾上看
另外房間也很安靜 睡的很好
總體來説 在羅湖中心地段這個價格和服務 性價比很高了 （住後回訪服務感受很好👍🏻

3、深圳降温，希望加條被子，連續2天打電話給前台都説沒有
