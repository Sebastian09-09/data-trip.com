msg:First of all, the hotel is far away from the county town, more than 20 kilometers, and it takes 50-80km by taxi. Is the location convenient? For example, is it close to the city center? There are quite a lot of restaurants in the hotel, with all kinds of flavors available, including Pizza Hut, Starbucks, KFC, and Wolfgang Steakhouse. . .
Facilities and comfort: The hotel room is too old, the bedding is mediocre (the room rate is 1,500 per night without ski passes), and the bathroom does not have a bathtub. The room facilities are not very clean and tidy. Other facilities such as gym, swimming pool and conference room are decent.
Service quality: First of all, thank you to the front desk for helping me upgrade my room type for free! Sorry, the concierge can't arrange a business car for one day, and the hotel's fleet is useless. There is no car and no one is free. Room service is pretty responsive, 5 points. There was a banquet hall employee who forgot his name. He saw me pushing a luggage trolley to transport ski equipment to the room, and took the initiative to help, making up for the shortcomings of other staff.
Breakfast and catering: The breakfast is very rich, but it is so unbelievably delicious! ! ! Strange, doesn’t the hotel general manager have breakfast at the Blue Lagoon restaurant? If you, the management, see this review, please sort out the raw material suppliers chosen by your executive chef. A puff pastry croissant that can be made just once baked can be so unpalatable, I’m really impressed.

It would be even better if the cable car ticket given was not honored and must be used on the day. There are two of us, one and one, and one ticket is voided.
The hotel's breakfast is very rich and varied, highly recommended!
Playing UTV all-terrain vehicles, 400 people are the same price, a little expensive, but it is still very cool to drive.
Occasionally there are singers performing, most of them feel like square dancing. It would be better if you can invite some folk bands! The whole is remarkable!
The location is not far from Taiwu Town, 6-7 minutes by car. The hotel has its own free parking lot, and it is very convenient to go directly to the lobby.

Environment: The mountain scenery is beautiful, but it’s a pity that it’s only a little bit

Facilities: There are 2 bathrooms in the room, which is super redundant for family travelers! The WIFI in the room was so bad that it was not easy to use at all. It was still off-season when we went there, so not many people would use it. They always used their own network! The signage was not clear. The double bed room we booked was not available, but we were given a twin room instead! There are activities every day in the square below the mountain view, and the loudspeakers are very noisy, so don’t even think about sleeping at noon!
The breakfast is okay, there are many kinds, and there is nothing the same every day!

msg:Accompanying the children to football training, Taiwu stayed here without breakfast in the hotel.
This is a five-star hotel. The room is quite big. There is even an induction cooker, a range hood and a sink. You can make some simple meals here. There are two bathrooms, which is very convenient. Facing the mountain, if the snow season comes, the location is really good, and it is not bad now. You can see the blue sky, white clouds and green mountains when you open the door and have a balcony. There are also cable cars and entertainment downstairs.
The food is also very good, definitely a five-star standard. Now it’s not the peak season and only two restaurants are open. The Blue Lagoon restaurant serves light meals and breakfast. The breakfast is very rich, and the cakes and breads taste very good. I have also eaten at Qinglong Restaurant, and I recommend the Olympic Shrimp Balls, which are very fresh and taste good. Hope to open more restaurants during the snow season.
I would also like to thank the handsome guy at the front desk. Because the room was a bit hot with my parents, he helped us change to the family room. He showed me the room and helped me change the room with my luggage. He also gave me a fruit plate. Thank you very much.
In short, when I come to Taiwu, I will come to Yunding to live here.

The most commendable thing is that the summer temperature here is about five degrees lower than that in Chongli, which is very suitable for summer vacation. The room facilities are too old, the sanitation service is not generally bad, there is basically no vacuuming, hair can be seen everywhere beside the bedding and in the bathroom, the disposable items are not as good as Samsung hotels, the slippers smell too bad, the plastic of the mineral water bottle is as thin as paper, and the breakfast is mediocre. The advantage is that the price is relatively friendly, the room is spacious, the climate is cool, and it is the best summer escape.

msg:Let me start with the advantages:
The hotel is located in the Sparta venue, with underground parking, which is very convenient and quick to check in.
The room has two bathrooms, no need to wait for the toilet, with a balcony and a good view.
However, there is no direct-charge power supply at the bedside of the hotel, and the USB socket charges very slowly. There is no direct-charge power supply socket on the tea table, and you have to take a kettle to the bathroom to boil water. It is recommended to solve this problem. The hygiene is OK, but I found a cockroach in the shower when I took a shower at night...
Food: A set of double barbecue was given when I booked, and I went to eat it in the evening (note that the meal can only be ordered at 5:30 pm). The order was AB, but I consulted with the waiter and got a C set meal (worth 98 yuan). The food was okay, but it was quite funny.
The room came with 2 adult breakfasts, and I really paid for it with my children, 49 yuan, which is very principled.

Perhaps because Sparta brought too many guests, the order of breakfast was a bit chaotic, the staff was not humane enough, and the height standard for children was too strict, which has never been encountered in other hotels. Due to the bad weather, the time for the child to participate in the competition was extended, and it was not very smooth to apply for a late check-out at the front desk. This is a situation that has never been encountered in the star hotel where I stayed before. The next time I come to Chongli for vacation, I probably won't live here again.

The service attitude of the front desk and room service staff is very good.

There are also many options for lunch and dinner, from fast food to hot pot and barbecue. The food at Qinglong Restaurant tastes pretty good. It is also very convenient for the children to have a KFC Pizza Hut for lunch and go skiing in the afternoon.
There are many ski equipment shops in the ski equipment hall. If you forget to bring your equipment, you can buy it now.
I hope the hotel can renovate the rooms during the summer off-season, then I will choose Genting Hotel again next year.

During the day, I enjoyed the cool weather of 24°C outside and returned to the hotel to fight against the sweltering heat of 28°C indoors. Leave a one foot wide seam! ! It's so hot at night that I can't sleep, but the hotel is so considerately equipped with quilts, it's crazy, a five-star hotel, it's like this for two nights, you know, I came here to cool off! !
When I left the store, I asked the lobby manager and complained, but I didn’t get an apology. She reported to the superior and explained with a smile. Next time you come back, you can give me a discount on the room rate or give me a meal coupon. Thank you so much. You really treat tourists as relatives. I wish you sleep peacefully in the stuffy box at 278°C every night. The pride of the service industry! !

Of course, there are still advantages: the design of the hotel is magnificent, the room facilities can be fully equipped (but the floor is already uneven), the location is unique, the surrounding scenery is good, the cable car is convenient and the scenery is very good (it has nothing to do with the hotel management), these It's better to add up than to change

On the whole, this five-star hotel relies on the good scenery, and does not want to make progress on such a good foundation. Sooner or later, it will be easily surpassed by the surrounding Taiwu, Fulong Town's multi-format and rich service resources, and the upcoming Aranya. If you continue to keep going like this, you will lie flat and rotten, without any awareness of safety and service, and you will get results sooner or later😌

I would like to make another small suggestion. You should have a good idea of ​​a house like yours. When advertising on Ctrip, you should honestly write that there are no windows and no air-conditioning. It is suspected of fraud to use the hot-selling mountain view house as a gimmick!

I watched the women's football in the bedroom with my parents at night.
The air conditioner in the room does not have a cooling function, and it is a bit stuffy at night. I called the front desk and sent a fan, and the service was very good. I asked the switchboard for assistance several times in the room (getting shampoo, dealing with the smell in the bathroom, etc.), and I felt annoyed. The attitude of the hotel staff was pretty good.
The breakfast on the second day was not bad. After eating, I took the cable car up the mountain. It was very convenient, just outside the restaurant.
The hotel has a shuttle bus to Prince City Station, but we thought it was early, so we planned to take a taxi. Who knows that the hotel Didi is not easy to call. I wanted to ask the front desk if there is a car training service. I was told that their fleet would cost 80 to go to Prince City. The little brother said that you should still go to Didi...

The room is quite big, with a balcony, facing the ski run, with green grass and mountains, and a nice view. Breakfast is also good. The front desk and room service staff are very nice and help with various issues. There is also a laser show in the evening. It is worth recommending, and I will stay again next time.
However, hot water needs to be taken seriously by the hotel. I think maybe the hotel considered that this season used to be a summer escape, so the hot water was only about 30 degrees.

The overall feeling is very good, very quiet and suitable for staying and resting. The parking lot is inside the hotel but not underground. This is very convenient. The overall decoration is mainly in log style. The lobby is very a**ospheric. The LED screen on the ground reflects the surging sea water, which is quite impressive. The children like the parent-child room type very much, and there are small tents. The service attitude is also very good. If there is any problem, the front desk will actively and effectively solve it. The breakfast is also good, especially the pancakes made first, the eldest sister's craftsmanship is good! All in all, a very satisfying stay. By the way, nucleic acid testing can be done every day from 14:00-15:00 in the hotel lobby, which is very convenient. I will choose here in the future when I have the opportunity.

msg:This trip to Genting was disappointing. We have lived in this hotel since the opening of Genting, and we basically stay in Genting every time we come to ski. Facilities are old and few. The swimming pool is not open, and there are no entertainment facilities. There used to be some billiards or table football in the lobby on the first floor, but now there is nothing. The gym is open and the equipment is very good. But I don't think there are people who go to the gym after a day of skiing. Food and beverages have increased, but KFC and Pizza Hut are closed after four o'clock. But the oat noodles at Qinglong restaurant are really delicious. It is barely acceptable as a simple ski hotel, but not when considering a ski holiday. But if it is just simple skiing, there is no need to live in Genting, after all, the price is quite high now. After all, there are still some ski hotels in Chongli now.

The breakfast buffet is good, but there are plenty of people but the supplement is timely, and the food is also abundant. The massage girl said this is a five-star? It’s built on the hillside. Unfortunately, I didn’t take a closer look when I rushed to Taiwu town the next day.
Of course, Godzilla has a lot of charging points

But we are also an educated person. After waiting for a long time, when I asked the front desk, the little brother Si Jie upgraded the room for us and we were able to check in immediately, and the service attitude of this little brother really did not poke the room. The room is very good. The only shortcoming is that it is missing. Girls with full-length mirrors, hahahaha, all know the room is very clean, don’t worry, let’s move in
One more word, the hotel is very big

There is a cable car to the top of the mountain, the wildflowers on the top of the mountain are beautiful, and there is a stargazing dinner. On the top of the mountain, I saw several cycling enthusiasts cycling down the mountain, and I sincerely admire them. In the evening, there are movies on the lawn of the hotel, and you can also watch the stars halfway up the mountain. During the festival, there is a tree-playing performance. The hotel room is relatively spacious, and the view from the window is also good. There is an induction cooker in the room. The disadvantage is that there is no pot. The hotel entrance is not easy to find

msg:This Genting Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel does not meet the five-star standard. The hotel is large and has many rooms but the old bedding and bath towels in the rooms are not new. It takes 5 minutes to wait for a small bowl of noodles and it uses old plastic tableware. Three-star hotels are probably not of this specification. Many operations in the hotel are also particularly inhumane. For example, the cable car and other amu*****t facilities ticket exchanges are not in the same place. There are also time restrictions. The cable car can only be redeemed on the second day of the day. Please redeem it the next day and also pay a deposit. After checking out, you can no longer take the cable car. No reminder in advance. The ticket is printed out with your ID card for you to use on the same day and the next day, you don’t need guests to run around. In short, it is not recommended

The hotel has many entertainment facilities, and children and adults can find their own entertainment methods. It is worth mentioning that in the room, I saw the past and present of the hotel. The founder of the hotel is the son of a Malaysian ******** king. He chose Chongli to build a ski hotel because he likes skiing, and because of this hotel, he promoted Beijing's bid to host the Winter Olympics. Starting from Yunding, Chongli ushered in the Winter Olympics, which changed the world.

msg:不會再住這裏了 服務很差 去參加斯巴達比賽 七點十五開場 七點早餐才開 餐廳説準備了斯巴達選手餐 拿出來兩袋 裏面一根火腿一個八寶飯一個小餐包  我説能不能多給一份 告訴我沒有 一個房間就兩份。。。呵呵 省錢也不能省的這麼*** 自助餐兩個人 你這個破選手餐 成本有十塊錢嗎 你們既然為選手着想 一天跑五十公里的比賽就給這二百來卡熱量的早餐 多給一份也無非就是十來塊錢 餐廳經理還翻着白眼説 要不你就七點來吃。我要不是急着去準備比賽 我絕對現場投訴你 第二天早餐如出一轍 但是比賽時間晚了一些 我想拿個袋子一次性拿一點吃的 趕快吃完 還不佔桌子 結果還是那個經理 繼續翻着白眼 説 自助餐不許打包 我衹是拿一點吃 也不是反覆拿 這也叫打包 最後一天退房 都在旁邊排隊 結果旁邊來了個男的直接插隊 然後前台工作人員接過來就給他辦 我説了一句 該我了吧 都在排隊 服務員直接看了我一眼 問我房號 我告訴她以後她説稍等 然後又繼續給插隊的辦退房。。你們酒店是不是誰往前擠得狠誰先退房？從來不管先來後到？以後不會再住在這裏了 一公里就是太子 便宜服務還好 周邊配套更全 要不是為了比賽方便 誰會選你。。。

msg:到酒店前台辦理入住時，前台服務員看到我們家孩子較大，就免費升級了家庭親子套房，有一個高低床供小朋友自己爬上爬下，非常感謝。另外，個人覺得雲頂最大的好處是安靜和配套基礎設施，雖然整個崇禮的度假小鎮模式基本相同，都是酒店加山景纜車，小童遊樂等，但説頂的位置在山上，所以特別安靜，早上起床走廊裏也很少有嘈雜的響聲，外面就更是安靜，座在陽台就可以看過往的纜車，也可以下樓去參與各種娛樂設施。當天還碰到了斯巴達比賽，才知道這裡是斯巴達的雲頂站，孩子還信誓旦旦的説明年自己也要來參加

缺點：酒店房間設施老舊，淋浴噴頭水壓很小，洗澡的水也不熱，滑一天雪想洗個舒服的熱水澡都不能，單從酒店角度説非常不值。酒店的自助早餐可選品種很少，咖啡機都沒有，壺裡的咖啡寡淡的像白水一樣，其他餐廳也一般，晚餐也不好吃。
總之，圖滑雪方便且不差錢的首選雲頂大酒店，圖性價比選太子酒店。

msg:又雙叒叕來崇禮雲頂滑雪了，依然選擇雲頂大酒店主樓，環境好，設施齊備，服務周到，重點是滑雪特別方便，不出酒店一站式搞定！今年在入住期間感受到了前所未有的幸福，是來自於酒店大堂經理王莉，待人熱情，剛剛入住貼心的送來了果盤，衹因我們在辦理入住時的不期而遇；體貼入微，為我們提供滑雪指引，免費提供備用被子，關心飲食起居；超強責任心，因我不慎將心愛的耳釘丟失在酒店未知角落，王莉經理馬上聯繫途經、逗留場所工作人員幫忙尋找，雖然暫時沒有找到，但是也及時給與反饋，讓這個冬天都變得温暖！再次送上我的感謝！期望來年再相見！😊

msg:住了3天，總體評價就是：如果很喜歡來雲頂滑雪可以住一下，據説是崇禮最好的酒店，性價比不高。
來了之後才知道的事：
1，雲頂滑雪場下午4:30 停運，所以如果下午來基本就白交一碗酒店錢。崇禮大部分滑雪場都這樣，衹要富龍有夜場。
2，酒店晚上沒啥好玩的好逛的，餐廳就是肯德基，藍湖早餐，青龍餐廳，豆撈坊小火鍋啥的。下午2:30-5:00隻有肯德基，以及藍湖餐廳有些麪條炸雞啥的，也能吃飽。好吃就別想了。
3，一次去青龍餐廳吃飯，催的緊了點上來菜裏面都是鹽粒子，後悔莫及去吃飯。但服務員態度都很好…
4，早餐種類都有點，但是都差點意思，碳水多蛋白質少，除了香腸火腿啥的，真正的肉類少，對健身運動人羣不友好。對不起這五星酒店的價格。
5，初學者就不建議去了，衹有兩條初級道，聽教練説太舞初級道最多，富龍性價比最高。所以等班車的時候就發現去太舞的帶孩子多，去富龍的背大板子的多，去雲頂的一大半還是去密苑太子酒店的。
6，這個密苑太子酒店也是雲頂的，班車第一站，也有纜車直接上山頂，門前就是雪道，價格那很折扣了…

酒店服務也好，特別感謝大廳經理王莉，對我們噓寒問暖，送水果，主動幫我聯繫去機場的出租車，入住期間感覺到了家的温暖。

msg:雲頂滑雪場不愧是北京冬奧會的舉辦場地，雲頂酒店更是對得起其五星級酒店的稱號。目前國內國際大牌連鎖酒店橫行，反倒是大部分的五星級酒店基本上都是名存實亡的老舊酒店，但是雲頂大酒店無論從設施、服務和配套都堪稱國際一流水準，尤其是服務人員司傑和其他他的同事們自己所有接待我的人，在我入住的這幾天內都做到了有求必應，貼心管家式服務，讓人倍感親切。家庭親子房佈局合理，房間內帶有冰箱和電磁爐，特別適合一家四口來度假，即可以帶孩子學習滑雪，又可以遠離塵囂，又可以陶冶心情，唯一美中不足的就是傢俱檔次有待提高。以後有機會來張家口滑雪還會選擇雲頂大酒店！
