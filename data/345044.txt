The location is a bit far from the subway, but it's in a beautiful neighborhood full of trees and there are tons of bikes around. 
Overall,a really a nice stay!

msg:The hotel is a mix of old and new. By this, I mean you can tell that some areas are worn from over the years and some parts of it you can tell they have made effort to try and restore. We stayed in this hotel a few days before heading to Disneyland and then back to the hotel for one final night stay. We asked if we could leave our luggage at their storage room and that was no problem at all. There is a mix of English speaking staff at the lobby, so be prepared to have Wechat translate to hand just in case. We were lucky with the staff we spoke to and language barrier wasn’t a problem. 

For our first stay, we stayed in a room at the 18th floor and it wasn’t fancy but just what we needed. Windows outside were dirty but it didn’t bother us, since it’s outside. We booked the 2 bed room suite. There was a living space for the adults to relax while the kids sleep in the bedroom at night. I liked that you could actually control the heating and it wasn’t too drying compared to previous and more fancy places we stayed in Shanghai. There’s a washing machine so you can wash clothes when packing light. It is only a washing machine and not a dryer. They provide washing powder (free) and a hanging clothes rail, you just need to call reception and ask. In the kitchen there is an induction hob but no pots or pans are provided. It didn’t bother us, since we had breakfast included with our stay. There was sufficient selection for breakfast. If you go a bit later, certain foods are not replenished. I think they were understaffed the first day of our stay, lots of tables were free but they had dirty dishes on all of them, so we had to ask someone to clean a table for us. The following days were fine. Fruits were left in our room after each clean. 

On our stay back, we stayed in a room on the 15th floor for one night. They should not let people stay in that room, especially with kids. Parts of the wall of the bathroom is very damp and the wall’s paint was crumbling. The plumbing was not great either, the drain in the main shower room came off and it was just bare concrete and a hole exposed. You could hear water flowing all through the night so we had to close the bathroom door so we could sleep. Since we mainly just slept that night and checked out early in the morning, we didn’t bother complaining and was in the rush to get to the airport so no pictures were taken.

msg:This time we have booked in three rooms. However, we are very disappointed. Few things, we want to mention and we will write letter to compliant. First, the outlook of the hotel is older than the pictures we sees online. The bath shower is horrible happen same thing in Room 715, 718, 719. Water weak and water sometimes hot and cold. Very hard to adjust and we actually got burn by the hot water. Second the hair dryer can’t switch off (Room 718). You need to unplug the wire in order turn off which is very dangerous. The toilet bowl flash is weak, we need to flash at least two times to clear. Last but not least we got stack at the exit stand when we leave this morning to the airport. It takes almost 10 mins for the exit stand to open. Which even the taxi driver said things here is poor and broken. As it take him time to explain he is here to pick up guests in order to let him in. Not very helpful stuffs. We have pointed out the problems to the front desk staff. However, she still laugh and not serious faces about the problems. We been to many hotels in many places. This is the first time we experiencing these problems which shouldn’t be happen. Safety Quality not met. Please investigate and clarify. We will be writing complaints letter to the hotel when we get back to Hong Kong.

The hotel is falling apart. It's nasty.
The breakfast is terrible as well. From the food to the cleanliness. We were having breakfast and couldn't stand some rotten food smell that was coming from somewhere, as we finally noticed that just beside the tables the waiter had two bowls that he used from cleaning. One was full of dirty plates and the other one was a mix of food waste and drink waste. Disgusting!
Do not recommend this place to anyone.

msg:Good: The hotel's atrium is really amazing with a huge painting spanning many floors hanging on the wall. The bed very comfortable. Staff were helpful when I was unable to connect to the room Wifi despite multiple attempts. There were some nice surprises at breakfast, such as Japanese miso soup and natto. (First time I see these at a hotel outside of Japan.) Good choices for pastries at breakfast. 

Bad: There is no swimming pool. The bathroom was showing signs of age and the floor got soaking wet when using the shower. As others have commented, the hotel room has a balcony that is inaccessible. The view from the room was not very attractive. No made-to-order omelets at breakfast and the selection of cold cuts were quite poor. The hotel is not within walking distance of a metro station and not in a very interesting area.

msg:This is a very cost-effective Accor Grand Mercure Hotel. The location is excellent, only 10 minutes away from the exhibition (Shanghai World Trade Exhibition Center). The rooms here have small balconies, which is a special plus. There is also a surprise, that is, there is a washing machine in the room. For people like me who often travel outside, seeing the washing machine is like seeing the existence of relatives! There are some minor shortcomings, that is, the system is a bit old, the water pressure is insufficient, the water output is too small, and there is no shower head that can be taken. Can it be improved? In addition, I especially want to praise the service. Service is the soft power of a hotel. When I confirmed, I felt Kenny Hu's professional service and enthusiasm. You must know that this area is a place where Japanese and Korean friends gather, so the service itself is a competitive advantage. This is especially praised. In addition, their breakfast is really great, which allows me to see the ingenuity of the entire chef team. You will see their attention to ingredients and food! It's great~ In the morning, my bestie and I ate a combination of breakfast and lunch without wasting food, that is, two meals combined into one meal. To see the chef's cooking skills, don't look at what others say, just look at whether he has a clean plate. We practice the clean plate action. I will come again next time, see you next time!

msg:A cost-effective choice for May Day.
Location: Near Hongqiao Airport and Railway Station, in a hidden corner of Shanghai, Changning District, which is not popular.
Transportation: It is a little far from Loushanguan subway station. You need to ride a shared bicycle every time, but it doesn’t matter. It’s a city walk, and it’s comfortable to ride a bicycle with few people. But if you want to go to popular attractions, the subway time will be very long, most of the time it takes an hour.
Accommodation: An old Japanese five-star hotel, the interior is a little shocking, and the floor is really high; the configuration actually has a refrigerator, washing machine, smart toilet, and induction cooker for cooking; the city scenery is very good, and you can see Hongqiao Airport in the distance; it is very quiet, you can’t hear any noisy sounds, there are no vehicle horns or energetic young men on the road, and you can’t hear the noise of tourists going out early and returning late in general holiday hotels; the only disadvantage is that the bathroom door is an old sliding wooden door, the friction sound is loud, and it leaks light.
Dining: There are too many Japanese food restaurants around, and of course there is no shortage of commercial complexes, so you don’t have to worry about eating.
Suitable for people who come frequently and are not in a hurry to check in, because the cost-effectiveness is really good.

I asked Ctrip online how many bathrooms there were. Ctrip responded promptly and said there was only one bathroom. When I actually checked in, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were two bathrooms in a business hotel with free parking! I gave the hotel a lot of points. The only drawback was that the breakfast tableware was extremely dirty! The water cup and 🍴 tableware have not been cleaned after four days of eating! ! The breakfast menu is very rich! The quality is also very good! Give five stars!

There are delicious Japanese ramen and barbecue downstairs, and the tuna sashimi nearby is also of good quality. Not far away, there is also Apita under Jinhong Bridge, which has many things that you usually have to buy on behalf of others. When I was tired, I went back to the hotel and ate the cake from Le 98 downstairs. It was unexpectedly delicious! The room was also very clean, with a washlet toilet and no odor. The windows in the room are also large enough to overlook the distance, and there is also a balcony (but you have to sign a safety agreement before you can open it, which is understandable). The hotel staff are also very friendly and it was a great stay. It happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival. When I left, I saw a mooncake gift box in the lobby. I also took a box of mooncakes with me. It is said that they are 100:1 replicas of the master paintings in the hotel. Next time I come to Xianxia, ​​I will choose the Grand Mercure Hotel to stay!

The air conditioner sounded too loud, but the smell was still the same. I lost my clothes and didn’t find it after cleaning... On the third day, the air conditioner sounded too loud Large, bath faucets require incredible arm strength to unscrew. The waiters only stare at the requirements of the system, ignoring the real customers. I don't know if they are serving too many Japanese customers, or they are no longer able to meet the basic needs of Chinese people. The price of 1,000 yuan, Samsung level, is already a cautious evaluation!

msg:I have stayed many times, so I must describe the whole thing well: The location of the hotel depends on the needs of each person. I am very satisfied with the counter and the service staff. Basically, the check-in is fast and smiling, but I occasionally encounter service staff who are not patient. The male waiter for ice cubes, because he is a little deaf, went directly into the room to change the ice bucket without asking, and there was no smile on his face. The toilet facilities are old, even moldy, and the supply of hot and cold water is unstable, sometimes hot and cold, The most unbearable thing is the toilet door, the switch is harsh and shakes, and it seems to collapse. The previous booking included early booking, it is not good, it is not four-star standard, this time I did not book. Summary: At this price, it can only be said to be slightly low, but acceptable. The front desk and other waiters must be praised. It is estimated that the hot and cold water for bathing and the door will not be improved, but at least the mold should be cleaned up.

I heard the sound of packing things at 3:30 in the middle of the night, and I started to prepare breakfast at 4:30, and there was the sound of dishes. Didn't sleep well for two nights.

I went out in the morning, came back at 1:30 and hadn't cleaned the room yet, started lunch break at 2:00, someone called and asked if I could clean it now, I said I had pressed the do not disturb light, shouldn't you call, I am taking a nap. The answer is, there is this rule, two points must be called to inquire. I said that I would clean it at five o'clock, and was told that I was off work at that time, so I said that there was no need to clean it.

As a five-star hotel, the front desk service is very good, and there is a welcome at the door.

My friends in Shanghai helped me book a hotel near the company, and I took the high-speed rail ride for a long time to stay at the Grand Mercure Shanghai Hongqiao booked by my friend. The outside of the hotel seems simple and simple, but after checking in, I found that the hotel has a lot of Japanese hotel a**osphere. The welcome fruits and snacks made my tired mood disappear instantly. The hotel thought very thoughtfully. The service attitude is still very good. Although the buffet is not very amazing, it is very comprehensive. Traveling is also very convenient. There are commercial streets and shopping malls around at night, and it is also very convenient to the train station. The environment and sanitation are similar to the ones I had when I went to Japan. Next time I come to Shanghai on business, I will still choose Grand Mercure Hotel. If you have friends on business trips, you can recommend it.

There are no discounts for long-term stays, and the 999 coupons I bought can’t be used. In short, the overall experience Not great, nothing to expect except bigger rooms. It has been renovated.

msg:The breakfast is relatively rich and the service efficiency is relatively fast. It meets the five-star standard. It is more comfortable. It is directly praised. Thank the maintenance staff for helping me. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will live here. The surrounding traffic is very convenient. However, one impression is that the waiter speaks English to me, a Chinese. I didn’t react, as if I was being laughed at. I also speak English and Japanese. I don’t think there is any need to pretend to be b. Others are impeccable.

msg:When checking in, I also asked the front desk about the morning meal time, and the front desk also informed the time! Then, because I was in a hurry in the morning and wanted to leave as soon as possible after eating, I unfortunately entered the dining area. The waiter at the door repeatedly confirmed with us whether there was a problem with breakfast while we were preparing to take breakfast. I showed him the order, but he still didn’t believe him. Not only did we fail to take care of the guests’ dining emotions, we waited and waited, asked and asked again, but didn’t ask the result. I didn’t eat breakfast and went to the front desk theory. When I ran to the front desk, I asked the front desk clerk received last night. The professional service standard told her that she was a newcomer. I don’t know what the complaint phone number was. She also said that it was too late last night. I didn’t seriously confirm whether there was breakfast or rubbish. This is the second time I have stayed in this store, so I shouldn’t visit again. Yes, I advise everyone to consider the service level of this house if you want to live in the future

I saw the guests take the initiative to help with the luggage. The front desk at check-in is also very professional. The room service staff also smiles when they see the guests. I would like to praise this~ But the good impression is gone after check-in. The room The facilities are relatively old, the water pressure is too low, and the hot water takes a long time. The most frustrating thing is the porter who brought the luggage up. I don’t know if your store has any training in this area. How can there be knocks on the door seven or eight times in a row, and the movements are incomparably huge? After opening the door, he also looked reluctant. Will not be coming again.

房間的隔音比較同級別酒店略有不足，比較明顯的是門那塊，門口廊道有人交談，門內聽的非常清楚  房間內mini bar收費有點恐怖，28$一瓶罐裝可樂【慎點】，不用自然就不用收費。

酒店沒有送餐機器人，沒有人幫你送外賣上房間，需要自己下樓到酒店門口的外賣櫃拿

大廳門口太隱蔽，車進去不熟悉的會往右邊開去，從視覺上看吃虧了，店的位置在左手邊，門面太默默無聞，衹有進門才有種柳暗花明又一村的感覺

可惜的是我沒有吃到酒店早餐，略有遺憾，房間我沒拍，我去酒店要拍照衹有在酒店內就餐的時候，很可惜此次我沒有吃到

在此**表揚點名【客服部黃女士】，酒店房間一些問題一些需要，此位工作人員回答細心嗓音親切，可以流利雙語交流，讓我身在他國倍感親切Bravo

無機器人送東西

最最最重要的是前台態度極差。因為續住當天開會晚了一些下去買單（下午四點），前台拿着post機上來收錢，説萬一你跑了怎麼辦？？那天真的氣到發抖，前台還略得意的樣子確實不太好。並且之前添加了前台某經理，原本以為會不認可其同事做法，結果呵呵。作為星級酒店，加四瓶礦泉水也不太容易。anyway，以後堅決不去這家酒店了，太沒禮貌，太不尊重人。

個人認為如果將事情原委説清楚完全不是問題，但是這樣的溝通確實讓人挺氣憤。好像也不是這個前台個人特質，也可能這個酒店比較高檔員工看多了人上人，集體態度都差不多。以後不會在此入住

還有，我續住的房間，用積分換的水果，為什麼不送呢，本來想都半夜回酒店了，沒給你們打電話要，如果沒有接了420的洗衣費帳單都想算了，這個酒店國外人多，希望你們沒有這麼對國際友人，不然中國的臉可是讓你們丟的撿都撿不起來

2：晚上回來很累，就在酒店陪父母簡單吃一點，上二樓單點，點啥啥沒有，問就是多餘，永遠一句話，菜單就是這樣！what？
好，不計較，有啥吃啥，等半天沒有水，服務員建議讓我們單點換成吃自助，説可能等待時間過久，要半小時，廚師很忙！！！我沒見過哪個酒店如此操作，是缺錢了還是覺得客户可以隨便坑？我們兩百塊能解決的事，要花八百解決？？難道掙錢不行的不配住你們家？
3：最後，果斷搬走！呵～你家餐廳服務員都是祖宗來的
