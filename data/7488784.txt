msg:Not worth the price, not recommended
I had to ask for a toothbrush from the front desk. The next day, the aunt took the toothbrush away and asked the front desk for it again. The phone number at the front desk couldn't be reached.
The hygiene was particularly bad. The water that the aunt came in to mop the floor after cleaning had not dried up the smell of sewage in the house, so she opened the window for a long time to ventilate the room.
The paper was not replenished the next day, and even the paper in the room was used up.
The toiletries are extremely poor and damage the skin.
The surrounding area is inconvenient, there is construction outside, and it is very noisy and dusty when the windows are opened.
The air conditioner is loud and the internet is poor.
The room is very small. There is only one leg between the bed and the desk. I don’t know how many times I bumped into it. You can see the picture.

My boyfriend also has dandruff all over his shoulders after washing with the shower gel. It was extremely dry, and my whole body began to peel off layers of white skin. Doesn’t it come with normal bath products at this price? ?
The decoration is very good, the room is very small, the toilet is very poor, the toilet seat is the kind that moves accidentally, and there is no capsule coffee machine.
The hotel couldn't connect to the Internet for half an hour.
Very poor value for money, not recommended.
