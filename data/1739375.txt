msg:The service was incredibly nice. The hotel location was perfect . And what a stunning view out of the hotel room . 
The breakfast was also very very good. Starting with eggs, waffles, Chinese food (very delicious),German meet loaf until Müsli, vegetable and fruits as a starter . 
We can also recommend the burger in the hotel restaurant. 
In the basement was a huge swimming pool and a very nice and clean kids play club .
I think we will come back for a nice family weekend trip @Kempinski

The service is great, everyone is friendly and I had wonderful service from one of the employees named Osborn! I was happy that some of the workers spoke some English, but everyone is very polite. We enjoyed the Okterberfest event at the hotel, the ride on the boat was pleasant as well. We didn’t get to bike ride but had a fun time watching people riding and enjoy the nice weather.

msg:Pretty good hotel, right by the lake. Not to far from the train station, Huairou town, or other local attractions. Breakfast and restaurants in general were pretty good.
The main issue is that for a hotel of this league in such an iconic building, it is unnaceptable that guests can't control the temperature in the rooms.
The only opton available is how strong the heater fans run, which was a problem for us as the room as already extremely hot and windows don't open. 
Management upgraded us to a lakeview room, where the temperatures were a few degrees lower as the sun doesn't hit it directly. This helped A LOT, but it would still be preferable to have the room cooler at sleeping time.

The third floor of the hotel is suitable for cycling and the scenery is also beautiful! I would like to especially praise the front desk staff Liu Amy (Liu Any), who is not sure which name it is. When checking in, the service attitude was very good, the explanation was clear, and the room type was specially upgraded. Children's etiquette was arranged for the children. Some small details were explained very well, which made my child sigh and said that he was very satisfied with this hotel.

msg:Needless to say, the hotel is definitely magnificent and a landmark building. The environment is very good. A few stairs down the back door on the third floor lead directly to the lake, which is very convenient. If there are elderly people using wheelchairs, they can go around from the front door. The overall route is very close, which is suitable for elderly people or children with limited mobility. The lakeside at the door is very suitable for walking in the morning and evening. There are 24-hour self-service rental points for various bicycles, with prices ranging from 30 to 120. The bed in the hotel is slightly soft, not too soft, and quite suitable. The pillow is also comfortable. The hot water is rushing, and the bathtub is also good. There are many types of breakfast, which are also delicious. There are many restaurants for dinner. We ate at the German restaurant and beer bar. The ** group purchase of 299 set meal is particularly cost-effective, enough for 3-4 people. We also ordered other meats, which are very large, and the beer is also good. It is highly recommended.

Taking a walk on the embankment at night is a good place to enjoy the night view of Yanqi Lake! The hotel has a rich breakfast, and the service in both the guest room and the restaurant is very good👍!

msg:In general, the room is very clean and the area is OK, but there is no sofa. I learned that all room types have sofas, but this parent-child room does not, which is inconsistent with the price. This room type has a larger bathroom, and there is really no other highlights, which is not as good as an ordinary standard room. The lobby reception is generally very enthusiastic, but the waiting time is too long and there are few receptionists. The front desk storage service is very good and it is convenient to store bicycles (the service of the brother at the storage is very thoughtful). The restaurant, especially the Chinese restaurant reception, was called out because there were many people on holidays. When we went there, we had to wait for a seat, but the front desk lady was a little flustered and did not know how to arrange it reasonably. It should be registered in order. But there was no order at all, and it was a mess. The experience was so bad that I chose not to eat in the end! The hotel environment is definitely nothing to say. It is beautiful by the lake. The hotel has too few entertainment facilities. 2 days and one night is enough. Some bar counter services are also poor. I hope the hotel can provide more training, which is worthy of the room rate of more than 3,000 per night.

The third floor directly leads to the levee, where you can enjoy the view and exercise, and the air is fresh. The hotel has complete facilities, clean and comfortable, and parking is super convenient! The beautiful lady at the front desk was warm and thoughtful, and she also added a breakfast for us for free. The check-in was very fast. The hotel's facilities and services were introduced in detail, professional and warm. The handsome concierge saw that we had elderly people, guided us to the revolving door, and helped us deliver our luggage to the room. It was really great. The room service staff were also very enthusiastic, meticulous and patient. We also experienced the hotel's breakfast, Chinese restaurant and beer house. The service of the beautiful ladies and handsome guys was so warm! The fresh brew in the beer house is really great! It's refreshing and not intoxicating. Even my father who doesn't like beer praised it. It's so delicious! In short, in Beijing, if you want to find a place with good landscapes and delicious food, Kempinski is worth experiencing! A place to heal your body and mind!

Go down to the third floor, and walk out to a dam along the lake, where you can enjoy the view up close. There is a pier at each end, selling boat tickets, and you can take a speedboat or boat to cruise the lake.
[Room] It's pretty good. Although it's not new, it's big and has everything it should have. The curtains are electric. The TV is too small, and I can't see the station logo clearly when changing channels.
[Service] No problem. When delivering the quilt, I asked for two more bottles of free mineral water, and four bottles were delivered in a while.
[Meal] I only ate Prana once, and it was the same as other Prana restaurants, nothing to say. The breakfast is a Chinese and Western buffet, very rich. It is worth mentioning that the noodle stall, I asked for a bowl of noodles, and specifically asked for a little bit, but it turned out to be a big bowl. The noodles were indeed a little bit, but there was soup, a lot of cooked cabbage, kelp, and six colorful fish balls, and they said there were several kinds of stews that could be put alone, and it was impossible to finish it.

Advantages: parent-child friendly, with bed fences (reservation required in advance), a children's playground and swimming pool on the underground floor, a free mini bar (four cans of drinks + a small bag of potato chips), beautiful surroundings, you can also go to Yanqi Hotel, and the buffet restaurant is okay.
Disadvantages: There are many serious holidays, and the check-in queue lasted at least 40 minutes. The buffet restaurant is said to be crowded from 8 to 10 o'clock for breakfast, and the Chinese restaurant is really not delicious.
Overall, it is worth it (group purchase price), and the experience may be better on non-holidays. The return trip is really too congested!

The opposite-sex room was not square and next to the equipment room. The ceiling was made of dirt. The toilet was not sloped and there was a lot of water every time I took a shower. I wiped the floor every time after washing. I just changed the room and was too lazy to change the hotel. I'm sorry for every bit. We stayed in a hotel with more than 1,000 yuan because there were less toothbrushes. We were upgraded to executive level and provided with toiletries. I feel that this is an attitude issue. I’m speechless when I choose a hotel with over 2,000 yuan for a trip and enjoy the same service and environment. I didn’t even have breakfast and had to queue up.

msg:Yanqi Island is quite beautiful. Although spring has just begun, there are not many people and it is very comfortable. I just happened to catch up with Xiaomi Su7’s automotive media conference.
I know that Sunrise Oriental does not focus on parent-child care, but I think most of them are actually taking care of children. Here are some questions:
1. Check-in was extremely slow. It might be the weekend. First of all, there was almost no space in the ground parking lot. There were also many buses. I thought I was in time for the meeting, but it was not. It took almost 40 minutes to queue up in the lobby to check-in with my children. Finally got it done and added a 450L lake view room with a nice view;
2. I want a playpen with my baby in the hotel. This should be the standard feature of the hotel now, but they said that the playpen has not been reserved and has not been booked. Oh my God, a children’s playpen has to be called several days in advance to make an appoin**ent. It’s really crazy. . The staff recommended that the two beds be pushed together. Well, in line with the principle of enjoying the weekend, let’s make do;
3. This is the most annoying breakfast queue of this trip, but not everyone queues. We took our little one-year-old baby and sat at the door of the breakfast room waiting for our number to be called. There are 10 tables in front. However, there were actually a large number of people at the door who entered directly without taking a number. Is this how breakfast is managed? Those who obeyed the rules were waiting stupidly at the door, while a bunch of people who didn't take numbers didn't know what the staff were doing and didn't care. I couldn't help but asked the receptionist at the door, but he was completely ignored. Start calling the number yourself. How can Kempinski be considered a five-star hotel? Is this the breakfast service? ! When I finally got in, I discovered that it wasn't that there were no seats inside, but that there were not enough people to clear the place. It seemed that those who didn't take a number could just find a table and ask the waiter to clear it. There is no order at all
Finally, by the way, as a hotel doll collector, I saw that there were little swans and I didn’t expect to get one as a gift. But I wanted to buy one and take it away, but it didn’t happen. I was disappointed. I bought a piece of Black Forest when I left. It was pretty good.
The reason why I gave it four stars for hygiene is because there is an obvious layer of dust on the bedside table...that's it.

You can also use the temporary car permit to go to the island for a walk. There are plenty of parking spaces. I personally feel that this is the best choice for living near Yanqi Lake.

Although the furniture is a bit old, the design is timeless, the overall environment is 80% new, the mattress is comfortable and the pillows are very large, and the bathroom facilities are excellent!
The hotel lobby is elegant and elegant, and the swimming pool and gym are the highlights. The breakfast restaurant has average hardware and good taste.
The disadvantage is that the air conditioning warm air temperature does not rise at night and in the morning, and the overall temperature is slightly cooler.

msg:Facilities: The floors and room facilities are all in compliance with Kempinski's specifications. There are ample seats in several restaurants and the design is aesthetically pleasing. The pool has areas for all ages and there are not enough lockers in the changing rooms.
Hygiene: Indoor hygiene is acceptable, but the curtains and TV are dusty. Although the climate conditions in the suburbs of Beijing are indeed difficult to be spotless in winter, as an Internet celebrity hotel whose main selling point is the view, it cannot open windows and has no balcony. In the absence of rain or snow, the dirt on the outside of the window glass is very disturbing. The viewing effect is a bit disappointing.
Environment: Next to the Yanqi Lake Dam, the lake view room has beautiful scenery during the day and night. It is also very convenient to go out for a walk, with convenient transportation and ample parking spaces. City view rooms are suitable for watching the sunrise and sunset in winter.
Service: During the peak Spring Festival season, it is satisfying to have such service quality and efficiency. The breakfast is rich in variety and the quality is considered high in the suburbs of Beijing. Jerry, who is in charge of renting tandem bicycles at the concierge, is very helpful. The waiters at the front desk, telephone service desk, breakfast room, and brewery are also very polite.

msg:The room is close to the elevator room. There is a big crack in the door when it is closed, and the sound insulation effect is particularly poor.
There is no service at all in the entire hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is the best part of this check-in experience. They are warm and thoughtful and will help speed up the room progress. However, there is a long queue for check-in procedures. For some reason, each room takes a long time.
The variety of dishes in the Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory. If the service staff does not understand the dishes, you need to ask someone. It was extremely cold when I went to the Western restaurant for dinner! This is really hard to accept, having to eat while being cold. The breakfast was the worst. It was completely beyond the hotel's reception capacity. The two staff at the door did not cooperate with each other. The hotel did not provide room cards for dining. There was a big family in front of them. The two staff members together had to pay for several people's meals. No one took care of them. The guests at the back caused a backlog. When I saw someone walking in, I quickly recorded the room number one by one. In addition, there was no one to take the seat. I had to find a seat by myself. After entering, I found that everyone was milling around to find an empty seat. There were always people leaving. There was a place to sit on only after it was cleaned up. You have to wait in line for freshly made pancakes, omelettes, and egg buns on the spot, and even spoons for drinking porridge are not provided.
The sanitary environment is also a problem. There are small insects flying in the restaurant, and the steamed buns and self-pickup plates at the steamed points are covered with insects.
Really don't recommend.

I stayed here twice during the Spring Festival and once during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The food, accommodation and transportation were perfect and the scenery was unparalleled. I was extremely comfortable every time, no matter the hardware or software, the mattress was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and well-equipped, and the breakfast was rich. It was one of the few five-star hotels at home and abroad that I have stayed in. Suitable for the whole family, both Chinese and Western food. This time I stayed in the third grade of junior high school and got a free upgrade to the suite with an extra bed. My son forgot to bring his iPhone charger, and the service staff went out of his way to help find it. The hotel will try their best to help with any needs he raised. It was a perfect stay experience. I hope he will come to Huai next winter. North Ski will also stay. I hope the hotel will continue to improve its service quality and make it better and better!

If you need to call me for anything, it would be solved immediately. The lake view from the room is very beautiful, and it's also beautiful at night. The swimming pool is very good. There are three, one for babies and one for surfing. The water temperature is suitable. The water temperature of the standard swimming pool in the middle is a bit low. It is said to be 27°. I feel that it is a mistake. It is indeed a bit cold. The sauna is very good. The naughty castle is not big, but it is enough. The food and beverage consumption is a bit too high, especially the buffet in the evening feels overpriced and nothing serious. The restaurant on the 21st floor has a very good environment and good service.

The front desk will not take the initiative to upgrade returning guests if there are a large number of lake view rooms available. Guests who wish to upgrade must add money! For a Golden Diamond Hotel, the room rate of 1,000+ is not high, but the service cannot keep up, which really makes old customers use up their previous good impressions of the hotel. Although the hygiene of the linen is okay, there are spider webs hanging inside the glass curtain wall (see picture 1). The hair dryer looks like a Dyson and costs about 300 yuan. A smart toilet.

msg:The room is quite satisfactory, but there are two points to complain about: 1) The marble floor has not been wiped clean, and when you put on the hotel's slippers, it sticks to your feet and makes a sticking sound, which is very uncomfortable. 2) Heating should be provided to all of Beijing on the 7th. The hotel rooms should be heated, because the air conditioners are all turned off, and the temperature is still 27 degrees. You can wear less clothes during the day, but it is very boring. It's so hard to sleep at night. If you don't wear it, you might catch a cold. If you wear it or cover yourself with a quilt, you'll sweat.

The room was so hot, but the lobby was freezing. Even after having afternoon tea, I was wearing a down jacket. The Western restaurant for breakfast in the morning was also very cold, so you needed to wear a full down jacket. The dishes were cold as soon as they were taken out, and the plates were also ice cold. I had no appetite at all to stay inside and continue my breakfast, so I just finished it hastily.

I see that there are dozens of rooms with occupancy rates. If Beijing’s public spaces are unwilling to turn on heating or air conditioning in the winter, how can we call it a five-star hotel?

The environment outside the hotel is still beautiful when the weather comes.

The city view room we stayed in this time, the lake view room has to pay extra. It cost at least 450 yuan for the day. I didn’t think it was worth it, so I didn’t add it. The problem of food for two days and one night It's all settled in the Chinese restaurant. The food in the restaurant is clean and hygienic, tastes good, and the price is pretty good too😂 It's acceptable, and I don't eat it often! I found several problems while staying here. I hope the hotel can consider the suggestions I mentioned: 1. The wash basin in the public restroom in the hotel is too high and it is inconvenient for children to wash their hands. I hope they can add a step stool (Yanqi Hotel There is one in the public restroom, which is very good), it will be much more convenient! 2. The handrails in the elevator are relatively sharp all around, and children can easily be hit. At least my child’s height can just hit him (my child is 2 years and 4 months old, and is a bit bigger). 3. The bags in each room are paper bags. It is not environmentally friendly and strong. It should be equipped with environmentally friendly cloth pockets so that it can be used more frequently by hotel guests. 4. At the hotel front desk or in the restaurant, if you meet children, you can give them some small gifts, even very small gifts, so that the children will be very happy (because other hotels we have stayed in, After checking in, when the front desk sees anyone with children, they will give small gifts, some are cups, some are small toys)

Go jogging and cycling along the lake every morning. Take a dip in the swimming pool and hot spring in the evening, a good choice for vacation. The room was pretty good, quite large, but felt a bit dry and stuffy. The lack of a desk lamp was a bit inconvenient.

On the third floor of the hotel, you can go directly to the dam foundation and enjoy the lake view. If you stay in this hotel, you can go directly to Yanqi Island to visit without paying extra. It is recommended to choose a lake view room. Although it is a bit expensive, you can see the lake and mountains from the room. Secondly, the hotel service staff are warm and considerate, and try their best to meet the basic needs mentioned, such as borrowing a nail clipper. Children's slippers, bathrobes, etc. Third, the facilities such as swimming pools, children go to the swimming pool to play, the experience is okay. Fourth, the bedding in the room is relatively clean and comfortable. The shortcomings are that the National Day price is really not cheap, and the breakfast has a lot of choices and no special features. There is also a bad smell in the toilet in the room. The interior decoration feels a bit old. Disposable razors are not provided for men.

msg:I took the elderly and children on a trip during the National Day. I booked two lake view rooms. When I arrived, it was already 1pm. Only one room was available and I had to wait for the other one. So I rode a bike and rowed outside for a while. The weather was good and the scenery was beautiful. It's beautiful. It was already past 4 o'clock when I came back to the hotel. Ms. Xin Yue, the concierge at the front desk, said that the rooms on the same floor were not ready yet. Could it be done on other floors? I said that it would definitely be possible to go up. Unexpectedly, Ms. Xin was very cheerful and directly We were upgraded to a suite 😂 I immediately felt that the wait was worth it.
The only thing I didn't expect this time was that the National Day hotel was full. If you didn't book in advance, you couldn't even get a meal at any restaurant. You had to wait in line for a long time to get a reservation. We got a reservation and waited until 7 o'clock before we finally entered the Chinese restaurant. The price of the restaurant was relatively high. It's high, but the taste is good and the service is excellent. The old man is very happy.

msg:Landmark hotel, good environment and facilities, the hotel's Chinese restaurant tastes very good, the chef is of high standard. It should have been a pleasant journey, but the hotel's front desk service was very disappointing. Especially the lobby manager Ri Ri Xin.
I went to check in first, and my wife took the high-speed train to Beijing at night. When I checked in at the front desk around 14:00 on September 28, I specifically told two people to check in, and there was another lady coming in the evening. The front desk said that she could just come and swipe her ID card. Routine operation, I went to eat by myself and went to bed after ten o'clock. My wife arrived at the hotel around 23:40 in the evening, but Ri Ri Xin refused to let her check in with me on the grounds of protecting customer privacy and that the front desk did not tell her that I had a co-resident, and asked her to contact me before she could check in. The attitude was very bad. I was already asleep at that time, and the hotel should not have disturbed me, and should have communicated with its internal staff in their own way, not targeting customers. The reason given by ri ri xin was that the relationship between men and women is so chaotic now, how could she know what the relationship between me and my wife was? My wife showed her our WeChat chat records. I pointed out the room number and asked her to go directly to the front desk to handle the information. Ri ri xin still made things difficult for her and asked her to call the police to deal with it, and asked my wife to wait on the sofa in the lobby. My wife felt that it was too embarrassing to call the police. It was late at night and she was tired from the journey, so she chose to open another room and check in by herself.
The next morning, I went to the hotel to argue, but there was no one at the front desk and the lobby manager was off duty. After searching for a long time, I contacted ri ri xin and asked her to watch the hotel video recording to see if I had explained the fact that my wife was coming to the front desk. After watching the video recording, she still had a bad attitude and argued with me in every way, refusing to admit her mistakes. My request was very simple at the time, as long as the room fee for the extra room opened by my wife was waived. Ri ri xin said it was impossible, it was simply a ** face. I asked her to contact her leader at the next level.
After the superiors knew about this, they handled it well. The front desk apologized, waived the room fee for the extra room, sent a bottle of red wine, Yanqi Lake tickets and small desserts as compensation, and finally they were quite satisfied.
I wrote this to let the management of Kempinski know that as a service industry, employee training is far from enough. I don’t blame the little sister who checked in at 2 pm. I want to hold managers like ri ri xin accountable. They are arrogant and twisted. They treat a normal thing as "catching a mistress". It is not advisable to watch the excitement and not mind the big things. It is extremely irresponsible to not consider from the customer's perspective in the middle of the night. It is extremely irresponsible to throw the problem to the customer when the hotel can handle it by itself. As a German hotel management team, Kempinski has maintained a rigorous brand image for many years. Customers should always be put first and standardized processes should be put first. I will also feedback this matter through Kempinski's official channels. It is recommended that the management watch the video footage of the hotel front desk around 23:40 on the evening of September 28 and around 7:00 on the morning of September 29, and understand for themselves how the employee ri ri xin handled the problem and how he treated customers.

Maybe it was because we arrived late and the room faced the lake when we checked in. I booked your hotel just to see the lake. Otherwise, who would have the time to book such an expensive hotel? There are so many cost-effective hotels nearby. Then at noon, when check-out hadn’t reached 12 o’clock, you called my room at 11:30. I urge people to leave because I can’t see the time? Do I need your front desk to call me? Even if I ask for a mask at the front desk, there is no one. I advise friends who want to stay to ask them to leave. Once you stay, you will not say anything.

msg:The front desk service staff was very enthusiastic. At the beginning, the two rooms were arranged on a lower floor because the distance between them was close. The windows were tilted outwards, so I asked to change to a higher floor. The view was very good. The hotel room is very spacious, and the small refrigerator drinks for free. The surrounding scenery is not good, it is hot during the day, and it is very beautiful to take pictures in the evening. Breakfast is also good.

The breakfast is also a highlight, very rich in both Chinese and Western styles. There is also porridge and bread for kids. There is a swimming pool, gym and children's play area on the ba*****t floor, which is a hotel suitable for parents and children.

In the past two days, it has been raining again☔, and the lakes and mountains are empty and rainy, and it looks like a painting of ink and wash. Special thanks to the handsome waiter at the front desk for upgrading the selected city-view room to a lake-view room. Although it cost more money, the scenery is pleasant. The elderly are very happy and will come again next time if they have the opportunity.

It feels average, but the experience after actually checking in is really good. Open the door and enter. The lake view is very beautiful. It makes people feel very relaxed and have a vacation I feel that the children play well

I stayed here in 2015. I feel that it hasn’t been long since it opened. The service is not good at all. This stay is better than last time, and the facilities are okay.

My favorite swimming pool is suitable for children of all ages

msg:Facilities: Points are deducted for facilities. I think it is not a hotel of this level. The room temperature must be comfortable. This is the most basic thing. The indoor temperature is controlled by the central air conditioner. There is no difference between the highest temperature and the previous one. The adults woke up so cold in the morning that they all had runny noses. Not to mention that Beijing’s winter itself requires equipment such as humidifiers.

Regarding health and environment, I think there is no problem and it is very good.


Service: The service staff I encountered have always been lukewarm, which I personally think is quite comfortable.

There is also the issue of breakfast. The occupancy rate is relatively high during the New Year's Day holiday. Does it have to be closed at the same time as on weekdays? Is it better to extend it slightly?

The front desk didn’t welcome guests, and I didn’t see luggage delivery service. I think a five-star hotel should provide service. The TV system in the room is broken. It took an hour for technical repairs. The most incomprehensible thing is that the air outlet blows to the bed and the pillows feel unsupported, and there will be noise when sleeping at night. What I mind the most is that the air outlet is blowing towards the bed. At least I can add a windshield. I don’t care at all.
Recommended Western-style breakfast and dinner buffet, Western-style snacks are still of a good level

There are also some garden-style neighboring buildings, which reflect each other and make you feel like you have come to the water town garden in the south. Room facilities and bedding are also remarkable. One thing to mention is that the entire hotel service staff (including the front desk in the lobby) speak very little or no polite language. Therefore, the scope of service, the harmony and harmony of the entire hotel are ordinary. The taste of a five-star hotel is not strong. However I would still recommend this hotel.

msg:This time I stayed at Kempinski Yanxihu Hotel, and the overall feeling is very good! The service process is smooth, the check-in experience is comfortable, the room view is invincible, and the surrounding facilities are excellent. The maintenance of the hotel is still very good. Hotel guests drive into the door to receive a parking voucher, and inform the front desk to receive a free parking voucher during check-in. A front desk staff named CoCo helped me check in very enthusiastically and professionally. There is also a tall red-clothed staff member in red clothes. The service is very good. He can predict the needs of customers and solve problems in one step. The overall hardware of the hotel is sufficient. The only regret is that it may be due to time. The underground parking lot that was originally built was a bit cramped. The staff on the 18th floor of the hotel room are also very good. Everything you need has been delivered to the room very quickly. It is very efficient. Like it, the uncle who sent the welcome fruit is also very attentive. The breakfast on the second day was very satisfactory to me. Kempinski has stayed in many hotels, including other brands of hotels, Marriott, Hilton, Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula, Waldorf Astoria, Summer Palace, Bulgari, if the same level In comparison, except for Waldorf's semi-buffet breakfast, which can win here, other buffet breakfasts are better than here, I am afraid that there are very few. The breakfast here has a wide variety and the quality is very good. All of them are fresh ingredients and the moment you eat them, there is a pot gas. To put it bluntly, I will make a lot of them if you eat them or not. If they get cold and hard, it doesn’t matter to me after a long time, and it doesn’t matter the quality and taste of the food, but this is not the case here. The rhythm is very well controlled. Not bad, thumbs up. The service staff in the dining area here are also very hardworking and very discerning. I sat on the sofa area next to the cold dishes. The reception service at the door is also in place. I also used the gym during my stay, and I felt very good. The overall feeling is very good. I hope it can be maintained, and next time I can invite friends to come together!

msg:Before going to Yanqi Lake, I lived in Zhongjian. This time I stayed in Shell, which refreshed my understanding of five-star hotels. I regret it and disappoint! As soon as I entered the room, there was blood or oil stains on the wallpaper. The mother of the child felt disgusted when she saw it, and reported this situation to the waiter. The waiter asked if you just moved in? We said yes, and then asked, what do you mean. To be honest, I really didn't know how to pick it up, so I had to say it was all right, and the waiter walked away confidently. Then I saw the dusty windows and the construction site outside the window, and then I was told that the dam was under construction, and I couldn't go up and see the lake... These are all told after you live. I can't watch the TV at night, the waiter came and said it was overloaded, unplug it and log in again, that's all. It was found that the TV was crooked, and the answer was the question of installation later. I stayed for two nights. For breakfast on the last day, when I took the dinner plate, I felt a hard one. If I looked closely, it was because the previous things had not been washed. Sitting down to eat buns, there was a bug on it, and the waiter was called, but they took it away without explaining, and then brought three of the same one. I really can't find the logic to solve this problem. Put down the steamed stuffed bun, and ran to make coffee for the foreigner who sang. When leaving the restaurant, report the room number and ask the catering manager to find me. They came back after a while, took a fruit plate, explained that half of the disinfection was done yesterday, and it was this season again... and then thanked me for helping them find the problem. It's another word that I won't answer, take it! There are quite a few hotels I live in, most of which are four-star and five-star. Kempinski has refreshed my understanding. I really don’t know how to talk to their service staff. My question!

msg:First, you must live with a lake view, otherwise the landscape experience will be directly discounted, and the 21st floor is currently closed for renovation, so you can't see the high-altitude landscape at all, which is a pity. And now that the road is being built, there is no way to cycle around the island. It is best to drive to the island. Second, the hotel is relatively old, with aging facilities, especially the dirty countertops in the bathroom, and the minibar and mini bar are even more dilapidated, which cannot support the five-star standard at all. Third, the service staff are very enthusiastic, have a good attitude and are responsive to requests. We forgot the charger when we left the store, and the waiter specially called to inform us and deliver it to us. Fourth, you must go to the island to see the Jixian Hall. I checked the ticket price on the Internet and it is 100. It is worthwhile to go and have a look. That's all, but it's quite shocking to see the big shells when you come out of the tunnel! There are both advantages and disadvantages. The facilities may not be able to be improved in the short term. I hope that the breakfast can have one or two special features. At present, there are many types of breakfast, but they are really quite satisfactory and there are no highlights.

Booked a lake view room

In addition, the swimming pool on the ba*****t floor is really nice

The pool is almost empty on Sunday and Monday nights
Three children can play casually in the warm water pool
The child is having fun in it
There is also a children's playground on the ba*****t floor
small place
More suitable for younger babies
There are several game consoles and claw machines next to it
older children can play
The food in the brewery on the first floor is inedible
beer sucks
It's really bad, except for the pre-dinner bread, of course.
In addition, the dinner buffet of the hotel on the second floor is due to the reception of group meals
It is not recommended to eat here
say canteen meal
so didn't try

You can see Yanxi Lake in the room, but don't go there after it rains. The glass is really not clean, there are mud watermarks, and the rest are quite satisfactory👍

msg:First of all, when visiting this hotel around Yanqi Lake, I checked in on a cloudy day, and it cleared up the next morning. The room type is still like the lake view room, the view is wide and the room is spacious. The package I bought this time includes afternoon tea ☕️, I am happy 🥳 because it is a weekday and there are not many customers. Thanks to Mr. Cao and Ms. Zhou who checked in at the front desk, the service is thoughtful and meticulous. Xiao Zhou, a male intern in the concierge depar**ent, helped us carry our luggage all the way to the room. Because of personal reasons, we changed rooms and went upstairs and downstairs twice. I would like to give you a big thumbs up. Finally, I would like to give a kind reminder to the little masters, the important things are said three times: remember to bring the charging plug, because I borrowed it from the front desk. There is free bottled water in the room, but it is not enough to drink. A bottle of 18 yuan is at your own expense. You can bring some mineral water. The dinner was settled at the hotel, and I bought the 688 set meal for two people who couldn't eat it and walked away.

My family members also cut my finger to help, causing blood to flow. I called the hotel and two managers came and apologized. Is it okay to just be sorry? What about the guests checking in later? A five-star hotel actually has facilities that hurt people? My finger was injured and I couldn’t wash my face or take a shower! Don't you want compensation for this?
All in all, very dissatisfied with their attitude and service.
Not recommended!

There is only a small plastic bench for children. Does the room fee of 3,000+ buy the scenery outside the window? Anyway, the facilities and services are not that good. The dinner buffet is not good either. I will not come here again.

Although the price is slightly more expensive than the city view room, the scenery outside the window can make you feel happy and bring good luck for the day. The facilities in the room are complete, and the service staff are on call, with a friendly attitude. The children in the Monchichi room like it very much. A few more words, I recommend the Chinese restaurant on the second floor for dinner, with a wide variety and reasonable prices.

So the price is quite beautiful, so it can only be a city view room😂
This hotel has been around for a long time, and the rooms are quite satisfactory, so I didn't take pictures!
In terms of view, his family is absolutely perfect! Almost no one can match it.
The elevator in the middle can go directly to the 21st floor, and it is also the only elevator that can reach the 21st floor.
The 21st floor was originally a bar. Since I went there in the morning, there was no one there, not even the staff. I don’t know if it will be open at night. It has a huge space and a panoramic view of the distant scenery.
Super quiet environment, bring a cup of tea or coffee, a book from the room, bask in the sun, read a book, enjoy the beautiful scenery, it is really comfortable!
The 21st floor is worth going up to see!

msg:Because the exterior design of the hotel is very distinctive, I have always wanted to find an opportunity to stay in and experience the internal facilities, and finally decided to experience it before my children start school. The indoor area of the big bed room in the hotel is not large, so I booked two rooms. The view from the upper floors is good. When booking, I saw that the room type notes are connecting rooms, so please ask the hotel staff to help open the connecting door when checking in, so that adults and children can play together and have their own independent space. The actual experience is good. Affected by the epidemic, the hotel and restaurants are not all open, but there are still a lot of guests checking in, and the waiting time for checking in is about 7 minutes. The service staff are polite and restrained. The quality of the hotel's bedding, toiletries, swimming pool and basic gym equipment is about the same as that of a hotel of this price category. The overall feeling is that the indoor features are not obvious, but the outdoor scenery is good, and it happened to be snowing when we checked in. It is still very artistic to walk along the dam and the lake in the heavy snow.

Let me tell you about the experience of check-in. The check-in procedure in the lobby is very convenient. There is no queue at around 3 pm on Saturday. The room is on the 16th floor, a city-view room with a good view, but the smell of smoke is relatively strong after opening the room, and the nozzle in the shower room leaks , the ground is relatively slippery, and there is only one non-slip mat in the shower room and bathtub. The electric curtains will automatically open at 8 o'clock in the morning, which is a bit scary! The breakfast is very rich, but I feel that there is nothing special about it. The overall feeling is that there is nothing wrong with it, and I hope that the details can be improved.

There are many varieties of breakfast, if you want to eat all of them, you have to stay in the hotel for a few more days. However, if the room is too hot, a humidifier should be installed. The hardware of this level of hotel is generally good, such as: swimming pool, gym, SPA, restaurant, coffee bar, etc. are all good. The only difference is to put a humidifier in the room, otherwise the room will be hot (windows) They are all fixed and cannot be opened).

msg:A very good accommodation experience! Compared with the bad experience of Yanqi Hotel where there were many situations and complaints due to anger, Kempinski staying on the first day of the new year gave me a better feeling than expected.
First of all, I would like to thank the little brother who checked in at the front desk for being very considerate. Because of the afternoon tea in the package, he took the initiative to delay the check-out time to 14:00!
Secondly, I would like to thank Riri Xin, the warm and beautiful lady in the lobby! During the chat, I heard that the child wanted to take a bath, and enthusiastically sent a disposable bath bag and drinking water to the room. The heart-warming service really touched me! Really felt at home! This touch is in stark contrast to the previous disappoin**ent with Yanqi Hotel!
The room is clean and tidy, with complete facilities and a large bathtub. I am a guest who cares about hygiene and details, and I am satisfied.
The steaks and platters at the brewery are also very delicious, a must-order every time you come!
The afternoon tea in the package is very amazing, but I would like to make a small suggestion~ the take-out packaging should be strengthened, because there is only one rope, and it lost its balance as soon as it was brought to the door of the hotel, and it was buckled on the ground, wasting such a beautiful afternoon Tea, I feel a little sad and regretful...
Great memories of the first day of the new year, thank you Sunrise Kempinski! I also wish Kempinski a happy new year and better and better!

The check-in staff will promote paid room upgrades and extra breakfast, saying that the breakfast included in the package only includes two, and the breakfast for children is also calculated as the package for adults. It is not like the service staff of a five-star hotel. I feel that the number of guests is crazy. In fact, the staff in the restaurant are okay, two children (8-10 years old) count as one adult. The staff of the swimming pool reminded the tenants that the end of the business was over half an hour before. It felt like driving them away, as if they were in a hurry to go home, and some facilities such as the sauna were closed before the closing time. Overall, this hotel will not go again.

msg:The room is very nice 👍
Hotel front desk service is very problematic
That day I saw a mother with two children arguing at the front desk
The reason is that the front desk said that the room was not ready yet, and asked my mother to wait for two hours
Empathy, if the front desk is more attentive, this kind of thing will not happen
The front desk is also very rude
I was very angry when I heard it

for the bad things that happened to me
After Ctrip has paid off the fee, the hotel checks in with a pre-authorization of 1000. This kind of pre-authorization is usually when checking out. If there is no other consumption, it will be refunded to the account immediately.
After checking out at 10 o'clock in the morning, the front desk (damn it is the front desk again) said that the account will be available within an hour
I just left the hotel
In the evening, I suddenly remembered this, checked the account, and there was no refund
I called the hotel to inquire about it, but the hotel hesitated and said that the refund would be processed immediately. I asked what would happen if I didn’t call
The front desk of the hotel (damn, it's the front desk again) said very bluntly, we check every day, why are you in a hurry.
Obviously the front desk forgot to deal with it, why are you still so rude
It can be refunded in a second, so why not deal with it when checking out
Obviously there is a problem with my service, why is the boss so rude
I'm not short of money
I'm going to criticize your hotel, the service is terrible
won't go again

msg:Finally, I stayed at the Sunrise Oriental Hotel, which I was thinking about, and experienced the city view room and the lake view room respectively, and felt the different scenery outside the windows on both sides of the hotel. The city view room can see the sunrise, the China Zun, and the beautiful night view of Huairou. There is a high-speed rail downstairs, but there is no noise impact. The hotel's sound insulation is very good. The lake view room is picturesque in front of the window, with a bird's eye view of Yanqi Lake and Yanqi Island. The autumn colors are colorful, the wild ducks fly freely, and the lake and mountains are like a natural painting. At night, the lights of Yanqi Pagoda and Yanqi Hotel flicker, and the lights of the water level observation corridor downstairs are placed on the lake like a big microphone. What is even more memorable is the autumn tour on Yanqi Island as a gift. The scenery on the road can be said to include all the beautiful colors and beauty of Beijing in autumn.
The service of the hotel is also very thoughtful, the staff training is in place, and there is no problem in all aspects. The fly in the oin**ent is that the restaurant is a bit cold and needs to wear a jacket for breakfast. The temperature of the bathroom in the swimming pool is low, the grade of the supplies in the bath box is a bit low, and some of the bath box signs are not clear.
All in all, this stay at Sunrise Oriental has left us with a very good memory!

There is a small episode, I have contacted Ctrip and the hotel two weeks before check-in, and there is no other requirement, just a high floor, ready children's bathrobes and slippers for children, don't let the day block. I arrived full of joy. The hotel seemed to have forgotten all the instructions that the hotel gave me. I was a little stuffed, but I didn’t want to spoil the mood. After trying to contact Ctrip, Ctrip solved it very quickly. The hotel changed my room, sent me a child's bathrobe and slippers, a welcome fruit plate and a red velvet birthday cake. In the middle, Ctrip and the hotel contacted several times to apologize. It is possible to be negligent when busy, but I appreciate it for trying to solve the problem. Boating on the lake, walking by the lake, and riding a bike with children are very comfortable. The hotel swimming pool also has a pool suitable for parents and children, and my security personnel are constantly checking it. The hotel kid's club is a little bit mean, it's too small. There are too many people eating breakfast in the hotel, and the quality of breakfast is still worse than that of Yansha's Kempinski. This epidemic can't go out, and everyone is gathering in the suburbs to travel. The whole is suitable for parents and children.

The hotel bedding is clean, the mattress is comfortable, the height of the pillow is suitable, and the comfort is perfect

The children's playground is too small, because we are a 5-year-old baby, and we didn't go in to play. Children like to play in the water. It is enough to have a swimming pool. There are three warm water pools by the swimming pool, so whether it is suitable for bringing a baby or not, we should take what we need. It feels good. The reviews for the dinner buffet are not optimistic, but after eating it, I was not disappointed. First of all, wine, wine and beer are provided. This is a lot that is not available in the buffet at this price. Needless to say, desserts are all online 👍🏻 Chinese, Japanese, Western seafood and other meals Very rich.

msg:The check-in and accommodation experience was good, because the birthday suite was upgraded for free, as well as the room decoration and cake gift, very attentive!
The room was quickly and tidy, and the mini bar had a lot of drinks, which was quite satisfying.
However, the general feeling is that the hotel guides are not enough. When parking, it is all on your own. From the underground parking lot, it is all self-service without guidance...
There are really too many people at breakfast, there is no seat, you have to find it by yourself, and there is no sign to announce whether the current seat is occupied, the food and the seat are all up for grabs... It may be a holiday, but it affects the overall experience

It's just that there are too many people during the holiday, and the weather is bad, so the overall feeling is discounted. In addition, the bed was too soft, and I had a backache when I slept. From time to time, the train would pass by outside the window. There was some noise. The rest environment was the most lacking part this time. Also, is the parking lot accessible to outsiders? Hard to find a parking space when going.

msg:First of all, the score of the review is based on the enthusiasm and service of the waiters. The facilities and surrounding environment of the hotel are currently only average, especially when the dam is under repair and cannot be passed.
Staying with the elderly and children, in my personal opinion, the hotel is more suitable for meetings. Speaking of parent-child, it cannot be said that it is completely unacceptable, but it is more suitable for young children, especially the facilities in the parent-child themed room. In addition, there is a flaw, which of course represents my personal opinion, because the windows are all dead windows and cannot be opened, so I don't think it is suitable for parents and children. It is defined that parents and children can at least open the windows to let in natural air. Besides, the kidsclub, just a small area inside the B1 floor, can it be called a kidsclub? The definition of parent-child in this season is at least associated with opening the windows, the house is full of sunshine, the air is fresh, and the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming. What can Kempinski satisfy? I think the fairy tale tree house in Yunfeng Mountain can be regarded as a real parent-child.
Besides, two days before the check-in, I had a menstrual period precursor, so I chose to cancel the trip, but I was rejected when I applied again, and I was rejected again through Ctrip. Therefore, although Saturday and Sunday are the first day of the menstrual period and The next day I was particularly inconvenient, so I came here in order not to waste the hotel fee, which is not cheap. Although there are many hotels that can only be canceled within half an hour after booking, and cannot be canceled after the timeout, most of the time, if guests encounter special circumstances, the hotel will take the initiative to understand the situation and give understanding and cancel, but Kempins Ji is such a big five-star hotel, but he refused directly without asking why. Moreover, when the facilities for the maintenance of the surrounding dams are not complete, how do you have the confidence to be "uncancellable"? Is it a commercial pricing model similar to railway stations and some tourist attractions? One-off sale, don't expect repeat customers?
Finally, I would like to emphasize again that the attitude of all the waiters is very enthusiastic and the response is very fast. This is the only way to get points, not the hardware and environment of the hotel. If you want to bring children to play, at least in this season, it is better not to choose this place. At least until summer, the related water projects in Yanqi Lake Scenic Area next to it can make up for the lack of hotels.

Going out from the third-floor platform in the evening is the dam. It is very pleasant to ride a bicycle or walk.

The hotel has three restaurants, the first floor is a bar, the second floor is a Chinese restaurant and a western restaurant. The Chinese restaurant is mainly Cantonese cuisine. It is very comfortable to eat a bowl of wonton noodles at night.

msg:The two elders are both around 90 years old. Although they are still in good health, they want to take them on a trip, but they have been uneasy because they are worried about their inconvenience. Living in the Sunrise East was really prescient. First of all, we chose the honorable sea view room, with two beds facing a lake view, the beauty is indescribable. For elderly people with limited mobility, the hotel provides free wheelchairs. The elderly are used to having meals after six o'clock in the morning, and the hotel's self-service is also open very early. Presumably many staff have to light up the lights to prepare meals. On the third floor of the hotel, there is Lakeside Avenue. Not far from the left and right, there is a pier with battery boats and a cruise ship pier with a view around the lake. In particular, the hotel can go to Yanqi Island and climb the Yanqi Pagoda for the record. So, rowing, taking a cruise, visiting the island, climbing the tower, yes, the old man even soaked in the hot spring. Special thanks to the two male staff in charge of the swimming pool, the lifeguard and a master at the entrance, who are very considerate and meticulous. And Li Shimeng, the handsome guy at the front desk, is even more responsive. At first, we were not sure whether the old man would have the physical strength to climb the tower, so we failed to buy tickets in advance. Later, we found Xiao Li, who took the trouble to communicate with him several times to satisfy the old man's wish to climb the tower. I would like to express my sincere thanks here.

msg:The epidemic has come to an end, and while the children are not on summer vacation, they can find a time to stay on a weekday. There are also several high-end hotels around Yanqi Lake. I chose Sunrise East for the Kempinski brand. My theory is that the hotels under the International Hotel Management Group have a strict set of standards in quality control and service, and the assessment is also relatively strict, so they will not step on the pit under normal circumstances. Sure enough, I was not disappointed. Sunrise Oriental maintained a high standard from service attitude to hardware facilities, as well as restaurant dishes, which made our stay very comfortable. The lake view room we stayed in has a very good view. The open lake is outside the window. When we checked in, we gave a Wenchuang ice cream, which is made from Haagen-Dazs ingredients, very delicious. The breakfast was quite satisfactory, the only disappoin**ent was that no salmon was found. Finally, I have to give a thumbs up to the chopped pepper fish head in the Chinese restaurant. The fish is very fresh. For a foodie, his chopped pepper fish head can be ranked in the top five even if it is on the public comment list. Another purpose of our stay in the hotel is to swim. The swimming pool of Sunrise Oriental is very professional and the water quality is very good, but the water temperature is too low, and I dared not go down after trying several times. Maybe the professional swimming pool is low temperature. Fortunately, the surfing massage pool is warm and very comfortable. There is also a children's pool, which is expected to be very lively during the summer vacation. The surrounding area of the hotel is very quiet and the air is fresh. If APEC can choose to hold its meeting here, it is definitely not wrong. A very good experience, I will choose Sunrise Oriental next time!

The hotel is located in Yanqi Lake with mountains and water, and the hotel's management and service are excellent. First of all, the front desk and concierge services are in place. We have to pay to upgrade the lake view room and add an extra bed. The front desk proactively recommends suitable room types, and is also very enthusiastic and proactive in delivering luggage; the housekeeping service is also good, we hope for a harder pillow, soon It was delivered; the restaurant waiter was courteous and the meal was a pleasure. To sum up a few points: First, choose a high-rise lake view room, which can not only overlook Yanqi Lake, but also the Great Wall. Second, it is suitable for bringing the elderly to play, and various facilities and services can be satisfied in the hotel. We took a 90-year-old man to stay for 2 nights. The food was suitable for our taste. We took a walk on the dam nearby or rented a 4-wheeler to ride around. We drove to Yanqi Island to take pictures in the distance. The old man was very satisfied. Third, pay attention to the activities on Ctrip or the hotel's official website, and you can get more benefits. Some room types offer afternoon tea, fruit plate, minibar, and it is said that group meals are also available. All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay. The good customer experience is due to the good service of the hotel, and the good service is attributed to the good management. I hope the hotel can continue to be as always, and will come here in the future and recommend it to friends.

There are also many amu*****t projects in Yanqi Lake, which enriches the activities of staying in this hotel. The day I stayed was also in time for the opening of the Beijing Film Festival. Many celebrities also lived here. There were many people, but the hotel was well-organized, which was commendable. On the downside, I think the water in the pool is relatively cold, so you need to be mentally prepared for small children. The breakfast is ok, the upper-middle class.

msg:1) The hygiene is extremely poor. I saw this kind of worm eating dirty things in the room, not only in the bathroom, but also in the room. See the diagram below. Even a clean three-star hotel would not be so dirty.
2) The service is very poor. I bought an afternoon tea in the lobby and didn't deliver it to the room. We waited there for more than ten minutes before it was ready and brought it by ourselves. Waited 20 minutes for check-in, the waiter didn't even say sorry for the long wait or even a word.
3) The management is extremely poor, the breakfast variety is very small, and there is no milk mixed with coffee on the table. Need to go to another place to make milk by yourself. No one guides you to the right seat either. You can only drive to the right at the exit, but not to the left. You have to go through a tunnel before you can make a U-turn. At the entrance, it can be left or right.
4) The environment is poor. It is said to be next to the lake. In fact, the road from the 3rd floor is a public road. There are many cars. It is impossible to walk around the lake along this road. The hotel itself is actually quite small.
5) The equipment is also poor. There are only 3 elevators in the hotel, and each time you wait for half a day. The table in the room is outdated. The window socket is on one side and not on the other.
It is a 3,000 yuan B&B hotel.

Taking pictures and videos is just a record of daily life, and it is also a public swimming pool. Light, Gubei Water Town, Tianjin Westin, Sanya Pullman, Fairmont, and many other hotels, none of them were told not to take pictures. This is the first time. Maybe the hotel has its own rules, but the laws and regulations are nothing more than human feelings. I am just a parent who takes my two children to play, taking pictures and videos of the children. If it is really strict, then why can mobile phones be brought in and can be photographed? This is different from wearing a mask but not wearing it properly. It is too formalistic. I hope the hotel can consider this issue. Why is it only Kempins? You can't take pictures with a camera in the swimming pool

msg:The long-favored hotel is the hotel, and I will take the children to check in during the holiday. We booked a parent-child room, but when we arrived there were only rooms on the lowest floor. Although it was a lake view room, after all, the floor was low, and the room was too biased, so the view was not good. It is recommended that friends with children do not book parent-child rooms. A double bed is good, so you can choose the floor 🤔
The restaurant is quite satisfactory. We have breakfast in the western restaurant. There are not many options.
But after all, it is a tourist attraction. There are many places to play around. We checked in Shengquan Mountain, Yanqi Lake, and Qinglong Gorge in two and a half days. The children had a great time, and the grilled fish in any nearby shop is delicious. Red trout Enjoy it 🐟

It's just that the water depth of a swimming pool is too deep, and the water is too shallow. The class does not allow tourists to swim casually. Anyway, the depth of the water is not too lazy to play the theory. Just find a place to make a bubble. The children's club is not suitable for younger children.

msg:I came to Yanqi Huzhou to play for two days. I chose to stay in Dongfang Sunrise Kempinski. The location of the hotel is very good. It only takes an hour to drive from home. This should be regarded as one of the best hotels around Yanqi Lake. We I booked two suites for two nights. After I arrived, I added a little money to one set and upgraded it directly to a suite. The space is large and all kinds of facilities are readily available. One set was upgraded to a lake view room with beautiful scenery outside the window.

There are various entertainment facilities on the ba*****t floor of the hotel, such as swimming, various claw machines in the children's paradise, etc. There are also many parking spaces in the parking lot.

The hotel is on the edge of Yanqi Lake. There are many kinds of food around, mainly fish.

If you come to Yanqi Lake to play, if you are not very sensitive to price and have high requirements for the quality of hotel accommodation, there is nothing wrong with choosing this place.

There are huge floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and the children tirelessly lie on the windows to see the cars coming and going in and out of the tunnel, as well as the long trains. The third floor of the hotel is the dam. At the dam, there is a small train with a rocking cow and a rocking horse that walks around the lake at night, and there is a cruise ship nearby that can take a night tour of Yanqi Lake. What needs to be improved is the afternoon tea, a bunch of unsellable snacks, extremely unpalatable, and the children can't eat a single one. The breakfast is actually average, there are too few varieties of snacks, just some bread. In the evening, there is a ** takeaway, and there are a few crayfish and skewers that can be delivered.

msg:Because of the reason of taking children, I have stayed in five-star hotels for all these years. Sunrise Oriental really needs to improve the standard in many aspects. I really can only give three stars.
First of all, the facilities really need to be upgraded. The door of the room is very heavy to open but the automatic door closing is very light, and there is no alarm when the door is not closed;
Secondly, the service is really off the chain. I bought breakfast for three days on the first day I arrived at the hotel. As a result, I have to check the account every morning when I eat. I can still ask at our table this morning. Your breakfast service is not accountable. Is it right?
The third is hygiene. I'm really convinced. If you don't call, no one will come to change your towel and bath towel. When you come to change, all the floor towel, towels and bath towel are folded and placed on the edge of the bathtub for me. This is waiting. What am I doing? Am I here to work with the elderly and children?
Fourth, I was most angry. I bought a coupon for a brewery. Before I bought it, I saw that the rules said that it could not be used on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, but the unavailable dates given below happened to not include July and August. I even called first to ask. Confirmed by the hotel and told me that it can be used without a date limit. As a result, when I checked out, it said that it could not be used on Saturdays and Sundays, and I refunded it on the spot. It's not about money, so I wonder if you don't need pre-job training in such a hotel? One person and one trumpet, each playing its own tune?
Also, at breakfast, I asked the check-in attendant if the hotel organized nucleic acid testing? Tell me that it is available on the first floor of the hotel at one o'clock in the afternoon. As a result, I asked the front desk again at noon and told me that it was for hotel staff, not customers. I really huh, just ask a nucleic acid and I can get two results. It turns out that I not only have to clean up the bath towels, but I also care about the nucleic acid of our hotel staff. I don’t even care about asking the customer’s own nucleic acid. How to do it!
This is a five-star hotel, a little too panic! Fortunately, it won't come next time

The lake view room of the hotel is facing Yanqi Lake, and you can see Yanqi Tower, Yanqi Island, Guanhu Pavilion and other scenery. The German food in the hotel's beer house tastes very good, and the Chinese food in the Pandan Pavilion is Cantonese cuisine, the taste is not outstanding, and it is quite satisfactory. There are many kinds of breakfast, but unfortunately the characteristics are insufficient. The hotel service is still in place, the service staff will take the initiative to say hello, and the service awareness is relatively strong. The pillows in the room were a little too soft, so I asked the room for buckwheat pillows, but they were all sent out.

msg:The architecture of Sunrise Oriental is very characteristic, the swimming pool is big enough, the rooms are quite satisfactory, and the underground garage is also very convenient. It's just a lack of greenery, and there are only trails along the lake for walking. However, Kempinski is a group hotel, and you can visit Yanqi Island for free. The scenery here is different. It is green, quiet and elegant, and it is unique. And you can play for half a day.

msg:The package purchased on Ctrip, plus 600, was upgraded to a lake view room, but the room smelled musty, there was no desk lamp and floor lamp, and the pool was blocked. The facilities are a bit old, the glass is stained, the room was changed after coordination, and the service response was slow. Breakfast 238 felt not worth it. For meals, you can go to the surrounding Internet celebrity restaurants, the road behind can lead to Yanxi Lake, the hotel can swim, Yanxi Lake is a landmark building, the transportation is convenient for self-driving, and there is free parking.

msg:Overall satisfaction, check-in at the front desk is very efficient, it is recommended to charge for an upgrade, and the price is not expensive, so I agree. Because one room has not been cleaned out, after communication, a slightly larger twin room was upgraded. The overall feeling of the lake view room is good. Because of the Yanqi Hotel that I stayed at the night before, there is still a slight difference in experience. It is very convenient to go directly to the dam on the third floor, and the scenery is also good, but because there are many people outside the hotel, it seems more chaotic . The food in the brewery in the hotel is acceptable, not bad or bad. The bread before the meal is too mini, not like the style of German food. A tandem bike costs 100 an hour, which is slightly more expensive. I want to complain: Since it is a landscape hotel, is the glass on the key FIT floor arranged to be wiped? It affects the quality of the photo.

msg:【Suggest】
1. Small bottles of home-brewed beer are provided in the guest rooms for guests to enjoy for free. Not to mention that guests must feel good in summer, it can directly drive the business of staying in the brewery. After all, there are not many options for leisure around at night, and only German drinks are left. Craft beer, enjoy this advantage of the hotel's service, and can also provide canned beer for takeaway.
2. Add German sausages to breakfast

Service: Continuing the high quality of Kaibin, caring and attentive, but every time the front desk sees two young ladies, it takes a long time to wait for a troublesome guest. . . . . . . The service ladies and sisters in the restaurant are responsive and have excellent eyesight. There is also a little brother who brings a bread basket to deliver the horns, which is really an irresistible and considerate service. I would also like to say that the security guard at the door will answer any questions and give you a detailed introduction to the situation around Yanxi Lake. Please give the security guard a raise.
Guest room: It is recommended to choose a lake view room, facing Yanqi Lake, it is very pleasant to watch the lake view in the room with air-conditioning in the summer. The room is spacious and not crowded, and the facilities are complete. Although it cannot be luxurious, it is simple and sanitary, and meets all needs. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and there is a sliding door leading to the bedroom to isolate the sink and bathtub. Toiletries are standard for Kempin.

Catering: The breakfast is on the 2nd floor of the hotel. As a German hotel, I am a little disappointed that there are no rich German sausages in the breakfast. The German bread baking is also a little deserted, maybe the Chinese stomach is not suitable. The hotel lobby has a cold drink cake area and a brewery. You can try the cultural and creative ice cream, and the recipe of Haagen-Dazs should taste good. For cakes, because many raw materials cannot be imported during the epidemic, not every model is available.

Recreation: Make an appoin**ent in advance during the outbreak of the swimming pool. There are not many people in the pool. The swimming pool is clean and tidy, divided into swimming lanes and the water depth is 1.5. There are professional lifeguards on the side. There are also two massage pools and a sauna room. There are three compar**ents in the shower area. The area after the bath is also relatively spacious. The matching hair dryer, body lotion, cotton swabs, etc. are super complete.
Entertainment: You can run and ride along Yanqi Lake in the morning. At night, you can watch the night scene around the lake. At present, the plank road around the lake is temporarily closed, and you can only enjoy yourself in the hotel.
Transportation: Landmark buildings are easy to find, but public transportation is still not enough, self-driving is the best. When you get off the train, you can either take a bus, take a taxi or ride a shared bicycle, but when you get to the hotel, you can't park, you can only stop abruptly.

Finally, I would like to thank Daniel, the foreign manager of the hotel, for his careful arrangement😄😄😄

msg:I scored 98 points, very satisfied! Whether it is service, environment, location, it is a five-star luxury hotel! First of all, I am most satisfied with the service and location. It is close to the Yanqi Lake Dam. From the third-floor platform of the hotel, you can go directly to the lake, where you can rent bicycles. Then I am very satisfied with the swimming pool of the hotel. It is 1.5 meters deep and 25 meters long. It can be used for exercise. The water temperature is the same as that of a conventional swimming pool. In addition to the swimming pool, there is also a children's pool and a hot spring pool for adults, with massage chairs, which are very comfortable! The room is fully furnished and new, and the shower is great! Great water pressure! The water temperature is also stable! We choose the day we travel, there is no official holiday yet, and there are not many people there! Unlike the hotel where I played last summer vacation, there was no place to sit for breakfast. The only fly in the oin**ent is that there is no long sofa in the room. The three of us have a big bed and it is still a little uncomfortable. There is only one quilt. The room fee this time is 2088. I heard that there is a preferential price on 6.18, half price will do, and you still have to do your homework in advance.
Last but not least, thanks to the guy at the front desk on the day we checked in, he upgraded us to a lake view room for free! Let's check in before 12! thank you very much!

I chose Sunrise Oriental Kempinski Hotel Huairou, and the physical examination was very good. First of all, it is very close to Beijing. The hotel facilities are very comfortable and the environment is beautiful. Especially the shape of the hotel is very characteristic. The sunrise is in the east, and the scenery is very beautiful in the morning and evening. The air by the lake is fresh and comfortable. We live on the 15th floor, and the waiters are warm, conscientious and amiable. The breakfast is rich, the service in the Chinese restaurant is also very good, and you can get free ice cream with the logo of Haagen-Dazs Hotel. The staff are dedicated and have a good attitude. It would be even better if we could organize nucleic acid testing for the guests staying.

Arrived at the hotel around 1:30 pm. Due to the epidemic prevention and control, the check-in time is slightly longer. It is understandable that you need to provide your health code, itinerary code, and sign a letter of commi**ent. The front desk staff will take the initiative to ask whether to drive, and if so, they will give a parking voucher and no charge.
The scenery of the lake view room is really amazing. Picture 1 is taken from the room. The scenery of Yanxi Lake has a panoramic view🥰.
Going out from the third floor is the trail around the lake. Turn right and take a few steps to see the car rental point. There are many kinds of bicycles for rent. Older children can also ride their favorite bicycles here. They can't be too fast and pay attention to safety. If it is too hot outside, you can go back to the hotel, there is a kids club and swimming pool. The children's club should be the mini version, it feels as big as two rooms 😂 slides, ocean balls, trampolines, large blocks, suitable for smaller children. Then there is the swimming pool. There are two pools suitable for children. They are different in depth and the water temperature is suitable. It feels like a hot spring pool. There are no slides or the like, just for children to play.
The food in the Chinese restaurant is good, you need to make a reservation, just call in advance. The breakfast is very rich, all kinds of food, drinks and fruits are available, which is very good.

The hotel is newer than I thought, and the room is bigger. In the past two years, due to the epidemic, I have been unable to travel, and I have basically stayed in representative hotels in Beijing. The area of this standard room can be regarded as the top three.
There are many kinds of breakfast, which can be said to take care of various tastes.
At 1:40 in the morning, the phone in the room rang, the call was connected, and the other party hung up. The hotel should understand why. Service satisfaction dropped one star.

msg:The room is very comfortable, the swimming pool is very considerate and divided into constant temperature for children and slightly cooler water for adults! The hotel is not that big, but it is better than the location. It is next to the lake and dam. Children can ride, ride on a small rocker, and row a boat. The hotel has a new income-generating project, and tourists also have a happy parent-child experience. Very good, highly recommended ! The kids are clamoring for an extra two days!

msg:🍃Environment: Sunrise East is a special place to get a piece of Yanqi Hunan. I came here to hide from the leisure of Beijing. It is very quiet here. Because there are basically no cars on the road by the lake to the north of the bayonet, there are many people walking here in the evening. There is a ferry cruise terminal on the west side of the dam, and there is a pedal boat terminal on the east side of the road downstairs. Pedal boats can only paddle in this small area of water visible to the eye, not the entire lake. The pier to the west is Big Boat Lord Lake. In the east of the building, close to the south of the hotel's outer road, there is a four-person double-row bicycle rental, and there is also a four-person single-row bicycle rental at the entrance of the lobby. The dam guardrail is short, and it is not recommended for children to ride any single or two-wheeled bicycles by themselves!
Eat: Special mention to eat, because under the management of Kempin, you can drink German beer here. If you can't go to Germany, you can't go to Qingdao. This is the best alternative to drinking beer. You can also drive to a ditch to find something to eat.
🧹 Hygiene: clean, mattress comfortable
🔔Service: Service enthusiasm.
Others: The swimming pool of the hotel is a large pool of 1.5 meters. The water temperature is suitable for swimming but not for play. There is a small pool with warm water for children to play with.

During the epidemic, you can only dine in the room, but it does not affect the quality of brunch, especially the breakfast has 3 different flavor sets, which are nutritionally matched. Add to taste. It is also during the epidemic, the service is particularly good. Especially the front desk, the beautiful manager Wu with big eyes, solves the problem in time when the intern at the front desk makes a mistake in checking in the room. Also presented with a cheesecake from Kempinski. And very patient to answer our questions. Kempinski's desserts have always been very famous. Many of the bakeries and 🍰 of Kempinski Bakery in Sanhuan Yansha are delicious, sweet but not greasy. When you come to Kempinski, you must eat their cakes and ice cream, otherwise it will be a pity. Will come again. Thank you Manager Wu for taking care of us during our stay.

The service staff is kind, especially thanks to the customer service center linda, the family forgot the hat in the room, linda contacted us and delivered the hat to home.

1. Parking: Free, you can park on the ground and underground, and it is quite full on weekends. There are two or three charging piles on the ground.

2. Room: Twin room, average size, not big or small, lake view room with first-class view, highly recommended, especially at night, looking at the night view of lights, it is really beautiful.

3. Service: I am quite satisfied, most of the waiters are friendly and comfortable. Reservation requirements are as far as possible to be satisfied, a little moved.

4. Catering: The hotel has buffet, Chinese and Western food, all of which taste quite satisfactory and can meet basic needs.

There are some areas for improvement:
1. Check in takes a long time
2. The parent-child activities only saw the Easter egg painting in the cafeteria. There is a small children's club, which can be enriched.
3. The hotel does not have the aroma of a five-star hotel

Overall a good hotel.

Whether the hotel can directly enter Yanqi Lake Park for free, it is best to explain it when booking the hotel, so that guests can park their cars at the hotel and avoid the trouble of many cars in the park. Also, the hotel charges a day's accommodation fee for 24 hours, right? How come the check-in time is 15:00 pm and the check-out time is 12:00 noon? The environment of the hotel is really good.

The hotel is in a great location, right on the dam, with bikes and walks just outside the door. The food is delicious, especially the fish and chips, and the burgers are very cute. It is highly recommended for children to try it. Drinks in the small refrigerator are provided free of charge, and the handwritten cards are very thoughtful. The bed is two meters, and a family of three sleeps no problem. The service staff are all courteous, and during breakfast, the service staff sent a small card to remind the holiday that there are many people and check out at different peak times. ps: Children in elementary school must bring their own bicycles, because the hotel does not have a car suitable for such a big baby. The car rental spots outside the hotel are so popular at Qingming, I can't wait to return the car.

You can rent a variety of bicycles for double or double rows to play along the lake. The sightseeing bus station is not far away, you can take it by scanning the code on WeChat.
The hotel service is very good, all kinds of needs are quickly responded to, and the room attendant is quick to ask for anything. Drinks and snacks in the room are free and replenished every day. What is a bit incomprehensible is that the room attendant has any indicators for cleaning the room? If I don't turn on Do Not Disturb, I can knock on the door several times in the morning and ask for it to be cleaned as soon as possible. I feel very speechless.
In terms of food and beverages, I don't have to wait in line for breakfast, but the food is really average.
The western restaurant in the hotel has not been eaten. There is only one Chinese restaurant and the capacity is limited. You must book in advance, otherwise there will be no seats for you. But the food quality is good. Room delivery Chinese dishes are few, but delivered quickly.
In general, the hotel environment and service are good, and the food and beverage needs to be strengthened.

2. The environment, the five-star hotel room is small, and I stayed in three hotels during the 11th November. The most expensive one is more than 3,000 a night, which is not as comfortable as more than 2,000 a night.
3. Service, after booking on Ctrip, call to confirm as soon as possible, and ask the front desk for a crib. The child is 15 months old, arrives at the hotel, checks in, and confirms with the front desk again. The front desk says that they will greet the room, and then bring I went to my child to go shopping and eat, but I went back to the room at night. There was no crib, but the child was hungry and sleepy. We took a bath and coaxed him to sleep. In one position, I am afraid that I will press the child, and I will have to look at it before I fall asleep. I am afraid that the child will climb down and fall off the bed, and I have not slept well all night.
4. Many platforms say that this is a parent-child hotel, but I don’t quite understand it. The parent-child paradise of this five-star hotel is not as big as a parent-child restaurant, and it is not very friendly to young children. The child is on his own.

It takes 5 minutes to drive to Yanqi Lake, the parking fee is 20, walk, walk from the dam behind the hotel to the right, walk while watching the scenery, pass the "Judges College", it is not far, about 15 minutes. The hotel's German food, elbow, roasted venison, salad, and beer are all good. The per capita is about 100-150. There are many kinds in the morning. Our extra bed 520 also includes breakfast.

msg:Purely personal opinion: the hotel is quite average in other aspects except for the eye-catching architectural appearance. There are few restaurants, the meals are average, the variety is small, and the taste is low. There is a lot of dust in the room and the sanitation is not good. I wiped it with wet wipes and alcohol wipes. The room has no windows to open, and living in it is rather suffocating. The sound insulation effect is poor, and the voice of the corridor can be heard very clearly. It is better for those who mind and those who are asking for more of the hotel to stay away. Moreover, the hotel itself has no commodity depar**ent, and there are no supermarkets and canteens around, which is inconvenient for basic needs.

msg:Generally speaking, it's still very good. I heard that we are here to celebrate the baby's first birthday. He took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type, arranged the room and sent a red velvet cake. Both the room and public facilities are clean. The water in the swimming pool is also very good [strong] and not many people. The only downside is that the air in the room has a very light smell, and I don't usually feel that my throat is still very sore after sleeping all night. I don't know if it is because of the air duct of the central air conditioner or because the smell of the disinfectant did not spread out during the epidemic (the windows could not be opened).
In addition, the night view of lakes and mountains that I have been thinking about is gone. It is said that it will not be opened again after the National Day, which is a pity.
Generally speaking, if you don't have to see the lake view in the room, you can choose the city view room, and some floors have executive lounges where you can see the lake view.
Overall it's great! The family is very happy!

Of course, the price of this hotel is relatively high among five-star hotels, and it is ok for a short-stay experience.

Let’s talk about the feeling of sunrise in the east: there is nothing to say about the landscape, it is very beautiful to fall asleep with the scenery. The hotel customer service is more attentive, and will make a special call the day before check-in to confirm the exact check-in time and preferences. On the day of check-in, everything needed was in place at the first time. The food in the restaurant tastes very good and the quantity is very large. Since there is no reservation in advance, and I am too lazy to wait for a table, I did not check in the beer house, and the dinner is solved in the Chinese restaurant. The family of three did not finish the three dishes. Every dish I ordered tasted very good, and the ingredients were sufficient, unlike some of the "Chinese Food Day" restaurants that everyone is doing in diss recently. The dining environment is very good and the waiters are very discerning. The swimming pool has a standard swimming pool suitable for fitness and a hot water pool suitable for children to play in the water. It is clean and has few people, which is very nice

I was urged to check out after 11:00. I have been to many hotels and B&Bs, and it was the first time I was urged to check out. I didn't give an ice cream coupon when I checked in, and said that if it wasn't for the child, I really didn't want to talk nonsense. The beer house used to cooperate with Prana, but it is no longer, but the price is still that price, just selling dog meat. It can be said that the service is the decoration, and I will not go there again in the future.

msg:The price/performance ratio is too low, not recommended. The only reason I give 1 point is because I took the initiative to upgrade the city view room to a city view suite. In fact, it is useless to only have a larger area, but it is also worthy of thanks for the active upgrade. The rest have too many dissatisfactions:
First, the smell of the wardrobe or bedside table in the room was too great, and I couldn’t open the window. I had a headache and couldn’t sleep because of the smoke. Finally, I lay down on the sofa in the outside hall for half the night, and barely slept. The cabinets in the hall smelled relatively smaller. I can’t sleep at night and I still think, if I didn’t upgrade the living room, I would have to be forced to go to the main road. I regret it so much! Therefore, friends with children must consider this issue, health is too important.
Second, afternoon tea, it took 40 minutes to get in, and the drinks took nearly half an hour to be brought out. The watermelon in the afternoon tea is tasteless, and the dragon fruit, kiwi fruit, strawberry, and pineapple are all sour and cannot be eaten. The two elderly people who only eat afternoon tea and can't stay in the store said that the value is 298, which is really not worth it. It only has a good-looking appearance.
Third, the quality of the breakfast does not match the grade advertised by the hotel. The milk is the same as adding water. The beef sausage and saury are very fishy, and the overall is not delicate. It is no problem to eat enough.
Fourth, the sanitation of the swimming pool is average. Every sofa in it for rest has a torn cloth, and there is a dead cockroach on the lounge chair (about the third deck chair on the side of the warm pool, July 25th). I shouldn’t be the only one who saw it on the afternoon of July 25), I went to the swimming pool three times on the afternoon of July 25, the evening and the morning of July 26. I have never seen cleaning and patrolling in the locker room, only bath towels.
Fifth, the AD sports shorts that my son in the third year of junior high bought and had just worn for less than two days were lost in the locker room. This is the most affecting mood. There was no such thing, and I ignored the previous dissatisfaction. I usually buy it. Things, etc. I am too lazy to evaluate, let alone bad reviews. The child said that the clothes were put in the locker. Of course, I did not rule out that he might have put it on the stool and not locked it. It may have been because of the negligence of the child, and it is understandable to think that it was lost, but I am not satisfied with the handling of the hotel. The little brother on duty asked me to go back to my room and wait for the phone call, but there was no reply at all after waiting for a long time. I went downstairs and asked, the person in charge of the swimming pool left me a phone number and said that if I found it, send it to me, but can't find it? I didn't say it too clearly, just said to contact me again, will you really contact me? If I expressed doubts, I just sent me away. Of course, I didn't report any hope. When I went to the front desk to check out, I mentioned this to the front desk (not angry, just asking if there is a solution to this situation), the male front desk (only one male front desk) replied to me that I lost my clothes It's not their fault, if I'm not satisfied, I'll call the police myself. What is this nonsense? In order not to continue to affect my mood and not want to waste my time, I turned my head and left. It's not a matter of how much money, and I've always said that it's not too expensive, but I'm speechless with the hotel's attitude. First of all, you are not fully sure that the clothes are placed on the stool because of your negligence. I have encountered the lock failure of the cabinet once the day before the women's change. Second, even if it is the child's negligence, then the hotel has no responsibility at all. Yet? Not only in-house guests come to the swimming pool, but also casual staff who sign up for swimming lessons, as well as service staff (not necessarily high quality), there is no one on duty in the locker room, and management is not without problems! In short, the male front desk said that the hotel is not responsible, and you will call the police if you can't, which is too annoying! The hotel is not responsible for this, I absolutely do not agree. I can afford to live in a hotel of more than 2,000 yuan, and I am not short of more than 100 yuan for shorts. The main child was unhappy that the shorts he just bought were stolen, he went back to his room in a daze in his swimming trunks, and the hotel did not handle it properly, plus other dissatisfactions, so I have to make this comment based on facts. The hotel experience in the surrounding suburbs of about 1000 is much better, just to check the appearance of the building in the east of the sunrise, you don't have to live here!

msg:Hygiene: So-so
Transportation: The parking spaces are extremely poor, and it is difficult to find parking spaces. All of them are exposed to the sun. There are three or four parking spaces under the corridor, and there are even hotel staff who occupy the space with tricycles.
Environment: You can still say the past, pass it
Service: super poor.
First of all, when entering and leaving the hotel, the security guard kept shouting to wear a mask. The hotel is a foreign-related hotel, and he turned a blind eye to foreigners who did not wear masks.
Check out at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, lock the room card at 1:30, you can't take the elevator, you have to swipe someone else's card to go downstairs to unlock, the front desk keeps urging you, it's 2 o'clock, you have to check out quickly, The attitude is so bad and totally incompatible with a 5 star hotel.
Breakfast is even more bizarre. You need to wear a mask throughout the meal, otherwise there will be staff with masks to follow you, and you will still turn a blind eye if you don't wear them.
There is an item that needs to be sent by express, but the service cannot be provided. A simple sentence can be dismissed, which is even worse than the service of a fast hotel.

The whole room is also very clean, and the linen is also exceptionally clean. At that time, some people said that there was a problem with the bath towels, so I paid special attention to my room and it was exceptionally clean. The breakfast is also very good. The whole hotel still feels pretty good to me, it's a five-star. But the only drawback is that the media and electronic equipment in the room is relatively outdated, and we look forward to innovation. In addition, if you choose tea for breakfast, there is no milk. Generally, if you choose tea or coffee in five-star hotels, you will have milk.
But overall, I give Kaibin a high evaluation, it is worth visiting again ❤️

It can score 95 points in hotels with the same conditions. above. It can be seen that employees have undergone rigorous training, and their business abilities have passed the test. It may be affected by the epidemic, and I feel that the operating costs are not as good as before. The lobby on the first floor during lunch has a faint smell of grease, unlike the Kempin in the city that has perfume to cover it. In addition, if you are not familiar with Kempinski, you will not be able to discover the advantages of Kempinski’s bakery during your stay. I sincerely hope that you can taste the same taste as in the city next time by Yanqi Lake! In addition, do not know whether the facilities of the children's club are regularly disinfected? Are there any measures for the "hardest-hit areas" such as ocean balls and building blocks?

The overall feeling is worthy of the name of Kempinski, and it is more suitable for visiting Yanqi Lake in the spring and autumn. After all, this season has a lot of wind on the trail around the lake. Compared with five-star hotels in other tourist cities, the hotel has slightly more amu*****t facilities. With less, the choice of meals is hoped to be more abundant, and the quality is not the quantity.

🅿️Parking: The hotel will give you a car permit when you check in, and you can enter the hotel repeatedly; you can also park on Yanqi Island.
🏨Settings: The hardware is very good, and the bathroom Kele. The gym and swimming pool are on the B1 floor. Although the gym is not big, its lifefitness is the same as my gym [naughty]; the swimming pool has a standard swimming path.
🪟Room: I booked two lake-view rooms and arranged for us two interconnected rooms at the end of the aisle (there is a door in the room that can be opened with a key), and we called the front desk ten minutes after we arrived to ask for advice, I said OK, the service is good. Because I have a colleague staying in a hotel, I can’t live in a corner room🤦🏻‍♀️
🌅Room view: The lake view is excellent and refreshing. The first day of our stay was cloudy, and the second day was clear. I experienced the romance of distant mountains, misty clouds and misty lakes, and the comfort of the blue sky and the shadows of the lake reflecting the tower.
⛩Hotel play: The hotel can rent bicycles, although 50/hour is not cheap, but the bicycles are momentum; there are also bicycles for rent out of the hotel, there are bicycles for four people in the family, and there are also single mountain bikes. I think the area around Yanqi Lake is too suitable for cycling 🚴‍♀️ Those who like cycling are blessed! You can find the cycling route by searching for it on Keep. In short, Yanqi Hunan Road and Fanqi Road are both refreshing and refreshing. The greenery is super good, and the super oxygen bar is reluctant to go! I have a knee injury [disappointed] so I regret not renting a mountain bike this time. I will go to the second brush when my knee is healed and I have a chance [呲牙]
🫕Hotel restaurant: strongly praised [强] five-star recommendation [爱心] We did not eat and drink, but ate breakfast included in the hotel and dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The strength is online! The breakfast is rich and exquisite, just give two examples: breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, both Chinese and Western are authentic: there are pancakes cut into small pieces, there are congee, noodles and fritters; there are all kinds of cereals, the salad provides French sauce, black olives and chickpeas; For dessert, I only had muffins, which tasted good. In recent years, I have eaten a richer hotel breakfast [shy]
🛤 Yanqi Lake play project
Yanqi Lake Park-We are not too interested and did not go
Yanqi Lake plank road-very nice place, because there are steps, I only walked about one-fifth. Recommend to go for a walk.
Yanqi Pagoda and National Convention and Exhibition Center-recommended to visit, take a panoramic view on the tower, and go to the Juxian Hall of the Convention and Exhibition Center.
Yanqi Island-is the location of Yanqi Pagoda and Yanqi Hotel. The environment is very good, a paradise. Yanqi Hotel is managed by Kempinski. We saw the Kempinski logo on the napkins and the glass of the hotel restaurant during lunch.
🔔Service: all very good, satisfied

Let me talk about the shortcomings: First, the bathtub in the room is broken, and I found out when I was about to wash it. After applying for the repair, the master Ma Lier came to Gei to fix it, and his attitude was very good. But it shows that there are still loopholes in the management, and I don't know the bathtub is broken. Second, the windows are dirty, which affects the landscape. There is a notice on the desk in the room: Please understand that the glass will be cleaned within a period of time. But the problem is that this period of time is exactly during our stay. Why do we have to look at dirty glass? I am not too picky in China, but the concept of hotel is still not international enough.

Surprise upgrade to the lake view room, the scenery is pleasing to the eye; the room is clean and tidy and the five-star standard; the pool is really small, compared with the same type of hotel in Gubei in the summer, it is really quiet and spacious; the Chinese restaurant tastes good; the hotel’s tandem bicycle is better than the one on the dam With two more children's seats, it is much easier to ride, and the multi-person bike at the rental car spot is really tiring to ride!

msg:The hotel rooms on weekends are quite tight, so I booked a Monchic themed room for the lake view room. The rooms are quite large, because the hotel’s architectural pattern is not regular, which is acceptable. However, I think: the bedroom has a lot of space. It seems that Ctrip wrote about a 2-meter bed, but it is actually a 1.8-meter ordinary bed. I feel that there is a lot of space in the room and it cannot be used, which is a waste of space, which is a pity.
In addition, the decoration of the hotel is old, so it is not so luxurious, but if you look at it years ago, it is still very gorgeous. A waterproof LCD TV is installed in front of the bathtub.

Overall, the hotel is still great, you can go directly to the Yanqi Lake dam from the 3rd floor.
Breakfast and dinner were eaten in the store, well-regulated, rich in content, and the taste does not need to be too demanding.
The attitude of the service staff is good, and they can be regarded as the old hotel brand.

Specifically, it is mainly due to the age of the decoration, which reduces the impact on the experience a little:
1. The big bed is too small. If the theme room uses a 2-meter bed, it will enhance a lot of experience;
2. The TV is too small;
3. The number of power ports and charging ports is less than 1. If two people have to lie on the bed and scan their phones and charge them, it will not be enough 😜

In short, it was a very pleasant stay.

msg:During the holiday, I came to Sunrise East. It rained on both days, but the view from the hotel was even more beautiful. There are so many people, every time the elevator has to wait for a long time, the Chinese restaurant has a long wait for dinner, but the self-service on the opposite side does not have to wait in line, and the service attitude is very good. Director Zhang Naiwen, waiter Wang Guanghua, and Master Li who cook the noodles are very enthusiastic and caring. The children especially like to eat the fried noodles made by Master Li. They eat two bowls every time. The noodle soup is really freshly boiled chicken soup, very carefully! The third floor of the hotel is to go to the main embankment sightseeing road at the entrance. Every time the security guards actively open the door for us, the service is particularly attentive. From here, we can see that the hotel management level is in place. The scenery is pleasant, especially when it rains, the clouds are steamed with clouds, and along with the green mountains and trees on the lake, an ink landscape painting leaps out. Xiao Li from the concierge explained the hotel facilities in detail, which made us feel at home from the beginning. In short, it is really amazing to have such a five-star hotel in Huairou. The breakfast is very rich, and the lunch in the beer house is also very good. Come here for good food, beautiful scenery and sports. It's worth it!

msg:I've always wanted to experience the feeling of staying here. This time I came here for a short-distance trial trip when I had time to find a feasible plan for this year's team activities. I have booked a courtyard-view room for more than two thousand on Ctrip, and I thought that the occupancy rate on Wednesday was not high and it might be upgraded. Because it’s Wednesday, there are fewer people, and the lobby is a little bleak. Because it’s a walk-and-go trip, the end number restriction is ignored. You can only drive out of the city’s restricted travel area before the travel restriction hour. So we arrived at the hotel at 8 in the morning, and the staff on duty in the lobby asked to come back at 3 o’clock in the afternoon to check in. We had to store our suitcases in the lobby (this is not as good as going to Panshan and staying at the Evergrande Hotel last month, which also arrived earlier, but The Evergrande Hotel arranged us very well, and you can see my excellent comments in its comment area.) Then we went out for a walk along the lake, and we can also follow this road to Yanqi Lake Park, the park ticket 45 yuan/person, there is really no view in the park, but you can imagine the lake where countless wild geese once lived, the green mountains in the distance, and the beautiful appearance of the Oriental Hotel overlooking the sunrise across the lake. I first visited this park 25 years ago. At that time, the island was now the Yanqi Hotel. Another time I went boating in Yanqi Lake and left my Nokia phone on the boat. I looked back and couldn’t find it and turned it off. It’s a pity that my precious photos and videos left a bad impression on this place that time. I stayed in Yanqi Hotel two years ago. It was quite good. The large transparent glass bathroom can see the graceful figure of the sunrise in the east. The management staff of Yanqi Hotel also arranged for us to visit the large villas there, which can also be called the president. The suite is really refreshing. The feeling of staying at Sunrise Oriental this time is very good. The rooms are clean and tidy. The bed is soft and hard. The semi-relying sofa chair is the most comfortable for staying in all hotels. It is quiet at night without any noise. The air conditioner is not turned on at night. The temperature is very comfortable, the waste bins are sorted garbage, the night light on the bedside wall is very new, the two sliding doors in the bathroom are very convenient, non-slip slippers are more comfortable and environmentally friendly than disposable slippers, but there is no human scale in the bathroom (this is a hotel Rarely encountered), the toilet flush button is broken, and sometimes it gets stuck. There are very few varieties in the freezer, only a few cans of drinks. Although they are free, there is no hint at all. Only the two bottles of mineral water are printed with free. The swimming pool in the fitness center is very good, with suitable light and water temperature. At that time, a children's swimming class was taking place here. It was slightly noisy. It was a phenomenon that had never been seen before in any hotel, and no drinking water was provided. The breakfast here is very good, the typical Western breakfast + Chinese style, the variety is very complete, although for the first time guests, the food table placement is a bit unsmooth for the meal, but you can find what you need. It may not be a weekend. There are fewer guests and the food rack is not very full, but I have everything I like. If there are some cheesecake and other desserts, it would be perfect. The service here is also very good. When the food and tableware (spoon) are needed, the waiter will take the initiative to deliver it to the seat. The design of the hotel is very impressive. The decoration and design of the restaurant and the banquet hall are very distinctive. The rest room on the guest room floor is spacious and comfortable, with soft lighting. It is a pity that I did not arrange to dine in the hotel's German restaurant this time. I just tasted the authentic farmhouse dishes at the nearby lakeside house. I hope to come here again.

msg:On September 2nd and 3rd, Ctrip booked the Sunrise Kempensiki (Sunrise Kempensiki) in Yanqi Lake, Beijing. The price on weekdays is RMB 1488 (more than 2500 on holidays), including one afternoon tea and beer. Two glasses of 650ml beer and two buffet breakfast. Since school has started, there are not many tourists on weekdays, so you can experience this unique hotel and the beautiful scenery of Yanqi Lake.
Yanqi Lake was the home of APEC in 2014. For this summit of world leaders, three unique buildings were built, namely the International Conference Center, the International Convention and Exhibition Center, and the Kempinski, which became the landmark of Yanqi Lake. The architecture and Yanqi Ye reflect each other.
The third floor of the hotel is connected to the Yanqi Dam. You can take a walk or ride a bicycle to see the beauty of the Yanqi from a distance, especially the night is more spectacular, and even a little magical.
As for the hotel itself, apart from its special shape, the rooms are of the average Kempinski standard. There is nothing special. On the contrary, the USB port on the bedside, which I pay more attention to, is not set up. This is insufficient for a relatively new hotel. Place. Afternoon tea is really not good, especially the salty ones are too thick. It is not recommended if they are specially made for afternoon tea, but the dishes in the brewery are very good, the portion is not too big, and it is not necessary to order a few more for two people. There will be too much, and it is really enjoyable with the complimentary beer; the breakfast is also very rich, with tastes from various countries, and the dining place is in the Elements restaurant on the second floor. There are many seats and the environment is very comfortable. The hotel’s swimming pool is at B2. There are five 25M lanes. Swim 1000M before drinking beer, which reduces the sense of guilt.
This hotel is mainly due to its location in Yanqi Lake, a beautiful place with beautiful mountains and clear waters. If you come for a holiday at a weekday price, it is quite worth it.

A high-end business hotel is now basically an internet celebrity parent-child hotel, but this is the hot spot in the market.

msg:Overall, the lake view suites have great views and rooms. The breakfast is very rich, but the taste of tofu nao is a bit like spicy soup... The service is very satisfactory, cleaning the room and turning the bed are proactive, and the drinks in the small refrigerator can also be used To add in time, there were a lot of people when checking out, and there was no special waiter to guide. As a result, I queued for a long time at the check-in counter. Finally, I was told to check out at another counter, and then at the check-out counter. I waited for a long time, and I was told that if I don’t need an invoice, I can put my room card directly in the express check-out box next to the counter. I was delayed for nearly half an hour. I hope that the front desk service can be strengthened in the future. Is a more suitable hotel for short-term vacation

The greening design of the entire island is very careful, and the landscape of the garden is one step at a time, especially near the Yanqi Pagoda.

The receptionist was a beautiful young lady named Lisa, Xiao Li, who was very enthusiastic and patient, and introduced us to the hotel environment, dining location, recreational facilities, etc. one by one. Also reminded us to apply for a car permit. The environment of a five-star hotel is elegant and a**ospheric. Those with little babies can go to the basement level. Older ones can ride around the lake or go climbing around the mountain. Downstairs is Yanqi Lake, you can also row a boat and stroll around the scenery. In terms of eating, I think the hotel buffet is quite good, there is a German meal on the first floor, and the big elbow is beer. The most important thing is afternoon tea, I have always liked it.

msg:The environment of the hotel is very good. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, facing the Gehu Lake of Yanqi Hotel. The scenery is pleasant and it is very suitable for relaxing on weekends. Although the hotel has been in business for a long time, the overall facilities are well maintained and meet the five-star quality. Two large beds and one small bed, the twin beds are put together, which is more spacious than the big bed. The floor attendants were very helpful, bringing extra sheets to flatten the gap between the mattresses, which was very considerate. There is not much place to eat nearby. Meals can only be solved in the hotel. The price of the restaurant is medium to high-end. Fortunately, the taste of the food is not bad and it is good value for money. From the hotel, you can walk to Yanqi Lake Park, about 20 minutes along the path, with lush foliage and green leaves on the side of the road, which can be described as a natural oxygen bar. Yanqi Lake Park is free to enter the park after 6pm on weekends, which is a great value for those living nearby. If you have time, you can go for a walk in the courtyard of Yanqi Hotel on the opposite side of the lake. The environment is quiet and the design is full.

There are rocking horses, small slides, small swings, children's tables and chairs, beaded toys, and small tents in the Super Flying Man's room. Children like it very much. Although the children’s playground is not big, there are children over 4 years old who play it, and the aunt inside is very patient to accompany the children to play. The hotel is next to Yanqi Lake, which is cool at night. The disadvantage is that the room can not open the window, all rely on air-conditioning, the quilt is a bit damp. In short, it is worth coming.

After communicating with the front desk staff, I arranged to have classes in a quieter public area on the third floor, but the staff still seemed a bit noisy. The guests arranged for us to move in soon after checking out. On the day of check-out, we extended the check-out time because we did not end the get out of class. Thank you very much to the staff at the front desk, especially the caring Miss Miko Wang, who let us enjoy the holiday without delaying the class. We have eaten at Lanxiangge and Prana many times. This stay made us feel that Kaibin not only has good food, but also has high-quality service and perfect supporting facilities. This experience is perfect~^_^

msg:Come out and relax, I'll do it again after a good impression of the sunrise last time. As a whole, I am very satisfied with the last time, but there are also unexpected discoveries. In winter, it is easy to have dry throat. As soon as I enter the house, I want to boil water to drink. When I open the kettle, I can see a hair at the bottom of the kettle. I still can't understand why there is hair in the kettle. . . . Because the opening of the kettle in the sunrise is very small, and considering the angle of the opening, it is basically impossible to fall in naturally. But when I think of the relevant news on the Internet, it's a bit disgusting, so I asked the room service to replace it with a clean one. No matter what the reason is, a hotel with such a price and star rating cannot guarantee the cleanliness of the entrance utensils, and it feels a little uncomfortable. I hope it is just an example. Although some behaviors of the guests cannot be restrained, they should be careful and responsible when cleaning, so as to be worthy of their own brand added value (the services provided by other parts are quite satisfactory). In addition, I complain that the coffee in the room is not suitable for the star, and it is too cheap.

msg:The hotel facilities are 80% new. The sanitation is not well done. The flower pots have cigarette butts, the windowsill and the bathroom door have hair strands. The sanitation is not carefully done. The most exaggerated is the use of impurities from the soap, speechless, 9 o’clock in the swimming pool It’s half closed, and the children’s playground is even more exaggerated. From 10 am to 6:30 pm, I have not seen a children’s playground with such a short business hours, and the area is relatively small, but it is clean, and the city view room can be said to have no aesthetic feeling. It can be said that there is no USB port, and the afternoon tea snacks taste very ordinary, and the personnel entering and leaving hope to strengthen the management. Advantages: Convenient parking, comfortable and clean beds, okay disposable dental kits, rooms still have a certain sense of technology, but also relatively large, the attitude of the service staff is good, and they can respond in time if there are problems, especially when staying in a hotel and visiting Yanxi Lake Hotel is ok. Generally speaking, the details need to be paid attention to, and others are still worth recommending.

The little brothers and sisters at the front desk are very gentle~ When we checked in, we upgraded our lake-view room for free so that we could see such a great view! Thank you 😊 We need an extra bed. The hotel has arranged a twin room for you~ After check-in, it is also responsive. Tips The room does not take the initiative to provide disposable slippers, but you can ask for it at the front desk ~ will help bring them up soon.
The package I bought on Ctrip. Each room comes with an afternoon tea package. The taste is acceptable~ still very pleasant~ There is also a single bicycle ride, and the scenery is superb~ The little brother who is in charge of renting the car is still before and after the ride. All gave mineral water, very considerate (｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡We can go to the restaurant in the garden of Yanqi Hotel with the parking permit of Kempinski Hotel. In short, it is a great trip!

You must have a lake-view room to live in Sunrise East. It is expensive and expensive. In my opinion, it is no less than a trip to the West Lake. During this period of scorching heat, the weather in Hangzhou is also sweltering. Compared with saving travel time and transportation costs, and viewing the scenery in an air-conditioned room, the overall price/performance ratio is good. So the rooms are basically full on weekends, so you can book early and you can cancel if something happens. It is indeed a place where you can go often! There is also a night light show! You can watch all kinds of ⚡️ in thunderstorm days!

Free afternoon tea worth 268 yuan upon check-in. I stayed in a twin room, the room was spacious, clean and tidy. Provide non-slip slippers, bottled mineral water, instant coffee, black tea, etc. In particular, I would like to commend the on-duty manager jessie for his very high professional quality! Handling things quickly, professionally, enthusiastically and thoughtfully. My wallet was in the safe in the room. Less than an hour after I left the hotel, she immediately called to inform and verify, and then quickly came up with a solution, letting me leave Beijing with peace of mind. Manager Jiang on duty that day also provided professional services in place, considerate to the guests, and was warm and thoughtful. Will come to stay in the future and recommend friends and Ctrip members to stay. The hotel has convenient parking and is suitable for family holidays with children.

There is a children's playground in the hotel, where you can boat and ride a bicycle, and there is a lot of fun. The room type of the suite is too far-fetched. It is the most extreme room. Except for the bedroom, there is a narrow ***** called a "suite". The price/performance ratio is really not high.

msg:Maybe I don’t know what the hotel is when I hear Sunrise, but if you mention Kempinski, everyone will be familiar with it. The name may have something to do with Russia, so there will be saltwater bread. Breakfast bread is good. But if you want to eat Kempinski's bread, Kempinski at Liangmaqiao is worth experiencing.
For Kempinski in Yanqi Lake, it is still more suitable for driving. The distance is not too far from the eastern suburbs. Parking is free and parking spaces are relatively sufficient. It is a good place for families to travel. It may be in time for the Dragon Boat Festival, the hotel queuing is time-consuming, but the wait is worth it. The front desk staff watched us take the children and were upgraded. It is not too perfect. It reminds me of the upgraded room in Bali. Lucky scene. The benefits of staying in a suite should not be too perfect. Children can watch TV in the living room without affecting the bedroom. In this way, if you stay with children, the suite looks better! Let’s talk about the facilities and restaurants in the hotel. There is a children’s play area on B1. It’s not flattering here. The space is too small and may not be able to accommodate a few children. The children feel boring after playing for a while. There is also a gym on B1, so I didn’t go to observe. , I can’t make a comment, but I went to the swimming pool area and the child liked it. There is a SPA on the third floor. I only experienced one project. The design space of the room is a bit compact. In terms of cost performance, Soso will also sell Farman products. Two items are 20% off and three items are 30% off. Next, let’s talk about the restaurant. Breakfast is a buffet. You will definitely be full, both Chinese and Western. There is also a brewery, it is said that the highest rated nearby, beer is still possible.
Let’s talk about the 24-hour ordering service in the hotel. When we learn that we have a small opinion about a certain dish, we can solve the problem quickly. This efficiency is very effective. This service is also very recommended. Sometimes the consumption is service.
Talking about the surroundings, the recreational activities are cycling along Yanqi Lake. You can't circle the entire lake. You must pay attention to safety when cycling. There are always cars passing by. It would be better if there is no car experience, and it feels more suitable for soaking in a hotel.
Overall, it is satisfactory and worth recommending.

msg:Free upgraded the lake view room, the overall facilities are complete, but the staff service is not good. For example, the afternoon tea location is very full, the waiter came up to the opening to say, "You pack it and take it away", not patiently help you arrange the waiting number, giving the guest a bad experience. For example, on the first floor of Prana, the rest of the meat would be packed and the lunch box would be charged five dollars. The guest spent five thousand dollars for a stay, not five dollars, but felt that there was no reason for this charge, and the waiter was not happy, but did not charge the package.
There are also a lot of people waiting in line during the peak check-out period. The front desk staff also sells chopsticks while checking out. It is dual-use and too inefficient.

整體服務都很滿意，早餐自助餐廳、中餐廳等幾個用餐區域的服務都很周到。菜品也都符合口味，衞生條件也還不錯。
酒店的硬件設施還可以，但有些小細節考慮的不太周全，設計上存在缺陷，作為五星來説有點差強人意。泳池還不錯，但因為更衣室在裝修，游完泳需要走上樓梯才能進入更衣室，樓道里非常冷，還四處透風，游上來一定穿暖了。
這期間有一個小插曲，有一次我們在大堂等電梯準備回房間，和我們一起等電梯的還有一名工作人員（應該是休息換班了，拿着東西在看手機），他按的下行鍵。電梯到了，他看着手機第一個走進電梯，然後我們提醒她説，這是上梯啊（因為我們看到電梯的閃燈了，他可能看手機沒注意看），然後他站在電梯裏説，這是下梯。我們再次確認説，這是上梯，這時他可能反應過來了就出來了，我們才上了電梯。
雖然是一個坐電梯在常見不過的事情，但是之前在任何酒店，印象中都是服務員會讓客人先進先做，沒有搶着進去並且坐錯了還佔著梯子的。不是大事，我們也並不介意，畢竟那會可能這位服務員已經到休息時間了，但是既然穿着工作服，代表企業形象，可能貴酒店在培訓上還需要加強。

msg:第一天下午5點多我一個人帶着3歲孩子開始辦理入住，辦理時候衹和我説贈了一張啤酒坊600元勸，我還主動問了一下中餐廳幾點開門，前台和我説5：30（還是6：00，有點記不清了），隨後有個服務員小男孩幫我把行李搬到了房間，走時候特意提醒我中餐廳要預訂，我一看已經五點半趕緊打電話預訂，被告知大約等一小時，我想着6：30孩子吃飯也可以，6：20多我和孩子到餐廳問等位情況，被告知前面還有四桌，我開始有點着急但也知道等位這個時間確實餐廳也不受控制，服務員看到我着急就和我説著急的話也可以房間內訂餐，而且還有寶寶餐，大約半小時等送到。這時候我有點怒了，從登記到送行李服務小哥，都看到我一個媽媽帶着孩子，從頭至尾沒人和我介紹過還可以房間內點寶寶餐，早知道這樣我5：30就點了，現在等位遙遙無期，再點餐孩子還要等到7：00才吃飯，我立刻回到房間找菜單結果怎麼都找不到，聯繫完前台才知道菜單“藏在”抽屜裏，真是氣不打一處來，結果因為我的投訴，房間內點餐時常由半小時變成15分鐘，孩子在6：45吃上了晚飯。隨後經理還親自送來果盤道歉。果盤我沒收，我還是想實事求是的把我的不滿説出來，不能潛意識覺得顧客知道酒店的每一項服務，對於用餐特別是寶寶餐服務我覺得應該在我詢問餐點或者前台就該主動提示一下，前台不僅沒提示寶寶餐也沒提示要預約，感覺默認顧客都是住了八百回了，什麼都清楚。
第二天開始自助餐廳早午餐，服務員小姐姐都很負責，看我一個人帶着孩子取餐多次過來服務，這點還是感謝。我覺得這個才應該是五星酒店該有的服務吧。
酒店設施和環境還可以，但是由於第一天孩子晚餐的原因體驗感不佳，希望以後親子游的家庭吸取我的經驗，早預訂或者房間內找菜單，大人無所謂，別耽誤孩子吃飯。

壞的地方：設備略顯陳舊，如水龍頭，桌子；衞生細節差，比如玻璃窗下方。
沒想到的地方：餐廳需要提前預訂，入住時沒有提醒，十一人多就不容易訂上。實際上到店發現很多空座，但也要排號了，可以接受但如果提前有説明更好。

3.房間衞生一般，枱子上有明顯的污漬，洗漱用品也配不上你2000一晚得價格
4.酒店外觀配上雁西湖，在大壩上確實不錯，風景適合拍照.
5.早餐豐富，味道不錯
6.下午茶不錯，小童俱樂部太小，游泳池很好，有個30多度的熱水池，非常適合泡泡
以上缺點優點為個人住過的真實感受，可供參考！

大壩旁邊的遊船碼頭，晚上半價，但是遊船距離短，不太建議坐，從大壩上就可以看夜景了

房屋整體設施 洗漱用品的品質跟房間是不匹配的

親子遊樂場小的可憐，稍微大點的孩子應該沒有興趣

控訴開始：
1️⃣暑期入住人多可以理解，但是12點退房，下午三點入住不可理解，尤其我12點排了老長的隊到前台，同時三個隊在排，每個隊10個人，效率極低，沒有大堂經理安撫情緒，疏導人流，辦理完成被告知沒房要等電話☎直到下午2點40，主動打過去還沒房，被告知我們酒店就是這個規定，潛台詞是你問了也白問，2點50到前台詢問，遇到一位長者也來問，前台告訴他您得每過一段時間就到前台來問一下，直到有房，你説是不是奇葩🤷同時現場辦理入住的客人，竟然奇蹟般幸運的直接入住了，你説是不是歧視你來的太早😱最後是快罵孃的時候給了房間，3點，果然凱賓斯基誠不欺我！
2️⃣房間真是夠“精緻”，高高的洗手枱讓小朋友望而卻步，冰涼的馬桶圈真是讓人神清氣爽，🛁浴缸在已經套了浴缸套的情況下，依舊很滑。p.s.浴缸套還是我自己帶的，第二天早上問酒店有沒有浴缸套，人家才給，不要是不給的。不知道酒店還有什麼隱藏服務需要自己發掘？🧐
3️⃣不是親子酒店，就拿一個比公共衞生間大一些的房子做親子樂園，還不如沒有，家長們衹能委屈的擠在門口，不遠處的大小會議室門前開闊到可以並排開汽車🚘
4️⃣忘了這是一家網紅酒店，入住賓客掃一堆碼，登記半天，耗時費力，原來從雁棲湖公園就能從酒店後門掃個健康寶進來參觀公共區域，溜達拍照都不是問題，這管理，真是對自己的客人嚴格要求！

總之，不會再去日出東方，不會再入住凱賓斯基旗下品牌，因為各方面都不好，所以忽略了優點，拿着放大鏡找缺點，這家酒店性價比極低，少有的差評，甚至是處女差評，獻給凱賓斯基日出東方🙆

房間方面：整潔衞生一絲不苟，親子房玩具、設施很不錯，孩子也喜歡玩兒。特別是房間還有提示卡，普及夏日各種類型的昆蟲朋友，防止受到驚嚇🙀

服務方面：無可挑剔，因為孩子要在12點左右睡午覺，垂詢了提前入住事宜，酒店非常理解極力配合，完美保障了孩子的遊玩精力。

餐飲方面：一直在中餐廳點餐，粵菜系，很地道！各種點心都很正宗，就是高峯時期可能需要等位。

遊玩方面：近雁棲湖出口有小火車坐，遊船碼頭和自行車租賃點都很近，帶孩子還是比較適合的。泳池內有低幼泳池區域，很人性化。

msg:1. 住：這次的親子套房十分具有特色，是蒙奇奇的主題房。房間裏有各種小朋友玩的設施，裏面到處都是蒙奇奇的貼紙。小朋友好喜歡，很適合帶小孩來住！
2. 吃：酒店有3個餐廳：一個吃早飯的、中餐廳和西餐廳各一個。西餐是德國菜，中餐是粵菜，兩個都不錯
3. 玩：娛樂設施還挺多，包括健身房、泳池、小童樂園和SPA。可惜這次都沒體驗，衹住了一晚。另外酒店還提供自行車，一小時100元。三樓外面有一個平台，面對雁棲湖，還可以看見晚霞時雲的色彩變化。

這次總體的入住體驗還是很不錯的，建議大家來看看。

msg:先説不錯的地方：首先地理位置很好，環境很不錯，酒店一面可以看湖景，一面可以看城市的景色，如果選擇的是高樓層肯定更好。酒店三層可以直接通往雁棲湖大壩，在大壩上散步，騎車或者沿路遊覽還是不錯的。其次，酒店的設施還可以，整體不錯，衹是有些細節設施略有老舊。
不足的地方：酒店人員的專業度和服務意識達到基本標準，但個人感覺沒有達到一個五星級酒店的應有標準。比如，你開車到了大堂門口了，門僮或者酒店工作人員還在自顧自的聊天，而不是詢問你需不需要幫助；晚上想用電視給孩子看看自帶優盤裡的小童節目，客房服務説電視用不了優盤，主要這優盤都已經插上而且顯示出操作界面了，應該是遙控器的問題，但客房明顯沒有幫客人解決問題的意識。整體的感覺就是服務意識還需要提高，專業能力也要提高，雖然現在的水平已經夠用了。另外，熱情度要提高點，工作人員感覺不是很積極，精神狀態半死不拉活的。五星級酒店應該在專業能力，服務意識和精神面貌上都要給客人很好的體驗感。

酒店3層可直通雁棲湖大壩，非常方便。我們租了單車🚲一家人繞湖騎行很是愜意。不太好的地方是時不時有汽車來往，不是自行車專用道，希望以後好好規劃一下，能有專用的自行車道。
酒店早餐相對一般，可選種類不多，不過味道還不錯。

服務也保持了五星酒店的水準，入住的房間發現空調有問題後和前台反饋了一下，前台禮賓部的一個小哥就陪我一同去房間裏看一下實際情況，到了房間後發現空調確實有問題後，也不墨跡不推脱，馬上電話聯繫維修部來看。我表示要換個房間後小哥也二話不説的和我一起返回前台，小哥和前台工作人員溝通後，前台的一個有些富態的女士幫我及時換了一個房間，由於當時定的房型出來空調有問題的那個房間以外暫時沒有其他房間，就幫我升級了房型，整個過程沒有任何推諉，非常乾淨利索，溝通交流讓人覺得很舒服，點個贊。
早餐地方很大，人多的時候補菜也很及時，麪包不錯。

其次，house keeping送進來小童用品的時候問我你用嗎？很多人都不用寶寶洗漱（我表示一臉黑線，收錢且不説我是真的會用：其次我用不用跟你有關係嗎？沒有對不對？再次表示不理解為什麼要多於説這樣的話）
説説好的地方吧，游泳池很喜歡，水不涼～很好玩，還有一個1.1m的温水池，大人孩子都很友好～桑拿房也很棒就是櫃子鎖真的質量堪憂…
小童玩耍區域不大，但是也還行～～～基本夠了～餐廳打電話給預約排隊，排到還會打電話通知，特別好～

另外酒店的下午茶很悠閑，泳池人不多，早餐很豐盛。遇到的員工都保持了高品質的水準，給客人以國賓級的服務。從入住時前台Lisa li細緻的接待到退房時一分鐘快速交房卡免驗，非常好的一段時光留在人生的回憶中。

but，酒店出租的自行車為什麼比外面的貴那麼多？我還問了禮賓人員是否符合市場價，騙我！騎出去2分鐘就看到有租車的，便宜很多！還有遮陽棚！

別無她。

服務總得來説都不錯，大堂吧餐廳客房都不錯，最差的是前台，不但死板生硬，第一次碰見邀請付費升級，微胖女前台邊轉筆邊抖着等客人回答問題的。心裏當時非常驚詫，您可知道您是代表凱賓斯基啊。然後又忘了打上島車證，再下來補打也沒任何歉意，任由她的男同事幫我們，無語。

客房比幾年前開業不久的時候略顯陳舊，總體維護還好，洗浴備品終於換成還能接受的一般衞浴備品。

衹是屋裡太幹，睡一宿，肉眼可見深色枱麪一層灰。真的是幹到所有的織物都脆化。也沒有放加濕和除菌，屋裡比較難受。

疫情影響，店裡客人非常少，但價格沒有任何調整。感覺是皇帝女兒不愁嫁的樣子。

有些失望的體驗。

環境:凱賓斯基自身酒店內部環境客觀説一般，跟對面雁西湖酒店不是一回事。
服務：服務我覺得還有待提高，我是本週一下午3點到的酒店，開始辦入住，從辦入住到拿到鑰匙接近1個小時，也有可能是疫情管控較緊原因，總之現場還是有點亂。
設施：房間衞生間門壞了，通知了客房經理過來查看，一推差點倒了，然後從8樓換到了9樓，給了我一個套房（表示感謝，房間很大，性價比肯定比我城景豪華好很多）。
餐飲：早餐我覺得一般，至少不像評論描述那樣，有上百種可選（這不是最重要），重要是口感也就那樣，或許是我要求太高吧。
      中餐二樓，呆了2天，就吃了一次酒店晚餐（中餐），當然本身不能用價格去衡量酒店提供的餐食，不説價格，味道我真的覺得一般，128的牛肉河粉，我真覺得做的好一般。
發發呆，還是可以
也謝謝給我升級了套房，但還是要實事求是指出些問題。

服務依舊不錯，但是酒店年頭不短了，硬件有點陳舊。
我們的房間一進去就聞到一股煙味，因為當時房間緊張也就沒換房。奇怪的是煙味經久不散，後來發現應該是門口空調的出風口，可能是濾芯太臟了，吹出來的煙味。
住了一天之後，馬桶和地磚的接縫處竟然開始滲水，工人説不好修，於是在馬桶前面鋪了幾條浴巾湊合著。
這還挺讓人無語的，希望酒店能夠儘快改進吧！

     至於説一樓某啤酒坊，118元一份高大上的麪，讓倒兩杯水，杯子裏都是食物殘渣，我都懶得説了，還有很多諸如此類。
  優點也不是沒有，外形高大上，捨得開空調
