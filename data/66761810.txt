msg:Honestly the most beautiful and the best hotel experience I‚Äôve had in China! The hotel is situated in the gorgeous Mingshi village and our stay at Mingshi Yaju gave us complimentary access to the paid scenic area. The hotel is also conveniently 30 minutes from the main attraction - Detian Waterfall. Our stay included delicious breakfast, daily fruits and desserts, complimentary bamboo raft and cycling experience. They also have gym, pool and shuttle amenities. The staff there were extremely friendly and helpful! Sincerely want to thank Miss Zhou (Âë®Â∞èÂßêÔºâfor making our stay so amazing. 

Highly recommend staying here!

at the hotel are nice and very kind, we've found their
attention and kindness over our expectations. Food at the
nearby resort/restaurant isn't bad either but surely limited
in terms of options. Back to the hotel...nothing to
complain, we had a very relaxing, comfortable and
pleasant stay. We will be probably back with family and

msg:This hotel was amazing! Every aspect was built with comfort, beauty and relaxation in mind. The setting of the hotel is in the perfect spot right on the river and surrounded by towering mountains.They should add "resort" to the name. The room was plush and spacious with a great view of both river and mountains. The infinity pool is amazing and built for relaxation.  It has comfortable cabana style lounge chairs literally in the pool. The staff is very attentive and met every need. They also provide shuttle service to the river rafting starting point and provide bicycles for riding around the countryside. (The hotel is also the end point of the river rafting trip.) The only downside is that the hotel is difficult to get to. Apparently there are plans to make this town into a tourist destination. Most of the major roads were torn up and the facades of most buildings are under construction. Even with that, being at the resort makes all that irrelevant. If you need a place to wash all your stress away, this is the perfect place. If I had one recommendation, it would be to think about foreign guests in terms of adult beverages.  There is a beautiful bar right next to the pool... but one doesn't want tea while at the pool. Everything else about this hotel is perfect.

You must go to the bamboo raft given by the hotel! It is better than the bamboo raft experience of buying tickets in the scenic area! There are only four guests and one staff member on our boat. It is very pleasant to drink tea and eat snacks while enjoying the scenery. You must also participate in the bonfire party in the evening. We participated twice in succession, once in the outdoor square (with a lighting ceremony) and once on the indoor stage on a rainy day. The a**osphere is very good and the two performances are slightly different. The host is humorous and knowledgeable. He shared a lot of knowledge about the Zhuang people. The young actors are also very full of emotions and very happy (Chinese people's own disco)/The hotel will put good night desserts in the guest room every night, draw the blackout curtains, and put fresh fruits, which is very considerate. They will also greet guests enthusiastically when they see them. You can also borrow the hotel's bicycles to travel around the Mingshi Tianyuan Scenic Area

The goodnight dessert every day is very considerate. Breakfast is by portion. I think it's okay. My family thinks it's average. It depends on personal taste. If you don't like it, you can go to the Chinese restaurant in the villa to eat. There are more varieties there. The rice noodles are in chicken soup. I went there for breakfast for the last two days.
The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic. Every day when they pass by the front desk, they will ask if they want to spray mosquito water. When it rains, they will drive a shuttle bus to pick them up. They will respond to any request. You can also wear the hotel's national costumes to take pictures. In addition to the weather being too hot, it is absolutely a five-star rating ‚ù§Ô∏è

In fact, I don‚Äôt have too many fantasies about hotels in 18th-tier cities. I also tacitly accept the practice of hotels charging higher room rates due to their good locations. I think as long as the facilities are convenient and the hygiene is good, it‚Äôs fine. But Yaju has done much more than that.
1) Before check-in, the hotel manager added WeChat to inform the exact parking address and all activities related to the hotel
2) There are many free activities: rafting, restaurant discount coupons, cycling, sauna, and good night dessert (Figure 4)
3) The service is very warm, and its thoughtfulness, enthusiasm, and ability to consider customers are absolutely comparable to international chains in super first-tier cities. I even asked about their training content and procedures on the bamboo raft (I have stayed in some hotels before, and the waiters were very proactive and enthusiastic, but they did not really understand what the customers wanted. The waiters here can consider the guests before the guests and coordinate the relevant matters. For example, when they saw us carrying fruits in, they took the initiative to ask if we needed to wash and cut them, and then the peeled and cut fruits were neatly arranged in the room)
4) I won‚Äôt say much about the environment, open the window and look at Figure 1
5) I won‚Äôt go into details about the hotel facilities, there are photos of the booking, and the supplies inside are also complete, in line with the five-star chain. The outdoor swimming pool is shown in Figure 2
6) Breakfast is shown in Figure 3

Welcome fruit/snacks: one plate per day, 3-5 varieties
Good night dessert: Red bean paste on the first day, Tremella and red date soup on the second day (not sweet, very delicious)

msg:I decided to go to Guangxi on a whim. I was going to book a hotel near the LUX, but there were no rooms available. So I chose this hotel near the LUX. I thought the location was similar and the price was not cheap, so it shouldn't be too bad. When I went there, I saw that it was just a version of a farmhouse, and it seemed to be specially for elderly tour groups. This Yaju is considered a boutique independent hotel in it. In fact, it is very average, both in terms of scenery and equipment. The most important thing is the room **. When I went to bed at night, there was an inexplicable rhythmic sound when I turned off the lights, and it was gone when I turned on the lights. Later, it was still there when I turned on the lights. The staff came after one o'clock in the evening, but they couldn't find the reason. Because this area only opened our building, there were only seven or eight rooms full, and there was no replacement. After various requests, we could only sleep in the rooms outside. I went to that room and still had nigh**ares at night. I felt that someone was by the bed. I reached out and touched **, and then it was more terrible than the nigh**ares I had before, and I felt that I couldn't get rid of it. I didn't sleep well for a night, and my schedule for the next morning was completely disrupted. The hotel's handling attitude is ***. I communicated with Ctrip many times and asked me not to comment. They refunded the 2300 room fee, but charged us 1000 for the room we slept in at night. If we disagreed, they would charge us the original price. *******, all kinds of communication with employees, I felt that their boss was very powerful. If I argued with them again, they would come to Beijing to ask me for compensation. The scenery here is very ordinary. There is nothing outside, including the scenery outside the LUX. Don't come to this place. There may be black shops without scenery. Finally, thank Ctrip for always solving the problem closely. Ctrip subsidized the cost. I hope Ctrip can downgrade and reduce the star of this black shop to prevent other tourists from falling into the trap. If it is downgraded, I am willing to return the subsidy of Ctrip.

Although there are some small places with insufficient experience, the staff will work very hard to help you solve any problems. The hardware is also OK, clean and hygienic. The bamboo raft afternoon tea charter boat experience is very good, and the countryside riding is also very beautiful. The coupons are basically enough for dinner for 2 people. A small gift was also given when checking out. Highly recommended to friends who come to Chongzuo for the first time, it is much better than staying in Yeshuji B&B!

The dedicated butler is very enthusiastic and will contact you in advance to provide check-in information. We booked a starry room for three people, and a special room for one person was given as a gift. During the cruise, cycling and breakfast, the three of us had a bamboo raft to ourselves. The evening breeze was very comfortable and relaxing. Snacks, fruits and drinks were specially prepared on the bamboo raft, which was very considerate. Although the breakfast is served in portions, it is exquisite and delicious. It is a good mood to sit by the pool and dine. Recommended

The bamboo raft guys are very hardworking. There will be a group of butlers to establish contact, and requests can be responded to quickly. The hotel will provide vouchers for the Chinese restaurant, which tastes good. There is a bonfire party at 8 p.m. and the a**osphere is super It‚Äôs fun, hahaha~ There are late night snacks in the evening, but no one told me. I saw two late night snacks when I was about to fall asleep, even though there was a group of butlers, they didn‚Äôt tell me. . I got cold when I saw it. .
In terms of the hotel's internal facilities, it is obviously not up to par for a high-end resort hotel. It feels like the entire hotel is completely based on the swimming pool to take pictures? But it is not constant temperature, so it can be said to be useless but useless. The smart toilet is well received, the room is small, the shower head spray and the copycat Dyson hair dryer are just perfunctory to me. I would rather take a Xiaomi hair dryer. The whole room is dark and the switch does not work well. . Alas, I don‚Äôt even want to say it anymore. .
For a 2k hotel, guests must have certain expectations, but in terms of the internal facilities of the room, they are similar to those of 500 yuan hotels on the market, which is really a bit disappointing. . Can

msg:To be honest, when I first booked this hotel and looked at the photos, I thought it was not worth the money. Later, I found that there were many hidden surprises waiting for you when choosing this hotel, and the room was the least valuable part.
Surprise 1: The hotel is in a Zhuang Museum. You can enter and exit the hotel for free (otherwise you have to buy a ticket). There is a famous scenic spot made into a stamp (Figure 9). It is really beautiful at sunset, and the hotel gave a bamboo raft. A bamboo raft with several people blowing the breeze and drinking tea, it is so pleasant to swim on the river.
Surprise 2: The restaurant in the hotel is very delicious, and the hotel gives vouchers, which can be used for cash discounts. When checking out, I found it was very cheap. When eating, this hotel has an exclusive table (relatively close to the inside, there are many people outside and it is very noisy). While eating, I watched the performance on the river, which was unsatisfactory.
Surprise 3: There are performances in the museum at night. Although they are not particularly professional, they are very down-to-earth and fun.
So although the room here is not big and the hotel is not too big, it is not boring at all. I am very happy to be able to play from afternoon to night.

Before leaving, he also presented the produce of Mingshi Farm as a souvenir. It can be said that this hotel has the best service over the years, impeccable.

The room is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with picturesque scenery, and the first floor of the hotel is even more check-in. place to go. On the day of check-in, they warmly arranged a separate afternoon tea on a bamboo raft for my children and me. It was so comfortable to enjoy black tea and snacks while admiring the mountains and rivers. In the evening we also went to the nearby Zhuang Museum to attend a bonfire party. The enthusiasm and simplicity of the Zhuang family were deeply impressed by the child. He said he would like to stay at Mingshi Yaju next time. Breakfast is also very rich and exquisite. Looking forward to seeing you next year!

Although I am used to reading bad reviews before deciding whether to stay, my previous worries were completely eliminated after I moved in. From the moment you make a reservation, a housekeeper will call and add your WeChat account. When you arrive at the hotel, a battery car will pick you up and take you to the lobby entrance. When checking in at the lobby, there was an insulated box next to the front desk, which contained insulated mineral water for you to take. Suddenly, I felt that the management and service of this B&B were particularly warm and meticulous. Because I had children with me, it was inconvenient to rush out for breakfast. The waiter also brought three breakfasts, and the service was top-notch! Before checking out, I was given a bag of rice, which was very heartwarming. I will continue to stay here next time I have a chance to come!
Facilities: Fully equipped. There is a gym

Hygiene: clean and tidy, equipped with children's toothbrush supplies, bath towels wrapped in disposable bags

The environment is located in the Mingshi Pastoral Scenic Area. You can watch performances in the scenic area with your room card. It is fun at night and during the day:
Warm and meticulous service:
Good night dessert: mung bean syrup and sago
Welcome fruits/snacks: apples, bananas, citrus.

The hotel also provides free bicycles, free boat rides, and desserts every night. Because there were three of us, Butler Xiao Zhou specially applied for free breakfast and cruise for the third person. He also personally drove the cruise for us and gave us an intimate explanation.

Catering: The welcome fruits and good night desserts in the room are different every day. Although the breakfast is a set meal, it varies every day. If I don‚Äôt drink porridge, I think they make it delicious. I was also given a meal coupon, but the Chinese restaurant at the door really didn't appreciate it and I suggested not to give the coupon.

Unfortunately, the two days I stayed were cloudy. Instead of seeing the stars, it rained in the middle of the second night. After waking up, we still need to be cautious when booking a star-free room in the future. I thought the starry sky room would be very hot, but the air conditioner in the room is very good. Stepping into the room from the hot and humid outdoors is like freezing and burning. Hotel breakfast is one serving per person, porridge + flour + bread + steamed buns + milk + yogurt + fried eggs + ham and bacon are very rich, if not enough, you can add more. The cookies given by the hotel are also good, but the cookies on the second night were a bit damp and not as delicious as the first day. I also gave 80*2*2 dining vouchers, no usage restrictions, we used them in Chinese restaurants, the restaurant prices are not expensive, and we ordered drinks after ordering dishes. The service is not bad, the housekeeper added WeChat the day before check-in, and clearly informed the address, hotel facilities and so on. The bamboo raft tour given by the hotel lasts about 45 minutes. The route is not long, but the scenery is not bad. The brother in charge of sailing will explain the scenic spots along the way, and snacks are also prepared on board. It is very convenient to ride, and the condition of the car is also good, but the bicycle is not locked, so be careful. It was the first time we rode to the scenic spot to take pictures, and when we came out, we found that two bicycles were missing. Later, the couple who "take it without warning" Returned the car again, a false alarm. It is very close to Yulin Dam by riding from the internal route of the hotel. It takes about seven or eight minutes to arrive, and there will be no villagers blocking the road to charge. There are many places to eat near Mingshi Tianyuan. There is a good juice stand diagonally opposite. It costs 10 yuan a cup, but the sanitation is a bit poor. The roast suckling pig on the side of the road I read in the guide said it was average, but we bought one and thought it was ok. The pork is very fragrant and the skin is crispy enough. It is cheap and good quality

Disadvantages: ‚ë† More than 2,000 yuan per night, the price of a five-star hotel, but the facilities are the package of a B&B for 500 yuan, for example: this Feike hair dryer, the package for this price range is Dyson.
‚ë°: Look at the handle of the sink. The water stains are very obvious. No one cleans it every day. It's really off-putting. Details matter for a hotel of this price
‚ë¢: The aesthetics of the toilet are not good. This cheap green glass. I thought I was staying in a B&B that costs 300 a night?
‚ë£: There is a peculiar smell in the rooms along the river. The waiter said that because it rains often, the wood will smell. This is true.
The entire hotel was developed by the Mingshi Pastoral Tourism Bureau. A quick look at the hotel reveals that it is actually decorated with low-cost decoration. The organization that developed this tourist area is so smart! The overall facilities, including bedding and utensils, are all of B&B quality and cannot match the price of 2,300 per night. However, there are not many accommodations here, and the prices are generally the same. Just be mentally prepared when you come to check in. Don't expect too much and you will be pleasantly surprised. Generally speaking, Chongzuo is okay. There are complaints about the hotel, but it is still a comfortable stay.

The beautiful scenery outside the window is pleasing to the eye. You can comfortably watch the mountains while lying down. It is great. The taste of the supporting restaurant needs to be improved. On the contrary, the product and taste of the breakfast are quite good and the variety is rich. Exceeding expectations, the bamboo raft cruise has a panoramic view of the scenery, and there is no need to go to Yangshuo to kill the boat ticket. Greatüëç
But the above is not the most important service. Meticulous service is the biggest gain from this trip. From the contact and communication before check-in to the various services at the hotel, it makes people feel that they have chosen the right hotel.
When leaving the hotel, I accidentally discovered that the car's tire was punctured and the tire was punctured. The housekeeper immediately tried his best to contact the door to repair the tire. Unfortunately, it was inconvenient for him to come to the door. The housekeeper also helped contact the hotel engineering depar**ent to help get an air pump and temporarily inflated it. Then he could drive out and go to the repair shop to repair the tire. Is everything okay? I delayed going to Detian Waterfall in the afternoon and encountered such dedicated and touching service when I was out. I was really lucky to have chosen the right hotel. If the first acquaintance was just a matter of fate, the reunion must be due to the unforgettable experience of Yajumei. The beauty of accommodation is not only in the landscape, but also in the sincerity

The photos in the hotel are also beautiful, especially the night scene. A lady surnamed Huang at the front desk is very considerate in service, and a man who is not tall is always smiling and the service is very enthusiastic.
There are two disadvantages: one is the family room in the hotel, with one big bed and one small bed. Those who book this type of room must travel with older children, but the room accessories, such as toothbrush cups and bathrobes, are shared by two people. Configuration; hotel breakfast, night dessert, bamboo raft, etc., there are only two, and children need to make up for it. This has not been encountered in family rooms in other hotels. I feel that the hotel has not considered the setting of family rooms. The second is that because there are children staying in the family room, it is recommended that the brightness of the lights should be increased. Now the hotel room is too dim.

This one is more like a famous country hotel, with poor hardware, old rooms, and lack of some basic facilities, such as no safe in the room. The most frightening thing is that the standard of the restaurant is really worse than that of any farmhouse you can find outside. The food is super unpalatable, but the price is 3 times. In addition, the service staff in the hotel basically didn't smile or feel very enthusiastic. Except for the butler in the room, the butler service is still very considerate. Also, the location of the hotel is too remote. You have to take a taxi or drive yourself when you get out of Chongzuo South Station. It takes a lot of effort. Of course, the scenery is remarkable when the weather is good, but considering various factors , the same landform is still more recommended Yangshuo.

The hotel is located at the core of Mingshi Resort, about 40 minutes' drive from Detian Waterfall. The hotel room is very large, and there is a special bathing pool on the balcony, where you can take a bath while drinking along the river. It is recommended to choose a room with river view. It is very quiet and the scenery in the morning is as beautiful as a splash-ink landscape painting. I like the service here more, not only refresh the fruit and afternoon tea every day, but also send sugar water in the evening. On the day of check-in, the front desk reminded that there are 160 yuan of meal coupons that can be deducted in the hotel restaurant every day. I thought it was just a marketing tool for the restaurant, but I didn‚Äôt expect that the daily meal coupons can be superimposed, and the consumption of the restaurant is indeed not expensive. A dinner was delivered, and the important thing is that the dinner can be delivered to the room for eating. The bamboo rafting provided by the hotel is also very good. The battery car in the store is delivered to the pier, and the place to disembark is in the hotel, which is really convenient.

Pushing the window, you can see the mountains and the water, surrounded by clouds and mist, like a poem and a picture! Mingshi Garden is the filming location of "A Thousand Bones of Flowers", which will take you into the landscape painting in seconds.
"Green Mountains without Ink and Thousand Years of Paintings, Green Water and No Strings, Wan Guqin" was released in my country in 2004. "Scenery on the Frontier of the Motherland", one of which was shot at Mingshi River. In the photo below, there is one shot at the same location as the stamp, which is cut according to the proportion of the stamp.
Stay in Mingshi Yaju and enjoy the butler-style service. The butlers are very attentive, enthusiastic and thoughtful. They help carry luggage, send the battery car to the pier, and take a bamboo raft to swim Mingshi River and enjoy the beautiful scenery on both sides. The hotel provides bicycles, riding in the painting, enjoying the pastoral scenery.
Enjoy breakfast by the mountains and rivers, the free afternoon tea is rich in variety, free minibar drinks, dining coupons, and bonfire singing and dancing in the evening; it is also worth mentioning that we did not order green bamboo fish, and each ordered a steamed thousand Bone fish, steamed by the chef is very good, the taste is light, and the fish is tender.
Ming Shi Yaju is like a paradise, where people melt into the mountains and rivers, and the heart enters the picture scroll.

In the scenic area, you can also experience special activities such as the campfire meeting of the Zhuang people and the fishing boat singing at night, which is impressive. !
    But the service awareness needs to be strengthened. Once there are more passengers, it is obvious that the coping ability is insufficient. Except for the little brother butler who is very nice, the other *******s, I can only talk about retraining. I spent a lot of money to enjoy the service , I‚Äôm not here to spend the night on my way. Please figure it out. Putting two hotels with different levels of consumption together is already a problem. If the service is the same or worse, why should I come here? Please pay attention to the management of the hotel. Don‚Äôt think that it doesn‚Äôt matter if the business is good now. The service industry is based on word of mouth, especially for rooms with an asking price of more than 2,000. We really need to train you female employees in service meaning and ability!

msg:üå≥Environmental introduction: Chongzuo is a border city adjacent to Vietnam. On the way to Detian Waterfall, there is a Mingshi pastoral scenic spot, and Mingshi Yaju Landscape B&B is one of the high-end B&Bs here.

üè†Layout/room type: There are not many rooms in the homestay, there are waterfront rooms, star vacancies, and 180-degree views of the swimming pool. My room is a room on the third floor adjacent to the water. The room is big and has an outdoor pool.

üíÅ Facility services: 1. The housekeeper responds to any requests in the WeChat group and responds quickly. 2. The price of the room includes a 160 yuan dinner coupon. 3. Breakfast is a set meal, combining Chinese and Western, but the taste is average, especially there is no snail noodles that Guangxi must eat. 4. The lighting in the room is too dim, if you want to read a book, it's not enough. 5. There is no bathtub in the room, the one outside is full of dust. 6. The outdoor swimming pool is not constant temperature, and it is relatively shallow. It is estimated that the function for posing is relatively large. 7. The price of the room includes a tour of a bamboo raft, but the bamboo raft feels quite broken, and I still need to share a boat with others, so I didn't play.

üèùTIPS for surrounding tours: You can go to the largest waterfall in Asia within 40 minutes by car. In addition, Mingshi Pastoral Garden itself is an attraction, you can enter and exit at will with the room card. By the way, remember to look up at the stars at night, you can see a lot of stars.
Overall, the price is still not worth it. In terms of details, it almost makes sense. If it's around 1500, I'd think it's okay.

msg:For northerners, it is definitely a treasured niche tourist destination in Guangxi. The disadvantage is that there is nothing to go to the surrounding scenic spots except Detian Waterfall and Mingshi Pastoral where the hotel is located. If you go to Detian to stay for a while, this is the first choice. There is no need for a strategy. It is a very good hotel. The room landscape service is very good, the housekeeper Lin Lin is thoughtful and enthusiastic, and will reply to any needs as soon as possible. Because of the Beihai epidemic, the route was temporarily changed so that the itinerary would not be monotonous. If the time is not rich, there is no need to consider the best choice for two nights in Mingshi Pastoral. On the wild side, it's really a photo cheat series. In addition to photos, other things are really cost-effective. The reason why I talk about it here is that many family trips should be similar to our strategy. In fact, if you only have two nights in Chongzuo, Mingshi Pastoral is very suitable, and there is no need to change hotels. The bedding is very good, the sleep is comfortable, the room is spacious and the view is super beautiful!

The only thing I want to improve is that the lights in the room can be brighter at night, but it may be the design of the decoration style! Everything else is fine! There are meal coupons every day, so it's a good deal to eat at the restaurant! There are also bamboo rafts, bicycle rides, afternoon tea and snacks, fruits, and desserts in the evening. In short, you will not be hungry for a day, and you can‚Äôt eat it with one mouth, hahaha

msg:The environment is good, the room is generally good, and it is still OK as a B&B. But the service is really disappointing. After all, the room is around 2,000 a day. We hope to arrange a sightseeing bus to take us out to eat. The first thing the front desk said is that there is food nearby. Why do you want to go out to eat? ? (Do we still need to ask for instructions where to eat?), we expressed that we still wanted to go out to eat, and the front desk said that since you are going to consume, you can call the restaurant to pick you up? (Full of questions?? It means that if we stay in a room, it is not consumption? What kind of logic?) In the end, we said that we still wanted to go out to eat and hoped to arrange a car to deliver it. However, we were told that the driver had gone out to eat and could not be delivered. (This is just a joke. ?) Let‚Äôs talk about check-out. After staying in two rooms for two nights, I checked out. Frankly speaking, in the slightly higher-end resort hotels and B&Bs nowadays, there is no room check. You just put the room card at the front desk and you can leave. Forget about the ward rounds. After checking for a long time, I suddenly asked where the mouthwash cup was. ? Do you think we can still like a mouthwash cup from you? (Then he said that the person who checked the ward did not look carefully and found it)
Frankly speaking, I would only stay in a place like this once. The price charged is the price of a mid-to-high-end B&B, and the service is at the level of a mountain farmhouse.

There is a river in front of the court, as well as a swimming pool and a gym. The price includes a bamboo row tour for two people, a full meal (lunch or dinner), afternoon tea, breakfast and good night milk. The room is very big, we chose to live on the 3rd floor with elevator. The equipment and facilities are very new and of high quality. The attitude of the waiters is very good, but the details are a little lacking. For example, after the butler added WeChat, he did not provide basic information, including the WiFi password, the butler‚Äôs commuting time (the butler only works at 8 o'clock), how to visit the neighborhood, etc. We responded after asking.
It's the first time to travel to Chongzuo, Guangxi. I don't know the pastoral scenery here is so beautiful. I have a chance to come again in the future.

Breakfast can be delivered to the room. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the ingredients or the chef‚Äôs. The dining and the hotel‚Äôs positioning do not match, so it‚Äôs not delicious.

As a health resort hotel, it is originally located in a remote area. The quality of the food and beverage in the hotel determines whether it can retain guests and attract guests twice. For non-scenic hotels, the highest room rate does not exceed 500. If Mingshiyaju Hotel only relies on It is not worth choosing the scenery to sell for three times or four times the price.

The tall and thin brother who was received that day was diligent, no matter the restaurant or the hotel service, he has his presence, and the outstanding staff is worthy of praise.
It is worth complaining that the bicycle rental service ends at 17:30, which happens to be the best time to take pictures of the sunset. This place has a Southeast Asian climate and the sun is very toxic for most of the day. Only early in the morning and evening are suitable for going out. It happened to be 17:30 after getting ashore from Zhupai, so he didn't provide bicycle rental service, so he had to walk around. When the sun goes down, it will be around 6:30~7:00. The bicycle rental time is missed the most beautiful time.
In addition, the room facilities are the high-end version in the homestay, but the charge is comparable to a five-star luxury hotel. The price of one night is enough to stay in a five-star hotel in the center of Nanning for two nights. The price is relatively expensive.

msg:The newly opened one next door was so popular that I found the second most expensive Mingshiyaju in the neighborhood if I didn't book it. The butler‚Äôs WeChat contact is available before check-in, but the butler service still needs to be improved. The butler for docking is not fixed, and there will be information transfer problems. I stayed for two days. When I checked in on the first day, the room I took was different from the official picture I saw. The lady wearing glasses at the front desk was pretty good, and helped to solve it. The view of the fully transparent room with star rooms is still good. The other room I got before has basically no view, so there is no need to move in at the same price. The weather is good at night, you can see the stars, and the room is really bright at dawn. You must be mentally prepared for the sunrise. Toiletries are the standard L‚ÄôOccitane at this price, and milk in the minibar is a plus. The hair dryer is not so good. The room also prepared a small bottle of mosquito repellent. The general hygiene is good, and the staff can also be seen cleaning the swimming pool in the morning and wiping the dust from the railings at the heights. The bamboo rafts included are few people drifting, and the scenery is good, as well as explanations, tea and peanuts. The evening party is to pass the time. There are two things that are most unsatisfactory. One is the meal, the main meal is small, the combination of one meat, one soup and two vegetables, the taste is average, and the amount is not enough. For breakfast, if it‚Äôs a buffet, it‚Äôs above the pool. It‚Äôs a bit hot and there is not much room for choice. If the food is delivered to the room, the butler‚Äôs caliber is different. On the first day, it is said that it can be delivered to the room; when the next morning I think It was too hot and I wanted to deliver breakfast to the room, but I was slightly rejected...Although it was delivered in the end, I asked for a Western-style Chinese food, probably the goods are not complete. It is recommended that the room rate be higher, and the dinner and breakfast are both better for the guests... The second dissatisfaction is that the attitude of the staff seems to be a bit uneven. The swimming pool security guard, the handsome guy is extremely enthusiastic. It makes people happy when they come in and out to say hello. The other one is not enthusiastic and a bit fierce. The lady in glasses at the front desk is more thoughtful, and the other one is a little bit inactive. Very polite and enthusiastic. Overall, the price, the scenery and the environment are OK, and the service and catering are not shortcomings.

msg:It was a very scary night, and I really still have lingering fears. I am really speechless about the rejection of the hotel's non-refundable application. This is the case. After checking in at night, it rained and the power was cut off for a long time. The old man was ready to sleep. I went to turn off the lights. As a result, the switch conducts electricity, and the whole arm is suddenly numb, and the whole person is dumbfounded. He called the housekeeper to deal with it. Even if the switch was repaired, the whole person was still very scared. Because it was too late, the housekeeper told the manager to report to the manager to deal with it the next day. When I wake up in the morning, my fingers are still in a state of **. The hotel will not refund the rent, but will upgrade the room type. It's really bad. No one can accept the matter of being electrocuted. I don't know if there is any sequelae behind the arm. It must be defended to the end. The leakage phenomenon of such a high-priced hotel is really scary. And it's handled badly. I hope you can learn from whether you want to change hotels.
