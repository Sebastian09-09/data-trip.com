Please avoid it, my friends!

The 130-square-meter suite has a broken washbasin in both the master and guest bathrooms. The master bathroom does not run water, and the guest bathroom has a very small flow. There is no hot water in the shower, and the cold water flow is also small. The room service and engineering depar**ent are very slow to deal with it. It took more than an hour, and the sanitation was not cleaned in the end.

There is a KTV on the 22nd floor. You can clearly hear the singing upstairs in the bedroom at night. The windows are not sealed well, and the wind sound is like ghosts howling all night.

The duty supervisor and manager do not take action, do not care about the feedback of guests, the service is extremely poor, and the compensation plan is only to send breakfast and vouchers. The store is big and bullies customers.

I am ready to complain to the relevant management depar**ent of Jiexiu City, with videos, audios, and photos.

When leaving this hotel, taxi drivers said that they picked up guests in this rubbish hotel and often heard guests scolding them! Hanting is better than them!

1. Poor hygiene: Unknown hair was found on the bed

2. Poor service attitude and no professional ethics: It was already 11:30 pm when the hair was found. I asked to change rooms. At that time, the elderly were about to rest. I said I would find a clean room to sleep and not toss the elderly. As a result, the front desk said yes at first, but later said that she had no authority. The superior * manager required us to move. I scolded the front desk ** waiter and asked * manager to come and deal with it himself. As a result, the manager did not know where he went during working hours and came after 12 o'clock. He claimed that he did not know the series of operations of the front desk waiter. I don’t know who is lying on both sides.
3. There was a strong smell of smoke in the changed room, which once again proved that this hotel has poor hygiene!
4. When communicating with Ctrip customer service, the hotel lied to Ctrip again
5. The hotel room smells like paint, don't stay

I will complain to you slowly when I get home, 12315, Shanxi Culture and Tourism, People's Daily, let you become famous-the five-star hotel has serious hygiene problems, the interior decoration has strong toxic gases, from the management to the front desk, there is no professional ability and ethics, it makes guests upset and deceives the platform!

msg:The hotel opened a year ago, the hardware facilities are very good, and the environment is also very good. But the service at the front desk is too bad. I booked 6 rooms with my friends. After I paid the full price of the room, the front desk asked me to pay another 5,000 yuan deposit, and there were no consumer goods in the room. After negotiation, I paid a deposit of 3,000 yuan. I was hesitant to have a dinner at the hotel in the evening, so I asked the front desk if I could put it on the room account. The front desk promised me that it was okay. But when I checked out after dinner, I couldn't put it on the room account because the deposit I paid was not enough. We only had 1106 dinner in total. How could it be not enough! So I planned to complain, and the restaurant negotiated with the front desk again. Later, a manager came to coordinate. First, he apologized and didn't want me to complain, but he still had to pay the dinner fee first. It was already late, so I didn't want to waste time, so I paid the dinner fee. To apologize, the manager said that he would send us a piece of fruit in each room. I looked at the reservation form, and it included a piece of fruit when I booked it. After looking at my order, the manager changed his words and said that he would send a piece of fruit to each room the next morning. When I checked out this morning, I didn't see any more fruit. I don't really care about fruit, but the service of this hotel is really disappointing. And the round desk in the room is not solid at all, it shakes when you touch it lightly. I can't imagine that the quality of this five-diamond hotel is like this!

However, as a new hotel, the hardware maintenance is very different from that of a five-star hotel: the bathroom fixtures and basins are all dirty. After staying for two days, I saw that the towels were useless the next day. They were spread on the countertop and were not cleaned or rearranged. Replenish.

The breakfast is all Chinese-style, with a lot of varieties. However, as an international five-star hotel, there are not many Western-style meals, which is still unsatisfactory. The parking lot is not small, and there is a ba*****t, but there is no sign in the ba*****t leading to the hotel lobby. We went around twice and finally found an elevator location that the staff asked about. The hotel waiters are all smiling and very enthusiastic. The price of less than 500 during the National Day holiday is so worth it.

I worked "overtime" all night to control mosquitoes. I couldn't stand it anymore and left two remaining mosquito corpses on the bedside table. It was a very tiring business trip.

I was celebrating the Chinese New Year, and I was very upset when I encountered such a run-down hotel when I first arrived in Jiexiu. Originally I chose five stars just for the service and cleanliness. After all, the living standards of today’s residents are comparable to these housing prices. But I didn't expect that only the lobby manager had a good attitude during the whole process. The first time I asked the front desk if I could check in, I was told "Can't do it, the room is full" and was told back. The front desk didn't even have basic polite words. You can watch the surveillance. Let’s not talk about it if we are also rude or bossy. Let’s not talk about the service industry. At least we are mutually beneficial. There are other service-related issues that I won’t list here one by one. There are very few comments, which is really frustrating. No appeal, no need to reply. I just want to give feedback. Since I have chosen to be a hotel, I will do it well. If it doesn't matter, just treat the opinions and suggestions of the masses as nothing and ignore them.

msg:There is such a hotel in a place like Jiexiu that people are willing to stay in. However, the lack of software and hardware makes the experience very bad. I am not satisfied and will not come back in the future. I do not recommend it. First of all, when I checked in, I asked if the gym and swimming pool were open. The answer was that it was not open because the weather was too cold. But what does the gym have to do with the cold weather? The front desk looked unhappy and just said two words and didn't open it. After reading other reviews, I found that it has not been open since it opened, but both of these items are written on the page. This is a direct lie and not appropriate. Second, the size of the restaurant is obviously not proportional to the number of guest rooms. The seating in the restaurant is like that of a fast hotel, which means that once the rooms are half occupied, the reception capacity is limited. An hour after the food was collected, there was nothing. It was empty. It was served very slowly and there was no food at all. During the Spring Festival, all the rooms are sold out, but can’t we prepare in advance? Having no place to live has to do with hardware, and having nothing to eat has to do with these preparations and services. It's really bad. The price/performance ratio is too low. Not recommended
Facilities: Average!
Service: Poor
