msg:Environment: The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is quite quiet, and the parking lot is relatively sufficient. Unfortunately, there are no tram charging stations, and the fragrance in the hotel lobby is a bit overwhelming.
Facilities: The shower water in room 1311 is not hot and the bathtub cannot drain properly. After the master came, he tried several times and finally pulled out the plug before slowly entering the water, but there were problems with hot water and water pressure.
Can't be solved.
Service: When I checked into the hotel in the afternoon, only the staff wearing housekeeping clothes and the day shift front desk greeted me. There were a bunch of hotel staff standing at the door, as if they were waiting to pick up some important person, and no one greeted me politely. (The night shift front desk sounded very perfunctory) I called the housekeeping phone first and the elder sister quickly brought the master to help me check the room problem. After finding that the problem could not be effectively solved, I asked the elder sister to contact the front desk to change rooms. After I contacted the front desk via landline, the front desk asked what to do? The front desk told me to ask the housekeeper to take me to a room directly, and just let the front desk know when I have changed my room. After I told the housekeeping lady, she said: I still need the front desk to help me find out which room to change to. She didn't know which room was occupied and which was unoccupied (the front desk dealt with question 1 perfunctorily).
I said, can I call the front desk again? The housekeeping lady said she would come and started calling the front desk via the intercom, explaining my need to change rooms. She repeated it about three times before the front desk responded: Got it! After a while, the front desk only replied: There are no guests staying in the same room type now. (Question 2 is handled perfunctorily at the front desk). My face dropped at that time: Is such a big hotel fully occupied? Can't I change the room type if I don't have the same room type?
The housekeeping lady saw that I was unhappy and asked if there were any other room types. Only then did the front desk say: 1309. The eldest sister immediately took me to see 1309. When I entered the bathroom, I entered the bathroom first. There were non-hair-type hairs and some debris in the bathtub. The water in the bathtub was also slower, and the water pressure and temperature in the shower room were better. The eldest sister asked me to clean the bathtub for me, but I said don’t bother me at this late hour. When I came out, the elder sister asked the front desk if there were any other rooms? The front desk told me that the rooms at the end of the two floors on 11/12 (I don’t know if the occupancy rate is so full that only these two rooms at the end can be exchanged?), I said I didn’t want the end room, and then I asked the front desk. After looking at 9003, I saw stains in the bathtub of 9003. The eldest sister suddenly remembered that there was a disposable bathtub cover. We finally decided to save trouble and switch to 1309.
After the actual check-in, the water in the 1309 shower room was abnormal again, and the fibers of the bath towel were also seriously peeled off. As a result, I lay down and didn't get up to take a shower again, and finally fell asleep after 2 o'clock.
After leaving the hotel directly after leaving the room card at the front desk at around 5 o'clock this morning, I received a call back from the hotel manager at around 7:50, apologizing and refunding part of the room fee.

msg:During the May Day holiday, the hotel cost 1100 yuan per night, but there were a lot of problems, not as good as a chain hotel. 1. The room was not cleaned properly, and a cigarette butt was seen in the shower area. 2. The hotel made false claims, and the gym was not open at all. They took the renderings as actual photos and said on the platform that they had a gym. 3. When I returned to the hotel at 8 pm, I was told that the laundry room would be closed at night, and I could only pay an expedited fee to wash clothes. 4. The window of the guest room was stuck, maybe I didn’t know how to close it, and I couldn’t close it no matter what I did 🙃 The hotel is too cheap, I am really speechless!!!

msg:Compared with the hotels I have stayed in in the past, this hotel is the worst! The process is as follows:
1. When I just checked in, the room was very unhygienic, with all kinds of residues on the carpet (according to the hotel waiter, the carpet is not vacuumed every day or for every guest, but regularly, and I don’t know how long it is regularly). There are also dirty paper towels left by previous guests on the carpet, and the quilt is covered with carpet hair. After calling to report the situation, the waiter came to the door and changed a room.
2. After changing the room, there are still a lot of residues on the carpet, but not as much as the previous room, so I thought about it and gave up. At about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was ready to rest and wanted to turn off the lights, but I couldn’t turn off the lights in the closet (the closet has no door, and the light can just shine on the bed in the guest room). At night, the room was particularly bright after other lights were turned off, which affected my sleep (of course, except for those who like to sleep in a bright state).
3. I wanted to turn off the air conditioner at night, but I didn’t succeed in turning it off. I pressed the air conditioner on and off key, but there was no response, and the air conditioner was still on. It’s really hard. I originally booked for 2 days, but I checked out early and left angrily. I spent 5-star money, but got the service of a fast hotel.
4. At around 10pm, the closet light could not be turned off, so I went to the front desk. No one responded for half an hour. I went downstairs to the front desk and got angry. Two engineers came more than 10 minutes later. It was around 22:40. They said the light was inductive, but it was on all night. If it was a night light, it was too high and dazzling. That night, I basically couldn't sleep.
5. Let's talk about the restaurant. In order to strengthen the service, the hotel hired some aunt-level waiters. During the dinner buffet, the aunt will stand not far from you and stare at your plate. As soon as you finish eating, she will take the plate away immediately. The attitude is worthy of praise, but if the service is excessive, it will make people feel uncomfortable.
5. Where did Ctrip's 5-point rating come from? It is unknown whether it hired a water army. I hope Ctrip will strictly control it and not cheat!

msg:This is a newly opened hotel, the grade is not low, the price is not cheap, let's talk about the advantages first: 1. The staff in the lobby are friendly and greet us warmly. 2. We came early and checked in in advance, and helped us with the luggage. Let's talk about the disadvantages. 1. The main sanitary conditions are worrying. There are dust and stains everywhere. The bed, the countertop, and the glass next to the bathtub are all stained. Although no one is staying, they must be kept clean every day to ensure the hygiene of the guests when they check in. 2. The staff who answered the phone at the front desk did not speak standard Mandarin and could not understand Mandarin, so communication was difficult. 3. The lighting design of the toilet has problems. It is voice-controlled. It keeps on flashing when there is a little movement. I didn't sleep well all night. 4. The curtains are not good for blackout. It gets light early here. It's bright early, which affects sleep. 5. The glass door of the toilet conflicts with the wooden door outside when it is opened. It is very dangerous. I don't know what the designer thought at the time. 6. The bathtub does not have a movable shower. I don't know how the waiter cleans the bathtub. Anyway, I think it is inconvenient to rinse, otherwise I need to take a basin to collect water to rinse. 7. The double bed room is still a little small. After putting a work table, the aisle is a little narrow, which affects the passage. 8. There is a small meter in the room, but it is not very sensitive. Simple actions such as opening and closing curtains and turning off lights are not easy to complete, which is quite annoying. 9. The breakfast is average, and the dishes are not outstanding. The height limit for children is quite strict. If they are over 120 cm, they are strictly required to pay. Overall, it is average, not worth so much money for one night, and it is not like the service of a star hotel. It needs to be improved.

msg:The hotel just opened, and it feels like it opened before it is ready. It may be that they are unwilling to give up the traffic during the May Day Golden Week. I booked it because there is a swimming pool, but the swimming pool is still under construction. This situation should be stated on the booking page, otherwise it will be very disappointing (so I only gave it three stars for the facilities).

The service is fine, five-star service, five-star praise. I checked in early on the first day (more than 6 o'clock in the morning), and there was no difficulty. I also got an extra breakfast. The breakfast was good, the mousse was delicious, and the black bread was also delicious.

There is a piano in the lobby, but you are not allowed to play it. I played it twice because I was itchy, and was driven away 😂

In addition, the hotel has just been renovated, and the smell in the room is still quite strong. The windows can only be opened a little, and the ventilation effect is limited. The air is a bit poor (so I only gave it four stars for the environment). It is recommended to equip each room with an air purifier with activated carbon.

Although I complained a lot and didn't give it full stars, these are problems in the early opening period, and it should not be difficult to solve. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Weihai, and I hope these problems will be solved by then.

msg:The prices were all going up during the May Day holiday, and seeing that other hotels were also quite expensive, I thought I was being ripped off anyway, so I spent a little more money to have a good experience, but I was quite disappointed.
Pros: Good service attitude, the hardware looks OK, and a normal high-end hotel should have it.
Cons: I'll just say the key points, I hope the store can pay attention to correct it.
1️⃣ The hotel's lighting control system has a big problem, the lights in the cloakroom are automatically sensed, and they light up after the lights are turned off at night. The most exaggerated thing is that all the lights in the room were turned on twice in the early morning. The initial guess is that a sensor was triggered, but the logic of this program is wrong. The user's manual control should be the highest instruction. Change it as soon as possible. If the customer is a little superstitious or neurasthenic, I don't know how many times you will be complained about this.
2️⃣ Although the glass door of the bathroom has the prompt word "pull", it can be pushed. If you push it accidentally, it will hit the person who is using the bathroom. Adding a limiter can solve the problem. I don't know why it was not considered in advance.
3️⃣ The house is half-made intelligent. If I hadn't seen other people's reviews, I wouldn't know that Xiaodu is used. The hotel was renovated in 2024, and the TV is still the same configuration as the set-top box. It can't cast the screen. Most of the content is live TV. This is really not as good as those fast hotels.

In short, it was quite disappointing. The overall experience is not worth the price

msg:The hotel lights kept turning on automatically in the middle of the night and turned off countless times, which made it impossible for me to sleep. I couldn't find a place to turn off the lights automatically, so I couldn't sleep all night. The drainage of the hotel shower room was very poor. After taking a shower, the bathroom floor was full of water. I ordered medicine at night, but the delivery man was not allowed to deliver it. I had to go downstairs to get it myself, and no one was responsible for the delivery.

msg:The worst experience! Barely one!
There was no hot water that night, and the shower drain was blocked. I called twice before someone came to deal with it. At midnight, when the engineering depar**ent came to deal with it, the customer service did not say to arrange a room change.
After tinkering, the water on the floor of the bathroom was not taken care of. A customer service lady brought three mats to lay at the door and the floor. There was also water accumulation in most areas that was not dealt with. It was impossible to enter!
The next morning, I washed up, but there was still no hot water!
This is a hotel in Weihai that costs 1,000 yuan a night. The price increase during holidays is tolerated, but what about your service?

msg:The hotel is very new. I stayed for two nights. The next day, I came back and there was no cleaning. I have never encountered this in other hotels. I put a new plate of fruit and the trash can was not cleaned. This is a bad review! The hotel is very new, but anyone can enter the elevator and the deliveryman can also press the elevator to the room. The safety is generally bad. The overall service attitude is OK, and the breakfast environment is OK. It is just that the internal management and staff training of the newly opened hotel need to be paid more attention. The location is not far from Hanlefang. The basic standards of this price should be met.

msg:A newly opened hotel with good facilities (hard power is sufficient) and service concept (soft power is a bit poor). There is really no harm without comparison. I thought all hotels in Weihai were like this: I wanted to turn on the air conditioner because the weather was hot, but I was told that it was not the day to turn on the air conditioner, so I could only use a fan... Fortunately, it was much better when I opened the window the next night, although the street was a bit noisy. But the room was still like a "steamer" during the day. Maybe the hotel asked guests to go out and play in such good weather and not waste time in the room. It was really thoughtful. The breakfast bartender on the 3rd (cannot be evaluated). I feel that all the staff of this hotel are very enthusiastic and motivated because it has just opened. But it is indeed lacking in effective overall coordination and management, and there are all kinds of chaos (room card demagnetization, small shower water flow, and reported problems are not solved). It is understandable that it is newly opened. On the third day of coming to Weihai, I decisively changed to other hotels on the list. There is really no harm without comparison!

msg:It was my first time in Weihai. I spent a long time to choose this newly opened hotel. The hotel is priced very high in Weihai. As a result, I found that the hotel was not ready for business at all after checking in. It should be because it opened hastily to catch up with the May Day tourist season. Whether it is facilities or service, I am not satisfied. The room is very dirty. There are scum on the carpet, black footprints in the bathtub, a thick layer of white ash on the table, and two body hairs on the quilt. I found that the room was not cleaned well when I entered the room, so I went to the front desk to change the room. As a result, the other room was the same. There was no bathtub. There was an older sister and uncle on the floor who were trying to vacuum and clean. After knowing the situation, the older sister tried her best to appease our emotions and said that she would definitely satisfy the service. The older sister's attitude was not bad. I called the front desk and told them that the hygiene of the changed room was still as bad. The front desk hung up before we could express it completely. The service is hard to describe. The bathroom door and toilet door in the bathroom are also useless. The picture is the ash on the living room table, or after wiping it.
