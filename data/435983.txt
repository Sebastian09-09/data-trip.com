Thanks so much to the service team especially Leo he managed  everything perfectly for our special requests‚Ä¶

Outstanding few from the mountain over whole Yalong Bay plus Ocean can be enjoyed directly out of the room pool‚Ä¶.

Amazing to watch the sky and the ocean and because it is on top of the mountain it is not hot and you can enjoy very welcome breeze of fresh forest air‚Ä¶

Excellent and enjoyable trip with great service 

we will do it again and again and again 

see u soon

Just didn‚Äôt like the part that there was a 1k deposit and the only option was payment at hotel instead of charged to credit card in my home currency so I was charged service fee and also the jacuzzi is in a very exposed area where people could walk by

msg:I do not understand all the positive reviews. One of the worst experiences I ever had.
1) Pool in our part of the hotel was closed. No comment, no apologies.
2) Cameras are everywhere! Even pointing at your bed through the window from outside. 1984, Jungle version.
3) It is hard to see online, but the ressort stretches over miles with different mini resorts that are all connected via minibuses. That means you wake up to the noise and pollution of old diesel engines every day.
4) What are the doing to the animals in the zoo? This is pure cruelty for no reason. Also, who the **** would paint an Alpaka? 
Never again

msg:I really wanted to love this hotel, but several things made the experience pretty unenjoyable. I appreciate that the hotel is located in China, but it is in a major international tourist destination and advertises itself as the premium destination in Sanya, and it was very clear upon arrival and throughout the stay that the hotel is aimed to cater for Chinese-speakers. This, combined with a range of other issues means that I would not recommend this hotel, especially not to non-Chinese speakers, 2/5.

I booked this hotel to get away for a few days, be on a mountain side with a beautiful view over the nearby towns and beaches. However, due to the size of the area, all transport within the resort is done by small buses which drive around on the roads, so if you want to go anywhere, you must budget 15-30 minutes for waiting and transport. It means that the serenity is broken around 7 am when the buses start driving up and down the mountain side. The buses mostly drive in first gear, and a very loud whining from them can be heard constantly.

Upon arrival, there were four staff at the main desk, only two of which seemed busy, but the other two just kind of stared for a while, which is common for Europeans to experience in China, but ideally not at a five star resort. Eventually, I was able to check in, but the information given was all in Chinese. This is obviously fair, since the resort is in China, but the site is huge and there are many important details, so it would have been nice to get some kind of booklet or even a small video in English to help make sense of the place. 

When checking in, I was asked to pay a deposit of 8000 RMB, which was more than what I paid for the booking itself (around 6800 RMB). This amount of money could have broken the budget of a holiday and the fact that it was not loudly advertised when booking felt like a rip off. Naively, I thought that it would somehow be used to pay for things in the resort, but I was still asked to pay for dinner after eating at the (very tasty but a bit pricey) Thai restaurant on site. 

The villa was a 15-minute bus ride from reception and was very nice, with a large outdoor bathtub, bed covered in a mosquito net, and a lovely balcony. Unfortunately, the view was obscured by trees and bushes, but it did feel very private. The facilities in the villa were fine, but the shower drain was clogged, and it was not fixed when I asked for it to be fixed on the first day.

Breakfast was an easy walk from the villa and delicious with an amazing view, which was a very nice experience.

The facilities were a mixed bag, the gym was very basic but with an amazing view. The outdoor pools were not heated , but there was a nicely heated indoor pool. There is a beer bar on top of the mountain with a good selection and amazing view, but quite high prices. This bar is supposed to close at 22 each night, but it was closed when I tried to go at 20:30 on the first night. All these facilities are about 20 minutes minibus drive plus 5-10 minutes waiting from the villa/breakfast area.

The resort hosts the Bobo cute animal petting zoo, which unfortunately borders on animal abuse. There are meercats and other social animals in tiny glass cages, which were clearly trying to escape and seemed highly stressed. There were birds that seemed to have collars implanted in their chests. There was a baby pig living in a tiny glass pen. There was an alpaca with a spray-painted coat that looked like a giraffe, which guests were allowed to pull around by a collar around its neck. There was a tiny dog at the entrance of the "zoo" which was shivering and very non-responsive when touched. All in all, this "zoo" left a very bad taste in my mouth and I do not want to come back.

When checking out, only about 1200 RMB was returned from my deposit. Despite having paid for the stay on Trip, the hotel still deducted the cost of the stay from my deposit, and I had to contact them myself to get the full deposit back.

This is our fourth time in Sanya, but our first time to visit Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park. We stayed at the Bird's Nest and chose a room with a sea view on the top of the mountain. The scenery was unbeatable. The children had a lot of fun. It was a pleasant weekend of three days and two nights. The children went to the Cute Pet Park twice and loved the small animals there. The infinity pool was unbeatable. It felt very comfortable to come in the off-season. The service was also very good. I look forward to going again next time. Happy memories.

msg:I stayed in my favorite Eagle area again. This time I stayed in Room 01. The room had a wide view, overlooking the coastline, and close to the suspension bridge. It was very close to the swimming pool and the observation deck. As soon as I walked into the room, the warmth of the wooden furniture and the coolness of the air conditioner that was turned on in advance washed away the heat and fatigue, and I felt relaxed like returning home.
There are also many activities. Rainforest rafting and high-altitude zipline brought us surprises. In the evening, when the tourists dispersed, walking on the Lover's Cable Bridge and blowing the sea breeze was also a different taste.
The buffet breakfast is different every day. The freshly made wontons are tender and delicious. The fresh Hainan marinated powder is free to add ingredients. The salt and pepper prawns are not addictive yet. The King Kong wax apple is so delicious! Lunch is dessert, fruit and milk. Dinner is Chinese food in a Thai restaurant. Roast chicken, lettuce wrapped with minced meat, and curry vegetables are delicious. It is not cheap after using the discount coupon, but fortunately the environment is first-class. Listening to Filipino artists singing moving old songs and taking pictures of the sunset from the perfect balcony position is also an excellent experience.
Service is still the biggest plus point of the Bird's Nest. Whether it is the handsome uncles who are responsible for the pool and the diligent and humorous car drivers, they all left a deep impression on us. The most important thanks to Ms. Wang Hui at the front desk, who felt very kind at first sight, like Mr. Lin, the Chinese teacher of the eldest brother. Wang Hui helped us arrange and change rooms very carefully, suggested itinerary activities, and arranged the "express delivery to the mountain" service for small items. She was considerate and warm like an old friend who had known each other for a long time.

The tropical rainforest forest park has a pleasant climate. It is warm during the day and cool in the morning and evening. The light rain in the afternoon every day adds a touch of fairyland to the valley. The forest park is biodiverse. We can see flowers, butterflies, and insects around us. We are also fortunate to have close contact with monkeys, snakes and tree lizards.

The Bird's Nest is really a paradise on earth, with beautiful scenery, warm people, and interesting stories. I think I will come again!

msg:At the beginning of the second trip of the Bird's Nest Resort, we moved to the Genting Resort and stayed in the Genting Eagle Full Sea View Villa. The sea view there is invincible, and it is completely different from the previous Peacock Tree House. The Peacock Tree House has more tropical rainforest green plants, and this Genting Eagle Villa is really facing the sea and backed by green mountains.

The room of Genting Eagle feels much more advanced, and it is already very much like the style of a trial wedding room. Isn't it very artistic to take a bath in the terrace bathtub looking at the sea? ! The bedding and bath products have been upgraded. Eat breakfast here, or call them to pick you up by car. Go to the mountaintop park to play, go to breakfast, and call a car to pick us up. They should have a powerful dispatch center, otherwise we, the guests who stay, will not be sent in and out so quickly.

In the next two days, we went to the Cliff Tianchi to swim. The scenery of the Cliff Tianchi is too invincible. Every stone and every tree is a scenery. It is a mobile phone killer (no memory).

Finally, I want to say that the service staff of the resort are very good. First of all, Manager Sun, who contacted me by phone, has been caring about me on WeChat. If there is anything, I will call her voice, and she will help me solve it every time. The service staff in the restaurant is also great. My hand was burned, and they helped me apply the burn oin**ent very promptly. The room service staff also boiled water for us and left a warm little note.

It is truly a paradise on earth. I will definitely come back for a second visit next time. It is so comfortable. ! Ôøº

I stayed in the rainforest. There was a special battery car guarantee, which was different from the tourist area, so the experience was very good. It was very convenient to go to various attractions, there were many things to play, and there were many choices for meals. Overall, I highly recommend it and have stayed here many times.

The building is completely round, the room has excellent tea, coffee, kettle, hairdryer, bathrobes, slippers. Round bed. Terrace with excellent view, mini bar. View pool overlooking the bay. The staff through Alipay helped with ordering transfers around the hotel and park
 Thank you very much to Tan, who helped with everything. The hotel price includes a visit to the park, glass and rope bridge. We stopped by after lunch, there was practically no one on the bridge. I definitely recommend it.

The hotel covers the entire forest park. You can go to any location of the hotel at any time. You can make an appoin**ent for the hotel sightseeing bus. The hotel's dispatch of vehicles is very scientific, because I use the car every time! It's also beautiful to take pictures. The only thing I can't stand is that there are too many birds, and they get up too early, but the advantage is that they wake me up to watch the sunrise. I like it üòç

I received a call from Manager Sun of the hotel's guest depar**ent the day before, asking about the check-in requirements and helping us upgrade the room type. He was very warm and thoughtful. The hotel is in the mountains, and the hotel shuttle bus is used for transportation, which is very convenient. The room is spacious and comfortable, facing the mountains, and the air in the morning is particularly good. This room package also includes scenic area tours, cable bridges, glass plank roads, non-2 room visits, etc. The itinerary is very fulfilling.
The next day we also experienced travel photography. The photographer was very patient when taking pictures. Even if the weather was very hot, he didn't get tired of instructing us how to pose. The photos were very beautiful. It was really different from being professional. It was a very good experience.
Thank you for the warm and thoughtful service of this hotel. Whenever you encounter problems, you can deal with them in time. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Sun of the guest depar**ent. When we checked in, we always cared about our stay experience and gave us tickets for rainforest rafting. The first rafting was from the middle of the mountain. It was exciting and fun. I recommend everyone to try it!

From the hotel check-in to the room, you need to drive a mountain road. The altitude is about 300 meters. There are also wooden stairs. It's easy to walk, and it takes about five minutes to get from the hotel car to the room. The room also includes tickets, you can check in If You Are the One and walk on the rope bridge. It rained one day and I regretted not taking the glass plank road. Special thanks to Manager Xu Zhigan for this trip. He gave us seven-star service from before check-in to after check-in, and gave us fruits, mineral water and exquisite afternoon tea. He also arranged for us to visit other room types and knew how many hours we had. Some of our friends who were unwell arranged a special car to take us around the most beautiful roads in Sun Bay, which made the whole trip more complete. It's Women's Day, it would be perfect if the hotel provided a rose service for everyone!

The hotel was very firm and refused to refund. Later, we changed to a sealed room. There were no large reptiles in the room, but there were so many cockroaches and mosquitoes that we dared not turn off the lights for two nights. When we checked out on the third day, because we had to catch a flight, the hotel said that the meal would be served at 7:30, but there was no staff to fry eggs and cook noodles until 7:45. This is a five-star hotel! ! Everyone be careful! ! The eerie horror in the middle of the night! !

msg:It is a very fun resort. Come and stay here at Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park to have a more complete experience. It is especially suitable for children and families. There were no mosquitoes at the end of February, and they were completely eliminated. A squirrel came into the villa at the assembly area at night and bit open a woven bag we brought with us. However, the little guy didn't steal any snacks, so his work was in vain. There is no hole in the room. I don‚Äôt know how I got in now, but don‚Äôt be afraid. There is a mosquito net and no one will be bitten. No matter where you go, a bit of driving is unavoidable. After all, it is such a big mountain. The villas are scattered in different areas. The gathering place is far away from the western restaurant where you can have breakfast and dinner. When checking in, scan the QR code on customer service WeChat and send the shuttle bus and various items to WeChat. That said, it can be delivered relatively quickly. The shuttle bus takes hotel guests to various mountain attractions, so there is no need to squeeze into the tourist minibus shuttle bus. The VIP experience is quite enjoyable. There are two swimming pools on the mountain. The assembly area pool was not open. We went to Yunpeng Swimming Pool, which has an indoor heated pool and an outdoor infinity pool. The other cliff pool has a great view. Swimming seems like you are swimming to the sky. The weather is slightly cooler at the end of February. I am not afraid of the cold. I swam alone for a long time. There is an observation deck above the cliff pool. The swimming pool will be surrounded by tourists. Haha. The western restaurant has a great view, with mountains and sea views, and the natural oxygen bar is refreshing. Downstairs from the Western Restaurant is the Cute Pet Experience Center, which has alpacas, meerkats, pigs, lizards, guinea pigs, long-haired rabbits, and different varieties of docile cats that are very easy to pet. The experience is free and is better than the experience in a pet cafe. Children We can like it. The breakfast is quite rich. It is more Western-style and has more varieties than the Sofitel, Sheraton and other hotels I have stayed in Sanya before. The complimentary BBQ for dinner was enough for three people with small appetites. On the first day I was hungry and I added an extra pizza. On the second day, I ate some snacks in the scenic spot and it was enough for one meal in the evening. The scenic area is divided into Orchid Valley, Thousand Miles Umbrella, Mountain Top Park, etc. There are exciting projects such as zip lining and flying rafting. Staying in the hotel includes unlimited park tickets, a one-time glass plank road and a suspension bridge tour where You Are the One filming location, but you don‚Äôt need to Expect to take photos of the model suspension bridge, as the bridge is packed with people, at least that's the kind of passenger flow it was in late February. The overall experience of traveling with an elderly person is very good. There are many steps up and down the mountain, which can make you tired, especially if your legs and feet are not good. Thumbs up again for the service.

Breakfast is delicious and varied. There are also swimming pools (Infinity and thermal). You move around the territory by mini-buses.
The only thing was that we didn‚Äôt get the dinner right. We wanted to go to the buffet, but due to the lack of people we were offered to order from the menu. Everything is in Chinese, and we didn't quite understand what we were ordering. I wish there was at least some kind of translation.
Thank you very much again for a wonderful holiday! I recommend everyone to visit this wonderful hotel!

msg:Every time I come to Sanya, I stay in various sea view rooms. This time, I specially brought my baby to experience the feeling of a forest cabin.
1. The various room types of the hotel are scattered in the forest park, and I was entangled when booking a room. In the end, I chose the peacock room type with the most fairy tale cabin feeling. Because I brought the elderly with me, the front desk lady helped arrange room 5022, which is the closest to the Chinese restaurant and the least walk, so I can see a little bit of the sea. The environment and sanitation are very good. There are a few small flying insects in the room at night, but there is no problem with mosquito nets. The next morning, a gecko ü¶é fell from the sink and was really scared.
2. The hotel gave me a package. Because the elderly are old, I asked the front desk to help me use my ID card to issue two sets of rainforest flying tickets. I took my baby to play twice, and the child was very happy. There are many small animals in the cute pet park. I bought a feed set. The children fed and interacted for a long time. The small animals are very cute.
3. The service of the hotel is really good. Whether it is the front desk reception or the housekeeper dispatch, every battery car brother I met, the waiter in the restaurant, and the young man in the cute pet park are warm and friendly, which is great!
4. The cost-effectiveness of staying in the resort when visiting the forest park is very high. After all, the official price of the two sets of tickets and the tour package is more than 700. And the playing time is very flexible. On the morning of the second day, the hotel battery car directly sent us to the mountaintop park to ride the rainforest flying drift. It was super cool without queuing.
5. The hotel gave away travel photography and creative images. At first, I didn't have any special expectations, so I just wanted to take some photos. I didn't expect that the photographer Xiaochuan was really good at taking pictures. The photos were very natural and he was very patient to interact with the children. The photos fully reflected the lively and agile characteristics of the children. And the photo editing was super fast. You can start selecting photos in less than ten minutes, which does not delay the trip at all.
6. Let me talk about the only aspect of this trip that I am not satisfied with. Dinner was in a western restaurant. I don't know if it was because the chef arranged less in the off-season, and the food was really slow. I waited for a long time for each dish. The child was no longer hungry, and he was unhappy to return the dishes that had not been cooked yet. The man at the next table also shouted that he would curse if the dishes were not served! However, the attitude of the waiter was very good from beginning to end, and I really couldn't bear to give a bad review.

Environment: It is located in a tropical jungle. Please imagine its beauty by yourself. It is wonderful. It avoids the noise from the neighbors next door to the hotel upstairs and downstairs. Friends who like quietness can buy it with their eyes closed. It is definitely worth the money.

Service: The hotel's service is very good. Even the cleaning staff are enthusiastic and responsive. The Thai restaurant inside is very good and worth a visit, especially if you are too lazy to go out for food after a day of fun. Also, the breakfast environment is greatüëç

In general, just place an order without thinking about anything! If you want to double the experience, you can choose a room with a swimming pool.
200 yuan dining voucher: The voucher is also given as a gift and can be used directly. There is no threshold, which is greatüëç
There are also tickets for the park, the rope bridge and the glass plank road, and everything you need to eat, drink and have fun. Will come again next year üëç

msg:The hotel is a delight! Careful attitude towards guests, desire to help! Manager Zhang li Hong - special thanks, he helped make our stay truly comfortable and memorable. The hotel is located in the Yalongwan Tropical Park, the houses are on the mountain, almost in the trees, very unusual. You live in the forest, very secluded. The territory is scattered throughout the park, travel by shuttle car, call a car to your destination via WeChat. Gorgeous views, especially impressed by the Infinity pool. Tickets for the suspension and glass bridge were included in your stay. There was also a voucher for dinner, the dinner set was amazingly delicious. The breakfast is gorgeous, one of the best we've ever had, and we've traveled a lot, including to luxury hotels. The room itself is very clean, unusual, cool cosmetics, heated mattress, aroma lamp. Everything for relaxation. Overall a top hotel, a very unusual experience! I highly recommend it. Among the additional entertainment in the park, be sure to ride a glass slide in a boat, which is exciting, and go down the zipline. One minus - they don‚Äôt speak English like everywhere else)

There is an infinity pool when you open the door. You can see the sea while lying down. It is very private. I started to worry about inconvenience or mosquitoes. It was completely unreasonable. I often see birds flying into the swimming pool. The scenery in the breakfast western restaurant and Thai restaurant is also great. Especially when the sun sets, the Thai restaurant must be experienced. Meal coupons are also given. It is really cheap to eat. Manager Sun, the butler The service was very considerate, and they also provided late check-out and fruits. When checking out, the customer service staff would help bring the luggage to the lobby for safekeeping. Then we went to the Cliff Tianchi for a half-day swim. Requesting a taxi was faster than expected, and it was no more than 10 minutes. ten minutes. The service of Forest Park is also very good and standardized. I will stay here again next time I go to Sanya.

The climate is pleasant during the day and there is no direct sunlightüåû. The mountains and rivers passing through are all brought with them by the gentle wind, which creates an attraction to this place. . The noisy cicada forest is more than quiet, and the bird singing mountain is even more secluded. The chirping of birds in the early morning and the fairy-like a**osphere on the top of the mountain give us a sense of isolation from the world when we live in the mountains. Of course, there will inevitably be small animals coming. The first person to meet me in the morning is A little gecko crawled and crawled on the ground. After being startled by me, it slithered away and hid without a trace. I was most afraid of this little guy in my life. Fortunately, I didn't step on it. We kept the necessary distance. Pack your luggage and see each other off in the misty mountains. Flying in the rainforest is an unforgettable experience. It is exciting and not considered an extreme sport, so it is very suitable for children. The hotel service is very good. There are shuttle buses everywhere. If you contact the service staff, you can have fun all the way. This time, except that your legs and feet are a little tired, it is really worth a second visit. The most exciting thing was the travel photography. Yesterday‚Äôs weather was so pleasant, not hot, not cold, it just happened to come at the right time. The photographer‚Äôs photography skills are superb, and the editing skills are even more outstanding. It took a long time to select the photos. , it‚Äôs hard to choose!

The location of Dayan is very good. The room is large and the view is wide. You can see the sea in the distance. But the bathroom, toilet and bathtub are semi-outdoor.
The next day, hotel guest manager Xiao Sun called to ask how her stay was. She told her that she was not used to living in a house with an outdoor bathroom, so she changed her room type to a Peacock room.
Peacock is a round house, 360 degrees of the house are used, and the windows are round. The terrace is also large, but the view is of the mountains.
Staying in each of these two room types for a day had pros and cons, and the experience was both good.
For dining, we went to both Thai and Western food. The scenery was good, the taste was good, and the price was a little expensive, but compared to taking the shuttle bus down the mountain to eat, these two places are good choices.
If you want to play in the park, you don‚Äôt need to buy tickets. The package comes with free tickets for the rope bridge and glass plank road. It‚Äôs great to experience them all.

After checking in, ask the hotel staff to pick up the dirty things in the swimming pool. Just pick them up! ! !
The table in the room still has oil stains on the open thread, and the sofa is also stained (no welcome gifts such as fruits)
The water in the shower room is small, and the hot water needs to be put in for a long time, and the hot water is not hot.
If the toilet is not cleaned thoroughly
The temperature difference between morning and evening is relatively large
Western restaurants are basically simple meals. It is not recommended to book a seafood barbecue set meal. They are all prepared and placed in an insulated box. You can just order a la carte. It is at the level of a fast food restaurant (the merchant will give you a voucher, so consumption is normal)
Thai restaurant, curry crab, etc. are normal products
Because you can only eat at these two restaurants when you go up the mountain.
The room price is more than 4,000, and children over 1.4 meters need to pay the full price. There are very few hotels like this. In many hotels in Sanya, two children are free.
In the name of If You Are the One‚Äôs location, just to experience it, I won‚Äôt stay here next time
The mountain view is pretty good, but the smell of exhaust fumes when I go out is really unbearable.

The hotel is located in the tropical paradise scenic area, and the villa landscape and facilities are well maintained. It's great to be able to build and operate it to this extent in the rainforest on the mountain. You don't have to worry about bugs when you stay in this season. The stay experience is very good.
The food in the hotel is very good, the breakfast buffet is rich, and the dining environment is unbeatable.

The hotel's cute pet paradise is a highlight and deserves special mention. The little animals in the park are carefully cared for and fed. The boy in charge of feeding, Ah Hong (pronounced homophonic), is super loving, and he is also super friendly and patient when receiving guests. Small animals have also become particularly approachable because of Ahong. I even hugged a meerkat, caught a snake, held a small hedgehog, and held a lizard in my hands. I couldn't even imagine it. ...I saw the little pig and the alpaca disguised as a giraffe once and played with them, it was so enjoyable. Every time I pass by, I can't help but go in and take a look. I am really grateful to Ah Hong for his reception and service, which added unexpected surprises and fun to this trip.

It is very convenient to stay in the hotel and visit the forest park. There are shuttle buses for transportation, and there are service staff to help when entering and leaving the hotel, so there is no inconvenience. The only thing is that if you stay in a villa on the mountain, you will inevitably have to walk up some stairs. Friends with limited legs and feet can consult when booking.

By the way, Tropical Paradise Park is well worth a visit and don‚Äôt miss the ropeway. The four-section ropeway is so exciting and fun, and it‚Äôs very cost-effective. highly recommended!

There are birds chirping in the early morning. It is super original. The peacock room is very airtight and there are no small animals encountered. Hahaha, the hotel‚Äôs cliff swimming pool is also very beautiful, and the little animals in the cute pet paradise are also very cute. The hotel has shuttle buses to various places, which is more convenient. The service staff here are really super nice and very enthusiastic. I walked through the room after dinner and was a little lost. I happened to meet the room manager Zhang. After he gave me directions, he called me not long after to confirm whether I was there or not. Returning to the room was really reassuring! I will stay here again next time! ! !

Our room is Peacock Room No. 19. We have to walk up a lot of steps for a day. My legs felt weak after two trips out. The service of the hotel is very good. The luggage is helped to be carried and there is a special device for carrying luggage. There are dedicated cars to and from the hotel and scenic spots. The overall feeling is very good, but there are really many people there.

I wanted to unsubscribe, but Ctrip came forward and Bird's Nest insisted that it was a victory. Haha, I was promoted to Peacock. I stayed at 5018 for two nights. I was very happy to have breakfast very close. I ordered seafood udon and fruit salad to be delivered to my room for dinner. I was very happy. I was forced to have Thai food delivered to my room for lunch the next day. I would like to thank the restaurant manager for meeting my personalized service needs. happy. The room was smoky and I slept soundly for two nights. I was happy. There was a buzzing sound in the room the next morning. It was quickly fixed. The female supervisor from Guizhou also gave me a fruit plate. I was happy. I checked out this morning. I originally wanted to postpone it. WeChat customer service Xiao Huang also approved the application. Seeing that the sky was cloudy and afraid of rain, he asked to check out at ten o'clock. WeChat customer service Xiao Huang also made arrangements immediately. The handsome porter from Wuzhishan's hometown was very considerate and helped me carry me. The huge suitcase also took care of me as I walked slowly. So, don‚Äôt be afraid of negative reviews. Others certainly didn‚Äôt lie, but I personally experienced it and it felt good. You can rest assured to stay a few more days next time. Thank you to all the staff at Bird's Nest, and thank you to Ctrip's beauty Banxia.

msg:The most satisfying hotel for a ten-day island tour, including almost all the projects in the Tropical Paradise Rainforest Park, it is impossible to finish it in one day.
Facilities: To be honest, the room facilities are definitely not the best among five-star hotels, but the scenery is really invincible. Living in Genting really feels like being above the colorful clouds. It overlooks Yalong Bay in the front and Haitang Bay in the back. Watching the sunset makes you feel relaxed and happy. . There are huge infinity swimming pools, both indoor and outdoor. The indoor one is a constant-temperature swimming pool. There are not many people there, and it feels like a private swimming pool. It‚Äôs so worth it.
Hygiene: average
Environment: Invincible
Service: I have to say that sitting in the hotel's special car in the park and looking at the large tour buses used by other tourists still feels very superior üòÇ The service attitude is also very good, the breakfast is rich, and it is so cool to have a meal with the beautiful scenery!
Overall, I feel that booking one night is too little. I will definitely stay a few more nights next time, and I must stay in a Yunpeng sea view room (no matter how high-end it is, it is too expensive and I can‚Äôt afford itü§£)

Yulin Feipiao: This one is better. I even made a video. It‚Äôs so creative. My 70-year-old father-in-law had a lot of funüòÉ

The overall experience is quite good, and the price is affordable. It mainly includes attraction tickets and several items, as well as Genting‚Äôs rich breakfast!

Although it is a resort on the mountain, there are pick-ups and drop-offs everywhere, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about climbing up and down. The accommodation fee includes park tickets, a glass bridge with panoramic sea views, a cable bridge across the river, and an optional dinner, which is really great value. The only regret is that it happened to be cooling down, so I gave up the planned photo tour at the cliff pool. It's a pityüòÅ. Another point is whether the bathroom door in the family room needs to be reorganized. It faces the big bed directly and is extremely cold.

msg:First of all, I think the name of the hotel can be changed. It should be called Hell on Earth. As a Ctrip Black Diamond member, I would like to tell everyone that you must not have a fluke mentality to stay in this hotel. I have experienced almost all resort hotels and five-star hotels in China. I dare say that theirs is the worst. I can no longer express it in words. I have written bad reviews for other hotels before, until I stayed at their hotel today. I immediately deleted the previous bad reviews because I suddenly felt that I seemed to have experienced their hotel, and the previous ones were nothing. It is not an exaggeration at all. At this point, you may just think that the hotel experience, price, hygiene, and service are not ideal. If you just think so, then I can only say that nonono is too simple. Let me tell you in detail from the beginning. Yesterday was the first anniversary of my wife and I. On such a wonderful and sacred day, we wanted to find a place with good scenery and a good environment to spend our anniversary. I watched If You Are the One 3 some time ago and felt that the environment there was good, so we checked the filming location of the movie, which is the so-called Sanya Yalong Bay Paradise on Earth Bird's Nest Resort. We booked an infinity pool room for 3,000 yuan. Because we have a home in Sanya, we drove ourselves Those who have seen movies know that their hotel is on the mountain. The road up the mountain is a two-way street and is very narrow. It looks very dangerous, and there are many sections of the road without fences. The sightseeing buses of their hotel and scenic area drive very fast~ There are great safety hazards, but I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal at the time and it was quite exciting. OK, then I arrived at Datang, we checked in, and we still needed to take the sightseeing bus up a distance to get to the room. Since we drove ourselves, the lady at the counter gave us a piece of paper to give to the security brother, and he would help us call a car and lead the way. OK, I did as she said and gave the paper to the security brother. The security brother was confused. How could we get up there without even the room number written on it? OK, it‚Äôs nothing, actually, small mistakes at work can be understood. Then the lady at the counter said that she forgot, and then gave us the room number and room card. The lady at the check-in counter can be said to be very unprofessional, but her attitude was okay. OK, we waited in the car for half an hour before the sightseeing bus arrived to take us to the room. My goodness, as soon as we entered the bathroom, there was a big spider and spider web hanging above our heads, and a big ant on the bed. It can be said to be very bad. We wanted to check out immediately, but since it was our anniversary, we didn‚Äôt want to be too disappointed, so we thought, hey, it‚Äôs on the mountain, and we can understand these uncontrollable things. Later we looked at the reviews on Ctrip and found that some people were bitten by centipedes in their rooms and encountered snakes and geckos in their rooms. OKOK, it‚Äôs really 666. It‚Äôs the first time that my life is in danger when staying in a hotel. At this time, we actually reported it to the hotel manager, and she actually said to us, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry. To be honest, it‚Äôs really a matter of luck. You have encountered so many things‚Ä¶ I think this kind of thing doesn‚Äôt happen to you often, right? A lot of people in the comment section? OK, then we went to their western restaurant for dinner (there are only two restaurants in total, Thai and western style). I ordered a cod and my wife ordered a medium-rare steak. In fact, I had already prepared myself mentally before coming in. Generally, few restaurants in resorts can do well, so it is understandable to reduce costs, OK, but I never expected that the dish that was served after waiting for an hour was a well-done steak that tasted like boiled steak, and the cod had one bone in every bite. At this time, my wife and I were already very unhappy. We had such a series of experiences on such an important day. OK, it‚Äôs even worse. The lady at the counter told me that they forgot to give us our ID cards. Since the room is far away from Datang, the distance between the mountain and the bottom of the mountain is simply not enough to get the ID card. OK, we finally discussed checking out and getting it. We were so unlucky. It was already eight o'clock in the evening. My wife and I were very dissatisfied but didn't say it because we didn't want to ruin the day. We tried to stay natural and discussed getting a spa next! OK, I called and the lady who answered the phone was still very unprofessional. The conversation went like this: That one is only available at 10 o‚Äôclock. Are you sure you want to come? Me: Yes, I‚Äôm sure. Lady: Are you sure? Because we have to agree in advance that we need to work overtime. Me: Yes, I‚Äôm sure. Lady: Are you really sure? If you are sure, I‚Äôll arrange it. Me: ‚Ä¶.. Yes, I‚Äôm sure. If I wasn‚Äôt sure, I wouldn‚Äôt make this call. It just felt like she was unprofessional to me, and more like she didn‚Äôt want us to go. Maybe she didn‚Äôt want to work overtime. Anyway, I was speechless. An hour later, something even more explosive happened. She called back and said sorry, the lady on duty had gone out to play, and there was no one else. Me: ‚Ä¶.. OK, forget it. I thought to myself, you kept asking me for a long time, are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? An hour later, you are not sure again. The reason is that you went out to play ***??? OK, then we went back to the room to rest. Fortunately, nothing happened in between. This sleep was very smooth and nothing bad happened. We discussed at night and decided to give this resort a bad review. Forget about it. When we woke up the next day, our plan was to have a Thai meal and then go to the forest scenic area below to have a nice time. OK, the Thai food was not surprisingly bad, but not as bad as the Western food. OK, the next thing was the climax that made me the most angry and explosive in the past two days. We were so angry that we almost fainted. After the meal, we were ready to go to the scenic area. We drove up the mountain first because we didn't know the road. As we were driving, a sightseeing car carrying tourists appeared behind us. It kept honking its horn behind me. As I said before, this mountain road is very dangerous and narrow. There is no fence on the edge of the cliff. It is full of sharp turns and S turns. Moreover, we are tourists and are not familiar with this mountain road. We must drive slowly. After all, life safety is the first priority. We must drive steadily. And the most outrageous thing is that I had driven 30 miles per hour and reached the speed limit on the road sign, but he still kept honking his horn behind me and kept forcing me. There were tourists in his car I was so angry that I opened the window and yelled to the back, "Can you please stop honking?" The scenic spot staff still refused to give in and honked at me and yelled at me, "Get the f*ck out of here?" OK, we drove to the top of the mountain. My wife and I were so angry that we went down to argue with the staff and the driver. He yelled at us and said, "What are you doing? Why are you driving so slowly?" We started arguing. The worst thing was that a tourist came up to argue with us and said, "We are tourists. We are in a hurry." Then I said, first of all, I was driving 30 miles per hour on this road, which is already very fast. We are tourists too, so it is normal that we are not familiar with the road. You guys kept pushing us from behind. If something happens to us, who will be held responsible?" OK, I am done here, my hands are tired and I don‚Äôt want to say anything more. My wife and I have already complained about these things to the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Culture and Tourism Bureau. Friends who are reading this article, please believe me, I really should not come here. Don‚Äôt read it and think that it is not my turn to be so unlucky. If you have this mentality, please scroll down and see what other tourists have experienced. Maybe you will understand why I wasted so much time typing this. You may not resonate with me after reading this, but if you refuse to accept your fate, it will not be too late to resonate with me after you check out. Hahaha. Anyway, Sanya Yalong Bay Hell on Earth and the experience that the Bird‚Äôs Nest Resort brought to us on our first anniversary, we will never forget it in our lifetime. It‚Äôs amazing. Oh, by the way, I hesitated on the mountain road because I was so excited that I forgot to take pictures of it for you. Anyway, if you have to come, cherish your life and please protect your elderly and children.

msg:After watching If You Are the One 3, I made a special trip to the Bird's Nest to stay for a few days. In the past few days since we came, the temperature has dropped across the country. The wind in the mountains is very strong and it is relatively cold. We need to wear a coat and cannot swim in the outdoor swimming pool. I booked a hotel package, the Peacock Room. The room has a round bed. It's no problem for one person and two people to stay together. It's just that the bed has no backrest, which makes it very inconvenient. I won't stay in this room type again next time. The hotel service was average. It was already one or two o'clock in the morning when we checked in. There was no phone call to contact us in advance. When we arrived at the front desk, the guy who checked us in was indifferent the whole time. Later, the guy who drove us back to the room in a battery car climbed high and low to help. It was very hard for us to carry the suitcases, so I would like to thank you. A friend came to visit the next day, and I had to buy a ticket when taking the electric car. This made me very unhappy. Which hotel does not allow guests to visit? Later, I communicated with the lady at the front desk, Xiao Wang, and solved the problem. I uploaded my friend‚Äôs ID and registered the information. Finally, I could take the bus to the room with us. Thank you, Xiao Wang. The ecological environment on the mountain is very good, but it is too cold in this season. It is enough to live in the mountain for a day or two. Life is too inconvenient. We had dinner at a Thai restaurant. The scenery was unparalleled, but it was too cold outdoors. Sitting inside, the food tastes average and the price is not cheap, but this is the case for five-star hotels. The package I booked also included two tickets to the Peak Park. I went with my friends. I paid another 98 yuan for a ticket. I also received free tickets for the Orchid Valley and the Rope Bridge. I didn‚Äôt go because there were too many tourists and I didn‚Äôt want to go. queue. The breakfast room is on the mountain and the scenery is unbeatable, but it is very cold sitting on the terrace. The breakfast is quite rich, including mango and steak, which my son likes. The small animal park next to the breakfast room is very popular with children. You can pet cats, dogs, and rabbitsüêç. My sister has been playing here for a long time, and my brothers and sisters are enthusiastic about playing with me. However, buying animal feed is very expensive, a small bag of grass is 55, and I work The staff asked me to buy a big gift bag, 88, which is actually a small bag of grass, plus a small bag of bird feed and a few thin carrot sticks. The hotel's battery car service is very good, but other services are average. Will not be returning anytime soon.

msg:The service is very good. The waiters are very attentive and dedicated, and provide timely feedback. The shuttle bus is convenient and the service attitude is very good. They are very responsible in helping pick up and drop off luggage.
The environment is good. It's in the park and it's more convenient to go sightseeing. The breakfast is very rich, with a good mix of hot and cold meat and vegetables, Hainan specialties and Cantonese refreshments.
I stayed in the Dayan Room. The room was clean and tidy, but the decoration style was old and dark. I didn't like the layout. The slippers were not placed in the entrance but on the bedside table. The bathroom is semi-open, separated from the bedside by a wall (actually a glass window), like a patio in a yard. The layout is unreasonable. The space is so big, but the toilet is very small. When sitting on the toilet or standing up, my head is almost You have to hit the door, and the toilet door opens outdoors, facing the courtyard wall. The weather is cooling down, and the mountain breeze blows at night. It is cold and dark when you go to the toilet (because you can see the dark sky), which is very scary. of! This kind of toilet will get wet on rainy days, it will be very hot in summer, and it will be very cold in winter. The key is to go to the toilet in a big circle! Not practical at all! The same goes for the soaking pool. It's about sixty or seventy centimeters deep. There are no steps to get in and out. You just have to take a big step in. It doesn't matter how tall you are, but what about your shortness? What about the elderly and children? Very unsafe! Also, the light switch in the bathroom is not outside the door but in the bathroom, which means you have to go in in the dark at night before you can turn on the light. In that case, you may get hit by the pool. If the light is left on, the light will shine through the blinds of the glass window right to the head of the bed! I don‚Äôt understand why so many curtains are blinds, only the curtains on the balcony are traditional cloth curtains. Venetian blinds will let in light without providing more privacy.
And I can‚Äôt help but complain about the swimming pool. Only Yunteng Pool is open now. The swimming pool is very good, one indoor heated pool, two outdoor swimming pools, and the large outdoor standard pool is very comfortable to swim in. But the supporting facilities are very poor. There is only one shower room and changing room combined (for both men and women). Because we planned to check out directly after swimming, we didn‚Äôt wear the rubber slippers from the guest room. Who knew there were no slippers in the swimming pool! Just like this, after swimming, I changed my clothes on the cold ground with my bare feet in the wet locker room. üòìüòìüòì
I will only choose this kind of hardware once! No matter how good the service is, it cannot make up for a bad living experience. I hope the hotel can improve its hardware so that there will be more repeat guests.

msg:A New Year‚Äôs Eve trip is a way to reward yourself and your family for your efforts this year.
This is a hotel with a unique environment.
Occupying the highest mountaintop in Yalong Bay, Sanya, overlooking the entire Yalong Bay. I can‚Äôt say much about the price/performance ratio of the room prices during New Year‚Äôs Day, because we were only free during this period, so air tickets and hotels were expensive. We stayed at this hotel for five days and four nights as a tourist destination.
At first, the winding mountain road was a novelty for us, but later we gradually realized that this inconvenience would really affect travelers who stay for multiple days.
The hotel originally had more than three restaurants serving dinner, but by 2024 there is only one Thai restaurant left. For example, there are three or four hundred Boston lobsters. You can evaluate the price. If it's delicious, it's okay. But the taste is just okay. The freshness of the seafood is not as good as that of a restaurant with a fish pond down the mountain. This doesn't matter. As a restaurant that has been standing for more than 10 years, we gave it a try the next night. The result was that the price/performance ratio was average, and we chose to order takeout for the next few days.
In the past two days, the hotel's food delivery to the guest rooms in Genting was a bit slow. We completely understand that, after all, with the guests seeing off, it is normal for a trip to take half an hour.
On the third day, things started to get weird. Every time I asked for takeout to be delivered to the guest room, I received a warning from customer service. I was really angry at that time. Thinking about it later, I probably want all the guests to go to the hotel restaurant. It‚Äôs not impossible. I need more choices, better value for money, and more considerate service.
I won't consider this place again in the short term.

They reserved a room number with a wide view and always paid attention to my check-in experience, which made me feel at home. I praised their service. The little animals in the cute pet paradise are also very cute. Next time you come to Sanya, you will definitely stay at the Bird's Nest!

msg:As someone who pays great attention to the quality of hotel accommodation, I struggled with many hotels before traveling, but I am very glad to have chosen the Bird's Nest. The environment is really like a fairyland, nothing good to say, especially in the evening before sunset, it‚Äôs not too beautiful! The service is very good and the room type has been upgraded. I am very grateful to the WeChat customer service Xiao Huang, who responded to all requests and was very timely. The elder in the family even gave a band-aid when his hand was injured, which is very considerate!
Most of the hotel's service staff are young, enthusiastic, diligent, handsome men and beautiful women. The breakfast was also great, exceeding expectations, with rich dishes to suit different tastes, and a great dining environment! The little animals in the cute pet paradise are also very cute.
The rooms are carefully decorated. We stayed in a unique wooden structure peacock room.
The problem that many people say when encountering small animals is that they will see some small insect geckos. The frequency is not high, it is inevitable in the tropical rainforest, and it is within an acceptable range.
All in all highly recommended! I would like to try other room types in the future.

First of all, the front desk clerk immediately upgraded the hotel room for us when he saw that we, an old couple, had booked it by ourselves. , when we checked into the hotel room, Manager Zhang from the Guest Depar**ent saw our information and immediately called us and asked us; what services do we need? He said that because he was older, he had less reservations for himself, so he wanted to take special care of him. At the Bird's Nest Hotel in Paradise, every service staff is very nice. It feels like the service at Shanghai Disney is as good as the service. Thanks to all the service staff! Thank you for their sincere dedication!

msg:As an old hotel, you can see that the facilities are slightly outdated, but the facilities are well preserved in terms of ease of use and functionality! There are hotel VIP cars to pick up and drop off between various scenic spots, which is more convenient. The only problem is that you need to wait for a long time (10-15 minutes) in peak season. The hotel is strategically located in a scenic spot, and the air in the morning is very, very fresh! Breakfast is in the western restaurant, and the view from the cliff is simply unparalleled! The hotel manager Sun's service is also very considerate, and he often asks if there is anything he needs help with. The Thai food included in the hotel package was delicious, and two people were very satisfied. The attractions included in the package are also a great place to visit. Because it is located in a mountainous area, the hotel has a lot of steps and requires a certain amount of physical strength.
Special praise should be given to the handicraft teachers in the Little Bookstore! He is a veritable "sweeping monk" and a true "artist"! It is recommended that everyone go to her little bookstore to take a look. It is located opposite the entrance of the Thai restaurant. If you have time, you can learn clay handcrafting from her! Definitely worth your wait! ! !
ps: The toilet at the check-in front desk of the hotel was a bit neglected, and the hygiene level was not in line with the positioning of this hotel.

The room was too small and dim, which caused bumps and bruises on my thighs. When I returned to Shanghai, it became even worse. It turned purple, and my dad also lost his mobile phone, so he had no time to play for the next two days. The Bird's Nest is really not suitable for taking the elderly and children. The battery car has to walk a long way to get down, which is bumpy and very dark, especially at night. inconvenient. The waiting time for the battery car is also relatively long, and the front desk may be busy and not very welcoming. The guy at the door is okay, and he is quite active in helping with luggage. All in all, I won‚Äôt stay here again.

The lights are relatively dark, and I can only lie down in the room and look at my mobile phone at night. Booking a room will give you forest park tickets, ropeway, glass plank road, and a buffet barbecue... In the end, I feel more balanced. The service was very good. The thin porter helped lift and unload the suitcases. I was very touched. The disadvantage is that you have to call a battery car when you go out for breakfast, and you have to take a battery car to transfer between stops. Fortunately, there are many cars and the waiting time is relatively short. I think those with money can just add some money to get a higher-end room. For me, one experience is enough. If you want to take pictures of the scenery next to the railing during breakfast, you must go early to occupy the position next to the railing. It is very popular.

The most cost-effective hotel, except for clothing, food, housing and transportation, it is quite good~ We drove up there by ourselves. It was raining that day, there were not many people in the scenic area, and the hotel occupancy rate was not high. The parking lot was very empty, and when we saw the hotel lobby The furnishings feel right. My husband likes this kind of environment! The lady at the front desk helped us get the access certificate for the car. There was a considerate housekeeper who helped us call the car, and the staff helped us with the luggage and my little charm. She had a sweet voice and impeccable professionalism. She took us around the scenic spots and explained various things. Plant plants, build buildings, etc. The tour guides who came last time were not as professional as me! ! ! üòùBeautiful girls are always shy, so I apologize for not leaving you any beautiful photos of Xiao Fu! üòò

I heard before that the food at Bird's Nest is the most delicious. Everyone "travels around the world" and brothers "don't deceive me sincerely". It is really delicious ~ What a coincidence. Two days before my husband came to travel, his gums were swollen and he couldn't do many things. Eat, thanks to him ~ In two days, I have eaten all the AB set meals from the Thai restaurant! Eat 4 big lobster shrimps every day until you are full~The Thai restaurant also has a little brother and sister~ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞The little sister sings beautifully, I really like her voice~~~Please give me an official reply and tell me the name of the little sister. Name, I'm a fan of hers! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Not to mention the breakfast, it was so delicious that I didn‚Äôt have time to take pictures. One plate after another went into my stomach~ The girl who served kept helping me collect the plates, I was embarrassed~ I gained 10 pounds in the past few days, this is the happiest experience of gaining weight for me! ! ! üôèüèªAs long as I don‚Äôt reach the weight limit of the item I‚Äôm playing, I can keep eating~

Because in the tropical rainforest, I saw white spiders on the stairs and geckos while taking a bath. Everything in the south is really bigger than in the north. I had always been worried about mosquitoes before, so all the mosquito repellents I bought were useless. Up~ I was tired from playing and went to bed early. When I got up, I was woken up by the chirping of birds~ When I sat up and opened my eyes, I saw the mountain view~ I can‚Äôt describe the feeling of the broad view in my heart! I like it so much~~~

And I added WeChat, and since then I have been asking about my motion sickness and helping us to have fun!
The food in the Thai restaurant is very delicious. It is the favorite food of Hainan children these days. It originally had spicy dishes, but later I told the waiter that my children cannot eat spicy food. She immediately contacted us and changed the dishes. After looking at the famous brands, I was helpless. I forgot about this, but it was a little girl who was not tall and a little fat, and the manager came out to ask how we were eating.
The scenery is very beautiful. If you come to the Forest Park to play, it is highly recommended to stay at the Bird's Nest Resort, a natural oxygen bar, the scenery is beautiful, and the most important thing is that the waiters you meet are so friendly! What a huge contrast to the five-star hotel I stayed in two days ago! The management here is really good. We just want to have fun when we travel. Staying for one day feels less than necessary.

Facilities: The facilities are not new. They have been there for more than ten years and are all wooden structures. But the maintenance is still good, I am very satisfied with this.

Environment: Living in the forest, perfectly integrated with nature! Overlooking the entire Yalong Bay, the scenery is unparalleled! Previous comments said that there are gaps between the floors in the room and there will be noise when walking. I think these are completely acceptable, which is also a feature of the all-wood structure, and I don't see any problems. Some people commented that there were bugs in the room... I think this is totally fine, this is what nature feels like. In fact, I didn't see many bugs, and there are also pest control measures in the room. 100% satisfied with the environment.

Service: The service is extremely good! The first person to praise is Xiao Sun (Sun Kai), the customer service steward. Because the resort is located in the mountains and is spread out over a wide area, many things require additional arrangements. Manager Xiao Sun informed us of all the precautions in advance and was very detailed, thoughtful and considerate. There are many problems that trouble Xiaosun every day. Xiaosun tries his best and provides all the help, making the stay experience very satisfying! Thank you Xiao Sun for your professional service!

A private car is required to get in and out of the room. Special thanks to driver Xu Mingguang! Xiao Xu's service attitude was very good and enthusiastic when picking up guests; he actively introduced some features of the hotel. Xiao Xu also took the initiative to help me find a machine for returning the power bank. Thank you Xu Mingguang!

The experience of staying at the Bird's Nest Resort was very good, and I will come again!

msg:Facilities: It‚Äôs a one-stop trip. I saw it on Ctrip and booked a room at Genting Eagle for one night. Although there was a ********* transit station in Sanya on the day of check-in, I went to the front desk to check in at 3pm because it was raining continuously. I stayed in a cliff tree house on the top of the mountain. Since I was alone, the lady at the front desk communicated with me and found out that I was afraid of the dark, so she gave me special consideration and gave me room 1112. It was close to the restaurant where I went to eat. I forgot to take pictures of the room. You can see the details. Pictures of the hotel, well designed, with large bed, TV, air purifier, powerful central air conditioning, tea table, large sofa, balcony located on the cliff, outdoor table and chairs, one table and two chairs, one beach chair, and The one facing the sea and the mountains has a great view. I ordered the hotel's bubble bath service the next morning and watched the rainy, windy and foggy April day alone. Then the fog dissipated, the sky cleared, and the sea view added to the fog. , as if you are in the clouds, like a fairyland on earth, it is indeed a rare experience of paradise on earth.

Hygiene: Occasionally encounter naughty geckos ü¶é. Due to the low temperature on the day of check-in, I was lucky not to be harassed by mosquitoes. It is clean and tidy, and it is four-star level. Because the tree house is on a cliff on the top of the mountain, the forest in the tropical rainforest climate is inevitably wet. The air is heavy and the room has a slight musty smell, but it dissipates after half an hour by turning on the air purifier to dehumidify. Open the window and balcony door, the outdoor air is fresh, a natural oxygen bar, and in the silent night, there are only the chirping of insects and birds.
Environment: Wake up by the birds in the early morning, watch the clouds roll and relax, sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, it is a fairyland on earth. It is recommended to stay in the Genting room to experience it, it is very interesting
Service: Thanks to all the staff: front desk, concierge, manager in charge, and restaurant manager for their hospitable help. Because I was staying alone and was a little afraid of the dark, I moved to the assembly area for the second night and specially arranged a small room for me. The tree house is for me. The living room is very interesting. It is another tree house with a direct view of the mountains and sea. The room is designed like an ancient wing, which is very considerate. There is also a dressing table and makeup mirror. Although it is a tree house, hotel supplies and five-star The same brand as first-class hotel supplies, the details are very good

msg:Before I moved in, I didn‚Äôt understand why the room was called Peacock ü¶ö
 It turned out to be designed according to the peacock cage. Whoever lives in it becomes a peacock.
The room is very beautiful and the view is very good. You can overlook Yalong Bay.
Manager Sun's attentive and enthusiastic service arranged our itinerary perfectly.
The hotel's Genting swimming pool is so beautiful and very comfortable
 Before coming here, I thought there would be a lot of mosquitoes, but after I checked in, I found it was okay. Manager Sun had arranged for the room to be fumigated before checking in, so it was very comfortable. Highly recommended.

msg:Hygiene: much higher than expected. I originally wanted to stay in a hotel in the mountains but I didn't expect it to be clean. I didn't expect that the Bird's Nest Resort was thoughtful in everything from toiletries to bedding. It was very comfortable, the bath water was large, and even the balcony was clean.
Facilities: It has everything you need and is worth experiencing. The room also has an oversized bathtub.
Environment: It's really awesome. The breakfast is very rich, plus Hainan's special rice noodles and jelly, etc., and the coffee is also very fragrant.
Service: This is the most commendable thing. Butler Xiao Sun is attentive, responsive, efficient, and handles our questions in a timely manner. It is convenient to travel, and you don‚Äôt have to walk a lot to take your children to the park. This vacation is well worth it.

msg:The trip to the Bird's Nest is very worthwhile. From the mountain, you can overlook the sea view of Yalong Bay. This is a view that I could not enjoy even when I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Ocean View Villa. The hotel butler Zeng Xiangdong contacted us in advance to arrange airport pick-up the day before our trip and understood our needs. Every time we went to the restaurant for meals, the butler would pick us up and drop us off, and the takeaways would also be delivered to the room. The housekeeper's efficient service allowed our family to live comfortably and happily in the mountains and rivers. When the room service staff saw that we had brought milk powder, they specially gave a dozen bottles of pure water to make milk for the children. The Bird's Nest Hotel is especially suitable for young children and families with the elderly. You can swim in the swimming pool during the day, eat snacks and drink tea on the terrace in the evening, and overlook the mountains and sea. It is very comfortable. By the way, if you are lucky, you can see monkeysüêí. The hotel also provides Tickets for scenic spots ~ worth coming again!

msg:I stayed at a resort with a period feel for 2 nights and it was really great to experience itüëçüèª!
The service is enthusiastic, attentive and patient, and someone will call to ask for opinions and suggestions. Although there were many people staying during the National Day holiday, every service link was well connected and orderly.
It is located in the forest park, and there are electric cars to pick you up wherever you go. When you are tired, you can go back to your room and take a nap. In the hot weather of Sanya, you will feel good!
The set meal provided by the Thai restaurant in the hotel is full of sincerity, the portion is very large, and every dish is deliciousüòã. The tom yum soup is truly unforgettable. Breakfast also has many choices and good taste.
It is still very cool in the morning and evening on the mountain, with a cool breeze. It is recommended that if you have sufficient budget, you can choose the Genting room type. You can see the beautiful bay view and it is worth the trip.
The room was clean and tidy. During our stay, 2 little geckos visited us. Butterflies and dragonflies flew over the terrace from time to time. Other small animals were well-behaved and hid themselves.
About 200 meters outside the west gate of the resort is the Liupan Village Night Market, where there is a lot of food.
If you want to have a different staying experience from the seaside, Bird's Nest Resort is a good choice.

msg:Bitten by a centipede! He crawled into bed at 2:30 in the middle of the night and bit him. He spent a frightening night in the hospital! It's not like the wild creatures in the mountains and rooms suggested on the booking platform. To the point where he would climb into bed and bite people. I was woken up by my friend's cry. A centipede bit my friend and then crawled across the red pillow behind my head. I jumped out of bed with a cry, and made a trembling phone call. The staff arrived half an hour later. Running away down the mountain overnight in pajamas and pants has no dignity! Will only check out the money. The room 1280 is very shabby. It took me three weeks after I returned to Beijing to feel better. I was even scared when my hair slipped over my shoulders. There will not be any mental compensation. If necessary, all should go to a tertiary hospital to assess the mental damage and resolve it through legal means. Complaints are useless. The disgusting face of the superior capital can be seen at a glance. I was stupid. After checking in, I wanted to check out twice because of the environment. I hesitated and my friend was bitten. I hope this comment will be seen by more people and can help some people who love life avoid disaster!

We can send you from various campsites to various areas where you want to go at any time. This is a way to experience VIP trea**ent.
       The entire forest park is extremely large, causing the hotel rooms to be scattered. The scenery in each area is unparalleled, overlooking the panoramic view of Yalong Bay, with a quiet environment and fresh air.
        There are many things to do in the entire forest park. The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, there are not many people, and it will not be crowded. The restaurant is also located on one of the hills, with good scenery and delicious food. It is a kind of enjoyment .

The hotel shuttle bus was sent to Phoenix Terrace and the room type we got was Peacock (Picture 1289). In the afternoon, we visited the glass pier in Peak Park (Picture 3) and had fun in the non-second-married room. We then returned to Phoenix Terrace for dinner at a Thai restaurant (Picture 4). The set menu was large and the ingredients were fresh. In the morning, the Phoenix Terrace Western Restaurant has a great view and exquisite dishes. After dinner, we booked a car to go play on the ropeway. A few steps from the exit of the ropeway is the Eagle Area Swimming Pool, where we swam. Book a car to go back to your home to pack your things, hand over your room card at Phoenix Terrace, and the car will be sent to the front desk of the mountainside hotel where you check in. Exit the south gate of the park and go all the way down the wooden stairs (Picture 7). There is bus No. 27 heading towards Yalong Bay and the next stop.

When we checked in at the front desk, the lady patiently explained and the little brother helped us carry our luggage, because the room in the assembly area where we stayed was very expensive. Going up the wooden stairs was very tiring, but they helped us carry our luggage when we checked in and out, which was greatüòé. When we checked in, we also gave mosquito repellent bracelets and puzzles to the children. What is worth praising is the hotel's buffet dinner, which has many varieties. Many Hainan specialty snacks are also included and taste good. My favorite is the Thai restaurant. You can see the sunset outdoors and eat while watching it. It is very satisfying. I will come again next time.

msg:I first came across the Bird's Nest Resort in 2010 when If You Are the One was released, and I wanted to go there on my honeymoon. Later, I was busy with work, getting married and having children, and my wish was put on hold again and again. This time I finally got my wish. It is really worth visiting.
Service: Because I was going with my children‚Äôs classmates this time, I called the hotel in advance to discuss some needs. I was lucky enough to get to know the manager Elvis. After that, I bothered Elvis many times to ask a lot of details, and all received very timely and effective responses. reply. Before checking in, Elvis introduced the weather conditions in the mountains, arranged for the waiter to add mugwort to the room to repel insects, and arranged a children's bed and a small toilet seat for the room. During the stay, Elvis asked if I had a good rest every day. When he learned that I had some symptoms of heatstroke, he also provided I was particularly moved by the Huoxiang Zhengqi water. When checking in, the front desk manager Sun Kai thoughtfully prepared small gifts for the children. The hotel shuttle bus driver, luggage boy, housekeeping staff, and restaurant staff were all friendly and kind.
Room and facilities: Some people said in previous reviews that there were many bugs. We thought it was okay. There were a little more mosquitoes outdoors, but it was completely acceptable. We stayed at the Bird's Nest just to be close to nature. As long as the door was closed indoors, we didn't think so. There are mosquitoes, and I was surprised to see a small gecko by chance. Children especially like it. After all, the hotel has been open for more than ten years, so the facilities are definitely not that new, but considering the maintenance costs in the mountains, I personally feel that the current state is worthy of the price. The Dayan Fang where we stayed had beautiful views of sunrise and sunset, and it was very close to Western and Thai restaurants. During my stay, only the Yunpeng swimming pool was open. I went to reserve it in the morning. I couldn‚Äôt capture the beauty of the top of the mountain with my mobile phone. The cliff swimming pool will open soon, which should be even more amazing.
Travel: The hotel is located in the tropical paradise of Yalong Bay. It is recommended to stay at least two nights. Our baby was young and had to take a nap in the afternoon. On the morning after we checked in, we went to the Dragon Cable Bridge across the Yangtze River and then took a bus to the Peak Park. We played on the glass boardwalk, If You Are the One 2 Trial Marriage Room, watched a movie, had lunch, and took a rainforest rafting ride (too It‚Äôs fun, you must play), after getting down, I took a stop to Orchid Valley, and then went back to the room to take a nap. The time was just right.
Catering: The breakfast is very rich, and the dinners are buffet in the Western restaurant and set menu in the Thai restaurant. I asked stupidly before which one was the cliff restaurant. When I arrived, I found that all the restaurants are on the side of the mountain with unparalleled sea views. If you want to have a good seat, Location requires reservation in advance.
Transportation: The hotel shuttle bus can be booked via WeChat or phone at any time. This service alone is worth it. However, it is best to book early when checking out. The bus is busy at that time and you have to wait.
Overall, I am very satisfied and it was a particularly pleasant stay!

msg:I‚Äôve seen photos online, so it‚Äôs pretty much what I imagined, there‚Äôs not much difference. This hotel is quite special. The rooms are relatively scattered. Travel depends on the hotel shuttle bus. It is also very good to take this bus to see the scenery. Some rooms at the assembly area are a bit far from the drop-off point. You need to walk up a flight of steps, which is not convenient for carrying luggage. However, the hotel staff will help with luggage, which is a thumbs up. The hotel's service was generally better than I expected. The front desk was enthusiastic, and the hotel manager Leo took the initiative to provide a late check-out. He heard that we checked out early in the morning and offered entertainment items as gifts, which was very considerate. The hotel tour guide Xiaoshuai was very humorous and enthusiastic. He added a lot of fun to our visit and made it a worthwhile trip.

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first: I stayed at Peacock for two nights and then stayed at Genting Eagle Seaview for two nights. I personally feel that Peacock is very cost-effective.
Peacock is very close to Western and Thai restaurants.
You can get there by walking
The temperature and climate in the mountains are very comfortable, and the entire hotel is like a forest park.
It is very suitable for taking children to play together. There are mountain views, sea views and activities to release the children's energy. The food and drink are not bad. As a mountain hotel and entertainment place, many services are very detailed and user-friendly.
Well worth a visit.
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings: If you take the elderly with inconvenient legs and feet out to play, you still need to be careful, because the entire hotel relies on electric cars to travel, and there are steps to enter the room, so this may not be suitable for the elderly with weak physical strength. It would be a bit boring to stay completely in the room, unlike being at the beach which would be more comfortable
In addition, there are few programs when it gets dark at night, so it is not suitable for people who like nightlife.
Finally, the most important thing is the weather. It will feel much worse when it rains. It is really great when it is sunny, so everyone chooses the weather.
Overall satisfiedüòÑüòÑüòÑ

It would be a pity to just stay at the mountain view, because the view is actually very similar to Naked Valley. Isn't it to add a bay view when you come here? So I chose the double-bedroom sea view room at Genting. It really didn't disappoint.
The view is invincible. You don't have to go to the western restaurant to see the bay. The family can sit on the terrace to drink tea and chat while watching the sea. It's really comfortable
The whole service is also very nice. The housekeeper Miss Sun responded very quickly and was very considerate.

The maintenance of the hotel for more than ten years is really good. Coming here is to find a feeling of close contact with nature, which is different from the experience of staying in a seaside hotel directly.

The only ugliness is that the bath water really needs to be left for a long time before it can be hot. But it does not affect my overall perfect experience.

Facilities: Although I live at the top of the mountain, the staff who pick me up and drop off the car are very attentive. You need to take a car to go back to your room for meals (you can call a car by phone or WeChat). This is very suitable for those who like a quiet vacation. The privacy is very good.

Environment: I chose to live here because I wanted to play in the forest park. It also fulfilled my wish to live in If You Are the One Bird's Nest.
Hygiene: Because there are many mosquitoes and small animals in the mountains, but the staff are very considerate and prepare mosquito repellents and sprays (all hotels here have them). The scenery is really beautiful. There are mountains and seas. It is a paradise on earth. It fits the name haha.
There is still a difference between the 5üåü level sea view rooms in Haitang Bay. I stayed in this one first and then at the seaside in Haitang Bay. There is a comparison, but the service is first-rate.

msg:Choosing the Bird's Nest Hotel for this trip to Sanya was the most correct choice I made. We booked a surprise blind box package and arranged a villa in Dayan No. 06 for us. The terrace view was great and we could see both the mountains and the sea. The room comes with a large soaking pool, but I thought it was a waste of water so I didn't take a dip. There is also a separate shower room, and the entire villa is surrounded by trees for great privacy. The shower pool and bathroom are outdoors and integrated into nature. It may be a little inconvenient to go to the bathroom at night, but the separation of dry and wet is truly achieved. Sanya has a high humidity in September, and the room is very dry despite the 24-hour air conditioning.
The room is within walking distance of the two restaurants and the reception station. Breakfast and dinner are very delicious. There are many breakfast options. The service staff will also remind late guests to close their meals at 10:30. Dinner is a set menu with two options. The restaurant is clean and tidy and the scenery is unparalleled. During both nights of dining, we saw the stunningly beautiful sunset. There were also singers who sublimated the entire dinner a**osphere. This kind of scenery is difficult to reproduce elsewhere.
The swimming pool on the top of the mountain overlooks the beautiful Yalong Bay. You must not miss the experience. We were very lucky. The swimming pool was almost unbooked twice, which is a benefit in the off-season!
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service. I have seen almost everyone in other comment sections saying that the service here is very good, and I have experienced it myself. The service staff were all very polite and helpful. On the morning of the second day after I checked in, the Bird's Nest guest manager, Manager Sun, called me to ask if I was satisfied with the stay. After that, I contacted her several times, including calling for electric car pick-up and drop-off, restaurant reservations, etc., every time They all responded quickly, and because the first day's stay was so good, we extended our stay for another day.
If I have any comments, the towels and bath towels in the hotel should have been used for a long time, but it is not a big problem for me personally. After all, environmental protection is also very important, as long as they are clean and soft.
A very good hotel experience, I will recommend it to everyone around me.

When checking into the hotel, the front desk will arrange a car to the door of the room. There is also a guy to help carry the luggage. The air conditioner in the room is also turned on in advance. After entering the room, I felt comfortable and looked around, but I didn‚Äôt see any bugs, which was awesome üëç; I played in the park and went down the mountain to play ~ Manager Sun would help arrange the pick-up and drop-off cars properly, and tell us the route to avoid repeating the same route. Thumbs up üëç; the front desk, waiters, drivers, and housekeepers here all have good attitudes. They always say hello when meeting, and the service is also very good.

msg:The surprise blind box package feels very valuable.
After arriving at the store, the front desk gave us a wild goose room. The balcony in the room faces Haitang Bay, and you can see the sunrise by the sea early in the morning. Unfortunately, we got up a little late, and the sun has already climbed high. The service staff is very good and will go to the room to pick up and deliver your luggage for you.
The Thai restaurant meal provided in the set meal is large enough for two people, enough for three people. The Thai restaurant is great for watching the sunset on the top of the mountain.
The forest guided tour included in the package is also great. Director Zhang Xin was very responsible, and his explanations were very detailed and professional. During the tour, we were introduced to many tropical animals and plants that we had never seen before, and we gained a lot of knowledge. They will also thoughtfully advise us on how to optimize the angle for taking photos.
It is worth staying and experiencing the Bird's Nest Hotel in the off-season.

This time I brought my relatives and booked two suites. I would like to thank the guest, Manager Zeng, for upgrading to the Genting room type. The experience is great.

The hotel is on a mountain, take a taxi and enter the hotel lobby. In the forest park, the hotel and the park shuttle bus are very good. I personally think that I can stay for three nights.
The morning is not hot at all, the air in the mountains is fresh and refreshing, take the shuttle bus to the restaurant; the breakfast is very good, with many varieties. The breakfast restaurant is semi-outdoor, and the environment is very suitable for my taste, cleansing the lungs and embracing nature.
Manager Sun of the guest depar**ent is very capable of solving problems, she is considerate of the guests, she handles affairs efficiently, and effectively solves the troubles caused by the front desk. I commend her.
I will choose the Bird's Nest Hotel next time, and I hope the hotel will get better and better.

msg:Anyone who has visited Sanya Park will have seen this hotel. If you don‚Äôt have children or plan to go swimming in the swimming pool, I highly recommend you to come to the Bird‚Äôs Nest. The private rooms are very dense, and you can call the shuttle bus when traveling. It is very convenient to visit scenic spots. Although the restaurant here is just a buffet, it is much more refined and delicious than those five-star hotels on the beach. It has breakfast and dinner, and the lighting and music are well coordinated. The room and garden view are like in Southeast Asia, but the noise of the shuttle bus during the day is really noisy. For the complimentary tickets, I recommend going in the afternoon when you check in because it won‚Äôt be too hot in the sun and there are few people. You can first walk around the glass plank road and go to the non-second-marriage room to take photos. It‚Äôs interesting to go out and go rafting at your own expense. After rafting, take the ferry to the suspension bridge. Call a taxi back to the hotel for a buffet. This place is really suitable for couples.

The hotel is built in the mountains, so the environment needless to say, the summer in Sanya is so hot that I dare not go out, but living in the mountains can still feel the chilly wind! The blind box villa we booked may be due to the large number of people in the peak season. The view of the room was not good. Fortunately, the distance to Li‚Äôs restaurant is not too far. It‚Äôs a distance that can‚Äôt be climbed every day. We stayed for two nights and the breakfast was very good. Rich, Chinese and Western style, as well as Cantonese breakfast, the coffee machine in the breakfast room is really dusty, can't make a cup for half a day, and I haven't had a drink on the first morning! The unexpected surprise was the dinner we included. In addition to the richness, there were also seafood barbecues and free-flowing beer, which marked a successful conclusion to our trip.

There is a small open square at the door of the room. There are no slippery stairs up and down, which is very friendly to suitcases. The room is big enough that the imperial concubine can be used as a bed. The bathroom is big enough, and the bathtub is luxurious, but it's a pity that it's not used much. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools, children are exposed to rain and dew every day.
The natural environment of the hotel is very good, but you can't walk for a walk. You can only use the battery car to go up and down the 18th bend of the mountain road every day. It's a pity. Generally speaking, this hotel is suitable for couples to fall in love, or those who deliberately pursue tranquility, and feel like they have attained the Tao.

What leaves me speechless the most is. No matter where you go in a scenic spot when dining out, you need to be picked up by a car from the hotel, and you usually have to wait for twenty minutes. . You may even need to call a second time.
Hygiene is also very poor

Write a few flaws that I personally think, I hope the bird's nest will be better and better
1. It is best to divide children‚Äôs tickets into several grades. Now the size of 140cm is used across the board, which embarrasses those children who are slightly taller. After all, there are no other restaurants available in this place, and the self-service price is not cheap.
2. The attractions and activities tickets given by the accommodation are the same every day, so it is only suitable for one night stay. Can you consider sending different attractions tickets every day for consecutive guests?
Thanks to Zeng Xiangdong and all the battery car drivers and service staff for their hard work, and I will consider coming again if I have the opportunity

msg:From check-in to the front desk, the service is very warm and the concierge service is also very good. The staff waited by the car to help with the luggage before the door was opened. When checking in, I just asked if I could help upgrade the room. I didn't expect to simply mention the hotel manager Zeng Xiangdong. I was very enthusiastic and helped to upgrade the room. This request is basically useless in other hotels in Sanya. The lady at the front desk is very gentle, especially the sister Huahua at the front desk helped check in.
There is no problem with the hotel room facilities and they are perfect. Some people in the reviews say it‚Äôs all about bugs. I think it‚Äôs normal to have insects in the rainforest on the mountain. As long as the door is closed when entering and leaving the room, there will definitely not be many bugs in the house at night. Some guests close the door and windows during the day. They are all turned on at night and they are not turned off in time. Bugs like the light, and of course they will enter the house. Close the doors and windows normally, and the mosquitoes are not real.
The hotel has also added a new service now, that is, you can take the hotel VIP car for the whole journey in Yalong Bay Forest Park. Just tell us in WeChat where you want to go at the location of the park. The hotel will immediately arrange a car to pick you up. It is very convenient and can be delivered. Play any project in Forest Park
The hotel's Western breakfast and Thai seafood buffet dinner are very good. There is no limit to oysters and scallops. The location of the restaurant is also good, overlooking the entire Yalong Bay.
The service from check-in at the hotel entrance to the hotel shuttle bus to the restaurant staff is very good in all aspects, with a smile and real
Thanks again to the hotel manager Zeng Xiangdong for bringing out such a good team, because you can feel the enthusiasm from the hotel management. Guests come first.

The room facilities are a bit old, and the door lock cannot be properly locked. After reporting for repair, the maintenance worker said it was normal, and the breakfast was very good Well, if you can sit on the outside of the restaurant, the viewing effect will be better. Some of the rooms in the tribe are seriously inconsistent with the promotional pictures on the website. It shows that there is a viewing balcony on the hillside. In fact, in the woods, the trees have already attached windows, so I communicated with the front desk and changed to the eagle room. Viewing effect of the room changes from heaven to earth

msg:Some rooms in the assembly area are nestled in the mountains, which are relatively dark. This time, we booked for two nights. The location of the room was not very satisfactory on the first day. After feedback, we changed to a room with a very good view on the second day. I am very satisfied! The rooms are very clean, and the service is very attentive. I thought it would be troublesome to call a car for breakfast, meals, or sightseeing, but the scenic spots and resorts have very good vehicle scheduling, and you won't have to wait for a long time, which is very convenient. If you want to play Tropical Paradise Forest Park and avoid crowds, staying in a resort is the best choice. We had a lot of fun on this trip. The service staff in the resort are very nice, they help with luggage and have a very good attitude. In addition, it is also very fun to often take a car in the scenic area. The road is very rough, and every time I feel like riding a speeding car, my children and I like it very much. Very recommendable!

msg:Very satisfied! If the full score üíØ, I can score 110 pointsüëç The hotel staff I have come into contact with are all very enthusiastic, always answering my questions with a smile: the enthusiastic front desk ladies carefully told me the check-in process and precautions for playing. The staff who helped dispatch the shuttle and helped us with our luggage. The little brother in charge of the handover helped us carry two luggages in the rain. What surprised me the most was that I received a call from the front desk manager in the afternoon, saying that I had an appoin**ent to deliver a cake to me for my birthday the next day. It was the first time I celebrated my birthday in a different place. I could not have imagined that I could have a birthday cake when I lived in the "mountain", but the attentive staff of the hotel helped me think of it. In the evening, the staff came as scheduled and sent blessings, which touched me very much, and I express my gratitude. Everyone here treats visitors with enthusiasm and sincerity. Even the cleaning lady will see you nodding and saying hello when she sees you on the side of the road. This kind of service is so heartwarming. So I decided to book another night the next day. The price/performance ratio of the hotel is also very good. On the mountain, I thought it would be good to have breakfast and dinner, after all, the urban area I booked did not have breakfast and dinner. Not only that, but the quality is very good! The breakfast is self-service, the dishes are rich, and we are full. After eating at ten o'clock in the morning, we played in the scenic spot for seven hours. The family of three was not hungry at all. We didn't eat at noon, so we ate dinner directly. Dinner in the evening was also a surprise. The hotel gave me a Thai dinner voucher with a good reputation next to it. I was afraid that I would not be used to it, and I thought I would have to pay more. But the surprise is that the taste is very good, and the combination of meat and vegetables, the color, fragrance and taste, the lobster tastes very good, and it is also served with drinks and fruits, which is simply great! And both places to eat can see the beautiful scenery. The room is circular, and the bed is also circular, so a family of three can sleep comfortably. The room has everything! Great value for money! Not to mention the scenery, I really like living in such an environment, especially when there was a typhoon on the first day, it was raining and windy, and I saw a different scenery, surrounded by clouds and mist, which had a special flavor. This birthday is particularly memorable in your hotel, thank you for your warm service! I will come back next time I come to Sanya! I wish better and better! (I have never written a review with so many words)

Service: You can contact the battery car by WeChat or phone when you go to the scenic spot. The service of the battery car brother is very good. In addition, the Thai restaurant has good service and a good view!
The bad point: the room includes 3 sets of afternoon tea, I went to the western restaurant to order food, and urged it many times, until the afternoon tea time ended more than half an hour later, I only served a fruit platter that was not in the list, and then informed the hotel and Ctrip Feedback, the duty manager actively contacted to deal with it. During the stay, the only thing I was dissatisfied with was the afternoon tea in the western restaurant, which was also the problem with the low-score evaluation.

When you check in at the front desk, someone will explain in detail the route to visit. After adding the customer service WeChat, as long as you tell the customer service on WeChat where you want to go, a car will come to pick you up, and the response speed is also very fast.
There are not as many mosquitoes and small animals as I imagined, but there will be some moths when the lights are turned on at night. Occasionally, a gecko will help you eat mosquitoes in the room, and there are no other mosquitoes.
I have lived in this kind of tree house before, and I was worried that there would be a damp or musty smell, but it didn't.
The room with the pool is still very comfortable. Seeing the room service staff come to clean and need to carry a heavy and large bag to walk down from the top, it is still quite hard.
Whether it is check-in or check-out, there will be a new brother to help move the box down the stairs. So for those with large luggage, there is no need to worry about moving it.
Living in the Bird's Nest Hotel, it is very convenient to go back and forth to the scenic spot. Hail the car to go directly to each station in the scenic spot.
We went to the cable bridge, the glass plank road and the rainforest flying are very fun, and they are not tiring.
I went shopping in the morning, went back to the room at noon and ordered a takeaway, the lobby will deliver it, and continued swimming in the afternoon, very happy.
In addition to enjoying the seaside scenery in Sanya, the tropical rainforest also has its own characteristics. After all, it is only found in tropical regions.

I originally booked through Ctrip and specifically noted the double bed room. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that this room type only has twin beds. Then the hotel manager came over and asked us to upgrade. He said it was an upgrade, but there was an extra swimming pool that we couldn't use, and the view was far different. And the following services are even more unacceptable:
I was hungry at night, so I decided to order takeout after communicating with the customer service. The customer service asked me to notify him to deliver the takeout when it arrived. At around 11 o'clock, the takeaway arrived, but the customer service staff quietly went off work!
Then I followed the instructions of the customer service's automatic message and called the front desk, but no one answered or responded. After finally getting through, the front desk obviously didn't know about the takeout, and then they arranged for someone to deliver it. It didn't arrive until about 12:30, which means it took more than an hour for the takeout to go from the front desk to the room!
Then, the takeaway was missing one portion of frog. I called the front desk again, and the front desk kept shirking responsibility. After a few words, they said they would arrange for someone to deliver it. After waiting for more than 40 minutes, I finished eating before it arrived and went to bed first. As a result, around 1:40, I was woken up by the sound of the doorbell, saying that takeout had arrived.

There is a hotel shuttle bus for entering and leaving the park and various scenic spots. It is very convenient and the service is also very good. After checking out, it will be sent to the next stop for free. Except for a few flying insects, only three geckos were seen, which basically did not affect the stay.

Maybe they are too tired. Haha, it is worth experiencing a hotel. It is not the same as ordinary ones, but the weather is hot. There should be more mosquitoes at that time

msg:Went for the second time. The best room type for parents and little ones to live in. The old man sleeps on the sofa and the family does not need to be separated, and a meal fee is added. Saved a room fee, very good.

Location:
In the scenic area, it is convenient to play. You have to call a shuttle bus when you go out, otherwise it will be too tiring.
health:
The room is very large, at least 60 square meters, but it is very clean (except for some floating dust on the lampshade). However, I didn‚Äôt dare to use the pool in the room. There are many swimming pools in the hotel.

bed:
Big enough and a little soft, as were the pillows.

Serve:
Praise! Praise! Every service staff made me feel full of enthusiasm, empathy and consideration, and even took the initiative to solve the things I didn't think of.
Cost performance:
In fact, the house price is not low, the best room type is 1600+. Adding a seat (including attraction tickets) is close to 2,000 yuan. But the added value is high

msg:Very very satisfied stay experience. The scenery is beautiful and the location of the hotel is unique. Attentive service, 24-hour travel with tram pick-up. Stay in the Genting Eagle full sea view room, overlooking Yalong Bay is so beautiful, value for money. Breezy mountains during the day, starry nights, and chirping birds and insects in the morning, this is the correct way to start a vacation, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, relax in the greenery, return to nature, everything slows down. If the economy permits, I sincerely recommend staying in Genting District, the location is perfect. When you come to Sanya, you must stay in the hotel and the must-see scenic spots.

Facilities: The facilities are complete, relatively new, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the space is large enough. The hut built on stilts does not have as many mosquitoes as in other reviews, and a small firefly flies here at night. Toiletries are complete.
Hygiene: clean and tidy, moxa smells good
Environment: super five-star, unique in Sanya
Service: No matter what location or position, every employee has a friendly and thoughtful service attitude, first-class service, and makes us feel at home. There was a small episode, which was quickly and properly resolved. Special praise to the guest manager Zeng, who called many times to coordinateüëç
Breakfast: rich in variety, fresh ingredients, wide view of the restaurant, beautiful food and beautiful scenery.

The scenery seen from the room is beautiful, and you can see Yalong Bay from a different perspective. The rope bridge, glass walkway and cliff infinity pool in the resort are all worth experiencing. If the weather is fine, I strongly recommend the Thai restaurant. The sunset view is amazing. Because there are indeed mosquitoes in the mountains, the resort will smoke moxa sticks in the room to repel insects, and also put mosquito repellent liquid. Choose a room and try to choose a location close to the shuttle station, otherwise it will be a bit hard to go up and down the steps.

The hotels in Yalong Bay have been around for a long time, especially the wooden bird's nest, but the actual feeling of staying is not bad, obviously it has been renovated recently. Living in the forest has a good environment, but there will be bugs and geckos, and I saw many animals and plants that I have never seen before. The hotel also has a guide to explain. When I booked the room, I didn‚Äôt pay attention to booking a double bed. Manager Zhang helped us upgrade the room, upgraded to 2 levels in 2 days, and experienced different rooms. It was a very good experience.

As for whether it is convenient to go down the mountain from the location on the mountain, even on May 1st, the shuttle bus resources are very sufficient, and it will arrive in about ten minutes. Here, I would like to praise the little brother Lin Yufa who picked up and dropped off on the first day. We are big and small I have four suitcases personally.

Another good thing about staying in the Bird's Nest is that the glass plank road, cable bridge and other scenic spots are free, and the hotel shuttle bus is indeed more convenient, smaller and more advanced than the shuttle bus in the scenic spot.

You can ask the staff if you have any requirements. They are very enthusiastic and will also introduce you to the scenic spots. Even the driver is very polite every time you get on and off the car, and will answer you carefully no matter what questions you have.
If you hate bugs and go back to the room at night, you must close the windows before turning on the lights, otherwise there will be a lot of bugs (after all, it is in the mountains)
Breakfast is buffet.
The air in the mountains is very fresh.

msg:The hotel is located in the Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park. The rooms are distributed in the forest, and the architecture and natural landscape are integrated with nature. Pushing open the window and balcony door of the room, you can see the lush tropical vegetation around the room, and the view from the balcony is excellent. Sitting on the tatami mats on the balcony with your lover at 9 o'clock in the evening and listening to the sound of the forest, the slight mountain breeze is very pleasant. The shampoo and shower in the room smells good and is of good quality. It is very quiet at night, and I wake up naturally in the morning to the pleasant chirping of birds in the forest. The breakfast room also has a great view and a rich variety of breakfast. The management of the entire hotel is very good. You can take the hotel transportation car to visit the scenic spots in several forest parks that are given to hotel guests. The service staff are meticulous, courteous and thoughtful. Special thanks to Xiao He, the account manager, because we checked into the hotel late the day before, and the thoughtful arrangement allowed us to visit the scenic spots in the forest park with peace of mind. If you come to Yalong Bay in the future, this is the hotel you must stay in at the first stop.

msg:My best friend has stayed here before, and under her strong recommendation, we chose the Bird's Nest as one of the stops on our trip with friends. The weather in Sanya in April is not beautiful, it seems that there are always thick clouds and fog, and there is no sunshine, but the gift given to us by the bird's nest is not affected by the weather.

We watch the sunset and sunrise on the terrace of the room, listen to the singing of cicadas and birds. Watching the sea, watching the mountains, chatting about the world, stretching out your hands to feel the real feeling of turning your hands into clouds and covering your hands as rain...

The unique natural environment here, with 300% air humidity, can restore moisture to your dry skin. The mummy from Beijing experienced it for himself. The natural moisturizing effect of the bird's nest on the skin is beyond the reach of all skin care products. Moreover, living here has the magical effect of self-cultivation and peace of mind.

The environment and taste of the breakfast room are impeccable. I appreciate that operating a hotel on such a high mountain can reach the current standard. The Thai restaurant is also good, because there are food coupons given by the hotel, which are really good and cheap. The Chinese restaurant is under renovation, come and experience it next time.

The hotel is relatively old overall, but it is not a disadvantage. The air humidity on the mountain is 300%. I appreciate that the wooden structure hotel can be maintained like this. I want me to feel, I don't want you to feel.

Due to geographical constraints, the service is a bit slow, but responsive.

During the stay, Manager Xu and Manager He both called to greet and communicate, and gave us a surprise trip for our girlfriends, and upgraded us to Genting Eagle. I look forward to good luck in upgrading as regular customers next time. Manager Xu, I remember you promised me, if you see and reply me, we will definitely come again.

On departure a lady manager in the lobby sent us a hotel car to take us to the next hotel which was an added bonus and we are very grateful to her, but sorry I can't remember her name.

Finally, to summarize:

A day trip to the forest park is not recommended. You will never experience the most wonderful place in this forest without staying in the bird's nest.
It is not recommended to bring young children. To be honest, self-cultivation and calmness are not in line with the nature of young children. Older children can come to experience this unique natural environment.
Old friends reunion, honeymoon trip, yogis, people with stories, people with concerns, people with experience, mummy (sorry for using such a pompous adjective for people with dry skin, meant to be a joke.), want People who have established a connection with nature, middle-aged people who are shouldering heavy burdens and need to rest and adjust... Come on, the bird's nest can give you peace of mind.

Let me talk about the advantages first: the hotel service is really good, the car is on call, the restaurant has a variety of dishes, and the taste is also good. If you like tropical rain forests, I sincerely recommend staying here for one night. It is really living in a big forest. Children like it very much. It is a different experience.
Disadvantages: The guest rooms are all in the mountains, and you can only sit at the intersection by car. There is a long section of steps that you need to walk over by yourself. My baby is small, and I have to hug her up and down. There are more than 100 steps. I am tired and dizzy, so I bring my children If you have a baby, you must ask the front desk to help arrange a room with few steps (the front desk reminded me about the steps when I checked in, but I didn't accept it. I thought it was all for fun, and I regretted it after seeing the actual situation); there are indeed small animals in the room. There are many children (moths, geckos), you have to be mentally prepared for this, but it is understandable, after all, it is deep in the mountains, but the mosquitoes have not been found.
Bring her over when the child is older, and then you can fly in the rainforest.

The room is indeed very distinctive. Although it is the most basic peacock room, I am satisfied with the scenery and supporting facilities. Fortunately, I only went to see Ge Youshuqi's room before checking out, so it will not affect the mood haha. As soon as the sun sets, the mountains are quiet and dark, and I fall asleep very early, and I am awakened by various birds singing all over the mountains early in the morning. The scenery in the mountains is great, and hotel guests and ordinary tourists can switch peaks. We went to the two scenic spots of Orchid Valley and Cable Bridge at 3:00 in the afternoon. After breakfast the next day, we visited the scenic spots on the top of the mountain. Not many tourists. Although the room is a bit more expensive than other hotels, this special log cabin experience plus Shanli Park tickets and a very convenient battery car are really worth the money!

It was more than 200. This was clearly written on Ctrip when booking a room. I showed it to the girl at the front desk, and the girl at the front desk accepted it. Now I want to ask you at the front desk where the basis for the 300 yuan you mentioned comes from. It is so random. Ctrip has written it clearly in black and white. How can you have a different understanding of the charge? Please explain. There are the following situations when going to the Bird's Nest Hotel: 1. I have stayed at the Sun Bay Hotel in Yalong Bay and want to try the feeling of the Bird's Nest, 2. The factors of the movie If You Are the One, 3. Visiting the Bird's Nest Forest Park. To be honest, staying at the Bird's Nest is too inconvenient for traveling. It takes 20 minutes to wait for a parking lot to have breakfast, and some people have to wait for nearly 40 minutes for parking. The experience is so bad that I believe no one will stay there a second time. The final highlight is the Thai restaurant in the Bird's Nest. I asked the staff, is the Thai restaurant in the Bird's Nest Hotel? They said yes. The crab roe fried rice for 138 yuan does not have crab roe, but uses flour crab meat sticks. The photo does not match the real thing. The Thai chicken soup costs 198 yuan. It is almost soup with no solids, just a few finger-sized diced chicken and small mushrooms. The real thing is different. There is a serious discrepancy between the photos. Four charcoal-grilled prawns cost 398 yuan. The photos are consistent with the actual items. Why do some of the actual items match the photos and some do not? Please ask the staff of the Bird's Nest Thai Restaurant to order a 175 yuan seafood scallop fried rice at the Sun Bay Park Hyatt Tea Garden Restaurant to see how they cook it and also understand what "bad, deceptive, or even obscene words mean", you are on the mountain The cost is high, you can increase the price, but you can't fake it. Huangshan Xihai Hotel is much higher than the Bird's Nest, and the ingredients are all carried on your back, so it's expensive, but they don't fake it. I really don‚Äôt understand that in the entire five-star hotel in Yalong Bay, Baihua Valley Commercial, Haitang Bay Red Sand Food Stall Commercial, and Atlantis Undersea Restaurant, no matter whether they are expensive or cheap, there is no falsehood. This Thai restaurant of yours is really different. Every service staff at the Bird's Nest is very hard-working, and your Thai restaurant is also very "hard-working" and very weird. Dining at the Bird's Nest Thai Restaurant is the worst dining experience I have had during my many trips to Sanya, bar none. I suggest you go to the St. Regis, Marriott, Park Hyatt, etc. downstairs and don't rest on the laurels of "If You Are the One" all day long. Increase the parking capacity and don‚Äôt make customers wait for more than five minutes. We are here to travel, not to wait for a bus. If you don‚Äôt have diamonds, don‚Äôt do porcelain work. Finally, thank you to all the guys from the Bird's Nest Hotel who served us. You have worked hard. There are some things you can't change. Please ask Ctrip staff to conduct an on-site investigation of this Bird's Nest Thai restaurant.

The scenery on the top of the mountain is beautiful, and the tourist attractions are also beautiful. If You Are the One, please do not disturb, glass plank road, iron chain bridge. Because there were strong winds for two consecutive days, it was like Wuthering Heights at night. I was so scared that I wondered if the house would fly up to the sky in the middle of the night. The wind was like **. This place is not suitable for the elderly, and you have to go up and down the stairs at any time. I wanted to check out after the first day. I was so scared that I didn't sleep all night on the second day. I covered myself with a quilt and turned on the electric blanket the next day. It was colder than Beijing. I wanted to cry, but it will definitely be a memory many years later.

msg:Pass through the gate of the peacock and magpie, climb down the steps, and walk through about 11 wooden ladders of 14 steps into the round wooden house. The roof is conical. It is said that it has been renovated for more than ten years. The overall facilities do not feel too old. The platform in front of the house has a panoramic view of Yalong Bay below the mountain. There are desks, reclining chairs, and coffee tables in the room. It is very comfortable to sit on the reclining chair and write down your thoughts after watching the starry sky in the morning. It was very cold in the morning, and I put on the winter clothes I brought from the platform outside the house. The temperature inside the house is comfortable, as are the water pressure and temperature. I heard that the non-2 room is on the top of the opposite mountain, and the classic picture is on the right side of the mountain. I can't help but marvel at the huge design of the mountain resort. Each room has a unique view. Ctrip also read the reviews before booking. It said that there were small animals visiting. I haven't seen them on the first night of my stay. The room I was most satisfied with during my trip to Sanya. I am planning to give it to my companions. I wrote the first paragraph about my feelings, and I wanted to submit it, but I can‚Äôt comment because I haven‚Äôt checked out yet. I also experienced the convenient service of free glass walkway and instant VIP car pick-up and drop-off without buying tickets to the tropical forest park when I checked in the next day. It is necessary to leave a good review. When I entered the store, I noticed that the packaging design of the toiletries was unique. When I left the store, I found out that there was also a sewing kit that was threaded. For a person like me who usually does very few female celebrities, the service is small, but it is very heartwarming. . The breakfast in the western restaurant is very rich, and the Thai restaurant not far away is also very special. At first, the 200 yuan voucher given by the front desk was thought to be a breakfast voucher. It was useless in the Thai restaurant on the first day, but it was used when inviting friends to dine on the second day Yes, although it has been in operation for ten years, I feel that the service staff here still maintain a kind of simplicity. In the morning, I saw a cleaner sweeping the floor with a broom made of coconut leaves. After asking for his opinion, I took a picture of him sweeping the floor. I also asked my elder brother to help me take a picture of working. My elder brother was very enthusiastic and gave me many blessings. It is another wonderful feeling to write this text in front of the window where the green leaves are flourishing but no mosquitoes are troubled, there are occasional sparrows singing but ignorance often calls, in the natural oxygen bar surrounded by green trees, and in the pointed wooden house in front of the platform. . After checking out, I heard that I was going down the mountain on foot, and the handsome guy who drove the shuttle took the initiative to arrange a car for me. I was really touched. We are leaving Sanya today, thank you for the unforgettable memories the Bird's Nest has left for us.

You can visit the forest park at any time when you stay in the hotel. Taking advantage of the few people in the morning, I went to experience the cross-river cableway. There was no one there, which was great. Although the hotel is deep in the forest, the sanitation and service are very good. If you make a phone call, the staff will drive a VIP car to pick you up to various scenic spots in the park and hotel service areas. It is a perfect experience.

msg:advantage:
The environment of the hotel is very good. It is deep in the forest park. The rooms are scattered in twos and threes among the woods and hills. Some rooms can look at Haitang Bay from a distance. The sunset and sunrise are very pleasant surprises. I felt too much sea in Sanya. The feeling of being in a forest is very special. Personally, I think it is suitable for at least two nights. Try not to think about it for one night. If you don‚Äôt feel the advantages, there are many limitations.

During the stay, there is a shuttle battery car to drive to the room, various attractions and the main functional areas of the hotel, and it will be arranged quickly after a phone call. The breakfast may be due to the comparison with the Hyatt Hotel. The breakfast in this hotel is very appetizing. The restaurant has a beautiful environment and an open space surrounded by mountains. With the pleasant temperature in December, it is very comfortable and refreshing in the morning

The rooms have large and small balconies. Watching the sunrise and sunset is very good. The room is very secluded. It is very suitable for those who like quietness and privacy. It takes about half an hour to drive to the beach of Yalong Bay or Houhai Village for surfing. It is very convenient. If you don‚Äôt drive, it‚Äôs another don't talk

shortcoming:
The room facilities are outdated, the sanitation is very sloppy, there is dust in many places in the room, the towels and bathrobes are very, very worn out, the bathrobes have been washed and damaged very badly, and there are several insect eggs inside, it should be that it has not been touched for a long time However, such expensive guest supplies really give people a very bad impression

The bedding is also very cheap, and it feels like raw cloth. The bed on the mountain in December is damp and damp, and the bedding is even more stiff. There are many obvious stains on the curtains and paper books, and there are spider webs in the slightly higher part of the room

Sanya in winter is still relatively cold on the mountain at night. The washstand and shower in the wild goose room type bathroom are semi-open outdoors, and the bath water is warm, so it is very cold when you come back to take a bath at night. It is not very convenient to go to the bathroom and wear clothes on the bed

Summary: Suitable for couples, with a car, at least two nights or more, otherwise choose carefully. You can‚Äôt use the expectations of a five-star hotel by the sea to understand this hotel, but the scenery and feelings are completely different from other hotels, very unique!

Drive to the parking lot at the front desk, and the hotel has shuttle buses to pick up everywhere. There are small geckos indoors, it is recommended that boys come together. The breakfast is three-four star level, and the feature is that the drink has coconut milk.
Feel it, if you don't live on the mountain, there is no need to come to the forest park. You have to swim for two days. On the first day, come early to put your things at the front desk, check in at 3 pm, take a swim in the pool, and relax in the open-air bath after dark; go out to watch the sunrise on the second day (if you are lazy, you can use the indoor terrace ).
ps: There is a short mountain path from the platform to the room, which requires physical strength~

But you can experience the thoughtful service of the hotel everywhere. As long as you travel, call the front desk, and there will be a service car.
It is really enjoyable to stay in the hotel and enjoy the VIP service to visit the scenic spots. Avoid the waiting crowd. You can also play in two or more days. Less busy and tiring.
It is very cost-effective to book tickets for various items sent by the hotel. There is also a Thai lunch for two. Although the amount is a lot, it is no problem to eat well. The taste is also very good. I took my parents-in-law and children to experience it. The parents-in-law were very happy and said that they made up for their honeymoon 40 years ago.

Fortunately, I did not miss this treasure hotel, it is simply too beautiful, with a panoramic view of the mountains, the sea, and the coastline of the five-star hotel in Yalong Bay. I think the service is also very good, thank you Manager Sun and Xiao Chen for helping me solve the problem with all my heart. It is really not easy for the hotel to meet the personalized car needs of so many guests every day, and it has done a good job, which is greatly appreciated. When I come to Sanya in the future, I have to live in the Bird's Nest for a few days. Beautiful or not, look at the pictures, and the pictures really can't fully show the breadth and shock of the real scene.

The hardware facilities in both rooms are very well maintained, especially the air conditioner is very powerful and the hot water output is large. One room has sea view and the other has mountain view, both of which are very refreshing. The point is that the hotel's service is very good, showing professionalism and enthusiasm everywhere. Especially Xiao He at the front desk is always considerate of the guests. The liquid in a cardboard box we brought leaked out. Xiao He immediately arranged to clean it up and replaced it with a bigger box. When we left the hotel, he also took the initiative to ask us if we needed a car. After learning about our next hotel, he immediately arranged for a commercial car to take us there for free. Great service! Let's make great memories!

It is really close to the mountain and the sea, and the scenery is invincible. The service of the hotel is also very good. The package bought on Ctrip was also upgraded to Yunhe sea view room for free. But catching up with the bad weather these days, it's a bit cold. It's really a waste to have such a good swimming pool without a chance to go into the water. Because the hotels are too scattered on the mountain, you have to call a car when you go out. The road is a bit far away. It takes about 20 minutes to get a takeaway to the door. It takes nearly an hour to go back and forth, wait for the car, and so on. Of course, there is also a restaurant in the hotel, unless it is the room type next to us, it seems that the room type we live in is not too close. Other than that, I am very satisfied.

Although I stayed for three nights, I kept using the toothbrush when I unpacked it for the first time. The handle, although the hotel gives a new toothbrush every day, but I am environmentally friendly, a toothbrush will not be broken after three days, maybe the waiter thought I was not willing to use a new one, and threw away the toothbrush for me on the second night. There are not many waiters who can be so attentive (although I am really not economical). The balcony of the room faces the sea, and the mountain breeze is blowing, which is very comfortable. The first one is the room I live in, the second one is the dinner room, it was a good weekend, there were singers singing to add to the fun, and the third one is Yalong Bay from the balcony of the room.

I called the front desk at 8:00 the next morning to explain the situation and asked to change rooms. The merchant's attitude was negative and perfunctory. No one came forward to deal with it until 11:00. Later, when I complained to Ctrip, only a manager-level person came to deal with it. It was originally planned. I planned the itinerary and took the children out to play, but the whole morning was wasted, which not only delayed the trip but also affected the mood, and all the plans for the day were stranded.
There are not many types of breakfast, the taste is average, and the meals are not replenished in time, which is on the same level as the three-hundred-dollar business hotel breakfast. The victory is in the beautiful environment and the excellent scenery.
The Thai restaurant and the Chinese restaurant are merged, and the taste is acceptable, but nearly half of the dishes cannot be cooked.
The planned three-day, two-night Sanya parent-child tour was delayed due to the hotel's delay and no interest. Fortunately, the room type was upgraded on the second night, and the room, facilities and environment were improved by several grades, and I sat hard in the room.

The car can be picked up 10-15 minutes in advance. However, no one answered the front desk for 30 minutes during the rush hour for nucleic acid vehicles in the morning.

The scenery from the balcony is really amazing. It not only maintains privacy well, but also enjoys the view overlooking the entire Yalong Bay. Lying flat in the room is something I do every day.
Opened earlier, so the facilities are relatively old, but the overall use will not affect life. The materials on the mountain are scarce, so the food and beverages are relatively general. But these were "healed" by the service of the staff. All the porters (drivers) are very enthusiastic and patient, and they will say "home" when they take you back to your room, which is very interesting. Everyone is polite, courteous, and polite. They enjoy life here very much and will bring their families together in the future.
Finally, I would like to thank the guest manager Mr. Zeng, who has always cared about our experience and felt very warm!

A room with a swimming pool for egrets for three days, and a bird's nest on a large platform for drying clothes in a seven-day assembly area. The reason is of course the epidemic. But it was precisely the epidemic that made me feel a different kind of affection for this place. This place gives me comfort and relaxation, like a paradise, it isolates all kinds of anxiety from the epidemic under the mountain, and also soothes all kinds of regrets that I have not been able to travel for a year. The child said that this is our little home. This is the only hotel that can make children feel at home. I have never been so attached to any hotel.

The whole mountain is quiet, and the monkeys will sway on the road; the four little geckos in the bathroom are cute, maybe they are a family; the room got into the greedy squirrel, and the waiter helped us plug the loopholes and smoke them. Ai Zhu; there are all kinds of beautiful butterflies, and all kinds of birds singing happily; there is a big spider with a proud golden shell and red legs at the concierge desk opposite the restaurant... Guests can stroll to the top of the mountain park and have a cup of coffee , all kinds of pats; you can climb all the way from the Orchid Valley to the top of the mountain, challenging your courage and physical strength; you can make an appoin**ent for fishing in advance, and little brother Wu Tigang will dig earthworms and make fish food, help you coax your baby, accompany you to fish, and pick them for you. The pesticide-free lemon üçã on the edge of the fish pond also arranged to open the gym. Brother Chen Jipeng is invincible and caring. He is not only skilled in driving, but also has a very friendly attitude in dispatching vehicles and serving customers, and he can also think in a different position. I don‚Äôt know how long we will stay because of the epidemic. Pengzai helped us choose and adjust the room type according to our actual situation; I learned that my husband was inconvenient to eat at the restaurant because of the work conference call, so he specially packed breakfast and delivered it to the room; We returned to the lobby at the foot of the mountain and brought a POS machine to help us. We chatted with Peng Tsai and found that he knows a lot. He is a very interesting young man who is willing to endure hardship. With the spread of the epidemic, it is becoming more and more difficult to take out food Call, we discussed with the hotel's general manager Mao to order a meal, and the general manager Mao immediately arranged the staff meal every night, and it was delivered to the room according to the number of people, and it was free. Miss Luo Xingya is in charge of ordering dinner in the guest group every day. During breakfast, she especially remembers our preference - hot milk - and will serve it for us every day.
I met many such lovely little brothers and sisters in the hotel...
There are few guests in the hotel, but the service is more humane and more personal. We are equivalent to wrapping the entire scenic spot and swimming freely. It's so rare. Every place is so quiet, every place has a sense of detail, and it often makes us sigh, if there is no epidemic, I am afraid it will not be so leisurely, it is a dividend of the epidemicüòù
Although there are all kinds of embarrassments in the epidemic, we integrate into nature every day when we go out, breathe fresh air, overlook the mountains and the sea, listen to the birds singing on the branches, and play with butterflies and insects... The warm and friendly service of the little brothers and sisters of the hotel is even better. It's a bonus, you must call the service team of this hotel. Their warm heart and kindness made us live here happily without worrying about anything, without feeling of exclusion or anxiety during this special period.
Thanks for all encounters. Looking forward to revisiting.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in the "Bird's Nest". To be precise, if it wasn't for the epidemic, it would have been my fourth or fifth stay, because I fell in love with it from the first time I stayed here. The sea of color is simply a wonderland on earth, a natural oxygen bar, and the high-end retro decoration style is an experience that other hotels cannot give! Then there are "hygienic" white bath towels, clean bedding, and the hotel's thoughtful anti-mosquito sprays and mosquito nets, all of which will make you feel comfortable and at ease like home! Finally, the considerate concern of "Manager He" from the Customer Relations Depar**ent of the "Service" hotel like an old friend makes us feel like home to "Bird's Nest Hotel", so I would like to express my special thanks. And the service attitude is very friendly, no matter how tired you are, it is very rare to call a car and pick up and drop off in a timely manner. The waiter in the housekeeping depar**ent is also very good and always responsive and meticulous. The lady who delivered the meal also worked very hard to climb the mountain road. Deliver us meals. In short, the Bird's Nest Hotel in Paradise on Earth is like a second home in Sanya for our family. As long as there is no special reason, we will "go home" every year! ! !

msg:This trip to Sanya is the most special. It was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on August 6. Everyone knows what happened next... I lived in the Bird's Nest for 11 days, the Red-crowned Crane for three days, and the rest are in the Genting Crane. Because of the changes in the epidemic, the anxiety and anxiety every day is needless to say. Thanks to living here and enjoying the beautiful scenery and services, our family can work hard to maintain a good mood.

I didn't know that Sanya can really escape the summer. The bird's nest stands proudly on the top of Yunshan Mountain. When you enter, you can overlook the sea and the sky in Yalong Bay. When you retreat, you can listen to the singing of birds and insects, walk in the mountains, and encounter all kinds of small creatures. Needless to say, on a cloudy and rainy day, even if the sun is out, as long as it is in the shade of a tree, the breeze is still cool.

If you are not afraid of bugs, you will not make a fuss about the occasional gecko spider in the room, and you are willing to see all kinds of plants and small animals; if you will be surprised by the monkeys on the mountain road, you will appreciate the flying big butterflies, no Because the birds come to the swimming pool to take a bath and get angry, then the bird's nest is especially suitable for you.

Objectively speaking, the bird's nest is not without flaws. For example, the design of the washbasin and the comfort of the mattress are not ideal, and the room facilities are also a little old. But the unrivaled views and warm service here make up for it all.

Stayed here for a long time this time and got to know almost all the staff here. Different from the professional politeness of ordinary five-star hotel employees, they are more simple and friendly. When walking on the mountain road, no matter who drives a battery car and passes by, they will ask if they want to pick us up. Whether it is a maintenance master, a gardener, or a cleaner, they will greet us and solve the problems we encounter enthusiastically.

I like all the staff here, the battery car guy is always enthusiastic; Mr. Zeng, who is in charge of stranded passengers and tickets, has been helping us keep an eye on the flight; I took the liberty to ask the low-key boss about food and beverage issues, and he quickly offered us free Staff meals (also thanks to the canteen chef behind the scenes). Special thanks to Miss Sun Kai at the front desk, she really fulfilled her responsibilities as a housekeeper and responded to every request, even if she could not solve it temporarily, she would try her best to find a solution. She has done too many things for us: room upgrades, purchasing of daily necessities, various latest news pushes, air ticket information, solving the follow-up of car rental and so on. Thanks to her, we were able to make it happen.

I've never stayed in a hotel for so long, and never in a hotel made me want to express so much. If the clouds clear and the fog clears, and we can start our trip to Sanya again, the Bird's Nest will still be the first choice for our family.

Standing on the balcony, you can overlook the entire Yalong Bay, which is refreshing. Although we were stranded by the epidemic, every staff member of the hotel was very warm-hearted. Thanks to Manager Zeng and Manager Sun, they provided so much convenience for our stranded tourists. On the days when they can't go home, the child chases butterflies and catches bugs in the mountains every day without any worries. The hotel swimming pool cliff Tianchi is also one of the favorite places for children. It is backed by mountains and faces the sea. The location cannot be better. In short, we spent an extraordinary vacation in the Bird's Nest and met many friends from all over the world. If we come to Sanya next time, we will Will still choose the bird's nest!

msg:I have been thinking about the Bird's Nest Resort for several years, and this time I finally pulled the ****s! The hotel is located in the forest park, focusing on the original ecology, so we can't ask too much for cleanliness and exquisiteness. For example, in the Egret three-bay room where I live, there is no solid wall between the toilet room, shower room and the jungle outside, but only a locked glass door. But knowing that the gap is bound to exist, small bugs can come in completely, I think if the hotel is considering lighting or original ecology, it can directly install the glass wall and seal the gap with glue, which can keep the forest villa. The taste can also prevent insects and mosquitoes, and it is better to kill two birds with one stone. Besides, there are no flaws. The Egret Villa has its own swimming pool, although it is not big, but whenever it is hot outside, you can jump into a pool of clear water when you return to your room, drink a glass of iced drink, and overlook the quiet valley and the sea of Yalong Bay. It is really refreshing. ! On the morning of check-out, a little monkey ran to the balcony and stood by the pool for a while, then jumped into the jungle and disappeared. What a surprise üòÅ I ate at the Thai restaurant once, the lobster and crab tasted great, and so was the mountain top view Excellent, you can see the sunset glowing over the mountains. The western restaurant is a place to eat breakfast, the scenery is also great, there are many kinds of food, and the service attitude is very good. The battery car is always on call, and it is convenient to travel. Next time I want to try the room type on the other side of Genting, which is closer to the cliff swimming pool.

Every restaurant on the mountain is a little slower, the food tastes good and not expensive, and the key scenery is good. It can also reduce the probability of encountering small insects and small animals on the mountain, but it is unavoidable. Everyone must be mentally prepared.

It‚Äôs so convenient to live in the scenic spot. The shuttle bus is 24 hours a day, and the station is very close to the place where you live and the scenic spots, so you won‚Äôt be very tired with your children. It‚Äôs a great experience to walk across the Jianglong Cable Bridge before the individual tourists come. Well, it's cool in the mountains at night.
Play + scenery is simply beautiful, if you are tired from visiting a scenic spot, you can go back to your room to rest. The luggage is also helped by the concierge staff, so there is no burden at all. I have brought my children to Sanya several times, and I have always given up on Yalong Bay Forest Park. I thought I would not be able to see the scenery from the room, but the overall package is really considerate. I also brought my children to play a few attractions, which is very NICE!
I will definitely recommend it to my friends~

Because a centipede was found in the room and could not be dealt with in time, Manager Zhang arranged for a room upgrade and smoked wormwood in the room in advance to turn on the air conditioner. On the day of check-out, he also called to inquire about the check-in experience, which was very professional. There are basically no mosquitoes in the room, probably because of the small geckos that can be seen everywhere. It is completely acceptable for people like me who are not afraid of small animals. The room is very quiet and comfortable. It's just that the staff who make the house can see that they are not very skilled. It may be a new intern or a summer job who forgot to put a bathrobe, but it was replenished in time. I was pleasantly surprised to meet a little monkey when I went down the mountain to check out. The overall experience is very good, and the Eagle room type is recommended. To make a little suggestion, I feel that the whole hotel still uses If You Are the One 2 as a selling point, but after all, this is an old movie more than ten years ago, and now it seems that it has lowered the grade of the hotel a bit.

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was super large. Three or four people could take a bath together. The room was on the mountain. , Yingge Yan dance, insects and birds chirping, simply can not be too cool. There is also a grand launch of the super good service of the hotel. The battery shuttle is on call, and the breakfast is also very good. Especially, I like the hotel front desk manager Sun Kai. The tone is kind, and I will introduce the scenic spot and various services of the hotel in detail. I think everyone calls it Sister Kai, I will also call you Sister Kai, and the hotel is a plus point for her beautiful language and good language! This hotel is the first choice when you come to Sanya next time, and I strongly recommend it to everyone~~

The first ‚ú®The hotel is built in the Forest Park Scenic Area, and you will be given a tour map when you check in. With the hotel room card, you can go to some scenic spots for freeüòòüòò, such as the glass trestle bridge and the Jianglong cable bridge. These are basically in the Peak Park.
The second ‚ú®üåüThe biggest benefit is that üëèüëèThere are free shuttle buses to various attractions and restaurants, and you can go wherever you callüå∏üå∏, which is much more comfortable than other tourists walking or taking the tour bus in the scenic spot.
The third ‚ú®There is also a single family, because on the mountain, too young children do not come, the environment is super quietüâë, there is no noise from children, it is too good, you can sleep comfortablyüôÜ, very suitable for couples vacationüê∂.

Traffic üåàüåà
It takes 40 minutes to arrive at the front desk of the hotel by taxi from the airport, and the cost is about 100 yuan üôà. After check-in, take the shuttle bus to the room.
The red-crowned crane in the lower part is the closest by car, followed by Phoenix Terrace, and the top of Genting is the farthest. We lived in Phoenix Terrace for about 20 minutes, with 15 rooms, all with sloping roofs and swimming poolsüòòüòò.

Insect üåàüåà
I feel that the higher the height, the fewer mosquitoes, and the more beautiful the scenery ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç, swimming in the pool, surrounded by mountains, water and wind, is very comfortableüë∞.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I closed the glass door frequently, or I used mosquito repellent. I didn‚Äôt find many insects in the roomüòéüòé, not even mosquitoesüò≥, there will be red dragonflies by the poolüçÄüå∏, and green ones that look like leeches, the yard I found a beetle as big as the mouth of a water glass üôä, and woke up in the morning with all kinds of bird calls.

Suggestions üåàü§î
If there is a full-length mirror in the roomüòä, and a free airport pick-up service, it will be even more perfect haha üòèüòâ, and the food types that can be ordered by scanning the code in the room can be made more abundant.
By the way, the expectation of that Thai restaurant should not be too high ü•∫, if you don‚Äôt eat seafood, it is about 150-200 per person, and the service is average üôÑ.
üåüFinally, thank you for the little brother who picked us up when we checked into the room and when we left. He was kind enough to introduce the hotel, the bus stop, and the attractions. The car was also very stable and smooth. üâë

I was worried about the problem of mosquitoes and dampness, but after checking in, I found that the hotel thought more than us. I ordered wormwood in the room in advance, which not only reduced the damp smell, but also did not see many mosquitoes. The air conditioner is very powerful, and the water in the swimming pool is also Newly placed very clean. The hotel's Thai food tastes good, although the price/performance ratio is not high haha, but the beautiful mountain and sea views make up for itü§©
Plus, hotel guests enjoy free access to all attractions on the mountain (excluding ziplines and rafting). I am very grateful to the hotel housekeeper, Miss Sun, who is in charge of picking us up for meals, lodging, and traveling, and also taking our family to various attractions along the way.

My buyer posted a photo of a dinner in a Thai restaurant. You can try it. The restaurant manager is very good. It's also super good, with a gentle attitude and answering questions. The manager is also good, helping me to check out late. Overall, it is a word "value". When you arrive in Sanya, you can't live in the Bird's Nest.

What impresses me is that every staff here is very friendly and warm, the service attitude is very good, the quality is very high, it makes people feel like a spring breeze, which is great. If you want to pick a problem, it is some small insects such as ants and geckos, but the hotel also does sterilization. If there is a problem, you can ask them to deal with it, because after all, in the forest, some are inevitable. In short, I am very satisfied with this stay. .

msg:1. Because the hotel is on the mountain, it takes at least 20 minutes + drive for a single trip, and it does not include the time to wait for the shuttle bus. There are very few shuttle buses and the transportation is inconvenient, so there is basically no need to think about ordering takeout. Because takeaways can only go to the lobby at the foot of the mountain, no one can spend 1 hour back and forth to get a takeaway! 2. The smell of varnish in the room is particularly strong, so big that the gecko on the roof fainted, is it a little scary? . . Tears kept coming out of my eyes, but because it was already night when I checked in, I had to wait more than half an hour to go down the mountain, so I could only deal with the whole night helplessly. I didn&#39;t eat breakfast and decided to check out. 3. There are a lot of wild animals, geckos, big ants, and beetles are all active in the house. So be mentally prepared. 4. There is no hot water, because the hotel is powered by solar energy, and there is no hot water in the water for half an hour, so I can only give up! No bathing in summer! Make up your own feelings! 5. The staff has a very good attitude, helping to catch geckos, changing rooms, and coordinating check-out. Unfortunately, I can not accept this pure original ecological environment. 6. The agency of Ctrip is particularly poor. The hotel agrees to refund the unstayed room fee, but the agency does not deal with it. Ctrip service is very good, help with coordination.

Before moving in, it was a little unpleasant because of some small things, but what moved me was the Ctrip platform. The reason why Ctrip has done so well in this industry is really inseparable from the patient service of these staff. Thank you very much. Although the hotel facilities are a bit older, the hotel is equipped with complete facilities and the scenery is very good. The wooden house and the scenery are integrated, and it is worth staying. There are also comments that are very dissatisfied with this hotel in the online reviews, and my fair assessment is that. I personally think that if you stay within 1500, this hotel is still worth it, because it includes breakfast, tickets, and sightseeing cars.

Take a stroll in a quiet environment for wine tasting. The quality and meticulousness of the service here is beyond our imagination. Originally, the Dayan Room was upgraded to the Yunying Sea View Room in Genting. In order to relax without driving, I thought it would be inconvenient. The daily pick-up and drop-off of the battery shuttle is very timely and fast. If you have any demands, simply send a message to the customer service on WeChat, and the response speed is almost second. The front desk, restaurant service staff, battery car boy, WeChat customer service, cleaning staff, etc. in the park are very patient, speak softly and softly, and have a super good service attitude. They are more meticulous than five-star hotels by the sea. The Bird's Nest of Paradise on Earth in Yalong Bay is a warm place. Because it is the off-season, there are not many people going to many attractions, and it will not feel crowded and rushed at all. The glass plank road, the non-II trial marriage room, the rope bridge, and the lover's plank road have all become our pleasant walks. I like to be in a daze on the balcony of the room in the morning and at night, listening to the chirping of insects and birds around, watching the sea and the forest, watching the clouds and mist pouring down from the top of the mountain in the middle of the night. The voice of a singer came from the city at the foot of the mountain. Lying on the deck chair on the balcony, basking in the sun warmly...Meet the lovely bird of paradise mascot on the lover's plank road. In the room, I met a centipede that I had never seen before. The service staff soon Arrived and caught and snatched it up, but added spice to our holiday.

We left each other's visions for the second half of our lives on the message board.
We are here to love each other, hug each other, hold hands and kiss
This is our blessed place, it is the beginning of the second half of our life journey, we will definitely come back next time to try the Genting Villa with swimming pool.

Waiting for us to come back together next time! Thank you Bird's Nest!

The service speed is too slow, it takes more than half an hour from calling a car to getting on the car. The most irritating thing is that on the 10.4th Sanya all staff nucleic acid, no one informed us to do nucleic acid, where to do it! As a result, we were given a yellow code in the afternoon, and then we were unable to enter everywhere. We searched for yellow code nucleic acid sites everywhere, and we didn't finish the nucleic acid until after 10 in the evening. We had nowhere to go because we couldn't get the results at that time, and we sat on the street all night waiting for the nucleic acid report to come out, and the time code changed back at four in the morning. The feeling of sleeping on the street all night was terrible!

I can understand that this kind of room is inevitable. Insects, there were also some small red spots on my legs that had been bitten by small insects after staying one night. Of course, the staff asked the doctor at the scenic spot to take a picture of the small medicine. It was not a big problem.

The hotel service is absolutely five-star. The front desk of the Peacock Room I booked was upgraded to the Genting Eagle Room. I was so excited. I liked this room type online but I didn't book it because it was too expensive. The little yellow cart took me to the top of the mountain, helped me with my luggage and sent it to the room. After all, the room facilities are normal in the wind and sun on the mountain, but the sanitation is still clean and tidy. Living here can not care about this, the key feeling is different. Living in nature, especially listening to birdsong in the morning, watching the sea of clouds, and watching the sunset in the evening. This is unheard of in any hotel. The little yellow car is always on call, and it is convenient to go anywhere. Due to the epidemic, it was very fun to play with less people. There were not many people on the suspension bridge and glass plank road that used to be crowded, and you can take pictures in an empty space. In particular, I was the only one who walked across the Jianglong Cable Bridge, and the photos I took were so touching. Thai food on the top of the mountain is very famous. Usually it needs to be booked. Now I am alone. I choose the best location. God is good, I am enjoying the food and waiting for the most beautiful sunset. There is no discount for less people, service is not discounted, and live singers perform for me alone. In short, this time, the Bird's Nest Resort Hotel was comfortable and had a good time. Thank you to all the staff in the hotel for making me have a wonderful holiday.

msg:To live in a bird's nest for the dream ten years ago, I have to say that it is the ceiling. Looking at the sea after the room is upgraded, it is very comfortable to be alone on the balcony. It includes tickets for the scenic spot and some items. It is highly recommended! Next time I come to Sanya, I will come to live in this kind of quiet and comfort that cannot be obtained elsewhere. The courtesy call of the manager on duty in the morning and the enthusiasm of the concierge have completely overwhelmed many international hotels. I will definitely come again.

msg:The best memory of this trip to Sanya is the three days and two nights at the Bird's Nest Resort. Looking at the sea and mountains, it is pure natural and original ecology. Every morning is awakened by birdsong and sunshine. The resort is located in the scenic spot, and guests who stay in the hotel have battery cars to pick up and drop off at various scenic spots. They can really enjoy some beautiful scenery in the early morning and evening. It is recommended to stay for two nights. Thanks to the guest manager Xiao Sun for his warm and thoughtful service throughout the whole process. Next time, I will bring my family and friends to experience the suite of the Bird's Nest, and I want to share this beauty with everyone.

She warmly comforted me and said it was okay. , check if there is a room available, and arrange for us, and ask us whether we want two beds or a big bed, I really understand our concern when we saw that the villa was full of big beds when we booked in advance, and within the scope of our ability The hotel gave us the best service experience.

Arranged the shuttle bus, the drivers Huang Yongwang, Zhang Yali and Li Guolong on the road introduced the characteristics of the scenic spots and put forward suggestions on the time arrangement.

The hotel's shuttle bus is on call, which is very convenient. However, it is recommended to plan your own itinerary, because different attractions, meals, and accommodation are in different places, and the shuttle bus still takes a long time to go back and forth, and the mountain road is bumpy. The hotel includes sightseeing tours of the scenic spot, which is really worth the money. The taste of the Thai restaurant on the mountain is good, and the variety of breakfast is also ok, mainly because the environment is transparent, and the meal has the feeling of being in the clouds on the top of the mountain. It's a pity that it was raining on the day we stayed, the fog and humidity were heavy, and the scenery was a lot hazy. If it was sunny, it would be great.

There will inevitably be moths, spiders, and geckos in the room. I was very scared when I saw it on the first night, and I was even worried that I would dream of all kinds of bugs coming to me at night. I didn't expect to sleep very peacefully. The next morning, you can easily greet and talk to little geckos and antsüòä, but if you have severe phobia or cleanliness, be careful!
Both the mountaintop pool and the cliff pool have a very good view, but the mountaintop pool is 1.6 meters, and I didn't dare to go into the water when I was in my early 1.6 meters, so I only went to the cliff pool.
Dayanfang washbasin/bathtub/toilet are all outside the room, which is a little inconvenient. In addition, there are many ants and moths outdoors, so the bathtub is basically afraid to use, which is a bit wasteful. The space also seems a bit cramped inside.

The overall living experience is very good, the service is in place and timely, and the ecological environment is first-class. I will try other room types when I have the opportunity.

All the staff in the front desk guest room area are very polite and enthusiastic to us, especially the manager Sun Kai, who provides caring and thoughtful service, and answers all questions. There are mountain roads from the room to the restaurant, so walking is not enough. Call in advance and the hotel's special car will come to pick you up soon. It drove very smoothly, and also provided scarves intimately, and there were windshield curtains in the car, all paying attention to details. Our itinerary and itinerary are for reference:
1. Arrive in the afternoon, check in at the front desk, and transfer the car to Yunying.
2. After packing up, the car was sent to the Peak Park, playing the glass plank road, the trial marriage room, and the magic theater. The playing time of Magic Cinema is every hour or half hour, and the movie is 6 minutes. It's good-looking, don't miss it.
3. Take the scenic transportation vehicle to the Orchid Valley, walk a small circle, not up the mountain.
4. Orchid Valley Cart picks up the restaurant for dinner, and sends it to the room after the meal.
5. The car is sent to the cable bridge. The cable bridge opens at 8 o'clock, and you can wait at the Yanbo Pavilion to take pictures in the morning. When the door opens, there is no one to take pictures.
6. Walk across the cable bridge to the cliff Tianchi and take pictures in the water, so bring your swimsuit when you go out. But the water temperature is a bit cold in the morning.
7. Come out from the cliff Tianchi and walk to Qianli Umbrella. The wind is so strong. Be careful that your hat is blown off. After coming down, walk to Haitang Station and call a car to have breakfast.
8. Feilongling Western Restaurant, the scenery is so beautiful, the breakfast variety is also quite rich, you can go back to the room after 10:30.
9. Call a taxi back to the front desk to check out.
Take your room card and card holder when you go out. Don‚Äôt forget the card holder. You can enter the scenic spot with this card, and you can also take the scenic bus directly.
You don't have to worry about bugs when you go out and close the windows and doors.
Very satisfying experience, excellent value for money, next time I will experience zipline and other projects.

After talking to Manager Sun, Manager Sun immediately arranged to transport the luggage on the way. The luggage was sent to the Thai restaurant for me to take out the clothes before sending it to the room. My husband has been to Kunming within 13 days without a 48-hour nucleic acid test report. He was stopped by Beijing Daxing Airport and was unable to board the plane. Instead, he flew to Sanya the next day. After learning about this situation, Manager Sun took the initiative to extend the check-out time for us, so that my husband could see the Bird‚Äôs Nest Villa as he wished, and toured the glass plank road and Yunding Park. Not only saw the beauty of the tropical paradise, but also felt the warm service of Manager Sun and other staff. Here I want to say: Thank you, Manager Sun!

3. The service attitude is extremely poor. There is no reception in the hotel lobby. The service staff driving the battery car talk like others owe him millions
Stayed in a five-star hotel for countless times and gave a bad review for the first time

And the hotel facilities are also very good, the hotel accommodation fee has been included, the glass plank road and cable bridge in the park and other projects. The glass plank road really has a very high rate of filming üì∑! It is recommended to check in! If you are lucky, you can meet new people who come to take wedding photos.
The Haikuotiantian restaurant in the hotel also tastes great! It is recommended to sit on the corridor outside and have an early meal. Before the sunset has completely fallen, the viewing angle and a**osphere are amazing! It's a bit cold because of the strong wind on the mountain! You can ask the staff to bring you a blanket to cover it. Very warm.

At night, looking up from the balcony of the room, you can see a lot of stars ‚ú®It's really a surprise. And the naked eye can vaguely see the galaxy. It's a pity that I don't have a SLR, so I can only take pictures with my mobile phone. The effect is far less shocking than the naked eye. The next three photos are the effect of the phone's ISO sensitivity adjusted to 3200 and the shutter speed set to 2s and 5s.

Finally, I would like to thank Xiao Sun, the guest manager of the Bird's Nest Resort. The service attitude is really good and very caring. Must like it~
Tips: If you live in the Bird's Nest, as long as you are in the park, scenic spots, restaurants and other places, you can directly call a car to pick you up to various locations! No need to wait for public buses with tourists! This is really a lot of time to cancel the contract! And remember! Be sure to bring your room card when you play, the ticket and proof of travel are your room card!

The check-in procedure of Xiao Lai at the front desk is very fast, and the explanation of the facilities is very clear. The housekeeper Xiao Xu is very conscientious. The room is clean and spacious, and the bedding is very comfortable. The room is smoked with moxa, which repels insects and disinfects. There are no small animals such as insects and geckos in the room that others have said in the comments. From the balcony, you can have a panoramic view of the entire Yalong Bay. Drinking tea on the balcony, blowing the mountain breeze, and looking at the bay are very comfortable and cozy. Dinner will be enjoyed at Haikuo Tiantian Restaurant. The restaurant has a beautiful view, Thai food tastes good and the price is reasonable; breakfast is a buffet, with many varieties of Chinese and Western styles, and the restaurant has a nice view. In short, I will stay in Sanya next time, and I highly recommend everyone to stay.

msg:A very poor accommodation experience. When I got off the car, I saw a black snake on the stairs, which shocked the child. When he entered the room, the child just lay on the bed and ran out from under the pillow. A gecko crawled directly over the child and ran. , Scared the child to cry directly. Entering the bathroom, a thumb-sized spider ran underground. There was a lot of realgar sprinkled on the stairs, and I felt a little better. At night, the child was scared and basically did not sleep. The most overwhelming thing was that he found a gecko in his suitcase when he arrived at Haikou Meilan Airport. The price is more than two thousand, I really don't know how you should stay in your hotel.

Just make a phone call wherever you go in the scenic area, and pick up and drop off from the hotel, but I feel that the view of several scenic spots is not as good as that of our room. Hahahaha. The free breakfast is a set meal system, and the view is also great. I went to a Thai restaurant to eat in the evening. The consumption was high and the portion was small. However, the view was invincible and the sunset was invincible. If you want a better view, you need to call earlier to make a reservation. But we didn't leave the hotel during the whole journey, and we didn't know that it was inconvenient for the hotel to go to other places. It felt that it was far away from the beach. I am very satisfied overall, and I will consider staying again if I come to Sanya again.

Due to the large number of children, he did not choose Genting Eagle, but a magpie. Not long after entering the room, another manager called to ask about the experience of staying in, and the answer was very satisfactory. Called for children's supplies and mineral water. There are imported juices in the minibar, all free of charge. The room is handled well, no small animals enter the house. Only the palace was seen from the terrace and outside the house. The house and stairs are indeed not short in age, and some of the wood has been replaced with new ones. The hotel facilities in the mountains went to the gym, children's playground, spa (looked at), Thai restaurant, western restaurant (buffet breakfast). This time I played in the park, and visited the sea view glass plank road, drifting, and If You Are the One. Rafting is highly recommended, similar to the brave advancing of rapids, the duration is more than ten minutes, thrilling and not dangerous. The glass plank road is also highly recommended, with few people, clean and beautiful scenery.

However, in Sanya, the general itinerary is to take summer vacation on the mountain, and half of the trip is also very good on the beach. When staying at the hotel, the hotel lobby housekeeper Mr. Huang Shaoying was particularly helpful. On that day, we took two children and specially upgraded two room types to us. There are fewer steps and the view is good. It is really love. Every night, the sent driver stopped several times to show us the fireflies on the mountain, the children were very happy. Maybe because of personal happiness, I love the environment of this hotel, I hope to bring my parents next time, it is really a paradise, hope to solve the deep sorrow of the mountain.

msg:The overall feeling is good, focusing on service.
advantage:
1. The hotel is located in the scenic spot, including scenic spot tickets and some paid play items. In this way, the price/performance ratio is very good, and the environment is good, just in the tropical rain forest
2. All areas of the hotel are far away, you need to take a golf cart to go up and down the mountain, you can arrive soon after calling the car, check-in and check-out are arranged for the little brother to help carry the suitcase
3. The breakfast is rich, and the western restaurant where breakfast is served has a nice view
In addition, the hotel is too big, there are many places to visit in 2 days, the swimming pool, gym, restaurants, attractions are divided into different areas, staying in the rainforest can only be felt for 1 day
Personally like small animals, but the little red crab disappeared the next day, I hope everyone just can‚Äôt do it
Insufficiency: Lower expectations about humidity. When we arrived in a typhoon, there was fog in the mountains when it rained, the house could not be insulated from the fog, and the room had a dehumidifier and air-conditioning.
There is also a need to lower the expectations of the steps. If you like to be clean, it is good to walk more steps. If your legs and feet are inconvenient, let them be arranged as close as possible.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, in the forest park with its own oxygen bar environment. And the hotel includes tickets to the forest park, so it's very convenient to go out and visit the scenic spots! It is very convenient to call the shuttle bus, and the attendant has good driving skills and goes directly to the scenic area or the door of the room, saving extra distance. The hotel lobby manager Huang Kaijian has a very attentive and meticulous service, and the service experience is very good! The hotel is a good choice for couples, parents and children to go out and play!

msg:I really want to live here. If you are the one, this movie scene impressed me too much. There happened to be a package, so I ordered a 2-night package.
Let me talk about the advantages first: the scenery is really beautiful, and it is a blockbuster if you shoot it easily, and the video photos are all good-looking. The view of the infinity pool is also very good. It's really convenient to live in the scenic area, and the car from the hotel can be delivered to various scenic spots. The service is also good. The room is also very romantic, that is, it is very cozy during the day. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and there is also a good view by the window.
Disadvantages: The peacock room I live in is a round bed with curtains on it. If you cover the curtains, the space for the bed is relatively small. Two people are a bit crowded. But if you don‚Äôt use curtains, then you have to accept all kinds of flying outside. Bugs, geckos, spiders, etc. do not affect your sleep. I saw the hotel‚Äôs reminder about bugs when I was making a reservation. When I checked in, there was also a reminder of bugs at the front desk. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously, but after staying for one night, my mind building collapsed. I communicated with Ctrip and the hotel. The package cannot be refunded, so I can only recognize the loss and change to a hotel.
When I checked out, the front desk manager asked me why I was not staying, and I said there were too many bugs. He explained to me that it has rained recently and there will be more worms, and he said that he can change me to a reinforced concrete room with fewer worms. Ah, I don't know there is such a room. The hotel money is paid and cannot be refunded. The front desk manager is good, he said that I would keep it for a week, and I can stay for another night if I want to stay. But I shouldn't be here.
In fact, there are a lot of people living in this hotel, maybe there are not so many bugs in other rooms, or they are not afraid of bugs, but for a northerner, they have never seen so many bugs in the house. In my room, I found leaks, bugs can get in.
Staying for one night to experience it, I also recommend it, but we have to come during the day. We arrived at night. It was dark and there were a lot of insects. It was not good to feel in my heart. The scenery will be beautiful when we see it in the daytime the next day.

msg:So beautiful! Since it is not peak season and weekend, the front desk helped to upgrade the magpie room. There is also a big pavilion in the cabin, which is great! The privacy of the wooden houses is very good. Each house is built on a split level and is sheltered by dense plants, giving you enough distance that you can't see me and I can't see you.
The chalet exudes a charming and rich woody fragrance. In the pavilion, I had a home-made afternoon tea and enjoyed the feeling of embracing nature. Some facilities are a bit old, but it just so happens that these old add a different flavor to the house.
Stayed here for 3 nights, the experience is very good, the hotel service is also very caring, no matter where you get lost in the deep forest park, they can send a car to pick you up, full of security. The breakfast variety in the hotel is quite good, and the group purchase and lunch at the Thai restaurant are all very authentic. Looking forward to seeing you again (¬¥Õà ‚åµ `Õà )œÉ‡Æ£‚ô°Ôªø

msg:This is my first self-driving trip around Hainan Island. The hotels and services I have stayed at in the past few days have been very good. I am also a platinum member of Marriott. After watching If You Are the One, I have always wanted to stay at the Bird's Nest Hotel, so I can experience it while there are fewer people during the epidemic.
This stay was very uncomfortable. Firstly, the hotel clearly allowed me to drive to the room, but they told me that I was driving a sports car and could not drive to the room, so I had to take a shuttle bus. Secondly, I compromised on the shuttle bus and offered to order takeout food and drinks. I helped deliver the room, but the problem came. When we arrived in the room, the front desk turned against us and refused to acknowledge us. They directly said that there is a rule that we can only bring drinks to the room. We did not help with food. Thirdly, we communicated several times to no avail. We changed the phone to another manager. He immediately turned his back and said, "Whoever promised to deliver food to the room will tell me his name and I will go find him." I was having a great time traveling, so I wanted not to worry about it, but I just don‚Äôt understand why the manager of this hotel can insult guests like this, just like the phenomenon of eating seafood and robbing guests in Sanya in the 1990s. It seems to be saying that my hotel is like this. Don't come here if you can't. After spending 7 days traveling around the island, my stay this time was the worst and most expensive. Not to mention the poor service attitude, I also had to endure the hotel's bullying of customers. Never stay here again and never recommend!

msg:Because of the epidemic, we need to cancel the order, and the itinerary card has been clearly written with medium and high risks (in order to protect my privacy, the phone part of the itinerary card is now erased, and the one sent to the hotel has a phone number). In order not to cause trouble for the people of Shanghai and Sanya, and for those who travel, we have decided to cancel all the itineraries. During the whole process, Shanghai Peace Hotel, Disneyland, Toy Story Hotel, and Sanya Pullman Hotel (these are all non-cancellable) were very happy to help with a full refund after seeing our itinerary card! Only Sanya Yalong Bay Paradise on Earth - the Bird's Nest Resort, asked for a variety of itineraries, and finally deducted 800, and said that it could not be fully refunded! We are convinced, and for the safety of ourselves and others, we just buckle it up. We still backed off the trip and squatted at home. I thought not to cause trouble to the hotel because of us, but they didn't appreciate it. Looking at the Mangrove Hotel now, I suddenly thought, if I got angry at that time, and then the hotel was quarantined together, would the hotel be satisfied!
 Here I still want to praise Ctrip. I have been busy coordinating various hotels throughout the whole process. Because the Bird's Nest cannot refund the full amount, I made several calls to apologize and thank the customer service for their help.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first: it is very suitable for tourists who go to the tropical forest park to live, so you can choose to stay in the morning and night without hot and rest directly. The breakfast is rich, the Thai restaurant is also very good, and the housekeeper Xiaosun and Manager Zhang are also very attentive service .
Let's talk about the disadvantages: the facilities are too old! Hurry up and renovate it! The outdoor unit of the air conditioner was installed on the wall, buzzing all night! The park is too big, there are too few shuttle buses, and there is no sight for 20 minutes during peak hours, waiting for you to discuss. Then, the pool villa is actually two families sharing a swimming pool, my God, this anti-human design can be quickly changed when it is renovated!
