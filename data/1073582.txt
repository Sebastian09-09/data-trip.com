msg:The overall environment is good. The hotel is located in the park and is very large. The scenery in autumn is beautiful. The service staff in the hotel are warm and considerate. The female supervisor at the front desk always greets you with a smile when talking and doing things, which is very good! The room is quiet and smell-free, and the bedding is clean and of high quality. The twin room has two beds of 1.4*2 meters, which is very friendly to a family of 2 large and 1 small! There are basketball courts, football fields outdoors, table tennis indoors, swimming pools... There are also campsites where you can hold lawn weddings and fire parties in the evening🔥 which are also very interesting... suitable for parent-child travel. Overall praise!

The size of the room is okay, but the bathroom is not flattering. Since there is no wet or dry, at least it should be separated. Two people can't enter at the same time! The comfort of the bedding is not as good as that of the 4-star hotel the night before, and the hygiene is also average~ I will not continue to stay~

The hotel is not very big, but it is a pity that the room is clean and tidy, but the drinking water is a pity. The room is only equipped with two bottles of water, and you need to buy it at your own expense after it is used up. This is something I rarely encounter in other hotels. Shopping is inconvenient. The hotel is in a large park, with children feeding small animals, tent areas, and real cs. This place is more suitable for group building.

There are many ginkgo trees and chestnut trees in the villa. It must be beautiful in autumn, and it is estimated that chestnuts can be picked [laughing]

The waiter is proactive and polite, the hotel is decorated in European style, the facilities are a little old, the tap is too low, and the kettle can't be plugged in. Can't find where the comb is.

More than 30 of them were caught in one night! Fighting bugs until three o'clock in the morning, the room ran out of paper! Originally I wanted to rest, but I was so tired that I couldn't sleep well! When I checked out, I talked to the front desk, and they said that we were "a little bit more". Originally, I booked the room because I was afraid that it would not be clean and there would be too many bugs. The family said it would be better to book a tent directly. Maybe the tent could not find so many bugs!
I couldn't bear it anymore before I remembered to take a picture, and attached a few pictures for everyone to see! !

The service of the hotel is acceptable. When I came back from Huairou Wanda in the evening, the room has been added with electric heaters and thick quilts, but to be honest, it was still cold at night.
Compared with the summer, the environment in the manor after the heavy snow this winter still feels very good.
Children's play activities are basically charged.

The various amu*****t packages I saw online are basically basic None, just in time for the rain these days, only one day I saw a light show and an open-air movie. The so-called barbecue is not a charcoal grill, and there is no mutton skewer. You can play table tennis and billiards in the hotel, but the price of 50 yuan an hour and 100 yuan an hour is astonishingly expensive. There is a small swimming pool for swimming, but the water temperature of 26 degrees is prohibitive. The room is relatively spacious, the bathroom is small, and there is no place to hang towels. I have nothing to say if this is a 3 star hotel, but at almost 600 per night it's not worth it.

msg:Let’s take a trip and summarize. From the perspective of play, the hotel facilities are quite complete. The park is super big with mountains and water, swimming pools, lawn open-air movies, concerts, football trampolines and a cute pet paradise (it’s not open, it’s said in July) It only opens on the 10th). If you have energy, you don’t have to go outside for a day. The hotel has its own restaurant with affordable prices and suitable tastes. I am a southerner who can eat. I don’t want to go indoors to eat barbecue on the lawn at night. There are music and open-air movies. The a**osphere is good. The deluxe twin room we booked is about 30 square meters in size, and the view can be seen from the window. It is worth mentioning that the bed in his house is relatively large, and the twin beds in general hotels are relatively narrow. It feels like one meter, four to five meters, and a family of three can sleep in a twin room. In terms of cost performance, the price of 880 is a conscience price for giving so many items to play on weekends. The main reason is that children like to play in water and can swim for free.

衞生：衞生還不錯，不管是莊園內，還是房間內，都還不錯，像個5星級酒店的樣子。

環境：環境挺好的，挨着一個小水庫，那景兒真是沒誰了，整個莊園綠化90%吧，因為我們去的時候是下雨，好多娛樂的東西都沒開。也沒體驗到！
PS：莊園外面晚上特別特別特別黑，有點兒恐懼的黑。

服務：服務我真的得好好説説了，但是，我在這裏特別聲明，不是指責哪位個別的服務員，而是説酒店整體的服務理念，意識真的不配五星級酒店。先説一進門，未成年人不帶身份證，或者户口本不允許入住，説是公安局最新的規定，我們知道是規定，我應該是要遵守的，但能不能也有點兒人情味兒。
第一，説是公安局的新規定，你拿規定讓我看看，或者你給領導打個電話，不管真的假的，你站在客人角度上考慮一下，讓一個小學生先登個記，下次再想着拿證件，這也讓我們客人心理感覺熱乎的。而不是冰冷的拒絕我們入住。
第二，外面下着雨，能不能先給我們開個房間，等雨停了再讓我們去補證明。
第三，辦完入住後，所有裏面的早餐票，騎行卡，都沒給我們介紹怎麼用，我們得自己問！這是辦入住。

晚上8點半左右，酒店裡的餐廳關門，就不能吃飯了，我能理解，下班了嘛！但房間電話裏有個送餐的功能，我説能不能送瓶酒或者飲料，跟我説的是，不行，因為我們下班了。所以晚上8點半，想吃點兒喝點兒的，衹能開車出去想小賣部，或者點外賣。
但是，但是，外賣衹能送到大廳，沒人給你往樓上送，也沒有機器人啥的，衹能自己去前台拿！

哦對了，早餐，先不説品種多與少，對於少數民族的夥伴就沒那麼友好了，所有肉，都是豬肉，培根，火腿腸，蛋炒飯裏也都是火腿。
除了喝碗粥，吃口鹹菜，就是去吃大拌菜了，對減肥有好處！

對於5月25號在健身房值晚班的服務員，給您點個贊，熱情，耐心。給您添麻煩了，謝謝您。
走的時候往拿手機，耳機了，感謝服務員幫我找到，寄回來，也謝謝你們！感謝🙏

msg:酒店徒有唬人的外觀，總體水平跟價格實在不太相符。
先説最致命的一點安全隱患：可能是為了保護地毯，房間地毯上還鋪了一塊薄薄的毛巾被一般厚的毯子，皺皺巴巴，家人都被絆倒了，幸虧沒有受傷。帶孩子或長者的親們一定要小心了。地毯弄臟了多少錢？摔傷了人多少錢？愚蠢的做法！
房間：設施陳舊，電視比我電腦顯示器還小，連接的歌華機頂盒還是標清的。衞生間特別緊湊，洗手盆水龍頭到盆底衹有十釐米左右高，沒法接水，洗毛巾也不方便，真是奇葩設計。
服務：從前台到餐廳服務員一沒笑容，二不主動。倒是門口保安和客房服務員比前台都熱情一些。
早餐：攜程五鑽的酒店，早餐也就三星級酒店水平，品種非常少。甚至沒有現煎的雞蛋，現煮的粉、麪、餛飩之類的。
總結：四五星級的房價，三星級的硬件，快捷酒店的服務。

周邊環境還不錯，畢竟曾經是高爾夫球場，儘管草皮已經廢了，但格局和林木還在，有濕地公園的感覺。有露營地、CS場地、寵物樂園等休閑場地，酒店內有室內泳池（儘管不大）。
房間內部裝修算是八成新的感覺，衞生還不錯。餐飲口味中上，菜量足，價位中上。
